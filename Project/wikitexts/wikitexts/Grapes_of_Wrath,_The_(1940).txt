It was based on [[John Steinbeck]]'s 1939 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Grapes of Wrath|novel of the same name]]. The screenplay was written by [[Nunnally Johnson]] and the executive producer was [[Darryl F. Zanuck]].<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0032551|title=The Grapes of Wrath}}.</ref>\n\nThe film tells the story of the Joads, an [[Oklahoma]] family, who, after losing their farm during the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, become [[migrant workers]] and end up in [[California]]. The motion picture details their arduous journey across the United States as they travel to California in search of work and opportunities for the family members, and features cinematography by [[Gregg Toland]].\n\nThe film is widely considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. In 1989, it was one of the first 25 films selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter being released from [[prison]], Tom Joad [[hitchhiking|hitchhikes]] his way to his share-cropper parents' farm in [[Oklahoma]]. He comes upon Jim Casy, an [[Itinerant preacher|itinerant]] man sitting under a tree by the roadside. Tom remembers Casy as the preacher who [[baptism|baptized]] him, but Casy has \"lost the spirit\" and his faith. Casy goes with Tom to the Joad property. It is deserted but they find neighbor Muley Graves, who is hiding out there. In a flashback, he describes how the local farmers were forced from their farms by the land deedholders, who knocked down their houses with tractors. Tom soon reunites with the family at his uncle's house. The Joads are migrating with other evicted families to the promised land of [[California]]. They pack everything into a dilapidated car adapted to serve as a [[truck]] to make the long journey. Casy decides to accompany them.\n\nThe trip along [[U.S. Route 66|Highway 66]] is arduous, and it soon takes a toll on the Joad family. The elderly Grandpa dies along the way. Tom writes the circumstances surrounding the death on a page from the family [[Bible]] and places it on the body before they bury it, so his death will not be mistaken as a homicide if discovered. They park in a camp and meet a migrant man returning from California. He scoffs at Pa's optimism about opportunities in California and speaks bitterly about his experiences in the West. Grandma dies when they reach California. Eldest son, Noah, leaves the family, while son-in-law, Connie, deserts his pregnant wife, Rose-of-Sharon.\n\nThe family arrives at the first transient migrant campground for workers. The camp is crowded with other starving, jobless, and desperate travelers. As their truck slowly makes its way through a row of shanty houses and around the camp's hungry-faced inhabitants, Tom notes it, \"Sure don't look none too prosperous.\"\n\nAfter seeing trouble between the sheriff and an agitator, the Joads hurriedly leave the camp. The family goes to another migrant camp, the Keene Ranch. After working in the fields, they discover the high [[food prices]] in the company store, the only one in the area. When a group of migrant workers is striking, Tom wants to learn more about it. He attends a secret meeting in the dark woods. When the gathering is discovered, Casy is knocked out by a camp guard. Tom inadvertently kills the guard while defending himself.\n\nTom suffers a serious cheek wound, making him easily recognizable. That evening, the family hides Tom when guards arrive searching for who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted, and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving awhile, the truck breaks down at the crest of a hill. They have little gas and decide to coast down the hill to where there are some lights. They arrive at the Farmworkers' [[Weedpatch Camp]] (\"Wheat Patch\"), a clean facility run by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children have never seen before.\n\nTom is moved to work for change by what he has witnessed in the various camps. He tells his family that he plans to carry on Casy's mission by fighting for workers' rights. He leaves to join the movement, committed to fighting for [[social justice]].\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Grapes of Wrath, The - (Original Trailer) - 01.png|thumb|Henry Fonda as Tom Joad]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Tom Joad\n* [[Jane Darwell]] as \"Ma\" Joad\n* [[John Carradine]] as Jim Casy\n* [[Charley Grapewin]] as William James \"Grandpa\" Joad\n* [[Dorris Bowdon]] as Rose of Sharon \"Rosasharn\" Joad\n* [[Russell Simpson (actor)|Russell Simpson]] as \"Pa\" Joad\n* [[O.

However, the second half and the ending in particular are significantly different from the book. While the book ends with the downfall and break-up of the Joad family, the film switches the order of sequences so that the family ends up in a \"good\" camp provided by the government, and things turn out relatively well for them.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Grapes of Wrath| url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Grapes-Of-Wrath/dp/B00A32CKKI/ref=sr_1_2?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1363211199&sr=1-2&keywords=grapes+of+wrath| website=Amazon Video| access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the novel, Rose-of-Sharon (\"Rosasharn\") Rivers (played in the film by [[Dorris Bowdon]]) gives birth to a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] baby. Later, she offers her milk-filled breasts to a starving man, dying in a barn. These scenes were not included in the film.\n\nWhile the film is somewhat stark, it has a more optimistic and hopeful view than the novel, especially when the Joads land at the Department of Agriculture camp \u2013 the clean camp.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Also, the producers decided to tone down Steinbeck's [[politics|political]] references, such as eliminating a monologue using a land owner's description of \"[[communism|reds]]\" as anybody \"that wants thirty cents an hour when we're payin' twenty-five,\" to show that under the prevalent conditions that definition applies to every [[migrant worker]] looking for better wages.\n\nThe film emphasizes Ma Joad's pragmatic, forward-looking way of dealing with their situation despite Tom's departure, as it concludes with her [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]] \"We're the people\" speech.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}<ref>Steinbeck, John. ''The Grapes of Wrath'', 1939. Penguin Classics; Reissue edition October 1, 1992.</ref>\n\nIvy and Sairy Wilson, who attend to Grandpa's death and travel with the Joads until they reach California, are left out of the movie entirely. Noah's departure from the family is passed over in the movie. Instead, he simply disappears without explanation. In the book, Floyd tells Tom about how the workers were being exploited, but in the movie he does not appear until after the deputy arrives in Hooverville. Sandry, the religious fanatic who scares Rose-of-Sharon, is left out of the movie.\n\n[[Vivian Sobchack]] argued that the film uses visual imagery to focus on the Joads as a family unit, whereas the novel focuses on their journey as a part of the \"family of man\". She points out that their farm is never shown in detail, and that the family members are never shown working in agriculture; not a single peach is shown in the entire film. This subtly serves to focus the film on the specific family, as opposed to the novel's focus on man and land together.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Grapes of Wrath (1940): Thematic Emphasis Through Visual Style| last=Sobchack| first=Vivian C.| journal=[[American Quarterly]]| volume=31| issue=5| year=1979| pages=596\u2013615| doi=10.2307/2712428| jstor=2712428| publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, most of the Joad family members are either reduced to background characters \u2013 in the case of Al, Noah, and Uncle John \u2013 or to being the focus of only one or two relatively minor scenes \u2013 like Rose-of-Sharon and Connie. Instead, the film is largely concerned with Tom, Ma, and (to a lesser extent) Jim Casy. Thus, despite the film's focus on the Joads as a specific family rather than a part of the \"family of man\", the movie explores very little of the members of the family itself.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* Henry Fonda \u2013 \"[[Red River Valley (song)|Red River Valley]]\" (Traditional)\n* Eddie Quillan \u2013 \"[[Going Down the Road Feeling Bad]]\" (Traditional)\n* \"[[A-Tisket, A-Tasket]]\" (Words and music by [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Van Alexander]])\n\n==Production==\n[[Executive producer]] [[Darryl F.

To that shelf of screen classics Twentieth Century-Fox yesterday added its version of John Steinbeck's ''The Grapes of Wrath'', adapted by Nunnally Johnson, directed by John Ford and performed at the Rivoli by a cast of such uniform excellence and suitability that we should be doing its other members an injustice by saying it was \"headed\" by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and Russell Simpson.<ref>Nugent, Frank S.
