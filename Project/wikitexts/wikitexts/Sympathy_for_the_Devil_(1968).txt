The dissolution of Stone [[Brian Jones (musician)|Brian Jones]] is vividly portrayed, and the chaos of 1968 is made clear when a line referring to the killing of [[John F. Kennedy]] is heard changed to the plural after the assassination of [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in June.\n\nInterwoven through the movie are outdoor shots of [[Black Panthers]] loitering in a junkyard littered with rusting cars heaped upon each other.  They read from revolutionary texts (including [[Blues People|Amiri Baraka]] and [[Eldridge Cleaver]]) and toss their rifles to each other, from man to man. A group of white women, apparently kidnapped and dressed in white, are brutalized and ultimately shot, off-camera; their bloody bodies are subsequently seen in various tableaus throughout the film.\n\nThe rest of the film contains a political message in the form of a voiceover about [[Marxism]], the need for [[revolution]] and other topics in which Godard was interested. One scene involves a camera crew following a woman about, played by [[Anne Wiazemsky]] in a yellow peasant dress, in an outdoor wildlife setting; questions are asked of her, to which she always answers either \"yes\" or \"no\". As can be seen from the chapter heading to the scene, she is supposed to be a personification of democracy, a woman named 'Eve Democracy'.\n\nAt least one quarter of the film is devoted to indoor shots of a pornographic bookstore that sells such diverse items as ''[[Doctor Strange|Marvel's Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Atom (comics)|DC's The Atom]]'', and ''[[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]'' comic books, [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] pamphlets for propaganda, and various men's magazines. Alternating with the shots of comic books, pinup magazines, and Nazi pamphlets, customers casually enter the bookstore, approach a bookshelf, pick up books or magazines, exchange them for a sheet of paper, and then slap the faces of two Maoist hostages sitting patiently next to a book display. Toward the end of the scene, a small child is admitted for the purpose of buying a pamphlet and slapping the faces of the hostages. After exchanging their purchases and receiving their document, each customer raises his or her right arm in a [[Nazi salute]], and leaves the store. The bookstore owner reads aloud from ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.\n\nMimicking the earlier scene of the camera crew following Eve Democracy is the last scene to the movie where the camera crew mills about{{Colloquialism|date=April 2021}} on the beach and from afar one man asks another \"What are they doing over there?\", to which the other answers \"I think they're shooting a movie\". A large camera crane is positioned on the beach and another woman in white is laid down upon the end of the crane and elevated, along with a motion picture camera, on the platform until she is well above the beach. She does not rise up but remains motionless, half-hanging off the crane, one leg dangling.\n\n== Production ==\nIn 1968, [[Jean-Luc Godard]] moved to London intending to make a film about abortion. When he discovered that, due to the [[1967 Abortion Act]], it was no longer a hot topic, he told his producers he would still make a film in London, but on the condition that he would work with either [[the Beatles]] or [[the Rolling Stones]]. The Beatles turned him down, but the Rolling Stones were happy to collaborate. As a result, he was able to capture their work in progress as they rehearsed and recorded material for their seventh album, ''[[Beggars Banquet]]''.<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n\nThe film was shot at the Olympic Recording Studios in London and at [[Camber Sands]]. In the original version running 104 minutes, Godard left the creation of the song unfinished.<ref name=AFI>{{cite book|title=The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films 1961-70|publisher=R. R.
