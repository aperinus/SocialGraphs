Through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, Martin is shown as a child, distrustful of his own mother. She describes to him the garden outside his bedroom window. She tells him that someone is raking leaves, but he can't hear the sound and angrily decides she is lying to him.\n\nThis childhood experience strongly affects Martin as an adult, as he anticipates that sighted people will take advantage of his blindness to lie to him, or worse yet, [[pity]] him. He has become a resentful, vaguely bitter person who spends his days taking some [[photograph]]s of the world around him, then having various people describe them. He uses these photographs and the [[Braille]] descriptions before he stamps on them as \"proof\" that the world around him really is as others describe it to him. He also takes secret pleasure in rebuking the romantic advances of Celia, his housekeeper. Celia harbours a deep-seated and obsessive crush on Martin, as evidenced by the scores of photographs of him adorning the walls of her flat, and takes out her frustration at her [[unrequited love]] by tormenting Martin in small ways, such as rearranging the furniture in his house. Martin keeps Celia around because her love and hatred of him means he knows she can't pity him.\n\nOne day Martin encounters Andy, and is pleased with the depth and detail with which Andy describes his photos. The two fast become close friends, and Martin soon comes to trust him implicitly. The jealous Celia is threatened by Andy's increasing presence in Martin's life. She [[Seduction|seduce]]s Andy, and Martin catches the two in the act, before Andy reluctantly lies to him about it. Celia recognizes this opportunity to foil Martin yet again, and sets up a series of events leading Martin to discover Andy's dishonesty. Martin is devastated and plunged into a deep despair, and breaks off his friendship with Andy. Later on, Andy confronts him, and tries to convince him that everyone has flaws, and shouldn't be judged on such simple terms. \"People lie,\" he tells Martin, \"but not all the time. And that's the point.\" Martin doesn't respond, but is swayed by Andy's impassioned words. Near the story's conclusion, Martin decides to fire Celia, but acknowledges his own role in purposely antagonizing her in their [[Love\u2013hate relationship|love-hate relationship]]. Despite his openness she is extremely angry that her efforts have gone to waste, and when asked to return her key to Martin's house, she throws it in a sink full of water.\n\nFinally, Martin asks Andy to describe one last photo for him, one he has kept locked away for years. Martin had previously told Andy that this was the first and most important photo he had ever taken. It is a photo of the garden from Martin's childhood, taken moments after his mother described it on that fateful day. However, Andy's detailed description includes the iconic man raking leaves Martin's mother told him about, that he had rejected for all these years. This revelation provides Martin with his proof and emotional release.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as Martin\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Picot]] as Celia\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Andy\n* [[Heather Mitchell]] as Martin's mother\n* [[Jeffrey Walker (actor)|Jeffrey Walker]] as Young Martin\n* [[Daniel Pollock]] as Punk\n* [[Frankie J.
