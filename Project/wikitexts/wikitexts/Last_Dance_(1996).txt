[[Clemency]] lawyer Rick Hayes ([[Rob Morrow]]) tries to save her, based on the argument that she was under the influence of [[crack cocaine]] when she committed the crime of which she was found guilty and that she is no longer the same person she had been at the time of the murder. However, her [[death sentence]] is carried out. The films ends with Rick on a trip to [[India]] after Cindy\u2019s execution.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Cindy Liggett\n* [[Rob Morrow]] as Rick Hayes\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Sam Burns\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as John Hayes\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as The Governor\n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Jill\n* Pamala Tyson as Linda, Legal Aid Attorney\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as Billy Liggett\n* [[Don Patrick Harvey|Don Harvey]] as Doug\n* Diane Sellers as Inmate Reggie\n* [[Patricia French]] as Guard Frances\n* [[Ralph Wilcox (Actor)|Ralph Wilcox]] as Warden Rice\n* Buck Ford as District Attorney Rusk\n* Dave Hager as Detective Vollo\n* Christine Cattell as Louise\n* Peg Allen as Helen\n* [[Charles S.

However, he pointed out that the film suffered from the \"inescapable misfortune\" of being following too soon after the \"unquestioned masterpiece\" of ''Dead Man Walking''.
