''Radioland Murders'' is set in the 1939 atmosphere of [[old-time radio]] and pays [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the [[screwball comedy film]]s of the 1930s. The film tells the story of writer Roger Henderson trying to settle relationship issues with his wife Penny while dealing with a [[whodunit]] murder mystery in a radio station. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Brian Benben]], [[Mary Stuart Masterson]], [[Scott Michael Campbell]], [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]], and [[Ned Beatty]]. ''Radioland Murders'' also features numerous small roles and [[cameo appearance]]s, including [[Michael McKean]], [[Bobcat Goldthwait]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[George Burns]] (in his final film appearance), [[Billy Barty]], and [[Rosemary Clooney]].\n\nGeorge Lucas began development for the film in the 1970s, originally attached as director for [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]]'s script, from a story by Lucas. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] commenced [[pre-production]] and both [[Steve Martin]] and [[Cindy Williams]] had already been approached for the two leads before ''Radioland Murders'' languished in [[development hell]] for over 20 years. In 1993, Lucas told Universal that advances in [[computer-generated imagery]] from [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (owned by [[Lucasfilm]]), particularly in digital mattes, would help bring ''Radioland Murders'' in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million. Mel Smith was hired to direct and filming lasted from October to December 1993. ''Radioland Murders'' was released on October 21, 1994, to negative reviews from critics and [[box office bomb|bombed at the box office]], only grossing $1.37 million in the U.S.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1939, a new [[radio network]] based at station WBN in [[Chicago]], Illinois, begins its inaugural night. The station's owner, [[General officer|General]] Walt Whalen, depends on his employees to impress main sponsor Bernie King. This includes writer Roger Henderson, assistant director Penny Henderson (Roger's wife, seeking divorce), [[page (occupation)|page]] boy Billy Budget, engineer Max Applewhite, [[conducting|conductor]] Rick Rochester, announcer Dexter Morris, director Walt Whalen, Jr. and stage manager Herman Katzenback. After King commissions rewrites on the radio scripts, the WBN writers get angry, complaining that they have not been paid in weeks.\n\nWhen trumpet player Ruffles Reedy falls dead from [[rodenticide|rat poison]]ing, a series of events ensue. Director Walt Jr. is hanged (the mysterious killer makes it look like a suicide), and his father, the General, has the [[Chicago Police Department]] (CPD) get involved to solve the murder mysteries as the nightly radio performance continues. Katzenback is then killed after attempting to fix the main stage when the machinery malfunctions. Penny is appointed both stage manager and director due to Walt Jr. and Katzenback's deaths. Roger tries to solve the killings, greatly annoying the police, led by Lieutenant Cross.\n\nBecause Roger unfortunately appears at every crime scene just as the murders take place, he is ruled as the prime suspect. Roger and Billy Budget then theorize that announcer Dexter Morris is the next to die. Dexter ignores their warning and is fatally electrocuted. By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger finds that the victims all previously worked together at a radio station in [[Peoria, Illinois]], which he then correlates into a secretive [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] scandal. King (laughing gas) and General Whalen (falls down an elevator shaft) are the next to die after Roger's warning, making the police even more suspicious.\n\nAfter escaping from custody, Roger uses Billy to communicate and send scripts to Penny. When rewriting one of the programs, ''Gork: Son of Fire'', Roger attempts to write the script with [[self-reference|self-referential]] events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually sound engineer Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing his invention of television, which other scientists have copied. Max takes Roger and Penny atop the radio tower at gunpoint, but is eventually killed when a [[biplane]] shows up and guns him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, the sponsors decide to fund WBN. Roger and Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brian Benben]] as Roger Henderson, Ecstatic writer of WBN and husband to Penny. Much to the consternation of the police force, Roger solves the murder mystery.\n*[[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Penny Henderson: Stressed WBN secretary who is promoted to both director and stage manager after the deaths of Walt Jr. and Herman Katzenback. She initially intends to divorce Roger after mistakenly believing he was having an affair with Claudette Katzenback, but they later reconcile their relationship.\n* [[Scott Michael Campbell]] as Billy Budget, WBN page boy who is used by Roger to communicate with Penny and send scripts, despite the fact that he is trying to hide from the police.\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Lieutenant Cross, Short-tempered policeman who has a vendetta against Roger.\n*[[Ned Beatty]] as General Walt Whalen: Owner of WBN who commands his staff with a military-like work environment. The General dies after falling down an elevator shaft.\n* [[Brion James]] as Bernie King, WBN's main sponsor who has no sense of humor. King eventually dies from laughing gas.\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Max Applewhite, WBN's sound engineer who is found to be responsible for the murders. Max dies after getting shot atop the radio tower.\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Rick Rochester, WBN band conductor who despises Dexter (McKean also appeared as Benben's boss in ''Dream On'').\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Dexter Morris, The station's announcer who has a smoking habit. Dexter dies of electrocution, ignoring Roger and Billy's warning.\n* [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] as Wild Writer, Violent and melancholic WBN writer.\n* [[Anita Morris]] as Claudette Katzenback, Famous singer and Herman's wife. Penny catches her with Roger, presumably having sex, but this appears to have been a prank Claudette created. Roger originally believes she was responsible for killings. This was Anita Morris' final acting role, as she died seven months before the film's release.\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Walt Whalen Jr., The General's [[toup\u00e9e]]-wearing son and show director.\n*[[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Herman Katzenback: German stage manager of WBN. Herman is the third to die and is aware of Claudette's multiple affairs with other employees.\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Zoltan, Eccentric [[sound design]]er.\n*[[Harvey Korman]] as Jules Cogley: Alcoholic writer who confirms that Ruffles' death came from poisoning.\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Detective Jasper, Cross' idiot assistant.\n* [[Jack Sheldon]] as \"Ruffles\" Reedy, Drunk trumpet player of Rochester's band. He is the first to die.\n* [[Jim David]] as a Radio Actor, playing a Jungle Native and a Rocket Scientist\n\n[[Cameo appearance]]s are provided by [[George Burns]] (in his final feature film, as Milt Lackey, a 100-year-old comedian), [[Joey Lawrence]], [[Billy Barty]], [[Peter MacNicol]], [[Robert Klein]], [[Ellen Albertini Dow]], [[Candy Clark]], [[Bo Hopkins]] (as Billy Budget's parents) and Wilbur Fitzgerald, as well as singers [[Rosemary Clooney]] and [[Tracy Byrd]].\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe genesis of ''Radioland Murders'' came from [[executive producer]]/co-writer [[George Lucas]]'s obsession with [[old-time radio]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Bernard Weinraub | author-link = Bernard Weinraub | title = The Ultimate Hollywoodian Lives an Anti-Hollywood Life | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/20/movies/the-ultimate-hollywoodian-lives-an-anti-hollywood-life.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1994-10-20 | access-date = 2009-03-21}}</ref> Lucas conceived the storyline of the film during the writing phase of ''[[American Graffiti]]'', viewing it as a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the various [[Abbott and Costello]] films, primarily ''[[Who Done It? (1942 film)|Who Done It]]'' (1942), in which Abbott and Costello star as two [[soda jerk]]s solving a murder in a radio station. ''Radioland Murders'' also shares some inspiration from ''[[The Big Clock (film)|The Big Clock]]'' (1948). When [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] accepted ''American Graffiti'' in 1972, Lucas also allowed the studio [[first-look deal]]s for both ''Radioland Murders'' and an untitled science fiction film (which eventually became the basis for ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'').<ref name=Baxterf>{{cite book | author = John Baxter | title = Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas | pages = [https://archive.org/details/mythmakerlifewor00baxt/page/107 107, 122, 253] | publisher = [[Avon (publishers)|Avon]] | date = October 1999 | isbn = 0-380-97833-4 | location = New York City | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/mythmakerlifewor00baxt/page/107 }}</ref>\n\nLucas eventually negotiated a deal to produce ''Radioland Murders'' for Universal shortly after the successful release of ''American Graffiti'' in late 1973. [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]] prepared a rough draft based on Lucas's 1974 [[film treatment]], and Universal was confident enough to announce [[pre-production]] soon after. Lucas was set to direct with [[Gary Kurtz]] producing. In the original Huyck/Katz script, Roger and Penny were not a married couple seeking divorce, but were boyfriend and girlfriend with a [[love-hate relationship]].<ref name=first/> Their script also included the controversy over the [[invention of radio]].<ref name=BaxterS/>\n\nIn July 1978, Lucas revealed that ''Radioland Murders'' was still in development, and that both [[Steve Martin]] and [[Cindy Williams]] were approached for the two leads. The script was being rewritten and the planned [[start date]] was early 1979. However, throughout the 1970s to early 1990s, ''Radioland Murders'' remained in [[development hell]].<ref name=first>{{cite book | author= Marcus Hearn | title = The Cinema of George Lucas | publisher =[[Harry N.
