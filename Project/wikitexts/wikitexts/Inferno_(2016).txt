It is the sequel to ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' (2006) and ''[[Angels & Demons (film)|Angels & Demons]]'' (2009), and is the third and final film in the [[Robert Langdon (film series)|''Robert Langdon'' film series]]. It stars [[Tom Hanks]], reprising his role as [[Robert Langdon]], alongside [[Felicity Jones]] as Dr. Sienna Brooks, [[Omar Sy]], [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]], [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]], and [[Irrfan Khan]].\n\nFilming began on April 27, 2015, in [[Venice]], Italy, and wrapped on July 21, 2015, in [[Budapest]]. The film premiered in [[Florence]] on October 9, 2016, and was released in the [[United States]] on October 28, 2016, ten years after release of ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'', in 2D and IMAX formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/movies/inferno|title=Inferno|website=www.imax.com}}</ref> The film received very negative reviews from critics, but grossed $220 million against a production budget of $75 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/inferno-2016-box-office-success-bomb/|title=Was Inferno a Box Office Success?|date=2016-11-17|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n==Plot==\nSome time after [[Angels & Demons (film)|helping the Vatican dealing with an antimatter threat]], [[Harvard University]] professor Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital room in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. He has no memory of the last few days, but is plagued with hellish visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks, the doctor tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia as a result of a bullet wound to the head. An orderly says the police are there to question Langdon but the officer turns out to be Vayentha, an assassin, who shoots the orderly while coming up the hallway. Brooks helps Langdon to escape, and they flee to her apartment.\n\nAmong Langdon's personal belongings, Langdon and Brooks find a [[Mechanically powered flashlight#Shake type design|Faraday pointer]], a miniature image projector with a modified version of [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''[[Map of Hell]]'', which itself is based on [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']]. They soon realize this is the first clue in a trail left by Bertrand Zobrist, a dangerously unstable villain who believed that rigorous measures were necessary to reduce the Earth's [[population growth|growing population]], and who committed suicide three days earlier after being chased by armed government agents.\n\nLangdon and Brooks figure out that Zobrist, who was obsessed with [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], has created a biological [[superweapon]] he has dubbed \"Inferno\", with the potential of annihilating half the world's population. In the meantime, they have been traced by both Vayentha and government agents, who try to raid the apartment, forcing them to flee again. The government agents are headed by Elizabeth Sinskey, an old lover of Langdon's. Vayentha reports to her employer Harry Sims, the CEO of a private security company called \"The Consortium\", who is acting on behalf of Zobrist, who gives her instructions to kill Langdon as he had become a liability.\n\nLangdon's knowledge of Dante's work and history, and of hidden passages in Florence, allows the two to follow clues such as letters and phrases which lead to various locations in Florence and [[Venice]], while inadvertently killing Vayentha and evading the agents. Along the way, Langdon discovers that he helped a friend of his steal and hide the Dante [[death mask]], a crucial clue, an event he also does not remember. Zobrist had provided Sims with a video message about the attack, to be broadcast after it has been released. Shocked by its content, Sims allies with Sinskey to prevent the outbreak. However, Langdon and Brooks are contacted by Christoph Bouchard, a man purporting to be working for the government, warning them that Sinskey is a double agent and is after the Inferno for her own profit. The three cooperate for a while, until Langdon realizes that Bouchard is lying and seeking to profit from Inferno himself, forcing the duo to flee on their own again.\n\nLangdon figures out that the attack is in the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]]. With that knowledge, Brooks abandons Langdon, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and that she will ensure the release of the weapon. Zobrist and Brooks used to play [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunt]] games; this trail was the backup plan in case something happened to Zobrist. Langdon is recaptured by Bouchard, but Sims kills Bouchard and rescues Langdon, who then re-teams with Sinskey, who asked him for help in interpreting the imagery from the Faraday pointer. Sims reveals he was hired by Brooks to kidnap Langdon when Zobrist had been killed, and drugged with [[benzodiazepine]] to induce a memory loss; the events in the hospital were all staged.\n\nThey deduce the weapon is in a plastic bag hidden under water in the [[Basilica Cistern]] in Istanbul. The agents team &ndash; joined by Langdon, Sims, and Sinskey &ndash; race to locate and secure the bag, while Brooks and fellow Zobrist disciples attempt to detonate an explosive to rupture the bag and [[aerosolization|aerosolize]] the weapon. Sims incapacitates a disciple and kills another, but is fatally stabbed by Brooks who, refusing Langdon's pleas, releases the weapon by [[suicide bombing|manually triggering]] an underwater blast. The detonation ruptures the bag, which however is trapped by Sinskey in a special containment unit. After struggling against Sinskey and Langdon to open the container, Brooks' last ally is killed by special units. The weapon is secured for analysis, while Langdon and Sinskey ruminate on the idealism of youth and the future of humanity. Langdon returns to Florence and covertly returns the Dante Death Mask.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Professor [[Robert Langdon]], a professor of symbology at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"DeadlineHanks\" /> \n* [[Felicity Jones]] as Dr. Sienna Brooks, a doctor who helps Langdon escape.<ref name=\"ConfirmedCast\" />\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Christophe Bouchard, head of the SRS team (Surveillance and Response Support), of the [[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]].<ref name=\"ConfirmedCast\" />\n* [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as Bertrand Zobrist, a billionaire and [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] scientist, intent on solving the world's overpopulation problem.<ref name=\"FosterCast\" /><ref name=\"FullCast\">{{cite web|title='Da Vinci Code' Sequel 'Inferno' Starring Tom Hanks Starts Filming In Italy: See Behind-The-Scenes PHOTOS|url=http://www.fashionnstyle.com/articles/62998/20150529/da-vinci-code-sequel-inferno-starring-tom-hanks-starts-filming-in-italy-see-behind-the-scenes-photos.htm|website=Fashion & Style|access-date=June 7, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716053416/http://www.fashionnstyle.com/articles/62998/20150529/da-vinci-code-sequel-inferno-starring-tom-hanks-starts-filming-in-italy-see-behind-the-scenes-photos.htm|archive-date=July 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] as Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey, head of the [[World Health Organization]].<ref name=\"ConfirmedCast\" />\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as Harry \"The Provost\" Sims, head of The Consortium, helping Zobrist in his mission.<ref name=\"ConfirmedCast\" />\n* [[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]] as CRC Tech Arbogast, right-hand man to Sims.\n* [[Ana Ularu]] as Vayentha, The Consortium's agent in Florence who has orders to follow Langdon.<ref name=\"FullCast\"/>\n\n==Production==\nOn July 16, 2013, [[Columbia Pictures]] set [[Ron Howard]] to direct [[Dan Brown]]'s fourth novel in the Robert Langdon series, ''[[Inferno (Brown novel)|Inferno]]'', with [[David Koepp]] writing the script.<ref name=SonyReleaseDate>{{cite news|last1=Kilday|first1=Gregg|title=Sony Sets Release Date for Film Adaptation of Dan Brown's 'Inferno'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sony-sets-release-date-film-586188|access-date=May 4, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 16, 2013}}</ref> [[Imagine Entertainment]] was set to produce the film, while [[Tom Hanks]] was again set to reprise his role as Robert Langdon.<ref name=\"SonyReleaseDate\" /> On August 26, 2014, Sony had finalized the deal with Howard and Hanks, and set the film for April start of production in Italy.<ref name=DeadlineHanks>{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike Jr.|title=Sony Pictures Locks Tom Hanks, Ron Howard For April \u2018Inferno\u2019 Start|url=https://deadline.com/2014/08/sony-pictures-locks-tom-hanks-ron-howard-for-april-inferno-start-825270/|access-date=May 4, 2015|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=August 26, 2014}}</ref> [[Brian Grazer]] was also set to produce the film with Howard.<ref name=\"DeadlineHanks\" />\n\nOn December 2, [[Felicity Jones]] was in early talks to join the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jaafar|first1=Ali|title=Felicity Jones In Early Talks To Join \u2018Inferno\u2019 With Tom Hanks|url=https://deadline.com/2014/12/felicity-jones-in-early-talks-to-join-tom-hanks-in-inferno-1201306020/|access-date=December 7, 2014|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 2, 2014}}</ref> On February 17, 2015, studio revealed the confirmed cast for the film, including Jones as Dr. Sienna Brooks, [[Omar Sy]] as Christoph Bruder, [[Irrfan Khan]] as Harry \"The Provost\" Sims, and [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] as Elizabeth Sinskey, head of the World Health Organization.<ref name=ConfirmedCast>{{cite news|last1=Hipes|first1=Patrick|title=Robert Langdon Pic \u2018Inferno\u2019 Adds Omar Sy & More As Cast Goes Global|url=https://deadline.com/2015/02/inferno-movie-omar-sy-irrfan-khan-sidse-babett-knudsen-dan-brown-1201375352/|access-date=February 18, 2015|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=February 17, 2015}}</ref> [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] was set for an unspecified villainous role on March 10, 2015, which later revealed to be the role of Bertrand Zobrist.<ref name=FosterCast>{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|title=Ben Foster Joining Tom Hanks in 'Inferno' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ben-foster-joining-tom-hanks-780379|access-date=May 4, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on April 27, 2015, in Venice, Italy,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lesnick|first1=Silas|title=Production Begins on Ron Howard's Da Vinci Code Sequel, Inferno|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/434441-production-begins-on-ron-howards-da-vinci-code-sequel-inferno|access-date=April 28, 2015|work=ComingSoon.net|date=April 27, 2015}}</ref> and continued in Florence, Italy, starting at the end of April.
