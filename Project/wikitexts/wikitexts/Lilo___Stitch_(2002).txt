It features [[Daveigh Chase]] and Sanders as the voices of the [[title character]]s, and also features the voices of [[Tia Carrere]], [[David Ogden Stiers]], [[Kevin McDonald]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[Jason Scott Lee]], and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. It was also the second of three Disney animated feature films (the first being ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', followed by ''[[Brother Bear]]'') that were produced primarily at the Florida animation studio in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (then named \"Disney-MGM Studios\" during its production) at [[Walt Disney World]] near [[Orlando, Florida]].<ref name=\"DisneyWar-Lilo\">{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=James B. |title=DisneyWar |date=2005 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780743283908 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0/page/472 472]\u2013473 |language=en |quote=Weeks later, on January 12, Disney announced that it was shutting down its Orlando animation unit, where ''Lilo & Stitch'' had been created.|url=https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0|url-access=registration }}</ref> ''Lilo & Stitch'' was Sanders' first lead role, and Lee's last [[wide release|widely released]] film [[Balls of Fury|until 2007]].\n\nThe film's story revolves around two [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] and [[mischief|mischievous]] individuals: a six (later seven)-year-old<!--Lilo's age was indirectly confirmed in the ending montage, with celebrating her seventh birthday.--> Hawaiian girl named [[Lilo Pelekai]], who is raised by her older, young adult-aged<!--Do not specify an age unless you have a reliable source; Nani's exact age was never specified in the film.--> sister [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Nani Pelekai|Nani]] after their parents died in a car accident, and a blue [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial koala-like creature]] called [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|Experiment 626]], who is adopted by Lilo as her \"dog\" and renamed \"Stitch\". Stitch, who is genetically engineered by his [[mad scientist]] creator to cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid being captured by an intergalactic federation, but the two individuals develop a close bond through the Hawaiian concept of [[Ohana|''{{okina}}ohana'']], or [[extended family]]. This bond causes Stitch to reconsider and later defy his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his family together.\n\nThe film is based on an idea by Sanders, who originally conceived the character Stitch in the 1980s, and the film's design and aesthetics are based on his own personal art style. The film premiered on June 16, 2002, and was officially released worldwide on June 21, 2002, to positive reviews, with critics praising its humor, charm, and originality. Produced on an $80 million budget and promoted with a marketing campaign that played up its oddities, it was a box office success grossing over $273 million dollars worldwide. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] at the [[75th Academy Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 75th Academy Awards {{!}} 2003|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Shamsian|first=Jacob|title=Every animated movie that's won an Oscar|url=https://www.insider.com/oscars-winning-animated-movies-2018-1|date=March 29, 2022|access-date=August 11, 2022|website=[[Business Insider]]|language=en-US}}</ref> The film's combined critical and commercial success made it one of Disney Animation's few great successes during their post-[[Disney Renaissance|Renaissance]] era in the 2000s, spawning a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|franchise]] that includes three [[direct-to-video]] sequels, starting with ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'', and three television series, including the sequel series ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' and spin-offs ''[[Stitch!]]''  and ''[[Stitch & Ai]]''. A live-action adaptation is reportedly in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:MOSFILM, plot summaries should be in the range of 400-700 words. Please do not add more detail, but adjust what is already present. -->\nThe Galactic Federation arrests Dr. Jumba Jookiba for illegal genetic experimentation, having created [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|Experiment 626]]. Before the experiment's sentencing and punishment, Experiment 626 escapes and crash lands on [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i, Hawaii]]. To capture him, the Federation assigns  Agent Wendy Pleakley, the council's Earth expert, to capture the experiment, with Jumba helping in exchange for his release from prison.\n\nOn the island, Nani Pelekai struggles to take care of her rambunctious but lonely younger sister Lilo, after their parents died in a car crash. Social worker Cobra Bubbles expresses concern about whether or not Nani can take adequate care of Lilo. Since Lilo's hula classmates have ostracized her, Nani decides to let her adopt a dog. At the animal shelter, Lilo takes interest in 626, impersonating a dog to avoid Jumba and Pleakley, who have already landed on Earth. Despite Nani's doubts, Lilo adopts and renames 626 \"Stitch\". That evening, at the restaurant where Nani works, Jumba and Pleakley unsuccessfully attempt to capture Stitch while in disguise. The owner blames the ensuing destructive chaos on Stitch and fires Nani. The next day, Cobra Bubbles warns Nani that he will have to place Lilo with a foster family if she doesn't find another job. However, Stitch's antics while evading his two pursuers persistently ruin Nani's chances of finding work.\n\nNani's friend David Kawena invites her, Lilo, and Stitch to enjoy a day of surfing and beach fun. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch ride a huge wave, Jumba and Pleakley try to capture Stitch, causing Stitch to unintentionally pull Lilo underwater. They survive, but Cobra witnesses this event and tells Nani that, although she means well, it means that Lilo will have to be taken away if Nani doesn't find another job. Feeling guilty over how much trouble he has caused, Stitch runs off into the night. The next morning, the Grand Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley and gives the assignment to Captain Gantu, incidentally freeing them both to pursue Stitch using less covert methods. Meanwhile, David informs Nani of a job opportunity, which she  rushes off to pursue. Stitch, hiding in the nearby woods, encounters Jumba and Pleakly, who chase him back to Nani's house. A fight ensues, throwing the house into chaos and causing an explosion that damages it. Nani sees the chaos and rushes back home to see Cobra arrive to collect Lilo and take her away.\n\nAs Nani and Cobra get into a falling out, Lilo runs away into the woods and finds Stitch, who, in shame, reveals his alien identity before they are captured by Gantu. Stitch manages to escape from Gantu's ship but fails to rescue Lilo. Nani confronts him, having witnessed Lilo's kidnapping. Before he can explain, Jumba and Pleakley capture Stitch themselves. Nani demands that they help her rescue Lilo, but Jumba and Pleakley insist they only came for Stitch. When Nani breaks down, Stitch reminds her about {{okina}}[[ohana]], a term for \"family\" he learned from her. Stitch convinces Jumba to help rescue Lilo. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani board Jumba's personal spaceship and chase after Gantu, rescuing Lilo. \n\nBack on the shore, the Grand Councilwoman arrives on Earth preparing to take Stitch into custody, along with Cobra, who catches up to take Lilo away. She fires Gantu for his failure to capture Stitch, and for putting Lilo in danger, and blames Jumba for the mess. Before Stitch goes into the spaceship, he asks the Councilwoman to say goodbye to his new family. Lilo then insists that, because she paid for Stitch at the shelter and has a stamped receipt to show for it, Stitch is her pet under local law, and if the Councilwoman took him away, it would be tantamount to stealing. Impressed with Stitch's newfound civility and empathy, the Councilwoman decrees that Stitch will live in exile on Earth, entrusted to Lilo and Nani's care, and that the family will be under the care of the Galactic Federation & Cobra, who was a former CIA agent who knew the Councilwoman during the Roswell incident. Lilo, Nani, and their newfound friends rebuild their house, and Jumba and Pleakley become members of Nani, Lilo, and Stitch's family.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Lilo & Stitch characters}}\n* [[Daveigh Chase]] as [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Lilo Pelekai|Lilo Pelekai]], an [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] young Hawaiian girl on the island of [[Kaua'i]] who adopts Stitch as her pet [[dog]].

[[Chris Sanders]], a head [[storyboard artist]] at Disney Feature Animation, was approached to pitch an idea. Sanders had created the character of Stitch in 1985 for an unsuccessful children's book pitch and had to now develop a concept that featured the character in an animated film.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The storyline required a remote, non-urban location, so the movie was originally intended to take place in [[Kansas]].<ref name=\"DavisHanaHou\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.hanahou.com/pages/magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&ArticleID=389&MagazineID=24 |title=Disney Goes Hawaiian |first=Pat |last=Davis |journal=[[Hana Hou!]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=April\u2013May 2002}}</ref> Sanders's decision to change the film's setting to the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] was an important choice in defining the plot more clearly. No other animated feature had ever taken place on any of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian islands]] before.<ref name=\"DavisHanaHou\"/> In Sanders's words:\n\n{{quote|Animation has been set so much in ancient, medieval Europe&nbsp;\u2014 so many [[fairy tale]]s find their roots there, that to place it in Hawai{{okina}}i was kind of a big leap. But that choice went to color the entire movie, and rewrite the story for us.}}\n\n===Writing===\n[[Dean DeBlois]], who had served as \"story co-head\" in ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998), was brought on to co-write and co-direct ''Lilo & Stitch'', while Disney executive Clark Spencer was assigned to produce. Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions, the film's pre-production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production.<ref name=\"RM\">{{Cite news|last=Moore |first=Roger |title=Lilo & Stitch, Disney Feature Animation Florida's finest hour--remembered (originally published as \"For Disney's Orlando animators, it's show time!\" on 2002-06-16) |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |location=[[Orlando, Florida]] |publisher=[[Tribune Media]] |date=2009-04-01 |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024025330/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |archive-date=2012-10-24}}</ref> The character and set designs were based upon Sanders's personal artistic style.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nWhile the animation team visited [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] to research the locale, their tour guide explained the meaning of ''[[ohana|{{okina}}ohana]]'' as it applies to [[Extended family|extended families]].

The Disney animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film's plot, which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then-recent [[Recession|economic downturn]], with the island's serene beauty. The actors voicing the film's young adults, Nani and David, were [[Tia Carrere]], a local of [[Honolulu]], and [[Jason Scott Lee]], who is of Hawaiian descent and was raised in Hawaii. The voice actors assisted with rewriting the Hawaiian characters' dialogue in the proper [[Colloquialism|colloquial dialect]], and also with the task of adding Hawaiian slang terms.<ref name=\"Carrere interview 2022\">{{cite web|last=El-Mahmoud|first=Sarah|title=Lilo & Stitch 20 Years Later: How The Disney Film Authentically Captured Hawaiian Culture With Tia Carrere\u2019s Help|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/interviews/lilo-and-stitch-20-years-later-how-the-disney-film-authentically-captured-hawaiian-culture-with-tia-carreres-help|website=[[CinemaBlend]]|access-date=2022-05-02|date=2022-04-21|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOne innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters: Lilo and Nani.

Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for ''Lilo & Stitch'' to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of ''Dumbo'', requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nThe animation itself was all based on 2D work as the budget lacked funds to incorporate [[computer generated imagery]].<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/22675483/lilo-and-stitch-disney-animation-chris-sanders-dean-deblois | title = \u2018We\u2019re going to hide it\u2019: How Lilo & Stitch succeeded by staying off Disney\u2019s radar | first =  Petrana | last =  Radulovic | date = September 16, 2021 | access-date = September 16, 2021 | work  =[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> The character designs were based around Sanders's personal drawing style, eschewing the traditional Disney house style.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> Because of the limited budget, details like pockets or designs on clothing were avoided in the animation process, and as they could not afford to do shadows throughout much of the film, many of the scenes took place in shaded areas, saving the use of shadows for more pivotal scenes.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nThe film's extraterrestrial elements, such as the spaceships, were designed to resemble marine life, such as whales and crabs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elemental Magic: The Art of Special Effects Animation |url=https://archive.org/details/elementalmagicar00gill_285 |url-access=limited |first1=Joseph |last1=Gilland |year=2009 |publisher=Focal Press (Elsevier, Inc.) |isbn=978-0-240-81163-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/elementalmagicar00gill_285/page/n282 256] }}</ref> One planned scene in the film involved Stitch hijacking a [[Boeing 747]] airliner and piloting it in a cartoonish manner through a city. However, following the [[September 11 attacks]] with only a few weeks left in production, this scene was revamped at a large cost to have Stitch steal Jumba and Pleakley's alien craft instead, revamping the airliner's design to look like an alien spacecraft, though the final design still has engines that resembled the 747's jet engines, according to Sanders.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nEven after this adjustment, the team had enough budget for about two additional minutes of animation, which was used to create the epilogue montage of Lilo, Nani, and Stitch becoming a new family.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nTeaser [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for the film parody trailers for other [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films|Disney films]] (three of which Sanders previously worked on) from the [[Disney Renaissance]]: ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''  and ''[[The Lion King]]''. These are called \"Inter-Stitch-als\" and are featured on Disney's official site as well as on the film's respective DVD release. The original actors were brought back to reprise their roles and were shocked when asked to act negatively towards Stitch. The trailers also include the [[AC/DC]] song track \"[[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]].\" In the United Kingdom, ''Lilo & Stitch'' trailers and TV ads featured a cover of Elvis' song \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", performed by [[Gareth Gates]], who became famous on the UK TV program ''[[Pop Idol]]''. In the US, \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" was used for both theatrical and TV trailers. The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of \"Disney Family [[Black sheep|Black Sheep]]\". As a promotional campaign, comics of ''Lilo & Stitch'' were run in ''[[Disney Adventures]] ''prior to the film's release. The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters, including the creation and escape of Stitch. These events were later contradicted by the sequel ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', rendering the comics non-canonical, but is notable to the series as introducing Experiment 625, [[Reuben (Lilo & Stitch)|Reuben]], who was made a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series. Most of the comic series have been released as a collective volume titled ''Comic Zone Volume 1: Lilo & Stitch''.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nSeveral major elements of the film changed during production. Originally, [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|Stitch]] was the leader of an intergalactic gang, and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> Test audience response to early versions of the film resulted in the change of Stitch and Jumba's relationship to that of creation and creator, respectively.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nThe biggest change came to the film's third act, which had Stitch, Nani, Jumba, and Pleakley [[aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] a [[Boeing 747]] jet from [[Lihue Airport]] to save Lilo; the scene had the quartet chasing Gantu through downtown Honolulu, scraping against buildings and coming dangerously close to the ground. After the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] occurred on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001, the film's climax was completely reworked so that they instead flew Jumba's spaceship through the mountains of Kaua{{okina}}i.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/lilo-stitch-9-11-edit/|title=See How 9/11 Caused a Dramatic Change to the Ending of Lilo & Stitch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/lilo-and-stitch-airplane-scene-before-and-after-9-11-disney-2017-9|title=Disney's 'Lilo and Stitch' originally included an airplane crash scene that was cut after 9/11}}</ref> This revision was done primarily by replacing the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model of the 747 with that of Jumba's spaceship, with only a few shots in the sequence fully re-animated.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n[[File:Lilo and Stitch Deleted Scene.png|thumb|254x254px|The original scene (top) and the one used in the release (bottom). The [[Boeing 747]] and the spaceship are both flying in a sideways position.]]\nAnother scene that was deleted was one of Lilo's attempts to make Stitch into a model citizen by notifying tourists on the beach about the [[tsunami]] warning sirens, which she knows are being tested that day. The original version of Jumba attacking Stitch in Lilo's home was found to be too violent by test audiences and was revised to make it more comedic. There was also a scene in which Lilo introduces Stitch to Pudge the fish, which ultimately leads to the fish's death. Lilo then takes Pudge's body to the same graveyard where her parents were buried, and thus Stitch learns the consequences of his actions and gains a better understanding of mortality.\n\nA scene was removed where Nani brings Lilo pizza and then Lilo tells herself a bedtime story about a friendly and stinky bear named Toaster. It was replaced with the scene where Lilo and Nani talk about being family because test audiences had mistaken Nani for Lilo's mother. The trial scene originally had Stitch as the defendant, and Jumba is not present. This was changed because the film directors thought the Intergalactic Council had to blame him for creating Stitch.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' opened in second place with $35.3 million in its first weekend, less than $500,000 behind ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jun-24-et-natale24-story.html|title=\u2018Lilo,\u2019 \u2018Minority Report\u2019 Tussling Over Top Spot}}</ref> In its second week, it fell to third, again behind the [[Steven Spielberg]] film coming in second after ''[[Mr. Deeds]]''.

The Movie]]'', which served as the pilot to a television series titled ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. This series ran for 65 episodes between September 20, 2003, and July 29, 2006. The series carried on where the film left off and charted Lilo and Stitch's efforts to capture and rehabilitate [[List of Lilo & Stitch characters#Jumba's genetic experiments (Stitch's cousins)|Jumba's remaining experiments]]. The series, as well as the original parts of the franchise that focused on Lilo Pelekai and were set in Hawaii, ended with the television film ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', which aired on June 23, 2006.\n\nOn August 30, 2005, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', another direct-to-video sequel to the film, was released. In this film ([[Sequel#Interquel|set between]] ''Lilo & Stitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''), Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is contrary to an alternate opening, \"Stitch's trial\", which was seen on the DVD release of ''Lilo & Stitch''). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have outbursts. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as his glitch causes more problems for her and ruins her chances of winning the competition. She thinks Stitch is not cooperating properly, until she finds out that Stitch is dying. The ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch'' DVD also contained a short film, ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', that served as a bridge between ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''.\n\nIn March 2008, Disney announced an [[anime]] based on the ''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise aimed at the Japanese market titled ''[[Stitch!]]''. The anime, which ran as a series from October 2008 to March 2011, features a Japanese girl named Yuna Kamihara in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in [[Okinawa Prefecture]] instead of Hawaii. This series was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season and two post-series specials in 2012 and 2015.\n\nFrom March 27 to April 6, 2017, an English-language Chinese animated television series based on the franchise titled ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'' aired in China with a Mandarin Chinese dub. It was produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media. Like with the ''Stitch!'' anime, it features a local girl named Wang Ai Ling instead of Lilo, and is set in the [[Huangshan]] mountains. Unlike ''Stitch!'', however, this series was originally produced in English in co-operation with American animators (including those who worked on ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'') and then dubbed into Mandarin Chinese; the original English production aired in Southeast Asia during February 2018.\n\n===Live-action adaptation===\nOn October 3, 2018, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Walt Disney Pictures]] is developing a live-action remake of ''Lilo & Stitch''.

Stitch is also a summonable character in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III|III]]'', and appears along with his homeworld in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. Lilo and Stitch both appear in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Disney Magical World]]'' and [[Disney Magical World 2|its sequel]]. Stitch is also a playable character in the [[Disney Infinity (series)|''Disney Infinity'' series]] in the second game, ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]'', and the series' third and final game, ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''. He was also a meet and greet character in ''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''. Some characters of the film are playable characters in the game ''[[Disney Magic Kingdoms]]''.
