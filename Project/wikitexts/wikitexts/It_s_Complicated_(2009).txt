In addition, the film was nominated at both the [[Critics' Choice Awards]] and the [[Satellite Awards]] and garnered Meyers two [[Golden Globe]] nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. Streep and Baldwin each were individually recognized with [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actor]] nominations at the Golden Globe and [[BAFTA Awards|BAFTA]] award ceremonies, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nJane, who owns a successful bakery in [[Santa Barbara, California]], and Jake Adler, a successful [[Attorney at law|attorney]], divorced ten years earlier. They had three children together, two daughters and a son, who are grown. Jake has married the much younger Agness, the woman he cheated on Jane with.\n\nJane and Jake attend their son Luke's graduation from college in [[New York City]]. After a dinner together, the two begin an affair, which continues in Santa Barbara. Jane is torn about the affair; Jake is not. While Agness has Jake scheduled for regular sessions at a fertility clinic, Jake is secretly taking medication to decrease his frequent urination, the side effects of which are decreased sperm count and dizziness.  After one of his sessions, he has a lunchtime rendezvous with Jane at a hotel. Jake collapses in the hotel room and a doctor is called. The doctor speculates that the reason for Jake's distress may be the medication and says he should stop taking it. Jake and Jane's children know nothing of the affair, but Harley, who is engaged to their daughter Lauren, spots the pair and the doctor in the hotel but keeps silent.\n\nAdam is an architect hired to remodel Jane's home. Still healing from a divorce of his own, he begins to fall in love with Jane. On the night of Luke's graduation party in Santa Barbara, Jane invites Adam to the party. She is stoned when he picks her up because she has taken a hit from [[cannabis (drug)|a marijuana joint]] that Jake had given her earlier. Before going into the party, Adam smokes some of the joint with Jane. Once inside, they are laughing and happily high, Jake becomes jealous observing them, and after pressing Jane, smokes some with her also.\n\nAgness then observes Jake and Jane dancing together and senses they are having an affair. When they leave the party, Adam asks Jane if they could have something to eat. Jane takes him to her bakery and they make chocolate [[croissants]] together, ending the evening with a romantic kiss. Jake and Agness separate, although it is not clear who leaves whom. Eventually, by a [[webcam]] in Jane's bedroom, Adam sees Jake naked and realizes that the two have been having an affair. Adam tells Jane he cannot continue seeing her because it will only lead to heartbreak. Jane's kids also find out, and they are not happy about their parents getting back together because they are still recovering from the divorce. Jane tells them she is not getting back with Jake. Jane and Jake talk and end their affair on amicable terms.\n\nThe film ends with Adam at Jane's house ready to commence the remodeling. Before the credits roll, Jane and Adam are seen laughing about the chocolate croissants while walking into her house.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Jane Adler, a successful bakery owner.\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Adam Schaffer, Jane's architect.\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jacob \"Jake\" Adler, Jane's ex-husband.\n* [[Lake Bell]] as Agness Adler, Jake's wife.\n* [[Hunter Parrish]] as Luke David Adler, Jane and Jake's son.\n* [[Zoe Kazan]] as Gabby Adler, Jane and Jake's younger daughter.\n* [[Caitlin FitzGerald]] as Lauren Adler, Jane and Jake's older daughter.\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Harley, Lauren's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Joanne\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Trisha\n* [[Alexandra Wentworth]] as Diane\n* [[James Patrick Stuart]] as Dr. Moss, the plastic surgeon\n* [[Blanchard Ryan]] as Annalise\n* Michael Rivera as Eddie\n* [[Robert Curtis Brown]] as Peter\n* [[Peter Mackenzie]] as Dr. Alan, Jane's therapist.\n* Rosalie Ward as Alex\n* [[Jimmy Clabots]] as Chase\n* [[Emjay Anthony]] as Pedro Adler\n* [[Emily Kinney]] as Waitress.\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Sally \n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Ted\n* [[Lisa Lynn Masters]] as the beautiful woman in elevator.\n* [[Pat Finn (actor)|Pat Finn]] as Hotel Doctor\n* [[Valente Rodriguez]] as Reynaldo\n* [[Andrew Stewart-Jones]] as Restaurant Host\n* [[Geneva Carr]] as Woman at Fertility Clinic\n* [[Deidre Goodwin]] as Fertility Nurse\n* [[Jessica St. Clair]] as Wedding Specialist\n* [[Marina Squerciati]] as Melanie\n* [[Robert Adamson (actor)|Robert Adamson]] as College Kid at Party\n* [[Heitor Pereira]] as Party Musician\n* [[Ramin Djawadi]] as Party Musician\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as TV Actor (uncredited)\n* [[Anne Lockhart (actress)|Anne Lockhart]] as Party Guest (uncredited)\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]] as Herself (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Steve Martin 2011.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''It's Complicated'' marked [[Steve Martin]]'s third collaboration with director [[Nancy Meyers]].]]\nIn May 2008, [[Nancy Meyers]] agreed to a project for [[Universal Studios]] that she would write and direct, to be co-produced with [[Scott Rudin]].<ref name=\"V7\">{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985259.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=Nancy+Meyers |title=Universal woos next Meyers movie |last=Fleming |first=Michael |date=May 7, 2008 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=2009-08-23}}</ref> The project was referred to as ''The Untitled Nancy Meyers Project'' during its inception and early production.
