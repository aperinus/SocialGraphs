He opens his cupboard and sees the reflection of a similar looking man staring back at him. He turns around quickly and is killed by a knife thrown into his chest.\n\nWhile attending a party overlooking the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], recent [[San Francisco]] divorc\u00e9e and shy librarian Gloria Mundy sees a handsome young man, Tony, at the bar, who ruins the moment by stumbling and spilling all the drinks there. Gloria sits with a friend and is encouraged to open herself to new experiences. Driving home, Gloria picks up an attractive man named Bob \"Scotty\" Scott ([[Bruce Solomon]]) when she encounters him next to his broken down car at Powell and Market streets. She impulsively accepts Scotty's invitation to join him at the movies that evening, and before they part ways, he asks her to take his pack of cigarettes to help him curb his smoking. Unknown to her, Scotty has secreted a roll of undeveloped film in the cigarette pack. That evening, a seriously wounded Scotty meets Gloria in the [[Nuart Theatre|movie theater]] and asks her about the film. He bleeds into her popcorn and warns her to \"beware of the dwarf\" before he dies. When his body mysteriously disappears while Gloria seeks help from the theater manager, she is unable to convince anyone of what has transpired. At home she tells her elderly neighbour/landlord Mr. Hennessey ([[Burgess Meredith]]) of the events.\n\nAt the end of the next day, Gloria is attacked in her library by [[albino]] Whitey Jackson ([[William Frankfather]]) who tries to use [[ether]] on her. She runs off and hides in a singles bar where she asks a stranger, Stanley Tibbets ([[Dudley Moore]]), to take her home, but Stanley, an aspiring British womanizer, who assumes she is picking him up to have sex, mixes a cocktail laced with [[Cantharidin|Spanish Fly]] and puts on the [[Bee Gees]].\n\nShocked by his misunderstanding, she flees and returns to her apartment, where she is attacked by a man with a scar who demands the cigarette pack Scotty had given her. When he attempts to strangle her with a scarf, Gloria stabs him in the stomach with a pair of knitting needles and calls the police for help. When the attacker tries to stop her, he is killed by a knife thrown by Whitey through the kitchen window, and Gloria faints in shock. When she awakens, all traces of what has happened have disappeared, and she is unable to convince two San Francisco police officers, Lt. Tony Carlson ([[Chevy Chase]]) and his partner Inspector \"Fergie\" Ferguson ([[Brian Dennehy]]), or even her landlord Mr. Hennessy that she was attacked.\n\nGloria is abducted by Turk Farnum (Ion Tedorescu), the chauffeur of a limousine in which she earlier had seen Whitey riding, but she manages to subdue him with [[Mace (spray)|mace]] and [[brass knuckles]] given to her by her friend and fellow library employee, Stella (Marilyn Sokol). Upon further investigation, Tony discovers that Scotty, an undercover SFPD inspector who had received a tip that a major assassination would take place in the city on a certain night, was investigating contract killer Rupert Stiltskin (alias \"the Dwarf\"). Now assigned to protect Gloria from her would-be killers, Tony later takes her to his houseboat, where the two fall in love.\n\nWhen Tony and Fergie discover that the limousine is registered to the archdiocese of San Francisco, they visit the office of Archbishop Thorncrest ([[Eugene Roche]]), unaware that their interviewee is actually the archbishop's twin brother Charlie, who is involved in a plot to assassinate Pope Pius XIII (played by prominent San Francisco businessman [[Cyril Magnin]]) during his upcoming visit to San Francisco, and has murdered his twin in order to impersonate him. The following day, Rupert kidnaps Fergie and uses him to lure Gloria into a trap. She manages to hide in a massage parlor, where she encounters Stanley yet again, but Whitey and Stiltskin then find and abduct her.\n \nAt Gloria's request, Stella has researched an organization known as the Tax the Churches League, and discovered that the league is a radical fringe group founded by Delia Darrow and her husband. For the Darrows, organized religion is a corrupt, greedy sham involving powerful billion-dollar corporations. Stella gives the results of her findings to Tony, who returns to the archbishop's residence with Mr. Hennessy. Sneaking into the wine cellar, Tony discovers the imprisoned Fergie, who informs him that the Darrows hired Stiltskin to assassinate the Pope during a performance of ''[[The Mikado]]'' at the [[San Francisco Opera House]] that evening. Tony is attacked by Rupert and kills him in self-defense by toppling shelves of wine upon him, but the fake archbishop's assistant Gerda Caswell ([[Rachel Roberts (actress)|Rachel Roberts]]), who is really Delia Darrow, holds him and Gloria at gunpoint.\n\nDarrow then details her \"contingency plan\" to eliminate the pope: If the pope is not dead at the end of act I, Whitey Jackson will open fire from one of the auditorium's two organ bays (\"He will also open fire should the pope unexpectedly leave his seat, or if the police arrive in the auditorium\", Darrow explains). Mr. Hennessy knocks out Charlie and defeats Delia in a duel of martial arts, after which Tony and Gloria drive to the opera house, having some unusual problems along the way (such as crashing into an Italian restaurant and commandeering an airport limousine carrying a pair of Japanese tourists). After making it backstage, Gloria is grabbed by Jackson, who kills one of several security guards who have joined the pursuit. An enraged Gloria attempts to attack Jackson, who simply shoves her to the floor. This gives Tony the room he needs to shoot the albino, thus thwarting the plan to kill the pope. As the performance ends, Gloria and Tony are revealed onstage along with the now-dead bodies of Jackson and the guard, but the pope, who seems not to have noticed anything unusual, leads the audience in applause for the cast, the orchestra, and the conductor\u2014Stanley Tibbets.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Gloria Mundy\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Lieutenant Tony Carlson\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as Mr. Hennessey\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Inspector \"Fergie\" Ferguson\n* [[Dudley Moore]] as Stanley Tibbets\n* [[Rachel Roberts (actress)|Rachel Roberts]] as Gerda Casswell/Delia Darrow\n* [[Eugene Roche]] as Archbishop Thorncrest/Charlie Thorncrest\n* [[William Frankfather]] as Whitey Jackson\n* [[Marc Lawrence]] as Rupert Stiltskin, \"The Dwarf\"\n* [[Marilyn Sokol]] as Stella\n* [[Billy Barty]] as J.J.

The premise of an innocent person becoming entangled in a web of intrigue is common in Hitchcock films, such as ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'' and, most notably, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'', which inspired the opera house sequence in ''Foul Play''.  When Gloria is attacked in her home by a man attempting to strangle her with a scarf and she defends herself with a household object, both are references to ''[[Dial M for Murder]]''.  Other Hitchcock films which receive a nod from screenwriter/director Colin Higgins include ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In addition, the plot includes a [[MacGuffin]]\u2014an object that initially is the central focus of the film but declines in importance until it is forgotten and unexplained by the end\u2014in the form of the roll of film concealed in the pack of cigarettes. Hitchcock popularized the term MacGuffin and used the technique in many of his films.\n\n\"Audiences love to be scared and at the same time they love to laugh\", said Higgins. \"It is tongue in cheek realism. The audience is in on the joke but the actors must carry on as if they were unaware.\"<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|title=FILM CLIPS: Hawn On Deck for 'Foul Play'|author=Kilday, Gregg|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Aug 13, 1977|page=b6}}</ref>\n\nThe script originally was written under the name ''Killing Lydia'' with Goldie Hawn in mind for the lead. Higgins had met Hawn through their mutual friend [[Hal Ashby]]. However, the project did not take off. After ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' came out, Higgins rewrote the script. He and the producers took the project to Paramount who hoped to star [[Farrah Fawcett]]. However, Fawcett was in the middle of a legal battle with the producers of ''Charlie's Angels'' so it was decided to go with Hawn.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nThe name Gloria Mundy is a reference to \"[[Sic transit gloria mundi]]\", Latin for \"Thus passes the glory of the world\": the phrase was part of the rite of papal coronation until 1963.\n\nHiggins had written the role of Stanley Tibbets for [[Tim Conway]], but when the actor turned it down he offered it to [[Dudley Moore]] instead. It was Moore's American film debut and led to his being cast in ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' by [[Blake Edwards]] the following year.<ref name=TCM />\n\nHiggins says when he sold the script he wanted to direct it so badly he did not care who was going to play the lead roles. He met with Fawcett to play the female lead before going with Goldie Hawn. His first choice for the male lead was [[Harrison Ford]] (who had been Higgins' carpenter) who turned it down. [[Steve Martin]] was offered the role but did not end up playing it. Higgins says he offered the part to another actor who wanted to play the cop and Stanley Tibbets. Eventually Chevy Chase was cast.<ref>{{cite news|title=HIGGINS: WRITER-DIRECTOR ON HOT STREAK|author=Goldstein, Patrick|work=Los Angeles Times|date=Jan 24, 1981|page=b15}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in and around San Francisco, in locations including [[Noe Valley]], the [[Mission District]], [[Hallidie Plaza]], [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], [[Hayes Valley, San Francisco|Hayes Valley]], [[Nob Hill]], [[Pacific Heights]], [[Fort Mason]], the [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina District]], the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]], [[Potrero Hill]], [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]], and the [[War Memorial Opera House]].

But as ''[[House Calls (1978 film)|House Calls]]'' did a few months ago, it starts out promising genuine wit and originality only to fall back on more familiar tactics after a half-hour or so. If either film had a less winning opening, perhaps it wouldn't leave a vague aftertaste of disappointment. Colin Higgins...has aimed for the same kind of thriller-comedy-romance hybrid he attempted in writing ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', and this time he's much more successful ...Still, Mr. Higgins isn't a facile enough juggler to keep the film's diverse elements from colliding at times.\"<ref>Maslin, Janet (July 19, 1978).
