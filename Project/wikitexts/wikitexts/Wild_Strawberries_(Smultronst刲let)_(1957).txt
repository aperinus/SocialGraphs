The original [[Swedish language|Swedish]] title is '''''Smultronst\u00e4llet''''', which literally means \"the [[Fragaria|wild strawberry]] patch\" but idiomatically signifies a hidden gem of a place, often with personal or sentimental value, and not widely known. The cast includes [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]] in his final screen performance as an old man recalling his past, as well as Bergman regulars [[Bibi Andersson]], [[Ingrid Thulin]], and [[Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand]].

Before specializing, he served as a general practitioner in rural Sweden. He sets out on a long car ride from [[Stockholm]] to [[Lund]] to be awarded the degree of [[Jubilee doctor|Doctor Jubilaris]] 50 years after he received his doctorate from [[Lund University]]. He is accompanied by his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne who does not much like her father-in-law and is planning to separate from her husband, Evald, Isak's only son, who does not want her to have the baby, their first.\n\nDuring the trip, Isak is forced by [[nightmare]]s, [[daydream]]s, [[old age]], and impending death to reevaluate his life. He meets a series of hitchhikers, each of whom sets off dreams or reveries into Borg's troubled past. The first group consists of two young men and their companion, a woman named Sara who is adored by both men. Sara is a double for the love of Isak's youth. He reminisces about his childhood at the seaside and his sweetheart Sara, with whom he remembered gathering strawberries, but who instead married his brother. The first group remains with him throughout his journey. Next Isak and Marianne pick up an embittered middle-aged couple, the Almans, whose vehicle has nearly collided with theirs. The pair exchanges such terrible vitriol and venom that Marianne stops the car and demands that they leave. The couple reminds Isak of his own unhappy marriage. In a dream sequence, Isak is asked by Sten Alman, now the examiner, to read \"foreign\" letters on the blackboard. He cannot. So, Alman reads it for him: \"A doctor's first duty is to ask forgiveness,\" from which he concludes, \"You are guilty of guilt.\"<ref>[[Erik Erikson]] [http://www.haverford.edu/psych/ddavis/p109g/erikson.strawberries.html \u201cWild Strawberries\u201d].</ref>\n\nHe is confronted by his loneliness and aloofness, recognizing these traits in both his elderly mother (whom they stop to visit) and in his middle-aged physician son, and he gradually begins to accept himself, his past, his present, and his approaching death.<ref name=\"gu\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jun/10/1|title=Ingmar Bergman: Wild Strawberries|date=10 June 1999|work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Derek | last=Malcolm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D06E0DE173BEF3BBC4B51DFB0668382649EDE |title=Wild Strawberries (1957) NYT Critics' Pick |date=23 June 1959 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=16 May 2010 |first=Bosley |last=Crowther|authorlink=Bosley Crowther}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Se-Sno/Smultronst-llet.html|title=Plot and review: SMULTRONST\u00c4LLET (Wild Stawberries)|last=Manvell|first=Roger|website=filmreference.com}}</ref>\n\nBorg finally arrives at his destination and is promoted to Doctor Jubilaris, but this proves to be an empty ritual.

Driving by his grandmother's house, he suddenly imagined how it would be if he could open the door and inside find everything just as it was during his childhood. \"So it struck me \u2014 what if you could make a film about this; that you just walk up in a realistic way and open a door, and then you walk into your childhood, and then you open another door and come back to reality, and then you make a turn around a street corner and arrive in some other period of your existence, and everything goes on, lives. That was actually the idea behind ''Wild Strawberries''\".<ref>Bj\u00f6rkman</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2015}} Later, he would revise the story of the film's genesis. In ''Images: My Life in Film,'' he comments on his own earlier statement: \"That's a lie. The truth is that I am forever living in my childhood.\"<ref name=Images>{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=Ingmar|title=Images: my life in film|date=1990|publisher=Arcade Publishing|isbn=9781559701860|url=https://archive.org/details/images00ingm_0}}</ref>{{rp|p22}}\n\n===Development===\nBergman wrote the screenplay of ''Wild Strawberries'' in Stockholm's [[Karolinska University Hospital|Karolinska Hospital]] (the workplace of Isak Borg) in the late spring of 1957; he'd recently been given permission to proceed by producer [[Carl Anders Dymling]] on the basis of a short synopsis. He was in the hospital for two months, being treated for recurrent gastric problems and general stress. Bergman's doctor at Karolinska was his good friend Sture Helander who invited him to attend his lectures on psychosomatics. Helander was married to [[Gunnel Lindblom]] who was to play Isak's sister Charlotta in the film. Bergman was at a high point of his professional career after a triumphant season at the Malm\u00f6 City Theatre (where he had been artistic director since 1952), in addition to the success of both ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957). His private life, however, was in disarray. His third marriage was on the rocks; his affair with [[Bibi Andersson]], which had begun in 1954, was coming to an end; and his relationship with his parents was, after an attempted reconciliation with his mother, at a desperately low ebb.<ref name=Images/>{{rp|p17}}\n\nCasting and [[pre-production]] progressed rapidly. The completed screenplay is dated May 31. Shooting took place between July 2, 1957 and August 27, 1957.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smultronst\u00e4llet (1957) - Filming Locations|url=http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?itemid=4549&type=MOVIE&iv=RecordingPlace|website=Swedish Film Institute|language=sv}}</ref> The scenes at the summer house were filmed in [[Saltsj\u00f6baden]], a fashionable resort in the Stockholm archipelago. Part of the nightmare sequence was shot with predawn summer light in [[Gamla stan]], the old part of central Stockholm. Most of the movie was made at SF's studio and on its back lot at R\u00e5sunda in northern Stockholm.<ref name=ingbergf2f/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe director's immediate choice for the leading role of the old professor was [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]], Bergman's [[silent film]] idol and early counselor at [[AB Svensk Filmindustri|Svensk Filmindustri]], whom he had directed in ''[[To Joy (film)|To Joy]]'' eight years earlier. \"Victor,\" Bergman remarked, \"was feeling wretched and didn\u2019t want to [do it];... he must have been seventy eight. He was misanthropic and tired and felt old. I had to use all my powers of persuasion to get him to play the part.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bj\u00f6rkman|first1=Stig|title=Bergman on Bergman|date=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=133}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Bergman on Bergman,'' he has stated that he only thought of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m when the screenplay was complete, and that he asked Dymling to contact the famous actor and film director.<ref>Bj\u00f6rkman, pg. 131</ref> Yet in ''Images: My Life in Film,'' he claims, \"It is probably worth noting that I never for a moment thought of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m when I was writing the screenplay. The suggestion came from the film's producer, Carl Anders Dymling. As I recall, I thought long and hard before I agreed to let him have the part.\"<ref name=Images/>{{rp|p24}}\n\nDuring the shooting, the health of the 78-year-old Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m gave cause for concern. Dymling had persuaded him to take on the role with the words: \"All you have to do is lie under a tree, eat wild strawberries and think about your past, so it's nothing too arduous.\" This was inaccurate and the burden of the film was completely on Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m who is in all but one scene of the film. Initially, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m had problems with his lines which made him frustrated and angry. He would go off into a corner and beat his head against the wall in frustration, even to the point of drawing blood and producing bruises. He sometimes quibbled over details in the script. To unburden his revered mentor, Bergman made a pact with [[Ingrid Thulin]] that if anything went wrong during a scene, she would take the blame on herself. Things improved when they changed filming times so that Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m could get home in time for his customary late afternoon whisky at 5:00. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m got along particularly well with [[Bibi Andersson]].<ref name=ingbergf2f/>\n\nAs usual, Bergman chose his collaborators from a team of actors and technicians with whom he had worked before in the cinema and the theater. As Sara, Bibi Andersson plays both Borg's childhood sweetheart who left him to marry his brother and a charming, energetic young woman who reminds him of that lost love. Andersson, then twenty one years old, was a member in Bergman's famed repertory company. He gave her a small part in his films ''Smiles of a Summer Night'' (1955) and as the jester's wife in ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957). She would continue to work for him in many more films, most notably in ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'' (1966). [[Ingrid Thulin]] plays Marianne, the sad, gentle and warm daughter-in-law of Borg. She appeared in other Bergman films as the mistress in ''[[Winter Light]]'' (1963) and as one of three sisters in ''[[Cries and Whispers]]'' (1972). Bergman's first wife, Else Fisher, made a brief uncredited appearance as Borg's mother in the final flashback; their daughter, Lena, played one of Isak's twin sisters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Wild Strawberries'' received strongly positive reviews in Sweden; its acting, script, and photography were common areas of praise.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJCGNAlqB0gC&pg=PA231|title=Ingmar Bergman: A Reference Guide|page=231|last=Steene|first=Birgitta|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|date=2005|isbn=9053564063}}</ref> It was among the films that cemented Bergman's international reputation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/141987%7C0/Wild-Strawberries.html|title=Wild Strawberries|last=Nixon|first=Rob|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|access-date=February 12, 2017}}</ref> but American critics were not unanimous in their praise. A number of reviewers found its story puzzling. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]] lauded the performances of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Andersson but wrote, \"This one is so thoroughly mystifying that we wonder whether Mr. Bergman himself knew what he was trying to say.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D06E0DE173BEF3BBC4B51DFB0668382649EDE|title=Screen: Elusive Message; Wild Strawberries' Is a Swedish Import|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 23, 1959|access-date=February 12, 2017}} Crowther also notes \"the English subtitles are not much help\", so some confusion was created by poor subtitles in the 1959 screening. To take just one example, in the review he states that it\u2019s unclear if the main character was a physician or a doctor, whereas in the script this is eminently clear, in fact an important scene is when the traveling party stops to refuel and the gas attendant refuses to take payment for the gasoline and extols all the good that the \u201cgood doctor\u201d has done for the community, to which the old man replies mostly to himself \"maybe I should have stayed\".</ref> The film ranked 7th on [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'s [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's Annual Top 10 Lists|Top 10 Films of the Year List]] in 1959.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|title=Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951-2009|last=Johnson|first=Eric C.|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|archive-date=2012-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1963 interview with ''Cinema'' magazine, director [[Stanley Kubrick]] listed the film as his second favourite of all time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ciment |first=Michel |title=Kubrick: Biographical Notes |year=1982 |publisher=The Kubrick Site |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/milestones.html |access-date=11 July 2011}}</ref> It was also listed by Russian filmmaker [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] as one of his top ten favorite films.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lasica |first=Tom |title=Tarkovsky's Choice |url=http://www.nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html |access-date=January 19, 2020 |website=Nostalghia.com}}</ref> It is now considered one of Bergman's major works.

In ''Stardust Memories'', the film's plot is similar in that the protagonist, filmmaker Sandy Bates (Woody Allen), is attending a viewing of his films, while reminiscing about and reflecting on his life and past relationships and trying to fix and stabilize his current ones, which are infused with flashbacks and dream sequences.  In ''Another Woman'', the film's main character, Marion Post ([[Gena Rowlands]]), is also accused by friends and relatives of being cold and unfeeling, which forces her to reexamine her life.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/another-woman-1988 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Another Woman}}</ref>  Allen also borrows several tropes from Bergman's film, such as having Lynn ([[Frances Conroy]]), Post's sister-in-law, tell her that her brother Paul ([[Harris Yulin]]) hates her and having a former student tell Post that her class changed her life. Allen has Post confront the demons of her past via several dream sequences and flashbacks that reveal important information to a viewer, as in ''Wild Strawberries''.  In ''Crimes and Misdemeanors'', Allen made reference to the scene in which Isak watches his family have dinner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thefilmspectrum.com/?p=18576|title=Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) &#124; The Film Spectrum|first=Jason|last=Fraley|access-date=August 3, 2019}}</ref>  In ''Deconstructing Harry'', the plot (a writer going on a long drive to receive an honorary award from his old university, while reflecting upon his life's experiences, with dream sequences) essentially mirrors that of ''Wild Strawberries''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Deconstructing Harry|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deconstructing-harry-1997|website=RogerEbert.com|access-date=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Satyajit Ray]]'s 1966 film ''[[Nayak (1966 film)|Nayak]]'' was some extent been inspired by ''Wild Strawberries''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeH-1Kyveyc | title=NAYAK vs WILD STRAWBERRIES &#124; Inspiration Behind Satyajit Ray's masterpiece &#124; Uttam Kumar &#124; Bergman | website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Wild Strawberries (film)}}\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0050986|Wild Strawberries}}\n* {{Sfdb title}}\n* {{amg movie|54583|Wild Strawberries}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=95892}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|wild_strawberries|Wild Strawberries}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/186-wild-strawberries ''Wild Strawberries''] an essay by [[Peter Cowie]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Ingmar Bergman}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Wild Strawberries''\n|list1 =\n{{Sight and Sound Poll}}\n{{Golden Bear 1951-1959}}\n{{Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1957 drama films]]\n[[Category:1957 films]]\n[[Category:Swedish black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Existentialist films]]\n[[Category:Films about old age]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ingmar Bergman]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1890s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ingmar Bergman]]\n[[Category:Golden Bear winners]]\n[[Category:1950s drama road movies]]\n[[Category:Swedish drama films]]\n[[Category:1950s Swedish-language films]]\n[[Category:Philosophical fiction]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Erik Nordgren]]\n[[Category:Films about dreams]]\n[[Category:1950s Swedish films]]"}]}}}}
