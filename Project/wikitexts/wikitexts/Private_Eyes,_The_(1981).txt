The pair play bumbling American [[detective]]s who work for [[Metropolitan Police Service|Scotland Yard]]. It was filmed at [[Biltmore Estate]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], [[North Carolina]].\n\nThe film was directed by Lang Elliott and was the final pairing of Conway and Knotts, not counting their [[cameo appearance|cameos]] as two [[California Highway Patrol]] officers in the 1984 film ''[[Cannonball Run II]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens early in the twentieth century, at an English [[country mansion]] with the apparent murder of Lord and Lady Morley in their car by a figure in a black cape. [[Inspector]] Winship (Knotts) and Dr. Tart (Conway), two American detectives transferred over to Scotland Yard because of problems in the United States, travel to the Morley mansion, brandishing a letter from the late Lord Morley asking them to investigate his own murder. They encounter the attractive heiress - the Morley's adopted daughter Phyllis Morley (Trisha Noble) - and are introduced to the manor's questionable staff.\n\nAs the two investigate the murder, each of the staff, which includes a [[samurai]], a [[hunchback]], a [[busty]] [[maid]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]], and an insane [[butler]], are seemingly killed. However, each of their bodies disappear before the detectives can show them to the heiress. Their attempts to update Scotland Yard via [[homing pigeon]] are continuously thwarted, typically by the death of the pigeon. After discovering the manor's numerous hidden passages, the detectives wind up in a \"[[torture chamber]]\" and Winship is caught in a deadly trap. While Tart clumsily searches for a way to help, the caped figure (\"The Shadow\") leaps out to rescue Winship from the trap.\n\nA [[boa constrictor]] then frightens them into a trash compactor, where they survive being compressed into a bale of garbage. Once out of the garbage, they find the heiress taking the Morley money and preparing to leave the mansion. She then confesses to having killed the Morleys for their money as she has a gambling habit. Planning to kill the detectives and escape the mansion, she falls backward into a flower bed while retreating, where she is grabbed by the shadowy figure, who has been hiding in the dirt.  The shadow scares her to the point that she faints, at which time the shadow takes off his cape, revealing himself to be Lord Morley.\n\nMorley had escaped the car crash and gathered the staff to gain their help in a plan to get the heiress to confess to the murder of his wife and the attempt on his own life. Morley remained \"dead\" (in hiding) as part of the plan, writing the letter to Scotland Yard in order to request Winship and Tart as investigators, presumably because of their incompetence. As Morley explains what he did, the members of the staff appear, having faked their own deaths as part of the plan. The heiress is arrested and Winship and Tart are thanked with a gift of a very rare [[sarcophagus]], which is placed in their car.\n\nAs Winship and Tart drive away, they argue over the existence of creatures known as \"wookalars,\" said to be manlike creatures with superhuman strength and a pig-like face. The film ends with their car careening down the road as they scream in terror, due to the sudden appearance of a wookalar from the sarcophagus.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Don Knotts]] as Inspector Winship\n* [[Tim Conway]] as Dr. Tart\n* [[Trisha Noble]] as Mistress Phyllis Morley\n* [[John Fujioka]] as Mr. Uwatsum\n* [[Bernard Fox (actor)|Bernard Fox]] as Justin\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Nanny\n* Stan Ross as Tibet\n* [[Irwin Keyes]] as Jock\n* [[Suzy Mandel]] as Hilda\n\n==Background==\nThe two comedic actors Conway and Knotts achieved success onscreen when they were paired in several family-friendly feature films for [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]]: ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975), ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), and ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979).<ref name=Tillisch>{{cite web| first= Rob| last= Tillisch| date= 29 June 2005| url= http://www.kopictureshow.com/KOPictureShowThePrizeFighter.html| title= The Prize Fighter (1979) | website= KOPictureShow.com| accessdate= 17 August 2015}}</ref> Conway and [[John Myhers]] wrote a screenplay which became ''[[The Prize Fighter]]''<ref name= Tillisch /> and after its success at the box office in 1979 (and in rentals), Conway and Myhers wrote another Knotts and Conway team-up, ''The Private Eyes''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/11/movies/two-clowns-as-private-eyes.html|title=Two Clowns as 'Private Eyes'|last=Corry|first=John|date=1981-04-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Private Eyes'' earned $12 million in rentals during its initial release, and became the highest-grossing film made at [[New World Pictures]] under [[Roger Corman]].<ref name=adv/><ref name=\"New World\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0081376|The Private Eyes}}\n* {{tcmdb title|87201|The Private Eyes}}\n* [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/private_eyes/ ''The Private Eyes''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n* {{amg title|39300|The Private Eyes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Private Eyes, The}}\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:1980 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime films]]\n[[Category:1980s comedy mystery films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s parody films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Films set in England]]\n[[Category:Films shot in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:New World Pictures films]]"}]}}}}
