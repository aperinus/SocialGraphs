Filming took place primarily on location around [[New York City]] and in [[Sicily]], and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by [[Nino Rota]], with additional pieces by [[Carmine Coppola]].\n\n''The Godfather'' premiered at the [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] on March 14, 1972, and was widely released in the United States on March 24, 1972. It was the [[1972 in film#Top grossing films (U.S.)|highest-grossing film of 1972]], and was for a time the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film ever made]], earning between $250 and $291 million at the box office. The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for the performances, particularly those of Brando and Pacino, direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. ''The Godfather'' acted as a catalyst for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast and crew. The film also revitalized Brando's career, which had declined in the 1960s, and he went on to star in films such as ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''. At the [[45th Academy Awards]], the film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Brando), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall all for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], and Coppola for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n''The Godfather'' is regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential films ever made]], as well as a landmark of the [[gangster film|gangster]] genre.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-is-the-godfather-effect-83473971/ |title=What is The Godfather Effect? |last=Gambino |first=Megan |date=January 31, 2012 |work=Smithsonian |access-date=September 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910061138/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-is-the-godfather-effect-83473971/ |archive-date=September 10, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1990, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|second-greatest film in American cinema]] (behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'') by the [[American Film Institute]].

[[Michael Corleone|Michael]], Vito's youngest son and a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], introduces his girlfriend, [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay Adams]], to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a [[popular singer]] and Vito's [[Godparent|godson]], seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role. Vito dispatches his [[consigliere]], [[Tom Hagen]], to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz complies after he finds the severed head of his prized [[Stud (animal)|stallion]] in his bed.\n\nNear Christmas, drug baron [[List of The Godfather series characters#Virgil Sollozzo|Sollozzo]] asks Vito to invest in his narcotics business and for protection from the law. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo's partnership with the [[Tattaglia family|Tattaglia]] crime family, Vito sends his enforcer [[Luca Brasi]] to meet with the Tattaglias. Brasi is [[garrote]]d to death during the meeting. Later, enforcers gun down Vito and kidnap Hagen. With Corleone's first-born [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]] now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal. Sonny retaliates for Brasi's death with a [[Contract killing|hit]] on Bruno Tattaglia. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after [[NYPD]] officers on Sollozzo's payroll cleared out Vito's guards. Michael thwarts another attempt on his father's life but is beaten by corrupt [[police captain]] Mark McCluskey. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and settle the dispute. Michael feigns interest and agrees to meet, but hatches a plan with Sonny and Corleone [[Caporegime|capo]] [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]] to kill them and go into hiding. Michael meets Sollozzo and McCluskey at a [[The Bronx|Bronx]] restaurant; after retrieving a handgun planted in the bathroom by Clemenza, he shoots both men dead.\n\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, the [[Five Families (The Godfather)|Five Families]] erupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]], Vito's second son, is sheltered by [[Moe Greene]] in Las Vegas. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman, [[List of The Godfather series characters#Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone|Apollonia]], but she is killed shortly thereafter by a [[car bomb]] intended for him.\n\nDevastated by Sonny's death and tired of war, Vito sets a meeting with the Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay. Kay gives birth to two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito reveals to Michael that it was Don [[Emilio Barzini|Barzini]] who ordered the hit on Sonny and warns him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone capo. With Vito's support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a \"wartime consigliere\". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos and is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\n\nIn 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandchild. At Vito's funeral, [[Salvatore Tessio|Tessio]] asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the dons of the Five Families, Greene, and Tessio is executed for his treachery. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to playing a part in Sonny's murder, assuring Carlo he is only being exiled, not murdered; afterward, Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. Connie confronts Michael about Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if Connie is telling the truth and is relieved when he denies it. As Kay leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael as \"Don Corleone\" before closing the door.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:TheGodfatherAlPacinoMarlonBrando.jpg|thumb|upright|Brando (right) and Pacino as Don Vito and Michael Corleone, respectively|alt=A screenshot of Michael and Vito Corleone in ''The Godfather'']]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]]: [[crime boss]] and patriarch of the [[Corleone family]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]: Vito's youngest son \n* [[James Caan]] as [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]: Vito's eldest son\n* [[Richard Castellano]] as [[Peter Clemenza|Clemenza]]: a ''[[caporegime]]'' in the Corleone crime family, Sonny's godfather \n* [[Robert Duvall]] as [[Tom Hagen]]: Corleone [[consigliere]], lawyer, and unofficial adopted member of the Corleone family \n* [[Sterling Hayden]] as [[Captain McCluskey|Capt.

Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks. The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola and expresses his understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to America, the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |title=The Godfather: A Cultural Phenomenon |url=http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007060450/http://tags.library.upenn.edu/project/27508 |archive-date=October 7, 2008}}</ref> ''The Godfather'' has been cited as an influence in an increase in Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians, and was a recruiting tool for organized crime.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is The Godfather Effect? |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |first=Megan |last=Gambino |date=January 31, 2012 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |access-date=May 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423232235/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/What-is-The-Godfather-Effect.html |archive-date=April 23, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language.
