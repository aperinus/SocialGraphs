As part of this series, the documentary was broadcast in over 30  countries from October 8\u201318, 2007. The BBC showed the film in its ''[[Storyville (TV series)|Storyville]]'' series.\n\n==Overview==\n''Taxi to the Dark Side'' examines [[Torture and the United States|US policy on torture]] and interrogation, specifically the [[U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals|CIA's use of torture]] and their research into [[sensory deprivation]]. The film includes discussions against the use of torture by political and military opponents, as well as the defense of such methods; attempts by Congress to uphold the standards of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]] forbidding torture; and popularization of the use of torture techniques in TV shows such as ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe documentary concerns the death of Dilawar, an Afghan peanut farmer, who gave up farming to become a taxi driver and who died after several days of beating at [[Parwan Detention Facility|Bagram detention center]].\n\nDilawar left his home of [[Yakubi]] in eastern [[Afghanistan]] in the autumn of 2002, investing his family money in a new taxi to make money in a larger city. On 1 December 2002 he and three passengers were handed over to US military officials by a local Afghan warlord, accused of organising an attack on [[Camp Salerno]]. The warlord was later found guilty of the attack himself, but had been ingratiating himself (for $1000 per person) by handing over alleged terrorists.\n\nDilawar was held at the prison at [[Bagram Airfield|Bagram Air Base]], and given the prisoner number BT421. Chained from the ceiling, he received multiple attacks on his thighs, a standard technique viewed as \"permissible\" and non-life-threatening. It is likely that the severe attack caused a blood clot which then killed him. His official death certificate created by the US military to pass to his family, with his body, was marked \"[[homicide]]\". Medical conclusion stated that Dilawar's legs were \"pulpified\" and, had he lived, would have required amputation.\n\nThe film explores the background of increasingly sanctioned torture following [[9/11]] in contravention of the [[Geneva Convention]] and looks at the exposure of [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]].\n\nInterviews include [[Tim Golden (journalist)|Tim Golden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' who brought the case into the international spotlight, and [[Moazzam Begg]], a British citizen imprisoned at the same time, and witness to the events. Military interviewees include [[Damien Corsetti]] the main interrogator, and Sgt. Anthony Morden. Cpt [[Christopher Beiring]] explains how he was the only person charged (charged with dereliction of duty).\n\nThe documentary claims that of the over 83,000 people incarcerated by US forces in Afghanistan up to 2007, 93 percent were captured  by local militiamen and exchanged for US bounty payments. Also that 105 detainees had died in captivity and that 37 of these deaths had been officially classified as homicides up to 2007.<ref name=\"wsws\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2008/03/dark-m24.html|title=Taxi to the Dark Side: Murder of young Afghan driver exposes US torture policies|last=Phillips|first=Richard|date=28 March 2008|publisher=World Socialist Web Site|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film also looks at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]] and how the same techniques were implemented there.\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in [[New York City]] on April 28, 2007.<ref name=WallStreetJournal>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117763344614784224 | title=Director Explores 'Dark Side' Of U.S. Treatment of Detainees | author=Beckey Bright | date=April 28, 2007 | publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] | access-date=2007-05-05}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Alex Gibney and the crew of Taxi to the Darkside at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards.jpg|thumb|Alex Gibney and the crew of ''Taxi to the Dark Side'' at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards]]\n''Taxi to the Dark Side'' appeared on some critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.
