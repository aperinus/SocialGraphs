It is an adaptation of the 1954 novel ''God and My Country'' by [[MacKinlay Kantor]] and was the final [[live action]] film produced by [[Walt Disney]], who died two weeks later. The film stars [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Vera Miles]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Charlie Ruggles|Charles Ruggles]] and [[Kurt Russell]], and is co-produced by Walt Disney and [[Winston Hibler]], directed by [[Norman Tokar]] and written by [[Louis Pelletier]]. It is one of the few films featuring the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and is Disney's [[paean]] to the Boy Scouts. The title song \"Follow Me, Boys!\" was written by studio favorites [[Sherman Brothers|Robert and Richard Sherman]]. After the film's production, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] considered using the song as their [[anthem]], but efforts toward the end were dropped. The ''[[Boys' Life]]'' magazine included a teaser article of the film.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3alTZhJX5voC|title=Boys Life: Lights! Cameras!

A DVD version was released on February 3, 2004 by Walt Disney Home Entertainment, although it is in 4:3 [[pan and scan]] format, not the original 1.66:1 wide screen aspect ratio.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1930, Lemuel \"Lem\" Siddons, a saxophonist in a traveling band, dreams of becoming a lawyer. When the band's bus reaches the small town of Hickory, Lem suddenly decides to leave the band and settle down, finding a job as a clerk in the general store owned by John Everett Hughes. At the town civic meeting, Lem again notices Vida Downey, a [[bank teller]] whom Lem had seen on his first day in town, and eventually attempts to woo away from her boyfriend Ralph Hastings. Lem notices Vida crosses off the YMCA and the 4-H from her list of three possible organizations to keep the town's boys off the streets, leaving only the Boy Scouts, and he decides to suggest and volunteer to become [[Scout leader|Scoutmaster]] of the newly formed Troop 1.\n\nSome time later, Lem becomes an all-around natural leader with the Scout troop, even putting a plan to become a lawyer aside as he helps the town's boys mature into men. Meanwhile, the town's troublemaker boy, Edward \"Whitey\" White Jr., refuses to join the troop. One night, while Lem and Vida are on a date, they catch Whitey shoplifting from Hughes' store. Startled, Whitey falls and sprains his ankle, which Lem bandages using the techniques provided in the [[Boy Scout Handbook]]. Impressed by Lem's work, Whitey secretly steals the book, which Lem allows, because he sees his past self reflected in Whitey. One night, Lem invites Whitey's father, Edward Sr., to attend parents' night at the Boy Scouts' meeting place located on the lake property of Hetty Seibert. Edward arrives drunk and embarrasses Whitey, causing him to quit the troop. However, Edward dies later that very night of [[Alcohol intoxication#Acute alcohol poisoning|alcohol poisoning]], leaving Lem and Vida to adopt Whitey.\n\nIn 1944, Lem is accidentally captured by the [[United States Army]], who are playing a [[military exercise|war game]] in the area near the lake. Lem is taken for a spy due to his Scouting equipment and is unable to prove he is a Scoutmaster after the military captain asks Lem to tie a [[sheepshank]], the only knot Lem never learned. Across the lake, Troop 1 fires their morning cannon, accidentally signaling the military to playfully attack the boys. The scouts take shelter in a staged base and successfully capture a tank with [[squib (explosive)|explosive squibs]], meant to resemble [[land mine]]s, thus freeing Lem from the captivity of the embarrassed military.\n\nBack at the lake, Lem and the troop discover that Ralph is taking Hetty to court over the lake property, since he believes it belongs to him. Lem is hired as Hetty's lawyer. He questions her on the stand, revealing that the property was once the location of her family cottage before it burned down in September 1918, two days after she learned that her sons were [[Battle of St Quentin Canal|killed in France]]. Hetty states that she allowed the troop to meet there, as the boys reminded her of her late sons at play. Ultimately, Hetty wins the case and Lem is allowed to keep the property.\n\nOn September 1, 1945, Lem and Vida celebrate Hughes' birthday by listening to [[Harry S. Truman]] announce the [[Surrender of Japan|end of the war]] over the radio. Whitey, who became a captain in the army, returns to Hickory to introduce Lem and Vida to his wife, Nora, an army nurse. In 1950, Hughes passes away, leaving the store to both Lem and Vida. Meanwhile, due to Lem's health, the Scout committee forces Lem to retire as Scoutmaster. In appreciation for his two decades of service, the entire town gives Lem a surprise celebration on October 2, 1950,<ref>October 2, 1950 actually fell on Monday, not on Saturday as depicted in the film.</ref> with both current and former members of Troop 1 in attendance for the dedication of Hetty's property as Camp Siddons to honor Lem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehickorybugle.blogspot.com/|title=Lem Siddons Day Activities Announced|access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060420/plotsummary | title=Plot Summary for 'Follow Me, Boys!' | access-date=November 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Fred MacMurray]] \u2014 Lemuel \"Lem\" Siddons\n* [[Vera Miles]] \u2014 Vida Downey\n* [[Lillian Gish]] \u2014 Hetty Seibert\n* [[Charlie Ruggles]] \u2014 John Everett Hughes\n* [[Sean McClory]] \u2014 Edward White Sr.\n* [[Kurt Russell]] \u2014 Edward \"Whitey\" White Jr.\n* [[Donald May]] \u2014 Edward \"Whitey\" White Jr., as an adult\n* [[Luana Patten]] \u2014 Nora White\n* [[Elliott Reid]] \u2014 Ralph Hastings\n* [[John Zaremba]] \u2014 Ralph Hastings' lawyer\n* [[Ken Murray (entertainer)|Ken Murray]] \u2014 Melody Murphy\n* [[Parley Baer]] \u2014 Mayor Hi Plommer\n* [[Steve Franken]] \u2014 P.O.W.
