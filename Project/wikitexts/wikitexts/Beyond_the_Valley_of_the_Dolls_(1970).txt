''Beyond'' met a similar fate; it was initially panned by critics but became a box office success. The film later developed a [[cult film|cult following]] in subsequent decades, and earned some critical reappraisal for its [[satire (film and television)|satirical]] and [[metafiction]]al elements.\n\n==Plot==\nThree young women\u2014Kelly MacNamara, Casey Anderson, and Petronella \"Pet\" Danforth\u2014perform in a rock band, the Kelly Affair, managed by Harris Allsworth, Kelly's boyfriend. The four travel to Los Angeles to find Kelly's estranged aunt, Susan Lake, heiress to a family fortune. After Susan promises Kelly a third of her inheritance, Porter Hall, her sleazy financial advisor, discredits Kelly as a \"[[hippie]]\" to dissuade Susan from dividing the fortune he secretly wants to embezzle.\n\nUndeterred, Susan introduces the Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected [[Record producer|rock producer]], Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell, who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]]). The band is so well-received that {{nowrap|Z-Man}} becomes their [[svengali]] manager, changing their name to the [[Carrie Nation]]s and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris.\n\nKelly drifts away from Harris and dates Lance Rocke, a high-priced [[Male prostitution|gigolo]], who has his own designs on her inheritance. After losing Kelly, Harris is seduced by the sexually aggressive porn star Ashley St. Ives. She soon tires of his conventional nature and waning libido due to increasing drug and alcohol intake. Harris's further descent into drug and alcohol use leads to a fistfight with Lance and a [[one-night stand]] with Casey which results in pregnancy. Kelly ends her affair with Lance after he severely beats Harris.\n\nCasey, distraught at getting pregnant and wary of men's foibles, has a lesbian affair with fashion designer Roxanne, who pressures her to have an abortion. Pet has a seemingly enchanted romance with law student Emerson Thorne after a [[meet cute]] at one of {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} parties. Their fairy-tale romance frays when Pet sleeps with Randy Black, a violent prize fighter who beats up Emerson and tries to run him down with a car.\n\nPorter offers Kelly $50,000 to relinquish any claim to Susan's inheritance. When Kelly angrily rejects his offer at one of {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} parties, Susan learns of his underhanded ploy and severs her ties with him.\n\nThe Carrie Nations release several records despite constant touring and drug use. Upset at being pushed to the sidelines, Harris attempts suicide by leaping from the rafters of a sound stage during a television appearance by the band. Harris survives the fall but becomes paraplegic from his injuries.\n\nKelly devotes herself to caring for Harris and Emerson forgives Pet for her infidelity. Casey and Roxanne share a tender romance and Susan Lake is reunited with her former fianc\u00e9, Baxter Wolfe. This idyllic existence ends when {{nowrap|Z-Man}} invites Casey, Roxanne, and Lance to a [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]-fueled party at his house. After {{nowrap|Z-Man}} tries to seduce Lance, who spurns him, he reveals that he has breasts and is a female in drag.{{#tag:ref|To quote Roger Ebert: \"Readers who have seen ''BVD'' will know that {{nowrap|Z-Man}} is a rock Svengali who seems to be a gay man for most of the movie, but is finally revealed to be a woman in drag\".<ref name=ebertfest />|group=N}} {{nowrap|Z-Man}} goes on a murderous rampage: he kills Lance with a sword, stabs his servant Otto to death, and shoots Roxanne and Casey, killing them.\n\nResponding to a desperate phone call Casey made shortly before her death, Kelly, Harris, Pet, and Emerson arrive at {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} house to subdue him. Pet is wounded in the melee, which ends in {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} death. Harris is able to move his feet, the start of his recovery from paralysis.

She wrote a treatment and in June 1968 Fox wanted [[Dorothy Kingsley]] to write a screenplay but she was busy on ''[[Bracken's World]]''.<ref>Channing 'Frizzy' in Next Opus, Chicago Tribune, 24 June 1968: b10.</ref> In November, it was reported that [[Barbara Parkins]] would return in the film, but Patty Duke and Sharon Tate would not.<ref>Smog Gets the Blame Again NORMA LEE BROWNING, Chicago Tribune, 20 Nov 1968: b1.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969 Fox announced the film would be made in the next 18 months and would come from Irving Manfield Productions.<ref>20 FILMS SCHEDULED FOR SHOOTING AT FOX Los Angeles Times 23 June 1969: c18.</ref> A script was written by Jean Holloway.<ref name=\"jean\">Some New Faces in Crowd at Warner's Haber, Joyce.

Instead they hired [[Russ Meyer]], whose recent movie ''[[Vixen!]]'' had been a commercial success. Holloway's script was discarded and the film critic [[Roger Ebert]] took a five-week leave of absence from the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' to write a script. Parkins was no longer attached to the film.<ref name=\"jean\"/><ref>MOVE CALL SHEET: Director for 'Dolls' Sequel, Martin, Betty.

Film Comment; New York Vol. 9, Iss. 1 (Jan/Feb 1973): 35-46.</ref>\n\nThe script was not only a spoof of the original film, but also, in Ebert's words, \"a [[satire (film and television)|satire]] of Hollywood conventions, genres, situations, dialogue, characters, and success formulas, heavily overlaid with such shocking violence that some critics didn't know whether the movie 'knew' it was a comedy\".<ref name=ebertfest>Ebert, Roger.

Meyer wanted the film to appeal, in some way, to almost anyone who was under thirty and went to the movies. There had to be music, mod clothes, black characters, violence, romantic love, soap opera situations, behind-the-scenes intrigue, fantastic sets, lesbians, orgies, drugs and (eventually) an ending that tied everything together\".<ref name=\"script\"/>\n\nMeyer's intention was for the film to \"simultaneously be a satire, a serious melodrama, a rock musical, a comedy, a violent exploitation picture, a skin flick, and a moralistic expose (so soon after the [[Sharon Tate]] murders) of what the opening crawl called 'the oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business'\".<ref name=ebertfest />\n\nEbert later recalled:\n<blockquote>At the time we were working on BVD I didn't really understand how unusual the project was. But in hindsight I can recognize that the conditions of its making were almost miraculous. An independent X-rated filmmaker and an inexperienced screenwriter were brought into a major studio and given carte blanche to turn out a satire of one of the studio's own hits. And BVD was made at a time when the studio's own fortunes were so low that the movie was seen almost fatalistically, as a gamble that none of the more respectable studio executives really wanted to think about, so that there was a minimum of supervision (or even cognizance) from the Front Office.<ref name=\"roger\">Russ Meyer: Ten Years After the 'Beyond', Ebert, Roger.

The film began production on December 2, 1969, shortly after the murders, which were covered heavily by the media.<ref>McDonough 2006 pp.257, 262</ref> ''Valley of the Dolls'' star [[Sharon Tate]] was among the murder victims, as was [[Jay Sebring]].

Their back-story stated in ''BVD'' (\"He proposed to her but it was the wrong time\", \"It's been three years{{nbsp}}...\"), matches the ending of the original. Following Jacqueline Susann's legal-action proceedings against 20th Century Fox, the characters were renamed and recast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/features/story/mondo-culto-beyond-valley-dolls/21728390 |title=Mondo Culto: Beyond the Valley of the Dolls |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207193841/http://www.film.com/features/story/mondo-culto-beyond-valley-dolls/21728390 |archive-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> [[Barbara Parkins]], who played Anne, was originally under contract to appear in ''BVD'' and was disappointed when she was abruptly removed from the project.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=DCD Special Edition|work= Beyond The Valley of the Dolls|publisher= 20th Century Fox|page= 2|year= 2007}}</ref> The special edition DVD features a [[screen test]] with Michael Blodgett and Cynthia Myers enacting the bedroom scene between Lance and Kelly.

Some of the actors asked me whether their dialogue wasn't supposed to be humorous, but Meyer discussed it so seriously with them that they hesitated to risk offending him by voicing such a suggestion. The result is that BVD has a curious tone all of its own... from actors directed at right angles to the material\".<ref name=\"roger\"/>\n\nBecause the film was put together so quickly, some plot decisions, such as the character Z-Man being revealed as a woman in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Beyond the Valley of the Dolls Movie Review (1980) {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beyond-the-valley-of-the-dolls-1980 |website=www.rogerebert.com |access-date=20 September 2018 |language=en |archive-date=30 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230054847/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beyond-the-valley-of-the-dolls-1980 |url-status=live}}</ref> were made on the spot, without the chance to bring previous already-shot scenes into alignment with the new development.<ref name=ebertfest /> As they were shooting, the cast was uncertain whether the dialogue was intended to be comic or not, which would alter their approach to acting it. Because Meyer always discussed their roles and the film so seriously, they did not want to unintentionally insult him by asking, so they broached the question to Ebert, instead. Meyer's intention was to have the actors perform the material in a straightforward manner because \"if the actors perform as if they know they have funny lines, it won't work\". Ebert described the resulting tone as \"curious\".<ref name=ebertfest />\n\nIn 1980, Ebert looked back on the film and said of it:\n<blockquote>I think of it as an essay on our generic expectations. It's an anthology of stock situations, characters, dialogue, clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, set to music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; it's cause and effect, a wind-up machine to generate emotions, pure movie without message.<ref name=ebertfest /></blockquote>\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\nMost of the film's music was written by [[Stu Phillips (composer)|Stu Phillips]]. Phillips adapted [[Paul Dukas]]' ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' for the psychedelic scene at Z-Man's house near the film's end.<ref name=audioCD>''Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: The Original Soundtrack''. Liner notes from audio CD. Stu Phillips and Alex Patterson. Harkit: HRKCD 8032, 2003</ref>\n\nMembers of the fictitious Carrie Nations neither sing nor play their own instruments in the film. Vocals for the [[lip-sync]]ed songs were performed by [[Lynn Carey]] (Mama Lion), a [[blue-eyed soul]] singer based in Los Angeles, together with [[Barbara Robison]], the lead singer of [[Peanut Butter Conspiracy]]. Carey's and Robison's voices are showcased on the apocalyptic rocker \"Find It\" (by Stu Phillips and Carey),<ref name=afi /> the earnest folk anthem \"Come With the Gentle People\" (by Stu Phillips and Bob Stone),<ref name=afi /> the raunchy [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] of \"Sweet Talking Candyman\" (by Phillips and Stone),<ref name=afi /> the lilting ballad \"In the Long Run\" (by Phillips and Stone),<ref name=afi /> and the soulful strut of \"Look On Up At the Bottom\" (also by Phillips and Stone).<ref name=afi /> She also sings \"Once I had Love\", written by Stu Phillips and herself.<ref name=afi />\n\n[[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] performed their 1967 hit \"[[Incense and Peppermints (song)|Incense and Peppermints]]\", the mid-tempo rocker \"Girl from the City\" (written by Paul Marshall),<ref name=afi /> and the [[power pop]] anthem \"I'm Comin' Home\" (also by Marshall)<ref name=afi /> during the first party scene at Z-Man's house. The film's title song was performed by [[A&M Records|A&M]] artists [[The Sandpipers]] and is heard twice near the end of the movie. The group released the song as a single and on their 1970 ''[[Come Saturday Morning (The Sandpipers album)|Come Saturday Morning]]'' LP.\n\nDifferent versions of the soundtrack album exist because of disputes over royalties.<ref name=audioCD/> The original vinyl soundtrack, reissued in the early 2000s, substitutes Ami Rushes' vocals for Lynn Carey's originals, and includes one song, \"Once I Had Love\", not on the 2003 CD reissue. However, the CD edition of the soundtrack (Soundtrack Classics SCL 1408 and Harkit Records HRKCD 8032) contains 25 songs compared to the 12 songs on the vinyl version, with the original film versions plus Lynn Carey and Barbara Robison bonus tracks. Both labels also released vinyl editions with different covers and extended songs compared to the 1970 LP.\n\nThe song \"Once I Had A Love\" was released on the CD ''Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls/Groupie Girl (Screen Gold Records SGLDCD00010)'' along with the songs from the LP from 1970. The CD does not contain the original film versions, only the new recordings for the LP from 1970, with four songs by Ami Rushes and two by Barbara Robison. For the first time, all original film song versions are included, with original versions sung by Carey and Robison.\n\n\"Incense and Peppermints\", some incidental music, and the Strawberry Alarm Clock's [[Hammond organ]] instrumental \"Toy Boy\" are missing from all soundtrack releases.\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]] in Hollywood on June 17, 1970. Jacqueline Susann, author of the unconnected novel ''Valley of the Dolls'', sought an [[injunction]] against its release but failed.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Jacq. Susann Loses 'Beyond Dolls' Claim|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 17, 1970|page=2}}</ref>\n\nInitially the film was given an [[X rating]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]];<ref>{{cite book|last=Haines|first=Richard W. |title=The Moviegoing Experience, 1968-2001|publisher=McFarland|year=2003|page=48|isbn=0-7864-1361-1}}</ref> in [[1990 in film|1990]], it was reclassified as [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#NC-17|NC-17]]. Meyer's response to the original X rating was to attempt to re-edit the film to insert more nudity and sex, but Fox wanted to get the movie released quickly and would not give him the time.<ref name=ebertfest />\n\n===Lawsuit===\nSusann sued Fox for $10 million for damaging her reputation by making the film, saying that the \"sex exploitation film, employs total nudity and is scandalous of content\".<ref>Susann Suing, The Washington Post and Times-Herald, 28 Apr 1970: B16.</ref>\n\nAs a result, the studio placed a [[disclaimer]] at the beginning of the film informing the audience that the two films were not intended to be connected. Posters for the movie read, \"This is not a sequel\u2014there has '''never''' <!--this is boldface in the movie poster; please don't unbold it-->been anything like it\".\n\nThe suit did not go to trial until after Susann's death in September 1974.
