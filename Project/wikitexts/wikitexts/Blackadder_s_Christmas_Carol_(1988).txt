It is set between ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989), and is narrated by [[Hugh Laurie]]. Produced by the [[BBC]], it was first broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC1]] on 23 December 1988.\n<!--spacing, please do not remove-->\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ebenezer Blackadder]] ([[Rowan Atkinson]]), the Victorian proprietor of a \"[[moustache]] shop\", is the nicest man in England.<ref name=transcript>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackadderhall.com/?page_id=272 |title=Blackadder's Christmas Carol |website=Blackadder Hall |date=12 October 2011 |type=transcript |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531133447/http://www.blackadderhall.com/?page_id=272 |archivedate=2019-05-31 |access-date=2020-01-06 }}</ref> He is everything that [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] was by the end of the original story: generous and kind to everybody, and sensitive to the misery of others. As a result, people take advantage of his kindness \u2013 Mrs. Scratchit and an orphan take all his money, his god-daughter Millicent takes his presents and Christmas tree, and a [[beadle]] takes his food. All but [[Baldrick|Mr. Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) view him as a victim. His business turns no profit, all his earnings go to charity and con artists, and despite his positive attitude, he lives a lonely, miserable life.\n\nOne Christmas Eve, Blackadder's destiny changes when the Spirit of Christmas ([[Robbie Coltrane]]) visits him to congratulate him for his ways. The Spirit lets him see two shades of the past: his Blackadder ancestors (the protagonists of ''[[Blackadder II]]'' and ''[[Blackadder the Third]]''). Instead of providing [[positive reinforcement]] that Ebenezer is better than his forefathers, these visions lead him to admire them and their wit. He asks the Spirit to show him what could happen if he became like them. He sees a vision of a distant future where his descendant, [[Grand Admiral]] Blackadder, is a successful and ruthless official of a [[galactic empire]], about to marry the similarly ruthless and insanely ambitious Queen Asphyxia XIX ([[Miranda Richardson]]) after murdering her \"triple husbandoid\". The future Baldrick, wearing a [[loincloth]], is Blackadder's slave. Blackadder asks the Spirit what will happen if he stays as he is. He is shown an alternative future in which his descendant is the loincloth-clad slave of the incompetent Admiral Baldrick.\n\nContrary to the Spirit's intended point, Blackadder takes \"the very clear lesson that bad guys have all the fun\". On Christmas morning, he wakes up a different man: bitter, vengeful, greedy, and insulting to everyone he meets. Now feeling in control of his life, he misses an opportunity when he insults two strangers who claim to be [[Queen Victoria]] ([[Miriam Margolyes]]) and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] ([[Jim Broadbent]]) and throws them out of his home. The episode ends on Blackadder's extravagant Christmas dinner, which is ruined when Baldrick shows him the royal seal left behind by the strangers, proving Baldrick's story that the Queen and Prince Albert had planned to award Blackadder a gift of \u00a350,000 and the title of Baron Blackadder for being the \"nicest man in England\".<ref name=transcript/>\n\n=== Edited version ===\n{{Media IMDb refimprove|article section|date=August 2018}}\nMost versions{{specify|date=December 2015}} of this special edit Baldrick's speech about a dog being used as Jesus for the Nativity play to remove a line in which Baldrick says the dog will be nailed to a cross for Easter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094754/alternateversions |title=Alternate Versions |work=Blackadder's Christmas Carol (1988 TV Movie) |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106191727/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094754/alternateversions |archivedate=2020-01-06 |access-date=2020-01-06 |url-status=live }}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2015}}</ref> The earliest known case of this edit was on its first rerun in December 1989.
