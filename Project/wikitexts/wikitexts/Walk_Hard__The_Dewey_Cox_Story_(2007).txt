It stars [[John C. Reilly]], [[Jenna Fischer]], [[Tim Meadows]] and [[Kristen Wiig]]. A parody of the [[Biographical film|biopic]] genre, ''Walk Hard'' is the story of a fictional early rock and roll star played by Reilly.\n\n''Walk Hard'' primarily references the musical biopics ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' (2004) and ''[[Walk the Line]]'' (2005); in addition to [[Ray Charles]] and [[Johnny Cash]], the \"Dewey Cox\" character includes elements of the lives and careers of other notable musicians including [[Roy Orbison]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Donovan]], [[John Lennon]], [[James Brown]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Conway Twitty]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Hank Williams]], and [[Brian Wilson]]. The film portrays fictional versions of artists [[Buddy Holly]], [[The Big Bopper]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[the Beatles]]; some artists appear as themselves, including [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Ghostface Killah]]. In addition, the film parodies or pays tribute to the musical styles of [[David Bowie]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Van Dyke Parks]], and seventies punk rock.\n\nThe film was released in North America on December 21, 2007. It received positive reviews from critics but was a box office bomb, grossing only $20 million against a $35 million budget. The film has since become a [[cult classic]].<ref name=siegel>{{cite web |last= Siegel |first= Alan |title= Dewey Cox Ain't Dead: An Oral History of 'Walk Hard' |url= https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/5/29/18642513/walk-hard-dewey-cox-oral-history-john-c-reilly-music-biopic-jake-kasdan-judd-apatow |website= [[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |access-date= September 14, 2020 |date= May 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn Springberry, [[Alabama]], 1946, young Dewey Cox accidentally cuts his brother Nate in half with a [[machete]]. The trauma causes him to [[anosmia|lose his sense of smell]]. Dewey meets a [[blues]] guitarist who discovers his life experience instilled in him a natural affinity for playing blues.\n\nIn 1953, Dewey performs at a school [[talent show]] and drives the crowd wild with his song \"Take My Hand,\" and his father kicks him out of the house, calling it the \"[[Devil|Devil's]] [[Rock and Roll|music]]\". A 14-year-old Dewey leaves Springberry with his 12-year-old girlfriend Edith; they soon marry and have a baby. \n\nWorking at an all-[[African American]] nightclub, Dewey replaces singer Bobby Shad onstage and impresses [[Hasidic Jew]] record executive L'Chaim. While recording a [[rockabilly]] rendition of \"[[That's Amore]]\", he is berated by an executive. A desperate Dewey performs \"Walk Hard,\" a song inspired by a speech he gave Edith, which restores the executive's belief in Judaism and rockets him to superstardom.\n\nThe song quickly becomes a hit and Dewey becomes caught up in the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. He soon performs his first concert as the following act to [[Elvis Presley]], [[Buddy Holly]], and [[The Big Bopper]]. Dewey is introduced to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] by his drummer Sam and becomes unfaithful to Edith. Dewey's father informs him that his mother has died while dancing to Dewey's song and blames Dewey's music for her death. \n\nDistraught, Dewey finds Sam using [[cocaine]] and partakes, resulting in a cocaine-fueled [[punk rock]] performance. [[Choir]]-girl Darlene Madison enters Dewey's life, and he produces several sexually suggestive hit records amid their courtship. He weds Darlene while still married to Edith, which leads to both women leaving him, after which Dewey purchases drugs from an undercover cop. After he serves time in prison and in rehab, Darlene returns.\n\nThey move to [[Berkeley, California]] in 1966 during the [[1960s counterculture|counterculture]] movement. Dewey's new singing style is compared to that of [[Bob Dylan]], which he angrily denies. On a band visit to [[India]], Dewey takes [[LSD]] with [[the Beatles]], leading to a ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''-esque hallucination. \n\nDewey becomes consumed with creating his masterpiece ''Black Sheep'' (a homage to [[Brian Wilson]]'s ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''). The band resents his insane musical style and abusive behavior and breaks up; Darlene, also unable to deal with him, leaves him for [[Glen Campbell]]. During another stint in rehab, Dewey is visited by the ghost of Nate, who ridicules his self-pity and tells him to start writing songs again.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dewey now hosts a [[CBS]] [[variety television show]] but is unable to compose a masterpiece for his brother. Nate reappears and urges him to reconcile with their father. Dewey and his father wind up dueling with machetes; despite having trained years for this moment, his father cuts himself in half, forgives Dewey for Nate's death, tells him to be a better father, and dies. Dewey breaks down and destroys almost everything in his home.\n\nDewey is approached by one of his illegitimate children and decides to reconnect with his many offspring. In 1992, a divorced Darlene returns to him. Finally realizing what is most important, Dewey regains his sense of smell and remarries her.\n\nIn 2007, L'Chaim's son Dreidel informs Dewey of his popularity with young listeners through [[rapper]] Lil' Nutzzak's [[sampling (music)|sampling]] of \"Walk Hard.\" Dewey learns he is to receive a lifetime achievement award. They want him to sing a song at the ceremony, but Dewey is reluctant, fearing his old temptations. However, with his family's support, he reunites with his band and is finally able to create one great masterpiece, summing up his entire life with his final song, \"Beautiful Ride.\"\n\nA title card reveals that Dewey died three minutes after this final performance, which then also reads \"Dewford Randolph Cox, 1936\u20132007.\" A [[post-credits scene]] is a short black-and-white clip of \"the actual Dewey Cox, April 16, 2002\" (still played by Reilly).\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John C.
