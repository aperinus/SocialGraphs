It stars [[Elisabeth Shue]], [[Keith Coogan]], [[Anthony Rapp]], and [[Maia Brewton]], and features cameos by [[blues]] singer/guitarist [[Albert Collins]] and singer-songwriter [[Southside Johnny Lyon]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter her boyfriend Mike cancels their anniversary date, seventeen-year-old Chris Parker invites her friend Brenda over to her [[Oak Park, Illinois]], house to cheer her up, but is convinced by her mother to babysit the Andersons' daughter, eight-year-old Sarah, while they attend a party in downtown [[Chicago]]. Sarah's fifteen-year-old brother Brad is supposed to spend the night at his friend Daryl Coopersmith's house, but he changes his mind when he discovers that Chris is the sitter. After receiving a frantic phone call from Brenda, who ran away to a downtown bus station, Chris plans to go alone to pick her up, but is coerced by Brad, Sarah, and Daryl to take them with her. On the freeway, their station wagon suffers a flat tire and they are picked up by a tow truck driver, \"Handsome\" John Pruitt, who offers to pay for the tire when Chris realizes she left her purse at the Andersons'. En route, Pruitt receives a call from his boss Dawson with evidence that his wife is cheating on him, and he rushes to his house to confront the infidelity; Chris' mother's car is damaged when Pruitt accidentally shoots out the windshield while aiming to kill his wife's lover with his [[snubnosed revolver]]. Chris and the kids hide in the adulterer's Cadillac, which is then stolen by a car thief named Joe Gipp.\n\nReaching their hideout in the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], the kids realize they have stumbled upon a large multi-state stolen car operation, and Joe is chided by Graydon, the operation's second-in-command, for bringing witnesses. They are detained in an upstairs office but escape. They enter a blues club where the band on stage refuses to let them leave until they perform a blues number. The group spontaneously recounts their events while accompanied on instrument by [[Albert Collins]], causing the audience to sing along and happily applaud. They leave just as Joe, Graydon and his boss Bleak arrive in the club, whose owners stall them.\n\nBrad tells Chris about his feelings toward her, and is disappointed to learn he is too young for her. After separating Daryl from a [[streetwalker]] who is a runaway, Chris is reminded of Brenda. They are found and chased again by Graydon and Bleak but escape on the [[Chicago \"L\"]] train and wind up in the middle of a gang fight. Brad is injured when one of the gang leaders throws a [[switchblade]] onto his foot. They take Brad to the university hospital, where he receives a stitch. They run into Pruitt, who is now on the run from his earlier attacks; he tells the kids he replaced the windshield, but Dawson wants $50 for the tire. The kids come across a fraternity house party, and Chris becomes attracted to Dan Lynch, a gentleman who learns of Chris' problem and donates $45. He takes them to Dawson's Garage and drops them off.\n\nWhen they find Dawson, his blond hair and sledgehammer led Sarah to believe he is [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], her favorite superhero. He denies them their car because of the $5 shortage, but when Sarah offers him her toy Thor helmet, he changes his mind and lets them go. Meanwhile, Joe Gipp tells Bleak about their troubles, and the three are waiting to follow them. The kids find the restaurant where Mike was supposed to take Chris and discover he is with another girl. Sarah slips away to look at a toy store while Chris yells at Mike. Brad stands up for Chris but is reluctant to hit Mike, so Daryl kicks Mike into a table, ruining his dinner and causing a commotion. Bleak spots Sarah, and Graydon chases her to an office building where she hides; the others note her disappearance and follow, accidentally coming across the Andersons' party. After Sarah climbs out an open window and slides down the building, Chris spots her and they run upstairs to help.\n\nAfter the group pulls Sarah from outside the window, Bleak confronts them. Joe knocks his boss out, before giving him a ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine that Daryl had stolen, which contained important notes that the criminals wanted. The kids retrieve Brenda from the bus station and rush home, narrowly avoiding the Andersons on [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|Interstate 290]]. Once home, Chris cleans up the mess left earlier, settling into place just as the Andersons enter. As Chris says goodnight to the kids, Brad tells her he understands about her not feeling the same way he did about her and tells her that if they see each other at school the next day, it is okay if she ignores him. However, Chris smiles and tells him she does not ignore her friends. Just as Chris is leaving, Dan arrives with one of Sarah's missing skates. He says he needs a babysitter and is disappointed when Chris says she is retired; he confesses the babysitter was for him. Chris decides that retirement can wait and gladly agrees to babysit Dan. With Sarah's encouragement, Chris and Dan kiss outside as Brad closes the blinds.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Graydon is shown standing on the ledge, still trying to find his way to safety.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Christina \"Chris\" Parker\n* [[Keith Coogan]] as Brad Anderson\n* [[Anthony Rapp]] as Daryl Coopersmith\n* [[Maia Brewton]] as Sarah Anderson\n* [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Brenda\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Mike Todwell\n* [[Calvin Levels]] as Joe Gipp\n* [[George Newbern]] as Dan Lynch, a college student\n* [[John Davis Chandler|John Chandler]] as Bleak\n* [[Ron Canada]] as Graydon, Bleak's second in command\n* [[John Ford Noonan]] as \"Handsome\" John Pruitt\n* [[Albert Collins]] as himself; a player in a Chicago Blues club\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Dawson\n* [[Southside Johnny Lyon|Southside Johnny]] as band leader at frat party\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as LuAnn\n* [[Clark Johnson]] as gang leader\n* [[Andrew Shue]] as guy at frat party\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFor his directorial debut, Columbus said he reviewed a hundred scripts.
