Directed by [[Mick Garris]] from King's teleplay, it is the second adaptation of King's book after [[The Shining (film)|the 1980 film]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and was written and produced by King based on his dissatisfaction with Kubrick's version. The miniseries was shot at [[The Stanley Hotel]] in [[Estes Park, Colorado]], King's inspiration for the novel, in March 1996.\n\nThe 1997 adaptation stars [[Steven Weber]] as [[Jack Torrance]]; [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Jack's wife [[Wendy Torrance|Wendy]]; [[Courtland Mead]] and [[Wil Horneff]] as different-aged versions of [[Danny Torrance]]; and [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as [[Dick Hallorann]]. [[Pat Hingle]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[John Durbin]], [[Stanley Anderson]], [[Lisa Thornhill]], and Garris' wife Cynthia appear in supporting roles. Several notable writers and filmmakers working in the [[horror genre]] cameo in the miniseries' ballroom scene, and King himself appears as an orchestra conductor.\n\nOriginally airing from April 27 to May 1, 1997 on the American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''The Shining'' enjoyed a favorable reception when it first aired. It was a ratings hit, being in the top 20 of daily viewership numbers for all three episodes; acclaimed by critics for its careful pacing, makeup, depth, sound editing and creepy atmosphere; and won two [[Primetime Emmy Award|Primetime Emmy]] and two [[Saturn Awards]]. However, retrospective critics have viewed the miniseries less fondly, comparing it unfavorably to Kubrick's film version.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Torrance]]'s alcoholism and explosive temper have cost him his teaching job at Stovington, a respectable prep school. He is also on the verge of losing his family, after assaulting his young son [[Danny Torrance|Danny]] in a drunken rage just a year earlier. Horrified by what he has become, Jack tells his wife [[Wendy Torrance|Wendy]] that should he ever start drinking again, he will leave them one way or another, implying that he would rather commit [[suicide]] than continue living as an alcoholic.\n\nNow, nursing a life of sobriety and pulling in work as a writer, Jack takes on the job of looking after the Overlook Hotel, a large colonial building in a picturesque valley in the [[Southern Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rockies]]. Jack believes that the job will provide desperately needed funds and give him the time to complete his first [[Play (theatre)|play]].\n\nUpon entering the Overlook and meeting its head cook, [[Dick Hallorann]], Danny discovers that his psychic powers grant him a form of [[telepathy]]. Danny has an adult mentor named Tony who talks to him in his visions and shows him the future. Hallorann tells Danny that he too \"shines\", and that Danny can contact him telepathically anytime he needs assistance. The Torrances are given a tour of the Overlook before being left alone in the hotel for the winter.\n\nIt gradually becomes evident that there is a malevolent force within the hotel that seems determined to use Danny for an unknown, possibly sinister purpose. This force manifests itself with flickering lamps and spectral voices and eventually a full-on masked ball from the Overlook's past. Danny is the first to fully notice the darker character of the hotel, having experienced visions and warnings that foreshadow what he and his parents will encounter over the winter.\n\nThe ghosts also appear to Jack, led by Delbert Grady, the Overlook's former steward who murdered his entire family and killed himself at the hotel's command. Grady and the other spirits tell Jack that Wendy and Danny are turning against him, and that his only option is to kill them. They also supply him with an open bar, and he begins drinking again. As Jack's sanity deteriorates, Wendy begins to fear for her and Danny's safety.\n\nHallorann, whom Danny had contacted telepathically, travels from Florida to Colorado, only to be assaulted by Jack with a croquet mallet and left for dead. Danny telepathically communicates with his father, who momentarily breaks free of the ghosts' grip, and then tells him that the old boiler has been neglected. Danny, Wendy, and Hallorann (who had only been stunned by the attack) escape to safety. Jack sacrifices himself to prevent the ghosts from repossessing him and allows the boiler to explode and destroy the Overlook.\n\nTen years later, Danny graduates from high school, showing that Tony was Danny's adult incarnate self. Wendy and Halloran are present at the ceremony. Jack's spirit is also present, looking on Danny with pride. Back in Colorado, the Overlook is being rebuilt as a resort for the summer, as the ghosts of the original hotel await potential victims.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steven Weber]] as [[Jack Torrance]]\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as [[Wendy Torrance]]\n* [[Courtland Mead]] as [[Danny Torrance]]\n** [[Wil Horneff]] as Tony; Danny adult\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as [[Dick Hallorann]]\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Pete Watson\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Stuart Ullman\n* [[John Durbin]] as Horace Derwent\n* [[Stanley Anderson]] as Delbert Grady\n* Cynthia Garris as Lorraine Massey (Woman in Room 217)\n* [[Lisa Thornhill]] as [[Rita Hayworth]] Look-alike\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Mark James Torrance\n* [[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]] as Doctor Daniel Edwards\n* Jan Van Sickle as Al Shockley\n\nSeveral of Garris' colleagues who work in the [[horror genre]] cameo in the miniseries' ballroom scene, such as [[David J.
