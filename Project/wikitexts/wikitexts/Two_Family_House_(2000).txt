Many of the film's actors later reached national prominence as part of the [[HBO]] cable [[television series]] ''[[The Sopranos]]'', including [[Michael Rispoli]], [[Kathrine Narducci]], [[Matt Servitto]], [[Vincent Pastore]], [[Joseph R. Gannascoli]], [[Sharon Angela]] and [[Michele Santopietro]] (Jackie Aprile, Sr., Charmaine Bucco, Agent Harris, Big Pussy, Vito Spatafore, Rosalie Aprile and JoJo Palmice, respectively, in ''The Sopranos''). The songs on the film's soundtrack were done by [[John Pizzarelli]] and his trio, a [[jazz]] recording artist.\n\n==Plot==\n\nAn unseen narrator (who we gradually come to learn is telling the story of his mother and step-father's romance) looks back to the year 1956, in the [[Elm Park, Staten Island|Elm Park]] neighborhood of [[Staten Island, New York]], to one Buddy Visalo ([[Michael Rispoli]]), an Italian guy with \"[[The Honeymooners|Ralph Kramdenesque]]\" dreams. Buddy is a wannabe crooner (with a voiceover provided by [[Andrew Poretz]]). Buddy had nearly been discovered by [[Arthur Godfrey]] ten years earlier (shown in flashback) when he performed at a [[USO]] show while in the service. His fianc\u00e9e, Estelle ([[Kathrine Narducci]]), gave him a Hobson's choice: \u201cWho's it gonna be, Buddy, Arthur Godfrey or me?\u201d In a decision he\u2019ll live to regret the rest of his life, he chooses Estelle, and over the next 10 years tries all sorts of schemes to get ahead. \u201cI just wanna be somebody!\u201d he\u2019ll declare.\n\nItalian-American Buddy decides to buy a dilapidated two-family house in the Irish section of town, intending to live upstairs with his wife Estelle and run a bar downstairs, where he could live out a smaller version of his dream, singing along to a \"Music Minus One\" jukebox (a precursor to karaoke). Estelle has no confidence in Buddy, just wants a \u201cnormal\u201d blue-collar husband who, most of all, won't \"embarrass\" her by doing anything to make himself stand out, and manages to undermine his plans time and time again. He discovers, to his dismay and her horror, that the upstairs Irish tenants, a drunken, violent older man (played by [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]) and his very pregnant young wife (played by [[Kelly Macdonald]] of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' fame) refuse to move and won't pay rent.\n\nWhen the baby is born, it's clear his father is black \u2013 and the much older, drunken Irish husband immediately skulks off, knowing it's not his child. Buddy evicts mother and child, then feels guilt and sets her up in an apartment while she sorts out an adoption. Estelle's lack of faith, the small-minded prejudices and low ambitions of his \u201cfriends,\u201d the Irish lass's spirit, Buddy's dream, racial prejudice, and the baby's fate play out in an engaging story with real chemistry between the leads and a message that ultimately exemplifies a [[Joseph Campbell]]-like \"Follow your bliss.\"\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* {{IMDb title|0202641|Two Family House}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|two_family_house}}\n* {{Mojo title|twofamilyhouse}}\n* {{Amg movie|186636|Two Family House}}\n\n{{Raymond De Felitta}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Raymond De Felitta]]\n[[Category:2000 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
