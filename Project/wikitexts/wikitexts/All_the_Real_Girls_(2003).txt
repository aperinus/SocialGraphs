He still lives with his mother, Elvira, who works as a clown cheering up children at the local hospital. \n\nPaul spends most of his time hanging out with his best friend and self-proclaimed partner-in-crime, Tip, and their friends Bo and Bust-Ass. Among his friends, Paul has a reputation as a ladies' man, but is not at all known for being involved with long-term relationships; most of his romances last only a few weeks, and he's slept with nearly every girl in town. \n\nBeginning to reach a point where he would like to lead a different life, this feeling becomes much clearer when Paul meets Noel. She is Tip's teenage sister, who has returned home after attending boarding school. Noel is more thoughtful and mature than the girls Paul is used to. \n\nPaul and Noel soon fall in love, but for him this is a different sort of relationship than he's accustomed to \u2014 Noel is still a virgin, and her contemplative nature gives him a desire to be a better, stronger person, \n\nTip does not approve of Paul dating his younger sister, which leads to a rift between these longtime friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing| \n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as Paul \n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Noel\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Tip\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Bust-ass\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Elvira\n* Benjamin Mouton as Uncle Leland\n* Maurice Compte as Bo\n* [[Heather McComb]] as Mary-Margaret\n* [[The Brothers Chaps|Matthew Chapman]] as Strong Bad\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Box office ===\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\n''All the Real Girls'' was given a [[Limited theatrical release|limited release]] on February 14, 2003.
