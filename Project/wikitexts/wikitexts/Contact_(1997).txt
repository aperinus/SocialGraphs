Sagan and his wife [[Ann Druyan]] wrote the story outline for the film. It stars [[Jodie Foster]] as Dr. Eleanor \"Ellie\" Arroway, a [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] scientist who finds evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]] and is chosen to make [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]]. It also stars [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[James Woods]], [[Tom Skerritt]], [[William Fichtner]], [[John Hurt]], [[Angela Bassett]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Jake Busey]], and [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]. It features the [[Very Large Array]] in New Mexico, the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in Puerto Rico, the ''[[Mir]]'' space station, and the [[Space Coast]] surrounding Cape Canaveral.\n\nSagan and Druyan began working on ''Contact'' in 1979. They wrote a [[film treatment]] over 100 pages long and set up the project at [[Warner Bros.]] with [[Peter Guber]] and [[Lynda Obst]] as producers. When [[development (film)|development]] stalled, Sagan published ''Contact'' as a novel in 1985, and the film reentered development in 1989. [[Roland Joff\u00e9]] and [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]] had planned to direct, but Joff\u00e9 dropped out in 1993, and Warner Bros. fired Miller in 1995. With Zemeckis as director, filming ran from September 1996 to February 1997. [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] handled most of the visual effects.\n\n''Contact'' was released on July 11, 1997, and grossed over $171&nbsp;million worldwide. It won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] and several [[Saturn Award]]s.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nDr. Ellie Arroway works for the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] program at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. Guided into science and communication\u2014starting with [[amateur radio]]\u2014by her late father, she listens to radio emissions from space, hoping to detect evidence of intelligent [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]]. David Drumlin, the president's science advisor, pulls the funding from SETI, believing the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains financial backing from Hadden Industries, run by secretive billionaire industrialist S.&nbsp;R. Hadden, which allows her to continue the project at the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] (VLA) in [[New Mexico]].\n\nFour years later, with Drumlin about to end the SETI program at the VLA, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a sequence of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system [[Vega]] about 26 [[light-years]] away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] led by Michael Kitz to attempt to take control of the facility. Arroway's team discovers a video hidden in the signal&nbsp;\u2013 [[Adolf Hitler]]'s opening address at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin, Germany. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first signal strong enough to leave Earth's [[ionosphere]], reach Vega, and be transmitted back.\n\nThe project is put under tight security, and its progress is followed worldwide. Arroway finds that the signal also contains more than 63,000 pages of data. The reclusive S.&nbsp;R. Hadden secretly meets with Arroway to provide the means to decode the pages. The pages reveal schematics for a complex machine that is determined to be some kind of transport for a single occupant.\n\nMultiple nations fund the construction of the machine at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Cape Canaveral]]. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Arroway is a frontrunner to go until [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico, brings attention to her [[atheism]]; the panel selects Drumlin as more representative of humanity. When the machine is first tested, a religious terrorist destroys the machine in a [[Suicide attack|suicide bombing]], killing Drumlin and several others.\n\nHadden, now in residence on the ''[[Mir]]'' space station and dying of cancer, reveals to Arroway that the U.S. government had contracted with his company to secretly build a second machine in Japan, and that as the only American remaining among the candidate pool, Arroway will be the one to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into three rapidly spinning [[gimbaled]] rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of [[wormhole]]s. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of [[Pensacola, Florida]]. A figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.\n\nArroway falls unconscious as she begins traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens to find herself on the floor of the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears that the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18&nbsp;hours, but her recording devices show only noise. A [[United States congressional committee|Congressional Committee]] is formed and speculates that the signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private online conversation, Kitz and [[White House]] official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18&nbsp;hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support at the VLA.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Dr. Eleanor \"Ellie\" Ann Arroway\n** [[Jena Malone]] as young Ellie\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Palmer Joss\n* [[David Morse]] as Theodore Arroway\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Dr. David Drumlin\n* [[James Woods]] as Michael Kitz\n* [[John Hurt]] as S.

It is noted as one of the film's most impressive visual effects due to the seamlessness of the transition. According to Carin-Anne Strohmaier, first assistant film editor, the shot was created through three different [[Photographic plate|plates]] and digitally manipulated in CGI to create the effect: one plate was from the cameraman leading Ellie, the second of Ellie opening the cabinet door (which was a blue screen instead of a mirror), and the third of the reflection of the photograph of Ellie and her dad when the door closes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.slashfilm.com/contact-mirror-shot/ | title = You Probably Didn't Notice This Shot in 'Contact' Was Done with Visual Effects | first = Ethan | last = Anderton | date = January 17, 2017 | access-date = January 9, 2018 | work = [[/Film]] | archive-date = January 10, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180110114646/http://www.slashfilm.com/contact-mirror-shot/ | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nIn the sequence with the death of Ellie's father, they planned to use an effect similar to [[bullet time]] from ''[[The Matrix]]'' to show him stopped in time as he died. As the movie was filmed, they found the approach didn't fit the casting or the direction the film was going. They decided it would be most effective to create something distressing but with Ellie's dad absent from the shot, leading to the development of the mirror sequence.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://vfxblog.com/2017/07/10/the-famous-mirror-shot-in-contact-was-almost-something-else-entirely/ | title = The famous mirror shot in 'Contact' was almost something else entirely | first = Ian | last = Failes | date = July 10, 2017 | access-date = January 9, 2018 | work = VGX Blog | archive-date = January 10, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180110054816/https://vfxblog.com/2017/07/10/the-famous-mirror-shot-in-contact-was-almost-something-else-entirely/ | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe decoding of the extraterrestrial message, with its architectural drawings of the machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. It was Zemeckis's and Ralston's sixth film collaboration. Imageworks created more than 350 visual effect shots, using a combination of model and miniature shots and digital graphics. On designing the Machine, Zemeckis said, \"The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable... It had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be tinkering with. It had to look absolutely real.\"<ref name=\"Tech\" /> The machine was then designed by concept artist Steve Burg, reusing a design he created as a \"time-displacement device\" for an unused scene in [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|''Terminator 2'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.steveburg.com/film_tv.html |title=Steve Burg homepage |access-date=September 9, 2009 |work=Steve Burg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215063502/http://www.steveburg.com/film_tv.html |archive-date=December 15, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nEarly conceptual designs of the Pod were based, as in the novel, on one of the primary shapes in geometry: a [[dodecahedron]], or a twelve-sided body. Eventually it was modified to a spherical capsule that encased the traveler, with a dodecahedron surrounding the sphere. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] at [[Merritt Island]] adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral]], where officials gave them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]] before the launch of the Space Shuttle,<ref name=\"Tech\" /> where they studied the mechanics of the elevator, gantry area and loading arm for the design of the Machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod, elevator interior and gantry, which took almost four months. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.<ref name=\"Tech\" />\n\nThe climactic scene depicting the mysterious beach near the galactic core where Arroway makes contact, in particular, called for major visual innovations. The goal was an idyllic seashore with a sky blazing with stars that might exist near the core of the galaxy. Ralston said that \"the thought was that this beach would have a heightened reality. One that might make the everyday world seem like a vague daydream.\"<ref name=cinema/> To keep the question alive whether any of it was real in Arroway's mind, elements such as ocean waves running in reverse and palm tree shadows swaying with sped-up motion were applied.<ref name=cinema/>\n\nThe Hitler newsreel also required digital manipulation.<ref name=cinema/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Contact: Music from the Motion Picture\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Alan Silvestri\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start date|1997|8|19}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Warner Bros.

A point of discussion is the [[existence of God]], with several different positions being portrayed.<ref name=cinema/> A description of an emotionally intense [[religious experience|experience]] by Palmer Joss, which he describes as seeing God, is met by Arroway's suggestion that \"some part of [him] needed to have it\"\u2014that it was a significant personal experience but indicative of nothing greater. Joss compares his certainty that God exists to Arroway's certainty that she loved her deceased father, despite her being unable to prove it.<ref name=cinema/>\n\n''Contact'' depicts intense debate occurring as a result of the apparent contact with aliens. Many clips of well-known debate shows such as ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' and ''[[Larry King Live]]'' are shown, with participants discussing the implications of the message, asking whether it is proof of the existence of alien life or of God, and whether science is encroaching upon religious ground by, as one believer puts it, \"talking to your god for you\".<ref name=comment/> The head of a religious organization casts doubt on the morality of building the machine, noting: \"We don't even know whether [the aliens] believe in God.\" The first machine is ultimately destroyed by a religious extremist, in the belief that building it was detrimental to humankind.<ref name=cinema/>\n\nAlthough the revelation at the end of the film that Arroway's recording device recorded approximately 18 hours of noise is arguably conclusive proof of the fact of\u2014if not the experience of\u2014her \"journey\", several coincidences and indications throughout the film cast doubt on its authenticity. Director Robert Zemeckis indicated: \"The point of the movie is for there always to be a certain amount of doubt [as to whether the aliens were real].\"<ref name=comment/> These indications consist mostly of visual cues during the \"journey\" that echo Ellie's experiences earlier in the film (which Ellie believed to be the result of the aliens \"downloading [her] thoughts and memories\"), but the timing of the message's arrival and its eventual decoding are also highly coincidental: the message was first received shortly before Arroway and her team were to be ejected from the VLA facility and was successfully decoded only by S. R. Hadden (Arroway's only sponsor, who was close to death from cancer) after weeks of failed attempts by the team at the VLA.<ref name=comment/>\n\nAt the end of the film, Arroway is put into a position that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.<ref name=comment/>\n\nZemeckis stated that he intended the message of the film to be that science and religion can coexist rather than being opposing camps,<ref name=comment>[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Steve Starkey]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 1997, [[Warner Home Video]].</ref> as shown by the coupling of scientist Arroway with the religious Joss, as well as his acceptance that the \"journey\" indeed took place. This, and scattered references throughout the film, posit that science and religion are not nominally incompatible: one interviewer, after asking Arroway whether the construction of the machine\u2014despite not knowing what will happen when it is activated\u2014is too dangerous, suggests that it is being built on the \"faith\" that the alien designers, as Arroway puts it, \"know what they're doing\".<ref name=cinema/>\n\n==Release and reception==\n[[File:Contact uniforms.jpg|thumb|Uniforms from the film at [[Stockholm International Fairs]] 2011]]\n''Contact''{{'}}s release in July 1997 rekindled public interest in Sagan's 1985 [[Contact (novel)|novel]].

Twelve years later, an article by a NASA scientist [[David S.

This is the product of years of exploration ...''[words cut]''... by some of the world's most distinguished scientists. Like all discoveries, this one will and should continue to be reviewed, examined, and scrutinized. It must be confirmed by other scientists. But clearly, the fact that something of this magnitude is being explored is another vindication ...''[film scene performed over recording, with dialogue obscuring Clinton's remarks and creating a gap]''... If this discovery is confirmed, it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered. Its implications are as far reaching and awe inspiring as can be imagined. Even as it promises answers to some of our oldest questions, it poses still others even more fundamental. We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say as we continue the search for answers and for knowledge that is as old as humanity itself but essential to our people's future.

William J. Clinton at The American Presidency Project, October 7, 1994.</ref>\n{{blockquote|I would encourage you not to inflame this situation beyond the facts. Let us deal with this on the facts. We are monitoring what has actually happened.}}\n\nOn July 14, 1997, three days after the film opened in the United States, Warner Bros. received a letter from [[White House Counsel]] [[Charles Ruff]] protesting against the use of Clinton's digitally-composited appearance. The letter made no demands, but called the duration and manner of Clinton's appearance \"inappropriate\". No legal action was planned; the White House Counsel simply wanted to send a message to Hollywood to avoid unauthorized uses of the President's image. Zemeckis was reminded that official White House policy \"prohibits the use of the President in any way ... (that) implies a direct ... connection between the President and a commercial product or service\".<ref name=Willy/>\n\nA Warner Bros. spokeswoman explained: \"We feel we have been completely frank and upfront with the White House on this issue. They saw scripts, they were notified when the film was completed, they were sent a print well in advance of the film's July 11 opening, and we have confirmation that a print was received there July 2.\" However, Warner Bros. did concede that they never pursued or received formal release from the White House for the use of Clinton's image. While the Counsel commented that parody and satire are protected under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], press secretary [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]] believed that \"there is a difference when the President's image, which is his alone to control, is used in a way that would lead the viewer to believe he has said something he really didn't say\".<ref name=Willy/>\n\n===CNN===\nShortly after the White House's complaint, [[CNN]] chairman, president, and CEO [[Tom Johnson (journalist)|Tom Johnson]] announced he believed that in hindsight it was a mistake to allow 13 members of CNN's on-air staff (including [[John Holliman]], [[Larry King]] and [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]]) to appear in the film, even though both CNN and Warner Bros. are owned by [[Time Warner]]. Johnson added that, for ''Contact'', the CNN presence \"creates the impression that we're manipulated by Time Warner, and it blurs the line\". CNN then changed their policies for future films, which now require potential appearances to be cleared through their ethics group.<ref name=Willy>{{cite news | author = Staff | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1116676904 | title = Cameo crisis on 'Contact' | date = July 15, 1997 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date = January 26, 2009 | archive-date = October 25, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025010704/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116676904 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Lawsuits===\nDirector [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]], who had developed ''Contact'' with Warner Bros. before Zemeckis' hiring, unsuccessfully sued the studio over [[breach of contract]] policies.<ref name=making/>\n\nDuring filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker [[Francis Ford Coppola]] filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the previous week.<ref name=Cope/><ref name=Scott/> Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special<ref name=diss/> back in 1975,<ref name=Cope/> titled ''First Contact''. Under their development agreement,<ref name=diss/> Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan would write, with [[American Zoetrope]] and the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]]. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon and Schuster published ''Contact'', and Warner moved forward with development of a film adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.<ref name=Cope>{{cite news | author = Staff | url = https://variety.com/1996/scene/vpage/zoetrope-sues-over-contact-1117436227/| title = Zoetrope sues over 'Contact' | date = December 30, 1996 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date = September 30, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres dismissed Coppola's claim. Although Torres agreed that Sagan violated some terms of the contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit,<ref name=diss>{{cite news | author = Paul Karon | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117467799 | title = Coppola's 'Contact' claim is dismissed | date = February 17, 1998 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date = January 28, 2009 | archive-date = October 25, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025010840/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117467799 | url-status = live }}</ref> taking it to the [[California Courts of Appeal]] (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola's claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over ''Contact''.<ref name=Scott>{{cite news | author = Janet Shprintz | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117780544 | title = Coppola loses 'Contact' | date = February 13, 2000 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date = January 28, 2009 | archive-date = October 25, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121025010810/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117780544 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===NASA===\nThe scene where the [[NASA]] scientists give Arroway the \"[[Suicide pill|cyanide pill]]\" caused some controversy during production and when the film came out. [[Gerald D. Griffin]], the film's NASA advisor, insisted that NASA has never given any astronaut a cyanide pill \"just in case\", and that if an astronaut truly wished to commit suicide in space, all they would have to do is cut off their oxygen supply.<ref name=comment/> However, Carl Sagan insisted that NASA did indeed give out cyanide pills, and they did it for every mission an astronaut has ever flown. Zemeckis said that because of the two radically different assertions, the truth is unknown, but he left the suicide pill scene in the movie, as it seemed more suspenseful that way, and it was also in line with Sagan's beliefs and vision of the film.<ref name=comment/> Along with being NASA Technical Consultant for the project, Griffin had a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the role of \"Dynamics\" in Mission Control. He was a technical advisor for Ron Howard's 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]''. While working for NASA during the [[Apollo Program]], he was a flight director for that mission, among others, and in the 1980s was director of the [[Johnson Space Center]].\n\n===SETI===\nSETI.org published a review of the film in 2011, where they gave a side-by-side chart of a few relevant details from the film, and how they differed from reality.<ref name=\"setiorg\" /> One example being that, despite having 27 radio telescopes, the VLA is actually smaller and less sensitive than the Arecibo Observatory\u2014making Arecibo a better location for SETI work, if possibly a less photogenic filming location than the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|VLA]]. Despite these small inconsistencies, they maintained that \"''Contact'' is indescribably more accurate in its depiction of SETI than any Hollywood film in history.\"\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|List of films featuring space stations}}\n* {{annotated link|Wow! signal}}\n* [[List of films featuring extraterrestrials]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book | author = Keay Davidson | title = Carl Sagan: A Life | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-471-25286-7 | location = New York City | url = https://archive.org/details/carlsaganlife00davi }}\n* Tibbetts, John C., and James M.
