It is based on the rapid rise and fall of 1960s [[underground film]] star and socialite [[Edie Sedgwick]] (played by [[Sienna Miller]]), known for her [[Warhol superstar|association]] with the artist [[Andy Warhol]] ([[Guy Pearce]]).\n\nThe film premiered in Los Angeles on December 29, 2006, to largely negative reviews from critics, who nonetheless praised Miller's performance as Sedgwick.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is framed by [[Edie Sedgwick]] being interviewed in a hospital several years after her time as an [[Warhol superstar|Andy Warhol superstar]].\n\nIn the mid 1960s, Edie is a young heiress studying art in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. She moves to [[New York City]] with her friend, [[Chuck Wein]]. She is introduced to [[pop art]] painter and film-maker [[Andy Warhol]], who is intrigued by the beautiful, clearly troubled socialite. He asks her to perform in one of his underground, [[experimental films]]. She agrees and goes on to star in several of Andy's projects, becoming his [[Muse#Modern use|muse]].\n\nShe and Chuck become part of the tightly knit, bohemian social scene at Andy's famous art studio, [[the Factory|the Silver Factory]]. Edie's status as a Warhol superstar and rising [[youthquake (movement)|youthquake]] fashion model earn her fame and international attention. The success, however, fails to ease her psychological issues. Although descended from a prestigious family lineage and raised on an idyllic, California ranch, Edie was [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by her father during childhood. She has been further shaken by the fairly recent death of her favorite brother, Minty. Her trauma manifests itself in [[Shopping addiction|uncontrolled spending]], poor money management and a burgeoning drug habit.\n\nEdie's Cambridge friend, Syd visits her in New York City and introduces her to folk singer Billy Quinn, a character based on [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=\"Dylan's got it wrong about my movie, says Sienna\" /> Edie and Billy begin a relationship, which causes Andy to become jealous. Edie attempts to make peace between the two men by arranging a screen test for Billy at Andy's Factory. When Billy and his posse arrive, they act disrespectfully towards Andy. Billy and Edie fight and he tells her that Andy is a \"bloodsucker\" who will \"kill\" her. She tearfully responds that she \"can't hate him.\" Realizing that she has chosen Andy over him, Billy leaves her.\n\nEdie's worsening drug addiction begins taking its toll. Her relationship with Andy deteriorates and she becomes a [[Outcast (person)|pariah]] among the Factory crowd. One night, while in a drug-induced stupor, she falls asleep with a lit cigarette and nearly dies in the ensuing apartment fire. ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', which once championed her as the newest [[It girl|\"it\" girl]], now refuses to hire her; editor [[Diana Vreeland]] explains that Edie is considered \"vulgar\" due to her current lifestyle.\n\nWhen Syd visits Edie again, she is barely conscious and is being filmed naked by three strangers in her apartment. Syd kicks the men out and looks after Edie. He gets them a taxi and shows her a photo of herself back in Cambridge. He says she inspired him back then and she can be an artist once more. Edie, deeply upset at how far she's fallen, gets out of their cab and runs frantically down the street.\n\nThe scene transitions to the film's opening [[framing device]] of the hospital interview several years later. Edie tells the interviewer that to \"stay off the drugs\" is going to be a battle every day, that she is pursuing art again and is glad to be home in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. The closing captions explain that in her last few years Edie continued in her struggle with dependency. Her short marriage to a fellow patient ended when she died of a [[Barbiturate#Recreational use|barbiturate overdose]] at the age of 28.\n\nMeanwhile, in New York City, Andy is interviewed the day after Edie died in 1971. When the interviewer asks about her and Andy's \"breakup,\" Andy becomes visibly uncomfortable but manages to complete his thought that it was just so long ago and he hardly knew her at all.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as [[Edie Sedgwick]]\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as [[Andy Warhol]]\n* [[Hayden Christensen]] as Billy Quinn, \"the musician\" (character based on [[Bob Dylan]]<ref name=\"Dylan's got it wrong about my movie, says Sienna\">{{cite news |date= December 30, 2006 |last= Smith |first= David |title= Dylan's got it wrong about my movie, says Sienna |newspaper= The Guardian |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/31/musicnews.film |access-date= April 20, 2020 }}</ref>)\n* [[Jimmy Fallon]] as [[Chuck Wein]]\n* [[Jack Huston]] as [[Gerard Malanga]]\n* [[Tara Summers]] as [[Brigid Polk]]\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Richie Berlin\n* [[Shawn Hatosy]] as Syd Pepperman\n* [[Beth Grant]] as [[Julia Warhola]]\n* [[James Naughton]] as Fuzzy Sedgwick\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as James Townsend\n* [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] as Molly Spence\n* [[Illeana Douglas]] as [[Diana Vreeland]]\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as [[Ingrid Superstar]]\n* [[Don Novello]] as Mort Silvers\n* [[Johnny Whitworth]] as Silver George\n* [[Brian Bell]] as [[Lou Reed]]\n* [[Patrick Wilson (musician)|Patrick Wilson]] as [[John Cale]]\n* Michael Stephens as [[Sterling Morrison]]\n* [[Samantha Maloney]] as [[Maureen Tucker]]\n* [[Meredith Ostrom]] as [[Nico]]\n* Michael Post as Taxi Driver (Post was Sedgwick's husband)\n}}\n\n==Controversy==\n[[Lou Reed]], singer-songwriter of [[the Velvet Underground]] and one of the Factory people who knew Sedgwick, hated the film.
