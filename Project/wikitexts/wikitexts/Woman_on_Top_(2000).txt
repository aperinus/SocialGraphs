Because of her illness, she couldn't play much with other children. She stayed at home and learned how to cook, becoming a renowned chef as an adult. She fell in love with Toninho and they opened a restaurant together, with Isabella stuck in the kitchen and Toninho out front taking the credit.\n\nThe only way for Isabella to control her motion sickness is to control her motion. She must drive rather than ride in a car, take stairs instead of elevators, lead while dancing, and be on top during [[coitus]]. Toninho, feeling emasculated and resentful of this, has an [[affair]] with a neighbor. Isabella flees [[Brazil]] for [[San Francisco]] with her [[Afro-Brazilian]] [[transsexual]] friend Monica, who spent her early years with her in the fishing community of Salvador. Despite old job offers from a number of restaurants, Isabella is unable to find a job until she takes over a cooking class at a local culinary school. Cliff, a neighbor and local television producer, smells her cooking, follows her to class, and signs her to host a live cooking show, ''Passion Food''. She makes Monica her assistant on the show. Isabella performs a sacrifice to [[Yemanja]], a Brazilian sea goddess, to harden her heart and make her never love Toninho again.\n\nBack in Brazil, Toninho's restaurant is floundering without Isabella. Toninho curses Yemanja, and the fishermen stop catching any fish. He figures out that Isabella has gone to Monica and follows her to San Francisco. He spots her on television and tracks her to the studio. With a group of local street musicians, Toninho sneaks into the studio and onto the set, serenading Isabella on the live broadcast. Cliff hires Toninho and the musicians for the show over Isabella's objections. Isabella pursues a relationship with Cliff but Toninho continues trying to win her back.\n\nNetwork executives offer to syndicate Isabella's show nationally, but only after demanding a number of changes, including firing Monica. With the restaurant closed, Toninho apologizes to Yemanja, but tells her to \"stay out of [his] business\" with Isabella. He quits the show and makes another attempt to win back Isabella. Isabella goes after him but has to take an elevator, and her motion sickness slows her enough to allow Toninho to depart. Isabella also quits the show rather than accept the changes demanded by the network.\n\nIsabella, with her love still gone but now wanting it returned, tries to cook another sacrifice to Yemanja but finds her cooking talent is gone. Undaunted, Monica substitutes some boxed [[macaroni and cheese]]. Isabella makes the second offering but nearly drowns. She has a vision of Yemanja, who rejects her new offering.\n\nIsabella goes to collect her things from the television studio. Toninho, sent by Monica, shows up and suggests they cook something together. As they cook, the fish return to the village waters and Yemanja returns Isabella's original offering along with her love for Toninho.\n\nThe film closes with Toninho and Isabella operating a new restaurant as equal partners and with Cliff and Monica as a couple.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Isabella Oliveira\n** Analu De Castro as 2-year-old Isabella\n** Thais De S\u00e1 Curvelo as 5-year-old Isabella\n* [[Murilo Ben\u00edcio]] as Toninho Oliveira\n* [[Harold Perrineau|Harold Perrineau Jr.]] as Monica Jones\n* [[Mark Feuerstein]] as Cliff Lloyd\n* [[John de Lancie|John De Lancie]] as Alex Reeves\n* [[Wagner Moura]] as Rafi\n* [[Ana Gasteyer]] as Claudia Hunter\n* [[Anne Ramsay]] as TV director\n* Eliana Guttman as Isabella's mother\n* Eduardo Mattedi as Isabella's father\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Brazil]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], United States.
