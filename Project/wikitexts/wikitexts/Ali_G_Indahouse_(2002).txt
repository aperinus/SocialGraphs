It is the first of four films based on Baron Cohen's characters from ''Da Ali G Show'', followed by ''[[Borat]]'' (2006), ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'' (2009), and ''[[Borat Subsequent Moviefilm]]'' (2020). It is also the only one of these films to consist solely of a fictional narrative with no [[mockumentary]] element.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Ali G]] is the leader of Da West Staines Massiv, a fictional gang composed of wannabe gangsters from [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]]. Their chief rivals are Da East Staines Massiv. Da West Staines Massiv decide to protest when they learn that their cherished hangout, the John Nike Leisure Centre (where Ali teaches a life support group for young schoolboys), will be demolished by the local council. After he goes on a hunger strike and is spotted locked to some railings by the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] David Carlton, Ali is thrown into a world of political corruption as the Deputy Prime Minister tries to use him as a catalyst to ruin the Prime Minister's reputation. Ali is put forward as a candidate to be the next [[Member of parliament|MP]] for Staines and manages to alienate most of the electorate. During a debate, he tries to insult his rival candidate by claiming that the candidate \"[[Bestiality|sucked off a horse]]\". Unbeknownst to Ali, the candidate actually did so and subsequently resigns, leaving Ali the winner.\n\nThough he is inexperienced as an MP, Ali's outlandish behaviour and ideas seem to work. He visits a customs checkpoint in [[Dover]] as a delegate compiling a report, and through strategies such as making education more relatable and ensuring the immigration of attractive women into the country, Ali becomes incredibly popular; he meets the Prime Minister's goals and brings the PM's percentage lead in the polls up by 22%. With this, the Prime Minister offers to save the John Nike Leisure Centre. Ali accompanies the Prime Minister to a [[United Nations]] peace conference to avert war between the [[African French|French-speaking African nations]] of [[Chad]] and [[Burkina Faso]]. The [[United States]] and [[Russia]] back opposing countries, and both threaten nuclear attacks. Ali sneaks into the catering area and drugs everyone's tea with [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which has the side effect of making the leaders of Chad and Burkina Faso allies and even lovers. The Prime Minister says that Ali has saved the world, but Carlton's secretary Kate Hedges figures out what Ali has done and sends the empty cannabis bag to the press. Ali is forced to leave Parliament.\n\nBefore the John Nike Leisure Centre can be saved from imminent demolition, a video emerges of Ali and his girlfriend having sex in the Prime Minister's bedroom at [[Chequers]]. As Ali was wearing items of the Prime Minister's clothing at the time, the press misconstrues the video as the Prime Minister's [[sex tape]] with a prostitute, forcing the Prime Minister's resignation. This results in Carlton being made acting Prime Minister, and he quickly orders the destruction of the leisure centre. He also reveals that he purchased all available real estate in Staines, knowing that the town will be destroyed to make way for the construction of a new terminal for [[Heathrow Airport]] which will make him wealthy. The West Staines Massiv race to find the master copy of the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] tape proving the Prime Minister's innocence, offering a truce to the gangs in and around Staines to help them break into the vaults and retrieve the tape. They succeed and reinstate the original Prime Minister. Staines is saved from destruction, with the Prime Minister declaring that [[Slough]] will be destroyed instead. The film ends with Ali as the British ambassador to [[Jamaica]], where Carlton is forced to obey his every command.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as [[Ali G]] and [[Borat Sagdiyev]]\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]\n* [[Charles Dance]] as Deputy Prime Minister David Carlton\n* [[Kellie Bright]] as Me Julie (credited as Kelly Bright) \n* [[Martin Freeman]] as Ricky C\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Kate Hedges\n* [[Barbara New]] as Ali's Nan\n* [[Ray Panthaki]] as Hassan B\n* [[Emilio Rivera]] as Rico\n* [[Paul Clayton (actor)|Paul Clayton]] as Alan Swan Lake\n* [[Olegar Fedoro]] as Russian Minister\n* [[Tony Way]] as Dangerous Dave\n* [[Eileen Essell]] as Mrs. Hugh\n* [[Daniela Lavender|Daniella Lavender]] as Maid\n* Capri Ashby as Nurse Nina\n* [[John Scott Martin]] as Mr. Johnson\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Customs Officer\n* [[Naomi Campbell]] as herself\n* [[Nabil Elouahabi]] as Jezzy F\n* Bruce Jamieson as Journalist\n* [[Anna Keaveney]] as Secretary\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe opening \"gangland\" dream sequence was filmed in [[Los Angeles]], with all other scenes filmed in [[Manchester]], [[London]], and [[Staines]]. Filming also took place at [[Manchester Town Hall]] between 31 May and 2 June 2001. When Ali references the Berkshire Massiv of [[Englefield Green]] in the film, this is actually in [[Surrey]]; the John Nike Leisure Centre is a real facility, though it is located several miles west of Staines in [[Bracknell]].\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in the United Kingdom on 22 March 2002, and was released in various other countries throughout the rest of 2002 and midway through 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284837/releaseinfo | title=Ali G Indahouse (2002) - Release dates | work=[[Internet Movie Database]] | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | access-date=23 January 2015}}</ref> It was given a limited theatrical release in the United States.

The DVD version has been modified from the original UK cinema version. In the original cut, the film opens with Ali appearing over the [[BBFC]] Certificate and changes the categorisation from 15 to 18. He goes on to warn about the dangers of having sex in the back row of the cinema (coming into contact with other people's semen on the seats) and to suggest that the audience's enjoyment will be enhanced by smoking cannabis.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,672945,00.html |title=Ali G Indahouse |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 March 2002 |access-date=26 June 2015}}</ref> This 30-second introduction is missing from all international cinema releases and all current home video releases.\n\n==Reception==\n===Commercial performance===\nThe film grossed a total of \u00a317.2 million on a budget of \u00a35 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2002/0AGIH.php |title=Ali G Indahouse&nbsp;\u2013 Box Office Data, Movie News, Cast Information |publisher=The Numbers |access-date=2011-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/ali-g-indahouse-7 | title=''Ali G Indahouse'' (15) | work=[[British Board of Film Classification]] | date=7 March 2002 | access-date=23 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mixed reviews.

Featuring music used in the film, it also featured linking material by Ali G as if the album were a [[pirate radio]] broadcast on Ali's \"Drive By FM\". It was an [[enhanced CD]], featuring the music video for \"Me Julie\".\n\n==Cultural impact==\nIn 2012, Staines was officially renamed by the local council to [[Staines-upon-Thames]] partly to avoid the fictional gang associations implied by the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Staines becomes Staines-upon-Thames to shake off Ali G link|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-18118309|work=BBC News|date=20 May 2012|access-date=9 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0284837|Ali G Indahouse}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|ali-g-indahouse-the-movie|Ali G Indahouse}}\n* [http://www.boyakasha.co.uk/ \"The ultimate Borat + Ali G website\"]\n* [http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/review_948.html ''Ali G InDaHouse'' London Film Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109110401/http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/review_948.html |date=9 November 2006 }}\n* [https://www.newspapers.com/image/356953736 ]\n\n{{Sacha Baron Cohen}}\n{{Mark Mylod}}\n{{Cannabis in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Borat}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ali G Indahouse}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s satirical films]]\n[[Category:British satirical films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:British films about cannabis]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mark Mylod]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in Surrey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Surrey]]\n[[Category:Hood comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Eric Fellner]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Tim Bevan]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Sacha Baron Cohen]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Dan Mazer]]\n[[Category:2002 soundtrack albums]]\n[[Category:Hip hop soundtracks]]\n[[Category:Island Records soundtracks]]\n[[Category:Rhythm and blues soundtracks]]\n[[Category:Staines-upon-Thames]]\n[[Category:StudioCanal films]]\n[[Category:Working Title Films films]]\n[[Category:2000s hip hop films]]\n[[Category:2002 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Comedy film soundtracks]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
