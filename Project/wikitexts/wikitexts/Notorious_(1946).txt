Devlin (Grant), who enlists the help of Alicia Huberman (Bergman), the daughter of a German war criminal, to infiltrate a circle of executives of [[IG Farben]] hiding out in [[Rio de Janeiro]] after [[World War II]]. The situation becomes complicated when the two fall in love as Huberman is instructed to seduce Alex Sebastian (Rains), a Farben executive who had previously been infatuated with her. It was shot in late 1945 and early 1946, and was released by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] in August 1946.\n\n''Notorious'' is considered by critics and scholars to mark a watershed for Hitchcock artistically, and to represent a heightened thematic maturity. His biographer, [[Donald Spoto]], writes that ''\"Notorious'' is in fact Alfred Hitchcock's first attempt\u2014at the age of forty-six\u2014to bring his talents to the creation of a serious love story, and its story of two men in love with Ingrid Bergman could only have been made at this stage of his life.\"<ref name=spotomain>[[Donald Spoto|Spoto, Donald]] (1983).

R. Devlin to infiltrate an organization of Nazis who have escaped to [[Brazil]] after [[World War II]]. When Alicia refuses to help the authorities, Devlin plays recordings of her fighting with her father and insisting that she loves America.\n\n[[Image:Notorious Trailer - At the Horseracing track.jpg|right|thumb|Devlin and Alicia meet at the track, with Alexander watching from the grandstand.]]\nWhile awaiting the details of her assignment in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Alicia and Devlin fall in love, though his feelings are complicated by his knowledge of her promiscuous past. When Devlin gets instructions to persuade her to seduce Alex Sebastian, one of her father's friends and a leading member of the Farben executives, Devlin fails to convince his superiors that Alicia is not fit for the job. Devlin is also informed that Sebastian once was in love with Alicia. Devlin puts up a stoic front when he informs Alicia about the mission. Alicia concludes that he was merely pretending to love her as part of his job.\n\nDevlin contrives to have Alicia meet Sebastian at a riding club. He recognizes her and invites her to dinner where he says that he always knew they would be reunited. Sebastian quickly invites Alicia to dinner the following night at his home, where he will host a few business acquaintances. Devlin and Captain Paul Prescott of the [[United States Secret Service|US Secret Service]] tell Alicia to memorize the names and nationalities of everyone there. At dinner, Alicia notices that a guest becomes agitated at the sight of a certain wine bottle, and is ushered quickly from the room. When the gentlemen are alone at the end of the dinner, this guest apologizes and tries to go home, but another insists on driving him, implying that he will kill him.\n\nSoon Alicia reports to Devlin, \"You can add Sebastian's name to my list of playmates.\" When Sebastian proposes, Alicia informs Devlin; he coldly tells her to do whatever she wants. Deeply disappointed, she marries Sebastian.\n\n[[Image:Ingrid Bergman in Notorious Trailer(4).jpg|left|thumb|Alicia takes the wine cellar key while Alexander dresses for the party. The gown is by [[Edith Head]].]]\nAfter she returns from her honeymoon, Alicia is able to tell Devlin that the key ring her husband gave her lacks the key to the wine cellar. That, and the bottle episode at the dinner, lead Devlin to urge Alicia to hold a grand party so he can investigate. Alicia secretly steals the key from Sebastian's ring, and Devlin and Alicia search the cellar. Devlin accidentally breaks a bottle; inside is black sand, later proven to be [[uranium]] ore. Devlin takes a sample, cleans up, and locks the door as Sebastian comes down for more champagne. Alicia and Devlin kiss to cover their tracks. Devlin makes an exit. Sebastian realizes that the cellar key is missing \u2013 yet overnight it is returned to his key ring. When he returns to the cellar, he finds the glass and sand from the broken bottle.\n\nNow Sebastian has a problem: he must silence Alicia, but cannot expose her without revealing his own blunder to the rest of the Nazi emigres. When Sebastian discusses the situation with his mother, she suggests that Alicia \"die slowly\" by poisoning. They poison her coffee and she quickly falls ill. During a visit from Sebastian's friend Dr. Anderson, Alicia realizes both where the uranium has been mined and what is causing her sickness. Alicia collapses and is taken to her room, where the telephone has been removed and she is too weak to leave.\n\nDevlin becomes alarmed when Alicia fails to appear at their rendezvous for five days and sneaks into Alicia's room, where she tells him that Sebastian and his mother poisoned her. After confessing his love for her, Devlin carries her out of the mansion in full view of Sebastian's co-conspirators. Sebastian and his mother go along with Devlin's story that Alicia must go to the hospital. Outside, Sebastian begs to go with them, but Devlin and Alicia drive away, leaving Sebastian behind to meet his fate.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cary Grant]] as T. R.

Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-21781-0}}. p. 207</ref>\n\nNot everyone saw it that way, however, most notably the project's original producer [[David O. Selznick]]. After he sold the property to RKO to raise some quick cash, Selznick lobbied hard to get Grant replaced with [[Joseph Cotten]]; the United States had just [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs on Japan]] and Selznick argued that the first film out about atomic weaponry would be the most successful\u2014and Grant was not available for three months.<ref name=leff207>Leff, p. 207</ref> Selznick also believed that Grant would be difficult to manage and make high salary demands,<ref name=mcg374>McGilligan, p. 374</ref> but most telling of all\u2014Selznick owned Cotten's contract.<ref name=leff207/> Hitchcock and RKO production executive [[William Dozier]] invoked a clause in the project sale contract and blocked Selznick's attempts; Grant was signed to play opposite Bergman by late August 1945.<ref name=leff206>Leff, p. 206</ref>\n\nHitchcock had wanted [[Clifton Webb]] to play Alexander Sebastian.<ref name=spoto302>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 302</ref> Selznick pressed for Claude Rains in typical Selznick memo-heavy style: \"Rains offers 'an opportunity to build the gross of ''Notorious'' enormously... . [D]o not lose a day trying to get the Rains' deal nailed down.'\"<ref name=leff209>Leff, p. 209</ref> Whether they were thinking in Selznick's box office terms or in more artistic ones, Dozier and Hitchcock agreed, and Rains' performance transformed Sebastian into a classic Hitchcock villain: sympathetic, nuanced, in some ways as admirable as the protagonist.<ref name=spoto302/>\n{{multiple image\n|footer=Hitchcock's cameo in ''Notorious'' does not come until after the one-hour mark; when he became a television star in the 1950s, he slotted his cameos in the first few minutes so audiences would not be distracted looking for him.\n|direction=horizontal\n|width=220\n|image1=\n|image2=\n}}\nThe final major casting decision was Mme. Sebastian, Alex's mother. \"The spidery, tyrannical Nazi matron demanded a stronger, older presence\",<ref name=spoto302/> and when attempts to obtain [[Ethel Barrymore]] and [[Mildred Natwick]] fell through, German actor Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel suggested [[Leopoldine Konstantin]] to Hitchcock and Dozier. Konstantin had been one of pre-war Germany's greatest actresses.<ref name=spoto302/> ''Notorious'' was Konstantin's only American film appearance, and \"one of the unforgettable portraits in Hitchcock's films\".<ref name=spoto302/>\n\n[[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appearance]], a signature occurrence in his films, takes place at the party in Sebastian's mansion. At 1:04:43 (1:01:50 on European DVDs and 64:28 of the edited cut) into the film, Hitchcock is seen drinking a glass of champagne as Grant and Bergman approach. He sets his glass down and quickly departs.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Pre-Production ===\n''Notorious'' started life as a [[David O. Selznick]] production, but by the time it hit American screens in August 1946, it bore the [[RKO Pictures|RKO studio's]] logo. Alfred Hitchcock became the producer, but as on all his subsequent films, he limited his screen credits to \"Directed by\" and his possessive credit above the title.\n\nIts first glimmer occurred some two years previously, in August 1944, over lunch between Hitchcock and Selznick's story editor, Margaret McDonell. Her memo to Selznick said that Hitchcock was \"very anxious to do a story about confidence tricks on a grand scale [with] Ingrid Bergman [as] the woman ... Her training would be as elaborate as the training of a Mata Hari.\"<ref name=spoto297>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 297</ref> Hitchcock continued his conversation a few weeks later, this time dining at Chasen's with [[William Dozier]], an RKO studio executive, and pitching it as \"the story of a woman sold for political purposes into sexual enslavement\".<ref name=spoto298>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 298</ref> By this time, he had one of the single-word titles he preferred: ''Notorious''.<ref>''Notorious'' was his tenth single word-titled film: ''Downhill, Champagne, Blackmail, Murder!, Sabotage, Suspicion, Saboteur, Lifeboat'' and ''Spellbound'' preceded it; ''Rope, Vertigo'' and ''Frenzy'' followed. His other one-worders, ''Rebecca, Psycho, Marnie'' and ''Topaz'' take their titles from the one-word titles of the novels they derive from. Spoto, ''Notorious'', p. 195n</ref> The pitch was convincing: Dozier quickly entered into talks with Selznick, offering to buy the property and its personnel for production at RKO.\n\nDozier's interest rekindled Selznick's, which up to that point had only been tepid. Perhaps what started Hitchcock's mind rolling was \"The Song of the Dragon\", a short story by [[John Taintor Foote]] which had appeared as a two-part serial in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' in November 1921; Selznick, who owned the rights to it, had passed it on to Hitchcock from his unproduced story file during the filming of ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''.<ref name=spoto298/> Set during [[World War I]] in New York, \"The Song of the Dragon\" told the tale of a theatrical producer approached by [[Law enforcement in the United States|federal agents]], who want his assistance in recruiting an actress he once had a relationship with to seduce the leader of a gang of enemy saboteurs.<ref name=mcg366>McGilligan, p. 366</ref> Although the story was a nominal starting point that \"offered some inspiration, the final narrative was pure Hitchcock\".<ref name=sponomain>[[Donald Spoto|Spoto, Donald]], (2001). ''Notorious: The Life of Ingrid Bergman''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Da Capo Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-306-81030-5}}. p. 195</ref>\n\nHitchcock travelled to England for Christmas 1944, and when he returned, he had an outline for Selznick's perusal.<ref name=spoto298/> The producer approved development of a script, and Hitchcock decamped for [[Nyack, New York]] for three weeks of collaboration with [[Ben Hecht]], whom he had just worked with on ''Spellbound''. The two would work at Hecht's house, with Hitchcock repairing at night to the [[St. Regis New York]]. The two had an extraordinarily smooth and fruitful working partnership, partly because Hecht did not really care how much Hitchcock rewrote his work:<ref name=spoto298/>\n\n{{blockquote|Their story conferences were idyllic. Mr. Hecht would stride about or drape himself over chair or couch, or sprawl artistically on the floor. Mr. Hitchcock, a 192-pound Buddha (reduced from 295) would sit primly on a straight-back chair, his hands clasped across his midriff, his round button eyes gleaming. They would talk from nine to six; Mr. Hecht would sneak off with his typewriter for two or three days; then they would have another conference. The dove of peace lost not a pinfeather in the process.<ref name=spoto299/>}}\n\nHitchcock delivered his and Hecht's screenplay to Selznick in late March, but the producer was getting drawn deeper into the roiling problems of his western epic ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]''. At first he ordered story conferences at his home, typically with start times of eleven p.m.,<ref name=spoto301>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 301</ref> to both Hecht's and Hitchcock's profound annoyance. The two would dine at [[Romanoff's]] and \"pool their defenses about what Hitchcock thought was a first class script\".<ref name=spoto301/> Shortly, though, ''Duel''{{'}}s problems won out and Selznick relegated ''Notorious'' to his mental back burner.\n\nAmong the many changes to the original story was the introduction of a [[MacGuffin]]: a cache of [[uranium]] being held in Sebastian's wine cellar by the Nazis. At the time, it was not common knowledge that uranium was being used in the development of the [[atomic bomb]], and Selznick had trouble understanding its use as a plot device. Indeed, Hitchcock later claimed he was followed by the [[FBI]] for several months after he and Hecht discussed uranium with [[Robert Millikan]] at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in mid-1945.<ref name=truff>[[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut|Truffaut, Fran\u00e7ois]] (1967). ''Hitchcock By Truffaut''. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|978-0-671-60429-5}}</ref> In any event, the dropping of the atomic bomb on [[Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945, and the release of details of the [[Manhattan Project]], removed any doubts about its use.<ref name=mcg375>McGilligan, p. 375</ref>\n<!-- Dozier was \"an amiable, ''laissez-faire'' producer\".<ref name=mcg375/> -->\n\nBy June 1945, ''Notorious'' reached its turning point. Selznick \"was losing faith in a film that never really interested him\";<ref name=mcg374/> the MacGuffin still bothered him, as did the Devlin character, and he worried that audiences would dislike the Alicia character.<ref name=mcg374/> More worrisome, though, was the drain on his cash reserves imposed by the voracious ''Duel in the Sun''. Finally, he agreed to sell the ''Notorious'' package to RKO: script, Bergman and Hitchcock.\n\nThe deal was a win-win-win situation: Selznick got $800,000 cash, plus 50% of the profits, RKO obtained a prestige production with an ascendant star and an emerging director, and Hitchcock, though he received no money, did escape from under Selznick's stifling thumb.<ref name=leff206/> He also got to be his own producer for the first time, an important step for him: \"supervising everything from the polishing of the script to the negotiation of myriad post-production details, the director could demonstrate to the industry at large his skill as an executive.\"<ref name=leff206/> RKO assumed the project in mid-July 1945, and furnished office space, studio space, distribution\u2014and freedom.\n\nThere was no getting away from Selznick completely, though. He contended that his 50% stake in the profits still entitled him to input into the project. He still dictated sheaves of memos about the script, and tried to oust Cary Grant from the cast in favor of his contractee, [[Joseph Cotten]].<ref name=leff207/> When the United States detonated two atomic bombs over Japan in August, the memos commenced anew and centered mainly on Selznick's continuing dissatisfaction with the script. Hitchcock was abroad,<ref name=leff207/> so Dozier called on playwright [[Clifford Odets]], who previously wrote ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (film)|None But the Lonely Heart]]'' for RKO and Grant, to do a rewrite. With Hitchcock and Selznick both busy, Selznick's script assistant Barbara Keon would be his only contact.\n\nOdets's script tried to bring more atmosphere to the story than had previously been present. \"Extending the characters' emotional range, he heightened the passion of Devlin and Alicia and the aristocratic ennui of Alex Sebastian. He also added a soup\u00e7on of high culture to soften Alicia: She quotes French poetry from memory and sings [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].\"<ref name=leff207/> But his draft did nothing for Selznick, who still thought the characters lacked dimension, that Devlin still lacked charm, and that the couple's sleeping together \"may cheapen her in the eyes of the audience\".<ref name=leff208>Leff, p. 208</ref> Ben Hecht's appraisal, handwritten in the margin, was straightforward: \"This is really loose crap.\"<ref name=leff208/> In the end, the Odets script was a blind alley: Hitchcock apparently used none of it.<ref name=spoto299>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 299</ref>\n\nWhat he ''did'' have in his hand, though, was the script for \"... a consummate Hitchcock film, in every sense filled with passion and textures and levels of meaning\".<ref name=mcg379>McGilligan, p. 379</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nPrincipal photography for ''Notorious'' began on October 22, 1945<ref name=mcg379/> and wrapped in February 1946.<ref name=spoto302/> Production was structured the way Hitchcock preferred it: with almost all shooting done indoors, on RKO sound stages, even seeming \"exterior\" scenes achieved with rear projection [[Rear projection effect|process shots]]. This gave him maximum control of his filmmaking through the day; in the evenings he exercised similar control over the nightly soir\u00e9es at his Bellagio Road home.<ref name=spoto>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 303</ref> The only scene requiring outdoor filming was the one at the riding club where Devlin and Alicia contrive to meet Alexander Sebastian on horseback; this scene was shot at the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]] in [[Arcadia, California]]. [[Second unit]] crews shot establishing exteriors and rear-projection footage in Miami, Rio de Janeiro and at the [[Santa Anita Park]] racetrack.\n\nWith everything stage-bound, production was smooth and problems were few, and small\u2014for instance, Claude Rains, who stood three or four inches shorter than Ingrid Bergman.<ref name=mcg379/> \"[There's] this business of you being a midget with a wife, Miss Bergman, who is very tall\", the director kidded with Rains, a good friend. For the scenes where Rains and Bergman were to walk hand-in-hand, Hitchcock devised a system of ramps that boosted Rains's height yet were unseen by the camera.<ref name=\"mcg380\">McGilligan, p. 380</ref> He also suggested Rains try [[elevator shoes]]: \"Walk in them, sleep in them, be comfortable in them.\"<ref name=\"mcg380\"/> Rains did, and used them thereafter. Hitchcock gave Rains the choice of playing Sebastian with a German or his English accent; Rains chose the latter.\n\nIngrid Bergman's gowns were by [[Edith Head]],<ref name=\"afi\" /> in one of her many collaborations with Hitchcock.\n\n[[Image:Notorious1946.jpg|left|thumb|Stretching seconds to minutes: one long kiss broken into a string of short ones beat the ban on kisses over three seconds.]]\nOne of the signature scenes in ''Notorious'' is the two-and-a-half-minute kiss that Hitchcock interrupted every three seconds to slip the scene through the three-second-rule crack in the Production Code. \"The two stars worried about how strange it felt\", writes biographer McGilligan. \"Walking along, nuzzling each other with the camera trailing behind them, seemed 'very awkward' to the actors during filming, according to Bergman. 'Don't worry', Hitchcock assured her. 'It'll look right on the screen.{{'\"}}<ref name=mcg376>McGilligan, p. 376</ref>\n\nAlthough the production proceeded smoothly it was not without some unusual aspects. The first was the helpfulness of Cary Grant toward Ingrid Bergman, in a way that \"was remarkably calm and pointedly unusual for him\".<ref name=spono198>Spoto, ''Notorious'', p. 198</ref> Although this was Bergman's second outing with Hitchcock (the first was the just-finished ''Spellbound''), she was nervous and insecure early on. The often moody, sometimes withdrawn<ref name=\"mcg380\"/> Grant, though, \"came to ''Notorious'' full of bounce\"<ref name=\"mcg380\"/> and coached her through her initial period of adjustment, rehearsing her the way Devlin rehearses Alicia.<ref name=\"mcg380\"/> This began a lifetime friendship for the two.\n\nThere were two passionate turmoils going on on-set, and both served to inform the final product: one was Hitchcock's growing infatuation with Bergman, and the other was her torturous affair with [[Robert Capa]], the celebrity battlefield photographer.<ref name=spono197>Spoto, ''Notorious'', p. 197</ref> As a result of this simpatico connection, and \"to accomplish the deepest logic of ''Notorious'', Hitchcock did something unprecedented in his career: he made Ingrid his closest collaborator on the picture\":<ref name=spono197/>\n\n{{blockquote|\"The girl's look is wrong\", Ingrid said to Hitchcock when, after several takes of her close-up during the dinner sequence, everyone knew something was awry. \"You have her registering [surprise] too soon, Hitch. I think she would do it this way.\" And with that, Ingrid did the scene her way. There was not a sound on the set, for Hitchcock did not suffer actors' ideas gladly: he knew what he wanted from the start. Well before filming began, every eventuality of every scene had been planned\u2014every camera angle, every set, costume, prop, even the sound cues had been foreseen and were in the shooting script. But in this case, an actress had a good idea, and to everyone's astonishment, he said, \"I think you're right, Ingrid.\"<ref name=spono1978>Spoto, ''Notorious'', pp. 197\u2013198</ref>}}\n\nWhen production wrapped in February 1946, Hitchcock had in the can what [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] later told him \"gets a maximum of effect from a minimum of elements ... Of all your pictures, this is the one in which one feels the most perfect correlation between what you are aiming at and what appears on the screen ... To the eye, the ensemble is as perfect as an animated cartoon ...\"<ref name=truff173>Truffaut, p. 173</ref>\n<!--''Notorious'' became the first film on which Hitchcock collaborated with [[Edith Head]], Ingrid Bergman's outfits being the most notable outcome of this collaboration.-->\n\n=== Music ===\nThe music for ''Notorious'' is the least celebrated of the major Hitchcock scores, writes film scholar [[Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|Jack Sullivan]], one that few writers or fans talk about. \"The neglect is unfortunate, for Roy Webb composed one of the most deftly designed scores of any Hitchcock film. It weaves a unique spell, one Hitchcock had not conjured before, and the hip, swingy source music is novel as well.\"<ref name=sullmain>[[Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|Sullivan, Jack]] (2006). ''Hitchcock's Music''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-13618-0}}. p. 124</ref>\n\nThe composer was [[Roy Webb]], a staff composer at RKO, who had most recently scored the dark films of director [[Val Lewton]] for that studio. He wrote the fight song for Columbia University while he was there in the 1920s, then served as assistant to film composer [[Max Steiner]] until 1935; his reputation was \"reliable, but unglamorous\".<ref name=sull124>Sullivan, p. 124</ref> Hitchcock had tried to get [[Bernard Herrmann]] for ''Notorious'', but Herrmann was unavailable; Webb too was a Herrmann fan: \"Benny writes the best music in Hollywood, with the fewest notes\", he said.<ref name=sull125>Sullivan, p. 125</ref>\n\nBefore the sale of the property to RKO, Selznick attempted, with typical Selznick gusto, to steer the course of the music.<ref name=sull126>Sullivan, p. 126</ref> He was miffed that no hit pop song had come out of his previous Hitchcock picture ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', so he considered eighteen \"gooey, sentimental songs\"<ref name=sull126/> like \"Love Nest\", \"Don't Give Any More Beer to My Father\" and \"In A Little Love Nest Way Up on a Hill\" for inclusion in ''Notorious''. However, the sale removed Selznick as the decision-maker.<ref name=sull126/>\n\nHitchcock was glad to be out from under Selznick's thumb. There would be \"no sudsy violins in big love scenes, no more recycling of Selznick's favorite cues from past movies. He made sure there were no south-of-the-border cliches.\"<ref name=sull126/> Selznick's exit also brought Hitchcock and Webb together into their natural sympatico. \"Selznick deplored 'Hitchcock's goddamned jigsaw cutting', the dreamlike, jagged images that create his signature subjectivity. But Webb didn't mind jigsaw cutting at all. It complemented his fragmented musical architecture, just as the blocked passions of the film's characters reflect his unresolved harmonies. Like Hitchcock, Webb favored atmosphere and tonal nuance over broad gestures. Both men were classicists dealing in darkness and chaos.\"<ref name=sull125/> They featured complementary personalities, too: \"Webb had a modest ego, a handy trait when working for a control addict like Hitchcock.\"<ref name=sull130>Sullivan, p. 130</ref> ''Notorious'' was, however, their only film together.\n\nAlicia and Devlin fall quickly in love once they arrive in Rio, and Webb uses tambourines, guitars, drums and Brazilian trumpets swinging into Brazilian dance music to provide \"sensuous foreplay for the tumultuous love affair\".<ref name=sull127>Sullivan, p. 127</ref> Numbers include \"Carnaval no Rio\", \"Meu Barco\", \"Guanabara\" and two sambas \"Ya Ya Me Leva\" and \"Bright Samba\". Yet understatement and atypical use are everywhere:\n\n{{blockquote|Sexy and full of danger, [the love music] is a typical Hitchcock romantic theme, though it is rarely used romantically. Even when Alicia and Devlin ascend a hill with a spectacular view and embrace during the initial courtship scenes\u2014surely the cue for a ''fortissimo'' eruption of love music \u00e0 la ''Spellbound''\u2014the theme sounds only for a teasing instant. For the most part, it appears at unpredictable times, in increasingly troubled harmonies, to capture the couple's shifting sexual subcurrents: Alicia's hurt and suppressed longing, Devlin's fear, jealousy, and hesitation.<ref name=sull131>Sullivan, p. 131</ref> }}\n\nOften, Webb and Hitchcock use no music at all to undergird a romantic scene. The two-and-a-half minute kiss begins with distant music when it commences out on the balcony, but goes silent when the couple move inside.<ref name=sull132>Sullivan, p. 132</ref> Other times, they flout conventional wisdom: when Alicia asks the band to stop playing stuffy waltzes and liven things up with Brazilian music to cover her trip to the wine cellar with Devlin, Latin dance tunes replace the expected suspense cue.<ref name=sull132/>\n\nAspects of Hitchcockian humor are present: When Alicia first enters the Sebastian mansion, loaded with sinister Nazis, [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] is playing. \"Wicked they may be, but these terrorists have artistic sensibilities and impeccable taste.\"<ref name=sull127/>\n\n=== Cinematography ===\n{{multiple image\n|footer=Starting high and wide, ending low and close, a tracking shot shows both the scale of the party and the point of it\u2014the purloined key to the wine cellar.\n|direction=horizontal\n|width=200\n|image1=NotoriousTrackingStart.png\n|image2=NotoriousPalmKey.jpg\n}}\n\nRoger Ebert described ''Notorious'' as having \"some of the most effective camera shots in his\u2014or anyone's\u2014work\".<ref name='Ebert'/> Hitchcock played off Grant's star power in his first scene, introducing his character with shots of the back of the actor's head showing him observing Alicia carefully. The excess of her drinking is reinforced the next morning with a close-up and zoom out from a glass of fizzing aspirin<ref>[[Alka-Seltzer]]</ref><ref>[[Bromo-Seltzer]]</ref> beside her bed. The camera switches to her point of view and the viewer sees Grant as Devlin, backlit and upside down.<ref name='Ebert'/> The film also contains a tracking shot at Sebastian's mansion in Rio de Janeiro: starting high above the entrance hall, the camera tracks all the way down to Alicia's hand, showing her nervously twisting the key there.<ref name=duncmain>Duncan, Paul, (2003).

D'Agostino]] and [[Carroll Clark]] (art directors); [[Darrell Silvera]] and [[Claude E. Carpenter]] (set decorations)\n* Special effects - [[Vernon L.

Tribby]] and Terry Kellum\n* Costumes - [[Edith Head]] (design of Ingrid Bergman's gowns)\n* Assistant director - William Dorfman\n* Production assistant - Barbara Keon\n\n== Themes and motifs ==\nThe predominant theme in ''Notorious'' is trust\u2014trust withheld, or given too freely.<ref name=spono196>Spoto, ''Notorious'', p. 196</ref> T. R. Devlin is a long time finding his trust, while Alexander Sebastian offers his up easily\u2014and ultimately pays a big price for it. Likewise, the film addresses a woman's need to be trusted, and a man's need to open himself to love.<ref name=spono196/>\n\nHitchcock the [[raconteur]] positioned it in terms of classic conflict. He told Truffaut that\n\n{{blockquote|[t]he story of ''Notorious'' is the old conflict between love and duty. Cary Grant's job\u2014and it's rather an ironic situation\u2014is to push Ingrid Bergman into Claude Rains's bed. One can hardly blame him for seeming bitter throughout the story, whereas Claude Rains is a rather appealing figure, both because his confidence is being betrayed and because his love for Ingrid Bergman is probably deeper than Cary Grant's. All of these elements of psychological drama have been woven into the spy story.<ref name=truff171>Truffaut, p. 171</ref>}}\n\nSullivan writes that Devlin sets up Alicia as sexual bait, refuses to take any responsibility for his role, then feels devastated when she does a superb job.<ref name=sull132/> Alicia finds herself coldly manipulated by the man she loves, sees her notorious behavior exploited for political purposes, then fears abandonment by the lover who put her in the excruciating predicament of spying on her late father's Nazi colleague by sleeping with him\u2014a man who genuinely loves her, perhaps more than Devlin does. Alex is Hitchcock's most painfully sympathetic villain, driven by his profound jealousy and rage\u2014not to mention his enthrallment to an emasculating mother\u2014culminating in an abrupt, absolute imperative to kill the love of his life.<ref name=sull132/>\n\n[[Image:Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious screenshot.png|left|thumb|\"We are protected by the enormity of your stupidity\u2014for a time\", Alexander's mother tells him when they realize Alicia's true intentions.]]\nHitchcock's own mother had died in September 1942, and ''Notorious'' is the first time he addresses his mother issues head-on. \"In ''Notorious'', the role of mother is at last fully introduced and examined. No longer relegated to mere conversation, she appears here as a major character in a Hitchcock picture, and all at once\u2014as later, through ''Psycho, The Birds'' and ''Marnie''\u2014Hitchcock began to make the mother figure a personal repository of his anger, guilt, resentment, and a sad yearning.\"<ref name=spoto306>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 306</ref> At the same time, he blurred mother-love with erotic love,<ref name=spoto307>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 307</ref> and poignantly, in both the film and in its director's life, \"both kinds of love were in fact limited to longing and fantasy and unfulfilled expectations\".<ref name=spoto307/>\n\nThe theme of drinking weaves its way through the film from beginning to end: for Alicia it is an escape from guilt and pain, or even downright poisonous.<ref name=spono196/> When a guest at the opening party tells her she has had enough, she scoffs: \"The ''important'' drinking hasn't started yet.\" She camouflages emotional rejection with whiskey, at the opening party, the outdoor cafe in Rio, the apartment in Rio,<ref name=spoto308>Spoto, ''Dark'', p. 308</ref> then drinking becomes even more dangerous as the Sebastians administer their poison through Alicia's coffee. Even the MacGuffin comes packaged in a wine bottle. \"All the drinking is valueless and finally dangerous.\"<ref name=spoto308/>\n\nComing as it did on the heels of World War II, the theme of patriotism\u2014and the limits thereof\u2014makes it \"astonishing that the movie was produced at all (and that it was such an immediate success), since it contains such blunt dialogue about government-sponsored prostitution: The sexual blackmail is the idea of American intelligence agents, who are blithely willing to exploit a woman (and even to let her die) to serve their own ends. The depiction of the moral murkiness of American officials was unprecedented in Hollywood\u2014especially in 1945, when the Allied victory ushered in an era of understandable, but ultimately dangerous, chauvinism in American life.\"<ref name=\"spono197\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was the official selection of the [[1946 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4274/year/1946.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Notorious |access-date=2009-01-04|publisher=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> ''Notorious'' had its premiere at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City on August 15, 1946, with Hitchcock, Bergman, and Grant in attendance.\n\n===Box office===\nThe film made $4.85 million in [[theatrical rental]]s in the United States and Canada on its first release, making it [[1946 in film|one of the highest-grossing films of the year]].<ref name=Jewell>{{cite news | title=Richard B.
