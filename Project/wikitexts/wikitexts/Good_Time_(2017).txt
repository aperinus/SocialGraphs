It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as a robber who tries to free his mentally disabled brother, played by [[Benny Safdie]], all while eluding his own capture.  [[Barkhad Abdi]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], and [[Buddy Duress]] co-star. The [[Good Time (soundtrack)|original soundtrack]] was by electronic musician [[Oneohtrix Point Never]]. The film was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] in the [[2017 Cannes Film Festival]]'s main competition section. The film received critical acclaim for Pattinson's performance, the direction, story, and soundtrack.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Nikas sits uncomfortably in a court-ordered therapy session where he talks about the time he had a violent incident with his grandmother. He is mentally handicapped enough to not fully grasp [[anger management]] or the social repercussions of his actions. Nick's brother Connie bursts in and, to the displeasure of the therapist, forces Nick out of the room.\n\nThe brothers rob a New York City bank for $65,000. While fleeing in a taxi, a [[dye pack]] explodes in a money bag, causing the driver to crash. Connie and Nick flee on foot, washing the dye from their clothes in a fast-food restaurant restroom. Stopped by police, Nick panics and runs but is arrested and sent to [[Rikers Island]] while Connie escapes.\n\nConnie attempts to secure a [[Bail|bail bond]], but needs $10,000 more to get Nick out of jail. Too much of the robbery money is ruined by the dye to make his bail, so Connie needs another $10,000 as quickly as possible to get his brother out. He convinces his girlfriend, Corey, to pay with her mother's credit cards, but her mother cancels them. Connie learns that Nick has been hospitalized after a fight with an inmate. Connie breaks him out of the hospital, unconscious and bandaged, and convinces a woman to let them stay in her house with her 16-year-old granddaughter Crystal. While they watch TV, the news shows photos of Connie's face; to distract Crystal, he kisses her. Hearing screams from the other room, Connie realizes the man he broke out of the hospital is not Nick but a man released on parole, Ray.\n\nThe three drive to the [[Adventureland (New York)|Adventureland]] amusement park, where Ray stowed a bottle of [[LSD]] solution worth several thousand dollars and a bag of stolen money before he ran from police and injured himself. Searching for the money, Connie and Ray uncover the bottle of LSD and are discovered by a security guard; Connie beats him unconscious. As police arrive, Connie steals the man's uniform and Ray pours LSD down the man's throat to make him incoherent. Connie convinces the police that the guard was the intruder and destroys a hard drive containing security footage. Connie denies knowing Crystal as she is arrested while waiting outside.\n\nRay and Connie break into the guard's high-rise apartment. The guard has a pitbull that Connie lets smell the guard's jacket to get in. Ray begins drinking and Connie tells him he is a leech on society, leading to a heated argument. At Connie's insistence, Ray calls his criminal friend Caliph to buy back the LSD so they can get the bail money. When Caliph arrives, Connie demands $15,000; Caliph agrees, but tells Ray that he is really going to retrieve a firearm and come back to kill Connie. After Caliph leaves, Connie senses danger and leaves with the acid. As he made it to the hallway, Ray attacks him in order to prevent him from leaving, but the dog attacks Ray, giving Connie the opportunity to flee with the drugs. Ray goes back in the room and calls Caliph, but when he looks over the balcony, he sees Connie get caught by police. Ray attempts to escape from a window, but falls to his death. Meanwhile, Connie is put in the back of a police car and thinks about everything that has transpired. The film ends with Nick in a therapy class, beginning to participate in a group activity, with his therapist implying that Connie has confessed and taken responsibility for his role in the bank robbery, promising that he will have a \"good time\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Constantine \"Connie\" Nikas,<ref name=\"Jul2015THR\" /> a criminal, Nick's older brother and Corey's much younger boyfriend.\n* [[Benny Safdie]] as Nikolas \"Nick\" Nikas, Connie's younger, developmentally disabled brother.\n* [[Buddy Duress]] as Ray, a criminal recently released on parole.\n* Taliah Lennice Webster as Crystal, a teenage girl who helps Connie.\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Corey Ellman, Connie's much older girlfriend.\n* [[Barkhad Abdi]] as Dash, a security guard.\n* [[Necro (rapper)|Necro]] as Caliph, a criminal friend of Ray.\n* Peter Verby as Peter, Nick's psychiatrist.\n* Saida Mansoor as Agapia Nikas.\n* Gladys Mathon as Annie.\n* [[Rose Gregorio]] as Loren Ellman.\n* Eric Paykert as Eric the Bail Bondsman.\n* [[Craig muMs Grant]] as Denny\n\n==Production==\nOn July 9, 2015, it was announced that [[Safdie brothers|Ben and Josh Safdie]] would direct a [[caper story|caper]] film called ''Good Time'', and that Pattinson was attached to star.<ref name=Jul2015THR>{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Rebecca|title=Robert Pattinson to Star in Caper 'Good Time' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/robert-pattinson-star-caper-good-807597|access-date=January 9, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 9, 2015}}</ref> Elara Pictures' Sebastian Bear-McClard and Oscar Boyson produced the film,<ref name=\"Jul2015THR\" /> which Pattinson described as a \"really hardcore kind of [[Queens|Queens, New York]], mentally damaged psychopath, bank robbery movie.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Robert Pattinson Says He's Making A \"100% Improvised Movie\" & Creating Music For A Slapstick Comedy|url=http://theplaylist.net/robert-pattinson-says-hes-making-100-improvised-movie-making-music-slapstick-comedy-20170321/|access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] on the film took place in February and March 2016 in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|title=On the Set for 1/8/16: Robert Pattinson Starts on the Feature, 'Good Time' While Michael Fassbender & Marion Cotillard Wrap 'Assassin's Creed'|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-1816-robert-pattinson-starts-on-the-feature-good-time-while-michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard-wrap-assassins-creed/|access-date=January 9, 2016|work=SSN Insider|date=January 8, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109234920/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-1816-robert-pattinson-starts-on-the-feature-good-time-while-michael-fassbender-marion-cotillard-wrap-assassins-creed/|archive-date=January 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Good Time' Starring Robert Pattinson Open Casting Call for Lead Roles|url=http://www.projectcasting.com/casting-calls-acting-auditions/good-time-robert-pattinson-open-casting-call/|access-date=January 9, 2016|work=Project Casting|date=December 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[Oneohtrix Point Never]] provided the film's score, which won the Soundtrack Award at the 2017 [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>Kim, Michelle (May 27, 2017).
