The film tells the story of [[Jennifer Hills]] ([[Camille Keaton]]), a fiction writer based in New York City who exacts revenge on each of her tormentors after four men [[gang rape]] and leave her for dead.\n\nThe film is noted for its controversial depiction of extreme graphic violence, particularly the lengthy depictions of gang rape, that take up 30 minutes of the film's runtime. During its wider release, it was branded a \"[[video nasty]]\" in the United Kingdom, and was a target of censorship by film commissioning bodies.<ref name=\"videonasty1\">{{cite news|last1=Phelan|first1=Laurence|title=Film censorship: How moral panic led to a mass ban of 'video nasties'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/film-censorship-how-moral-panic-led-to-a-mass-ban-of-video-nasties-9600998.html|access-date=February 19, 2017|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref><ref name=\"videonasty2\">{{cite news|title=I Spit On Your Grave|url=https://bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/i-spit-your-grave|access-date=February 19, 2017|publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]}}</ref> As such, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] became one of the most notable detractors of the film, calling it \"a vile bag of garbage\".<ref name=\"ebertchicago\">{{cite news|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=I Spit on Your Grave Movie Review (1980)|url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/i-spit-on-your-grave-1980|access-date=February 18, 2017|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=July 16, 1980}}</ref> The film remains highly controversial to this day, even being considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst#I Spit on Your Grave (1978)|worst films ever made]].

A direct sequel, ''[[I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu]]'', was released in 2019 with Zarchi and Keaton both returning.

The arrival of the attractive and independent young woman attracts the attention of Johnny Stillman, the gas station manager, Stanley Woods and Andy Chirensky, two unemployed men. Jennifer has her groceries delivered by Matthew Duncan, who is mildly [[mentally disabled]]. Matthew is friends with the other three men and reports back to them about the beautiful woman he met, claiming that he saw her [[breasts]].\n\nStanley and Andy start cruising by the cottage in their boat and prowl around the house at night. One day, the men attack Jennifer. She realizes that they planned her abduction so Matthew can lose his [[virginity]]. She fights back, but the three men rip her [[bikini]] off and hold her. Matthew refuses to rape Jennifer out of respect and pity for her, so Johnny and Andy rape her instead. After she crawls back to her house, they attack her again. Matthew finally rapes her after drinking alcohol. The other men ridicule her book and rip up the manuscript, and Stanley violently sexually assaults her. She passes out; Johnny realizes that she is a witness to their crimes and orders Matthew to go and murder her. Matthew cannot bring himself to stab her, so he dabs the knife in her blood and then returns to the other men, claiming that he has killed her.\n\nIn the following days, a [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] Jennifer pieces both herself and her manuscript back together. She goes to church and asks for forgiveness for what she plans to do. The men learn that Jennifer has survived and beat Matthew up for deceiving them. Jennifer calls in a grocery order, knowing that Matthew will deliver it. He takes the groceries and a knife. At the cabin, Jennifer entices him to have sex with her under a tree. She then hangs him and drops his body into the lake.\n\nAt the gas station, Jennifer seductively directs Johnny to enter her car. She stops halfway to her house, points a gun at him, and orders him to remove all his clothing. Johnny insists that the rapes were all her fault because she enticed the men by parading around in revealing clothing. She pretends to believe this and invites him back to her cottage for a hot bath, where she [[Handjob|masturbates him]]. When Johnny mentions that Matthew has been reported missing, Jennifer states that she killed him; as he nears [[orgasm]], she takes the knife Matthew brought with him and [[Emasculation|severs Johnny's genitals]]. She leaves the bathroom, locks the door, and listens to [[classical music]] as Johnny screams, bleeding to death. After he dies, she dumps his body in the basement and burns his clothes in the fireplace.\n\nStanley and Andy learn that Johnny is missing and take their boat to Jennifer's cabin. Andy goes ashore with an axe. Jennifer swims out to the boat and pushes Stanley overboard. Andy tries to attack her but she escapes with the axe. Andy swims out to rescue Stanley, but Jennifer plunges the axe into Andy's back, killing him. Stanley moves towards the boat and grabs hold of the motor to climb aboard, begging Jennifer not to kill him. She repeats the order he made to her during the sexual assaults, \"Suck it, bitch!\", then starts the motor, [[disemboweling]] him with the propeller as she speeds away.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Camille Keaton, circa 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|Camille Keaton starred in the film as Jennifer Hills.

Zarchi eventually chose to shoot in these locations because they provided a tranquil atmosphere for the film's [[antiheroine]], [[Jennifer Hills]].<ref name=\"commentary\"/> He spent four months writing the screenplay, the bulk of which was written at his usual [[New York City Subway|Subway]] route to his office in [[Times Square]] and back home where his wife would then [[typewriter|typewrite]] the handwritten pages in the evening. The typewriter his wife had used is seen in the film as the same one Jennifer uses to complete her manuscript.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nTo cast the stars, Zarchi put up a casting call advertisement in [[Backstage (magazine)|''Backstage'']] magazine that sought one woman and four men in their 20s to star in a low-budget production. [[Camille Keaton]] was one of over 4,000 actresses who auditioned for the role of Jennifer.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Zarchi set up an interview for Keaton and found her to be an \"experienced actress\" as well as \"beautiful and photogenic\". After a series of auditions to test Keaton's suitability for the role, Zarchi was convinced that she could play it effectively.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n==Release==\nZarchi was unable to find a distributor, so he distributed the film himself. ''Day of the Woman'' played a number of engagements in rural [[drive-in theater]]s, but only for brief runs each time, and Zarchi barely made back the money he had spent on advertising. In 1980, it was picked up for distribution by the Jerry Gross Organization. A condition of this re-release was that the distributors could change the title to anything they wished. It was at this time the film was retitled ''I Spit on Your Grave''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squabblebox.co.uk/2016/05/cult-corner-i-spit-on-your-grave-day-of-the-woman-1978/|title=Cult Corner: I Spit on Your Grave (Day of the Woman, 1978) - SquabbleBox.co.uk - Entertainment Under Attack|website=www.squabblebox.co.uk}}</ref> The movie did not have a theatrical release in the United Kingdom and was solely released on home video in that country.\n\n===Commercial performance===\nThe film did poorly at the box office but managed to have some success in videocassette sales. ''I Spit on Your Grave'' reached number 24 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''{{'s}} 1981 list of best-selling titles. The film stayed in the Billboard Video Cassette Top Forty for 14 consecutive weeks and won the number one best-selling video cassette award above more popular movies like ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] referred to it as \"a vile bag of garbage...without a shred of artistic distinction\", adding that \"Attending it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800716/REVIEWS/7160301/1023 |title= Review of ''I Spit on Your Grave'' |access-date=March 20, 2007 |author= Roger Ebert |author-link= Roger Ebert |date= July 16, 1980 |work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref> He mentioned in his review that a female member of the audience (one of many people who randomly talked aloud) had \"feminist solidarity for the movie's heroine\". He wrote, \"I wanted to ask if she'd been appalled by the movie's hour of rape scenes.\" Ebert was also one of many to cite the movie's poor production quality as a weakness in addition to the scenes he found offensive, stating \"The story of ''I Spit on Your Grave'' is told with moronic simplicity. These horrible events are shown with an absolute minimum of dialogue, which is so poorly recorded that it often cannot be heard. There is no attempt to develop the personalities of the characters - they are, simply, a girl and four men, one of them mentally retarded. The movie is nothing more or less than a series of attacks on the girl and then her attacks on the men, interrupted only by an unbelievably grotesque and inappropriate scene in which she enters a church and asks forgiveness for the murders she plans to commit.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800716/REVIEWS/7160301/1023 |work= Chicago Sun-Times |title= I Spit on Your Grave}}</ref> Ebert also included it on his \"most hated\" list and considered it to be the worst movie ever made.<ref>{{cite news |title= Video Q&A |author= Roger Ebert |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0U9IAAAAIBAJ&pg=2655,5621128&dq=roger+ebert+i+spit+on+your+grave+worst+ever&hl=en |newspaper=[[The Ledger]] |date= May 28, 1998 |access-date= November 3, 2013}}</ref> Both Ebert and fellow critic [[Gene Siskel]] lambasted the film on their television program ''[[Sneak Previews]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ebertpresents.com/movies/halloween/videos/268#ooid=92bmNyMjpQy8gFxO2bZLr-LDZFLxW6UI |title= Classics from the Vault: Women in Danger (1980) |publisher= Ebert Presents |access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> In a later episode, Siskel and Ebert chose the film as the worst film of 1980, with Ebert famously saying \"the people who made this film should really be ashamed of themselves, and so should the people who booked it and the people who went to see it \u2014\u00a0it's really an inhuman, sick film\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/K67XHXKYBXU4/Worst-of-1980|title=Siskel & Ebert org - Worst of 1980|website=siskelandebert.org|access-date=February 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108010735/http://siskelandebert.org/video/K67XHXKYBXU4/Worst-of-1980|archive-date=January 8, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Siskel would join Ebert in calling the film one of the worst ever made.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/175977821.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Aug%2017,%201983&author=&pub=Chicago%20Tribune&edition=&startpage=&desc=Tempo |title= 'Man Who Wasn't There' would best be left unseen |access-date= October 2, 2013 |author=Gene Siskel |author-link= Gene Siskel |date= August 17, 1983 |work= Chicago Tribune }}</ref>\n\nCritic Luke Y. Thompson of ''[[New Times LA|The New Times]]'' stated that \"defenders of the film have argued that it is actually pro-woman, due to the fact that the female lead wins in the end, which is sort of like saying that cockfights are pro-rooster because there is always one left standing\".<ref name=Spiton>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/i_spit_on_your_grave/ |title=I Spit on Your Grave (Day of the Woman) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> Film critic [[Mark Kermode]] has opined that it is \"deeply, deeply problematic at the very best of times\" and is not as interesting as earlier exploitation films such as ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''. Critic David Keyes named it the worst film of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Spiton\"/> This led to the film's removal from a major theatre.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\nA contributor to ''Encyclopedia of Horror'' notes that the film attracted much debate for and against, frequently involving people who clearly had not actually seen the film. \"The men are so grossly unattractive and the rapes so harrowing, long-drawn-out and starkly presented it is hard to imagine most male spectators identifying with the perpetrators, especially as the film's narrative structure and ''[[Mise en sc\u00e8ne|mise-en-scene]]'' force the spectator to view the action from Keaton's point of view. Further, there is no suggestion that she 'asked for it' or enjoyed it, except, of course, in the rapists' own perceptions, from which the film is careful to distance itself.\" The author continues that the scenes of revenge were \"grotesquely misread by some critics\", as Jennifer only \"pretends to have enjoyed the rape so as to lure the men to their destruction\", and that in these scenes the film is critiquing \"familiar male arguments about women 'bringing it on {{nowrap|themselves'{{hsp}}\"}} as \"simply sexist, self-excusing rhetoric and are quite clearly presented as such\".<ref name=\"Milne, Tom 1986. p 329\">Milne, Tom.

Michael Kaminski's 2007 article for the website ''Obsessed with Film'', titled \"Is ''I Spit on Your Grave'' Really A Misunderstood Feminist Film?\" argues that, when understood within the context in which director Zarchi was inspired to make it, the movie may be equally appropriate to analyze as \"feminist wish-fulfillment\" and a vehicle of personal expression reacting to [[violence against women]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/specials/is-i-spit-on-your-grave-really-a-misunderstood-feminist-film.php |title=Is I Spit on Your Grave Really a Misunderstood Feminist Film? |author=Michael Kaminski |date=October 29, 2007 |publisher=Obsessed With Film |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031004519/http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/specials/is-i-spit-on-your-grave-really-a-misunderstood-feminist-film.php|archive-date=October 31, 2007|url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA reappraisal was made by [[Carol J. Clover]] in the third chapter of her 1992 book ''[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws]]''. Clover notes that she and others like her \"appreciate, however grudgingly, the way in which [the movie's] brutal simplicity exposes a mainspring of popular culture\". Clover further argues that the film's sympathies are entirely with Jennifer, that the male audience is meant to identify with her and not with the attackers, and that the point of the film is a [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] identification with pain used to justify the bloody [[catharsis]] of revenge. Clover wrote that in her opinion, the film owes a debt to ''[[Deliverance]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Berlatsky |first=Noah |title=The Best Rape Deterrent Hollywood Has Ever Made |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/the-best-rape-deterrent-hollywood-has-ever-made/274223 |work=The Atlantic|date=March 21, 2013 |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |access-date=March 23, 2013}}</ref> The British feminist [[Julie Bindel]], who was involved in pickets outside cinemas in Leeds when the film was released, has said that she was wrong about the film and that it is a feminist film.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/19/wrong-about-spit-on-your-grave | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Julie | last=Bindel | title=Rape films vs realism \u2013 Julie Bindel | date=January 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''I Spit on Your Grave'' holds an approval rating of 53%, based on 36 reviews, and an average rating of 5.4/10.

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] tried to prevent the film's producers from using the R rating. After the association gave ''I Spit on Your Grave'' an R rating, the producer of the film added rape scenes, making it an X-rated movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/01/movies/i-spit-on-your-grave-opposed-on-r-rating.html |title='I Spit on Your Grave' Opposed on R Rating |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 1, 1984 |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Fangoria]]'', director Meir Zarchi said as a response to the backlash: {{blockquote|\"Frankly, I'm not concerned whether it receives bad press or not.

[[Canada]] initially banned the film, but in the 1990s decided to allow its individual provinces to decide whether to permit its release. Since 1998, some provinces (such as [[Manitoba]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Quebec]]) have released the film, with a rating that reflects its content.\n\nThe censored American version of the film was released in [[Australia]] in 1982 with an R 18+ rating. In 1987, the film survived an appeal to ban it. It continued to be sold until 1997, when another reclassification caused its ban in Australia. In 2004, the full uncut version was awarded an R 18+, lifting the seven-year ban. The Office of Film and Literature Classification justified this decision by reasoning that [[castration]] is not sexual violence (Australian censorship law forbids the release of films that depict scenes of sexual violence as acceptable or justified).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://refused-classification.com/Films_ISpitOnYourGrave.htm |title=Details for ''I Spit On Your Grave''}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the film was refused a cinema certificate by the British censors. However, since films on video did not need censor's certificates at the time, it was released on home video, where it was branded a \"[[video nasty]]\" by the press. It appeared on the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]]' list of prosecutable films until 2001 when a heavily cut version that extensively edited the rape scenes was released with an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]]. The cuts were reduced considerably from 7 minutes 2 seconds in the 2001 release to 2 minutes 54 seconds in the 2011 release so that only the scenes of rape that focus on Jennifer's nudity have been banned since the 2011 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/education/case-studies/i-spit-on-your-grave|title=Education / Case Studies: I Spit On Your Grave|date=August 5, 2020|publisher=BFI|access-date=November 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn [[New Zealand]], the uncut version of the film (102 minutes) was classified in 1984 as R20 with the descriptive note, \"Contains graphic violence, content may disturb\". Other versions with shorter running times (96 minutes) were also classified in 1984 and 1985 and received the same classification.\n\nThe [[Irish Film Classification Office]] has again banned the film from sale. Having been banned for many years in the country, the new Blu-ray and DVD uncensored edition have been prohibited from purchase by retailers due to the nature of the film.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.horrorsociety.com/2010/09/17/ireland-bans-i-spit-on-your-grave |title= Ireland Bans I Spit on your Grave |publisher= Horror Society |date= September 17, 2010 |access-date= November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Zarchi's inspiration and responses to criticism===\nIn the commentary for the Millennium Edition, Zarchi said he was inspired to produce the film after helping a young woman who had been raped in New York. He tells of how he, a friend and his daughter were driving by a park when they witnessed a young woman crawling out of the bushes bloodied and naked (he later learned the young woman was taking a common shortcut to her boyfriend's house when she was attacked). They collected the traumatized girl, returned the daughter home, and quickly decided it was best to take the girl to the police rather than a hospital, lest the attackers escape and find further victims.\n\nThey quickly decided that they had made the wrong decision &mdash; the officer, who Zarchi described as \"not fit to wear the uniform\", delayed taking her to the hospital and instead insisted that she follow formalities such as giving her full name (and the spelling), even though her jaw had been broken and she could hardly speak. Zarchi insisted that the officer take her to the hospital and he eventually complied. Soon afterward, the woman's father wrote both Zarchi and his friend a letter of thanks for helping his daughter.
