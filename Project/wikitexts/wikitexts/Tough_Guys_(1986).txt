It is the eighth film of [[Touchstone Pictures]], and the final film to be released from Douglas' [[Bryna Productions]].\n\nLancaster and Douglas had already made several films together, including ''[[I Walk Alone]]'' (1948), ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' (1957), ''[[The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)|The Devil's Disciple]]'' (1959), and ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), becoming something of a team in the public's eye.  Douglas was always second-billed under Lancaster but, with the exception of ''I Walk Alone'', in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were more or less of equal importance. ''Tough Guys'' was their final collaboration.\n\n[[Adolph Caesar]], who was originally going to star as Leon B. Little, died of complications from a heart attack on the set of the film<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert W. Stewart |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-03-07-me-16282-story.html%3f_amp=true|newspaper=latimes.com|title=Adolph Caesar : Fatal Heart Attack Fells Actor on Set|date=March 7, 1986|accessdate=July 19, 2020}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Eli Wallach]].\n\nThis was the first film released under the Touchstone Pictures name following his rebranding by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], after the release of [[Ruthless People]].\n\n== Plot ==\nHarry Doyle ([[Burt Lancaster]]) and Archie Long ([[Kirk Douglas]]) are gangsters who have served a 30-year prison sentence for [[Train robbery|hijacking]] a [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] train called the ''Gold Coast Flyer'' in 1956. When they are released from prison in 1986, their parole officer, Richie Evans ([[Dana Carvey]]), meets Harry and Archie at the gates and offers them a ride to collect their [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. Meanwhile, Leon B. Little ([[Eli Wallach]]), an elderly hitman with bad eyesight who still has an outstanding contract on them, immediately tries to kill them but Harry and Archie manage to get away.\n\nLater at the bank, the duo stop a bank robbery by taking down the two young armed gunmen, one of whom faints when un-armed Harry and Archie turn the tables on them. Then, outnumbered 3-to-one each, the duo trash six young street punks trying to rob them. At Richie's office, they are informed of the conditions of their parole. Harry, at age 72, is committed to a retirement community; despite his desire to work, he is informed he is past the mandatory retirement age of 70. Archie, still allowed to work at age 67, takes a job first at an ice cream parlor and later a restaurant. They are told not to have further contact with each other for at least three years, and are closely monitored by Richie and Deke Yablonski ([[Charles Durning]]), the police officer who first arrested the duo.\n\nBoth Harry and Archie are in for a shock at how much the world has changed from 1956 to 1986: clothing, sexual lifestyles (their old bar is now an openly gay men's club, women are more assertive), the advance of technology, and lack of respect from the younger generation. Archie's young female restaurant manager treats him badly, while Harry is denied proper food by a nasty retirement home orderly and receives worse treatment from the home's even nastier female manager. Harry reconnects with an old flame named Belle ([[Alexis Smith]]), and they sweetly reminisce about old times. Archie embraces the much changed contemporary scene and at a unisex high-tech gym, the young manager, Skye ([[Darlanne Fluegel]]), sets her sights on Archie as the only \"real man\" there. She gets Archie to adopt faddish clothes and invites him to a trendy disco nightclub where they gyrate to [[new wave music]], and they start a steamy affair which aging Archie cannot sustain.\n\nTired of trying to adjust to 1980s society under the eyes of the law, Harry and Archie go back to their old ways. First they try to reassemble their old gang for a bank robbery, but all surviving members are now either crippled or invalids. Then they hijack an armored truck, only to find it empty except for a roll of quarters, and are mocked by the media for their blunder. To add insult to injury, the two are mistaken for younger men in disguises. Meanwhile, Leon tracks Richie down at his office and retrieves the information on Harry's retirement home. He proceeds to hold Richie and Belle hostage at the retirement home until he sees Harry and Archie arrive and opens fire. Richie punches Leon to the ground and quickly escapes with the duo; before blaming himself for getting them into trouble. Archie decides to hijack the ''Gold Coast Flyer'' again as it makes its final southbound run after 50 years and asks Harry and Richie for their help. When both refuse to take part for moral reasons, Archie decides to do it by himself.\n\nArchie stops the ''Flyer'' just as it is leaving the railroad yard and is soon joined by Harry, having had a change of heart. The media and dignitaries aboard are surprised, although Harry and Archie gladly answer their questions and pose for pictures as they identify themselves and their ages. To their surprise, Leon arrives and explains that he had been paid $25,000 to kill them by an old enemy of theirs and he has waited 30 years for them to get out of prison. Deke soon arrives with a full [[Special Weapons Assault Team|SWAT team]] to capture Harry and Archie, who persuade Leon to call a temporary truce with them as they have never killed anyone in their crimes. As Leon escorts the passengers out of the train, Richie, disguised as a SWAT officer, sneaks aboard and gets it moving again to help Harry and Archie escape before Deke can arrest them.\n\nHarry, Archie, Richie, and Leon decide to take the train to [[Mexico]], but find that the tracks end only a few feet from the border. Harry pushes Leon off the train, to which he vows revenge. Archie then takes Richie back to the coaches and uncouples the train, advising Richie to downplay his role in the heist to not destroy his career. Harry and Archie drive the locomotive at full throttle through a fusillade of bullets from U.S. border police. They crash through, burying the engine partially in the soil of Mexico a few feet across the border, where a Mexican border patrol arrives to arrest them. True to their tough guy credo, Harry and Archie raise their hands but talk back to the patrol's commanding officer, leaving him puzzled enough that it gives an opening for Archie to kick him in the groin.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Burt Lancaster]] as Harold 'Harry' Doyle\n* [[Kirk Douglas]] as Archibald 'Archie' Long\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Sergeant Deke Yablonski\n* [[Alexis Smith]] as Belle\n* [[Dana Carvey]] as Richard 'Richie' Evans\n* [[Darlanne Fluegel]] as Skye\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as Leon B.
