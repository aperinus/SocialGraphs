Roosevelt National Historic Site|Roosevelt's country estate]].<ref name=Starr/><ref name=Swindell/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn spring 1939, [[Sara Delano]], the mother of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], asks his sixth cousin [[Margaret Suckley|Margaret \"Daisy\" Suckley]] to visit the ill President at their [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|country estate]] in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. Although Daisy and Roosevelt had not seen each other for years, the distant relatives form a strong relationship, and Roosevelt often asks Daisy to visit Hyde Park when he stays with his mother. Daisy becomes one of the women close to Roosevelt, including Sara; [[Missy LeHand]], the president's secretary; and [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]], the president's wife. Despite his power, the president is often unable to control the other women; the quiet, shy Daisy is his confidante, and he tells her that [[Top Cottage]] will be their shared refuge after his presidency.\n\nIn June 1939, [[King George VI]] and his wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], visit the United States, during which they stay with the Roosevelts at Hyde Park. The British hope the visit will improve the chances of American support during the future war with Germany. George\u2014who is King because his brother [[Edward VIII]] abdicated\u2014is nervous, because of the importance of the visit, because he [[stuttering|stutters]], and because of having to eat a [[hot dog]] for the first time at a picnic in his honor. Roosevelt reassures George by citing his own inability to walk, and observes others do not see their handicaps because \"it's not what they want to see\". The president tells the King he hopes to overcome Americans' reluctance to help Britain.\n\nThe night the king and queen arrive, Daisy discovers LeHand is having an affair with Roosevelt. LeHand tells a shocked Daisy their respective relationships with the president are not his only ones, mentioning [[Dorothy Schiff]] and [[Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd]], and Daisy must accept sharing Roosevelt with other women. At the picnic the next day, the king successfully eats a hot dog for a photo op, and Daisy, in a voiceover, states the visit helped the two countries form a [[Special Relationship]]. Daisy rejects Roosevelt's requests to see her until he calls on her in person. They reconcile, and Daisy accepts her role as one of the president's mistresses. As years pass, Daisy watches Roosevelt become frail as a wartime leader; nonetheless everyone, she says, \"still [looked] to him, still seeing whatever it was they wanted to see\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]\n* [[Laura Linney]] as [[Margaret Suckley|Margaret \"Daisy\" Suckley]]\n* [[Samuel West]] as [[George VI|King George VI]]\n* [[Olivia Colman]] as [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]\n* [[Elizabeth Marvel]] as [[Marguerite LeHand|Marguerite \u201cMissy\u201d LeHand]]\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as [[Sara Roosevelt|Sara Delano]]\n* [[Andrew Havill]] as [[James Cameron (journalist)|James Cameron]]\n* [[Eleanor Bron]] as Daisy's Aunt\n* Martin McDougall as [[Thomas Gardiner Corcoran]]\n\n==Production==\nScreenwriter [[Richard Nelson (playwright)|Richard Nelson]] was inspired by the story of Daisy Suckley after reading a posthumously published collection of her letters and diaries. He felt drawn to the story because of the unique perspective Daisy offered on a series of important historical events. He also connected with the setting, since Nelson lives in [[Rhinebeck (village), New York|Rhinebeck]] and had even met Daisy briefly before she died in 1991.\n\nOriginally conceived as an idea for a film, Nelson's choice of director, [[Roger Michell]], proved not immediately available. Nelson re-worked the script as a radio play, which was produced by the [[BBC]] in 2009, directed by [[Ned Chaillet]]. Once Michell became available, production began on the film.<ref>[http://newyork.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/hyde-park-screenwriter-discusses-his-inspiration-and-bill-murray-1.4286633 Hyde Park screenwriter discusses his inspiration and Bill Murray] Newsday  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327084339/http://newyork.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/hyde-park-screenwriter-discusses-his-inspiration-and-bill-murray-1.4286633 |date=27 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn early March 2011, director Michell started searching for U.S. actors to play President Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/03/film4-hunting-for-its-president-roosevelt/|title=Film4 Hunting For Its President Roosevelt|work=Deadline|date=25 March 2011|access-date=25 April 2012}}</ref> [[Bill Murray]] agreed to play Roosevelt in late March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2011/3/29/bill-murray-to-play-president-franklin-roosevelt-in-hyde-par.html|title=Bill Murray to play President Roosevelt in Hyde Park on Hudson|access-date=25 April 2012}}</ref> Production designer [[Simon Bowles]] created upstate New York in England where the entire film was shot.\n\n==Release==\n''Hyde Park on Hudson'' had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the 2012 [[Telluride Film Festival]] on 31 August 2012, then at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 10 September 2012, and again at the 2012 [[Savannah Film Festival]] on 31 October 2012, with limited release in the United States on 5<ref name=\"The Washington Post\">{{cite news|title=Focus Features \"Hyde Park on Hudson\"|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/conferences/hyde-park-on-hudson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505021348/http://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/conferences/hyde-park-on-hudson/|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2015|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=6 December 2012}}</ref> and 7 December 2012, and wide release in January 2013.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 37% based on 176 reviews, with an average rating of 5.26/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Though bolstered by a thoroughly charming performance by Bill Murray in the central role, ''Hyde Park on Hudson'' is an FDR biopic that lets down both its audience and its subject.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hyde_park_on_hudson|title=Hyde Park on Hudson (2012)|access-date=20 May 2020|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=Hyde Park on Hudson}}</ref>\n\n''[[The A.V.

Roosevelt is known to have had an affair with [[Lucy Page Mercer Rutherfurd|Lucy Mercer]] during [[World War I]]. However, there is no direct evidence that he had a similar relationship with Suckley,<ref name=\"nyttravel\"/><ref name=\"Starr\"/><ref name=\"Swindell\"/> though there was an emotional connection.<ref name=\"Starr\"/><ref name=\"Swindell\"/> Roosevelt apparently instructed Suckley to burn at least some of the letters he wrote to her,<ref name=\"nyttravel\"/> which has fueled speculation about their content.\n\nFocusing on how the historical events and people are portrayed, [[Conrad Black]], author of  ''Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom'', said the film took \"large, ... sometimes scurrilous, liberties with historical facts.\"<ref name=ConradBlack>{{cite news|last=Black|first=Conrad|title=FDR and Lincoln on Screen|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/336705/fdr-and-lincoln-screen-conrad-black?pg=1|access-date=3 January 2013|work=[[National Review Online]]|date=2 January 2013}}</ref> In particular, he stated the movie erred in its depiction both of Roosevelt's relationship with women and of Eleanor Roosevelt's sexuality.<ref name=ConradBlack />\n\nRoosevelt biographer Geoffrey Ward has written: \"It is true that [FDR and Daisy] drove to a hilltop that they loved at some point in 1935, and that something happened on that hilltop. I think he kissed her \u2013 which meant a great deal to both of them. And it started a long, first flirtatious and then very fond friendship.
