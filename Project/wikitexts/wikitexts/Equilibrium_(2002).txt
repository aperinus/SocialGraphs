After accidentally missing a dose, Preston begins to experience emotions, which makes him question his morality and moderate his actions while attempting to remain undetected by the suspicious society in which he lives. Ultimately, he aids a resistance movement using advanced [[martial arts]], which he was taught by the regime he is helping to overthrow.\n\n==Plot==\nLibria, a [[totalitarian state|totalitarian]] city-state established by survivors of [[World War III]], blames human emotion as the cause for the war. Any activity or object that stimulates emotion is strictly forbidden. Those in violation are labelled \"Sense Offenders\" and sentenced to death. The population is forced to take a daily injection of \"Prozium II\" to suppress emotion. Libria is governed by the Tetragrammaton Council, led by \"Father\", who communicates propaganda through giant video screens throughout the city. At the pinnacle of law enforcement are the Grammaton Clerics, trained in the martial art of [[Gun fu|gun kata]]. Clerics frequently raid homes to search for and destroy illegal materials \u2013 art, literature and music \u2013 executing violators on the spot. A resistance movement, known as the \"Underground\", emerges to topple Father and the Tetragrammaton Council.\n\n[[File:Flag of Libria (Equilibrium).svg|thumb|left|The flag of Libria. The four Ts on the flag represent the Tetragrammaton Council.]]\nIn 2072, John Preston is a high-ranking Cleric whose wife, Viviana, was executed as a Sense Offender, leaving him as a single parent of two. Following a raid, Preston notices his partner, Errol Partridge, saves a book of poems by [[W. B. Yeats]] instead of turning it in for incineration. He follows Partridge to the Nether \u2013 a term for regions outside the city \u2013 and finds him reading the book. After seeing Preston, Partridge claims he gladly pays the heavy price of feeling emotion; Preston executes him as Partridge slowly reaches for his gun.\n\nPreston accidentally breaks a daily vial of Prozium and is unable to replace it before going on the next raid. Brief episodes of emotion set in evoking memories, stirring feelings, and making him more aware of his surroundings. He intentionally skips additional doses of Prozium, hiding them behind the mirror in his bathroom. Partridge is replaced with an ambitious, career-conscious Brandt, who expresses admiration for Preston's \"uncompromising\" work as a Cleric. On a raid, they arrest Sense Offender Mary O'Brien. To Brandt's surprise, Preston prevents him from executing O'Brien, saying she should be kept alive for interrogation. Brandt grows suspicious of Preston's hesitation.\n\nPreston begins to feel remorse for killing Partridge, develops an emotional relationship with O'Brien, and seeks atonement. He uncovers clues that lead to meeting Jurgen, leader of the Underground. Jurgen is planning to disrupt Prozium production to spark a populist uprising and convinces Preston that Father must be assassinated. Vice-Counsel DuPont meets with Preston to reveal that there is a traitor in the upper ranks of the Clerics. Although DuPont initially suspects it is Preston, he assigns him the task of unmasking the traitor. Relieved, Preston accepts and promises to locate the Underground's leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, O'Brien is set to be executed, and Jurgen advises against interfering believing it could sabotage plans for the revolution. Unable to bear her death, Preston attempts to stop the execution and fails. He has an emotional breakdown and is arrested by Brandt, who brings him before DuPont. Preston tricks DuPont into believing that Brandt is the traitor. Following Brandt's arrest, Preston is told that his home will be searched as a formality. He rushes home to destroy the hidden vials only to discover his son, who stopped taking Prozium after his mother died, already has.\n\nJurgen tells Preston to capture the leaders of the resistance to regain government trust, hoping it will get Preston close enough to assassinate Father. Preston is granted an exclusive audience with Father only to discover that Brandt was not arrested; it was part of a ruse to expose Preston and the Underground. DuPont reveals he is Father, having secretly replaced the original Father who died, and that his cabal doesn't take Prozium to suppress emotion. He taunts Preston, asking how it felt to betray the Underground. Enraged, Preston fights his way through an army of bodyguards to DuPont's office, confronting and killing Brandt in a [[katana]] battle. DuPont and Preston engage in a gun kata showdown. Preston wins as DuPont pleads for his life asking, \"Is it really worth the price?\" Paying homage to Partridge's last words, he responds, \"I pay it gladly\" and kills DuPont. He destroys the command center that broadcasts Father propaganda. Preston watches with satisfaction from above as the Underground destroys Prozium manufacturing plants, signaling the beginning of the revolution.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Christian Bale]] as John Preston\n* [[Emily Watson]] as Mary O'Brien\n* [[Taye Diggs]] as Andrew Brandt\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as Vice Counsel DuPont\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Errol Partridge\n* Matthew Harbour as Robbie Preston\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Jurgen\n* [[Sean Pertwee]] as Father\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Proctor\n* Emily Siewert as Lisa Preston\n* Alexa Summer as Viviana Preston<ref group=\"VP\" name=\"wife\">Alexa Summer and Maria Pia Calzone portray the same character in the film, but appear in the credits separately as \"Viviana Preston\" and \"Preston's wife\" respectively.</ref>\n* [[Maria Pia Calzone]] as Preston's Wife<ref group=\"VP\" name=\"wife\"/>\n* [[Dominic Purcell]] as Seamus\n* [[Brian Conley]] as Reading Room Overseer\n* Kurt Wimmer (''cameo'') as Rebel Victim\n}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{reflist|group=\"VP\"}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Gun kata==\n{{see also|Gun fu}}\n[[Angus Macfadyen]]'s character, Vice-Counsel DuPont, describes the fictional fighting style ''gun kata'' in the film:\n\n<blockquote>Through analysis of thousands of recorded gunfights, the Cleric has determined that the geometric distribution of antagonists in any gun battle is a statistically-predictable element. The gun kata treats the gun as a total weapon, each fluid position representing a maximum kill zone, inflicting maximum damage on the maximum number of opponents, while keeping the defender clear of the statistically-traditional trajectories of return fire. By the rote mastery of this art, your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 120 percent. The difference of a 63 percent increased lethal proficiency makes the master of the gun katas an adversary not to be taken lightly.</blockquote>\n\n[[Kata]] (\u578b, \u304b\u305f) is a Japanese word for standard forms of movements and postures in [[karate]], [[jujutsu]], [[aikido]], and many other traditional martial arts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cynarski, Wojciech J., and Joanna Skowron|title=An analysis of the conceptual language used for the general theory of martial arts\u2013Japanese, Polish and English terminology|journal=Ido Movement for Culture.

Most of the filming used locations in [[Berlin]], due to its unique mixture of [[fascist architecture|fascist]] and [[modern architecture|modern]] architecture. According to the visual effects supervisor Tim McGovern, who worked alongside Wimmer, the fascist architecture was chosen \"to make the individual feel small and insignificant so the government seems more powerful\". The modern architecture of Berlin emphasizes the futuristic and stolid appearance of the city-state of Libria. Thick walls are represented by an abandoned [[East German]] military base, while the exterior of the city, where many of the surviving rebels reside, was filmed in decrepit neighborhoods of East Germany. In addition to the geographic location, a few European art directors also made substantial contributions to the production.<ref name=\"CSBC1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.compleatseanbean.com/equilibrium3.html|title=Equilibrium Production Notes |publisher=compleatseanbean.com|access-date=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Equilibrium''{{'s}} locations include:<ref name=\"CSBC1\"/>\n* [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)]], built for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].\n* [[Deutschlandhalle]], also built for the 1936 Summer Olympics.\n* [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin.\n* [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]], construction of which was begun before the Nazi era, but which was completed during [[World War II]] and displays characteristics of the Nazis' architectural style.\n* [[Bundestag (Berlin U-Bahn)]] station, a modern subway station near the new [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] along with long tunnels of the [[Berlin U-Bahn]] underground railway.
