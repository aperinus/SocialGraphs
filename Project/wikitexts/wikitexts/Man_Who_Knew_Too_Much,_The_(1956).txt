The film is Hitchcock's second film using this title, following his own [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|1934 film of the same name]] but featuring a significantly different plot and script.\n\nIn the book-length interview ''[[Hitchcock/Truffaut]]'' (1967), in response to fellow filmmaker [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, \"Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional.\"<ref name=S&S>{{cite web |last=Coe |first=Jonathan |title=The Man Who Knew Too Much |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/195 |url-status=dead |work=Sight and Sound |publisher=BFI |access-date=April 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803085949/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/195 |archive-date=August 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Truffaut |first=Francois |title=Hitchcock: A Definitive Study of Alfred Hitchcock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC&pg=PA94 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |date=October 2, 1985 |isbn=9780671604295}}</ref>\n\nThe film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)]]\", sung by Doris Day.

Traveling from [[Casablanca]] to [[Marrakesh]], they meet Frenchman Louis Bernard. He seems friendly, but Jo is suspicious of his many questions and evasive answers.\n\nBernard offers to take the McKennas to dinner, but cancels when a suspicious-looking man knocks at the McKennas' hotel-room door. At a restaurant, the McKennas meet friendly English couple Lucy and Edward Drayton. The McKennas are surprised to see Bernard arrive and sit elsewhere, apparently ignoring them.\n\nThe next day, visiting a Moroccan market with the Draytons, the McKennas see a man chased by police. After being stabbed in the back, the man approaches Ben, who discovers he is Bernard in disguise. The dying Bernard whispers that a foreign statesman will be assassinated in London and that Ben must tell the authorities about \"Ambrose Chappell\". Lucy returns Hank to the hotel while Ben, Jo and Edward go to a police station for questioning about Bernard's death. An officer explains that Bernard was a French Intelligence agent.\n\nBen receives a phone call at the police station; Hank was kidnapped but will not be harmed if the McKennas say nothing to the police about Bernard's warning. Knowing Hank was left in Lucy's care, Ben dispatches Edward to locate him. When Ben and Jo return to the hotel, they discover Edward checked out. Ben realizes the Draytons are the couple Bernard was looking for and are involved in Hank's abduction. When he learns the Draytons are from London, he decides he and Jo should go there and try to find them through Ambrose Chappell.\n\nIn London, [[Scotland Yard]]'s Inspector Buchanan tells Jo and Ben that Bernard was in Morocco to uncover an assassination plot; they should contact him if they hear from the kidnappers. Leaving friends in their hotel suite, the McKennas search for a person named Ambrose Chappell. Jo realizes that \"Ambrose Chapel\" is a place, and the McKennas arrive at the chapel to find Edward leading a service. Jo leaves the chapel to call the police. After Edward sends his parishioners home, Ben confronts him and is knocked out and locked inside. Jo arrives with police, but they cannot enter without a warrant.\n\nJo learns that Buchanan has gone to a concert at [[Royal Albert Hall]], and asks the police to take her there. Once the police and Jo leave, the Draytons take Hank to a foreign embassy. In the Royal Albert Hall lobby, Jo sees the man who came to her door in Morocco. When he threatens to harm Hank if she interferes, she realizes he is the assassin sent to kill the foreign prime minister.\n\nBen escapes the chapel through its bell tower and reaches the Royal Albert Hall, where Jo points out the assassin. Ben searches the balcony boxes for the killer, who is waiting for a cymbal crash to mask his gunshot. Just before the cymbals crash, Jo screams and the assassin misses his mark, only wounding his target. Ben struggles with the would-be killer, who falls to his death.\n\nConcluding that Hank is likely to be at the embassy, but that it is sovereign and exempt from an investigation, the McKennas secure an invitation from the grateful prime minister. The ambassador organized the plot to kill the prime minister, and blames the failed attempt on the Draytons. Knowing that Hank can testify against them, he orders the Draytons to kill the boy.\n\nThe prime minister asks Jo to sing. She loudly performs \"[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)|Que Sera, Sera]]\", so that Hank will hear her. Lucy, who is guarding Hank while Edward prepares to murder him, is distressed at the prospect of killing a child, so she encourages the boy to whistle along with the song. Ben finds Hank. Edward tries escaping with them at gunpoint, but when Ben hits him, he falls down the stairs to his death.\n\nThe McKennas return to their hotel suite. Ben explains to their now-sleeping friends, \"I'm sorry we were gone so long, but we had to go over and pick up Hank.\"\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], please do not exceed 700 words for the plot summary. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[James Stewart]] as Dr. Benjamin \"Ben\" McKenna\n* [[Doris Day]] as Josephine \u201cJo\u201d Conway McKenna\n* [[Bernard Miles]] as Edward Drayton \n* [[Brenda de Banzie]] as Lucy Drayton\n* [[Christopher Olsen (actor)|Christopher Olsen]] as Henry \"Hank\" McKenna\n* [[Ralph Truman]] as Inspector Buchanan\n* [[Daniel G\u00e9lin]] as Louis Bernard\n* [[Mogens Wieth]] as Ambassador\n* [[Alan Mowbray]] as Val Parnell\n* [[Hillary Brooke]] as Jan Peterson\n* [[Reggie Nalder]] as Rien\n* [[Richard Wattis]] as Assistant Manager\n* [[Noel Willman]] as Woburn\n* [[Alix Talton]] as Helen Parnell\n* [[Yves Brainville]] as Police Inspector in Marrakech\n* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Cindy Fontaine\n* [[John Barrard]] as Taxidermist (uncredited)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140908202955/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/31108/The-Man-Who-Knew-Too-Much/cast Acting Cast List for ''The Man Who Knew Too Much''] - ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] is a signature occurrence in most of his films.

The studio agreed it was a picture that could be well-adapted to the new decade. The Royal Albert Hall sequence drew some inspiration from [[H.M. Bateman]]'s comic \"The One-Note Man\", which followed the daily life of a musician who plays only one note in a symphony, similar to the cymbal player in the film.<ref>Hitchcock/Truffaut, p. 92</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nScreenwriter [[John Michael Hayes]] was hired on the condition that he would not watch the early version nor read its script, with all the plot details coming from a briefing with Hitchcock.<ref name=\"DeRosa2001\">DeRosa, Steven.

Herrmann was given the option of composing a new cantata to be performed during the film's climax. However, he found Arthur Benjamin's cantata ''Storm Clouds'' from the original 1934 film to be so well suited to the film that he declined, although he did expand the orchestration, and inserted several repeats to make the sequence longer. Herrmann can be seen conducting the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] with mezzo-soprano [[Barbara Howitt]] and chorus during the [[Royal Albert Hall]] scenes. The sequence in the Royal Albert Hall runs for 12 minutes without any dialogue from the beginning of ''Storm Clouds Cantata'' until the climax when Doris Day's character screams.<ref>{{cite web |title=Benjamin, A: The Storm Clouds Cantata from The Man Who Knew Too Much |url=http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/w/201770/Arthur-Benjamin-The-Storm-Clouds-Cantata-from-The-Man-Who-Knew-Too-Much |work=prestoclassical.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nDoris Day's character in the film is a well-known, now retired, professional singer, and at two points in the film she sings the [[Jay Livingston|Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans|Evans]] song \"[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)]]\", a performance which won the 1956 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].
