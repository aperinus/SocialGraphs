It centers on the plight of [[Chola (Mexican subculture)|cholas]] (and their male counterparts, [[Cholo (subculture)|cholos]]) growing up in the [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] section of [[Los Angeles]], who face the struggles of friendship, romantic entanglements, motherhood & gang membership.\n\nAt the time of filming, most of the cast was made up of unknown actors, some of whom were actual gang members from Echo Park. It also includes the first film appearances from [[Salma Hayek]] and [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]], in small roles.\n\n==Plot==\n''Mi Vida Loca'' tells the story of young [[Mexican-American]] women in [[Los Angeles]] and the struggles they have in a life of poverty and early motherhood while being members of an infamous street gang. Mousie and Sad Girl are best friends from childhood, growing up in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]], a neighborhood that had a significant amount of gang activity in the late 1980s and early 1990s era.\n\nThey pride themselves for remaining loyal to each other and their gang. But when Sad Girl sleeps with Mousie's boyfriend (a member of their neighborhood gang who is killed in a drug deal gone bad) and becomes pregnant, their friendship is ruptured.\n\nAs dramatic and occasional comical situations unfold around them, some that would turn violent, they must try to stay together as friends despite the betrayals, heartbreak and tragedies. The film takes a rather independent look at a world where women seem to have no choice but to raise their children, involve themselves with gang activity, and survive by whatever means available.\n\n==Cast==\n* Angel Aviles as Mona \"Sad Girl\"\n* [[Seidy L\u00f3pez]] as Maribel \"Mousie\"\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as Ernesto \"Bullet\"\n* Nelida Lopez as \"Whisper\"\n* Marlo Marron as Angelica \"Giggles\"\n* Christina Solis as \"Baby Doll\"\n* Arthur Esquer as \"Shadow\"\n* Julian Reyes as \"Big Sleepy\"\n* Gabriel Gonzales as \"Sleepy\"\n* Magali Alvarado as Alicia \"La Blue Eyes\"\n* [[Jesse Borrego]] as Juan \"El Duran\" Temido\n* Bertila Damas as Rachel\n* Monica Lutton as Chucky\n* Devine as \"Devine\"\n* Veronica Arrellano as \"Stranger\"\n* Panchito G\u00f3mez as \"Joker Bird\"\n* Noah Verduzco as \"Chuco\"\n* Angelo Martinez as \"Rascal\"\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Frank \"Casual Dreamer\"\n* Eddie Perez as \"Sir Speedy\"\n* Desire Galvez as \"Dimples\"\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as \"Gata\"\n* [[Los Lobos]] as Party Band\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Teenage Drug Customer\n* [[Spike Jonze]] as Teenage Drug Customer\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Mi Vida Loca (soundtrack)}}\nA soundtrack containing hip hop and contemporary R&B was released on March 8, 1994 by [[Mercury Records]].
