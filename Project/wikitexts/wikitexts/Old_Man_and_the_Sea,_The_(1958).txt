The screenplay by [[Peter Viertel]] was based on the [[The Old Man and the Sea|1952 novel of the same name]] by [[Ernest Hemingway]].\n\n[[Dimitri Tiomkin]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] for his work on the film. The film was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Color Cinematography]] ([[James Wong Howe|Howe]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Tracy).\n\n==Plot==\nThe Old Man in the film is a Cuban fisherman who has gone 84 days without a catch. His only friend is a 14-year-old boy named Manolin, who has been barred by his father from accompanying the Old Man out to sea. On the Old Man's 85th day out, he finally hooks a huge [[marlin]], which he then tries to haul in from far out past shore. For three days and nights he battles the fish, which is portrayed in the film (as it had been in Hemingway's novella) as a trial of mental and physical courage that becomes the ultimate test for him of his worth as a man.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as The Old Man\n* Felipe Pazos Jr. as Manolin{{Efn|Felipe Pazos Jr., who played the role of the boy in the film, is the son of the Cuban economist and revolutionary, [[Felipe Pazos]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}}}\n* [[Harry Bellaver]] as Martin\n* [[Don Diamond]] as Caf\u00e9 proprietor\n* Don Blackman as Arm wrestler\n* Joey Ray as a gambler\n* Richard Alameda as a gambler\n* Tony Rosa as a gambler\n* Carlos Rivero as a gambler\n* Robert Alderette as a gambler\n* [[Don Alvarado]] (uncredited) as a waiter\n\n==Production==\nThe director originally assigned to the film was [[Fred Zinnemann]], but he withdrew, and was replaced by [[John Sturges]].<ref name=\"timemag\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/52685|title = AFI&#124;Catalog}}</ref> The film's budget, originally $2 million, grew to $5 million \"in search of suitable fish footage.\"<ref name=\"timemag\"/> Sturges called it \"technically the sloppiest picture I have ever made.\"<ref name=\"timemag\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Turner Classic Movies]], a February 2005 [[CNN]] article points out that ''The Old Man and the Sea'' was one of the first films to \"use a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] compositing technology invented by [[Arthur Widmer]], that combined actors on a soundstage with a pre-filmed background.\"<ref name=\"tcmnotes\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=85500&category=Notes | title= Notes for ''The Old Man and the Sea'' (1958)| publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] | access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>\n\nThe credits note that \"Some of the marlin film used in this picture was of the world's record catch by Alfred C.

His soundtrack recording, with the Warner Brothers Studio Orchestra, was recorded in the auditorium of Hollywood Post No. 43, [[The American Legion|American Legion]], in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that the acoustics in the Hollywood Legion were \"far superior to most studio space in Hollywood and similar to that of the best concert halls.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AoEAAAAMBAJ&dq=Billboard+reported+that+the+acoustics+in+the+Hollywood+Legion+were+%22far+superior+to+most+studio+space+in+Hollywood+and+similar+to+that+of+the+best+concert+halls.%22&pg=PA4|title=Billboard|date=1958-04-28|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> During the week of April 21, 1958, Columbia held open sessions for ''The Old Man and the Sea'' at the Legion Hall. The soundtrack was later released in both stereo and mono by [[Columbia Records]].\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n<blockquote>Credit [[Leland Hayward]] for trying something off the beaten track in making a motion-picture version of Ernest Hemingway's ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and credit [[Spencer Tracy]] for a brave performance in its one big role. Also credit [[Dimitri Tiomkin]] for providing a musical score that virtually puts Mr. Tracy in the position of a soloist with a symphony. And that just about completes a run-down of the praiseworthy aspects of this film.</blockquote>\nAmong the film's shortcomings, Crowther notes, is that \"an essential feeling of the sweep and surge of the open sea is not achieved in precise and placid pictures that obviously were shot in a studio tank. There are, to be sure, some lovely long shots of Cuban villages and the colorful coast...But the main drama, that of the ordeal, is played in a studio tank, and even some fine shots of a [[marlin]] breaking the surface and shaking in violent battle are deflated by obvious showing on the process screen.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\nThe film has been described as the \"most literal, word-for-word rendition of a written story ever filmed\".<ref name=\"tcmnotes\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' noted that \"the script follows the book in almost every detail\", but called the novel a [[fable]] \"no more suitable for the screen than ''[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]''\".<ref name=\"timemag\"/> ''Time'' pointed out that Tracy was \"never permitted to catch a marlin\" while on location, so the \"camera could never catch him at it\" and the result is \"Sturges must cross-cut so interminably&mdash;fish, Tracy, fish, Tracy&mdash;that Old Man loses the lifelikeness, the excitement, and above all the generosity of rhythm that the theme requires.<ref name=\"timemag\"/>\n\nAccording to producer Hayward, Hemingway was pleased with the film, and said it had \"a wonderful emotional quality and [he] is very grateful and pleased with the transference of his material to the screen. He thought Tracy was great (in light of his quarrels with him this is quite a compliment) ... the photography was excellent ... the handling of the fishing and mechanical fish very good. Had some minor dislikes ... but all in all he was terribly high on the picture and pleased with it.\"<ref>Curtis, James (2011). ''Spencer Tracy: A Biography.'' London: Hutchinson. pp. 744-745. The notes for this page attribute the quotation as follows: \"Leland Hayward as reported to Jack L. Warner by Steve Trilling, 3/10/58, Jack Warner Collection, University of Southern California.\"</ref> Hemingway was notorious for his dislike for most of the film adaptations of his stories, and in 1959, he implicitly disagreed with Hayward's assessment, stating that the only Hollywood adaptation of one of his stories that he liked was ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/ernest-hemingway-the-killers-criterion-siodmak-don-siegel-tarkovsky/Content?oid=18473617|title=How one Hemingway short story became three different movies|last=Jones|first=J.
