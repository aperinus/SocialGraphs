Set in 1949\u201350 in [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], it tells the story of a married, but separated, American reporter Mark Elliot (played by [[William Holden]]), who falls in love with a [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] doctor originally from [[China]], Han Suyin (played by [[Jennifer Jones]]), only to encounter prejudice from her family and from Hong Kong society.\n\nThe film was adapted by [[John Patrick (dramatist)|John Patrick]] from the 1952 [[autobiographical novel]] ''[[A Many-Splendoured Thing]]'' by [[Han Suyin]]. The film was directed by [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]].\n\nThe film later inspired a television soap opera in 1967, though [[Love Is a Many Splendored Thing (TV series)|without the hyphen in the show's title]].\n\n==Summary==\nA widowed Eurasian doctor Han Suyin (Jones) falls in love with a married-but-separated American correspondent Mark Elliott (Holden) in Hong Kong, during the period of [[Chinese Civil War|China's Civil War]] in the late 1940s. Although they find brief happiness together, she is ostracized by the greater Chinese community. After losing her position at the hospital, Suyin and her adopted daughter go to live with a friend while Mark is on an assignment during the [[Korean War]]. They write to each other constantly. She receives word Mark was killed and she goes to visit their favorite hilltop meeting place.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Jones in Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Jennifer Jones]] as Dr. Han Suyin]]\n* [[William Holden]] as Mark Elliott\n* [[Jennifer Jones]] as Dr. Han Suyin\n* [[Torin Thatcher]] as Humphrey Palmer-Jones\n* [[Isobel Elsom]] as Adeline Palmer-Jones\n* [[Murray Matheson]] as Dr. John Keith\n* [[Virginia Gregg]] as Anne Richards\n* [[Richard Loo]] as Robert Hung\n* [[Soo Yong]] as Nora Hung\n* [[Philip Ahn]] as Third Uncle\n* [[Donna Martell]] as Suchen, Suyin's sister\n* [[James Hong]] (uncredited)\n* [[Keye Luke]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe rights to the novel were bought by [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] of 20th Century Fox for the producer [[Sol C. Siegel]].<ref>Epstein. Page 317.</ref> However, when he left the company the project was given to [[Buddy Adler]]. The screenplay struggled to get [[Motion Picture Production Code]] approval because of its themes of adultery and [[miscegenation]].<ref>{{AFI film|id=51570}}</ref>\n\nParts of the film were shot on location in [[Hong Kong]] by second-unit director [[Otto Lang (film producer)|Otto Lang]], which was unusual for its time. Two weeks of location filming in Hong Kong had been completed before the final screenplay had been finished by screenwriter John Patrick. He then had to adapt the screenplay to include as many of the shots as possible.\n\nDespite the film's romantic subject and their chemistry on the screen, Holden and Jones could barely stand each other on set. Holden was turned off by Jones' obsessive involvement with her character and complaints about her makeup (which she said made her \"look old\"), about her costumes and about her dialogue. Soon they were barely speaking to one another. According to Holden's biography, Jones was also generally rude and abrasive to everyone involved in the production.<ref name=\"holden\">{{cite book|author=Michelangelo Capua|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMp6ACb74UkC&q=Jennifer+Jones+holden+love+is+a+splendored&pg=PA88|title=William Holden: A Biography|publisher=McFarland|year=2009|pages=87\u201390|isbn=9780786444403}}</ref>\nTheir relationship was also not helped by Jones' worries about Holden's reputation as a womanizer. Holden claimed she chewed garlic before her love scenes, which she may have done to discourage him.<ref>Epstein. Page 321.</ref> Once, Holden tried to make peace, offering Jones a bouquet of white roses, which she tossed back in his face.\n\nThe film was completed on time, within the planned three-months schedule.\n\n===Locations===\n[[File:41A Conduit Road Hongkong.jpg|thumb|The Foreign Correspondents' Club, then located at 41A [[Conduit Road]], is portrayed in the film as a hospital.

It was extensively developed and woven into the film's orchestral score by [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] and his choral director [[Ken Darby]]. To make it eligible for the Best Original Song category of the Academy Awards lyrics were subsequently added.  The original lyrics were rejected by the studio so new ones were written.<ref>Epstein. Page 322.</ref> The resulting sentimental and upbeat song, \"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing\" was one of the first songs written for a&nbsp;movie to reach No. 1 in the charts in the same year.\n\nThe song was subsequently recorded by [[The Four Aces]] and also by [[Jerry Vale]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Danny Williams (singer)|Danny Williams]], and [[Frank Sinatra]], among others. Italian-language versions were recorded by [[Nancy Cuomo]], [[Neil Sedaka]], and [[Connie Francis]]. Francis also recorded the song with its original English lyrics, and a German-language version, ''Sag, wei\u00dft du denn, was Liebe ist''.\n\nThe song's lyrics relate:\n\n{{poemquote|Love is nature's way of giving\na reason to be living,\nThe golden crown that makes a man a king.}}\n\nDuring the film, charged romantic moments occur on a high grassy, windswept hill in [[Hong Kong]]. In the bittersweet final scene on the hilltop, the song (heard on the sound track) recalls the earlier encounters:\n\n{{poemquote|Once on a high and windy hill,\nIn the morning mist, Two lovers kissed,\nAnd the world stood still.}}\n\nThe theme song won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1950s|Academy Award for Best Song]], and the recording by The Four Aces went to [[Number-one hits of 1955 (United States)|#1 on the charts for three weeks in 1955]], shortly before [[rock and roll]] became a dominant force on the charts. Newman's orchestral score, which made heavy use of Fain's tune, also received an Oscar.\n\n[[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] made the complete original soundtrack available on compact disc in 2002, limiting the pressing to 2,000 copies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1955]]\n* [[List of films set in Hong Kong]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book | last = Epstein | first = Edward Z. | title = Portrait of Jennifer Jones | location = New York | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 1995 | type = Hardback | isbn = 0-671-74056-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/portraitofjennif00epst }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title| id = 0048316 | title = Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|love_is_a_many_splendored_thing}}\n* {{amg movie|30350}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=81996}}\n* {{AFI film|id=51570|title=Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing}}\n* Song lyrics (of The Four Aces), webpage: [http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/the_four_aces/love_is_a_many_splendored_thing.html OldieLyrics-The_Four_Aces].\n* [http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/35/3500490.pdf \"Hong Kong as City/Imaginary in ''The World of Suzie Wong'', ''Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'', and ''Chinese Box''\", by Thomas Y.
