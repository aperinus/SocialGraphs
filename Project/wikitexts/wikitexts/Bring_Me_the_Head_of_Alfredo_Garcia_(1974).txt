The film was a [[Box office bomb|box office]] and critical failure at the time, but has [[Cult following|gained a new following and stature]] in the decades since.<ref>[https://www.locarnofestival.ch/pardo/program/film.html?fid=816016&eid=68 Retrospettiva Sam Peckinpah: Films - Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia] [[Locarno Festival]]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nTeresa, the pregnant teenage daughter of a powerful Mexican crime lord known only as {{lang|es|El Jefe}} ({{Langnf||Spanish|'The Boss'}}), is summoned before her father and interrogated as to the identity of her unborn child's father. Under torture, she identifies the father as Alfredo Garcia, whom El Jefe had been grooming to be his successor. Infuriated, El Jefe offers a $1 million bounty to whoever will \"bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia\".\n\nThe search progresses for two months. In Mexico City, a pair of business suit-clad, dispassionate hit men, Sappensly and Quill, enter a saloon and encounter Bennie, a retired U.S. Army officer who makes a meagre living as a piano player and bar manager. The men ask about Garcia, believing they will have more luck getting answers out of a fellow American. Bennie plays dumb, saying the name is familiar but he doesn't know who Garcia is.\n\nIt turns out that everyone in the bar knows who Garcia is; they simply don't know where he is. Bennie goes to meet his girlfriend, Elita, a maid at a ghetto motel. Elita admits to having cheated on Bennie with Garcia, who had professed his love for her, something Bennie refuses to do. Elita tells him that Garcia died in a drunk-driving accident the previous week.\n\nBennie goes to Sappensly and Quill in the hotel room of the man who hired them, El Jefe's business associate Max, and makes a deal for $10,000 for Garcia's head, plus a $200 advance for expenses. Bennie convinces Elita to go on a road trip with him to visit Garcia's grave, claiming that he only wants proof that Garcia is in fact dead and no longer a threat to their relationship.\n\nBennie proposes to Elita, promising that their future will soon change and she can retire from her cleaning job. Elita warns Bennie against trying to upset their status quo. While having a picnic, Bennie and Elita are accosted by two bikers who pull guns on the couple. Elita agrees to have sex with the bikers if they spare Bennie's life, then goes off with one of them. He rips off her shirt, lets her slap him twice, slaps her back, then walks away; she follows. Bennie knocks the second biker unconscious and takes his gun. Finding Elita about to have sex with the first biker, Bennie shoots him dead and then kills the second biker as well.\n\nBennie confesses to Elita his plan to decapitate Garcia's corpse and sell the head for money. A disgusted Elita, still shaken from what has just happened, begs Bennie to give up this quest and return to Mexico City. Bennie again refuses, although he agrees to marry Elita in the church of the town where Garcia is buried. They find Garcia's grave, but when he opens the coffin, Bennie is struck from behind by an unseen assailant and knocked unconscious. He wakes up to find himself half-buried in the grave, and Elita is dead. Garcia's corpse has been decapitated.\n\nBennie learns from villagers that his assailants are driving a station wagon. He catches up with the men after they blow out a tire. Bennie shoots them, searches their car, and claims Garcia's head. Stopping at a roadside restaurant, he packs the sack containing the head with ice to preserve it for the journey home. Bennie talks to the head as if Garcia were still alive, first blaming Alfredo for Elita's death and then conceding that both of them probably loved her equally.\n\nBennie is ambushed by members of Garcia's family. They reclaim the head and are about to kill Bennie when they are interrupted by the arrival of Sappensly and Quill. The hit men pretend to ask for directions. Quill produces a sub-machine gun and murders most of the family, but is fatally shot by one of them. As Sappensly sorrowfully looks at Quill's corpse, Bennie asks: \"Do I get paid?\" Sappensly turns to shoot, but Bennie kills him. Bennie returns to Mexico City, \"arguing\" with Garcia's head all the while.\n\nAt his apartment Bennie gives Garcia's head a shower and then brings it to Max's hotel room. Feigning willingness to surrender the head for his $10,000, Bennie reveals he is no longer motivated by money; he says Alfredo was a friend of his and demands to know why Max and the others want his head so badly. He also blames Elita's death on the bounty. Several men pull guns but Bennie evades their fire and kills them all. He takes a business card from the desk with El Jefe's address on it.\n\nAfter attending the baptism for his new grandchild, El Jefe greets Bennie as a hero in his hacienda, and gives him a briefcase containing the million-dollar bounty. Bennie calmly relates how many people died for Garcia's head, including his beloved. El Jefe tells Bennie to take his money and throw the head to the pigs on the way out. Infuriated that the object responsible for Elita's death is viewed as nothing more than garbage, Bennie guns down all of El Jefe's bodyguards.\n\nTeresa enters with her newborn son, causing Bennie to hesitate shooting El Jefe. She urges Bennie to kill her father. Bennie obliges and leaves El Jefe's hacienda with Teresa, taking along Garcia's head. They approach the entrance gate and Bennie says goodbye to Teresa, departing the scene with the words: \"You take care of the boy. And I'll take care of the father\". Bennie drives away, only to be killed by El Jefe's men, their machine guns tearing him to pieces.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Warren Oates]] as Bennie\n* [[Isela Vega]] as Elita\n* [[Robert Webber]] as Sappensly\n* [[Gig Young]] as Johnny Quill\n* [[Helmut Dantine]] as Max\n* [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez]] as {{lang|es|El Jefe}}\n* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as the biker\n* [[Donnie Fritts]] as the second biker\n\n==Development==\nDirector Sam Peckinpah was working on ''[[The Ballad of Cable Hogue]]'' when screenwriter and long-time friend Frank Kowalski told him an idea for a film: \"I got a great title: {{'}}''Bring Me the Head of''...,' - and he had some other name - 'and the hook is that the guy is already dead'.\"{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=189}} Peckinpah loved it, and began writing on it then and also in England while making ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]''. He went on to write the shooting screenplay with Gordon Dawson. Producer [[Martin Baum (agent)|Martin Baum]] had formed his own independent production company, Optimus Productions, and had a deal with [[United Artists]]. Peckinpah approached him with 25 pages of the film's script. Baum read it and liked it. United Artists agreed to pay Peckinpah to write the script but he told Baum that he did not want any money for it because he owed him one. Peckinpah told Baum that if United Artists liked the script then they could pay him.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=189}}\n\nPeckinpah started pre-production in mid-August 1973 in [[Mexico City]].{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=190}} With the exception of a few key people, the crew was entirely Mexicans. He hired director of photography Alex Phillips, Jr., one of Mexico's premiere cameramen. They bonded over a dislike for wide-angle lenses, an admiration for zooms and multiple camera setups. Peckinpah told him, \"I make very few takes, but I shoot a lot of film because I like to change angles. I shoot with editing in the back of my mind\".{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=190}} While scouting locations, he relied extensively on his gut instinct and desire to portray a gritty, realistic vision he had of Mexico. He spent a lot of time searching for the right bar that would be Bennie's workplace.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=192}} Peckinpah finally discovered a place in the [[Plaza Garibaldi]] known as \"Tlaque-Paque\". He looked around and said, \"this is dressed. This is for real\".{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=192}} Mexican members of the crew told him that the bar's owner had an infamous reputation and it was rumored that he once killed a woman there, serving very little jail time because he bribed the right people in positions of power.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=193}}\n\n''Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia'' went into production in late September 1973, and Peckinpah was quoted in an October issue of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine as saying, \"For me, Hollywood no longer exists. It's past history. I've decided to stay in Mexico because I believe I can make my pictures with greater freedom from here\".{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=196}} This upset the Motion Picture and Television Unions and they openly censured the director for his statement at their National Conference in Detroit. They also threatened ''Alfredo Garcia'' with union boycotts upon its release, labeling it a \"runaway\" production.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=196}} In his defense, Peckinpah claimed that he was misquoted. Before the film was to be released, the unions relented on their boycott threat.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=197}}\n\nAs principal photography continued into the month of December, the demands\u2014both physical and mental\u2014were taking their toll on the cast and crew.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=201}} To help relieve the tension, Peckinpah and the producers bought out a local bar and threw a surprise party. Principal photography ended three days before Christmas, and the director took a week off before supervising the editing of the film.{{sfn|Simmons|1982|p=205}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn its release in 1974, ''Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garc\u00eda'' was savaged by many critics<ref name=\"ebert 2001\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-bring-me-the-head-of-alfredo-garcia-1974 |title=Great Movies: Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=October 28, 2001 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=May 12, 2019 }}</ref> and bombed at the box office.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Ian |title=Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia |location=London |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2011 |page=26 |isbn=978-1-906660-32-1}}</ref> [[Nora Sayre]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film started off well but \"disentegrates rapidly,\" explaining: \"Without Garcia as a victim, the plot has almost nowhere to go.

A hooker and a prospector hook up in 'Cable Hogue,' the pairing of Bennie and Elita in 'Alfredo Garcia' is equally affecting.
