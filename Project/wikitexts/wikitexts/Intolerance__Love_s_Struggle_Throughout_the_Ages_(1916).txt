W. Griffith]]. Subtitles include '''''Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages''''' and '''''A Sun-Play of the Ages'''''.<ref name=\"IN\">[[Internet Archive]] for [https://archive.org/details/Intolerance Intolerance (1916), D. W. Griffith.] <!-- Aside from YouTube version (from Google), the preceding version is the #1 \"public domain\" version the film, as a Google search indicates. --> Retrieved May 21, 2016.</ref><ref name=filmsite />\n\nRegarded as one of the most influential films of the [[Silent film|silent era]] (though it received mixed reviews at the time),<ref name=Rapold /> the three-and-a-half-hour epic intercuts four parallel storylines, each separated by several centuries: first, a contemporary melodrama of crime and redemption; second, a Judean story: [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s mission and death; third, a French story: the events surrounding the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572; and fourth, a Babylonian story: the [[Battle of Opis|fall of the Babylonian Empire]] to Persia in 539 BC. Each story had its own distinctive [[Colour Tint|color tint]] in the original print.<ref name=filmsite /> The scenes are linked by shots of a figure representing Eternal Motherhood, rocking a cradle.<ref name=filmsite />\n\nGriffith chose to explore the theme of [[Toleration|intolerance]] partly in response to his previous film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) being derided by the [[NAACP]] and others for perpetuating and supporting [[racial stereotype]]s and glorifying the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name=NAACP /><ref name=TCMarticle /> ''Intolerance'' was not, however, an apology, as Griffith felt he had nothing to apologize for;<ref name=Rapold /> in numerous interviews, Griffith made clear that the film was a rebuttal to his critics and he felt that they were, in fact, the intolerant ones.<ref name=McEwan /> In the years following its release, ''Intolerance'' strongly influenced European film movements. In 1958, the film was voted number 7 on the [[Expo 58#International film poll|Brussels 12]] list at the 1958 World Expo. In 1989, it was one of the first films to be selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n[[File:Intolerance (1916).ogv|thumb|'''PLAY''' ''Intolerance'' (1916), Collection [[National Film Registry]], runtime 02:56:26]]\n\n== Storylines ==\n\nThe film consists of four distinct, but parallel, stories\u2014intercut with increasing frequency as the film builds to a climax\u2014that demonstrate humankind's persistent intolerance throughout the ages. The timeline covers approximately 2,500 years.\n\n# The ancient \"[[Babylonia]]n\" story (539 BC) depicts the conflict between Prince [[Belshazzar]] of [[Babylon]] and [[Cyrus the Great]] of [[Persia]]. The [[fall of Babylon]] is a result of intolerance arising from a conflict between devotees of two rival Babylonian gods\u2014[[Bel-Marduk]] and [[Ishtar]].\n# The [[Biblical]] \"[[Judea]]n\" story (c. AD 27) recounts how\u2014after the [[Wedding at Cana]] and the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|Woman Taken in Adultery]]\u2014intolerance led to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. This sequence is the shortest of the four.\n# The [[Renaissance]] \"French\" story (1572) tells of the religious intolerance that led to the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] of Protestant [[Huguenot]]s fomented by the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic]] Royal [[House of Valois]].\n# The American \"Modern\" story (c. 1914) demonstrates how crime, moral [[Hardline|puritanism]], and conflicts between ruthless capitalists and [[Strike action|striking]] workers help ruin the lives of marginalized Americans. To get more money for his spinster sister's charities, a mill owner orders a 10% pay cut to his workers' wages. An ensuing workers' [[Strike action|strike]] is crushed and The Boy and The Dear One make their way to another city; she lives in poverty and he turns to crime. After they marry, he tries to break free of crime but is framed for theft by his ex-boss. While he is in prison, his wife must endure their child being taken away by the same \"moral uplift society\" that instigated the strike. Upon his release from prison, he discovers his ex-boss attempting to rape his wife. A struggle begins and in the confusion the girlfriend of the boss shoots and kills the boss. She escapes and The Boy is convicted and sentenced to the gallows. A kindly policeman helps The Dear One find the real killer and together they try to reach the Governor in time so her reformed husband will not be hanged.\n\nBreaks between differing time periods are marked by the symbolic image of a mother rocking a [[Cradle (bed)|cradle]], representing the passing of generations. The film simultaneously cross-cuts back and forth and interweaves the segments over great gaps of space and time, with over 50 transitions between the segments.<ref name=filmsite /> One of the unusual characteristics of the film is that many of the characters do not have names. Griffith wished them to be [[emblem]]atic of human types. Thus, the central female character in the modern story is called The Dear One, her young husband is called The Boy, and the leader of the local [[Mafia]] is called The [[Musketeer]] of the [[Slum]]s. Critics and film theorists maintain that these names reveal Griffith's [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]], which was already hinted at in ''The Birth of a Nation'', with names such as The Little Colonel.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n[[File:Intolerance-lillian gish.jpg|thumb|[[Lillian Gish]] as \"Eternal Motherhood\"]]\n\n* [[Lillian Gish]] as The Eternal Motherhood\n'''The American \"Modern\" story'''\n[[File:Intolerance, 1916, il sequestro del bambino.jpg|thumbnail|[[Mae Marsh]] fights against the Uplifters]]\n* [[Mae Marsh]] as The Dear One\n* [[Robert Harron]] as The Boy, a worker at Jenkins Mill\n* [[F.

Anyone concerned with film history has to see ''Intolerance'', and pass on.<ref name=Thomson2008 />}}\n\nThe film has been widely reported to have been a [[box office bomb]], but this is a myth attributed to its misreported budget. Even though up to that time it was the most expensive American film made, and it did far less business than ''The Birth of a Nation'', it earned approximately $1 million for its backers, a respectable performance and enough to recoup its budget.<ref name=Block>{{cite book |editor1-last=Block |editor1-first=Alex Ben |editor2-last=Wilson |editor2-first=Lucy Autrey |year=2010 |title=George Lucas's Blockbusting: A Decade-by-Decade Survey of Timeless Movies Including Untold Secrets of Their Financial and Cultural Success |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-06-177889-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/georgelucassbloc00alex/page/26 26, 44\u201345] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/georgelucassbloc00alex/page/26 }}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n\n''Intolerance'' and its unorthodox editing were enormously influential, particularly among European and [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet filmmakers]].

There are currently four major versions of the film in circulation on home video.\n\n# '''The Killiam Shows Version''' \u2013 Taken from a third-generation [[16 mm film|16 millimeter]] print, this version contains an organ score by [[Gaylord Carter]]. Running approximately 176 minutes, it is the version that has been the most widely seen in recent years. It has been released on [[Laserdisc|LaserDisc]] and DVD by [[Image Entertainment]] and is the most complete version currently available on home video, if not the longest.\n# '''The Official [[Thames Silents]] Restoration''' \u2013 In 1989 this film was given a formal restoration by film preservationists [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[David Gill (film historian)|David Gill]]. This version, also running 177 minutes, was prepared by [[Thames Television]] from original [[35mm movie film|35 millimeter]] material, and its tones and tints were restored per Griffith's original intent. It also has a digitally recorded orchestral score by [[Carl Davis]]. It was released the same year on VHS in the US by HBO Video, then went out of print. This version is part of the [[Raymond Rohauer|Rohauer Collection]]. The Rohauer company worked in association with Thames on the restoration. It was given a further digital restoration by Cohen Media Group (which currently serves as keeper of the Rohauer library, and is the copyright holder on this restored version), and was reissued to select theatres, as well as on DVD and Blu-ray, in 2013. It is distributed under the [[Masters of Cinema]] label in Europe. While not as complete as the Killiam Shows Version, this print contains footage not found on that particular print.\n# '''The Kino Version''' \u2013 Pieced together in 2002 by [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]], this version, taken from 35 millimeter material, is transferred at a slower frame rate than the Killiam Shows and Rohauer prints, resulting in a longer running time of 197 minutes. It contains a synthetic orchestral score by Joseph Turrin. An alternative \"happy ending\" to the \"Fall of Babylon\" sequence, showing the Mountain Girl surviving and re-united with the Rhapsode, is included on the DVD as a supplement. Despite the longer runtime, this version is less complete than the Killiam Shows and Rohauer prints.\n# '''The Restored Digital Cinema Version''' \u2013 Restoration conducted by ZZ Productions in collaboration with the [[Danish Film Institute]] and [[Arte|Arte France]] of the version shown at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London on April 7, 1917. This version runs approximately 177 minutes, and premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on August 29, 2007, and on [[arte]] on October 4, 2007.<ref name=Bienniale />\n\nA further extensive 1989 restoration was a collaboration between silent film composer-conductor Gillian Anderson, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Library of Congress]]. It is somewhat controversial but perhaps the most accurate to date; however, it is unavailable on home video.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/10/02/the-ardous-road-to-intolerance/8113e181-1150-456c-aa8f-f5b3d725e01b/|title=The Arduous Road to Intolerance|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/film-programs/off-screen-further-readings/restoring-original-orchestrations-for-silent-film.html|title=A Crack in the Wall of the Skeptics: Restoring Original Orchestrations for Silent (?) Film|website=National Gallery of Art}}</ref>\n\nThere are other budget/public domain video and DVD versions of this film released by different companies, each with varying degrees of picture quality depending on the source that was used. Most are of poor picture quality, but even the restored 35 millimeter versions exhibit considerable film damage.\n\nThe Internet Movie Database lists the standard running time as 163 minutes, which is the running length of the DVD released by \"Public Domain Flicks\". The Delta DVD released in Region 1 as ''Intolerance: A Sun Play of the Ages'' and in Region 2 as ''Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages'' clocks in at 167 minutes. The version available for free viewing on the Internet Movie Archive is the Killiam restoration.\n\nCameraman [[Karl Brown (cinematographer)|Karl Brown]] remembered a scene with the various members of the Babylonian harem that featured full frontal nudity. He was barred from the set that day, apparently because he was so young. While there are several shots of slaves and harem girls throughout the film (which were shot by another director without Griffith's involvement), the scene that Brown describes is not in any surviving versions.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}\n\nIt is also known that a major segment of the Renaissance \"French\" story, involving the attempted assassination of the [[Admiral Coligny]], was cut before the film's release.{{Citation needed|reason=imdb's trivia section is not a reliable source|date=April 2022}}\n\nFilm historian [[Kevin Brownlow]] has written that, when Griffith re-released \"The Modern Story\" separately as ''The Mother and the Law'' in 1919, he softened {{clarify span|the actions of the National Guard|date=November 2017|reason=Neither the National Guard nor its actions are mentioned anywhere in the article.}} in the film, due to the [[First Red Scare]] that year. \"He was obliged to put this title in the strike sequence: 'The militiamen having used blank cartridges, the workmen now fear only the company guards.{{'\"}} In fact, \"machine guns could not operate with blank cartridges at this period\", Brownlow noted.<ref name=Brownlow1990 />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs= \n<ref name=filmsite>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/into.html |first=Tim |last=Dirks |title=Intolerance (1916) |work=The Best Films of All Time \u2013 A Primer of Cinematic History |access-date=February 4, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=TCMarticle>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=17938&rss=mrqe |title=Intolerance |first=Scott |last=McGee |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=February 13, 2013}}</ref>\n<ref name=NAACP>{{cite web |url=http://www.naacp.org/pages/naacp-history |title=NAACP: 100 Years of History |publisher=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) |access-date=February 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812021721/http://www.naacp.org/pages/naacp-history |archive-date=August 12, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n<ref name=Rapold>{{cite news |last=Rapold |first=Nicholas |title=Birth of Another Spectacle, and Its Life |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 26, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/film-forum-shows-d-w-griffiths-vast-intolerance.html |access-date=February 4, 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=McEwan>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=McEwan |title=The Birth of a Nation (BFI Film Classics) |location=London |publisher=BFI/Palgrave Macmillan |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-84457-657-9 |page=14}}</ref>\n<ref name=Cross2013>{{cite book |editor-last=Cross |editor-first=Mary |title=100 People Who Changed 20th-Century America |chapter=D.W.
