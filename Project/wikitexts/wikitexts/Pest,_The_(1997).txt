Comedian [[John Leguizamo]] plays a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] [[confidence trick|con artist]] in [[Miami, Florida]] named Pestario Rivera Garcia Picante Salsa Vargas (also known as \"Pest\") who agrees to be the human target for a German [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]]er for a US$50,000 reward.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] con artist Pestario \u201cPest\u201d Vargas owes $50,000 U.S. dollars to the Scottish mob, led by Angus, who is eager to exact revenge against Pest so that the Scottish mob will finally be feared. Pest, along with his friends Ninja and Chubby, perform a scam at a festival. While there, Pest promises his girlfriend Xantha Kent he will have dinner with her and her parents.\n\nRacist German hunter Gustav Shank, who desires to hunt the warriors of different nationalities, decides to hunt an athlete. His servant mistakenly believes Shank has decided to hunt Pest and brings Pest to Shank, who decides to hunt Pest anyway due to how irritating he is. Shank tricks Pest into allowing himself to be hunted, but despite the warnings from Shank's weirdly effeminate son Himmel in regards to what he has gotten himself into, Pest decides to participate anyway, since he will get a $50,000 reward if he survives. As Pest is brought to Shank's private island, Pest is supplied with a tiny gun and runs off into the jungle.\n\nPest convinces Himmel to get him off the island, and both escape in Shank's boat. Himmel and Pest are attacked by seagulls, and Pest swims to shore, meeting up with Chubby and Ninja at a pool party. Shank arrives in a helicopter and Pest, Chubby, and Ninja flee. Pest goes to Xantha's house for the dinner, only for a tracking device Shank has attached to him to explode. Shank arrives and goes after Pest, only to inadvertently tranquilize Xantha's father, Himmel, and Ninja.\n\nPest and Chubby hide in a nightclub. Shank once again attacks Pest, only for Pest to cover Shank in a pheromone that results in him being swarmed by horny men. Pest and Chubby reunite with Ninja, only for them to be shoved into a car with Angus, who has been convinced by Shank that Pest is trying to skip town; Angus takes Ninja as collateral to ensure Pest pays his debts. Shank reveals he has kidnapped Pest's family and Xantha and her family, and has them on board a large boat. Pest and Chubby outwit Shank and free the captives. Shank reveals he had poisoned a drink Pest had drunk, and tells Pest how to find his reward to taunt him; Pest collapses, seemingly succumbing to the poison. The next day, Shank discovers his money has been stolen by Pest, who had vomited the poison out due to getting seasick while escaping the island. Pest has also revealed Shank's crimes to the authorities. Shank is dragged away by several police officers, while Pest,\nChubby, Ninja, Himmel, and Xantha drive off with Shank's money.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Pestario 'Pest' Vargas\n* [[Jeffrey Jones]] as Gustav Shank\n* [[Edoardo Ballerini]] as Himmel Shank\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodr\u00edguez]] as Bruce \"Ninja\"\n* [[Tammy Townsend]] as Xantha Kent\n* [[Aries Spears]] as Chubby\n* [[Charles Hallahan]] as Angus\n* [[Tom McCleister]] as Leo\n* [[Joe Morton]] as Mr. Kent\n* [[Ivonne Coll]] as Gladyz\n* [[Pat Skipper]] as Glen Livitt\n\n==Production==\nProduction of the film was announced by TriStar Pictures and The Bubble Factory alongside ''[[Slappy and the Stinkers]]'' as two projects the companies would produce.
