Czerwony}}) is a 1994 [[Romance film|romantic]] [[mystery film]] co-written, produced and directed by [[Poland|Polish]] filmmaker [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]. It is the final installment of the ''[[Three Colours trilogy]]'', which examines the [[Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9|French Revolutionary ideals]]; it is preceded by ''[[Three Colours: Blue|Blue]]'' and ''[[Three Colours: White|White]]''. Kie\u015blowski had announced that this would be his final film,<ref>{{cite news |author=Maslin |first=Janet |date=4 October 1994 |title=After 'Blue' and 'White,' the Rosiness of 'Red' |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/movies/film-festival-review-after-blue-and-white-the-rosiness-of-red.html |access-date=2022-01-15}}</ref> which proved true with the director's sudden death in 1996. ''Red'' is about fraternity, which it examines by showing characters whose lives gradually become closely interconnected, with bonds forming between two characters who appear to have little in common.\n\n''Red'' was released to universal critical acclaim and was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Kie\u015blowski. It was also selected as the Swiss entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[67th Academy Awards]], but was disqualified for not being a majority-Swiss production.<ref name=\"Hitfix\">{{Cite web |last=Lodge |first=Guy |date=September 20, 2012 |title=This year's foreign Oscar race reflects a growingly global medium |url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/this-years-foreign-oscar-race-reflects-a-growingly-global-medium |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002101748/http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/this-years-foreign-oscar-race-reflects-a-growingly-global-medium |archive-date=2 October 2015 |access-date=1 October 2015 |work=[[Hitfix]] }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2022, it is one of only two films to receive perfect ratings on both Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, along with ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nValentine Dussaut is a student at the [[University of Geneva]] and works as a part-time [[Model (person)|model]]. She frequently calls her possessive boyfriend, who is abroad, and plans to meet him in [[London]]. For her modelling job, she poses for a [[chewing-gum]] ad campaign and a photo of her displaying sad emotions is selected.\n\nWhile walking back home, Auguste, a law student neighbour of Valentine's, drops his textbooks and one book falls open at a particular chapter of the Criminal Code, which he notes. After a modeling engagement, while driving back to her apartment, Valentine accidentally hits and injures a Malinois (Belgian shepherd) dog named Rita. She tracks down the owner, a retired judge, Joseph Kern, but he seems unconcerned so Valentine takes Rita to a veterinarian, where she learns that the dog is pregnant. She decides to keep the dog. At the photographer's studio, she selects her preferred picture and overcomes the sexual advances made by the ad company's photographer. Later, money is delivered to her apartment from an unnamed sender.\n\nOut for a walk the next day, Valentine unleashes Rita who runs off, leading Valentine, in her car, back to Kern's house. After confirming that he sent the money for the vet expenses, he says she should keep the dog. As Kern gave her more than the vet's expenses, she gives him back the money. He gives her one of the notes and says he will get some change from the house. Valentine waits outside, but then goes into the house and discovers that Kern is eavesdropping on a male neighbour's sexual telephone conversation with his male lover. She tries to convey to him her concerns about respecting the privacy of his neighbour, but the judge challenges Valentine to reveal the eavesdropping to the neighbour and that it is he. She goes to do so, but is horrified, not only to encounter the man's unsuspecting wife, but also to witness their young daughter listening to the same conversation on the telephone extension. Upon her return to Kern's house, he reveals to her that he is a judge and that his actions of spying or not spying and her actions of telling or not telling make no difference to the eventual outcome of other people's lives. As the conversation goes on, Valentine reveals that her brother was fathered by someone other than her biological father. Before leaving, Valentine also hears a conversation between Auguste, a law student and his girlfriend, Karin, neither of whom she has met and Kern shows her another neighbour whom he suspects is a drug trafficker. Auguste passes his exam to become a judge and credits his success to the dropped textbook.\n\nThat evening, Kern writes a series of letters to his neighbours and the court confessing his spying activities whereupon the community files a [[class action]] lawsuit. Later, at the courts, Kern sees Karin flirting with another man. When Valentine confronts Kern, he says he was prompted to confess by her feeling of disgust towards his spying. They discuss the nature of [[altruism]] when Kern recounts a case in which he mistakenly acquitted a sailor, only to see him live a life free of crime. Valentine asks if he has ever loved or been loved. Kern evades the question and, instead talks about a dream he had the night before in which Valentine was 40 or 50 years old living a very happy life. During their conversation a stone, thrown by a neighbour, breaks the window and Kern has to replace a blown light bulb.\n\nAuguste has been unable to reach Karin by telephone since his graduation so he drives to her flat and climbs up the building. Through the window, he sees her having sex with another man and leaves. He takes his grief out on his dog and, at one stage, after seeing Karin with her new man looking at photos in a cafe, abandons the dog at a lamppost. Kern calls Karin's 'Personal Weather Service' to ask her about the weather for the [[English Channel]], which she predicts will be clear. She is happy about this as she is about to sail there herself soon with her new boyfriend who owns a yacht.\n\nThe day before Valentine leaves for England, she invites Kern to her fashion show. Stormy weather is gathering and Kern seems to sense that Valentine will soon be in danger from it. After the show, the two have coffee at the theatre and their conversation turns again to Kern's doomed love life. His story betrays echoes of Auguste's recent life, including the infidelity and the dropped textbook. He says that the girl he loved died in an accident after he followed her across the English Channel and that his last case as a judge pitted him against his ex-girlfriend's lover. By coincidence, Auguste's first case as a judge is Kern's trial. Kern tells Valentine in more detail about the dream he had about her. In the dream, she is 50 years old and happy and with a man she loves. As they say goodbye, Kern and Valentine plan to meet again in three weeks' time when Kern will give her one of Rita's puppies.\n\nFinally, Valentine boards the [[ferry]] to England. Auguste also boards the ferry, reunited with his dog. As they both search the ferry for their seat locations, Valentine and Auguste come within close proximity of each other when they ask a ferry employee for directions. Kern is tending to the puppies when he learns that a storm has hit the English Channel and both the ferry and the yacht have sunk. Watching the television coverage of the incident, it is revealed only seven survivors are pulled from the ferry - a barman, Julie and Olivier from ''[[Three Colours: Blue|Blue]]'', Karol and Dominique from ''[[Three Colours: White|White]]'', Auguste (without his dog) and finally Valentine. Kern is relieved upon seeing the news and looks out of his broken window. The final image is a television freeze-frame of Valentine during the rescue of ferry passengers, that closely resembles the ad poster, but with real emotion showing on her face.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ir\u00e8ne Jacob]] as Valentine Dussaut\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as Joseph Kern\n* [[Jean-Pierre Lorit]] as Auguste Bruner\n* Frederique Feder as Karin\n* [[Samuel Le Bihan]] as Le photographe (photographer)\n* Marion Stalens as Le v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire (Veterinary surgeon)\n* Teco Celio as Le barman (barman)\n* Bernard Escalon as Le disquaire (record dealer)\n* Jean Schlegel as Le voisin (neighbour)\n* Roland Carey as Le trafiquant (drug dealer)\n\n==Production==\nKieslowski stated that ''Red'' was the most difficult film of the trilogy to write: \"I've got everything I need to put across what I want to say, which is really quite complicated. Therefore, if the idea I've got in mind doesn't come across, it meant that either film is too primitive a medium to support such a construction or that all of us put together haven't got enough talent for it.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Galea |first=Roberto |year=2012 |title=Three Colours Trilogy: Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski |url=http://culture.pl/en/work/three-colours-trilogy-krzysztof-kieslowski |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304184939/https://culture.pl/en/work/three-colours-trilogy-krzysztof-kieslowski |archive-date=March 4, 2014 |access-date=1 May 2017 |website=Culture.pl}}</ref> The main theme of the score, \"Bolero\", was written before any filming took place. According to the filmmakers, it was meant to symbolize events that occur repeatedly in people's lives.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkXmXozBYj4C&pg=PA168|title=Film Music|author1=Mark Russell|author2=James Edward Young|publisher=Focal Press|year=2000|isbn=9780240804415}}</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\nAs in the previous two films, a single color dominates: numerous objects in the film are bright red, including the huge advertising banner featuring Valentine's facial profile. Several images recur throughout the film. Characters are often juxtaposed on different physical levels. The scenes between Valentine and Kern at his house never show the characters on the same level: Valentine either stands above him or sits below him. When Karin searches for Auguste, he hides on a walkway below her. During the climactic scene in the theater, Valentine stands on the stage, towering over Kern who is in the pit below. Telephone communication is important throughout, and so is broken glass (when Kern reveals his eavesdropping, his neighbors throw rocks through his windows, and at the end of the film Kern watches Valentine and Auguste on the news while watching the outside world through broken glass). Also, when Valentine is bowling, the camera moves down the line to where there sits a broken glass next to a packet of Marlboro cigarettes, which is the brand that Auguste smokes.\n\nBiblical references relating to the Gospel of Matthew are also evident. The old man can be pictured as an Old Testament archetype, a God-like figure. Exploring biblical ideas in Red the questions of the judge being a \u2018God\u2019 figure is probably the one that has been explored most often. That he is as an Old Testament God, control over the wind and seas and predicts about people future. This film also depicts topics of the [[Philosophy of Law]] and the manner in which man acts in society, the relationship between the law, ethics and socially acceptable behavior and how not all of them coincide, particularly in the reflections by Judge Kern and some symbols related to Auguste.\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] interpreted the film as an anti-romance, in parallel with ''Blue'' being an anti-tragedy and ''White'' being an anti-comedy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=March 9, 2003 |title=Three Colors Trilogy: Blue, White, Red |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-three-colors-trilogy-blue-white-red |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218124123/https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-three-colors-trilogy-blue-white-red |archive-date=December 18, 2018 |access-date=October 6, 2022 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2017}}\n''Three Colors: Red'' received overwhelmingly positive reviews.

Rotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reads, \"A complex, stirring, and beautifully realized portrait of interconnected lives, ''Red'' is the captivating conclusion to a remarkable trilogy.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1058966-red/ |title=Three Colors: Red (Trois Couleurs: Rouge) (1994) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=1 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nFilm critic Geoff Andrew responded positively in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'': \"While Kie\u015blowski dips into various interconnecting lives, the central drama is the electrifying encounter between Valentine\u2014caring, troubled\u2014and the judge, whose tendency to play God fails to match, initially, the girl's compassion. It's a film about destiny and chance, solitude and communication, cynicism and faith, doubt and desire; about lives affected by forces beyond rationalization. The assured direction avoids woolly mysticism by using material resources\u2014actors, color, movement, composition, sound\u2014to illuminate abstract concepts. Stunningly beautiful, powerfully scored and immaculately performed, the film is virtually flawless, and one of the very greatest cinematic achievements of the last few decades.
