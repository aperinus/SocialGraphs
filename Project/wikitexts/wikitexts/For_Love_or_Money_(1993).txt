Fox]] and [[Gabrielle Anwar]].\n\n==Plot==\nDoug Ireland is a [[concierge]] at the Bradbury, a luxurious hotel in [[New York City]]. Doug is very well-connected and is very good at his job, giving personal attention to guests like Gene Salvatore while occasionally pocketing a big tip. He also helps people who don\u2019t tip as well, such as Harry Wegman. Doug's dream is to open his own hotel on [[Roosevelt Island]]. He has saved every cent and obtained an option on an old hotel.  But he only has a few weeks to begin development and needs at least $3 million immediately to start or the development goes back to the city.\n\nDoug's best chance is Christian Hanover, a somewhat unscrupulous billionaire. Christian considers the proposal and asks Doug to \"take care\" of his mistress, Andy Hart, a perfume saleswoman. Christian has been leading Andy on, making her believe that he was divorcing his wife. Doug had been flirting with Andy before he knew she was seeing Christian, and had asked her out multiple times. However, she always stated that she had a boyfriend. Doug spends time with Andy when Christian neglects her, (as a \u201cfavor\u201d for Christian) and he saves Andy and Christian from an embarrassing scene at a party in Christian's house with his wife, Elenor.\n\nDoug learns that Christian is deceiving Andy about getting a divorce, stating, \u201cyou don\u2019t divorce your third wife\u201d. But because his hotel proposal is urgent and Andy is old enough to make her own decisions, he doesn't intervene. However, as he and Andy spend time together, he develops feelings for her, going to an elegant restaurant with her after Christian is late due to a date with his wife. He simultaneously helps Wegman with his failing marriage, helping him get his wife to love him again.\n\nAndy learns that a document Christian has asked Doug to sign was intended to permit the billionaire to take over the hotel project and force Doug out. Christian reveals that an IRS agent who was tailing Doug about the real estate property he (Doug) bought until he (Christian) and his lawyers took care of it was actually working with Christian to get the property. Christian smugly tells Andy that the project was going to make a fortune and he wasn't going to share it with a mere concierge. Andy abandons him to warn Doug, who is chasing after her to tell her Christian isn\u2019t divorcing his wife.  After the two reunite at the Queensboro Bridge and reveal to each other about the deception, Doug says he never signed the document due to leaving to warn Andy, so Christian can't take over the property.\n\nIn the end, after Doug and Andy marry, he gets a call from Wegman, who despite his frugalness is a successful financier, has accidentally been sent Doug's business plan by a senile member of the hotel staff Doug refused to fire and has decided to put up the $3 million that Doug needs.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Michael J.
