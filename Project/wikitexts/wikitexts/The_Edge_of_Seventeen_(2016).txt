Nadine falls asleep while Krista talks to Darian. The next morning Nadine finds Krista giving Darian a handjob, straining their friendship. The next day at school Darian asks Krista to be his girlfriend. Nadine turns to her classmate Erwin Kim, who has a crush on her, though she is attracted to older student Nick Mossman.\n\nKrista insists Nadine join her at a house party to which Darian has invited her. Krista is introduced to other students, leaving Nadine on her own. After failed attempts at mingling, Nadine sits outside with another partygoer, who remarks how inferior Nadine seems compared to her brother, and Nadine leaves the party. She invites Erwin to an amusement park, where she rejects his attempt to kiss her. At the end of the night Nadine tells him he is a great guy and they become close friends.\n\nAt school, Krista confronts Nadine for ignoring her, and Nadine says Darian does not care about Krista and will soon drop her. Krista retorts that Darian has asked her to prom, which is months away. She rejects Nadine's demand that she choose between herself and Darian, and Nadine ends their friendship.\n\nFor support at school, Nadine turns to Mr Bruner who says she is his favorite student. Nadine goes swimming in Erwin's pool and finds his house is luxurious and his family wealthy. She learns Erwin is a talented animation filmmaker, and accepts his invitation to their school's short-film festival.\n\nDriving to school, Mona and Nadine have a fight that leads to Mona bringing Nadine with her to work. They argue about her father, and Nadine steals Mona's car. She writes a sexually explicit text to Nick and accidentally sends it.\n\nNadine flippantly tells Mr. Bruner she is going to kill herself, and he tries to reassure her. Nick replies asking her to hang out. Mona calls Darian, telling him that Nadine is missing and Darian leaves to find her. Nick, having believed Nadine's explicit text, repeatedly attempts to have sex with her in his car. Pushing him off, Nadine runs away and calls Mr. Bruner, who drives her to his house where they wait for Darian to arrive. Darian tells Nadine he has suffered from the pressures of taking their father\u2019s place, saying he feels trapped and did not apply to distant colleges because the only person who makes him happy is Krista. Nadine confesses her own feelings of self-hatred and envy of Darian. They hug, ending their feud.\n\nAs Nadine leaves for the film festival, she meets Darian and Krista; the friends reconcile and agree to catch up later. Realizing that Mona is still worried she has run away, Nadine texts her that she is safe, and Mona decides to trust her word. Erwin's animated film is about an alien boy who falls in love with a girl at high school but is rejected. The girl resembles Nadine and wears sneakers similar to hers. After the film, Nadine hands Erwin flowers she picked for him and apologizes for taking so long to accept his affection. Erwin is congratulated by his colleagues and introduces Nadine, who greets them with a smile.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Hailee Steinfeld]] as Nadine Franklin,<ref name=\"Aug2015THR\" /> Darian's younger sister, and Mona and Tom's daughter.
