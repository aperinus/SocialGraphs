Shot almost entirely in black and white, the film follows two journeys made thirty years apart by the indigenous shaman Karamakate in the Colombian [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian jungle]], one with Theo, a German ethnographer, and the other with Evan, an American botanist, both of whom are searching for the rare plant ''yakruna''. It was inspired by the travel diaries of [[Theodor Koch-Gr\u00fcnberg]] and [[Richard Evans Schultes]], and dedicated to lost Amazonian cultures.\n\n''Embrace of the Serpent'' was premiered on 15 May 2015 during the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the Art Cinema Award. The film was released in Colombia on 21 May 2015, and worldwide over the course of the following twelve months. It has received universal acclaim from critics, who praised the cinematography and the story's theme, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and way of life by white colonialism. It has won numerous awards, including the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] at the 2016 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the Grand Jury Prize for Best Picture at the 2017 [[Riviera International Film Festival]], and seven awards at the [[3rd Platino Awards]] to recognise the best Ibero-American films of 2015, including the [[Platino Award for Best Ibero-American Film]]. In 2016 the film was submitted as Colombia's entry for the category of [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[88th Academy Awards]] and was included among the final five nominees, becoming the first Colombian film ever to receive a nomination for an Academy Award.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film tells two stories thirty years apart, both featuring Karamakate, an Amazonian [[shaman]] and last survivor of his tribe. He travels with two scientists, firstly with the German Theo von Martius in 1909 and then with an American named Evan in 1940, to look for the rare ''yakruna'', a (fictional) sacred plant.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jordan |last=Hoffman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/17/embrace-of-the-serpent-review-ciro-guerra-colombian-amazon |title=Embrace of the Serpent review \u2013 dreamlike exploration of the Amazon's imperialist pollution |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 February 2016 |access-date=22 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nTheo, an ethnographer from [[T\u00fcbingen]] who has already been residing in the Amazon for several years, is very sick and is travelling by canoe with his field notes and a westernised local named Manduca whom he had saved from enslavement on a rubber plantation. Karamakate prolongs his life, blasting white powder called \"the sun's semen\" (possibly a hallucinogenic made from [[virola]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Christina |last=Pratt |title=An Encyclopedia of Shamanism \u2013 Volume 2: N\u2013Z |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing|Rosen Publishing Group]] |page=423 |date=1 June 2007 |isbn=978-1-40421-141-4}}</ref>) up his nose, but is reluctant to become involved with a westerner and refuses his money. Theo is searching for yakruna as the only cure for his disease and the three set off in the canoe to search for it.\n\nMany years later an American botanist, Evan, paddles up to a much older Karamakate who has apparently forgotten the customs of his own people. Evan says he is hoping to complete Theo's quest and Karamakate does assist, again reluctantly, saying his knowledge is spent. Evan has a book of Theo's final trek, which his aide had sent back to Europe, as he did not survive the jungle. The book includes an image of Karamakate, which he refers to as his [[chullachaqui]], a native term for hollow spirit. Karamakate agrees to help him only when Evan describes himself as someone who has devoted himself to plants, although Evan's real purpose is actually to secure disease-free [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]]s, since the United States' supplies of rubber from South East Asia had dwindled due to the Japanese wartime advance.\n\nBoth expeditions feature a Spanish Catholic Mission by the side of an Amazon tributary, run in 1909 by a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]], lone Spanish priest who beats orphan boys for any \"pagan\" behaviour, and in 1940 by a delusional [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] figure [[Messiah complex|who believes he is the Messiah]]. He only trusts the visitors when he believes they are the [[Biblical Magi]], but Karamakate wins his respect when he heals his wife. By now the children of 1909 have grown into disturbed and violent acolytes.\n\nIn 1909, we are left with Theo, sick and having fled the Mission, arriving at a frontier post just about to be invaded by Colombian soldiers during the [[Amazon rubber boom]], where the sacred yakruna is being abused by drunken men, and cultivated, against local traditions. Karamakate is furious and destroys it. In 1940, Karamakate does show Evan the origin of the plant in striking denuded dome-shaped mountains ([[Cerros de Mavecure]]), allegedly the home of yakruna. He reveals one yakruna flower that is on the last plant \u2013 he has destroyed all the others \u2013 and prepares it for Evan. The preparation, being hallucinogenic, aids Evan in undergoing a superconscious experience. While most of the film is in black-and-white, a part of this experience is shown in colour to signify its intensity. The film ends with a transformed Evan remaining enamoured by a group of butterflies.\n\n== Cast ==\nIn ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' magazine, the film's writer and director [[Ciro Guerra]] noted how the process of finding an actor who can successfully communicate the film's narrative was considered to be a difficult task. After his attempt in reaching out to a variety of indigenous people, it had come to his attention that the older generation were completely detached from the time depicted within the film. Through watching a film over 10 years ago in a workshop with Colombia's [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Ministry of Culture]], Guerra was able to find the perfect actor, Antonio Bol\u00edvar. Bol\u00edvar's two minute presence in the short film had a great impact on Guerra, encouraging him to pursue appointing him the role of Karamakate as \"There was nobody else that could play this guy. He's one of the last Ocaina people remaining. There's only about sixteen of them left.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Guill\u00e9n |url=https://www.cineaste.com/spring2016/embrace-of-the-serpent-ciro-guerra |title=Embrace of the Serpent: An Interview with Ciro Guerra |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |volume=41 |number=2 |date=Spring 2016 |access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe cast are as follows:\n\n*Nilbio Torres as Young Karamakate\n*Antonio Bol\u00edvar as Old Karamakate\n*{{ill|Jan Bijvoet|nl}} as Theo\n*[[Brionne Davis]] as Evan\n*Luigi Sciamanna as Gaspar\n*Yauenk\u00fc Migue as Manduca\n*Nicol\u00e1s Cancino as Anizetto\n\n== Themes ==\nThe film explores the representation of the first people nations of the Amazon.

The director extensively collaborated with the community and invited them to participate and collaborate both in front and behind the camera. To avoid any problems caused by the harsh environment, the indigenous people taught the crew how to work with the jungle and performed rituals for spiritual protection. There were no accidents or illnesses and the shooting ran smoothly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wd7k74/embrace-of-the-serpent-is-a-violent-psychedelic-film-about-the-colonization-of-the-amazon|title='Embrace of the Serpent' Is a Violent, Psychedelic, Film About the Colonisation of the Amazon|last=Salas|first=Camilo|date=8 January 2016|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref> Additionally, to improve accuracy, indigenous individuals worked with Guerra to translate and rewrite parts of the script.<ref name=\"Alphaville\">{{cite journal |last=Berghahn |first=Daniela |title=Encounters with Cultural Difference: Cosmopolitanism and Exoticism in ''Tanna'' (Martin Butler and Bentley Dean, 2015) and ''Embrace of the Serpent'' (Ciro Guerra, 2015) |url=http://www.alphavillejournal.com/Issue14/ArticleBerghahn.pdf |journal=Alphaville: Journal of Film and Screen Media |number=14 |pages=16\u201340 |date=Winter 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cerros de Mavecure (Guain\u00eda, Colombia).JPG|thumb|Cerro Mono and Cerro Pajarito, in the [[Cerros de Mavecure|Mavicure Hills]], which feature in the film.]]\n''Embrace of the Serpent'' was filmed in the [[Amazon natural region|Amazon\u00eda region]] of Colombia.
