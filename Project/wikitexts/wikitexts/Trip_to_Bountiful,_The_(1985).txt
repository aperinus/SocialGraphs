Although part of the film is set in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] (as was the original play), the movie was shot in [[Dallas]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film, set in the post-World War II 1940s, tells the story of an elderly woman, Carrie Watts (Page), who wants to return to her home, the small, rural, agriculture-based town of Bountiful near the Texas Gulf coast between Houston and Corpus Christi, where she grew up, but she's frequently stopped from leaving Houston by her daughter-in-law and her overprotective son (Heard), who will not let her travel alone.  Her son and daughter-in-law both know that the town has long since  disappeared, due to the Depression. Long-term out-migration was caused by the draw-down of all the town's able-bodied men to the wartime draft calls and by the demand for industrial workers in the war production plants of the big cities.\n\nOld Mrs. Watts is determined to outwit her son and bossy daughter-in-law, and sets out to catch a train, only to find that trains do not go to Bountiful anymore. She eventually boards a bus to a town near her childhood home. On the journey, she befriends a woman traveling alone (DeMornay) and reminisces about her younger years and grieves for her lost relatives.  Her son and daughter-in-law eventually track her down, with the help of the local police force; however, Mrs. Watts is determined. The local sheriff, moved by her yearning to visit her girlhood home, offers to drive her out to what remains of Bountiful. The town is deserted and the few remaining structures are derelict. Mrs. Watts learns that the last occupant of the town and the woman with whom she had hoped to live, has recently died. She is moved to tears as she surveys her father's land and the remains of the family home. Having accepted the reality of the current condition of Bountiful and knowing that she has reached her goal of returning there before dying, she is ready to return to Houston when her son and daughter-in-law arrive to drive her back.  Having confronted their common history in Bountiful, the three commit to live more peacefully together. They begin their drive back to Houston.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Geraldine Page]] as Mrs. Watts\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Ludie Watts\n* [[Carlin Glynn]] as Jessie Mae\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Sheriff\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Thelma\n* [[Kevin Cooney]] as Roy\n* Norman Bennett as First Bus Ticket Man\n* Harvey Lewis as Second Bus Ticket Man\n* Kirk Sisco as Train Ticket Agent\n* Dave Tanner as Billy Davis\n* Gil Glasgow as Stationmaster, Gerard\n* [[Betty Lou Gerson]] as Rosella\n* Wezz Tildon as Bus Passenger\n* Peggy Ann Byers as Downstairs Neighbor\n* David Romo as Mexican Man\n* Tony Torn as Twin\n* John Torn  as Twin\n* Alexandra Masterson as Drugstore Waitress\n* Don Wyse as Doctor\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Trip to Bountiful'' received a very positive response from film critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a score of 100% from 10 reviews. Geraldine Page received particular praise for her performance as Mrs. Watts.  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"a superbly crafted drama featuring the performance of a lifetime by Geraldine Page.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Review: 'The Trip to Bountiful' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 31, 1984 |url=https://variety.com/1984/film/reviews/the-trip-to-bountiful-1200426398/ |access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref>  [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a \"funny, exquisitely performed film adaptation of [Foote's] own play\" and wrote of Page, \"Her Mrs. Watts is simultaneously hilarious and crafty, sentimental and unexpectedly tough.\"  He added, \"It's a wonderful role, and the performance ranks with the best things Miss Page has done on the screen.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Canby |first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |title=Film: Geraldine Page in 'A Trip to Bountiful' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 20, 1985 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D04E3D7153BF933A15751C1A963948260 |access-date=August 7, 2017}}</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' similarly observed that \"Page inhabits the central role with authority and vinegar,\" writing, \"She's not just a sweet and gentle little old lady.

But the test of acting always is that you forget this, surrendering to the certainty that you have been transported back to 1947 and that dark apartment, and are then riding the bus toward Bountiful in the company of this warm and loving old woman.  The film gives us an unforgettable portrayal.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Champlin |first=Charles |author-link=Charles Champlin |title=Page Gives A 'Bountiful' Performance |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 4, 1986 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-04/entertainment/ca-24383_1_carrie-watts |access-date=August 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nVincent Canby later included ''The Trip to Bountiful'' in his list of the top ten films of 1985.<ref>{{cite web |last=Canby |first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |title=Film View;
