The film stars [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[Bruce Payne]], with Snipes portraying a security consultant who finds himself forced to foil a plot to free a captive terrorist during a commercial airline flight. Critical reviews were mixed, but the film was a box-office success, and made Snipes a popular [[List of action heroes|action hero]] icon. It also introduced Snipes's famous line: \"Always bet on black.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_14934_the-wisdom-wesley-snipes-7-quotes-to-live-by.html |title=The Wisdom of Wesley Snipes: 7 Quotes to Live By |publisher=[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]] |date=2007-09-23 |access-date=2013-08-26}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBritish international [[Terrorism|terrorist]] Charles Rane, whose career has been dubbed as \"The Rane of Terror\" by the media, is arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and local authorities in Miami, just as he is about to undergo plastic surgery in order to evade law enforcement. The FBI make plans to return Rane to [[Los Angeles]] for him to stand trial.\n\nWidowed and reputed police officer, decorated soldier, and retired [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] agent John Cutter is constantly haunted by the memories of his wife's death in a convenience store robbery and has launched a course specializing in training flight attendants in self-defense. After one class, Cutter is approached by an old friend, Sly Delvecchio, who offers Cutter the vice presidency of a new antiterrorism unit for his company, Atlantic International Airlines. Cutter is reluctant, but Delvecchio and the company's president, Stuart Ramsey, eventually convince him to accept the offer.\n\nCutter boards as the 57th passenger on an Atlantic International flight to Los Angeles (a [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]]), where one of his students, Marti Slayton, is one of the flight attendants. Rane and his two FBI escorts are also aboard. After the flight takes off, several henchpersons in Rane's employ, posing as flight attendants and passengers, kill the FBI agents, release Rane, and secure the plane by also killing the captain. Cutter, in the lavatory at the time, manages to use the plane's on-board phone to warn Delvecchio of the situation, but Cutter is soon caught by one of Rane's henchmen.\n\nCutter overpowers the henchman and takes his weapon; he then uses the agent (in a chokehold) as a shield to confront Rane, but an indifferent Rane shows his ruthlessness by mercilessly murdering a passenger in cold blood. Cutter realizes he is outmatched and escapes with Marti to the cargo hold, while Rane kills the henchman that Cutter overpowered, ranting his \"incompetence\". Cutter dispatches another of Rane's men, Vincent, who is disguised as a caterer. Cutter trips circuitry to dump the plane's fuel, forcing Rane to order the surviving pilots to land at a small [[Louisiana]] airfield. As Cutter and Marti prepare to escape upon touchdown, Marti is caught by Forget and he kicks Cutter out of the plane. The local sheriff, Leonard Biggs and his deputies arrest Cutter, thinking he is a terrorist, and takes him to the airport building.\n\nRane contacts the field's tower and demands refueling, for which he promises half the passengers will be freed. For every five minutes of resistance or indecision, Rane will order five passengers to be executed. Rane also falsely asserts that Cutter is one of his own men turned against him. Biggs gives the go-ahead for refueling, and as the passengers are freed, Rane and some of his men escape from the plane. Cutter recognizes the passenger release as a diversion, escapes from the sheriff, and chases Rane and his men into a local county [[fair]]. FBI agents arrive and confirm Cutter's true identity to Biggs. Cutter is able to kill one of Rane's men and gets into a fight with Rane before police arrive and capture him.\n\nBack at the tower, Rane announces that if he does not contact the plane and give flight clearance, his men aboard have been instructed to kill the rest of the hostages. The FBI agents arrange to return Rane to the plane, escorted by two agents, with plans to have a sniper take down Rane and allow them to storm the plane to save the hostages. However, the sniper is Vincent, who kills the escorts, but is shot dead by Cutter, and Rane makes it inside safely. Rane orders the pilots to take off, while Cutter, with Biggs' help, manages to jump from a car onto the speeding plane (through the nose landing gear) before it takes off.\n\nInside, Cutter deals with more of Rane's accomplices before getting into a fight with Rane. A bullet blows one of the plane's windows causing explosive decompression, and a door blows out. Cutter manages to get Rane close to the open door and kicks him out of the plane, which sends Rane, screaming in terror, out into the night sky where he falls {{convert|35,000|ft|km}} to his death. The plane quickly returns to the airfield, where the FBI agents secure Sabrina Ritchie, Rane's only remaining agent, and the remaining hostages are freed. Amid congratulations and celebration, Marti and Cutter make their quiet escape into the distance hand-in-hand, but not before Chief Biggs offers them a ride.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Chief John Cutter, a veteran law enforcement official turned airline security expert haunted by the death of his wife.\n* [[Bruce Payne]] as Charles Rane, a sadistic international terrorist mastermind who hijacked the jet to escape custody.\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as Sly Delvecchio, Cutter's old friend who offers him a high-ranking job.\n* Alex Datcher as Marti Slayton, a flight attendant on board the jet.\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Stuart Ramsey, the president of Atlantic International Airlines.\n* [[Robert Hooks]] as Dwight Henderson, an FBI agent.\n* [[Elizabeth Hurley]] as Sabrina Ritchie, Rane's second-in-command and sole henchwoman disguised as a flight attendant.\n* [[Michael Horse]] as Forget, Rane's henchman.\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Vincent, Rane's henchman.\n* [[Ernie Lively]] as Chief Leonard Biggs, the local sheriff.\n* Duchess Tomasello as Mrs. Edwards\n* William Edward Roberts as Matthew, Rane's henchman.\n* James Short as Allen\n* Gary Rorman as Douglas\n* Joel Fogel as Dr. Bauman\n* Jane McPherson as Nurse\n* [[Brett Rice]] as a Cop\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film was based on a script by [[Stewart Raffill]].
