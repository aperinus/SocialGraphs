It follows the story of Henry, a womanizing marine veterinarian who falls for an art teacher named Lucy. When he discovers she has amnesia, and forgets him when she falls asleep, he resolves to win her over again each new day.\n\nMost of the film was shot on location in [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]], on the Windward side and the North Shore. Sandler and Barrymore won an [[MTV]] award for Best On Screen Team. The fictitious memory impairment suffered by Barrymore's character, \"Goldfield's Syndrome\", is similar to short-term memory loss and [[anterograde amnesia]].\n\nThe film was remade in Indian Telugu as ''[[Sathyabhama (2007 film)|Sathyabhama]]'' (2007),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movies.fullhyderabad.com/satyabhama/telugu/satyabhama-movie-reviews-2078-2.html |title=Satyabhama Review |website=fullhyd.com |year=2007 |access-date=September 20, 2021 }}</ref> in Indian Malayalam as ''[[Ormayundo Ee Mukham]]'' (2014),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmibeat.com/malayalam/news/2017/before-oru-cinemaakkaran-box-office-analysis-vineeth-sreenivasan-s-previous-5-movies-263871.html |title=Before Oru Cinemaakkaran: Box Office Analysis Of Vineeth Sreenivasan's Previous 5 Movies! |date=June 23, 2017 |website=Filmibeat |author=Abhijith |access-date=September 21, 2021 }}</ref> in Japan as ''50 First Kisses'' (2018),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/japanese-remake-50-first-kisses-sticks-too-closely-to-50-first-dates |title=Japanese remake 50 First Kisses sticks too closely to 50 First Dates |date=July 25, 2018 |newspaper=The Straits Times |author=Yip Wai Yee |access-date=September 20, 2021 }}</ref> in Iran as [[:fa:\u0686\u067e\u200c\u062f\u0633\u062a (\u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0645 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f4)|Chap dast]] (2005) and in Mexico as ''[[Como si fuera la primera vez]]'' in 2019.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.glamour.mx/celebrities/estilo-celeb/articulos/deberias-ver-el-remake-de-como-si-fuera-la-primera-vez-te-decimos-nuestro-veredicto/13509 |title=\u00bfDeber\u00edas ver el remake de 'Como si fuera la primera vez? \u00a1Te decimos nuestro veredicto! |date=September 4, 2019 |magazine=Glamour (Mexico) |first=Elsa |last=L\u00f3pez |access-date=September 20, 2021 |language=es }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nHenry Roth is a [[veterinarian]] at [[Sea Life Park]] on [[Oahu]]. His closest friends are Ula, a [[marijuana]]-smoking [[Pacific Islander|Islander]]; Alexa, his [[Androgyny|androgynous]] assistant; Willy, his pet [[African penguin]]; and Jocko, a [[walrus]].\n\nHenry's boat breaks down, so he goes to the Hukilau Caf\u00e9 to wait for the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]. He sees Lucy Whitmore make architectural art with her [[waffles]]. Henry assumes she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself, but the next day he comes back and has breakfast with her. Lucy asks to see him again the next morning.\n\nThe next day, Lucy shows no recollection of ever meeting him. The restaurant owner Sue explains to Henry that the year before, Lucy and her father Marlin went up to the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] to pick a [[pineapple]] for his birthday. On the way back, a car accident left Lucy with [[Amnesia|anterograde amnesia]]. To save her the heartbreak of reliving the accident, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's [[lisp]]ing [[steroid]]-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday.\n\nDespite Sue's warning, Henry tries to get Lucy to have breakfast with him again. It ends poorly when Henry unintentionally hurts Lucy's feelings. At her house, Marlin and Doug instruct Henry to leave Lucy alone. Henry begins concocting ways to run into Lucy through the following days, during which he manages to successfully impress her over a series of \"first\" dates and [[Meet cute|\"chance\" encounters]]. Later, Marlin and Doug give their permission for Henry to continue when they discover Lucy regularly singing [[the Beach Boys]]' \"[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]\" in her painting studio \u2013 the first major change in her routine since the accident.\n\nOne day, as Henry is about to sit with Lucy at breakfast, she notices a police officer writing a [[Parking violation|ticket]] because of her expired [[Vehicle registration plates|plates]]. With the ruse exposed, Lucy is distressed to learn that her friends and family have maintained the charade for so long; however, in watching her reaction, Henry surmises that her strongest reactions are to feeling betrayed by her loved ones, not the actual memory loss.\n\nHenry devises a new strategy to let Lucy know about the truth by creating a video with her friends to explain the situation calmly; rather than let her go through her pre-accident routine, they plant the video in her room with a note to play it when she first wakes up. The strategy works and allows Lucy to process the events while catching her up on current events, including her relationship to Henry. Henry and Lucy's relationship grows well using this method, and they continue to refine the process while enduring some humorous setbacks such as their sleeping together and Lucy attacking Henry the next morning. However, when Lucy discovers that Henry has decided to cancel ten years' worth of planning for his research study of walruses in [[Bristol Bay]] to help manage her condition, she decides that they need to break up. Henry reluctantly helps her destroy her journal entries of their relationship and effectively \"erase\" their time together.\n\nSome weeks later, Henry is preparing to leave for his research study. Before he goes, Marlin tells him that Lucy is now living at the institute and teaching an art class.  As a parting gift, he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD which reminds him of Lucy. He soon realizes that Lucy's singing of \"[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]\" was not random, but occurred on days when they met together and indicates new [[memory consolidation|learned memory retention]]. Henry abandons his trip and travels to the art class. While Lucy does not remember him, she reveals that she dreams about him every night and has been painting some of their adventures. They happily reconcile.\n\nSome time later, Lucy wakes up and plays the tape marked \"Good Morning Lucy\". It again reminds her of her accident, but ends with her and Henry's wedding. From the tape, Henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready. Lucy then sees that she is on Henry's boat, which finally made it to [[Alaska]]. She goes up on deck and meets Marlin, Henry and their young daughter, Nicole.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Adam Sandler]] as Henry Roth, a marine veterinarian with a habit of wooing women and a [[fear of commitment]].\n*[[Drew Barrymore]] as Lucy Whitmore, Henry's love interest with [[Amnesia|short-term memory loss]]. \n*[[Rob Schneider]] as Ula, Henry's [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]-smoking, wealthy native Hawaiian assistant and best friend; who is unhappily married to an overweight native woman and has five young, athletically talented children.\n*[[Sean Astin]] as Doug Whitmore, Lucy's older brother, a lisping, steroid-dependent bodybuilder.\n*[[Blake Clark]] as Marlin Whitmore, Lucy's widowed father, a professional fisherman.\n*[[Lusia Strus]] as Alexa, Henry's ambiguously gendered assistant.\n*[[Dan Aykroyd]] as Dr. Joseph Keats, a [[physician]] specializing in brain disorders.\n*[[Amy Hill]] as Sue, the Hukilau caf\u00e9 manager and friend of Lucy and her late mother.\n*Pomaika'i Brown as Nick, the Hukilau caf\u00e9 chef.\n*[[Allen Covert]] as Ten-Second Tom, a hospital patient with severe memory impairment.\n*[[Missi Pyle]] as Noreen, a tax attorney Henry meets at a bar but then tries to fix up with Alexa.\n*[[Maya Rudolph]] as Stacy, pregnant friend of Lucy's at the beach party.\n*[[Lynn Collins]] as Linda\n*[[Kevin James]] as Factory worker\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | align  = right\n   | footer = ''50 First Dates'' is the second film in which Sandler and Barrymore, both pictured in 2014, appear together.

She described her memory as being normal for events on the same day, with memories from the previous day subsequently being lost each night. However, a [[neuropsychological test]] revealed some improvement in recall for tasks which she had, unknowingly, performed the previous day. Although the woman claimed not to have seen ''50 First Dates'' prior to her 2005 crash (but has watched it several times since), she stated that Drew Barrymore was her favorite actress, leading researchers to conclude that her condition might have been influenced by some knowledge of the film's plot, and its impact upon her understanding of amnesia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Christine N.
