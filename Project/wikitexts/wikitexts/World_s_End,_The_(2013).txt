It is the third and final installment in the [[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy|''Three Flavours Cornetto'' trilogy]], after ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004) and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007). It stars Pegg, [[Nick Frost]], [[Paddy Considine]], [[Martin Freeman]], [[Eddie Marsan]], [[Rosamund Pike]], and [[Pierce Brosnan]]. In the film, five friends return to their hometown to reattempt a [[pub crawl]] they failed twenty-three years earlier, only to discover the town is in the midst of an [[alien invasion]].\n\nThe film entered initial development in 1995 after Wright wrote a screenplay titled ''Crawl'' about teenagers on a pub crawl; after deciding it was better suited as a comedic exploration of young adulthood and [[aging]], he reworked the screenplay with Pegg in the early 2010s. The film was produced by [[Relativity Media]], [[StudioCanal]], [[Big Talk Productions]], and [[Working Title Films]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigtalkproductions.com/the-worlds-end/ |title=''The World's End'' |publisher=Big Talk Productions |date=22 February 1999 |access-date=22 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510012910/http://www.bigtalkproductions.com/the-worlds-end/ |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began on 28 September 2012 and lasted until that December, with filming locations including [[Elstree Studios]], [[Letchworth Garden City]], and [[Welwyn Garden City]].

It was later released in the United States by [[Focus Features]] on 23 August. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the screenplay, performances of the cast, humour, and Wright's direction. It won [[Empire Award for Best British Film|Best British Film]] at the [[19th Empire Awards]], and was nominated for Best Comedy at the [[19th Critics' Choice Awards]]. ''The World's End'' was also a commercial success, grossing $46.1 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nGary King, an immature 40-year-old [[alcoholic]], decides to recapture his youth by contacting his boyhood friends Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page, Steven Prince, and Andrew Knightley and inviting them to complete the Golden Mile, a [[pub crawl]] encompassing the 12 pubs of their hometown of Newton Haven, the last of them being the World's End. The group attempted the crawl as teens in 1990, but failed to reach the final three pubs. Andy, now a [[teetotaller]] due to a [[drunk driving]] accident years before involving himself and Gary, reluctantly agrees to join after Gary lies about his mother dying.\n\nThe group encounters Oliver's sister, Sam, over whom Gary and Steven fought in school; during the teenage crawl, Gary had sex with Sam in a pub bathroom. The town residents do not recognize the group, except for one bartender who tells them that they are banned. After Peter encounters Shane Hawkins, his childhood bully who does not seem to remember him, Gary interrupts Peter's account of his bullying after going off to buy a round of shots. Angry and upset at the group after they admonish him for his childishness, Gary goes to the toilet, where he gets into a fight with a teenager and knocks his head off, exposing him as an [[Android (robot)|android]]. As Gary's friends find him in the bathroom, the other members of the teen's gang, all androids, enter the bathroom and engage in a battle against the human friends. The group realizes that most of the town has been replaced with androids (which they dub \"Blanks\"), explaining why no one remembers them. Shocked and overwhelmed, Andy starts drinking again.\n\nGary urges them to continue the pub crawl to avoid suspicion. The group bumps into Sam once more. Sam, Gary, and Steven fight Blank versions of Sam's childhood friends, known as the \"twins\". Sam tags along with them, and Steven is told by Basil, another resident known as a eccentric conspiracy theorist who has not yet been replaced by a Blank, that the Blanks are trying to build a galactic conglomerate and that any humans refusing will be replaced with identical simulants. Sam realises this independently after witnessing someone who she knew died in a motorcycle accident eight years earlier. The Blanks attempt to convince the humans to join their assimilation. Unwilling to lose their humanity and, finding out that both Oliver and their old school teacher, Mr. Sheperd, have been replaced, the group fights a bar full of Blanks. The surviving members of the group realise, after noticing that Oliver's surgically-removed \"6\"-shaped birth mark had returned, that Blanks cannot replicate scarification, prompting them all, except Gary, to show each other their childhood scars (all of which were in some way caused by Gary).\n\nGary lets Sam escape Newton Haven by herself; Pete gets captured after attacking Shane's Blank; and when Andy and Steven want to go home, Gary ditches them to finish the Golden Mile alone. Andy and Steven chase after Gary, as does the rest of Newton Haven, and Steven is captured. Andy confronts Gary and reveals that his marriage is troubled, while Gary reveals his recent suicide attempt. Andy tries to stop Gary from drawing his final pint, but Gary is determined to complete the Mile.\n\nWhen Gary pulls the lever to pour himself a pint, the floor lowers into a hidden chamber. A disembodied alien entity, the Network, tells Gary and Andy that the Blank invasion is the first step to humanity joining a galactic community. The Network offers Gary eternal youth if he becomes a Blank, but he refuses and decapitates his Blank self. Along with Andy and Steven, who has survived, Gary demands that humanity be left to its own devices, stating that all but three of Newton Haven residents have been replaced with Blanks, and expressing horror at how humans that have been replaced have been [[compost]]ed. The Network, exasperated, agrees to abandon the invasion. Sam rescues Gary, Andy, and Steven as the town is destroyed, but they are unable to outrun the [[electromagnetic pulse]] triggered by the departure of the Network, which deactivates Sam's car.\n\nSome time later, Andy relates to other survivors of the pulse that it triggered a worldwide blackout that destroyed all electrical power on Earth, sending humanity back to the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] and killing an unknown number of humans in the process. The remaining Blanks reactivated a few weeks later and, although they are now independent from the Network, they are mistrusted and shunned by most of the surviving humans. Andy's marriage has recovered, Steven is in a relationship with Sam, and the Blank versions of Peter and Oliver have picked up where their human versions left off. Andy relates that he has no idea what happened to Gary.\n\nIn the ruins of Newton Haven, the now-sober Gary enters a pub with the Blank versions of his younger friends and orders water. When the bartender refuses to serve Blanks, Gary leads his friends into a brawl.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Simon Pegg]] as Gary King, an immature alcoholic who brings his childhood friends back together to recreate their youth.\n**[[Thomas Law]] as Young Gary\n*[[Nick Frost]] as Andy Knightley, one of Gary's childhood friends who grew up to be a teetotaling corporate lawyer.\n**Zachary Bailess as Young Andy\n*[[Paddy Considine]] as Steven Prince, one of Gary's childhood friends who grew up to be an architect\n**Jasper Levine as Young Steven\n*[[Martin Freeman]] as Oliver \"O-Man\" Chamberlain, one of Gary's childhood friends who grew up to be an estate agent.
