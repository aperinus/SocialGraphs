[[Angelina Jolie]] stars as the titular character [[Lara Croft]] with supporting performances from [[Gerard Butler]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], [[Chris Barrie]], [[Noah Taylor]], [[Til Schweiger]], [[Djimon Hounsou]] and [[Simon Yam]]. An international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, the film is a [[sequel]] to the 2001 film ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''.\n\nCritics regarded ''The Cradle of Life'' as an improvement on its predecessor, particularly in the action sequences, and continued to praise Jolie's performance as Lara Croft. Despite this, it did not repeat its box office performance, grossing $156 million compared to the previous instalment's $275 million. It was still a financial success, and plans were made for a sequel, but these were cancelled when Jolie declined to reprise her role as Croft.\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Santorini]] island, [[Greece]], a strong earthquake uncovers the Luna Temple. The temple was built by [[Alexander the Great]] to house his most prized treasures. Among these treasures is a glowing orb with a pattern resembling a code etched into it. Treasure-hunting [[archaeologist]] [[Lara Croft]] and her group find this orb but are ambushed by the Lo brothers; Chen and Xien, both of whom are crime lords and leaders of Chinese syndicate Shay Ling. The duo kill the group and take the orb but Lara escapes with a strange medallion.\n\n[[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] approaches Lara with information about [[Pandora's box]], an object from ancient legends that supposedly contains a deadly [[Pandemic|plague]] (the companion to the origin of life itself). The box, hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, can only be found with a magical sphere that serves as a map. The sphere is the same orb that was stolen by Chen Lo, who plans to sell it to Dr. Jonathan Reiss - a [[Nobel Prize]] winning scientist and business magnate turned misanthropic bio-weapon arms dealer.\n\nAgreeing that the sphere must be kept away from Reiss, Lara agrees to help MI6, with the condition that they release her old flame Terry Sheridan, who is familiar with Chen Lo's criminal operation. Together, Terry and Lara infiltrate Chen Lo's lair, where he is smuggling the [[Terracotta Army|Terracotta Soldiers]]. Lara defeats him in a fight and learns that the orb is in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. In Shanghai she discovers Chen's brother Xien is trying to hand over the orb to Reiss, however once Xien hands the orb over, Reiss betrays Xien and executes him, but not before Lara manages to put a tracker on the crate containing the orb during the handoff.\n\nLara and Terry manage to find the orb in a lab housed in Hong Kong. However Lara is captured by Reiss and his men. Reiss reveals his plans to unleash the plague, saving only those people he deems worthy. He is about to kill Lara Croft. Helpless and condemned, Lara is saved by Terry and then they take the orb before fleeing using [[Wingsuit flying|wingsuits]]. The next day, Lara uses the orb and learns the location of the mysterious Cradle of Life; in [[Kenya]], Africa near [[Mount Kilimanjaro]]. After Lara sends returns information to her friend Bryce back at Croft Manor, Reiss and his men infiltrate the mansion and capture him and Hillary. Lara travels to Kenya where she meets up with her longtime friend Kosa. They question a local tribe about the Cradle of Life, wherein the chief states that the Cradle of Life is in a crater protected by the \"Shadow Guardians\".\n\nAs they set out on an expedition, Reiss' men ambush them and kill the tribesmen. Outnumbered, Lara surrenders. Using her companions as hostages, Reiss forces Lara to lead him to the Cradle of Life. At the crater, they encounter the Shadow Guardians, monsters that appear in and out of wet patches on dead trees. The creatures kill most of Reiss' men but Lara manages to find the \"key hole\" and drops the Orb in it. The creatures disintegrate and the entrance to the Cradle of Life opens.\n\nLara and Reiss are drawn into the Cradle, a labyrinth made of a strange crystalline substance where normal laws of physics do not apply. Inside, they find a pool of highly corrosive black acid (linking back to one of the myths about Pandora's box), in which the box floats. Terry arrives, frees the hostages and catches up to Lara.\n\nLara fights Reiss but Reiss succeeds in retrieving his gun. He is about to shoot her, throw her into the acid and take Pandora's Box, but unfortunately for him Terry distracts him and saves Lara. Then Lara knocks Reiss down and throws him into the acid pool, which kills and dissolves him. Then Terry announces his intention to take the box for himself. When he refuses to back down, Lara regretfully shoots him dead, replaces the box in the pool and leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Angelina Jolie]] as [[Lara Croft]]\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Dr. Jonathan Reiss\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Terry Sheridan\n* [[Chris Barrie]] as Hillary\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Bryce\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as Kosa\n* [[Til Schweiger]] as Sean\n* [[Simon Yam]] as Chen Lo\n* [[Terence Yin]] as Xien\n* [[Tom Wu]] as Sean's Man\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Submarine Captain\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe budget for the film was $95 million (less than the first film's $115 million budget), and like the first film, it was financed through [[Tele M\u00fcnchen Gruppe]].

But more from the reason how the studio tried to really interfere with it in a way. And the thing itself is that the makers of the game were also involved. And they never told me that they, also, have a say in the story. Suddenly there were all these changes that have taken, and who had to be what, and what cast. And then suddenly it became such a big scene. Everything was a big deal.\" About working with Angelina Jolie he said: \"I kind of like working with her, and she\u2019s a character, but I thought she was a very interesting character to work with. She\u2019s definitely very opinionated. But not in a negative way, I feel. She was difficult to work with, but for me it was, probably, not a problem. I didn\u2019t really see anything negative at that time. And I really ended up liking her very much, so.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/jan-de-bont-the-haunting-lara-croft-speed/|title = Filmmaker Jan de Bont Looks Back on 'The Haunting' and Lara Croft|date = 10 November 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Various artists]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 22, 2003<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tomb-raider-the-cradle-of-life-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000041113|title=Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life &#91;Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&#93; - Original Soundtrack &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Alternative rock]]|[[Electronic music|electronic]]}}\n| length     = 69:39\n| label      = {{hlist|[[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]]|[[Warner Bros.
