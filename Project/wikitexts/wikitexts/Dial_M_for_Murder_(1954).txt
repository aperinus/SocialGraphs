Unbeknownst to them, Tony has discovered their affair and is planning to have Margot killed so he can inherit her fortune.\n\nTony is aware that Charles Swann, an old acquaintance from [[Cambridge University]], has become a small-time con man with a criminal record. Tony invites Swann to his [[Maida Vale]] flat on a pretext, and tells him of Margot's affair. Tony also confides that six months previously, he stole Margot's handbag, which contained a love letter from Mark, and anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony entraps him, threatening to turn him in as Margot's blackmailer unless he kills Margot. With the added inducement of \u00a31,000 in cash, Swann agrees to the murder and Tony explains his plan. Tony and Mark will attend a party while Margot stays home alone. At a specific time when Margot is certain to be in bed, Swann will enter the flat using Margot's latchkey, which Tony will stash under the foyer carpet, and hide. Minutes later, Tony will telephone the flat from the party and Swann will kill Margot when she answers the call. Swann will then whistle over the phone to signal the job is done, leave signs of a burglary gone wrong, and replace the key under the foyer carpet when he departs.\n\nThe following night, Swann enters the flat and Tony calls as planned. When Margot comes to the phone, Swann tries to strangle her with his scarf, but she fatally stabs him with scissors. Upon hearing Margot plead for help instead of Swann's whistle, Tony advises her not to speak to anyone. He returns home, calls the police, sends Margot to bed, and transfers what he thinks is Margot's key from Swann's pocket into her handbag. He also attempts to frame Margot by planting Mark's letter on Swann and destroying Swann's scarf.\n\nThe next day Tony persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police. Chief Inspector Hubbard arrives and questions the Wendices and Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard says the evidence indicates that Swann entered through the front door, Tony claims that Swann must have been responsible for stealing Margot's handbag, and made a copy of her key. As Tony intends, Hubbard does not believe the story and arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her. Margot is found guilty of murder and [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|sentenced to death]].\n\nMonths later, on the day before Margot's scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony, saying he has devised a story for him to tell the police to save Margot. Mark's \"story\" is very close to what actually happened: that Tony paid Swann to kill Margot. Hubbard arrives unexpectedly, and Mark hides in the bedroom. Hubbard asks Tony about large sums of cash he has been spending around town, tricks Tony into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and inquires about Tony's [[attach\u00e9 case]]. Tony claims to have misplaced the case, but Mark, overhearing the conversation, finds it on the bed, full of banknotes. Deducing that the money was Tony's intended payoff to Swann, Mark confronts Tony and explains his theory to Hubbard. Tony \"confesses\" that the cash was Margot's blackmail payment to Swann, which he had concealed to protect her. Hubbard appears to accept Tony's explanation, and Mark leaves angrily. Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony's. As soon as Tony leaves, Hubbard uses Tony's key to re-enter the flat, followed by Mark. Hubbard had already discovered that the key in Margot's handbag was Swann's own latchkey and deduced that Swann had put the Wendices' key back in its hiding-place after unlocking the door. Now, correctly suspecting Tony of having conspired with Swann, Hubbard had developed an elaborate ruse to trap him.\n\nPlainclothes police officers bring Margot from prison to the flat. She tries unsuccessfully to unlock the door with the key in her handbag, then enters through the garden, proving to Hubbard that she is unaware of the hidden key and is therefore innocent. Hubbard has Margot's handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. The key from Margot's bag does not work, so he uses the hidden key to open the door, demonstrating his guilt and exonerating Margot. With his escape routes blocked by Hubbard and another policeman, Tony calmly makes himself a drink and congratulates Hubbard.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Dial M.jpg|thumb|Cummings, Kelly, and Milland]]\n* [[Ray Milland]] as Tony Wendice\n* [[Grace Kelly]] as Margot Mary Wendice\n* [[Robert Cummings]] as Mark Halliday\n* [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as Chief Inspector Hubbard\n* [[Anthony Dawson]] as Charles Alexander Swann/Captain Lesgate \n* [[Leo Britt]] as storyteller at the party\n* [[Patrick Allen]] as Detective Pearson\n* [[Robin Hughes (actor)|Robin Hughes]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Martin Milner]] as policeman outside Wendice flat (uncredited)\n* George Leigh as Detective Williams\n* George Alderson as First Detective\n\n==Production==\nAfter ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953), Hitchcock planned to film ''The Bramble Bush'', based on the 1948 novel by [[David Duncan (writer)|David Duncan]], as a [[Transatlantic Pictures]] production, with partner [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]].

After one preview performance on May 18 and four showings on the May 19, a Philadelphia theater manager frantically contacted the studio and said that people were staying away in droves. He asked for permission to drop the 3-D and show the film flat.\n\n''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported on May 23 that the \"first audiences proved to be a jury that could not only make up its mind, but could make it up in a hurry.

This revival performed so well that Warner Bros. did a limited national re-release of the film in February 1982 using [[Chris Condon]]'s single-strip StereoVision 3-D system.
