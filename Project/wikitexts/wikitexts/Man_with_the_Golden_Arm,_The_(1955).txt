A drug addict (the drug is never named, but [[heroin]] is strongly implied), Frankie became clean in prison. On the outside, he greets friends and acquaintances. Sparrow, who runs a con selling homeless dogs, clings to him like a young brother, but Schwiefka, whom Frankie used to deal for in his illegal card game, has more sinister reasons for welcoming him back, as does Louie, Machine's former drug dealer.\n\nFrankie returns home to his wife Zosh, who supposedly needs to use a wheelchair after a car crash some years earlier that was caused by Frankie driving drunk. Zosh is secretly fully recovered, but pretends to be unable to walk to keep making Frankie feel guilty so he will stay with her. Frankie comments on the whistle she wears around her neck, a device she used in Frankie's absence to summon a neighbor, Vi, when needed.  With Frankie home, Zosh smothers her husband in their small tenement apartment and hinders his attempt to make something of himself. He thinks he has what it takes to play drums for a big band. While calling to make an appointment, he bumps into an old flame, Molly, who works in a local strip joint as a hostess and lives in the apartment below Frankie's. Unlike Zosh, Molly encourages his dream of becoming a drummer.\n\nFrankie soon gets himself a tryout and asks Sparrow to get him a new suit, but the suit is a stolen one and he ends up back in a cell at a local [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police precinct]]. Schwiefka offers to pay the bail. Frankie refuses, but soon changes his mind when the sight of a drug addict on the edge becomes too much for him. Now, to repay the debt, he must deal cards for Schwiefka again. Louie is trying to hook him on drugs again, and with no job and Zosh to please, pressure is building from all directions.\n\nSoon Frankie succumbs and is back on drugs and dealing marathon all-night card games for Schwiefka. Molly sees he is using drugs again and runs away from him. He gets a tryout as a drummer but spends 24 hours straight dealing a poker game, during which he is discovered cheating and beaten up. Desperately needing a fix, Frankie follows Louie home, attacks him, and ransacks his house, but cannot find his drug stash. At the audition, with withdrawal coming on, Frankie can't keep the beat and ruins his chance of landing the drumming job. When Louie goes to see Zosh to try to find Frankie, Louie discovers that Zosh has been faking her paralysis and can walk. Zosh, scared of being found out, pushes Louie over the railing of the stairwell to his death, but things backfire when Frankie is sought for Louie's murder.\n\nInitially not realizing he is a suspect in Louie's death, Frankie goes to Molly hoping to get money for a fix. After learning that Captain Bednar and the police are looking for him, Molly convinces Frankie that he must go [[cold turkey]] if he is to stand a chance with the police. Frankie agrees and is locked in Molly's apartment where he goes through a grueling withdrawal to clear the drugs from his body. Finally clean again, he tells Zosh he is going to leave her, start anew and stand trial. In her desperation to keep Frankie from leaving her, Zosh once again gives herself away, standing up in front of Frankie and the police. She runs, but can get no farther than the outside balcony. Trapped, she blows the whistle and throws herself off the balcony to her death. A police ambulance then arrives to remove Zosh's lifeless body and drives away, while Frankie watches in dismay. He then walks away, with Molly following as Sparrow can be seen walking away in the opposite direction.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as Frankie \"Dealer\" Machine\n* [[Eleanor Parker]] as Sophia \"Zosh\" Machine\n* [[Kim Novak]] as Molly Novotny\n* [[Arnold Stang]] as Sparrow\n* [[Darren McGavin]] as \"Nifty Louie\" Fomorowski\n* [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] as Zero Schwiefka\n* [[John Conte (actor)|John Conte]] as Drunkie John\n* [[Doro Merande]] as Vi\n* [[George E.

However, production was delayed because the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code Authority (PCA)]] refused to approve the script, with [[Joseph Breen]] stating that the basic story was \"unacceptable\" because of the Code's prohibition on showing illegal drug trafficking and drug addiction. The ability to obtain PCA approval was critical because at that time, many movie theaters would not show films that had not received approval. The PCA further predicted that the subject would also be unacceptable to the [[National Legion of Decency]] (a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] film censor board), Federal authorities, and state and local censor boards in the United States and abroad. Garfield died in 1952 and the film rights were acquired by [[Otto Preminger]] from his estate.<ref name=afi />\n\nPreminger had previously released ''[[The Moon Is Blue (film)|The Moon Is Blue]]'' (1953), which succeeded at the box office despite being denied the [[Production Code]] seal of approval due to its sexual subject matter.<ref name=phillips /> He told [[Peter Bogdanovich]] why he was attracted to Algren's novel: \"I think there's a great tragedy in any human being who gets hooked on something, whether it's heroin or love or a woman or whatever.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bogdanovich|first=Peter|title=Who the Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors|year=1997|publisher=Alfred A.

Krim|Arthur Krim]], expressed the company's hope that the PCA would make an exception to its usual rules and grant the film approval because of the film's \"immense potential for public service.\" The film received several advance bookings in November and early December 1955, before the PCA had made a decision on whether to grant a Code seal.<ref name=afi />\n\nHowever, in early December 1955, the PCA denied the film a Code seal, and the decision was upheld upon appeal to the MPAA.

Large theater circuits including [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews]] also refused to ban the film and instead showed it despite the lack of a Code seal.

In the novel, Frankie served in [[World War II]] and became addicted to morphine following treatment for a war injury. There is little mention of Frankie's film counterpart serving in the war, and he tells Molly that he started drugs \"for kicks.\"\n\nIn Algren's novel, Frankie is a blond-haired man in his late 20s, and as a poor veteran he often wears a torn Army jacket and [[brogan (shoes)|brogans]]. Played by Sinatra (who was nearly 40 years old at the time), the film's protagonist has dark hair and normally wears slacks and a dress shirt. In the film he is given a drum set and almost lands a job as a [[big band]] drummer, but in the novel he only has a [[practice pad]], and his dream of being a drummer is only a fleeting aspiration.\n\nThe novel implies that Zosh's paralysis is a [[Wiktionary:psychosomatic|psychosomatic]] symptom of her mental illness, but in the film she is deliberately deceiving Frankie and is fully able to walk.\n\nThe novel's version of Violet (\"Vi\") is an attractive young woman and Sparrow's love interest. In the film, she is played by [[Doro Merande]], who was in her 60s at the time. The movie combines the character of her spouse, \"Old Husband\" Koskozka, with that of the landlord, \"Jailer\" Schwabatski.\n\nFrankie's employer, Schwiefka, is a relatively neutral character in the novel, but in the film he is a villain and Nifty Louie's partner.\n\nIn the novel, Frankie inadvertently kills Nifty Louie during a fight, while in the film, a walking Zosh pushes Louie to his death.\n\nAlgren's novel ends with a cornered and hopeless Frankie committing suicide, but in the film Zosh is the one who dies, while Sinatra's Frankie and Novak's Molly survive the end of the film together.\n\nIn April 1956, Preminger and others were sued by Algren, who was seeking an injunction to keep him from claiming ownership of the property as \"An Otto Preminger Film\". Algren's suit said the original agreement in 1949 for the film rights had promised him a percentage of the gross for the screen rights. However, he had to drop the suit because he could not afford the legal fees.<ref name=afi /><ref name=\"TCM\" /><ref name=fuji194>Fujiwara, [https://books.google.com/books?id=z-2-CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA194#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 194].</ref>\n\n==Preservation==\nThe [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''The Man with the Golden Arm'' in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=The+Man+with+the+Golden+Arm&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref> In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"Alter\"/>\n\n==Musical score and soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Man with the Golden Arm\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Elmer Bernstein]]\n| cover      = \n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = Mid February 1956<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pR4EAAAAMBAJ&q=bernstein+man+Golden+Arm+1956&pg=PA30 |title=''Billboard'' Feb 25, 1956 |date=1956-02-25 |access-date=2015-11-03}}</ref>\n| recorded   = September & December, 1955<br><small>Hollywood, CA</small>\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     = 45:22\n| label      = [[Decca Records|Decca]]<br><small>DL 8257</small>\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Elmer Bernstein]]\n| prev_title = [[The Eternal Sea]]\n| prev_year  = 1955\n| next_title = [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]\n| next_year  = 1956\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> \n}}\nThe [[film score]] was composed, arranged and conducted by [[Elmer Bernstein]], and the [[soundtrack album]] was released on the [[Decca Records|Decca]] label in February 1956.<ref name=\"Decca discography\">Edwards, D., Callahan, M., Eyries, P., Watts, R., & Neely, T.
