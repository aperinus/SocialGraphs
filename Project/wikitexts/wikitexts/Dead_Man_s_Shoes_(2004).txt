The film also stars [[Toby Kebbell]], [[Gary Stretch]] and [[Stuart Wolfenden]]. It was released in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2004 and in the United States on 12 May 2006. Filming took place in the summer of 2003 over the course of three weeks.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story details the return of Richard to his home town of [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]], [[Derbyshire]], in the [[Peak District]], England, after serving as a [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|paratrooper]] in the [[British Army]]. Richard and his younger, mentally impaired brother, Anthony, camp at an abandoned farm near the town. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] reveal Anthony's abuse by a group of drug dealers in the town; Richard vows to take revenge.\n\nRichard has a face-to-face confrontation with Herbie, one of the abusers, who does not recognise him at first. Later, Herbie and friends Soz and Tuff are in a flat taking drugs. He tells them about the confrontation, and states he thinks the man might be Anthony's brother, who has been away serving in the army. When Herbie leaves he sees a man in a military gas mask banging on the front door of the block. Soz and Tuff run outside but the man is nowhere to be seen. When they go back into their flat, they discover Richard has ransacked it, stolen the drugs, and spray-painted the words \"[[Cheyne-Stokes respiration|Cheyne Stoking]]\", a pun on the scientific name for the pattern of breathing a human being goes into when they are dying.\n\nThe next day the thugs visit Sonny, the de facto leader of the gang, to explain where the drugs went. When they meet, Sonny has had his face painted but doesn't realise. The other gang members arrive during this time and they have had their hair and clothes painted as well. They all suspect one another of playing games until Herbie states that the man he saw in the pool hall is Richard, Anthony's brother. All of the gang become silent as they realise that Richard is back in town.\n\nThe men encounter Richard while driving in their [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]]. He makes it clear that he is not scared of any of them and invites them to come and find him at the old farm where he is staying. The gang leaves, with Sonny visibly concerned at Richard's apparent lack of fear. That evening, while the gang are hiding out and playing cards, Sonny decides that they should shoot Richard. When one of the members leaves, Richard (having sneaked into the house) brutally kills him with an axe, using the dead man's blood to smear the words \"One Down\" on the wall.\n\nThe next morning, they take their car and go to the farm where Richard is staying with Anthony. Sending in Big Al (one of their members) to draw Richard out, Sonny prepares to shoot him with a rifle and their only round. However, he misses and kills Al. With no rounds remaining in the rifle, they retreat and return to town as Richard smiles.\n\nThe surviving members stop at a local petrol station where the car breaks down and Tuff runs off, scared of Richard's revenge. Later at Sonny's house, they arm themselves and search the place, expecting Richard to be there. They do not find him, although he is hiding in the kitchen pantry. While they are upstairs, Richard laces their kettle with a cocktail of the drugs he took from the gang earlier in the film. The three men become completely intoxicated a few hours later, and Richard reappears to kill them one by one. He toys with them, dancing and joking. He shoots Sonny in the head, and kills Soz with an upward palm strike. He then sits Herbie down and brings out a suitcase, which has Tuff's corpse inside. Richard then tells him he is a good man and will let him live if he tells him where the final gang member is since he left the gang years before. He tells him without hesitation, and Richard hugs him. But he finds Herbie's knife and asks him if it was to be used on him. Herbie lies at first before telling the truth, but Richard stabs him regardless. Richard leaves right after.\n\nThe next day, Richard arrives in a nearby town where the final gang member, Mark, lives with his wife and two boys. He talks with the children's mother and asks her to let her husband know that he is Richard, Anthony's brother. When Mark returns home, she explains the conversation to her husband. Terrified, he tells her how the gang abused Anthony. The abuse culminated with them pretending to hang him at a local ruined castle whilst he was high on acid. This final episode of abuse culminates with Anthony actually hanging himself after his 'friends' run off. It then becomes clear that Richard has been alone the whole time and talking to a vision of his dead brother.\n\nThe next morning, Richard sneaks into Mark's house and takes him hostage using a knife. He makes him drive to the same ruined castle where Anthony hanged himself and demands he tell him his part in what happened. Mark explains how his fault was in not stopping the abuse. Richard confesses to his crimes against the other men and reveals that he thought of Anthony as an embarrassment to him because of his mental disabilities. He tells Mark how he now feels like a monster and that he simply wants to lie down with his brother. Richard gives the knife to Mark and demands that he kill him lest he continue his monstrous ways. Mark refuses, but Richard clasps his hands and pulls them towards him. Mark eventually stabs and kills Richard before stumbling away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paddy Considine]] as Richard\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Anthony\n* [[Gary Stretch]] as Sonny\n* [[Stuart Wolfenden]] as Herbie\n* [[Neil Bell (actor)|Neil Bell]] as Soz\n* Paul Sadot as Tuff\n* Seamus O'Neil as Big Al\n* George Newton as Gypsy John\n* Paul Hurstfield as Mark\n* Emily Aston as Patti\n* [[Jo Hartley]] as Marie\n* Craig Considine as Craig\n* Matt Considine as Matt\n* [[Andrew Shim]] as Elvis\n* [[Kephas Leroc]] as K\n\n==Production==\nAfter completing ''[[Once Upon a Time in the Midlands]]'', Shane Meadows had gone on a hiatus. Paddy Considine had made the short film ''[[My Wrongs]]'', which was the first project of Warp Films. Considine introduced Meadows to Warp's Mark Herbert and showed him some of their earlier short films. Based on those, Herbert agreed to fund the making of a movie.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Webber |first1=Jolyon |title=Warp Films @ 10: Interview with Mark Herbert BFI |url=http://www.port-magazine.com/film/warp-films-10-interview-with-mark-herbert/ |website=Port Magazine |access-date=November 15, 2021 |date=April 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nMeadows was keen to get back to his short film roots and cowrote the script with Considine and long-time collaborator Paul Fraser. Originally intended to be a black comedy about a heroic social worker based on a real-life event that Considine had come across, the story took a darker turn when Meadows remembered a friend with disabilities who had died when he was young.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanemeadows.co.uk/briefscript.htm|title=Shanemeadows.co.uk|website=Shanemeadows.co.uk|access-date=23 November 2021}}</ref> Taking inspiration from these real-life situations they had experienced and people they had encountered and the feel of exploitation films,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/15/features.review1|title=Shane Meadows: Every small town has its secrets|date=15 August 2004|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=23 November 2021}}</ref> Meadows and Considine turned in a story outline originally titled ''The Skull''. There was no definitive script, with most of the scenes and lines existing as a rough draft.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paddy Considine talking about \"Dead Man's Shoes\" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlQpAi9cNz0 |website=YouTube |access-date=November 15, 2021}}</ref> As a result, most of the dialogue and set pieces were improvised on set.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shanemeadows.co.uk/extras.htm|title=Shanemeadows.co.uk|access-date=23 November 2021}}</ref>\n\nToby Kebbell was cast at short notice after the actor who had originally been intended to play the character of Anthony dropped out due to concerns about playing the learning difficulties realistically. The character was rewritten from an older brother to a younger brother accordingly.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Toby Kebbell {{!}} Neil Young's Film Lounge |url=https://www.jigsawlounge.co.uk/film/reviews/neil-youngs-film-lounge-interview-with-toby-kebbell/ |website=Jigsaw Lounge |access-date=November 15, 2021 |date=March 23, 2004}}</ref> Similarly, former boxer Gary Stretch was hired at the eleventh hour after expressing interest in making films in Britain.

Neil Bell's character was scripted to be killed off first, but because of how well he worked on set, it was decided that another character would die and the scene was rewritten overnight. A violent confrontation between Richard and the gang was also changed to the scene in which Richard threatens Sonny.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Foley |first1=Jen |title=BBC - Films - Toby Kebbell |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/10/01/toby_kebbell_dead_mans_shoes_interview.shtml |website=BBC |access-date=November 15, 2021 |date=October 1, 2004}}</ref>\n\nFilming took place in and around the town of [[Matlock, Derbyshire]] in May 2003, with re-shoots and pick up shots taken in October the same year. The farm where Richard and Anthony stay is located in [[Bonsall, Derbyshire|Bonsall]]. [[Darley Dale]], [[Tansley]] and [[Riber]] feature heavily. The ending was shot at [[Riber Castle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.matlockmercury.co.uk/news/site-lifts-curtain-on-dales-film-locations-1-869686|title=Site lifts curtain on Dales film locations|website=Matlock Mercury|access-date=23 November 2021}}</ref> The film took three weeks to shoot.
