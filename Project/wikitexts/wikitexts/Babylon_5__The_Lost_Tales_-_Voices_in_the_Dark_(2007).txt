It features two linked plotlines viewed separately one after the other but covering the same 72-hour timespan.\n\n====''Voices in the Dark: Over Here''====\nThe first part called ''Voices in the Dark: Over Here'' features [[Colonel]] (formerly Captain during the series' run) Lochley on [[Babylon 5 (fictional space station)|Babylon 5]] awaiting Sheridan's arrival, who summons a priest from Earth (Father Cassidy) to help deal with a mysterious, seemingly supernatural problem. A maintenance crew member, Simon Burke, returns to Babylon 5 from a vacation on Earth and begins behaving erratically. Along with temperature changes in his part of the station, there is a foul odor. Burke (under control of something) claims that God \"salted\" this region of space with fallen angels to keep man in check. Father Cassidy struggles with deciding whether to perform the exorcism or bring in more clergy. Lockley investigates Burke and exposes his lie, confronting him that \"Hell\" is Earth and that his kind are bound to Earth so he attempted to \"hitchhike\" in Burke's body. She has him sedated and tells him she will have him \"exorcised\" on Earth where he will be trapped until the sun goes supernova. The sedatives knock him out after he says \"We will remember you.\"\n\n====''Voices in the Dark: Over There''====\nThe second part, ''Voices in the Dark: Over There'', follows ISA President [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] on his way to B5 for a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the formation of the Interstellar Alliance. During the journey he picks up the Centauri Prince [[Dius Vintari]] (third in line to the Centauri Imperial throne) on the edge of Centauri space, using a new ''Valen''-class cruiser, and receives a warning from Galen the techno-mage about Earth's destruction in 30 years by Vintari's hand to restore the Centauri Republic to glory. Galen proposes killing Vintari in a Starfury weapons malfunction. Sheridan goes along with it until he realizes there were \"ways\" to prevent that future. Sheridan chooses instead to have Vintari live on Minbar where he can be taught compassion. Galen confronts Sheridan about his decision, but Sheridan forces Galen to all but admit that was his actual goal to maneuver him into that choice.<ref name=\"babylon5scriptsTLT\" />  The story introduces the concept of ''quantum space''.\n\n===Cast===\n* [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as President [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]]\n* [[Tracy Scoggins]] as Colonel [[Elizabeth Lochley]]\n* [[Peter Woodward]] as [[Technomage#Galen|Galen]]\n* [[Alan Scarfe]] as Father Cassidy\n* [[Bruce Ramsay]] as Simon Burke\n* [[Teryl Rothery]] as ISN reporter Ms. Chambers\n* [[Keegan Macintosh]] as Prince Vintari\n* [[Craig Veroni]] as Guard\n\n===Extras===\nThe ''Voices in the Dark'' DVD contains a certain number of extras, including behind-the-scenes pieces. There also was supposed to be \"a number of original short pieces\" to be shot in February 2007.<ref name=\"babylon5scriptsTLT\" /> There were six \"promosodes\" written, featuring, among other characters, [[Lennier]].

Some of these were intended to be shown at conventions, specifically the [[New York Comic Con]] and [[Comic-Con International]] conventions of 2007, some were released via the Internet, and some were released on the DVD.

Prior to the strike, Straczynski urged [[Warner Brothers]] to commission a new DVD as they were suitably impressed with the sales for the first DVD. However, Warner Bros. felt that the Writer's Guild would not go on strike and refused to speed up the bureaucratic process; in their words, \"We don't want to be pressured in the process because we know there's not going to be a strike this year, we can handle the Guild\".<ref>{{cite web | title=Re: JMS: Fugiting Tempus | url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-17700 | date=2007-12-08}}</ref> At the Emerald City Comic Convention in May 2008, after the strike, Straczynski briefly updated fans on the prospects for more releases. He noted that two divisions of Warner Bros. seemed to be \"discussing\" wanting a feature film or more ''Lost Tales'' but had come to an agreement and hadn't gotten to the point of guaranteeing Straczynski total creative control in the case of a feature film. The budget for the first disc was two million dollars.<ref name=emeraldcity1>{{cite web | title=Re: JMS at emerlad city comic con | url=http://jmsnews.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2755&page=3 | date=2008-05-11}}</ref>\n\nOn July 13, 2008, Straczynski revealed that he had no plans to continue ''The Lost Tales''. He said that although the studio was interested in another disc, they wanted to budget the next installment similarly to the first. Citing his disappointment with the first release due to the low budget, Straczynski said he did not want to dilute ''Babylon 5'''s legacy with further sub-par stories. He stated that he would only return to the ''Babylon 5'' universe if Warner Bros. wanted to do a large-budgeted cinema release.<ref name=\"update\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100327174601/http://babylon5.warnerbros.com/ Official Babylon 5 Website] contains TLT section, including trailer and behind the scenes diaries\n* {{IMDb title|0871427}}\n* [https://archive.today/20080117082629/http://www.babylon5scripts.com/TLT-JMS-Photos.html B5:TLT Pre-Production - Babylon5scripts.com] Contains personal set photos and update letters by J.
