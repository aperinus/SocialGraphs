His girlfriend Samantha leaves him for being emotionally shut off, which is implied to be the result of John losing his father, firefighter Frank to a fire when he was six years old. John's lifelong friend and neighbor, Gordo, stops by and finds a [[Heathkit#The SB-series and HW-series|Heathkit]] [[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] [[ham radio]] that once belonged to Frank, but fails to get it working.\n\nThe night before the anniversary of his father's death, John is surprised to find the radio operating during a particularly intense occurrence of the [[aurora borealis]], and has a brief conversation with another man concerning the [[1969 World Series]], which John is able to recount in specific detail. He realizes from this and other details that he is communicating with his father on the same date in 1969, and warns him of the mistake that led to his death. Frank is alarmed and refuses to believe it, but the next day, while rescuing a child from a burning warehouse, recalls John's warning and survives the fire.\n\nIn 1999, John is struck with new memories of his father surviving into the 80s until his death from lung cancer. He reconnects with Frank, who now believes him.\n\nJohn discovers that his present has been changed in other unexpected ways. He has inadvertently prevented the death of the \"Nightingale\", a serial killer who originally murdered three nurses in the 1960s and was never caught. The killer has now killed 10 women, including John's own mother Julia. To save her and the other future victims, John enlists Frank's help in stopping the Nightingale before he can kill again.\n\nFollowing information from John about the killings, Frank manages to save the first victim, but when he tries to rescue the second, the Nightingale subdues him, steals his driver's license, and plants it on the victim to frame Frank for the murder.\n\nWhen Frank shares his experience with his son, John realizes Frank's wallet has the Nightingale's fingerprints. John asks his father to hide the wallet somewhere in the house where John can find it 30 years later. Using the preserved fingerprints from the wallet, John identifies the Nightingale as Jack Shepard, a former detective.\n\nIn 1969, Frank's close friend (and John's future boss) detective Satch DeLeon arrests Frank on suspicion of murder; he resists, and the radio is knocked over and damaged. At the station, Frank attempts to prove his innocence to Satch by being able to accurately predict various aspects of the 1969 World Series, including the notable Game 5 \"shoe polish incident\". Frank escapes from the police station and breaks into Shepard's apartment, where he finds evidence of his murders. Shepard arrives and attacks Frank, who fends him off and appears to kill Shepard. Satch, having realized that Frank was telling the truth, arrives and find the victims' jewelry, exonerating Frank.\n\nFrank returns home and fixes the radio. He chooses to quit smoking, having been warned by John that he will eventually die of lung cancer. While talking over the radio, both Frank and John are attacked by the 1969 and 1999 versions of Shepard. Frank blows off Shepard's hand and he flees. In 1999, as John fights off Shepard, the house changes rapidly around them. An elderly Frank appears and kills Shepard with the same shotgun. He and John tearfully embrace.\n\nThe film concludes with a softball game including John, Samantha (now his wife and expecting a baby), John's young son, Frank, Julia, Satch and Gordo, who has become wealthy thanks to stock tips fed to him in the past by John.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Francis Patrick \"Frank\" Sullivan, a firefighter,  John's Father and Julia's husband\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as John Francis \"Johnny\" Sullivan, a detective and son of Frank and Julia\n** Daniel Henson as 6-year-old John \"Johnny\" Sullivan\n* [[Andre Braugher]] as Satch DeLeon\n* [[Elizabeth Mitchell]] as Julia \"Jules\" Sullivan, a nurse, John's mother and Frank's wife\n* [[Shawn Doyle]] as Jack Shepard\n* [[Rocco Sisto]] as Darryl Simpson\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Gordon \"Gordo\" Hersch, John's best friend\n** Stephen Joffe as 6-year-old Gordon \"Gordo\" Hersch\n* [[Melissa Errico]] as Samantha Thomas, John's ex-girlfriend\n* [[Jordan Bridges]] as Graham Gibson\n* [[Peter MacNeill]] as Butch Foster\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Gordon Hersch Jr., Gordo's son\n* [[Marin Hinkle]] as Sissy Clark\n* Prof. [[Brian Greene]] as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was [[greenlight]]ed for production on January 21, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117490459.html?categoryid=3&cs=1|title=Hoblit time-trips; old script scores for Iliff|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 26, 2007|date=January 21, 1999}}</ref> [[Sylvester Stallone]] was rumored to be taking the role of Frank Sullivan in 1997, but fell out of the deal after a dispute over his fee.<ref name=\"varietyjune1997\">{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1116679561.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Sly eyeing New Line's 'Frequency'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 27, 2007|date=June 6, 1997 | first=Dan | last=Cox}}</ref><ref name=\"varietyjuly1997\">{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117342811.html?categoryid=38&cs=1|title=INSIDE MOVES|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 13, 2007|last=Busch|first=Anita M.|date=June 27, 1997}}</ref> [[Renny Harlin]] was rumored to be director on the film.<ref name=\"varietyjune1997\" /><ref name=\"varietyjuly1997\" /> [[Gregory Hoblit]] first read the script in November 1997, eighteen months after his father's death.
