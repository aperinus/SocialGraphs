Inspired by the life of [[Robert Durst]], it stars [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], and [[Frank Langella]]. Gosling portrays the wealthy son of a New York real estate tycoon (Langella) who develops a disturbing relationship with his wife (Dunst) and becomes suspected of a series of murders, as well as his wife's unsolved disappearance.\n\n''All Good Things'' was filmed between April and July 2008 in [[Connecticut]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. Originally scheduled for a July 24, 2009 release, the film ultimately received a limited release on December 3, 2010.<ref name=\"Horn, John\">{{cite web|url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/08/magnolia-picks-up-andrew-jareckis-all-good-things.html|title=All Good Things release and distributor|author= John Horn|work=[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]|date=August 24, 2010|access-date=August 24, 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100829095957/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/08/magnolia-picks-up-andrew-jareckis-all-good-things.html| archive-date=29 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"All Good Things release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ioncinema.com/movie/id/8025| title=All Good Things release|work=Ioncinema|date=October 2010|access-date=October 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDurst professed admiration for the film, and after previously not cooperating with journalists, offered to be interviewed by Jarecki. Durst would ultimately sit with Jarecki for more than 20 hours over a multi-year period, which led to the six-part documentary miniseries ''[[The Jinx (miniseries)|The Jinx]]'' in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1970s [[New York City]], David Marks, the son of a powerful [[real estate]] tycoon Sanford Marks, marries Katie McCarthy, a working-class student. Together they try to establish a new life in [[Vermont]], setting up a health food store called All Good Things. However, Sanford manipulates David into returning to the city, telling him that Katie deserves more than he's currently giving her. Upon their return, Katie brings up the idea of having children. David says it will never ever happen, which leads Katie to assume something is wrong with his fertility. After buying a lake house, Katie confesses to their pregnant neighbor that she is expecting as well. David responds angrily upon finding out and forces Katie to make an appointment for an [[abortion]]. He misses the appointment when he is called away to do work for his father.\n\nKatie enters medical school while her relationship with David continues to deteriorate. She makes inquiries about a [[marital separation|separation]], but her funds, which she needs in order to pay for school, are cut off when she attempts to leave. Having been advised that she will need leverage to compel the family to let her leave David, Katie attempts to find incriminating documents of their financial activities. She then disappears without a trace in 1982, despite a $15,000 reward offered for any information on her whereabouts.\n\nEighteen years later, the case is reopened by the [[district attorney]] after reading an unpublished novel written by David's best friend, Deborah Lehrman, which contains a murder almost identical to the Marks case. Soon after this is announced, Lehrman is shot and killed in her home, and David is under suspicion again while standing trial for the murder of his neighbor Malvern Bump in [[Texas]]. David is [[acquittal|acquitted]] of the murder of Bump; the film states that nobody has ever been tried for Lehrman's murder and that Katie remains a missing person to this day. A flash-back implies that David left his wife's remains in the trunk of her car, which the father finds. The film ends with David visiting his dying father and whispering to him, \"I miss her so much.\" It's left to the viewer to decide whether he is talking about Katie or his mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as David Marks<ref name=Variety_cast>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979404.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1|title=Gosling, Dunst line up 'Good Things'|author=Tatiana Siegel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 21, 2008|access-date=June 13, 2008}}</ref> ([[Robert Durst]])\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Katie McCarthy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20172934,00.html |title=Dunst, Gosling Set for 'Good Things' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 22, 2008 |access-date=June 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529211109/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20172934%2C00.html |archive-date=May 29, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> ([[Robert Durst#Disappearance of Kathleen McCormack Durst|Kathleen McCormack]])\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Sanford Marks<ref name=Variety_FL>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117983452.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title='Good Things' in store for Langella| author = Miller, Winter|work=Variety| date=April 3, 2008|access-date=June 13, 2008}}</ref> ([[Seymour Durst]])\n* [[Lily Rabe]] as Deborah Lehrman<ref name=\"All Good Things\"/><ref>{{cite web|url = https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/01/the_american_plans_lily_rabe_o.html| title=The American Plan's Lily Rabe on Working With Mercedes Ruehl, and Her Next Role As a 'Mafia Princess'| author=Mori Fradkin|work=New York Magazine|date=January 22, 2009|access-date=January 26, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125212429/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/01/the_american_plans_lily_rabe_o.html| archive-date=January 25, 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref> ([[Susan Berman]])\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Malvern Bump<ref name=\"All Good Things\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1175709/|title=All Good Things| work=[[IMDb]]| access-date=October 30, 2009}}</ref> ([[Robert Durst#Morris Black|Morris Black]])\n* [[Michael Esper]] as Daniel Marks ([[Douglas Durst]])\n* [[Diane Venora]] as Janice Rizzo<ref name=\"All Good Things\"/> ([[Jeanine Pirro]])\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Jim McCarthy<ref name=\"All Good Things\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/heraldnews/lifestyles/1499134,4_5_JO29_OFFERMAN_S1.article |title=Hoosier boss?
