At the invitation of an old friend and colleague, Freddy Ross, Berlin heads to rural northern [[California]], for a job with the [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] police force. Instead, Berlin rankles his new colleagues, especially John Taylor, who was passed over for promotion to make room for Berlin.\n\nAfter finding a woman's severed hand in a garbage bag at the local dump, Berlin reopens the case of an unidentified murdered girl, nicknamed \"Jennifer\", which went unsolved despite a full-time six-month effort by the department. Berlin notes an unusually large number of scars on the hand, as well as wear on the finger-tips, which he realizes came from reading [[Braille]], determining that the girl is blind. He begins to believe the cases are related. Berlin does his best to convince Freddy and his fellow officers of his suspicions, but Taylor and police chief Citrine refuse to believe that the hand found at the dump is in any way connected to the other cases.\n\nAfter consulting his former colleagues in Los Angeles, Berlin discovers that in the previous four years, six women, most of them blind, have either been found dead or are still missing, all within a 300-mile radius of San Diego. He becomes convinced that \"Jennifer\" was the 7th victim and the girl whose hand was found at the dump is \"Jennifer 8\", or victim #8. While investigating the links between the dead and missing blind girls, he meets blind music teacher Helena Robertson, determining that her roommate Amber was the eighth victim. Berlin becomes obsessed with the case, despite an almost complete lack of hard evidence, and becomes romantically involved with Helena, who resembles his ex-wife.\n\nAfter an attack on Helena, Ross accompanies Berlin on a stakeout at the institute where Helena lives in a dorm, after leaving Helena with Ross' wife Margie. When they see a flashlight shining on the same floor as Helena's apartment, Berlin investigates and is knocked unconscious by the killer, who then shoots and kills Ross with Berlin's .32 pistol. A grueling interrogation of Berlin by [[FBI]] special agent St. Anne ensues. St. Anne makes clear to Berlin that he figures him for Ross's murderer, but also inadvertently reveals information which helps Berlin realize that Sgt. Taylor is the true killer. Berlin tells St. Anne and Citrine who he believes the killer to be, but his deductions are met with disbelief. Berlin is arrested for Ross's murder, but is bailed out by Margie, who does not believe that Berlin is the killer.\n\nUpon making bail, Berlin returns to Margie's house only to learn that Margie has taken Helena back to the institute. Fearing that Helena and Margie are in danger, Berlin rushes to the institute, but fails to arrive ahead of Taylor, who breaks in and chases Helena through the dorm. Finally catching up to her, Taylor is shocked to discover that the woman he'd been pursuing is actually Margie. She  shoots Taylor dead, avenging her husband and closing the case.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Sergeant John Berlin\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Helena Robertson\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Sergeant Freddy Ross\n* [[Graham Beckel]] as Sergeant John \"J.K.\" Taylor\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Margie Ross\n* [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] as Chief Citrine\n* [[John Malkovich]] as FBI Special Agent St. Anne\n* [[Perry Lang]] as Travis\n* Nicholas Love as Bisley\n* [[Thomas J. Hageboeck]] as Max\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Director Goodridge\n* [[Lenny Von Dohlen]] as Blattis\n* Bryan Larkin as Bobby Ross\n* Stephen Piemonte II as Trimble\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Eureka, California]], and [[Trinidad, California]], as well as in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] at [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital]] and at [[London Heritage Farm]]. The dump scene was filmed in [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia]]. Scenes were also shot on the Fishing Vessel Duke. The Marine Garage in [[Steveston]] also makes a brief appearance. John Berlins [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] farmhouse was shot on location at Jackson Farm in Maple Ridge, British Columbia. The film's sets were designed by the art director [[Richard Macdonald (art director)|Richard Macdonald]].\n\nBruce Robinson later said that the film had been hurt by studio interference: \"There were four different heads of studio on that movie, they all wanted different things. The worst thing happened before we made the movie and that was having Andy (Garc\u00eda), great guy that he is, on the movie. I didn't write it for a handsome young lead, I wrote it for a shagged out old cop like [[Gene Hackman]] or [[Al Pacino]] (...) The problem is the moment you see Andy Garc\u00eda and Uma Thurman on screen together you think, \"''That ain't bad. A couple of romantic leads, that's nice''.\" The whole point was that he was this fucked guy; he was [[Rod Steiger]] if you like.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Peter|title=Interview with Bruce Robinson|url=http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/brucerobinson.html|access-date=2007-08-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184620/http://www.laurahird.com/newreview/brucerobinson.html|archive-date=7 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.
