The film is about the life and career of [[Tejano music]] star [[Selena|Selena Quintanilla P\u00e9rez]], following her rise to fame and tragic death when she was [[Murder of Selena|murdered]] by [[Yolanda Sald\u00edvar]] at the age of 23.\n\nThe film stars [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Selena Quintanilla P\u00e9rez. [[Edward James Olmos]] plays Selena's father [[Abraham Quintanilla|Abraham Quintanilla Jr.]] and [[Constance Marie]] plays Selena's mother Marcella Quintanilla. ''Selena'' was released on March 21, 1997, in the United States, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], and received positive reviews upon release.\n\nIn 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2021-12-19|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> The film was re-released in select theaters in the United States on April 7, 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|title='Selena' biopic will return to theaters in April to celebrate its 25th anniversary|website=NPR|date=22 March 2022|url=https://www.npr.org/2022/03/22/1088082740/selena-movie-returns-to-theaters|last1=Franklin|first1=Jonathan}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens at the [[Houston Astrodome]] in [[Houston, Texas]] on February 26, 1995, where [[Tejano music|Tejano]] superstar [[Selena|Selena Quintanilla P\u00e9rez]] [[Selena LIVE! The Last Concert|plays to a sold-out crowd]] (\"Disco Medley\").\n\nThen we flashback to 1961, where young [[Abraham Quintanilla|Abraham Quintanilla Jr.]] and his band \"The Dinos\" are rejected by a restaurant owner after an audition in Texas. They perform for a Mexican-American nightclub, but a riot ensues when they don't perform the audience's preferred Tejano music (\"Oldies Medley\"), but rather American pop.\n\nTwenty years later, Abraham is married to Marcella Samora, with three children: son [[A.B. Quintanilla|Abraham III (A.B.)]], and daughters Suzette and Selena. Discovering Selena's singing talent, he creates the band [[Selena y Los Dinos]], with she as lead singer, A.B. on bass, and Suzette on drums. Initially reluctant, the children enjoy making music (\"[[We Belong Together (Robert & Johnny song)|We Belong Together]]\"). Moving to [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], the band goes on the road to support the family. After lackluster reception at a carnival, Selena begins adding more dance and personality into her acts. The band's success grows following local performances. In 1989, Selena reveals her bustier during a carnival performance (\"[[Baila Esta Cumbia]]\"), angering Abraham due to its sexually suggestive nature.\n\nIn 1990, [[Chris P\u00e9rez]] auditions as the guitarist. Abraham disapproves of his [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] style but hires him after he agrees to cut his hair. Selena and Chris eventually fall in love. In 1992, when Chris' former band members trash a hotel suite, Abraham threatens to fire him. A.B. pleads with him to reconsider, mentioning he is needed for their upcoming tour in Mexico. Promoters worry when they realize Selena does not speak Spanish well, but her personality and care for her fans win everyone over. A show almost goes awry when the huge crowd rushes the stage and it buckles (\"[[La Carcacha]]\"). Selena calms them down with a joyous performance (\"[[Como la Flor]]\") and is accepted as an \"artist for the people\" in Mexico.\n\nCatching Selena hugging Chris on the tour bus, Abraham fires him and threatens a heartbroken Selena and the rest of the family with disbandment if they disobey him. They secretly continue their romance, eventually eloping at the [[Nueces County]] Courthouse. Selena insists, stating that Abraham will never willingly accept their relationship. The day after a radio station announces their marriage. Abraham tells Selena he is proud of her maturity, having realized that he was too harsh on her and Chris. The Quintanillas congratulate them, accept Chris into their family, and rehire him as the guitarist.\n\nIn 1994, [[Jos\u00e9 Behar]] and music executives from [[EMI Latin]] attend a Selena concert (\"[[Bidi Bidi Bom Bom]]\"/\"[[No Me Queda M\u00e1s]]\"), offering her to record an English-language album, showing that she has successfully broken down cultural barriers. Selena opens her first [[Selena Etc.]] boutique and asks her fan club president [[Yolanda Sald\u00edvar]] to manage it. Her [[Selena Live!|live album]] wins a [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Grammy for Best Mexican-American album]], so her staff chip in to get her a celebratory gift. After claiming she knows the perfect gift and suggesting they give her all of the money to buy it, Yolanda gives Selena a ring resembling the Faberge eggs but does not mention it was a group present. She begins recording her [[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|crossover album]] (\"[[I Could Fall In Love]]\") and she and Chris plan to start a family together.\n\nOne night, Abraham tells Selena fans are upset as they paid to join her fan club but received nothing. Other funds that Yolanda has been handling cannot be accounted for, and vital business records are missing. Summoned to [[Q-Productions]] and confronted by Abraham, Selena, and Suzette, Yolanda denies wrongdoing and says she will find the missing documents. While on the road Selena talks to her mom about being accepted in the English-speaking market and expresses thoughts about starting a family. While dreaming about the crossover tour (\"[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]\"), the scene cuts to a news report of March 31, 1995, where a paramedic is tending to Selena who is shot and killed offscreen by Yolanda after attempting to retrieve some financial papers. Yolanda ends up in a standoff with cops, putting her gun over her head to hold them off. After Selena dies, the family mourns her death and is followed by a candlelight vigil held by fans while a montage of the real Selena is shown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as [[Selena|Selena Quintanilla P\u00e9rez]]\n** Rebecca Lee Meza as Young Selena\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as [[Abraham Quintanilla|Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]]\n** [[Panchito G\u00f3mez]] as Young Abraham\n* [[Constance Marie]] as Marcela Quintanilla\n* [[Jon Seda]] as [[Chris P\u00e9rez]]\n* [[Lupe Ontiveros]] as [[Yolanda Sald\u00edvar]]\n* [[Jackie Guerra]] as Suzette Quintanilla\n** Victoria Elena Flores as Young Suzette\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as [[A.B.

The only songs featured on the soundtrack that were not in the film were \"Is it the Beat,\" \"Only Love\" and \"A Boy Like That,\" and Selena tributes sung by other artists. The only recordings heard in the film were the \"Cumbia Medley,\" \"Disco Medley\" and \"Where Did the Feeling Go?\", which was played in the last half of the film's closing credits. The Vidal Brothers' \"Oldies Medley\" was also in the film. All the other songs, including rare tracks, hits and cuts like the \"Disco Medley, Part II\" (which was recorded live during Selena's 1995 concert at the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]]), were live recordings of Selena in concerts.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Selena'' opened March 21, 1997 and earned $11.6 million on its opening weekend.

The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 67% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 48 reviews, with an average score of 6.10/10. The critics consensus reads, \"''Selena'' occasionally struggles to tell its subject's story with depth or perspective, but those flaws are rendered largely irrelevant by Jennifer Lopez in the title role.\"<ref>{{Cite web| title=''Selena'' (1997)- Rotten Tomatoes| website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1073427_selena?| url-status=live|  access-date= 22 Jan 2021}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 67 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews.\"<ref>{{Cite web| title=Critic Reviews for ''Selena''- Metacritic| website=[[Metacritic]]| url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/selena/critic-reviews| url-status=live| access-date=22 Jan 2021}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home - Cinemascore |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |publisher=[[CinemaScore]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]], film critic for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' was impressed by the acting, and gave ''Selena'' three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"Young Selena is played by Becky Lee Meza, who has a big smile and a lot of energy. The teenage and adult Selena is played by Lopez in a star-making performance. After her strong work as the passionate lover of [[Jack Nicholson]] in the current ''[[Blood and Wine]],'' here she creates a completely different performance, as a loyal Quintanilla who does most of her growing up on a tour bus with her dad at the wheel.\"<ref>[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/selena-1997 Ebert, Roger].

Lopez said \"you need to do your homework on this gig\" because Selena was \"fresh in the public's mind\".<ref name=\"EWc\"/>\n\nFilm critic Lisa Kropiewnicki liked the film and wrote, \"Jennifer Lopez delivers a breakout performance...[and] Nava's engaging script wisely mines his subject's life for humor and conflict, embracing Selena Quintanilla's passion for music.\"<ref>Kropiewnicki, Lisa. {{Amg movie|154769|Selena}}, film review. Last accessed: January 9, 2008.</ref> Film critic [[James Berardinelli]] also liked the film and the screenplay, writing, \"It would have been easy to trivialize Selena's story, turning it into a sudsy, made-for-[[television|TV]] type motion picture.\"  He believed the acting was top-notch and wrote \"Jennifer Lopez is radiant as the title character, conveying the boundless energy and enthusiasm that exemplified Selena, while effectively copying not only her look but her mannerisms. I wonder if Selena's family, upon watching this performance, felt an eerie sense of ''[[d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]]''.\"<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/selena.html Berardinelli, James]. ''Reel Views,'' film review, 1997. Last accessed: January 9, 2008.</ref>\n\n''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' film critic [[Kenneth Turan]] gave the film a mixed review. He wrote the film is part of a \"completely predictable Latino soap opera.\" However, he added that \"there are chunks of ''Selena'' that only a stone could resist. This movie turns out to be a celebration not only of the singer but also (as \"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (1993 film)|What's Love]]\" was for [[Angela Bassett]]) of the actress who plays her, Jennifer Lopez.\"<ref>[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie970321-5,2,2183.story Turan, Kenneth].

Critic Walter Addiego considers Nava's work a worshipful [[biography]] of her. Addiego, writing for the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]],'' did have a few enjoyable moments viewing the film but wrote, \"You can't help cheering for Selena, but the good feeling is diminished by the sense that her story's been simplified and sanitized.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1997/03/21/WEEKEND1948.dtl Addiego, Walter].
