The television film was released on American cable channel [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] on December 3, 2006. [[Gabrielle Anwar]], [[Bob Newhart]], [[Jane Curtin]] and [[Olympia Dukakis]] co-star. It is a sequel to 2004's ''[[The Librarian: Quest for the Spear]]''. The third film in the trilogy, ''[[The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice]]'', was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=October 2011}}\nFlynn Carsen ([[Noah Wyle]]) has been on many death-defying missions in his first year as [[The Librarian (franchise)|Librarian]]. He almost fails to retrieve a [[Crystal skull|Crystal Skull]] by holding on to another find, and Judson ([[Bob Newhart]]), his mentor, warns him that \"sometimes you have to give up what you want for the greater good\" It's \u201cthe difference between a good librarian and a great librarian.\u201d\n\nAt Flynn's 32nd birthday party, an old family friend, \"Uncle\" Jerry ([[Robert Foxworth]]), appears unexpectedly. Flynn's mother ([[Olympia Dukakis]]) gives Flynn the pictures he drew as a child to illustrate his father's \"silly bedtime stories\" and his father's [[amulet]]. Flynn finds his apartment ransacked; he is ambushed and robbed of a scroll he received in the mail that day. The scroll is a map containing clues to the location of [[King Solomon's Mines]]. Judson tells him that the [[Key of Solomon]] (a book), hidden in the mines will give the reader of it control over [[time]] and [[space]]; the secret must be kept.\n\nSearching Roman ruins in Morocco, Flynn meets Emily Davenport ([[Gabrielle Anwar]]), an archaeologist who holds more degrees than he does. (They argue constantly.) Flynn and Emily are attacked after they find a piece to the map legend, but their assailant becomes an ally when Flynn's amulet lights up and identifies him as one of the order of the [[Cryptic Masonry|Cryptic Masons]]. He tells them where to find the rest of the map legend. Emily recognizes the markings as Akon\u2014a cipher, not a language\u2014and  insists on coming with him to [[Kenya]]. A General Samir is on the trail of the mines as well. He threatens the family of the man who helped Flynn escape, and he tells them where Flynn was headed.\n\nAfter a ride on a honeymoon tour bus and several days' hiking across the [[Serengeti]], Flynn and Emily come upon a man buried up to his neck in sand for stealing. The two adventurers dig him out; Jomo ([[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]]) insists on being their guide. On a rest break, Flynn shows Emily the drawings he made as a child (his mother slipped them into his bag). Emily confides to Flynn her obsession since childhood with the mysterious [[Queen of Sheba]], wife of Solomon. He tells her how his father was shot and killed by a mugger when he was only 32. After days of hiking, they finally reach a village and recognize a local fortune teller's sign as a clue. Unknown to them, Samir's people have taken over the shop. Just as Flynn finds the other piece of the map legend, Emily sees the enemy coming; they flee.\n\nTo their amazement, they run into Flynn's Uncle Jerry, boarding a train for Mombasa. He hustles them aboard, feeds the pair, and tells Flynn that the amulet his father left him has been passed down through many generations. After dinner, Emily and Flynn talk about the Akon cypher's connection to the [[Song of Solomon]]; and discover the magical musical key to the map. Judson appears in the mirror and tells Flynn to fly home. He refuses. Next morning, they travel to Three Witches Mountain near [[Mombasa]]; the terrain reminds Flynn of his drawings. He realizes that his father must have been preparing him for this journey. With Samir in pursuit, they penetrate the caves. Treasure litters the caverns; a huge [[head]] of Queen Sheba, carved out of the stone wall, looms over all. Flynn spots a book on a pedestal, opens it, and realizes that this is the Key. The text glows and flows into his hand.\n\nSamir drags in a disheveled Uncle Jerry and beats him.  Flynn tosses General Samir the book but it is Uncle Jerry who thanks him. He shot Flynn's father because he refused to reveal the secret of the mine. Uncle Jerry wants to turn back time and win Margie Carsen for himself. Jerry enters a chamber lined with niches where dead kings lie, with a bubbling lava pit below, and reads aloud the [[incantation]] that will give him power over space and time, stirring up ghosts as he does so. Flynn and Emily are flung into a pit that fills with water. Flynn comes close to drowning and experiences a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Judson on a white beach, then finds that he and Emily are being rescued by the faithful Jomo, who has followed them to fulfill his life debt. Samir dies when Emily throws oil on him and it catches fire from the lighter he is holding.\n\nFlynn wrestles the book from Jerry, leaving the incantation unfinished. As Flynn is about to throw the book into the lava pit, Jerry tempts him: He can bring his father back.  Emily and Jomo burst into the cave to find Flynn uttering the incantation. Emily uses a spear to reflect light on Flynn's amulet, breaking the spell. When Flynn throws the book into the lava pit, Jerry leaps after it. Flynn, Emily, and Jomo flee as the cave crumbles and explodes..\n\nIn a brief epilogue, Flynn consigns the amulet and guardianship to Jomo. Emily pursues her search for the Queen of Sheba in Tunisia. Evoking ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Flynn murmurs \"Of all the gin joints in all the world, she had to walk into mine.\"\n\nFlynn returns to the Library and tells Judson that he destroyed the book. Judson reminds him that by giving up the chance of bringing his father back by destroying the book, Flynn sacrificed what he wanted \"for the greater good\", and was now a \"great librarian\". When Flynn asks Judson why he said nothing about his father's connection to the mines, Judson says Flynn had to learn this on his own; he is sure that wherever Flynn's father is, he is proud of his son\u2014and Judson is, too.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Noah Wyle]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Flynn Carsen .28Noah Wyle.29|Flynn Carsen]]\n* [[Gabrielle Anwar]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Emily Davenport .28Gabrielle Anwar.29|Emily Davenport]]\n* [[Bob Newhart]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Judson .28Bob Newhart.29|Judson]]\n* [[Jane Curtin]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Charlene .28Jane Curtin.29|Charlene]]\n* [[Olympia Dukakis]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#Margie Carsen .28Olympia Dukakis.29|Margie Carsen]]\n* [[Robert Foxworth]] as [[List of Characters in The Librarian franchise#.22Uncle.22 Jerry .28Robert Foxworth.29|\"Uncle\" Jerry]]\n* [[Erick Avari]] as General Samir\n* [[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]] as Jomo\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has four reviews listed, two are positive, and two are negative.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines (2006) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/librarian_return_to_king_solomons_mines |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\nDavid Cornelius of DVDTalk.com gave the film a rating of 3.5 out 5, and wrote: \"These movies are unabashedly fun, a breezy cocktail of dopey action and broad laughs.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= December 19, 2006 |author1=  David Cornelius |title= The Librarian - Return to King Solomon's Mines |url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/26120/librarian-return-to-king-solomons-mines-the/ |website= [[DVD Talk]] }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nThe film won '''Best Presentation on Television''' category at the [[33rd Saturn Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |date= 20 February 2007 |title= 'Superman Returns' Leads the 33rd Annual Saturn Awards with 10 Nominations |url= https://movieweb.com/superman-returns-leads-the-33rd-annual-saturn-awards-with-10-nominations/ |website= Movieweb }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date= 11 May 2007 |title= 'Superman' tops Saturns |url= https://variety.com/2007/digital/awards/superman-tops-saturns-1117964717/ |website= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0455596}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|621690}}\n* {{Amg movie|374547}}\n\n{{The Librarian}}\n{{Jonathan Frakes}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Librarian 2}}\n[[Category:The Librarian (franchise)|Return to King Solmon's Mines]]\n[[Category:Television sequel films]]\n[[Category:Treasure hunt films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jonathan Frakes]]\n[[Category:Adventure television films]]\n[[Category:2006 films]]"}]}}}}
