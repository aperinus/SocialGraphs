The film stars [[Paul Bettany]] as a journeyman [[tennis]] pro (once ranked 11th) and [[Kirsten Dunst]] as an up-and-coming tennis star. [[Sam Neill]] and [[Jon Favreau]] co-star.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Colt, a British professional tennis player in his thirties whose [[ATP rankings|ranking]] has slipped from 11th to 119th in the world, has never really had to fight for anything, as his wealthy family allowed him to easily pursue his tennis ambitions. Though he earns a [[Wild card (sports)|wildcard]] spot to the [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon tournament]], he feels it's time to admit he's getting too old to compete with fitter up-and-coming younger players and intends, after this last Wimbledon, to take a job with a prestigious tennis club.\n\nAs Wimbledon begins, he bumps into Lizzie Bradbury, the American rising star of female tennis. They fall in love and her interest in him changes his entire perception, even giving him the strength to win again. As their love grows, Peter's game becomes better and better. Lizzie's overprotective father-manager Dennis Bradbury is determined to nip their relationship in the bud, believing it detrimental to her career. One day, Dennis comes to Peter's old flat and yells at him for spoiling his daughter's game. Lizzie overhears this and decides to leave him and focus on her game.\n\nThe night before their semifinal matches, Peter sneaks into Lizzie's hotel room and persuades her to have sex. The next day, he performs above expectations  and wins in straight sets, but Lizzie loses. Lizzie angrily breaks up with Peter, claiming his selfishness made her lose, and decides to immediately return to the United States to train.\n\nPeter has to play the final match against Jake Hammond, an arrogant American star and world number 1. At the airport, Lizzie watches an interview on TV in which Peter apologizes and declares his love for her. She returns to Wimbledon.\n\nAs Lizzie reaches the stadium, Peter has lost two sets in the final and is behind in the third. When the game is suspended due to rain, Lizzie appears in the dressing room and forgives him. She tells him the secret of Jake's tricky serves and Peter fights back to win the title (3\u20136, 2\u20136, 6\u20134, 7\u20136<sup>(8-6)</sup>, 6\u20134). Now a national hero in Britain, he and Lizzie get married. With his support, Lizzie goes on to win the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] and Wimbledon twice, ultimately achieving her dreams. In the last scene, Peter is with their younger child, a boy, watching Lizzie and their elder child, a girl, playing tennis on a neighborhood court in New York City.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Peter Colt\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Lizzie Bradbury\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Dennis Bradbury\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Carl Colt\n* [[Bernard Hill]] as Edward Colt\n* [[Eleanor Bron]] as Augusta Colt\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Mrs Kenwood\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Dieter Prohl\n* [[Austin Nichols]] as Jake Hammond\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Ron Roth\n* Jonathan Timmins as the Ballboy\n* [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]] as Ian Frazier\n* [[Martin Wimbush]] as Court Official\n*[[Cecilia Dazzi]] as Billi Clementi\n\n;Real tennis professionals on set\n* [[Dominic Inglot]] as Paul Bettany's tennis double\n* Vikas Punna as Ajay Bhatt\n* [[Beti Sekulovski]] as Lizzie's first opponent\n* [[Murphy Jensen]] as Ivan Dragomir\n* [[Alun Jones (tennis)|Alun Jones]] as Tom Cavendish\n* Rebecca Dandeniya as Arliyia Rupesinghe\n* [[John McEnroe]] as Himself/Commentator\n* [[Chris Evert]] as Herself/Commentator\n* [[Mary Carillo]] as Herself/Commentator\n* [[John Barrett (tennis)|John Barrett]] as Himself/Commentator\n* [[Pat Cash]] was the tennis adviser on set and trained the actors.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nThe film is dedicated to [[Mark McCormack]], founder of [[IMG (company)|International Management Group]], a management firm for high-level athletes, who died on 16 May 2003.\n\n===Casting===\nThe film used locally recruited Wimbledon residents as extras for the crowd scenes.\n\n===Filming===\nThe actors served with real tennis balls.

That's kind of startling, in a world where movie characters, especially in sports movies, occupy the edge of human experience. What a surprise to hear conversation instead of dialogue, and to realize that the villain may actually be right some of the time\".
