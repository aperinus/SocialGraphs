Walt's young neighbor, [[List of Gran Torino characters#Thao Vang Lor|Thao Vang Lor]], is pressured by his cousin into trying to steal Walt's prized 1972 [[Ford Torino]] for his initiation into a gang. Walt thwarts the theft and subsequently develops a relationship with the boy and his family.\n\n''Gran Torino'' opened in a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States on December 12, 2008, before [[Wide release|expanding wide]] on January 9, 2009.<ref name=\"variety1\" /> It grossed $270 million worldwide, making it Eastwood's second highest-grossing film to-date.<ref name=\"BoxMojo\" /> The film received positive reviews from critics for Eastwood's direction and performance; within the Hmong community in the United States, the film was generally praised but also received criticism for its cultural inaccuracies.\n\n==Plot==\nCantankerous, bigoted [[Korean War]] veteran and retired [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory worker [[Walt Kowalski]] is widowed after 50 years of marriage. His aging neighborhood in [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] in [[Metro Detroit]] was formerly populated by working-class white families but has become filled with gang violence and poor southeast Asian immigrants, including Walt's next-door neighbors, the Vang Lor family. Adding to his isolation, Walt is emotionally detached from his family; he angrily rejects his son's suggestion he move to a retirement community and lives alone with his elderly [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]], Daisy. A chronic tobacco user, Walt suffers from coughing fits, occasionally with blood, which he conceals from his family. Walt's late wife's priest, Father Janovich, tries to comfort Walt, who dismisses him as young and inexperienced.\n\nWalt catches [[Thao Vang Lor]] attempting to steal his [[Ford Torino]] as a coerced initiation into a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] gang run by Thao's cousin, \"Spider.\" Even after this failed attempt the gang nonetheless wants to take Thao with them, but Walt drives them off with his [[M1 Garand]], earning the Hmong community's respect. As penance, Thao's mother makes him work for Walt, who has him do different jobs in the neighborhood. The two soon form a grudging mutual respect, and Walt mentors Thao, helping him obtain a construction job and giving him social and dating advice. Walt rescues Thao's sister, Sue, from the unwanted advances of three rough youth and bonds with her as well. Walt consults his doctor, who gives him a gloomy prognosis that he conceals from his family.\n\nSpider's gang continues to pressure Thao and assaults him on his way home from work. Walt visits the gang's house and attacks a member as a warning. In retaliation, the gang rapes Sue and injures Thao in a [[drive-by shooting]]. The members of the community, including Sue, refuse to report the crimes out of fear. The following day, an enraged Thao seeks Walt's help to exact revenge; Walt convinces him to return later that day. Walt makes personal preparations: He mows his lawn, buys a suit, gets a haircut and finally makes his [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to Father Janovich.\n\nWalt takes Thao to his basement and gives him his [[Silver Star]], then tells him that he is still haunted by the memory of killing an enemy soldier who was ready to surrender and that he wants to spare Thao from becoming a killer. He locks Thao in the basement and heads to the gang's residence. The gang members point their guns at Walt, who loudly berates them for their crimes, drawing the attention of the neighbors. Walt puts a cigarette in his mouth, slowly reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls his hand out quickly, as if he were drawing a gun. Thinking he is about to fire, the gang members shoot and kill him. Walt's hand opens to reveal his [[Zippo]] lighter with [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|First Cavalry]] insignia \u2014\u00a0he was unarmed and sacrificed himself to save the Vang Lor family. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino.\n\nA police officer tells Thao and Sue that the gang members have been arrested for murder and the surrounding neighbors have all come forward as witnesses. Father Janovich conducts Walt's funeral, which is attended by his family and many of the Hmong community, puzzling his family. Afterward, Walt's [[last will and testament]] is read. Much to the surprise of Walt's family, Walt leaves his house to the church and his cherished Gran Torino to Thao, on the condition that Thao does not modify the car in any way. Sometime later, Thao drives the car along [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Detroit's Jefferson Avenue]] with Daisy at his side.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Gran Torino characters}}\n{{cast list|\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Walt Kowalski]]\n* [[Bee Vang]] as Thao Vang Lor, a young Hmong teenager\n* [[Ahney Her]] as Sue Lor, Thao's older sister\n* [[Christopher Carley]] as Father Janovich\n* [[Doua Moua]] as Fong \"Spider,\" Thao's cousin and the main [[antagonist]]\n* Sonny Vue as Smokie, Spider's right-hand man\n* Elvis Thao as Hmong Gangbanger No. 1\n* [[Brian Haley]] as Mitch Kowalski, Walt's older son\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Steve Kowalski, Walt's younger son\n* [[Geraldine Hughes]] as Karen Kowalski, Mitch's wife\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as Ashley Kowalski, Mitch and Karen's daughter\n* Michael E.
