He resides in [[London]], the capital city of the territory of [[Airstrip One]], formerly England, and works in a small office cubicle at the [[Ministry of Truth]], rewriting history as dictated by [[Ingsoc|the Party]] and its supreme leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who never appears publicly but instead appears only on propaganda posters, advertising billboards, and television monitors. He also occasionally attends public rallies at Victory Square where the citizens are shown propaganda films of the current war situation as well as contradictory and false news stories about Oceania's war effort to unite the civilized world under Big Brother's rule. While his co-worker and neighbor, Parsons, seems content to follow the state's laws, Winston, haunted by painful childhood memories and restless carnal desires, keeps a secret diary of his private thoughts, thus creating evidence of his [[thoughtcrime]]. However, he tries to do it undercover of the telescreens, to maintain his safety.\n\nHis life greatly changes when he is accosted by fellow Outer Party worker [[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]], a mysterious, bold-looking, sensual, and free-spirited young woman who works as a print machine mechanic in the Ministry of Truth, and they begin an illicit affair. During their first meeting in the remote countryside, they exchange subversive ideas before having sex. Shortly after, Winston rents a room above a [[pawn shop]] in the less restrictive proletarian area where they continue their liaison. Julia procures [[contraband]] food and clothing on the black market, and for a brief few months they secretly meet and enjoy an idyllic life of relative freedom and contentment together.\n\nTheir affair comes to an end one evening, when the Thought Police suddenly raid the flat and arrest them both. It is later revealed that a [[telescreen]] hidden behind a picture on the wall in their room recorded their transgressions and that the elderly proprietor of the pawn shop, Mr. Charrington, is a covert agent of the Thought Police. Winston and Julia are taken away to the [[Ministry of Love]] to be detained, questioned and \"rehabilitated\" separately. There [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], a high-ranking member of the Inner Party whom Winston had previously believed to be a fellow thoughtcriminal and agent of the resistance movement led by the Party's archenemy, [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], systematically tortures him.\n\nO'Brien instructs Winston about the state's true purpose and schools him in a kind of [[catechism]] on the principles of ''[[doublethink]]''{{snd}}the practice of holding two contradictory thoughts in the mind simultaneously. For his final rehabilitation, Winston is brought to [[Room 101]], where O'Brien tells him he will be subjected to the \"worst thing in the world\", designed specifically around Smith's personal phobias. When confronted with this unbearable horror{{snd}}a cage filled with wild rats{{snd}}Winston's psychological resistance finally and irretrievably breaks down, and he hysterically repudiates his allegiance to Julia. Now completely subjugated and purged of any rebellious thoughts, impulses, or personal attachments, Winston is restored to physical health and released.\n\nWinston returns to the Chestnut Tree Caf\u00e9, where he had previously seen the rehabilitated thoughtcriminals Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford (themselves once prominent but later disgraced members of the Inner Party) who have since been \"vaporized\" and rendered [[List of Newspeak words#Unperson|unpersons]]. While sitting at the chess table, Winston is approached by Julia, who was similarly \"rehabilitated\". They share a bottle of Victory Gin and impassively exchange a few words about how they have betrayed each other. After she leaves, Winston watches a broadcast of himself on the large telescreen humbly and remorsefully confessing his \"crimes\" against the state and imploring forgiveness from the populace.\n\nUpon hearing a news report declaring the Oceanian army's utter rout of [[Political geography of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eurasia and Eastasia|Eurasia]]'s forces in North Africa, Winston, having been deprived of his freedom to think and feel for himself and reduced to a mere shell of a man, and soon to be deprived of his very physical existence as well, looks at the still image of Big Brother that appears on the telescreen, then turns away with tears in his eyes as the words \"I love you\" are heard whispered in his voice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Winston Smith (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Winston Smith]]\n** Rupert Baderman as Young Winston Smith\n* [[Richard Burton]] as [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]]\n* [[Suzanna Hamilton]] as [[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]]\n* [[Cyril Cusack]] as Mr. Charrington\n* [[Gregor Fisher]] as Parsons\n* [[James Walker (actor)|James Walker]] as [[Syme (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Syme]]\n* [[Andrew Wilde (actor)|Andrew Wilde]] as Tillotson\n* Merelina Kendall as Mrs. Parsons\n* [[John Boswall]] as [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]\n* [[Phyllis Logan]] as Telescreen Announcer (voice)\n* [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] as Waiter\n* Bob Flag as [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] (only as a [[still image]])\n* [[Pam Gems]] as the Washerwoman\n* [[Pip Donaghy]] as Inner Party Speaker\n* [[Janet Key]] as the Instructress \n* [[Hugh Walters (actor)|Hugh Walters]] as Artsem Lecturer\n* [[Shirley Stelfox]] as the Prostitute\n* Corinna Seddon as Winston's Mother\n* Martha Parsey as Winston's Sister\n* [[Matthew Scurfield]] and [[Garry Cooper]] as Guards\n* [[Rolf Saxon]] as Patrolman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn winter 1983, the director [[Michael Radford]] asked his producer to try to obtain the rights to Orwell's novel, with low expectations that they were available.

The pawnshop exterior, a pub scene and a scene with a prostitute were filmed in [[Cheshire Street]], in London's East End, an area Orwell had visited and commented on in his first book, ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]''. The canteen interiors were filmed in a disused grain mill at Silvertown. In contrast, the idyllic, dreamlike \"Golden Country\", where Winston and Julia repair for their first tryst and which recurs in Winston's fantasies, was filmed in the southwest county of [[Wiltshire]] at a natural circle of hills called \"Roundway\", near the town of [[Devizes]].

Instead, Deakins used a film [[film processing|processing technique]] called [[bleach bypass]] (originally created by Technicolor and Deluxe, but recreated for this production by Key) to create the distinctive washed-out look of the film's colour visuals. The film is a very rare example of the technique being applied to every release print, rather than the [[interpositive]], that was struck from the [[original camera negative]], or the internegative (struck from the interpositive); as the silver is retained in the print and cannot be reclaimed by the lab, the cost is higher, but the retained silver gives a \"depth\" to the projected image.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' made its theatrical debut on 10 October in [[London]] and on 14 December in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803/|title=1984|date=22 March 1985|via=IMDb|access-date=28 June 2018|archive-date=9 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709183100/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803/|url-status=live}}</ref> It was released in the United States for one week in December 1984 at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre|Egyptian Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] to qualify for the [[57th Academy Awards|1984 Academy Awards]] and grossed a house record $62,121, despite stormy weather.<ref name=hv>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|title=IVE Pays $2 Mil For Homevideo Rights To '1984'|page=1|date=21 December 1984|last=Bierbaum|first=Tom}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film was \"admirable, bleakly beautiful\", although \"not an easy film to watch\".<ref name=\"canby\">{{cite web| title= The Screen: John Hurt in ''1984'', Adaptation of Orwell Novel| url= https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DEEDD143BF93BA25752C0A963948260| first= Vincent| last= Canby| author-link= Vincent Canby| date= 18 January 1985| work= The New York Times| access-date= 5 August 2014| archive-date= 8 March 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180308150831/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DEEDD143BF93BA25752C0A963948260| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film 3.5/4 stars, writing that it \"penetrates much more deeply into the novel's heart of darkness\" than previous adaptations, and describing Hurt as \"the perfect Winston Smith\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/1984-1984| title= 1984 (1984)| first= Roger| last= Ebert| author-link= Roger Ebert| publisher= rogerebert.com| date= 1 February 1985| access-date= 5 August 2014| archive-date= 9 August 2014| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140809193351/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/1984-1984| url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] has given the film a 72% approval rating, based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10.

One Eurythmics song, \"[[Julia (Eurythmics song)|Julia]]\", was also heard in its entirety during the film's closing credits. However, Muldowney's main theme music (particularly the state anthem, \"Oceania, 'tis for thee\") was still prominently used in the film.\n\nIn November 1984, Virgin Records released the Eurythmics soundtrack album, containing considerably altered versions of their music heard in the film, under the title ''[[1984 (For the Love of Big Brother)]]''. The album reached number 23 on the UK Album Chart, and was later certified Gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.<ref name=\"BPI\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |title=British Phonographic Industry online database |access-date=11 May 2013 |archive-date=24 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124005813/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> A song from the album, \"[[Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four) (Eurythmics song)|Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four)]]\", was released as a single just prior to the album and became one of Eurythmics' biggest hits, peaking at number 4 and was awarded a Silver disc for sales in excess of 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"BPI\"/> The music video for the single made use of clips from the film. The track \"Julia\" was also released as a single which peaked just outside the Top 40.\n\nRadford disowned Virgin's edit of the film containing the mixed Eurythmics/Muldowney score and, during his acceptance speech at the [[Evening Standard British Film Awards|''Evening Standard'' British Film Awards]], expressed his displeasure at Virgin's \"foisting\" the Eurythmics music on his film.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Radford withdrew the film from consideration at the [[BAFTA|BAFTA awards]] in protest of Virgin's decision to change the musical score. Eurythmics responded with a statement of their own claiming no knowledge of prior agreements between Virgin and Radford/Muldowney and that they had accepted the offer to compose music for the film in good faith.\n\nIn 1999, Muldowney's complete orchestral score (24 tracks in total) was released on a special limited edition [[CD]] album under the title ''Nineteen Eighty-Four: The Music of Oceania'', to commemorate the film's 15th anniversary. The CD booklet featured previously unseen production photographs and artwork as well as liner notes by Radford.\n\nAs of today, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer owns the film's rights worldwide since they own both the Atlantic Releasing Corporation and the Virgin Films catalogues, and on their DVD release in [[North America]] in 2003, the film's colour is restored to a normal level of saturation and the Eurythmics contributions to the score were removed entirely and replaced with Muldowney's musical cues as Radford had originally intended\u2014although both Eurythmics and Muldowney are still jointly credited in the opening and closing titles. This DVD release was quickly discontinued and currently remains out of print. This version had previously been shown by [[Channel 4]] in the UK in the late 1980s. However, while the MGM DVD release of the film in the [[UK]] in 2004 features the desaturated visuals, it has the mixed Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtrack on the [[English language|English-]] and [[French-language]] audio tracks, but the purely Muldowney soundtrack on the [[German language|German-]] and [[Spanish-language]] audio tracks.\n\nIn 2013 the film was re-released on DVD in North America by TGG Direct on a double feature with ''[[Megaville]]'' (1990), under licence from MGM. This DVD release also features the original mix of Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtracks, as well as the theatrical desaturated colour palette. In 2015 the film was released on Blu-ray in North America by Twilight Time in a limited 3,000 copy run, again, licensed by MGM. This release features the Eurythmics/Muldowney Soundtrack on one audio channel and Muldowney's orchestral score on another, as well as keeping true to the original colour scheme.\n\nThe version of the film which has been released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] services is the 2015 HD edition. It is available only with the original Eurythmics/Muldowney soundtrack.\n\nThe 2019 [[Criterion Collection]] release of the film contains both the Eurythmics soundtrack and the original score composed by Dominic Muldowney.\n\n==Awards==\nThe film won the Best British Film of the Year award at the [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]].\nIt also won The [[Golden Tulip Award]] at the 1985 [[Istanbul International Film Festival]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Home media==\n[[International Video Entertainment]] paid $2 million for North American [[home video]] rights, the fifth biggest deal ever at the time.<ref name=hv/> Their VHS release came out in 1985.

TGG Direct re-released the movie on DVD in 2013 as a double feature with Megaville.

All later home video copies of the film in the United States contain the score done by Eurythmics and Dominic Muldowney, rather than just the latter.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949 English novel by George Orwell)\n* [[1984 (Westinghouse Studio One)|''1984'' (Westinghouse Studio One)]] 1953 US television version\n* ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four (UK TV programme)|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1954 [[BBC]] television adaptation)\n* ''[[1984 (1956 film)|1984]]'' (1956 film version)\n* ''[[1984 (opera)|1984]]'' (opera)\n* [[1984 (advertisement)|\"1984\" (advertisement)]] for the Apple Macintosh\n* ''[[Equals (film)|Equals]]'' (2015 film)\n* ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', which was released a few months later (and during production was initially known as ''1984 and a \u00bd'')<ref>{{cite web| title= Since when was Orwell's 1984 a love story?| date= 18 January 2014| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10580163/Since-when-was-Orwells-1984-a-love-story.html| publisher= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]| first= Anne| last= Billson| access-date= 5 August 2014| archive-date= 15 February 2018| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180215154324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10580163/Since-when-was-Orwells-1984-a-love-story.html| url-status= live}}</ref>\n* [[List of films featuring surveillance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Nineteen Eighty-Four (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0087803|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n* {{mojo title|1984|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1984_1984|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n* [http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//ITN/1984/10/08/AS081084012/ Behind the scenes of \"''1984''\" starring John Hurt and Richard Burton], [[ITN Source]], 8 October 1984\n* [http://film.virtual-history.com/film.php?filmid=455 Movie stills] from film.virtual-history.com\n\n<!--Split film/book article intentional - Please do not remove this comment-->\n\n{{Michael Radford}}\n{{Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n[[Category:Films based on Nineteen Eighty-Four]]\n[[Category:1984 films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s dystopian films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Radford]]\n[[Category:Dystopian films]]\n[[Category:British post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:Films about freedom of expression]]\n[[Category:Films about security and surveillance]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in a fictional country]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s political drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s political thriller films]]\n[[Category:Atlantic Entertainment Group films]]\n[[Category:Films about mass surveillance]]\n[[Category:1984 independent films]]\n[[Category:1984 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about media manipulation]]\n[[Category:Films about censorship]]\n[[Category:1980s British films]]"}]}}}}
