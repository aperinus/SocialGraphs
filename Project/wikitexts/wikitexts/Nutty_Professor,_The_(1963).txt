The film also co-stars [[Stella Stevens]], [[Del Moore]], [[Kathleen Freeman]], [[Howard Morris]], and [[Elvia Allman]]. The score was composed by [[Walter Scharf]]. A parody of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1886 novella ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', it follows bullied scientist Julius Kelp as he creates a serum that transforms him into a handsome man, which he subsequently uses under his alter ego Buddy Love.\n\n''The Nutty Professor'' has been described as perhaps the finest and most memorable film of Lewis's career.<ref>In his review of the 1996 remake of ''The Nutty Professor'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote: \"The movie [the 1996 remake] is inspired by a 1963 Jerry Lewis comedy, said by some to be Lewis' best, in which Jerry played a mild-mannered chemistry professor whose secret formula allowed him to transform himself into an obnoxious lounge lizard named Buddy Love.\"[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-nutty-professor-1996]</ref> In 2004, ''The Nutty Professor'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|A remake]] was released in 1996, starring [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Jada Pinkett-Smith]], directed by [[Tom Shadyac]]. A sequel, ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', followed in 2000, and an [[The Nutty Professor (2008 film)|animated sequel]] to the 1963 film was released in 2008. Lewis directed a musical theatre version in 2012. A new version of the musical, featuring the last score by [[Marvin Hamlisch]], book and lyrics by [[Rupert Holmes]] and direction by Marc Bruni, will be staged from July 1 to August 6, 2022 at the [[Ogunquit Playhouse]] in Ogunquit, Maine.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://deadline.com/2022/01/the-nutty-professor-mr-hollands-opus-stage-musical-adaptation-ogunquit-playhouse-regional-theater-1234920089/ | title='The Nutty Professor' and 'Mr. Holland's Opus' Set for Regional Stage Musical Adaptations | date=January 26, 2022 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nProfessor Julius Kelp is a [[nerd]]y, scruffy, [[Malocclusion|buck-toothed]], accident-prone, socially awkward university professor whose experiments in the classroom laboratory are unsuccessful and highly destructive. When a football-playing bully embarrasses and attacks him, Kelp decides to \"beef up\" by joining a local gym. Kelp's lack of physical strength leads him to seek a solution in his specialty of [[chemistry]]. He invents a serum that turns him into Buddy Love: a handsome, suave, charming and brash [[Lothario|girl-chasing]] hipster.\n\nThis new personality gives him the self-confidence to pursue one of his students, Stella Purdy. Although she resents Love, she finds herself strangely attracted to him. Buddy wows the crowd with his jazzy, breezy musical delivery and poised demeanor at the Purple Pit, a nightclub where the students hang out. He also mocks a bartender and waitress and punches a student. The formula wears off at inopportune times, often to Kelp's humiliation.\n\nAlthough Kelp knows that his alternate persona is a bad person, he cannot prevent himself from continually taking the formula as he enjoys the attention that Love receives. As Buddy performs at the annual student dance the formula starts to wear off. His real identity now revealed, Kelp gives an impassioned speech, admitting his mistakes and seeking forgiveness. Kelp says that the one thing he learned from being someone else is that if you don't like yourself, you can't expect others to like you. Purdy meets Kelp backstage, and confesses that she prefers Kelp over Buddy Love.\n\nEventually, Kelp's formerly timid father chooses to market the formula (a copy of which Kelp had sent to his parents' home for safekeeping), endorsed by the [[deadpan]] president of the university who proclaims, \"It's a gasser!\" Kelp's father makes a pitch to the chemistry class, and the students all rush forward to buy the new tonic. In the confusion Kelp and Purdy slip out of the class. Armed with a marriage license and two bottles of the formula, they elope.\n\nDuring the short closing credits, each of the characters comes out and bows down to the camera, and when Jerry Lewis, still portraying Kelp, comes out and bows, he trips and falls over the camera, causing the picture to go white, as if Lewis broke the film being projected at that moment.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Nutty Professor 1963 (publicity photo, Lewis and Stevens - cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Stella Stevens]] in ''The Nutty Professor'']]\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Jerry Lewis]] as Professor Julius F.

Lewis, however, consistently denied this rumor. In his 1982 autobiography and again in a DVD featurette entitled ''The Nutty Professor: Making The Formula'', Lewis stated that the character was based on every obnoxious, self-important, hateful hipster he ever knew. In the DVD commentary, Lewis speculates that he perhaps should have made Love more evil rather than simply obnoxious \u2014 since to his surprise more fan mail came for Love than for the professor. Film critic [[Danny Peary]] made the claim in his 1981 book ''Cult Movies'' that the character of Love is actually a representation of a dark side of Lewis's real personality. Lewis stated that the two represented good and evil.<ref>''The Nutty Professor'', Special Edition, commentary.</ref>\n\nThe character of [[Professor Frink]] from the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' loosely borrows many of his mannerisms and technique from Lewis' delivery of the Julius Kelp character, as well as the transition to a Buddy Love version of Frink in several episodes. In the episode [[Treehouse of Horror XIV]], the character of Frink's father was voiced by Lewis.\n\n==Production==\nThe entire production was filmed from October 9 to December 17, 1962, mostly on the campus of [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona]]. The cast's costumes were designed by [[Edith Head]].\n\n[[Walter Scharf]]'s score makes extensive use of the [[Victor Young]] jazz standard ''[[Stella by Starlight]]'' including an upbeat version over the film's main titles. Paramount was the copyright holder of the theme from its original appearance in ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]'' (1944). [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]] and his Band of Renown play themselves in the extended senior prom scenes.\n\nLove instructs the bartender to make an Alaskan Polar Bear Heater, \"mix it nice\" and pour it into a tall glass. The bartender asks if he can take a sip; after doing so, he freezes like a statue. While the drink started as fictional, it is now listed on some cocktail websites.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cocktail Alaskan Polar Bear Heater |url=http://kitchen.apartmenttherapy.com/food/the-celluloid-pantry/the-celluloid-pantry-alaskan-polar-bear-heaters-and-the-nutty-professor-1963-012171 |website=The Celluloid Pantry- apartmenttherapy.com |access-date=November 7, 2007 |archive-date=November 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123041337/http://kitchen.apartmenttherapy.com/food/the-celluloid-pantry/the-celluloid-pantry-alaskan-polar-bear-heaters-and-the-nutty-professor-1963-012171 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cherrycapri.com/things_cocktails.php|title= Cherry Capri's Cocktail Recipes|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071030032439/http://www.cherrycapri.com/things_cocktails.php|archive-date= October 30, 2007|df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.idrink.com/v.html?id=4051|title= Alaskan Polar Bear Heater|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071029081747/http://www.idrink.com/v.html?id=4051|archive-date= October 29, 2007|df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Product placement]] of RC Cola is noticeable throughout the film in the form of soda bottles, vending machines and even a delivery truck. Lewis was then under contract as a celebrity endorsement for the soft drink.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an 81% rating based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Nutty Professor (1963) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_nutty_professor |website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn 2000, the [[American Film Institute]] placed the film on its ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]'' list, where it was ranked No. 99.<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the [[National Film Preservation Board|National Film Preservation Board, USA]] included it among the 25 Films Inducted into the [[Library of Congress]] for the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n''The Nutty Professor'' was released on [[DVD]] in October 2000. In October 2004, a \"Special Edition\" was released including an [[audio commentary]] by Lewis and Steve Lawrence, a documentary and a short feature. In the commentary, Lewis discusses aspects of production, including his creating a real-time, on-camera monitor, which subsequently became standard in the film industry, known as [[video assist]]. He mentions that he recut the film for his own home viewing. He also identifies scenes that he would have liked to redo; for example, making the professor's watch sound tinny.\n\nThe DVD of the film contains a long [[deleted scene]] in which Kelp's love interest is portrayed as a sultry siren whose choreographed, jaw-dropping entrance to the Purple Pit, accompanied by jazz music, contrasts with the final edit in which she is portrayed as smart but fairly unassuming.\n\n''The Nutty Professor'' received a \"50th anniversary\" [[Blu-ray]] release in June 2014 as an \"Ultimate Collector's Edition\" set. This release included all the bonus features from the previous DVD release, a new documentary short, ''Jerry Lewis: No Apologies'', and three additional Jerry Lewis films on DVD. A disc-only release followed in September 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |date=3 June 2014 |title=The Nutty Professor Blu-ray Release Date June 3, 2014 |url=https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Nutty-Professor-Blu-ray/95097/ |access-date=18 June 2021 |website=Blu-ray.com}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\nLewis had for decades talked about doing a sequel and eventually settled for [[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|the 1996 remake]] starring [[Eddie Murphy]], for which Lewis was credited as a producer. The 1996 version did produce a sequel of its own, ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]''.\n\nAn [[Animation|animated]] [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] [[sequel]], also titled ''[[The Nutty Professor (2008 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', featured the voices of Lewis and [[Drake Bell]] and was released on November 25, 2008. Directed by Paul Taylor, the film involves Julius Kelp's teenage grandson Harold discovering his grandfather's secret formula and unleashing his own alter ego.\n\n==In other media==\n===Musical adaptation===\nA musical comedy adaptation ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] after a tryout production that opened at the Nashville [[Tennessee Performing Arts Center]] from July to August 2012. Lewis directed the musical, with choreography by Joann M. Hunter.  The musical has a book and lyrics written by [[Rupert Holmes]] and music composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]], with scenery by [[David Gallo]] and costumes by [[Ann Hould-Ward]].<ref>Jones, Kenneth.
