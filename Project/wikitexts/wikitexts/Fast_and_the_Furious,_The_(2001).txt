It is the first installment in the ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' franchise, and stars [[Paul Walker]] as [[Brian O'Conner]] and [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Dominic Toretto]], with [[Michelle Rodriguez]] and [[Jordana Brewster]] in supporting roles. In the film, a recent spate of truck hijackings causes O'Conner, a police officer, to go undercover and befriend Toretto, a local street racer, to investigate the matter.\n\n''The Fast and the Furious'' entered development in late 1998, after Cohen and producer [[Neal H.

It premiered at [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Mann Village Theatre]] in Los Angeles on June 18, 2001, and was theatrically released in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]] on June 22. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism for its screenplay and characterization, but praise for the action sequences and Walker and Diesel's performances, considered their [[breakthrough role]]s. ''The Fast and the Furious'' was a commercial success, grossing $207 million worldwide, making it the [[2001 in film|19th highest-grossing film of 2001]]. It was followed by the sequel film ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003).\n\n== Plot ==\nOn a deserted highway, a heist crew driving three modified [[Honda Civic (fifth generation)#Coupe|Honda Civics]] assault a truck carrying electronic goods, steal its cargo, and escape into the night. The following day, a joint [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) and FBI task force sends LAPD officer [[Brian O'Conner]] undercover to locate the crew. He begins his investigation at Toretto's Market and flirts with its owner Mia, sister of the infamous street racer [[Dominic Toretto]], while Dominic sits in the back office reading a newspaper. Dominic's crew\u2014Vince, Leon, Jesse, and Dom's girlfriend Letty\u2014arrives. Vince, who has a crush on Mia, starts a fight with Brian until Dominic intervenes.\n\nThat night, Brian brings a modified [[Mitsubishi Eclipse#Second generation (2G, 1995\u20131999)|1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse]] to an illegal street race, hoping to find a lead on the thieves. Dominic arrives in his [[Mazda RX-7#FD|Mazda RX-7]] and initiates a drag race between himself, Brian and two other drivers. Lacking funds, Brian is forced to wager his car. Dominic wins the race after Brian's car malfunctions, but the LAPD arrive before Dom can take the vehicle. Brian helps Dominic escape in the Eclipse, but they accidentally venture into the territory of Dominic's old racing rival, gang leader Johnny Tran and his cousin Lance Nguyen, who destroy the Eclipse. After returning to safety, Dominic reiterates that Brian still owes him a \"10 second car\".\n\nBrian brings a damaged [[Toyota Supra#A80|1994 Toyota Supra]] to Dominic's garage as a replacement. Dominic and his crew begin the long process of restoring the vehicle, and Brian starts dating Mia. He also begins investigating Tran, convinced that he is the mastermind behind the truck hijackings. While investigating one garage at night, Brian is discovered by Dominic and Vince. Brian convinces them that he is researching his opponents' vehicles for the upcoming desert [[Race Wars (The Fast and the Furious)|Race Wars]]. Together, the trio investigate Tran's garage, discovering a large quantity of electronic goods.\n\nBrian reports the discovery to his superiors and Tran and Lance are arrested. The electronics are proved to have been purchased legally, and Brian is forced to confront his suspicion that Dominic is the true mastermind. Brian is given 36 hours to find the heist crew, as the truckers are now arming themselves to defend against the hijackings. The following day, Dominic and Brian attend Race Wars. There, Jesse wagers his father's MK3 [[Volkswagen Jetta#Mk3|Volkswagen Jetta]] against Tran in his [[Honda S2000]], but flees with the car after he loses. Tran accuses Dominic of reporting him to the police, causing Dominic to attack him. After security guards break up the fight, Tran demands Dominic recover the vehicle.\n\nThat night, Brian witnesses Dominic and his crew leaving and realizes they are the hijackers. He reveals his true identity to Mia and convinces her to help him find the crew. Dominic, Letty, Vince, and Leon attack a semi-trailer truck, intending it to be their final heist. The armed driver shoots Vince and runs Letty off the road. Brian arrives with Mia and rescues Vince. He is forced to reveal his identity to call in emergency medical care to save Vince. Dominic, Mia and the rest of the crew leave before the authorities can arrive.\n\nSome time later, Brian arrives at Dominic's house to apprehend him as Dominic is getting his father's [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#1970|1970 Dodge Charger R/T]] out of the garage. He demands Brian leave, since he is not running, but rather going to rescue Jesse who has no one else to look after him. Jesse suddenly arrives at the house and pleads for protection. Tran and Lance perform a [[drive-by shooting]] on motorcycles, killing Jesse. Brian and Dominic give chase in their separate vehicles, finding and killing Tran and injuring Lance. Brian then pursues Dominic, with them both eventually acquiescing to a quarter-mile drag race. The pair barely cross a railroad before a train passes, which ends the race in a draw, but Dominic crashes his car into a truck. Instead of arresting him, Brian gives Dominic the keys to his own car, asserting that he still owes him a 10-second car from their first race. Dominic leaves in the Supra as Brian walks away.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Dominic is seen driving through [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]], in a 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] SS.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | align  = right\n   | footer = [[Paul Walker]] (''left'') in 2009, [[Vin Diesel]] in 2013, and [[Michelle Rodriguez]] in 2018\n   | image1 = PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg\n   | width1 = 147\n   | image2 = Vin Diesel by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n   | width2 = 175\n   | image3 = Michelle Rodriguez Cannes 2018 cropped.jpg\n   | width3 = 151\n   | alt = \n}}\n{{Further|List of Fast & Furious characters}} \n* [[Paul Walker]] as [[Brian O'Conner]]:<br/>An LAPD officer sent to infiltrate a crew of hijackers.

Olyphant, however, who had starred in the previous year's car-themed blockbuster ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'', declined the role. Moritz instead suggested [[Vin Diesel]], who had to be convinced to take the role even though he had only played supporting roles up to that point.<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\"/> The role of Mia Toretto was originally written for [[Eliza Dushku]], who turned down the role and [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Natalie Portman]] auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot in various locations within [[Los Angeles]] and parts of southern [[California]], from June 29, to October 25, 2000. Key locations included [[Dodger Stadium]] (on the opening scene where Brian tests his Eclipse on the parking lot), [[Angelino Heights, Los Angeles, California|Angelino Heights]], [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] and [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]] (the neighborhoods around Toretto's home), as well as [[Little Saigon, Orange County|Little Saigon]] (where Tran destroys the Eclipse) and the [[San Bernardino International Airport]] (the venue for ''Race Wars'', which attracted over 1,500 import car owners and enthusiasts).<ref name=\"Cinema.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.com/articles/594/fast-and-the-furious-the-production-notes.phtml|title=Fast and the Furious, The : Production Notes|website=www.cinema.com|access-date=4 May 2017}}</ref> The entire last rig heist scene was filmed along Domenigoni Parkway on the southern side of [[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]]/[[Hemet, California|Hemet]] in the [[San Jacinto Valley]] near [[Diamond Valley Lake]].\n\nPrior to filming, both [[Jordana Brewster]] and [[Michelle Rodriguez]] did not have driver's licenses, so they took driving lessons during production. For the climactic race scene between Brian and Toretto, separate shots of both cars crossing the railroad and the train crossing the street were filmed, then composited together to give the illusion of the train narrowly missing the cars. A long steel rod was used as a ramp for Toretto's car to crash through the semi-truck and fly in mid-air.\n\nAn alternate ending titled \"More than Furious\" was filmed, in which Tanner drops Brian off at the Toretto home, where he encounters Mia packing, intending to move away. Brian reveals that he resigned from the LAPD, who let him go quietly, and that he wants another chance with her. When Mia tells him that it's not going to be that simple, Brian tells her that he's got time. This ending was released in the collection bundle DVD version.\n\nDuring the filming of the movie, seventy-eight cars were wrecked both on and off-screen.  Out of the seventy-eight cars, three cars were shown being destroyed in the film's trailer alone.\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Jamie |title=How many cars has the Fast and Furious franchise destroyed? |url=https://www.confused.com/car-insurance/how-many-cars-has-fast-furious-wrecked |website=Confused.com |publisher=Confused.com |access-date=12 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|The Fast and the Furious (soundtrack)|More Fast and Furious}}\nThe film's score was composed by music producer [[BT (musician)|BT]], mixing [[electronica]] with [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Industrial music|industrial]] influences.
