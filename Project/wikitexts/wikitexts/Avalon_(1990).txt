It is the third in Levinson's [[semi-autobiographical]] tetralogy of \"Baltimore films\" set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s: ''[[Diner (1982 film)|Diner]]'' (1982), ''[[Tin Men]]'' (1987), and ''[[Liberty Heights]]'' (1999).<ref name=NYT2>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 14, 1999|title=Barry Levinson: Baltimore, My Baltimore|author=Levinson, Barry|author-link=Barry Levinson|url=https://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/111499levinson-film.html}}</ref> The film explores the themes of [[Jewish assimilation]] into American life, through several generations of a Polish immigrant family from the 1910s through the 1950s.\n\nThe film was released to critical acclaim, and was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] and three [[Golden Globe Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the late 1940s and early 1950s, and much has happened to the family of [[Polish-Jewish|Polish Jewish]] [[immigration|immigrant]] Sam Krichinsky since he first arrived in America in 1914 and eventually settled in [[Baltimore]].\n\nTelevision is new. Neighborhoods are changing, with more and more families moving to the suburbs. Wallpaper has been Sam's profession, but his son Jules wants to try his hand at opening a large discount-appliance store with his cousin, Izzy, maybe even do their own commercials on TV.\n\nJules and his wife, Ann, still live with his parents, but Ann is quietly enduring the way that her opinionated mother-in-law Eva dominates the household. Ann is a modern woman who even learns to drive a car, although Eva refuses to ride with her and takes a streetcar instead.\n\nThe family contributes to a fund to bring more relatives to America. Slights, real or imagined, concern the family, as when Jules and Ann finally move to the suburbs, a long way for their relatives to travel. After arriving late and finding a Thanksgiving turkey has been carved without him, Uncle Gabriel is offended and storms out, beginning a feud with Sam.\n\nSam also cannot understand the methods his grandson Michael's teachers use in school, or why Jules and Izzy have changed their surnames to Kaye and Kirk as they launch their business careers. But when various crises develop, including an armed holdup and a devastating fire, the family gets through the problems together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Sam Krichinsky\n** Michael Krauss as young Sam\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Jules Kaye\n** Kevin Blum as young Jules\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as Ann Kaye\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Eva Krichinsky\n** Dawne Hindle as young Eva\n* [[Leo Fuchs]] as Hymie Krichinsky\n** Bernard Hiller as young Bernard\n* [[Lou Jacobi]] as Gabriel Krichinsky\n** Michael Edelstein as young Gabriel\n* [[Eve Gordon]] as Dottie Kirk\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Izzy Kirk\n* Israel Rubinek as Nathan Krichinsky\n** Brian Shait as young Nathan\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Michael Kaye\n** [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]] as Michael Kaye as adult\n* Grant Gelt as Teddy Kirk\n* Mindy Loren Isenstein as Mindy Kirk\n* Curtis Carnathan as Alexander Kaye\n* [[Shifra Lerer]] as Nellie Krichinsky\n** Christine Mosere\tas young Nellie\n* [[Mina Bern]] as Alice Krichinsky\n** [[Anna Bergman]] as young Alice\n* Frania Rubinek as Faye Krichinsky\n** Mary Lechter as young Faye\n* [[Ronald Guttman]] as Simka\n* [[Herb Levinson]] as Rabbi Krauss\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Relationship with other \"Baltimore films\"==\nLevinson frequently places links between his films that are set in Baltimore.
