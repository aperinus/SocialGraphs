Nin becomes involved in the couple's tormented relationship, having an affair with Miller and also pursuing June. Ultimately, Nin helps Miller to publish his novel ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', but catalyzes the Millers' separation, while she returns to Hugo.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fred Ward]] as [[Henry Miller]]\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as [[June Miller]]\n* [[Maria de Medeiros]] as [[Ana\u00efs Nin]]\n* [[Richard E.

These sequences, often tinged with symbolism (a hand playing a guitar juxtaposed with a hand on a woman's breast), tend to be self-consciously bold,\" but felt the film lacked daring.<ref>{{cite web | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=A Writer's Awakening to the Erotic | url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE5DD1E3BF936A35753C1A966958260 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 5, 1990 | access-date=May 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film has a 63% approval rating on review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10.
