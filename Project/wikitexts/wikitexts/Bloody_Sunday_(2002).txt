Although produced by [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] as a TV film, it premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on 16 January, a few days before its screening on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] on 20 January, and then in selected London cinemas from 25 January. Though set in Derry, the film was mostly shot in [[Ballymun]] in North [[Dublin]], with some location scenes were shot in Derry, in Guildhall Square and in [[Creggan, Derry|Creggan]] on the actual route of the {{not a typo|march}} in 1972.\n\n==Content==\nThe film was inspired by [[Don Mullan]]'s politically influential book ''Eyewitness Bloody Sunday'' (Wolfhound Press, 1997). The drama shows the events of the day through the eyes of [[Ivan Cooper]], an [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] Member of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] who was a central organiser of the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] march in [[Derry]] on 30 January 1972. The march ended when [[British Army]] [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|paratroopers]] fired on the demonstrators, killing thirteen and wounding another who died four and a half months later. In addition to the deaths, fourteen other people were wounded.\n\nA live version of \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" by [[U2]] plays over the closing credits.\n\n==Casting and production==\nCooper is played by [[James Nesbitt]], himself a Protestant from [[Northern Ireland]]. In recognition of the role his book played in achieving the new Bloody Sunday Inquiry, his book's role as inspiration for the movie, and the fact that he was a schoolboy witness to the tragedy, Don Mullan was asked by director Paul Greengrass to appear in the film as a Bogside Priest. A number of the military characters were played by ex-members of the British Army, including [[Simon Mann]]. Gerry Donaghy was played by Declan Duddy, nephew of Jackie Duddy, one of those killed on Bloody Sunday. [[Big Brother (British series 8)|Big Brother 2007]] housemate [[Big Brother (British series 8)#Housemates|Se\u00e1ny O'Kane]] was also in the film.<ref>{{IMDb name|1776825|Se\u00e1ny O'Kane}}</ref>\n\n==Notable actors==\n*[[James Nesbitt]] as [[Ivan Cooper]]\n*[[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Major General Robert Ford\n*[[Nicholas Farrell]] as Brigadier Patrick Maclellan\n*[[Gerard McSorley]] as Chief Supt.
