The film was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]] and released in theatres in the United States on July 16, 1999,<ref name=TheNumbers/> and in the United Kingdom on March 31, 2000.<ref name=Radiotimes/> It grossed $56.9 million worldwide and was followed by five low-budget made-for-television sequels, starting with ''[[Lake Placid 2]]'' in 2007.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Aroostook County, Maine]], Fish and Game officer Walt Lawson is [[scuba diving]] in Black Lake when he is suddenly attacked and bitten in half by an unknown creature.\n\nThe next day, [[Sheriff]] Hank Keough, Fish and Game officer Jack Wells, and [[American Museum of Natural History]] [[paleontologist]] Kelly Scott go to the lake to investigate the incident with [[mythology]] professor and [[crocodile]] enthusiast Hector Cyr joining them. After Kelly and Hank's [[canoe]] is flipped over, they discover a severed human toe and a [[moose]] head. Meanwhile, Hank's deputy, Burke, has his head bitten off when his boat is attacked while Wells and Cyr are diving.\n\nThe following day, as Hank and Hector argue, a large [[brown bear]] arrives, but a gigantic {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} long [[saltwater crocodile]] leaps out of the water, snatches the animal in its jaws, and drags it into the lake. After finding Burke's severed head, Jack, Kelly, and Hank witness Delores Bickerman, an elderly hermit living near the lake, feeding a blindfolded [[Dairy cattle|dairy cow]] to the giant crocodile. She reveals that she has been feeding the reptile for years after the crocodile followed her husband Bernie home and eventually killed him two years ago when he got between the croc and a runaway horse. Afterwards, she was placed under [[house arrest]] for initially [[perjury|lying to the police]].\n\nHector decides to take Deputy Sharon Gare on a trip in his helicopter and unexpectedly lands it in the crocodile's territory. While he is scuba diving, he is confronted by the creature, but he and Gare escape after distracting it with an inflatable raft. Later, Jack and Hank plan to allow [[Florida]] Fish and Game to kill the crocodile when they arrive, but Hector suggests instead that he should lure it out of the water and tranquilize it into unconsciousness. Jack reluctantly accepts the proposal and they use one of Bickerman's cattle, dangled from the helicopter, as bait.\n\nAfter a few hours, the crocodile soon appears and rears up as it lunges at its prey. Hector pulls up and loses the animal, but crashes the helicopter into the lake. The crocodile comes on land and begins to pursue Jack, Kelly, and the group. Kelly is knocked into the lake by the crocodile's tail, but she makes it into the helicopter in time. The crocodile catches up to Kelly and prepares to make its move, but is itself trapped in the helicopter. Jack grabs a gun and shoots it, but the firearm turns out to be a [[Tranquillizer gun|tranquilizer rifle]]. As Hector comes out of the water, another crocodile attacks and bites him, but Hank blows it up with his [[grenade launcher]]. Soon after, Florida Fish and Game officers arrive, where they load the neutralized crocodile onto a truck and take it to [[Portland, Maine]] to figure out what to do with it.\n\nOne week later, Bickerman is shown feeding bread crumbs to many baby crocodiles, revealing the two adults were actually a mating pair. The surviving adult crocodile is later seen tied to the back of a flatbed trailer, speeding down a road somewhere.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Jack Wells\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Kelly Scott\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Hector Cyr\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Sheriff Hank Keough\n* [[Betty White]] as Mrs. Delores Bickerman\n* [[Meredith Salenger]] as Deputy Sharon Gare\n* [[David Lewis (Canadian actor)|David Lewis]] as Walt Lawson\n* Tim Dixon as Stephen Daniels\n* [[Natassia Malthe]] as Janine\n* [[Mariska Hargitay]] as Myra Okubo\n* [[Jed Rees]] as Deputy Burke\n* Richard Leacock as Deputy Stevens\n* Jake T.
