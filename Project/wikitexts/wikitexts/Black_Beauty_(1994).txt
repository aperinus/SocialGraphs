Produced and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] under their [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] label, it is also treated as an [[autobiography]] of the horse Black Beauty as in the original novel, and features [[Alan Cumming]] as the voice of the 'Black Beauty'.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080120215404/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/132260/Black-Beauty/overview Overview] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBlack Beauty narrates his own story. He is born on a farm in the [[England|English]] countryside during the 19th century and remains by his mother's side until he is sent to Birtwick Park to serve Squire Gordon and his family.\n\nLady Gordon, the squire's sick wife, is pleased by the beautiful horse and gives him his trademark name, Black Beauty. Beauty is smitten with the squire's cynical chestnut mare, Ginger, who rebuffs his attempts to be friendly. However, Beauty also befriends Merrylegs, a perky grey [[pony]] who gives rides to the squire's young daughters, Jessica and Molly.\n\nOn a stormy night, Beauty is pulling a [[carriage]] holding the squire and his caretaker, John Manly, home from town. Sensing danger, he refuses to cross a partially [[flood]]ed [[bridge]]. When John tries to pull him to move, Beauty steadfastly refuses. When the bridge finally gives way, crashing into the river, John slips and falls in, but manages to hang on to Beauty's bridle. Beauty and the squire save John, and they again head off back home. Joe Green, who works in the stable, volunteers to look after Beauty that night. Joe's lack of knowledge about horses causes him to give Beauty ice cold water to drink and to neglect to dry him off or cover him with a rug overnight, which causes Beauty to fall sick. The following few days John, Joe, and the squire treat and nurse Beauty, and he recovers.\n\nLady Gordon's illness gets worse, and she is taken to a doctor in a carriage pulled by Beauty and Ginger. When they stop at an [[inn]] for the night, the barn where the horses are being kept catches on [[fire]] due to a carelessly dropped [[Smoking pipe|pipe]]. Luckily, Joe rescues the horses. Lady Gordon's doctor orders her to leave England for a warmer place because her illness is so severe. The squire and his family bid a sad goodbye to John, Joe, and the beloved horses. Merrylegs is given to the [[vicar]] who promises never to sell the pony.\n\nBeauty and Ginger are taken to Earlshall Park, home of the Lord and Lady of Wexmire, and Joe bids a tearful goodbye to Beauty. Beauty and Ginger are paired up to pull Lady Wexmire's carriage, but she demands that the horses wear uncomfortable [[Overcheck|bearing reins]] to raise their heads high, which angers Ginger. When the next day Lady Wexmire orders the horse's heads be strapped up even further, Ginger breaks away from the carriage in a rage, leading to Lady Wexmire forbidding her any further use on her carriage-dragging.\n\nReuben Smith, the horses caretaker, rides to town with Beauty to take a carriage to be repainted. He becomes drunk at the local tavern. Despite warnings from a blacksmith's apprentice, he nevertheless roughly rides Beauty home, who is losing one of his [[horse shoes]]. When the shoe finally falls off, Beauty stumbles and throws Reuben off the saddle, causing both rider and horse to suffer injuries. Both are found the next morning by Wexmire's men. Reuben is sacked from his job, and Beauty is later sold by Lord Wexmire due to his disfigured knees. Beauty is bought by a man who keeps horses for renting, but treats them terribly. He is eventually taken to a fair, where he briefly spots Joe, now a grown-up, but Joe doesn't notice him. Beauty's whinnies instead catch the attention of Jerry Barker, a taxi carriage driver from [[London]], who is immediately taken by Beauty and buys him once successfully haggling the cost down to 17 [[guineas]].\n\nJerry introduces Beauty to his warm family - wife and two young children, who name him Black Jack. Though Beauty dislikes the harshness of London, he nevertheless likes his job as a taxi cab horse and Jerry's kind treatment of him. One day, Beauty spots and reunites with Ginger; she is now a cab horse who has suffered from years of abuse by her owner. Beauty begs for her not to give up, but too soon she is led away by her owner on a fare. Sometime later, Beauty spots her dead body on a wagon, her troubles finally over. One snowy night, Jerry has a dreadful cough that worsens as he's kept waiting for hours outdoors in the freezing weather for his passengers to leave a party. His condition then worsens and a doctor advises him to quit his job and move to the countryside. Beauty is reluctantly sold to a grain dealer where he's forced to pull heavy loads of flour. After two years of pulling heavy carts, he collapses from utter exhaustion.\n\nBeauty is taken to a fair to be sold, but he is now so weak and in such poor condition that many reject him. Then Farmer Thoroughgood and his grandson spot Beauty, and a young man sees him, too. Beauty realizes that the young man is Joe on recognizing his voice, and though he is hardly able to, he finds the strength and whinnies for his old friend and the two are finally reunited. Beauty lives the remainder of his life at Thoroughgood's farm with Joe, who promises that he will never sell Beauty.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Docs Keepin Time]] as Black Beauty (horse)\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Black Beauty (voice)\n* [[Andrew Knott]] as Joe Green\n** [[Ian Kelsey]] as older Joe Green\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Farmer Grey\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Jerry Barker\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as John Manly\n* [[Peter Davison]] as Squire Gordon\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Reuben Smith\n* [[John McEnery]] as Mr. York\n* [[Eleanor Bron]] as Lady Wexmire\n* [[Peter Cook]] as Lord Wexmire\n* [[Keeley Flanders]] as Dolly Barker\n* [[Niall O'Brien (actor)|Niall O'Brien]] as Farmer Thoroughgood\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film did not recoup its budget and performed poorly at the box office,<ref>{{cite news|title= It's an Ace for 'Mask' at Box Office : Movies: New Line Cinema's entree into the majors is a hit on its opening weekend. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-01/entertainment/ca-22394_1_opening-weekend/2|access-date=2011-01-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : Reaching Higher Highs in Ticket Sales |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-02/entertainment/ca-22592_1_weekend-gross|access-date=2011-01-12}}</ref> grossing only $4,630,377 domestically.<ref>{{mojo title|blackbeauty|Black Beauty}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Black Beauty'' received generally positive reviews upon its release.
