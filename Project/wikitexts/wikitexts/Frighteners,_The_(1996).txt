The film stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Trini Alvarado]], [[Peter Dobson]], [[John Astin]], [[Dee Wallace|Dee Wallace Stone]], [[Jeffrey Combs]], [[R. Lee Ermey]] and [[Jake Busey]]. ''The Frighteners'' tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who practices [[necromancy]], developing psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with [[ghost]]s after his wife's murder. He initially uses his new abilities to befriend ghosts, whom he sends to haunt people so that he can charge them handsome fees for \"exorcising\" the ghosts. However, the spirit of a [[mass murder]]er appears able to attack the living and the dead, posing as the ghost of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence.\n\nJackson and Walsh conceived the idea for ''The Frighteners'' during the script-writing phase of ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''. Executive producer [[Robert Zemeckis]] hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing ''The Frighteners'' as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film of the television series, ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]''. With Jackson and Walsh's first draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film would be better off directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]]. The visual effects were created by Jackson's [[Weta Digital]], which had only been in existence for three years. This, plus the fact that ''The Frighteners'' required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.\n\nDespite a rushed [[post-production]] schedule, Universal was so impressed with Jackson's [[rough cut]] on ''The Frighteners'', the studio moved the theatrical release date up by three months. The film was not a [[box office]] success, but received generally positive reviews from critics. The film gained a cult following and is considered a cult classic on Jackson\u2019s catalog.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/frighteners-grim-reaper-backstory.html | title=How Peter Jackson's the Frighteners Brought the Personification of Death to Life | date=December 14, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3497661/peter-jacksons-frighteners-unjustly-forgotten-gem/ | title=Peter Jackson's 'The Frighteners': An Unjustly Forgotten Gem | date=May 8, 2018 }}</ref><ref>https://www.joblo.com/peter-jackson-the-frighteners-the-best-movie-you-never-saw/</ref><ref>https://www.dreadcentral.com/editorials/433777/the-frighteners-is-the-perfect-bookend-to-peter-jacksons-horror-period/</ref><ref>https://gizmodo.com/the-frighteners-peter-jacksons-precursor-to-lord-of-th-1825891383</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FEATURE FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn 1990, architect Frank Bannister's wife, Debra, dies in a car accident. He abandons his profession and his unfinished \"dream house\" sits incomplete. Following the accident, Frank gained the power to see ghosts and he befriends three: 1970s street gangster Cyrus, 1950s nerd Stuart, and The Judge, a [[Gunfighter|gunslinger]] from [[American frontier|the Old West]]. The ghosts haunt houses so Frank can then \"[[exorcism|exorcise]]\" them for a fee. Most locals consider him a [[Confidence trick|con man]].\n\nSoon after Frank cons local health nut Ray Lynskey and his wife Lucy, a physician, Ray dies of a heart attack. Frank discovers that there is an entity, appearing as the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], killing people, first marking numbers on their foreheads that only Frank sees. Debra had a similar number when she was found.\n\nFrank's ability to foretell the murders puts him under suspicion with the police and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Milton Dammers, who is convinced Frank is responsible. Frank is arrested for killing newspaper editor Magda Rees-Jones, who had attacked him in the press. It was actually the Grim Reaper who killed Rees-Jones, despite Frank's attempts to prevent it.\n\nLucy investigates the murders and becomes a target of the Grim Reaper. She is attacked while visiting Frank in jail; but they escape with the help of Cyrus and Stuart, who are both dissolved in the process. Frank wants to commit suicide to stop the Grim Reaper. Lucy helps Frank have a near-death experience by putting him into [[hypothermia]] and using [[barbiturate]]s to stop his heart. Dammers abducts Lucy, revealing that he had been a victim of [[Charles Manson]] and [[Spahn Ranch#Manson Family headquarters (1968\u20131969)|his \"Family\" in 1969]].\n\nIn his ghostly form, Frank confronts the Grim Reaper and discovers that he is the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a psychiatric hospital orderly who killed twelve people in 1964, before being captured, convicted and executed. Newspaper reports reveal that his greatest desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever, showing pride at killing more than contemporaries like [[Charles Starkweather]]. Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia. Unknown to them, Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly, homicidal terms with Bartlett's ghost, and eventually kills her own mother, who had been trying to monitor her daughter's behavior. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett's spirit in his urn, which Patricia has kept. The pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett's ghost to [[Hell]].\n\nPatricia and Dammers chase them through the ruins. Dammers throws the ashes away, releasing Bartlett's ghost again before Patricia kills Dammers. Bartlett's ghost and Patricia hunt down Frank and Lucy. Frank realizes that Bartlett's ghost, with Patricia's help, was responsible for his wife's death and the number on her brow, and that he is still trying to add to his body count (and infamy) even after his death.\n\nOut of bullets, Patricia strangles Frank to death, but Frank in spirit form rips Patricia's spirit from her body, forcing Bartlett to follow them. Bartlett grabs Patricia's ghost, while Frank makes it to Heaven, where he is reunited with Cyrus and Stuart, along with his wife Debra. Bartlett and Patricia's spirits claim they will now go back to claim more lives, but the portal to Heaven quickly changes to a demonic-looking appearance and they are both dragged to Hell by a [[Hellmouth|giant worm-like creature]]. Frank learns it is not yet his time and is sent back to his body as Debra's spirit tells him to \"be happy.\"\n\nFrank and Lucy fall in love. Lucy is now able to see ghosts as well. Frank later begins demolishing the unfinished dream house and building a life with Lucy while the morose-looking ghost of Dammers is riding around in the Sheriff Walt Perry's car. The sheriff, who is also Frank's friend, approaches him and reveals that the police discovered a huge collection of Ouija Boards in Patricia's room. This causes Frank to realize how Johnny managed to come back to the world of the living as Patricia used the Ouija Board to bring him back from hell. Frank and Lucy then enjoy their picnic.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Michael J.

Although Jackson and Walsh envisioned ''The Frighteners'' as a low-budget film with unknown actors, Zemeckis suggested casting his ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]'' star Fox in the lead role. Fox became enthusiastic about working with Jackson when he saw ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=biography />\n* [[Trini Alvarado]] as Lucy Lynskey, a physician that Frank meets.

A former [[Espionage|undercover agent]] known for his work with [[cult]]ists, which caused him to sustain multiple massive mutilations and drove him to the brink of [[insanity]], he has a problem with women screaming at him.

Six weeks into the shoot, [[cinematographer]] [[Alun Bollinger]] had a serious car accident. His replacement, John Blick, later alternated duties with Bollinger for much of the rest of the shoot.<ref name=long>Pryor, p.201-203</ref> [[Location shooting]] primarily included [[Wellington]] and three weeks spent in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]].

[[Visual effects supervisor]] [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] explained that effects work on ''The Frighteners'' was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with [[Practical effect|physical effects]]. With so many ghosts among its main cast, ''The Frighteners'' required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company that had been in existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing ''The Frighteners'' was largely stressful.<ref name=long /> Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital.<ref name=biography /> [[Rick Baker]] was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by [[John Astin]] (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of makeup due to his commitment on ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]''.<ref name=long /> Makeup artist Brian Penikas ([[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' trilogy]], ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'') fulfilled Baker's duties.<ref name=Indy>{{cite news | author = Vaz, Mark Cota | title = ''The Frighteners'': The Thrill of the Haunt | work = [[Cinefex]] | date = June 1996 | pages = 67\u201371 }}</ref>\n\nThe extended shooting schedule owed much to the fact that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice; once with human characters acting on set, and then with the ghost characters acting against a [[Chroma key|blue screen]]. The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of [[Split screen (video production)|split screen photography]]. Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air.<ref name=long /> The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], which went through many transformations before finding physical form.<ref name=Indy /> \"We set out with the intention of doing the Reaper as a rod [[puppet]], maybe shooting it in a water tank,\" Jackson commented. \"We even thought of filming someone, dressed in costume, at different camera speeds.\"<ref name=long /> Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit, but in the end, it was decided that using [[computer animation]] would be the easiest task. Another entirely computerized character called \"the Gatekeeper\", a winged [[cherub]] who helps guard the cemetery, was deleted from the [[final cut privilege|final cut]].<ref name=Japan>Sibley, p.320-329</ref>\n\nWith digital effects work running behind schedule, Zemeckis convinced [[Wes Takahashi]], an animation supervisor from visual effects company [[Industrial Light & Magic]], to help work on ''The Frighteners''.<ref name=Japan /> \"The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable,\" Takahashi reflected, \"but there were still about 400 shots to do, and everyone was kind of worried.\"<ref name=stress /> Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, trying to work out whether ''The Frighteners'' could be finished in time. \"There was no way we'd make the deadline. I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money.\"<ref name=stress /> The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film was a chance to show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise.<ref name=stress /> Instead, ''The Frighteners'' received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US).<ref>Pryor, pp. 300-309</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Frighteners\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[Danny Elfman]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = July 19, 1996\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     = 41:14\n| label      = [[Universal Music Group|Universal Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = [[Black Beauty (1994 film)#Soundtrack|Black Beauty]]\n| prev_year  = 1994\n| next_title = [[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]\n| next_year  = 1997\n}}\nThe [[film score]] was written and composed by [[Danny Elfman]].
