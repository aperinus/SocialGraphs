It is about a wayward young man who, while seeking his own identity, vies for the affection of his deeply religious father against his favored brother, thus retelling the story of [[Cain and Abel]].\n\nThe film stars [[James Dean]] (in his first major screen role), [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] and [[Raymond Massey]]. It also features [[Burl Ives]], [[Richard Davalos]], and [[Jo Van Fleet]] (also her first screen role), and was adapted by [[Paul Osborn]].<ref>{{AFI film|id=51490|title=East of Eden}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough set in early 20th century [[Monterey, California]], much of the film was actually shot on location in [[Mendocino, California]].  Some scenes were filmed in the [[Salinas Valley]]. Of the three films in which James Dean played the lead, this is the only one to have been released during his lifetime.<ref>{{IMDb name|id=0000015|name=James Dean}}.</ref>\n\nThe film, along with Dean's other films ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' and ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'', was named one of the 400 best American films of all time by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/film/afi400.htm |title=American Film Institute's Top 400 American Films |access-date=2014-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055905/http://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/film/afi400.htm |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=With \"20,000 Leagues,\" the National Film Registry Reaches 700|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-16-209/with-20000-leagues-the-national-film-registry-reaches-700/2016-12-14/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot line is loosely based on the biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]]. The story is set in 1917, during [[World War I]], in the central California coastal towns of [[Monterey California|Monterey]] and [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]. Cal and Aron are the young adult sons of a farmer and wartime draft board chairman, Adam Trask, with whom they live in the Salinas valley. Adam is a deeply religious Christian. Aron is pious, dutiful, and responsible, while Cal is moody, embittered, and thinks he is sinful. He believes his father loves only Aron. Adam told the boys their mother, Kate, died when they were infants. However, Cal discovers Kate operates a [[brothel]] in nearby Monterey, though he keeps this from Adam and Aron.\n\nAdam's idealistic plans for a long-haul vegetable shipping enterprise end disastrously, losing him his entire savings. To recoup his father's loss, Cal decides to enter the bean-growing business, knowing that if the United States enters the war, bean prices will skyrocket. Cal hopes this will earn his father's love and respect. He goes to Kate to ask for the $5,000 capital he needs. Kate reveals she deserted the family because she hated living on the farm, never loved Adam, and rebelled against him completely controlling her. She shot Adam in the shoulder when he attempted to stop her leaving. Kate loans the money to Cal, noting the irony that the loan proceeds from her business are intended to preserve Adam's good name. Meanwhile, Aron's girlfriend, Abra, is growing attracted to Cal, who seems to reciprocate her feelings.\n\nCal's bean venture is successful, and he intends to give the profits to Adam at a surprise birthday party he and Abra have planned. As the party begins, Aron suddenly announces that he and Abra are engaged. While Adam is openly pleased, both Abra and Cal are uneasy due to their growing feelings for one another. Cal presents the money to his father; however, Adam refuses it, claiming it is [[war profiteering]] and demands he give it back to the farmers he \"robbed.\" Adam adds that Aron's gift, compared to Cal's, is \"honest and...good.\" A confused Cal sees his father's refusal as just another emotional rejection. When a distraught Cal leaves the room, Abra goes after him. Aron follows and orders Cal to stay away from her. Cal angrily tells Aron that their mother is alive, then takes him to her Monterey bordello. Cal roughly shoves the stunned Aron at the elderly Kate, causing her to fall. When Cal arrives home, Adam demands to know where Aron is. Cal initially responds he is not his [[Cain and Abel|brother's keeper]], then tells Adam what he did.\n\nThe truth about his mother drives the pacifistic Aron to get drunk, lose control, and then board a troop train to enlist in the army. When the sheriff informs Adam, he rushes to the station in a futile attempt to dissuade him. Adam fails and watches helplessly as Aron smashes his head through the rail car window, maniacally laughing as the train pulls away. A shocked Adam suffers a [[stroke]], leaving him paralyzed and unable to communicate. Cal tries talking to Adam, but gets no response and leaves the bedroom. Abra pleads with Adam to show Cal some affection before it is too late. When Cal makes his last bid for acceptance before leaving town, Adam manages to speak. He tells Cal to fire the annoying nurse, then whispers something to him. Cal tells Abra that Adam said he wants only Cal to care for him. The film ends with Cal, alone, sitting by his father's bedside, the emotional chasm between the father and son apparently healing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[James Dean]] as Caleb Trask\n* [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] as Abra Bacon\n* [[Raymond Massey]] as Adam Trask\n* [[Richard Davalos]] as Aron Trask\n* [[Burl Ives]] as Sam (the sheriff)\n* [[Jo Van Fleet]] as Kate Ames/Cathy Trask \n* [[Albert Dekker]] as Will Hamilton\n* Harold Gordon as Gustav Albrecht\n* [[Nick Dennis]] as Rantani\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Anne, Kate's servant<ref>Lois Smith is the last surviving credited film cast member, as of February 1, 2019.</ref>\n* [[Timothy Carey]] as Joe, Kate's henchman (uncredited)\n* [[Barbara Baxley]] as Adam's nurse (uncredited)\n* [[Richard Garrick]] as Dr. Edwards (uncredited) \n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Roy Turner, the automobile mechanic (uncredited)\n* [[Lester Dorr]] as City Official at the parade (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:James Dean - Julie Harris.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Film still]] with Harris and Dean.]]\nDirector [[Elia Kazan]] first toyed with the idea of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as Cal and [[Montgomery Clift]] as Aron, but at 30 and 34 years old, respectively, they were simply too old to play teenage brothers. [[Paul Newman]], who was one year younger than Brando, was a finalist for the part of Cal, which eventually was played by James Dean, who was six years younger than Newman.\n\nNewman and Dean, who were up for the part of Cal, screen tested together for the parts of the rival brothers. In the end, [[Richard Davalos]] got the part of Aron. This was his screen debut.\n\n[[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] was cast as Abra James. Executive producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was opposed to her casting, because she was ten years older than her character.\n\nKazan denied rumors that he didn't like Dean: \"You can't not like a guy with that much pain in him\u2026  You know how a dog will be mean and snarl at you, then you pat him, and he's all over you with affection? That's the way Dean was.\" Kazan did intervene sternly, however, when Dean started to feel his power as a hotly emerging star and treated crew members disrespectfully.<ref>{{cite book | first=Elia| last=Kazan | title= Elia Kazan: A Life | publisher= McFarland | year=1988}}</ref>\n\n==Themes and character motivations==\nThe underlying theme of ''East of Eden'' is a biblical reference to the brothers [[Cain and Abel]]. Cal is constantly struggling to earn his father's approval. The relationship between Cal and his father is a stressful one and is not resolved until late in the story, after his father suffers a paralyzing stroke. In his paralyzed state and with the help of Julie Harris' character, Abra, Cal's father finally expresses his suppressed love for the boy.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16719/east-of-eden#articles-reviews|title=Pop Culture 101: EAST OF EDEN |access-date=October 6, 2022|work=TCM.com}}</ref>\n\nOther themes touched upon in the film include [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] [[xenophobia]], specifically as wrought against a local German immigrant as resentment about United States entry into [[World War I]] grew. The themes of young love and [[sibling rivalry]] are also present in the film, as Aron's girlfriend finds herself increasingly drawn to the more rebellious Cal.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Critical reaction==\n[[Dave Kehr]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' praised the adaptation by Kazan and the \"down-to-earth\" performances of [[James Dean]] and [[Richard Davalos]].<ref>[[Dave Kehr|Kehr, Dave]].
