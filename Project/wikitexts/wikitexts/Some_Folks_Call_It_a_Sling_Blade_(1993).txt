On the day of his release, he is interviewed by a reporter, Theresa Tatum ([[Molly Ringwald]]), who is writing an article with the intent of examining whether criminals judged to be insane should be released. Before the interview, Tatum is of the opinion that criminals like Childers should never be released. During the interview, however, Tatum must question her previous beliefs.\n\nThe title of the film comes from Childers's description of the murders. He admits to committing murder with a kaiser blade: \"Some folks call it a [[sling blade]], I call it a Kaiser blade.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0108181}}\n\n{{George Hickenlooper}}\n\n[[Category:1994 drama films]]\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 short films]]\n[[Category:American short films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Hickenlooper]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n\n\n{{short-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
