Animation]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. Featuring the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], the film is the 26th film of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]], based on the [[Batman: The Killing Joke|graphic novel of the same name]] by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Brian Bolland]]. The film is directed by [[Sam Liu]], written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and stars the voices of [[Kevin Conroy]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Tara Strong]], and [[Ray Wise]]. Like the novel, the film follows the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s undertaking to drive police commissioner [[Jim Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] insane, and Batman's desperate attempts to stop him.\n\nDevelopment of a film adaptation of the novel began in 2009; however, production was stalled due to the under-performance of DC's [[Watchmen (film)|live-action adaptation]] of Moore's ''[[Watchmen]]''. In 2011, Hamill expressed interest in reprising his role of the Joker for the adaptation, resulting in a fan campaign for its production. In 2015, producer [[Bruce Timm]] confirmed that an animated feature based on the book was in development. It is the first ''Batman'' film and Warner Bros. Animation film (as well as the first of the DCUAOM) to be rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] on July 22, 2016. Originally intended to be released [[Direct-to-video|directly on home video]], due to its popularity, the film was instead released [[Simultaneous release|simultaneously]] in [[Film theater|theaters]] and [[Digital distribution|digitally]] on July 25, 2016, for a special one-night event, before a [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] release on August 2, 2016. It grossed $4.4 million worldwide, and it became the [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films#Highest-grossing R-rated animated films|9th highest-grossing R-rated animated film worldwide]]. Critical reception to the film was negative, with the prologue and its portrayal of [[Batgirl]] being targeted for criticism, while the animation style, action scenes, voice performances (particularly Conroy and Hamill's) and the second half of the film's largely faithful adaptation of the graphic novel receiving praise.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile out on patrol, [[Barbara Gordon]] ([[Batgirl]]) fails to stop a robbery, but manages to stop one criminal with help from [[Batman]]. Paris Franz, the robbers' leader and the nephew of a powerful mob boss, develops a dangerous obsession with her and starts sending her messages. After Franz tricks her into finding his uncle's dead body, Batman becomes concerned about her safety and takes her off the case, telling her that she will eventually be tempted to kill the criminals she pursues. Outraged, Batgirl attacks Batman physically and verbally, which leads to them having sex. A few nights later, Batgirl tries to apologize to Batman, but he is ambushed by Franz and his men, prompting her to come to his aid. When she arrives and overpowers Franz, he makes her lose control and give him a savage beating, stopping just short of killing him. Realizing Batman was right, she retires from crime-fighting.\n\nLater, Batman investigates a murder scene with [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Detective Harvey Bullock]] and concludes that the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], currently held at [[Arkham Asylum]], might be behind the crime. He goes to Arkham to talk to him, only to discover that he has escaped and put a decoy in his place. Joker then attacks Barbara and her father, Commissioner James Gordon. He shoots her in the stomach, paralyzing her from the waist down, and takes Gordon to an abandoned amusement park. There, Joker strips him naked and subjects him to torture, including showing him photos he took of Barbara, naked and in pain.\n\nThe story is intercut with flashbacks of Joker's origin. It is revealed that he was once a lab technician who quit his job to become a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie, he agrees to help two criminals rob his former workplace. The criminals tell him that he has to use the [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]]'s mask and caped costume, secretly intending to frame him. During the planning, the police inform him that Jeannie and their unborn child have died in a household accident. Grief-stricken, he tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them.\n\nAt the plant, the criminals and the costumed comedian run into security personnel, and a shootout occurs. The criminals are gunned down and the comedian is confronted by Batman. Terrified, the comedian trips and falls into the chemical plant's waste pond, and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. As he removes his mask, he sees the chemicals have permanently disfigured his face, giving him a clown-like appearance. His disfigurement, combined with the loss of his family, and what he had experienced in the chemical plant drives him insane and transforms him into the Joker.\n\nIn the present, Batman finds and saves Gordon, while the Joker flees. Despite his ordeal, Gordon remains sane and demands that Batman capture the Joker \"by the book\". Batman follows the Joker as the latter tries to persuade him that the world is just one big joke and that \"one bad day\" is enough to drive an ordinary man insane. Batman subdues Joker, tells him that Gordon has remained sane, and concludes that Joker is alone in his madness. He then attempts to reach out to him, offering rehabilitation. Joker apologetically declines, saying it is too late for him.\n\nJoker then says that the situation reminds him of a joke about two patients in an insane asylum who try to escape by leaping over to the adjoining building. The first patient makes it across, but the second patient is afraid that he will fall. The first patient gets an idea: \"Hey, I got this flashlight with me. I'll just shine it across the gap between the buildings and you can walk across the beam and join me.\" The second patient questions the idea: \"What do you think I am, crazy? You'll just turn it off when I'm halfway across!\" Initially stoic, Batman soon joins Joker in having a good laugh at the joke. As the police arrive, the Joker's laugh trails off, but Batman continues to laugh.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Joker (character)|Joker]] / [[Red Hood]] \n* [[Tara Strong]] as [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara Gordon / Batgirl]]\n* [[Ray Wise]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]\n* [[Robin Atkin Downes]]<ref name=\"cast-list\" /> as [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Detective Harvey Bullock]]\n* [[John DiMaggio]]<ref name=\"cast-list\" /> as Carlos Francesco\n* [[Brian George]]<ref name=\"cast-list\" /> as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\n* [[JP Karliak|J.P.

There's definitely some stuff in that first part of the movie that's going to be controversial. Here's where we came down on that specific issue: It was really important to us to show that both of the characters make some pretty big mistakes. I mean, his \"parental skills\" aren't that great. Maybe never having had any kids of his own, he doesn't realize that if you tell a kid to not do something, they're going to want to do it even more. And then she makes some mistakes and then he kind of overreacts to her mistakes and then she overreacts to his overreaction. So it's very human; it's a very understandable story. It's tricky because it's messy, because relationships are sometimes messy.
