First broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 25 December 2011, it is the seventh [[List of Doctor Who Christmas specials|''Doctor Who'' Christmas special]] since the show's revival in 2005. It was written by [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by [[Farren Blackburn]]. Internationally, the special was shown on [[BBC America]] in the United States and on [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] in Canada the same day as the British broadcast, with [[ABC1]] in Australia showing it one day later.\n\nIn the special, alien time traveller the [[Eleventh Doctor|Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith]]) is the caretaker of recently widowed Madge Arwell ([[Claire Skinner]]) and her children Lily ([[Holly Earl]]) and Cyril (Maurice Cole) during their holiday vacation in 1941 England. The Doctor plans to take them on a treat to a snowy planet through a portal in a present he has placed under the Christmas tree, but Cyril opens it before Christmas and wanders through.  While looking for him, the others learn that the trees of the planet are about to be melted down with [[acid rain]] for energy.\n\n\"The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe\" marked the end of [[Piers Wenger]]'s tenure as executive producer, and the debut of Caroline Skinner in the same position.  Adapting elements of [[C.S. Lewis]]'s children's novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', Moffat intended the episode to be the most \"Christmassy\" of the ''Doctor Who'' Christmas specials, while Blackburn felt there was \"magic\" in it. It was filmed in September and October 2011, with some scenes taking place in an authentic [[Lancaster bomber]]. \"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" was watched by 10.77 million viewers in the United Kingdom, making it the third most-watched programme on Christmas Day. Critical reception to the episode was positive, though some felt that the high-profile comedic guest stars [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Arabella Weir]] were underused.\n\n==Plot==\n===Prequel===\nOn 6 December 2011, a prequel to the episode was released online.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mayer|last=Nissim|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a354649/doctor-who-the-doctor-the-widow-and-the-wardrobe-prequel-video.html|title='Doctor Who': The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 prequel video|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Nat Mags]]|date=6 December 2011|access-date=5 August 2012}}</ref> The [[Eleventh Doctor]] is seen on a spaceship holding a red button which, when he lets go, will cause the space ship to explode. While holding the button, he has phoned the [[TARDIS]] to speak to [[Amy Pond|Amy]] asking her to rescue him, although he does not have his co-ordinates, Amy cannot fly the TARDIS, and she is not on the TARDIS. The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of the button, and the spaceship explodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00m7qjb|title=The Prequel to The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe|publisher=[[BBC]]|format=Video|date=6 December 2011|access-date=15 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Synopsis===\nIn England on Christmas Eve 1941, the Doctor becomes caretaker to Madge Arwell and her children, Lily and Cyril, as a favour to Madge for helping the Doctor find his TARDIS three years earlier. Madge has received a telegram that the children's father Reg disappeared over the [[English Channel]] a few days earlier, but decides not to tell her children yet, hoping to keep their spirits up through the holiday.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (13080876903).jpg|thumb|250px|left|The wood creatures, as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nThat night, Cyril is lured into opening a large glowing present under the Christmas tree, revealing a [[time portal]] to a snow-covered forest. The Doctor shortly discovers Cyril's absence and follows him with Lily; they eventually track Cyril to a strange lighthouse-like structure. Madge, finding her children missing, soon follows them into the forest, but is met by three miners in space suits. The miners tell Madge that the forest of the planet they are on is scheduled to be melted by [[acid rain]] within minutes, killing anything within it. At the lighthouse, Cyril is met by a humanoid creature made of wood; it places a simple band of metal around his head like a crown. Lily and the Doctor arrive, followed by another wood creature, but find the creatures have rejected Cyril as he is \"weak\", as they do the Doctor. The Doctor concludes that the life forces of the trees in the forest are trying to escape through a living creature, with the crown acting as an interface.\n\nMadge safely reunites with her children as the acid rain starts. The wood creatures identify her as \"strong\", and the Doctor realises they consider her the \"mothership\", able to carry the life force safely. Donning the band, Madge absorbs the life force of the forest, allowing her to direct the top of the lighthouse as an escape pod away from the acid rain and into the time vortex. Reg's plane follows the light of the pod through the time vortex and safely arrives outside the house at Christmas, reuniting Reg with his family. The life force of the forest have converted themselves to ethereal beings within the time vortex. Believing that Amy and [[Rory Williams|Rory]] still think he is dead, the Doctor joins them for Christmas dinner.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Just Jane taxi.JPG|thumb|right| The Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre's preserved Lancaster bomber ''Just Jane'', used in the programme]]\n\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" was written by head writer and executive producer [[Steven Moffat]], who wanted it to be \"the most Christmassy Christmas special ever\".<ref name=\"SFX Blackburn\" /> He stated that \"nothing is more fun to write\" than the Doctor at Christmas, as he considered it \"his kind of day.

He praised the production design and special effects teams for \"creating some dazzlingly memorable special effects, and a winter wonderland that was both recognisably, fuzzily Christmas incarnate and unerringly, tensely alien\" but thought the supporting cast \"triumphed above and beyond\" the plot devices. Like Hogan, Risley commented that the comedian cast of Bailey and Weir as well as Armstrong \"felt lacking\".<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Risley|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/121/1215243p1.html|title=Doctor Who: \"The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe\" Review|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=25 December 2011|access-date=2 January 2012}}</ref> However, the next year, Risley wrote that he \"got a little carried away with the festive funtimes ...

However, he thought that the lack of a villain was an \"interesting experiment, but maybe not ideal for Christmas Day\" and Bailey and Weir's forest rangers \"felt like bolt-on comic relief\".<ref name=\"SFX\">{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Setchfield|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2011/12/25/doctor-who-the-doctor-the-widow-and-the-wardrobe%E2%80%9D-tv-review/|title=Doctor Who 'The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe' TV Review|work=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|date=25 December 2011|access-date=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===DVD release===\n\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\", along with its prequel, received a stand-alone DVD and Blu-ray release on 12 January 2012.
