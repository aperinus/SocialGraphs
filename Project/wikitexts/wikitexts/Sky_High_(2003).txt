It is based on the [[manga]] [[Skyhigh (manga)|of the same title]] by [[Tsutomu Takahashi]] and serves as a [[prequel]] to a Japanese television drama [[Sky High (TV series)|of the same name]], and starring the same actress, [[Yumiko Shaku]].  Although the film is a prequel to the series, the film was made while the series was still in production, sometime between the first and second seasons.  The film had a clear effect on the direction of the second season, as evidenced in the look and style of Mina/Izuko's second season costuming\u2014more similar to the darker, edgier look she sports in the film,<ref>[http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/06/29/ASBY-2498.jpg Sky High, Season 2]</ref> as opposed to the softer, colourful, kimono-like outfit of the first season.<ref>[http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/12/00/AMEB-4.jpg Sky High, Season 1 - A]</ref><ref>[http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/11/48/AMEB-3.jpg Sky High, Season 1 - B]</ref>  The film reveals how the somewhat meek Mina became the heroic Izuko, as seen in the series (and the film\u2019s action climax).<ref>{{YouTube|JrjOH5mFRgM|Trailer: \"Sky High (2003)\"}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|5Ezpn0uIcIY|Trailer: \"Sky High (2003)\" (with English Subtitles)}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA [[serial killer]] is on the loose who just so happens to also be removing the hearts of his victims and taking them with him. His victims however, are not merely random humans as thought by the police. They are in fact, the past and present guardians of the gateway of the [[afterlife]].\n\nOn the day he is to be married, Detective Kanzaki, who happens to be on the case, discovers that his fianc\u00e9 Mina has been murdered with her heart also missing. He also learns that the killers are Kudo, a geneticist, and his evil secretary Rei. The two are trying to obtain six hearts from the guardians so that they may call forth a horde of [[demon]]s from the Gate of Rage and have their every desire granted. Only problem is, once they open the gate the entire world will be covered in darkness.\n\nMeanwhile, in the afterlife, Mina encounters Izuko, the Guardian of the Gate. Izuko gives her three options: Mina can choose to ascend to [[heaven]] and be reborn, she can choose to forever walk the earth as a [[ghost]] or she can choose to [[curse]] one of the living to death and as a result be cursed to descend to [[hell]]. Mina has 12 days to make her choice.\n\n==Production==\nThe film opened in Japanese theaters in late 2003.  Its premiere followed in the footsteps of the popular [[Sky High (TV series)|''Sky High'' television series]], starring the same actress ([[Yumiko Shaku]]) in the lead role of Izuko\u2014or specifically, the \"new\" Izuko, as the film is considered a [[prequel]] to the [[Sky High (TV series)|TV series]], revealing how Mina Saeki (Shaku) came to replace the previous Guardian and take her position as the Izuko we see in the series.  Although the film makes much greater use of action, martial arts, and big budget special effects than the series is capable, both follow the same continuity.  [[TV-Asahi]], the Japanese television network behind the [[Sky High (TV series)|TV series]] is also the theatrical film's primary production company.<ref>{{YouTube|JrjOH5mFRgM|Trailer: \"Sky High (2003)\"}}</ref>  The movie was helmed by popular action director [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], best known for his [[Versus (2000 film)|''Versus'']] series of films, as well as other popular draws such as ''[[Azumi (film)|Azumi]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0398563|Sky High}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb name|0457565|Ryuhei Kitamura}}</ref>  Kitamura also directed several episodes of the TV series, and following the film's box office success, [[Sky High (TV series)|''Sky High 2'']] (or Season 2) was quickly put into production by the network for January 2004, utilizing many elements from the film, including its darker, edgier look, and improved sets and effects.\n\nThe film's [[screenplay]] was written by [[Isao Kiriyama]], based on the manga ''[[Skyhigh (manga)|Sky High]]'' by [[Tsutomu Takahashi]].\n\nThe closing theme for the movie is \"Horizon\" by [[Hyde (musician)|Hyde]] ([[L'Arc-en-Ciel]] and [[Vamps (band)|Vamps]]).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0398563|Sky High}}\n\n{{Ryuhei Kitamura}}\n\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2000s action films]]\n[[Category:2000s supernatural films]]\n[[Category:2003 drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s serial killer films]]\n[[Category:2000s ghost films]]\n[[Category:Supernatural thriller films]]\n[[Category:Japanese serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Japanese ghost films]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on manga]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ryuhei Kitamura]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese films]]\n\n[[ja:\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30cf\u30a4 (\u6f2b\u753b)]]"}]}}}}
