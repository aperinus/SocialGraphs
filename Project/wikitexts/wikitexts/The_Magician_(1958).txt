K. Chesterton]]'s play ''Magic'', which Bergman numbered among his favourites. At one time, Bergman staged a theatre production of ''Magic'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]].{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[31st Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2021}}\nAlbert Vogler is a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] who leads a troupe of performers, known as Vogler's Magnetic Health Theater, who claim to possess [[supernatural]] abilities. Among them are Albert's grandmother, Granny Vogler; his wife Manda, who performs in costume as a man under the alias Mr. Aman; his charismatic assistant, Tubal; and their driver, Simson. Albert proclaims to have discovered [[animal magnetism]]. After leaving a show in [[Copenhagen]], the group travel by carriage through the wilderness into Sweden, and hear screams emanating from the woods. They find an ill man lying on the ground nearby, who introduces himself as Johan Spegel, a former [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]]. The troupe decide to bring him along with them, and he becomes progressively ill. Albert keenly observes Johan as he apparently dies in the carriage.\n\nThe troupe arrive in a village and are met by Consul Egerman who, along with his wife Ottilia, is interested in the [[occult]]. Tubal informs Egerman and his associates that Albert is mute, and the townsmen question the nature of their magic show based on the advertisements promoting it. Dr. Vergerus, the Minister of Health, accuses Albert of practicing [[quackery]] and [[pseudoscience]]; the men privately plan to wager on Albert's abilities. Later, the troupe have dinner with Sara and Sanna, two servants who are enthralled by their presence, and Tubal peddles love [[potion]]s made by Granny. The head cook, Sofia, is impervious to Tubal's bravado, but finds him attractive and solicits him for sex.\n\nAs a storm brews, Sanna grows frightened of the group after Granny tells her she is a [[witch]] who is 200 years old. Meanwhile, Simson flirts with Sara, and the two drink the [[aphrodisiac]] potions together before having sex. Ottilia approaches Albert and tells him that she believes in his powers, and that her husband and the other townsmen criticize him only because they do not understand him. She further explains that she hopes he can make contact with her deceased daughter. After Ottilia leaves, Albert is visited by Johan, who did not die. Johan laments his \"unused\" life to Albert before again dying in his arms; Albert conceals his body in a hidden compartment of a large trunk. Egerman observes the exchange from the shadows and is shaken by it, unsure if he has witnessed an apparition.\n\nDr. Vergeru approaches Manda in her room, her masculine disguise removed. She tells him the troupe are fleeing from the authorities, and admits that the group's entire act is a fraud. Albert listens to their conversation before entering the room, and assaults Vergeru when he goads him. Albert removes his wig, and Manda comforts him, recounting their travails on the road, the home they left behind, and his decision to disguise himself as a mute.\n\nThe following morning, the troupe perform a magic show for the townspeople. Tubal asks Henrietta Starbeck, the wife of the Police Superintendent, to be a volunteer in the show; apparently using magnets, Manda elicits cruel admissions from Henrietta about her husband, publicly humiliating him. Next, Engelson volunteers Antonsson, the stableman, for a trick in which Albert apparently manipulates his body. During the performance, Albert collapses and dies, and Antonsson flees in horror, later committing suicide. Albert's body is placed in his trunk\u2014which, unbeknownst to Vergerus, also contains Johan's body\u2014and brought to the attic for an [[autopsy]].\n\nAfter Vergerus performs a full autopsy, he is terrified when Albert emerges from the shadows, alive. Vergerus demands to know whose body he has performed an autopsy on. Albert responds that it was a \"poor actor\"\u2014it was in fact Johan, who was also in the trunk. Angered, Vergerus remarks the troupe's performance as \"miserable\", and contemptuously pays Albert with a single coin for the entertainment. Manda has Simson hitch their horses so the troupe can leave, but Tubal tells her he wishes to stay with Sofia. Granny also tells Manda she will no longer join them, and plans to live the remainder of her years with the funds she has saved by selling her potions. Upset over Simson's departure, Sara asks Albert and Manda if she can join them, to which they agree. Before they can depart, Albert and Manda are escorted back into the house by police officers. They initially believe they are to be charged with crimes, but, to their surprise, the Police Superintendent Starbeck notifies them that the king wishes to have them perform at the [[Stockholm Palace|Royal Palace]]. Shortly afterward, Albert, Manda, Simson, and Sara depart for Stockholm.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Albert Emanuel Vogler\n* [[Ingrid Thulin]] as Manda Vogler  \n* [[Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand]] as Dr. Vergerus, Minister of Health\n* [[Naima Wifstrand]] as Granny Vogler\n* [[Bengt Ekerot]] as Johan Spegel\n* [[Bibi Andersson]] as Sara\n* [[Birgitta Pettersson]] as Sanna\n* [[Gertrud Fridh]] as Ottilia Egerman\n* [[Lars Ekborg]] as Simson, the coach driver\n* [[Toivo Pawlo]] as Police Superintendent Starbeck\n* [[Erland Josephson]] as Consul Egerman\n* [[\u00c5ke Fridell]] as Tubal\n* [[Sif Ruud]] as Sofia Garp\n* [[Oscar Ljung]] as Antonsson, burly stableman\n* [[Ulla Sj\u00f6blom]] as Henrietta Starbeck\n* [[Axel D\u00fcberg]] as Rustan, young manservant\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=October 2017}}\n''The Magician'' has a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% approval rating]] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Magician|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_magician_1958|website=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Don Druker of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called it \"one of Bergman's most tightly structured and frightening films\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Magician (1958) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1013065-magician/  |website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=January 17, 2017}}</ref> Author and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it \"A thoughtful (and too-long underrated) portrait of a man who is part-faker, part-genius\".<ref name=\"MaltinGreen2010\">{{cite book |last1=Maltin |first1=Leonard |last2=Green |first2=Spencer |last3=Edelman |first3=Rob |title=Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLtaAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Plume |date=January 2010 |page=402 |isbn=978-0-452-29577-3}}</ref> The film won [[Grand Jury Prize (Venice Film Festival)|Grand Jury Prize]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Magician|url=https://www.ingmarbergman.se/en/production/magician|website=ingmarbergman.se}}</ref> New Cinema Award and the Pasinetti Award at [[20th Venice International Film Festival|1959 Venice Film Festival]].
