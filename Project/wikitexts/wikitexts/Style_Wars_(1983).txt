The film has an emphasis on [[graffiti]], although [[bboying]] and [[rapping]] are covered to a lesser extent. The film was originally aired on [[PBS]] television on January 18, 1984, and was subsequently shown in several [[film festival]]s to much acclaim, including the [[Vancouver International Film Festival|Vancouver Film Festival]]. It also won the Grand Jury Prize: Documentary at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Tony Silver, 72, Documentary Director, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/movies/05silver.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=3 January 2012|date=5 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[https://www.sundance.org/blogs/style-wars/ sundance.org]</ref>\n\nThe show captures and includes many historical moments of [[hip hop culture]] during its earliest days in the 1970s onward towards the early 1980s. Many film elements from ''Style Wars'', including outtakes, are now housed at the [[Academy Film Archive]] as part of the Tony Silver Collection.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tony Silver Collection|url=https://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/tony-silver|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe show shows the perspective of writers and their points of view on the subject of graffiti, as well as the views of then [[New York City]] Mayor [[Ed Koch]]. Graffiti writer Case/[[Jeff Brown (artist)|Kase 2]], graffiti writer Skeme and his mother, graffiti \"villain\" Cap, now deceased graffiti writers [[Dondi (Graffiti Artist)|Dondi]], and Shy 147. [[Seen (artist)|Seen]] graffiti documentarian (and co-producer of the film) Henry Chalfant,  breakdancer [[Crazy Legs (dancer)|Crazy Legs]] of [[Rock Steady Crew]], police officers, art critics, subway maintenance workers, as well as several \"people on the street\".\n\nWhile ''Style Wars'' promoted the idea that [[graffiti]] is a form of creative expression, not every person within the film held this same belief. In fact, throughout the film we see ways in which institutions such as the government and law enforcement tried arduously to prevent graffiti in New York City. For example, the city spent a large sum of money on negative subway advertisements that portrayed graffiti as a crime. On top of this, the mayor (who at the time was [[Ed Koch]]) pushed for the building of fences, with the intent of blocking off the entrances to subways, where graffiti artists would create their work. Additionally, he had police guard dogs put into these areas to scare away those who may enter. Both Koch and [[New York City Police Department|The New York City Police Department]] rallied to discourage graffiti.\n\nAnother perspective on graffiti shown in this film is that of well known artists. Many of them state that the reason why these teens spray paint murals on the sides of buildings is because they do not have any other place to do so, not because they want to intentionally break the law. Additionally, these individuals see potential for those that are involved in the culture beyond the streets. In the same way, they appreciate the art while simultaneously disagreeing with exactly how they do it. This in a way makes them middlemen within this documentary.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2009, [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' examined the film:\n\n\"''Style Wars'' is a work of art in its own right too, because it doesn't just record what these artists are doing, it somehow absorbs their spirit and manages to communicate it across the decades so that we can find ourselves, so many years later, in the city, understanding what made it beautiful.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.O.|title=Critics' Picks: 'Style Wars' - The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/movies/1194747016962/critics-picks-style-wars.html|work=Critics' Picks: Style Wars|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nA 2018 review from ''The New Yorker'' also recommends the film, citing its soundtrack and its ability to capture the historical moment it centers on.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.newyorker.com/recommends/watch/style-wars/amp | website = www.newyorker.com | title = The New Yorker Recommends: \"Style Wars\" and the Dawn of Hip-Hop Culture | date = 25 June 2018 | access-date = 20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] referred to the film as the \"defining documentary of early hip-hop culture\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pearce |first1=Sheldon |title=Style Wars Is Still the Defining Documentary of Early Hip-Hop Culture |url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/style-wars-is-still-the-defining-documentary-of-early-hip-hop-culture/ |website=Pitchfork}}</ref>\n\n==Featured graffiti artists==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Demon\n* [[Eric Haze|Se3]]\n* Spank\n* [[DJ Kay Slay|Dez]]\n* Skeme\n* Ces 157\n* MinOne (NE)\n* [[IZ (graffiti artist)|Iz the Wiz]]\n* Quik\n* Sach\n* [[Dondi White|Dondi]]\n* [[Seen (artist)|Seen UA]]\n* Seen TC5\n* Dust \n* [[Zephyr (artist)|Zephyr]]\n* Revolt\n* Wasp 1\n* Noc 167\n* [[Carlos Mare139 Rodriguez|Mare 139]]\n* [[Jeff Brown (artist)|Kase2]] \n* Dee 5 \n* Butch\n* Trap\n* Duro\n* Soe\n* Spin\n* Zone\n* Kid \n* Cap\n* Daze\n* [[Crash (graffiti artist)|Crash]]\n* Paze\n* [[Cey Adams|Cey]]\n* [[Futura 2000|Futura]]\n* [[Fab Five Freddy|Fred]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Featured break dancers==\n*[[Crazy Legs (dancer)|Crazy Legs]]\n*[[Frosty Freeze]]\n*[[Ken Swift]]\n*[[Rock Steady Crew|Lenny Len]]\n*[[Rock Steady Crew|Kippy Dee]]\n*[[Rock Steady Crew|Lil' Crazy Legs]]\n*[[Rock Steady Crew|Take One]]\n*[[Rock Steady Crew|Ty Fly]]\n*[[Rock Steady Crew|Mr. Freeze]]\n*[[Rock Steady Crew|Doze]]\n* Kid Glide\n* Wavy Legs\n* Kid Freeze\n* Nelly Nell\n* Eddie Ed\n* Flip-a-matic\n* Lil' Flip\n* Junior Fastbreak\n* Joly\n\n==Featured music==\n* \"[[8th Wonder (song)|8th Wonder]]\" by [[The Sugarhill Gang]]\n* \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" by [[Grandmaster Flash]]\n* \"[[Beat Bop]]\" by [[Rammellzee]] and [[K-Rob]]\n* \"[[Drop the Bomb|Pump Me Up]]\" by [[Trouble Funk]]\n* \"[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]\" by [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]]\n* \"[[The Fearless Four (band)|Rockin' It]]\" by [[The Fearless Four (band)|The Fearless Four]]\n* \"[[Jam Hot]]\" by [[Johnny Dynell]]\n* \"[[Treacherous Three|Feel The Heartbeat]]\" by [[Treacherous Three]]\n\n==DVD release==\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:TonySilver_HenryChalfant.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Tony Silver (left) and Henry Chalfant (right) during their interview for the DVD\nrelease.]] -->\nThe digitally remastered DVD edition also contains:\n* 23 minutes of outtake footage\n* Commentary and interviews by Tony Silver and Henry Chalfant\n* Interviews with ''Style Wars'' editors Victor Kanefsky and Sam Pollard\n* Art galleries by Blade, Cap, Cey, Crash, Crazy Legs, Daze, [[DJ Kay Slay|Dez]], [[Dondi (Graffiti Artist)|Dondi]], Doze, Duro, Duster, Frosty Freeze, IZ the Wiz, Case/[[Jeff Brown (artist)|Kase 2]], Kel First, Ken Swift, Lee, Mare139, Min One, Noc 167, Paze (Erni), [[Lady Pink]], Quik, [[Rammellzee]], Revolt, Sach, [[Seen (artist)|Seen UA]], Shy 147, Skeme, Rafael 666, Tracy 168, and [[Zephyr (artist)|Zephyr]]\n* Tributes to [[Dondi (Graffiti Artist)|Dondi]] and Shy 147\n* Guest interviews with Blade, Lee, Kel First, [[Seen (artist)|Seen]], [[Tracy 168]], Cap, MIN (NE), QUIK, [[IZ (graffiti artist)|IZ the Wiz]], [[Fab 5 Freddy]], [[Goldie]], [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]], [[DJ Red Alert]], and photographer [[Martha Cooper]]\n\n==2011 restoration auction==\nOn June 9, 2011 it was announced that [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] along with actors [[Brad Pitt]] and [[James Franco]] and director [[Spike Jonze]] were donating items to an [[eBay]] auction that would raise money for restoring the film negatives for ''Style Wars''.
