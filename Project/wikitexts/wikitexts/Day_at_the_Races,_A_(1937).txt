Like their previous [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] feature ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'', this film was a major hit.<ref name=\"nyt2000\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe Standish Sanitarium, owned by Judy Standish, has fallen on hard times. Banker J.D. Morgan, who owns a nearby race track, hotel and nightclub, holds the mortgage on the sanitarium and is attempting to purchase it in order to convert the building into a casino. Judy's faithful employee Tony, suggests asking financial help from the wealthy patient Mrs. Emily Upjohn, who is a [[hypochondriac]]. After being pronounced healthy by the sanitarium's doctors, Mrs. Upjohn threatens to leave the Sanitarium for treatment by Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush. Tony overhears her praise of Hackenbush, who is, unknown to her, a horse doctor. When Tony lies to Mrs. Upjohn, telling her that Hackenbush has been hired to run the Sanitarium, she is elated and informs Judy she will consider helping her financially. Tony contacts Hackenbush in Florida by telegram and when the Doctor arrives he immediately insults the Sanitarium's business manager Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore, being Morgan's stooge, is suspicious of Hackenbush's medical background.\n\nMeanwhile, Judy's beau, singer Gil Stewart, who performs at Morgan's nightclub, has just spent his life savings on a racehorse named Hi-Hat. He hopes the horse, which he purchased from Morgan, will win a race and the money will allow Judy to save the Sanitarium. Hi-Hat is so afraid of Morgan, that he rears in fright whenever he hears his voice. Gil now has no money to pay for Hi-Hat's feed, and he, Tony and Stuffy, Hi-Hat's jockey, have to resort to trickery to fend off the Sheriff who has come to collect money for the feed bill. Tony raises some money by scamming Hackenbush in the \"Tutsi Fruitsy Ice Cream\" scene, giving him a tip on a horse, but all in code, so he has to buy book after book to decipher it.\n\nWhitmore attempts to contact the Florida Medical Board for information on Dr. Hackenbush. Hackenbush intercepts the call, and by impersonating the man in charge of medical records, feigning a hurricane with an electric fan, pretending \nto forget what the call was about and repeatedly calling Whitmore to the dictagraph, he enrages Whitmore until he gives up. That night, at the gala Water Carnival, Gil performs along with Vivien Fay and her ballet, and Tony and Stuffy play the piano and harp respectively. Whitmore attempts to get Hackenbush fired by having Mrs. Upjohn catch him in his suite with Flo, a blonde temptress. Stuffy overhears the plot and informs Tony, so the two attempt to thwart Hackenbush's rendezvous with the floozy by posing as house detectives and then as paperhangers. When Whitmore and Mrs. Upjohn arrive, they have hidden Flo by stuffing her under the sofa cushions.\n\nThe following day, just as Mrs. Upjohn is about to sign an agreement to help Judy, Whitmore brings in the eminent Dr. Leopold X. Steinberg from [[Vienna]], whom he hopes will expose Hackenbush as a fraud. After Mrs. Upjohn agrees to an examination by Steinberg, Hackenbush wants to flee for fear of being exposed; Gil, Tony and Stuffy remind him that Judy still needs his help and persuade him to stay.\n\nAfter making a shambles of Mrs. Upjohn's examination, Hackenbush, Tony, Stuffy and Gil hide out in Hi-Hat's stable, where Judy soon joins them. She is upset by the negative light of the situation; Gil tries to lift her spirits. Near the stable, Stuffy starts sympathizing with a community of poor black folk who believe him to be [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]]. As the number progresses, Morgan, Whitmore and the Sheriff arrive and Hackenbush, Tony and Stuffy try to disguise themselves by painting their faces with grease in [[blackface]]. The attempt fails, everybody runs off and Whitmore finally exposes Hackenbush as a horse doctor with a letter he received from the Florida Medical Board. Hi-Hat hears Morgan's voice and bolts, easily jumping over several obstacles in the way. Judy suggests to Gil that Hi-Hat is a jumper and Gil enters him into the upcoming [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] race.\n\nMorgan, who witnessed Hi-Hat's jumping prowess the night before, tries to prevent him from being entered in the race but fails. Knowing that Hi-Hat is afraid of Morgan, everyone works to make Hi-Hat aware of his presence before reaching the fence.<ref name=\"chi37\"/><ref name=\"lat36\" /><ref name=\"tcmfull\" /> On the last lap, Hi-Hat and Morgan's horse wipe out; when they reach the finish line, it appears that Morgan's horse has won. Stuffy realizes that the mud-covered horses were switched after the accident, and Morgan's jockey was riding Hi-Hat in the finish, thus making Hi-Hat the winner. The black folk arrive at the race and start walking with Gil, Judy, Hackenbush, Tony and Stuffy through the racetrack, all singing the final number.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Groucho Marx]] as Dr Hugo Z.

A major portion of the final screenplay was written by Al Boasberg who also contributed to ''A Night at the Opera'', but due to a bitter disagreement with MGM, he chose not to be given any credit for his work. As they had with ''A Night at the Opera'', the Brothers honed the comic material during a pre-production [[vaudeville]] tour.\n\nGroucho's character was originally named \"Quackenbush\" but was changed to \"Hackenbush\" over threats of lawsuits by several real doctors named Quackenbush.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} In ''My Life with Groucho: A Son's Eye View'', [[Arthur Marx]] relates that in his later years, Groucho increasingly referred to himself by the name Hackenbush.<ref name=\"mylife\"/>\n\nDuring production, [[Irving Thalberg]], who had brought the Marx Brothers to MGM in 1934, died suddenly in September, 1936 of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 37. Thalberg's death left the Marxes without a champion at MGM, and the studio never gave the same level of care and attention to the team they had received under Thalberg. As a result, the Marx Brothers' three later MGM films are generally considered to be vastly inferior to their first two.<ref>Thames, Stephanie.

Two other songs were slated for the film, but ultimately cut . One, \"Dr. Hackenbush\", sung by Groucho about \"what a great doctor he is\" (\"No matter what I treat them for they die from something else\") was performed on the pre-filming tour, but was apparently never shot; the other, \"A Message From The Man In The Moon\", sung by Allan Jones, was shot, but was cut at the last minute because the film was too long. The melody is heard during the opening titles, as some incidental music during the Water Carnival scene, and is \"reprised\" by Groucho during the final scene. The DVD release of the film includes a rediscovered audio recording for the film soundtrack of the song, performed by Allan Jones.\n\nThe film's [[lindy hop]] dance sequence is set to the tune of \"All God's Chillun Got Rhythm\", and featuring [[Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]], including Willamae Ricker, Snookie Beasley, Ella Gibson, George Greenidge, Dot Miller, Johnny Innis, [[Norma Miller]] and Leon James.<ref>[[Frankie Manning|Manning, Frankie]] and Millman, Cynthia. ''Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2007</ref>\n\n\"Cosi-Cosa\", a song sung by Allan Jones in  ''A Night at the Opera'', makes an instrumental cameo at the opening of the climactic racetrack scene.

Greene observed that the film gave him \"a nostalgia for the old cheap rickety sets\" rather than the realistic sets, and although he praised Harpo's performance as \"shin[ing] the brightest\", he complained that the strong realism in O'Sullivan's acting set up a strong juxtaposition against the \"silliness\" of the Marx brothers' antics.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene|first= Graham|author-link= Graham Greene|date= 12 August 1937|title= A Day at the Races/King Solomon's Mines|journal= [[Night and Day (magazine)|Night and Day]]}} (reprinted in: {{cite book |editor-last= Taylor|editor-first= John Russell |editor-link= John Russell Taylor|date= 1980|title= The Pleasure Dome|publisher= Oxford University Press|pages= 160\u2013161|isbn=0192812866}})</ref>\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2000: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] \u2013 #59<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/laughs100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n* 2005: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** Flo Marlowe: \"Oh, hold me closer!
