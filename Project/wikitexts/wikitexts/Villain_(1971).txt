It is based on [[James Barlow (author)|James Barlow]]'s 1968 novel ''[[The Burden of Proof (1968 novel)|The Burden of Proof]]''. ''Villain'' was director [[Michael Tuchner]]'s first feature film after directing in television.<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nAs with other films of ''Villain''<nowiki/>'s same era and genre (''[[Get Carter]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'', for example), some of the violence is quite graphic, especially during the heist scene, and it foreshadows several 1970s cop TV shows such as ''[[The Sweeney]]'', ''[[Target (UK TV series)|Target]]'' and ''[[Special Branch (TV series)|Special Branch]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}\n\n==Plot==\nRuthless [[East End of London|East End]] gangster Vic Dakin has plans for an ambitious raid on the wages van of a plastics factory. This is a departure from Dakin's usual ''[[modus operandi]]'' and the job is further complicated by having to work with fellow gangster Frank Fletcher's firm.\n\nThe film's intricate subplots explore Dakin's sadistic nature, his relationship with small-time associate Wolfie and his irritation at having to work with Fletcher's seemingly weak brother-in-law Ed Lowis. Other parts of the story follow Wolfie's bisexual liaisons with Venetia and Dakin, the [[blackmail]]ing of MP Gerald Draycott to provide an alibi for Dakin and the dogged detectives Bob Matthews and Tom Binney pursuing Dakin.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Richard Burton]] as Vic Dakin\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Wolfe Lissner\n* [[Nigel Davenport]] as Bob Matthews\n* [[Donald Sinden]] as Gerald Draycott\n* [[Fiona Lewis]] as Venetia\n* [[T.

They worked from a treatment by American actor [[Al Lettieri]], renowned for his tough-guy image in films such as ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' as well as for his real-life associations with the New York [[Gambino Family]].\n\nClement and La Frenais based their screenplay on ''Burden of Proof'', a novel by James Barlow<ref>{{cite news|title=CRIME RATION|last=Richardson|first= Maurice|newspaper= [[The Observer]]|date= 21 July 1968|page= 23}}</ref> that the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' had called a \"sizzling, compelling book.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=THRILLERS|last=Rosenzweig|first= A.L.| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date= September 8, 1968|page=14}}</ref> Coincidentally, Barlow mentions Richard Burton in his book in a scene in which Dakin's barrister asks a female witness if she likes Burton in an effort to sow doubt in the jury's mind about her identification evidence. Though several of the main characters and important situations carry over from the novel, Clement and La Frenais altered the plot considerably.\n\n===Casting===\nBurton wrote in his diaries that he was approached to make the film by [[Elliott Kastner]], who had produced ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' with Burton:\n\n<blockquote>It is a racy sadistic London piece about cops and robbers - the kind of 'bang bang - calling all cars' stuff that I've always wanted to do and never have. It could be more than that depending on the director. I play a cockney gangland leader who is very much a mother's boy and takes her to Southend and buys her whelks etc but in the Smoke am a ruthless fiend incarnate but homosexual as well. All ripe stuff.<ref>Burton, 9 July 1970</ref></blockquote>\n\nBurton normally earned $1,000,000 per film but agreed to make ''Villain'' for no salary in exchange for a larger percentage of the profits. \"These are the times of economies for everyone making pictures,\" said Burton, \"And actually working this way - if you can afford it and don't mind waiting for your money - is far more exciting for the actor. You feel more involved in everything rather than just like an old hired hand.\"<ref name=\"los\">Burton Turns Cockney and Cruel for 'Villain' Johnson, Patricia. Los Angeles Times 27 Dec 1970: m1.</ref>\n\nBurton also said that the producers persuaded him to take the part through \"... great American conmanship. One of the producers said to me - 'I bet if I offered you the part of a cockney gangster you'd turn it down, wouldn't you?'. And of course one's immediate response is to say - don't be daft of course I wouldn't - and the next thing you know you've got a script in your hand.\"<ref name=\"los\"/> Burton admitted that he had always wanted to play a gangster, having long admired [[Edward G. Robinson]], James Cagney and [[Humphrey Bogart]]: \"I suppose like the fat man who would have loved to be a ballet dancer.\"<ref name=\"los\"/> During filming, he said: \"I usually play kings or princes or types like that ... I've never played a real villain... Interesting type. I'm not sure about this film. We'll see.\"<ref>The Prime of Mr. Burton? By BERNARD WEINRAUB. New York Times 6 Dec 1970: 171.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Ian McShane]] said that he had mixed feelings about playing Burton's bisexual lover. \"After kissing me, he's going to beat the hell out of me and it's that kind of relationship&nbsp;\u2013 rather hostile. It was very S&M. It wasn't shown in the film. He said to me, 'I'm very glad you're doing this film.' I said, 'So am I Richard.' He said, 'You know why, don't you?' I said, 'Why?' He said, 'You remind me of [[Elizabeth Taylor|Elizabeth]].' I guess that made the kissing easier.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2010/02/09/catching-ian-mcshane |title=Catching Up with Ian McShane &#124; Out Magazine |publisher=Out.com |date=2010-02-09 |access-date=2013-07-28}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot over ten weeks in late 1970. Exteriors were shot on location in areas of [[London]] (such as the [[Winstanley Estate|Winstanley and York Road Estates]]), [[Brighton]], [[Bedford]] and [[Bracknell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067952/locations|title=Villain (1971) - IMDb|website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nBritish exhibitors voted Burton the most popular star at the box office in 1971, although ''Villain'' was not listed among the top ten most popular films.<ref>Peter Waymark. \"Richard Burton top draw in British cinemas.\" Times [London, England] 30 Dec. 1971: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 July 2012.</ref> On 30 May 1971, Burton wrote in his diary that ''Villain'' was \"... a goodish film but so far isn't doing very well in the States but has not yet opened in Britain and the Commonwealth where it should do better.\"<ref>Burton, 30 May 1971</ref> On 21 August 1971, he wrote that the film's director was \"whassisname\" and that he:\n\n<blockquote>Received a cable... from [executive] [[Nat Cohen]] saying the notices for [the film]... superb and great boxoffice, and another cable said we expect a million pounds from UK alone. That means about $1/2 m for me if I remember correctly. There is no accounting for differing tastes of Yanks and English critics. ''Villain'' was received badly in the US and with rapture in the UK. I know it is cockney and therefore difficult for Yanks to follow but one would have thought the critics to be of sufficiently wide education to take it in their stride. The English critics, after all, are not embarrassed when they see a film made in Brooklynese. Anyway I am so delighted that it is doing well in UK. Otherwise I would have doubted E's and my judgement in such matters. I thought it was good and she said she knew it was good. The American reaction was therefore a surprise.<ref>Burton 21 August 1971</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally unfavorable reviews, possibly because it was seen as a veiled portrait of the [[Kray twins]], who had been jailed for [[life imprisonment|life]] in March 1969.<ref>{{cite book|title=British National Cinema|first=Sarah|last= Street|publisher=Routledge|year= 2009|isbn=9781135253349|page=113}}</ref> It has been described as a \"disappointingly histrionic London gangster movie.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Wales and cinema: the first hundred years|first=David|last= Berry|publisher=University of Wales Press|year= 1994|isbn=9780708312568|page=273}}</ref> In 2009, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' named ''Villain'' #2 in a poll of the \"20 Greatest Gangster Movies You've Never Seen* (*Probably).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls040674870/|title=The 20 Greatest Gangster Movies you've never seen \u2026probably by Empire|website=www.imdb.com|access-date=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Burton, Richard, ''The Richard Burton Diaries''.\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0067952|title=Villain}}\n* {{Amg movie|115614|Villain}}\n* [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1362179/index.html ''Villain''] at [[BFI Screenonline]]\n* [http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/7104-DVD-REVIEW-VILLAIN-1971-STARRING-RICHARD-BURTON-AND-IAN-MCSHANE.html \"Villain\"] at cinemaretro.com\n* [http://www.cinedelica.com/2007/08/dvd-review-vill.html \"Villain\"] at Cinedelica.com\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|villain_1971}}\n\n{{Clement and La Frenais}}\n{{Michael Tuchner}}\n\n[[Category:1971 films]]\n[[Category:1971 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s heist films]]\n[[Category:1971 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Bisexuality-related films]]\n[[Category:British crime drama films]]\n[[Category:British gangster films]]\n[[Category:British heist films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films shot at EMI-Elstree Studios]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Tuchner]]\n[[Category:Films set in Brighton]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related drama films]]\n[[Category:EMI Films films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Dick Clement]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ian La Frenais]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s British films]]"}]}}}}
