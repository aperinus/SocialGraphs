It is loosely based on the [[South Korea]]n film ''[[The Quiet Family]]''. The film is a [[Surrealism|surreal]] horror-comedy in the [[farce]] tradition, which includes [[claymation]] sequences, musical and dance numbers, a [[karaoke]]-style sing-along scene, and dream sequences.\n\nThe film won a Special Jury Prize for its director at the 2004 [[Festival international du film fantastique de G\u00e9rardmer|G\u00e9rardmer Film Festival]] and has received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Katakuris are a four-generation family of failures: patriarch Masao Katakuri (Kenji Sawada), his wife Terue (Keiko Matsuzaka), his father Jinpei (Tetsur\u014d Tamba), his formerly criminal son Masayuki (Shinji Takeda), his divorced daughter Shizue (Naomi Nishida), her child Yurie (Tamaki Miyazaki, who narrates the film), and their dog, Pochi. The family uses the father's [[Layoff|redundancy pay]] to purchase a large old home situated on a former garbage dump near [[Mount Fuji]] that they have named the \u2018White Lover's Inn'.  They have the intention of converting it into a [[bed and breakfast]], since the road running nearby is supposed to be expanded up to the house, which would bring many guests and tourists. However, the road hasn't been expanded yet and the Katakuris subsequently have no guests. When one finally shows up, he subsequently commits [[suicide]] during the night, and the Katakuris make the decision to save their business by burying the body and concealing the death. The second guest, a [[Sumo wrestler]], also dies of a heart attack during a tryst with his much younger girlfriend, who also dies.\n\nSomehow, each of their guests ends up dead\u2014by suicide, accident or murder\u2014and pretty soon the bodies in the back yard begin to pile up. The Katakuris soon find themselves sucked into a nightmare of lies and fear.\n\nMeanwhile, the recently divorced daughter falls in love with a man calling himself Richard Sagawa (Kiyoshiro Imawano), a U.S. naval officer who claims to be the nephew of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] herself. Just when Richard stumbles onto a clue that might lead him to uncover the string of disappearing guests, a nearby volcano begins rumbling to life.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
