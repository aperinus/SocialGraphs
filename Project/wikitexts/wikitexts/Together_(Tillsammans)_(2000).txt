Set in a [[Stockholm]] [[Intentional community|commune]] called \"Tillsammans\" (Swedish for \"Together\") in 1975, it is a satirical view of socialist values and a bittersweet comedy. A sequel titled ''Together 99'' is set to be filmed in 2022.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dams|first=Tim|date=20 May 2022|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/lukas-moodysson-preps-together-sequel-with-memfis-film/5170881.article|title=Lukas Moodysson preps 'Together' sequel with Memfis Film|work=Screen Daily|access-date=16 June 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Together'' is set in one of the [[Commune (intentional community)|sharehome communes]] that was created around [[Stockholm]] in the 1970s. Loosely led by the kind-natured G\u00f6ran, who will do anything to avoid a conflict, the group spend their time arguing about left-wing politics and other more practical issues, such as whether doing the dishes is [[bourgeois]]. The sharehome's dynamics are significantly shaken when G\u00f6ran's sister, Elisabeth, leaves her violent husband Rolf and moves in, bringing her two children Eva and Stefan.\n\nSelf-declared lesbian Anna lives in the commune with her ex-husband Lasse and their son Tet (named after the [[Tet offensive]]), who befriends Stefan. The two play games such as \"torture the [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] victim\" where, in the spirit of equality, they take turns at being [[Augusto Pinochet]]. Eva meanwhile befriends a lonely boy across the street named Fredrik; his family appears conventional on the surface but proves to be even more dysfunctional than the commune of which they so openly disapprove. The children are portrayed as sidelined by everyone in the film, from the new school where they are bullied to the parents who, while genuinely loving, are too busy experimenting with their own freedom to show it.\n\nElisabeth's husband Rolf makes a concerted effort to clean up his act, although not before getting [[drunk]] and arrested, leaving his children stranded on a roadside after a disastrous meal in a Chinese restaurant. Further relationship problems are found with Klas, who is desperately in love with Lasse, and between G\u00f6ran and his selfish and immature girlfriend, who wants the benefits of an [[open relationship]] but not the responsibilities.\n\n==Selected cast==\n* [[Lisa Lindgren (Swedish actress)|Lisa Lindgren]] as Elisabeth\n* [[Michael Nyqvist]] as Rolf, Elisabeth's husband\n* [[Emma Samuelsson (actress)|Emma Samuelsson]] as Eva, Elisabeth's and Rolf's daughter\n* [[Sam Kessel]] as Stefan, Elisabeth's and Rolf's son\n* [[Gustaf Hammarsten]] as G\u00f6ran, Elisabeth's brother\n* [[Jessica Liedberg]] as Anna\n* [[Ola Rapace]] as Lasse\n* [[Axel Zuber]] as Tet, Anna and Lasse's son\n* [[Shanti Roney]] as Klas\n* [[Olle Sarri]] as Erik Andersson\n* [[Anja Lundqvist]] as Lena, G\u00f6ran's girlfriend\n* [[Sten Ljunggren]] as Birger\n* [[Cecilia Frode]] as Signe\n* Lars Frode as Sigvard\n* Emil Moodysson as M\u00e5ne\n* [[Henrik Lundstr\u00f6m]] as Fredrik\n\n==Production==\nAlthough set in [[Stockholm]] in eastern Sweden, the film was actually shot in western Sweden, mainly in cities [[Trollh\u00e4ttan]] and [[Gothenburg]]. Filming began on 27 October 1999 and wrapped 20 December 1999. Artist [[Carl Johan De Geer]] created the film's contemporary environments.\n\nThe character \"Birger\" had previously appeared in another film from the same director. Sten Ljunggren had also played him in the short film '[[Talk (short film)|Talk]]' (Bara prata lite) in 1997.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received critical acclaim.
