Earl is an impoverished, bumbling [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] whose offense was stuffing [[fortune cookies]] with messages demanding the release from death row of the equally overblown murder convictees [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]. The [[Yellow press]] has painted Earl as another Communist threat from [[Moscow]], meaning that Chicago citizens are anxious to see him also put to death.\n\nEarl has not left the jail, and enters the prison pressroom while Hildy is alone there.  Hildy cannot resist the lure of what could be the biggest [[Scoop (term)|scoop]] of what remains of his career.  Ruthless, [[egomania]]cal [[managing editor]] Walter Burns ([[Walter Matthau]]), desperate to keep Hildy on the job, encourages him to cover the story, frustrating Peggy, who is eager to catch their train.  When Earl is in danger of being discovered, Mollie Malloy ([[Carol Burnett]]), a self-described \"$2 [[Prostitution|whore]] from [[Division Street (Chicago)|Division Street]]\" who befriended Earl, creates a distraction by leaping from the third-floor window.\n\nWhen Earl is caught, Hildy and Walter are arrested for aiding and abetting a fugitive, but are released when they discover that the mayor and sheriff colluded to conceal Earl's last-minute [[Pardon#Related concepts|reprieve]] by the governor.  Walter grudgingly accepts that he is losing his ace reporter and presents him with a watch as a token of his appreciation.  Hildy and Peggy set off to get married, and Walter telegraphs the next railway station to alert them that the man who stole his watch is on the inbound train and should be apprehended by the police.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Walter Burns\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Peggy Grant\n* [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Sheriff \"Honest Pete\" Hartman\n* [[David Wayne]] as Roy Bensinger\n* [[Allen Garfield]] as Kruger\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Murphy\n* [[Herb Edelman]] as Schwartz\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Earl Williams\n* [[Carol Burnett]] as Mollie Malloy\n* [[Martin Gabel]] as Dr. Max J.

It was his last film role, he died in July 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://travsd.wordpress.com/2019/04/09/allen-jenkins-fifty-years-a-mug/|title=Allen Jenkins: Fifty Years a Mug|date=9 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe original play had been adapted for the screen [[The Front Page (1931 film)|in 1931]] and as ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' in 1940 (and would be remade once more with 1987's ''[[Switching Channels]]''.) Billy Wilder was quoted by his biographer [[Charlotte Chandler]] as saying, \"I'm against remakes in general ... because if a picture is good, you shouldn't remake it, and if it's lousy, ''why'' remake it? ... It was not one of my pictures I was particularly proud of.\"{{sfn|Chandler|Wilder|2004|pages=278\u2013285}}\n\nAfter years of producing his films, he passed producing chores to [[Paul Monash]] and concentrate on screenwriting and directing when [[Jennings Lang]] suggested he film a new adaptation of ''The Front Page'' for [[Universal Pictures]]. The idea appealed to Wilder, a newspaperman in his younger days, who recalled, \"A reporter was a glamorous fellow in those days, the way he wore a hat, and a raincoat, and a swagger, and had his camaraderie with fellow reporters, with local police, always hot on the tail of tips from them and from the fringes of the underworld.\" Whereas the two earlier screen adaptations of the play were set in their contemporary times, Wilder decided his would be a [[period piece]] set in 1929, primarily because the daily newspaper was no longer the dominant news medium in 1974.{{sfn|Chandler|Wilder|2004|pages=278\u2013285}}\n\nWilder hired [[Henry Bumstead]] as [[production designer]]. For exterior shots, Bumstead suggested Wilder film in [[San Francisco]], where the buildings were a better match for 1920s Chicago than was [[Los Angeles]]. The final scene on the train was filmed in San Francisco, where a railroad enthusiast provided a vintage railway car for the setting.{{sfn|Chandler|Wilder|2004|pages=278\u2013285}} The interior shot of the theater in an earlier scene was done at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. The opening credits scenes were filmed at the ''[[Los Angeles Herald Examiner]]''.\n\nWilder and Diamond insisted their dialogue be delivered exactly as written and clearly enough to be understood easily. [[Jack Lemmon]], who portrayed Hildy Johnson, later said, \"I had one regret about the film. Billy would not let us overlap our lines more. I think that would have made it better ... I feel it's a piece in which you ''must'' overlap. But Billy, the writer, wanted to hear all of the words clearly, and he wanted the audience to hear the words. I would have liked to overlap to the point where you lost some of the dialogue.\"{{sfn|Chandler|Wilder|2004|pages=278\u2013285}}\n\nTwo characters not in the play were added to the film. Dr. Eggelhofer, a character only mentioned in the play, appears in the film as an eccentric, sex-obsessed Freudian psychiatrist whose theories are utterly incomprehensible to Williams.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|pages=308}} The other character added is Rudy Keppler, an young reporter who is seduced in the bathroom by the older reporter Roy Bensinger.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|pages=308}} In the play, the character of Bensinger was portrayed as effeminate and rather high-strung, suggesting he is gay, but in the film, he is portrayed as a stereotypical campy homosexual whose effeminacy and mincing manners leave no doubt about his sexuality even if he is not explicitly described as gay.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|pages=308}} Diamond and Wilder also worked in several \"in jokes\" to the film, such as describing Burns as still being upset with the loss of his star reporter [[Ben Hecht]] (who did work as a newsman in 1920s Chicago) to a Hollywood studio.{{sfn|Phillips|2010|pages=307}} &nbsp;\n\nBecause of Wilder's tendency to \"cut in the camera\", a form of spontaneous editing that results in a minimal footage being shot, editor [[Ralph E. Winters]] was able to assemble a rough cut of the film four days after principal photography was completed.{{sfn|Chandler|Wilder|2004|pages=278\u2013285}}\n\nThe film was Wilder's first to show a financial return since ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (1966), and his last box office hit of any significance. The director regretted not sticking to his instincts over remakes.{{sfn|Chandler|Wilder|2004|pages=278\u2013285}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film earned North American theatrical rentals of $7,460,000.<ref>\"All-time Film Rental Champs\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p 44</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought the story was \"a natural\" for Wilder and Diamond, who \"have a special (and, to my mind, very appealing) appreciation for vulgar, brilliant con artists of monumental tackiness.\" He continued, \"Even though the mechanics and demands of movie-making slow what should be the furious tempo, this ''Front Page'' displays a giddy bitterness that is rare in any films except those of Mr. Wilder. It is also, much of the time, extremely funny.\" He described Walter Matthau and Austin Pendleton as \"marvelous\" and added, \"Mr. Lemmon is comparatively reserved as the flamboyant Hildy, never quite letting go of his familiar comic personality to become dominated by the lunacies of the farce. He always remains a little outside it, acting. Carol Burnett has an even tougher time as Molly Malloy . . . This role may well be impossible, however, since it requires the actress to play for straight [[melodrama]] while everyone around her is going for laughs . . . Mr. Wilder has great fun with the period newspaper detail . . . and admires his various supporting actors to such an extent that he allows them to play as broadly as they could possibly desire.\" He concluded, \"The hysteria is not as consistent as one might wish, nor, indeed, as epic as in Mr. Wilder's own ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. The cohesive force is, instead, the director's fondness for frauds, which, I suspect, is really an admiration for people who barrel on through life completely intimidating those who should know better.\"<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Movie Review The Front Page (1974) Wilder's Uneven Film of 'Front Page':The Cast|author-link=Vincent Canby|first=Vincent|last=Canby|date=December 19, 1974|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9406E6D91E31EF34BC4152DFB467838F669EDE}}</ref>\n\nThe British television network [[Channel 4]] called it the \"least satisfying screen adaptation of Hecht and MacArthur's play,\" saying it \"adds little to the mix other than a bit of choice language. The direction is depressingly flat and stagy, Wilder running on empty. While it is easy to see why he was attracted to this material . . . he just does not seem to have the energy here to do it justice. Matthau and Lemmon put in their usual faultless turns, but cannot lift a pervading air of pointlessness.\"<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=103648&section=review Channel 4 review]</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' rated the film 2{{frac|1|2}} out of four stars and noted, \"This slick remake of the ebullient original falls short of being the film it could have been, despite the presence of master filmmaker Wilder and his engaging costars . . . Despite the obvious charismatic interaction between Lemmon and Matthau, the film is oddly stilted. In an overly emphatic turn, the miscast Burnett easily gives the most awful performance of her career. She projects only one emotion - a gratingly annoying hysteria. One never enjoys the film so much as when her character throws herself out of a window.\"<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/page/review/123962 ''TV Guide'' review]</ref>\n\nBurnett said in ''This Time Together'' that she was so displeased with her performance that when she was on an airplane where the film was shown, she apologized on the plane's intercom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://decoy.tvpassport.com/q_a/q-im-trying-remember-name-old-movie-it-starred-odd-couple-stars-reporters-newspaper-i-think-ther?subid=national-00001|title=TV Q & A|last=Thomlison|first=Adam|publisher=TV Media|access-date=2013-06-24}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Front Page'' holds a rating of 59% from 29 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1037105-front_page|title=The Front Page|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe film was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy]] but lost to ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', and Lemmon and Matthau, competing with each other for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], lost to [[Art Carney]] in ''[[Harry and Tonto]]''.\n\nWilder and Diamond were nominated for the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium]] but lost to [[Lionel Chetwynd]] and [[Mordecai Richler]] for ''[[The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (film)|The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.org/awards/awardssub.aspx?id=1551|title=Writers Guild of America archives|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001153001/http://www.wga.org/awards/awardssub.aspx?id=1551|archive-date=2006-10-01}}</ref>\n\nWilder won the [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Award]] for Best Director of a Foreign Film, and Lemmon and Matthau shared Best Foreign Actor honors with [[Burt Lancaster]] for ''[[Conversation Piece (film)|Conversation Piece]]''.\n\n==Home media==\n[[GoodTimes Entertainment]] released the Region 1 DVD on June 17, 1998.

Moore, an African-American, is further stunned by the riotous reaction to the movie by the (mostly white) audience in the theater. Moore is ironically inspired by this experience (and the lack of films made by and for African Americans) to make his own film (1975's ''[[Dolemite]]''.)\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1974]]\n\n==Trivia==\nThe song performed by Peggy Grant is \"[[Button Up Your Overcoat|Button up your overcoat]]\",  published in [[1928 in music|1928]], and was originally first introduced by vocalist [[Ruth Etting]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n* {{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Charlotte|last2=Wilder|first2=Billy|author-link2=Billy Wilder|title=Nobody's Perfect: Billy Wilder, A Personal Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation|Applause Theatre and Cinema Books]]|year=2004|isbn=978-1557836328|pages=278\u2013285}}\n*{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Gene|title=Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder|location=Lexington|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2010|isbn=978-0813173672}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0071524|title=The Front Page}}\n*{{AFI film|id=67639|title=The Front Page}}\n*{{TCMDb title|id=75755|title=The Front Page}}\n*{{Letterboxd film}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|1037105_front_page}}\n*{{amg title|id=18777|title=The Front Page}}\n\n{{Billy Wilder}}\n{{The Front Page}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Front Page}}\n[[Category:1974 films]]\n[[Category:1970s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Billy Wilder]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Billy May]]\n[[Category:Films set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1929]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Billy Wilder]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1974 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1974 drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
