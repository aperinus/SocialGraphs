The first three books in the 12-part series -- ''Cirque du Freak'', ''The Vampire\u2019s Assistant'', and ''Tunnels Of Blood''\u2014inspired the film. The film received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\nIn an unnamed American town, teenagers Darren Shan and Steve Leonard, Darren's more rebellious best friend and classmate, sneak out at night to attend the Cirque du Freak freak show at a local theater. During the performance, Steve recognizes one of the troupe's members, Larten Crepsley, as a vampire who is over a hundred years old, prompting him to try to find Crepsley after the show. Meanwhile, Darren is fascinated by Crepsley's spider, Madam Octa and goes backstage, impulsively steals her, but is forced to hide when Crepsley returns to his green room. Steve arrives, begging to be made into a vampire, but Crepsley refuses after tasting Steve's blood, which he says \"tastes of evil.\" When Crepsley realizes that Madam Octa was stolen, Darren flees from the theater with Crepsley in pursuit. He escapes when the mysterious Mr. Tiny arrives in his limousine, accompanied by Murlough. The latter is unimpressed with Darren, dismissing him as a \"bag of blood,\" but Tiny promises to stay in touch after dropping Darren off at his home.\n\nThe following day, Darren secretly brings Madam Octa to school, where she escapes. After a struggle in a crowded hallway, Madam Octa bites Steve on the cheek, leaving him to succumb to her deadly venom in the hospital. Darren returns to the theater and begs Crepsley for help. Initially annoyed and contemptuous, Crepsley agrees on the condition that Darren becomes a half-vampire\u2014and Crepsley's personal assistant. Darren agrees, only to flee while Crepsley administers the  antidote to Steve. However, after nearly attacking his own sister out of vampiric bloodlust, Darren decides to leave with Crepsley, who uses magic to stage Darren's death of a fall from a roof.\n\nAfter being buried in a cemetery, Crepsley digs up the grave to free Darren, but Murlough ambushes them. Crepsley fights him off and the two go to the Cirque du Freak campgrounds, where Darren meets Evra Von, the snake boy, and Rebecca, the monkey girl. Meanwhile, Steve, contemplating suicide after losing his best friend, is stopped by Tiny, who offers him a chance to become a Vampaneze, a race of vampires who\u2014unlike Crepsley and others\u2014murder their victims to feed on their blood. Steve agrees, proceeding to kill high school history teacher Mr. Kersey with Murlough's help. Trying to instigate a confrontation between Steve and Darren, Tiny kidnaps Rebecca and Darren's family, leaving a flyer for the Cirque du Freak at Darren's former home.\n\nAt the theater, Crepsley and Murlough fight while Darren fights with Steve but Darren's refusal to feed weakens him. Rebecca frees herself using her monkey tail and offers Darren a taste of her blood. After some hesitation, he accepts. Crepsley stabs Murlough, and with his dying words, Murlough declares that the truce between the two vampire clans has been broken. Tiny (who had been watching from the balcony via opera glasses) eventually separates Steve and Darren. Darren asks Steve to stay with him, but Steve refuses, saying, \"I have my destiny and you have yours.\" Steve then leaves with Tiny, who plans to groom him as a Vampaneze leader.\n\nCrepsley returns Darren's family to their home, hypnotizing them so they'll forget what they've been through. Rebecca and Darren share a heartfelt kiss before returning to the campgrounds, where Crepsley gives Darren a coffin to sleep in, and Darren accepts his new life as a member of the Cirque du Freak.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of characters from The Saga of Darren Shan}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chris Massoglia]] as [[List of characters from The Saga of Darren Shan#Vampires|Darren Shan]]<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450405/ Cirque du Freak (2008)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* [[John C.

Trevon Flores, a local basketball player who stands 6'10\" tall and weighs 210 pounds, was used cast as the body double. Watanabe also utilized dialogue coaches [[Kathleen S.
