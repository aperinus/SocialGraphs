The original music score was composed by [[James Horner]] based on a song composed by [[Loreena McKennitt]]. The film was marketed with the tagline \"Some fantasies go too far.\"\n\n==Plot==\n[[Assistant District Attorney]] David Corelli (Caruso) is called to the murder scene of prominent businessman Kyle Medford, found bludgeoned to death in his [[San Francisco]] home by an antique hatchet. Police detectives Bob Hargrove and Petey Vesko find photographs in Medford's safe of [[Governor of California|Governor]] Lew Edwards (Crenna) having sex with a prostitute, later identified as Patrice Jacinto. During questioning, Patrice reveals that she and several other women were paid by Medford to have sex with wealthy men at his beach house in [[Pacifica, California|Pacifica]]. She also informs them that the most desired prostitute among the clients was a woman known only as \"Jade\". In a private meeting with Governor Edwards and aide Bill Barrett, Corelli is warned not to make the photographs public. Corelli is then almost killed when his brake line is deliberately cut and his vehicle goes out of control while driving down a steep hill.\n\nThe detectives find fingerprints on the hatchet belonging to Katrina Gavin, a [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]] and former lover of Corelli's who eventually married his close friend, defense attorney Matt Gavin. When interviewed, Katrina explains that Medford gave her a tour of his antique collection on the day in question, but claims to have nothing to do with his death. At Medford's beach house, Corelli and the detectives find various drugs, alcohol, and [[sex toy]]s, as well as hidden video cameras. They conclude Medford was recording the sex sessions to [[blackmail]] the men. Corelli is shocked to discover Katrina on one of the tapes; the revelation renews the detectives' interest in her as a suspect.\n\nPatrice arranges to meet Corelli at a restaurant to discuss Jade's identity, but she is murdered in a [[hit-and-run]] attack by an unknown assailant driving a black [[Ford Thunderbird (tenth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. Corelli, witnessing the murder first-hand, chases the assailants' vehicle in vain. The detectives discover the Gavins own a similar Thunderbird, so suspect Katrina of killing Patrice, but then find the actual vehicle used in the hit-and-run abandoned, suggesting that someone is trying to frame Katrina. Katrina is again brought in for questioning and is shown the sex tape. Matt, in his capacity as her attorney, ends the interrogation before she fully explains her involvement. When confronted at their home, Katrina admits to her husband that she did have sex with the man on the tape, due in part to her knowledge of Matt's many affairs.\n\nKatrina visits Corelli at his apartment and tries unsuccessfully to seduce him. She admits having felt sexually liberated by sleeping with several men at the beach house. Meanwhile, the only witness to identify Katrina at the Pacifica beach house, a man named Henderson, is found murdered. Corelli informs the detectives at the crime scene that Katrina could not have killed him because he was with her at the time. Back at his apartment, Corelli is confronted by Matt, who holds him at gunpoint and angrily accuses him of sleeping with Katrina. Corelli denies it and persuades Matt that his wife's life is in danger. They hurry to the Gavin home, where Det. Hargrove, Barrett, and Pat Callendar have come to kill Katrina and search for the incriminating photos of the governor. Callendar is shot by Matt, but Barrett manages to escape. In the meantime, Hargrove tries to rape and kill Katrina, but Corelli and Matt arrive and Hargrove is shot by Matt.\n\nCorelli goes to the governor for a guarantee of Katrina's safety by leveraging his possession of the photographs. The governor denies any knowledge of Hargrove or Callendar's actions, but insinuates they were both acting on his behalf. As she gets ready for bed at home, Katrina finds photographs laid out in her bathroom of her having sex at the beach house. Matt admits to Katrina that he killed Medford, certain that Medford eventually would blackmail them both. He then tells Katrina to \"introduce me to Jade\" the next time they \"make love\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Cast list is in final film credit order-->\n{{castlist|\n* [[David Caruso]] as ADA David Corelli\n* [[Linda Fiorentino]] as Anna  Katrina Maxwell-Gavin / Jade\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Matt Gavin\n* [[Richard Crenna]] as Gov.

After his sudden departure from ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', [[David Caruso]] was hoping to break through with a film career and accepted the role. The part of Matt Gavin was offered to [[Kenneth Branagh]], before [[Chazz Palminteri]] was eventually cast. [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Sharon Stone]] were considered to play Katrina Gavin, but both rejected it. [[Linda Fiorentino]] was then asked, but she originally turned it down because she did not want to play a prostitute, but changed her mind once her character was changed through rewrites.\n\nAccording to [[Joe Eszterhas]]' autobiography, ''Hollywood Animal'', William Friedkin changed the script so much that Eszterhas threatened to remove his name from the credits. He claimed Paramount settled by giving him a \"blind script deal\" worth $2\u20134 million.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eszterhas|first=Joe|title=Hollywood Animal|publisher=Random House Entertainment.|year=2004|isbn=3-8090-3027-9}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview in [[Linda Ruth Williams]]' book ''The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema'', Friedkin admitted that he had virtually rewritten the script.<ref>{{cite book|last=William|first=Linda Ruth|title=The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|year=2005|page=139|isbn=0-253-21836-5}}</ref> Friedkin also said that ''Jade'' was the favorite of all the films he had made.<ref>{{cite book|last=William|first=Linda Ruth|title=The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|year=2005|page=140|isbn=0-253-21836-5}}</ref> He later wrote the movie had \"a terrific cast.

I felt I had let down the actors, the studio, and most of all, Sherry ([[Sherry Lansing]], his wife, an executive at Paramount). I went into a deep funk. Was it the ''Exorcist'' curse, as many have suggested, a poor choice of material, or simply that whatever talent I had was ephemeral? Maybe all of the above.\"<ref>Friedkin p 414</ref>\n\nMichael Biehn was not fond of the film: \"Well, on ''Jade'', I had no idea what I was doing. I don't think anybody had any idea what they were doing. It was a Joe Eszterhas script. To me, none of it ever really made any sense. I didn't realize until the read-through that I was the bad guy in it. It was like a jumbled mess. And the movie came out a mess, too. It had great people on it, though. It had William Friedkin directing, it had Chazz Palmenteri, who was nominated that year for an Academy Award, it had Linda Fiorentino, who had just come out with that famous movie she did ''[[The Last Seduction]]'', and it had David Caruso, who's a brilliant actor when given the right material, and a very smart guy.

The planned unrated versions for [[DVD]], [[LaserDisc]], and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] were cancelled, due to poor sales of the unrated VHS version.\n\nIn one alternate version of ''Jade'', rather than having Gavin get away with murder, Corelli returns to the house, clearly planning to place him under arrest.\n\nCable channels [[USA Network|USA]], [[Cinemax]], and [[WGN America|WGN]] air the director's cut, including some scenes originally cut to avoid a possible NC-17 rating and for length.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Friedkin, William, ''The Friedkin Connection'', Harper Collins 2013 {{ISBN needed|date=September 2021}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0113451|Jade}}\n* {{Allrovi movie|135460|Jade}}\n* {{Mojo title|jade|Jade}}\n\n{{William Friedkin}}\n{{Joe Eszterhas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jade}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s erotic thriller films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by William Friedkin]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Joe Eszterhas]]\n[[Category:American erotic thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:American police detective films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert Evans]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
