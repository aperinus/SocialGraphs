The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Gene Quintano]] and [[Jim Kouf]] based on a true story by United States Army major Jim Morris. The film stars [[Danny Glover]] and [[Ray Liotta]] as [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] during the [[Vietnam War]] in 1968, who attempt to transport an elephant through jungle terrain to a local South Vietnamese village which in turn helps American forces monitor [[Viet Cong]] activity. The film deals broadly with themes of war, politics and animal welfare.\n\nA joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Interscope Communications]] and [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]]. It was distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] for home media.\n\n''Operation Dumbo Drop'' premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on July 28, 1995, grossing $24,670,346 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was a moderate financial success after its theatrical run, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the Vietnam War in 1968, [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] Captain Sam Cahill ([[Danny Glover]]) has been working hard to create good relations between the United States and [[Degar|Montagnard Vietnamese]] in the village of Dak Nhe, which occupies an important observation point near the clandestine [[Ho Chi Minh trail]]. Cahill is coming close to his discharge, and explains to his successor, Captain T.C. Doyle ([[Ray Liotta]]), the delicate nature of Vietnamese customs as well as the counterintelligence involving covert enemy activity.\n\nIn a lapse of judgment with surrounding village children, a child steals a [[Nestl\u00e9 Crunch]] bar from Doyle's backpack; the wrapper, when found, lets the [[People's Army of Vietnam|NVA]] know of the local villagers' cooperation with the Americans. As punishment, Brigadier Nguyen (Hoang Ly) of the NVA, orders his subordinate, Captain Quang (Vo Trung Anh), to kill the villagers' elephant right before a spiritual festival. To aid the villagers, Cahill promises to replace the slain elephant before their upcoming ceremony while Doyle (whom the villagers blame for the elephant's death) reluctantly agrees to help.\n\nAt camp, Major Pederson ([[Marshall Bell]]) assigns Cahill and Doyle, with Doyle in command, to secure and deliver a new elephant to the villagers, as well as two soldiers, Specialist 4 Harvey Ashford ([[Doug E. Doug]]) and Specialist 5 Lawrence Farley ([[Corin Nemec]]). Cahill blackmails Chief Warrant Officer 3 David Poole ([[Denis Leary]]) into helping as well. They purchase an elephant known as Bo Tat from a local Vietnamese trader ([[James Hong]]). They also agree to take along Bo Tat's child handler, Linh (Dinh Thien Le), who has experience with verbal commands in guiding the elephant. Along the way, NVA soldiers attempt to stop them. Following a failed air transport, the soldiers use a combination of methods to reach [[Pleiku Air Base]] before the final stage of their journey to Dak Nhe.\n\nAt Pleiku Air Base, Major Pederson notifies the captains that the mission has been cancelled. The Ho Chi Minh Trail has changed direction, and they no longer need the support of the local village. A [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] airstrip near Dak Nhe has already been destroyed by the NVA, making a landing by plane impossible. Against regulations, they commandeer a cargo aircraft, intending to parachute themselves and Bo Tat into Dak Nhe. The aircraft comes under enemy fire, forcing them and Bo Tat to parachute out early. Quang, having been ordered by Nguyen to kill Bo Tat, refuses to do so this time, explaining \"I did not join this army to shoot elephants, especially ones that fly.\"\n\nThe soldiers land unharmed in and around the village, except for Ashford, who gets stuck in a tree and becomes separated from the rest.\n\nNVA forces suddenly appear, threatening to take the remaining soldiers hostage and kill the elephant. Ashford, however, is able to free himself and create a diversion long enough to distract and incapacitate the NVA troops. The villagers hold their festival with Bo Tat in the place of honor. When Cahill radios the air base, he is informed that the supply route has changed direction again, back to the village. That fact, combined with their capture of high-ranking enemy officers, has prompted the U.S. Army to sanction their relief mission ''post-facto'', and confirm Doyle's original mission, to replace Cahill as liaison officer in the village.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Captain Sam Cahill\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Captain T.C.

Sam Cahill]]\nThe premise of ''Operation Dumbo Drop'' is based on the true story relating to the cooperation of South Vietnamese villagers and the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War in the late 1960s.<ref name=crimson>{{cite news |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1995/8/1/operation-dumbo-drop-two-tons-of/ |title=Operation Dumbo Drop: Two Tons of Weak Humor |newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |access-date=2010-08-18}}</ref> The U.S. Army viewed many villages as having a strategic value due to their proximity to enemy weapons supply routes, such as the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]].<ref name=\"crimson\" /> Elephants found in villages were typically the primary source of farm labor. To appease hostile villagers, the U.S. offered elephants as a token of appreciation. According to actor Glover, one such operation took place specifically on April 4, 1968, but received fairly little coverage due to the death on the same day of a Vietnamese military leader and also the [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in Memphis.<ref name=\"crimson\" /> The film is based on a story depicted by retired United States Army Major Jim Morris, who related his experiences surrounding the elephant air-drops during the war.\n\nA 26-year-old [[Asian elephant]] [[Tai (elephant)|Tai]] was used for the part of ''Bo Tat''. The female elephant was chosen for the part because of her calm demeanor and friendly disposition, which allowed her to be placid and relaxed during scenes with simulated gunfire.<ref name=\"humane\">{{cite web |url=https://humanehollywood.org/movies/moviereviews.phtml?fid=7056 |title=Operation Dumbo Drop |publisher=American Humane |access-date=2010-08-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301025408/http://www.ahafilm.info/movies/moviereviews.phtml?fid=7056 |archive-date=March 1, 2007 }}</ref> Many depictions in the film such as the elephant being sedated and lying down or following that, moving her legs and standing up were actually accomplished with an animal trainer.<ref name=\"humane\" />\n\n=== Set design and filming ===\nPrincipal filming took place primarily on location in [[Thailand]].<ref name=\"movies.yahoo.com\"/> Other filming locations included film studios in Los Angeles, California and Miami, Florida.<ref name=\"movies.yahoo.com\"/>\n \n[[File:Asian elephant - melbourne zoo.jpg|165px|thumb|left|An [[Asian elephant]] similar to one used during filming]]\nCertain scenes where the elephant was shown aboard a marine boat actually had [[I-beam]]s under the deck to support the animal. Additionally, ballast was added to the boat to keep it afloat.<ref name=\"humane\" /> One of the later scenes where the elephant was supposedly aboard the aircraft while under gun and missile fire was filmed in cuts, with both fake elephants and a mechanical elephant being used in the jump. The real elephant was used only for close-ups.<ref name=\"humane\" />\n\nDuring the village food cart scene, a trainer as an extra, ran alongside the elephant telling her to keep moving. There was also another trainer in front of her encouraging her constant movement and ensuring that nothing got in her path. Wire was attached to crates and tables to pull them over as the elephant ran by, making it appear as though she were knocking everything aside.<ref name=\"humane\" /> In a flashback scene, the character of Linh sees an elephant being shot, as he tells of how his parents were killed. The film crew accomplished this feat by instructing the trainer to tell the elephant to lie down, while then shooting the scene in slow motion.<ref name=\"humane\" /> To ensure the health of the elephant, her food and water, including her bathing water, was shipped from the U.S. to Thailand throughout the production. Furthermore, she was bathed in purified water every day. Young Thai men were hired to hold umbrellas over the elephant when the cameras were not shooting. Throughout filming, almost everything the elephant walked on was reinforced with timber and steel.<ref name=\"humane\" /> Twelve elephants were also used as extras in the jungle mountain scenes.<ref name=\"humane\" />\n\nAccording to Denis Leary, \"The movie was so painstakingly terrible \u2014 because it took a long time to shoot \u2014 that all of us actually had pictures of the things that we were gonna buy with our money to keep us going. I had a picture of this property in [[Connecticut]].
