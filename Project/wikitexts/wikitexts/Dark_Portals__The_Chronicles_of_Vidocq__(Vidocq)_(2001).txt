The man lures Vidocq into a furnace room at a glass factory, and after a long fight, pushes him into the furnace. Hanging onto the ledge, Vidocq asks him to reveal his face. The masked man obliges, and Vidocq lets go, falling into the fire.\n\nJournalist \u00c9tienne Boisset goes to Vidocq's colleague, Ren\u00e9 Nimier, asking for background to help write Vidocq's biography. Boisset states that he plans to find Vidocq's murderer. Nimier tells him that Lautrennes, Paris' chief of police, asked the pair to investigate the deaths of Belmont and Veraldi, the owners of a cannon factory. Lautrennes believes this is an attempt to undermine the French military in an [[July Revolution|unstable political climate]]. Belmont and Veraldi had died in a lightning strike, but during the investigation, Vidocq and Nimier see the powder on a factory worker's clothes catch fire. They interrogate the servant responsible for maintaining Belmont's and Veraldi's suits, who confesses that he received a letter, with cash, ordering him not to clean their jackets. The investigators realize that the lightning would need to be attracted to the men and find metallic pins, decorated with monkey heads, inserted into their hats.\n\nLautrennes orders one of his men, Tauzet, to investigate Vidocq's death. For his part, Boisset sneaks into Nimier's office and retrieves the monkey-head pins. He traces the design to Preah, a dancer in a brothel, and Vidocq's lover. She tells him that Vidocq also tracked her down, and that she told Vidocq that she received a letter, with cash, asking her to put the pins in the hats. She also reveals that the letter included a third target{{spaced ndash}}Ernest Lafitte, owner of an orphanage. Preah says that Vidocq rushed to save Lafitte, but the masked murderer got there first. Vidocq pursued the murderer, who seemed to possess magical powers and a mask made from a strange reflective surface.\n\nBoisset's investigation leads him to Sylvia, the brothel manager, a journalist named Froissard who is investigating the masked murderer, and Marine Lafitte, wife of Ernest. They reveal that Lafitte, Belmont and Veraldi were narcissists, committed to preventing death by aging. A man with a mirror mask, called the Alchemist, offered them an elixir of eternal youth in return for their cooperation in capturing young maidens for his experiments. The three rich men went along, but later stopped cooperating due to a sense of guilt, so the Alchemist killed them. After Boisset leaves, the Alchemist arrives, killing Froissard and Marine. Boisset's investigation attracts the attention of Tauzet, who notices that the Alchemist is disposing of witnesses, and fears Boisset is next.\n\nBoisset sneaks in to retrieve Vidocq's notes, where he encounters Lautrennes and Tauzet. Lautrennes attempts to arrest Boisset, but the journalist escapes. The notes reveal that Vidocq found the Alchemist's lab, where he was using the maidens' blood to create a magic substance for his mask, which grants eternal youth by sucking the souls out of his victims. The Alchemist arrived and attacked Vidocq, who managed to take a piece from the Alchemist's mask before the killer escaped. Vidocq's final note states that the Alchemist would need someone to manufacture the mirrored mask, leading him to the glass factory.\n\nBoisset, Nimier and Preah head to the factory, ushered by an artisan, and closely trailed by both Tauzet and Lautrennes. Just as Boisset declares there are no more leads and witnesses, the artisan removes his prosthetic, revealing himself to be Vidocq. It turns out Vidocq had jumped into a secret hole in the furnace wall, which he saw in the reflection of the mirror mask before the Alchemist's reveal to be Boisset himself. Vidocq then admits to faking his own death simply to let Boisset's guard down, as he knows the Alchemist would destroy all clues and witnesses through any means necessary.\n\nWith his cover blown, Boisset lets out a monstrous roar and dons the Alchemist's mirror mask. Nimier opens fire, but is killed as the Alchemist magically reflects the bullets back at him. Vidocq pursues the Alchemist into a hall of mirrors, where he forces the Alchemist to look into a mirror shard, freeing all the souls trapped inside the mask. Vidocq impales the Alchemist with a shard of mirror and throws him into a river. Although the others insist the Alchemist is dead, Vidocq is unnerved by the lack of a body.\n\nAt Nimier's funeral, as the characters walk away, the Alchemist's laugh can be heard in the distance, accompanied by the glimmer of his mirror mask.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Vidocq\n*[[Guillaume Canet]] as \u00c9tienne Boisset\n*[[In\u00e9s Sastre]] as Pr\u00e9ah\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]] as Lautrennes\n*[[\u00c9dith Scob]] as Sylvia\n*[[Isabelle Renauld]] as Marine Lafitte\n*[[Moussa Maaskri]] as Nimier\n*Jean-Pierre Gos as Tauzet\n*Jean-Pol Dubois as Belmont\n*Andr\u00e9 Penvern as Veraldi\n*Gilles Arbona as Lafitte\n*[[Jean-Marc Thibault]] as Leviner\n*Fran\u00e7ois Chattot as Froissard\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=June 2022}}\n\n===Post production===\nThe film featured 800 shots modified in post-production over a period of eight months,<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.cineman.ch/en/movie/2001/Vidocq/review.html |title=Vidocq \u2014 Filmreview|access-date=2008-09-18|publisher=Cinergy AG}}</ref> at a cost of over \u20ac20 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plume-noire.com/movies/reviews/vidocq.html|title=Vidocq review|access-date=2008-09-18|author=Laurent Ziliani|work=La Plume Noire}}</ref> It was the first feature film to be shot in digital progressive HDTV at 24 fps cinematic framerate (1080p24), one year before ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164961/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|title=Vidocq at Imdb}}</ref> A few short scenes, however, were shot using DV format (576i25) for artistic purposes. Only those special effects shots were [[deinterlacing|deinterlaced]] by means of ''smart field blending'' (imitating a [[progressive scan|progressive]]-type amount of [[motion blur]] due to a different [[shutter speed]] of progressive modes) during post-production, as the special effects crew obviously was in demand of progressive frames which are easier to process. Normal shots were in no need of deinterlacing, thanks to progressive scan HD cameras. The result are video-like appearance of motions in DV shots, due to the different amount of motion blur resulting from the different deinterlacing methods, and distinctive film-like motions for the dominant 1080p24 shots otherwise.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Vidocq (1939 film)|Vidocq]]'' (1939)\n*''[[A Scandal in Paris]]'' (1946)\n*''[[The Emperor of Paris]]'' (2018)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Allmovie|377275|Vidocq}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0164961|title=Vidocq}}\n* {{Rotten tomatoes|10001166-vidocq|Vidocq}}\n\n{{Pitof}}\n\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:French detective films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Romantic period films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1830s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:French science fiction films]]\n[[Category:2001 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:French alternate history films]]\n[[Category:Supernatural thriller films]]\n[[Category:Occult detective fiction]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Eug\u00e8ne Fran\u00e7ois Vidocq]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Pitof]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Bruno Coulais]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
