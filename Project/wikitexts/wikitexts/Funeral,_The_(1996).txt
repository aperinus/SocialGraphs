Mourning the passage of their beloved brother Johnny are Chez and Ray. Ray is cold and calculating, while Chez is hot tempered. Flashbacks show us that Johnny was more sensitive. Exposure to communist meetings as a spy sway Johnny's opinions. The chief suspect in Johnny's murder is rival gangster Gaspare Spoglia.\n\nRay and Chez swear revenge. Ray's wife, Jeanette, opposes the campaign of retribution and the violence it will bring, while Chez' wife, Clara, struggles to deal with her husband's obsessive nature.\n\nRay has Gaspare abducted for interrogation and they go to see Johnny's body. He is satisfied by Gaspare's claim of innocence, in part because he says that gangsters are superstitious, believing that the wounds of the corpse will start bleeding in the presence of the killer. Therefore the killer will not willingly enter the dead victim's presence. Gaspare is comfortable to be in the presence of the victim, so is not the killer. Ray releases Gaspare but instructs his men to murder him later.\n\nAs it turns out, Johnny was not murdered by rival gangsters, but by a man who claimed Johnny had raped his girlfriend. Ray's men identify him by tracking the car he had driven to commit the crime. Pressed by Ray, the killer confesses that he had wanted revenge because Johnny had beaten him up in front of his girlfriend and friends. Ray kills him.\n\nAs he buries the dead murderer, Chez reflects on his brothers' lives before the tragedy. He then returns to Ray's house and shoots and kills Ray and his two bodyguards. Chez then shoots Johnny, lying dead in the casket, before putting the gun in his own mouth and committing suicide as the family women wail over Ray's dying body.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Raimondo \"Ray\" Tempio\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Cesarino \"Chez\" Tempio\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Jean\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Clara Tempio\n* [[Vincent Gallo]] as Giovanni \"Johnny\" Tempio\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Gaspare Spoglia\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Helen\n* [[John Ventimiglia]] as Sali\n* [[Paul Hipp]] as Ghouly\n* [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Michael Stein\n* [[Frank John Hughes]] as Bacco\n* [[Victor Argo]] as Julius\n* [[Robert Miano]] as Enrico\n* [[Andrew Fiscella]] as Murder Witness\n* [[Paul Perri]] as Young Ray\n\n==Reception==\nReception from critics was positive, as ''The Funeral'' holds a 79% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 34 reviews.\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave ''The Funeral'' three stars out of four, praising the acting especially.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-funeral-1996|journal= Chicago Sun Times| author=Roger Ebert| title=The Funeral | date= November 8, 1996 }}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]], writing in the [[New York Times]] gave it a positive review, calling it 'hotblooded' and 'well-acted'.<ref>{{cite journal| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/01/movies/on-crime-and-conscience-among-brothers.html|author= Janet Maslin| journal= New York Times| title=On Crime and Conscience Among Brothers }}</ref>\n\n[[Ken Tucker]], writing in [[Entertainment Weekly]] gave the film a positive review, calling it 'fine, thoughtful, and jolting'.<ref>{{cite journal| url=https://ew.com/article/1996/11/22/movie-review-funeral/| author= Ken Tucker| journal= Entertainment Weekly| title= Movie Review: 'The Funeral'}}</ref>\n\nA review in [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] gave the film four stars out of five, praising the 'complex characters' and 'impressive cast'.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/funeral-review/| journal= Empire| author=David Parkinson| title=The Funeral Review }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0116378|title=The Funeral}}\n*{{Amg movie|136162|The Funeral}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=1074517-funeral|title=The Funeral}}\n\n{{Abel Ferrara}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Funeral}}\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:1996 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Abel Ferrara]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Joe Delia]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films about the American Mafia]]\n[[Category:Murder\u2013suicide in films]]\n[[Category:Fratricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
