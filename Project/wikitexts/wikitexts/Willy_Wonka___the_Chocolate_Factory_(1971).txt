It is an [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1964 novel ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' by [[Roald Dahl]]. The film tells the story of a poor child named Charlie Bucket who, after finding a Golden Ticket in a chocolate bar, visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory along with four other children from around the world.\n\nFilming took place in [[Munich]] from August to November 1970. Dahl was credited with writing the film's screenplay; however, [[David Seltzer]] was brought in to do an uncredited rewrite. Against Dahl's wishes, changes were made to the story and other decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film. The musical numbers were written by [[Leslie Bricusse]] and [[Anthony Newley]] while [[Walter Scharf]] arranged and conducted the orchestral score.\n\nThe film was released on June 30, 1971 by [[Paramount Pictures]]. With a budget of just $3&nbsp;million, the film received generally positive reviews and earned $4&nbsp;million by the end of its original run. In 1972, the film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and Wilder was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy]]. The film also introduced the song \"[[The Candy Man]]\", which went on to be recorded by [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and become a popular hit. The film remained in obscurity until the 1980s where it gained a [[cult following]] and became highly popular due to repeated television airings and [[home video]] sales. \n\nIn 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nCharlie Bucket is a poor [[paperboy]] who often looks inside a candy shop but cannot afford to buy sweets. Going home one evening, he passes [[Willy Wonka]]'s chocolate factory, where a [[tinker]] tells him that nobody ever goes in or comes out. Charlie's bedridden Grandpa Joe reveals that Wonka had locked up the factory because rival confectioners were sending in spies to steal his recipes. Wonka shut down the factory but resumed production three years later. The gates remained locked, and the original workers never returned to their jobs, leaving their replacements a mystery.\n\nWonka announces that he has hidden five Golden Tickets in chocolate [[Wonka Bar]]s. Finders of the tickets will receive a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are found by a gluttonous German boy Augustus Gloop; the spoiled English girl Veruca Salt with a wealthy father; and from the United States, a constantly gum-chewing girl Violet Beauregarde, and the television-obsessed boy Mike Teevee. As each winner is announced on television, a sinister-looking man appears and whispers to them.\n\nA news report reveals the fifth ticket was found by a millionaire in Paraguay, causing Charlie to lose hope. The next day, Charlie is on his way home from school when he finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy and eat candy; with the change, he buys a regular Wonka Bar for Grandpa Joe. Walking home, Charlie overhears that the millionaire forged the fifth ticket. Charlie opens his Wonka Bar, discovering the final ticket. Rushing back, he encounters the sinister figure who spoke to the other winners. Introducing himself as Slugworth, one of Wonka's competitors, he offers a reward for a sample of Wonka's latest creation, the [[Everlasting Gobstopper]].\n\nReturning home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone, who excitedly jumps out of bed for the first time in twenty years. The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners at the front gates of the factory and leads them inside, where each signs a contract before the tour. The factory includes a whimsical indoor park with a river of chocolate and other sweets, an invention room, and a room where geese lay eggs. The visitors meet Wonka's workforce, little people known as [[Oompa-Loompas]].\n\nDuring the tour, each child's character flaws have them give in to temptation, resulting in their unusual elimination. Augustus gets sucked up a pipe; Violet bloats into a giant human blueberry; Veruca falls down a garbage chute; and Mike is shrunk to the size of a chocolate bar. The Oompa Loompas sing a song of morality after each disposal. On the tour, Charlie and Joe enter the Fizzy Lifting Drinks room and sample the beverages against Wonka's orders. The drink makes them float up and have a near-fatal encounter with the ceiling exhaust fan, but burping allows them to escape and descend to the ground.\n\nAt the end of the tour, Wonka assures Charlie and Grandpa Joe that the other children will be fine before he hastily retreats to his office without awarding them the promised lifetime supply of chocolate. In the office, Wonka angrily informs them that they had violated the contract when they stole the Fizzy Lifting Drinks, thereby forfeiting their prize. Joe denounces Wonka and suggests to Charlie that he give Slugworth the Everlasting Gobstopper in retaliation, but Charlie decides to return the candy to Wonka instead. All of a sudden, Wonka joyously declares Charlie the winner, and reveals that Slugworth is actually his employee, Mr. Wilkinson. The offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test for the ticket winners, and only Charlie passed. The trio enters the Wonkavator, a multi-directional glass elevator, that flies out of the factory. During their flight, Wonka tells Charlie that he created the contest to find someone worthy enough to inherit his factory, so he will give it to Charlie and his family upon retiring.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters|l1=List of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory characters}}\n[[File:Main Cast of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.jpg|thumb|The main cast during filming in 1970.\nBack row (left to right): Michael B\u00f6llner (Augustus Gloop), Ursula Reit (Mrs. Gloop), Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka)\nSecond row (left to right): Leonard Stone (Sam Beauregarde), Roy Kinnear (Henry Salt), Nora Denney (Mrs. Teevee), Jack Albertson (Grandpa Joe)\nFront row (left to right): Denise Nickerson (Violet Beauregarde), Julie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt), Paris Themmen (Mike Teevee), Peter Ostrum (Charlie Bucket)]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as [[Willy Wonka]]\n* [[Jack Albertson]] as [[Grandpa Joe]]\n* [[Peter Ostrum]] as [[Charlie Bucket]]\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as Mr. Salt\n* [[Julie Dawn Cole]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Veruca Salt|Veruca Salt]]\n* [[Leonard Stone]] as Mr. Beauregarde\n* [[Denise Nickerson]] as [[Violet Beauregarde]]\n* [[Nora Denney|Dodo Denney]] as Mrs. Teevee\n* [[Paris Themmen]] as [[Mike Teevee]]\n* [[Ursula Reit]] as Mrs. Gloop\n* Michael B\u00f6llner as [[Augustus Gloop]]\n* [[Diana Sowle]] as Mrs. Bucket\n* [[Aubrey Woods]] as Bill\n* [[David Battley]] as Mr. Turkentine\n* [[G\u00fcnter Meisner]] as Arthur Slugworth / Mr. Wilkinson\n* [[Peter Capell]] as The Tinker\n* [[Werner Heyking]] as Mr. Jopeck\n* Peter Stuart as Winkelmann <!-- This is not the musician Peter Stuart but director Mel Stuart's son. -->\n* [[Franziska Liebing]] as Grandma Josephine\n* [[Dora Altmann]] as Grandma Georgina\n* [[Ernst Ziegler]] as Grandpa George\n* [[Victor Beaumont]] as Doctor\n* [[Frank Delfino]] as Auctioneer\n* [[Gloria Manon]] as Mrs. Curtis\n* [[Stephen Dunne (actor)|Stephen Dunne]] as Stanley Kael\n* [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] as Computer scientist\n* [[Ed Peck]] as FBI agent\n* [[Pat Coombs]] as Henrietta Salt\n}}\n\n'''Oompa-Loompas'''<ref>{{cite web |last=Knott |first=Rebeka |title=The Oompa Loompas Were African Slaves In The 1964 Book |url=https://groovyhistory.com/oompa-loompas-the-original-ones |website=Groovy History |language=en}}</ref>\n* Rudy Borgstaller\n* [[George Claydon]]\n* [[Malcolm Dixon (actor)|Malcolm Dixon]]\n* [[Rusty Goffe]]\n* Ismed Hassan\n* Norman McGlen\n* [[Angelo Muscat]]\n* Pepe Poupee\n* Marcus Powell\n* Albert Wilkinson<ref name=\"bbcnews\">{{Cite news|title=Oompa Loompa stars in Snow White|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-nottinghamshire-20721709|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for [[Film adaptation|adapting the book into a film]] came about when director [[Mel Stuart]]'s ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with \"Uncle Dave\" (producer [[David L.

Stuart envisioned it differently as a wacky inventor's laboratory, with [[Rube Goldberg]] type mechanisms and unusual contraptions, and wanted it redesigned to be like Wonka's personality. Goff sent his construction crew into Munich searching junkyards, bakeries, and car dealers for discarded machinery, tin funnels, and any other raw materials. This included building Wonka's three-course gum machine, which was originally a solid state device, but Stuart requested an appliance where the operations had a visual experience for the audience.<ref name=dm /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kent |first1=Kathy |title=Willy Wonka 40 Years  &amp; Harper Goff |url=https://vimeo.com/439802522 |date=July 19, 2020}}</ref> Stuart also instructed Goff to have all the props, furniture and fittings, excluding the light bulbs, in Wonka's original office to be cut in half, to reflect the character's eccentricity.<ref name=abc /> Stuart stated, \"I couldn't face the thought of ending the journey through this fabulous factory in an ordinary-looking office.\"{{sfn|Stuart|Young|2002|p=59}}\n\nAbout a third of the props in the Chocolate Room set were edible.<ref name=people>{{cite web |last=Heigl |first=Alex |title=Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory: Trivia and Facts |url=https://people.com/celebrity/willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory-trivia-and-facts/ |website=people.com |date=June 30, 2016|language=en}}</ref> Veruca Salt had a chocolate watermelon; Mike Teevee had gum balls from a tree; Violet Beauregarde's \"three-course gum\" was actually a toffee-based candy, and marzipan was freely available on set; also there were giant mushrooms filled with whipped cream; and the trees had edible leaves.<ref name=abc /><ref name=dm /><ref name=collider>{{cite web |last=Radish |first=Christina |title=The Kids From 'Willy Wonka' Reflect on the Making of the Film and Whether Any of the Candy Was Real |url=https://collider.com/willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory-kids-interview-peter-ostrum/ |website=Collider |date=July 10, 2021}}</ref> The inedible items included giant gummy bears that were plastic (the ears were edible, however); the flavoured wallpaper was just wallpaper; and Wonka's flower cup was made of wax which [[Gene Wilder]] would chew on camera and spit out after each take.<ref name=groovy /><ref name=collider /><ref name=dm />\n\nIn the scene where thousands of Wonka bars were being unwrapped to find a Golden Ticket at Mr. Salt's peanut factory, the bars were actually made of wood.

Stuart lamented in his book ''Pure Imagination: The Making of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'', that his favorite scene was cut due to poor test screenings. In the scene, which took a lot of preparation and money to film, an English explorer climbs a holy mountain to ask a guru the meaning of life. The guru requests a Wonka Bar. Finding no golden ticket, he says, \"Life is a disappointment.\" Stuart loved the scene, but few laughed. He invited a psychologist friend to a preview, where again, the audience reaction was muted. The psychologist told him, \"You don't understand, Mel. For a great many people, life ''is'' a disappointment.\"{{sfn|Stuart|Young|2002|p=19\u201320}}\n\nWhen interviewed for the 30th anniversary special edition in 2001, Wilder stated that he enjoyed working with most of the child actors, but said that he and the film crew had some problems with Paris Themmen recalling, \"Oh, he was a little brat!\"<ref name=\"pureimagvideo\" /> He then addressed Themmen directly, \"Now if you're watching this, you know that I love you now, but you were a troublemaker then.\"{{sfn|Stuart|Young|2002|p=85\u2013ff}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Blu-ray Review: \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" |url=https://popdose.com/blu-ray-review-willy-wonka-the-chocolate-factory/ |website=Popdose |date=October 4, 2009}}</ref>{{efn|Being \"a handful\" was Themmen's recollection of this remark.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inquisitr.com/3466024/the-willy-wonka-kids-remember-gene-wilder-where-are-they-now/ |title=The Willy Wonka Kids Remember Gene Wilder; Where Are They Now? |date=August 30, 2016 |access-date=May 27, 2019 |archive-date=May 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190527142854/https://www.inquisitr.com/3466024/the-willy-wonka-kids-remember-gene-wilder-where-are-they-now/ |url-status=live }}</ref>}} An example of Themmen's misbehaviour was releasing bees from a beehive on Wonka's three-course gum machine. \"As life mirrored one of the morals of the movie,\" Stuart remembers, \"one of the bees stung him.\"<ref name=dm />\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n''Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on June 30, 1971.
