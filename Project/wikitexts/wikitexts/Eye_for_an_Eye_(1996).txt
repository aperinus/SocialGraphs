It stars [[Sally Field]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]] and [[Joe Mantegna]]. The story was adapted from [[Erika Holzer]]'s novel of the same name. The film opened on January 12, 1996.\n\n==Plot==\nKaren ([[Sally Field]]) and Mack McCann ([[Ed Harris]]) are happily married with two daughters, seventeen-year-old Julie (from Karen's previous marriage) and six-year-old Megan. One afternoon while Karen is out shopping, Julie is violently raped and murdered, which Karen overhears on the phone. Detective Joe Denillo assures the McCanns there is enough [[DNA]] evidence to find and convict the killer, and encourages Karen to seek counselling.\n\nAt a [[support group]], Karen meets people in similar circumstances, including Albert and Regina Gratz, and Sidney Hughes.  During the meeting, Karen overhears Albert talking to Sidney about something which alarms Regina. Meanwhile, the DNA tests reveal Julie's killer to be Robert Doob ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]), a delivery driver with a criminal record. However at the trial, Doob is released as the defence did not receive a sample of the evidence, and the judge dismisses the case. Karen and Mack are horrified as Doob walks free.\n\nMack is desperate to return to a normal life, but Karen cannot stop thinking about Doob. She finds out where he lives and keeps detailed records of his movements. Karen follows Doob while he goes out on deliveries and attempts to warn a female customer, but the woman only speaks Spanish and does not understand her. Karen later learns that the murderer of the Gratzs' son has been killed in a [[drive-by shooting]], just days after being released from prison. Angel, also in the self-help group, tells Karen the best way to get over her grief is to focus on having good experiences with her living daughter, making Karen realizes she has been so fixated on Doob that Megan has been deprived of her attention.\n\nDoob discovers Karen is stalking him and goes to Megan's school. When Karen comes to pick Megan up, Doob deliberately intimidates her and threatens to harm Megan if she continues following him. Worried for Megan's safety and with her sanity declining, Karen approaches Sidney, who admits the drive-by shooting was set up by him and Martin. Karen demands their help and they agree to find a weapon, train her, and plan the murder, but tell her she has to carry it out. Karen agrees and they begin plotting. She also joins a [[self-defense]] class, which helps her gain more confidence, helps rekindle her sex life with Mack, and improves her relationship with Megan. Sidney gives Karen a gun.\n\nAngel reveals that she is really an undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Agent]] investigating [[vigilante]] activity within the support group, and warns Karen not to kill Doob. Karen then calls Sidney to tell him she cannot go through with it, but later changes her mind when she learns the Spanish customer she tried to warn about Doob has been raped and murdered. Karen is furious when Doob again walks free because, as the grocery delivery man, his prints and hair/carpet fibers belong in the house. He even wore a condom to prevent leaving DNA, something he didn\u2019t do with Julie.\n\nKaren sets a trap to lure Doob into her home while Mack and Megan are out of town, so that she can say killing him was self-defense, and it works. Despite Doob's attempts to fight back, Karen ultimately shoots Doob dead after a struggle. Denillo arrives on the scene and tells Karen that he knows the truth and that she has not fooled him, to which she replies, \"Prove it.\"  He decides to tell his colleague that it was a \"clear case of self-defense\". When Mack arrives, he sits beside her, holding her hand, also knowing what she has done.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Sally Field]] as Karen Julie McCann  \n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Robert Doob\n* [[Ed Harris]]  as Mack McCann\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Det.

The site's consensus states: \"Overwrought, thinly written, and all-around unpleasant, ''Eye for an Eye'' crudely exploits every parent's nightmare with deeply offensive results.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eye_for_an_eye_1996/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |work=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n \n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one star (out of four), calling it \"a particularly nasty little example of audience manipulation\" and writing that it \"is intellectually corrupt because it deliberately avoids dealing with the issues it raises.\" Ebert also compared the film to ''[[Dead Man Walking (film)|Dead Man Walking]]'', saying \"''Dead Man Walking'' challenges us to deal with a wide range of ethical and moral issues. ''Eye for an Eye'' cynically blinkers us, excluding morality as much as it can, to service an exploitation plot.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/eye-for-an-eye-1996 |title=Eye for an Eye |work=rogerebert.com }}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote \"Never in his varied career has Mr. Schlesinger made a film as mean-spirited and empty as this.\" She also felt \"The sole purpose of \"Eye for an Eye\" is to excite blood lust from the audience\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9402E5DD1039F931A25752C0A960958260 |title=Get Mad?
