It tells the tale of a heroine raised in the fictional African country of Tigora by the fictional Zambouli tribe.\n\nThe film starred [[Tanya Roberts]], [[Ted Wass]], and [[Trevor Thomas (actor)|Trevor Thomas]]. It was directed by [[John Guillermin]] and written by [[Lorenzo Semple Jr.]], who had previously collaborated on the 1976 remake of ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]''.\n\nReleased by [[Columbia Pictures]] on 17 August 1984, ''Sheena'' bombed in theaters and was nominated for five [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] including Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Tanya Roberts), Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Musical Score, but it did find some cult success on home video and DVD. Since then, it has been considered a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile investigating rumors of a mystical \"healing earth\" whose powers are said to flow forth from the sacred Gudjara Mountain, geologists Philip and Betsy Ames (Michael Shannon and Nancy Paul) are killed in a [[cave-in]], leaving their young daughter, Janet an orphan. Janet is adopted by [[Shaman]], a woman of the native Zambouli tribe ([[Princess Elizabeth of Toro]]), and because of a prophecy about the cave-in (\"when the sacred mountain cries out\"), she is viewed as a child of the gods and renamed Sheena, \"Queen of the Jungle\".\n\nAs Sheena (Tanya Roberts) grows up, she learns much from Shaman about the lore of the jungle and the ways of all its creatures. She is even entrusted with the secret of telepathic communication with the animals. Outsiders rarely disturb their territory, since that part of Tigora is under the special protection of [[Monarch|king]] Jabalani ([[Clifton Jones]]).\n\nTrouble is brewing in Tigora, although; the king's ex-football champion younger brother, prince Otwani ([[Trevor Thomas (actor)|Trevor Thomas]]) is conspiring with his brother's fianc\u00e9e, Countess Zanda (France Zobda) to have Jabalani assassinated so they can exploit the titanium-rich Zambouli land (this may or may not have something to do with the healing properties of the soil, but this is never explained).\n\nExperiencing a vision foretelling the death of the king, Shaman hastens to Tigora's capital of Azan to try to warn him, but is arrested by corrupt police officers working for Zanda.\n\nOtwani's old friend, reporter Vic Casey (Ted Wass) and his cameraman, Fletch Agronsky ([[Donovan Scott]]) are in Tigora to do a story on the former football player. When king Jabalani is killed and Shaman is framed for it, Vic and Fletch realize that they are on to a much bigger story than they had anticipated.\n\nHeading to a remote prison compound to interview Shaman, they bear witness to her rescue by Sheena and her animal friends; \"Chango\" the elephant, \"Marika\" the zebra and \"Tiki\" the chimpanzee. As they escape back into the jungle after destroying the prison, Vic and Fletch follow. However, Shaman soon dies from her injuries.\n\nOtwani obtains the services of colonel Jorgensen ([[John Forgeham]]) and his small army of soldier mercenaries, the Black Berets. Their mission is to eradicate the Zambouli people so their territory will be open for [[Surface mining|strip-mining]]. Vic join forces with Sheena to stop the evil prince and his army, along the way, Vic and Sheena fall in love.\n\nThe climax of the film takes place on the African Serengeti. Zanda attempts to shove Sheena on the Zambuli Falls, but the heroine connects telepathically to a bunch of flamingos that attack the helicopter and throw the countess down the waterfalls to her death. Sheena leads her people against the mercenaries and Otwani. Sheena successfully shoots Otwani in the heart with her arrow and fulfills the prophecy, but she is also positioned to be hit by Otwani's vehicle. Vic saves her life by crashing into Otwani's vehicle; resulting in severe burn wounds. Vic is healed with the earth and wants to stay with Sheena, but realizes that if he tells his story to the outside world, then other corporations will destroy Sheena's home.\n\nBefore leaving to return to New York,Vic and Sheena had [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] (off-screen). Vic and his cameraman Fletch leave on an airplane back to New York. Before leaving, Sheena records a farewell message on his tape recorder wishing him a safe journey.\n\nAt the end the film, Sheena takes a ride on Marika through the serengeti.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Tanya Roberts]] as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]]\n**Kirsty Lindsay as young Sheena\n**Kathryn Gant as child Sheena (Janet Ames)\n*[[Ted Wass (actor)|Ted Wass]] as Vic Casey\n*[[Donovan Scott]] as Fletch Agronsky\n*[[Princess Elizabeth of Toro]] as [[Shaman]]\n*France Zobda as Countess Zanda\n*[[Trevor Thomas (actor)|Trevor Thomas]] as Prince Otwani\n*[[Clifton Jones]] as King Jabalani\n*[[John Forgeham]] as Colonel Jorgensen\n*[[Errol John]] as Boto\n*Sylvester Williams as Juka\n*[[Bob Sherman (actor)|Bob Sherman]] as Grizzard\n*[[Michael J.

Aratow thought, \"Something went off in my head \u2013 I realised that it was a most commercial idea, it had action and a sexy, mythic Earth goddess type who was actually one of the true comic-book heroines.\"<ref name=\"Caulfield\">{{cite news |title=Film Clips: Turn Around and You're 'Sheena' |last=Caulfield |first=Deborah |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=18 April 1983|page= j1}}</ref> Aratow bought the rights, set up a production company with Alan Rinzler, and succeeded in interesting Universal Pictures with [[Raquel Welch]]  attached to play the lead.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Fox's 'Lucky Lady' at Loose Ends: Call Sheet|last=Murphy |first=Mary. |date=17 December 1975|work=Los Angeles Times |page=h19 }}</ref>\n\n\"At first it looked incredibly easy\", Aratow says in the interview. \"After only two months I had an office at the studio and Raquel Welch was going to play Sheena.\"<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> Robert and Laurie Dillon wrote a script that took a tongue-in-cheek approach to the material. Universal invested around $65,000 in the project. The studio then decided not to proceed with the movie.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/>\n\nThe producers then took the project to Filmways, where then-head of production Ed Feldman wanted \"to create an out-and-out adventure story, with humour, of course, but basically an elaborate adventure.\"<ref name=\"gregg\">{{cite news|title=Film Clips: Tarzan! Superman! Now Sheena!|last=Kilday|first= Gregg|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date=3 August 1977|page= h7}}</ref> Feldman had a poster designed illustrating his idea and showed it to [[Mike Medavoy]] of [[United Artists]], who agreed to finance a new script. Michael Scheff and David Spector did a screenplay. Raquel Welch, who had been Universal's choice for the role, was still a possibility, but Feldman said, \"at this point we have no actress in mind. I wouldn't say we wouldn't go to Raquel Welch, but I wouldn't want to rule out a worldwide search, either.\"<ref name=\"gregg\"/>\n\nWhen Mike Medavoy left United Artists, the project went into turnaround. Aratow now owed $65,000 to Universal and $85,000 to United Artists for the money they put in the project.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/>\n\nAratow took ''Sheena'' to [[Avco-Embassy]], which did a search for possible stars, then also passed. \"I realised they just didn't have any money\", said Aratow.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/>\n\n===Columbia Pictures===\nEventually in 1980, [[Columbia Pictures]]' head of production [[Frank Price]] agreed to finance the movie ''Sheena'' with a budget from $7 to 10&nbsp;million. [[Bo Derek]] was mentioned as a possible star, but Aratow says, \"all reasonable casting suggestions are welcome\".<ref name=\"back\">{{Cite news|title=Back in the Jungle for 'Sheena'?|last=Epstein |first=Andrew|date=May 4, 1980|work=Los Angeles Times|page=s27}}</ref>\n\n\"Girls today need superheroes\", said Aratow. \"I have a daughter, who is six, who needs someone to look up to. And I want Sheena to be that superhero. I also want Sheena to be a character that parents will want to send their kids to see, and the type of picture that parents can go see with their children.\"<ref name=\"back\"/>\n\n===Script===\n\"The comic-book concept was hopelessly outdated,\" said Aratow. \"It involved the killing of endangered species and also had racist overtones. We decided to create our own interpretation of Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. She is a modern, contemporary woman . She is much more cognizant of ecology. She is much less violent. ''Sheena'' is an '80s film, so Sheena is an '80s woman living in the jungle. She is in tune with the natural order.\"<ref name=\"Swires June 1984 p 46\">Swires June 1984 p  46</ref>\n\nThe first writer at Columbia was Leslie Stevens. \"Leslie took the story in a fantasy direction, involving a ''[[Chariots of the Gods?|Chariots of the Gods]]'' concept,\" said Aratow. \"It was an interesting job, but it didn't meet with studio enthusiasm. Columbia didn't want to deal with Sheena as a magical phenomenon. The execs felt the basic material was already so fantastic, that the best way to play it was naturalistic. But they believed in the property enough to commission yet another script, and start all over again.\"<ref name=\"Swires June 1984 p 46\"/>\n\nColumbia then financed a script from [[David Newman (screenwriter)|David Newman]] who had written ''Superman'' (1978). This script took a year to write. \"His screenplay was worth waiting for, though, because it was more realistic and worked out much better,\" said Aratow.<ref name=\"Swires June 1984 p 46\"/>\n\nNewman said he was interested in the concept of the \"white goddess... that idea which appears again and again in legend\u2014 this 'Miranda' or 'Eve-like' innocent creature who lives in perfect harmony with animals and with the land \u2014 a kind of ecological superperson. I wanted to explore how that kind of person would fare in today's Africa, an Africa with places like Uganda and people like Idi Amin.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|page=66|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-073/page/n64/mode/1up?q=sheena|date=August 1983|title=David and Leslie Newman super screenwriters|first1=Da Marie|last1=Boyer|first2=Patrick Daniel|last2=O'Neill}}</ref>\n\nTanya Roberts, who would play the role, said David Newman came up with the basis of the story. \"I preferred his script, because it was the best in terms of character development,\" she said.<ref name=\"Swires Sept 1984 p 63\">Swires Sept 1984 p 63</ref> The script was rewritten by [[Dean Riesner]], whom Roberts says, \"totally changed David's script. It lost all its charm and romance. It was a mistake; it didn't work at all. Riesner may be good at action, but he isn't good at character development.\"<ref name=\"Swires Sept 1984 p 63\"/>\n\nWhen John Guillermin became the director, he felt like it needed \"something more\", so they hired Guillermin's old friend Lorenzo Semple, Jr., who had worked with the director on ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' (1976).\n\nGuillermin later said, \"Unlike the Kong films, Sheena for me  had some great possibilities. I saw the character of Sheena as sort of an ethereal person. It would have made the film more of a fairy tale, but, of course, it didn't quite go that route.\"<ref name=\"star\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|title=Lord of Disaster|first=Lowell|last=Goldman|date=November 1990|page=70|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-160/page/n69/mode/1up?q=toreadors+guillermin}}</ref>\n\nRoberts says Semple \"went back to David's original script. He switched things around a bit, added excitement, and speeded up the pace to make it more intense, but he never changed any of David's characters.\"<ref name=\"Swires Sept 1984 p 63\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nAmong those considered for the lead were reportedly [[Sandahl Bergman]], [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Sybil Danning]], Susan Mechsner, and [[Christie Brinkley]].<ref name=\"star\"/> Tanya Roberts was then best known for appearing in the last season of ''Charlie's Angels'' and for playing the lead in ''The Beastmaster'', as well as posing nude in ''Playboy''. Roberts said, \"As soon as I heard about the project, I said: 'This part must be mine.' I bugged the casting lady at Columbia Pictures for months. Finally, I met the director, John Guillermin, but he wasn't too impressed with me. I begged for another interview. I saw  him again, and said: 'If you don't give me a bloody screen test, I'll slash my wrists, and it will be your fault. You'll have my death on your hands.' I don't know if that pushed him over the edge, but he agreed to test me.\"<ref>Swires Sept 1984 p 61</ref>\n\nRoberts said she tested against \"about 15 models. They were very beautiful, but they couldn't act. Their tests were horrendous\u2014 they couldn't cry, they couldn't shout, they couldn't do anything...I felt very confident about getting the role. I have been in this business for 14  years, and have paid a lot of dues. I know what I'm capable of. I was the only one  who could act, who looked right, who could do the stunts. I tested again in a blonde wig, and I got the part.\"<ref name=\"Swires Sept 1984 p 62\">Swires Sept 1984 p 62</ref>\n\nThe producer said they tested over 2,000 girls adding, \"[Farrah] Fawcett and [Cheryl] Ladd were discussed years ago, but they would be ridiculous in the role now. We never gave serious thought to Bergman. Mechsner's casting was entirely her own invention. And Danning was never seriously considered. She is wrong in terms of age and physical appearance. Frankly, I think Tanya is hotter than all of them \u2014 in addition to being stunningly beautiful and having the world's greatest body.\"<ref>Swires June 1984 p  67</ref>\n\nRoberts' casting was announced in May 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title=Film Clips: Casting Fates to the Wind|author=Caulfield, Deborah|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2 May 1983|page=g1}}</ref> She says she trained for 10 months for the role, but did not read any of the comic books in preparation, as she felt they were too campy. \"I wanted her to be a real person in a real situation.\" she said.<ref name=\"Swires Sept 1984 p 62\"/>\n\nTed Wass claims he originally turned down the male lead:\n<blockquote>It's one of those pictures that everyone had a bit of a cackle about. Then I had a great meeting with Lorenzo Semple, one of the screenwriters, and I could see that a lot of guys were taking this picture very seriously. I went over to Africa and I met John Guillermin, the director, and he embraced all my ideas about strengthening and broadening the character. I thought if you were going to have a heroine, a fabulous figure like Sheena, she'd have to fall in love with someone who was as great from his own element \u2013 it wouldn't work if she fell in love with a schmuck. John agreed. He's a tough cookie and uncompromising in his vision. He either says, 'That's a pile of crap and it won't be in my picture,' or he goes for it. I think John, who also made ''King Kong'', takes fantastic stories and then grounds them in a reality he finds a lot of time in the geographic locations.<ref name=\"wass\">{{cite news|title=After the cackling, Wass is won over|author=Scott, Jay|work=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=10 August 1984|page=E.1}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Shooting===\nFilming began 21 August 1983.<ref name=\"Caulfield\"/> The film was shot over 7 months. Various production problems associated with shooting on location were encountered. Ted Wass (Vic Casey) recalled, in the article \"Man on the Spot\" (an article about executive producer [[Yoram Ben-Ami]], also found in the ''Super Special''), \"Making a movie is like going to war. You can be the greatest general in the world, but if you don't have a good army, you're going to lose the battle.\" The film's multitude of animals were managed by Hubert Wells, who recalled, \"We flew over an elephant, a rhino, five lions, four leopards, four chimpanzees, five horses, and 16 birds. It was the largest shipment of animals ''back'' to Africa and just getting all the necessary permits to bring them in and out of the country was a superhuman task.\" Wells had few problems with the trained animals, but the crew did have some with wild animals that would come onto the set, in particular wild lions that would try to start fights with the tamed ones. Guards had to be posted on the set at night to keep them away. Despite this, Wells was quoted as saying that he enjoyed working on the picture so much, he hoped for a sequel, which of course never came.\n\nWass says Tanya Roberts \"was always in great shape, but she made her body even more magnificent by working out... She brought an athleticism to the movie few actresses could match; physically, she was always on the money, and even though there was a lot of pressure on her, she came through.\"<ref name=\"wass\"/>\n\nRoberts found filming physically grueling and was injured a number of times. She called Guillermin \"the most difficult director I've ever worked with, because he is such a perfectionist. He  kills you when he's directing, but he does get a performance. Whatever our differences, I believe John was the absolute right director for  Sheena. He has passion and a great vision. He didn't want crap. He wanted a very special film that would still be commercial, and I think he got it. Under his hard exterior, John is really very sensitive. He has great insight into the  character. He was very responsive to my ideas. He is a mother to work for, and there \nwas a lot of crying on the set, but he got the job done.\"<ref name=\"Swires Sept 1984 p 63\"/> \n \nAratow said after filming that Guillermin was \"very difficult to deal with. He is very opinionated, and doesn't want to be told anything by anybody. That may or may not be good for the movie. I shouldn't comment any further at this stage, because what I have to say is not kind. But I really don't need to say anything else. All you have to do is speak to the people who\nhave worked with him. My feelings about John Guillermin are widely shared.\"<ref name=\"Swires June 1984 p 46\"/>\n\n\"It's not a picture that I'm ashamed of in any way,\" said Guillermin. \"I did some work in Sheena that I feel good about. Unfortunately, the film wasn't a success. It was not well-received. There were things that went wrong on the picture. But I don't want to dwell on them.\"<ref name=\"star\"/>\n\nDuring shooting, Guillermin's son, Michael, (from his marriage with [[Maureen Connell]]), died in a car accident in California. The director flew back from Kenya for the funeral, then returned to Africa to complete the film.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guillermin |first=John |editor-last=Guillermin |editor-first=Mary |title=John Guillermin: The Man, The Myth, The Movies |publisher=Precocity Press |date=2020 |pages=18 |chapter=CHAPTER 2 DEO PROFUNDIS}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Sheena'' was a box-office bomb, grossing less than $6&nbsp;million, against a $25&nbsp;million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nCritical reviews of the film were generally negative.\nOn the television program ''[[At the Movies (1982 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' with [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]], ''Sheena'' received two thumbs down. Ebert commented that \"This movie is rated [[Motion Picture Association film rating system#PG|PG]], not [[PG-13]].

Supposed to be campy, but it doesn't work even on that level; both the cinematography and the music belong in a much better picture.\"<ref>Maltin's TV, Movie, & Video Guide {{ISBN needed}}</ref>\n\n''The New Yorker'' film critic [[Pauline Kael]] was among the very few critics who liked the film. Calling it a \"lighthearted, slightly loony adventure film, there are some good silly gags, and the animals look relaxed even in their dizziest slapstick scenes. And the picture certainly never starves the eye; the cinematography is by the celebrated Pasqualino De Santis.\" (DeSantis had previously won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for his work on [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo & Juliet]]''.) Kael even had some (qualified) kind words for the star: \"Tanya Roberts is too tense and earnest for her blond-goddess, queen-of-the-jungle role. Yet she has the face of a ballerina, with a prodigious slim and muscular form. She also gazes into space with exquisitely-blank, pale-blue eyes.

A dual-sided DVD with [[anamorphic widescreen#DVD Video|anamorphic widescreen]] and \"full screen\" presentations in 2001, and a single-sided DVD with only the full screen presentation in 2004. Both releases have the same {{ISBN|0-7678-6822-6}} and [[stock keeping unit|SKU]] 0-43396-06535-2 and can be distinguished from each other only by the discs themselves or by the date and \"Special Features\" list on the back cover. The packaging does not indicate if the full-screen presentation is [[pan and scan]] or [[open matte]].\n\nThe single-sided full-screen DVD was also included in a 2008 \"Triple Feature\" release, along with ''[[You Light Up My Life (film)|You Light Up My Life]]'' and ''[[Princess Caraboo (film)|Princess Caraboo]]''. A [[high-definition video|high-definition]] digital version of ''Sheena'' is available through various services.\n\nThe film was released as part of the ''Sheena: Queen of the Jungle Collection'' DVD set by Mill Creek Entertainment on August 15, 2017, that contained that along with both seasons of ''[[Sheena (TV series)|Sheena]]'', as well as 5 bonus episodes of the [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle#In other media|1950s TV series]].<ref>[https://www.millcreekent.com/sheena-queen-of-the-jungle-collection.html Mill Creek Entertainment: Sheena - Queen of the Jungle Collection]</ref> Mill Creek also released the film's individual Blu-ray on March 26, 2019.\n\n==Comic adaptation==\nAround the time the film came out, [[Marvel Comics]] published an adaptation of the film as ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #34, written by [[Cary Burkett]] and illustrated by [[Gray Morrow]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/38146/ ''Marvel Super Special'' #34] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> It followed the story of the film very closely, and developed the character of Fletch the cameraman quite a bit more than in the film, in particular revealing his surname to be \"Agronsky\". The comic also had several pages in the back about the making of the film. One noteworthy difference between the film and the comic concerns the ethnicity of Otwani's troops. In the film, they are all white. In the comic, the only white soldiers are Colonel Jorgenson and the helicopter pilot (identified as Joe), while all of the others are of African descent, including the featured soldiers.\n\nNew editions of the comic books were first published by Devil's Due, then the comic book publication was licensed to Moonstone by Galaxy Publishing, Inc. This latest version of the comic book is now (2012) being published.\n\n==Remake==\nIn 2017, it was reported that [[Millennium Films]] was planning a ''Sheena'' reboot.<ref>{{cite web |date=5 September 2017 |last=Busch |first=Anita |url=https://deadline.com/2017/09/sheena-queen-of-the-jungle-movie-millennium-films-female-superhero-1202161575/ |title='Sheena: Queen Of The Jungle' Reboot Feature In Works At Millennium Films |work=Deadline Hollywood |access-date=11 September 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite magazine |magazine=Starlog |title=Paul Aratow The Troubles with \"Sheena\" |url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-083/page/n41/mode/1up?q=toreadors+guillermin |date=June 1984 |first=Steve |last=Swires |pages=44\u201346, 67 }}\n*{{cite magazine |magazine=Starlog |url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-086/page/n57/mode/1up?q=sheena+%22tanya+roberts%22 |first=Steve |last=Swires |title=Tanya Roberts Dream Role |date=September 1984 |pages=61\u201363 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0088103|Sheena}}\n*{{AllMovie title|44252|Sheena}}\n*{{mojo title|sheena|Sheena}}\n*{{AFI film|id=57191|title=Sheena}}\n*{{TCMDb title|id=89886}}\n*[https://letterboxd.com/film/sheena/ Sheena] at Letterbox DVD\n*[https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-083/page/n41/mode/2up Article on making the film] Starlog Magazine Issue 083 (June 1984) ISSN 0191-4626\n\n{{John Guillermin}}\n\n[[Category:1980s action films]]\n[[Category:1980s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:1980s superhero films]]\n[[Category:1984 films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:American superhero films]]\n[[Category:British fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:British superhero films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American comics]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Guillermin]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Kenya]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n[[Category:Jungle girls]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on comics]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Lorenzo Semple Jr.]]\n[[Category:Superheroine films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:1980s British films]]"}]}}}}
