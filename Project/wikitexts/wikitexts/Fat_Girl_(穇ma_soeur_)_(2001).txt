Bored of staying in their vacation home, the two walk into town while discussing relationships and their virginities. Although the conventionally attractive Elena has been promiscuous, she is saving actual intercourse for someone who loves her, while overweight Ana\u00efs thinks it is better to lose one's virginity to a \"nobody\" just to get it over with.\n\nThey meet an Italian law student, Fernando, at a cafe. Later, Fernando sneaks into the girls' bedroom for a liaison with Elena. Ana\u00efs is awake and watches their entire interaction. After a conversation about Fernando's previous relationships with other women, Elena consents to have sex with him but backs out at the last minute. Frustrated, Fernando pressures her through various means, including threatening to sleep with some other woman just to alleviate himself. Finally, Elena is coerced into anal sex as a \"proof of love,\" although it is obviously a painful experience for her.\n\nIn the morning, Fernando asks for oral sex from Elena before he leaves, but Ana\u00efs has had enough and tells them to let her sleep in peace. The next day, the girls and Fernando go to the beach. Ana\u00efs sits in the ocean in her new dress and sings to herself while Elena and Fernando go off alone together. Later, as the girls are reminiscing about their childhood together back at the house, Elena reveals Fernando gave her a ring while at the beach. Ana\u00efs openly expresses her suspicions about Fernando's intentions. That night, Elena gives up her virginity to Fernando as Ana\u00efs silently cries on the other side of the room.\n\nLater, Fernando's mother arrives at the vacation house, asking for the ring Fernando gave to Elena back, as it belongs to her and is one of a collection of pieces of jewelry from past lovers that she keeps. On discovering Elena and Fernando's relationship, their mother angrily decides to drive back from [[Les Mathes]] to their home in [[Paris]]. On the way back, she becomes tired and decides to sleep at a rest stop, where a man smashes the windshield of their car with an axe, kills Elena, and strangles their mother while ripping her clothes. When Ana\u00efs gets out of the car and starts backing away, he takes Ana\u00efs into the woods and rapes her. When the police arrive the next morning, Ana\u00efs, recalling her conversation with Elena about virginity, insists he did not rape her.\n\n==Cast==\n*Ana\u00efs Reboux as Ana\u00efs Pingot\n*[[Roxane Mesquida]] as Elena Pingot\n*[[Libero De Rienzo]] as Fernando\n*[[Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian]] as Mrs. Pingot\n*[[Romain Goupil]] as Fran\u00e7ois Pingot\n*[[Laura Betti]] as Fernando's mother\n*Albert Goldberg as the killer\n\n==Production==\nBreillat's experience during principal photography inspired her 2002 film ''[[Sex Is Comedy]]'', which revolves around shooting a sex scene from the film.
