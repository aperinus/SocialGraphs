Duhamel plays a [[firefighter]] forced to confront an [[Antitheist]] [[neo-Nazi]] [[murder]]er. The film was released [[direct-to-video]] on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on November 6, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing a grueling day of work, [[Long Beach, California]] firefighter Jeremy Thomas Coleman and his coworkers contemplate ending the day with a case of 15-year-old [[Scotch whisky]]. Jeremy enters a [[convenience store]] to buy snacks, but is interrupted by David Hagan, an [[Aryan Brotherhood]] crime boss. He accuses the store owner of refusing to sell his store which Hagan wants to further his criminal enterprise. The store owner says he [[Protection racket|buys protection]] from the [[Crips|Eastside Crips]] and the store is in their territory so it wouldn't be useful for Hagan's purposes.\n\nHagan kills the store owner's son and then the store owner. Jeremy narrowly escapes. Police detective Mike Cella, whose former partner was murdered by Hagan while they pursued him in a different case, sees an opportunity to bring Hagan to justice. Hagan is detained and put into a police lineup. Hagan, sure that Jeremy is behind the two-way mirror, recites Jeremy's full name, address and [[Social Security number]].\n\nBefore the trial, Jeremy agrees to enter the [[witness protection program]], and changes his last name to Douglas. He leaves the fire department and is moved to [[New Orleans]]. Although Jeremy finds it difficult to cope with the loss of his career, he finds consolation in his budding romance with Talia Durham, a Deputy [[United States Marshal]] assigned to his case. Later, Hagan's attorney, Harold Gethers, arranges for him to be released from prison in the weeks leading up to the trial. As a result, Jeremy and Talia find their lives in jeopardy when two of Hagan's hitmen ambush them; though Talia is wounded, Jeremy mortally wounds one man, forcing them to retreat. Hagan calls Jeremy, threatening to kill everyone he loves whether he testifies or not. Jeremy vows to kill Hagan first and abandons the witness protection program.\n\nJeremy returns home to Long Beach, where he seeks out the Eastside Crips to buy an [[Privately made firearm|untraceable weapon]]. Jeremy stakes out one of Hagan's hiding places and kills three of his men. He leaves behind fingerprints but the police can not identify him because his identity is protected by his [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|WITSEC]] status. Cella figures that Jeremy is behind the deaths. Jeremy grows bolder. He identifies the location of one of Hagan's buildings and tortures one of Hagan's men, who directs him to Gethers. Gethers, who only works for Hagan out of fear, gives Jeremy the location of an abandoned building where Hagan will be that night.\n\nTalia arrives at Long Beach and tries to convince Jeremy to abandon his plan. Jeremy locks Talia in the bathroom and gets away, but Hagan's hitman arrives soon after and kidnaps Talia. That night, Jeremy, using his firefighting knowledge, sets ablaze the building where Hagan and his men are meeting, killing Hagan's men. When Jeremy realizes Talia is also in the building, he puts on his fireman's suit and enters the building to rescue her. Talia manages to break free of her bonds and kills Hagan's hitman in revenge as he attempts to flee the blaze. Jeremy runs into Hagan inside the burning building and, after a struggle, Talia kills Hagan. Jeremy leaves the building with Talia. In the aftermath, Cella, while conversing with the [[district attorney]], states that no evidence was left behind at the burnt building to charge anyone with the deaths of Hagan and his men. Cella is seen putting away a photo of him and his old partner.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as Jeremy Coleman\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Lieutenant Mike Cella\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Deputy Talia Durham\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Hagan\n* [[Curtis Jackson]] as Lamar\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Harold Gether\n* [[Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson]] as Wallace\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Boyd\n* [[Arie Verveen]] as Darren\n* [[Eric Winter]] as Adam\n* [[Bonnie Somerville]] as Assistant District Attorney Karen Westlake\n* [[Julian McMahon]] as Robert\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Marshall Calvin Mullen\n* [[James Lesure]] as Craig\n* [[Nnamdi Asomugha]] as Sherrod\n\n==Release==\n''Fire with Fire'' was released direct-to-video in the United States on November 6, 2012.<ref name=release/> As of November 11, 2022, ''Fire with Fire'' grossed $2,500,277 in the United Arab Emirates, Italy, South Africa, Portugal, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Malaysia, and Hong Kong.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It also made $2,360,170 in domestic sales on home video.<ref name=gross>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fire-with-Fire-%282012%29#tab=summary|title=Fire with Fire|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|access-date=November 11, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 7% of 14 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 3.3/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fire_with_fire_2012/|title=Fire with Fire|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref> Mark Adams of [[Screen Daily]] wrote that it is a misfire with a story that is \"more silly than exciting\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/fire-with-fire/5052662.article|title=Fire with Fire|last=Adams|first=Mark|work=[[Screen Daily]]|date=2013-03-06|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>  Tom Huddleston of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' rated it 3/5 stars and called it \"a sturdy, unambitious but thoroughly watchable action thriller.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/fire-with-fire-2012|title=Fire With Fire (15)|last=Huddleston|first=Tom|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]|date=2013-03-06|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>  Nathan Rabin of ''[[The A.V.
