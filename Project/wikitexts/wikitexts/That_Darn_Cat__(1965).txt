The film was based on the 1963 novel ''[[Undercover Cat]]'' by [[Gordon Gordon|Gordon]] and [[Mildred Gordon (writer)|Mildred Gordon]]. The title song was written by the [[Sherman Brothers]] and sung by [[Bobby Darin]]. The [[That Darn Cat (1997 film)|1997 remake]] includes a cameo appearance by Dean Jones.\n\n''That Darn Cat!'' was both [[Hayley Mills]]' last film of the six she appeared in for the Walt Disney Studios, and [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]' first film for Disney.\n\n==Plot==\n\"Darn Cat\" or \"DC\" is a wily, adventurous [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] tomcat who lives with young suburbanite sisters Ingrid \"Inky\" ([[Dorothy Provine]]) and Patricia \"Patti\" Randall ([[Hayley Mills]]) and enjoys an evening route wandering thru town which includes teasing local dogs, swiping food, and marking vehicles with muddy paws.\n\nOne night, DC follows bank robber Iggy ([[Frank Gorshin]]) into an apartment where he and his partner Dan ([[Neville Brand]]) are holding bank employee Miss Margaret Miller ([[Grayson Hall]]) hostage. Miss Miller uses the opportunity to replace his collar with her watch, on which she has inscribed most of the word \"HELP,\" and releases him to go home to the Randalls.\n\nPatti discovers the watch on DC and suspects that it belongs to the kidnapped woman. She goes to the FBI and tells Agent Zeke Kelso ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]) of her discovery, and Supervisor Newton ([[Richard Eastham]]) assigns Kelso to follow DC in the hope that he will lead them back to the robbers' hideout.\n\nKelso sets up a headquarters in the Randalls' house and assigns a team to keep the cat under surveillance, but, despite multiple attempts and a bugging system, DC eludes them in humiliating and comedic ways, culminating in a chase where he leads Agent Kelso through several back yards and a [[Drive-in theater|drive-in theatre]]. As DC ends up trying to open a pigeon cage and is discovered by the owner Gregory Benson ([[Roddy McDowall]]), who is in Ingrid's carpool, chases DC and Kelso and, out of frustration, tells Ingrid he is leaving her carpool. The next day agent Kelso's supervisor Newton shuts down the operation, considering the evidence of the watch not hard enough, but Patti disguises herself as the [[hippie]] niece of her friend Mr. Hoffsteddar ([[Ed Wynn]]) the jeweler and persuades the FBI that the watch was indeed hard evidence. Patti and Kelso rescue Miss Miller and bring the robbers to justice.\n\nSubplots involve a romance between Patti's sister Ingrid and Kelso as he joins her new carpool, and a romance between Patti herself and a surf-obsessed [[slacker]] neighbor, Canoe Henderson (Tom Lowell), and the meddling of nosy neighbor Mrs. MacDougall ([[Elsa Lanchester]]) and her disapproving husband, Wilmer MacDougall ([[William Demarest]]). At the end, it is revealed that the gray cat in the opening sequence and DC are taking their kittens on the prowl, having started a family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* [[Hayley Mills]] as Patricia \"Patti\" Randall\n* [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as FBI Agent Zeke Kelso\n* [[Dorothy Provine]] as Ingrid Randall\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Gregory Benson\n* [[Neville Brand]] as Dan\n* [[Frank Gorshin]] as Iggy\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] as Mrs. MacDougall\n* [[William Demarest]] as Mr. Wilmer MacDougall\n* [[Tom Lowell]] as Canoe Henderson\n* [[Ed Wynn]] as Mr. Hofstedder the Jeweller\n* [[Richard Eastham]] as FBI Supervisor Mr. Newton\n* [[Liam Sullivan]] as Agent Graham\n* [[Grayson Hall]] as Ms. Margaret Miller\n* [[Iris Adrian]] as Mrs. Tabin the Landlady\n* [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] as the drive-in theater manager\n* [[Ben Lessy]] as Burton the drive-in concessionaire\n* [[Don Dorrell]] as Spires\n* Gene Blakely as Cahill\n* [[Karl Held]] as Kelly\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe exterior neighborhood scenes were filmed on [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|The Walt Disney Studios]] [[backlot]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California.\n\nEach of the [[Siamese cat|Seal Point Siamese cat]]s who collectively play the role of DC is a so-called [[Thai cat|\"traditional\" or \"old style\" Siamese]], as opposed to the more dainty, long and tubular modern Siamese show cat.
