Produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], it features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Meryl Streep]], [[Emily Blunt]], [[James Corden]], [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Chris Pine]], [[Tracey Ullman]], [[Christine Baranski]], [[Lilla Crawford]], [[Daniel Huttlestone]], [[MacKenzie Mauzy]], [[Billy Magnussen]], and [[Johnny Depp]]. Inspired by the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm Brothers]]' fairy tales of \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\", \"[[Cinderella]]\", \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]\", and \"[[Rapunzel]]\", the film is centered on a childless couple who set out to end a curse placed on them by a vengeful witch. Ultimately, the characters are forced to experience the unintended consequences of their actions.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts by other studios and producers to adapt the musical to film, Disney announced in 2012 that it was producing an adaptation, with Marshall directing and John DeLuca serving as producer. [[Principal photography]] commenced in September 2013, and took place entirely in the [[United Kingdom]], including at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[London]].\n\n''Into the Woods'' held its [[Premiere|world premiere]] at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in [[New York City]] on December 8, 2014, and was released theatrically in the United States on December 25, 2014. The film was commercially successful and received generally positive reviews, receiving praise for its acting performances (particularly Streep), visual style, production merits, and musical numbers, but received criticism for its lighter tone compared to the source material, and the changes made for the film adaptation. It grossed $213 million worldwide. ''Into the Woods'' was named one of the top 11 [[American Film Institute Awards 2014|best films of 2014]] by the [[American Film Institute]]; the film received three [[Academy Award]] nominations, including a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] nomination for Streep, and three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n<!-- NOTE: The plot summary does NOT intend to reproduce the experience of watching, nor is it meant to cover EVERY detail.

The Witch had previously found the baker's father robbing her garden when the baker's mother was pregnant, demanding their baby in return. Because the Baker's father also stole some magic beans, the Witch's own mother punished her with the curse of ugliness. The Witch is able to lift the curse and allow the Baker and his wife to have a child, but only if they obtain four critical items for a potion to break her curse first: a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold, none of which she is allowed to touch.\n\nThe Witch's demands eventually bring the Baker and his wife into contact with Jack, who is selling his beloved [[house cow|cow]], Milky-White, and to whom the Baker offers the magic beans left to him by his father, which Jack's mother accidentally grows into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood, whose red cape the couple noticed when she stopped by the bakery earlier to buy and steal bread and sweets on her way to her grandmother's house; with blonde-haired Rapunzel (the Witch's adopted daughter and Baker's biological sister), whose tower the Baker's wife finds in the woods; and with Cinderella, who runs into the Baker's wife while fleeing from the pursuing Prince and whose ball outfit includes gold slippers.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://princess.disney.com/cinderellas-story | title=Cinderella's Story }}</ref>\n\nAfter a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the Baker and his wife are finally able to gather the necessary items. After the Witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion, each of the characters receives a \"[[happy ending]]\". The Baker and his wife have a son; Cinderella marries the Prince; Rapunzel is freed from the Witch by the Prince's brother, whom she marries; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the [[Giant]] in the sky, courtesy of the beanstalk, and kills the pursuing Giant by cutting down the beanstalk; and Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are saved from the [[Big Bad Wolf]].\n\nHowever, each of the characters learn that their endings don't remain happy: the Baker is worried that he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the Baker's wife lets the Prince temporarily seduce her; Cinderella is disenchanted by her cheating Prince; and the Witch learns that she has lost her powers in exchange for her youth and beauty, after being rejected by Rapunzel, who then runs off with her Prince. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the Giant's widow to climb down and threaten the kingdom if no one delivers Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters attempt to find and protect Jack. In the process, Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother, Jack's mother and the Baker's wife are killed. The Baker, Cinderella, Jack and Red Riding Hood all blame each other for their individual actions that led to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the Witch for growing the beans in the first place. She curses them all for their inability to accept any responsibility, as well as their refusal to do the \"right thing\" (handing Jack over). Casting all the remaining beans away, the Witch begs her mother to punish her again, and she abandons the group by melting into a large pit of boiling tar.\n\nThe remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening Giant's widow, though they discuss the complicated morality of retribution and revenge in the process. They lure the Giant's widow into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls with a tree crushing her. With the Giant's widow dead, the characters move forward with their lives as they are. The Baker, thinking of his wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave her Prince and help the Baker with Jack and Red Riding Hood, as they are now orphans, and will be moving into the bakery. The Baker comforts his son by telling the story of the film as the movie ends with the Witch's moral (\"Children will Listen\"), which means children can change due to the parent's actions and behaviors.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as The Witch<ref name=PunchBlanchardCast>{{cite news|last=Yamato|first=Jen|title=Tony-Nominated Tammy Blanchard Headed 'Into The
