MacDonald]]'s 1957 novel, ''[[The Executioners (MacDonald novel)|The Executioners]]''. It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Joe Don Baker]] and [[Juliette Lewis]]. [[Robert Mitchum]] plays a small role in the film, while [[Gregory Peck]] (in his [[List of Gregory Peck performances#Film|final theatrical film role]]) and [[Martin Balsam]] [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]; all three starred in the original film.<ref>{{cite book |first=Kirsten |last=Thompson |author-link=Kirsten Moana Thompson |chapter=Chapter 6: ''Cape Fear'' and Trembling: Familial Dread |title=Literature and Film: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Film Adaptation |editor1-first=Robert |editor1-last=Stam |editor1-link=Robert Stam |editor2-first=Alessandra |editor2-last=Raengo |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |date=2005 |ISBN=0631230556 |pages=126\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nThe film tells the story of a [[Conviction|convicted]] violent [[Statutory rape|statutory rapist]], who, mostly by using his newfound knowledge of the law and its numerous [[Legal Loophole|loopholes]], seeks vengeance against a former [[public defender]], whom he blames for his 14-year imprisonment because of the purposefully faulty defense tactics used during his trial.\n\n''Cape Fear'' marks the [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|seventh collaboration between Scorsese and De Niro]]. The film was a commercial success and garnered positive reviews, receiving [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for Best Actor (De Niro) and Best Supporting Actress ([[Juliette Lewis]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\nSam Bowden is a lawyer living in New Essex, [[North Carolina (U.S. state)|North Carolina]] with his wife Leigh and teenage daughter Danielle (\"Danny\"). [[Max Cady]], a former client of his, is released from prison after 14 years. Max was tried for [[statutory rape]] and battery of a 16-year-old girl and, appalled by the attack, Sam buried evidence of the victim's [[promiscuity]] and Max's unawareness of her actual age, which might have lessened the latter's sentence or even secured his acquittal.\n\nSam believes that Max, who was illiterate at the time of his conviction, remains unaware of his purposefully botched defense. Unbeknownst to him, however, his former client is a naturally intelligent and single-minded [[psychopath]]; he learned how to read and studied law in prison, and even unsuccessfully appealed his own conviction several times. He tracks Sam down and begins to terrorize the Bowden family; he lurks near the property and the family dog is mysteriously killed. Sam attempts to have Max arrested but the police have no evidence of a crime. Max intentionally crosses paths in a bar with County Courthouse [[Law clerk|clerk]] Lori Davis, who is in love with Sam, then rapes and beats her nearly to death. Despite Sam's advice, she refuses to press charges out of fear that their ongoing platonic flirtation becomes public, as well as unwillingness to be cross-examined and humiliated by her own colleagues. Sam hires a private investigator, Claude Kersek, to follow Max.\n\nMax approaches Danny by impersonating her new drama teacher and feigning an unorthodox interest in her teenage angst. He lures her to the school theater, shares a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] with her, manipulates her libido and attraction to him and kisses her. Her parents find the joint in her schoolbook, and Danny's coyness about the extent of Max's seduction drives Sam to the point of desperation. He then agrees to Kersek's plan, which he had dismissed earlier, to have Max beaten up. Sam also gives Max a final warning, which the latter secretly tapes with a hidden recorder. Kersek's three hired thugs accost and beat Max as Sam watches from afar, but Max turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them instead. Max then uses the recording of Sam's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Sam. Lee Heller (Max's lawyer) also petitions the [[American Bar Association|ABA]] Ethics Committee for Sam's [[disbarment]], thereby triggering a two-day emergency meeting in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]].\n\nKersek anticipates Max's intention to enter the Bowden house while Sam is in Raleigh; the family fakes Sam's departure and hides in the house, hoping that Max will break in, so that he can be shot in self-defense. However, Max kills the Bowden's housekeeper Graciela and dons her clothing before murdering Kersek by [[garrote|garroting]] him with a piano wire and shooting him with his own pistol. Horrified after discovering the bodies, the Bowdens flee to their houseboat docked upstate along the [[Cape Fear River]].\n\nMax, who has followed the family, attacks Sam and prepares to rape Leigh and Danny while making Sam watch. Danny sprays Max with lighter fluid as he lights a cigar, engulfing him in flames and causing him to jump off the boat. However, Max clings to a rope and pulls himself back on board. As the boat is rocked by a violent thunderstorm and the raging river, a badly burned and deranged Max confronts Sam, putting him on a [[mock trial]] for his deliberate negligence 14 years ago. Despite Sam's insistence that Max bragged about beating two prior rape charges and that his crime was too heinous for the promiscuity report to be taken into account, Max berates him for failing to do his duty as a lawyer.\n\nThe storm eventually knocks Max off his feet, allowing Sam to gain the upper hand once the women jump off the boat and make it to shore. Sam uses Max's handcuffs to shackle the latter to the boat. When the boat hits a rock and is destroyed, the fight continues on shore, but a raging tide carries Max away and he drowns [[speaking in tongues]] and singing the hymn \"On Jordan's Stormy Banks I Stand\". Sam washes the blood from his hands before he rejoins Leigh and Danny, who realize that things will never be the same again for them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Max Cady]]\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Sam Bowden\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Leigh Bowden\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Danielle Bowden\n* [[Joe Don Baker]] as Claude Kersek\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as Lieutenant Elgart\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Lee Heller\n* [[Illeana Douglas]] as Lori Davis\n* [[Fred Thompson]] as Tom Broadbent\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Judge\n* [[Zully Montero]] as Graciela\n* [[Domenica Cameron-Scorsese]] as Dani's girlfriend\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was adapted by [[Wesley Strick]] from the original [[screenplay]] by [[James R. Webb (writer)|James R. Webb]], which was an adaptation from the novel ''[[The Executioners (MacDonald novel)|The Executioners]]'' by [[John D. MacDonald]].\n\nIt was originally developed by [[Steven Spielberg]], who eventually decided it was too violent and traded it to Scorsese to get back ''[[Schindler's List]]'', which Scorsese had decided not to make. Scorsese eventually agreed to do ''Cape Fear'' because Universal did support ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MIP_TomPollock_Interview.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu |access-date=11 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003040133/https://www.carseywolf.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MIP_TomPollock_Interview.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2021 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\nSpielberg stayed on as a producer, through his [[Amblin Entertainment]], but chose not to be credited personally on the finished film.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CEED9113FF933A25752C1A967958260 | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | title=FILM; Martin Scorsese Ventures Back To 'Cape Fear' | date=1991-11-10}}</ref>\n\nDespite having worked with Nolte in ''[[New York Stories]]'' (1989), Scorsese did not have him in mind to portray Sam Bowden and wanted [[Harrison Ford]] to play the part instead. Ford, however, agreed to do the film only if he was going to portray Max Cady. Nolte, who was interested in portraying Bowden, managed to convince Scorsese to cast him for the part. In addition, [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]] both auditioned for the part of Danielle Bowden and Spielberg reportedly wanted [[Bill Murray]] to portray Cady.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cormier|first=Roger|title=15 Intense Facts About ''Cape Fear''|date=November 16, 2016|magazine=[[Mental Floss]]|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88173/15-intense-facts-about-cape-fear|access-date=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 6'0\" Nick Nolte is taller than the 5'9\" Robert De Niro, but for the movie, Nolte lost weight and De Niro developed muscles until he appeared to be the stronger man.\n\nThe work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was also influential on the style of ''Cape Fear''. As with [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|the 1962 film version]], where director [[J. Lee Thompson]] specifically acknowledged Hitchcock's influence, strove to use Hitchcock's style, and had [[Bernard Herrmann]] write the score, Scorsese made his version in the Hitchcock manner, especially through the use of unusual camera angles, lighting, and editing techniques. Additionally, Scorsese's version has opening credits designed by regular Hitchcock collaborator [[Saul Bass]], and the link to Hitchcock is cemented by the reuse of the original score by Herrmann, albeit reworked by [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cape-fear-film-score-mc0002394599|title=Cape Fear, film score|work=AllMusic}}</ref> Portions of Bass's title sequences are reused from the unreleased ending to his film ''[[Phase IV (1974 film)|Phase IV]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box-office success, making $182,291,969 worldwide<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=capefear.htm | title=Cape Fear (1991) - Box Office Mojo | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | access-date=2010-01-24}}</ref> on a $35-million budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 74% based on 53 reviews, with an average score of 7/10.

This parody was itself the basis for [[Anne Washburn]]'s play ''[[Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play]]'', which imagines post-apocalyptic theatre troupes attempting to recreate the episode, and by extension the two films and the novel.\n\nThe film was parodied as ''Cape Munster'' in the premiere episode of ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'', with [[Ben Stiller]] playing an adult [[Eddie Munster]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Jicha |first=Tom |title=TOO MUCH TV AS A KID WAS GOOD FOR BEN STILLER |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1992-09-26-9201230763-story.html |access-date=June 4, 2021 |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |date=September 26, 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Ben Stiller Show' may become best-kept secret on TV |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1992-10-07-1992281114-story.html |access-date=June 4, 2021 |work=[[Orange County Register]] |date=October 7, 1992 |via=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=King |first=Susan |title=A two-disc treasure for 'Pirates' lovers |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-dec-04-wk-video4-story.html |access-date=June 4, 2021 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=December 4, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n* [[List of 1991 box office number-one films in the United States]]\n* [[Night and the City (1992 film)|''Night and the City'']], another remake also starring De Niro and Lange\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Thain, Gerald J. 2001. \"Cape Fear, Two Versions and Two Visions Separated by Thirty Years.\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=E9snGGV1X5MC&printsec=frontcover ''Law and Film: Representing Law in Movies''], edited by S.
