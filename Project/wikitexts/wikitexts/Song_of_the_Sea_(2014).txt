On Saoirse's birthday, they are visited by their grandmother, who regards the lighthouse as an unfit place to raise the children. That night, Ben scares Saoirse with a story of [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Mac Lir]] and his mother [[Macha]], the Owl Witch, who stole his feelings and turned him to stone. Later, Saoirse plays a seashell horn given to Ben by their mother, leading her to a white sealskin coat in Conor's closet. She puts on the coat and walks to a group of seals in the sea, revealing herself as a [[selkie]]. After swimming, she is found by Granny on the seashore, who insists upon taking the children to her home on the Mainland. Conor reluctantly agrees despite Ben's protests, locks the coat in a chest, and throws it into the sea.\n\nOn [[Halloween]], Saoirse plays Ben's seashell, alerting the [[Fairies|Faeries]] called \"[[Aos S\u00ed|Na Daoine S\u00eddhe]]\" to her. She and Ben attempt to go home, but encounter the Faeries, who hope she will allow them to return to the [[T\u00edr na n\u00d3g]]. However, they are attacked by Macha's owls, turning the Faeries to stone. The siblings flee the spot and take a country bus, and run into C\u00fa, who had followed them. However, Saoirse is growing ill, due to not having her seal coat and being away from the ocean. They come across a [[holy well]], which Saoirse dives into. Ben follows her and meets the [[Seancha\u00ed|Great Seanacha\u00ed]]: they learn Saoirse was kidnapped by Macha, and she is mute because she needs the coat and will soon die if she does not get it back. He gives Ben one of his hairs that will lead him to Macha. As he follows the hair, it shows him that Bronagh \u2013 a selkie herself \u2013 was forced to return to the ocean on the night of Saoirse's birth, leaving her husband and children behind. Since Ben found the truth, the walls of hair open, showing him a way out and to the house. The Faeries who turned to stone speak out to warn Ben to avoid the jars, tell him to be careful and brave, and wish him good luck.\n\nBen then meets Macha, who explains that when Mac Lir suffered from a broken heart, she turned him into an island near their home. She is determined to do likewise for everyone, even herself, to spare them pain. Ben manages to rescue Saoirse, giving Macha back her feelings and allowing her to recognize that taking away feelings doesn't help. She helps to fly them back home along with two Faerie dogs, and Conor attempts to take Saoirse to a hospital. Ben dives into the sea in search of Saoirse's coat and recovers it with the seals\u2019 help. After Conor brings him on the boat, Saoirse's coat is put on her, and her voice surprises Ben and Conor. Saoirse's coat changes her into a little seal. Ben rides on her back and his father rides on another seal's back to Mac Lir's island. The group is then washed up on Mac Lir's island, but Saoirse's health is not fully restored. Ben tries to get Saoirse to sing, and she eventually sings the Song of the Sea. The song causes Saoirse's health to be fully restored, along with the faeries and spirits whom Macha had turned to stone, and opens the way to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g.\n\nBronagh appears to take Saoirse to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g with her, but Ben and Conor plead to let Saoirse stay with them, because she's all they have. Since she is half-human, the choice rests with Saoirse, who elects to remain behind with her father and brother, even though it means giving up her selkie powers and becoming fully human, if Bronagh takes Saoirse's coat to untangle their worlds. Accepting her daughter's decision, Bronagh takes her coat. Conor tells Bronagh that he loves her so much, and they kiss. Ben asks Bronagh to stay as well, but she is unable to and tells him to remember her in his stories and songs and that she'll always love him, before kissing her son's forehead. After a tearful farewell, Ben and his family happily return home to their island, where Granny finally arrives, and Conor tells her he's now well enough to take care of the children.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the family is shown happily painting a mural of their home, Bronagh, and the Faeries and celebrating Ben's birthday, and Ben and Saoirse, now closer than ever, go swimming with C\u00fa and the seals in the ocean.\n\n==Voice cast==\n\n=== English ===\n\n* [[David Rawle]] as Ben\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Conor and the [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Mac Lir]]\n* [[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Granny and [[Macha]]\n* [[Lisa Hannigan]] as Bronagh;<ref name=\":0\">Her name is spelt as \"Bronach\" in the credits.</ref> Ben and Saoirse's mother\n* Lucy O'Connell as Saoirse\n* [[Jon Kenny]] as Ferry Dan and The Great [[Seanacha\u00ed]]\n* [[Pat Shortt]] as Lug\n* [[Colm \u00d3 Snodaigh]] as Mossy\n* [[Liam Hourican]] as Spud and Bus Driver\n* Kevin Swierszcz as Young Ben\n* Will Collins as Additional voices\n* [[Paul Young (producer)|Paul Young]] as Additional voices\n\n=== Irish ===\n* James \u00d3 Floinn as Ben\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Conor and the [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Mac Lir]]\n*[[Fionnula Flanagan]] as Granny and [[Macha]]\n*Gr\u00e1inne Bleasdale as Bronagh<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Fion\u00e1n Farley Nolan as Saoirse\n*[[Maurice O'Donoghue]] as the Great Seancha\u00ed\n*Donncha Crowley as Lug\n*Niall McDonagh as Mossy, Ferry Dan, and Rock Shee<!-- Who Rock Shee is? -->\n*[[Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in]] as Spud and Bus Driver\n*R\u00edona Farley Nolan as Young Ben\n\n=== Scottish Gaelic ===\n* [[Kathleen MacInnes|Kathleen NicAonghais]] as Ben\n* D\u00e0ibhidh Walker as Conor, Mac Lir and Rock Shee\n* Donna Nic 'Ille Mhoire as Macha\n* Catherine Tinney as Saoirse and Young Ben\n* M\u00e0iri Nic 'Ille Mhoire as Bronagh\n* Ailig D\u00f2mhnallach as Ferry Dan and Lug\n* Anna Mhoireach as Granny\n* Iain MacFhionghain as Mossy and Bus Driver\n* Iain MacRath as Spud and the Great Seancha\u00ed\n\n=== French ===\n* Jean-Stan DuPac as Ben\n* Patrick B\u00e9thune as Connor \n* [[Nolwenn Leroy]] as Bruna\n* Nathalie Homs as Granny and Macha\n* Cyrille Artaux as Lug\n* Pascal Sellem as Spud\n* Thisb\u00e9e Vidal-Lefebvre as Young Ben\n* Marc Perez as Mossy\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Song of the Sea\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Bruno Coulais]] & [[K\u00edla]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|2014|1|1|df=y}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=54|s=02}}\n| label      = [[Universal Music Group]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe original music for the film was composed by [[Bruno Coulais]], in collaboration with the Irish group [[K\u00edla]]. \"The Derry Tune\" originally featured on K\u00edla's 2010 album ''Sois\u00edn''.
