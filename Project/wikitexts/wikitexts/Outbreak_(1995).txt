It is primarily set in the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the fictional town of Cedar Creek, California. ''Outbreak''{{'s}} plot speculates how far military and civilian agencies might go to contain the spread of a deadly, contagious disease.\n\nThe film, released on March 10, 1995, was a box-office success, and Spacey won two awards for his performance. A real-life outbreak of the Ebola virus was occurring in Zaire when the film was released.<ref name=CDC/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As WP:FILMPLOT requires, the plot summary should be no less and no more than 400\u2013700 words. -->\n{{cquote|The single biggest threat to man's continued dominance on the planet is the virus.|author=[[Joshua Lederberg]], Ph.D., Nobel laureate |source=Film introduction: ''Outbreak'' (1995)}}\nIn 1967, during the [[Kisangani Mutinies]], a virus called Motaba, which causes a [[viral hemorrhagic fever|deadly fever]], is discovered in the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|African]] jungle. To keep the virus a secret, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officers Donald McClintock and Billy Ford destroy the camp where soldiers were infected.\n\nTwenty-eight years later, Colonel Sam Daniels, a [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases|USAMRIID]] virologist, is sent to investigate an outbreak in [[Zaire]]. He and his crew\u2014Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler and new recruit Major Salt\u2014gather information and return to the United States. Ford, now a brigadier general and Daniels' superior officer, dismisses the latter's fears that the virus will spread.\n\nA [[white-headed capuchin]] monkey that is host to the virus is smuggled into the country. James \"Jimbo\" Scott, a worker at an [[animal testing]] laboratory, is infected when he steals the monkey to sell on the [[black market]]. Jimbo fails to sell the monkey to Rudy Alvarez (who also becomes infected), a pet-store owner in the coastal-[[California]] village of Cedar Creek. After releasing the monkey into the woods outside of the nearby community of Palisades, he develops symptoms on a flight to [[Boston]] and infects his girlfriend, Alice. Their illness is investigated by Dr. Roberta Keough, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] scientist and Daniels' ex-wife. Jimbo, Alice, and Rudy die, but Keough determines that no one else in Boston was infected.\n\nA hospital technician in Cedar Creek is infected when he accidentally breaks the vial of Rudy's blood. The virus quickly mutates into a strain capable of spreading like [[influenza]], becoming [[Airborne transmission|airborne]] and causing a number of people to be infected in a movie theater. Daniels flies to Cedar Creek against Ford's orders, joining Keough's team with Schuler and Salt. As they begin a search for the monkey, the Army quarantines the town and imposes [[martial law]]. Schuler is infected when his suit tears and Keough accidentally sticks herself with a contaminated needle while treating him.\n\nWhen Ford provides an experimental serum which cures the original strain, Daniels realizes that his superiors were aware of the virus before the outbreak. Daniels learns about Operation Clean Sweep, a plan for the military to contain the virus by bombing Cedar Creek, incinerating the town and its residents, ostensibly to prevent Motaba's expansion to pandemic proportions. However, McClintock, now a major general, plans to use the operation to conceal the mutated virus' existence so the original strain can be preserved for use as a [[biological weapon]].\n\nTo prevent Daniels from finding a cure, McClintock orders him arrested for carrying the virus. Daniels escapes before he and Salt fly a helicopter to the ship at sea which carried the monkey. Daniels obtains a picture of the monkey and releases it to the media; a Palisades resident, Mrs. Jeffries, realizes that her daughter Kate has been playing with the monkey (which she named Betsy) and calls the CDC. Daniels and Salt arrive at the Jeffries' house where Salt tranquilizes Betsy after Kate coaxes her out of hiding in the woods nearby. When he learns from Daniels about Betsy's capture, Ford delays the bombing.\n\nOn their return flight, Daniels and Salt are chased by McClintock in another helicopter. Salt fires two rockets into the trees to deceive him into thinking that they crashed. Once back in Cedar Creek, Salt mixes Betsy's [[antibody|antibodies]] with Ford's serum to create an [[antiserum]]; although Schuler has died, they save Keough. McClintock returns to base and resumes Operation Clean Sweep, refusing to listen to Ford. Daniels and Salt fly their helicopter directly into the path of the bomber's approach to its target.\n\nWith Ford's help, Daniels persuades the bomber's flight crew to detonate the bomb over water and spare the town. Before McClintock can order another bombing, Ford relieves him of command and orders his arrest. Daniels and Keough reconcile as Cedar Creek's residents are cured.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Colonel]] Sam Daniels, MD\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Dr. Roberta \"Robby\" Keough, MD\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as [[Brigadier General]] William \"Billy\" Ford, MD\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[Major General]] Donald \"Donnie\" McClintock\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Casey Schuler, MD\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as [[Major]] Salt, MD\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as James \"Jimbo\" Scott\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Dr. Benjamin Iwabi\n* Malick Bowens as Dr. Raswani\n* Susan Lee Hoffman as Dr. Lisa Aronson\n* [[Benito Martinez (actor)|Benito Martinez]] as Dr. Julio Ruiz\n* [[Bruce Jarchow]] as Dr. Mascelli\n* Leland Hayward III as Henry Seward\n* Daniel Chodos as Rudy Alvarez\n* [[Dale Dye]] as [[Lieutenant]] Colonel Briggs\n* [[Diana Bellamy]] as Mrs. Pananides\n* [[J.
