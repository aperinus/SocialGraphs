Released on 3 October 2012 in France by [[EuropaCorp]] and 5 October 2012 in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]], the film grossed over $376 million at the box office, but received negative reviews from critics. A third film, ''[[Taken 3]]'', was released on 9 January 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the funeral of his son Marko and associates in [[Tropoj\u00eb]], [[Albanian mafia]] head and freelance terrorist Murad Hoxha vows to seek vengeance on his son's killer. Travelling to [[Paris]] with his men, he interrogates and tortures ex-French [[Directorate-General for External Security|DGSE]] agent turned corrupt [[National Police (France)|National Police]] officer Jean-Claude Pitrel, whose business card was found at the scene of Marko's death, but finds no information. He then bribes a corrupt police official for Pitrel's files and deduces that Pitrel's old friend, Bryan Mills, was responsible and is vacationing in [[Istanbul]].\n\nMeanwhile, Bryan has just finished his three-day security job for a wealthy Saudi Arabian sheikh in Istanbul and is surprised by his ex-wife, Lenore, and daughter, Kim, turning up to visit him. While going out for lunch with Lenore the next day, Bryan spots Murad's men following them. He tells Lenore to run and tries to outrun the Albanians, but finally surrenders when they capture Lenore. Realising that Kim is also a target, Bryan calls her at the hotel and tells her to hide in closet to escape the kidnappers . She narrowly avoids capture when the kidnappers are forced to flee after they shoot two security guards.\n\nRegaining consciousness, Bryan finds himself [[cable tie|zip tied]] to a pipe over his head in an empty basement. He uses a concealed miniature cellphone hidden in his sock to contact Kim and instructs her to alert the American embassy; instead, she convinces him to let her help. Opening her father's equipment case, Kim takes a grenade and detonates it on a nearby rooftop; the resulting sound allows Bryan to instruct her on triangulating his location.\n\nThe mobsters bring in Lenore, make a small incision in her neck, and hang her upside down to bleed out. As soon as they leave, Bryan frees himself and then her. He next has Kim detonate two more grenades and releases some steam through a chimney to guide her to his location. Kim tosses a gun down the chimney, which Bryan uses to kill the guards holding him captive. He rescues Kim, but watches Lenore get recaptured. Stealing a taxi, Bryan and Kim pursue the kidnappers' van, and an SUV driven by one of the kidnappers' henchmen arrives to distract them. A chase and shootout ensue, alerting Turkish police, and ends when Bryan manages to lure the SUV into the path of an oncoming train, taking it out.\n\nLeaving Kim at the American embassy, Bryan uses his memory to find Murad's hideout. He rescues Lenore and pursues the surviving mobsters to a bathhouse, where he kills them. Confronting Murad, Bryan offers to let him walk if he agrees to return home and cease his desire for revenge. Murad agrees, and Bryan drops his gun, but Murad tries to kill Bryan, only to find the gun unloaded. Realizing that Murad will never drop his vendetta against him, Bryan kills him by impaling him with a sharp towel hook.\n\nThree weeks later, the Mills family, at a diner back in Los Angeles, has milkshakes to celebrate Kim passing her driving test. They are joined, much to Bryan's surprise, by Kim's boyfriend, Jamie, and she jokingly tells her father not to \"shoot this one.\"\n\n==Alternative version==\nIn an alternative version, Bryan rescues Lenore after she is recaptured. The taxi chase then takes place with Bryan, Kim and Lenore eventually making it to the American embassy. He then leaves them both at the Embassy to \"finish it.\" Olivier Megaton decided against that version since questions arose over Bryan's motivation for pursuing Murad. It is included as an extra on the DVD and Blu-ray releases.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Bryan Mills\n* [[Maggie Grace]] as Kim Mills\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Lenore 'Lennie' Mills-St. John\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Murad Hoxha\n* [[Leland Orser]] as Sam Gilroy\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Mark Casey\n* [[D.
