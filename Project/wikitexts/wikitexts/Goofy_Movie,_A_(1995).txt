Directed by [[Kevin Lima]], the film is based on [[The Disney Afternoon]] television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' created by [[Robert Taylor (animator)|Robert Taylor]] and [[Michael Peraza|Michael Peraza Jr.]], and serves as a standalone [[sequel|follow-up]] to the show. It features the voices of [[Bill Farmer]], [[Jason Marsden]], [[Jim Cummings]], [[Kellie Martin]], [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Pauly Shore]], [[Jenna von O\u00ff]], and [[Wallace Shawn]]. Taking place three years after the events of ''Goof Troop'', the film follows [[Goofy]] and his son, [[Max Goof|Max]], who is now in high school, and revolves around the father-son relationship between the two as Goofy embarks on a misguided mission to bond with his son by taking him on a cross-country fishing trip.\n\nDisney came up with the idea to make a theatrical animated film starring Goofy while considering ideas for a potential ''Goof Troop'' TV special. Lima wanted to expand out Goofy as a character and \"give him an emotional side\" that would resonate with audiences. Most of the cast from the show, including Farmer, Paulsen, and Cummings, reprised their roles while [[Dana Hill]] was replaced by Marsden as Max's voice due to the character's age difference. Furthermore, R&B artist [[Tevin Campbell]] provided the vocals for Powerline, a fictional celebrity musician who prominently appears in the film, performing the songs \"Stand Out\" and \"I 2 I\".\n\n''A Goofy Movie'' was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on April 7, 1995, by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. Because the film had been greenlighted by the recently fired [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], the film's release was deemed by Disney to be merely a contractual obligation. Its initial release made a meager impression at the box office, grossing $37.6 million against an $18 million production cost, and received mixed reviews from critics. However, with its home media release, the film garnered a [[cult following]], and since 2015 it has become a more prominent property within Disney. A [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] to the film titled ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' was released on February 29, 2000.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\n[[Goofy]] is the single father of his 14-year-old son [[Max Goof]], with whom he has a tense relationship due to Max's fears of turning into his father. On the last day of school before summer vacation, Max and his best friends [[Pete Junior|P.J.]] and Robert \"Bobby\" Zimuruski hijack the auditorium in the middle of Principal Mazur's speech, creating a small concert where Max performs, while dressed as the pop singer Powerline. The performance succeeds in making Max a school celebrity and impressing his love interest, Roxanne, but he, P.J., and Bobby are sent to Mazur's office. While waiting outside of the office, Roxanne speaks with Max and accepts his offer to go with him to a party where Powerline's concert will be viewed live on television. However, Mazur warns Goofy that Max's behavior may result in him facing [[capital punishment]].\n\nOblivious to Max's plans with Roxanne and fearing for his son's future, Goofy decides to take Max on a fishing trip from their home state of Ohio to Lake Destiny, Idaho, following a cross-country map route he and his father took years ago in the 1960s. Before they leave town, Max manages to stop by Roxanne's house to call off their date, but when the heartbroken Roxanne mentions going with someone else, Max panics and instead fabricates a story about his father knowing Powerline, telling her he will be on stage at the concert.\n\nDespite his son's objections, Goofy plans his own trip, with initially disastrous results. Max angrily hurts his father's feelings after Goofy inadvertently humiliates Max at an [[opossum]]-based theme park. Later, [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and P.J. happen to meet up with them while camping by a lake. While P.J. informs Max of how all their peers back home anticipate seeing him onstage at the Powerline concert, Pete urges Goofy to keep Max under control. Goofy takes his son fishing and shows him the Perfect Cast fishing technique, accidentally luring [[Bigfoot]] to their camp. Pete and P.J. flee, leaving Goofy and Max to spend the night with Bigfoot. That night, while Goofy sleeps, Max alters the map's route to [[Los Angeles]], where the concert is taking place.\n\nThe next morning, Goofy decides to make Max the navigator of the trip. The two go to different locations that satisfy both of them. Eventually, they stop by a motel where they meet Pete and P.J. again. When Pete overhears a conversation between the boys, he tells Goofy that Max has tricked him into traveling to Los Angeles. The next day, Goofy and Max come to a junction: one leading to [[Idaho]], the other to [[California]]. Max chooses the route to California, making a frustrated Goofy stop the car at the [[Grand Canyon]] and storm off. With the brake loose, the car drives off on its own; Goofy and Max chase after it and end up in the [[Colorado River]]. After a heated argument, Goofy says no matter how old Max gets he will always be his son, and the two finally reconcile with each other. After learning of Max's promise to Roxanne, Goofy decides to take him to the concert in Los Angeles. The two nearly plummet to their deaths down a waterfall, but Max saves Goofy using the Perfect Cast technique.\n\nGoofy and Max arrive at the concert, and while attempting to sneak backstage, they end up onstage and dance with Powerline, watched by Pete, P.J. and Roxanne on separate televisions. Goofy and Max later return to Roxanne's house in their damaged car. Max tells the truth to Roxanne, though she accepts it and admits she always had feelings for him, ever since the first time she ever heard him utter his father's trademark laugh; thus, a relationship starts between them. Goofy's car suddenly explodes because of the damage it had sustained, ejecting Goofy in the process, who then falls through the porch roof of Roxanne's house, and Max introduces him to Roxanne.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|align=right|total_width=300\n|image1=Bill Farmer, 2010 NFFC Disney Legend Award (crop).jpg\n|image2=Jasonm12.jpg\n|footer=[[Bill Farmer]] (left) and [[Jason Marsden]] respectively voiced the lead characters [[Goofy]] and [[Max Goof]].\n}}\n* [[Jason Marsden]] as [[Max Goof|Maximilian \"Max\" Goof]], Goofy's troubled teenage son.  \n**[[Aaron Lohr]] provides Max's singing voice.\n* [[Bill Farmer]] as [[Goofy]], a hard-working, clumsy single father who is a photographer at a photo studio in a mall department store.\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]], Goofy's colleague whom he and Max encounter during their road trip.\n* [[Kellie Martin]] as Roxanne, Max's kind-hearted high school crush.\n* [[Rob Paulsen]] as [[Pete Junior|P.J.]], Pete's son and Max's best friend.\n* [[Pauly Shore]] (uncredited) as Robert \"Bobby\" Zimuruski, Max and P.J.'s close friend from school.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Principal Mazur, the strict principal of Max's school.\n* [[Jenna von O\u00ff]] as Stacey, Roxanne's best friend and student class president.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Bigfoot]], a cryptid who lives in the forest.\n* [[Tevin Campbell]] as Powerline, a famous pop star celebrity admired by Max and his peers.\n\nAlong with the main and supporting cast, [[Kevin Lima]] portrayed Lester the Possum, a walk-around character at Lester's Possum Park, and also voiced Roxanne's father.
