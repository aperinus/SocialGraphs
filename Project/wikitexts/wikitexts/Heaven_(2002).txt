Co-screenwriter [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]] intended for it to be the first part of a trilogy (the second being ''[[Hell (2005 film)|Hell]]'' and the third titled ''[[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski#Legacy|Purgatory]]''), but Kie\u015blowski died before he could complete the project. The film is an [[international co-production]] among producers based in Germany, France, Italy, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The dialogue is in Italian and English.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in [[Turin]], Italy. It opens with a prologue sequence showing the young Italian [[Carabinieri]] clerk Filippo (Ribisi) learning to fly a [[helicopter]] using a [[flight simulator]]. When he accidentally crashes the virtual helicopter by ascending too dramatically, his instructor tells him, \"In a real helicopter, you can't just keep going up and up\", prompting Filippo to ask, \"How high can I fly?\"\n\nThe film then cuts to Philippa (Blanchett), who is preparing to plant a bomb in the downtown office of a high-ranking businessman. Although everything goes according to her plan, the garbage bin in which she places the bomb is emptied by a cleaner immediately after she leaves and later explodes in an elevator, killing four people.\n\nPhilippa is tracked down by the Carabinieri, arrested, and brought to the station where Filippo works. When she is questioned, she reveals that she is an English teacher at a local school where several students have recently died of drug-related causes. Discovering that they had all been supplied by the same local cartel, she had contacted the Carabinieri with the names of the drug ring leaders, begging them to intervene, but was repeatedly ignored.\n\nAt her wits' end, she decided to kill the leader of the cartel, the businessman whose office she targeted. In the process of her interrogation, Filippo (who is translating her confession for his superiors) falls in love with Philippa and helps her escape from Carabinieri custody. After she kills the drug lord who was her original target, the pair become fugitives from the law and flee to the countryside, where they eventually find refuge with one of Philippa's friends and finally consummate their relationship.\n\nWhen the authorities raid the house where they are hiding, the fugitives steal a Carabinieri helicopter parked on the front lawn and escape by air. The officers on the ground fire repeatedly at them, to no avail, as the craft climbs higher and higher and finally disappears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] - Philippa\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] - Filippo\n* [[Remo Girone]] - The Father\n* [[Stefania Rocca]] - Regina\n* [[Alessandro Sperduti]] - Ariel\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Heaven'' received generally positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has {{a or an|{{RT data|score}}}} approval rating, based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The story is the weakest link in this gorgeous and well-acted film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/heaven|title=Heaven|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access date|df=dmy}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/heaven|title=Heaven Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThough comparisons abound to Kie\u015blowski's earlier films, [[Roger Ebert]] also saw a similarity to Tykwer's ''[[Run Lola Run]]'' and ''[[The Princess and the Warrior]]''. Though ''Heaven'' is \"more thoughtful, proceeds more deliberately, than the mercurial haste\" of Tykwer's films, \"it contains the same sort of defiant romanticism, in which a courageous woman tries to alter her fate by sheer willpower.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180305/1023|title=Heaven|author=Roger Ebert|date=18 October 2002|website=RogerEbert.com|access-date=2 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0246677|Heaven}}\n\n{{Tom Tykwer}}\n{{Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski}}\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:English-language Italian films]]\n[[Category:2002 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:2002 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:2002 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic thriller films]]\n[[Category:2002 thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic thriller films]]\n[[Category:American thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:British crime drama films]]\n[[Category:British crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:British romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:British thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism in Europe]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tom Tykwer]]\n[[Category:Films set in Turin]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Germany]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Tuscany]]\n[[Category:French crime drama films]]\n[[Category:French crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:French romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:German crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:German thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:German romantic thriller films]]\n[[Category:Italian romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Italian crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Italian thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Krzysztof Piesiewicz]]\n[[Category:2002 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:American multilingual films]]\n[[Category:British multilingual films]]\n[[Category:French multilingual films]]\n[[Category:German multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Italian multilingual films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
