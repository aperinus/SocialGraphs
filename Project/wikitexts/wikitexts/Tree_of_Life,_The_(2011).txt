In 2010, eldest son Jack is adrift in his modern life as a [[Texan]] architect, disillusioned by his youth. Amid all this, voiceovers from Mrs. O'Brien ask God why R.L. had to die. Then, visuals depict the [[Big Bang|birth of the universe]], followed by the [[History of Earth|creation]] of [[Earth]] and the [[beginning of life]]. At one point, a dinosaur chooses not to kill another dinosaur that is injured and lying on the side of a river bed. Finally, [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|an asteroid strikes the Earth]].\n\nIn a suburban neighborhood in [[Waco, Texas]] in the 1950s,<ref name=\":10\" /> the O'Briens are enthralled by their new baby Jack and, later his two brothers, R.L. and Stevie. When Jack reaches adolescence, he is conflicted with accepting the way of [[Divine grace|grace]] or nature, as embodied by his parents. Mrs. O'Brien, the embodiment of grace, presents the world to her sons as a place of wonder. Mr. O'Brien, the embodiment of nature, easily loses his temper as he struggles to reconcile his love for his sons, wanting to prepare them for a world he sees as corrupt and exploitative. He laments his decision to work in a power plant instead of pursuing his passion for music, and tries to get ahead by filing patents for various inventions.\n\nJack's perceptions of the world begin to change after one of his friends, Taylor, drowns. He questions how God could allow such things to happen, and that if God is malicious, he can be too. He becomes angry at his father's continuous hypocrisies and misdeeds, lashing out at his mother for tolerating him. When Mr. O'Brien goes on a business trip, the boys enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Peer-pressured, Jack commits [[vandalism]] and [[animal abuse]]. When trespassing into his crush's house, he steals her sheer nightgown; he then fearfully throws it into a river. Shortly after Mr. O'Brien returns, the plant that he works at closes; he is given the option of relocating to work in an inferior position within the firm or losing his job. As the family packs up to move to the new job, he laments his path of life, asking Jack to forgive his domineering behavior; Jack reflectively says he embodies nature.\n\nAs adult Jack leaves work, he rides the elevator up, envisioning following a young girl across rocky terrain. As he walks through a wooden door frame erected on the rocks, he sees a view of the far distant future in which the [[Sun]] expands into a [[red giant]], engulfing Earth and then shrinking into a [[white dwarf]]. After emerging from rustic doors, Jack follows the girl, then a young version of himself, across surreal landscapes. The dead return to life and gather at the seaside, where Jack is reunited with his family and all those who populate his memory. Jack meets his brothers and brings R.L. to his parents, who bids goodbye as he steps out of a home into a vast expanse. Accompanied by two girls in white, Mrs. O'Brien gracefully whispers, \"[[Surrender (religion)|I give him to you]]. I give you my son.\"\n\nJack's vision ends and he leaves the building, smiling and feeling tranquil. The film ends as the mysterious light continues to flicker in the darkness.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Mr. O'Brien\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Mrs. O'Brien\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Jack O'Brien\n** Hunter McCracken as young Jack\n** Finnegan Williams as Jack (age 5)\n** Michael Koeth as Jack (age 2)\n* Laramie Eppler as R.L.

In creating the alternate version, the original negatives' palettes were located for Malick to use, the entire film scanned in [[4K resolution]], cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki brought in to help grade the footage, and a full sound mix created for the additional material, with Malick even dedicating \"the better part of a year\" to this project. Becker stated that the company has \"never undertaken anything this extensive or this challenging, or anything that has taken this long to achieve or required so much effort on the part of pretty much every post-production craft.
