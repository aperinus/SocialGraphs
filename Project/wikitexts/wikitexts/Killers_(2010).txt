The film centers on a young woman (Heigl) who meets the man of her dreams (Kutcher) who turns out to be an assassin. The film was theatrically released on June 4, 2010. It received negative reviews from critics and grossed $98 million worldwide against its $75 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nJen Kornfeldt travels to [[Nice]], [[France]], with her parents after a break-up. She meets Spencer Aimes, and agrees to join him later for drinks. He sneaks aboard a boat, planting a bomb on a helicopter, then arrives for his date with Jen. When the helicopter takes off, Spencer triggers the bomb. After a night of drinking, Spencer, unaware Jen has fallen asleep, reveals he is a professional [[assassin]]. Despite the advice of his boss, Holbrook, Spencer quits contract killing and begins a relationship with Jen, eventually asking her father, Mr. Kornfeldt for his blessing to marry her.\n\nThree years later, Spencer and Jen have settled into married life. When she surprises him with tickets to Nice for his birthday, he is less than enthusiastic, which Jen's friends convince her is a sign he is bored with their relationship. Spencer receives a \"romantic\" postcard from Holbrook with an ultimatum to take another assignment. Trying to refuse the job over the phone, he hangs up suddenly when Jen's father arrives, prompting suspicion; he also notices the postcard. Mr. Kornfeldt brings Spencer to a surprise birthday party, where Spencer's distraction over the assignment strengthens Jen's doubts about his commitment, further fuelled in the morning when he rushes her off on her business trip.\n\nJen decides not to leave, and returns home to find Spencer fighting off his best friend Henry, secretly a fellow assassin who reveals that a $20 million bounty has been placed on Spencer and that anyone in his life could be an assassin.\n\nA sniper opens fire on the house, and Spencer and Jen flee. They lead Henry on a car chase through the neighborhood and ram his car onto [[rebar]], killing him. After they find Holbrook dead in his hotel room, Jen vomits and realizes she might be pregnant.\n\nAt Spencer's office, Jen takes a pregnancy test, and he is attacked by his secretary Vivian. But Spencer, with Jen's distraction, manages to kill her. Jen's test is positive, and despite Spencer's pleas, she drives off alone. Spencer is attacked by a delivery driver, who is run over and killed by one of Spencer's co-workers, Olivia. She tries to run him over, but Jen returns and rams Olivia's car into a fuel tank, which Spencer shoots. The car explodes, killing Olivia in the process.\n\nSpencer and Jen discuss their future together and return home, evading a couple next door, Mac and Lily{{snd}}, also assassins. Making their way through the neighbourhood [[block party]], they enter the house to retrieve Spencer's [[bug-out bag]]. Spencer subdues the neighbours, while Jen's best friend Kristen, another assassin, holds Jen's mother hostage in a [[Mexican standoff]] with Jen.\n\nJen's father arrives and kills Kristen; in a standoff with Spencer, he reveals that he ordered the hit. Aware of Spencer's career all along, Mr. Kornfeldt explains that he was a former operative himself, and had been Spencer's target in Nice; he embedded the assassins in Spencer and Jen's lives. The postcard from Holbrook led Mr. Kornfeldt to believe that Spencer had resumed his old job, so he [[Sleeper agent|activated]] the assassins.\n\nTo prove he has truly left his old job behind, Spencer drops his gun, assuring Mr. Kornfeldt he has no intention of killing him. Jen, now convinced, reveals her pregnancy to her parents. And her father, after killing one last assassin, drops his gun as well, and the family makes peace by building a trust circle.\n\nMonths later, Spencer \u2013 growing a moustache to emulate Mr. Kornfeldt \u2013 and Jen leave her parents to babysit their child, guarded by lasers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Spencer \n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as Jen\n* [[Tom Selleck]] as Mr. Kornfeldt\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Mrs. Kornfeldt\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as Vivian\n* [[Kevin Sussman]] as Mac Bailey\n* [[Lisa Ann Walter]] as Olivia Brooks\n* [[Casey Wilson]] as Kristen\n* [[Rob Riggle]] as Henry\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Holbrook\n* [[Alex Borstein]] as Lily Bailey\n\nIn addition, [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] (credited with his full name, Usher Raymond IV) has a cameo as Kevin, the K Mart manager, while [[Mary Birdsong]] briefly appears as Jackie, Jen and Spencer's obnoxious next door neighbor.\n\n==Production ==\nOriginally announced in September 2007 under the title ''Five Killers'', the film was written by Bob DeRosa as an action thriller to be directed by [[Mark Helfrich (film editor)|Mark Helfrich]].<ref name=\"HelfrichFiveKillers\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/features/mark-helfrich-to-direct-five-killers-1117971528/ |title=Mark Helfrich to direct 'Five Killers' |publisher=Variety |access-date=September 20, 2021 }}</ref> Ashton Kutcher was cast in the lead in October 2008, with [[Robert Luketic]] directing instead of Helfrich and reformatted as an action-comedy rather than an action thriller in a rewrite by [[Ted Griffin]].<ref name=\"KutcherFiveKillers\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2008/film/features/ashton-kutcher-set-for-five-killers-1117994431/ |title=Ashton Kutcher set for 'Five Killers' |publisher=Variety |access-date=September 20, 2021 }}</ref> Katherine Heigl joined the cast in February 2009 playing opposite Kutcher.<ref name=\"HeiglKillers\">{{cite magazine\n| date=2009-02-18\n| last=Siegel\n| first=Tatiana\n| title=Heigl, Kutcher to star in 'Killers'\n| url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000302 \n| magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\n| access-date=January 9, 2010\n}}</ref> Filming began in the fall of 2009 and took place in the [[Tributary, Georgia|Tributary community]] in [[Douglasville, Georgia]], Nassau and [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] doubling for Nice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\n==Home media==\nThe [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] of the film was released on September 7, 2010.<ref name=\"numbers\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Killers#tab=summary|title=Killers (2010) - Financial Information}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 10% based on 111 reviews, and an average rating of 3.30/10.
