It stars [[Peter Dinklage]] as a man who seeks solitude in an abandoned [[train station]] in the [[Newfoundland, New Jersey|Newfoundland]] section of [[Jefferson Township, New Jersey]]. It also stars [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], [[Bobby Cannavale]] and [[John Slattery]]. For his writing achievement, McCarthy won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay]], the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay]] and the [[Waldo Salt|Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award]] while the film itself also won the [[John Cassavetes Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nFinbar McBride, a quiet, withdrawn man with [[dwarfism]], is a nihilist who has a deep love of [[railroad]]s. He works in a [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] [[Rail transport modelling|model train hobby]] shop owned by his elderly and similarly taciturn friend Henry Styles. Because he feels ostracized by a public that tends to view him as peculiar due to his size, Fin keeps to himself.\n\nWhen Henry dies unexpectedly, Fin is told that the hobby shop is to be closed. However, he also learns that Henry has bequeathed him a piece of rural property with an abandoned train depot on it. He moves into the old building hoping for a life of solitude, but he quickly finds himself reluctantly becoming enmeshed in the lives of his neighbors. Joe Oramas, a [[Cuban American]], is operating his father's roadside snack truck while the elder man recovers from an illness, and Olivia Harris is an artist trying to cope with the sudden death of her young son two years earlier and the ramifications it has had on her marriage to David, from whom she is separated; Olivia's initial and secondary meetings with Fin almost get him killed when she is distracted while driving her car. Cleo is a young girl who shares Fin's interest in trains and wants him to lecture her class about them. Emily is the local librarian, a young woman dismayed to discover she is pregnant by her [[ne'er-do-well]] boyfriend.\n\n[[File:Train Station at Newfoundland, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The train station used in the movie]]\nJoe, relentlessly upbeat and overly talkative, soon cracks through Fin's reserve. The two begin to take daily walks along the tracks, and after Olivia gives Fin a movie camera, Joe drives alongside a passing train so that Fin can film it. Joe and Fin sleepover at Olivia's house after watching the footage and the next morning a flustered, unannounced David is greeted by the two of them. The three forge a tentative friendship that is threatened when Olivia descends into a deep depression, disappearing from the town. Meanwhile, Emily seeks solace in Fin, who slowly is realizing interaction with other humans may not be as unpleasant as he thought. Fin tries to protect Emily from her boyfriend at a bar, but he pushes Fin aside, causing Fin to lapse back into his asocial behaviour. Emily later comes to apologize, and after she and Fin share a kiss, she spends the night with Fin after asking if she can \"just sleep\" there. Cleo asks Fin if Olivia is coming back, to which he replies that he doesn't know. He decides to keep an eye on Olivia's house, but when he spots her fighting on the phone with David and he goes up on the porch, Olivia angrily tells him to leave. Fin spends the night drinking and, collapsing on the track, is passed over by a train, undamaged but for his pocket watch. As if feeling blessed by his gift of life (and symbolically upon his watch getting destroyed in the train mishap), Fin walks up to Olivia's home only to find she has attempted suicide. Olivia reveals that David is having another baby with a different woman. Fin takes care of Olivia's home while she recuperates in the hospital. Fin picks up the courage to talk to school kids about trains.\n\nOlivia, Joe, and Fin share a meal at Olivia's house, their conversation filled with some small talk and reconciliation. Olivia and Joe tease Fin about Emily, suggesting he go seek her again.\n\n==Production==\n''The Station Agent'' was shot on [[16 mm film]] in 20 days with a budget of half a million dollars.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tom McCarthy's The Station Agent - Filmmaker Magazine - Fall 2003 |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/fall2003/features/great_railway.php |access-date=2022-03-17 |website=filmmakermagazine.com}}</ref>\n\nAccording to writer-director [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]]'s commentary on the DVD release of the film, it was shot on a shoestring budget in a limited amount of time.

It is a great relief . . . that ''The Station Agent'' is not one of those movies in which the problem is that the characters have not slept with each other and the solution is that they do.

Yet there\u2019s something deeply affecting about his stoicism and suspicion that has nothing to do with artificial sweeteners, [[Walt Disney|Disney]] sentiment, or party political broadcasts on behalf of dwarfs. Dinklage just gets on with his performance like an actor who can't understand why he's got the lead role. It's this tension between the film and the unwilling Romeo that makes ''The Station Agent'' such a hypnotic watch.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Christopher |first=James |date=March 25, 2004 |title=The Station Agent |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article1051115.ece |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616114000/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article1051115.ece |archive-date=June 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay]]\n| Tom McCarthy\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress]]\n| Patricia Clarkson\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2003|Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Performer]]\n| Peter Dinklage\n| {{Nom}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Florida Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress]]\n| Patricia Clarkson\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay]]\n|\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award]]\n|\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Male]]\n| Peter Dinklage\n| {{Nom}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards 2003|Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress\n| Patricia Clarkson\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for Best Screenplay\n|\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[National Board of Review Awards 2003|National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress]]\n| Patricia Clarkson\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[National Society of Film Critics Awards 2003|National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress]]\n| Patricia Clarkson\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Satellite Award for Best Original Screenplay]]\n|\n| {{Nom}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]\n|\n| {{Nom}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role]]\n| Peter Dinklage\n| {{Nom}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]]\n| Patricia Clarkson\n| {{Nom}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[List of Sundance Film Festival award winners|Sundance Film Festival Audience Award (Dramatic)]]\n|\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize]]\n| Patricia Clarkson\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Sundance Film Festival [[Waldo Salt]] Screenwriting Award\n|\n| {{Won}}\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]]\n|\n| {{Nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.miramax.com/movie/the-station-agent}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0340377|title=The Station Agent}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=station_agent|title=The Station Agent}}\n* [http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=bigelow+road+Newfoundland,+New+Jersey,+USA&sll=41.04812,-74.444137&sspn=0.004572,0.009645&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Bigelow+Rd,+Oak+Ridge,+Morris,+New+Jersey+07438,+United+States&ll=41.04812,-74.444137&spn=0.000567,0.001206&t=h&z=20&layer=c&cbll=41.04812,-74.444137&cbp=12,0,,0,5&photoid=po-15350021 Location of Fin's train station (Google Street View)] [http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/41.04847/-74.44441 (Open Street Map)]\n\n{{Thomas McCarthy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Station Agent, The}}\n[[Category:2003 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Films about people with dwarfism]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tom McCarthy]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stephen Trask]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in 16 mm film]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay BAFTA Award]]\n[[Category:John Cassavetes Award winners]]\n[[Category:Sundance Film Festival award winners]]\n[[Category:Rail transport films]]\n[[Category:Rockaway Township, New Jersey]]"}]}}}}
