It was filmed in [[Chicago]] and was released on April 7, 2000 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It was [[Carroll O'Connor]]'s final film before his death the following year.\n\n== Plot ==\nBob and Elizabeth Rueland ([[David Duchovny]] and [[Joely Richardson]]) live and work in Chicago \u2014 Bob as an architect, Elizabeth as a zoologist at [[Lincoln Park Zoo]].\n\nOn the night of her fundraiser for a new primate house, Bob promises Elizabeth he'll finish the building. Elizabeth is killed in a car accident leaving the fundraiser, and her [[heart transplant|heart is transplanted]] to artist Grace Briggs ([[Minnie Driver]]), who has suffered from heart disease since the age of 14 and is near death.\n\nThe surgery is successful; Grace is able to live a normal life for the first time and plans to make her first airplane trip to Italy to paint. Grace's best friend Megan Dayton ([[Bonnie Hunt]]), encourages her to start dating in spite of her self-consciousness about the long surgical scar on her chest.\n\nGrace writes a letter to the donor's family after the surgery, thanking them for the heart she received; it takes her over a year to finally find the courage to mail the letter. Bob works to build the primate house Elizabeth raised money for; he is still depressed a year after her death. He recognizes that he must resume his life as he becomes frustrated seeing that his dog hasn't gotten over the loss either.\n\nBob's friend, veterinarian Charlie ([[David Alan Grier]]), organizes a blind date for him at O'Reilly's, a self-styled Irish-Italian restaurant. The date goes very badly, as his date is very obnoxious, petty and self-absorbed. However, Bob finds that he is drawn to the waitress \u2014 Grace, who is also the granddaughter of the restaurant's owner, Marty O'Reilly ([[Carroll O'Connor]]).\n\nAlthough they are both unaware of the connection they have through Elizabeth's heart, Bob and Grace begin to date. As they grow closer together, she is reluctant to tell him about her medical history. After several months of dating, Grace finally decides to tell Bob about her transplant. However, before she gets the chance, she finds in his house the letter she had sent several months earlier.\n\nHorrified by the discovery, Grace flees and tells Megan what has happened. Megan's husband, Joe, ([[Jim Belushi]]) becomes infuriated as he has misunderstood Grace's panic and thinks Bob must be married. Megan then explains the situation to him in six monosyllables: \"Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart!\" When Grace meets Bob again, she tells him the truth. Speechless, he leaves.\n\nAgainst Megan's advice to not run away from the situation, Grace goes to Italy alone. Back at home, Bob realizes that although he will always miss Elizabeth, he \"aches\" for Grace. He decides to go after her, and they reunite in Italy. They return to Chicago for the dedication of the new primate house.\n\nAs the film ends we see Wally ([[William Bronder]]) and Sophie ([[Marianne Muellerleile]]) dancing happily at their wedding reception at O'Reilly's restaurant, and Charlie holding Joe and a visibly pregnant Megan's toddler, while they join Grace and Bob on the dance floor.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[David Duchovny]] as Bob Rueland\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as Grace Briggs\n* [[Carroll O'Connor]] as Marty O'Reilly\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Angelo Pardipillo\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Megan Dayton\n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Charlie Johnson\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Elizabeth Rueland\n* [[Eddie Jones (actor)|Eddie Jones]] as Emmett McFadden\n* [[Jim Belushi|James Belushi]] as Joe Dayton\n* [[William Bronder]] as Wally Jatczak\n* [[Marianne Muellerleile]] as Sophie\n* [[Dick Cusack]] as Mr. Bennington\n* [[Joseph Gian]] as Singer\n* [[Tom Virtue]] as Dr. Sederak\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Tony\n* [[Don Lake]] as Transplant Man\n* [[American Bulldog|Peetey]] as Mel\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received generally mixed reviews.
