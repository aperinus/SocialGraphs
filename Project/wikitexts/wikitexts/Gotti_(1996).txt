The film stars [[Armand Assante]] in the title role as infamous [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[John Gotti]], along with [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]], and [[Anthony Quinn]]. It aired on [[HBO]] on August 17, 1996. Assante won an [[Emmy Award]] for ''Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Special'' for his performance. Assante also received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination the same year.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts In 1973 in New York, and ends in 1992, with Gotti's imprisonment. Gotti's association with three mobsters is also highlighted in the film: a father-son like relationship with family [[underboss]] [[Aniello Dellacroce|Aniello \"Mr. Neil\" Dellacroce]], his deep but rocky friendship with Gotti crew member and longtime friend [[Angelo Ruggiero]], and the respect and ultimate frustration that he felt for the man who became his underboss, [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]]. The film details Gotti's rise within the Gambino crime family and his ranks from soldier, then captain (or ''[[caporegime|capo]]''), and finally, [[crime boss|boss]]. The final title was achieved through the dramatic murder in public of Gambino family boss [[Paul Castellano]] in 1985. Following the murder of Castellano, the film concentrates on the legal trials of John Gotti: one for assault and two for [[racketeering]] under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations]] (RICO) statutes. Gotti's famous personality, trial acquittals, and media attention are all dramatized. The film ends with Gotti's conviction and sentencing to [[life imprisonment]] at [[Marion Federal Penitentiary]] in [[Marion, Illinois]], because Gravano turns state's evidence and agrees to testify against Gotti.  The film is primarily based on the columns of reporter [[Jerry Capeci]], who also wrote the novel that documented Gotti's rise and fall inside the Gambino crime family, and served as [[executive producer]] of the film which was based on his novel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Armand Assante]] as [[John Gotti]]\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as [[Sammy Gravano]]\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Aniello Dellacroce]]\n* [[Vincent Pastore]] as [[Angelo Ruggiero]]\n* [[Frank Vincent]] as [[Robert DiBernardo]]\n* [[Richard C.
