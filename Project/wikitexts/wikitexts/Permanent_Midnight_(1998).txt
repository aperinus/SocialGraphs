It stars [[Ben Stiller]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Elizabeth Hurley]], [[Owen Wilson]], [[Cheryl Ladd]] and [[Janeane Garofalo]]. Based on [[Jerry Stahl]]'s autobiographical book of the same name, it depicts Stahl, a successful [[Screenwriter|TV writer]] for popular series like ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|thirtysomething]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', and ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', and his struggles with [[substance abuse]].\n\n''Permanent Midnight'' grossed only $1.1 million in [[limited theatrical release]] in the United States, but performed better in the [[home video]] market.<ref name=\"Video Business\">{{cite magazine |title=Jeff Fink: the arthouse customer is not some special breed|magazine=Video Business |date=August 30, 1999  |volume=19 |number=35 |page=18 |url=https://www.proquest.com/trade-journals/jeff-fink-arthouse-customer-is-not-some-special/docview/223917200/se-2|quote=Based on the feedback we've gotten from dealers, we know titles like...Permanent Midnight deliver solid return on investment}}</ref> Stiller's performance was critically acclaimed. A [[Girls Town (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film was released on September 15, 1998 from [[DGC Records]].\n\n==Plot==\nApproaching the end of a [[drug rehabilitation]] program, [[Jerry Stahl]] quits his job at a fast food restaurant on an impulse when an attractive woman named Kitty pulls up at the drive-through window. The two check into a motel, where Jerry tells her about his life between bouts of sex. A series of flashbacks, intercut with their conversations, details his working life to this point.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles from New York City, Jerry, who is already addicted to various prescription medications, becomes friends with fellow addict Nicky. At the urging of Nicky and his girlfriend Vola, Jerry marries Vola's friend Sandra so she can get her [[permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. Sandra uses her position at a television studio to get Jerry onto the writing staff of the popular comedy series ''Mr. Chompers''.  He uses memories from his childhood, including his mother's hysterical grief over his father's death, to fuel his writing.\n\nHe juggles his ''Mr. Chompers'' job and regular visits to a heroin dealer, Dita. However, his drug use eventually gets him fired. Sandra finds him a new job with a different series, ''No Such Luck'', whose star Pamela Verlaine\u2013herself a recovering addict\u2013sternly but sympathetically insists that he kick his habit first.\n\nAs soon as Jerry starts on a [[methadone]] program, he runs across a dealer named Gus, who introduces him to [[crack cocaine]] and later [[Dilaudid]]. His increased drug use costs him his new job, and Sandra throws him out, disgusted at his decision to shoot up when she tells him she is pregnant. Her opinion of him falls even further when he shows up high for the birth of his daughter Nina.\n\nWhile looking after Nina one night, he gets high and is arrested by the police. The incident further strains his relationship with Sandra, who makes it clear that she would prefer to see as little of him as possible.\n\nThe flashbacks end at this point, with Jerry returning to Los Angeles in hopes of being part of Nina's life.  As he begins to resurrect his stalled writing career, he gets a surprise visit from Kitty. The two have one last sexual encounter before she leaves to move to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].\n\nIn the final scene, Jerry appears on a series of talk shows and news programs, while commenting in voice-over about the damage that his addiction has done to his life. \"I got out with a bad liver and enough debt to keep me in hock 'til I'm 90, if I'm still here. And with my luck, I will be.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Ben Stiller]] as [[Jerry Stahl]]\n*[[Maria Bello]] as Kitty\n*[[Elizabeth Hurley]] as Sandra Stahl\n*[[Owen Wilson]] as Nicky\n*[[Lourdes Benedicto]] as Vola\n*[[Janeane Garofalo]] as Jana Farmer\n*[[Fred Willard]] as Craig Ziffer\n*[[Connie Nielsen]] as Dagmar\n*[[Liz Torres]] as Dita\n*[[Peter Greene]] as Gus\n*[[Cheryl Ladd]] as Pamela Verlaine\n*[[Sandra Oh]] as friend\n*[[Jerry Stahl]] as Dr. Murphy\n*[[Andy Dick]] as \"Damian\", a talk show guest (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/permanent-midnight/cast/2030435283/ |title=Permanent Midnight - Full Cast & Crew |website=TVGuide.com |access-date=2022-07-24}}</ref>\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[David Duchovny]] was originally cast as Stahl, but left the project to do ''[[Playing God (1997 film)|Playing God]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=August 21, 1998 |title='Permanent Midnight' |url=https://ew.com/article/1998/08/21/permanent-midnight-3/ |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |language=en}}</ref> It took nine months to secure financing for the film;<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Anthony |first=Todd |date=1998-09-28 |title=From Hero to Heroin |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1998-09-28-9809240202-story.html |url-status=dead |access-date=2022-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210628132338/https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1998-09-28-9809240202-story.html |archive-date=2021-06-28}}</ref> it was eventually produced and distributed by [[Artisan Entertainment]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hoffman |first=Andy |date=September 11, 1998 |title=Artisan Entertainment seeking TIFF gems |url=https://playbackonline.ca/1998/09/11/23212-19980911/ |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=playbackonline.ca}}</ref>\n\nTo perfect the role of a heroin addict, Ben Stiller worked closely with Stahl himself and learned about heroin use.

Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"As Stahl, Stiller turns in what could easily be the finest performance of a career that, up to now, was devoted mostly to playing an interesting but lightweight assortment of dweebs...this arresting performance, which lurches from buzzing mania to nodding stupor, from glib lies to tongue-tied inarticulateness, is a breakthrough for the talented actor.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=O'Sullivan |first=Michael |date=September 18, 1998 |title=An Addict's Life, Pithy and Pitiful |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/reviews/permanentmidnightosullivan.htm?movieslede=y |access-date=September 23, 2022}}</ref> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' added, \"Though '''Permanent Midnight''<nowiki/>' can\u2019t be classified as fun, Stiller\u2019s comic energy and timing are essential in providing the film with the numerous bleak laughs that become its trademark.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Turan |first=Kenneth |date=September 18, 1998 |title=Dark Humor Lifts \u2018Midnight\u2019s\u2019 Tired Subject |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-sep-18-ca-23831-story.html |access-date=September 23, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn a three-star review, [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, \"The movie gets credit for not making the high life seem colorful or funny. It is not. It is boring, because when the drugs are there they simply clear the pain and allow the mind to focus on getting more drugs. Stahl doesn't seek drugs because he wants to feel good but because he wants to stop feeling bad. It isn't the high that makes people into addicts; it's the withdrawal.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]''\n*''[[Prozac Nation (film)|Prozac Nation]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0120788|title=Permanent Midnight}}\n* {{amg title|id=173447|title=Permanent Midnight}}\n* {{Mojo title|permanentmidnight|Permanent Midnight}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1998 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American biographical films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Artisan Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about heroin addiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Daniel Licht]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Don Murphy]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1998 independent films]]\n[[Category:Films about screenwriters]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films about Hollywood, Los Angeles]]"}]}}}}
