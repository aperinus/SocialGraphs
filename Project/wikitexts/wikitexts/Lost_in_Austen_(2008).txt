Amanda, a woman from modern London, enters the plot of the novel through a portal in her bathroom, to join the Bennet family and affect events disastrously.\n\nIn December 2009 the show was placed at 48 in \"The Top 50 TV Shows of the Noughties\", a list published in ''[[The Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-top-50-tv-shows-of-the-noughties-0w05lb7p3qk | work=The Times | location=London | title=The top 50 TV shows of the Noughties | date=2009-12-19 | access-date=2021-11-13 | first1=Andrew | last1=Billen | first2=David | last2=Chater | archive-date=13 July 2012 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713084149/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6955835.ece | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Episode 1 ===\nAmanda Price, a keen Jane Austen fan from present-day [[Hammersmith]], who has just rejected an unromantic marriage proposal from her boozy, unfaithful boyfriend,  discovers [[Elizabeth Bennet]], a character from ''Pride and Prejudice'', in a nightgown in her bathroom; but when Elizabeth disappears, she brushes the incident off as a dream. Amanda explains to her mother that Jane Austen's novel has shown her that she can set higher standards for a husband for herself and has taught her to believe in true love. Elizabeth appears in Amanda's bathroom again, this time dressed for travel.\n\nAmanda steps through the secret doorway in the wall that Elizabeth has shown her, and finds herself at Longbourn, the house of the Bennet family, near the beginning of the novel. Amanda is trapped in this world while Elizabeth is in 21st-century [[London]]. Mr Bennet is hospitable, accepting Amanda as his daughter's good friend, while Elizabeth visits \"the city\".\n\nAmanda tries to ensure that the novel progresses as it should, but when Mr Bingley visits Longbourn, he admires Amanda more than Jane. At the Meryton Assembly Hall, Amanda tries to reject Bingley's interest by telling him that she cannot dance with him, because Mr Darcy has already asked her to. Bingley calls Amanda's bluff, but Darcy lies and confirms Amanda's claim. As Darcy dances with her, Amanda asks why he covered for her, for which he scolds her, believing her to have tried to make a fool out of Bingley, and agreed to dance through wanting to spare him from embarrassment. Amanda gets drunk and kisses Bingley, immediately regretting it.\n\nA furious Mrs Bennet warns Amanda not to interfere with her daughters' marriage prospects. Later, Amanda  forces Jane to travel to the Bingleys' home in bad weather, in order to get the novel back on track. But when she learns that this may give Jane a fatal attack of [[influenza]], Amanda follows her to try and save her.\n\n=== Episode 2 ===\nWhile nursing a sick Jane with [[paracetamol]] at Netherfield Park, Amanda finally puts a stop to Bingley's advances to her. Claiming to be a [[lesbian]], she is able to direct his amorous attentions back to Jane. Darcy, however, argues with Amanda about her bringing Jane to Netherfield Park, while Caroline Bingley takes a dislike to Amanda, and continually tries to embarrass her. She insists that Amanda play the piano for them, but upon her revelation that she cannot play, Amanda instead sings [[Petula Clark]]'s song \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\", and receives great applause from Darcy and Bingley. Caroline snidely tells Amanda that she will never get the riches she's looking for, but she at least won't starve. Amanda, in retaliation, boasts of her income of 27,000 pounds a year, which is enormous by [[Georgian era|Georgian]] standards, and much larger than Darcy's.\n\nAs the Bennet ladies return to Longbourn, their carriage breaks down, but an army officer, Wickham, plays gallant rescuer. Amanda warns Wickham (who, in the novel, is set to run away with Lydia) that she knows what he is up to, and is watching him.\n\nRepulsive cousin Mr Collins, the heir presumptive to Longbourn under [[Fee tail|the entail]], visits Longbourn to gain a wife, much to the excitement of Mrs Bennet. When he starts a proposal to Jane, Amanda intervenes, offering Elizabeth's best friend and his fianc\u00e9e in the novel, Charlotte Lucas. Mr Collins, however, misunderstands, and proposes to Amanda. She accepts to save Jane.\n\nAmanda sends Bingley and Jane on a walk to push them together. When Bingley consents to host a ball, Amanda hopes that events have returned to coincide with the novel, but at the ball, Darcy convinces Bingley not to marry Jane, telling him that her family, influenced by Amanda, are only after his money. Bingley gives Jane the cold shoulder, and she flees in tears.\n\nA vengeful Wickham begins to discredit Amanda, spreading rumours that her vast income comes from her deceased father, a fishmonger. Mr Collins, on hearing of this, breaks off his engagement with Amanda, and she knees him in the groin.\n\nJane, believing that Bingley no longer loves her, accepts her mother's advice, and unhappily marries Mr Collins. A disgusted Mr Bennet angrily refuses to sleep in the same bed as his wife, believing that she has condemned Jane.\n\nAmanda questions Bingley, who reveals that he does love Jane, but Darcy's stronger will prevailed over his own. Amanda accuses Darcy of crushing his friend's chance for happiness. She now decides that he does not deserve Elizabeth. Darcy retorts that Amanda repulses him, and walks out.\n\n=== Episode 3 ===\nMrs Bennet finally ejects Amanda from Longbourn for trying to meddle with her daughters' marriage prospects. A sympathetic Mr Bennet gives Amanda some money, and tells her to reconcile with Jane. Mr Collins explains to his miserable new wife that he has not yet sought to consummate their marriage because of religious abstinence.\n\nWickham offers to help Amanda, and teaches her how to properly act in high society. He buys her a dress, shows her how to use a fan to hide her true emotions, and invents fictional French nobles for her to name-drop. Amanda realises that Wickham wants to set her up with Darcy so that he can pursue Caroline Bingley, who is believed to be Darcy's ideal social match.\n\nWickham encourages Amanda to visit Jane, and, though at first reluctant, Jane gratefully accepts Amanda's apology and offer to renew their friendship. Mr Collins refuses to allow Amanda to dinner at Rosings, the home of his patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, but Amanda claims to have a message from her fictional noble relations. Lady Catherine, not wanting to appear ignorant and unconnected, goes along with the ploy, pretending to know the relations, and allows Amanda to dine with them.\n\nLady Catherine is also the aunt of Mr Darcy, and Darcy, Bingley and Caroline are among her dinner guests. Darcy tries to put Amanda down, but she twistedly agrees with everything he says, wields her fan, and manages to fit in.\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs Bennet argues with Mr Bennet, and decides to see Jane, taking Lydia with her so that she can see a happy marriage. Mr Bennet claims that if she finds a happy marriage at Rosings, he will walk the drawing room naked.\n\nLady Catherine mentions that she wishes the rest of the Bennet girls to marry Mr Collins's brothers, who are less \"favoured\" than himself. Despite their disagreements over dinner, Darcy begins to soften towards Amanda when she returns a gold watch that a sad and drunken Bingley wagers at cards. Lady Catherine warns Amanda to stay away from Mr Darcy. Amanda insists that she does not want him, but Lady Catherine disagrees.\n\nAgitated, Darcy comes to see Amanda at the parsonage. He asks her why she sought him out at Rosings, and Amanda denies this, pointing out that ''he'' has come to see ''her''. A tormented Darcy, struggling to understand why he is drawn to Amanda, sweeps her up into his arms. A shocked Amanda asks him if he knows what he is doing, and he storms out. Jane witnesses their exchange. She states that Darcy is in love with Amanda, but Amanda insists that Elizabeth is the one for Darcy. Jane tries to convince her otherwise.\n\nLater, Darcy invites Amanda to [[Pemberley]]. Overhearing the invitation, Mrs Bennet eagerly accepts as well, and Darcy politely includes Lydia and Jane. At a shooting party, Jane tearfully pleads with the sinking Bingley to fulfil his moral duty to marry and be happy for them both. Mrs Bennet witnesses this, and finally understands what her husband was talking about.\n\nAmanda admits to herself that she loves Darcy, and decides to \"understudy\" while Elizabeth is away. She tells a weeping Mrs Bennet that she will marry Darcy in order to buy Longbourn for them, freeing them from the influence of Mr Collins.\n\nBingley then seeks out Wickham as a drinking companion, and Wickham eventually returns the unconscious Bingley to Pemberley. At Wickham's arrival, Darcy confines his young sister Georgiana, who has a history with Wickham, to her room. However, Georgiana confesses to Amanda that Wickham did not ravish her, as she reported to her brother. She was angry when Wickham rejected her advances and called her a child. Wickham maintains the falsehood to spare Georgiana's honour, being sure that Darcy would throw her out if he knew the truth. Amanda realises that Wickham is a good person, and that Austen's account of him was one-sided.\n\nDrunk and despairing, Bingley punches Darcy for leading him away from Jane. Caroline, seeing her opportunity, walks up to Darcy, and makes coded insinuations about Amanda.\n\nWhen Amanda finally confesses her love to Darcy, she inadvertently mentions her old boyfriend back in the present, confirming what Caroline had implied to Darcy \u2013 Amanda is not a virgin. Darcy, although still obviously in love, regrets that he cannot marry her because of his station in society.\n\nA distraught Amanda furiously rips up her copy of ''Pride and Prejudice'', and throws it out of a window. While she packs to leave, however, Caroline enters her room, and Amanda is stunned when Caroline makes advances, having heard from her brother that Amanda is a lesbian, like her. Caroline in fact only wishes to marry Darcy to fulfill social expectations.\n\nAmanda finds Darcy in the garden, reading the tattered remains of her copy of the novel. He assumes that she is its author, and expresses his shock that she has exposed private matters, and has not even concealed the real names of the characters. Amanda angrily tells him that his view of everything is wrong, that he has misjudged everyone, and announces her immediate departure.\n\n=== Episode 4 ===\nDarcy announces his expected engagement to Caroline, and Mrs Bennet receives a note telling of Lydia's elopement with, not Wickham, but Bingley. Mrs Bennet blames Amanda for this, while Amanda blames Darcy, and says that he and Caroline deserve each other.\n\nAmanda travels with Mr and Mrs Bennet in pursuit of Lydia and Bingley, and, with help from Wickham, they find them hiding at an inn. Darcy arrives too. Lydia and Bingley insist that nothing has happened between them, but an enraged Mr Bennet attacks Bingley with a sword. In self-defence, Bingley inflicts a serious head injury on the older man.\n\nAmanda fears for Mr Bennet's life. Needing Elizabeth, she breaks through a door, and suddenly finds herself back in modern London. Her boyfriend Michael drives her to see Elizabeth, now employed as a [[nanny]].\n\nOn a busy street, Amanda spots an astonished Darcy in the crowd. He explains that he has followed her for love, and will follow her anywhere. Amanda still wants him to meet Elizabeth, but Elizabeth has thoroughly embraced modern life, and is shocked to meet Darcy, having read the novel.\n\nAmanda hurries them back to her bathroom portal for their return to Longbourn, but the door will not open for Elizabeth, only for Amanda. Although Michael threatens to leave Amanda if she goes through the door, she goes anyway, so that Elizabeth can return to her time and marry Darcy.\n\nMr Bennet returns home to make a full recovery, thanks to Elizabeth's nursing. Lady Catherine, knowing Amanda's hold over Darcy, arrives at Longbourn and bargains for Amanda's departure by promising to have Jane's marriage to Mr Collins annulled on the grounds of non-consummation. Amanda agrees.\n\nCaroline is upset when she learns that her engagement to Darcy is over, but appears intrigued when Wickham shows his interest in her. Jane and Bingley plan to marry and leave for America, and Amanda persuades Elizabeth to learn to love Darcy. Darcy tells Amanda that he will mind his duty and marry Elizabeth.\n\nHowever, when Amanda opens the door to return home, she finds a note that Darcy has left for her: \"Not one heartbeat do I forget.\"\n\nAmanda decides to stay in the world of ''Pride and Prejudice'' and rushes to Pemberley to be with Darcy. Elizabeth gets her father's blessing to return to Hammersmith and modern times.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jemima Rooper]] as Amanda Price\n* [[Elliot Cowan]] as [[Fitzwilliam Darcy]]\n* [[Tom Mison]] as Mr Bingley\n* [[Alex Kingston]] as [[Bennet family#Mrs. Bennet|Mrs. Bennet]]\n* [[Hugh Bonneville]] as [[Mr. Bennet (Pride and Prejudice)|Mr. Claude Bennet]]\n* [[Morven Christie]] as [[Jane Bennet]]\n* [[Tom Riley (actor)|Tom Riley]] as [[George Wickham]]\n* [[Perdita Weeks]] as [[Lydia Bennet]]\n* [[Gemma Arterton]] as [[Elizabeth Bennet]]\n* [[Christina Cole]] as Caroline Bingley\n* [[Florence Hoath]] as [[Bennet family#Catherine \"Kitty\" Bennet|Catherine \"Kitty\" Bennet]]\n* [[Lindsay Duncan]] as [[Lady Catherine de Bourgh]]\n* [[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]] as [[Mr. William Collins]]\n* [[Michelle Duncan]] as Charlotte Lucas\n* [[Ruby Bentall]] as [[Bennet family#Mary Bennet|Mary Bennet]]\n* Paul Hine as Cymbal Collins\n* [[Pippa Haywood]] as Frankie, Amanda's mother.\n* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as Pirhana, Amanda's friend.\n* [[Daniel Percival]] as Michael Dolan, Amanda's boyfriend.\n* [[Genevieve Gaunt]] as Georgiana Darcy\n* Sarah Emmott as Elspeth, one of the Bennet household maids\n\n== Production ==\n''Lost in Austen'' was produced by [[Mammoth Screen]].
