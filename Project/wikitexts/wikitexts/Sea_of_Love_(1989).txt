The story concerns a [[New York City]] detective trying to catch a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper.<ref>{{cite news | last=Brown | first=Joe | title=Sea of Love | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/seaofloverbrown_a0adaf.htm | date=1989-11-15 | access-date=2010-11-26}}</ref>\n\nIt was Pacino's first film after a four-year hiatus following the critical and commercial failure of ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]''. ''Sea of Love'' was a box-office success, grossing over $110 million.\n\n==Plot==\nNew York City homicide detective Frank Keller is a burned-out alcoholic. His wife left him and married one of his colleagues, and he is depressed about reaching his 20th year on the police force. He is assigned to investigate the murder of a man in [[Manhattan]], shot dead while face down in his bed, naked, listening to an old [[45rpm]] recording of \"[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]].\" Keller has three clues \u2014 a lipstick-smeared cigarette, a want-ad that the dead man placed in a newspaper, and fingerprints of the perpetrator.\n\nA second man dies in the same manner in [[Queens]]. Detective Sherman Touhey from the local precinct suggests that he and Frank collaborate. Both victims had placed rhyming ads in the lonely hearts column of the newspaper, seeking dates. The detectives track down Raymond Brown, the only other man with a rhyming ad. He's a married man who admits placing the ad but swears that he threw away all the letters and never saw anyone.  Frank gets an idea to place a rhyming ad in the paper, meet women who respond in a restaurant and take the prints from their drinking glasses. Frank's precinct chief is skeptical, but changes his mind when Brown turns up dead in the same manner as the other two murder victims.\n\nFrank has dinner with several women, while Sherman \u2014 posing as a waiter \u2014 puts their glasses into evidence bags. One woman, divorcee Helen Cruger, shows no interest in Frank and leaves without taking a drink, so Frank is unable to get her fingerprints. Frank bumps into her again at a market, but this time she is more friendly. Helen manages a chic upscale shoe store. Frank does not reveal his true occupation.\n\nFrank takes her to his place, against his better judgment and a warning from Sherman not to do so. They start getting passionate, but Frank panics after finding a gun in her purse and treats her roughly. Helen explains she keeps the starting pistol because she's been scared. Frank apologizes, and they have sex.\n\nFrank and Helen begin a romance. He has a chance to obtain Helen's fingerprints on a glass but decides to wipe the glass clean. Their relationship becomes strained when she discovers that he is a cop. One night when he is drunk, he nearly gives away the fact that Helen was involved in a sting. He starts to confess his feelings for her, but then discovers that she responded to each of the victims' ads. When he confronts her, Helen refuses to admit to anything, so he throws her out.\n\nMoments later, the real killer bursts into the apartment: Helen's ex-husband Terry, who has been stalking Helen and murdering the men she dates. At gunpoint, he makes Frank lie on his bed and show how he made love to Helen, just as he had done to his other victims before murdering them. Frank manages to overpower Terry and tries to call the police, but Terry  lunges at him and, in the ensuing struggle, Frank throws Terry through the bedroom window to his death.\n\nSeveral weeks later, a newly sober Frank meets Sherman in a bar and later reunites with Helen. She forgives him, and they resume their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Detective Frank Keller\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Helen Cruger\n* [[John Goodman]] as Detective Sherman Touhey\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Terry Cruger\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Frank Keller Sr.\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Detective Gruber\n* [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as Precinct Chief\n* [[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]] as Raymond Brown\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]] as Serafino\n* Gene Canfield as Struk\n* Larry Joshua as Dargan\n* [[Christine Estabrook]] as Gina Gallagher\n* [[Barbara Baxley]] as Miss Allen\n* [[Patricia Barry]] as Older Woman\n* [[Luis Antonio Ramos]] as Omar Maldonado (as Luis Ramos)\n* Rafael B\u00e1ez as Efram Maldonado\n* [[Damien Leake]] as Ernest Lee\n* [[Jacqueline Brookes]] as Helen's Mother\n* [[Nancy Beatty]] as Raymond Brown's Wife\n* [[Hugh Thompson (Canadian actor)|Hugh Thompson]] as Young Cop\n* [[Christopher Maleki]] as Detective (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Lorraine Bracco]] filmed scenes as Keller's ex-wife Denice, which were cut from the theatrical release print, but were restored for television versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2008/10/15/sea-of-love-1989/|title=Sea of Love (1989)|website=thisdistractedglobe.com|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref> [[Samuel L.
