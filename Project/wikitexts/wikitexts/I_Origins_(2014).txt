At a Halloween party Gray encounters Sofi, a young woman masked with only hazel-speckled, ash-blue eyes visible. She later leads him into the washroom to have sex before abruptly leaving.\n\nMysterious [[synchronicity|synchronicities]], like the recurring number 11,  guide Gray to a billboard on which he recognizes Sofi's eyes. Eventually he sees her on a train. They begin a relationship although his rationalism clashes with her fey spirituality. One day they spontaneously agree to marry but must wait a day for a license. Disappointed, they walk out of the registry office. Ian gets a call from Karen. She has found a blind worm\u2014''[[Eisenia fetida]]''\u2014with the DNA necessary to develop an eye. Ian takes Sofi to the lab with him.\n\nKaren leaves while Sofi is upset by the research they are doing. Ian accidentally splashes his eyes with formaldehyde. They call Karen, who administers first aid. Sofi takes Ian home. On the way up, Sofi's lower half is chopped off in an elevator accident.\n\nThe film flashes forward seven years. Ian has written an eye evolution book and is now married to pregnant Karen. When their baby is born, the hospital takes an iris scan of baby Tobias' eyes. The results are entered in the database and the program identifies the baby as a certain Paul Edgar Dairy. The nurse re-enters the results, thinking it is a glitch, and the problem disappears. A few months later, a Dr. Simmons calls, recommending further testing the baby. The test involves seemingly random photographs. Ian and Karen become suspicious. He tracks some pictures from the test to Idaho and the family of Paul Edgar Dairy, who had died just before their baby was conceived.\n\nKenny is now creator of the iris scan database used to store Tobias' scan, and Kenny reveals that Dr. Simmons is in fact one of only five people with full access to the database. As a test, he helps Ian and Karen run some photos of deceased family members, plus various other people's eyes through the database to see if there are any other recent matches. They get a hit for Sofi, whose iris scan matches one made in India just three months prior, years after Sofi's death.\n\nIan goes to India to find the subject of this scan, an orphan girl named Salomina. With help from Priya Varma, he spends weeks searching and putting up billboards. Eventually he finds the little girl staring at the billboard. He takes Salomina back to his hotel and contacts Karen over Skype. The two of them conduct a simple test designed to reveal if Salomina might be somehow linked with Sofi's memories. The results match the probable range of random chance, with a 44% success score. Feeling somewhat disheartened,  Ian intends to take Salomina to Priya. But when they reach the elevator, the moment the doors open Salomina panics and throws herself into his arms, too frightened to enter. Staring into each other's eyes with a certain recognition, they then cling to each other, tears streaming down both their faces. He picks her up and takes her down the stairs instead, with Salomina tightly gripping his neck, till they walk from the dark interior and step out into the light.\n\nA [[post-credits scene]] shows Dr. Simmons scanning the irises of famous deceased figures finding many such matches.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Ian Gray\n* [[Brit Marling]] as Karen\n* [[\u00c0strid Berg\u00e8s-Frisbey]] as Sofi Elizondo\n* [[Steven Yeun]] as Kenny\n* [[Archie Panjabi]] as Priya Varma\n* [[Cara Seymour]] as Dr. Jane Simmons\n* [[Venida Evans]] as Margaret Dairy\n* [[William Mapother]] as Darryl Mackenzie\n* Kashish Kumari <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20171225-kumari-kashish-recipient-of-rashtrapati-award-for-acting-1107572-2017-12-15|title=DIY generation: Class Act}}</ref> as Salomina\n*[[Ako (actress)|Ako]] as Nurse\n\n== Production ==\n''I Origins'' was the second feature film by writer-director [[Mike Cahill (director)|Mike Cahill]] after his earlier independent science fiction-drama, ''[[Another Earth]]'' (2011), also with actress [[Brit Marling]].
