It is the second [[feature film]] installment of [[The X-Files (franchise)|''The X-Files'' franchise]] created by Carter, following the [[The X-Files (film)|1998 film]]. Three main actors from the television series, [[David Duchovny]], [[Gillian Anderson]], and [[Mitch Pileggi]], reappear in the film to reprise their respective roles as [[Fox Mulder]], [[Dana Scully]], and [[Walter Skinner]].\n\nUnlike the first film, the plot does not focus on the series' ongoing extraterrestrial-based [[Mythology of The X-Files|mytharc]] themes, but instead works as a standalone thriller [[horror fiction|horror]] story, like many of the monster-of-the-week episodes frequently seen in the TV series, as well as focusing on the personal relationship between Mulder and Scully. The story follows Mulder and Scully who have been out of the FBI for several years, with Mulder living in isolation and Scully having become a doctor at a Catholic hospital, where she has formed a bond with a critically ill child patient. When an FBI agent is mysteriously kidnapped and a former Catholic priest who has been convicted of pedophelia claims to be experiencing psychic visions of the endangered agent, Scully is asked to bring Mulder back to the bureau to consult on the case because of his work with psychics. The narrative goes through the push and pull of his at-first reluctant involvement and Scully's attempts to stay out of it.\n\nThe film was first anticipated in November 2001 to follow the conclusion of the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] of the television series, but it remained in [[development hell]] for six years before entering production in December 2007 in [[Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]]. The film premiered on July 23, 2008, at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood before opening theatrically two days later on July 25.  The worldwide gross was $68.4 million from a $30 million budget.  It received generally negative reviews; critics praised the chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson while criticizing the plot.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Dana Scully]], a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, is now a staff physician at a [[Catholic]] hospital; she is treating Christian, a young boy with symptoms similar to [[Sandhoff disease]]. FBI agent Mosely Drummy approaches Scully for help in locating her former partner, [[Fox Mulder]], who has been in hiding as a fugitive for several years. Drummy states that the FBI will call off its manhunt for Mulder if he helps investigate the disappearances of several women in West Virginia, the latest of whom is a young FBI agent named Monica Bannan. Scully agrees and convinces a reluctant Mulder to help.\n\nThe duo is taken to [[Washington, D.C.]], where Agent Dakota Whitney requests Mulder's expertise with the paranormal as they have been led to a clue, a severed human arm, by Father Joseph Fitzpatrick Crissman. He is a former priest defrocked for the molestation of thirty-seven altar boys, and claims God is sending him visions of the crimes. A second woman, driving home after swimming in a [[natatorium]], is run off the road by a truck driven by Janke Dacyshyn, who then abducts her. Father Joe is again recruited for help with the second abducted woman. After a grueling nighttime search in a snow-covered field, he leads the FBI to what turns out to be a frozen burial ground of people and body parts. Analysis of the remains, along with tracking down the recent movements from the second abducted woman's car crash, eventually leads them to Dacyshyn, an organ transporter in Richmond, Virginia, and his husband, Franz Tomczeszyn, who was among the youths Father Joe sexually abused.\n\nDuring an FBI raid on the organ donor facility where Dacyshyn works, he escapes, leaving Bannan's severed head at the scene. Mulder, who accompanied Whitney on the raid, chases Dacyshyn to a building construction site. Whitney follows and is killed when Dacyshyn pushes her down an elevator shaft. Scully, seeking a resolution, asks Joe, who has not yet heard of the discovery of Bannan's head, if he senses that she is still alive. He replies that she is. Discouraged but still determined, Mulder decides to investigate the incidents further. He drives Scully's car to Nutter's Feed Store in a small town near the abductions, as the human remains contain [[acepromazine]], an animal tranquilizer. When Dacyshyn coincidentally arrives moments later, Mulder slips out and follows him. Dacyshyn notices him, however, and runs his car off the road. Mulder survives and manages to tail Dacyshyn, who exits his truck after the engine fails, to a small compound in a former barn. Mulder enters, and the commotion caused by a two-headed guard dog brings Dacyshyn out from one of the buildings. The compound is being used by an Eastern European medical team that has been murdering people and stealing their organs for years. The field where Father Joe had earlier discovered the bodies turned out to be their dumping ground. Mulder enters the building to find that the team has been using the organs and body parts to keep Tomczeszyn alive. At that moment, they attempt to [[Head transplant|place Tomczeszyn's head]] on the body of the second abducted woman. Mulder tries to save her from the gruesome fate, but a doctor comes from behind and injects him with a tranquilizer. Helpless, Mulder is taken outside to be murdered by Dacyshyn.\n\nScully, unable to reach Mulder on his cell phone, contacts her old FBI superior, [[Walter Skinner]], for help. They trilaterate the phone's location and find Scully's wrecked car, eventually making their way through the snow to find the compound as Mulder is about to be axed by Dacyshyn. Scully attacks him in an ensuing confrontation, incapacitating him, while Skinner breaks up the medical procedure before the young woman is beheaded. Later, Mulder is at home when Scully tells him Father Joe has died. It happened at the same moment, Mulder notes, that Scully disconnected the life support to Tomczeszyn's severed head. Somehow, he surmises, the two men's fates were linked by more than just visions.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Mulder and Scully head across the sea towards a tropical island in a row boat, [[Breaking the fourth wall|waving to the camera above]].\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Amanda Peet September 2014 (cropped).jpg|150px|thumb|upright|right|Supporting actress [[Amanda Peet]] portrays FBI Agent Dakota Whitney]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[David Duchovny]] as [[Fox Mulder]]\n* [[Gillian Anderson]] as Dr. [[Dana Scully]]\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Special Agent in Charge Dakota Whitney\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as Joseph \"Father Joe\" Crissman\n* [[Xzibit]] as Special Agent Mosley Drummy\n* [[Mitch Pileggi]] as Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]]\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as Janke Dacyshyn\n* [[Adam Godley]] as Father Ybarra\n* Xantha Radley as Special Agent Monica Bannan\n* Fagin Woodcock as Franz Tomczeszyn\n* [[Nicki Aycox]] as Cheryl Cunningham\n* [[Alex Diakun]] as Gaunt Man\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn November 2001, the creators of the TV series ''The X-Files'' decided to pursue a second feature film adaptation of the series, following the 1998 film.

According to Duchovny, \"It all makes sense. You know, when Chris and I first talked about doing this movie, we kind of unconsciously both said, 'You know, I guess it should be in Vancouver, it really should be,' and it just felt like you know, almost superstitiously like the right thing to do.\"  Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on ''The X-Files'', as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that [[Ten Thirteen Productions]] had created. [[Frank Spotnitz]] said that \"In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we can, not just from ''The X-Files'' but from all the shows that we did here in Vancouver \u2013 ''[[Harsh Realm]]'', ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' and ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'' \u2013 and our crew is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years.

The set was an old roller rink or at least sounded like one, as it was very noisy. During filming, Carter placed a carrot juice bottle on the table of the set, having just finished the drink, as he thought it would be \"a nice sort of Mulder touch.\" Some of the artwork in Mulder's office came from a friend of Carter's who had a gallery in Vancouver and was named [[Monica Reyes]], a name that had previously been used in her honor for a character who features in a recurring role in the series' eighth season and appears as a main character in every episode of the series' ninth season. One of the pictures on the wall of Mulder's office was by [[Douglas Coupland]], who was featured in the real Monica Reyes' gallery and had written a book Carter liked which was called ''[[Hey Nostradamus!]]'', so Carter stuck a Post-it on which he wrote the book's title onto the picture.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\nThe exterior of the dorms for habitual sex offenders where Father Joe lives was actually an apartment complex in Vancouver that was slated for demolition while the production crew were filming there. Snow that can be seen outside the dorms was actually fake snow that was imported by the crew and fabricated by the film's Special Effects Department. Bill Roe and Mark Freeborn worked together to create a creepy green glow on the location using green lights. The production crew also created their own factory smoke for chimneys in the background, as Carter opined that the smoking chimneys made the location look like London. The interior of Joe's apartment was another set and was exactly like the real apartment except that it was slightly bigger. A trans-light was incorporated into the set to resemble daylight visible through a window of the apartment. The set also had a porch that was used for some shots in the scene where Mulder and Scully were outside the apartment.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Additional filming was done in [[Coquitlam]], another Vancouver suburb, at [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital']]s Unit 8 building.\n\n===Title===\nThe code name ''Done One'' was used as the film's working title during filming, with location signs labeled as \"Done One Productions.\"<ref name=\"Province\"/> The name meant the producers had already done one film. \"The Crying Box Productions\" was listed as the production company, instead of Carter's usual \"Ten Thirteen Productions.\"<ref>{{cite news | author=Davis, Erik | url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2007/10/29/x-files-2-gets-ready-to-roll-this-december/ | title='X-Files 2' Gets Ready to Roll This December | publisher=Cinematical | date=October 29, 2007 | access-date=September 5, 2009 }}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' posted a series of information sheets regarding upcoming studio films, and the 20th Century Fox fact sheet referred to the film as ''The X-Files: Done One''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/casting-call-106048 |title=Casting Call |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 3, 2008 |access-date=March 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 2008, the official title of the film was announced: ''The X-Files: I Want to Believe''.

In 2003, Carter called [[Mark Snow]], who by that time lived in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] and said he wanted him to return for another film. Snow was positive to the idea, but filming got bogged down by contract issues between [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and Carter. Once the contract issues were sorted out, Carter re-contacted Snow about the development, and later on sent him the script for the film. Carter and his production crew wanted as much secrecy for the film as possible, forcing Snow to sign a contract when receiving the script. After reading the script three times, Snow started on the \"visuals\" for the story.
