It was filmed on location in [[Ibiza]] and shot entirely in [[High-definition television|HD]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nIbiza locations used in the movie include the music venues [[Pacha Group|Pacha]], [[Amnesia (nightclub)|Amnesia]], [[Privilege Ibiza|Privilege]], [[DC10 (nightclub)|DC10]] and the historic Pike's Hotel and Cala Llonga beach.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=March 2020}}\nFrankie Wilde is a British music producer and a DJ based in Ibiza. After years of playing in night-clubs he loses his hearing, first apparent when he hears a [[Tinnitus|high-pitched whine]] instead of an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] [[Association football|football]] match on TV. At this time, Frankie is making his next album with his \"two Austrian mates\" Alfonse and Horst, but his hearing degrades rapidly and progress stagnates. Frankie refuses to acknowledge his problem until a gig in Amnesia, when he cannot hear the second channel in his headphones and must crossfade one song into the next without being able to beatmatch them. When the crowd boos him, he throws the turntable and the [[mixing console|mixer]] onto the dance floor, and is forcibly removed from the club.\n\nFrankie agrees to see a doctor, who tells him he has lost hearing in one ear and has 20% left in the other. He warns Frankie that unless he stops abusing drugs and listening to loud noises, he will soon be completely deaf, and even the use of his hearing aid would only further degrade his hearing. During a recording session, Frankie confesses the full nature of his hearing loss to Alfonse. He inserts his hearing aid to demonstrate and, overwhelmed by the sudden sound exposure, leans close to one of the monitor speakers. Before he can react, a frustrated Horst smashes a guitar into an amplifier whose volume Frankie has maximized. The noise is excruciating and the feedback bursts his eardrum, knocking Frankie unconscious. The damage leaves him permanently deaf.\n\nWithout his hearing, Frankie cannot complete his album. He loses his recording contract and his manager Max abandons him. Soon after, his wife Sonya leaves him. Frankie shuts himself into his home, which he has \"soundproofed\" with pillows in a desperate bid to recover his hearing, and his drug use intensifies. He sinks into a heavy depression, repeatedly throwing his body against the walls, and wrapping [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]]s around his head, either an attempt at suicide or a drastic way to recover his hearing, but dives into the pool before they ignite. Frankie flushes all his drugs down a toilet, but is once again tormented by a vision of a menacing coke badger, and when he fights and kills it, he learns that the badger is, in fact, himself.\n\nFrankie finds a deaf organization and meets Penelope, who coaches him in lip-reading. They become close, and eventually intimate. He confides his unhappiness at losing music, and she helps him perceive sound through visual and tactile methods instead. Frankie manages to devise a system for mixing songs, in which he watches [[Oscilloscope|an oscilloscope trace]] while resting his feet on the pulsating speakers. Using this system, he manages to produce a new mix CD (''Hear No Evil'') entirely by himself. He delivers it to Max, who is wildly pleased \u2013 particularly by the potential of exploiting Frankie's disability to increase record sales. He has Frankie take part in promotions that are increasingly offensive and insensitive to deaf people, of which Penelope disapproves.\n\nMax convinces Frankie to play live at Pacha as a career comeback, despite Frankie's insistence that he has nothing to prove to his critics. The gig goes exceedingly well, and many claim it shows even greater talent than his early work. After the show, Frankie and Penelope disappear from Max and the music scene altogether. In a talking heads sequence, characters speculate on where he is now, if alive. As the film ends, we see Frankie disguised as a homeless street musician, who is met by Penelope carrying their child. They affectionately walk together down a street unrecognised. Additionally, we see Frankie teaching a group of deaf children how to perceive sound like he does.\n\n==Characters and cast==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:frankiewilde.jpg|right|thumb|Frankie, DJ god, descends from the heavens of an Ibiza mega club.]] -->\n* Frankie Wilde ([[Paul Kaye]]) is the king of DJs, slowly losing his hearing, and soon to lose everything he thinks is important to him: his job, his fame and his trophy wife.\n* Penelope ([[Beatriz Batarda]]) is the deaf lip-reading instructor who gives Frankie the tough love he never had and always needed.\n* Sonya ([[Kate Magowan]]) is Frankie's supermodel wife. Her days are filled with deciding on what theme is more appropriate for their garden: Japanese or Spanish?\n* Max Haggar ([[Mike Wilmot]]) is Frankie's agent. Fat, balding and brash, Max is all about money and his mobile phone is his lifeline.\n* Jack Stoddart ([[Neil Maskell]]) is the ruthless [[CEO]] of Motor Records who has no sympathy for Frankie. He says, \"I didn\u2019t want a deaf DJ on the label. I didn\u2019t want the company to be touched with the deaf stamp. Well, business is tough and sometimes you have to make awkward decisions and I\u2019ve made harder decisions than dropping the deaf DJ.\"\n\n===Cameos===\nSeveral real world DJs appear in the film, lending the film a sense of authenticity,<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> like [[Carl Cox]], [[Fatboy Slim]] and Pete Tong himself, who also executive produced the film.<ref name=\"Eisner\">{{cite news |last1=Eisner |first1=Ken |title=It's All Gone Pete Tong |url=https://www.straight.com/article/its-all-gone-pete-tong |access-date=27 February 2020 |work=[[The Georgia Straight]] |date=June 9, 2005}}</ref> Others include [[Tijs Verwest|Ti\u00ebsto]], [[Sarah Main]], [[Dub Pistols|Barry Ashworth]], [[Paul van Dyk]] and [[Lol Hammond]].\n\n''[[FUBAR (film)|Fubar]]'' rockers [[Paul Spence]] and David Lawrence, from Dowse's earlier film, also have cameos as Austrian hangers-on.<ref name=\"Eisner\" />\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\nThe film's soundtrack was released by [[EMI]] on 4 October 2005 as a [[Double album|double disc]] [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] for the film.

There is a kind of desperation in any club scene (as ''24-Hour Party People'' memorably demonstrated); it can be exhausting, having a good time, and the relentless pursuit of happiness becomes an effort to recapture remembered bliss from the past.<ref name=\"Ebert\" /></blockquote>\n\nMelissa Mohaupt writing in ''[[Exclaim!]]'' noted \"resemblances to various hipster films about music, drugs, excess and failure\" such as ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', yet it \"never feels stale\". There are plenty of quotable quips, and even Frankie's attempted suicide is \"high-larious\". She says the film manages to be \"uplifting without being preachy or cheesy. There are important life lessons to be learned here, or you could just ignore them and enjoy some clever comedy.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mohaupt |first1=Melissa |title=It's All Gone Pete Tong: Michael Dowse |journal=[[Exclaim!]] |date=1 June 2005 |url=http://exclaim.ca/film/article/its_all_gone_pete_tong-michael_dowse |access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nKen Eisner of ''[[The Georgia Straight]]'' liked the film's \"zippy visual style, with sun-dappled primary colours and whirlwind editing to go with the hip pop tunes and block-rockin' beats\".
