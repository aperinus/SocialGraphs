The original film told the true story of the [[Akita (dog)|Akita dog]] named [[Hachik\u014d]] who lived in [[Japan]] in the 1920s. This version, which places it in a modern American context, was directed by [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]], written by Stephen P. Lindsey and [[Kaneto Shindo]], and produced by [[Richard Gere]], Bill Johnson and Vicki Shigekuni Wong. The film stars Gere, [[Joan Allen]], [[Sarah Roemer]], [[Jason Alexander]] and [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]].\n\n''Hachi: A Dog's Tale'' premiered at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] on June 13, 2009, and its first theatrical release was in Japan on August 8, 2009. The film was given a UK theatrical release on March 12, 2010, courtesy of [[Entertainment Film Distributors]], and opened in more than 60 countries throughout 2009 and 2010. By the end of September 2010, the film's foreign box office returns had totalled more than $45 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|date=2010-09-24|title=Film Has Two Big Names and a Dog, but No Big Screens|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/arts/television/25dogs.html|access-date=2020-05-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] decided to forgo a U.S. theatrical release, bringing the film out on DVD on March 9, 2010<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009) - Misc Notes - TCM.com|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/676940/Hachi-A-Dog-s-Tale/misc-notes.html|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>  and eventually selling it to the [[Hallmark Channel]], where it debuted on September 26, 2010.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins with Ronnie narrating to his class that his personal hero is his grandfather Parker Wilson's dog Hachi and the story goes in flashback.\n\nParker Wilson (played by [[Richard Gere]]), a professor who commutes to nearby [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], finds a young [[dog]] (played by Layla) lost on the railway station platform in Bedridge and temporarily takes it home. (The audience sees that it was freighted by a Japanese monastery and that the tag of its basket was torn in transit.) The dog remains unclaimed but grows close to Parker as he takes it everywhere with him. Parker's Japanese friend Ken tells him that the dog is a breed called [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] and that the character on its collar tag is \"Hachi\" (\"Eight\" in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-language). Parker thus gives the name \"Hachi\" to the dog as it is a lucky number. Parker's wife Cate Wilson (played by [[Joan Allen]]) eventually warms to Hachi but he sleeps outside in his own shed. Meanwhile, Parker tries in vain to train Hachi in normal dog things like fetching a [[ball]]. Ken explains to him that Akita dogs cannot be trained and that if Hachi fetches the ball, it will be for a special reason. Later, Parker's daughter Andy (played by [[Sarah Roemer]]) gets married to Michael (played by Robbie Sublett) and Hachi is in the family marriage photograph. Soon after the marriage, Andy announces that she is pregnant. One spring morning, a grown up Hachi (played by Chico) digs under the fence and follows Parker to the railway station. He refuses to go home and Parker misses the train. He hands him over to Cate and catches the next train. At 5:00pm, he returns from the train and is surprised to find Hachi waiting for him at the railway station. He is even more surprised to learn that he came to the railway station all by himself. A daily routine begins: the two walk to the railway station, Parker leaves from the train, Hachi goes home, and returns at 5:00pm to receive Parker.\n\nHowever, one winter morning, Hachi behaves strangely at home and then follows Parker to the railway station with the ball. Parker throws the ball towards him and much to his delight, Hachi fetches it for the first time. They play for a while and Parker eventually puts the ball in his pocket and begins to leave. Hachi barks and barks and watches Parker's train leaving. Hours later, while still holding the ball, Parker suffers a fatal [[stroke]] in his classroom and collapses to death while Hachi waits for him at the railway station. At 9:30pm, Michael comes to the railway station and takes Hachi home. From his shed, Hachi watches the family mourning Parker. The next morning, Parker's family members and friends gather for his funeral while Hachi goes to the railway station to wait. Soon, Cate sells the house and moves away and Hachi goes to live with Andy and Michael and their infant son Ronnie. However, Hachi follows the train tracks to Bedridge. Andy and Michael find him and take him back to their house but Andy ends up realising that Hachi is pining for Parker and opens the gate for him. Hachi licks her hand and runs back to the Bedridge railway station. Hachi now waits at the railway station everyday for hot-dog seller Jasjeet and the other passers-by feed him. Soon, a reporter writes a story about Hachi and people start sending him money and cards. Ken reads Hachi's news and travels to Bedridge where he speaks to Hachi in Japanese: He too misses his friend. On Parker's tenth death anniversary, Cate arrives in town to visit his grave where Ken is present too. She is moved to see an elderly Hachi (played by Forrest) still waiting at the railway station for his master. Later, Cate tells a 10-year-old Ronnie a story of Hachi who slowly settles in place. The audience sees flashbacks of Parker and Hachi together and a last passenger pauses at the door of the railway station. It is Parker who shouts \"Hachi!\" and the dog raises his head, runs to him and they embrace. Hachi lies dead at his place at the railway station while still waiting for Parker and the camera pans up to the night sky.\n\nIn the present, Ronnie narrates that his grandfather and Hachi taught him the meaning of \"loyalty\" which means \"you should never forget anyone you have loved\". He concludes that Hachi will forever be his personal hero and the class applauds. From the school bus, Ronnie is met by Michael and a tiny new puppy who is also named Hachi. The film ends with Ronnie and the puppy traveling through the same tracks Hachi traveled years ago.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main ===\n* Layla / Chico / Forrest \u2013 [[Hachik\u014d|Hachi Wilson]] \n* [[Richard Gere]] \u2013 [[Hidesabur\u014d Ueno|Professor Parker Wilson]] \n* [[Joan Allen]] \u2013 Cate Wilson\n* [[Sarah Roemer]] - Andy Wilson\n* Robbie Collier Sublett - Michael\n\n=== Supporting ===\n* Kevin DeCoste - Ronnie, Michael and Andy's son \n* [[Erick Avari]] \u2013 Jasjeet, the Indian hot-dog cart vendor\n* [[Jason Alexander]] \u2013 Carl Boilins, the train station master\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] \u2013 Ken Fujiyoshi, the Japanese professor who is Parker's friend\n* Davenia McFadden \u2013 Mary-Ann, the bookstore owner\n* Tora Hallstr\u00f6m \u2013 Heather, one of Ronnie's classmates\n\n== Production ==\nThe end credits include a disclaimer warning that \"Although beloved by many as a family pet, Akitas are recommended only for dedicated and experienced dog owners,\" referring viewers to the [http://www.americanhumane.org/ American Humane Society] and the [https://www.akc.org/ American Kennel Club] for more information.\n\nWhen David Itzkoff wrote about the film in a September 24, 2010, article headlined \"Film has Two Big Names and a Dog but No Big Screens\", he reported that Sony refused to comment on its decision not to release the picture to theaters in the United States.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe color in scenes filmed from the dog's point of view is desaturated almost to black-and-white. Although there are several scenes from Hachi's [[Point-of-view shot|POV]], the film never puts human dialogue in Hachi's mind/mouth.\n\nAnimal trainer Mark Harden and his team trained the three Akitas\u2014Layla, Chico and Forrest\u2014who played the role of Hachi in the movie.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ganzert|first1=Robin|url=https://archive.org/details/animalstarsbehin0000ganz|title=Animal Stars: Behind the Scenes with Your Favorite Animal Actors|last2=Anderson|first2=Allen|last3=Anderson|first3=Linda|publisher=New World Library|year=2014|isbn=9781608682645|page=[https://archive.org/details/animalstarsbehin0000ganz/page/77 77]|chapter=Chapter 6: Mark Harden (Los Angeles County, California)|quote=Animal Stars: Behind the Scenes with Your Favorite Animal Actors.|access-date=February 3, 2017|url-access=registration}}</ref> Harden adopted Chico after the movie was completed.

''New York Times'' reporter [[Dave Itzkoff|David Itzkoff]] repeated Richard Gere's description of the challenging process of getting to know his canine co-stars:<ref name=\":0\" /> <blockquote>There was, Mr. Gere said, \"a certain amount of anxiety, of would we get along? They cannot be bought.\" But after about three days, he said, \"One of the dogs came over and put her head right on my lap. And that was a big moment - I was accepted in the pack.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>The movie was based on the real Japanese Akita dog [[Hachik\u014d]], who was born in [[\u014cdate]], [[Japan]], in 1923. After the death of his owner, [[Ueno Hidesabur\u014d]] in 1925, Hachik\u014d returned to the [[Shibuya Station|Shibuya train station]] the next day and every day after that for the next nine years until he died in March 1935. A bronze statue of Hachik\u014d is in front of the [[Shibuya Station|Shibuya train station]] in his honor, in the spot where he waited. Hachik\u014d is known in Japanese as '''''ch\u016bken Hachik\u014d''''' (\u5fe0\u72ac\u30cf\u30c1\u516c) \"faithful dog Hachik\u014d\", ''hachi'' meaning \"eight\" and ''k\u014d'' meaning \"affection.\"<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Kotobank |title=K\u014d (\u516c) |url =http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%85%AC |quote=\u4eba\u3084\u52d5\u7269\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306b\u4ed8\u3051\u3066\uff0c\u89aa\u3057\u307f\uff0c\u3042\u308b\u3044\u306f\u3084\u3084\u8efd\u3093\u305a\u308b\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3092\u8868\u3059\u3002}}</ref> The film ends with a text panel summarizing the story of the real Hachik\u014d, a photo of the dog and a shot of the bronze statue. According to the movie's closing cards, the real Hachik\u014d died in March 1934, while the earlier movie, ''Hachik\u014d Monogatari'', and other sources state that his actual death was on March 1935 (9 years and 9 months after Professor Ueno's death).\n\nThe majority of filming took place in [[Bristol, Rhode Island|Bristol]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.vickiwongandhachi.com/blog--whats-new/see-actual-hachi-film-locations-on-google-maps| work= Behind the Film \"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\"| publisher= VickiWongandHachi.com | first= Vicki Shigekuni | last= Wong| title= See Actual Hachi Film Locations on Google Maps | date= March 30, 2014 | access-date= February 3, 2017}}</ref> The only spoken reference to the actual location where filming took place is when the newspaper reporter Teddy states he works for the ''[[Woonsocket Call]]'' (Woonsocket's daily newspaper).\n\nAdditional locations included the [[University of Rhode Island]] in [[Kingston, Rhode Island]], along the Providence and Worcester Railroad Mechanical, and the Columbus Theater located in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. A second production unit filmed scenes on-location in Japan. Footage was shot at the (now closed) Reynolds Elementary School in Bristol.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn October 2009, Christopher Lloyd of the ''[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune|Sarasota Herald Tribune]]'' gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, noting:  \"''Hachi: A Dog's Tale'' is unapologetically a tear-jerker.

The train depot at One Depot Square was renamed Hachiko Place. The Rhode Island statue's dedication ceremony was part of the [[cherry blossoms|Cherry Blossom]] Festival held in three Rhode Island towns: Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket. Dignitaries including the Mayor of Woonsocket and the Consul General of Japan attended the ceremony. Two cherry blossom trees were planted by the statue. A visitor from New Jersey's Akita-mix (also named Hachi) was invited to participate at the ribbon-cutting ceremony as a \"real-life stand-in for Hachiko\".\n\nThe [[Blackstone Valley]] Heritage Corridor and the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council have created a handout with useful info for people who want to take a tour of the movie locations for \"Hachi\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://hachikousa.com/guide.pdf| website= hachikousa.com| title= Welcome to Woonsocket and the home of the Hachiko monument! |publisher= Blackstone Heritage Corridor, Inc. | access-date= February 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn commemoration of the daily vigil, a lone statue of Hachiko was erected in front of Shibuya Station in 1934, even while the canine was still alive.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://dogwithblog.in/hachiko-reunited-with-his-human/| website= dogwithblog.in| title= Hachiko Reunited with his human. |publisher= Dogwithblog. | access-date= April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Score ==\nThe film score of ''Hachi'' was composed by [[Jan A.
