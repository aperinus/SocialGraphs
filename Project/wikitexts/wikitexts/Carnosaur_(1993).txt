The film stars [[Diane Ladd]], [[Raphael Sbarge]], [[Jennifer Runyon]], and [[Harrison Page]]. Loosely based on the 1984 [[John Brosnan]] novel of [[Carnosaur (novel)|the same name]], it follows characters Doc Smith and Ann Thrush in their efforts to thwart Dr. Jane Tiptree's plan to exterminate the human race with a lethal virus and replace them with her own genetically created dinosaurs.\n\n[[Roger Corman]] acquired the rights to Brosnan's novel in 1991 and the project entered production two years later to capitalize on an extensive marketing campaign used to promote ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Simon was hired to direct ''Carnosaur'' and is credited with writing the screenplay, reworking most of the plot elements of the novel. Afforded an $850,000 budget, the special effects were completed with models and animatronics largely designed by [[John Carl Buechler]].\n\n''Carnosaur'' was released on May 14, 1993 in Ogden, Utah and then released regionally in the United States on May 15, 1993  and grossed $1.8 million. The film was panned by critics. [[Roger Ebert]] named it the worst movie of 1993, though his colleague [[Gene Siskel]] liked the film.<ref name=\"Siskel & Ebert review\">[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=1&subsec=909 ''Siskel & Ebert'' review]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The film has since gained a cult following as a \"[[mockbuster]]\".<ref>Brian Raftery. \"[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/ff_the_asylum/all/1 Now Playing: Cheap-and-Schlocky Blockbuster Ripoffs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218151121/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/ff_the_asylum/all/1 |date=December 18, 2013 }}\", ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', 21 December 2009.

The [[DARPA]] is wary of her work with genetically modified chickens but cannot legally interfere in her research. While in transport, one of Tiptree's chickens hatches a reptilian creature which kills the driver and escapes. Meanwhile, near her laboratory in the small town of Climax, Nevada, the populace begin suffering from a mysterious illness with flu-like symptoms.\n\nAt a neighboring Eunice-owned quarry, watchman Doc Smith protects excavation equipment from [[Environmental movement|environmentalists]]. He reports a trespasser, Ann Thrush, but Sheriff Fowler is investigating a series of gruesome killings, perpetrated by Tiptree's missing creature, a ''[[Deinonychus]]''. Among the victims is the daughter of Eunice employee Jesse Paloma, but before he raises any suspicion to her research, Tiptree lures him into a laser-protected dinosaur pen where a fully grown ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' devours him.\n\nDespite the deaths, Thrush and a group of activists handcuff themselves to excavation equipment in a form of protest. They are encountered by the ''Deinonychus'' and everyone except Thrush is slaughtered. Still in shock, Thrush is brought back by Doc to his trailer, where she survives another attack by the creature. Doc discovers a truck with two corpses belonging to Eunice and contacts Tiptree on the vehicle's radio, deducing the creature originated from her facility. As he approaches the lab, Fowler discovers a dinosaur embryo in a carton of eggs and takes it for investigation.\n\nDoc infiltrates Tiptree's laboratory and, at gunpoint, she reveals her experiment subjects to him. The town's mysterious illness is caused by infected chicken eggs, which contain a lethal airborne virus and impregnate women with dinosaur embryos. Her objective is to exterminate the human race, which Tiptree faults as disastrous, and enable dinosaurs to repopulate the Earth. News of the town's deaths reach Eunice sponsors who trace it to Tiptree. In response, the government places the community under quarantine and resolves to kill all civilians \u2014 infected or not \u2014 on sight.\n\nWith the illness rapidly spreading, Fowler responds to a disturbance at a pet shop. He confronts the ''Deinonychus'', but both he and the dinosaur suffer fatal wounds in the exchange. Top governmental officials, in a secure underground bunker, also begin plotting the repopulation of the human race in response to the virus; they envision a new social order prograted by strict fertilization policies and artificial wombs. At the laboratory, Doc attempts to escape with a cure to the illness and mistakenly enters the dinosaur pen. Tiptree releases the ''T. rex'' which pursues Doc out of the facility. Infected herself, Tiptree births a dinosaur and succumbs to the illness.\n\nDoc returns to Thrush, who has been exposed to the illness. The ''T. rex'' enters the quarry where Doc use a loader to battle it. He disembowels and kills the dinosaur with Thrush's assistance. After injecting her with the serum, Doc is killed by government soldiers alerted to his presence, and both his and Thrush's bodies are burned.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Dr. Jane Tiptree\n* [[Raphael Sbarge]] as \"Doc\" Smith\n* [[Jennifer Runyon]] as Ann Thrush\n* [[Harrison Page]] as Sheriff Fowler\n* [[Ned Bellamy]] as Fallon\n* [[Clint Howard]] as \"Slim\" Friar\n* [[Frank Novak]] as Jesse Paloma\n* [[Ed Williams (actor)|Ed Williams]] as Dr. Raven\n* Brent Hinkley as Peregrine\n\n==Production==\n[[John Brosnan]]'s 1984 science fiction novel ''[[Carnosaur (novel)|Carnosaur]]'' first came to the attention of [[Roger Corman]] during the author's book signing tour.{{sfn|Berry|2002|p=46}} Brosnan was first approached to write the [[screenplay]] in mid-1991 by Corman's wife, Julie, who agreed to meet and they formalized a deal at a bar, written on some napkins.<ref name=\"live\">\n{{cite magazine|url=http://efanzines.com/YOLO/YouOnlyLiveOnce.pdf|title=You only Live Once|magazine=[[eFanzines]]|last=Huett|first=Kim|date=2007|location=Woden, Australia|access-date=February 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174555/http://efanzines.com/YOLO/YouOnlyLiveOnce.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live}}\n</ref> Although Corman secured the rights to produce ''Carnosaur'', the project advanced only when he learned that ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' was entering production.{{sfn|Berry|2002|p=46}} According to co-producer Mike Elliot, Corman \"felt that now was the time to shoot our movie, because he knew he could make the movie faster than anybody else and get it out there first\".{{sfn|Berry|2002|p=46}}\n\n[[Adam Simon]], a frequent collaborator with Corman, was tasked with directing ''Carnosaur'' and writing its screenplay.
