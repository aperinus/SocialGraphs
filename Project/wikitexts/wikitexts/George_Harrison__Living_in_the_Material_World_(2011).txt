It earned six nominations at the [[64th Primetime Emmy Awards]], winning two [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Documentary/Nonfiction Program|Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special|Outstanding Nonfiction Special]]. A companion book was released alongside the film, as well as an album of Harrison's demo recordings called ''[[Early Takes: Volume 1]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows musician [[George Harrison]]'s story from his early life in [[Liverpool]], the [[Beatlemania]] phenomenon, his travels to India, the influence of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna Consciousness]] movement in his music, and his relevance and importance as a member of [[the Beatles]]. It consists of previously unseen footage and interviews with [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia]] and [[Dhani Harrison]], friends, and many others.\n\n==Appearances==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*[[Neil Aspinall]]\n*[[John Barham]]\n*[[Jane Birkin]]\n*[[Pattie Boyd]]\n*[[Eric Clapton]]\n*[[Ray Cooper]]\n*[[Bob Dylan]]\n*[[Mal Evans]]\n*[[Terry Gilliam]]\n*[[Mukunda Goswami]]\n*[[Dhani Harrison]]\n*[[Olivia Harrison]]\n*Harry Harrison\n*Irene Harrison\n*Louise Harrison\n*Pauline Harrison\n*Peter Harrison\n*[[Damon Hill]]\n*[[Eric Idle]]\n*Arthur Kelly\n*[[Jim Keltner]]\n*[[Astrid Kirchherr]]\n*Paul Lanzanic\n*[[John Lennon]]\n*[[Jeff Lynne]]\n*[[George Martin]]\n*[[Paul McCartney]]\n*[[Gary Moore]]\n*[[Gordon Murray]]\n*[[Yoko Ono]]\n*[[Roy Orbison]]\n*[[Tom Petty]]\n*[[Billy Preston]]\n*Red Ronnie\n*[[Ken Scott]]\n*[[Ravi Shankar]]\n*[[Phil Spector]]\n*[[Ringo Starr]]\n*[[Jackie Stewart]]\n*Joan Taylor\n*[[Klaus Voormann]]\n*[[Gary Wright]]\n*[[George Harrison]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter Harrison's death in 2001, various production companies approached his widow Olivia about producing a film about her late husband's life. She declined because he had wanted to tell his own life story through his video archive. Upon meeting Scorsese, she gave her blessings and signed on to the film project as a producer.\n\nAccording to Scorsese, he was attracted to the project because \"That subject matter has never left me...The more you're in the material world, the more there is a tendency for a search for serenity and a need to not be distracted by physical elements that are around you. His music is very important to me, so I was interested in the journey that he took as an artist. The film is an exploration. We don't know. We're just feeling our way through.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Carlick |first=Stephen |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=143&csid2=844&fid1=46519 |title=Martin Scorsese to Unveil George Harrison Documentary in 2011 |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=17 May 2010 |access-date=7 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515163554/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=143 |archive-date=15 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThroughout 2008 and 2009, Scorsese alternated working between ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and the documentary.
