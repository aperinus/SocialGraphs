The boys disrespect him and play pranks on him. Rath punishes several of his students for circulating photographs of the beautiful Lola Lola ([[Marlene Dietrich]]), the headliner for the local [[cabaret]], \"The Blue Angel\". Hoping to catch the boys at the club, Rath goes there later that evening. He does find some students there, but while chasing them, he also finds Lola backstage and sees her partially disrobing. When he returns to the cabaret the following evening to return a pair of [[panties]] that were smuggled into his coat by one of his students, he ends up staying the night with her. The next morning, reeling from his night of passion, Rath arrives late to school to find his classroom in chaos; the [[school principal|principal]] is furious and threatens to fire Rath.\n\nRath gives up his position at the school to marry Lola. Their happiness is short-lived, however, as Rath becomes humiliatingly dependent on Lola. Over several years, he sinks lower and lower, first selling dirty postcards, and then becoming a clown in Lola's troupe to pay the bills. His growing insecurities about Lola's profession as a \"shared woman\" eventually consume him with lust and jealousy.\n\nThe troupe returns to his hometown and The Blue Angel, where everyone turns out to see the professor they knew play a clown. Once onstage, Rath is humiliated, not only by a magician who breaks eggs on his head but also by seeing Lola embrace and kiss the strongman Mazeppa. He is enraged to the point of insanity. He attempts to strangle Lola, but the strongman and others subdue him and lock him in a straitjacket.\n\nLater that night, Rath is released. He leaves and goes to his old classroom. Rejected, humiliated, and destitute, he dies clutching the desk at which he once taught.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n{{div col begin}}\n*[[Emil Jannings]] as Professor Immanuel Rath\n*[[Marlene Dietrich]] as Lola Lola\n*[[Kurt Gerron]] as Kiepert, the magician\n*[[Rosa Valetti]] as Guste, the magician's wife\n*[[Hans Albers]] as Mazeppa, the strongman\n*[[Reinhold Bernt]] as the clown\n*[[Eduard von Winterstein]] as the director of school\n*Hans Roth as the caretaker of the secondary school\n*Rolf M\u00fcller as Pupil Angst\n*[[Roland Varno]] as Pupil Lohmann\n*[[Carl Balhaus]] as Pupil Ertzum\n*Robert Klein-L\u00f6rk as Pupil Goldstaub\n*[[Charles Puffy]] as Innkeeper\n*[[Wilhelm Diegelmann]] as Captain\n*[[Gerhard Bienert]] as Policeman\n*[[Ilse F\u00fcrstenberg]] as Rath's maid\n*[[Die Weintraub Syncopators]] as Orchestra\n*[[Friedrich Hollaender]] as Pianist\n*Wolfgang Staudte as Pupil\n{{div col end}}\n}}\n\n== Music ==\n[[File:Blue-Angel-Dietrich-Chorines.jpg|thumb|Lola Lola surrounded by chorines on stage at The Blue Angel cabaret]]\n*\"{{lang|de|[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)|Ich bin von Kopf bis Fu\u00df auf Liebe eingestellt]]}}\" (\"Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)\")\n**music and lyrics by [[Friedrich Hollaender]], sung by Marlene Dietrich\n*\"{{lang|de|Ich bin die fesche Lola}}\" (\"They Call Me Naughty Lola\")\n**music by [[Friedrich Hollaender]], lyrics by [[Robert Liebmann]], sung by Marlene Dietrich\n*\"{{lang|de|Nimm Dich in Acht vor blonden Frau'n}}\" (\"Beware of Blond Women\")\n**music by [[Friedrich Hollaender]], lyrics by [[Richard Rillo]], sung by Marlene Dietrich\n*\"{{lang|de|Kinder, heut' abend, da such' ich mir was aus}}\" (\"A Man, Just a Regular Man\")\n**music by [[Friedrich Hollaender]], lyrics by [[Robert Liebmann]],<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/3724/The-Blue-Angel/music.html \"Music\"] on TCM.com</ref> sung by Marlene Dietrich\n\nThe film also features the famous [[carillon]] of the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church at Potsdam]], playing \"{{lang|de|\u00dcb' immer Treu und Redlichkeit}}\" (Always Be True and Faithful), as well as an orchestral version of the tune. The original melody was composed by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] for Papageno's aria, {{lang|de|Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen}}, in ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.

Fortunately for Sternberg, Paramount's sister studio in Germany, [[Universum Film AG|UFA]], offered him the opportunity to direct Emil Jannings in his first sound film. Jannings was the Oscar-winning star of Sternberg's 1928 movie ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'', and had specially requested Sternberg's participation, despite an \"early clash of temperaments\" on the set.<ref name=\"Sarris, 1966. p. 25\">Sarris, 1966. p. 25</ref><ref>Baxter, 1971. p. 63</ref><ref name=\"Weinberg, 1967. p. 48\">Weinberg, 1967. p. 48</ref>\n\nThough ''The Blue Angel'' and ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'', both from 1930, are often cited as his first sound films, Sternberg had already directed \"a startling experiment\" in asynchronous sound techniques with his 1929 ''[[Thunderbolt (1929 film)|Thunderbolt]]''.<ref>Sarris, 1998. pp. 217\u2013218</ref>\n\n==Casting Lola Lola==\nSinger [[Lucie Mannheim]] was favored by UFA producer Erich Pommer for the part of Lola, with support from leading man Emil Jannings, but Sternberg vetoed her as insufficiently glamorous for a major production.  Sternberg also turned down author Mann's actress-girlfriend [[Trude Hesterberg]]. [[Brigitte Helm]], seriously considered by Sternberg, was not available for the part. Sternberg and Pommer settled on stage and film actress [[K\u00e4the Haack]] for the amount of 25,000 Reichsmarks.<ref>Baxter, 1971. p. 66</ref>\n\nBiographer [[Herman G. Weinberg]], citing Sternberg's memoirs (1966) reports that the director had his first look at the 29-year-old Marie Magdalene \"Marlene\" Dietrich at a music revue named the ''Zwei Krawatten'' (Two Neckties), produced by dramatist [[Georg Kaiser]].\n\nSternberg began immediately to groom Dietrich into \"the woman he saw she could become\".\n\nCritic Andrew Sarris remarks on the irony of this singular director-actress relationship: \"Josef von Sternberg is too often subordinated to the mystique of Marlene Dietrich...the [[Svengali|Svengali-Trilby]] publicity that enshrouded ''The Blue Angel'' \u2013 and the other six Sternberg-Dietrich film collaborations \u2013 obscured the more meaningful merits not only of these particular works but of Sternberg's career as a whole.\"<ref>Sarris, 1998. p. 210</ref>\n\n==Production==\nAfter arriving at Berlin's UFA studios, Sternberg declined an offer to direct a film about [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], the former Russian spiritual advisor to the family of [[Czar Nicholas II]]. He was intrigued, however, by a story from socialist reformer [[Heinrich Mann]] entitled ''[[Professor Unrat]]'' (''Professor Filth'') (1905), which critiques \"the false morality and corrupt values of the German middle class\" and agreed to adapt it.<ref name=\"Weinberg, 1967. p. 48\"/><ref>Baxter, 1971. p. 63, p. 66</ref>\n\nThe narrative of Mann's story was largely abandoned by Sternberg (with the author's consent), retaining only scenes describing an affair between a college professor of high rectitude who becomes infatuated with a promiscuous cabaret singer. During the filming, Sternberg altered dialog, added scenes and modified cast characterizations that \"gave the script an entirely new dimension.\"<ref>Baxter, 1971. p. 72</ref><ref>Weinberg, 1967. p. 50</ref> The Professor's descent from sexual infatuation to jealous rage and insanity was entirely the director's invention.<ref name=\"Sarris, 1966. p. 25\">Sarris, 1966. p. 25</ref><ref>Weinberg, 1967. P.50</ref>\n\nIn order to maximize the film's profitability, ''The Blue Angel'' was filmed in both German and English, each shot in tandem for efficiency. The shooting spanned 11-weeks, from 4 November 1929 to 22 January 1930 at an estimated budget of $500,000\u2014remarkably expensive for a UFA production of that period.<ref>Weinberg, 1967. p. 51</ref><ref>Baxter, 1971. p. 63, 67 pp. 74\u201375</ref><ref>Sarris, 1966. p. 25:\"The film was produced simultaneously in German and English language versions for the maximum benefit of the Paramount-Ufa combine in world [movie distribution] markets.\"</ref>\n\nDuring filming, although he was still the nominal star of the film (with top billing), Jannings could see the growing closeness between Sternberg and Dietrich and the care the director took in presenting her, and the actor became jealous, engaging in histrionics and threatening to quit the production. ''The Blue Angel'' was to be his last great cinematic moment; it was also one of UFA's last successful films.<ref>Baxter, 1971. p. 74: The production \"was complicated [by the Sternberg/Dietrich] romance...Jannings, as expected, had reacted with special bitterness to the affair, working actively to break down their rapport, throwing tantrums and threatening to walk out.\"</ref><ref>Baxter, 1971. p. 63, pp. 74\u201375: ''The Blue Angel'' \"had no successors at UFA\"</ref> Film historian [[Andrew Sarris]] comments on this double irony:\n\n{{blockquote|\"The ultimately [[tragic irony]] of ''The Blue Angel'' is double-edged in a way Sternberg could not have anticipated when he undertook the project. The rise of Lola Lola and fall of Professor Immanuel Rath in reel [''sic''] life is paralleled in the real life by the rise of Marlene Dietrich and the fall of Emil Jannings...\"<ref name=\"Sarris, 1966. p. 25\">Sarris, 1966. p. 25</ref><ref>Sarris, 1998. p. 220</ref>}}\n\n==Release==\n''The Blue Angel'' was scheduled for its Berlin premiere on 1 April 1930, but UFA owner and industrialist [[Alfred Hugenberg]], unhappy with socialist Heinrich Mann's association with the production, blocked release. Production manager Pommer defended the film, and Mann issued a statement distancing his anti-bourgeois critique from Sternberg's more sympathetic portrayal of Professor Immanuel Rath in his movie version.<ref>Weinberg, 1967. pp. 53\u201354</ref> Sternberg, who declared himself apolitical, had departed the country in February, shortly after the film was completed and the internecine conflict emerged. Hugenberg ultimately relented on the grounds of financial expediency, still convinced that Sternberg had concealed within ''The Blue Angel'' \"a parody of the German bourgeoisie.\"<ref>Baxter, 1971. pp. 74\u201375</ref><ref>Weinberg, 1967. p. 54: \"Hugenberg [a political reactionary] had sensed that, within the framework of an entertainment film, Sternberg had subtly mirrored the paranoiac tendencies of the Prussian bourgeoisie.\"</ref>\n\nThe film proved to be \"an instant international success.\"<ref>Baxter, 1971. p. 75</ref><ref>Weinberg, 1967. p. 54</ref> Dietrich, at Sternberg's insistence, was brought to Hollywood under contract to Paramount, where they would film and release ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' in 1930 before ''The Blue Angel'' would appear in American theatres in 1931.<ref>Sarris, 1998. p. 219</ref>\n\n==Themes and analysis==\n''The Blue Angel'', ostensibly a story of the downfall of a respectable middle-age academic at the hands of a pretty young cabaret singer, is Sternberg's \"most brutal and least humorous\" film of his ''\u0153uvre''.<ref>Sarris, 1998. pp. 219\u2013220</ref><ref>Sarris, 1998. p. 121: \"''The Blue Angel'' (1930) [depicts] the downfall of a middle-aged bourgeois male through the machinations of a disreputable [[demi-mondaine]]...\"</ref> The harshness of the narrative \"transcends the trivial genre of bourgeois male corrupted by bohemian female\" and the complexity of Sternberg's character development rejects \"the old stereotype of the seductress\" who ruthlessly cuckolds her men.<ref name=\"Sarris, 1998. pp. 220\u2013221\">Sarris, 1998. pp. 220\u2013221</ref>\n\nFilm historian [[Andrew Sarris]] outlines Sternberg's \"complex interplay\" between Lola and the Professor:\n\n{{blockquote|\"''The Blue Angel'' achieved its most electrifying effects through careful grading and construction. When Dietrich sings \"Falling in Love Again\" for the first time, the delivery is playful, flirtatious, and self-consciously seductive. The final rendition is harsher, colder, and remorseless. The difference in delivery is not related to the old sterotype of the seductress finally showing her true colors, but rather to a psychological development in Dietrich's Lola from mere sensual passivity to a more forceful fatalism about the nature of her desires. Lola's first instinct is to accept the Professor's paternal protection and her last is to affirm her natural instincts, not as coquettish expedients but as the very terms by which she expresses her existence. Thus, as the Professor has been defeated by Lola's beauty, Lola has been ennobled by the Professor's jealousy...\"<ref name=\"Sarris, 1998. pp. 220\u2013221\">Sarris, 1998. pp. 220\u2013221</ref>}}\n\nBiographer [[John Baxter (author)|John Baxter]] echoes this the key thematic sequence that reveals \"the tragic dignity\" of Rath's downfall:\n\n{{blockquote| \"[T]he tragedy of Immanuel Rath was not that he lost his head over a woman, but that he could not reconcile the loss of power with the acquisition of freedom.\" When Rath is forced to relinquish \"his authority [over] his students, he sinks into alienated apathy\u2026Rath's failure to grasp the chance opened to him\u2026is portrayed in terms of his increasing silence, as he sinks more and more sullenly into the guise of the ridiculous, ironically named clown\u2026In the end, the authoritarian master of language is bereft of articulate speech\", finally erupting into a \"paraoxysmic cockscrow\" when he discovers that he has been cuckolded by Lola.<ref>Baxter, 1993. p. 124</ref>}}\n\nWhen Rath, in a jealous rage, enters the room where his wife, Lola, is making love to the cabaret strongman, Mazeppa, Sternberg declines to show us Rath \u2013 now a madman \u2013 at the moment he is violently subdued by the authorities and placed in a straitjacket. Sternberg rewards the degraded Professor Rath for having \"achieved a moment of masculine beauty [by] crowing like a maddened rooster\" at Lola's deception: \"Sternberg will not cheapen that moment by degrading a man who has been defeated.\" Sternberg presents \"the spectacle of a prudent, prudish man blocked off from all means of displaying his manhood except the most animalistic.\" The loss of Lola leaves Rath with but one alternative: death.<ref name=\"Sarris, 1966. p. 25\">Sarris, 1966. p. 25</ref><ref>Sarris, 1998. p. 221: \"Sternberg's profundity...is measured less by the breadth of this vision than by the perfection of his form and by the emotional force of his characters within that form.\"</ref><ref>Sarris, 1998. p. 221:\"...it is Lola's strength that she has lived with shabbiness long enough to know how to bend without breaking and the Professor's tragic misfortune to bend to first and still break after all.\"</ref>\n\n==Remakes, adaptations, and parodies==\n*''[[The Blue Angel (1959 film)|The Blue Angel]]'' (1959).
