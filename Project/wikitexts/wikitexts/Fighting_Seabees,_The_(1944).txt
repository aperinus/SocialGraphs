He clashes with his liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow ([[Dennis O'Keefe]]), over the fact that his men are not allowed to arm themselves against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].\n\nWhen the enemy lands in force on the island, Donovan\u2019s men want to help fight. Donovan initially tries to dissuade them, but after a Japanese fighter kills or wounds several workers, he changes his mind and leads his men into the fray. This prevents Yarrow from springing a carefully devised trap that would have wiped out the invaders in a murderous [[machine gun]] crossfire, with minimal American losses. Instead, many of Donovan's men are killed unnecessarily.\n\nAs a result of this tragedy, Yarrow finally convinces the US Navy to form Construction Battalions (CBs, or the more familiar \"Seabees\") with Donovan's assistance, despite their mutual romantic interest in war correspondent Constance Chesley ([[Susan Hayward]]). Donovan and many of his men enlist and receive formal military training.\n\nThe two men are teamed together on yet another island. The Japanese launch a major attack, which the Seabees barely manage to hold off, sometimes using heavy construction machinery such as [[bulldozer]]s and a clamshell bucket.\n\nWhen word reaches Donovan of another approaching enemy column, there are no sailors left to oppose this new threat. In desperation, he rigs a bulldozer with explosives on its blade, intending to ram it into a [[petroleum]] storage tank. The plan works, sending a cascade of burning liquid into the path of the Japanese, who retreat in panic, right into the sights of waiting machine guns.  However, Donovan is shot in the process and dies in the explosion.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[John Wayne]] as Lt.

The production took over virtually the entire 500-acre location ranch for a period of time in 1943, constructing extensive sets on both the Upper Iverson and the Lower Iverson. Palm trees were brought in to transform Iverson's rocky Western landscape into a version of the Pacific islands where the film's action was set.<ref>[http://iversonmovieranch.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-iverson-movie-ranch-under-attack.html \"Photos and details on production of 'The Fighting Seabees' on the Iverson Movie Ranch.\"] ''iversonmovieranch.blogspot.com'', 2019.

On other parts of the ranch, Quonset huts, observation towers, large fuel tanks and other props were built, with the construction process in many cases filmed and featured as part of the film. Graphic scenes depicting tank battles, sniper attacks and hand-to-hand combat were filmed in the Iverson Gorge, Garden of the Gods and other sections of the movie ranch, in one of the largest productions in the ranch's history.<ref>[http://iversonmovieranch.blogspot.com/ \"Iverson Movie Ranch: History, vintage photos.\"] ''iversonmovieranch.blogspot.com'', 2019.

Japanese atrocities including the [[Nanjing Massacre|Rape of Nanking]], the [[Bataan Death March]], and the [[kamikaze]] pilots were partly to blame for these attitudes, but other aspects such as the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] were also at work. As a result of these attitudes, anti-Japanese attitudes were common, including in films of the time.<ref name=Dower>{{cite book |last1=Dower |first1=John |author-link1=John W.

This review also drew attention to the fact that the 'Seabees' are less known to the public than most other branches of service, despite providing invaluable service: 'They are, quite literally, the \"men in front of the man behind the gun.\" They land in combat zones ahead of the troops, and prepare docks, landing fields, barracks, everything that the invading troops require.'<ref name=Rush>{{cite magazine| title=\"The Fighting Seabees\" Film of Little Known Service Branch | magazine=[[Rushville Republican]]|date=March 18, 1944 | page=2}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[John Wayne filmography]]\n*[[List of American films of 1944]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Evans, Alun.
