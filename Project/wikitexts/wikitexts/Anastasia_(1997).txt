Critics praised the animation, voice performances, and soundtrack, though it attracted criticism from some historians for its fantastical retelling of the Grand Duchess. ''Anastasia'' grossed $140 million worldwide, making it the most profitable film from Bluth and [[Fox Animation Studios]]. It received nominations for several awards, including for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[Journey to the Past]]\") and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] at the [[70th Academy Awards]].

The ball is suddenly interrupted by [[Grigori Rasputin]], a sorcerer and former royal advisor [[exile]]d for [[treason]], who vows to Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] that his family will be banished with a curse. Consumed by his hatred for the Romanovs, Rasputin [[Deal with the Devil|sells his soul]] in exchange for a power upgrade to his unholy [[reliquary]], which he uses to spark the [[Russian Revolution]]. As revolutionaries besiege the palace, Marie and Anastasia escape through a secret passageway, aided by 10-year-old servant boy Dimitri. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside on the frozen [[Little Nevka|Little Nevka River]], only to fall through the ice and drown. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but as Marie climbs aboard, Anastasia falls and hits her head on the platform, which knocks her unconscious and causes her to develop [[amnesia]].\n\nTen years later, Russia is under [[Soviet Union|communist rule]] and Marie publicly offers 10 million [[Soviet rouble|roubles]] for the safe return of her granddaughter. Now working as a [[conman]], a grown Dimitri and his partner-in-crime Vlad Vasilovich search for an Anastasia look-alike to bring to Paris so they can collect the reward. Elsewhere, an 18-year-old Anastasia (now called \"Anya\") leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up and begins a search for her family, with her necklace as the only clue she has to finding them. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names Pooka, Anya decides to head to Paris, inspired by the inscription on her necklace, but finds herself unable to leave the Soviet Union without an [[exit visa]]. An old woman advises her to see Dimitri at the abandoned palace. There, the two men are impressed by Anya's resemblance to the \"real\" Anastasia, and decide to take her with them to Paris, completely unaware of her identity.\n\nWatching the meeting from his perch, Rasputin's [[albino]] [[bat]] minion Bartok notices his master's dormant reliquary suddenly revived by Anya's presence. It drags him down to [[limbo]], where he finds an [[undead]] Rasputin confined. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped the curse, Rasputin sends his demonic minions from the reliquary to kill her. The demons sabotage the trio's train by overheating the engine and separating it and its ruined baggage car from the rest of the train as they leave Leningrad, but the trio manages to escape before the burning locomotive and baggage car fall through a broken bridge and explode on the ground below. Later, the demons try to lure Anya into [[sleepwalking]] off their ship bound for [[French Third Republic|France]]. The trio unwittingly foil both attempts, forcing Rasputin and Bartok to travel to the surface in order to kill Anya personally.\n\nDuring their journey, as Dimitri and Vladimir teach Anya court etiquette and her family's history, Dimitri and Anya begin to fall in love. The trio eventually reach Paris and go to see Marie, who has given up the search after meeting numerous [[Romanov impostors|impostors]]. Despite this, Marie's cousin Sophie quizzes Anya to confirm her identity. Though Anya gives  every answer taught to her, Dimitri finally realizes she is the real Anastasia when she (without being taught) vaguely recalls how he helped her escape the palace siege. Sophie, also convinced, arranges a meeting with Marie at the [[Palais Garnier]]. There, Dimitri tries to establish an introduction but Marie refuses, believing Anya will be another imposter and having already heard of Dimitri's initial scheme to con her. Anya overhears the conversation and angrily leaves. Dimitri later abducts Marie in her car to force her to see Anya, finally convincing her when he presents the music box Anastasia dropped during their escape. As Marie and Anya converse, Anya regains her memories before the two sing the lullaby the music box plays, a secret only the two of them knew. Marie recognizes Anya as Anastasia, and the two are joyfully reunited.\n\nMarie offers Dimitri the reward money the next day, recognizing him as the servant boy who saved them, but he declines it and leaves to return to the Soviet Union. At her return celebration, Anya is informed by her grandmother of Dimitri's gesture, leaving her torn between staying or going with him. Anya walks off to the [[Pont Alexandre III]], where Rasputin entraps  her. Dimitri returns to save Anya, but is attacked by a Black Pegasus statue enchanted by Rasputin. In the struggle, Anya manages to get hold of Rasputin's reliquary and crushes it under her foot, avenging her family as Rasputin's demons turn on and destroy him, thus ending the Romanov curse.\n\nAnya and Dimitri [[elope]], and Anya sends a farewell letter to Marie and Sophie promising to return one day, which Marie accepts, satisfied to have finally been reunited with her granddaughter.
