It is an adaptation of the 1982 [[off-Broadway]] [[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|musical of the same name]] by composer [[Alan Menken]] and writer [[Howard Ashman]], which is itself an adaptation of the 1960 film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'' by director [[Roger Corman]]. The film, which centers on a floral shop worker who discovers a sentient carnivorous plant that feeds on human blood, stars [[Rick Moranis]], [[Ellen Greene]], [[Vincent Gardenia]], [[Steve Martin]], and [[Levi Stubbs]]. The film also features [[cameo appearance|special appearances]] by [[Jim Belushi]], [[John Candy]], [[Christopher Guest]] and [[Bill Murray]]. It was produced by [[David Geffen]] through [[The Geffen Film Company|The Geffen Company]] and released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] on December 19, 1986.\n\n''Little Shop of Horrors'' was filmed on the [[007 stage|Albert R. Broccoli 007 Stage]] at the [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[England]], where a \"downtown\" set, complete with overhead train track, was constructed. Produced on a budget of $25 million, in contrast to the original 1960 film, which, according to Corman, only cost $30,000,<ref name=\"Corman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/rogercorman.html|title=Roger Corman interview|access-date=March 11, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104204843/http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/rogercorman.html|archive-date=January 4, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> it was well received by critics and audiences alike, eventually developing a [[cult following]]. The film's original 23-minute finale, based on the musical's ending, was rewritten and reshot after test audiences did not react positively to it.<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\"/> For years only available as black-and-white [[workprint]] footage, the original ending was fully restored in 2012 by [[Warner Home Video]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn the early 1960s, a three-girl \"[[Greek chorus]]\" \u2014 Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon \u2014 introduce the film, warning the audience that some horror is coming their way (\"Prologue: Little Shop of Horrors\"). Seymour Krelborn and his colleague, Audrey, work at Mushnik's Flower Shop in a run-down, rough neighborhood in [[New York City]] referred to as \"[[Skid row#New York|Skid Row]]\". They lament that they cannot escape the neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). Struggling from a lack of customers, Mr. Mushnik decides to close the store, but Audrey suggests he may have more success by displaying an unusual plant that Seymour owns. Immediately attracting a customer, Seymour explains he bought the plant \u2014 which he dubbed \"Audrey II\" \u2014 from a Chinese flower shop during a [[solar eclipse]] (\"Da-Doo\"). The plant brings much business to Mushnik's shop, but soon starts to wither. Seymour accidentally pricks his finger, and discovers that Audrey II needs human blood to thrive (\"Grow for Me\").\n\nAudrey II begins to grow rapidly and Seymour becomes a local celebrity. Meanwhile, Audrey suffers at the hands of her sadistic boyfriend, Orin Scrivello; however, she has feelings for Seymour and secretly dreams of running off with him to the suburbs (\"Somewhere That's Green\"). Seymour continues to feed Audrey II his own blood, draining his energy (\"Some Fun Now\"). Seymour soon attempts to ask Audrey out, but she turns him down because she has a date with Orin, who is revealed to be a dentist (\"Dentist!\"). After Seymour closes up shop, Audrey II begins to talk to Seymour, demanding more blood than Seymour can give. The plant proposes that Seymour murder someone in exchange for fame and fortune, as well as the ability to woo Audrey; Seymour initially refuses, but eventually agrees after witnessing Orin abusing Audrey (\"Feed Me (Git It!)\").\n\nAfter Orin finishes with his masochistic patient, Arthur Denton, who had requested \"a long, slow, root canal\", Seymour draws a revolver on Orin, but cannot bring himself to use it. Orin, who abuses nitrous oxide, puts on a type of [[venturi mask]] to receive a constant flow of the gas, but breaks the valve, and Seymour watches as he asphyxiates. Seymour dismembers Orin's body and feeds it to Audrey II, which has grown to enormous size, but is unknowingly witnessed by Mushnik, who flees in fear.\n\nAudrey, feeling guilty over Orin's disappearance, is comforted by Seymour and the two admit their feelings for each other (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). That night, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death and holds Seymour at gunpoint, blackmailing him into turning the plant over and leaving town. With no choice, Seymour begins to tell him how to care for Audrey II but before he can reveal the secret, the plant swallows Mushnik whole (\"Suppertime\").\n\nDespite widespread success, Seymour worries about Audrey II's growth and unbridled appetite. Offered money and a contract for a botany TV show, Seymour becomes overwhelmed and decides to escape Skid Row with Audrey using money coming the next day, and leaving the plant to starve. After Audrey accepts Seymour's marriage proposal, Audrey II catches Seymour leaving and demands another meal: Seymour agrees, but insists on meat from a butcher. While Seymour is gone, the plant telephones Audrey, coaxes her into the shop, and then tries to eat her (\"Suppertime II\").\n\nSeymour, returning in time to save Audrey, escapes the store with her. Explaining that he fed the plant to become successful and win Audrey's heart, Seymour discovers she has always loved him (\"Suddenly, Seymour\" (reprise)). Approached by an executive named Patrick Martin from a botanical company, Seymour is offered a contract to breed Audrey II and sell the saplings worldwide. Horrified by the idea, Seymour drives Martin away and realizes he must destroy Audrey II for the sake of humanity.\n\nReturning to the shop, Seymour learns that Audrey II is actually an alien from outer space (\"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\"). Audrey II traps Seymour and destroys the shop. Seymour grabs an exposed electrical cable in the rubble and electrocutes Audrey II, resulting in an explosion. Leaving the destroyed shop, Seymour safely reunites with Audrey. The two wed and move to the suburbs. As they arrive at their new home, a smiling Audrey II bud can be seen among the flowers in their front yard.\n\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot section describes the events of the original general release.

Originally [[Steven Spielberg]] was attached to serve as an [[Executive producer]] with [[Martin Scorsese]] attached to direct the film, which he wanted to shoot in 3D, but production was stalled when a lawsuit was filed by the original film's screenwriter and actor, [[Charles B. Griffith]].<ref>Cinefantastique, Volume 14, No 2 (December 1983/January 1984), \"Little Shop of Horrors: Corman's now-classic B-Film ends up on stage - and in court\" by Dennis Fischer</ref> {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} [[John Landis]] was also attached to the project for a time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Howard Ashman |url=http://howardashman.com/blog/great-little-shop-interview-with-howard/ |access-date=2017-04-11 |date=1984 |publisher=Unknown Baltimore Publication |archive-date=April 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412062219/http://howardashman.com/blog/great-little-shop-interview-with-howard/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nGeffen then offered the film to [[Frank Oz]], who was finishing work on ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' around the same time. Oz initially rejected it, but later had an idea that interested him in the cinematic aspect of the project. Oz spent a month and a half restructuring the script which he felt was stage-bound. Geffen and Ashman liked what he had written and decided to run with it. Oz was also studying the Off-Broadway show and how it was thematically constructed, in order to reconstruct it for a feature film.<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\">{{cite magazine |title=Frank Oz: Muppets maestro discusses 'Little Shop of Horrors' and the remaking of his classics |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2012/05/15/frank-oz-little-shop-of-horrors |access-date=2016-05-30 |date=May 15, 2012 |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |archive-date=June 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606051144/https://ew.com/article/2012/05/15/frank-oz-little-shop-of-horrors/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film differs only slightly from the stage play. The title song is expanded to include an additional verse to allow for the opening credits.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The song \"Ya Never Know\" was rewritten into a [[Calypso music|calypso]]-inspired song called \"Some Fun Now\", although some of the lyrics were retained.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Four other songs (\"Closed for Renovation\", \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now <nowiki>[</nowiki>It's Just the Gas<nowiki>]</nowiki>\", as well as \"Call Back in the Morning\") were cut from the original production score, and \u201cFinale (Don\u2019t Feed the Plants)\u201d does not appear in the theatrical version of the film. A new song, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was written by Ashman and Menken for the film.\n\n===Casting===\nGreene was not the first choice for the role of Audrey. The studio wanted [[Cyndi Lauper]], who turned it down. [[Barbra Streisand]] was also rumored to have been offered the part. Since Greene was the original off-Broadway Audrey, the role was given to her. \"She's amazing,\" Oz said. \"I couldn't imagine any other Audrey, really. She nailed that part for years off-Broadway.\"<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\"/> The character of the masochistic dental patient (who in Corman's original film was named Wilbur Force and played by [[Jack Nicholson]]) was cut from the stage version but added back to the new film, renamed Arthur Denton, and played by [[Bill Murray]], who improvised all of his dialogue. It supposedly took Steve Martin six weeks to film all his scenes as Orin. He contributed ideas such as socking the nurse in the face (originally he was to knock her out using his motorbike helmet) and ripping off the doll head.\n\n===Filming===\nAll the scenes were filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England, making use of every sound stage there, including the [[007 Stage]]. Oz and his crew did not want to shoot on location as it would tamper with the fantastical mood of the film. Part of the giant 007 stage was used to film the \"Suddenly Seymour\" number. But because of its size, the stage was impractical to heat properly and thus caused [[Exhaled breath condensate|breath condensation]] to appear from the actor's lips. This was countered by having Ellen Greene and Rick Moranis put ice cubes in their mouths.\n\nThis would be the first time Moranis and Steve Martin starred in a film together, and they would later appear together in three more films: ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'', ''[[My Blue Heaven (1990 film)|My Blue Heaven]]'' and ''[[L.A. Story]]''.\n\nAs mentioned, additional sequences and songs from the original off-Broadway show were dropped or re-written in order for the feature version to be paced well. The notable change was for the \"Meek Shall Inherit\" sequence. As originally filmed, it detailed through a dream sequence Seymour's rising success and the need to keep the plant fed and impress Audrey. In the final cut, the dream sequence and much of the song is cut out. Oz said, \"I cut that because I felt it just didn't work and that was before the first preview in San Jose. It was the right choice, it didn't really add value to the entire cut.\"<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\"/> The full version of the song was included on the film's soundtrack album, as were the songs from the original ending. The sequence was deemed to be lost until in 2012 when it was rediscovered on a VHS workprint that contained alternate and extended takes and sequences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://justinhoskie.tumblr.com/post/39252129410/little-shop-deleted-scenes-found |title=Little Shop - Deleted Scenes FOUND |publisher=Justn Hoskie |access-date=2013-08-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812062804/http://justinhoskie.tumblr.com/post/39252129410/little-shop-deleted-scenes-found |archive-date=August 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Operating the plant===\nThe film's version of Audrey II was an elaborate creation, using [[puppet]]s designed by Lyle Conway, who had previously worked with Oz on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'', and ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]''. The animatronic and fabrication team consisted of many of the same people who had worked on the creatures in ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]''.\n\nWhile developing the mouth of the plant for the dialogue scenes and musical numbers, Oz, Conway and his crew struggled to figure out how to make the plant move convincingly. \"We kept trying and trying and it didn't work.\"<ref name=\"commentary\" /> The solution presented itself while reviewing test footage of the puppet. When the film ran backwards or forward at a faster than normal speed, the footage looked more convincing and lifelike. They realized they could film the puppet at a slower speed, making it appear to move faster when played back at normal speed. \"By slowing it down it looked it was talking real fast. We then went 'holy cow, look at that. We can do it.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"commentary\" /> The frame rate for filming the plant was slowed to 12 or 16 frames per second, depending on the scene, and frequent screen cuts were used to minimize the amount of screen time the puppet spent with human actors; when interaction was necessary, the actors (usually Moranis) would pantomime and [[lip sync]] in slow motion.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> The film was then sped up to the normal 24 frames per second and voices were reinserted in post-production. Levi Stubbs' recordings were [[pitch shifting|pitch-shifted]] through a [[Eventide, Inc#H910 Harmonizer|Harmonizer]] when slowed down so that they were coherent for Moranis or Ellen Greene.\n\nThere are no [[Chroma key|blue screen]]s or [[Compositing|opticals]] involved in any of Audrey II's scenes, with the exception of the reshot ending where the plant is electrocuted, designed by Visual Effects supervisor Bran Ferren, and in some shots during the rampage in the original ending. The plant was made in six different stages of growth and there were three different versions of Mushnik's shop, making it possible for two units to work with different sized plants at the same time. Each of the talking plants had to be cleaned, re-painted and patched up at the end of each shooting day, which would take up to three hours depending on the size.  The \"Suppertime\" number uses two different sizes of Audrey II. When \"Twoey\" is singing all alone in the shop, it is actually a smaller size: the same size as when it sang \"Feed Me\", but now standing on a scaled down set to make it appear larger. The full size one that is seen to interact with Seymour and Mushnik was not provided with lip movement, but was built to swallow Mushnik's (mechanical) legs. Performing the plant in its largest form required around 60 puppeteers, many of whom had worked with director Frank Oz on previous projects, including ''The Dark Crystal'', ''Labyrinth'', and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', and would go on to puppeteer in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]''.<ref name=\"Reelviews\">[[James Berardinelli]].

However, after audiences at the preview screenings did not react positively to it, the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot for the theatrical release with a happier ending.<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\"/>\n\nIn the cut ending, the plant attacks Audrey and reveals that it also ate Orin and Mr. Mushnik. Seymour pulls her from its jaws but is too late, as she is mortally wounded. Seymour confesses that he fed Orin and Mushnik to the plant. Audrey asks Seymour to feed her to the plant too, so Seymour can earn the success he deserves, and, in a way, she'll always be with him (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). After fulfilling her dying wish, he attempts suicide by jumping off the roof of a building, only to be stopped by Patrick Martin. Martin offers to propagate and sell Audrey IIs, saying he has already grown an Audrey II from a [[Cutting (plant)|cutting]] he harvested earlier. Realizing Audrey II is planning global conquest, Seymour resolves to destroy the plant. Martin shouts that his permission is not needed, as plants are in the public domain.  Seymour tries to kill Audrey II, who tears down the shop, fishes him from the rubble and eats him alive (\u201cMean Green Mother from Outer Space\u201d). The plant spits out Seymour's glasses and laughs victoriously.\n\nThe three chorus girls appear in front of an American flag and tell how Audrey II buds became a worldwide craze, and grew into an army of monstrous plants that began to take over the Earth.<ref name=\"DVD Savant\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s92shop.html |title=Little Shop of Reshoots |access-date=2007-03-11 |date=November 20, 1999 |publisher=DVD Savant |archive-date=February 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214211712/https://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s92shop.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Giant Audrey II plants are shown toppling buildings and destroying cities, as well as eating people.

The model department was supervised by Richard Conway, known for his model work on ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' and ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]''. \"It was all model stuff, that was the brilliant thing. He created the bridge, the buildings, several Audrey IIs and created all of it, all on tabletop. It's all old-fashioned, tabletop animation\"<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\"/> (although no stop motion animation was used in the film or in the ending). The Visual Effects work was supervised by [[Bran Ferren]] (''[[Altered States]]'').\n\nReportedly the entire planned climax cost about $5 million to produce, and included elaborate special and visual effects. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Oz said in an interview, \"this was, I think, the most expensive film Warner Bros. had done at the time.\"<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\"/> As the film was nearing completion, the excited studio set up a test screening in San Jose. Oz said, \"For every musical number, there was applause, they loved it, it was just fantastic...  until Rick and Ellen died, and then the theatre became a refrigerator, an ice box. It was awful and the cards were just awful. You have to have a 55 percent \"recommend\" to really be released and we got a 13. It was a complete disaster.\" Oz insisted on setting another test screening in L.A. to see if they would get a different reaction. Geffen agreed to this, but they received the same negative reaction as before.<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly\"/> Oz later recounted, \"I learned a lesson: in a stage play, you kill the leads and they come out for a bow\u2014in a movie, they don't come out for a bow, they're dead.

The musical number \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\" was left mostly intact from the original cut, with new shots of Audrey observing from a window added in. A brief sequence from the \"Mean Green Mother\" number was also removed in which Seymour fires his revolver at Audrey II, only to discover that the bullets ricochet harmlessly off of the plant. In the happy ending, Audrey II is destroyed and Seymour, Audrey, and humanity survive. This happy ending is made somewhat ambiguous, however, with a final shot of a smiling Audrey II bud in Seymour and Audrey's front yard. [[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]] was unavailable for the final appearance of the chorus girls in the yard and was replaced with a lookalike seen only from the waist down.<ref name=\"commentary\"/>\n\n\"We had to do it,\" Oz recounted. \"[and do it] in such a manner that the audience would enjoy the movie.
