They happily exchange vows and are married. During the reception, [[Jacob Black]], who had left town upon receiving an invitation to the wedding, returns. Bella is pleasantly surprised to see him, and they share a dance in the woods. Bella admits that she and Edward plan to [[Consummation|consummate]] their marriage on their honeymoon while she is still human. Jacob becomes furious, knowing that such an act could kill her.\n\nAfter the wedding, Bella and Edward traveled to Isle Esme for their honeymoon, and they made love for the first time. Two weeks after the wedding, Bella vomited after waking and notices her [[Menstruation|period]] is late. [[List of Twilight characters#Carlisle Cullen|Carlisle]], Edward's adoptive father, is told by Bella she believes she is pregnant. Edward is distraught, as it is highly unlikely a human will survive giving birth to a vampire's baby.\n\nEdward tells Bella Carlisle should perform an abortion; she refused, and convinced Edward's sister, [[List of Twilight characters#Rosalie Hale|Rosalie]], to be her bodyguard. They fly back home to Forks, Washington. Jacob rushes to the Cullens' house and finds Bella pale, underweight, and visibly pregnant. He is upset by Bella's failing health, saying Carlisle should terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible to save her life. Bella opts to continue her pregnancy.\n\nJacob storms out of the Cullens' residence, shapeshifted, and arranged a meeting in the woods with his packmates regarding Bella's pregnancy. Sam believes the baby will not be able to control its craving for human blood once it is born. He thinks they should kill Bella to ensure that her unborn child does not harm anyone. Jacob does not want any harm to come to Bella because he still has feelings for her and she has done nothing wrong. Sam believes if they do not kill Bella, her unborn child will. Disagreement over this issue causes Jacob and a few other wolves to [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] from Sam's pack to form their own.\n\nAs Bella's pregnancy progresses, her health declines rapidly. However, a snide comment from Jacob makes her realize the baby is craving blood. When she begins drinking human blood obtained by Carlisle from the hospital, her health improves. Bella's pregnancy continues to progress at an alarming rate; as a half-vampire, the fetus's development is far more accelerated than that of a human fetus. Edward's dislike for the baby dissolves as he notices he can read the baby's thoughts.\n\nBella is sharing her ideas about baby names with Edward and Jacob when she collapses. Edward, Jacob, and Rosalie begin performing an emergency [[Caesarean section|cesarean section]], as Carlisle is out obtaining blood. The procedure is excruciatingly painful for Bella, and she falls unconscious. Following the procedure, Bella wakes up and sees her healthy newborn daughter. After she chooses Renesmee (a combination of her mother's name and Edward's mother's name) as the baby's name, Bella's heart stops.\n\nJacob desperately attempts CPR. Edward injects Bella's heart with his venom in an attempt to transform her into a vampire, but his action appears to be futile as Bella remains lifeless. Panicked, Edward begins chest compressions. A distraught Jacob decides to kill Renesmee, as he believes she was the cause of Bella's death; however, when they look into each other's eyes, he imprints on her. The imprint prevents the werewolves from [[Infanticide|killing Renesmee]], as their most absolute law is not to harm anyone who has been imprinted on.\n\nBella is cleaned and dressed. Over the course of two days, her injuries heal and her figure returns to normal. Finally, the transformation is complete; her eyes open, and they are blood-red. Bella has become a vampire.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the Volturi's secretary, Bianca, delivers a message from Carlisle. Aro reads the message, which basically states about Bella and Edward's wedding and Bella's transformation into a vampire. Aro has Bianca killed by Demetri and Felix for spelling Carlisle's name without an 's'. The two other Volturi banter about how Carlisle is growing his coven and that the Volturis' dispute with the Cullens is over. However, Aro disagrees, saying they still have something he wants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Twilight cast members}}\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as [[Bella Cullen]] (nee \u2018Swan\u2019), Edward's wife, Jacob's best friend and Renesmee\u2019s mother.

''Part 2'' will follow her transformation, the \"first exhilarating moments\" of her vampire life<ref name=\"Meyer\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-03-31-meyer31_CV_N.htm|title='Twilight' fans are on Team Meyer|work=USA Today|date=March 30, 2011|access-date=July 31, 2011|first=Carol|last=Memmott}}</ref> and the final confrontation with the [[List of Twilight characters|Volturi]]. Godfrey also confirmed that ''Part 1'' will follow the book's storyline as it breaks away from Bella and switches into [[Jacob Black|Jacob]]'s perspective. \"There is a sense that as Bella and the Cullens (Edward's makeshift vampire clan) deal with her pregnancy, the world is still turning outside with Jacob\", he explains.<ref name=\"Godfrey\"/> However, in March 2011, Meyer said in interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' that ''Part 1'' will end when Bella opens her eyes as a vampire.<ref name=\"Meyer\"/>\n\nBy August, Rosenberg said that the scripts for ''Part 1'' and ''2'' were 75 to 85 percent completed. She found the greatest challenge in writing the scripts to be the final sequence of ''Part 2'': \"The final battle sequence is a big challenge because it lasts 25 pages\", she said. \"It's almost an entire three-act story in and of itself. You have to track [keep it all in one setting] hundreds of characters. It's an enormous challenge to choreograph on the page and for Bill [Condon] to choreograph on the stage.\" She had written various drafts of the scene but, at that, hadn't revised or discussed them with Condon yet. She said, \"That's the next big hurdle to sit down with the stunt coordinator and create the ballet. It's a lot of work. I'm exhausted, but we're intent on making them the best scripts yet.\" Godfrey called ''Part 2'' \"an action film in terms of life-and-death stakes\" and said that in ''Part 1'' \"there are the pangs of newlywed tension that occur that are relatable even in a fantasy film. Marriage is not quite the experience that they thought it was.\" Condon thought of ''Part 1'' \"as a real companion piece to [[Twilight (2008 film)|Catherine Hardwicke's movie]]\". Condon explains, \"Like, everything that got set up there gets resolved here. I think you'll find that there are stylistic and other nods to that film.\"\n\nGodfrey considered releasing the second film in [[3-D film|3D]] to differentiate between the time before and after Bella becomes a vampire,<ref name=\"Yamato\" /> an idea originally proposed for ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse|Eclipse]]'', but said that the decision is up to Condon. However, he said that if the second film were to be released in 3D, he would like to shoot it with the proper equipment in \"real\" 3D as was done with ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), not convert it into 3D in post-production as was done with ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://collider.com/twilight-producer-wyck-godfrey-interview-the-twilight-saga-eclipse-breaking-dawn-ultimate-twilight-dvd-blu-ray-box-set/35096/\u20a0|title=Exclusive: Producer Wyck Godfrey on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, Breaking Dawn, Other Projects, Ultimate Twilight DVD Box Set|publisher=Collider|date=July 1, 2010|access-date=July 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nIn order to keep the budget on both parts of ''Breaking Dawn'' reasonable, even though it is substantially greater than the previous installments in the series, much of the film was shot in and around [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and Celtic Studios in Baton Rouge.

Shots included creating the belly of a pregnant Bella, removing a wrist brace Stewart was wearing in the wedding scene due to an injury, and a variety of subtle cosmetic refinements. Bella's pregnancy was a challenge for Modus; the production team wanted the baby to kick and move around inside her belly, so the artists and cinematographer had to match the camera moves, the lighting, even the [[film grain]], along with the subtleties of Stewart's skin.<ref name=\"FX\"/> On the subject, CG supervisor Martin Pelletier said,\n\n{{blockquote|For this project, we had to be really quick in terms of turn around. We made use of very complex lighting from the set, adding [[3D computer graphics|3D]] layers, and a [[Match moving|matchmove]] of her stomach, to make her look pregnant. We took our time at the start to get the recipe right and that paid off in efficiency once we got going. We were soon able to turn around several shots each day.<ref name=\"FX\"/>}}\n\nDuring the wedding scene, the camera pans around Pattinson and Stewart. Due to a minor wrist injury Stewart had, she was wearing a brace on the day of the shoot. Therefore, Modus was required to create a CG model of the hand and then carefully craft a rig to create natural motions. Once that was finished, every minute movement of the hand had to be matched exactly.<ref name=\"FX\"/> The rotational panning shot totals 300 frames and called for elaborate camera and object tracking.
