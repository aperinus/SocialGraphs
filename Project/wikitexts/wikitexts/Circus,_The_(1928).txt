The film stars Chaplin, [[Al Ernest Garcia]], [[Merna Kennedy]], [[Harry Crocker]], [[George Davis (actor)|George Davis]] and [[Henry Bergman]]. The [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] of an impoverished circus hires Chaplin's [[The Tramp|Little Tramp]] as a clown, but discovers that he can only be funny unintentionally.\n\nThe production of the film was the most difficult experience in Chaplin's career.  Numerous problems and delays occurred, including a studio fire, the death of Chaplin's mother, as well as Chaplin's bitter divorce from his second wife [[Lita Grey]], and the [[Internal Revenue Service]]'s claims of Chaplin's owed back taxes, all of which culminated in filming being stalled for eight months.<ref name=\"DVDJ\">{{cite web|last=Bourne|first=Mark|year=2004|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/c/circus.shtml|title=The Circus: The Chaplin Collection|work=Reviews|publisher=The DVD Journal|access-date=October 29, 2010}}</ref> ''The Circus'' was the seventh-highest grossing silent film in cinema history taking in more than $3.8 million in 1928.<ref name=Variety/> The film continues to receive high praise.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a circus [[Midway (fair)|midway]], the penniless and hungry Tramp (Chaplin) is mistaken for a condemnable pickpocket and chased by both the police and the real crook (the latter having stashed a stolen wallet and watch in the Tramp's pocket to avoid detection). Running away, the Tramp stumbles into the middle of a performance and unknowingly becomes the hit of the show.\n\nThe ringmaster/proprietor of the struggling circus gives him a tryout the next day, but the Tramp fails miserably. However, when the property men quit because they have not been paid, he gets hired on the spot to take their place. Once again, he inadvertently creates comic mayhem during a show. The ringmaster craftily hires him as a poorly paid property man who is always stationed in the performance area of the big top tent so he can unknowingly improvise comic material.\n\nThe Tramp befriends Merna (Kennedy), a horse rider who is treated badly by her ringmaster stepfather. She later informs the Tramp that he is the star of the show, forcing the ringmaster to pay him accordingly. With the circus thriving because of him, the Tramp also is able to secure better treatment for Merna.\n\nAfter overhearing a [[Fortune telling|fortune teller]] inform Merna that she sees \"love and marriage with a dark, handsome man who is near you now\", the overjoyed Tramp buys a ring from another clown. Alas for him, she meets Rex (Crocker), the newly hired [[Tightrope walking|tightrope walker]]. The Tramp eavesdrops as she rushes to tell the fortune teller that she has fallen in love with the new man. With his heart broken, the Tramp is unable to entertain the crowds. After several poor performances, the ringmaster warns him he has only one more chance.\n\nWhen Rex cannot be found for a performance, the ringmaster (knowing that the Tramp has been practicing the tightrope act in hopes of supplanting his rival) sends the Tramp out in his place. Despite a few mishaps, including several mischievous escaped monkeys, he manages to survive the experience and receives much applause from the audience. However, when he sees the ringmaster slapping Merna around afterward, he beats the man and is fired.\n\nMerna runs away to join him. The Tramp finds and brings Rex back with him to marry Merna. The trio goes back to the circus. The ringmaster starts berating his stepdaughter, but stops when Rex informs him that she is his wife. When the traveling circus leaves, the Tramp remains behind: he prefers to fade to allow them to be happy. Melancholic, he picks himself up and starts walking jauntily away.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- These are the role designations as shown in the credits, with the exception of the last, where TRAMP is fully capitalized !-->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Charlie Chaplin]] as [[The Tramp]]\n* [[Al Ernest Garcia]] as the Circus Proprietor and Ringmaster\n* [[Merna Kennedy]] as the Ringmaster's Step-daughter, a Circus Rider\n* [[Harry Crocker]] as Rex, a Tight Rope Walker (also a disgruntled property man and a clown)\n* [[George Davis (actor)|George Davis]] as a Magician\n* [[Henry Bergman]] as an old Clown\n* [[Tiny Sandford]] as the Head Property Man (as Stanley J.

But by the end of the movie, the circus is packing up and moving on without him. Chaplin's left alone in the empty circus ring... It reminds me of Chaplin and his place in the world of the cinema. The show is moving on without him. He filmed that sequence four days after the release of ''The Jazz Singer'' (the first successful talkie) in New York. When he put a score to ''The Circus'' in 1928, Chaplin scored that sequence with \"[[Blue Skies (1926 song)|Blue Skies]]\", the song Jolson had made famous, only Chaplin played it slowly and sorrowfully, like a funeral dirge.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Weddle|first=David|date=April 28, 2003|title=Nothing Obvious or Easy: Chaplin's Feature Films|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|volume=390|issue=11|issn=0042-2738|page=6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his commentary track for the Criterion Collection home video release of the film, Jeffrey Vance notes: \n<blockquote>\nChaplin\u2014a great cinema auteur\u2014revealed his innermost feelings through his films. In The Circus, he fashioned a scenario that places The Tramp within the confines of a circus and, in so doing, documents, celebrates, and memorializes his own position as the greatest clown of his time. And, that accomplishment\u2014beyond the wonderful comedy\u2014ranks The Circus a major Chaplin film of considerable importance.<ref name=\"The Circus\">{{cite web |title=The Circus |url=https://www.criterion.com/films/27563-the-circus |website=Criterion}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Musical rescoring==\nIn 1947, [[Hanns Eisler]] worked on music for the film. Eisler then used the music he composed for his ''Septet No. 2 (\"Circus\")'' for flute and piccolo, clarinet in B flat, bassoon, and string quartet.
