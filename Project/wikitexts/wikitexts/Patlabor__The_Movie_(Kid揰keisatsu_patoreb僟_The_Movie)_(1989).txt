It was produced by [[Bandai Visual]], [[Tohokushinsha]] and animated by [[Studio Deen]] and [[Production I.G|I.G. Tatsunoko]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.production-ig.com/contents/works_sp/26_/s03_/index.html | title= Patlabor 1: The Movie> STAFF & CAST | publisher=Production I.G | access-date=2014-03-01}}</ref> It is part of the [[Patlabor|''Patlabor'' series]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in 1999, [[Tokyo]] is undergoing a huge re-development program: old suburbs are being demolished and human-made islands are being constructed in [[Tokyo Bay]] under the Babylon Project. Dominating the scene is the Ark, a huge man-made island that serves at the Project's nerve center and chief Labor{{efn|Labor: Film's term for a [[mech]]}} manufacturing facility.\n\nHowever, several of the Labors being used in Tokyo, specifically those built by Shinohara Heavy Industries, suddenly go haywire even while unattended. The [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]]'s (TMPD) 2nd Special Vehicles Section (SV2) is assigned to help reel in the errant Labors, but only the SV2's Division II is on duty around the clock (with Division I already on training duties elsewhere). The [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force|JGSDF]] is also preoccupied as they send their own forces to stop an HOS-equipped TYPE-X10<ref>0:03:46</ref> Labor tank prototype.\n\nAs Division II goes out on the field, team commander Captain Gotoh, Sgt Asuma Shinohara, and mechanic Shige Shiba work with police Detective Matsui to find further leads on the case. They discover that all the errant Labors, plus other Labors in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]], were equipped with the company's new Hyper Operating System (HOS). [[Low-frequency radio range|Low-frequency]] resonance emanating from wind-struck high-rise buildings triggers the erratic behavior in these units. To SV2 pilot Noa Izumi's relief, no copies of the software were installed in Division II's AV98 Ingram police Labors. They also learn that HOS programmer Eiichi Hoba, who had committed suicide days before, was obsessed with the Babylon Project's Biblical references (the Ark being alluded to [[Noah's Ark]], for example; his own name. E. Hoba\u2014[[Jehovah]]\u2014for another) and planted a self replicating virus in the code that would cause Labors to malfunction. A computer simulation predicts that gale-force winds acting on the Ark could send all the Labors in Tokyo into a massive rampage, especially since the Ark's size and steel framework amplifies the resonance frequencies causing them to reach farther into the city. Worse, the weather bureau announces that a typhoon is expected to hit Tokyo within two days.\n\nGotoh discreetly gets clearance from the TMPD leadership to destroy the Ark as Shige tries to dig up more evidence of Hoba's guilt to justify the operation. Kanuka Clancy returns from the US to help in the raid. Division II attaches flotation bags to their vehicles and head out to the Ark. Malfunctioning HOS-equipped Labors engage the team as soon as they land on the Ark. Ingram pilots Noa and Ohta, plus Kanuka in a hijacked AV-X0 TYPE-0<ref>1:22:32</ref> police Labor prototype, buys time for Hiromi, Asuma and Shinshi to break into the control room and activate the Ark's self-destruct sequence. However, Kanuka loses control over the TYPE-0 in the chaos because it runs on HOS as well. Trapped by the TYPE-0 in one of the last remaining ledges, Noa climbs out of her damaged Ingram and fires her shotgun into the Labor\u2019s [[S-RAM]]<ref>1:32:20</ref> system to finally shut it down. With the successful destruction of the Ark, SV2 sends helicopters to rescue the team.\n\n==Development==\nThe Biblical references in the movie were due to Oshii being inspired by Noa's name's similarity to [[Noah]], and he reused some concepts from his cancelled ''[[Lupin the Third]]'' movie as a result, with the ark being the equivalent of the cancelled film's tower of Babel. The plotline involving the architect and mastermind having committed suicide before the start of the story was also taken from the cancelled film. Oshii also wanted to reuse part of the cancelled film's ending, but was stopped by other staff members such as Izubuchi. He would later go on to use that ending for the live action film ''[[The Next Generation: Patlabor|THE NEXT GENERATION Patlabor: Shuto Kessen]]''.<ref>\u6587 \u62bc\u4e95\u5b88\u3001\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8 \u5929\u91ce\u559c\u5b5d\u300c\u6620\u753b\u300e\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16\u300f\u5236\u4f5c\u304a\u307c\u3048\u304c\u304d\u300d\u300e\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5\u300f1984\u5e7412\u6708\u53f7\u3001pp.38-39</ref><ref>\u300c\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u62bc\u4e95\u5b88 \u5e7b\u306e\u62bc\u4e95\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u306f\u300e\u865a\u69cb\u3092\u76d7\u3080\u300f\u306f\u305a\u3060\u3063\u305f\u300d\u300eTHE\u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16FILES \u30eb\u30d1\u30f3\u4e09\u4e16\u5168\u8a18\u9332 \u301c\u5897\u88dc\u6539\u8a02\u7248\u301c\u300f\u30ad\u30cd\u30de\u65ec\u5831\u793e\u30011998\u5e74\u3001p.36</ref><ref>\u62bc\u4e95\u5b88\u300e\u30a4\u30ce\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\u5275\u4f5c\u30ce\u30fc\u30c8 \u4eba\u5f62\u30fb\u5efa\u7bc9\u30fb\u8eab\u4f53\u306e\u65c5+\u5bfe\u8ac7\u300f\u5fb3\u9593\u66f8\u5e97\u30012004\u5e74\u3001p.73</ref><ref>\u300eBS\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u591c\u8a71Vol.03 \u6a5f\u52d5\u8b66\u5bdf\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u300f\u30ad\u30cd\u30de\u65ec\u5831\u793e\u30012006\u5e74\u3001p.75</ref><ref>\u300c\u795e\u5c71\u5065\u6cbb\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30a6\u300d\u300eS-F\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3\u300f2012\u5e7412\u6708\u53f7\u3001pp.6\u3001190</ref>\n\n==Voice actors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Japanese<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Patlabor: The Movie|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Patlabor-the-Movie/|access-date=2020-07-06|website=Behind The Voice Actors|language=en-US}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\" | English<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n!Manga UK\n!Bandai Visual\n|-\n!Asuma Shinohara \n| [[Toshio Furukawa]]\n| David Jarvis\n| [[Doug Erholtz]]\n|-\n!Noa Izumi\n| [[Miina Tominaga]]\n| Briony Glassico\n| [[Julie Ann Taylor]]\n|-\n!Kiichi Goto\n| [[Ryunosuke Ohbayashi]]\n| Peter Marinker\n| [[Roger Craig Smith]]\n|-\n!Shinobu Nagumo\n| [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]]\n| Sharon Holm\n| [[Megan Hollingshead]]\n|-\n!Kanuka Clancy \n| [[Y\u014d Inoue]]\n| Tamsin Hollo\n| Lisa Enochs\n|-\n!Isao Ohta \n| [[Michihiro Ikemizu]]\n| Martin McDougall\n| [[Sam Riegel]]\n|-\n!Mikiyasu Shinshi \n| [[Issei Futamata]]\n| Ron Lepaz\n| [[Joe Ochman]]\n|-\n!Hiromi Yamazaki \n| [[Daisuke Gouri]]\n| Michael Fitzpatrick\n| [[Jason C.

The third release, which the latest R1s from [[Bandai Visual]] use, features remastered anamorphic letterbox video and 5.1 sound. The US release features a new English dub produced by Bandai Visual. The Australian [[Madman Entertainment|Madman]]/[[Manga Entertainment|Manga UK]] R4 release uses the Australian Manga VHS master, and includes remixed 5.1 Manga UK dub and the original 2.0 Japanese dub. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.
