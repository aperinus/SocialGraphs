The film stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[William Baldwin]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Rebecca De Mornay]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Jason Gedrick]], and [[J. T. Walsh]], and follows [[Chicago]] firefighters on the trail of a serial [[arson]]ist. Filming in [[Chicago]] began on July 23, 1990, and was wrapped up on December 8, 1990. Before the filming started, the main actors went out on calls with real Chicago firefighters. All of the main actors also went to the Chicago Fire Academy to learn how to be like the firefighters in the film.\n\nThe film was released on May 24, 1991 to favorable reviews from critics, and grossed $152.4 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\" /><ref>{{cite web | title=Fire/Firefighter Movies at the Box Office | url=https://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=fire.htm | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | access-date=2012-07-08 | archive-date=2012-08-01 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801210344/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=fire.htm | url-status=dead }}</ref> The film received three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations - [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] - but lost all of these to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. The film also inspired a [[Backdraft (attraction)|special effects attraction]] at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], which opened in 1992 and closed in 2010. It was followed by the [[sequel]] ''[[Backdraft 2]]'' in 2019, with Baldwin and Sutherland reprising their roles.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo firefighters of Engine 17 of the [[Chicago Fire Department]] are brothers. Lt. Stephen \"Bull\" McCaffrey, the elder, is experienced, while Brian has labored under his brother's shadow his entire life. Brian returns to firefighting after several other careers falter, though Stephen has doubts that Brian is still fit to be a firefighter. In 1971, Brian witnessed the death of their firefighting father, Captain Dennis McCaffrey, while accompanying him on a call. The longest-serving of all the men at Engine 17, John \"Axe\" Adcox, served under the McCaffreys' father and was like an uncle to the boys when their father died. Adcox grows concerned about Stephen's unorthodox methods and disregard for safety procedures, as does Stephen's wife Helen, who separated from Stephen to protect herself and their son Sean.\n\nInspector Donald \"Shadow\" Rimgale, a dedicated arson investigator and veteran firefighter is called in because some recent explosive fires resemble those set by pyromaniac Ronald Bartel, who has been imprisoned for years. Brian is reassigned as his assistant after an argument with Stephen. Rimgale manipulates Ronald's obsession with fire to ensure his annual parole application is rejected. It is revealed during an investigation that [[Chicago City Council]] [[alderman]] Marty Swayzak has supported fire department budget cuts. Contractors paid him off to shut down firehouses so they could be converted into community centers, with the contractors receiving contracts for the construction. Brian also rekindles a relationship with Jennifer Vaitkus, an aide to Swayzak.\n\nWhen Engine 17 answers a call in a high-rise, Stephen urges them to move in quickly, despite Adcox's advice to wait for backup. Brian's friend and fellow trainee, Tim Krizminski, opens a door, triggering a [[backdraft]]. His face is burned beyond recognition and he barely survives. Adcox and Brian both condemn Stephen for what happened, but Stephen hates being criticized for his behavior. Rimgale and Brian go to Swayzak's home to confront him after learning of his connection to the three backdraft victims, Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffery Holcomb, interrupting a masked man about to set the place on fire. The man attacks them with a flashlight but is burned on his shoulder by an electrical socket. Rimgale saves Brian and Swayzak from the house but is injured in an explosion. In his hospital bed, Rimgale tells Brian to revisit Ronald, who helps Brian realize that only a firefighter would be so careful as to not let backdraft fires rage out of control.\n\nBrian suspects Stephen but spots a burn in the shape of an electrical socket on Adcox's back and reveals his suspicions to his brother just before an alarm. When Brian realizes Adcox has heard their exchange, he jumps aboard Truck 46 after borrowing some turnout gear. On their way to the fire their truck accidentally crashes after dodging a taxi. Stephen confronts Adcox about the backdrafts during a [[multiple-alarm fire]] at a chemical plant. Adcox admits that he set the fires to kill Swayzak's associates because Swayzak benefitted from firefighters' deaths and closed down firehouses. When an explosion destroys the catwalk they are on, Stephen grabs Adcox's hand while hanging on to the remains of the catwalk. Stephen refuses Adcox's advice to let go of him and loses his grip on the catwalk. Stephen lands on the lower catwalk, but Adcox dies when he falls into the fire. Brian bravely battles the fire, allowing two firefighters to reach Stephen and carry him to safety. Stephen dies with Brian by his side on the way to the hospital, with his final request being that Brian must not reveal Adcox to be the perpetrator to not hurt the fire department's reputation.\n\nAfter Stephen and Adcox's funeral, Brian and Rimgale, with the help of the police, interrupt Swayzak at a press conference. Rimgale questions Swayzak on a fake manpower study that led to the deaths of several firemen, including Stephen and Adcox. They also state that Swayzak engineered the downsizing of the Chicago Fire Department, destroying Swayzak's mayoral ambitions. Brian continues as a firefighter, carrying on his family's firefighting tradition despite the loss of his father and brother. The film ends as Brian helps a rookie firefighter with his turnout gear as the department responds to a call.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Kurt Russell]] as Lieutenant Stephen \"Bull\" McCaffrey\n**Russell also plays Captain Dennis McCaffrey\n*[[William Baldwin]] as Probationary Firefighter Brian McCaffrey\n*[[Robert De Niro]] as Inspector Donald \"Shadow\" Rimgale, Office of Fire Investigation\n*[[Donald Sutherland]] as Ronald Bartel\n*[[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Jennifer Vaitkus\n*[[Scott Glenn]] as Senior Firefighter John \"Axe\" Adcox\n*[[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Helen McCaffrey\n*[[Jason Gedrick]] as Probationary Firefighter Tim Krizminski\n*[[J.

Firefighters are shown advancing through fully involved structure fires while not wearing the complete complement of protective gear (Nomex hoods, radios, [[PASS device]]s). Most scenes display firefighting without the use of SCBA &lsqb;[[self-contained breathing apparatus]]&rsqb;. Realism in our case would make a very bad movie because the fact is that in almost every fire the smoke conditions completely obscure all vision.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ron Garner |publisher=iUniverse |year=2004 |page=62 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lB5yTqwNMZIC&pg=PA62 |title=Fire Chief |access-date=4 July 2013|isbn=9780595769896 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"The movie...came pretty close at times, but it also suffered from the very same, all too common shortcomings that any visual presentation was bound to encounter (...)
