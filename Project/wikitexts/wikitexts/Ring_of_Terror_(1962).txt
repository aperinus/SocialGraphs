Directed by Clark L. Paylow from a screenplay by Lewis Simeon and Jerrold I. Zinnamon, the film stars George Mather as Lewis, with Austin Green and Esther Furst in supporting roles.\n\n''Ring of Terror'' was poorly received by nearly every critic who reviewed it. Criticisms were directed at the pacing and the age of the actors, with many critics feeling it was unsuitable for them to play college students due to their age. The film was featured in the sixth episode of the second season of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', along with the third chapter of the 1939 serial ''[[The Phantom Creeps]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nMedical student Lewis Moffitt (George E. Mather) protects a secret fear of the dark, stemming from an ordeal as a child which involved a dead body that frightened him. Despite this, he acts indifferent during the first autopsy that he and his class witness, which has a positive effect on his courage. However, the autopsy provokes his soon-to-be frat brothers to come up with a strange induction practice, expecting it to go wrong. They task Lewis with finding and taking the ring of a deceased person, so he can be accepted into the fraternity.\n\n''Ring of Terror'' is narrated by a graveyard keeper named R.J. Dobson, who invites the audience to follow him while he attempts to find his missing cat. When he finds himself near a specific gravestone, he finds himself thinking about Lewis Moffitt and his ordeal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* George Mather as Lewis B.

A review in ''Fight Night on Channel 9: Saturday Night Horror Films on New York's WOR-TV, 1973-1987'' by James Arena gave ''Ring of Terror'' a C, but noted that \"it was just off-beat enough to hold my interest.\"<ref name=Arena/> ''Ring of Terror'' was included in Steve Miller's ''150 Movies You Should Die Before You See.'' Miller gave ''Ring of Terror'' five thumbs down. He especially criticized the fact that the actors cast as college students were far too old, noting that they were in their late 30s and early 40s.<ref name=Miller/> Michael Adams, in his book ''Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies: A Film Critic's Year-Long Quest to Find the Worst Movie Ever Made,'' reviewed ''Ring of Terror'' and found it to be dull and full of padding. Like Miller, he noted that the actors were far too old to play college students. He pointed out that lead George E. Mather was 42 when he filmed ''Ring of Terror.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Michael|title=Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies: A Film Critic's Year-Long Quest to Find the Worst Movie Ever Made|year=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0061966316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AeL09OCjLEC}}</ref> ''VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever'' called ''Ring of Terror'' a \"cheaply made flop.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Craddock|first=Jim|title=VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever|year=2006|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=0787689807|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtgShDDpklEC}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' ===\n''Ring of Terror'' was featured in a second season episode of the television comedy series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]].''
