It was the final film featuring star [[Peter Sellers]] and [[David Tomlinson]]. Based on characters created by [[Sax Rohmer]], the film stars Sellers in the dual role of [[Fu Manchu]], a megalomaniacal Chinese evil genius,<ref name=\"LoukidesFuller1990\">{{cite book|last1=Loukides|first1=Paul|last2=Fuller|first2=Linda K.|title=Beyond the Stars: Stock Characters in American Popular Film|url=https://archive.org/details/beyondstars00louk|url-access=registration|access-date=11 April 2013|year=1990|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-479-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/beyondstars00louk/page/72 72]}}</ref> and English country [[gentleman detective]] [[Nayland Smith]].\n\nPre-production began with [[Richard Quine]] as director. By the time production commenced, [[Piers Haggard]] had replaced him. Sellers handled the re-shoots himself.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sEAVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZQgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6000,6771812&hl=en|title=Review|date=15 May 1980|access-date=7 November 2012|publisher=The Spokesman-Review}}</ref> Released two weeks after Sellers' death, the film was a commercial and critical failure. It was also the final screen appearance for Tomlinson, who retired from acting shortly before its release.\n\n==Plot==\nThe opening titles announce it is set \"possibly around 1933.\" The story concerns the 168-year-old Fu Manchu, who must duplicate the ingredients to the [[Elixir of life|elixir vitae]] (which gives him extended life) after the original is accidentally destroyed by one of Fu's minions.\n\nWhen the diamond \"The Star of Leningrad\" is stolen by a clockwork spider from a Soviet exhibition in Washington D.C., the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) sends a pair of special agents (agents Pete Williams and Joe Capone) to London, in order to seek the assistance of [[Scotland Yard]] as a card from Fu Manchu's organisation the Si-Fan has been left at the crime. Sir Roger Avery of the Yard feels this is a job for Fu's nemesis, Sir Denis Nayland Smith, now retired.\n\nNayland Smith correctly surmises that Fu Manchu will steal the identical twin to the missing diamond that is held among the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] in the [[Tower of London]]. Smith also predicts that Fu will be thwarted by the tight security (several aged [[Beefeater]]s) at the Tower, then will kidnap [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] to gain the jewel. He recruits Alice Rage, a woman police constable, to impersonate the Queen and fool Fu's gang. She is soon captured by Fu but the plan backfires somewhat, however, when she falls in love with her captor. She switches sides and willingly helps Fu.\n\nThe [[Crown Jewels]] are guarded by Sir Nules Thudd, an obese Chinese-cuisine loving glutton. The man has obesity-related health problems, and has been ordered by the doctor to walk around for {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} a day on stilts. Thudd is promised access to Fu's outdoor restaurant of Chinese food, and in return helps the Si-Fan steal the diamond. Fu steals the rest of the Crown Jewels as well.\n\nNayland then uses his flying country house, \"The Spirit of Wiltshire\", to transport himself and his fellow officers. They fly all the way to Fu Manchu's mountain base in the [[Himalayas]]. Meanwhile Fu has recreated the elixir vitae, only to find that it has no effect on him. One of the ingredients used was faulty.\n\nNayland's country house is soon besieged by an army of Si-Fan. Nayland demands an audience with Fu, and is transported to his old enemy. Fu is in poor health by this point. Nayland reveals that he had hidden the real diamond. Fu offers to return the Crown Jewels in exchange for the diamond. Once Nayland hands over the diamond, Fu has a new elixir vitae prepared for him. Fu becomes young and vibrant again.\n\nFu willingly hands over the Crown Jewels to Nayland's allies. He also has a diamond identical to \"The Star of Leningrad\" handed over to Capone, arguing that the Russians will not see any difference. In a private meeting, Fu expresses his appreciation of Nayland, who has been the only worthy adversary of his life. He offers Nayland part of the elixir vitae, but asks him not to drink it until he returns to London. Fu warns Nayland that his latest fiendish plot will wipe out his enemies.\n\nSmith rejoins his fellow officers in time to see a rejuvenated Fu Manchu sporting an [[Elvis Presley]]-type jumpsuit. Fu rises from the floor and, his cohorts now form a rock band. They sing the song \"Rock-a-Fu\", as the story ends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Peter Sellers]] as [[Fu Manchu]] / [[Sir Denis Nayland Smith]]\n*[[Helen Mirren]] as Alice Rage\n*[[David Tomlinson]] as Sir Roger Avery\n*[[Sid Caesar]] as Joe Capone\n*[[Simon Williams (actor)|Simon Williams]] as Robert Townsend\n*[[Steve Franken]] as Pete Williams\n*[[Stratford Johns]] as Ismail\n*[[John Le Mesurier]] as Perkins\n*[[John Sharp (actor)|John Sharp]] as Sir Nules Thudd\n*[[Clive Dunn]] as Keeper of the Keys, Tower of London\n*[[Cl\u00e9ment Harari]] as Dr. Wretch\n*[[Burt Kwouk]] as Servant\n*Kwan-Young Lee as Tong\n*John Tan, Philip Tan, Serge Julien, and Johns Rajohnson as Dacoity\n*[[Katia Tchenko]] as Tour Guide\n}}\nSellers also appears in an uncredited cameo as a Mexican ''[[Banditry|bandito]]''.\n\n==Background==\nSellers had previously recorded a 1955 ''[[The Goon Show|Goon Show]]'' entitled \"The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu-Manchu\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoonshow.net/scripts_show.asp?title=s06e12_the_terrible_revenge_of_fred_fu_manchu|title=The Goon Show Site \u2013 Script \u2013 The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu-Manchu (Series 6, Episode 12)|date=6 December 1955|publisher=Thegoonshow.net|access-date=7 November 2012}}</ref> set in 1895. In the film, his Fu insists friends call him \"Fred\" and that he had once been the groundsman at [[Eton College|Eton]].\n\nIn addition to Sellers, the film features [[Sid Caesar]] as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Joe Capone, [[David Tomlinson]] as [[Scotland Yard]] Commissioner Sir Roger Avery, [[Simon Williams (actor)|Simon Williams]] as his bumbling nephew and [[Helen Mirren]] as Police Constable Alice Rage (Mirren sings the Music Hall standard, \"[[Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow]]\").\n\n[[Burt Kwouk]], Sellers' co-star in ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' films with the character of ''Cato'', makes a brief [[cameo appearance]] as a Fu Manchu minion who accidentally destroys the elixir vitae, prompting the joke that Fu thinks he looks familiar. [[John Le Mesurier]], who appeared opposite Sellers in the original ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[The Magic Christian (film)|''The Magic Christian]]'', has a small part in the film as Smith's butler, and [[Steve Franken]], who played the tipsy waiter opposite Sellers in ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'', returns as an FBI agent.\n\nUnlike other Fu Manchu works, Fu's daughter Fah Lo Suee, and Nayland Smith's friend Dr. Petrie do not appear in the film.\n\n==Production==\nIn 1976, Robert Kaufman was writing the script for ''Fu Manchu'' to star Peter Sellers and [[Michael Caine]].<ref>FILM CLIPS: 'Rose' Not 'Exorcist' Reincarnated\nKilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 31 July 1976: b7.</ref>\n\nProduction was troublesome before filming started, with two directors\u2014[[Richard Quine]] and [[John Avildsen]]\u2014both fired before the script had been completed.{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=242}} Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=212}} with his ill-health often causing delays.{{sfn|Walker|1981|p=213}} Arguments between Sellers and director [[Piers Haggard]] led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation and Sellers taking over, with his long-time friend [[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]] directing some sequences.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|pp=370\u2013371}}\n\nThe filming days were quite tense, with Sellers intervening in practically the entire production of the film. Haggard later recalled:\n<blockquote>It was a very disagreeable experience on that film. I was brought in on an off-chance. He [Sellers]'d agreed to do a fairly stock Hollywood comedy thriller, similar to ''The Pink Panther'' really, playing a detective and a villain. And he'd fallen out of love with that project and didn\u2019t want to do that script. They said, 'Okay, what do you want to do?' and he said, 'Let me go off and do a bit of rewriting.' So he went off with a Hollywood hack and turned it into a series of ''Goon Show'' sketches. The executives were absolutely appalled. They thought, 'Oh my God, we thought he had a picture and now we\u2019ve got a development situation.' I knew one of them, so they said, 'Maybe this guy Haggard could do something with this.' So I got three weeks' work to supervise a rewrite, which we did. We made Peter\u2019s script much more coherent, turned it into something with a bit more of a beginning, middle and end. And they were very pleased with that so I got the gig. But then unfortunately within about two weeks my love affair with Peter Sellers was over but I had to soldier on. I did soldier on but it was no fun, absolutely no fun. Then just towards the end of the shooting he decided, which had been obvious, that either he would go or I would go so they got rid of me. I didn\u2019t have much choice. So I was retired and he directed for the last week or so. It was pretty much a disaster from beginning to end.<ref name=\"piers\">[http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/piershaggard.html Piers Haggard interview, 2003, MJ Simpson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502203752/http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/piershaggard.html |date=2 May 2013 }} accessed 11 April 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Coalition of Asians to Nix Charlie Chan members picketing The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu.jpg|thumb|upright|The Coalition of Asians to Nix Charlie Chan members picketing the film at the [[Hollywood Pacific Theatre]]]]\nAfter the acclaimed movie ''[[Being There]]'' (1979), this was Peter Sellers' last work. He already looked sick and tired (he would die shortly after filming ended), which notably affected his interpretive quality in a weak and uninteresting plot with other poor performances.\n\nIn fact the film was universally panned by critics. Sellers appears unwell and lethargic throughout and his characterizations of Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu are both portrayed in a mostly subdued fashion. It is even probable that Fu Manchu's scenes with his \"declining vitality\" were a deliberate adaptation of the script to the actor's state of health at the time.\n\nPhil Hardy described the film as a \"British atrocity\".<ref name=\"Hardy1997\">{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Phil|title=The BFI Companion to Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agfHUakbj5kC&pg=PA139|access-date=11 April 2013|year=1997|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-304-33215-1|page=139}}</ref> ''[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast]]'' magazine wrote \"Peter Sellers' last hurrah isn't nearly as impressive as his recent ''[[Being There]]''.
