The film chronicles the life of [[Thoroughbred]] [[Horse racing|race horse]] [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], winner of the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] in 1973. [[Diane Lane]] plays Secretariat's owner, [[Penny Chenery]], who takes over the [[Doswell, Virginia]], stables of her ailing father Christopher Chenery \ndespite her lack of horse-racing knowledge.  With the help of veteran [[Horse trainer|trainer]] [[Lucien Laurin]] (played by [[John Malkovich]]), she navigates the male-dominated business, ultimately fostering the first Triple Crown winner [[Citation (horse)|in 25 years]] and one of the greatest racehorses of all time.\n\nFilming took place on location in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and [[Carencro, Louisiana]]. The film premiered in Hollywood on September 30, 2010, and was released in the United States on October 8, 2010, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].<ref name=\"Copley\">{{cite news | last=Copley | first=Rich | url=http://www.kansascity.com/2010/04/27/1908398/secretariat-returns-to-derby-in.html | title=Secretariat returns to Derby in movie form | work=Kansas City Star | date=April 28, 2010 | access-date=2010-04-28 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> It received generally favorable reviews from critics and earned $60 million on a $35 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1969, Denver housewife and mother Penny Chenery learns of her mother's death and returns to her childhood home. She reunites with Mrs. Ham, her father's secretary, and comforts her confused and elderly father. At her mother's funeral, Penny meets [[Arthur B. Hancock, Jr.|Arthur \"Bull\" Hancock]] and his son, Seth Hancock, of [[Claiborne Farm]] in Kentucky. The Hancocks offer any help she may need during her efforts to bring Meadow Stables back to profitability. Penny's brother Hollis informs her of a dishonest sale that was about to be made by the trainer until their mother stopped him. Penny fires the trainer and asks Bull Hancock to help her find a new trainer. He recommends Lucien Laurin, an aging [[French Canadian]], who initially turns down Penny's offer.\n\nPenny's father had made a deal with leading owner [[Ogden Phipps]] that if Phipps bred his best stallion ([[Bold Ruler]]) to Chenery's two best mares ([[Somethingroyal]] and Hasty Matelda), the two owners would each receive one foal, flipping a coin to decide who would choose. Bold Ruler, the stallion, was fast but couldn't last over distances. Hasty Matelda is the obvious choice for her young age, but Somethingroyal's bloodline is made up of many horses with good stamina. Penny hopes to choose Somethingroyal's foal for the interesting mix of speed and stamina. Phipps wins the toss and chooses Hasty Matelda's foal, leaving Penny with Somethingroyal's foal, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]].\n\nWhen Secretariat enters his first race at [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct]] race track in [[Queens]], [[New York City]], everyone has high expectations. The jockey, Paul Feliciano, is very young with little experience, which worries Penny, but Lucien reassures her. During the race, Secretariat is repeatedly hit by other horses and comes in fourth. Penny and Lucien fight, and Lucien blames Paul for the loss. Penny realizes the only way Secretariat will ever win is if he has an experienced jockey. Penny's flight back home is canceled on the day of the race, and she misses her daughter Kate's solo in a play. Her son holds up the pay phone so Penny can hear Kate sing.\n\nPenny gets experienced [[Canadian]] jockey [[Ron Turcotte]] to ride Secretariat to many victories. Secretariat is named horse of the year after a successful two-year-old season. Penny's father suffers a stroke and dies, leaving Penny and her brother Hollis to inherit the estate. Although she needs six million dollars to pay [[estate tax]]es, Penny refuses to sell Secretariat.\n\nInstead she [[syndicate]]s the horse, selling 32 shares worth more than six million dollars, as long as he can win a three-year-old distance race. She tries to sell a share to Ogden Phipps, who instead offers to buy the horse for seven million dollars. Penny refuses to sell him. When Phipps demands to know why, she tells him Secretariat's value will triple when he wins the Triple Crown \u2013 a feat no horse has accomplished in twenty-five years. During this time, [[Frank \"Pancho\" Martin]], trainer of rival horse [[Sham (horse)|Sham]], tries to provoke a match race with Secretariat.\n\nSecretariat is taken to the [[Wood Memorial]] three weeks before the first of the Triple Crown races to take on [[Sham (horse)|Sham]] and attempt to earn Penny her syndication money. Turcotte notices that the horse's breathing is heavy, he refuses to eat, and he is reluctant to allow the bit into his mouth. After Secretariat loses the race, an [[abscess]] in his mouth is discovered that may have caused the poor performance.\n\nSecretariat recovers and wins both the [[Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Preakness Stakes|Preakness]] in record time. Sham comes in second place in both races and Pancho Martin tells Sham's jockey, Laffit Pincay, to stay with Secretariat through the [[Belmont Stakes|Belmont]] in an attempt to tire him early and win. However, Secretariat runs [[1973 Belmont Stakes|an unbelievable race]], finishing 31 [[Horse length|lengths]] (over {{convert|82|yd|m}}) ahead of the next horse to secure the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]]. An exhausted Sham ends up in last place, having failed to keep up with Secretariat's record-breaking pace. Penny and her family receive the Triple Crown trophy at the end of the race.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Diane Lane]] as [[Penny Chenery]]\n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Lucien Laurin]]\n* Otto Thorwarth as [[Ron Turcotte]]\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Elizabeth Hamm\n* [[AJ Michalka|Amanda Michalka]] as Kate Tweedy\n* [[Graham McTavish]] as Earl Jansen\n* [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]] as [[William Nack|Bill Nack]]\n* Carissa Capobianco as Sarah Tweedy\n* [[Drew Roy]] as Seth Hancock\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as [[Christopher Chenery]]\n* [[James Cromwell]] as [[Ogden Phipps]]\n* [[Nelsan Ellis]] as [[Eddie Sweat]]\n* [[Dylan Walsh]] as John Tweedy\n* [[Fred Thompson|Fred Dalton Thompson]] as [[Arthur B.

These include:\n*The film makes no mention of [[Riva Ridge]], a Chenery-owned horse that had won the 1972 Kentucky Derby and Belmont, and helped keep Meadow Stable afloat. According to Christine, but for Riva Ridge's career, Chenery might not have even owned Secretariat by the time he turned three. \n*Christine called the portrayal of several people, including Pancho Martin and Ogden Phipps, \"cartoonish\". \n*The film leads viewers to believe that [[Sham (horse)|Sham]] won the [[Wood Memorial Stakes|Wood Memorial]], a major prep race then held two weeks before the Derby. In reality, that race was won by [[Angle Light]]. Chenery's most significant conflict in the run-up to the Derby was not with Phipps, but instead with Edwin Whittaker, the owner of Angle Light (a horse also trained by Laurin).<ref name=\"Christine tales\">{{cite web |url=http://www.horseraceinsider.com/west-coast-wash/comments/10052010-the-tales-the-secretariat-movie-forgot/#comments |title=The Tales the Secretariat Movie Forgot |first=Bill |last=Christine |publisher=Horserace Insider |date=October 4, 2010 |access-date=May 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822075944/http://www.horseraceinsider.com/west-coast-wash/comments/10052010-the-tales-the-secretariat-movie-forgot#comments |archive-date=August 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSteve Haskin, a sportswriter for ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'', had some of the same issues, particularly the omission of Riva Ridge and the staging of the Wood Memorial.
