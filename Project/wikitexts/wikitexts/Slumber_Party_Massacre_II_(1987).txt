It is the second installment in the original [[Massacre (franchise)|''Slumber Party Massacre'' trilogy]], and stars [[Crystal Bernard]], and Atanas Ilitch. The film follows Courtney, a character introduced in [[The Slumber Party Massacre|the previous film]], as she and her friends are attacked by a supernatural killer with a power-drill guitar.\n\n''Slumber Party Massacre II'' grossed $1.3 million at the box office on a budget of $500,000. Despite largely negative reception, the film has attracted a small [[cult following]] among fans of the slasher genre.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Slumber Party Massacre III]]'', was released in 1990.\n\n==Plot==\nCourtney Bates, who survived the [[The Slumber Party Massacre#Plot|events of the first film]], is now a senior in high school. She invites her crush, Matt, to stay at a condominium for her birthday weekend with her and her friends, Amy, Sheila, and Sally. Upon arriving, two of the girls' boyfriends, Jeff and T.J., show up at the house. That night, Courtney has a dream of the killer from the [[The Slumber Party Massacre|first film]], who is now [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as a [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]] and armed with a drill bit guitar, and awakens on the kitchen floor. That day, her visions grow violent but she is comforted when Matt arrives. Sally disappears and the group is unable to find her, but she later returns to the house, having left to go to the store.\n\nCourtney and Matt are left alone. Matt surprises Courtney with a birthday cake and the two begin to have sex. The killer suddenly appears and impales Matt through the chest before chasing Courtney downstairs, where he confronts the group, who have just returned. As the others escape, the killer impales Sally with the drill. Sheila and T.J. flee, while Courtney, Amy, and Jeff leave in Jeff's car. Jeff is impaled by the killer, and Courtney and Amy flee back to the house. Sheila and T.J. run to a nearby house for help, but the killer catches up to them and T.J. is killed. Sheila manages to return to the condominium before the killer murders her as well. Courtney and Amy escape but the killer pursues them through a construction site, where Amy falls to her death. Courtney uses an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|oxyacetylene torch]] to light the killer on fire, finally killing him.\n\nSometime later, Courtney wakes up next to Matt, but he morphs into the killer. She then awakens inside a psychiatric ward and screams frantically as a drill bursts through the floor and the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Crystal Bernard]] as Courtney Bates\n*[[Kimberly McArthur]] as Amy\n*Juliette Cummins as Sheila Barrington\n*Patrick Lowe as Matt Arbicost\n*[[Heidi Kozak]] as Sally Burns\n*Joel Hoffman as T.J.\n*Scott Westmoreland as Jeff\n*[[Jennifer Rhodes]] as Mrs. Bates\n*Cindy Eilbacher as Valerie Bates\n*[[Michael Delano]] as Officer Kreuger\n*Hamilton Mitchell as Officer Voorhies\n*Atanas Ilitch as The Driller Killer\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming of ''Slumber Party Massacre II'' took place in [[Los Angeles]], California in June 1987 under the [[working title]] ''Don't Let Go''.
