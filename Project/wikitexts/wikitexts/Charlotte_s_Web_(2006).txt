B. White]]. Directed by [[Gary Winick]] and written by [[Susannah Grant]] and [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], it is the second film adaptation of White's book, and a live-action/CGI remake of the [[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|1973 animated version]] produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. The film stars [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Kevin Anderson (actor)|Kevin Anderson]], and [[Beau Bridges]], with voices provided by [[Dominic Scott Kay]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[John Cleese]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Andr\u00e9 3000|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Reba McEntire]], and [[Robert Redford]]. [[Danny Elfman]] composed the film's score.\n\nProduced by [[Walden Media]], [[Jordan Kerner]]'s The K Entertainment Company and [[Nickelodeon Movies]], the film premiered in [[Australia]] on December 7, 2006 and was released theatrically by [[Paramount Pictures]] on December 15, 2006 in the United States. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, yet was only modestly commercially successful. The movie grossed $83 million at the US box office and $61 million elsewhere for a worldwide total of $144 million against an $85 million budget, as well as grossing an additional $95.2 million in home media sales.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Charlottes-Web#tab=video-sales | title=Charlotte's Web (2006) - Financial Information }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring springtime on a farm in [[Somerset County, Maine]], young Fern Arable discovers her father John about to kill a runt of a litter of newborn pigs. She successfully begs her father to spare the piglet's life; Fern names him Wilbur and nurtures him lovingly. The next morning, Fern sneaks Wilbur into her school desk and she lies to the teacher who forces her to open her desk and sends her to the principal's office.\n\nWhen Wilbur has matured, Fern is regretfully forced to take him to her uncle Homer Zuckerman's barnyard. Mrs. Arable feels slightly concerned for Fern's behavior and one night, prevails upon Fern to stay home, do her homework and go straight to bed as a punishment. During this time, Wilbur feels abandoned and is left yearning for companionship, but is snubbed by the other animals - a comedic, mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, and \"potentially dangerous\" [[rat]] named Templeton; a serious and steadfast [[sheep]] named Samuel; a fun-loving and kindly [[goose]] couple named Gussy and Golly; two beautiful and laid-back [[cow]] sisters named Bitsy and Betsy; and a cowardly and humorous [[horse]] named Ike - until he is befriended by Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful [[barn spider]] who lives in the space above Wilbur's sty in the Zuckermans' barn.\n\nWhen the other animals reveal to Wilbur that he will be prepared for dinner by [[Christmas]], Charlotte promises to hatch a plan guaranteed to save Wilbur's life. With the help of Templeton, Charlotte convinces the Zuckerman family that Wilbur is actually quite special by spelling out descriptions of him in her [[spider web|web]] such as \"Some pig\", \"Terrific\", \"Radiant\" and \"Humble\" in the opening to the barn for the Zuckermans to see. These descriptions are even posted in newspapers that the whole town read and came out to see. \n\nEventually, the Arables, Zuckermans, Wilbur, Charlotte and Templeton go to a fair where Wilbur is entered in a contest. While there, Charlotte produces an [[spider#Reproduction|egg sac]] containing her unborn offspring while Wilbur, despite winning no prizes, is later celebrated by the fair's staff and visitors, making him too prestigious to justify killing him. Exhausted from laying eggs, Charlotte cannot return home because she is dying. Wilbur bids an emotional farewell to her as she remains at the fair and dies shortly after his departure, but he manages to take her egg sac home with the help of Templeton.\n\nWilbur then lives to witness his first Christmas and by the next spring, hundreds of Charlotte's offspring emerge; most of the young spiders soon leave, but three named Joy, Aranea and Nellie stay and become Wilbur's friends.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dakota Fanning]] as Fern Arable\n*[[Kevin Anderson (actor)|Kevin Anderson]] as John Arable\n*[[Beau Bridges]] as Dr. Dorian\n*Louis Corbett as Avery Arable\n*[[Essie Davis]] as Phyllis Arable\n*[[Siobhan Fallon Hogan]] as Edith Zuckerman\n*[[Gary Basaraba]] as Homer L.
