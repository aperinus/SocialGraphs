The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Molly Shannon]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Michael Showalter]] (and various other members of the sketch comedy group [[The State (comedy troupe)|The State]]), [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Ken Marino]], [[Michael Ian Black]], [[Bradley Cooper]] (in his film debut), [[Amy Poehler]], [[Zak Orth]], and [[A.&nbsp;D. Miles]]. It takes place during the last full day at a fictional [[summer camp]] in 1981, and spoofs the [[Sex comedy|sex comedies]] aimed at teen audiences of that era.\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial failure, but has since developed a [[Cult film|cult following]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Tobias |first=Scott |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-new-cult-canon-wet-hot-american-summer,2341 |title=The New Cult Canon: ''Wet Hot American Summer'' |work=The AV Club |date=June 11, 2008 |access-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref> as many of its cast members have gone on to high-profile work.

Counselors have one last chance to have a romantic encounter with another person at Camp Firewood. All the while, Ben and Susie, two overzealous drama instructors, attempt to produce and choreograph the greatest talent show Camp Firewood has ever seen. Beth, the camp director, struggles to keep her counselors in order\u2014and her campers alive\u2014while falling in love with Henry, an [[astrophysics]] associate professor at [[Colby College]]. Henry has to devise a plan to save the camp from a piece of [[NASA]]'s [[Skylab]], which is falling to Earth.\n\nShy Coop has a crush on Katie, his fellow counselor, but has to pry her away from her rebellious, obnoxious, and obviously unfaithful boyfriend, Andy. Only Gene, the camp chef, can help Coop win Katie\u2014with some help from a talking can of mixed vegetables. Gary, Gene's unfortunately chosen apprentice, and J.J. attempt to figure out why their friend McKinley has never been with a woman. They are surprised to find that McKinley is in love with Ben, whom he marries in a ceremony at the lake. Victor attempts to lose his [[virginity]] with the resident loose-girl Abby, but a series of mishaps get in his way.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Janeane Garofalo]] as Beth\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Professor Henry Newman\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Gail von Kleinenstein\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Andy\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Gene\n* [[Michael Showalter]] as Gerald \"Coop\" Cooperberg/Alan Shemper\n* [[Marguerite Moreau]] as Katie Finnerty\n* [[Ken Marino]] as Victor Pulak\n* [[Michael Ian Black]] as McKinley\n* [[Zak Orth]] as J.J.\n* [[A.&nbsp;D.
