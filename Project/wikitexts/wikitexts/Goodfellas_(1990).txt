It is a [[film adaptation]] of the 1985 [[nonfiction]] book ''[[Wiseguy (book)|Wiseguy]]'' by Pileggi. Starring [[Robert De Niro]], [[Ray Liotta]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Lorraine Bracco]] and [[Paul Sorvino]], the film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate [[Henry Hill]] and his friends and family from 1955 to 1980.\n\nScorsese initially titled the film ''Wise Guy'' and postponed making it; he and Pileggi later changed the title to ''Goodfellas''. To prepare for their roles in the film, De Niro, Pesci and Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and [[Ad libitum#Drama|ad-libbing]] came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked most and put them into a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.\n\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 9, 1990, where Scorsese was awarded with [[Silver Lion]] for Best Director, and was released in the United States on September 19, 1990, by [[Warner Bros.]] The film was made on a budget of $25&nbsp;million, and grossed $47&nbsp;million. ''Goodfellas'' received widespread critical acclaim upon release: the critical consensus on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calls it \"arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career\". The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], with Pesci winning for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film won five awards from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]]. Additionally, ''Goodfellas'' was named the year's best film by various critics' groups.\n\n''Goodfellas'' is widely regarded as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films ever made]], particularly in the [[Gangster film|gangster]] genre. In 2000, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the United States [[Library of Congress]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Names 25 More Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-200/librarian-of-congress-names-25-more-films-to-national-film-registry/2000-12-27/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=April 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403175921/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-200/librarian-of-congress-names-25-more-films-to-national-film-registry/2000-12-27/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=October 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref> Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television series.<ref>{{cite news |last=Merrie |first=Stephanie |title='Goodfellas' is 25.

As of 8/31/2022, there are 618 words -->\nIn 1955, youngster [[Henry Hill]] becomes enamored by the criminal life and [[American Mafia|Mafia]] presence in his working class Italian-American neighborhood in [[Brooklyn]]. He begins working for local ''[[caporegime]]'' Paulie Cicero and his associates: Jimmy \"the Gent\" Conway, an Irish-American truck hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito, a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as a [[fence (criminal)|fence]] for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. The three associates spend most of their nights in the 1960s at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana nightclub]] carousing with women. Henry starts dating [[Karen Friedman Hill|Karen Friedman]], a Jewish woman who is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities. Seduced by Henry's glamorous lifestyle, she marries him despite her parents' disapproval.\n\nIn 1970, [[William Bentvena|Billy Batts]], a [[made man]] in the [[Gambino crime family]] recently released from prison, patronizes Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry; Tommy and Jimmy beat, stab and fatally shoot Billy. The unsanctioned murder of a made man invites retribution; realizing this, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy bury the body in upstate New York. Six months later, however, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing corpse.\n\nIn 1974, Henry witnesses Tommy murder Spider, an errand boy, after exchanging insults with him during a card game. Karen discovers Henry has a mistress and threatens him at gunpoint. Henry moves in with his mistress, but Paulie insists that he should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] with Jimmy. Upon returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, an FBI typist, and they receive ten-year prison sentences. To support his family on the outside, Henry has Karen smuggle in drugs and sells them to a fellow inmate from [[Pittsburgh]].\n\nIn 1978, Henry is paroled and expands his cocaine business with Jimmy and Tommy against Paulie's orders. Jimmy organizes a crew to raid the [[Lufthansa heist|Lufthansa vault]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], stealing six million dollars in cash and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy's orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew (except Tommy and Henry) murdered. In 1979, Tommy is deceived into believing he is to become a made man and is murdered after walking into the room of [[Initiation ritual (mafia)|the ceremony]]\u2014partly as retribution for murdering Batts.\n\nBy 1980, Henry develops a drug habit and becomes a paranoid wreck. He sets up another drug deal with his Pittsburgh associates, but is arrested by narcotics agents and incarcerated. After bailing him out, Karen explains that she flushed $60,000 worth of cocaine down the toilet to prevent FBI agents from finding it during their raid, leaving them penniless. Feeling betrayed by Henry's drug dealing, Paulie gives him $3,200 and ends their association. Karen goes to Jimmy for help, but eventually flees upon suspecting a trap to murder her. Henry later meets Jimmy at a diner and is asked to travel on a hit assignment, but the novelty of such a request makes Henry suspicious. Realizing that Jimmy also plans to have him killed, Henry finally decides to become an [[informant]] and enroll, with his family, into the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection program]]. Henry gives sufficient testimony and evidence in court to have Paulie and Jimmy convicted, and moves to a nondescript neighborhood, unhappy to leave his exciting gangster life to live as a boring, average \"[[schnook]]\".\n\nThe end title cards state that (as of 1990, when the film was released) Henry is still a protected witness but that he was arrested in 1987 in [[Seattle]] for narcotics conspiracy. Henry received five years of [[probation]] but has since been clean. He and Karen separated in 1989, and Paulie died the previous year in [[Federal Medical Center, Fort Worth|Fort Worth Federal Prison]] from respiratory illness. Jimmy is serving a 20 years-to-life sentence in a New York prison for murder and would be eligible for parole in 2004.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Please do not add real life people who are fictionalized in this film to this list.

He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography.<ref name=Arnold /> For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him\u2014the \"Funny how? Do I amuse you?\" scene\u2014is based on an actual event that Pesci experienced. Pesci was working as a waiter when he thought he was making a compliment to a mobster by saying he was \"funny\"; however, the comment was not taken well.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/goodfellas-joe-pesci-funny-how-scene-2015-5?r=US&IR=T|title=One of the most famous scenes in 'Goodfellas' is based on something that actually happened to Joe Pesci|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=May 4, 2015|access-date=January 13, 2020|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114035346/https://www.businessinsider.com/goodfellas-joe-pesci-funny-how-scene-2015-5?r=US&IR=T|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies: Featuring the 100 Greatest Gangster Films of All Time|first1=George|last1=Anastasia|first2=Glen|last2=Macnow|publisher=Running Press|year=2011|isbn=9780762441549|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kY5tHAksa7kC&q=funny|access-date=November 11, 2020|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114035346/https://books.google.com/books?id=kY5tHAksa7kC&q=funny|url-status=live}}</ref> It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script.<ref name=Kaplan>{{cite AV media|last1=Kaplan|first1=Jonah <!-- (Writer and Editor) -->|first2=Stephen (Producer)|last2= Altobellow|first3=Jeffrey (Producer)|last3=Schwartz|title= Getting Made: The Making of ''Goodfellas''| date=November 19, 2004|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415005/|medium=Documentary short|publisher=Automat Pictures}}</ref> The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised.

Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.<ref name=Linfield />\n\nThe long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission to go in the short way, and this forced them to go round the back.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese decided to film the sequence in one unbroken shot in order to symbolize that Henry's entire life was ahead of him, commenting, \"It's his seduction of her [Karen] and it's also the lifestyle seducing him.\"<ref name=Thompson /> This sequence was shot eight times.<ref name=Kaplan />\n\nHenry's last day as a wise guy was the hardest part of the film for Scorsese to shoot because he wanted to properly show Henry's state of anxiety, paranoia, and racing thoughts caused by [[cocaine]] and [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] intoxication.<ref name=Thompson /> In an interview with movie critic [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]], Scorsese explained the reason for Pesci shooting at the camera at the end of the film, \"well that's a reference right to the end of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', that's the way that ends, that film, and basically the plot of this picture is very similar to ''The Great Train Robbery''. It hasn't changed, 90 years later, it's the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he's always going to look behind his back, he's gotta have eyes behind his back, because they're gonna get him someday.\" The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wise guy, about which Scorsese said, \"I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they do\u2014and maybe with the system which allows this.\"<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nScorsese wanted to depict the film's violence realistically, \"cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental.\"<ref name=\"Goodwin, Richard\" /> However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|R rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]].<ref name=Gilbert /> With a budget of $25&nbsp;million, ''Goodfellas'' was Scorsese's most expensive film to that point but still only a medium-sized budget by Hollywood standards. It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film. It was shown twice in California, and a lot of audiences were \"agitated\" by Henry's last day as a wise guy sequence. Scorsese argued that that was the point of the scene.<ref name=Thompson /> Scorsese and the film's editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes.<ref name=Kaplan /> One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the \"Do I amuse you?\" scene.<ref name=Thompson />\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Main|Goodfellas (soundtrack)}}\nWhile there is no incidental score as such in the film, Scorsese chose songs for the soundtrack that he felt obliquely commented on the scene or the characters.<ref name=Gilbert /> In a given scene, he used only music contemporary to or older than the scene's setting. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had \"[[Layla]]\" by [[Derek and the Dominos]] playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car, dumpster, and meat truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action.<ref name=Thompson /> Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script, while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.<ref name=Kaplan />\n\n== Release ==\n===Theatrical===\n''Goodfellas'' premiered at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]], where Scorsese received the [[Silver Lion]] award for [[Silver Lion#Silver Lion for Best Direction|best director]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Malcolm |first=Derek |title=The Venice Film Festival ends in uproar |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 17, 1990}}</ref> It was given a wide release in North America on September 21, 1990.\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Goodfellas'' was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] in March 1997, in a single-disc, double-sided, single-layer format that requires the disc to be flipped during viewing; in 2004, [[Warner Bros.
