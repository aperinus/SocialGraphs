It was the first film that was produced by the [[CBS Television Network]]'s film unit, [[Cinema Center Films]], and Day's final film performance.\n\nThe title of the movie comes from a scene where the family goes out for [[Chinese food]], and one of the kids notices that because they are a large group, they get something extra:  \"With six you get eggroll!\"\n\n==Plot==\nAbby McClure (Doris Day) is a widow with three sons who runs the lumberyard that her husband owned.  Her matchmaking sister Maxine (Pat Carroll) tricks her into calling widower Jake Iverson (Brian Keith) and inviting him to the business dinner party Abby is having that night. Not interested in the trouble his sexy, adultery-minded neighbor Cleo (Elaine Devry) is trying to get him into, Jake arrives at Abby's and is bored by all of the matchmaking dialogue. Jake makes up an excuse to leave, but later runs into Abby at an all-night supermarket. Embarrassed by being caught in a fib, Jake meets Abby at a local drive-in run by the wise-cracking Herbie (George Carlin) and the two stay out until 2 a.m. A romance develops, much to the chagrin of Jake's teenage daughter Stacey (Barbara Hershey) and Abby's three sons, Flip, Mitch and Jason (John Findlater, Jimmy Bracken, and Richard Steele). The children make certain that neither Jake nor Abby can be comfortable at the other's home, so the pair wind up more than once at the drive-in, before finally falling in love. Fed up with the situation, they elope, not telling their children that they have married until the next day when the children discover them in bed together.\n\nFrom then on, Abby's sons fight with Iverson's daughter Stacey; while Flip and Stacey both are hostile to the idea of a step-parent; and even Abby's sheepdog and Jake's poodle are incompatible. Neither's house is large enough for the family of six\u2014not including Abby's live-in maid, Molly ([[Alice Ghostley]])--so they borrow a camper and use it as a bedroom while they move into Abby's house and eventually put Jake's up for sale.\n\nThe morning after a bedtime argument, Abby drives off in the camper in a rage; Jake is dumped out clad only in boxers and clutching a teddy bear. After running through the neighborhood, he gets Herbie to lend him some clothes and drive him back to his house. Once Abby discovers what has happened, she returns only to find Jake gone. She is joined by a band of hippies she meets when she reaches the drive-in. When the camper collides with a livestock truck carrying chickens, Abby and the hippies are arrested. Hearing of the accident, Jake and the children rush to her rescue, colliding with the same chicken truck. The angry driver assaults Jake and the children (and pets) unite in his defense. At the station-house the parents and children are joyfully reconciled, and the family finally buys a huge two-story house big enough for a family of six, a maid, and two dogs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n\n===McClure family===\n* [[Doris Day]] as Abby McClure\n* John Findlater as Flip McClure\n* Richard Steele as Jason McClure\n* Jimmy Bracken as Mitch McClure\n* [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as Maxine Scott, Abby's sister\n* [[Herb Voland]] as Harry Scott, Abby's brother-in-law\n\n===Iverson family===\n* [[Brian Keith]] as Jake Iverson\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Stacey Iverson\n{{Col-break}}\n\n===Others===\n* [[George Carlin]] as Herbie Fleck\n* [[Alice Ghostley]] as Abby's maid, Molly \t\n* [[Jamie Farr]] as Jo Jo\n* [[William Christopher]] as Zip-Cloud\n* [[Elaine Devry]] as Cleo Ruskin, Jake's next-door neighbor\n* [[Milton Frome]] as Bud Young\n* [[Jackie Joseph]] as Georgia Watson\n* [[Victor Tayback]] as truck driver\n* [[Allan Melvin]] as Police Desk Sergeant\n* [[The Grass Roots]] as themselves\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production notes==\nIt was the first film made by the newly formed [[Cinema Center Films]], a subdivision of CBS network.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Warga |first=Wayne |date=28 July 1968 |title=Cinema by, but Not Necessarily for, Television |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=C14}}</ref>\n\n===Supporting cast===\nThe cast includes several actors in small parts (some uncredited) who are much better known for other performances, such as [[Jamie Farr]], [[William Christopher]], [[Ken Osmond]], [[Allan Melvin]], [[Jackie Joseph]], [[Milton Frome]], [[Vic Tayback]], [[George Carlin]], [[Peter Leeds]], [[Howard Morris]], [[Maudie Prickett]] and [[Creed Bratton]] (part of the singing group [[The Grass Roots]]). Many of them (as well as Day herself, in ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'') later turned up in TV sitcoms: Farr and Christopher in ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', Tayback and Melvin in ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', Carlin in ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'' and Bratton in ''[[The Office (American TV series)|The Office]]''. (Keith was starring in ''[[Family Affair]]'' at the time, while Osmond had played the iconic [[Eddie Haskell]] in ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''.)\n\n===Blended family premise===\nThe film was released only four months after United Artists' ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]''. While both films have the same premise\u2014that of a widow and a widower marrying each other and creating a blended family\u2014[[Helen Beardsley|the United Artists film was based on a true story]] and was a huge commercial success (if not critical) becoming the [[1968 in film|11th highest-grossing film of the year]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\nAlthough there are similarities between this film, ''Yours, Mine and Ours'' and the later ABC television show ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' that premiered in 1969, the original pilot script for ''The Brady Bunch'' predated the scripts for both of these films.<ref name=Brady>{{cite book |last1=Edelstein |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Lovece |first2=Frank |author-link2=Frank Lovece|title=The Brady Bunch Book |year=1990|publisher=Warner Books |location=New York|isbn=0-446-39137-9 |pages=5\u20139}}</ref>\n\n==Film locations==\nMost of the film's exterior locations were within a five-mile radius of each other:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Radford+Studio+Center+Inc,+4024+Radford+Avenue,+Studio+City,+CA+91604/Ventura+Boulevard+and+Laurel+Canyon+Boulevard+Los+Angeles,+CA+91604/Ulysses+S.+Grant+High+School+13000+Oxnard+St+Valley+Glen,+CA/10501+Kling+St,+Toluca+Lake,+CA+91602/10463+Kling+St,+Toluca+Lake,+CA+91602/10011+Tikita+Pl,+Toluca+Lake,+CA+91602/4248+Clybourn+Ave,+Burbank,+CA+91505/|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Studio City/Valley Village===\n====Ye Olde Drive Inn====\nThe location used for Herbie Fleck's \"Ye Olde Drive Inn\" was a drive-in on Ventura Place, near [[CBS Studio Center]] around the intersection of [[Ventura Boulevard]] and [[Laurel Canyon Boulevard]]. The site is now a sporting goods store.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n====School scenes====\nSchool scenes were filmed at [[Grant High School (Los Angeles)|Ulysses S. Grant High School]] in [[Valley Village, Los Angeles|Valley Village]] (at the time [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]]), California.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n===Toluca Lake===\nBoth of the houses seen in the film are within a block of each other in the suburb of [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake]], which straddles the borders of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]].  The neighborhood that Abby drives the camper truck through is the northern part of Toluca Lake, specifically Kling Street between Arcola Avenue and Cahuenga Avenue.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n====McClure house====\nThe exterior shots for Abby McClure's late-1930s [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] home were filmed at 4248 Clybourn Avenue; the same house number is also used in the film. The interiors are soundstage sets that bear no resemblance to the house's actual interior. A studio replica of the street-facing fa\u00e7ade was also used for some night shots\u2014discernible by the differences in the tree in the front yard\u2014specifically for the scene with rain. A still photograph of the house across the street (4245 Clybourn Avenue) can be seen earlier in the same sequence where Jake arrives on the porch of the McClure house. The homes to the right have all had major remodelings, as well as the McClure house, which is almost unrecognizable as the same house today. However, the fire hydrant at the sidewalk, the covered driveway and the front yard tree all remain as of October 2013.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n====Iverson house====\nThe exterior shots for Jake Iverson's 1929 [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] home were shot at 10011 Tikita Place. All of the exterior night shots were filmed at this location. The interiors\u2014as well as the backyard\u2014are also soundstage sets that bear no resemblance to the house's actual interior and backyard. The house to the left of the Iverson house has undergone major remodeling, whereas the Iverson house still looked very similar to its appearance in this film until about 2014. As of September 2015, the Iverson house was completely demolished and replaced with a faux-traditional home.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n====Iverson-McClure house====\nThe film's final punchline\u2014a large two-story early-1950s [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial]] house shown briefly at the end with a \"Sold\" sign on it and a front pathway flanked by the McClures' sheepdog and the Iversons' poodle\u2014is also in Toluca Lake, at 10463 Kling Street.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n====Police chase scene====\nThe late 1930s two-story Colonial house with the circle driveway that the police chase drives through is at 10501 Kling Street (to the immediate left of the above-mentioned Iverson-McClure house at 10463 Kling).{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n==Music==\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by CBS Television and Columbia Records staff arranger/composer [[Robert Mersey]].\n \nWhile Day provided a vocal performance either onscreen, in voice-over or over the credits in all of her movies since 1958's ''[[The Tunnel of Love]]'', this is one of only three films not to feature a vocal by Day (the others being 1967's ''[[The Ballad of Josie]]'' and 1968's ''[[Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?]]''). A male chorus is heard singing an [[Easy listening|easy-listening]] piece called \"You Make Me Think About You\" in one sequence, but no vocals are heard by Day. A 45RPM single featuring a vocal by [[Johnny Mathis]] and arranged and conducted by Robert Mersey was released by [[Columbia Records]]. The [[Johnny Mathis#Singles|single peaked at 35]] on [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard''{{'}}s Easy Listening Chart]].<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/45686] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nAfter its release, the film went on to gross $10,095,200 at the box office according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and the box office website [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]], making it one of the top ten moneymaking films of Day's 39-film career.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}\n\n''Variety'' said it earned $4.5 million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada.<ref>\"All-time Film Rental Champs\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p. 48</ref>\n\n===Critical===\nUpon its theatrical release, [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"The latest chapter in the continuing adventures of the Widow Day\u2026 was produced by Cinema Center Films, a subsidiary of the Columbia Broadcasting System\u2026 I kept wondering how the characters played by Miss Day lose their husbands.
