Released by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], it is the first film of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]]. Despite the similar style of animation and [[Bruce Timm]]'s involvement, the film is not set within the [[DC Animated Universe]] created by Timm and [[Paul Dini]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the animation and more violent tone than previous adaptations but called it a disappointment, but grossed $10 million on a budget of $3.5 million, making it a commercial success.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Superman - Doomsday (2007) - Financial Information|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Superman-Doomsday#tab=summary|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=The Numbers}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Please keep rewrites within this range.--->\n[[Superman]] and [[Lois Lane]] are romantically involved, but Lois is not happy with him not revealing his secret identity to her. While digging, workers from [[LexCorp]] unearth the spaceship of [[Doomsday (DC Comics)|Doomsday]], a genetically-engineered super-soldier that is highly hostile toward any life form it comes across. It massacres the digging crew and begins a rampage towards [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], killing animals and humans on sight. When Doomsday reaches Metropolis, it decimates the military until Superman arrives. Superman and Doomsday engage in a fierce battle across Metropolis, with Superman eventually winning. But the victory is short-lived as Superman succumbs to his wounds in Lois' arms.\n\n[[Lex Luthor]] kills Mercy Graves, his personal assistant, to ensure no one else knows of LexCorp's involvement with Doomsday's release. The world mourns Superman and Metropolis honors him with a memorial. Superman's friends cope with his death in various ways. [[Jimmy Olsen]] takes a job at a tabloid newspaper ''The National Voyeur'', [[Perry White]] becomes an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], and Lois, having realized that Clark was Superman, visits [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]] for counsel.\n\nIn Superman's absence, Metropolis is overwhelmed by criminals. [[Toyman]] uses a giant mechanical spider to hold children hostage. Lois decides to save them herself, but Toyman tries to kill her and a little girl. Superman digs out of his grave and saves Lois and the girl, apprehending Toyman. He doesn't seem quite the same, but Lois dismisses it as shock. She becomes suspicious, however, when Martha tells her that Clark has not called home.\n\nThe resurrected Superman is revealed to be a [[cloning|clone]] created by Luthor who is keeping the real Superman's body preserved in a tube, unaware that Superman is, barely, still alive. He periodically tortures the clone Superman in a special lead-lined room. A [[Superman robots|robot]] from the Fortress of Solitude detects that Superman is still alive, recovers his body, and begins restoring him to health.\n\nMeanwhile, the clone's attitude darkens when he hears that Toyman killed a child. In retaliation, the clone abducts the villain and kills him in front of the police station. The city is stunned and the clone threatens the populace into abiding by the law. This convinces Lois and Martha that this is not the real Superman.\n\nLex berates the clone, orders him to find Superman's corpse, and threatens to kill him if he misbehaves again. The clone deduces that a lead-shielded [[kryptonite]] pellet is in his brain, and removes it. Lois tranquilizes Luthor and searches his files with Jimmy, discovering that Luthor is cloning an army of Supermen. Lex awakens armed with a gun, but the original clone saves Lois and Jimmy, destroying the cloning facility and the yet-to-be-awakened clones. Luthor hopes to ambush the clone in a panic room, but the clone simply locks him inside and tosses the entire room into the street. This latest presumed murder triggers military action which fails.\n\nSuperman is revived and resolves to confront the clone, although his powers are not fully restored. To improve his odds he dons a \"solar suit\" and brings a Kryptonite gun. The two battle and Lois manages to hit the clone with a kryptonite blast. The clone destroys the gun, but the Kryptonite canister sticks to the clone's chest and Superman vaporizes it with his heat vision. Before dying, the clone tells Superman to protect the people. Lois is sure of the real Superman once he kisses her, and the crowd is similarly happy now that they know that the real Superman is alive. At Lois' apartment, Superman reveals himself to be Clark Kent, and Lois embraces him with elation.\n\nAt LexCorp, Lex is revealed to be critically injured and in a wheelchair, but still alive. He smiles, musing that there may still be a way for him to destroy Superman. <!--- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summaries should remain between 400-700 words.

It was the only film in the series originally released without a special edition.\n\nFollowing a year later was a two-disc special edition DVD release. The special features included a retrospective look at how the ''Death of Superman'' comic came to be, a look at voice actors, as well as a ''Defeat Doomsday'' game with a 10-minute preview to the next animated film; ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]''.\n\nRelease of a [[Blu-ray]] version was announced with a release date of February 26, 2008, but was delayed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Justice-League-New-Frontier-Release-Date/8343 |title=Justice League DVD news: Release Date for Justice League: The New Frontier |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |access-date=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525091939/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Justice-League-New-Frontier-Release-Date/8343 |archive-date=2011-05-25 }}</ref>\n\nWarner Home Video released a new \"Special Edition\" Blu-ray and DVD, featuring new bonus materials on November 25, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=235 |title=Official Artwork And Details For New \"Superman Doomsday\" DVD And Blu-Ray |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref>\n\n===Rating===\nThe film's generous amount of violence and profane language garnered a [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating from the [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]].
