Vincent Grey, a former patient Malcolm had treated for hallucinations, breaks into their house and accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself.\n\nMonths later, Malcolm begins working with Cole Sear, a 9-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with Anna, who has become distant and cold. Cole's mother, Lynn, worries about his social skills, especially after seeing signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, Cole is cornered by bullies who lock him in a cupboard, causing him to scream in terror before passing out. Following this incident, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees ghosts walking around like the living, but they only see what they want to see and are unaware that they are dead.\n\nMalcolm thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case, but after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man tearfully begging for help in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and realizes that the ghosts Cole sees are real. He suggests that Cole try to communicate with the ghosts and help them finish their business, to which Cole hesitantly agrees.\n\nCole awakens one night to discover a ghost girl vomiting. He finds out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. Cole sneaks into the girl's room, where she crawls out from under her bed and gives him a box containing a videotape, which he gives to her father. The tape reveals the girl's mother [[Factitious disorder imposed on another|poisoning her food]], alerting her father to this and saving her younger sister from the same fate.\n\nLearning to not be afraid of the ghosts he sees, Cole begins to fit in at school and is cast as the lead in the school play, with the ghost of a dead teacher helping coach him. He delivers an outstanding performance with Malcolm looking on. Before parting ways with Malcolm, Cole suggests that he try speaking to Anna while she is asleep to communicate better with her.\n\nWhile stuck in traffic, Cole tells his mother his secret and says that someone died in an accident down the road. When Lynn does not believe him, Cole tells her his late grandmother visits him, and describes how she saw Lynn in a dance performance when she was a child, giving details that he could not have known. Cole's mother finally accepts the fact that her son has a special ability and tearfully embraces him.\n\nMalcolm returns home to find Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her, much to his confusion. When she suddenly drops Malcolm's wedding ring, he notices that it is not on his finger. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see and not knowing they are dead, Malcolm finally realizes he did not survive being shot by Vincent and has been dead while working with Cole. He quickly comes to terms with his death and tells Anna that he loves her. She bids him goodnight, indicating that she is now at peace and can move on. With his business finally complete, Malcolm's spirit departs in a flash of light.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Bruce Willis]] as Malcolm Crowe\n*[[Haley Joel Osment]] as Cole Sear\n*[[Toni Collette]] as Lynn Sear\n*[[Olivia Williams]] as Anna Crowe\n*[[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Vincent Grey\n*[[Glenn Fitzgerald]] as Sean\n*[[Mischa Barton]] as Kyra Collins\n*[[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]] as Tommy Tammisimo\n*[[Bruce Norris (playwright)|Bruce Norris]] as Mr. Stanley Cunningham\n*[[Angelica Page]] as Mrs. Collins\n*Greg Wood as Mr. Collins\n*[[M.
