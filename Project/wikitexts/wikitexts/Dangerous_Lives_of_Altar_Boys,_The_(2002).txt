The boys also collaborate on a comic book they call ''The Atomic Trinity''. Interspersed within the film are segments of animated footage based on the comic book.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nFuhrman died of cancer before completing the final revision of the novel.<ref>[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dangerous-lives-of-altar-boys-chris-fuhrman/1100758040?ean=9780820323381 \"The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys.\"] ''Barnes & Noble''.  10 February 2015.</ref> The film, dedicated to his memory, received positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the early 1970s in the suburban town of [[Savannah, Georgia]], the film follows the lives of protagonist Francis Doyle, and three of his friends, Tim Sullivan, Wade Scalisi and Joey Anderson. The four boys all attend a private Catholic school named [[Agatha of Sicily|St. Agatha's]], which they detest. The boys rebel by smoking [[Marijuana|pot]], [[Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States|drinking]], obsessing over girls, listening to [[hard rock]] music and playing pranks on their teachers, such as stealing their school's statue of St. Agatha and keeping it in their clubhouse. The four friends dedicate much of their time to a comic book of their own creation titled ''The Atomic Trinity'' in order to escape the monotony and avoid the difficulties in their own lives.\n\nAfter receiving a love note from Francis, which was actually written by Tim, Margie Flynn becomes a major presence and weaves her way into the lives of these four friends. She and Francis have an obvious connection that progresses into much more. At times, Francis must choose between his friends and Margie, which causes the group of friends to fall apart. The boys' lives are also translated into segments of animation based on the characters of ''The Atomic Trinity'': Brakken, The Muscle, Captain Asskicker and Major Screw; Nunzilla, based on their peglegged, overly repressive Catholic school teacher Sister Assumpta; and Sorcerella, based on Margie Flynn.\n\nAfter a school field trip to the zoo, Tim and Francis have the idea of playing another prank on Sister Assumpta. They decide to drug the cougar at the local zoo and then transport it to Sister Assumpta's office to scare her. When they learn how serious Tim and Francis are, the other half of the ''Atomic Trinity'' wimp out, which leaves an unlikely group of friends consisting of Margie, Tim and Francis. Francis soon learns that Margie had been [[Sibling abuse#Sexual abuse|sexually assaulted by her own brother, Donny]]. During gym class Donny bullies Tim. Tim, out of pressure and his own impulsive nature, insults Donny for molesting his own sister. He regrets telling Donny, who beats him up, and then tells Francis who becomes angry with him. Donny takes Tim and Francis's comic, ''The Atomic Trinity'', and gives it to the nun. The violent, blasphemous and inappropriate drawings in the notebook cause Tim and Francis to be suspended, pending expulsion from the school.\n\nIn an act of final retribution, Tim, Francis, Wade and Joey attempt to steal a cougar to place inside the school to cover up a wrecking of the school they did that night. At the zoo, a makeshift [[tranquilizer]] created from several narcotic drugs is used to put the cougar to sleep. The other three boys go down to the gate to retrieve the cougar in a cage, while Tim impulsively climbs over the fence into the cougar's den. He checks to see if the cougar is alive, and happily replies that it is. When the other boys reach the gate to retrieve the cougar, another cougar leaps at Tim, mauling him to death. At Tim's funeral, Francis quotes the poem \"[[The Tyger]]\" by [[William Blake]], whom Sister Assumpta earlier condemned as a \"dangerous thinker\". Francis places the book at the stolen statue of St. Agatha in their hideout, and starts a new comic series dedicated entirely to the character based on Tim, ''Skeleton Boy''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as Francis Doyle\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Tim Sullivan\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Margie Flynn\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Sister Assumpta\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Father Casey\n* [[Jake Richardson]] as Wade Scalisi\n* Tyler Long as Joey Anderson\n* Arthur Bridges as Donny Flynn\n\n==Production==\nIn order to [[Film adaptation|adapt the book]] effectively, director Care and producer Jay Shapiro decided to use segments of [[animation]] throughout the film. Since most of the book is from Francis' perspective and takes place in his mind, they needed to find a way to stay true to this \"internal narrative\".  \"Animation seemed like a natural way to go in and out of this interior world and use that as the thread that ties everything together,\" says Shapiro.<ref name=\"Care\">Care, P. (2002) ''The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'' [DVD], Culver City, CA: Sony Pictures.</ref> The sequences were created by [[Todd McFarlane]],<ref>Holden, Stephen (June 14, 2002).

''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> and they are visually similar to basic [[superhero]] comic strips. Screenwriter Jeff Stockwell helped to create the storyline for the animated sequences.\n\nCinematography is done by [[Lance Acord]], who also worked on ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' and ''[[Buffalo '66]]''. Production design was done by Gideon Pointe, who also worked on ''Buffalo '66'', as well as ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]''.<ref name=\"Care\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nCasting the characters of Francis Doyle and Tim Sullivan was essential to the film's success. Filmmakers say that [[Emile Hirsch]] was the first actor that had that innocence and naivete that they were looking for. Similarly, filmmakers believed that [[Kieran Culkin]] had a similar personality to Tim. \"I think he is going through a lot of similar things [in his own life],\" states [[Jodie Foster]], producer and star of the film.<ref name=\"Care\" />\n\nNeither filmmakers nor Foster had planned on her also playing the part of the stern Catholic school teacher and headmistress, Sister Assumpta, as well as being producer. Foster was somehow attracted to the role, and called producing partner [[Meg LeFauve]] up with the offer to play this role, who graciously accepted, saying that it's not \"traditional casting to see a young beautiful woman in that kind of a role.\"<ref name=\"Care\" />\n\n===Setting===\nAlthough the novel by [[Chris Fuhrman]] was set in 1970s [[Savannah, Georgia]], the filmmakers wanted a more \"universal look\" and decided not to specify a place.  [[Principal photography]] took place in [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]],<ref name=\"NYT\" /> and lasted from May to July 2000. There was also a lot of debate about whether the characters should have Southern accents, but to keep with this \"universal feeling,\" the producers decided against any strong accents.\n\n==Reception and awards==\nThe film has received fairly good praise for an independent film. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a \"bracingly truthful\" coming-of-age film from the directorial debut of Peter Care.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE4DF153CF937A25755C0A9649C8B63 |work=The New York Times |first=Stephen |last=Holde |date=June 14, 2002|title=Film Review: Altar Boys Will Be Altar Boys, and They're Drawing Comics, Too}}</ref> According to critics, the film takes one back to those awkward stages in life, a place most are not too keen on returning to, with ease and compassion. However, the film does have its flaws, according to a ''New York Times'' reviewer who wrote that \"the movie struggles to compare the boys' comic-book vision with [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' and ''[[Songs of Experience]]'', becoming its one glaringly off-key note.\"<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two and a half stars, calling it \"an honorable film with good intentions.\"<ref name = \"Ebert\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dangerous-lives-of-altar-boys-2002 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys |date=June 21, 2002 |publisher=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>  Ebert goes on to say that the screenplay is trying too hard to impress and falls short of achieving the \"emotional payoff\" it is searching for.<ref name = \"Ebert\" />\n\nIn 2002, the film and director Care won the award for Best New Filmmaker from the [[Boston Society of Film Critics]].
