It also features [[Julie Brown]], [[Blake Clark]], [[Paul Dooley]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Florence Henderson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Adam Sandler]], Scott Herriott, [[LaWanda Page]], [[Jack Gallagher (comedian)|Jack Gallagher]], and a cameo by [[Robin Williams]] as Mime Jerry using the [[pseudonym]] \"Marty Fromage\".\n\nThe film is a satire of performance art and portrays different communities of clowns and other performers as clannish, rivalrous subcultures obsessed with precedence and status. Goldthwait made the film as a satire of the dysfunctional standup comedy circuit at the time he was first starting out as an entertainer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|title=Interview: Bobcat Goldthwait|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/bobcat-goldthwait,31890/|work=[[The A.V.

''Shakes the Clown'' has since become a [[cult film|cult classic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-shakes-the-clown-bobcat-goldthwait/3618589|title = Shakes the Clown}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blazenfluff.com/live-reading-of-shakes-the-clown-with-original-cast-members/3638|title = Live reading of 'Shakes the Clown' with original cast members &#124; Blazenfluff|date = 6 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the fictional town of Palukaville, Shakes ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) is a good natured but depressed and alcoholic birthday-party [[clown]]. After his father died, Shakes was raised by his father's friend, Owen Cheese ([[Paul Dooley]]), who gave Shakes his job as a clown and owns the local clown [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], the Twisted Balloon. Shakes is excited because he auditioned to be the host of a children's clown show on television called the Big Time Cartoon Circus, after its original host, Peppy ([[Sydney Lassick]]), was fired for sexual harassment. Shakes falls deeper into his depression when he learns that he has been passed over for the position in favor of Binky ([[Tom Kenny]]), a [[cocaine]]-addicted clown who is a neurotic and vindictive sexual predator and psychopath.\n\nShakes's clown friends, Dink ([[Adam Sandler]]) and Stenchy ([[Blake Clark]]) are concerned that he drinks too much and often encourage him to quit. On top of that, his alcoholism is damaging his relationship with his girlfriend Judy ([[Julie Brown]]), a waitress in the Twisted Balloon and an aspiring professional [[Bowling|bowler]]. Shakes continually denies the extent of his alcoholism until Cheese finally orders Shakes to sober up, or be fired. Shakes wants to make his father figure proud and is able to get through [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawals]], and for a time, seems to be doing well. However, Shakes suffers a [[relapse]] at a birthday party and trashes the house in a drunken rampage until he is knocked out by the child's mother.\n\nShakes returns to the bar later that night, where Cheese angrily fires him for upsetting the party guests. Ashamed and heavily intoxicated, Shakes goes into the back room and passes out. Judy, Dink and Stenchy are able to convince Cheese to give Shakes another chance, and when he attempts to find Shakes, he instead comes across Binky, his sad clown friends, HoHo and Boots, and some [[rodeo clowns]], Ty and Randi, doing cocaine. Cheese is angered that they would be selling and doing drugs in his bar, and a panicked Binky beats him to death with Shakes' [[juggling club]] in a fit of rage. Shocked, Binky frames Shakes for the murder. \n\nShakes goes on the run. Convinced of his innocence, Judy, Dink and Stenchy decide to help Shakes clear his name. Until he can find the truth, Shakes goes into hiding, posing as a hated [[Mime artist|mime]] in a class taught by the domineering Jerry the Mime ([[Robin Williams]]). Shakes is concerned deep down that he may have actually committed the murder while blacked out and forgot. Later, Shakes, Dink and Stenchy go to a rodeo clown bar called the Broken Saddle, where they learn from the rodeo clowns that Cheese was actually murdered by Binky. Meanwhile, Binky attempts to seduce Judy, who again rebuffs his advances. Binky again gets nervous and accidentally admits to Cheese's murder. Binky knows that he cannot let Judy leave with this information, so he kidnaps her and takes her to the studio where he attempts to kill her live on the air with [[throwing knives]] to make it look like an accident.\n\nThe rodeo clowns are arrested for their involvement, and Shakes, Dink and Stenchy fight Boots and HoHo, which ends with one of the clowns shooting Shakes. Shakes survives, as his flask stopped the bullet. Shakes, Dink and Stenchy arrive at the studio and fight Binky just in time to save Judy, and Binky is arrested for his crimes. Grateful that he saved her life, Judy gets back together with Shakes, and he promises her that he will stop drinking. Some time passes, and Shakes is shown attending an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting, sharing with the others that he is still sober and is proud of his accomplishment. With Binky in jail, Shakes is now the new host of the TV show, which proves to be a big hit with children. Shakes, Dink and Stenchy are the stars of the show and entertain the audience by chasing Jerry the Mime.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Bobcat Goldthwait]] as Shakes the Clown\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Judy\n*[[Adam Sandler]] as Dink the Clown\n*[[Blake Clark]] as Stenchy the Clown\n*[[Tom Kenny]] as Binky the Clown\n*[[Paul Dooley]] as Owen Cheese\n*[[Kathy Griffin]] as Lucy\n*[[Robin Williams]] (as Marty Fromage) as Mime Jerry\n*Paul Kozlowski as HoHo the Clown\n*Dan Spencer as Boots the Clown\n*Jeremy Kramer as Detective Boar\n*[[Jack Gallagher (comedian)|Jack Gallagher]] as Officer Crony\n*[[Bruce Baum]] as Ty the Rodeo Clown\n*[[Greg Travis]] as Randi the Rodeo Clown\n*[[Florence Henderson]] as The Unknown Woman\n*Scott Herriott as Floor Director\n*[[LaWanda Page]] as Female Clown Barfly\n*Martin Charles Warner as Male Clown Barfly\n*[[Johnny Silver]] as Clown Tailor\n*[[Tim Kazurinsky]] as First Party Dad\n*[[Sydney Lassick]] as Peppy the Clown\n*Tony V. as Broken Saddle Bouncer\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Shakes the Clown'' was not a financial success, earning an estimated $115,000 in ticket sales against an estimated budget of $1.4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Box office / business for Shakes the Clown|date=13 March 1992|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102898/business|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCritical reaction to the movie was mixed: [[Leonard Maltin]] gave it his lowest rating, while Betsy Sherman of ''The Boston Globe'' called it \"the ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of alcoholic clown movies\".<ref name=\"BostonG\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/23351092.html?dids=23351092:23351092&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+02%2C+1997&author=Michael+Blowen%2C+Globe+Staff&pub=Boston+Globe&desc=Rigors+of+family+life+are+taming+Bobcat+Goldthwait&pqatl=google|title=Rigors of family life are taming Bobcat Goldthwait|last=Blowen|first=Michael|date=December 2, 1997|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film [[Star (classification)|two out of four stars]], writing that while some isolated scenes were \"very funny\" the plot was scattered and the performances often seemed under-rehearsed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920313/REVIEWS/203130306/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Shakes The Clown |last=Ebert|first=Roger}}</ref> The film has a 41% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 22 reviews, with the consensus; \"''Shakes the Clown'' has a handful of memorable moments, but they're scattered in a movie whose best ideas were left undeveloped on their way to the screen.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Shakes the Clown|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shakes_the_clown/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1991 [[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]] but lost to ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Past Winners Database |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1991/1991st.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106124822/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1991/1991st.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 January 2007 |website=The Envelope at LA Times |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with [[Conan O'Brien]], Goldthwait revealed that [[Martin Scorsese]] had defended the movie from detractors.
