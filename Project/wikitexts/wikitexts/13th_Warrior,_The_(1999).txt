Traveling with his father's old friend, Melchisidek, his caravan is saved from [[Tatars#History|Tatar]] raiders by the appearance of [[Norsemen]]. Taking refuge at their settlement on the [[Volga]] river, communications are established through Melchisidek and Herger, a Norseman who speaks [[Latin]]. From Herger, the two learn that the celebration being held by the Northmen is in fact a funeral for their recently deceased king. Herger also introduces them to one of the king's sons, Buliwyf. Ahmad and Melchisidek then witness a fight in which Buliwyf kills his brother in self defense, which establishes Buliwyf as [[heir apparent]], followed by the [[Viking]] funeral of their dead king, cremated together with a young woman who agreed to accompany him to [[Valhalla]].\n\nThe next day, a young prince named Wulfgar enters the camp requesting Buliwyf's aid: His father's kingdom in the far north is under attack from an ancient evil so frightening that even the bravest warriors dare not name it. The \"angel of death\", a [[v\u00f6lva]] (wisewoman), determines the mission will be successful if thirteen warriors go to face this danger \u2014 but that the thirteenth must not be a Norseman. Ahmad is recruited against his will.\n\nAhmad is initially treated indifferently by the Norsemen, who mock his perceived physical weakness and his small [[Arabian horse]]; however, he earns a measure of respect by quickly learning their language through careful observation, a demonstration of horsemanship, and his ability to write. Buliwyf, already a polyglot, asks Ahmad to teach him how to write in Arabic, cementing their goodwill towards one another, and recognizing Ahmad's analytic nature as an asset to their quest.\n\nReaching King Hrothgar's kingdom, they confirm that their foe is indeed the ancient \"[[Grendel|Wendol]]\", fiends who come with the mist to kill and take human heads. While the group searches through a raided cabin they find a [[Venus figurines|Venus figurine]], said to represent the \"[[Grendel's mother|Mother of the Wendol]]\". On their first night, Hyglak and Ragnar are killed. In a string of clashes, Buliwyf's band gradually deduce that the Wendol are human [[cannibal]]s clothed to look like [[beserker|bears]], who live like [[bear]]s, and think of [[bear worship|themselves as bears]].\n\nTheir numbers dwindling, having also lost Skeld, Halga, Roneth, and Rethel, and their position all but indefensible, they consult an ancient ''v\u00f6lva'' of the village. She tells them to track the Wendol to their lair and destroy their leaders, the \"[[Grendel's mother|Mother of the Wendol]]\", and their warlord who wears \"the horns of power\". Buliwyf and the remaining warriors infiltrate the Wendol cave-complex and kill the Mother, but not before Buliwyf is scratched deeply across the shoulder by her poisoned claw-like fingernail.\n\nAhmad and the last of the Norse warriors escape the caves (but without the injured Helfdane, who opts to stay behind and fight). They return to the village  to prepare for a [[last stand]]. Buliwyf staggers outside before the battle and inspires the warriors with a Viking prayer for the honored dead who will enter [[Valhalla]]. Buliwyf succeeds in killing the Wendol warlord, causing their defeat, before succumbing to the poison.\n\nAhmad witnesses Buliwyf's royal funeral before returning to his homeland, grateful to the Norsemen for helping him to \"become a man and a useful servant of God\". He is seen at the movie's end writing down the tale of his time with them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]\n* [[Diane Venora]] as Queen [[Wealh\u00feeow|Weilew]]\n* [[Vladimir Kulich]] as [[Beowulf (hero)|Buliwyf]] (the Leader)\n* [[Dennis Storh\u00f8i]] as Herger (the Joyous)\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Melchisidek\n* Anders T.

Crichton took over as director himself due to the poor test audience reception, causing the release date to be pushed back over a year. The film was re-cut, a new ending added, along with a new score. [[Graeme Revell]] was replaced by [[Jerry Goldsmith]] as composer. The title was changed to ''The 13th Warrior''.<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/15-directors-unceremoniously-fired-or-replaced-on-a-movie-20130322?page=2#blogPostHeaderPanel \"15 Directors Unceremoniously Fired Or Replaced On A Movie\", ''The Playlist'' 22 March 2013] accessed 27 March 2013</ref>\n\nThe budget, which was originally around $85 million, reportedly soared to $100 million before principal photography concluded. With all of the re-shoots and promotional expenses, the total cost of the film was rumored to be as high as $160 million, which given its lackluster box office take (earning US$61.7 million worldwide), made for a loss of $70\u2013130 million.<ref name=\"Dirks (2010)\">{{cite web |last=Dirks |first=Tim |title=Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time \u2013 1999 |work=[[Filmsite.org]] |url=http://www.filmsite.org/greatestflops19.html |access-date=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film debuted at No. 2 on its opening weekend behind ''[[The Sixth Sense]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Summer's Other Hitting Streak : The major studios are on a record pace, slugging at least 11 films into $100-million territory.
