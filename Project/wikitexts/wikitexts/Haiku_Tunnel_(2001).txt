However, by the time his agency places him at the Schuyler & Mitchell [[law firm]], Josh is tired of his temporary life and agrees to take a permanent position at the firm. Josh has difficulty adapting to his new lifestyle, which manifests in his inability to complete his simple initial task: [[mail]]ing seventeen important letters.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Josh Kornbluth]] as himself\n* [[Warren Keith]] as Bob 'Bob' Shelby\n* Amy Resnick as Mindy\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Orientation Instructor\n* Leah Alperin as Temp #1\n* Jacob Kornbluth as Temp #2\n* Stephen Muller as Temp #3\n* Linda Norton as Temp #4\n* Helen Shumaker as Marlina D'Amore\n* Sarah Overman as Julie Faustino\n* Brian Thorstenson as Clifford\n* [[June Carryl|June Lomena]] as DaVonne\n* Joanne Evangelista as Caryl\n* Jennifer Laske as Helen the Ex-Girlfriend\n* Patricia Scanlon as Helen the Ex-Secretary\n* Joe Bellan as Jimmy the Mail Clerk\n* Michael X.
