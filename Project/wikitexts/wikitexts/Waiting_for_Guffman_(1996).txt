The film's ensemble cast includes Guest, Levy, [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Fred Willard]], and [[Parker Posey]].\n\nThe film's title is a reference to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. As in the other mockumentary films created by Guest, the majority of the dialogue was improvised (based on Guest and Levy's story). Because the film is about the production of a stage musical, it contains several original musical numbers written by Guest, [[Michael McKean]], and [[Harry Shearer]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the fictional small town of Blaine, [[Missouri]], a few residents prepare to put on a community theater production led by eccentric director Corky St. Clair. The show, a musical chronicling the town's history titled ''Red, White and Blaine'', is to be performed as part of the town's 150th-anniversary celebration.\n\nCast in the leads are Ron and Sheila Albertson, married travel agents who are also regular amateur performers; Libby Mae Brown, a perky [[Dairy Queen]] employee; Clifford Wooley, a \"long time Blaineian\" and retired taxidermist, who is ''Red, White and Blaine''{{'}}s narrator; Johnny Savage, a handsome and oblivious mechanic, whom Corky goes out of his way to get into the play; and Dr. Allan Pearl, a tragically square dentist determined to discover his inner entertainer. High-school teacher Lloyd Miller is the show's increasingly frustrated musical director.\n\nCorky has used connections from his \"[[Off-Off-Broadway|off-off-off-off-Broadway]]\" past to invite Mort Guffman, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producer, to critique ''Red, White and Blaine''. Corky leads the cast to believe that a positive review from Guffman could mean their show might go all the way to Broadway.\n\nThe program itself is designed to musically retell the history of Blaine, whose founding father was a buffoon incapable of distinguishing the geography of middle [[Missouri]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastline. The viewer also learns why the town obtusely refers to itself as \"the stool capital of the United States.\" The music is a series of poorly performed songs such as \"Nothing Ever Happens on Mars\", a reference to the town's supposed visit by an [[unidentified flying object]], and \"Stool Boom\". (The DVD contains \"This Bulging River\" and \"Nothing Ever Happens in Blaine\", which were edited from the cinema release.)\n\nCentral to the film are Corky's [[stereotype|stereotypically]] [[gay]] mannerisms. He supposedly has a wife called Bonnie, whom no one in Blaine has ever met or seen. He uses her to explain his habit of shopping for women's clothing and shoes.\n\nWhen Johnny is forced by his suspicious father to quit the show, Corky takes over his roles, which were clearly intended for a young, masculine actor, playing a lusty young frontiersman, a heartbroken soldier, and a little boy wearing a beanie and shorts. Corky never sheds his dainty demeanor, bowl haircut, lisp, or earring in spite of his historical roles, and his face is pasted with an overkill of [[Theatrical makeup|stage rouge and eyeliner]].\n\nCorky is also faced with creating his magic on a shoestring budget, at one point quitting the show after storming out of a meeting with the city council, which turns down his request for $100,000 to finance the production, but the distraught cast and persuasive city fathers convince Corky to return. At the show's performance, Guffman's seat is seen to be empty, much to the dismay of the cast. Corky reassures them that Broadway producers always arrive a bit late for the show, and sure enough, a man soon takes Guffman's reserved seat. The show is well received by the audience, whereupon Corky invites the assumed Guffman backstage to talk to the actors.\n\nThe man is actually Roy Loomis, who has come to Blaine to witness the birth of his niece's baby, but he did enjoy the show. Corky then reads a telegram stating that Guffman's plane was grounded by snowstorms in New York City, meaning that, like the \"Godot\" being spoofed, the real Guffman himself is destined never to arrive.\n\nAn epilogue shows the fates of the cast: Libby Mae is now living in Sipes, Alabama, where she moved after her father was paroled, and working at the Dairy Queen. Allan and the Albertsons have pursued their dreams of being entertainers, Ron and Sheila traveling to [[Los Angeles, California]], to work as extras, and Allan now performing for elderly [[Jew]]s in [[Miami, Florida]] retirement communities. Corky has returned to New York City, where he has opened a Hollywood-themed novelty shop, which includes such items as [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] [[bobblehead]] [[doll]]s, ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'' [[action figures]], and ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'' lunch boxes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Corky St. Clair\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Dr. Allan Pearl\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Ron Albertson\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Sheila Albertson\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Libby Mae Brown\n* [[Lewis Arquette]] as Clifford Wooley\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Lloyd Miller\n* [[Matt Keeslar]] as Johnny Savage\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Steve Stark\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Mayor Glenn Welsch\n* [[David Cross]] as UFO Expert\n* [[Linda Kash]] as Mrs. Pearl\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as \"Red\" Savage\n* [[Paul Benedict]] as Roy Loomis\n* [[Paul Dooley]] as UFO Abductee\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was shot in [[Lockhart, Texas]], a town located 30 miles south of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Christopher Guest wanted to put a \"Stool capital of the world\" sign up over the town, but he was not granted permission to do so.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Additional shooting took place in Los Angeles, including the scenes set in Corky St. Clair's apartment.<ref name=\"commentary\">Guest, Christopher, Levy, Eugene. ''Waiting for Guffman'' commentary, 2001.</ref>\n\nAs in the other mockumentary films created by Guest, the majority of the dialogue is improvised. Matt Keeslar was the only cast member with no history of doing improvisational acting.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Guest compares the process to jazz music: \"You know the basic melody and the key changes, but it's how you get from one change to the next that matters, and you don't know in advance how you're going to do it. I'm completely blank before the camera rolls. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to say.\" Guest shoots 10-minute-long scenes and allows improvisations to unfold organically. He ends up with almost 60 hours of film, and takes over a year to edit it down to about 90 minutes.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{cite news |date= January 10, 2004 |author= Richard Grant |newspaper= [[The Guardian Weekend]] |title= Nowt so queer as folk  |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/10/features.weekend |archive-url=  https://web.archive.org/web/20161219172254/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/10/features.weekend |archive-date= December 19, 2016 |url-status= live |access-date= September 9, 2019 }}</ref> A two-hour workprint version of ''Waiting for Guffman'' has circulated among fans, which includes some of the original footage that was edited out.\n\n==Release and reception==\nAfter being shown at the Toronto and Boston film festivals in late 1996, it received a US theatrical release, playing in roughly 50 theaters beginning on January 31, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/12988 |title=Christopher Guest |publisher=Charlierose.com |date= |access-date=2021-02-02}}</ref> The only other country it received a theatrical release in was Australia, during September 1997.<ref>''[[The Age]]'', September 26, 1997, p. 55</ref> It had earlier been shown at the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] on August 4, 1997.\n\nTo promote the film, Guest made appearances on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and the [[NBC]] talk show ''[[Later (talk show)|Later]]'' during February 1997.\n\n''Waiting for Guffman'' received a 91% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10.
