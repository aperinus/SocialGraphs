The first part, ''[[Everything Will Be OK]]'', was released in 2006 and received the Grand Prize at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The second short, ''[[I Am So Proud of You]]'', was released in 2008, and the titular third film, ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'', was released in 2011. The three short films received over 90 film festival awards upon their original releases.<ref name=\"TV Guide\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/its-such-a-beautiful-day/review/2000068210|title=TV Guide}}</ref> In 2012, Hertzfeldt seamlessly edited all three chapters together and it was released as a new feature film.\n\nMany film critics listed the feature film version as one of the best films of 2012, and the L.A. Film Critics Association named it runner-up for Best Animated Film of the year.<ref name=Vimeo>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/ondemand/itssuchabeautifulday|title=Vimeo}}</ref> Since then, ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' has appeared on several film critics' \"Best Of\" lists, including #1 on the Film Stage's list of \"The 50 Best Animated Films of the 21st Century Thus Far\", #1 on The Wrap's list of the \"Best Animated Films of the 2010s\", and #1 on IGN's list of the \"Top 10 Animated Films of All Time\".<ref name=\"Vimeo\" />\n\nThe movie tells the story of a character named Bill, who struggles with failing memory and [[surrealism|surreal]] visions, among other symptoms of an unknown neurological problem. The film employs both offbeat humor and serious philosophical musings.\n\n== Plot ==\nBill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by [[Don Hertzfeldt]]). Bill suffers from an unnamed illness which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his ex-girlfriend and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. He begins to have intense hallucinations and becomes sicker.\n\nTo recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him. Bill is then taken to a hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill will not die, surprising and inconveniencing his relatives. Bill then goes back to work.\n\nThe film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall, who disappeared into the sea as a child. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home, eventually causing Bill's stepfather to leave. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, many of whom died young in odd or unpleasant ways.\n\nA few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died in a \"fit of senile hysterics.\" Bill sees his doctor again, unexpectedly finding nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him. Bill is again taken to the hospital, where his ex-girlfriend frequently visits him. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life. Bill has a brain exam, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical.\n\nBill's doctor explains that Bill is having trouble understanding past tense and present tense, and it is implied that many of his childhood memories and family history could have been [[confabulated]]. Bill is allowed to go home for family care but, when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. He starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and he does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live.\n\nBill's outlook on life starkly changes, and he notices more of life's small details. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives to his childhood home on instinct. His uncle gives him an address to where he can find his real father, whom he has not seen since childhood. Bill shares a tender moment with his father, forgiving him. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the screen cuts to black.\n\nThe Narrator realizes that Bill may die there and refuses to believe that he will. Instead, Bill seems to become immortal. He outlives the human race and the earth's future inhabitants, surviving until the slow death of the universe, watching the stars blink out one at a time.\n\n== Production ==\n\nSix years in the making, the completed picture was captured entirely in camera on a 35mm rostrum [[animation stand]]. Built in the 1940s and used by Hertzfeldt on every project since 1999, it was one of the last surviving cameras of its kind still operating worldwide. The picture blended traditional hand-drawn animation, experimental optical effects, trick photography, and digital hybrids that were printed for photography, one frame at a time.<ref name=Vimeo />\n\nThe film's signature \"split screen\" effect was achieved by framing the drawn animation through tiny holes placed beneath the camera lens during photography, with each element in the film frame individually composited through careful multiple exposures.<ref name=Vimeo />\n\nTowards the end of production of the final chapter, the old camera's motor began to fail. It could no longer advance the film properly, riddling the final reels with unintentional light leaks.<ref name=Vimeo />\n\n== Release ==\n\nThe three chapters of the film were originally produced and released as three animated short films, photographed entirely on 35mm film with in-camera special effects. The three short films were edited together and re-released for the first time as the full-length ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' in 2012.\n\nThe first installment, ''[[Everything Will Be OK]]'', was released theatrically in 2006 and won the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Prize for Short Film. Despite the film's short running length, ''Variety'' film critic Robert Koehler named ''Everything Will Be OK'' one of the \"Best Films of 2007\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://filmjourney.weblogger.com/discuss/msgReader$3949 |title=filmjourney.org : Robert Koehler's Best of 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203103009/http://filmjourney.weblogger.com/discuss/msgReader$3949 |archive-date=February 3, 2008 }}</ref> The film was extremely well received by critics, describing it as \"essential viewing\" and, \"simply one of the finest shorts produced over the past few years, be it animated or not.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/animationshowvol3.php|title=DVD-Verdict review|work=DVD Verdict|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/ok.html|title=Reviews|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> The Boston Globe called the film a \"masterpiece\" with the Boston Phoenix declaring Hertzfeldt a \"genius.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitterfilms.com/ok.html|title=everything will be ok|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> The short film was a cover story on the Chicago Reader, receiving four stars from critic J.R. Jones.\n\n''Everything Will Be OK'' advanced to the final round of voting for Best Animated Short Film at the 2007 [[Academy Awards]], but did not make the final list of five nominees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/old-brew/2007-animated-short-oscar-shortlist-2427.html|title=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n\nOutside of theaters, ''Everything Will Be OK'' was first released as a limited edition DVD \"single\" in 2007. The DVD featured an extensive \"archive\" of over 100 pages of deleted scenes, Don's production notes, sketches, and layouts, as well as a hidden [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] that plays an alternate, narration-free version of the film to highlight the sound design.<ref name=EWBOKDVD>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015MPFAW|title=EWBOKDVD|website=Amazon}}</ref>\n\nThe second installment, ''[[I Am So Proud of You]]'' was released theatrically in 2008. It continued the dark and philosophical humor of the first film, seeing Bill's recovery haunted by the apparently genetic inevitability of his mental illness, the lack of control over his own fate, and the sudden death of a loved one. The short suggests \"simultaneous\" connections throughout time, through his strange family history, his childhood, the present, and his old age.\n\nFor the first time, Hertzfeldt embarked on a solo tour with the film, presenting a special \"Evening with Don Hertzfeldt\" program in multiple cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2008/10/shorts-column-don-hertzfeldt-tours-the-nation-with-his-most-ambitious-short-ever-71468/|title=\"Don Hertzfeldt tours the nation\"}}</ref>\n\n''I Am So Proud of You'' received similar critical praise and received 27 film festival awards, including the Grand Jury Prize at the Florida Film Festival and the Golden Starfish at the Hamptons Film Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitterfilms.com/proud.html|title=\"I Am So Proud of You\" awards list}}</ref>\n\nDirector [[David Lowery (director)|David Lowery]] wrote, \"''I Am So Proud Of You'' is, I think, as good a pick as any for film of the year... full of grand and complex thoughts about life and death and bodily fluids and years rapidly advancing, coming to ends and beginnings, back and forth, over and over, until one slips indistinguishably into the next.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.road-dog-productions.com/weblog/2008/12/things_ill_reme.html|title=Ones To Remember|last=Lowery|first=David|date=December 30, 2008|website=Road Dog Productions|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191304/http://www.road-dog-productions.com/weblog/2008/12/things_ill_reme.html|archive-date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Chris Robinson, author and director of the Ottawa International Animation Festival described ''I Am So Proud of You'' as \"a masterpiece.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.seattlepi.com/bluenotesmusic/2008/10/05/don-hertzfeld-performs-the-grand-illusion/|title=Don Hertzfeld performs The Grand Illusion|last=Tyson|date=October 5, 2008|website=SeattlePi|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201192530/https://blog.seattlepi.com/bluenotesmusic/2008/10/05/don-hertzfeld-performs-the-grand-illusion/|archive-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFollowing its theatrical release, a DVD \"single\" of ''I Am So Proud of You'' was released in August 2009, featuring another extensive \"archive\" of production materials.<ref name=ProudDVD>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JOS9U2 |title=ProudDVD|website=Amazon}}</ref>\n\nThe final chapter of the trilogy, ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'', was released in 2011, winning several awards, including a Special Jury Prize from the Hiroshima Animation Festival.<ref name=IMDBawards>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2078648/awards/ |title=IMDBawards|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, Hertzfeldt again toured the United States and Canada to support the final chapter in another \"Evening with Don Hertzfeldt\" program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitterfilms.com/poster-2012.jpg|title=Tour poster}}</ref> While this theatrical program presented all three of the short films together for the first time, it still presented them as individual shorts, not yet as a unified feature film.\n\nThe final, unified feature film version, ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'', shared the same title as the third short film and had a more limited theatrical release in 2012.

It's an unmistakably cardiac event that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed to make me feel this way? In the hands of a master, yes.
