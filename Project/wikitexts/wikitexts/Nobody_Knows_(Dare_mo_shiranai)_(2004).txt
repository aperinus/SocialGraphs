They are half-siblings, with each of them having different fathers. Because the three youngest children are in the apartment illegally without the landlord's knowledge or permission, they cannot go outside or be seen in the apartment, and they do not attend school. Their mother leaves them alone for weeks, and finally does not return. Forced over time to survive on their own,<ref name=\"pia1\" /> they can only rely on each other to face the multiple challenges in front of them.\n\n''Nobody Knows'' was first shown at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]] on 12 May 2004. It was subsequently released in Japanese cinemas on 7 August 2004.<ref name=\"pia1\" /> The film was well received by critics, and it grossed over US$11 million worldwide.

Only the eldest, Akira, is known to the landlord; he and his mother Keiko smuggle the youngest boy and girl, Shigeru and Yuki, into the apartment inside suitcases. The elder sister, Ky\u014dko, comes separately by train. Each of the children have different fathers. Their mother does not allow them to go to school or be seen by others, and only Akira is allowed to go outside.\n\nAfter a few months, Keiko tells Akira that she has a new boyfriend, and that after she gets married, the children can lead normal lives, but Akira seems doubtful. Without warning, Keiko leaves home and is away for months, leaving only a small amount of money for the children. Akira is forced to take charge of paying the rent and other expenses and caring for his younger siblings. When they run out of money, Akira goes to see several men who may be Yuki's biological father and asks them for money.\n\nAt length, Keiko returns, bringing all the children gifts, but soon leaves again. Though she promises she will be back in time for Christmas, she breaks this promise, and the season changes to the New Year and then to spring without her returning, forcing Akira and Ky\u014dko into the roles of surrogate parents. Akira soon finds evidence that she has already married and left them forever, though he does not tell his siblings. Again running out of money, they are unable to pay their rent any longer and subsist on inexpensive food from the convenience store. On Yuki's birthday, she asks to go outside to wait for their mother at the train station. The siblings enjoy a day out together, and though their mother does not return, Akira promises Yuki that one day he will take her on the [[Tokyo Monorail]] to see the airplanes take off at [[Haneda Airport]].\n\nAkira befriends two boys his own age at a game arcade who start frequenting the family's apartment, playing games and roughhousing, and he begins to neglect his siblings. The apartment is falling into disrepair with no one cleaning or keeping up with other chores. When Akira and the two boys go to the convenience store one day, they dare him to shoplift. Akira refuses, and the two boys leave him. Several months later, when the two have entered junior high school, Akira comes by their school and invites them over to play, but they refuse, and Akira overhears them saying that his house smells like garbage. In an apologetic gesture, Akira takes his siblings to a nearby park to play and buys them candy and toys at the convenience store. They start a garden on the veranda of the apartment, planting seeds from wildflowers inside instant noodle cups.\n\nEventually the electricity, gas, and water in the apartment are all turned off. The children start using the public park's toilet to wash themselves and the tap there for their water. On one of these visits, Shigeru starts a conversation with Saki, a high school student who is cutting class, which blossoms into a friendship between her and the siblings, and she begins to visit them and help Akira and Kyoko care for the family. However, when she tries to help Akira out of financial difficulties by offering him money obtained through [[enjo k\u014dsai]], Akira rejects it and runs away.\n\nWith summer approaching, the children have little money and are growing weary. Akira goes out one day to watch a junior high school's baseball match. The team's coach spots him and, short a player, asks him to sub in. Akira joins the game and enjoys playing baseball. While he is away, Yuki falls from a stool while trying to reach for something and dies. Akira goes to find Saki again, finally accepting her offer of financial support, and they buy as many boxes as they can find of Yuki's favorite chocolate candies, which they place with Yuki's dead body in a suitcase. With Saki's help, Akira takes the suitcase to a field near Haneda Airport's runway. They sit and watch planes come in, and then he and Saki dig a grave and bury the suitcase. They then return to the apartment, and the film ends with Akira, Ky\u014dko, Shigeru, and Saki still together, walking home.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Y\u016bya Yagira]] as {{nihongo|Akira Fukushima |\u798f\u5cf6\u660e}},<ref name=\"goo2\">{{cite web|url=http://movie.goo.ne.jp/contents/movies/MOVCSTD5312/staff.html|title=goo movie cast|publisher=goo movie|access-date=31 May 2011|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927142635/http://movie.goo.ne.jp/contents/movies/MOVCSTD5312/staff.html|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> the eldest son, age twelve.

He avoided sentiment, aiming for a more stoic picture.<ref name=\"thejapantimes2\" /> This is because he wanted the audience to \"take away something\" from the film.<ref name=\"thejapantimes2\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe director Hirokazu Kore-eda held extensive auditions to cast the four children, and the actors were all nonprofessionals.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> Also, during the casting, a little girl came in with noisy sandals. The director liked it so much that he brought it over to Yuki's character when searching for her mother. He also did not give the children detailed explanations of their roles, because he wanted them to be natural.<ref name=\"thejapantimes2\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe filming took over a year, lasting from autumn 2002 to summer 2003. The reel was filmed chronologically and 70% of the story was set in a cramped Tokyo apartment (with every room built specifically for the film). The apartment was specially rented for a year for the filming of this film, and the filming assistants lived in the apartment when it was not used for filming.<ref name=\"cinematoday2\">{{Cite web | script-title=ja:\u30ab\u30f3\u30cc\u6620\u753b\u796d\u3067\u8a71\u984c\u306e\u300e\u8ab0\u3082\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u300f\u4e00\u822c\u306b\u521d\u62ab\u9732 | work = WELVA CORP | publisher = Cinema Today | date = 1 July 2004 | url = http://www.cinematoday.jp/page/N0005021 | access-date = 2011-06-02|language=ja}}</ref> Director Hirokazu Kore-eda said that during the long filming period, he tried to build a relationship of trust between himself and the children, and also amongst the children themselves.<ref name=\"thejapantimes2\">{{Cite web | last = Schilling| first = Mark | title = No easy answers from Kore-eda | work = The Japan Times | publisher = The Japan Times | date = 25 August 2004 | url = http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20040825a4.html | access-date = 2011-06-03}}</ref> During the children's filming breaks, the children were asked to write in their own journal entries about what they were thinking, ranging from the film to their own everyday concerns.\n\n===Post-production===\n''Nobody Knows'' held its first public screening at the ''Le Theatre'' in [[Ginza, Tokyo]] on June 30, 2004 after the film debuted at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.<ref name=\"cinematoday2\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack for the movie was written by the Japanese guitar duo [[Gontiti]].\n\nThe ending song, \"H\u014dseki\", was sung by Takako Tate, who also appears in the film.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Film festivals===\n''Nobody Knows'' competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May 2004.<ref name=\"eiga1\">{{cite web | url=http://eiga.com/news/20040427/9/ |script-title=ja:\u30ab\u30f3\u30cc\u51fa\u54c1\u4f5c\u304c\u767a\u8868\u3002\u65e5\u672c\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u304c\u521d\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30da\u53c2\u52a0\uff01 |access-date=2011-06-03 |work= eiga.com |language=ja}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nA DVD of ''Nobody Knows'' was released in Japan on 11 March 2005.<ref name=\"amazon1\">{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0002PPXQY |title= \u8ab0\u3082\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044 [DVD] on Amazon Japan |access-date=2011-06-02 |work= Amazon.com, Inc |language=ja}}</ref> It was released in DVD (region 2) format, and it has both English and Japanese subtitles.<ref name=\"amazon1\" /> Separately, the ''Making of Nobody Knows'' DVD, which contains 41 minutes' worth of film taken during the filming of ''Nobody Knows'', was released on 23 December 2004.<ref name=\"amazon2\">{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%80%8C%E8%AA%B0%E3%82%82%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%89%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E3%80%8D%E3%81%8C%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%82%8B%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A7-DVD-%E6%9F%B3%E6%A5%BD%E5%84%AA%E5%BC%A5/dp/B00069BPEA|title= \u300c\u8ab0\u3082\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u300d\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u307e\u3067 on Amazon Japan |access-date=2011-06-02 |work= Amazon.com, Inc |date= 23 December 2004 |language=ja}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Nobody Knows'' has received widespread acclaim from critics.
