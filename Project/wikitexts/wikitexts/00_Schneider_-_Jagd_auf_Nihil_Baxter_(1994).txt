It was released on 22 December 1994.\n\nHe wrote the [[screenplay|script]] as well as the music, did [[film direction]], and played the main character and several additional roles.\n\n==Plot==\nThe funny clown Bratislav Metulskie is found dead in circus \"Apollo\". The retired commissioner 00 Schneider is asked to assume control of the case. Schneider and his aged sidekick K\u00f6rschgen investigate to find the murderer, Nihil Baxter, a passionate art collector who is a little nuts and does not cultivate social contacts at all. Commissioner Schneider investigates at the circus and pays Baxter a visit. Baxter makes up an alibi and claims that he was working on a painting when the murder took place. The Sidekick K\u00f6rschgen finds out that the picture is an imitation. When Baxter tries to escape to [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] by plane after he stole a sculpture from the practice of Dr. Hasenbein, 00 Schneider and his sidekick are also on board. As they are incognito, they are able to arrest the criminal with the help of the world-famous \"sniffer dog nose\" pilot.\n\n==Main Cast== \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109000/fullcredits?ref_=ttspec_sa_1|title=IMDb Cast & Crew|website=[[IMDb]] }}</ref>\n*[[Helge Schneider]] - 00 Schneider/Nihil Baxter/Professor Hasenbein/Johnny Flash\n*[[Helmut K\u00f6rschgen]] - K\u00f6rschgen\n*Andreas Kunze - Friend of 00 Schneider\n*[[Werner Abrolat]] - Chief of Police\n*[[Bratislav Metulskie]] - Metulskie\n*Guenther Kordas - Ringmaster\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|title=00 Schneider - Jagd auf Nihil Baxter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:00 Schneider - Jagd auf Nihil Baxter}}\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1994 comedy films]]\n[[Category:German comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s German-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s German films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-Germany-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
