It is an adaptation of the 2002 children's book ''[[Zathura]]'' by [[Chris Van Allsburg]], author of the 1981 children's book ''[[Jumanji (picture book)|Jumanji]]''. It is a standalone [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the 1995 film ''[[Jumanji (1995 film)|Jumanji]]'' and the second installment of the [[Jumanji (franchise)|''Jumanji'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Jonah Bobo]], [[Dax Shepard]], [[Kristen Stewart]], and [[Tim Robbins]].\n\nThe story is about two squabbling brothers, Danny and Walter Budwing (portrayed by Bobo and Hutcherson respectively), who find a mysterious board game in the basement, which transports their house into outer space. Along with their older sister Lisa (Stewart) and an astronaut (Shepard), they try to survive the game so they can return home.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Culver City, California]], and was released on November 11, 2005 in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Van Allsburg |first=Chris |date=November 2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-618-25396-8 |title=Zathura : a space adventure |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/zathuraspaceadve00vana_1 }}</ref> Unlike ''Jumanji'', which was distributed by [[TriStar Pictures]], the film was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], which is co-owned with TriStar through [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]]. It received positive reviews from critics, but was not commercially successful, grossing $65.1 million worldwide against a production budget of $65 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nWalter and Danny are two brothers who do not get along with each other or with their cantankerous teenage sister, Lisa. While their divorced father is away at work and Lisa, whom he left in charge, is napping, Danny discovers an old [[science fiction]]-themed board game called ''Zathura'' in the basement. When he starts playing, the game produces a card that details a [[meteor shower]]. After an actual meteor shower occurs in the living room, Walter and Danny realize the game is affecting reality.\n\nThe boys discover the house is floating in outer space. Lisa thinks she has overslept because of the dark sky and prepares to go out, however the next card puts her in [[Cryonics|cryonic]] sleep, leaving her frozen solid. Walter soon concludes they must win the game to return everything to normal. As they continue to play, Walter and Danny overcome the dangers presented by the game, including the appearance of a defective robot, passing too close to a star, and an attack on the house by a race of reptilian [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] called Zorgons. One of Danny's turns causes an astronaut to appear, who methodically eliminates the house's heat sources, as the Zorgons are attracted to heat.  The astronaut lures the Zorgons' ship away by setting the boys' father's couch on fire and ejecting it from the house.\n\nWalter demands that the astronaut leave, but Danny chooses to let him stay. Growing increasingly agitated, Walter accuses Danny of cheating of moving his piece prematurely; when he tries to move the piece back and takes his next turn, the game reacts as if Walter were cheating and ejects him from the house, but the astronaut rescues him. Danny apologizes to Walter, but he does not forgive. On Walter's next turn, he receives a card that allows him to make a wish, resulting in another heated argument between the boys. The astronaut warns Walter not to make a wish out of anger. \n\nFearing the worst, the astronaut is relieved to discover that Walter merely wished for an autographed football. He explains his origins, saying that he and his brother had played the game before. He received the wish card, but after an escalating fight, he wished his brother was never born. This resulted in him being stranded, as he was unable to finish the game without the second player. Upon hearing this, Danny and Walter finally put their differences aside.\n\nLisa awakens from her stasis and, still oblivious to the situation, turns up the heat. The Zorgons return and anchor their ships to the house. Lisa finally discovers the predicament and the quartet hide, only to realize that they left the game behind. Danny finds the game aboard one of the Zorgon ships, but is spotted. Walter uses a \"Reprogram\" card he drew earlier to fix the robot, who attacks the Zorgons instead, causing them to retreat.\n\nWalter receives another wish card; he uses it to bring the astronaut's brother back into existence. The astronaut reveals he is actually an older version of Walter from an alternate timeline and commends his past self for making a better choice than he did. The astronaut and the alternate Danny merge with their counterparts as the timeline changes.\n\nThe Zorgons return to the house with a massive fleet, with the intent of destroying it. When Danny makes the winning move, it is revealed that Zathura is a [[black hole]], which proceeds to consume the Zorgons' fleet and the house. The siblings find themselves back in the house as it was before the brothers started the game, just as their father returns home. Their bond renewed, they promise to each other and Lisa to not tell anyone about the game and their adventure.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- [[WP:FILMCAST]] Names and order according to the End credits of the film -->\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Walter \n* [[Jonah Bobo]] as Danny \n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Astronaut\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Lisa \n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Dad\n* [[Frank Oz]] as the voice of Robot\n\nAdditionally, John Alexander performed as the Robot, [[Derek Mears]] as Lead Zorgon, and [[Douglas Tait (stuntman)|Douglas Tait]], Joe Bucaro, and Jeff Wolfe, portray individual Zorgons.\n\n== Production ==\nDirector [[Jon Favreau]] acknowledged the influence of other films saying ''Zathura'' had some bits like ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones]]'', ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'', and ''[[Superman]]''.<ref name=\"Savlov\">{{cite web |date=November 11, 2005 |last=Savlov |first=Marc |title=Anything Can Happen: Jon Favreau and Dax Shepard on Zathura |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2005-11-11/anything-can-happen-jon-favreau-and-dax-shepard-on-zathura/ |website=Austin Chronicle}}</ref> Favreau was aware of Dax Shepard from the TV series ''[[Punk'd]]'' but was convinced to cast him because Mike Judge put him in ''[[Idiocracy]]'' and because of his background in improvisation with [[The Groundlings]] that [[Will Ferrell]] had also come out of.<ref name=\"Savlov\" />\n\nFavreau preferred to use practical effects instead of [[computer generated imagery]] (CGI) in the film.
