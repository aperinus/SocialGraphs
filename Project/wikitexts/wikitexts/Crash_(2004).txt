A self-described \"passion piece\" for Haggis, the film features racial and social tensions in [[Los Angeles]] and was inspired by a real-life incident in which Haggis's [[Porsche]] was [[Carjacking|carjacked]] in 1991 outside a video store on [[Wilshire Boulevard]].<ref>''Crash'' DVD Commentary Track. 2005.</ref> The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Don Cheadle]] (who also worked as a producer on the film), [[Matt Dillon]], [[Jennifer Esposito]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Terrence Howard]], [[Ludacris|Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges]], [[Thandiwe Newton]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]].\n\n''Crash'' first premiered at the [[2004 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2004 before it was released in theaters on May 6, 2005, by [[Lions Gate Films]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the direction and performances (particularly Dillon's), but criticized the portrayal of [[Racism in the United States|race relations]] as simplistic and unsubtle. The film was a success at the box office, earning $98.4 million worldwide against its $6.5 million budget.\n\nThe film earned several accolades and nominations. Dillon received nominations for Best Supporting Actor from the Academy Awards, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild. Additionally, the cast won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]. The film received six [[Academy Award]] nominations, and controversially won three for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]]. It was also nominated for nine BAFTA Awards and won two, for [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for Newton.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Los Angeles, Detective Graham Waters and his partner Ria are involved in a minor collision with a car being driven by Kim Lee. A subsequent exchange of racially-charged insults occurs. Waters later arrives at a crime scene, where the body of a \"dead kid\" has been discovered.\n\nAnthony and Peter [[carjack]] [[District Attorney]] Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. As the men drive away, they see Waters and Ria investigating the death of a man killed by Detective Conklin. Conklin claims he fired in self defense, but Waters and Ria discover that the man he shot was a fellow officer.\n\nAt home, Cabot rails that the car-jacking incident could cost him re-election, because no matter whom he sides with, he will lose either the black vote or the [[law and order]] vote. Hispanic [[locksmith]] Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean, who suspects that Daniel is a gangster, demanding that the locks be changed again.\n\nSergeant John Ryan and his partner, Officer Tom Hansen, pull over a [[SUV]] driven by director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, after she appears to perform [[fellatio]] on Cameron while he is driving; Ryan molests Christine during the stop.\n\nHansen goes to his superior to report Ryan's conduct and request a transfer. The superior officer berates Hansen, knowing that upsetting the department's status quo will tarnish his career, despite the obstacles he has had to overcome to reach the higher ranks of the LAPD.\n\nIn the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit Lee's husband while passing a parked van. They dump him in front of a hospital and drive away.\n\nWaters, while having sex with Ria, gets a phone call from his mother, which leads to an argument about Ria's ethnicity. Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.\n\nRyan comes across a car crash and finds Christine trapped in an overturned vehicle. Recognizing Ryan, she resists frantically, but he pulls her out just before the car explodes.\n\nWaters is summoned to a meeting with DA worker Flanagan, who tells Waters that Internal Affairs has discovered that Conklin has two prior suspicious shootings. Waters informs Flanagan that he and Ria have discovered that the officer was driving someone else's car with $300,000 in it, possibly from a drug deal. Flanagan insinuates that if Waters co-operates in helping to prosecute detective Conklin, the DA will appoint Waters as his chief investigator and clear Waters' brother's criminal record. At the ensuing press conference, Waters reluctantly agrees that, given the evidence, Conklin was likely a racist cop.\n\nAnthony and Peter carjack another [[Lincoln Navigator|Navigator]], which happens to be Cameron's; a police chase ensues. Hansen, one of the pursuing officers, vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning.\n\nHansen picks up a hitchhiking Peter, who offends Hansen by suddenly laughing; when Peter reaches for his pocket, Hansen shoots. Peter collapses dead, revealing a statuette of [[Saint Christopher]], the patron saint of travelers, similar to the one on Hansen's dash. Hansen hides the body in some bushes and burns his car. Waters and Ria later arrive at the scene, revealed as the beginning of the film. Waters realizes that Peter is both his missing brother and the \"dead kid\". Waters's mother [[Disownment|disowns]] him over Peter's death.\n\nAnthony decides to sell the van of Lee's husband, but when he drops it off at a chop shop, he discovers Cambodian immigrants chained in the back; He was a human trafficker. The chop shop owner offers Anthony $500 per immigrant, but Anthony refuses. He drives the Cambodians to [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and frees them. Anthony passes by a fender-bender. One driver turns out to be the insurance adjuster Ryan had previously argued with, and the other is an Asian man. An exchange of racially-charged insults occurs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Jean Cabot, Rick's wife\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as Detective Graham Waters, a black officer investigating recent murders based on racial tensions\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Sergeant John Ryan, a bigoted police officer\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Ria, Graham's Hispanic partner\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as District Attorney Rick Cabot, Jean's husband\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as Cameron Thayer, a television director and Christine's husband\n* [[Ludacris]] as Anthony, a violent carjacker and Peter's partner\n* [[Thandiwe Newton]] (credited as Thandie Newton) as Christine Thayer, Cameron's wife\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Daniel Ruiz, a Hispanic locksmith\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Officer Tom Hansen, a rookie policeman and Ryan's partner\n* [[Larenz Tate]] as Peter, a laid back carjacker, and Anthony's partner\n\n===Supporting cast===\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as Farhad, a Persian shop owner\n* [[Bahar Soomekh]] as Dorri, Farhad's daughter\n* [[Ashlyn Sanchez]] as Lara Ruiz, Daniel's daughter\n* [[Karina Arroyave]] as Elizabeth Ruiz, Daniel's wife\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Shaniqua Johnson, a HMO administrator\n* [[Beverly Todd]] as Mrs. Waters\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Jake Flanagan, Rick's campaign manager\n* [[Keith David]] as Lieutenant Dixon, Tom's superior officer\n* [[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as Gun Store Owner\n* Greg Joung Paik as Choi Chin Gui, a human trafficker\n* Alexis Rhee as Kim Lee, Choi Chin Gui's wife\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as Park\n* [[Nona Gaye]] as Karen\n* [[Bruce Kirby (actor)|Bruce Kirby]] as 'Pop' Ryan\n* [[Tony Danza]] as Fred\n* [[Kathleen York]] as Officer Johnson\n* [[Sylva Kelegian]] as Nurse Hodges\n* [[Marina Sirtis]] as Shereen, Farhad's wife\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nWriter and director Paul Haggis was inspired to make the film after being [[Carjacking|carjacked]] by two [[African Americans|African-American]] men at a [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Video]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] while driving home from the premiere of ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' in February 1991.

He initially tried to sell it to television producers before [[Bob Yari]] gave him $10 million to produce it as a film on the condition he could assemble an ensemble cast of major stars. He cast [[Heath Ledger]] and [[John Cusack]] in the film, and asked [[John Travolta]] and [[Kelly Preston]] to appear as Rick and Jean Cabot. However, Ledger and Cusack dropped out, and afterward, Haggis withdrew his offer to Travolta and Preston. Don Cheadle also considered leaving the production to perform in ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]''.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nHaggis managed to convince [[Cathy Schulman]] to continue the film with a lower budget after casting Sandra Bullock as Jean Cabot. Haggis made up for the reduced budget by taking out three mortgages on his house and cutting back on exterior shots, shooting using mostly sets from ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]''. The production was delayed by a week when Haggis suffered from cardiac arrest while filming a scene, although he defied medical advice to hire a new director.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nIn a 2020 interview with [[Vulture (magazine)|''Vulture'']], [[Thandiwe Newton]] stated that Haggis ensured she was wearing special protective underwear for the police sexual assault scene, because he wanted it to look \"real\" from the camera's perspective for [[Matt Dillon]] \"to go there\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jung|first=E.

I don't think so. There were great films that year. ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' \u2013 amazing film. ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'' \u2013 terrific film. Ang Lee's ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', great film. And Spielberg's ''[[Munich (2005 film)|Munich]]''. I mean please, what a year. ''Crash'', for some reason, affected people, it touched people. And you can't judge these films like that. I'm very glad to have those Oscars. They're lovely things. But you shouldn't ask me what the best film of the year was because I wouldn't be voting for ''Crash'', only because I saw the artistry that was in the other films. Now however, for some reason that's the film that touched people the most that year. So I guess that's what they voted for, something that really touched them. And I'm very proud of the fact that ''Crash'' does touch you. People still come up to me more than any of my films and say: 'That film just changed my life.' I've heard that dozens and dozens and dozens of times. So it did its job there. I mean, I knew it was the social experiment that I wanted, so I think it's a really good social experiment. Is it a great film? I don't know\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Child |first=Ben |title=Paul Haggis: Crash didn't deserve best picture Oscar |date=12 August 2015 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/12/paul-haggis-crash-best-picture-oscar |access-date=2 December 2016 |archive-date=3 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203064022/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/12/paul-haggis-crash-best-picture-oscar |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=August 11, 2015 |last1=Sepinwall |first1=Alan |author1= |author1-link=Alan Sepinwall |title=Even the director of Crash wouldnt have voted for it for Best Picture |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/even-the-director-of-crash-wouldnt-have-voted-for-it-for-best-picture |website=Hitfix.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812153759/http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/even-the-director-of-crash-wouldnt-have-voted-for-it-for-best-picture |archive-date=2015-08-12 }}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Crash (2004 film){{!}}List of accolades received by ''Crash'' (2004 film)}}\n\n''Crash'' received several award and nominations, and was named one of the top ten films of the year by both the [[American Film Institute]]<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI Awards 2005: AFI Movies of the Year |url=https://www.afi.com/award/afi-awards-2005/ |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=August 15, 2022}}</ref> and the [[National Board of Review]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mohr |first1=Ian |title=NBR in 'Good' mood |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/news/nbr-in-good-mood-1117934452/ |access-date=August 15, 2022 |work=Variety |date=December 12, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918211644/https://variety.com/2005/film/news/nbr-in-good-mood-1117934452/ |archivedate=September 18, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The film was nominated for six awards at the [[78th Academy Awards]] and won three, for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].<ref name=\"Oscars2006\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2006 |title=The 78th Academy Awards (2006) Nominees and Winners |access-date=August 15, 2022 |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109220946/http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2006 |archivedate=November 9, 2014}}</ref> It was also nominated for nine [[British Academy Film Awards]] and won two, for [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for Newton.<ref name=\"BAFTAs\">{{cite web |title=British Academy Film Awards 2006 |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2006/film |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] |access-date=August 15, 2022}}</ref> Dillon received nominations for best supporting actor at the Academy Awards,<ref name=\"Oscars2006\" /> British Academy Film Awards,<ref name=\"BAFTAs\" /> [[Golden Globe Awards]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Live coverage of 2006 Golden Globes |url=https://variety.com/2006/film/awards/live-coverage-of-2006-golden-globes-1117936244/ |access-date=August 15, 2022 |work=Variety |date=January 16, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107165734/http://variety.com/2006/film/awards/live-coverage-of-2006-golden-globes-1117936244/ |archivedate=November 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominations Announced for the 12th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards |url=http://www.sagawards.org/media-pr/press-releases/nominations-announced-12th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards\u00ae |publisher=Screen Actors Guild |access-date=August 15, 2022 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922054715/http://www.sagawards.org/media-pr/press-releases/nominations-announced-12th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards%C2%AE |archivedate=September 22, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> for his performance.
