Based on the [[Alone in the Dark|video game series of the same name]], it stars [[Christian Slater]], [[Tara Reid]], and [[Stephen Dorff]] as paranormal investigators who combat a supernatural threat. The film's story is an adaptation of the game ''[[Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare]]'' (2001).\n\nUpon release, the film received overwhelmingly negative reviews for the story, dialogue, special effects, and Reid's performance. Holding a 1% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Alone in the Dark'' is [[List of films considered the worst#Alone in the Dark (2005)|considered one of the worst films ever made]]. It was also a commercial failure, grossing $12.7 million on a $20 million budget, although the home media releases were more successful.

Currently En route to a museum where his girlfriend, Aline Cedric works as an assistant curator. Edward holds within his hands an artifact-puzzle piece of the Abkani, an extinct Native American tribe. A strange man follows and attacks Edward and his cab driver with supernatural durability and strength, trying to steal the artifact, but eventually dies after many escape attempts by Edward.\n\nAt the same time, in a different location, a ship recovers a coffin made of gold from the ocean floor. After docking, the captain locks up Prof. Hudgens (curator of said museum) while his crew opens the gold coffin against better judgment. Hudgens escapes his imprisonment to find everyone killed by a mysterious creature and the coffin empty. Hudgens finds a secret compartment and collects an artifact from the coffin, and he slips away ashore.\n\nUpon opening the gold coffin, several people across the western USA and Canada walk off into the night after hearing an ear-splitting screech. During which, Edward passes out while studying his artifact. At the same time, Bureau 713 (B-713) is also made aware by a surveillance team of evidence of electromagnetic waves.\n\nEdward thinks it's related to the Abkani as everyone who disappeared that same night was from the same location. Edward arrives that evening at the Museum where he is reunited with Aline with the artifact, and she shows him another Abkani artifact that recently arrived that she has been working on since Prof. Hudgens was away. The mysterious creature from the ship attacks them inside the museum, killing a security guard, but Edward and Aline hide in a storage closet long enough for troopers from Bureau 713 to arrive, and the creature retreats into the night.\n\nCommander Burke, team leader of the B-713 strike force, arrives where Edward tries to relay information to him, but Burke rebukes him, saying that since he no longer works to stay out of it. Edward tries to get information from his former co-workers at B-713, like staff surgeon and pathologist Sam Fischer, to learn more about the creature encountered and the Abnaki's history.\n\nProf. Hudgens arrives back at the museum to his office, where he has a captured creature. Hudgens uses a syringe to draw fluid from the captive creature to study it as part of his further research to combine the DNA of man and beast. Edward continues investigating his past by going to his former orphanage to learn more about Hudgens' research, and back to his apartment where he and Aline have sex.\n\nWhile the Bureau 713 soldiers are patrolling the museum, they are attacked by several creatures, who are the missing people that wandered off upon the opening of the gold coffin. During the firefight, several soldiers and most of the human-creatures are killed. Edward arrives on the scene and talks more with Burke, who again tells him to stay away. However, during a scuffle, Edward picks Burke's pocket containing his Bureau 713 security badge.\n\nEdward goes to Bureau 713 where he talks with Fischer in the morgue looking at one of the dead bodies, and Fischer shows Edward a small, centipede-like creature in the dorsal spine of his old friend. Fischer also discovers that Edward has one of his own in his body, but it is dead, presumably because of the electroshock Edward had as a child. Burke and his men arrive and escort Edward out of the building. That evening, Professor Hudgens ambushes Fischer at his home and inserts a baby creature into Fischer's mouth.\n\nEdward discovers that the Abkani had fought those creatures which can get killed by light. They also disrupt electrical light, creating blackouts. The Abkani artifacts found all over the world actually open the gate to another dimension, where millions of those creatures are sleeping, waiting to be freed. Hudgens makes further experiments, injecting himself with the blood of one of the creatures, granting him the ability to control the monsters.\n\nEdward, Aline, Burke, and Burke's military squad go to Edward's orphanage, where there are strong electromagnetic disruptions. They are attacked by dozens of the creatures and of the humans except Edward, Aline, and Burke are killed. They reach the old surgery room underground where the baby creature was transplanted into Edward. There, Hudgens takes Edward's artifact and opens the gate. Millions of creatures start to wake up and run towards the gate. Burke kills Hudgens, and the group places a bomb and runs away, only to realize that they cannot detonate the bomb from such a long distance. Burke goes back and sacrifices himself.\n\nEdward and Aline rise to the surface at dawn but find an evacuated city with cars abandoned on the streets. As they walk down the street, something runs toward them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Slater]] as [[Edward Carnby]]: Raised at an orphanage under Sister Clara, Carnby lost his memory when he was ten years old. At twenty, he was recruited by Bureau 713, gaining knowledge on the paranormal soon after. His current assignment is investigating his past along with researching the disappearance of the Abkani. Due to the experiments conducted on him as a child, he has the ability to sense paranormal activity and has increased strength and speed, which allow him to perform acrobatic moves that a normal human could not do.\n** Dustyn Arthurs as Young Edward\n* [[Tara Reid]] as Aline Cedrac, an [[archaeologist]] and museum curator; Edward's girlfriend who knows about the Abkani and their culture.\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Commander Richard Burke, the Commander of Bureau 713, formerly worked under Carnby's direction.\n* [[Frank C. Turner]] as Agent Fischer, the head of the medical unit of Bureau 713; he is one of Carnby's few trusted allies and friends.\n* [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Professor Lionel Hudgens\n* Will Sanderson as Agent Miles\n* [[Mike Dopud]] as Agent Turner; he is killed by Fischer while working on a power generator\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Yip]] as Agent Cheung\n* [[Mark Acheson]] as Captain Chernick\n* [[Darren Shahlavi]] as John Dillon\n* [[Karin Konoval]] as Sister Clara, owner of the orphanage which cared for Edward. In the '80s, she was persuaded by Hudgens to allow experiments on the orphans. She keeps this secret from everyone but is inwardly guilty for her immoral actions.\n* Ed Anders as James Pinkerton, a former Agent of Bureau 713 who went missing in action in the 1980s. He and Hudgens were in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of gold-miners at Brutan Goldmine. Pinkerton became an experiment for Hudgens, who attached a Xenos creature to his spine. His abilities included increased awareness, strength, speed and willpower.\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Cab driver\n\n==Alternative script==\nBlair Erickson came up with the first drafts of the script for ''Alone in the Dark''. According to Erickson, Uwe Boll changed the script to be more action-packed than a thriller. Erickson stated his disgust at the treatment and spoke negatively of his working relationship with Boll on [[Something Awful]]:\n\n{{blockquote|The original script took the ''Alone in the Dark'' premise and depicted it as if it were actually based on a true story of a private investigator in the northeastern U.S. whose missing persons cases begin to uncover a disturbing paranormal secret. It was told through the eyes of a writer following Edward Carnby and his co-worker for a novel and depicted them as real-life [[blue-collar]] folks who never expected to find hideous beings waiting for them in the dark. We tried to stick close to the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] style and the low-tech nature of the original game, always keeping the horror in the shadows so you never saw what was coming for them.\n\nThankfully Dr. Boll was able to hire his loyal team of hacks to crank out something much better than our crappy story and add in all sorts of terrifying horror movie essentials like opening gateways to alternate dimensions, bimbo blonde archaeologists, sex scenes, mad scientists, slimy dog monsters, special army forces designed to battle slimy CG dog monsters, Tara Reid, \"[[The Matrix|Matrix]]\" slow-motion gun battles, and car chases. Oh yeah, and a ten-minute opening back story scroll read aloud to the illiterate audience, the only people able to successfully miss all the negative reviews.\n\nI mean hell, Boll knows that's where the real scares lie.<ref>{{cite web | last = Erikson | first = Blair | title = Behind the Scenes: Uwe Boll and Uwe Boll's ''Alone in the Dark'' | url=http://www.somethingawful.com/d/feature-articles/behind-scenes-uwe.php?page=2 | access-date = 2007-09-22 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014043913/http://www.somethingawful.com/d/feature-articles/behind-scenes-uwe.php?page=2| archive-date= 14 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>}}\n\n==Production==\nTara Reid starred in the film opposite Christian Slater.<ref name=\"TaraReidDark\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/people-news/tara-reid-1117889691/|title=  Tara Reid|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 23, 2021}}</ref> Artisan Pictures picked up North American distribution rights to the film in June 2003.<ref name=\"TaraReidDark\" />\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on 10 May 2005.
