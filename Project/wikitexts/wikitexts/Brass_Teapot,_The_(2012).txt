The only catch is that they must experience pain in order for the teapot to provide. They must then decide what they are willing to do (and what they are willing to suffer through) in order to gain financial security.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Juno Temple]] as Alice\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as John\n* [[Alexis Bledel]] as Payton\n* [[Alia Shawkat]] as Louise\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Chuck\n* [[Ben Rappaport]] as Ricky\n* [[Billy Magnussen]] as Arnie\n* [[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]] as Dr. Li Ling\n* [[Lucy Walters]] as Mary\n* [[Claudia Mason]] as Donna\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Trudy\n* [[Thomas Middleditch]] as Habab\n* [[Cristin Milioti]] as Brandi\n* [[Nick Frazier]] as Wedding Bartender\n\n==Reception==\n''The Brass Teapot'' garnered negative reviews from critics.

The ''Wall Street Journal'' said: \"Alice and John are good company \u2014 especially Alice, thanks to Ms. Temple's buoyant humor and lovely poignancy. The problem comes when the couple gets greedy, the gods grow angry and the tone turns dark. It doesn't stay dark, but getting back to the brightness is a painful process.\"\n\nNicolas Rapold of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the film, saying that while the two lead characters were interesting, the \"movie's best bits lose out to the requisite moral turnaround\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Be Careful What You Wish For|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/movies/the-brass-teapot-by-ramaa-mosley.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last=Rapold|first=Nicolas|date=April 5, 2013|access-date=July 3, 2022|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513180223/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/movies/the-brass-teapot-by-ramaa-mosley.html?_r=0|archive-date=May 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Rob Hunter of ''[[Film School Rejects]]'' commented that the darker points of the film's story line were \"ill fitting\" in contrast with the predominantly \"comically light and slapsticky\" tone of the overall movie.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: 'The Brass Teapot' Occasionally Shines But Needs Another Polish|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/review-the-brass-teapot-occasionally-shines-but-needs-another-polish-ae8a44164295/|website=[[Film School Rejects]]|last=Hunter|first=Rob|date=April 5, 2013|access-date=July 3, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703232344/https://filmschoolrejects.com/review-the-brass-teapot-occasionally-shines-but-needs-another-polish-ae8a44164295/|archive-date=July 3, 2022|url-status=dead}}</ref> In contrast, Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a more positive review for the film, saying that Mosely \"makes her low-budget enterprise look as slick as most midrange studio comedies, demonstrating herself a director with both imagination and technical ingenuity.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Film Review: 'The Brass Teapot'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-the-brass-teapot-1200332230/|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Debruge|first=Peter|date=April 2, 2013|access-date=April 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214234838/https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-the-brass-teapot-1200332230/|archive-date=February 14, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.magpictures.com/thebrassteapot/}}\n* {{IMDb title|1935902|The Brass Teapot}}\n* {{official website|http://www.brassteapot.com/|Official comic book and mythology website}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brass Teapot, The}}\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2012 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s fantasy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about wish fulfillment]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andrew Hewitt]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Bucharest]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
