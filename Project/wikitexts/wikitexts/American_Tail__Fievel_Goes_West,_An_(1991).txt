In it, [[Fievel Mousekewitz|Fievel]] is separated from his family as the train approaches the American Old West; the film chronicles him and Sheriff [[Wylie Burp]] teaching Tiger how to act like a dog.\n\n''Fievel Goes West'' was the first production for the short-lived Amblimation, a studio Spielberg set up to keep the animators of ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988) working. It is also the only Amblimation film to use [[Traditional animation#Cels|cel animation]], the last in the series to do so, and the last to be released in theaters. While the animation medium was transitioning to computers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Spielberg wanted almost all of the animation of ''Fievel Goes West'' to be hand-drawn, describing animation as \"an arts-and-crafts business\". He also wanted the animation to have a \"live-action\" feel. [[Phillip Glasser]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Nehemiah Persoff]], and [[Erica Yohn]] reprise their roles from the first film for ''Fievel Goes West''. Tanya's original voice actor, Amy Green, was replaced by [[Cathy Cavadini]], and new characters were voiced by [[John Cleese]], [[Amy Irving]], [[Jon Lovitz]], and [[James Stewart]] in his final film role. [[James Horner]] returned as a composer and wrote the film's song \"Dreams to Dream\", which garnered a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.\n\nPremiering at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] on November 17, 1991, ''An American Tail: Fievel Goes West'' began its American theatrical run on November 22. This was the same day [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991) was distributed, making it the third instance of two animated films being released on the same date. ''Fievel Goes West'' was promoted with a wide array of [[tie-in]]s and started in the top ten at the [[box office]]. The film grossed $22 million in the United States against a budget of $16 million. Some film journalists and executives attributed this to having to compete with the Disney film.\n\nUpon its release, ''Fievel Goes West'' was panned for a lack of perceived innovation compared to other animated films of its time.<!-- per source: \"panned on the ground that it was not so innovative as other new animated films\" --><ref name=\"Nichols\"/> However, it found success when it came to home video sales, quickly reaching the top of the video charts when released on tape in March 1992; at the time, the film held the record for shortest theater-to-home-video transfer and it has since gained a large cult following. In addition to garnering more home media releases, TV airings, and video game adaptations later on, the film has made numerous 2010s retrospective best-of lists from online publications, especially best [[Netflix]]-available Western films. ''Fievel Goes West'' was followed by a short-lived [[CBS]] series named ''[[Fievel's American Tails]]'' and two direct-to-video sequels and prequels: ''[[An American Tail: The Treasure of Manhattan Island]]'' (1998) and ''[[An American Tail: The Mystery of the Night Monster]]'' (1999).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1890, five years after immigrating to the United States, the impoverished Mousekewitz family discovers that conditions are not as ideal as they had hoped, as they find themselves still struggling against the attacks of mouse-hungry cats. Fievel spends his days thinking about a bloodhound-sheriff named Wylie Burp, while Tanya dreams of becoming a singer. Meanwhile, Tiger's girlfriend, Miss Kitty, leaves him to find a new life out west, remarking that perhaps she is looking for \"a cat that's more like a dog\".\n\nA British aristocratic cat named Cat R. Waul launches an attack on the mice, forcing them to flee into the sewers. There, they come across a cowboy mouse, who is in fact a marionette controlled by Cat R. Waul, who tricks the mice into moving to a better life out west. Tiger tries catching up with his friends, but is thrown off course by a group of dogs. While on the train, Fievel wanders into the livestock car, where he overhears the cats' intentions to turn the mice into \"mouse burgers\". After being discovered, Fievel tries to flee but Cat R. Waul has his hench-spider, T.R. Chula, strand Fievel in the middle of the desert. Devastated once again over his loss, his family arrives in [[Green River, Utah]].\n\nUpon arrival in Green River, Chula blocks up the water tower, drying up the river. Cat R. Waul approaches the mice and proposes to build a new saloon together, although intending to trick the mice into doing the bulk of the work and then eat them afterwards. Meanwhile, Fievel is wandering aimlessly through the desert, as is Tiger, who has found his way out west as well, and they pass each other. However, they each figure that the other is a mirage and continue on their separate ways. Tiger is captured by a local mouse [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] tribe and hailed as a god. Fievel is picked up by a hawk, dropped over the mouse native village and reunites with Tiger. Tiger chooses to stay in while Fievel catches a passing [[tumbleweed]], which takes him to Green River. He reunites with his family, but they are oblivious to Cat R. Waul's plans. Entering the saloon, Fievel overhears the cats' plan yet again and is discovered once more by Cat R. Waul. Cat R. Waul tries eating Fievel, but is thwarted when he hears Tanya singing. He sends Tanya to Miss Kitty, who is now a saloon-girl cat and she reveals that she came at Cat R. Waul's request. He tells Miss Kitty to put her on stage and Tanya performs for the cats. Meanwhile, Fievel is chased by Chula and briefly taken prisoner, but flees.\n\nDespondent, Fievel speaks with an elderly bloodhound sleeping outside the jail, discovering he is actually Wylie Burp. Fievel convinces him to help and train Tiger as a lawman and as a dog. Though initially reluctant, Tiger relents at the suggestion that a new [[wikt:persona|persona]] might win back Miss Kitty. They return to Green River to fight the cats, who attempt to use a concealed giant mouse trap on the mice at sunset during the opening of Cat R. Waul's saloon. Tiger, Wylie and Fievel fight the cats, during which Miss Kitty and Tanya discover the trap. Tanya rushes to the mice and, using her singing abilities, helps them escape. Seeing this, Cat R. Waul uses a giant revolver as a makeshift cannon on the fleeing mice, but Wylie has Fievel intercept from Cat R. Waul's attacks. When Chula takes Miss Kitty hostage, however, an incensed Tiger rescues her and the heroes use the mouse trap as a catapult to send Cat R. Waul and his cats out of Green River. The cats fly into the air and land into a mailbag, which a passing train picks up and leaves.\n\nEnamored by his new personality, Miss Kitty and Tiger are reunited. Tanya becomes a famous singer and the water tower flows with 1,000 gallons of water again, making Green River bloom with thousands of flowers. Fievel finds Wylie away from the party who hands him his sheriff badge. Fievel is unsure about taking it, but realizes that his journey is not over.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Phillip Glasser]] as Fievel Mousekewitz\n* [[Cathy Cavadini]] as Tanya Mousekewitz\n* [[Dom DeLuise]] as Tiger\n* [[Amy Irving]] as Miss Kitty\n* [[James Stewart]] as Wylie Burp, his last appearance in a film.\n* [[John Cleese]] as Cat R.

A piece of dialogue from Fievel in the former appears to retcon ''Fievel Goes West'' as a dream the character had, but many fans would prefer to see both direct-to-video films as prequels that take place before ''Fievel Goes West'', with the dialogue being taken as foreshadowing.\n\n=== Spin-off television series ===\nOn September 12, 1992, the TV series ''[[Fievel's American Tails]]'' premiered on [[CBS]]; it is a follow-up of ''Fievel Goes West'' and features actors such as Glasser, Cavadini and DeLuise reprising their roles.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Solomon |first=Charles |date=September 19, 1992 |title=TV REVIEWS : Cartoons Seek a Gleeful Insanity in New Season |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-09-19-ca-431-story.html |access-date=December 1, 2019 |website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In 2020, [[NBCUniversal]] regained rights to the series and is available on [[Peacock (streaming service)|Peacock]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=\"Fievel's American Tails\" is set to stream on Peacock later in 2020 |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/peacock-programming-heres-whats-available-now-on-premium-preview-in-the-coming-months-1202909593/ |website=Deadline|date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> over two decades after being abandoned since the release of the DTV films in the late 1990s.\n\n== Legacy ==\nFievel later served as the [[mascot]] for [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblimation]] animation studio, appearing in its [[production logo]].
