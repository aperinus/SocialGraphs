Pictures|Warner Bros.]] under their [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] label. It is directed by [[Dwight H. Little|Dwight Little]] from a screenplay by Karen Janszen, Corey Blechman and [[John Mattson]]. [[Jason James Richter]], [[Jayne Atkinson]], [[August Schellenberg]], [[Mykelti Williamson]] and [[Michael Madsen]] reprise their roles from the first film. New cast members include [[Jon Tenney]] and [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]]. Unlike the previous film where [[Keiko (killer whale)|Keiko]] played Willy, a robotic double created by Edge Innovations was used to play the eponymous whale while the Free Willy Keiko Foundation devised a plan to bring Keiko to the [[Oregon Coast Aquarium]] where he would be rehabilitated from poor health.\n\nFilming commenced in [[Astoria, Oregon]] and the [[San Juan Islands]] between April and August 1994 with additional filming taking place in [[California]].\n\nThe film opened to mixed reviews from critics. Despite underperforming at the box office, a third film ''[[Free Willy 3: The Rescue]]'' was subsequently released in 1997.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nIt's been two years since Jesse saved and freed his [[Killer whale|orca]] friend, Willy. Jesse, now 14, has since been adopted by Glen and Annie Greenwood. They are preparing to go to the [[San Juan Islands]] for a camping trip and visit Randolph at his new job. Glen has been trying to teach Jesse to drive the motorboat named Little Dipper, but Jesse is more interested in girls. However, before they leave town, Dwight informs Glen and Annie that Jesse's biological mother was found dead in New York City and left behind another son. Jesse is devastated after many attempts to find her, but comes to terms after talking his feelings out with Glen. When Jesse's half-brother Elvis arrives, he is morose, overly talkative and mischievous, and he is also prone to telling lies and easily gets on Jesse's nerves. He is invited on their trip so that the boys get to know each other.\n\nAt the [[San Juan Islands National Wildlife Refuge|environmental institute]], Jesse reunites with Randolph and quickly becomes smitten with his attractive and kindly goddaughter, Nadine. Jesse also tracks down and reunites with Willy later that night. Jesse cautiously begins to show his interest in Nadine, and as the awkward teenagers grow closer, he helped her befriend Willy and his younger siblings Luna and Littlespot. Elvis spies on the two, forming his own bond with the young, playful Littlespot, and lies to Glen and Annie about Jesse kissing Nadine. Glen talks to Jesse who denies this, leading to Elvis getting grounded.\n\nAs the Greenwoods continue to enjoy their camping trip, an oil tanker, the Dakar, runs aground on lawson reef and [[Oil spill|spills oil]] into the ocean due to an engine malfunction, trapping Willy, Luna and Littlespot in a small cove. When word gets out that the orcas are trapped and Luna is dying from the oil in her lungs having swum through the oil when the tanker ran aground, Benbrook Oil CEO John Milner arrives and announces a plan to move the whales into captivity where they can recover from their injuries. Jesse challenges this, making Milner promise to do whatever he can, to get them safely back to their mom or else he'll be blamed for Luna's death, to which Milner seemingly agrees.\n\nWith Luna's condition worsening despite receiving treatment from Kate Haley, Randolph and Jesse eventually use an old Indian remedy that they administer to Luna, who recovers the next morning. Elvis, who ran away believing that Jesse is more important and after Annie breaks her promise to allow him to help, overhears Milner and whaler Bill Wilcox discussing their real plan to sell the whales to a [[marine mammal park]] rushes back to camp instead of catching a ferry. Shortly afterwards, with the oil spill reaching dangerous proximity to the cove, Benbrook Oil and the whalers boom it off despite Jesse, Randolph and Nadine's objections and begin extracting the whales. As the extraction of Littlespot commences, Elvis returns in time to warn Jesse and the brothers expose Milner's plot which lead to them knocking him and his assistant into the water for breaking their promise, while Haley and the others laugh at them struggling to swim to the dock. With the help of a distraction by Jesse and Elvis, Willy manages to rescue his little brother by tipping Wilcox's boat.\n\nWith time running out before the oil reaches the cove, Jesse, Elvis and Nadine hijack the Little Dipper to lead the whales to safety. On Jesse's signal, Willy is able to break the boom and leads his siblings out of the cove. However, an explosion on the Dakar, due to fuel vapors igniting after engineers tried to start the generator, results in the crude oil in the water catching fire. Despite the danger, the three whales are able to swim under the flaming oil to safety. Having followed the whales to ensure they got safely past the oil, the kids fall into danger when they take Little Dipper into another cove to avoid the flaming oil, but the fogginess from the smoke causes Jesse to hit a rock and the boat begins to sink while the flames seal off the cove.\n\nAt the same time, Glen and Annie, who were looking for Elvis until they spot him on the Little Dipper, hop aboard Randolph's boat, Natselane, to follow the kids' path as he sends a [[distress signal]] that summons the Coastal Marine Patrol to their aid. A search and rescue helicopter locates them, and Elvis and Nadine are retracted to safety. However, the Little Dipper then submerges completely, leaving Jesse struggling in the oily water, and unable to secure himself sufficiently in the harness. He ultimately slips out and falls back into the ocean, just inches away from the helicopter and, due to smoke choking the helicopter's engine, it is forced to leave Jesse behind. Jesse nearly drowns but is rescued by Willy who returns for his friend. Willy is able to carry him safely under the fire to the Natselane, where Glen and Annie pull Jesse to safety. Though Jesse was curious as to why Willy won't leave, it was revealed through Randolph that the signal must be performed. An emotional Jesse does it, and he, Glen and Annie say goodbye to Willy before he departs back to his family.\n\nShortly after, the Coastal Marine Patrol dropped off Nadine and Elvis. Elvis gives Jesse an old picture of him and their mother that was taped back together for him. He also tells Jesse that she always talked about him and felt bad about abandoning him. Jesse thanks him for the  picture and hugs him, finally accepting him as his brother and putting his past at rest. Glen and Annie decide to keep the brothers together. When asked by Elvis about Littlespot's whereabouts, Jesse tells him that Willy and his siblings are back with their mom. He then says the same Haida prayer to himself after knowing that they are all free.\n\nSometime later with the oil spill cleaned up, Willy, Luna and Littlespot reunite with Catspaw.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jason James Richter]] as Jesse\n* [[Francis Capra]] as Elvis\n* [[Mary Kate Schellhardt]] as Nadine\n* [[August Schellenberg]] as Randolph Johnson\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Glen Greenwood (credited as \"Glenn\")\n* [[Jayne Atkinson]] as Annie Greenwood\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Dwight Mercer\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Dr. Kate Haley\n* [[Jon Tenney]] as John Milner\n* Paul Tuerpe as Milner's assistant\n* [[M.
