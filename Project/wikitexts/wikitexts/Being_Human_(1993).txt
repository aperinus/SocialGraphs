An international co-production of the United Kingdom and Japan, the film portrays the experience of a single human [[soul]], portrayed by Williams, through various [[incarnation]]s. Williams is the only common actor throughout the stories that span man's history on Earth.\n\nAn attempt on director-screenwriter Bill Forsyth's part to depict by visual means the ordinariness of life throughout the ages, ''Being Human'' is deliberately slow in its pace in order to emphasize how slow life often is. The structure is one of vignette-like character studies of one man (actually at least four distinct men, all with the same soul) who keeps making the same relationships and mistakes throughout his lifetimes.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the first incarnation, which appears to be a [[caveman]], a man's family is taken from him by raiders due to his cowardice and hesitation. Before his wife is taken away, she says, \"Don't lose the children!\"\n\nThe next incarnation is in [[Ancient Rome]] in which he, Hector, is a slave to a \"foolish master\" who loses his fortune and is compelled to kill himself by his creditors and orders Hector to join him. Hector longs to be free to find the children and wife he had before he became a slave, but he has fallen in love with another slave and forgets his waiting family.\n\nThird incarnation: He is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Crusades|crusader]] on his way home to his children.  The master from his life in Rome as a slave is now a crusader trying to decide whether to become a priest. They travel together until Hector finds his soul mate from the life in Rome. She is a widow and wishes Hector to join her family, but his duties to the children in Scotland pull at him.\n\nFourth incarnation: Hector is finally forced to confront his capacity for cowardly indecision. He is a Portuguese man in [[The Renaissance]] shipwrecked on the coast of Africa. He is the master in this life, his wife from the first incarnation shipwrecked with him as his spurned lover, and the raider who spirited her away is her steadfast friend.\n\nFifth incarnation: He is a modern man in New York, paying the consequences of cowardly indecision and gaining the strength to address the children he lost lifetimes ago. He is joined in this life by his master/slave/friend/soul mate, and former wife Janet and her husband/raider from lifetimes past. They support him but are people who are trying to find their own way, just as in the past lives.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Hector\n* [[John Turturro]] as Lucinnius\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Julian\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as The Priest \n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as The prehistoric Shaman \n* [[Theresa Russell]] as The Storyteller\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Hermes\n* [[Hector Elizondo]] as Dom Paulo\n* Lizzy McInnerny as Ursula\n* [[John Finn]] as Detective Cobb\n* [[William H.

Later, after poor test screenings, Warner Bros. instructed Bill Forsyth to trim 40 minutes from the film, as well as add narration and a happy ending. Forsyth subsequently disowned the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106379/?ref_=tttr_tr_tt|title=Being Human (1994)|work=IMDb|date=6 May 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2004/great-directors/forsyth/|title=Bill Forsyth|author=Christopher Meir|work=Senses of Cinema}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nDespite the changes, the film was still not well-received on release.
