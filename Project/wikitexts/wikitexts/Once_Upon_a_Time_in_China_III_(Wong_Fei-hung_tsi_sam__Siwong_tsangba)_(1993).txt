It is the third installment in the [[Once Upon a Time in China (film series)|''Once Upon a Time in China'' film series]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century China during the [[Qing dynasty]] Chinese sovereignty is being eroded by foreign imperialism. [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] and [[Li Hongzhang]] decide to stage a [[lion dance]] competition to showcase [[Chinese martial arts]] and restore national pride. Interested parties from all over China are invited to participate and compete for the title of \"Lion Dance King\".\n\n[[Wong Fei-hung]] travels by train from [[Foshan]] to [[Beijing]] with his romantic interest [[Thirteenth Aunt|13th Aunt]] and apprentice Leung Foon to meet his father, [[Wong Kei-ying]], at the [[Ten Tigers of Canton|Cantonese Ten Tigers Association]]. At the train station, 13th Aunt meets Tomanovsky, a Russian diplomat, who was her classmate when she was studying in Britain. He starts vying for her attention and annoys Wong, who is disgusted by the Western custom of kissing a woman's hand. When Wong reaches the Association, he learns that his father has been attacked by a wealthy rival martial artist, Chiu Tin-bak, and Chiu's henchman, Clubfoot. Luckily, the elder Wong sustained only minor injuries. Wong Kei-ying decides to give his blessings to his son and 13th Aunt when he sees their romantic relationship.\n\nBefore the competition officially begins, all the lion dance troupes that have gathered in Beijing are already fighting among themselves and holding another competition of their own. Wong does not participate and spectates instead. Unknown to him, Leung and his friends have secretly joined the competition out of mischief. A short chase takes place between Clubfoot and Leung when the latter annoys the former during the contest and flees. Clubfoot's legs are crushed when Leung accidentally releases a stampede of horses from a stable. Chiu abandons Clubfoot when he sees that he is now a useless cripple. Wong takes pity on Clubfoot, brings him in, and heals his legs. Clubfoot is initially hostile towards Wong, but he feels so touched and grateful to Wong that he starts bawling emotionally, and becomes Wong's new apprentice.\n\nWith the aid of a camera given to her by Tomanovsky, 13th Aunt inadvertently uncovers a plot to assassinate Li Hongzhang during the competition and learns that Tomanovsky is one of the conspirators. She warns Wong, who joins the contest to stop the assassins. In the final round of the competition, Wong, Leung and Clubfoot fight with dozens of rival lion dancers as they battle their way to the top of a scaffold. Chiu also joins the competition and carries a large and deadly lion mask. Wong ultimately defeats Chiu and wins the competition.\n\nIn the meantime, Tomanovsky fails to assassinate Li Hongzhang and is shot dead by his fellow Russians, who claim to the Chinese that he was a spy working for the Japanese. Although Wong wins the prize (a gold medal) he remarks that it is ultimately a defeat for the Chinese because of all the infighting. He then tosses the medal back to Li Hongzhang, turns his back and walks away.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jet Li]] as [[Wong Fei-hung]] (doubled by [[Hung Yan-yan]])\n* [[Rosamund Kwan]] as [[Thirteenth Aunt|\"13th Aunt\" Yee Siu-kwan]]\n* [[Max Mok]] as Leung Foon\n* [[Hung Yan-yan]] as Kwai Geuk-chat (\"Clubfoot Seven Chiu-Tsat\")\n* John Wakefield as Tomanovsky\n* Lau Shun as [[Wong Kei-ying]]\n* Chiu Chin as Chiu Tin-bak\n* Wong Tak-yan as Yan\n* [[Ge Cunzhuang]] as [[Li Hongzhang]]\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Once Upon a Time in China III'' got 67%, based on 9 reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/once_upon_a_time_in_china_3|title=Once Upon a Time in China III|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=2021-03-09}}</ref> while Marc Salvov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' gave it 2.5 out of 5.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/1993-11-05/139008/|last=Salvov|first=Marc|title=Once Upon a Time in China III|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=1993-11-05|access-date=2021-03-09}}</ref> Panos Kotzathanasis of the Asian Movie Pulse said that \"[the film] is the most personal film of the trilogy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://asianmoviepulse.com/2019/01/film-review-once-upon-a-time-in-china-3-1993-by-tsui-hark/|last=Kotzathanasis|first=Panos|title=Film Review: Once Upon A Time in China 3 (1993) by Tsui Hark|publisher=Asian Movie Pulse|date=2019-01-05|access-date=2021-03-09}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n*[[13th Hong Kong Film Awards]]\n** Nominated: [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Editing|Best Film Editing]] (Marco Mak, Angie Lam)\n\n==Alternate versions==\nThe film was released in Hong Kong on [[VHS]] by [[Paragon Films]] in 1996.
