The film also features a number of martial arts professionals. It opened in wide release in the United States and Canada on May 9, 2008. The film centers on a martial arts master who struggles to achieve financial stability without compromising on his strict set of morals, and must determine if the latest opportunities in his career are too good to be true.\n\n==Plot==\nOne evening, at his [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] studio, martial arts teacher Mike Terry is approached by attorney Laura Black, who accidentally sideswiped his car. Policeman Joe Collins, one of Mike's students, sees that Laura is distressed and tries to take her coat. Startled, she grabs Joe's gun and it goes off, shattering the studio's front window. To avoid having Laura charged with attempted murder, Mike and Joe agree to conceal the event.\n\nMike's insurance, however, will not cover his claim that the window was broken by the wind. Mike's wife Sondra, who works in fashion and tries to keep the struggling studio afloat, makes Mike ask for a loan from her brother Ricardo, a [[mixed martial arts]] champion. At Ricardo's nightclub, Sondra's other brother, Bruno, says Mike should fight on the undercard of an upcoming match between Ricardo and Japanese legend Morisaki, which could potentially pay out $50,000. Mike refuses, as he believes competitions are not honorable and weaken the fighter.\n\nMeanwhile, aging Hollywood action star Chet Frank enters the nightclub without security and is attacked by a man. Mike saves Chet with his impressive fighting abilities. The following day, Mike receives an expensive watch from Chet. Mike gives the watch to Joe, knowing he has financial issues. At a dinner party, Chet's wife Zena arranges an informal business deal to buy a large number of dresses from Sondra's company. Meanwhile, Mike explains his unique training method to Chet's business associate Jerry Weiss. Before a sparring match, each fighter must draw one of three marbles, two white and one black; whoever draws a black marble has to fight with a handicap.\n\nMike later helps Chet prepare for a film role and is offered the role of co-producer. That evening, Mike faxes the details of his training methods to Jerry so they can be used in the film. Joe then informs Mike that he was suspended from duty for pawning the watch, which turned out to be stolen. Mike later relays the information to Jerry who leaves without giving an explanation. Zena also decides to stop all contact with Sondra, who is panicky, having borrowed $30,000 from a loan shark to order the fabric for the dresses. The couple then learns that Bruno and Marty Brown are using Mike's marble-drawing method as a promotional gimmick for their fighting competition.\n\nMike hires Laura to sue, but Marty's lawyer threatens that if they do not drop the lawsuit, he will give the police proof that she broke the window attempting to kill Joe. He also has proofs incriminating Mike and Joe of covering it up. Feeling responsible for what happened, Joe kills himself. Mike feels obligated to help Joe's financially struggling wife and, in desperate need of money himself, decides to compete as an undercard fighter in the upcoming competition.\n\nAt the arena, Mike discovers the fights are being fixed: the white and black marbles are not selected at random. Unbeknownst to the competitors, this is done by Marty, Jerry and Bruno to ensure winning bets. Mike also learns that Sondra is the one who told them about Laura shooting the window. Apparently, she did not want to stay with someone who cannot provide for her.\n\nMike is disgusted by the way in which the group is dishonoring the sport, specially when the Professor, an elderly martial arts master, is part of the crowd. Mike decides to leave the tournament and let things be, but Laura convinces him to act. Decided to let everyone know what is going on, Mike re-enters the arena and incapacitates several security guards trying to stop him. He is ultimately engaged by Ricardo and their fight draws the attention of everyone there. In the end, Mike wins. As a sign of respect, Morisaki offers Mike his ivory-studded belt, previously referred to as a Japanese national treasure. Mike is then approached by the Professor himself, who proceeds to award him the coveted red belt. He then embraces him, acknowledging his dedication to the art.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Mike Terry\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Chet Frank\n* [[Alice Braga]] as Sondra Terry\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Bruno Silva\n* [[Jose Pablo Cantillo]] as Snowflake\n* [[Randy Couture]] as Dylan Flynn\n* [[Caroline de Souza Correa]] as Monica\n* [[Mike Goldberg]] as Sports Announcer #2\n* [[Damon Herriman]] as Official\n* [[Dan Inosanto]] as Joao Moro (The Professor)\n* [[Enson Inoue]] as Taketa Morisaki\n* [[Ricky Jay]] as Marty Brown\n* John Machado as Ricardo Silva\n* [[Ray Mancini]] as George\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Jerry Weiss\n* [[Max Martini]] as Joe Collins\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Laura Black\n* [[David Paymer]] as Richie\n* [[Rebecca Pidgeon]] as Zena Frank\n* [[Cyril Takayama]] as Jimmy Takata\n* [[Jennifer Grey]] as Lucy Weiss\n* [[Jake Johnson]] as Guayabera Shirt Man\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as Hollywood Producer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Randy Couture and David Mamet by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Randy Couture]] and [[David Mamet]] at the premiere of ''Redbelt'' at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]]]\nMamet has described ''Redbelt'' as a samurai film in the tradition of [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-goldstein19jun19,1,6821892.story?coll=la-headlines-entnews&ctrack=1&cset=true | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Ultimate fighting?
