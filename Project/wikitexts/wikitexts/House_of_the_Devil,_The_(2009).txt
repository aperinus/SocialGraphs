J. Bowen]], and [[Dee Wallace]].\n\nThe plot concerns a young college student who is hired as a babysitter at an isolated house and is soon caught up in bizarre and dangerous events as she fights for her life.\n\nThe film combines elements of both the [[slasher film]] and [[haunted house]] subgenres while using the \"[[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|satanic panic]]\" of the 1980s as a central plot element. The film pays [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to horror films of the 1970s and 1980s, recreating the style of films of that era using filming techniques and similar technology to what was used then. The film's opening text claims that it is based upon true events, a technique used in some horror films, such as ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' and ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSamantha Hughes, a cash-strapped college student, responds to an ad for a babysitting job for a Mr. Ulman. Her best friend Megan gave her a ride to the Ulmans' remote mansion. Mr. Ulman reveals he actually needs Samantha to tend to his wife's mother. Samantha reluctantly agrees to a fee of $400. On the way home, Megan is shot in the head by a stranger (later identified as Victor).\n\nSamantha orders a pizza from a number Mr. Ulman had repeatedly recommended. After accidentally breaking a vase, she cleans up the mess and discovers a cupboard containing old family photographs. In one photograph, a family that is not the Ulmans stands next to the Volvo that she and Megan saw at the house. Later, three corpses are shown in one of the rooms, implying that they were the family in the photographs and the true residents of the house.\n\nUnnerved by noises in the house and the arrival of the pizza, delivered by Victor, Samantha dials 911 but tells the operator that it was an accidental call. Drugs in the pizza cause her to pass out just as she sees movements behind a door on the third floor. \n\nSamantha comes to during a [[lunar eclipse]] and finds herself bound in the center of a [[Pentagram]] on the floor. Mr. and Mrs. Ulman, along with their son Victor, begin a ritual. \"Mother\" is revealed to be a grotesque, witch-like figure. She slices her arm and pours her blood into a goat skull. She then uses it to draw occult symbols on Samantha's belly and forehead, and forces Samantha to drink the blood.\n\nSamantha stabs Mother and escapes. After finding Megan's corpse in the kitchen, she kills Victor and Mrs. Ulman, but horrific images of Mother begin appearing in her mind. Mr. Ulman chases her into a nearby cemetery, telling her that she was chosen and destined to accept \"him\". Samantha threatens to shoot Ulman, but he is resigned, telling her it is too late. Instead, Samantha shoots herself in the head. \n\nElsewhere, a TV news reports a strange lunar eclipse the night before, which confounded scientists due to its abrupt ending. \n\nSamantha lies unconscious on a hospital bed, her head in bandages. A nurse pats her belly, saying \"You will be just fine. Both of you,\u201d implying that she has been impregnated.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jocelin Donahue]] as Samantha Hughes\n*[[Tom Noonan]] as Mr. Ulman\n*[[Mary Woronov]] as Mrs. Ulman\n*[[Greta Gerwig]] as Megan\n*[[A. J. Bowen]] as Victor Ulman\n*[[Dee Wallace]] as Landlady\n*Danielle Noe as Mother\n\nAdditionally, [[Lena Dunham]] voices a 911 operator and writer-director [[Ti West]] appears as a teacher.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Connecticut]]. Taking place in the 1980s, the film was shot on [[16mm film]], giving it a [[retro]] stylistic look that matched the decade.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Zimmerman |first=Sam |date=October 28, 2009 |title=Terrifyingly Gnarly #18 \u2013 HOUSE OF THE DEVIL\u2019s A.J.
