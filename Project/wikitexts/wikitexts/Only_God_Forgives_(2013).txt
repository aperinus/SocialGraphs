Most of the criticism focused on the screenplay and characterization, while praise was directed towards the visuals and soundtrack.\n\n==Plot==\nBrothers Julian and Billy, American [[expatriate]]s, run a [[Muay Thai]] boxing club in Bangkok, Thailand, as a [[Front organization|front]] for drug dealing. Julian, the quiet one, likes to be tied up while watching his favorite prostitute, Mai, masturbate. One night, Billy rapes and kills an underage prostitute and is cornered by Thai police. Chang, the vigilante-like police lieutenant, allows the girl's father Choi to beat Billy to death. Chang later severs Choi's right forearm with his sword for allowing his daughter to be a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. During a session with Mai, Julian has a vision of his hand being cut off by Chang in a dark room.\n\nUpon discovering his brother's murder, Julian and his crew confront Choi, but Julian spares his life. Crystal, the brothers' mother, arrives in Bangkok and demands that he kill the man responsible for Billy's death. Julian refuses, believing Choi's revenge was justified. After having Choi killed, Crystal learns of Chang's involvement. She meets with Byron, a rival drug dealer, and offers to cut him into her drug operation in exchange for a hit on Chang.\n\nChang investigates Choi's murder and concludes Julian isn't the killer. That evening, Julian brings Mai, posing as his girlfriend, to meet Crystal at a restaurant. Crystal discovers the ruse, insults Mai and demeans Julian, pronouncing him sexually inferior to Billy. Julian accepts Crystal's verbal abuse and later humiliates Mai by making her strip herself on the way home from the restaurant.\n\nTwo hitmen attempt to kill Chang at a restaurant, causing the deaths of numerous customers and two of Chang's men. Chang kills one, then brutally tortures and interrogates the other one. The hitman leads Chang to Li Po, who has resorted to arranging hits to for his disabled son. Chang kills the hitman but spares Li Po. Chang finds Byron in a club and tortures him to death, but fails to find who ordered the hit.\n\nAfter recognizing Chang as the man from his visions and failing to follow him, Julian eventually finds Chang and challenges him to a fight. Chang quickly defeats Julian, who fails to land a single blow. Afterwards, Crystal tells Julian that Chang has figured out she ordered the hit. She pleads with Julian to kill Chang, like he killed his father for her. She promises that after Julian eliminates Chang, they'll go back home and she'll be a true mother to him.\n\nWith his associate Charlie, Julian infiltrates Chang's home and plan to ambush him. After learning Charlie was instructed to execute the entire family, Julian kills Charlie before he can murder Chang's daughter.\n\nChang confronts Crystal in her hotel room. She tells him that Julian killed his father with his bare hands and that Julian is violent and deranged. Chang stabs her in the throat. Later, Julian returns to the hotel and finds his mother's corpse. He approaches her body, cuts open her abdomen, and shoves his hand inside it.\n\nJulian later stands in a field with Chang, who cuts off his hands with a sword. Chang is last seen performing a passionate song in a karaoke club filled with fellow police officers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Julian Thompson, an American who lives in Bangkok and \"is a respected figure in the criminal underworld\" according to a production synopsis.<ref name=\"Goldberg\">{{cite web |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |title=First Synopsis for Nicolas Winding Refn's ''ONLY GOD FORGIVES'' Starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Ryan Gosling |url=http://collider.com/only-god-forgives-movie-synopsis/124050 |work=Collider.com |access-date=11 July 2012 |date=2 November 2011}}</ref> Gosling was in negotiations to star in the film in June 2011 after [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''.<ref name=\"Gosling\">{{cite web |last=Fischer |first= Russ |title=Ryan Gosling Joining Nicolas Winding Refn's ''Only God Forgives'' [Updated] |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/ryan-gosling-joining-nicolas-winding-refn-only-god-forgives |work=[[/Film]] |date=23 June 2011 |access-date=7 March 2012}}</ref> Gosling had undertaken [[Muay Thai]] training in preparation for the role by that September,<ref name=\"Otto\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/ryan_gosling_calls_upcoming_project_only_god_forgives_the_strangest_thing_h |title=Ryan Gosling Calls Upcoming Project ''Only God Forgives'' The \"Strangest Thing\" He's Ever Read |last=Otto |first=Jeff |date=26 September 2011 |work=The Playlist |publisher=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=7 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031052449/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/ryan_gosling_calls_upcoming_project_only_god_forgives_the_strangest_thing_h |archive-date=31 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which included 2\u20133 hour daily sessions.<ref name=\"Mackey\">{{cite web |last=Mackey |first=Michael |title=Ryan Gosling Responds to Oscar Snub; Reveals Details of Project Filming in Bangkok |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ryan-gosling-thailand-oscars-only-god-forgives-285437 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=10 July 2012 |date=27 January 2012}}</ref> Refn also participated in the training.<ref name=\"Mackey\" /> Gosling and Refn had recently worked together on the neo-noir action drama ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011).
