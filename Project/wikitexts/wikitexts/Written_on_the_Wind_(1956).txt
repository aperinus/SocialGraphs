It follows the [[dysfunctional family]] members of a Texas oil dynasty, including the complicated relationships among its alcoholic heir; his wife, a former secretary for the family company; his childhood best friend; and his ruthless, self-destructive sister.\n\nThe screenplay by [[George Zuckerman]] was based on [[Robert Wilder (novelist)|Robert Wilder]]'s 1946 novel of the same title, a thinly disguised account (or ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'') of the real-life scandal involving [[torch song|torch singer]] [[Libby Holman]] and her husband, tobacco heir [[Zachary Smith Reynolds]], who was killed under mysterious circumstances at his family estate in 1932. A film version of the novel was optioned by [[RKO Pictures]] and [[International Pictures]] in 1946, but the project was shelved due to threats from the Reynolds family. [[Universal Pictures]] acquired the rights to the novel after absorbing International Pictures, and began developing the film in 1955. Zuckerman made numerous alterations in his screenplay to avoid lawsuits from the Reynolds family, among them shifting the setting from [[North Carolina]] to Texas, and having the family fortune originate in oil rather than tobacco.\n\nFilmed in Los Angeles in late-1955 and early-1956, ''Written on the Wind'' was released theatrically in England in the fall of 1956 before opening in the United States on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 1956. The film broke opening-day box office records for Universal, and was a financial success. Malone won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHl9D9I0Svw Dorothy Malone Wins Supporting Actress: 1957 Oscars]</ref> Stack was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], and [[Victor Young]] and [[Sammy Cahn]] were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].\n\n==Plot==\nInsecure, [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] playboy Kyle and his self-destructive sister Marylee are the children of Texas [[oil baron]] Jasper Hadley. Spoiled by their familial wealth and crippled by their personal demons, neither is able to sustain a personal relationship. Marylee has long been in love with Kyle's childhood friend Mitch Wayne, who is now a geologist for the Hadley Oil Company, but he sees her as a sister. She responds to his repeated rejections by pursuing brief physical relationships with various local men. Kyle continually seeks the approval of his father, who instead has long admired Mitch's humbleness and work ethic over that of his own children.\n\nKyle and Mitch take a business trip to New York City, where they meet Lucy Moore, an aloof [[secretary]] who works at the Hadley Company's Manhattan offices. While Lucy initially expresses interest in Mitch, it is Kyle who begins to court her. Lucy's cool demeanor fails to deter Kyle, and he invites her to accompany him on his private plane to Miami, which she accepts. After the trip, Kyle impulsively asks Lucy to marry him, and she agrees. The two return to Texas after a whirlwind honeymoon, and Lucy proves to be a stabilizing influence on his life throughout the first year of their marriage. Meanwhile, Marylee attempts to forge a romantic relationship with Mitch, whom she vows to marry, though Mitch secretly longs to be with Lucy.\n\nShortly after Kyle and Lucy's first wedding anniversary, Kyle learns from his doctor that he has a [[Oligospermia|low sperm count]] and could be [[Male infertility|infertile]]. This news sends him into a deep depression, and he begins drinking heavily, at one point becoming severely intoxicated at the local [[country club]] and embarrassing Lucy. At the Hadley estate, Jasper confides in Mitch about his disappointment in his children, who he feels are reckless and irresponsible. Moments later, Marylee arrives at the house, escorted by police following a lovers' quarrel. That night, a defeated Jasper loses his grip on the railing and tumbles down the long front hall staircase. Mitch turns him over: He is dead. Jasper's death further destabilizes Kyle, and Lucy unsuccessfully attempts to help him overcome his self-loathing.\n\nMitch informs Lucy that he plans to quit his job at the Hadley Oil Company and relocate to [[Pahlavi Iran|Iran]]. Mitch drives Lucy to a doctor's appointment, where she learns that she is pregnant; the doctor also informs her about his prior diagnosis of Kyle's infertility. That night, during a dinner with Mitch and Marylee, Lucy reveals her pregnancy to Kyle. Assuming Mitch is the father and that he and Lucy are having an affair, Kyle enters a drunken rage and assaults Lucy, but is stopped by Mitch, who forces him out of the house. The attack results in Lucy suffering a [[miscarriage]] that night. Meanwhile, an emasculated, inebriated Kyle visits the local tavern before returning to the house brandishing a pistol, intent on murdering Mitch. Marylee attempts to stop him, and, during the struggle over the gun, the weapon discharges, killing Kyle.\n\nResentful of Mitch's love for Lucy, Marylee attempts to coerce Mitch into marrying her by threatening to tell police he murdered Kyle. Mitch denies her, and, at the [[inquest]], she first testifies that Mitch shot Kyle, but then tearfully changes her story and describes events as they really occurred. Mitch and Lucy leave the Hadley home together. Marylee is left to mourn the death of her brother and run the company alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rock Hudson]] as Mitch Wayne\n* [[Lauren Bacall]] as Lucy Moore Hadley\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Kyle Hadley\n* [[Dorothy Malone]] as Marylee Hadley\n* [[Robert Keith (actor)|Robert Keith]] as Jasper Hadley\n* [[Grant Williams (actor)|Grant Williams]] as Biff Miley\n* [[Robert J.

At the same time she was shooting the film, she was preparing for a television adaptation of [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'', co-starring Coward and [[Claudette Colbert]].\n\n[[Dorothy Malone]], a brunette previously best known as the brainy bespectacled bookstore clerk in a scene with [[Humphrey Bogart]] in ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946), had more recently played small supporting roles in a long string of [[B movies]]. For this film, she dyed her hair [[Blond#platinum blond|platinum blonde]] to shed her \"nice girl\" image and portray the obsessive Marylee Hadley. Her Oscar-winning performance finally gave her cachet in the film industry.\n\n[[Robert Stack]] felt the primary reason he lost the Oscar to [[Anthony Quinn]] (whose winning performance in ''[[Lust for Life (1956 film)|Lust for Life]]'' was no more than 25 minutes long) was that [[20th Century Fox]], which had lent him to [[Universal Pictures|Universal-International]], organized block voting against him to prevent one of its contract players from winning an acting award while working at another studio.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Written on the Wind (1957) \u2013 Articles|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/96313/Written-on-the-Wind/articles.html|access-date=2020-08-07|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref>\n\nThis was the sixth of eight films [[Douglas Sirk]] made with [[Rock Hudson]], and the most successful.

Sirk is the one who established their tone, in which shocking behavior is treated with passionate solemnity, while [[parody]] burbles beneath.... To appreciate a film like ''Written on the Wind'' probably takes more sophistication than to understand one of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s masterpieces, because Bergman's themes are visible and underlined, while with Sirk, the style conceals the message. His interiors are wildly over the top, and his exteriors are phony\u2014he wants you to notice the artifice, to see that he's not using realism but an exaggerated Hollywood studio style.... Films like this are both above and below middle-brow taste. If you only see the surface, it's trashy [[soap opera]]. If you can see the style, the absurdity, the exaggeration, and the satirical humor, it's subversive of all the 1950s dramas that handled such material solemnly. [[William Inge]] and [[Tennessee Williams]] were taken with great seriousness during the decade, but Sirk kids their [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] hysteria.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-written-on-the-wind-1956|title=Written on the Wind Movie Review (1956)|first=Roger|last=Ebert|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author-link=Roger Ebert|access-date=April 29, 2022|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' described the film as \"the ultimate in lush melodrama\", \"Douglas Sirk's finest directorial effort\", and \"one of the most notable critiques of the American family ever made.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/written-wind/review/123199|title=Written On The Wind|work=[[TV Guide]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402110630/https://www.tvguide.com/movies/written-wind/review/123199/|archive-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLeonard Maltin gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \"Irresistible kitsch.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Written on the Wind (1957) \u2013 Overview|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/96313/Written-on-the-Wind/|access-date=2020-08-07|publisher=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Richard Brody]] discusses the film, which he says may be \"Sirk's most full-blossomed achievement\", in a video posted on the magazine's website in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brody|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Brody|title=Movie of the Week: \"Written on the Wind\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-written-on-the-wind|work=[[The New Yorker]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210731080405/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-of-the-week-written-on-the-wind|archive-date=July 31, 2021|date=December 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, actress Lauren Bacall accepted the [[Texas Film Hall of Fame|Frontier Award]] on behalf of the film from the [[Austin Film Society]], which annually makes inductions into the [[Texas Film Hall of Fame]] recognizing actors, directors, screenwriters, filmmakers, and films from, influenced by, or inspired by the Lone Star State.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[List of American films of 1956]]\n* [[Modernist film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=Evans|first=Peter William|year=2013|series=[[British Film Institute|BFI Film Classics]]|isbn=978-1-844-57866-5|title=Written on the Wind|location=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Written on the Wind (film)|Written on the Wind}}\n* {{IMDb title|0049966}}\n* {{AllMovie title|55624}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|written_on_the_wind}}\n* {{AFI film|52070}}\n* {{TCMDb title|96313}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/97-written-on-the-wind Essay] by [[Laura Mulvey]] at [[The Criterion Collection]]\n* [https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/front-row-written-on-the-wind Richard Brody's take on ''Written on the Wind'']\n\n{{Douglas Sirk}}\n{{Albert Zugsmith}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1956 films]]\n[[Category:1956 drama films]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1950s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:American psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films \u00e0 clef]]\n[[Category:Films about alcoholism]]\n[[Category:Films about depression]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about siblings]]\n[[Category:Films about the upper class]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Douglas Sirk]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Frank Skinner]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Southern Gothic films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]"}]}}}}
