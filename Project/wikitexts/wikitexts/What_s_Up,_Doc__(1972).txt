It was intended to pay homage to comedy films of the 1930s and 1940s, especially ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'',<ref>Peter Bogdanovich's commentary on the ''Bringing Up Baby'' DVD</ref> and Warner Bros. [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoons.\n\n''What's Up, Doc?'' was a success, and became the third-highest grossing film of 1972. It won the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) 1973 \"[[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen]]\" award for [[Buck Henry]], [[David Newman (filmmaker)|David Newman]] and [[Robert Benton]].

Howard is accompanied by his tightly wound, overbearing fianc\u00e9e Eunice Burns. As the two check into the Hotel Bristol, Howard runs into the charming trouble-magnet Judy Maxwell in the drug store. She never finished college, but nevertheless has amassed a considerable amount of knowledge from all of the academic institutions from which she was expelled. She begins to pursue Howard and lodges herself in the hotel without paying.\n\nCoincidentally, four parties are staying on the same floor of the Bristol, all carrying identical plaid overnight bags:\n*Howard's bag contains [[igneous]] \"tambula\" rocks that have certain musical properties.\n*The mysterious \"Mr. Smith\" has a bag containing top-secret government papers, which he has obtained illegally. He is followed by the equally mysterious \"Mr. Jones\", a government agent on a mission to recover the documents. \n*Wealthy socialite Mrs. Van Hoskins has a bag containing her sizable collection of valuable jewels. Hotel employees Harry and Fritz attempt to steal the jewels.\n*Judy's bag is filled with her clothing and a large dictionary.\n\nOver the course of the evening, the bags get switched haphazardly from room to room as the four parties unwittingly take one another's suitcases. Howard ends up with the jewels, Judy with the documents, Mr. Smith with Judy's clothes, and the thieves with the rocks.\n\nJudy, masquerading as Eunice at the musicologists' banquet, uses her humor, wit and academic knowledge to charm everyone except Howard's competitor, Hugh Simon. Unable to overcome Judy's pretense &ndash; and realizing Larrabee's infatuation with her might win him the grant  &ndash; Howard denies knowing the real Eunice when she tries to enter the banquet. Judy later intrudes into Howard's hotel room. His attempts to hide her presence from Eunice eventually lead to a fire and the destruction of the room.\n\nThe following day, everyone makes their way to a reception in Larrabee's upscale [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home, where a fight breaks out involving guns, furnishings, and thrown pies. Howard and Judy take all four bags and flee through San Francisco, first on a delivery bike, and then in a decorated [[Volkswagen Beetle]] stolen from a wedding party, pursued by Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones and the jewel thieves, who also have taken Eunice, Larrabee and Hugh Simon hostage. They go through [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]] disrupting a parade, down [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]], through wet cement, through a panel of glass, and eventually into [[San Francisco Bay]] at the ferry landing, after causing several collisions.\n\nEveryone ends up in a court room, where Judge Maxwell, already on the point of a nervous breakdown, tries to clear up the matter but only succeeds in finding his daughter Judy as the cause of all the trouble. Later, after the bags have been returned to their rightful owners, Howard and Judy find themselves at the airport again. \"Mr. Smith\" is pursuing \"Mr. Jones\", who is now back in possession of the government papers, while the thieves plan their escape from the country. Mrs. Van Hoskins pays for the considerable damage and splits the remaining $50 of the reward she had offered among those who helped retrieve her jewels. Eunice appears with Larrabee and Hugh Simon, who won the grant. However, he is exposed by Judy as a plagiarist, thus getting Howard the grant after all. Still, Eunice leaves Howard for Larrabee.\n\nHoward boards a plane back to Iowa alone, only to find Judy in the seat behind him. He declares his love for her and apologizes for what he said earlier. Judy responds: \"[[Love means never having to say you're sorry]]\" &ndash; a reference to the 1970 film ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' also starring Ryan O'Neal &ndash; to which Howard replies,  \"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.\" As the two kiss, the film ends with a scene from the [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon [[What's Up, Doc? (1950 film)|that gave the film its name]], screened on the plane.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Barbra Streisand]] as Judy Maxwell\n*[[Ryan O'Neal]] as Howard Bannister\n*[[Madeline Kahn]] as Eunice Burns\n*[[Kenneth Mars]] as Hugh Simon\n*[[Austin Pendleton]] as Frederick Larrabee\n*[[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Mr. Smith\n*[[Philip Roth (actor)|Philip Roth]] as Mr. Jones\n*[[Sorrell Booke]] as Harry\n*[[Stefan Gierasch]] as Fritz\n*[[Mabel Albertson]] as Mrs. Van Hoskins\n*[[Liam Dunn]] as Judge Maxwell\n*[[John Hillerman]] as Hotel Manager Kaltenborn\n*[[George Morfogen]] as Rudy, Head Waiter\n*[[Graham Jarvis]] as Bailiff\n*[[Randy Quaid]] as Professor Hosquith\n*[[M.

The opening scene was filmed in the downstairs [[TWA]] Baggage Claim area, and the next to last scene was filmed in the upstairs departure area beneath the arrival/departure board and at the flight insurance counter.\n\nThe [[Hilton Hotels|San Francisco Hilton]] was the shooting location for the Bristol Hotel.\nThe exterior of the hotel, where Streisand is hanging from a ledge, was shot in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]].\n\nThe San Francisco<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mistersf.com/cinema/index.html?cinwhatsup.htm|title=MisterSF.com|website=www.mistersf.com|access-date=Oct 9, 2019}}</ref> setting was chosen to allow an elaborate comic spoof of the San Francisco car chase in the hit 1968 film ''[[Bullitt]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bjsmusic.com/fawk-tv23.html| title=''What's Up, Doc?''

In another scene, their out of control bike goes down Clay Street in [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]]. The Volkswagen Beetle is stolen from the curb in front of [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, San Francisco|Saint Peter and Paul Church]] at [[Washington Square (San Francisco)|Washington Square Park]], and the Beetle hides on a car carrier on Sacramento St. just west of Van Ness Avenue, in an area where many car dealerships were once located (Van Ness was San Francisco's \"Auto Row\"). The production did not have permission from the city to drive cars down the concrete steps in [[Alta Plaza Park]] in [[San Francisco]]; these were badly damaged during filming and still show the scars today. At the end of the car chase, almost everyone ends up foundering in San Francisco Bay\u2014except O'Neal and Streisand, comfortably afloat in their [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. During the making of this scene, the actor [[Sorrell Booke]] almost drowned in the Bay.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe final scene on board a [[TWA]] [[Boeing 707]] shows O'Neal looking out the righthand window showing the [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina District]] and the [[Embarcadero Freeway]].\n\n==Music==\nAlthough ''What's Up, Doc?'' is not a [[Musical theater|musical]], it contains some singing and other musical moments. The song \"[[You're the Top]]\" from the [[Musical theater|musical]] ''[[Anything Goes]]'' is sung as a solo during the opening credits by Streisand, and as a duet during the closing credits by Streisand and O'Neal.  The same [[Cole Porter]] musical supplied at least two other tunes played as background music: \"[[Anything Goes (Cole Porter song)|Anything Goes]]\" and \"[[I Get a Kick Out of You]]\", heard during the first hotel lobby scene.\n\n\u201c[[Funicul\u00ec, Funicul\u00e0]]\u201d is whistled by the Streisand character as she crosses the street, following the pizza delivery man, into the Bristol Hotel before the first hotel lobby scene.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the way into the film, Howard accompanies Judy at a piano (on a floor of the Hotel Bristol apparently under construction or renovation) as she sings the beginning of \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" (made famous in the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''). The scene includes Streisand imitating [[Humphrey Bogart]] with the line, \"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, he walks into mine. Play it, Sam.\"\n\nMusical in-jokes appear throughout the film. Over-the-top [[Elevator music|Muzak]]-styled [[elevator music]] featuring Cole Porter's songs is used throughout the hotel elevator scenes. In the chase scene, a Chinese marching band is inexplicably playing the Mexican tune \"[[La Cucaracha]]\" (although, in certain prints, it sounds more like \"[[Deep in the Heart of Texas]]\") on German glockenspiels. At the American Musicologists' banquet, themes from [[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s ''Orch\u00e9sographie'' can be heard in the background, incongruously played on a [[Hammond organ]] and a [[sitar]].\n\nGeorge Gershwin's \"[[Someone to Watch Over Me (song)|Someone to Watch over Me]]\" is whistled by Streisand outside the hotel drug store.\n\nThe Bugs Bunny [[Number (music)|number]]&mdash;derived from his characteristic tagline&mdash;that gives the movie its title appears as well, with the original animation, in the last scene.  Instrumental versions of \"[[Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone]]\", an old [[Tin Pan Alley]] hit which had appeared in [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon ''[[One Froggy Evening]],'' are background music during the opening scene in the airport.\n\nHowever, as with ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', all the music is [[Diegetic music|diegetic]]\u2014there is no underscoring anywhere in the film.\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City on March 9, 1972.<ref name=AFI/><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 23, 1972|page=7|title=WB's Habit of Last-Possible-Moment Screenings Irritates New York Critics}}</ref>\n===Home media===\n''What's Up, Doc?'' was originally released on [[VHS]] in 1982.\n\nAs part of a collector's box set of Streisand's films, it was released on [[DVD]] in July 2003 and then on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in August 2010.\n\nIt is also available to purchase or rent by downloading the digital media formats at [[iTunes Store]] and [[Google Play Store]].\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn the United States and Canada, the movie grossed $66,000,000<ref name=\"box office mojo\"/> against a budget of $4 million.<ref name=\"popmatters\"/> It became the [[1972 in film|3rd highest grossing film of the year]], ranking behind ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]''.\n\n===Critical response===\nAs of June 2021, the film held an 89% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10.
