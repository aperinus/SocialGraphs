Tykwer, with [[:de:Johnny Klimek|Johnny Klimek]] and [[Reinhold Heil]], also composed the music. The screenplay, by Tykwer, [[Andrew Birkin]] and [[Bernd Eichinger]], is based on [[Patrick S\u00fcskind]]'s 1985 novel [[Perfume (novel)|of the same name]]. Set in [[Early Modern France#France in the 17th and 18th centuries|18th-century France]], the film tells the story of [[Jean-Baptiste Grenouille]] (Whishaw), an [[Olfaction|olfactory]] genius, and his homicidal quest for the perfect scent.\n\nProducer Eichinger bought the film rights to S\u00fcskind's novel in 2000 and began writing the screenplay together with Birkin. Tykwer was selected as the director and joined the two in developing the screenplay in 2003. [[Principal photography]] began on July 12, 2005 and concluded on October 16, 2005; filming took place in Spain, Germany, and France. The film was made on a budget of [[Euro|\u20ac]]50 million (est. [[United States dollar|$]]60 million), making it one of the most expensive German films.\n\n''Perfume'' was released on September 14, 2006 in Germany, December 26, 2006 in the United Kingdom, and December 27, 2006 in the United States. It grossed over $135 million worldwide, of which over $53 million was made in Germany. Critics' reviews of the film were mixed; the consensus was that the film had strong cinematography and acting but suffered from an uneven screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please keep the plot summary under 700 words. It is unnecessary to include every little detail. -->\nThe film begins with the sentencing of [[Jean-Baptiste Grenouille]], a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner's]] apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in all the new scents. He focuses on a redheaded girl selling yellow plums, following her and repeatedly attempting to sniff her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.\n\nAfter making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini, with his ability to identify and create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to preserve scents. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. Grenouille continues working for Baldini but is saddened when he learns that Baldini's method of [[distillation]] will not capture the scents of all objects. Baldini informs Grenouille of another method that can be learned in [[Grasse]] and agrees to help him by providing the journeyman papers he requires in exchange for 100 new perfume formulas. Right after Grenouille departs, Baldini dies when the shaky building, along with his studio, collapses. En route to Grasse, Grenouille decides to exile himself from society, taking refuge in a cave. During this time, he discovers that he lacks any [[body odor|personal scent]] himself, and believes this is why he is perceived as strange or disturbing by others. Deciding to continue his quest, he leaves his cave and continues to Grasse.\n\nUpon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of Laure Richis, the beautiful, redheaded daughter of the wealthy Antoine Richis and decides that she will be his \"thirteenth scent\", the linchpin of his perfume. Grenouille finds a job in Grasse under Madame Arnulfi and learns the method of [[enfleurage]]. He kills a young lavender picker and attempts to extract her scent using the method of hot enfleurage, which fails. After this, he attempts the method of cold enfleurage on a prostitute he hired, but she becomes alarmed and tries to throw him out. He murders her and successfully preserves the scent of the woman. Grenouille embarks on a killing spree, targeting beautiful young women and capturing their scents using his perfected method. He dumps the women's naked corpses around the city, creating panic. After preserving the first twelve scents, Grenouille plans his attack on Laure. In church, after the Bishop of Grasse declares that the murderer has been [[excommunication|excommunicated]], it is announced that a man has confessed to the murders. Richis remains unconvinced and secretly flees the city with his daughter, telling no one their destination. Grenouille tracks her scent to a roadside inn and sneaks into her room that night, murdering her.\n\nSoldiers capture Grenouille moments after he finishes preparing his perfume. On the day of his execution, he applies the perfume on himself, forcing the jailers to release him. The executioner and the crowd in attendance are speechless at the beauty of the perfume; they declare Grenouille innocent before falling into a massive [[orgy]]. Richis, still convinced of Grenouille's guilt, threatens him with his sword, but he is then overwhelmed by the scent and embraces Grenouille as his \"son.\" Walking out of Grasse unscathed, Grenouille has enough perfume to rule the world, but has discovered that it will not allow him to love or be loved like a normal person. Disenchanted by his aimless quest, he returns to the Parisian fish market where he was abandoned as a child and pours the remaining perfume over his head. Overcome by the scent and in the belief that Grenouille is an angel, the nearby crowd [[cannibalism|devours]] him. The next morning, all that is left are his clothes and the empty bottle, from which one final drop of perfume falls.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ben Whishaw]] as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as Antoine Richis  \n* [[Rachel Hurd-Wood]] as Laure Richis  \n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Giuseppe Baldini\n* [[Sian Thomas]] as Madame Gaillard  \n* [[Corinna Harfouch]] as Madame Arnulfi    \n* [[Sam Douglas]] as Grimal \n* [[Birgit Minichmayr]] as Grenouille's mother\n* [[Karoline Herfurth]] as redheaded girl selling plums\n* Carlos Gramaje as Police Lieutenant\n* [[David Calder (actor)|David Calder]] as Bishop of Grasse\n* [[Jessica Schwarz]] as Natalie\n* Joanna Griffiths as Marianne\n* [[Sara Forestier]] as Jeanne\n* Timothy Davies as Chenier\n* Paul Berrondo as Druot\n* [[John Hurt]] as the narrator (English version) \n* [[Otto Sander]] as the narrator (German version)\n* [[Jacques Perrin]] as the narrator (French version)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Bernd Eichinger (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Bernd Eichinger|Producer [[Bernd Eichinger]] was denied the rights to the film when he first tried to obtain them in 1985]]\n''Perfume: The Story of a Murderer'' is based on the 1985 novel by [[Patrick S\u00fcskind]], which has sold over 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"prod\" /> S\u00fcskind reportedly thought that only [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Milo\u0161 Forman]] could do the book justice and refused to let anyone else [[Film adaptation|adapt it to film]].<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news|title='Perfume': How a director filmed the unfilmable novel |first=Stephen |last=Applebaum |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/perfume-how-a-director-filmed-the-unfilmable-novel-430133.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=December 29, 2006 |access-date=December 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616160502/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/perfume-how-a-director-filmed-the-unfilmable-novel-430133.html |archive-date=June 16, 2010 |location=London |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> <!-- Kubrick considered adapting it but allegedly concluded that it was unable to be filmed.<ref name=\"independent\" /> --> [[Bernd Eichinger]], the film's producer, read the novel when it was first released and immediately approached S\u00fcskind, who was also a friend of his, to obtain the film rights \u2014 S\u00fcskind refused.<ref name=\"prod\">{{cite press release|title=Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Production Notes |url=http://thecia.com.au/reviews/p/images/perfume-the-story-of-a-murderer-das-parfum-die-geschichte-eines-morders-production-notes.rtf |format=RTF |publisher=Path\u00e9 Distribution |access-date=December 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012165121/http://thecia.com.au/reviews/p/images/perfume-the-story-of-a-murderer-das-parfum-die-geschichte-eines-morders-production-notes.rtf |archive-date=October 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> In 2000, S\u00fcskind relented and sold Eichinger the rights.<ref name=\"prod\" /> Eichinger had to take out a personal loan because the supervisory board of [[Constantin Film]] refused to approve the selling price.<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany's Most Famous Producer Gets Little Love at Home |first=Lars-Olav |last=Beier |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,676142-2,00.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=May 2, 2010 |access-date=December 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210061030/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,676142-2,00.html |archive-date=February 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> He is rumored to have paid \u20ac10 million for the film rights.<ref name=\"spiegel\">{{cite news |title=Perfume the Film: Worth the Wait? |first=Urs |last=Jenny |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,435918,00.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=August 9, 2006 |access-date=December 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727150353/http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,435918,00.html |archive-date=July 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> The author had no involvement in the project.<ref name=\"post1\">{{cite journal |last = Blair |first = Iain |editor-last = Altman |editor-first= Randi |title = Tom Tykwer: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer |journal = Post |issue = January 2007 |publisher = COP Communications |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HNN/is_1_22/ai_n27144130/ |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130424044635/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HNN/is_1_22/ai_n27144130/ |url-status = dead |archive-date = April 24, 2013 |access-date = December 11, 2009 }}</ref> Artist/director [[Julian Schnabel]] wanted to direct a film version of the novel and wrote a script based on the novel.

[[Karoline Herfurth]], who had twice worked with Tykwer, was asked to do a [[screen test]] with Whishaw, in costume. Herfurth proved herself to Tykwer and her role was expanded.<ref name=\"prod\" />\n\nA total of 5,200 extras were used for the film, sometimes with nearly a thousand at once. The orgy scene at the film's climax required 750 extras. 50 key players from the dance theater group [[La Fura dels Baus]] and 100 relatively experienced talents formed the core of the crowd. The remaining 600 extras were arranged around this group of 150 performers.<ref name=\"prod\" />\n\n===Design===\n\nTo help define the film's look the crew watched period films such as ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', ''[[Oliver Twist (1922 film)|Oliver Twist]]'', ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'', ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'', ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Dracula]]'', ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'', ''[[Vidocq (2001 film)|Vidocq]]'', and ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (1998 film)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.<ref name=\"ac1\" /> Cinematographer [[Frank Griebe]] said that of all the films they watched that had been shot on location, none of them really had the dirt and grit of the city that they desired for ''Perfume''. \"We needed a filthy city to get the real feel for the smells of it\", said Griebe. Tykwer wanted to recreate 18th-century Paris, as seen through the eyes of the lower-class Grenouille and said that he wanted to shoot the film \"as if we were thrown into a time machine with a camera.\"<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\nTykwer describes the film as having \"a distinctly dark aesthetic\", due to both the lack of adequate lighting during the film's time period and the nature of its storyline.<ref name=\"prod\" /> The filmmakers took inspiration from painters that specialized in darkness with few sources of light such as [[Caravaggio]], [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and [[Rembrandt]].<ref name=\"prod\" /> The film begins with a cool, monochromatic color palette, and as Grenouille discovers more scents, the palette warms and opens up. In the scenes where Grenouille goes to Paris for the first time, the filmmakers subtly added more powerful colors in the sets, costumes, props and lighting to represent Grenouille's experience of the new smells.<ref name=\"ac1\" />\n\nOne of the main challenges of making the film was to convey the smells and the world of scents that Grenouille experiences. Tykwer said that to him ''Perfume'' \"was much more a film about the importance of smell in our life than a film that tries to be smelly.\"<ref name=\"independent\" /> The filmmakers strived to convey smell visually without the use of colors or special effects,<ref name=\"prod\" /> Griebe says \"people see the fish market full of raw, bloody fish, and they know it stinks; they see a field of lavender and know it smells wonderful. We show Grenouille taking in smells by cupping his nose, and by doing close shots of his nose, and that's it!\"<ref name=\"ac1\" />\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = \"S\u00fcskind's gift is in his ability to let his readers, through language, experience Grenouille's world, which is revealed solely through his sense of smell.

Additionally, the actors were required to wear the costumes and more or less live in them prior to shooting.<ref name=\"prod\" /> The character Grenouille was not given any white clothing and wore bluish over-garments throughout most of the film because the filmmakers wanted to depict him as a shadow and a [[chameleon]].<ref name=\"prod\" /> Instead of dressing the character of Laure in the colorful regional dress that was the tradition of the time, she was dressed in the less vivid tones of a Parisian damsel to highlight her social aspirations as well as her red hair.<ref name=\"prod\" />\n\n===Filming===\nAlthough the filmmakers needed an 18th-century French setting, shooting the film in its original setting of Paris was unlikely due to the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|extensive modernization]] of the city in the 19th century.<ref name=\"ac1\" /><ref name=\"about2\">{{cite news|title=Exclusive Interview with Filmmaker Tom Tykwer |first=Rebecca |last=Murray |url=http://movies.about.com/od/perfume/a/perfume122006_2.htm |work=[[About.com]] |date=November 2006 |access-date=December 11, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003100102/http://movies.about.com/od/perfume/a/perfume122006_2.htm |archive-date=October 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> [[Croatia]] was initially considered as an alternative because of its earthy scenery and pristine old-world towns,<ref name=\"prod\" /> but even though the price was right, the distance between locations proved to be disadvantageous.<ref name=\"ac1\" /> In the end, the filmmakers opted to shoot most of the film in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]] which, although more expensive than [[Croatia]], offered locations which were closer to each other.<ref name=\"ac1\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on July 12, 2005 at Rolling Thunder Skate Park. and concluded on October 16, 2005.

[[El G\u00f2tic|El Barri G\u00f2tic]] (the Gothic Quarter), part of Barcelona's historic town center, was converted into a Parisian fish market. [[Poble Espanyol]], an open-air museum in Barcelona, was the location for the climactic orgy scene. To create an authentic dirty look, the film's crew included a \"dirt unit\" of about 60 people whose job was to distribute detritus over the city. Two and a half tons of fish and one ton of meat was dispersed in El G\u00f2tic.<ref name=\"prod\" /> Several mountain and forest scenes were shot in the environs of Girona.
