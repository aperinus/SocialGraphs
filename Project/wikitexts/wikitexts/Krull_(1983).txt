[http://www.empireonline.com/movies/krull/review/ \"Krull review\"]. ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''. [[Bauer Media Group]]. Retrieved 28 August 2017.</ref> directed by [[Peter Yates]] and written by [[Stanford Sherman]]. It follows Prince Colwyn and a fellowship of companions set out to rescue his bride, Princess Lyssa, from a fortress of alien invaders who have arrived on their home planet.\n\nThe film stars an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Kenneth Marshall]] as Prince Colwyn, [[Lysette Anthony]] as Princess Lyssa, [[Trevor Martin]] as the voice of the Beast, [[Freddie Jones]] as Ynyr, [[Bernard Bresslaw]] as Rell the Cyclops, [[David Battley]] as Ergo the Magnificent, [[Tony Church]] and [[Bernard Archard]] as kings and the fathers of Colwyn and Lyssa, [[Alun Armstrong]] as the leader of a group of bandits that include early screen roles for actors [[Liam Neeson]] and [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[John Welsh (actor)|John Welsh]] as The Emerald Seer, [[Graham McGrath]] as Titch, and [[Francesca Annis]] as The Widow of the Web.\n\nDevelopment on the film began in 1980, when [[Columbia Pictures]] President [[Frank Price]] gave producer Ron Silverman the idea to produce a fantasy film. ''Krull'' underwent a very expensive production process, mainly due to the designers having to make numerous alterations to the sets corresponding to the heavily evolving script. The movie was shot at several [[sound stage|sound stages]] at [[Pinewood Studio]]. Actors such as Marshall, Bresslaw, and Jones performed dangerous stunts during filming.\n\nAn international co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States, ''Krull'' was released in July 1983. The film was a [[box-office bomb]] upon release, and critical opinion has been mixed, both upon release and in retrospect. Numerous reviewers have highlighted its visual effects and soundtrack, while several critics have criticized its plot as being derivative and nonsensical. The film has gone on to achieve [[cult film]] status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reflectionsonfilmandtelevision.blogspot.com.ar/2010/11/cult-movie-review-krull-1983.html|title=CULT MOVIE REVIEW: Krull (1983)|first=John Kenneth|last=Muir|work=Reflections on Cult Movies and Classic TV|date=5 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA narrator describes a prophecy regarding \"a girl of ancient name that shall become queen,\" who \"shall choose a king, and that together they shall rule their world, and that their son shall rule the galaxy.\"\n\nThe planet Krull is invaded by an entity known as the Beast and his army of Slayers, who travel the galaxy in a mountain-like spaceship called the Black Fortress. In a wedding ceremony involving the couple exchanging a handful of flame, Prince Colwyn and Princess Lyssa plan to marry and form an alliance between their rival kingdoms in the hope that their combined forces can defeat the Beast's army. The Slayers attack before the ceremony is completed, killing the two kings, devastating both armies, and kidnapping the princess.\n\nPrince Colwyn is found and nursed by Ynyr, the Old One. Ynyr tells him that the Beast can be defeated with the Glaive, an ancient, magical, five-pointed throwing star.{{ref label|glaive|a}} Colwyn retrieves the Glaive from a high mountain cave before setting out to track down the Black Fortress, which teleports to a new location every day at sunrise. As they travel, Colwyn and Ynyr are joined by the magician Ergo \"the Magnificent\" and a band of nine thieves, fighters, bandits, and brawlers. Colwyn offers to clear their criminal records, successfully enlisting Torquil, Kegan, Rhun, Oswyn, Bardolph, Menno, Darro, Nennog, and Quain. The [[cyclops]] Rell later joins the group.\n\nColwyn's group travels to the home of the Emerald Seer and his apprentice, Titch. The Emerald Seer uses his crystal to view where the Fortress will rise, but the Beast's hand magically appears and crushes the crystal. The group travels to a swamp that the Beast's magic cannot penetrate, but lose Quain to a slayer attack and Nennog to quicksand. An agent of the Beast, a changeling, kills the Emerald Seer before he can confirm the next location of the Fortress and assumes his form, but is uncovered and killed by Rell and Colwyn.\n\nWhile the group rests in a forest, Kegan goes to a nearby village and gets Merith, one of his wives, to bring food. The Beast remotely commands Merith's changeling helper, who attempts to seduce Colwyn in order to convince Lyssa that he does not love her, but Colwyn rejects the helper's advances. The helper notes that she could have killed Colwyn but refused to out of love. Seeing this through a vision provided by the Beast, Lyssa notes that this shows love triumphs over power. \n\nYnyr leaves the group to seek out the Widow of the Web, an enchantress who loved Ynyr long ago and was exiled to the lair of the Crystal Spider for murdering their only child. The Widow reveals where the Black Fortress will be at sunrise. She also gives Ynyr the sand from the enchanted hourglass that kept the Crystal Spider from attacking her and will keep the badly injured Ynyr alive on his journey back to the group. As the Crystal Spider attacks the Widow, Ynyr flees the web and returns to the group to reveal the location of the Black Fortress. As he speaks, he loses the last of the sand and dies.\n\nThe group captures and rides magical Fire Mares to reach the Black Fortress before it teleports again. Slayers at the Fortress kill Rhun, while Rell sacrifices himself to hold open the crushing spaceship doors long enough to allow the others to enter. Slayers shoot Menno and Darro, and Kegan sacrifices his life to save Torquil as they journey through the Fortress. When Ergo and Titch get separated from the others and are attacked by Slayers, Ergo magically transforms into a tiger to kill the Slayers and save Titch's life.\n\nColwyn, Torquil, Bardolph, and Oswyn are trapped inside a large dome. Colwyn attempts to open a hole in the dome with the Glaive, while the other three search for any other way out. The three fall through an opening and are trapped between slowly closing walls studded with huge spikes, which kill Bardolph.\n\nColwyn breaches the dome and finds Lyssa. He attacks the Beast, injuring it with the Glaive, which becomes embedded in the Beast's body. With nothing to defend themselves against the Beast's counterattack, Lyssa realizes that they must quickly finish the wedding ritual. This gives them the linked power to manipulate fire, with which Colwyn slays the Beast. His death frees Torquil and Oswyn from the spike room and they rejoin Colwyn and Lyssa, then Ergo and Titch, as they make their way out of the crumbling Fortress, which is pulled off of the planet and into space.\n\nColwyn and Lyssa, now king and queen of the combined kingdom, name Torquil as Lord Marshal. As the surviving heroes depart across a field, the narrator repeats the opening prophecy that the son of the queen and her chosen king shall rule the galaxy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Liam Neeson TIFF 2008.jpg\n| width1 = 170\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Robbiecoltranecrop.jpg\n| width2 = 135\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Krull'' includes early screen performances of [[Liam Neeson]] ''(left)'' and [[Robbie Coltrane]] ''(right)'', both playing bandits in the film.\n}}\n* [[Ken Marshall]] as Colwyn, a prince who fights with a sword and the Glaive.\n* [[Lysette Anthony]] as Princess Lyssa.

While the essence of the plot was never altered during development and production, the first draft of the film was titled ''The Dragons of Krull'', where the Beast was initially planned to be a dragon; however, the creators changed the Beast to a more \"reptilian\" creature for the final film, leading to the final title ''Krull''.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|49}}\n\n[[Steve Tesich]] was brought in to write a \"second version\" of the script.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|49}} Tesich's version of the screenplay was discarded as dialogue-heavy and lacking in special effects, so the first script was used and re-edited instead.<ref name = \"Naha\">{{Cite journal |last=Naha |first=Ed |date=November 1983 |title=Krull: A Visit to a Not-So-Small Planet |url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-076/076#page/n51/mode/2up/search/Krull |issue=76|page=52|journal=[[Starlog]]|publisher=The Brooklyn Company, Inc.|access-date=25 August 2017}}</ref>{{rp|52}} There was one point in the writing process where it was planned that Lyssa would turn into the antagonist near the end of the story, but this was not part of the final screenplay, given that the production team didn't want her to be \"less than pure.\"<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|52}} [[Lysette Anthony]], the actress who played Lyssa, explained that she \"thought that was a little boring\".<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|52}}\n\nAfter the first draft was finished, the writing and production team considered [[Peter Yates]] to direct the film. Two months after they asked him to join the project and after he finished directing ''[[Eyewitness (1981 film)|Eyewitness]]'' (1981), Yates read the screenplay of ''The Dragons in Krull''. He was \"intrigued\" with what he read and accepted the position of directing the film as a \"challenge.\" He reasoned in a 1983 interview that ''Krull'' would be one of those rare films that \"can take full advantage of today's special effects techniques\" and would differ from his more realistic previous works in that he would have to make the movie entirely based on his imagination. The film was in a year of pre-production, which involved Sherman editing the script, Yates creating storyboards, [[Stephen B. Grimes]] and [[Derek Meddings]] coming up with set concepts, and [[Ken Marshall]] and Anthony being cast as Colwyn and Lyssa, respectively.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|49}}\n\nDespite persistent rumours that the film was meant to tie-in with the game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', [[Gary Gygax]] stated, \"To the best of my knowledge and belief the producers of ''Krull'' never approached TSR for a license to enable their film to use the ''D&D'' game IP.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Faraci |first=Devin |url=http://www.badassdigest.com/2011/04/05/the-original-dungeons-dragons-movie-wasnt-dungeons-dragons# |title=The Original DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Movie Wasn't DUNGEONS & DRAGONS |publisher=Badass Digest |date=3 April 2001 |access-date=15 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nYates described making ''Krull'' as \"complicated\" and \"just so enormous\".<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|52}} Special effects artist Brian Johnson stated in a 2009 interview that Yates hated working on the film so much that in the middle of shooting, he took a vacation to the Caribbean, which led to the special effects artists taking a three-week break from the project.<ref>Debord, Jason (23 April 2009).

''Original Prop''. Retrieved 27 August 2017.</ref> The production was initially arranged to be shot at several locations because ''Krull'' was first planned as a medieval-style motion picture.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|49}} However, as it went through multiple drafts, the screenplay transformed into entirely fantasy, which meant most of the film would be shot on [[sound stage|sound stages]], and only a minority of the sequences would be filmed in actual locations in Italy and England for only a few weeks.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|49}} A total of 23 huge sets were built and the film was shot at more than ten sound stages at [[Pinewood Studios]]. ''Krull'' was a very expensive film to produce, with a budget of $30 million.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|48}} Marshall and Meddings reasoned that the huge budget was due to several changes of concepts in the script that led the designers to have to repeatedly alter the designs of the sets.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|49}}\n\n[[File:007 Stage.JPG|thumb|Pinewood's [[007 Stage]] (pictured in 2006), one of the largest [[sound stage]]s in the world, was used for the swamp setting of ''Krull''.]]\nFilming began on 25 January 1983. The first sequence shot was the scene where Ynyr (Freddie Jones) climbs a huge spider web in order to confront the Widow of the Web. Jones did not use any safety wires because the wires would have been visible. Stop-motion animator Steve Archer spent two weeks creating the first model of the spider in the scene, which was later changed.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|52}}\n\nYates's direction of the action scenes that take place at the beginning of ''Krull'' was inspired by [[swashbuckler film|swashbuckler films]] such as ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1935). However, he wanted to figure out new weapons that gave the scenes a unique swashbuckling feel. Marshall practiced his moves for the sequences a week before filming began. However, by the time shooting of these scenes started, the costumes for the Slayers were recently finished, so much of the fight choreography was altered at the last minute based on the limitations of the costumes.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|52}}\n\nPinewood's [[007 Stage]], one of the largest sound stages in the world, was used for the swamp scene, wherein the Slayers and several changelings encounter Colwyn and his group.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|49}} Yates described the swamp set as \"quite nasty ... we always had people bumping into things.\"<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|52}} It was filmed during what Marshall described as a \"very harsh winter,\" and the set was too big to be entirely heated, leading to the actors feeling cold and exhausted.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|52}} The crew members had a hard time seeing through the mist, which led to them accidentally getting into water that consisted of \"cork chips.\"<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|53}}\n\nRehearsing the scene where Colwyn and his group are being chased by the Slayers in the Black Fortress involved stuntmen taking the part of Colwyn so that Marshall could conserve energy for filming. The scene involved Colwyn and his men encountering a corridor where the floor opened underneath them via two set pieces \"the size of a small house\" that were powered by liquid and broke apart before quickly slamming back together.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|53}} Marshall explained that doing the sequence gave him nightmares after it was completed. When shooting of the scene began, Marshall took more time to say his lines than the production crew expected, leading to him not making it from the tunnel in the first take. Only one crew member noticed this and was able to stop the machines controlling the pieces, but Marshall \"knew that if the machine didn't stop in five seconds, [he] would be dead\". Another take of the sequence was shot the next day with Yates instructing that the speed of the machine be slower. However, Marshall insisted on the machine being sped up and, in the final take, was successful in getting away from the set pieces. Marshall explained, \"I had no feeling in my heel for months afterward. It was really hard doing stunts afterwards, too.\"<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|53}}\n\n===Special effects===\nMeddings led the special effects department of ''Krull''.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|53}} British artist [[Christopher Tucker]] was also originally in the project but left due to creative differences.<ref name = \"1001resources\"/> Nick Maley and his crew produced several effects six weeks before filming began.<ref name=\"1001resources\" /> The effects department of went for challenging visual effects and designs that were unusual to achieve in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"1001resources\">{{cite web |last1= Maley |first1= Nick |author-link= Nick Maley |title= An Introduction to the KRULL stories |url=http://1001resources.com/hosting/users/cinesecrets/pmKrull-Intro.html |website= 1001 Resources |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20020331025842/http://1001resources.com/hosting/users/cinesecrets/pmKrull-Intro.html |archive-date= 2002-03-31 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Meddings described how the special effects were made for the movie:\n\n{{blockquote|It was a hard show in terms of effects. Whenever you do an effects picture, you try to come up with something new. Unfortunately, you don't always succeed. You may think you've done something amazing, but, ultimately, it's up to the audience for that verdict. We really worked ourselves silly on this one, though.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|94}}}}\n\nMeddings created miniatures for the setting of the film's titular planet. The model Meddings constructed for Lyssa's castle was twenty feet high. Shots of it were done in Italy using [[forced perspective]] to make it look taller than it really was. The model of the Black Fortress was twelve feet high, and an [[electrical wiring|electrical system]] was used to create the light within it. Because the Black Fortress disintegrates at the end of the film, it was constructed \"like a jigsaw puzzle with parts able to be pulled apart on cue.\"<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|94}}\n\nIn ''Krull'', Ergo uses his magic to transform into creatures such as puppies and geese. Meddings used an effects strategy that showed these transformations differently from traditional [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|cross dissolve]] methods, reasoning that it had \"been done to death\".<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|94}} He explained:\n\n{{blockquote|We did it with a series of blow-ups embellished with artwork so that you could actually blend in the actor. The actor [David Battley] dropped down to his knees and we used a series of blow-ups to reduce him to puppy size. Then, halfway through the transition, we introduced blowups of the puppy, blending the two sets together with artwork. Then, as the last still went on screen, we substituted the real dog who just wagged his tail and walked away. It was a trick, but it looks quite magical.<ref name = \"Naha\"/>{{rp|94}}}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[File:James-horner-07.jpg|thumb|[[James Horner]] scored ''Krull''.]]\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[James Horner]] and performed by [[The London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Ambrosian Singers]]. It has been commended as part of the composer's best early efforts.<ref name=\"filmtracks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/krull.html |title=Krull (James Horner) |publisher=Filmtracks |access-date=30 June 2013}}</ref> The soundtrack is considered a high point of the film.<ref name = \"Allmovie\"/><ref name = \"DanofGeek\"/><ref name = \"HouseNextDoor\"/> Ryan Lambie, reviewing for ''[[Den of Geek]]'' wrote, \"The 70s and 80s seemed to be the era of great sci-fi and fantasy themes, and Horner's is high up on the list of the best, providing the film a grandiose sweep to match the broad vistas of ''Krull''{{'}}s location photography.\"<ref name = \"DanofGeek\"/>\n\nThe score features traditional [[swashbuckling]] fanfares, an overtly rapturous love theme, and other musical elements that were characteristic of fantasy and adventure films of the 1980s, along with incorporating avant-garde techniques with string instruments to represent some of the monstrous creatures. Additionally, to accompany the main antagonists, the Beast and its army of Slayers, Horner utilised [[The Planets|Holst-like rhythms]] and groaning and moaning vocals from the choir. Also of note is a recurring \"siren call\" performed by female voices that starts and bookends the score, and appears numerous times in the story to represent the legacy of the ancient world of Krull.<ref>{{cite book | type=Liner notes | first=Jeff | last=Bond | title=Slaying the Beast: The Music of Krull | date=2010 | publisher=La-La Land Records}}</ref>\n\nHorner's score is reminiscent of earlier works, particularly ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' and ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. Some pieces of the music would later be reused in [[Aliens (film)|''Aliens'']] and [[The Rocketeer (film)|''The Rocketeer'']]. Other segments would also be used for the ambiance of the [[Disneyland Paris]] attraction [[Space Mountain: Mission 2]].<ref>Included in press kit, but may not have been used in the attraction. {{cite web |url=http://www.themeparkaudioarchives.com/members/disneyland_paris_disneyland_Discoveryland.html |title=Disneyland Paris Discoveryland |publisher=Theme Park Audio Archives |date=2009 |access-date=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219064409/http://www.themeparkaudioarchives.com/members/disneyland_paris_disneyland_Discoveryland.html |archive-date=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe score has been released numerous times on album by various labels.
