Starring [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]], [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]], [[Miou-Miou]] and [[Alain Chabat]], the film stems from a bedtime story written by Sam Mounier,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Unsung Films|url=http://www.unsungfilms.com/5406/the-science-of-sleep/|website=Unsung Films Blog|accessdate=26 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=To Tony Productions |url=http://totonyproductions.blogspot.com/2012/07/stress-coming.html|publisher=Daniel Hess |accessdate=26 July 2007}}</ref> then 10 years old.\n\n==Plot==\nSt\u00e9phane Miroux (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal), is a shy young man whose vivid [[dreams]] often interfere with his waking life. After the death of his divorced father in [[Mexico]], St\u00e9phane moves to Paris to live closer to his mother Christine. He moves into his childhood home and starts a new job his mother has found for him in a [[calendar]] printing company. St\u00e9phane shows his new colleagues his drawings, a collection of twelve illustrations depicting unique disasters, he calls his collection \"disasterology\". But nobody at his new job appreciates his talents, the job is for nothing more than typesetting work, leaving St\u00e9phane frustrated, as revealed in his dreams.\n\nWhile leaving his apartment to go to work one day the new neighbour St\u00e9phanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg) invites St\u00e9phane into her apartment, St\u00e9phane soon realizes that St\u00e9phanie is creative and artistic. They plan to do a project together, a short animated film based around a boat St\u00e9phanie was making.\n\nAs the story begins to unfold, surrealistic and naturalistic elements begin to overlap within St\u00e9phane's reality, and the viewer is often uncertain of which portions constitute reality and which are dreams. One dream sequence in which St\u00e9phane dreams his hands become absurdly giant, was inspired by a recurring nightmare director Michel Gondry had as a child.[5] As the line between dream and reality gradually becomes more blurred, St\u00e9phane becomes enamoured with St\u00e9phanie, and he shares his inventions with her, such as the \u2018one-second time machine\u2019. St\u00e9phane's dreams begin to encroach on his waking life, making him unsure of reality and whether St\u00e9phanie's feelings for him are real.\n\nSt\u00e9phanie's toy horse is named Golden The Pony Boy, a reference to \u2018The Outsiders\u2019, the meaning poignantly hinting at St\u00e8phane's regression and childlike behaviour around St\u00e9phanie, which could stem from the loss of his father. St\u00e8phane implants a mechanism inside Golden the Pony Boy that will make it gallop, he later receives a call from St\u00e9phanie thanking him, she reveals the pony was named after St\u00e9phane.\n\nTo St\u00e9phane's surprise, the calendar manufacturer accepts his \"Disasterology\" idea and the company has a party in his honor, but he begins drinking excessively after he witnesses St\u00e9phanie dancing with another man. The next day, St\u00e9phane and St\u00e9phanie have a confrontation in their hallway when St\u00e9phane announces that he doesn't want to be St\u00e9phanie's friend any longer.\nSt\u00e9phanie offers that they discuss their issues on a date, but on his way there St\u00e9phane has a vision that she isn't there, he runs to her apartment and bangs on her door when in actuality, she is waiting for him at the caf\u00e9. St\u00e9phanie returns home, while St\u00e9phane decides to move back to Mexico.\nBefore leaving, St\u00e9phane's mother insists that he says a formal goodbye to his next-door neighbor, St\u00e9phanie. In his attempt to do so, he becomes crass, making offensive jokes. As his antagonistic behaviour pushes her, St\u00e9phanie asks St\u00e9phane to leave but he climbs into her bed, noticing two items on her bedside: his one-second time machine, and the finished boat they planned to use in their animated film. The film closes with St\u00e9phane and St\u00e9phanie riding Golden the Pony Boy across a field before sailing off into the sea in her boat.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exploringyourmind.com/the-science-of-sleep-the-film/|title=The Science of Sleep - the Film|date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as St\u00e9phane Miroux, a shy and creative young man who moves to Paris to accompany his mother.

Scott]], an American [[journalist]] and cultural critic, describes the film as \"profoundly idiosyncratic\" and \"so confident in its oddity\" that any attempt to describe and explain the film would be misleading. He later states, \"What I'm trying to say is that \"The Science of Sleep,\" for all its blithe disregard of the laws of physics, film grammar and narrative coherence, strikes me as perfectly realistic, as authentic a slice of life as I've encountered on screen in quite some time.\" Scott argues that the film's loose connection of events and misleading narrative are appropriate for its themes: \"Plot summary, therefore, is both irrelevant and impossible. Which is not to say that the movie lacks a story, only that, like a dream, the narrative moves sideways as well as forward, revising and contradicting itself as it goes along. Mr. Gondry, who would rather invent than explain, makes a plausible case that a love story (which is what \"The Science of Sleep\" is) cannot really be told any other way. Love is too bound up with memories, fantasies, projections and misperceptions to conform to a conventional, linear structure.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/22/movies/22slee.html|title = A Parisian Love Story in Forward, and Sideways, Motion|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 22 September 2006|last1 = Scott|first1 = A. o.}}</ref>\n\nMany other critics have stated that the film's plot is hard to understand, but Michel Gondry's grasp of emotions and visuals is what makes the story unique and profound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/science-sleep-review/|title = The Science of Sleep}}</ref>\n\n'''Awards'''\n* 2008 [[BBC Four World Cinema Awards]] (Nominated), BBC Four World Cinema Award\n* 2008 [[Gopo Awards]], Romania.

The name was given by a Swiss [[psychiatrist]], Carl Jung, who wanted to distinguish his studies from Freud's psychoanalytic theories.\n\nThe use of psychological archetypes was advanced by Jung in 1919. In Jung's psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a complex, e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype. Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological givens that arose through evolution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologistworld.com/cognitive/carl-jung-analytical-psychology|title=How Carl Jung's Archetypes and Collective Consciousness Affect Our Psyche|date=22 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-jung.html|title = Carl Jung &#124; Simply Psychology}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dream]]\n* [[Lucid dreaming]]\n* [[Dream argument]]\n* [[False awakening]]\n* [[Hallucinations in the sane]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{official website|1=http://wip.warnerbros.com/index.html?id=scienceofsleep}}\n* {{IMDb title|0354899|La Science des r\u00eaves}}\n* {{allrovi movie|342289|The Science of Sleep}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|the_science_of_sleep|The Science of Sleep}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=The Science of Sleep}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100106185038/http://www.apple.com/trailers/warner_independent_pictures/thescienceofsleep/ Official trailer]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061005071910/http://community.livejournal.com/scienceofsleep/ Official LiveJournal Community]\n\n{{Michel Gondry}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Science of Sleep, The}}\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2000s fantasy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:French fantasy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Italian fantasy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michel Gondry]]\n[[Category:2000s romantic fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Science fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Films using stop-motion animation]]\n[[Category:Warner Independent Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Partizan films]]\n[[Category:France 3 Cin\u00e9ma films]]\n[[Category:Canal+ films]]\n[[Category:Films about dreams]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:French romantic fantasy films]]\n[[Category:2006 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2006 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Val-d'Oise]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
