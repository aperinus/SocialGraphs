It is based on the serial novel of the same title by Kaizan Nakazato.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story follows the life of Ryunosuke Tsukue ([[Tatsuya Nakadai]]), an amoral samurai and a master swordsman with an unorthodox [[Gedan-no-kamae|style]]. Ryunosuke is first seen when he kills an elderly Buddhist pilgrim who he finds praying for death. He appears to have no feeling. Later, he kills an opponent in self-defense in a fencing competition that was intended to be non-lethal, but became a duel after he raped his opponents wife in exchange for throwing the match and allowing her husband to win. His opponent finds out about the rape prior to the match, and is shown giving his wife a notice of divorce. His rage at Ryunosuke during the match causes him to take an illegal lunging attack after the judge proclaims a draw, and Ryunosuke, the better swordsman, parries and kills him with one stroke of his [[bokken]]. Ryunosuke flees town after killing the man, and cuts down many of the dead opponent's clansmen who attack him as he is leaving. His opponent's ex-wife asks to go along with him.\n\nTwo years pass, and in order to make a living, Ryunosuke joins the [[Shinsengumi]], a sort of semi-official police force made up of [[r\u014dnin]] that supports the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] through murder and assassinations. Through all his interactions, whether killing a man or at home with his mistress and their baby son, Ryunosuke rarely shows any emotion. His expression is fixed in a glassy stare that suggests a quiet insanity.\n\nEventually Ryunosuke learns that the younger brother of the man he killed in the fencing match is looking for him, intent on revenge. He plans to meet this young man and kill him, but before the duel can take place, two events occur that shake his confidence. In a botched assassination attempt, he sees another master swordsman, Shimada Toranosuke ([[Toshiro Mifune]]), in action, and for the first time he doubts that his own skill is truly unbeatable. That same night, Ryunosuke's mistress, horrified by his unremitting evil, tries to kill him in his sleep. He kills her in the gardens, to the ominous cries of their sleeping child inside the house, and flees without keeping his appointment to duel with his pursuer. Later he rejoins the gang of assassins at an [[oiran]] house (courtesan brothel) in the [[Shimabara, Kyoto|Shimabara]] district of [[Kyoto]]. There, in a quiet (and he is told, haunted) room, he starts seeing the ghosts of all the people he has killed. Further, he is haunted by the words of Shimada: \"The sword is the soul. Study the soul to know the sword. Evil mind, evil sword.\"  The final blow comes when he realizes that the apprentice oiran sent to entertain him is the granddaughter of the pilgrim he murdered at the film's beginning.\n\nWith this realization, Ryunosuke appears to descend into complete insanity. He starts slashing at the shadows of the ghosts that surround him, and then begins attacking his fellow assassins, who seem to number in the hundreds. Ryunosuke kills dozens of gang members in the burning courtesan house as they gradually wear him down with what few wounds they can inflict. Finally it appears that Ryunosuke will surely be killed; bleeding, his face contorted in rage, he lurches forward, raises his sword one last time, and the film ends with a freeze-frame catching Ryunosuke in mid sword-slash.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Actor\n!Role\n|-\n|[[Tatsuya Nakadai]]\n|Ryunosuke Tsukue{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama]]\n|Hyoma Utsuki{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Michiyo Aratama]]\n|Ohama{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Toshiro Mifune]]\n|Toranosuke Shimada{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|Yoko Naito\n|Omatsu{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Kei Sat\u014d]]\n|[[Serizawa Kamo|Kamo Serizawa]]{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|Tadao Nakamaru\n|[[Kond\u014d Isami|Isami Kondo]]{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|Akio Miyabe\n|[[Hijikata Toshiz\u014d|Toshiz\u014d Hijikata]]\n|-\n|Ichiro Nakaya\n|Bunnojo Utsuki{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[K\u014d Nishimura]]\n|Shichibei, Omatsu's \"uncle\"{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Hideyo Amamoto]]\n|Lord Shuzen Kamio{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Kamatari Fujiwara]]\n|Omatsu's grandfather\n|-\n|Yasuzo Ogawa\n|Yohachi{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Ryosuke Kagawa]]\n|Dansho Tsukue{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|Atsuko Kawaguchi\n|Okinu{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Kunie Tanaka]]\n|Senkichi{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|Takamaru Sasaki\n|Ishinsai Nakamura{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|Akio Miyabe\n|Toshizo Ogata{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|-\n|[[Kinnosuke Takamatsu]]\n|old pilgrim{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n|}\n\n==Production==\n''The Sword of Doom'' was an adaptation of ''Daibosatsu toge'' ({{literal translation|Great Bodhisattva Pass}}), a novel that has remained popular since its initial release, a year after the death of the [[Emperor Meiji]], the ruler who oversaw Japan's transition from hermetically sealed feudal state to modern nation.<ref name=\"cc-essay\">{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/358-the-sword-of-doom-calligraphy-in-blood|website=[[The Criterion Collection]]|title=The Sword of Doom: Calligraphy in Blood|access-date=March 16, 2018|last=O\u2019Brien|first=Geoffrey}}</ref> The novel originated from a newspaper serial, which appeared for three more decades; forty-one volumes were published before it was left uncompleted at the death of its author, Kaizan Nakazato.<ref name=\"cc-essay\" /> The film had previously been adapted in two part film by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] in 1935.<ref name=\"cc-essay\" />  After the war, it was remade again, in three parts by [[Kunio Watanabe]] in 1953 and in three parts by [[Tomu Uchida]] between 1957 and 1959, and in three parts by [[Kenji Misumi]] and [[Kazuo Mori]] in 1960 and 1961.<ref name=\"cc-essay\" />\n\n''The Sword of Doom'' was an adaptation imposed on [[Kihachi Okamoto]] by [[Toho]] after the studio was dissatisfied with his film ''[[The Age of Assassins]]'', a film completed in 1966 but only released in 1967.<ref name=\"cc-essay\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Sword of Doom'' was distributed by [[Toho]] and was released on February 25, 1966.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}} The film was released with English subtitles in the United States by Toho International on February 25, 1966.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n\nA proposed sequel was never produced.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=227}}\n\n==Reception==\nIn a contemporary review, \"Robe\" of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found the film to have an \"overlong unfolding story\" that \"rarely stops for a rest\" and ultimately declared the film a \"programmer\".<ref name=\"variety-book\">{{cite book|title=Variety's Film Reviews 1964-1967|volume=11|publisher=R.
