It centers on the life and career of the 18th-century Italian opera singer Carlo Broschi, known as [[Farinelli]], considered the greatest [[castrato]] singer of all time; as well as his relationship with his brother, the composer [[Riccardo Broschi]].<ref name=\"Goldsmith\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe prologue begins with Carlo Broschi, the famous castrato Farinelli, reminiscing about his childhood as a singer in the church choir. A newly castrated boy runs in and warns Carlo that his voice will result in death, then ends himself. Carlo is traumatized and refuses to sing a composition by his older brother Riccardo for his voice teacher, [[Nicola Porpora]]. He cries and runs to his father, who comforts him, but extracts a promise that he will never refuse his voice to his brother again. The film proper opens in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], at the palace of [[Philip V of Spain|King Philip V]]. Riccardo Broschi (Enrico Lo Verso) demands to see his brother Carlo (Stefano Dionisi), now known by his nickname, Farinelli. Carlo refuses him.<ref name=\"Goldsmith\"/>\n\nThe rest of the film is told in flashback. Eighteen years earlier, Carlo and Riccardo watched an itinerant trumpet player humiliate a young [[castrato]]. Angered, Carlo humiliates the trumpeter, to the delight of the crowd. Riccardo seduces a pretty lady in the crowd, using his brother as bait: Carlo begins to make love to her, then Riccardo steps in to complete the act. Meanwhile, [[George Frideric H\u00e4ndel]] ([[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]) has heard Farinelli sing from his carriage. He asks Carlo to come to Great Britain and perform, but Riccardo demands to be included. Handel sneers at Riccardo as a hack, humiliates Carlo as a freak, and leaves.<ref name=\"Goldsmith\"/>\n\nSeveral years pass, and Carlo is now famous. He impresses the Comtesse Mauer (Marianne Basler), a beautiful and rich young woman more interested in books than opera. The brothers maintain their sexual accommodation: Carlo seduces the comtesse\u00b4s maid and Riccardo consummates the sex act. Carlo receives a letter from Handel, who wants to hear Carlo sing in [[Dresden]]. Carlo suddenly falls ill with a fever during which Riccardo repeats a story he has told Carlo since he was a child: Carlo had been injured in a fall from a horse, and the castration surgery was necessary to save his life. In Dresden, Handel meets Carlo just before the curtain rises and tells him the King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] wants him to sing. Unnerved by Handel's offer, Carlo faints on stage. A self-satisfied Handel departs; Carlo waits for him in vain.<ref name=\"Goldsmith\"/>\n\nCarlo is soon invited to [[London]] by the young Alexandra Lerris (Elsa Zylberstein). Handel's [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] opera house is bankrupting the nearby [[Opera of the Nobility]], sponsored by the [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and run by Carlo's old vocal teacher Porpora (Omero Antonutti). In London, Carlo and Riccardo meet Margareth Hunter (Caroline Cellier) and her crippled son Benedict (Renaud du Peloux de Saint Romain). Carlo proposes to her, but she refuses out of respect for her late husband. Carlo begins to realize that Riccardo's highly ornamented compositions lack true artistry; he covets Handel's operas and tries to impress him. Alexandra, who is in love with Carlo, steals some of Handel's music for Carlo to perform. The relationship between the two brothers deteriorates. Searching Riccardo's house for the stolen music, Handel confronts him and sabotages the relationship. Beguiled by Handel, Riccardo reveals (in a flashback-within-a-flashback) that Carlo was a superb singer as a child, and when their father died, the fear of losing that voice prompted him to drug Carlo and castrate him illegally, then promise to compose for him a great opera: \"Orpheus.\"<ref name=\"Goldsmith\"/><ref name=\"Mitchell\"/>{{rp|87}}\n\nThat evening, Handel meets with Farinelli backstage. He tells Farinelli the secret of his castration and allows him to sing the stolen music. Shocked and heartbroken, Carlo sings Handel's music (the aria ''[[Lascia ch'io pianga]]''<ref>Haynes, Bruce, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MCJArhvspfEC&pg=PA25&dq=farinelli+lascia+ch%27io+pianga ''The End of Early Music''], Oxford University Press US, 2007, p. 25. {{ISBN|0-19-518987-6}}</ref>) so beautifully that Handel faints.\n\nThe flashback ends. We learn that Carlo and Alexandra fled from Riccardo to the royal court of Spain, and has not sung in public since his triumph at the Opera of the Nobility three years earlier. Carlo has never forgiven Riccardo, but Alexandra, who understands the bond between the brothers, tries to reconcile them: she steals Riccardo's \"Orpheus.\" Carlo sees that Riccardo has finally written the promised masterpiece, but still can't forgive. Carlo sings for King Philip during a [[solar eclipse]]. As Riccardo listens to Carlo sing, he is overwhelmed by guilt and the broken relationship, and attempts suicide by slashing his wrist. After falling unconscious from [[blood loss]], he is brought to the house Carlo and Alexandra share, where he recovers. Carlo, realizing the atonement of his brother's actions, forgives Riccardo for [[castrating]] him. Together, the brothers [[Sexual intercourse|make love]] to Alexandra. Some months pass. Alexandra is now [[pregnant]] with Riccardo's child, whom Carlo and Alexandra treat as their own. The film ends as Riccardo leaves Madrid to seek his fortune as a composer, taking comfort in the fact that in leaving Carlo with a child to father, he has given his brother back his \"share of humanity.\"<ref name=\"Goldsmith\"/>\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
