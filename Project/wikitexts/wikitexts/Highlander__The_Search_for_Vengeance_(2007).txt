The film was directed by [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]] (''[[Ninja Scroll]]'', ''[[Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust]]'') and was written by David Abramowitz, also the writer for ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', ''[[Highlander: The Raven]]'' and ''[[Highlander: The Source]]''. The film was a [[joint venture]] between [[Imagi Animation Studios]] and [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse Studio]], with Imagi providing the script and the soundtrack, while Madhouse produced the animation. It was produced in association with Davis-Panzer Productions and distributed by [[Manga Entertainment]] on June 5, 2007 and aired on July 30 on [[Syfy|Sci Fi]]'s [[Ani-Monday]] block. The film is dedicated to the memory of [[William N. Panzer]], who died in 2007, and was the co-owner of the Davis-Panzer Inc., which was the company who created the franchise.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story centers on characters who are [[immortality|immortal]].\n\nThe lead character, Colin MacLeod, became an ''Immortal'' after his first death in 125 AD in [[Roman Britain]], when his village in England was attacked by the conquering Romans.  Another ''Immortal'', Marcus Octavius, was leading the [[Roman Empire]]'s military forces in hopes of creating his dream of a [[utopian]] society.  Octavius killed Colin's wife Moya, but was not able to kill Colin, whose unconscious body was dragged by a horse to within [[Stonehenge]], a \"holy ground\" in the story, where Immortals are forbidden to fight.\n\nWaking days later within Stonehenge, Colin is left confused about who and what he is, and why he is still alive. It is at this moment that the spirit of a former [[druid]] of this holy site, ''Amergan'', begins communicating with MacLeod and explains to him what he is.  Colin learns of ''The Game'' from Amergan, and the druid becomes his lifelong teacher and conscience.\n\nThe movie interlaces flashback scenes of this and Colin's following plight for vengeance throughout time, as Octavius attempts to re-enact his utopian society through force and fear.  Throughout the next two millennia, Octavius serves as a high-ranking member of various powerful empires, ranging from the [[Mongol Empire]] to [[Nazi Germany]].  Marcus wants to encourage the development of a utopian world-empire, but the side he chooses tend to be ruthless and authoritarian (e.g. Nazi Germany).  For two thousand years, Colin clashes with Marcus multiple times throughout history, always fighting on the opposing side trying to bring down whichever authoritarian regime Marcus is supporting.  While Colin is often badly beaten, neither one ever succeeds in killing the other. Though Colin is ostensibly in the role of the \"barbarian\" and Marcus is the bringer of \"civilization\", Marcus cares more about building an empire and less about people's well-being, with an \"ends-justify-the-means\" mentality.\n\nIn the year 2187, Colin finds Octavius in a post-apocalyptic future of [[New York City]]. Octavius has stopped supporting other regimes, and is setting up a new empire with himself as its tyrannical leader.  When Colin arrives, Marcus is busy making plans to [[Biological warfare|release a deadly virus]] which will further his goals of conquest.  Colin falls in with the disaffected rebels in the city.  After a final duel, Colin defeats Octavius, and his [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]] destroys the virus in question.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Marcus, Colin leaves New York for an unknown destination with a new sense of belief and purpose other than revenge for the first time in his life.\n\n==Cast==\n{|border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-style=\"background-color: rgb(255,85,0);\"\n!Character\n!Japanese\n!English\n|-\n| Colin MacLeod\n| [[Shun Oguri]]\n| [[Alistair Abell]]\n|-\n| Marcus Octavius\n| [[Koichi Yamadera]]\n| [[Nolan North]]\n|-\n| Amergan\n| [[Kosei Tomita]]\n| [[Scott McNeil]]\n|-\n| Dahlia\n| [[Romi Park]]\n| [[Debi Mae West|Eid Lakis]]\n|-\n| Kyala\n| [[Megumi Hayashibara]]\n| [[Janyse Jaud]]\n|-\n| Doc\n| [[Unsho Ishizuka]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Jim Byrnes (actor)|Jim Byrnes]]\n|-\n| Rudy\n| [[Yusaku Yara]]\n|-\n| Moya\n| Yurika Hino\n| [[Kathleen Barr]]\n|-\n| Gregor\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Takaya Hashi\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Scott McNeil]]\n|-\n| Lab Director\n|-\n| Joe\n| [[Minami Takayama]]\n| [[Ogie Banks|Hank Banks]]\n|}\n\n==MacLeod heritage==\nIn the story, Colin was born in [[Roman Britain]], but his true surname, which is never given, was not MacLeod at birth.  One of the flashback scenes shows him achieving this honor after he fought alongside [[Clan MacLeod]] in an unknown battle, presumably because Octavius was fighting for the opposition.  The Clansmen honor Colin, and name him a MacLeod for giving his life for their cause.  Once he regains life, as all ''Immortals'' do, Colin adopts the name, and keeps it for the rest of his life, as it was with the MacLeods that Colin learned the values that would one day assist him in overcoming his unyielding lust for vengeance.\n\n==Director's cut==\nProducer H. Galen Walker said in an interview: \"There's about seven or eight additional scenes in the Japanese version that we cut out in the U.S.\u2014one, just for timing, and just for pace of story. That was the big issue. I'm sure Mr. Kawajiri was really unhappy about the cut, but this was what the other producers thought was best for everybody.\" An opening exposition text-sequence, which is traditional for ''Highlander'' films, was also added for the American version. Walker said that Kawajiri's original cut \"will probably be out later this year,\" in an interview conducted in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/32882 | title=AICN Anime-Interview of Highlander: Search for Vengeance Producer Galen Walker | author=Scott Green | date=2007-06-05 | publisher=Aintitcool.com | access-date=2007-06-06}}</ref> More than a year later, the director's cut was finally released in Japan on December 5, 2008 with the running time of 95 minutes (10 minutes longer than the U.S. version).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=GNBA-7563 | title=Highlander: The Search For Vengeance Director's Cut Edition (Limited Release) | date=2008-12-05 | publisher=cdjapan.co.jp | access-date=2008-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reaction to ''Highlander: The Search for Vengeance'' has been generally favorable, and more favorable in general than the live-action ''Highlander'' sequels. Chris Wyatt of [[IGN]] awarded the film a score of 9 out of 10, saying: \"''Highlander: The Search for Vengeance'' is the best thing to happen to ''Highlander'' fans since the original film. [It's] violent, dramatic, sexy, and actually smart. ...

Kawajiri's movie is crammed full of breathtaking compositions and sophisticated effects, [and] the character depictions are also impressive. ...

''Highlander: The Search for Vengeance'' covers much the same territory as the [[Highlander (film)|1986 original]], but it does so unapologetically, and with a genuine passion, too. ...
