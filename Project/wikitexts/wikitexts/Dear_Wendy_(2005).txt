When he learns from a co-worker that it is not a replica, but a functioning antique gun, the two form a friendship based around recreational [[Shooting sports|target shooting]] and studying firearms history. Other disaffected teens join them, and they begin to call themselves \"the Dandies\". Dick becomes more and more attached to his gun, naming it \"Wendy\" and writing it love letters. The Dandies adopt an affected, anachronistic style of dressing and speaking, for example replacing the word \"killing\" with \"loving\". They treat their antique firearms as elaborate props, giving them names and [[Backstory|backstories]], playing games with them, and target shooting in an abandoned mining shaft that they decorate and call the Temple. They carry their guns at all times, but make a point of never showing off their guns in public.\n\nDick's childhood nanny Clarabelle introduces him to her troubled grandson Sebastian, an African-American youth from out of town who is on probation for a weapons-related crime. The town's sheriff, Sheriff Krugby, appoints Dick as an informal probation officer for Sebastian, believing that Dick is a good role model. Dick allows Sebastian to break probation and asks him to join the Dandies, but only if he follows their idiosyncratic rules. One day, Sebastian gives the group a suspicious box full of guns, and soon breaks a club rule by firing another member's gun. The group's sole female member, Susan, becomes interested in Sebastian. Dick becomes upset by the changes Sebastian's presence has triggered.\n\nSebastian tells Dick that his grandmother is too scared of \"gang violence\" to walk down the street to her cousin's home, and Dick proposes that the Dandies escort her there. Clarabelle panics when they encounter a deputy sheriff and ends up shooting him after a scuffle. The sheriff asks the Dandies to hand over Clarabelle, telling them they can keep their guns if they do so. The Dandies believe that they are being set up, and flee to the Temple with Clarabelle just as several other police officers arrive. Despite the fact that they are now wanted by police, the Dandies decide to finish taking Clarabelle to her cousin's, treating it as a suicide mission. Sebastian discovers Dick's final letter to Wendy, which ends with the coded threat: \"And now, it's the time of the season for loving.\"{{Efn|A reference to the song \"[[Time of the Season]]\" by 1960s British rock band [[The Zombies]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Provocative 'Dear Wendy' is a loaded missive from Von Trier - The Boston Globe|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2005/09/23/provocative_dear_wendy_is_a_loaded_missive_from_von_trier/|access-date=2021-05-10|website=archive.boston.com|language=en}}</ref>}} Armed, they head outside to face the team of [[shotgun]]-toting police officers.\n\nA gunfight ensues, during which most of the Dandies are killed or wounded, and Clarabelle is hit in the leg by a ricocheting bullet. Although he is also wounded, Dick manages to get Clarabelle to her cousin's house, but loses his gun Wendy in the confusion. Police officers surround the home. Sebastian, unhurt, remains hidden outside. Noticing Wendy on the street, he picks it up and runs into Clarabelle's cousin's home, where he shoots Dick with Wendy. The police on the roof across the street open fire on the building.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Dick Dandelion\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Sheriff Krugby\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Freddie\n* Danso Gordon as Sebastian\n* [[Novella Nelson]] as Clarabelle\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Susan\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Huey\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Stevie\n* [[Trevor Cooper]] as Dick's Dad\n* [[William Hootkins]] as Marshall Walker\n* [[Thomas Bo Larsen]] as Hal\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on a custom-built studio lot in [[Copenhagen]], but represents a small mining town in [[West Virginia]], USA.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Scott|first=A.
