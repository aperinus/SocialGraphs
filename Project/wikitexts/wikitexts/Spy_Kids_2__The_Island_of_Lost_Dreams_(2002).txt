It stars [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Carla Gugino]], [[Alexa PenaVega|Alexa Vega]], [[Daryl Sabara]], [[Mike Judge]], [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], [[Holland Taylor]], [[Christopher McDonald]], and [[Steve Buscemi]].\n\nThe second installment in the ''[[Spy Kids]]'' film series, which began with 2001's ''[[Spy Kids (film)|Spy Kids]]'', the film premiered at the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood on July 28, 2002. [[Dimension Films]] theatrically released the film on August 7, 2002.<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web|title=Spy Kids 2 (2002)|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/62577|website=American Film Institute|publisher=American Film Institute|access-date=1 December 2016|ref=15}}</ref> Upon release, ''Spy Kids 2'' received mostly positive reviews from critics<ref name=\"RT\"/> and grossed over $119&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n== Plot ==\nThe OSS now has a full child spy section, of which [[Carmen Cortez]] and [[Juni Cortez]] are now Level 2 agents. Although they were the first of the new Spy Kids Division, they face fierce competition from Gary and Gerti Giggles, the children of Donnagon Giggles (the agent whom Carmen and Juni rescued [[Spy Kids (film)|on their first mission]]). Carmen defends Gary, as she has a crush on him, straining her relationship with Juni.\n\nAt the OSS awards banquet, Donnagon hacks into the [[President of the United States|president]]'s TelePrompTer, and is named director of the OSS instead of Gregorio Cortez. In his acceptance speech, Donnagon announces his two children are being promoted from Level 3 to Level 1. A fight ensues when a group of Magna Men arrive, rendering all adults unconscious. They are seeking the \"Transmooker\", a highly coveted device which can shut off all electronic devices around the world. Juni recovers it, but drops it when Gary tries to grab it. Gary blames Juni for the loss, resulting in him being fired.\n\nThe next morning Carmen hacks into the database, reinstating Juni as an agent. They take a mission meant for Gary and Gerti to recover the Transmooker. Using some hints from their former arch-nemesis, Alexander Minion, they follow the trail to a mysterious island where no electronics work. Meanwhile, Gary and Gerti are rerouted to the Gobi Desert and while trying to pinpoint their position fall into a pit of [[camel]] feces, whereupon they swear revenge.\n\nShortly after arriving at the island, Carmen and Juni meet Romero, a scientist and sole human inhabitant of the island who has been attempting to create genetically miniaturized animals to sell to kids as \"miniature zoos.\" After creating hybrid animals, Romero accidentally poured a growth concoction over them, greatly increasing their size. He fears being eaten, so is unwilling to leave his lab.\n\nCarmen is captured by a Spork, a flying pig, and dropped into its nest with Gerti, who tells her that Gary is genuinely evil. Her feelings for Gary change after he tries to kill Juni, and she protects him. Romero, encouraged by Juni, leaves his lab and discovers his creatures are much friendlier than he thought. Carmen and Juni eventually find and recover the Transmooker, and are surprised when their family joins them. Donnagon then confronts the group, takes the Transmooker and, after a fight with Gregorio tries to destroy the Cortez family with it, but it malfunctions. Gerti reveals she sabotaged it and threatens Donnagon with telling everything to her mother.\n\nThe President and his staff arrive on the island. He and his daughter Alexandra fire Donnagon; Gary is temporarily disavowed, and Alexandra appoints Gregorio as director of the OSS on her father's behalf. Even though offered a promotion to Level 1, Juni resigns due to the impersonal treatment he had received by the OSS after being framed. As the Cortez family leaves the island, Romero gives Juni a miniature spider-monkey as a gift, and the island's inhabitants bid farewell to the Cortez family.\n\nDuring the credits, [[Machete (character)|Machete]] hosts a concert featuring Carmen (with a microphone which helps her sing, and a belt that helps her dance), and Juni (with a guitar that plays itself), but realizes too late that he never put any batteries in the devices before they went onstage. When he breaks this news to Carmen and Juni, this shocks them, realizing they have musical talent. Meanwhile, Dinky Winks, the owner of Troublemakers theme park, paddles to Romero's island to offer a business deal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Gregorio Cortez, the father of Juni and Carmen who is now called back to the OSS\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Ingrid Cortez, the mother of Juni and Carmen\n* [[Alexa PenaVega|Alexa Vega]] as [[Carmen Cortez]], daughter of Gregorio and Ingrid who is now an OSS member of their spy kid division\n* [[Daryl Sabara]] as [[Juni Cortez]], son of Gregorio and Ingrid and Carmen's brother\n* [[Mike Judge]] as Donnagon Giggles, an OSS agent turned director who was previously rescued by Carmen and Juni, but is now seeking world domination \n* [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] as Grandfather Valentin Avellan\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Grandmother Helga Avellan\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as [[Machete (character)|Isador \"Machete\" Cortez]], gadget inventor and Juni and Carmen's uncle\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Fegan Floop, host of Floop's Fooglies\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Alexander Minion, Floop's assistant\n* [[Matt O'Leary]] as Gary Giggles, the son of Donnagon Giggles and a rival OSS agent of Juni and Carmen's love interest\n* [[Taylor Momsen]] as Alexandra, the President's daughter\n* [[Emily Osment]] as Gerti Giggles, daughter of Donnagon Giggles and a rival OSS agent of Carmen\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Felix Gumm, an OSS agent\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Romero\n\nAdditionally, [[Bill Paxton]] appears as Dinky Winks, a theme park owner.\n\n== Production ==\n''Spy Kids 2'' was filmed entirely on High Definition digital video.
