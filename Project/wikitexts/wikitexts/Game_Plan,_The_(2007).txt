The film stars [[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]] in the lead role, [[Madison Pettis]] and [[Kyra Sedgwick]]. It follows a professional [[quarterback]] who finds out he has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nIt was the last film to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], after [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] retired the [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista]] moniker across their company's divisions in the same year. It is also the final film where Johnson is credited with his ring name. ''The Game Plan'' was released in the United States on September 28, 2007 and grossed $146 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the last game of the American Football Federation regular season between the Boston Rebels and the New York Dukes, Rebels [[quarterback]] Joe Kingman scores a touchdown after ignoring an open wide receiver, Travis Sanders. The next morning, an eight-year-old girl named Peyton Kelly arrives on Joe's doorstep saying that she is his biological daughter, and that his divorced wife, Sara, sent her there to meet him. His agent, Stella Peck thinks this will be bad for his image and distracts him with the upcoming playoffs.\n\nAt the opening of his own restaurant/nightclub and bar, Joe inadvertently leaves without Peyton and is on the cover of a tabloid the next day. Stella decides Joe needs a new fatherly image. At a later press conference, the reporters make Joe miserable, until Peyton comes to his defense, saying that he is new to this and trying the best he can and that she thinks he is the best father in the world. Peyton then says that Joe has to repay her, so she has him take her to a ballet academy run by Monique Vasquez. Monique has Joe join their ballet performance to show him that ballet takes just as much athletic ability as football. Joe and Peyton begin their relationship after Peyton calls his arrogant and selfish behavior to his attention. Joe takes Peyton and her new friends to the mall where he begins to develop romantic feelings for Monique.\n\nThe Rebels march through the playoffs via three road games: Denver in the Wild Card round, Indianapolis in the Divisional round, and finally Baltimore in the Conference round. They eventually make it to the championship game held in Arizona in a rematch with the New York Dukes. Stella offers Joe a $25 million endorsement deal with Fanny's Burgers, a successful fast food restaurant run by Samuel Blake, Jr., if he wins the game and mentions the product to the press. While at lunch with Joe and Monique at the Barking Crab, Peyton accidentally reveals that she was scheduled to go to a ballet school program for the month, but instead, she ran away to meet her father. Before Joe can fully process this, Peyton has an allergic reaction to the nuts in the dessert she was eating, and Joe rushes her to the hospital; however, the doctors tell him that the reaction is mild, and his daughter is going to be fine.\n\nJoe's former sister-in-law and Peyton's legal guardian, Karen Kelly, arrives to take her home and reveals to Joe that Sara was killed in a traffic accident six months earlier. After Peyton overhears Stella on the phone explaining that she would be a huge distraction to Joe, Peyton decides to return home with Karen. Later, while going through Peyton's bag under her bed at Joe's house, Joe finds some photos and reads a letter from Sara, saying that she hid Peyton away from Joe, as his career was just starting and she didn\u2019t want Peyton to be a distraction to him.\n\nAs the championship game begins, Joe's mind is not fully set on the game and he is soon injured. Joe is then surprised to discover that Peyton has arrived with Karen. Understanding Joe's earlier words about how he wants to remain in Peyton's life, Karen decides to let Peyton live with Joe. Near the end of the fourth quarter, Joe passes the ball to the running back, Jamal Webber, who gains positive yardage but fails to get out of bounds. Joe hurries his team to the line with the clock running and rushes ahead before being knocked out of bounds. With time for one last play, Joe throws a lob pass to Sanders, who catches the pass, allowing the Rebels to win their first championship. In a post-game interview, Joe declines the Fanny's Burgers offer to be with Peyton.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson]] as Joseph \"Joe\" Kingman\n* [[Madison Pettis]] as Peyton Kelly\n* [[Roselyn S\u00e1nchez]] as Monique Vasquez\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as Stella Peck\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Travis Sanders\n* [[Paige Turco]] as Karen Kelly\n* [[Hayes MacArthur]] as Kyle Cooper\n* [[Brian J.
