Directed by [[James Fargo]], it stars [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Harry Callahan (character)|Inspector \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan]], [[Tyne Daly]] as Inspector Kate Moore, and [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] as criminal mastermind Bobby Maxwell. It was also the last film in the series to feature [[John Mitchum]] as Inspector Frank DiGiorgio.\n\nThe film is memorable for containing more comedic dialogue than any other entry in the ''Dirty Harry'' franchise, as well as offering a more fleshed out partner for protagonist Callahan.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Enforcer Review|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-enforcer-1976}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Marin County]], two gas company men are lured by a scantily clad woman to a remote spot in [[Mill Valley]], where both are killed by Bobby Maxwell. Maxwell leads a group of men and women calling themselves the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), who pose as a terrorist organization to conceal the true purpose of their criminal activities.\n\nInspector Harry Callahan and his partner Frank DiGiorgio deal with a conman faking a heart attack at a restaurant before being called in to deal with a holdup at a liquor store. When the robbers take hostages and demand a police car so they can escape, Callahan drives his into the front of the store and uses the resulting chaos to gun them down. Callahan's superior, Captain Jerome McKay, angrily reprimands him for \"[[excessive force|excessive use of force]]\", injuring the hostages, and causing $14,379 in damages; as punishment, Callahan is transferred to the Personnel department, where he is forced to participate in the interview process for promotions. He is dismayed to learn that under the [[Mayor of San Francisco|mayor]]'s new [[Affirmative Action in the United States|affirmative action]] rules, several of the promotions must go to women, including Kate Moore, a desk officer with no field experience.\n\nThe PRSF uses the stolen gas company van and uniforms to steal [[M72 LAW]] rockets, [[M16 rifles]], a [[taser]], and other weapons from a warehouse. DiGiorgio and another officer catch them in the act, but Maxwell fatally wounds DiGiorgio with a knife, runs the other cop over with the van, and kills one of his own followers despite her only having minor wounds. Callahan is transferred back to Homicide, but is distressed to find out that Moore is his new partner. While watching a [[U.S. Army]] demonstration of the LAW rocket on a [[Fort Baker|firing range]], Callahan notices Moore standing right behind the rocket and pulls her out of the way of potentially lethal backblast. Irritated by the incident, Callahan tells Moore he is doubtful of her ability to perform in dangerous situations and warns her that a failure in such an incident could endanger both their lives.\n\nCallahan and Moore are leaving an autopsy at the [[Hall of Justice (San Francisco)|Hall of Justice]] when a bomb explodes in the bathroom. The inspectors chase down and capture the bomber, and meet \"Big\" Ed Mustapha, leader of a [[Black Power|black militant]] group to which the bomber formerly belonged. Although Callahan makes a deal with Mustapha for information, McKay arrests him and his followers for the PRSF's crimes, damaging Callahan's credibility. Callahan angrily refuses to participate in a televised press conference in which the publicity-seeking mayor intends to commend him and Moore for Mustapha's arrest; McKay then suspends Callahan and takes his badge. However, Moore informs Callahan that she will continue to help him in any way she can, and the two share drinks in a sign of mutual respect.\n\nThe PRSF ambushes the mayor's motorcade as he leaves a [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] game at [[Candlestick Park]], killing his bodyguard and aide and taking him hostage with a ransom of $5 million. Callahan bails out Mustapha, who gives him the name of a priest who mentored Maxwell; Moore then saves Callahan's life when Wanda (disguised as a [[nun]]) tries to shoot him in the back. The priest reveals that the PRSF are squatting on [[Alcatraz Island]]. Callahan distracts the gang while Moore frees the mayor, but Maxwell kills her before they can get off the island. Callahan avenges Moore by cornering him in an old guard tower and blowing it up with a LAW rocket. Ignoring the mayor's profuse gratitude, Callahan abandons him and walks over to his partner's corpse as McKay arrives in a helicopter and announces to the deceased Maxwell that the SFPD will give in to all of his demands.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Inspector]] [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]]\n* [[Tyne Daly]] as Inspector Kate Moore\n* [[Harry Guardino]] as Lieutenant Al Bressler\n* [[Bradford Dillman]] as Captain Jerome McKay\n* [[John Mitchum]] as Inspector Frank DiGiorgio\n* Bill Ackridge as Andy\n* [[DeVeren Bookwalter]] as [[Bobby Maxwell (character)|Bobby Maxwell]]\n* [[Albert Popwell]] as Ed \"Big Ed\" Mustapha\n* [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]] as The Mayor of San Francisco\n* [[Robert Hoy]] as Buchinski\n* [[Michael Cavanaugh (actor)|Michael Cavanaugh]] as Lalo\n* Jocelyn Jones as Miki Waleska\n* [[Dick Durock]] as Karl\n* Samantha Doane as Wanda\n* [[M.G.

Schurr, with the title ''Moving Target''. After seeing ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' and ''[[Magnum Force]]'', the two fledgling writers decided to pen a screenplay of their own featuring the character of Inspector Harry Callahan. Inspired by the [[Patty Hearst]] kidnapping in 1974, the storyline had Inspector Harry Callahan going up against a violent militant group reminiscent of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. In the script, the militants kidnap and ransom the mayor of San Francisco.\n\nAfter the screenplay was finished, Hickman visited Eastwood's Carmel restaurant, The Hog's Breath Inn, and approached Eastwood's business partner, Paul Lippman, asking if he would give their effort to Eastwood. Lippman was initially hesitant, but finally agreed. Although Eastwood thought the script needed work, he liked the concept, particularly the priest with militant leanings and the portrayal of black militants, which was based on the [[Black Panther Party]].\n\nWarner Bros., meanwhile, eager to capitalize on the success of the two ''Dirty Harry'' films, had hired seasoned screenwriter [[Stirling Silliphant]] to write a new Harry Callahan story. Silliphant wrote a script called ''Dirty Harry and More'', in which the Callahan character was teamed up with an Asian-American woman partner named More. Eastwood liked the woman-partner angle, but felt the script spent too much time on character and did not have enough action. Eastwood then showed the Hickman/Schurr script to Silliphant, and Silliphant agreed to rewrite it.\n\nSilliphant wrote the script throughout late 1975 and early 1976 and delivered his draft to Eastwood in February 1976. While Eastwood approved, he believed the emphasis was still too much on the character relationships rather than the action, and was concerned the fans might not approve.  He then brought in screenwriter [[Dean Riesner]], who had worked on the scripts of ''Dirty Harry'' and ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'', to do revisions.\n\n=== Casting ===\nRecurring characters Lieutenant Bressler (Harry Guardino) and Frank DiGiorgio (Mitchum) reprise their roles for the last time in a ''Dirty Harry'' film. Bressler was Callahan's boss in the first film of the series; DiGiorgio appeared in the previous two, but dies in this film. A new character, Captain Jerome McKay (Dillman), was introduced as Callahan's superior officer. Dillman played a similar role, Captain Briggs, in ''[[Sudden Impact]]''.\n\nAlbert Popwell also returns as a character in this film, having played the Bank Robber in the first film of the series and Sidney the pimp in ''[[Magnum Force]]''.\n\nThe character of Kate Moore, Harry's female partner, went to Tyne Daly. Daly's casting was initially uncertain, given that she turned down the role three times. She objected to the way her character was treated in parts of the film and showed concern that two members of the police force falling in love on the job was problematic, given that they would be putting their lives in jeopardy by not reaching peak efficiency. Daly was permitted to read the drafts of the script developed by Riesner and had significant leeway in the development of her character, although after seeing the film at the premiere, was horrified by the extent of the violence.{{sfn|McGilligan|1999|page=275}}{{sfn|McGilligan|1999|page=278}} Regarding Callahan's relationship with Moore, Eastwood stated:<ref name=\"youmustrememberthis\">\"Starting Over: 1970-1990\". ''You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story'' (2008)</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|I didn't see Dirty Harry going for a Hollywood-type glamour girl. He's the kind of guy that when he dated somebody it was probably a secretary or receptionist somewhere, somebody he would meet along the way...Tyne Daly was perfect for the part. It starts out like great love should, it starts out...by earning respect and she earns his respect and then you think \"Could be, could go another step.\"}}\n\n=== Filming ===\nWhen production began, the working title of the film was ''Dirty Harry III'', in keeping with other sequels of the time. Eastwood felt that the film needed a title of its own, and in the middle of production came up with ''The Enforcer''.\n\nAfter his disputes with [[Ted Post]] on the set of the previous ''Dirty Harry'' installment, Eastwood fully intended to direct ''The Enforcer'' himself. Eastwood's replacement of [[Philip Kaufman]] on ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (and the consequent need to handle post-production on that film) left him without enough time to prepare himself to direct ''The Enforcer''. As a result, Eastwood gave the director's chair to [[James Fargo]], his longtime [[assistant director]], who made his debut as a full director on this film. Eastwood had the final say on all the critical decisions, but since the two men were far more familiar with each other's working styles than Eastwood had been with Ted Post, they rarely butted heads during production.\n\nFilming commenced in the San Francisco Bay area in the summer of 1976. Eastwood was initially still dubious about the quantity of his lines and preferred a less talkative approach, something perhaps embedded in him by [[Sergio Leone]].<ref name=\"McGilligan276\">McGilligan (1999), p.276</ref> The film ended up considerably shorter than the previous Dirty Harry films, and was cut to 95 minutes for its final running time.{{sfn|McGilligan|1999|page=277}}\n\nThe music score for ''The Enforcer'' was written by [[Jerry Fielding]], making ''The Enforcer'' the only ''Dirty Harry'' film without a score by [[Lalo Schifrin]]. The film was originally intended to be the last ''Dirty Harry'' film of a trilogy. A poll conducted by Warner Bros. in 1983 led to the development of a fourth film, ''Sudden Impact'', and the resurrection of the film series. Eastwood never intended to make more ''Dirty Harry'' films, but private agreements with the studio allowed him to do more \"personal\" films in exchange for doing the subsequent sequels.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\n\n[[Richard Eder]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was negative, stating, \"Money, the big name of Clint Eastwood, a lot of gore and howling sirens and the urge to rail at various liberal notions are not enough to make even a passable movie out of 'The Enforcer.'\"<ref>Eder, Richard (December 23, 1976).
