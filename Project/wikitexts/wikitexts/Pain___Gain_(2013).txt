It is based on the activities of the [[Sun Gym gang]], a group of ex-convicts and [[bodybuilders]] convicted of kidnapping, extortion, torture, and murder in [[Miami]] in the mid-1990s. [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]]'s screenplay is adapted from a 1999 series of ''[[Miami New Times]]'' articles by Pete Collins, which were compiled in the book ''Pain & Gain: This Is a True Story'', released concurrently with the film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Pete|title=the articles in question|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/specialReports/pain-and-gain-from-new-times-story-to-michael-bay-film-1890864/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219053057/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/specialReports/pain-and-gain-from-new-times-story-to-michael-bay-film-1890864/|archive-date=February 19, 2015|access-date=October 10, 2012|publisher=Miaminewtimes.com|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=April 19, 2009|title=Full Details on Michael Bay's \"Small Movie\" Project &#124; /Film|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/full-details-on-michael-bays-small-movie-project/|access-date=October 10, 2012|publisher=Slashfilm.com}}</ref> The film's title is a play on a common adage frequently used in fitness: \"[[No pain, no gain]]\".\n\nReleased on April 11, 2013, ''Pain & Gain'' received generally mixed reviews, praised for its script but criticized for the violence, directing, and historical inaccuracies. Against a $22 million budget, the film grossed $86 million worldwide.

Lugo befriends trainer and bodybuilder Adrian Doorbal, rendered [[Impotency|impotent]] from steroids. He envies the earnings and lifestyle of Victor Kershaw, a member he begins to train. \n\nInspired to be a \"doer\" by a motivational speaker, Lugo plans to [[extort]] Kershaw for his assets. He recruits Doorbal and Paul Doyle, another ex-con and [[Born again Christian|born again-Christian]] struggling with drug use.\n\nThe \"Sun Gym gang\" kidnaps Kershaw, taking him to a small warehouse. Although Kershaw identifies Lugo, the scheme proceeds as planned. Under duress, Kershaw makes calls to provide explanations for his disappearance and transfers his assets to Lugo. Mese is bribed to [[Notary public|notarize]] documents in Kershaw's absence. After collecting Kershaw's money and assets, the gang attempts to kill Kershaw. They stage a drunk driving accident, then burn his car, then run him over. \n\nThe gang members spoil themselves with Kershaw's riches. Lugo takes over Kershaw's car and home; Doorbal marries Robin, the nurse treating his impotence; Doyle abandons his restraints, blowing his money on cocaine and his new stripper girlfriend.\n\nUnbeknownst to the gang, Kershaw survives and is hospitalized. He informs the police, who dismiss his story because of Kershaw's manner, blood alcohol level and him being from a South American country known for drug trafficking. Kershaw contacts [[Ed Du Bois, III]], a retired [[private investigator]], who warns Kershaw to leave the hospital. Kershaw takes his advice and hide in a cheap motel. Du Bois tails the gang and meets Lugo, who becomes suspicious at the mention of Kershaw.\n\nAfter Kershaw furiously calls Mese about his stolen money, the gang identified the motel he stays at. They go to kill him, but he has already checked out. They discover Du Bois' link to Kershaw and plan to kidnap him, but the plan falls through.\n\nDoyle and Doorbal, having gone broke after excessive spendings, plan another kidnapping with Lugo. They target Frank Griga, owner of a [[phone sex]] operation. They lure Griga and his wife Krisztina Furton to Doorbal's to propose an investment scheme. The discussion breaks down and a physical fistfight ensues. One of Doorbal's weights falls on Griga's head, killing him. Doorbal accidentally kills Krisztina by overdosing her with [[tranquilizer]].\n\nThey dismember the bodies and dispose of them in a swamp. Doyle, perturbed by the violence, leaves the gang and returns to the priest's church. The police learn of Griga and Krisztina's disappearances and, with evidence from Du Bois, plan to arrest the Sun Gym gang.\n\nThe police arrest Doyle at the church, Doorbal at home, and Mese at the Sun Gym. Lugo flees in Kershaw's [[speedboat]]. Deducing his move, the police rush to a bank in [[Nassau, Bahamas]] to catch him. Lugo slips away again, but gets runs over by Kershaw and is finally arrested.\n \nAt the trial, Doyle gives a full confession incriminating Doorbal and Lugo; Robin also testifies against Doorbal. Lugo and Doorbal is sentenced to death. Doyle and Mese are sentenced to 15 years. Doyle served 7 years and converted back to Christianity while Mese died in prison.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Daniel Lugo\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Paul Doyle (based on Carl Weekes, Stevenson Pierre, and Jorge Delgado)\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Adrian 'Noel' Doorbal\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Victor Kershaw (based on Marc Schiller)\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Detective Ed Du Bois, III\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as John Mese\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Robin Peck (based on Cindy Eldridge)\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Jonny Wu (based on [[Tom Vu]])\n* [[Bar Paly]] as Sorina Luminita (based on Sabina Petrescu)\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Frank Griga\n* [[Tony Plana]] as Captain Lopez\n* [[Emily Rutherfurd]] as Carolyn 'Cissy' DuBois\n* [[Yolanthe Sneijder-Cabau]] as Analee Calvera\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Pastor Randy\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Dr. Bjornson\n* [[Brian Stepanek]] as Brad MacCalister\n* [[Kurt Angle]] as Benjamin Rowe\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Michael Bay]] first announced the film after the release of ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' (2009).

When we're told it's 'still a true story,' we're watching one invented character watch a semi-fictional character do something that sorta kinda took place.\"<ref name=\"slate\" />\n\nThe film portrayed the Sun Gym gang as consisting of three primary members: the Irish-American Daniel Lugo, African-American Adrian Noel Doorbal, and Samoan/African-American Paul Doyle; and two accomplices (John Mese, the Sun Gym owner and Miami Shores accountant<ref name=\"Pete Collins\">{{cite news|title='Pain & Gain' Writer Pete Collins' 15 Minutes of Fame Have Arrived|author=Pete Collins|date= April 25, 2013|journal=Miami New Times|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2013-04-25/film/pain-and-gain-pete-collins-new-times/2/}}</ref> who notarized Kershaw's \u2013 in reality, Marc Schiller's \u2013 documents for Lugo; and stripper Sorina Luminita - based on Sabina Petrescu - whom Lugo claimed to have recruited to serve as the gang's ''[[femme fatale]]''). In reality, the gang was much larger, Daniel Lugo was of [[Puerto Rican People|Puerto Rican descent]], Noel Doorbal was a native of [[Trinidad]], and Doyle's character is a composite of several real life individuals of different nationalities who were not depicted in the film, such as Carl Weekes, Jorge Delgado, and Stevenson Pierre. Additionally, Doorbal's real-life girlfriend (Cindy Eldridge) helped scrub blood off Doorbal's condominium walls after Doorbal had dismembered Griga and Furton's bodies. Unlike Sorina, who in the film Lugo passes on to Doyle, the real-life Sabina and Lugo remained together as a couple and became engaged, and they fled together to the Bahamas (with Lugo's parents).<ref name=\"slate\" /><ref name=\"miaminewtimes.com\">{{cite news|title=Pain & Gain: Where the Real-Life Sun Gym Gang Characters Are Now|author= Francisco Alvarado|date= April 4, 2013|url= http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2013-04-04/news/pain-and-gain-where-the-real-life-sun-gym-gang-characters-are-now/full/}}</ref> Additional real-life players in the events are detailed in the ''Miami New Times'' article, \"Sidebar: Cast of Characters\".<ref>{{cite news|journal=Miami New Times|title=Sidebar|date=December 30, 1999|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1999-12-30/music/sidebar/|access-date=May 8, 2013|archive-date=August 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823113905/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1999-12-30/music/sidebar/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Victor Kershaw states he was born in [[Bogot\u00e1, Colombia]].

She was a Miss Romania finalist in 1990 and a former ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' model.<ref name=\"Pete Collins\" /> Lugo really did convince Petrescu that he was a CIA operative, who was working to kidnap enemies of the U.S. government.

In contrast to the film, the gang did not secure Schiller's seat-belt before crashing the car, and Schiller did not survive the crash from inside the car; rather, Schiller bailed out of the car, rolling onto the ground, before it hit the pole. When crashing the car and setting Schiller ablaze failed, the real-life gang ran over Schiller's body twice, but with a [[Toyota Camry]], not a van.<ref name=\"miaminewtimes.com\" /><ref name=\"Francisco Alvarado\">{{cite news| url= http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2013/04/pain_gain_a_guide_to_the_movie.php | journal=Miami New Times|title=Pain & Gain: A Pictorial Dummy's Guide to the Real-Life Tale|author= Francisco Alvarado |date= April 3, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe movie portrays Paul Doyle as first running into a demeaning Frank Griga at a strip club. In reality, Doorbal first discovered Griga when Doorbal spotted a picture of a [[Lamborghini Diablo]] in a photo album belonging to his Hungarian stripper girlfriend, Beatriz Weiland. He asked her who owned it. It turned out that Griga was one of Weiland's former generous boyfriends. It was she who introduced Griga to the gang. In reality, Frank Griga was Hungarian and therefore lacked an American accent, in contrast to his onscreen portrayal.\n\nThe gang did meet at Frank Griga's home as in the movie. In reality, they met three times; the final instance at Doorbal's [[Miami Lakes]] apartment, where the murders actually took place. In reality, Lugo did not kill Griga\u2014Doorbal did, by first cracking the side of his head with a blunt object, then strangling him with a headlock, and finally injecting him with [[Xylazine|Rompun]]. Krisztina Furton ran to see what had happened, and screamed. Lugo covered her mouth and tackled her. She had no gun, contrary to the movie portrayal. She was bound, then Doorbal injected her with the drug. Overall, Doorbal injected her three separate times, instead of twice.\n\n''Miami New Times'' reporter Francisco Alvarado reports the facts associated with the power tools purchased by the gang, the cause of the chainsaw's failure, and the ensuing details, some of which differed from their film portrayal:<ref name=\"slate\" /><ref name=\"Francisco Alvarado\"/> \n<blockquote>They bought a gas-powered chainsaw from [[The Home Depot|Home Depot]] to cut off body parts but forgot to fill it with motor oil, so it broke the first time they cranked the power tool on. Lugo returned the chainsaw to Home Depot, demanding a refund. He left the home-improvement store with an electric Remington Power Cutter, which came with a one-year guarantee to 'handle all your cutting chores quickly and easily.' He went back to the warehouse and handed the chainsaw to Doorbal, who took charge of the grisly dismemberment. When the power tool's teeth got caught in Furton's hair, Doorbal had Lugo chop off her head with a hatchet. The two murderers then used a curved blade and pliers to remove the faces and teeth off the heads.</blockquote>\n\nThe movie depicted Lugo and Doorbal dumping the body parts in several barrels into a lake located somewhere in what appears to be the [[Everglades]]. In reality, Lugo, Doorbal, and \"Little Mario\" Gray dumped Griga and Furton's torsos-in-drums into a drainage ditch in southwest Miami.\n\nDetails in the scene in which Paul was shown incinerating the victims' severed hands on a barbecue grill (to remove the fingerprints) were changed; in reality, Lugo did the grilling, using a steel drum with an iron grate laid on top, not a barbecue grill. Lugo tossed Griga and Furton's hands, feet, and skull fragments onto the grate, doused them in gasoline, and began to grill. When Delgado returned to the warehouse, he yelled at Lugo, who reluctantly agreed to move his operation from in front of the warehouse to the rear alley.<ref name=\"slate\" /><ref name=\"miaminewtimes.com\"/>\n\nIn the film, Doyle robbed an armored truck and got his toe shot off while escaping. That sequence is entirely fictional; no member of the Sun Gym gang actually robbed an armored truck or had their toe shot off.<ref name=\"slate\" />\n\nRobin Peck ([[Rebel Wilson]]'s character), Doorbal's girlfriend, then wife, in the film, is based on Cindy Eldridge, who did refer Doorbal to a doctor. Contrary to events in the film, they did not meet at a medical office, they did not have a whirlwind courtship or marry at home, and Doorbal did not need to commit further crimes to fund his injections. Furthermore, Doorbal was violent and sadistic in real life, unlike [[Anthony Mackie]]'s mild-mannered character in the movie.<ref name=\"slate\" />\n\n===Arrests===\nIn the movie, the police arrest:\n* Mese at the Sun Gym\u2014In reality, Mese was arrested at his own bodybuilding competition in Downtown Miami.\n* Doyle at the church\u2014Doyle's real composite counterparts were all arrested at home.\n\nIn the film, Lugo escapes in Kershaw's [[go-fast boat]], and at Du Bois' house, Kershaw asserts that he owns a boat. In reality, Schiller did not own a boat. Only Griga owned a boat; it was a tall yacht christened ''Foreplay''.\n\nNear the end of the movie, Lugo is seen getting hit by a car driven by Kershaw, in the Bahamas. This event did not happen. In reality, Lugo fled to the Bahamas with his fianc\u00e9e and his parents, and neither Schiller nor the detective, Du Bois, was there during his capture. Instead, a multi-agency task force apprehended Lugo at the Hotel Montague in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]].<ref name=\"miaminewtimes.com\" />\n\nAt the end of the movie, Doyle has an attack of conscience, confesses, and testifies against Lugo and Doorbal. Instead of the death penalty, he gets 15 years but only serves 7\u00bd. Carl Weekes, the religious and recurring drug-abuser part of Doyle's composite, drove the car that ran over Schiller and got 10 years for attempted murder; he served 7 years. Jorge Delgado, who actually testified against the rest of the gang, did so in order to avoid the death penalty.\n\nIn the film, DuBois is portrayed as a retired police officer who takes over his \"old man's detective agency\" when he accepts Kershaw's case. In reality, Ed Du Bois III has been a licensed private investigator since 1960 and took over his father's agency in 1968. Du Bois continues in this capacity to this day.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}<!-- partial source pages 4 & 5 --><ref name=\"mnt2013-04-04\" />\n\nThe end credits of the film state that John Mese was sentenced to 15 years and died in prison. While he did die of a [[stroke]] in 2004, his sentence was actually 56 years.\n\nAmong the multiple major differences between the film and the real-life story, writer David Chen notes that the real-life gang member whose temperament is most like that of the character, Paul Doyle (played by Dwayne Johnson):<ref name=\"slashfilm.com\"/> \n<blockquote>In reality, the third man in the Sun Gym Gang was a man named Carl Weekes, who most closely resembles the Paul Doyle character in the film \u2014 both are trying to make a new life in Miami, and both are born again Christians. But Weekes is a weakling; Collins describes him as \"a lightweight\" who weighed only 140. Moreover, he's almost totally excluded from the later events in the story, in which sex mogul Frank Griga is killed.</blockquote>\n\n==Controversy==\n[[The Associated Press]] published an article interviewing survivors and investigators of the Sun Gym gang. Miami-Dade Police Sgt. Felix Jimenez stated: \"You are talking about real people. And in this particular case, especially when you're talking about the murder victims, these were innocent victims.\" Zsuzsanna Griga, whose brother and brother's girlfriend the gang killed and dismembered, said she didn't want the American public to sympathize with the killers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/04/pain-gain-real-life-survivors_n_3013245.html|work=The Huffington Post|title='Pain & Gain' Real-Life Survivors Furious With Movie's Comic Take On Ordeal|date=April 4, 2013|access-date=April 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDavid Haglund and Forrest Wickman of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote, in a post titled \"How True Is ''Pain & Gain''?\": \"In addition to the usual Hollywood streamlining and the amping up of certain scenes, the changes seem largely designed to make the central criminals more sympathetic.
