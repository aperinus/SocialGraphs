There are several other [[Adaptations of Anna Karenina#Film|film adaptations]] of the novel.\n\nIn New York, the film opened at the [[Capitol Theatre (New York City)|Capitol Theatre]], the site of many prestigious MGM premieres.  The film earned $2,304,000 at the box office, and won the Mussolini Cup for best foreign film at the [[Venice Film Festival]].

In addition, the film was ranked #42 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=July 2018}}\nAnna Karenina ([[Greta Garbo]]) is the wife of Czarist official Karenin ([[Basil Rathbone]]). While she tries to persuade her brother Stiva ([[Reginald Owen]]) from a life of debauchery, she becomes infatuated with dashing military officer Count Vronsky ([[Fredric March]]). This indiscreet liaison ruins her marriage and position in 19th century Russian society; she is even prohibited from seeing her own son Sergei ([[Freddie Bartholomew]]), with eventual dire results.<ref>''[http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/anna-karenina-74494 Anna Karenina] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119111616/http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/anna-karenina-74494 |date=November 19, 2009 }}'', allmovie.com</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Greta Garbo]] as [[Anna Karenina]]\n* [[Fredric March]] as Count Vronsky\n* [[Freddie Bartholomew]] as Sergei\n* [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] as Kitty\n* [[May Robson]] as Countess Vronsky\n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as Karenin\n* [[Reginald Owen]] as Stiva\n* [[Phoebe Foster]] as Dolly\n* [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]] as Yashvin\n* [[Gyles Isham]] as Levin\n* [[Joan Marsh]] as Lili\n* [[Ethel Griffies]] as Mme.
