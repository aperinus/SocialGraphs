He takes the boys on a holiday to a remote island on a lake that turns into a test of manhood of almost mythic proportions. It won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] (as well as the award for the best first film). It received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nIn a 2016 [[BBC]] critics' poll, ''The Return'' was ranked the 80th-greatest film of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=September 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn contemporary Russia, Ivan and his older brother Andrei have grown a deep attachment to each other to make up for their fatherless childhood. Both their mother and grandmother live with them. After running home after a fight with each other, the boys are shocked to discover their father has returned after a 12-year absence. With their mother's uneasy blessing, Ivan and Andrei set out on what they believe will be a simple fishing vacation with him.\n\nAndrei is delighted to be reunited with their father and Ivan is apprehensive towards the man whom they know only from a faded photograph.\n\nAt first, both brothers are pleased with the prospect of an exciting adventure, but they soon strain under the weight of their father's awkward and increasingly brutal efforts to make up for the missing decade. Ivan and Andrei find themselves alternately tested, rescued, scolded, mentored, scrutinized, and ignored by the man. Andrei seems to look up to his father while Ivan remains stubbornly defensive.\n\nAs the truck stops and caf\u00e9s give way to rain-swept, primeval wilderness coastline, Ivan's doubts give way to open defiance. Andrei's powerful need to bond with a father he's never known begins, in turn, to distance him from Ivan. Ivan and his father's test of will escalates into bitter hostility and sudden violence after the trio arrives at their mysterious island destination.\n\nIvan has an outburst of anger after witnessing his father strike Andrei. He shouts at his father, runs into the forest, and climbs to the top of the observatory tower. Andrei and their father run after him. The father tries to reason with Ivan, but this only stresses Ivan further. He then threatens to jump down from the top of the tower. The father tries to reach out to him, but falls to his death.\n\nIvan and Andrei take the body across the forest, bring him on board the boat, and row back to where they came. While the boys are putting their gear in the car, the boat starts to drift away. Andrei screams, \"Father!\" and starts running towards the shore, followed by Ivan, but it is too late. The boat and the body are sinking. Ivan screams \"Father!\" for the first and the last time from the bottom of his heart. They get into the car and drive away. The film ends with photographs from their journey; since the father does not appear on any of them, there is no proof that Andrei and Ivan went on a trip with him.\n\n==Cast==\n* Vladimir Garin as Andrei \n* [[Ivan Dobronravov]] as Ivan (Vanya)\n* [[Konstantin Lavronenko]] as Father\n* [[Natalia Vdovina]] as Mother\n\n==Production==\n''The Return'' was filmed on and around [[Lake Ladoga]] and the [[Gulf of Finland]].
