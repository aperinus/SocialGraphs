It stars Dangerfield in the title role, with [[Debi Mazar]], [[Michael Weatherly]], [[Cindy Williams]], [[Alan Rachins]], [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[David Ogden Stiers]] costarring.\n\n==Plot==\nWally Sparks is the host of a sleazy tabloid-style TV talk show who makes [[Jerry Springer]] seem gentle by comparison. His show has become so foul that he's alienated his not-especially-discriminating viewers, and his ratings are taking a nosedive.\n\nLenny Spencer, head of the network carrying his show, gives Wally an ultimatum\u2014he has a week to clean up the content and boost his ratings, or his show gets cancelled.\n\nWally's producer, Sandy Gallo, comes up with an idea\u2014Floyd Preston is the governor of Georgia and a staunch conservative known for his attacks on the lowbrow content of Wally's show, so what better way to demonstrate that Wally is trying to change his ways than to have Preston on the show as a guest?\n\nIn order to persuade Preston to appear, Wally accepts an invitation to a reception at the Governor's Mansion, later learning that the Governor's teenage son is the fan who sent him the invitation. Wally makes the mistake of participating in a drunken game of strip poker with Preston's wife, Emily, while somehow involving himself in a plot to blackmail the Governor. Further complications ensue when Wally's son, Dean, begins a romantic relationship with the Governor's daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n=== Main cast ===\n<!-- Main cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rodney Dangerfield]] as Wally Sparks\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Sandy Gallo\n* [[Cindy Williams]] as Emily Preston\n* [[Alan Rachins]] as Judge Randal Williams\n* [[Michael Weatherly]] as Dean Sparks\n* [[Lisa Thornhill]] as Priscilla Preston\n* [[Mark L.
