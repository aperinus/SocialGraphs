Produced by [[Scott Rudin]], the film takes place in a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[elementary school]] named for [[St. Nicholas]], led by Sister Aloysius ([[Meryl Streep]]). Sister James ([[Amy Adams]]) tells Aloysius that Father Flynn ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) might be paying too much attention to the school's only black student, Donald Miller (Joseph Foster), thus leading to Aloysius investigating Flynn's behaviour. The film also features [[Viola Davis]] as Donald Miller's mother, Mrs. Miller, in her first notable role.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Jazmine |date=April 12, 2022 |title=Viola Davis, Inside Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/magazine/viola-davis.html |journal=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered October 30, 2008, at the [[AFI Fest]] before being distributed by [[Miramax Films]] in [[limited release]] on December 12 and in [[wide release]] on December 25. Grossing $50.9 million against a budget of $20 million, the film received largely positive reviews from critics. Streep, Hoffman, Adams, and Davis were highly praised for their performances, and all were nominated for Oscars at the [[81st Academy Awards]]. Shanley was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1964 at a [[Catholic]] church in [[The Bronx]], priest Father Brendan Flynn gives a homily on doubt, noting that, like [[faith]], it can be a unifying force. Sister Aloysius, the strict principal of the church's [[Parochial school|parish school]], becomes concerned when she sees a boy pull away from him in the courtyard. Her [[Sisters of Charity of New York|sisters]] are told to be alert to suspicious activity in the school.\n\nSister James, a young and naive teacher, receives a request for Donald Miller, an [[altar boy]] and the school's only African-American student, to see Flynn in the [[rectory]]. When he returns to class he's upset and she smells alcohol on his breath. Later, she sees Flynn placing an undershirt in Donald's locker. Reporting her suspicions to Aloysius, she says such suspicions disquiet her faith. Aloysius tells her that when you address wrongdoing, you take a step away from God, but in His service.\n\nAloysius and James invite Flynn into the office supposedly to discuss the school's Christmas pageant. During their discussion, the women express drastically different perspectives on how the church should function with regard to the working class: Flynn believes they should relate to their parishioners more actively through shared interests and community activities, while Aloysius believes that clear boundaries set by the clergy facilitate the relationship with the parishioners.\n\nEventually, Aloysius brings up Donald Miller, noting that he is the only Black child in the school, at risk of being singled out. She states that even Flynn gave him special treatment, like the private meeting they had last week. He becomes defensive over her insinuations and eventually reveals he called Donald to the rectory because he had been caught drinking [[Sacramental wine]]. Flynn had been keeping it quiet to protect Donald, but now that Aloysius has forced it out, he must be removed as an altar boy. James is greatly relieved to hear the explanation. Flynn's next homily is on the evils of gossip.\n\nUnconvinced, Aloysius meets with Donald's mother regarding her suspicions. When describing the potential abusive relationship between Donald and Flynn, she is shocked by Mrs. Miller's seeming ambivalence. Finally, the mother tearfully admits that Donald is gay, and fears his physically abusive [[homophobia|homophobic]] father would kill him if he knew. She describes her difficult position: unable to protect her son from his father's violence, Flynn is the only male figure who has shown Donald any kindness. His position at the school shields him from bullies, and leaving the school now could compromise the better socioeconomic future the school can give Donald. She begs Aloysius to solve the situation by removing Flynn over Donald, but she is unsure of what she can do, given Flynn's entrenched position within the patriarchal senior clergy.\n\nKnowing she has spoken with Donald's mother, Father Flynn threatens to remove Aloysius from her position if she does not back down. She informs him she contacted a nun from his last parish, discovering a history of past infringements. He demands to know what proof she has, and she admits that all she has is her certainty. Flynn accuses her of insubordination and acting outside her duties. She threatens she will do whatever it takes to force him out, even if it means being thrown out of the church herself.\n\nDeclaring his innocence, Flynn pleads, asking if she herself has never committed a [[mortal sin]]. Aloysius rejects his claims of innocence, threatening blackmail if he does not resign immediately. Acknowledging his downfall would be inevitable should he ignore her threats, he maintains he did nothing wrong, and her own certainty of wrongdoing is fallible. She demands Flynn request a transfer, which he does, delivering a final homily before departing.\n\nSome time later, Aloysius tells James that Flynn has since been appointed to a more prestigious position at a larger church. She reveals that she lied about contacting a nun at Flynn's former parish, reasoning that if it were false, the ruse would not have worked. To her, his resignation is proof of his guilt. James, still believing in Flynn's innocence, is shocked by her lie, but Aloysius restates that, \"In the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God,\" but adds that doing so comes with a price. She then breaks down, tearfully exclaiming, \"I have doubts...I have such doubts!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Sister Aloysius Beauvier, the parish school principal\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Father Brendan Flynn\n* [[Amy Adams]] as [[Margaret McEntee|Sister James]], a history teacher at the school\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Mrs. Miller, Donald Miller's mother\n* Joseph Foster as Donald Miller, the school's first black student\n\nThe other sisters in the film include [[Alice Drummond]] as Sister Veronica, [[Audrie J.
