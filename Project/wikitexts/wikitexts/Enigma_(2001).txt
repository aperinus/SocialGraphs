The script was adapted from the 1995 novel ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], about the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] codebreakers of [[Bletchley Park]] in the [[Second World War]].\n\nAlthough the story is highly fictionalised, the process of encrypting German messages during World War II and decrypting them with the Enigma is discussed in detail, and the historical event of the [[Katyn massacre]] is highlighted. It was the last film scored by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story, loosely based on actual events, takes place in March 1943, when the [[Second World War]] was at its height. The [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] at [[Bletchley Park]], [[Buckinghamshire]], have a problem: the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[U-boat]]s have changed one of their code reference books used for [[Enigma machine]] [[cipher]]s, leading to a blackout in the flow of vital naval [[signals intelligence]]. The British cryptanalysts have cracked the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#M4 (German Navy 4-rotor Enigma)|\"Shark\" cipher]] once before, and they need to do it again in order to keep track of U-boat locations.\n\nThe film begins with Tom Jericho returning to Bletchley after a month recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by his failed love affair with a coworker named Claire Romilly. Jericho immediately seeks to see her again and finds that she mysteriously disappeared a few days earlier. He enlists the help of Claire's housemate, Hester Wallace, to follow the trail of clues and learn what has happened to Claire.\n\nMr. Jericho and Miss Wallace, as they formally address each other, work to decipher intercepts stolen by Claire and determine why she took them. Jericho is closely watched by an [[MI5]] agent, Wigram ([[Jeremy Northam]]), who plays [[cat and mouse]] with him throughout the film. Meanwhile, U-boats are closing in on a convoy of thirty seven ships from America, giving the code-breakers less than four days to find a solution to reading the changed Shark cipher.\n\nBut someone else at Bletchley has a personal interest in the stolen intercepts, and may be responsible for Claire's disappearance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Tom Jericho\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Hester Wallace\n* [[Saffron Burrows]] as Claire Romilly\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as Mr Wigram\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Jozef 'Puck' Pukowski\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Guy Logie\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Leveret\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as Cave\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Skynner\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as Admiral Trowbridge\n* [[Nicholas Rowe (actor)|Nicholas Rowe]] as Villiers\n* [[Edward Hardwicke]] as Heaviside\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production and premiere==\n[[File:BletcleyPark SubModel.JPG|thumb|The scaled-down model of a Second World War U-boat used in the film. The model was donated to the [[Bletchley Park]] museum.]]\nThe film was shot on location in [[England]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Netherlands]], with Bletchley Park mansion substituted by [[Chicheley Hall]].<ref>Sleeve notes from DVD.</ref> Other locations include the [[Great Central Railway]], [[Loughborough]] and Tigh Beg Croft, near [[Oban]], Scotland. Interiors were filmed at [[Elstree Film Studios]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157583/locations IMDb: ''Locations for Enigma''] Retrieved 2013-04-01</ref>\n\nThe film was produced by [[Mick Jagger]] of [[the Rolling Stones]]. Jagger makes a cameo appearance as an RAF officer at a dance. He also lent the film's design department a four-rotor Enigma encoding machine he owned to ensure the historical accuracy of one of the props. The festivities around the London premiere of the film are shown in the 2001 documentary ''[[Being Mick]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Sunbeam Talbot 2 litre Sports Tourer 1947.jpg|thumb|The Sunbeam-Talbot 2-litre driven by the character Tom Jericho in the film.]]\nCritical reviews were largely positive, but there was criticism of the largely fictional storyline, which neither mentions the real codebreaker, [[Alan Turing]], nor gives due credit to the Polish cryptanalysis foundation, the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w]] (Cipher Bureau). The film holds a 'fresh' 72% rating on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the consensus reading, 'The well-crafted, twist-filled Enigma is a thinking person's spy thriller.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1113649-enigma/|title=Enigma|date=19 April 2002|website=Rottentomatoes.com|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref> Joe Leydon of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] compared the film to works by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and remarked that, 'Overall, \"Enigma\" plays fair and square while generating suspense with its twisty plot. And while it requires a generous suspension of disbelief to accept a few action-hero gestures by the deeply troubled Jericho, Scott is persuasive and compelling enough as his complex character to drive the narrative.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/markets-festivals/enigma-2-1200466247/|title=Review: 'Enigma'|first=Joe|last=Leydon|date=24 January 2001|website=Variety|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars and said, 'What I like about the movie is its combination of suspense and intelligence. If it does not quite explain exactly how decryption works (how could it?), it at least gives us a good idea of how decrypters work, and we understand how crucial Bletchley was\u2014so crucial its existence was kept a secret for 30 years.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/enigma-2002|title=Enigma Movie Review & Film Summary (2002) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref> On the other end, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was far less impressed, saying, 'The legend of how the British cracked the almighty Enigma must have sounded, on paper, like a nifty mathematical thriller\u2014a historic WarGames set at the formative moment of the computer age. On screen, however, Enigma plays as if the scriptwriter, Tom Stoppard, and the director, Michael Apted, were themselves cryptographers; they seem to be making [[hunt-and-peck]] stabs at how to translate a tale of arcane numeric formulas into drama.'<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2002/05/03/enigma|title=Enigma |magazine=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe film grossed $6.6 million in the United Kingdom.

There goes the war\u2026\u201d\nOf course Jericho is a totally fictional character, given that Turing was homosexual and only had a platonic relationship with his short-lived fianc\u00e9 [[Joan Clarke]], who knew about his sexual orientation. In reality it was unlikely that Turing was involved in code-breaking the Naval four-rotor Enigma Shark in 1943. Notes by [[Tony Sale]] do not mention Turing as the \"someone in Bletchley Park [who] realised that Short Weather Signals were sent in the three wheel mode\" and explained \"the Central Met. Station had collated the U-Boat and other reports, [and] they broadcast a general synoptic in their own Met. Code\", which used the standard International Met. Code further encoded using bigram tables, as discovered by Mr Archer from the Met. section of Bletchley Park.<ref>[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/navenigma/navenig9.htm ''Breaking Shark on the Short Weather Signals'' - The Breaking of German Naval Enigma by Tony Sale] Retrieved 25 November 2017</ref> According to [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], from June 1943 Joan Clarke, Mahon, Pendered and Noskwith were responsible for the whole of the cryptographic work until the end of the war.<ref>[http://www.turing.org.uk/book/update/part5.html ''Update to Alan Turing: the Enigma by Andrew Hodges Part 5: Running Up'', Turing.org] Retrieved 25 November 2017</ref> Strangely, Joan Clarke is not present in the film as none of the team of [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] are female.\n\nIn the film, Cave, from Naval Intelligence, played by [[Matthew Macfadyen]], mentioned Fasson and Grazier gave their lives to rescue the code books from a sinking submarine. There were actually three men who retrieved the books: [[Tony Fasson|First Lieutenant Anthony Fasson]], [[Colin Grazier|Able Seaman Colin Grazier]] and 16-year-old [[Tommy Brown (NAAFI assistant)|Tommy Brown]] from the canteen. Fasson and Grazier did drown while attempting to retrieve electrical equipment from a U-boat [[German submarine U-559|U-559]] (which Cave describes as its four-rotor enigma) on 30 October 1942, while Brown survived only to die in a house fire during shore-leave before the end of the war.<ref>[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/navenigma/navenig8.htm ''The Documents recovered from U559 - at a price'', The Breaking of German Naval Enigma by Tony Sale] Retrieved 25 November 2017</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/enigma-code-u-boat-u559-hms-petard-sebag-montefiori ''The boarding of U-559 changed the war \u2013 now both sides tell their story'', The Guardian, 21 Oct 2017] Retrieved 25 November 2017</ref><ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/teen-who-rescued-enigma-codes-9707940 ''Teen who rescued Enigma codes from sinking sub died in house fire without knowing the significance of his bravery'', The Mirror, 27 Jan 2017] Retrieved 25 November 2017</ref> Fasson and Grazier were awarded the [[George Cross]] posthumously and Brown was awarded the [[George Medal]].<ref name=NAVAL_ENIGMA>[https://uboat.net/technical/enigma_breaking.htm ''Allied Breaking of Naval Enigma'', uboat.net] Retrieved 25 November 2017</ref> Fictional character Cave states he was completing his last posting on a destroyer, in November '42, when the books were acquired.\n\nThere are historical records of the break in the ability of the British to decode the Naval enigma from 10 to 19 March 1943 when the third edition of the weather short signal codebook was deployed.<ref name=NAVAL_ENIGMA />\n\nThe [[Katyn massacre]], revealed after the discovery of mass graves of 4,500 Polish officers as depicted in the film, is a historical atrocity committed by Stalinist Russia in 1940.
