It is the second installment in the [[American Pie Presents (film series)|''American Pie Presents'' film series]], a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' franchise]]. [[John White (actor)|John White]] stars as Erik Stifler, a high school senior given a [[wikt:hall pass|hall pass]] from his girlfriend ([[Jessy Schram]]) who visits his cousin ([[Steve Talley]]) to run a mile naked. [[Christopher McDonald]] co-stars as Erik's father and [[Eugene Levy]] plays family friend Noah Levenstein. It was followed by ''[[American Pie Presents: Beta House|Beta House]]'' (2007).\n\n''The Naked Mile'' was released [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] internationally on December&nbsp;12, 2006, and in the United States on December&nbsp;19, 2006. The film was a financial success, generating US$27.46 million in United States sales.\n\n== Plot ==\nErik Stifler, [[Steven Stifler|Steve]] and [[Matt Stifler]]'s cousin, fails to live up to the family name as he is about to graduate from [[high school]] a [[virgin]]. As the film opens, Erik feigns an illness so that he can stay home and [[masturbation|masturbate]]. His parents and grandmother unexpectedly walk in and are hit with Erik's [[semen]], causing his grandmother to die of a heart attack.\n\nErik's girlfriend of two years, Tracy, loves him but is not ready for sex. She suddenly decides she's now ready, inviting Erik to her house later to have sex for the first time. They are interrupted when her father comes downstairs for a [[nightcap (drink)|nightcap]]. Before Tracy's father can catch him, a naked Erik flees from the [[clothes dryer|dryer]], in which he defecated while hiding there.\n\nErik's friends Cooze and Ryan plan a [[road trip]] to visit Erik's cousin Dwight Stifler at the [[University of Michigan]] for an event known as the Naked Mile. Tracy sees this as an opportunity to give Erik a sex pass, hoping that he can quench his lustful desires.\n\nAs soon as Erik and his friends arrive on campus, they witness a drinking contest where Dwight is crowned champion. Later, they lose a rough game of [[American football|football]] against a bitter rival [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] composed almost entirely of [[Dwarfism|midgets]]. Later at a bar, Erik meets a college girl named Brandi who has a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for virgins, prompting Ryan and Cooze to make a bet regarding whether or not Erik will sleep with her.\n\nThe following morning, Dwight gets attacked by the midget fraternity while walking down the street, landing him in the hospital. However, he manages to make it to the Naked Mile where he joins up with Erik, Ryan, and Cooze. At first they are reluctant to run, but when Brandi, Jill, and Alexis strip down stark naked, they are finally prompted to strip down as well. Finally as Erik and Brandi reach the finish line, they share a kiss which is caught on camera for a TV news report. Watching the report about the Naked Mile at home, Tracy is upset and feels guilty that she allowed Erik the pass. Her friends convince her to also lose her virginity before he gets back.\n\nLater that evening, Erik realizes that he loves Tracy, so confesses to Brandi that he cannot sleep with her, and rushes back to see his girlfriend. When he gets to her house, Tracy's dad says she is at a party. Erik rides her horse to the party, pounds on the closed bedroom door and proclaims his love for her. However, Tracy is not in the room because she had decided that she could not go through with her plans. They reconcile and have sex.\n\nWhen Erik returns to the Beta house to pick up his friends the next morning, each guy shares stories of his sexual experiences from the night before. The guys then ask him if he \"sealed the deal\" with Brandi that night, and when Erik tells them no, Ryan pays up on the bet to Cooze. Erik tells them about his adventure back home to make up with Tracy and finally lose his virginity. The guys are proud of him for officially living up to the Stifler family name, and the three friends go home.\n\nDuring the post-Naked Mile party, Dwight spots Vicky, the girlfriend of the leader of the midget fraternity, Rock. She heads up to Dwight's room to have sex. Later, as the film closes, Dwight sends a [[DVD]] to Rock that reads, \"Payback's a bitch.\" It reveals Dwight and Vicky having sex to Rock's dismay.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[John White (actor)|John White]] as Erik Stifler\n* [[Steve Talley]] as Dwight Stifler\n* [[Jessy Schram]] as Tracy Sterling\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Noah Levenstein \n* [[Ross Thomas (actor)|Ross Thomas]] as Ryan Grimm\n* [[Jake Siegel]] as Mike \"Cooze\" Coozeman\n* [[Christopher McDonald]] as Harry Stifler\n* [[Jordan Prentice]] as Rock\n* Maria Ricossa as Mrs. Stifler\n* [[Candace Kroslak]] as Brandy\n* Mika Winkler as Vicky\n* [[Dan Petronijevic]] as Bull\n* [[Jaclyn A.
