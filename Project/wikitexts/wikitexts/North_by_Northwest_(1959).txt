As advertising executive Roger Thornhill summons the same waiter, he is mistaken for Kaplan, kidnapped by the thugs, and brought to the estate of Lester Townsend. He is interrogated by spy Phillip Vandamm, a Cold War enemy of the United States, who poses as Townsend to Thornhill. Vandamm arranges Thornhill's death in a staged drunk-driving accident. Thornhill survives, but fails to convince his mother and the police of what happened, even after revisiting Townsend's estate. During the visit, Thornhill learns Townsend is a United Nations diplomat.\n\nThornhill and his mother go to Kaplan's empty hotel room. After Thornhill answers Kaplan's phone, the thugs, who had called the number from the lobby, begin their pursuit. Thornhill heads to the U.N. [[United Nations General Assembly Building|General Assembly Building]] to meet Townsend, who is a different man from Vandamm. One of the pursuing thugs throws a knife, killing Townsend, who collapses in Thornhill's arms. Thornhill is photographed as he grabs the knife, giving the appearance that he is the murderer; he then flees, attempting to find the real Kaplan. An unnamed government intelligence agency realizes that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan, but decides against rescuing him for fear of compromising their operation: Kaplan is a non-existent agent they created to confuse and distract Vandamm.\n\n[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (8).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Thornhill stopping a truck while being attacked by the crop duster, from the film trailer]]\nThornhill boards the ''[[20th Century Limited]]'' train to Chicago, where he meets Eve Kendall, who hides him from the police. The two establish a relationship\u2014on Kendall's part because she is secretly working with Vandamm\u2013and she tells Thornhill that she has arranged a meeting with Kaplan at an isolated rural bus stop. Thornhill waits there but is attacked by a crop duster plane. After trying to hide in a cornfield, he steps in front of a speeding tank truck; it brakes, and the airplane crashes into it, allowing him to escape.\n\nThornhill reaches Kaplan's hotel in Chicago and learns that Kaplan had checked out before the time when Kendall claimed she talked to him. Thornhill goes to her room and confronts her, but she leaves. He tracks her to an art auction, where he finds Vandamm purchasing a Mexican [[Pur\u00e9pecha]] statue. Vandamm leaves his thugs to deal with Thornhill; in order to escape, Thornhill disrupts the auction until police are called to remove him. He says he is the fugitive murderer, but they release him to the government agency's chief, \"The Professor\", who reveals that Kaplan was invented to distract Vandamm from the real government agent: Eve Kendall. Thornhill agrees to help maintain her cover.\n\nAt the [[Mount Rushmore]] visitor center, Thornhill\u2014now willingly playing the role of Kaplan\u2014negotiates Vandamm's turnover of Kendall to be arrested. Kendall then shoots Thornhill, seemingly fatally, and flees; it turns out her gun was loaded with blanks. Afterward, the Professor arranges for Thornhill and Kendall to meet. Thornhill learns Kendall must depart on a plane with Vandamm and his henchman Leonard. He tries to dissuade her from going but is knocked unconscious and locked in a hospital room. Thornhill escapes the Professor's custody and goes to Vandamm's house to rescue Kendall.\n\n[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (28).jpg|thumb|right|The climax at Mount Rushmore]]\nAt the house, Thornhill overhears that the sculpture holds microfilm and that Leonard has discovered the blanks remaining in Kendall's gun. Vandamm indicates that he will kill Kendall by throwing her from the plane. Thornhill manages to warn her with a surreptitious note. Vandamm, Leonard, and Kendall head for the plane. As Vandamm boards, Kendall takes the sculpture and runs to the pursuing Thornhill. They flee to the top of Mount Rushmore. As they climb down the mountain they are pursued by Vandamm's thugs, including Leonard, who is fatally shot by a park ranger. Vandamm is taken into custody by the Professor.\n\nMeanwhile, Kendall is hanging on to the mountain by her fingertips. Thornhill reaches down to pull her up, at which point the scene cuts to him pulling her\u2014now the new Mrs. Thornhill\u2014into an upper berth on a train, which enters a tunnel. \n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Roger Thornhill\n* [[Eva Marie Saint]] as Eve Kendall\n* [[James Mason]] as Phillip Vandamm\n* [[Jessie Royce Landis]] as Clara Thornhill\n* [[Leo G.

He speculated that the film could be called ''The Man in Lincoln's Nose'' (Lehman's version is that it was ''The Man on Lincoln's Nose<ref name=\"brady201\">{{Harvnb|Brady|1981|p=201}}</ref>'') or even ''The Man Who Sneezed in Lincoln's Nose''. Hitchcock sat on the idea, waiting for the right screenwriter to develop it. The original traveling salesman character had been suited to [[James Stewart]], but Lehman changed it to a Madison Avenue advertising executive, a position that he had formerly held.<ref name=\"engel\">{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Joel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ2ZAAAAQBAJ|title=Screenwriters on Screen-Writing: The Best in the Business Discuss Their Craft|publisher=Hyperion|year=1995|isbn=978-0786880577|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n[[John Russell Taylor]]'s 1978 biography ''Hitch: The Life and Times of Alfred Hitchcock'' suggests that the story originated after a spell of writer's block during the scripting of another film project:\n{{Blockquote | style=font-size:100% | Alfred Hitchcock had agreed to do a film for MGM and they had chosen an adaptation of the novel ''[[The Wreck of the Mary Deare]]'' by [[Hammond Innes]]. Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] had recommended that Hitchcock work with his friend [[Ernest Lehman]]. After a couple of weeks, Lehman offered to quit saying he didn't know what to do with the story. Hitchcock told him they got along great together and they would just write something else. Lehman said that he wanted to make the ultimate Hitchcock film. Hitchcock thought for a moment then said he had always wanted to do a chase across [[Mount Rushmore]]. Lehman and Hitchcock spitballed more ideas: a murder at the United Nations Headquarters; a murder at a car plant in Detroit; a final showdown in Alaska. Eventually they settled on the U.N. murder for the opening and the chase across Mount Rushmore for the climax. For the central idea, Hitchcock remembered something an American journalist had told him about spies creating a fake agent as a decoy. Perhaps their hero could be mistaken for this fictitious agent and end up on the run. They bought the idea from the journalist for $10,000.}}\n\nLehman repeated this story in the documentary ''[[Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest]]'' that accompanied the 2001 DVD release of the film. Screenwriter [[William Goldman]] insists in ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'' (2000) that it was Lehman who created ''North by Northwest'' and that many of Hitchcock's ideas were not used. Hitchcock had the idea of the hero being stranded in the middle of nowhere but suggested that the villains try to kill him with a [[tornado]]. \"But ''they're'' trying to kill him. How are ''they'' going to work up a cyclone?\" Lehman responded. \"I just can't tell you who said what to whom, but somewhere during that afternoon, the cyclone in the sky became the crop-duster plane.\"<ref name=\"brady202\">{{Harvnb|Brady|1981|p=202}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, Hitchcock had been working on the story for nearly nine years prior to meeting Lehman.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} [[Otis Guernsey]] was the American journalist who had the idea which influenced Hitchcock, inspired by a true story during [[World War II]] when [[British Intelligence]] obtained a dead body, invented a [[Operation Mincemeat#Major William Martin, Royal Marines|fictitious officer]] who was carrying secret papers, and arranged for the body and misleading papers to be discovered by the Germans as a disinformation scheme called [[Operation Mincemeat]]. Guernsey turned his idea into a story about an American salesman who travels to the Middle East and is mistaken for a fictitious agent, becoming \"saddled with a romantic and dangerous identity\". Guernsey admitted that his treatment was full of \"corn\" and \"lacking logic\", and he urged Hitchcock to do what he liked with the story. Hitchcock bought the 60 pages for $10,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} In an interview in the book ''Screenwriters on Screenwriting'' (1995), Lehman stated that he had already written much of the screenplay before coming up with critical elements of the climax. An example of the \"corn\" in the finished screenplay was the scene wherein Roger Thornhill returns to the Townsend estate with the detectives to find everything changed. If Thornhill was indeed a spy, he would have had no reason to return to the estate after his escape the previous night, nor would the criminals be expecting him to return as they obviously did. \n\nThis was the only Hitchcock film released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Since 1986, it has been owned by Turner Entertainment, as part of the pre-1986 MGM film library that it acquired through temporary ownership of MGM.\n\nProduction costs on ''North by Northwest'' were seriously escalated when a delay in filming put Cary Grant into the penalty phase of his contract, resulting in an additional $5,000 per day in fees for him before shooting even began.<ref name=\"spoto405\">{{Cite book|last=Spoto|first=Donald|url=https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/405|title=The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock|publisher=Da Capo|year=1999|isbn=978-0-306-80932-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/darksideofgenius00spot_0/page/405 405]}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Eva Marie Saint|Eva Marie Saint's]] agent had told her that she had received an invitation to a dinner with Alfred Hitchcock and his family, the first time she and Hitchcock met.

In his book-length interview ''Hitchcock/Truffaut'' (1967) with [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], Hitchcock said that he wanted to do \"something fun, light-hearted, and generally free of the symbolism permeating his other movies.\"<ref>Hitchcock was not above inserting a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] joke as the last shot, which, notably, eluded contemporary censors.</ref> Writer Ernest Lehman has also mocked those who look for symbolism in the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brady|1981|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref> Despite its popular appeal, the film is considered to be a masterpiece for its themes of [[deception]], [[mistaken identity]], and [[moral relativism]] in the [[Cold War]] era.\n\nThe title ''North by Northwest'' is a subject of debate. Many have seen it{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} as having been taken from a line (\"I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw\") in ''[[Hamlet]]'', a work also concerned with the shifty nature of reality.<ref>Act II, Scene ii.

Lehman states that he used a working title for the film of ''In a Northwesterly Direction'' because the film's action was to begin in New York and climax in Alaska. Then the head of the story department at MGM suggested ''North by Northwest'', but this was still to be a working title. Other titles were considered, including ''The Man on Lincoln's Nose'', but ''North by Northwest'' was kept because, according to Lehman, \"We never did find a [better] title.\"<ref name=\"brady201\" /> The [[Northwest Airlines]] reference in the film plays on the title.\n\nThe film's plot involves a \"[[MacGuffin]]\"\u2014a term popularized by Hitchcock\u2014which is a physical object that everyone in the film is chasing, but which has no deep relationship to the plot. Late in ''North by Northwest'', it emerges that the spies are attempting to smuggle [[Microform|microfilm]] containing government secrets out of the country.
