It is based very loosely on a short story called \"Twenty Minutes\" by [[James Salter]].\n\nThe film is set in an East Coast boys [[boarding school]], and was shot in [[Baltimore]] and on the campus of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]].\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Baker Jr. ([[Lukas Haas]]) is a boy bored with his life at an [[upper middle class]] boarding school, and the prospect of his future running the family [[grocery store]] chain. He no longer sees the point in school, stating what's the difference if he gets a zero attendance for being three minutes late or skipping the whole class so he might as well skip the class. Now close to graduating from boarding school, his life is turned upside down when he rescues Patty Vare ([[Winona Ryder]]), a young woman he finds lying unconscious in a field.  Patty regains consciousness that evening in John's dormitory.  She stays awake long enough to tell him she will not go to a doctor, and then passes out and does not awaken until the next morning. She seems to recover completely and to be grateful for John's assistance; the two begin a romantic voyage of self-discovery. This is not without its problems, as other boys in the dorm quickly find out she is being hidden in his room, leading up to a dramatic confrontation with Baker's close friends where his 'best friend' becomes enraged and punches a wall, breaking his hand, while the two continue to argue over the reason as to why Baker has hidden her in his room.\n\nThroughout the film, there are continuous [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s of Vare's past, showing her with a famous [[baseball]] player with whom she steals a car, leading up to a drunken car crash and his death (for which authorities are searching for Vare for questioning). By the end, Vare has admitted all this to Baker and informed the authorities of the location of the body and the car (as they crashed into a river). At the police station, both Baker and Vare begin to say goodbye when they unexpectedly jump into an elevator to escape from Baker's controlling father ([[Chris Cooper]]), and drive off with a car he had earlier stolen from the school.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Patty Vare\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as John Baker, Jr.\n* [[Wiley Wiggins]] as John Phillips\n* [[John C.

[[Terrence Rafferty]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote, \"''Boys'', subjected to self-fulfilling negative buzz, has received lukewarm-to-terrible reviews and has done no business. It deserves better. [...] Cochran is too eccentric to make a conventional comedy, yet unfortunately (in marketing terms), her style is too subtle and uninsistent to place her among the aggressively hip, genre-bending filmmakers of the Tarantino generation. The funny thing is, this young filmmaker may have a more deeply subversive sensibility than any of her celebrated peers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1996-05-27#folio=CV1|title=The New Yorker Digital Edition : May 27, 1996|website=archives.newyorker.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref> ''Boys'' holds a rating of 15% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 27 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1071409-boys | title=Boys | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref>\n\n==Official soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack to the film was released on April 9, 1996.\n# \"She's Not There\" - [[The Cruel Sea (band)|Cruel Sea]]\n# \"Alright\" - [[Cast (band)|Cast]]\n# \"Gotta Know Right Now\" - [[Smoking Popes]]\n# \"Honeysimple\" - [[Scarce (band)|Scarce]]\n# \"Wildwood\" (Sheared Wood Mix) - [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], remixed by [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]]\n# \"Colored Water\" - [[Orbit (American band)|Orbit]]\t\n# \"Sad & Beautiful World\" - [[Sparklehorse]]\n# \"Fading Fast\" - [[Kelly Willis]] \t\n# \"Tell Her This\" - [[Del Amitri]]\n# \"If I Didn't Love You\" - [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] \t\n# \"Inside\" - Slider\n# \"Wait for the Sun\" - [[Supergrass]]\t\n# \"Belly Laugh\" - [[Compulsion (band)|Compulsion]]\n# \"[[Begging You]]\" - [[The Stone Roses]]\n# \"Evade Chums\" - [[Stewart Copeland]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0115742|Boys}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1071409-boys}}\n* {{mojo title|boys|Boys}}\n\n{{Stacy Cochran}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stacy Cochran]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Baltimore]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:PolyGram Filmed Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Peter Frankfurt]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stewart Copeland]]\n[[Category:1996 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
