The film stars [[Jack Nicholson]] who plays a new patient at a mental institution alongside [[Louise Fletcher]] who plays an austere nurse. It also features a supporting cast of [[Will Sampson]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Sydney Lassick]], [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]], as well as [[Christopher Lloyd]] and [[Brad Dourif]] in their film debuts.\n\nFilming began in January 1975 and lasted three months, taking place on location in [[Salem, Oregon]], and the surrounding area, as well as [[Depoe Bay]] on the north [[Oregon]] coast. The producers decided to shoot the film in the [[Oregon State Hospital]], an actual mental hospital, as this was also the setting of the novel. The hospital is still in operation (as of 2022), though the original buildings seen in the film have been demolished. The film released on November 19, 1975. Considered by many to be one of the [[list of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]], ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' is No. 33 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years... 100 Movies]] list.\n\nThe film was the second to [[List of Big Five Academy Award winners and nominees|win all five major]] [[Academy Award]]s ([[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Actor in Lead Role]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Actress in Lead Role]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Screenplay]]) following ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' in 1934, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 with ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. It also won numerous [[Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Awards]]. In 1993, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[autumn]] of 1963, [[Randle McMurphy]] is on an [[Oregon]] [[work farm]] for the [[statutory rape]] of a 15-year-old girl. He [[Malingering|pretends to be mentally insane]] in order to get himself transferred to a mental institution and avoid [[hard labor]]. The ward is dominated by head nurse [[Nurse Ratched|Mildred Ratched]], a cold, [[passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive]] tyrant who intimidates her patients.\n\nThe other patients include young, anxious, [[stuttering]] Billy Bibbit; Charlie Cheswick, who is prone to temper tantrums; delusional, child-like Martini; the articulate, repressed homosexual Dale Harding; belligerent and profane Max Taber; [[epileptic]]s Jim Sefelt and Bruce Fredrickson; quiet but violent-minded Scanlon; tall, deaf-mute [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] \"Chief\" Bromden; and several others with chronic conditions.\n\nRatched sees McMurphy's lively, rebellious presence as a threat to her authority, which she responds to by confiscating and rationing the patients' cigarettes and suspending their card-playing privileges. McMurphy finds himself in a battle of wills against Ratched. He steals a school bus, escaping with several patients to go fishing on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Coast and encouraging them to discover their own abilities and find self-confidence.\n\nAfter an [[orderly]] tells him that the judge's sentence does not apply to people who are deemed to be criminally insane, McMurphy makes plans to escape, encouraging Chief Bromden to throw a [[hydrotherapy]] console through a window. It is also revealed that McMurphy, Chief and Taber are the only non-chronic patients involuntarily committed to the institution; the rest of them are self-committed and could leave at any time, but are too afraid to do so. After Cheswick bursts into a fit and demands his cigarettes, which had been rationed by Ratched, McMurphy fights with the orderlies, and Chief intervenes.\n\nRatched sends Chief, Cheswick, and McMurphy to the \"shock shop\" as a result of this insubordination. While awaiting their punishment, McMurphy offers Chief a stick of [[chewing gum|gum]], and discovers he can speak and hear, having feigned his deaf-muteness to avoid engaging with anyone. After being subjected to [[electroconvulsive therapy]], McMurphy returns to the ward pretending to be brain damaged, but then reveals that the treatment has made him even more determined to defeat Ratched. McMurphy and Chief make plans to escape, but decide to throw a secret [[Christmas]] party for their friends after Ratched and the orderlies leave for the night.\n\nMcMurphy sneaks two prostitutes, Candy and Rose, and bottles of alcohol into the ward; he bribes guard Turkle to allow this. After the party, McMurphy and Chief prepare to escape, inviting Billy to come with them. Billy refuses, but asks for a \"date\" with Candy; McMurphy arranges for him to have sex with her. McMurphy and the others get drunk, and McMurphy falls asleep instead of making his escape with Chief.\n\nRatched arrives in the morning to find the ward in disarray and most of the patients passed out. She discovers Billy and Candy together, and aims to embarrass Billy in front of everyone. Billy manages to overcome his stutter and stands up to Ratched. When she threatens to tell his mother, Billy cracks under the pressure and reverts to stuttering. Ratched has him placed in the doctor's office. Moments later, McMurphy punches an orderly when trying to escape out of a window with the Chief, causing the other orderlies to intervene. Meanwhile, Billy commits suicide by slitting his throat with broken glass. Ratched tries to ease the situation by calling for the day's routine to continue as usual, and an enraged McMurphy strangles Ratched. The orderlies subdue McMurphy, saving Ratched's life.\n\nSome time later, Ratched is wearing a neck brace and speaking with a weak voice, and Harding now leads the now-unsuspended card-playing. McMurphy is nowhere to be found, leading to rumors that he has escaped. Later that night, Chief sees McMurphy being returned to his bed. He greets him, elated that McMurphy had kept his promise not to escape without him, but notices McMurphy is unresponsive and physically limp, and discovers [[lobotomy]] scars on his forehead. Chief tearfully hugs McMurphy and says, \"You're coming with me,\" before smothering him to death with a pillow. He then lifts the hydrotherapy console off the floor, smashes it through the window gates, and escapes alone (thus being the \u201cone\u201d who \u201cflew over the cuckoo\u2019s nest\u201d), all while the remaining inmates, having been woken up by the glass breaking noise, watch and cheer him on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Randle McMurphy|Randle Patrick \"R.P.\" McMurphy]]\n* [[Louise Fletcher]] as [[Nurse Ratched|Nurse Mildred Ratched]]\n* [[Will Sampson]] as \"Chief\" Bromden\n* [[William Redfield (actor)|William Redfield]] as Dale Harding\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Billy Bibbit\n* [[Sydney Lassick]] as Charlie Cheswick\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Max Taber\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Martini\n* [[Dean Brooks]] as Dr. John Spivey\n* [[William Duell]] as Jim Sefelt\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Bruce Frederickson\n* [[Michael Berryman]] as Ellis\n* Alonzo Brown as Attendant Miller\n* Mwako Cumbaka as Attendant Warren\n* [[Nathan George]] as Attendant Washington\n* [[Mews Small|Marya Small]] as Candy\n* [[Scatman Crothers]] as Night Guard Turkle\n* [[Phil Roth]] as Woolsey\n* [[Louisa Moritz]] as Rose\n* [[Peter Brocco]] as Col.

While screening ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974) to see if she was right for the role, he became interested in [[Louise Fletcher]], who had a supporting role, for the role of Nurse Ratched. A mutual acquaintance, the casting director [[Fred Roos]], had already mentioned Fletcher's name as a possibility.

However, Forman said he had terminated Wexler's services over artistic differences.

On the score, reviewer Steven McDonald: {{cquote|The edgy nature of the film extends into the score, giving it a profoundly disturbing feel at times{{endash}}even when it appears to be relatively normal.
