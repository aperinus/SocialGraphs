The film is based on [[John Updike]]'s 1984 [[The Witches of Eastwick|novel of the same name]], telling the story of three women who are unaware of the power of the words they speak; as they tell each other their deepest desires, a man arrives just in time and fulfills them, but has a dark side of his own.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nAlexandra Medford, Jane Spofford, and Sukie Ridgemont are three dissatisfied women living in picturesque Eastwick, [[Rhode Island]]. Sculptor Alex is a single mother of one, newly divorced music teacher Jane can't have children, and Sukie has six and is a columnist for the newspaper ''Eastwick Word''. The friends lost their husbands (Alex's died, Jane's divorced her, and Sukie's abandoned her). Unaware of being witches, they unwittingly form a [[coven]], meeting weekly to discuss ideal men.\n\nA mysterious man buys the town's landmark property, the Lenox Mansion. His arrival fascinates everyone except Felicia Alden, the devoutly religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden, Sukie's boss. She senses he (whose name is easily forgotten) is ill-intentioned.\n\nOne night, at Jane's recital he appears, makes a spectacle, leading to more gossip. After, receiving flowers from ''D'' sparks Sukie's memory, his name is Daryl Van Horne. Chaos over the name spreads through the crowd, her bead necklace inexplicably breaks. Falling to the floor, it causes Felicia (who had mocked his name) to fall down stairs, breaking her leg.\n\nThe next day, Daryl seduces Alex. He says insensitive, disgusting, and rude things whenever he speaks. Appalled, she tells him off, refuses his advances and begins to walk out. Before she opens the door, he manipulates her emotions until she eventually agrees. The next morning, Daryl visits the shy and insecure Jane. They sit and politely converse, as she explains the Lenox Mansion was built on a site where witches were executed. Later that night, Daryl encourages Jane to play her cello with wild abandon, playing increasingly fast while accompanied by him on piano, until the strings emit smoke, the cello catches fire, and Jane passionately flings herself upon him.\n\nThe following week, Daryl invites all three over, now seeking Sukie. Envy and rivalry emerge among them, they inadvertently levitate a tennis ball. Now aware of their magical abilities, the women agree to share Daryl. As the women spend more time at Daryl's mansion, Felicia spreads rumors about their indecency, turning the trio into social outcasts. As the witches begin to question their loyalty to Daryl, he causes them to unknowingly cast a spell against Felicia. Later that night, while ranting to her husband about Daryl being the Devil, she begins to vomit cherry pits. Horrified by her uncontrollable behavior, Clyde kills her with a fire poker.\n\nAfter Felicia's death, the trio, fearing their powers, agree to avoid each other and Daryl until the situation stabilizes. Upset at being abandoned, he awakens their worst fears. Alex thinks she's covered with snakes; Jane rapidly ages; and Sukie has sudden, agonizing pain. Realizing they can only remove Daryl through witchcraft, they reunite with him, pretending to make amends. They all also discover they are pregnant.\n\nThe next morning, the trio send Daryl on an errand while Alex uses wax and his hair to create a [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] doll of him that they harm, hoping he will leave. As the spell takes effect, Daryl \u2013 still in town \u2013 is hit by a sudden wind and begins to feel excruciating pain (each event corresponding to something the women do to the doll). He hides inside a church from the wind and finds it full of worshippers. Realizing the source of his troubles, he rants about the women, cursing them as a group before vomiting cherry pits as Felicia did. Enraged, Daryl races home to punish the witches for their betrayal. Unsure if the voodoo has affected him, they attempt to behave normally, only to be shocked when he enters the mansion disheveled, incoherent, and seeking revenge.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, the doll breaks into pieces. This causes Daryl to transform to a large, monstrous form that attempts to shake the mansion apart and starts a fire. The witches then toss it into the fire, causing Daryl to change into a shriveled homunculus and vanish.\n\nEighteen months later, the women are living together in Daryl's mansion, each with a new baby son (each shares his mother's hair color). The boys are playing together when Daryl appears on a wall filled with video screens, inviting them to \"give Daddy a kiss\". Before they can, the ladies appear and switch off the televisions, to his chagrin.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Daryl Van Horne\n* [[Cher]] as Alexandra Medford<ref name=vulture>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/the-witches-of-eastwick-30-years-later.html|title=The Witches of Eastwick Is a Fascinating Movie to Watch Post-Weinstein|last=Chaney|first=Jen|date=30 October 2017|website=www.vulture.com|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Jane Spofford<ref name=vulture/>\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Sukie Ridgemont<ref name=vulture/>\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Felicia Alden\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Clyde Alden\n* Keith Jochim as Walter Neff\n* Becca Lish as Mrs. Neff\n* [[Carel Struycken]] as Fidel\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Differences from novel==\nWhile the film follows the basic structure of the novel, several major developments are dropped, with the book being darker in tone. The setting of both is Rhode Island, but the novel sets the time during the early 1970s. In the novel, Daryl is more [[Devil in Christianity|devil]]-like: less of an enabler and more of a selfish, perverse predator and architect of mayhem.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/13/books/updike-witches.html Books: ''The Witches of Eastwick'' Review by Margaret Atwood, May 13, 1984. ''The New York Times''.]</ref> Also, the film omits a key episode in the book, where Daryl unexpectedly marries a young, innocent girl named Jenny, and the jealous three witches magically cause her to die of [[cancer]]. None of the three witches gets pregnant and at the end Daryl flees town with Jenny's younger brother, Chris, apparently his lover. Also in the book Alexandra's last name was Spofford, not Medford and Jane was Jane Smart, not Jane Spofford, and Sukie was Rougemont not Ridgemont. There are differences in their hair and build too; Alexandra is plump and Sukie is the redhead.\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nJack Nicholson expressed interest in playing the role of Daryl through his then-girlfriend [[Anjelica Huston]], after hearing that the original actor for the role, [[Bill Murray]], had dropped out.<ref>{{cite web |last=Locke |first=Greg W. |title=The Top 25 Roles Bill Murray Didn't Take |date=26 August 2011 |url=http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/ |access-date=25 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125110247/http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/ |archive-date=November 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Bradford |date=17 February 2011 |title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray |url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray |archive-date=May 20, 2015 |access-date=25 May 2015 |website=[[SplitSider]] |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Huston was in the running for the role of Alexandra Medford, and screen-tested opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, who had already been cast as Sukie, and [[Amy Madigan]], who was being considered for the role of Jane.
