The film grossed $45 million at the domestic box office and $66 million worldwide. Initial critical reception was negative due to its excessive violence, profanity, and graphic drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers.

The four are released and given [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green cards]] in exchange for murdering a former Cuban general at the request of Miami drug lord Frank Lopez. They find work as dishwashers at a restaurant, but a dissatisfied Tony proclaims that he is meant for bigger things.\n\nFrank's right-hand man, Omar Suarez, sends the four to purchase [[cocaine]] from [[Colombia]]n dealers. Tony and Angel are captured at gunpoint, and Tony is forced to watch Angel being dismembered with a chainsaw before Manny and Chi-Chi rescue him. The three kill the Colombians and personally deliver the recovered drugs and money to Frank, suspecting that Omar set them up.\n\nDuring their meeting, Tony becomes attracted to Frank's [[trophy wife]], [[Elvira Hancock|Elvira]]. Tony and Manny begin working for Frank. Later, Tony visits his mother and younger sister Gina, the latter of whom he is overprotective of. Disgusted by his life of crime, his mother throws him out. Manny is attracted to Gina, but Tony tells him to stay away from her.\n\nFrank sends Tony and Omar to [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia, to meet with cocaine kingpin [[Alejandro Sosa]]. During the meeting, Omar is unhappy when Tony negotiates a large deal without Frank's approval. Sosa later has his men hang Omar from a helicopter, telling Tony that he was a police [[informant]] and that Frank has poor judgment. Tony vouches for Frank's organization; Sosa takes a liking to Tony and agrees to the deal, but warns Tony never to betray him.\n\nSeeing that Frank is infuriated by Omar's death and the size of the deal with Sosa, Tony sets up an independent cocaine operation. Mel Bernstein, a corrupt police detective on Frank's payroll, accosts Tony at a nightclub and attempts to extort money from him in return for police protection. Tony spots Gina fraternizing with a man and beats them both when he sees him grope her. Hitmen then attempt to kill Tony, who escapes with a bullet wound. He confronts Frank and Bernstein, certain that they orchestrated the attack; Frank confesses his involvement at gunpoint and begs for his life, but Tony has Manny shoot him dead before proceeding to kill Bernstein. Tony marries Elvira and becomes the distributor of Sosa's product, using his profits to build a multi-million-dollar business empire and construct a large, heavily-guarded estate.\n\nIn 1983, a [[money laundering]] sting operation by federal agents results in Tony being charged with [[tax evasion]] and facing a prison sentence. Sosa offers to use his government connections to keep Tony out of prison, but only if Tony helps kill an activist intending to expose Sosa's drug operations. During dinner at an upscale restaurant, Tony accuses Manny of causing his arrest and Elvira of being an infertile junkie, prompting Elvira to leave him.\n\nTony travels to [[New York City]] to carry out the assassination with Sosa's henchman, Alberto, nicknamed \"The Shadow\", who plants a radio-controlled bomb under the activist's car. However, when the activist is unexpectedly accompanied by his wife and children, a horrified Tony tries to call off the hit. Shadow refuses to back down, and Tony kills him before he can detonate the bomb. Tony returns to Miami, where an enraged Sosa calls him to promise retribution for allowing the activist to deliver the expos\u00e9. At his mother's behest, Tony tracks down Gina and finds her with Manny; in a fit of rage, Tony shoots Manny dead only to learn that Gina had just married him. A distraught Tony returns to his estate with Gina and begins a massive cocaine binge in his office.\n\nSosa's men begin to invade the grounds and kill Tony's guards as Gina enters the office, accusing him of wanting her for himself. She shoots and wounds him, but is killed by one of Sosa's men whom Tony kills in turn. Tony deploys a [[grenade launcher]]-equipped rifle against the invaders, killing many of them but suffering multiple gunshot wounds. He continues to taunt them until \"The Skull,\" Sosa's top lieutenant, climbs up to the office and fatally shoots him in the back. Tony falls off the balcony and lands in a pool, at the base of a statue bearing the motto \"The World Is Yours\" \u2013 a message Tony had earlier seen displayed on a blimp and taken as inspiration.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Tony Montana]]: a Cuban refugee who becomes a wealthy [[drug lord]] in [[Miami]]\n* [[Steven Bauer]] as [[List of Scarface characters#Manny Ribera|Manny Ray]]: Tony's friend and right-hand man\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Elvira Hancock|Elvira]]: Frank Lopez's wife, who later marries Tony Montana\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as Gina: Tony's sister, of whom he is overprotective\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Frank Lopez: a Miami drug lord who mentors Tony and Manny\n* [[M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n]] as Mama Montana: Tony's disapproving mother\n* [[F.
