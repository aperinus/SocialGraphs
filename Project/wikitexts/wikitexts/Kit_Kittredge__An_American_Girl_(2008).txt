The film focuses on the [[American Girl (company)|American Girl]] character [[Kit Kittredge]] ([[Abigail Breslin]]) who lives in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nIt is the first, and so far only, film in the [[American Girl films|''American Girl'' film series]] to have a theatrical release; the first three were [[television film]]s. As with the TV films, [[Julia Roberts]] served as one of the executive producers.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn June 1934, Kit Kittredge is determined to become a reporter, and she writes articles on the typewriter in her attic bedroom while drama unfolds on the floors beneath her. The mortgage on her house is about to be foreclosed because her father lost his [[Car dealerships in the United States|car dealership]] and couldn't keep up with the payments. He has gone to [[Chicago, Illinois]] to search for work, and to make some income her mother takes in an odd assortment of [[Boarding house|boarders]], including [[Magic (illusion)|magic]]ian Mr. Berk, dance instructor Miss Dooley, and [[Bookmobile|mobile library]] driver Miss Bond.\n\nLocally there have been reports of muggings and robberies supposedly committed by [[homeless|hobos]]. Kit investigates and meets young Will and Countee, who live in a hobo jungle near the [[Ohio River]] and [[Erie Lackawanna Railway]]. Kit writes a story about the camp and tries to sell it to Mr. Gibson, the mean editor of the Cincinnati newspaper, but he has no interest in the subject. At the same time, Kit adopts a dog, her mother buys chickens, and Kit sells their eggs.\n\nWhen a locked box containing her mother's treasures is stolen, a footprint with a star matching the one on Will's boot is discovered, making him the prime suspect. The sheriff goes to find Will and Countee, however, they have left the hobo jungle. Kit, Stirling and Ruthie then set out to investigate on the incidents and clear Will's name. It then turns out that Mr. Berk, along with two accomplices, were actually the ones behind the robberies, [[fall guy|framing]] Will and the rest of the homeless for the crime. Kit then becomes a local hero. Afterwards, Kit finds out that Countee has been [[crossdressing|pretending to be a boy]]. On Thanksgiving, the homeless bring food to Kit's mother and Kit's father returns home. Mr. Gibson arrives to show Kit that her article is in print in Cincinnati's major daily newspaper.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Abigail Breslin]] as Margaret Mildred 'Kit' Kittredge\n* [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Jack Kittredge\n* [[Julia Ormond]] as Margaret Kittredge\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Miss Lucinda Bond\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Mr. Jefferson Jasper Rene Berk\n* [[Max Thieriot]] as Will Shepherd\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as Miss May Dooley\n* [[Madison Davenport]] as Ruthie Smithens\n* [[Zach Mills]] as Stirling Howard IV\n* [[Austin MacDonald]] as Roger\n* [[Willow Smith]] as Countee (Constance)\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Gibson\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as Mrs. Howard\n* [[Colin Mochrie]] as Mr. Pennington\n* [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Uncle Hendrick\n* Brieanne Jansen as Frances Stone\n* Erin Hilgartner as Florence Stone\n* Martin Roach as Hobo Doctor\n* Elisabeth Perez as Classmate #1\n* Jordan Rackley as Classmate #2\n* Dylan Scott Smith as Frederich\n}}\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:1934ChryslerAirflow.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A fleet of vehicles were used in the film's car dealership scenes, among them a [[Chrysler Airflow]] driven by Jack Kittredge ([[Chris O'Donnell]]).]]\nIdeas of a possible feature film revolving around the character had been discussed by the company for several years,<ref name=\"kitproduction\">{{cite web|url=http://celebritywonder.ugo.com/movie/2008_Kit_Kittredge%3A_An_American_Girl_Mystery_about_the_production.html|title=Kit Kittredge: An American Girl Mystery: about the production|access-date=6 October 2012}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> although American Girl president Ellen L.

Camera angles were also put into consideration, with the film crew being careful not to shoot areas or objects on the set location that would be out of place in the 1930s setting. A [[multiple-camera setup]] was also used to speed up the process. Filming was done in and around [[Toronto]], and in [[Tottenham, Ontario]] in the summer of 2007.<ref name=\"toronto\">{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=e8cd5244-c1f1-4eb9-8f35-002959fe95a4&sponsor |title=Director surprises herself with Kit Kittredge |work=[[Postmedia News]] |access-date=12 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304215604/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=e8cd5244-c1f1-4eb9-8f35-002959fe95a4&sponsor |archive-date= 4 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe costume department made use of vintage photographs by [[Dorothea Lange]] and old [[Sears-Roebuck]] catalogues for creating the cast's Depression-era clothing. As the Kittredge family would spend less on extra clothing, the costumes were [[Distressing|distressed]] using [[sandpaper]] and [[trisodium phosphate]], fading the colors of the clothes to give a more aged, worn out feel.\n\nAmong some of the vehicles used in the film, several 1934 [[Chrysler Airflow]]s were used, one of which was driven by Kit's father.<ref name=\"chrisodonell\">{{cite web|url=http://grouchoreviews.com/interviews/249|title=Chris O'Donnell\u2014Kit Kittredge: An American Girl, Batman Forever|work=Groucho Reviews|access-date=7 October 2013}}</ref> Besides the Airflow, a green 1933 [[Plymouth (automobile)#Great Depression, 1940s and 1950s|Plymouth PC]] sedan and several [[:de:Dodge DP-Serie|1933 Dodge DP]]s were also used. The car lot was portrayed as a Chrysler-Plymouth-Dodge dealership in Cincinnati in 1934. An antique 'Peter Whit' Toronto Transit Commission street car stood in for a City of Cincinnati one.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe film received generally favorable reviews from critics.

Besides the simple educational value of giving them a picture to connect with their history lessons, the film also focuses on more significant themes than the materialism and prettiness championed.\"\n\nA less favorable review came from James Verniere of ''[[The Boston Herald]]'', calling the film \"one-dimensional\" and saying, \"I have no argument with the theme of empowerment aimed at an audience of girls. I do, however, take exception to a plot that is banal and predictable and performances that run the gamut from just OK to risible.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Paper doll; Kit Kittredge and co. present one-dimensional 'American Girl'|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2131107461.html#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510132548/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2131107461.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 May 2013|publisher=[[The Boston Herald]] {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}|access-date=21 October 2016|date=2 July 2008}}</ref> Josh Larsen of the Illinois paper ''The Sun'' also gave ''Kit'' a negative review, bemoaning the film's plot as condescending towards its target audience, stating, \"''Kit Kittredge: An American Girl'' would be the perfect movie for history-minded 6- to 9-year-olds if it wasn't aimed at the intellectual level of a toddler.\"<ref>{{cite web|title='American Girl' movie belittles young audiences|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-12206845B9C5E2F0.html#|publisher=The Sun (Naperville (IL)) {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}|access-date=9 May 2018|date=2 July 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== Home video release ==\n''Kit Kittredge: An American Girl'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on October 28, 2008, the only special feature being ''American Girl'' trailers.\n\nThe film was later released as part of a 4 disc set with 3 other ''American Girl'' films, including enhanced DVD-ROM features such as deleted scenes, an HBO look, a featurette on the casting, and a look at the 1930s.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Portal|Film|United States}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.kitkittredge.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{Mojo title}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n\n{{American Girl}}\n{{Patricia Rozema}}\n\n[[Category:American Girl films]]\n[[Category:2008 films]]\n[[Category:2008 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s children's drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's comedy films]]\n[[Category:American children's drama films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Children's comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about journalists]]\n[[Category:Films based on toys]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Patricia Rozema]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Julia Roberts]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1934]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cincinnati]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Great Depression films]]\n[[Category:HBO Films films]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:Picturehouse films]]"}]}}}}
