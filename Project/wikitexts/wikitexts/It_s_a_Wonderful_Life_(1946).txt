The [[prayer]]s of his family and friends reach [[Heaven]], where [[guardian angel]] [[Clarence Odbody]] is assigned to save George in order to earn his wings. Clarence is shown flashbacks of George's life. He watches 12-year-old George rescue his younger brother Harry from drowning, but become [[deaf]] in his left ear. Later, George prevents the [[pharmacist]], Mr. Gower, distraught over the death of his son, from accidentally poisoning a prescription.\n\nIn 1928, George plans a world tour before college. He is reintroduced to [[Mary Hatch]], who has been enamored with him since childhood. When his father dies suddenly, George postpones his travel to settle the family business, Bailey Brothers [[Building and Loan]]. Avaricious board member [[Henry F. Potter]], who controls most of the town, seeks to dissolve it, but the board votes to keep the Building and Loan open if George runs it. George acquiesces and works alongside his uncle, Billy, and gives his tuition to Harry with the understanding that Harry will run the business when he graduates.\n\nHarry returns from college married and with a job offer from his father-in-law, and George resigns himself to running the Building and Loan. George and Mary rekindle their relationship and are married. They witness a [[run on the bank]], and use their [[honeymoon]] savings to keep the Building and Loan solvent. Under George's leadership, the company establishes Bailey Park, a modern housing development surpassing Potter's overpriced [[slum]]s. Potter entices George with a job for $20,000 a year but, realizing that Potter's true intention is to close the Building and Loan, George rebuffs the offer.\n\nDuring World War II, George is [[Selective Service System#Classifications|ineligible for service]] because of his deaf ear but is active in the [[domestic war effort]]. On Christmas Eve 1945, the town prepares a hero's welcome for Harry, who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions as a [[U.S. Navy]] [[fighter pilot]] preventing a [[kamikaze]] attack on a troop transport. Billy goes to the bank to deposit $8,000 of the Building and Loan's cash. He taunts Potter with a newspaper headline about Harry, but absentmindedly wraps the envelope of cash in Potter's newspaper. Potter finds the money and keeps it, while Billy cannot recall how he misplaced it. With a bank examiner reviewing the company's records, George realizes scandal and criminal charges will follow. Fruitlessly retracing Billy's steps, George berates him and takes out his frustration on Mary and their kids. George appeals to Potter for a loan, offering his [[life insurance]] policy as collateral. Potter chastises George, refuses to help, and phones the police.\n\nGeorge flees Potter's office, gets drunk at a bar, and prays for help. Suicidal, he goes to a nearby bridge, but before he can jump, Clarence dives into the river and George rescues him. When George wishes he had never been born, Clarence shows George a timeline in which he never existed. Bedford Falls is now Pottersville, an unsavory town occupied by sleazy entertainment venues, crime, and callous people. Mr. Gower was imprisoned for [[manslaughter]] as George had not been there to stop him from accidentally poisoning the prescription. George's mother does not know him. Uncle Billy was [[institutionalize]]d after the Building and Loan failed. Bailey Park is a cemetery, where George discovers Harry's grave. Without George, Harry had drowned as a child, and without Harry to save them, the troops aboard the transport ship were killed. George finds Mary, now a [[spinster]], and when he claims to be her husband, she screams for the police and George flees.\n\nGeorge races to the bridge and begs Clarence for his life back. The original reality is restored, and a grateful George rushes home to await his arrest. Meanwhile, Mary and Billy have rallied the townspeople, who donate more than enough to cover the missing money. Harry arrives and [[Toast (honor)|toast]]s George as \"the richest man in town.\" Among the donations George finds a copy of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', a gift from Clarence, with a note assuring him that no man is a failure who has friends, and thanking him for his wings. When a bell on the [[Christmas tree]] rings, George's youngest daughter, Zuzu, explains that it means that an angel has earned his wings. George realizes that he truly has a wonderful life.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Order and roles per closing credits -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Stewart]] as [[George Bailey (It's a Wonderful Life)|George Bailey]]\n* [[Donna Reed]] as [[Mary Hatch]]\n* [[Lionel Barrymore]] as [[Mr. Potter|Henry F.

The ''San Francisco Chronicle'' January 3, 2000</ref> Despite this, the 1996 holiday special ''[[Elmo Saves Christmas]]'' references the rumor, during a scene where Bert and Ernie walk by a TV set, which is playing the movie. The pair are surprised by the line: \"Bert! Ernie! What's the matter with you two guys?
