It stars [[Sidney Poitier]] and features [[Christian Roberts (actor)|Christian Roberts]], [[Judy Geeson]], [[Suzy Kendall]] and singer [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] making her film debut. [[James Clavell]] directed from his own screenplay, which was based on [[E. R. Braithwaite]]'s 1959 [[autobiographical novel]] [[To Sir, With Love (novel)|of the same name]].\n\nThe film's title song \"[[To Sir with Love (song)|To Sir with Love]]\", sung by Lulu, peaked at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the [[United States]] for five weeks in the autumn of 1967 and ultimately was the best-selling single in the United States of that year. The movie ranked number 27 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s list of the 50 Best High School Movies.<ref>{{Cite news |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 August 2015 |title=50 Best High School Movies |url=https://ew.com/gallery/50-best-high-school-movies-0/?slide=383548#383548 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>\n\nA made-for-television sequel, ''[[To Sir, with Love II]]'' (1996), was released nearly three decades later, with Poitier reprising his starring role.\n\n== Plot ==\nMark Thackeray, an immigrant to Britain from [[British Guiana]], has been unable to obtain an engineering position despite an 18-month job search. He accepts a teaching post for Class 12 at North Quay Secondary School in the tough [[East End of London]], as an interim position, despite having no experience. \n\nThe pupils there have been rejected from other schools, and Thackeray is a replacement for the deceased former teacher. The pupils, led by Bert Denham and Pamela Dare (who later develops a strong [[puppy love|crush]] on Thackeray), behave badly: their antics range from vandalism to distasteful pranks. Thackeray retains a calm demeanour, but loses his temper when he discovers something being burned in the classroom stove, which turns out to be a girl's [[sanitary towel]]. He orders the boys out of the classroom, then reprimands all the girls, either for being responsible or passively observing, for what he says is their \"slutty behaviour\". Thackeray is angry with himself for allowing his pupils to incense him. Changing his approach, he informs the class that they will no longer study from textbooks. Until the end of term, he will treat them as adults and expects them to behave as such. He declares that they will address him as 'Sir' or 'Mr. Thackeray'; the girls will be addressed as 'Miss' and boys by their surnames. They are also allowed to discuss any issue they wish. He gradually wins over the class, except for Denham who continually baits him.\n\nThackeray arranges a class outing to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[South Kensington]] which goes well. The trip is represented by a series of still photographs as Lulu sings \"[[To Sir with Love (song)|To Sir with Love]]\".\n\nHe loses some support when he defuses a potentially violent situation between his student Potter and the gym teacher, Mr. Bell. He demands that Potter apologise directly to Bell, even if he believes Bell was wrong. The group later refuses to invite Thackeray to the class dance. When mixed-race student Seales' white English mother dies, the class takes up a collection for a wreath but refuse to accept Thackeray's donation. The students decline to deliver the wreath in person to Seales' house, fearing neighbourhood gossip for visiting a \"coloured\" person's house.\n\nThe headmaster tells Thackeray that the \"adult approach\" has failed, and future outings are cancelled. Thackeray is to take over the boys' gym classes until the headmaster can find a replacement. Meanwhile, Thackeray receives an engineering job offer in the post.\n\nPamela Dare's mother asks for Thackeray to talk to her daughter about her behaviour at home, but this annoys Pamela, whom Thackeray believes is infatuated with him. During a gym class, Denham smugly challenges Thackeray to a boxing match. Denham delivers several blows to Thackeray's face but the bout comes to an abrupt end when Thackeray delivers one punch to Denham's [[solar plexus]]. Thackeray compliments Denham's ability and suggests he teach boxing to the younger pupils next year. Denham, finally impressed by Thackeray, expresses his admiration for Thackeray to his classmates. Thackeray regains their respect and is invited to the class dance. Later, when Thackeray attends the funeral of Seales' mother, he is touched to find that his lectures on personal choice and responsibility have had an effect and the entire class has attended.\n\nAt the dance, Pamela persuades Thackeray to be her partner for the \"Ladies Choice\" dance. Afterward, the class presents to Thackeray \"a little present to remember us by\". Thackeray is moved and retires to his classroom.\n\nA younger couple of rowdy pupils rush into the classroom hand in hand. Surprised by Thackeray's presence, they chide him and laugh at Thackeray's gift, a silver tankard and card inscribed \"To Sir, with love\" signed by the entire departing class. They threaten that they will be in his class next year. After they leave Thackeray stands up and tears up the engineering job offer, reconciled to the work he has ahead of him. He then takes a flower from the vase on his desk, places it in his lapel, and leaves.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone closing credits, in closing credits order, plus five (Stone to Attard) from first two main \u201cgroup\u201d pages of opening credits who were missing from closing tombstone credits --->\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Mr Mark Thackeray\n* [[Judy Geeson]] as Pamela Dare\n* [[Christian Roberts (actor)|Christian Roberts]] as Bert Denham\n* [[Suzy Kendall]] as Miss Gillian Blanchard\n* [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] as Barbara \"Babs\" Pegg\n* [[Faith Brook]] as Miss Grace Evans\n* [[Geoffrey Bayldon]] as Mr Theo Weston\n* [[Patricia Routledge]] as Clinty Clintridge\n* [[Ann Bell]] as Mrs Dare\n* [[Chris Chittell|Christopher Chittell]] as Potter\n* [[Adrienne Posta]] as Moira Joseph\n* [[Edward Burnham]] as Mr Florian, headmaster\n* [[Rita Webb]] as Mrs Joseph\n* Gareth Robinson as Tich Jackson\n* [[Lynne Sue Moon]] as Miss Wong\n* Anthony Villaroel as Seales\n* Richard Willson as Curly\n* [[Michael Des Barres]] as Williams\n* [[Fred Griffiths (actor)|Fred Griffiths]] as Market Stallholder\n* [[Marianne Stone]] as Gert\n* Dervis Ward as Mr Bell (P.T.

They agreed to make the film for small fees, provided Poitier got 10% of the gross and Clavell 30% of the profits. \"When we were ready to shoot, Columbia wanted either a rape or a big fight put in,\" said [[Martin Baum (agent)|Martin Baum]]. \"We held out, saying this was a gentle story, and we won.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nThe film was shot in [[Wapping]] (including the [[Wapping railway station]]) and [[Shadwell]] in the [[East End of London]], in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and at [[Pinewood Studios]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/t/To-Sir-With-Love.php|publisher=Movie-Locations.com|title=To Sir, With Love |access-date=11 January 2022}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nUpon its U.S. release, [[Bosley Crowther]] began his review by contrasting the film with Poitier's role and performance in the 1955 film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]''; unlike that earlier film, Crowther says \"a nice air of gentility suffuses this pretty color film, and Mr. Poitier gives a quaint example of being proper and turning the other cheek. Although he controls himself with difficulty in some of his confrontations with his class, and even flares up on one occasion, he never acts like a boor, the way one of his fellow teachers (played by [[Geoffrey Bayldon]]) does. Except for a few barbed comments by the latter, there is little intrusion of or discussion about the issue of race: It is as discreetly played down as are many other probable tensions in this school. ''To Sir, with Love'' comes off as a cozy, good-humored and unbelievable little tale.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Bosley |last=Crowther|author-link= Bosley Crowther | date=15 June 1967 |title= Poitier Meets the Cockneys: He Plays Teacher Who Wins Pupils Over| url= https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E06E3DF103AE63ABC4D52DFB066838C679EDE | work= [[The New York Times]]| access-date=2013-12-19}}</ref>\n\n''[[Halliwell's Film and Video Guide]]'' describes it as \"sentimental non-realism\" and quotes a ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' review (possibly contemporary with its British release), which claims that \"the sententious script sounds as if it has been written by a zealous Sunday school teacher after a particularly exhilarating boycott of South African oranges\".<ref>{{cite book| editor1-first= John | editor1-last= Walker | title= Halliwell's Film and Video Guide 2000 | location=London | publisher=HarperCollins | year=1999 | page= 845| isbn= 0-00-653165-2|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Halliwell_s_Film_Guide/EMg3-qGrT_EC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22the+sententious+script+sounds+as+if+it+has+been+written%22&dq=%22the+sententious+script+sounds+as+if+it+has+been+written%22&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Time Out Film Guide]]'' says that it \"bears no resemblance to school life as we know it\" and the \"hoodlums' miraculous reformation a week before the end of term (thanks to teacher Poitier) is laughable\".<ref>David Pirie review in, John Pym (ed), [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=%22bears+no+resemblance+to+school+life+as+we+know+it%22 ''Time Out Film Guide 2009''], London: Ebury, 2008, p. 1098.</ref> Although agreeing with the claims about the film's sentimentality, and giving it a mediocre rating, the ''Virgin Film Guide'' asserts: \"What makes [this] such an enjoyable film is the mythic nature of Poitier's character.

Poitier especially benefited from that film's success considering he agreed on a mere $30,000 fee in exchange for 10% of the gross box office and thus arranged one of the most impressive payoffs in film history. In fact, although Columbia insisted on an annual cap to Poitier of $25,000 to fulfill that percentage term, the studio was forced to revise the deal with Poitier when they calculated they would be committed to 80 years of those payments.<ref>{{cite book |last=Harris |first= Mark |title=Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of a New Hollywood |url=https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0 |url-access=registration |year=2008 |publisher= Penguin Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/picturesatrevolu00harr_0/page/328 328]}}</ref>\n\nDespite the character of Mark Thackeray being a leading role, the film has been criticized in modern times for Portier's potrayal of the [[Magical Negro|Magical Nergro]] trope.
