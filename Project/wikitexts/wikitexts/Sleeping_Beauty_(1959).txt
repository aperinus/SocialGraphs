The [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|16th Disney animated feature film]], it was released to theaters on January 29, 1959, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. It features the voices of [[Mary Costa]], [[Eleanor Audley]], [[Verna Felton]], [[Barbara Luddy]], [[Barbara Jo Allen]], [[Bill Shirley]], [[Taylor Holmes]], and [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Les Clark]], [[Eric Larson]], and [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], under the supervision of [[Clyde Geronimi]]. The film was written by [[Erdman Penner]] with additional story work by Joe Rinaldi, [[Winston Hibler]], [[Bill Peet]], [[Ted Sears]], [[Ralph Wright]], and Milt Banta. The film's musical score and songs, featuring the work of the [[Munich Symphony Orchestra|Graunke Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[George Bruns]], are arrangements or adaptations of numbers from the 1890 [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|''Sleeping Beauty'' ballet]] by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].\n\n''Sleeping Beauty'' was the first animated film to be photographed in the [[Super Technirama 70]] [[widescreen]] process, as well as the second full-length animated feature film to be filmed in anamorphic widescreen, following Disney's ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' four years earlier. The film was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in the first-run engagements.\n\nIn 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Tartaglione|first=Nancy|title=National Film Registry Adds 'Purple Rain', 'Clerks', 'Gaslight' & More; 'Boys Don't Cry' One Of Record 7 Pics From Female Helmers|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 11, 2019|access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Mike|title='Purple Rain,' 'Amadeus,' 'Boys Don't Cry,' 'Clerks' Enter National Film Registry|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/purple-rain-amadeus-boys-dont-cry-clerks-enter-national-film-registry-1261469|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 11, 2019|access-date=December 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter several years of having no children, the rulers of a [[Monarchies in Europe|European kingdom]] King Stefan and Queen Leah welcome the birth of their daughter, Princess [[Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)|Aurora]]. They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess, and at her [[Baptism|christening]] she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the son of King Stefan's friend King Hubert, to [[Jure uxoris|unite their kingdoms]].\n\nAmong the guests are the three [[Fairy|good fairies]], [[Flora, Fauna and Merryweather]]. Flora and Fauna bless Aurora with beauty and song, respectively, but Merryweather's gift is interrupted by the arrival of an evil sorceress named [[Maleficent]]. As revenge for not being invited, Maleficent [[curse]]s Aurora, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] of a [[spinning wheel]] and die. Since her magic is no stronger than Maleficent's to undo the curse, Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep, only broken by [[Romantic love|true love]]'s kiss. King Stefan orders all spinning wheels throughout the kingdom be burned. At the fairies' urging, King Stefan and Queen Leah reluctantly bring Aurora to a cottage in the forest to live with the fairies in safety.\n\nSixteen years later, Aurora, renamed Briar Rose, grows into a beautiful young woman. On her sixteenth birthday, the fairies ask her to gather berries while they prepare a surprise party. Aurora befriends the animals of the forest and sings them a song, \"[[Once Upon a Dream (Sleeping Beauty song)|Once Upon a Dream]]\". Phillip, now a handsome young man, follows Aurora's voice and is instantly struck by her beauty. She is initially frightened, as she is not allowed to talk to strangers, but she and Phillip fall in love, and she invites him to meet her family at the cottage that night.\n\nMeanwhile, Flora and Merryweather argue over the color of Aurora's gown, attracting the attention of Maleficent's [[raven]] who learns Aurora's location. Returning home, Aurora is thrilled to tell her guardians that she has fallen in love. The fairies finally tell Aurora that she is a princess, already betrothed to a prince, and she must never see the man she met again. Heartbroken, Aurora cries in her room. Phillip tells his father of the peasant girl he met and wishes to marry, in spite of his prearranged marriage. King Hubert fails to convince his son otherwise, leaving him devastated.\n\nThe fairies take Aurora to the castle to await her birthday celebrations, where she will finally see her parents. Maleficent appears and lures Aurora into a dark tower away from the fairies, and tricks her into touching the spindle of a cursed spinning wheel. Aurora pricks her finger, fulfilling the curse. The three fairies place the sleeping Aurora on a bed in the highest tower and place a powerful spell on all the people in the kingdom, causing them to sleep until the spell on their princess is broken. They overhear a sleepy conversation between the two kings, and realize that Phillip is the man with whom Aurora has fallen in love. They rush to find him, but he is abducted by Maleficent and her minions at the cottage. She reveals to Phillip the enchanted princess and her plan to lock him away for a century until he is on the verge of death, then release him to meet his love, who will not have aged a single day.\n\nThe fairies rescue Phillip, arming him with the magical Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue. An enraged Maleficent surrounds the castle with thorns but fails to stop Phillip. She teleports in front of him and transforms into a gigantic [[dragon]]. They battle, and Phillip throws the sword, blessed by the fairies, directly into Maleficent's heart, causing her to fall to her death.\n\nPhillip awakens Aurora with a kiss, breaking the spell and waking the kingdom. The royal couple descends to the ballroom, where Aurora is reunited with her parents. Flora and Merryweather continue their argument over Aurora's gown while the happy couple dances, living happily ever after.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main article|List of Disney's Sleeping Beauty characters}}\n* [[Mary Costa]] as [[Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)|Princess Aurora]], also known as Briar Rose, a titular character.\n* [[Bill Shirley]] as Prince Phillip, Aurora's \"true love\" to whom she was betrothed.\n* [[Eleanor Audley]] as [[Maleficent]], a powerful dark fairy and self-proclaimed \"Mistress of All Evil\" who puts a curse on Aurora.\n* [[Verna Felton]] as [[Flora, Fauna and Merryweather|Flora]], Aurora's fairy godmother and guardian dressed in red.

This was the only time Larson directed a sequence or a film during his tenure at [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]].\n\n== Production ==\n[[Walt Disney]] first considered making a film based on [[Charles Perrault]]'s fairy tale ''Sleeping Beauty'' in 1938.

These included the prince's acquaintance with the princess before the curse is fulfilled, and, consequently, a shorter duration of her sleep, which lasted a hundred years in the original fairy tale.<ref name=\"DisneyArchives\" />{{sfn|Thomas|1958|pp=30\u201331}} Part of the difficulty was trying to differentiate Disney's third princess, who was named Aurora, from [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] and [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]]. To do that, the story artists came up with an idea to have the fairies rear her up in a forest cottage,{{sfn|Thomas|1958|p=31}} with Aurora being completely unaware of her background or the danger she was in. She also was given a different personality style\u2014\"a freshness and a modern sensibility\" to make her more appealing to audiences.<ref name=\"AudioCommentary2003\" />\n\nAt the same time, Disney, inspired by the improvement of his animators' skills in draftsmanship of a realistic male figure since ''Snow White'', considered it important to expand the role and the character of the prince, who was named Phillip.<ref name=\"AudioCommentary2003\" />{{sfn|Thomas|1958|pp=30\u201331}} Initially, the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which Aurora and Phillip would have met during a treasure hunt, organized by the king, but the idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline. Instead, it was written that prince and princess would meet in the forest by random chance,{{sfn|Thomas|1958|p=31}}{{sfn|Koenig|1997|page=104}} an idea previously introduced in the 1951 outline.<ref name=\"The1951Outline\" /> Also, to further establish Phillip's role as Aurora's \"true love\", story artists came up with an idea to have Maleficent kidnap him and plot to keep him prisoner in her castle for a century, which would also serve as a twist on the centennial slumber from the original fairy tale.<ref name=\"VirtualGalleries\">{{Cite AV media |title=Sleeping Beauty Virtual Galleries |type=Bonus feature |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment |location=Sleeping Beauty: Special Edition  DVD |year=2003}}</ref>\n\nStriving for a more serious direction of storytelling,<ref name=\"AudioCommentary2003\" /><ref name=\"PicturePerfect\">{{Cite video |title=Picture Perfect: The Making of Sleeping Beauty |type=Documentary film |location=''Sleeping Beauty'' Platinum Edition |publisher=[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] |year=2008}}</ref> Disney also personally removed several gags and comical scenes involving the Three Good Fairies, who by that time had been renamed Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, feeling that they were too \"slapsticky\" and more appropriate for [[Donald Duck]] cartoons.<ref name=\"PicturePerfect\" /> One of these was a sequence in which Flora, Fauna and Merryweather unsuccessfully try to bake a birthday cake for Aurora, but in the end they accidentally blow up the oven.<ref name=\"PicturePerfect\" />{{sfn|Thomas|1958|page=15}} Also, in the early versions of the story, Aurora was supposed to directly encounter with Maleficent, who would have tricked her into pricking the finger on the spindle. However, Disney felt that the \"eerie, haunting presentation of a victim powerless in the hands of evil\" would be the \"strongest and best statement for the film\", so the scene was changed to have Maleficent lure Aurora to her doom under hypnosis, without interacting with her directly.<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=Deleted Scene: The Curse is Fulfilled |type=Bonus feature |publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment |location=Sleeping Beauty: Diamond Edition (Blu-ray) |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |author1=Thomas, Frank |author2=Johnston, Ollie |title=The Disney Villain |publisher=Disney Editions |year=1993 |page=125 |isbn=978-1-562-82792-2}}</ref> Despite Disney's desire to not repeat themselves, several story elements originated from discarded ideas for ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' and ''Cinderella'', including Maleficent's capture of Phillip and his escape from her fortress, as well as Disney's favorite concept\u2014prince and princess dancing on a cloud.<ref name=\"PrincessFunFacts\" />{{sfn|Allan|1999|page=39}}\n\nBy mid-1952, Disney had planned to release ''Sleeping Beauty'' on Christmas 1955.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=559}} However, production did not start until July 1953.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=106}} By the middle of the same year, director [[Wilfred Jackson]] had recorded the dialogue, assembled a story reel, and was to commence preliminary animation work where Princess Aurora and Prince Philip were to meet in the forest and dance.

Geronimi had felt Earle's paintings \"lacked the mood in a lot of things.

Her goal is to place a curse on each of the four locations in her playable kingdom.\n\n=== Theme parks ===\n''Sleeping Beauty'' was made while [[Walt Disney]] was building [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] (hence the six-year production time). To help promote the film, [[Disney Imagineer|Imagineers]] named the park's icon \"[[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]\" (it was originally to be Snow White's).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} An indoor walk-through exhibit was added to the empty castle interior in 1957, where guests could walk through the castle, up and over the castle entrance, viewing \"Story Moment\" dioramas of scenes from the film, which were improved with animated figurines in 1977. It closed shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], supposedly because the dark, unmonitored corridors were a risk.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} After being closed for seven years, the exhibit space underwent extensive period refurbishment to restore the original 1957 displays, and reopened to guests on November 27, 2008.

The Bluebirds from the film also appear as \"tweeting birds\" that fly around [[Roger Rabbit]]'s or [[Eddie Valiant]]'s heads in two scenes, after a refrigerator fell on top of Roger's head and while Eddie Valiant is in Toontown, the birds are seen again flying around his head until he shoos them away.\n* Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather were featured as guests in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' and Maleficent was one of the villains in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.\n* Although not a full-feature film sequel to the original, the first all-new story featuring the characters from the movie (sans Maleficent) appeared in ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', the first volume of collection of the [[Disney Princess]]es. It was released on September 4, 2007. [[Mary Costa]], the original voice of Princess Aurora, was not fond of this story and felt that it did not work.<ref>[https://www.dvdizzy.com/sleepingbeauty-interview2.html Mary Costa Interview \u2013 Page 2].
