It tells the story about a high-priced [[male prostitution|escort]] in Los Angeles (Gere) who becomes romantically involved with a prominent politician's wife (Hutton), while simultaneously becoming the prime suspect in a murder case.\n\nThe film established Gere as a [[leading man]], and was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to include frontal male nudity from its main star. It is also notable for its [[Golden Globe Award]]\u2013nominated musical score, composed by [[Giorgio Moroder]], and number-one single \"[[Call Me (Blondie song)|Call Me]]\" by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]. Schrader considers it one of four similar films, which he calls \"double bookends\": ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', bookended by ''[[Light Sleeper]]'', and ''American Gigolo'' bookended by ''[[The Walker]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|series=[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey]] |season=1|title=[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey#Episode 9 - American Cinema of the 70s|American Cinema of the 70s]]|time=28 minutes in|year=2011|network=[[More4]] }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJulian Kay is a [[male prostitution|male escort]] in Los Angeles whose clientele is upper-class women. His job supports and requires an expensive taste in cars and clothes, and affords him a luxury [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]] apartment. He is blatantly [[economic materialism|materialistic]], as he strives to merit inclusion into the class of people who make up his clientele. He takes pleasure in his work from being able to sexually satisfy women, offering and selling his body to women.\n\nJulian's procurer, Anne, sends him on an assignment with a wealthy old widow, Mrs. Dobrun, who is visiting town. Afterwards, he goes to the hotel bar and meets Michelle Stratton, a California state senator's wife, who becomes obsessed with him. Julian's pimp Leon sends him to [[Palm Springs]] on a \"substitute\" assignment to the house of Mr. Rheiman, a wealthy financier. Rheiman asks Julian to have [[sado-masochistic]] sex with his wife Judy while he is watching them. The next day, Julian berates Leon for sending him to a \"rough trick\" and makes it clear he declines [[kink (sexual)|kinky]] or [[gay]] assignments. Leon warns Julian that the wealthy, older women he serves will turn on him and discard him without a second thought.\n\nAs Julian begins to have a relationship with Michelle, he learns that Judy Rheiman has been murdered. [[Los Angeles Police Department]] Detective Sunday identifies Julian as the prime suspect. Though Julian was with Lisa Williams, another client, on the night of the murder, she protects her marriage by not providing an alibi for Julian.\n\nJulian discovers evidence about the murder. He realizes that he is being framed and grows increasingly desperate. His clothes become rumpled, he goes unshaven and drives a cheap rental car (after painstakingly searching his [[Mercedes-Benz R107 and C107|Mercedes]] and finding Judy's jewelry that was planted in it to frame him). He neglects to pick up an important client for Anne that he had been scheduled to escort, angering Anne and causing her to shun him. Julian warns Michelle that he is in trouble and, hoping to protect her, he tells her to leave him alone.\n\nJulian concludes that Leon and Rheiman are the ones trying to frame him, and that one of Leon's other gigolos was the murderer. Julian goes to confront Leon, telling him the truth and trying to clear his name. Leon refuses to help him and remains implacable. In a fit of rage, Julian pushes Leon from the apartment balcony; although Julian immediately regrets his action and tries to save him, Leon nevertheless falls to his death. With no one to help him, Julian ends up in jail, helplessly awaiting trial for Judy's murder. Michelle reconciles with Julian by telling the police that she was with Julian the night of Judy's murder, sacrificing her reputation and marriage to save him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Julian Kay\n* [[Lauren Hutton]] as Michelle Stratton\n* [[Bill Duke]] as Leon James\n* [[Hector Elizondo]] as Detective Joe Sunday\n* [[Frances Bergen]] as Mrs. Laudner\n* [[Carol Bruce]] as Mrs. Sloan\n* [[K Callan]] as Lisa Williams\n* [[Carole Cook]] as Mrs. Dobrun\n* [[Cindy Morgan]] as Jillian Summerset\n* [[David Cryer]] as Lieutenant Curtis\n* [[Richard Derr]] as Mr. Williams\n* [[Nina van Pallandt]] as Anne\n* [[Robert Wightman]] as Floyd Wicker\n* Patty Carr as Judy Rheimam\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Paul Schrader]] first conceived of the idea for the film while teaching screenwriting at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s film and television department.<ref name=\"AFI\" /> The script was one of five screenplays Schrader wrote in 1976.<ref name=\"AFI\" /> Schrader commented, \"The character in \u2018''[[Taxi Driver]]''\u2019 was compulsively nonsexual.
