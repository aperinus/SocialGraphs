The film stars [[Luke Wilson]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Will Ferrell]] as depressed men in their thirties who seek to relive their college days by starting a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], and the tribulations they encounter in doing so. The film was released on February 21, 2003, received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $86 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nUpon returning home early from a business trip, attorney Mitch Martin walks in on his girlfriend Heidi watching porn. Initially relieved, it turns out she has planned an [[orgy]]. Learning she regularly partakes in them, he decides to break up with her. A few days later, Mitch encounters his high school crush, Nicole, at the wedding of his friend Frank and makes an awkward impression. Later, he moves into a house located near the campus of the fictional Harrison University in [[Upstate New York]].\n\nMitch's other friend Bernard throws a housewarming party at Mitch's house, dubbed Mitch-A-Palooza, which is a huge success. Frank gets drunk and is seen [[streaking]] by his wife Marissa and her friends, putting a strain on their new marriage. The following morning, the trio run into an old acquaintance whom they used to ridicule at school: Gordon Pritchard, who is now the college dean. He informs them they must vacate the house because it's exclusively for campus housing. Bernard proposes starting a fraternity that is open to anyone to meet the housing criteria. The new fraternity carries out several [[hazing]] events throughout campus, attracting the attention of Pritchard and other faculty members.\n\nAt a birthday party for one of Bernard's children, Nicole brings her boyfriend Mark, and Mitch later walks in on him in the bathroom as he hooks up with another girl. While initially discreet, Mitch is forced to recount the incident to Nicole when Mark lies that the girl was with Mitch instead of himself. Later, the oldest fraternity member, Blue, dies of a [[heart attack]] during a \"[[K-Y Jelly|KY lube]] wrestling\" match with two college girls at his birthday celebration. At Blue's funeral, Marissa asks Frank for a divorce.\n\nPlotting revenge against the group, Pritchard asks the student council president, Megan, to revoke the fraternity's charter. Megan, who met her boyfriend at one of their parties, initially remains loyal to the fraternity until the dean bribes her with promises to help her get into [[Columbia Law School]]. By video, he claims that the group is violating university policies, subjecting the students in the non-sanctioned fraternity to expulsion.\n\nMitch learns that the group has the right to bypass Pritchard's ruling if all of their members complete various activities to prove their legitimacy. Frank is able to defeat [[James Carville]] in a debate session. Next, the fraternity successfully navigates its way through an academic exam largely due to the assistance of two of Mitch's co-workers, who help everyone cheat. In the school spirit evaluation, the fraternity loses points when Frank unsuccessfully attempts to jump through a ring of fire while dressed as the school mascot. He catches fire, resulting in firefighters being summoned.\n\nAfterwards, Megan confronts Pritchard, telling him that she sabotaged the fraternity's charter, but she wasn't accepted into Columbia Law School. Pritchard walks away, leaving Megan with nothing&mdash;but not before telling her, \"I bribe people all the time, but I changed my mind. It's a free country, okay? Lesson learned.\"\n\nBurned and humiliated, Frank rallies to give a strong performance in the floor exercise routine of the gymnastics competition. Bernard manages to complete the rings routine, leaving only the vault exercise remaining. Pritchard chooses Weensie, an obese member of the fraternity, to perform the vault. Weensie executes a perfect landing, allowing the fraternity to pass gymnastics.\n\nThe fraternity completes the activities with an 84% average. However, Pritchard tells them that their average has dropped to a failing 58% after accounting for the absence of Blue. While the students are in despair, Megan arrives with tape recorded evidence of Pritchard's bribery. After a chase throughout campus, Frank obtains the tape and uses it to get Pritchard fired. The fraternity's charter is reinstated and they move into Pritchard's former residence.\n\nNicole visits Mitch as he moves out of the old fraternity house, and tells him she dumped Mark after catching him cheating. The two reconcile, intent on moving their relationship forward.  Mitch and Bernard decide to withdraw from the fraternity. Frank, now [[divorced]], takes over the leadership role.\n\nIn mid-credits, Mark, who is driving his sports-car, suffers an accident, striking and killing Pritchard while he is fly-fishing. They both die when the car explodes. Frank meets Heidi while shopping, who then invites him to a \"get together,\" an invitation that he enthusiastically accepts, knowing about her sexual escapades.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Mitch \"The Godfather\" Martin\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Frank \"The Tank\" Ricard\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Bernard \"Beanie\" Campbell\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Dean Gordon \"Cheese\" Pritchard\n* [[Ellen Pompeo]] as Nicole\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Heidi\n* [[Leah Remini]] as Lara Campbell\n* [[Allen Haff]] as Frat Boy\n* [[Perrey Reeves]] as Marissa Jones\n* [[Craig Kilborn]] as Mark\n* [[Patrick Fischler]] as Michael\n* [[Sara Tanaka]] as Megan Huang\n* [[Simon Helberg]] as Jerry\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Peppers\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Darcie Goldberg\n* [[Patrick J.

During the introductory sequence [[Ryan Adams]]' \"To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)\", co-written with [[David Rawlings]], can be heard most memorably during the metal detector scene.\n\n==Canceled sequel==\nIn 2006, a sequel, titled ''Old School Dos'', was written by Scot Armstrong but was turned down by original stars, [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Vince Vaughn]]. The story concerned the aging fraternity going to [[Spring Break]]. While promoting ''[[Semi-Pro]]'' in 2008, Ferrell had this to say about the defunct project: \"I read [the script]. Some super funny set pieces, but I don't know. I think Vince [Vaughn] had the same reaction. We\u2019re just kind of doing the same thing again. It was like us going to Spring Break, but we\u2019ve got to find this guy who's the head of a fraternity. Once again, funny things but it's just us once again back in a fraternity setting. It just felt like it was repeating. But watch, I'm over-thinking it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 29, 2008 |author= Hunter Stephenson |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/will-ferrell-talks-land-of-the-lost-old-school-2-elf-2-and-a-confederacy-of-dunces/ |title=Will Ferrell Talks Land of the Lost, Old School 2, Elf 2 and A Confederacy of Dunces |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124083752/http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/02/29/will-ferrell-talks-land-of-the-lost-old-school-2-elf-2-and-a-confederacy-of-dunces/ |archive-date=2009-01-24 |url-status=live |access-date=2020-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Old School}}\n* {{IMDb title|tt0302886|Old School}}\n* {{mojo title|oldschool|Old School}}\n\n{{Todd Phillips}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Old School (Film)}}\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about fraternities and sororities]]\n[[Category:Films about infidelity]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Todd Phillips]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Todd Phillips]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2003]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Scot Armstrong]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Todd Phillips]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro]]\n[[Category:The Montecito Picture Company films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
