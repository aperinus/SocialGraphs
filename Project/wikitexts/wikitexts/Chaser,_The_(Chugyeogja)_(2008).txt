One night, he commands Mi-jin to service a customer, despite her protests over her sickness. Joong-ho then realizes this customer was the last to see his missing girls. Believing that this customer is [[Human trafficking|trafficking his women]], Joong-ho nevertheless sends Mi-jin in so that she can forward the customer's address to him. Joong-ho contacts his old [[Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency|police task force]] for help, but they cannot assist because the [[mayor of Seoul]], whom they were guarding, has been attacked with feces; this results in the police suffering a media firestorm.\n\nThe customer, Yeong-min, takes Mi-jin back to a house but Mi-jin fails to contact Joong-ho due to the bathroom having no cell service. Yeong-min binds Mi-jin, but her struggles prevent her murder with a chisel, so Yeong-min hits her with a hammer, knocking her out. Just then, an elderly couple from the local church arrive, inquiring about the real house owner, Mr. Park; they recognize his dog. Yeong-min then invites the elderly couple in and murders them.\n\nJoong-ho, only aware of the customer's district, conducts a search. Yeong-min tries to ditch the couple's car, but collides with Joong-ho's car. Joong-ho's suspicions are aroused as Yeong-min has blood on his shirt and refuses to give his phone number. Joong-ho calls the customer's number and Yeong-min's phone rings. Yeong-min flees but is caught and beaten by Joong-ho. Both men are arrested by a local cop. At the station, Yeong-min casually admits that he committed nine murders. Competing police divisions argue over who will investigate the high-profile unsolved murders in the area.\n\nDespite the confession, the police have no physical evidence so they cannot detain Yeong-min for long. Yeong-min reveals Mi-jin is alive, but the police doubt it. Joong-ho goes to Mi-jin's apartment to collect DNA samples, and from there he takes Mi-jin's daughter Eun-ji with him while he follows up a lead in Yeong-min's hometown. Joong-ho learns that Yeong-min was jailed for three years for [[Lobotomy|lobotomizing]] his own nephew. Another prostitute informs Joong-ho that Yeong-min is impotent. When Yeong-min is questioned about his impotency being part of his motive, he attacks the interrogator. Joong-ho's assistant finds a room where Yeong-min had once lived; Joong-ho discovers religious drawings on the room's walls. Eun-ji wanders off while following a woman who looks like her mother, then meets with an accident and is brought to hospital by Joong-ho.\n\nYeong-min provides a false lead after being again beaten by Joong-ho. The prosecutor discovers Yeong-min's injuries and demands Yeong-min's release, refusing to wait for DNA test results. Saying that Yeong-min's arrest will be seen as the police's attempt to save face, the prosecutor demands for Joong-ho's arrest for injuring Yeong-min. Joong-ho is handcuffed and attacks his former teammates to escape; one of them frees him.\n\nMeanwhile, Mi-jin freed herself and escaped from the house. Badly injured, she finds help at a nearby corner shop, and hides in the back. The police are informed, but the nearest officers are fast asleep. Yeong-min stops at the same shop to buy cigarettes. Not knowing Yeong-min is the attacker himself, the shopkeeper tells him about Mi-jin's story, asking him to stay to protect them from the attacker (which is himself) while they await the police. Yeong-min uses the shopkeeper's hammer to murder both her and Mi-jin. Alerted by police sirens, Joong-ho arrives finding the police have cordoned off the bloody shop. Yeong-min escapes off-camera back to Mr. Park's house, where he stores Mi-jin's severed head and hands in a fish tank. Yeong-min buries the elderly couple and kills Mr. Park's dog.\n\nThe humiliated police throw everything into the search for Yeong-min, while the story is leaked to the public. A distraught Joong-ho follows a lead to the local church, then notices that a church statue matches the drawings he had seen in Yeong-min's old room. As Mr. Park was the sculptor and Yeong-min his \"assistant\", the [[deacon]] points Joong-ho to Mr. Park's house.\n\nJoong-ho enters the residence, interrupting Yeong-min's departure. They fight, with Joong-ho ultimately getting the upper hand, but the police arrive and restrain Joong-ho from killing Yeong-min. Yeong-Min is taken away while the police excavate the yard, finding several bodies.\n\nThe film ends with Joong-ho sitting silently by Eun-ji in her hospital room, holding her hand.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kim Yoon-seok]] as Eom Joong-ho, pimp and former police officer\n* [[Ha Jung-woo]] as Je Yeong-min, serial killer\n* [[Seo Young-hee]] as Kim Mi-jin, prostitute\n* Koo Bon-woong as Oh-jot, Eom Joong-ho's assistant\n* [[Kim Yoo-jung]] as Eun-ji, Mi-jin's daughter\n* [[Jung In-gi]] as Detective Lee\n* [[Park Hyo-joo]] as Detective Oh\n* [[Choi Jung-woo]] as Chief of Police\n* Min Kyeong-jin as Team chief\n* [[Oh Yeon-ah]] as Sung-hee\n* [[Kim Sun-young (actress, born 1980)|Kim Sun-young]] as Ji-yeong\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''The Chaser'' was released in [[South Korea]] on February 14, 2008.<ref name=\"Koreanfilm.org\">[http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm08.html \"The Best Selling Films of 2008\"].
