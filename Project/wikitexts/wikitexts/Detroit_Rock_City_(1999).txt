Dupr\u00e9. It tells of four teenage boys in a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] [[tribute act|tribute band]] who try to see their [[wikt:idol|idols]] in a concert in [[Detroit]] in 1978. Comparable with other [[rock music|rock]] films such as ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'', ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', and ''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'', it tells a [[coming-of-age story]] through a filter of 1970s music and culture in the United States. It took its title from the [[Detroit Rock City|Kiss song of the same name]].\n\nThe film was shot at [[Cedarbrae Collegiate Institute]] in [[Scarborough, Toronto]] and other [[Ontario]] locations including [[Copps Coliseum]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed approximately $6 million against a $17 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1978 [[Cleveland, Ohio]], four rebellious teenage boys \u2013 Hawk, Lex, Trip Verudie, and Jeremiah \"Jam\" Bruce \u2013 play in a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] [[tribute act|tribute band]] called \"Mystery\" and prepare to see their idols in concert in [[Detroit, Michigan]] the following night. Their hopes are dashed when Jam's religiously conservative mother finds their tickets and burns them before having Jam transferred to a Catholic boarding school.\n\nAfter Trip manages to win tickets and backstage passes from a radio contest in Detroit, the boys, disguised as pizza deliverymen, rescue Jam from the boarding school by drugging Father Phillip McNulty using a pizza topped with [[Psilocybin mushroom|hallucinogen mushrooms]] before setting off for Detroit in Lex's mother's [[Volvo 200 Series|Volvo]] to collect the tickets. En route, they get into a [[road rage]] incident with [[Disco music|disco]] fanatics Kenny and Bobby after Trip throws a slice of pizza on their windshield. They beat up the disco duo and continue their journey before picking up Kenny's girlfriend Christine, who dumped Kenny due to his behavior.\n\nUpon arriving in Detroit, the boys discover that Trip did not stay on the phone long enough to give the radio station his information, resulting in the tickets being given to the next caller. When they exit the building they find the Volvo missing, which they deduce Christine stole. After briefly arguing amongst themselves, the four split up to find Kiss tickets and the Volvo, planning to regroup in 105 minutes. Hawk finds a scalper who suggests he enter a male stripping contest to raise money for tickets. He gets [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] and loses the contest after vomiting, but is offered payment for the company and has [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with an older woman named Amanda Finch. After being paid, he locates the scalper, only to discover that his tickets are sold out. Trip goes to a local convenience store, hoping to mug a younger child for his ticket but the boy's older brother, Chongo, and his friends, confront and threaten him for $200. He then plans to rob the store with a [[Stretch Armstrong]] doll disguised as a gun, but ends up receiving $150 after thwarting a genuine robbery attempt. Trip gives the money to Chongo's gang, but they assault him regardless and consequently steal his wallet.\n\nLex sneaks backstage with the concert loading crew but is caught and tossed over a fence where he tames a group of vicious dogs with a [[Frisbee]], then saves Christine and the Volvo from two car thieves (who are responsible for stealing the car) at a nearby [[chop shop]]. Jam encounters his mother at an anti-Kiss rally, who forcibly takes his drumsticks before dragging him to a nearby church for confessional with a perverted priest who is more interested in salacious conversation, rather than an actual confession. He is then greeted by Beth Bumstein, a classmate who is moving to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. After admitting their feelings for each other, they have sex before parting ways, agreeing to maintain contact with each other. Jam, imbued with new confidence, returns to the rally and criticizes his mother's domineering ways and hypocrisy, telling her that her extreme religious views and controlling attitude have only caused him to [[Atheism|despise religion]] and rebel. He ultimately breaks her spirit by labelling her as a lousy mother and proclaiming to her and the rally attendees that he lost his virginity in a confessional booth. He then demands his drumsticks back, one of which she broke in half. She does so and apologizes to him, remarking to the crowd, \"They grow up fast, don't they?\".\n\nWhen the boys meet up empty-handed, Jam suggests beating each other up to imply having been mugged for their tickets. Upon their arrival at [[Cobo Center|Cobo Hall]], the guards initially doubt the boys' claims, until Trip points out Chongo's gang, who are just entering, as their assailants. When the guards search them, they find Trip's wallet with his  [[Kiss Army]] picture ID and money, then confiscate Chongo's tickets and give them to the boys before escorting him, his little brother, and his friends out of the concert. Shocked and delighted, the quartet enter the concert hall as Kiss plays [[Detroit Rock City|the film's title song]]. As it ends, [[Peter Criss]] throws a drumstick, which Jam joyfully and excitedly catches.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dvdfile.com/reviews/review/detroit-rock-city-6237\n| title = Detroit Rock City Review\n| first = Cliff\n| last = Stephenson\n| work = DVDfile.com\n| date = 30 November 1999\n| access-date = 14 November 2009\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606233817/http://www.dvdfile.com/reviews/review/detroit-rock-city-6237\n| archive-date = June 6, 2009\n| url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n;Members of Kiss:\n* [[Paul Stanley]] as The Starchild\n* [[Gene Simmons]] as The Demon\n* [[Peter Criss]] as The Catman\n* [[Ace Frehley]] as The Spaceman\n\n;Other:\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Hawk\n* [[Sam Huntington]] as Jeremiah \"Jam\" Bruce\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Lex\n* James DeBello as Trip Verudie\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Mrs. Bruce\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Beth Bumstein\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Christine\n* [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]] as Barbara\n* [[Shannon Tweed]] as Amanda Finch\n* [[Nick Scotti]] as Kenny\n* David Quane as Bobby\n* [[Joe Flaherty]] as Father Phillip McNulty\n* Cody Jones as Little Kid\n* [[Michael Barry (actor)|Michael Barry]] as Nerd\n* Matthew G.
