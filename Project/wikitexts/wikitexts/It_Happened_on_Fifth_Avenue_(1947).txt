[[Herbert Clyde Lewis]] and [[Frederick Stephani]] were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Story]], losing to [[Valentine Davies]] for another Christmas-themed story, ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAloysius T. McKeever ([[Victor Moore]]), a [[hobo]], makes his home in a seasonally boarded-up [[Fifth Avenue]] mansion, each time its owner\u2014Michael J. O'Connor ([[Charles Ruggles]]), the second richest man in the world\u2014winters at his Virginia estate. McKeever winds up taking in ex-[[GI (military)|G.I.]] Jim Bullock ([[Don DeFore]]), who has been evicted from an apartment building O'Connor is tearing down for a new [[skyscraper]], and later 18-year-old Trudy \"Smith\" ([[Gale Storm]]), who is actually O'Connor's runaway daughter. Jim soon invites war buddies Whitey ([[Alan Hale, Jr.]]), Hank (Edward Ryan) and their families to share the vast mansion when they are unable to find homes of their own.\n\nWhen Trudy encounters her father, she tells him she is in love with Jim. She has not told Jim who she really is because she wants to win his love without her wealth. She then persuades her father to pretend to be a homeless man named \"Mike\". McKeever reluctantly takes Mike in, but treats him like a servant. When Mike becomes fed up, he gives Trudy 24 hours to get the squatters out. Trudy calls  [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] and seeks help from her mother Mary ([[Ann Harding]]), who is recently divorced from Michael. Mary comes to New York and pretends to be another homeless person to join the other squatters. McKeever, sensing Mary and Mike have feelings for each other, nudges them together. Eventually, Mike tells Mary he is a changed man and proposes. Mary accepts.\n\nJim comes up with an idea to convert unused post-war Army barracks into much-needed housing. McKeever persuades him to bid for an Army camp on the outskirts of New York City. Jim and his friends raise money from hundreds of other ex-G.I.'s in the same predicament. O'Connor also wants the property, and a bidding war ensues before O'Connor finds out who his competitor is. To try to get rid of his daughter's suitor, he sees to it that the construction company Jim approaches about his conversion plan rejects it and instead offers him a well-paying job in Bolivia, on the condition that he be single.\n\nCelebrating [[Christmas Eve]] together, the residents are caught by two patrolmen, but McKeever convinces them to let the families stay until after the [[New Year]]. Jim then reveals that the camp has been sold to O'Connor, and he is considering the job offer in Bolivia, resulting in Trudy breaking up with him. When Mary and Trudy find out how Mike has manipulated the situation, Mary thinks he has not changed after all, and that she and Trudy will leave for Florida. Ashamed, Mike arranges a meeting with \"O'Connor\" for Jim and his partners, who are dubious but accept. At the meeting, Mike reveals his true identity and transfers ownership of the camp to them, provided that they not reveal his identity to McKeever.\n\nThat night, everyone shares a New Year's dinner before restoring the house just as they found it. Mike, Mary, Trudy and Jim bid farewell to McKeever as he heads off to O'Connor's estate in Virginia, still unaware of the truth. Mike tells Mary to remind him to nail up the board in the back fence through which McKeever gets onto his property, intending to have McKeever come through the front door next winter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Don DeFore]] as Jim Bullock\n* [[Gale Storm]] as Trudy O'Connor\n* [[Victor Moore]] as Aloyisius T.

''It Happened on 5th Avenue'' was Allied Artists' first production.  At a time when the average Hollywood picture cost about $800,000 (and the average Monogram picture cost about $90,000), the Christmas-themed comedy cost more than $1,200,000.<ref>\"Out Hollywood Way\", ''New York Times'', September 8, 1946, p.

She rehearsed them before filming started, but was told by director Roy Del Ruth that she would be mouthing to someone else's vocals. Storm, who had been the studio's musical star for years, recalled in her 1981 memoir: \"I couldn't believe it. I thought that maybe the director didn't know I'd been singing and dancing in films, and that if I spoke to him he'd let me do my own numbers. Well, I asked him, and he said no. I asked him to look at some of my musicals, and he said no. I asked him if I could sing for him, and he said no. His theory was that if you were a dancer, you didn't sing; if you were a singer, you didn't dance; and if you were an actor, you didn't sing ''or'' dance. It was humiliating.\"<ref> Gale Storm, ''I Ain't Down Yet'', Bobbs-Merrill, 1981.

Despite an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, a [[cult following]] through a dedicated fan website, and many requests to Turner Classic Movies and American Movie Classics to show the movie, it was not broadcast on American television for nearly 20 years. It aired on Turner Classic Movies in 2009 and beginning in 2014, it is broadcast frequently during the holiday season. Hallmark Movie Channel also broadcast the movie in 2014.\n\n==Home media==\nOn November 11, 2008, Warner Home Video released the film on DVD. In 2014, the film was made available for streaming and download in the digital format. On December 22, 2020, it was released on Blu-Ray by [[Warner Archive Collection]].
