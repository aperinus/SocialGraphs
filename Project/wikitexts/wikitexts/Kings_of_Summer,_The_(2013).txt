After a family game night that ends with Joe calling the cops on Frank for false reasons, he declares freedom once and for all. Escaping to a clearing he found in the woods with his best friend, Patrick,  also sick of his life at home with his annoying parents, and a strange kid named Biaggio who just happened to tag along.\n\nJoe announces that they are going to build a house there, free from responsibility and parents. Once their makeshift abode is finished, the three young men find themselves masters of their own destiny, alone in the woods. Joe declares himself and Biaggio to be the hunters, while Patrick gathers fruit. Several weeks pass and Patrick and Joe are reported missing, appearing on multiple news channels. Frank finds a Monopoly piece from the game night in Joe's bookbag that was left on a bus and believes that Joe is taunting him.\n\nConflict arises between Patrick and Joe when Joe invites his crush Kelly to come see the house they built. After a while, she takes a liking to Patrick and they begin a relationship. Joe passively confronts Patrick in a [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly game]] by teaming up with Biaggio to trade land and buy hotels in the orange Monopoly in front of Patrick's piece, leading him to lose on the very next turn.\n\nThe two get into a scuffle. Joe calls Kelly a \"cancer\" and a \"bitch\" who ruined the peace and harmony the three of them had and eventually makes her walk out of the house in despair. Joe, realizing that Patrick feels bad for Kelly, taunts him to go after her and stomps on his previously broken foot. Patrick leaves the house and goes after her, comforting her with a kiss. Biaggio, who has become good friends with Joe, is told to leave as well, leaving Joe to live alone.\n\nAbout a month later, Joe is still living alone in the woods. Short on money, he sets out to hunt his own food, eventually leading him to kill and eat a rabbit. Not disposing of the body properly, he attracts a snake into the house. Meanwhile, Kelly goes to a concerned Frank and offers to take him to Joe. When they arrive, they find him cornered by the venomous snake that appeared the night before.\n\nBiaggio asks his father, who is shaving, if you go to Hell for leaving your friend, to which his father replies \"Of course.\" Biaggio comes barging in the makeshift house and attempts to kill the snake with his machete, but is bitten by it on the ankle instead and collapses, becoming violently ill. Frank, Kelly and a mildly feral Joe rush Biaggio to the hospital. Joe and Frank reconcile. Biaggio survives and tells Joe that he saw heaven and if he had to do it all over again, he would do, but then changes his mind.\n\nJoe and Patrick's parents each drive them home. As they view each other from their respective cars, they flip each other off jokingly and part ways. The film ends showing shots of the house Joe, Patrick, and Biaggio built.\n\nAfter the credits, Biaggio is seen still residing in the house in the woods.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Nick Robinson (American actor)|Nick Robinson]] as Joe Toy\n*[[Gabriel Basso]] as Patrick Keenan\n*[[Mois\u00e9s Arias]] as Biaggio\n*[[Nick Offerman]] as Frank Toy\n*[[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]] as Kelly\n*[[Alison Brie]] as Heather Toy\n*[[Megan Mullally]] as Mrs. Keenan\n*[[Marc Evan Jackson]] as Mr. Keenan\n*[[Eugene Cordero]] as Colin\n*[[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Captain Davis\n*[[Thomas Middleditch]] as Rookie Cop\n*[[Nathan Keyes]] as Paul\n*[[Angela Trimbur]] as Face Paint\n*[[Kumail Nanjiani]] as Gary the Delivery Guy\n*[[Austin Abrams]] as Aaron\n*Craig Cackowski as Mr. Larson\n* [[Lili Reinhart]] as Vicki\n*Cristoffer Carter as Construction Kid\n*[[Hannibal Buress]] as Bus Driver\n*[[Tony Hale]] as Bus Passenger\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was director Vogt-Roberts' first [[feature film]] and was screenwriter Galletta's first produced script.<ref name=\"somalley\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-kings-of-summer-2013|first=Sheila|last=O'Malley|title=The Kings of Comedy|date=June 7, 2013|work=RogerEbert.com|access-date=2013-08-23}}</ref> Filming took place in the summer of 2012 in various locations across [[Ohio]], including [[Cleveland]], [[Chagrin Falls, Ohio|Chagrin Falls]], [[Lyndhurst, Ohio|Lyndhurst]] and [[South Pointe Hospital]] in [[Warrensville Heights, Ohio|Warrensville]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/why-filming-in-ohio-was-the-best-thing-ever-for-sundance-dar|title=Why Filming In Ohio Was The Best Thing Ever For Sundance Darling \"The Kings Of Summer\"|publisher=BuzzFeed|date=April 3, 2013|access-date=2013-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe soundtrack consists of music created by [[Ryan Miller (musician)|Ryan Miller]].

''The Kings of Summer'' flirts with profundity, seeming to yearn for it and fear the honest expression of it at the same time.
