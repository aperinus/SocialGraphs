It tells the story of a waitress trying to find romance while raising two daughters in a trailer park in a small desert town in [[New Mexico]]. It was adapted from the [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel ''Don't Look and It Won't Hurt'' by [[Richard Peck (writer)|Richard Peck]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Cineville]] and entered into the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Berlinale: 1992 Programme | url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/02_programm_1992/02_Programm_1992.html | accessdate=2011-05-24 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> Fairuza Balk won the 1993 [[Independent Spirit Award]] for best female lead for her role.\n\n==Plot==\nNora, a waitress with two teenage daughters, struggles to raise them in a trailer park as a single parent after her husband abandons the family. After repeatedly skipping school to go on dates, Trudi, the elder daughter, quits school and gets a job as a waitress alongside her mother. Meanwhile, the younger daughter, Shade, spends most of her time watching the movies of Mexican film star Elvia Rivero and dreams of finding a boyfriend for her mother.\n\nAfter being dumped by the boy she was seeing, Trudi meets Dank, a British [[petrology|petrologist]], at the restaurant where she's working. They eventually sleep together, and she tells him that her promiscuity is caused by the fact that she lost her virginity in a gang rape perpetrated by local boys she knew. Returning home the following night, her mother tells her that she has one month to find a new home because Trudi has slept with a man.\n\nShade tries to seduce Darius, her friend, by dressing up in a wig and costume \u00e0 la [[Olivia Newton-John]], Darius's supposed dream girl, at her sister's suggestion. After her seduction attempt fails, presumably because he is gay, she runs into Javier, the local projectionist, who teases her over her outfit before giving her a ride home on his bike. Afterwards she sets her mother up on a date with Raymond, a married man who was revealed earlier in the film to be having an intermittent affair with her mother. As they do not want to reveal their connection to the eavesdropping Shade, they make wry conversation where Raymond claims to work as a gravedigger and Nora as a brain surgeon.\n\nTrudi discovers she is pregnant with Dank's child, but when he fails to return from an expedition, decides to go to Dallas and give up her child for adoption rather than have an abortion. While Trudi is away, Nora begins an affair with Hamlet Humphrey, a man who installs satellite dishes, while the girls' biological father, John, reappears.\n\nShade falls in love with Javier and tries to reconnect with her father. Initially disturbed by Hamlet Humphrey, she warms to him after he reveals that he is familiar with the movies of Elvia Rivero and compares Nora to her.\n\nShade goes to Dallas with her mother and Hamlet for the birth of Trudi's baby. After giving birth to a daughter, Trudi tells Shade that she'll be staying in the city, as their home holds too many bad memories for her. On their way home, Shade spots a sign advertising [[Day-Glo Color Corp.|day-glo]] rocks like the one Dank gave her sister. She goes to confront Dank but instead learns that he was killed in an accident while looking for rocks. Walking off into the desert, Shade realizes that Dank always loved Trudi and vows to eventually tell her what happened.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] as Nora\n* [[Ione Skye]] as Trudi\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Shade\n* [[Robert Knepper]] as Dank\n* David Lansbury as Hamlet (David Landsbury)\n* [[Chris Mulkey]] as Raymond\n* [[Donovan Leitch (actor)|Donovan Leitch]] as Darius\n* Julie Condra as Tanya\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as Javier\n* [[Laurie O'Brien]] as Thelma\n* Adam Biesk as Brett\n* [[James Brolin]] as John Evans\n* [[J Mascis]] as Cecil\n\nIn addition, Adams' daughter, Josie Lynne, appears as Trudi at 2 years; Skye and Leitch are real life siblings.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack for ''Gas Food Lodging'' was released by [[Elektra Records]] containing 28 tracks.
