The four girls often play [[croquet]] in Veronica's backyard. Tired of the clique abusing its power, Veronica longs for her old life with her kinder but less popular friends. She becomes fascinated with Jason \"J.D.\" Dean, a new student and rebellious outsider, after he pulls out a gun and fires [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]] to scare football-player bullies Kurt Kelly and Ram Sweeney.\n\nVeronica attends a frat party with Chandler, where she refuses to have sex with one of the members (unlike Chandler, who was coerced to perform oral sex on one) and drunkenly vomits on Chandler. In retaliation, Chandler vows to destroy her reputation. Later that night, J.D. shows up by surprise at Veronica's house, and the two have sex outside. They express to each other their mutual hatred of Chandler's tyranny.\n\nThe next morning, Veronica and J.D. break into Chandler's house, planning to get revenge by using a fake hangover cure to make Chandler vomit. J.D. pours drain cleaner into a mug, but Veronica dismisses him, thinking he is making a mean joke. She mixes orange juice and milk together instead. However, Veronica accidentally brings the wrong mug to Chandler's room; J.D. notices this but says nothing. He serves Chandler the drain cleaner, killing her. Veronica panics, and J.D. urges her to forge a dramatic suicide note in Chandler's handwriting. The school and community regard Chandler's apparent suicide as a tragic decision made by a troubled teenager, making her even more worshipped in death than in life. Meanwhile, Duke uses the attention surrounding Chandler's death to gain popularity, becoming the clique's new leader.\n\nAfter Chandler's funeral, McNamara convinces Veronica to go with her, Kurt, and Ram on a double date. J.D. finds the four teens that evening in a field, and Veronica leaves with him as Kurt passes out, while Ram rapes McNamara. The following day, the boys spread a false rumor about Veronica performing oral sex on them, ruining her reputation. J.D. proposes that he and Veronica lure the boys into the woods, shoot them with tranquilizers, and humiliate them by staging the scene to look like they were lovers participating in a [[suicide pact]]. \n\nIn the forest, J.D. shoots Ram, but Veronica's shot misses Kurt, who runs away. J.D. chases Kurt back towards Veronica who, realizing that the bullets are in fact lethal, fatally shoots him in a panic. J.D. and Veronica are nearly caught by police, but they make out in a station wagon to pretend they were there all along and had nothing to do with it. At their funeral, the boys are made into [[martyr]]s to [[homophobia]]. Growing increasingly disturbed by J.D.'s behavior (behavior which may be influenced by his mother's suicide and his sociopathic wealthy father's abuse of people), Veronica breaks up with him.\n\nA little while after this, J.D. blackmails Duke into getting every student to sign a \"petition\" that, unbeknownst to her, is intended to act as a [[mass suicide]] note. He then gives her a red [[scrunchie]] that Chandler had worn, signifying her new power over the school. Meanwhile, Martha Dunnstock, a large girl who is a frequent target of bullying, pins a suicide note to her chest and walks into oncoming traffic. She survives but is badly injured and mocked by her peers for attempting to copy the popular kids. Later, McNamara calls a radio show to discuss her depression; Duke tells the entire school about the radio call the next day, and McNamara is bullied. McNamara attempts suicide by overdosing in the girls' bathroom, but Veronica intervenes.\n\nVeronica returns home, and her parents say that J.D. stopped by to tell them that he was worried she would attempt suicide. He leaves a note revealing he can successfully imitate her handwriting, and a Barbie doll hanging in her room. J.D. breaks into Veronica's house with a plan to kill Heather Duke, but the murder is revealed to be a dream sequence. Realizing that J.D. plans to kill her, she fakes her own suicide-by-hanging. J.D. finds her and, assuming she is dead, gives a monologue revealing his plan to blow up the school [[pep rally]] and make it look like a mass suicide. \n\nThe next day, Veronica confronts J.D. in the boiler room as he plants dynamite. She shoots him, and his switchblade cuts the wires to the detonator. Veronica goes outside, and J.D. follows her with a bomb strapped to his chest. He offers a personal eulogy and detonates the bomb, killing himself. As students and faculty rush outside to see what happened, Veronica walks back inside, dirty and disheveled from the explosion. She approaches Duke, takes the red scrunchie, and asserts that Duke is no longer in charge. Veronica then invites Martha to spend prom night watching movies together, as Duke looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Veronica Sawyer\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Jason \"J.D.\" Dean\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as Heather Duke\n* [[Lisanne Falk]] as Heather McNamara\n* [[Kim Walker (actress)|Kim Walker]] as Heather Chandler\n* [[Penelope Milford]] as Pauline Fleming\n* [[Glenn Shadix]] as Father Ripper\n* Lance Fenton as Kurt Kelly\n* [[Patrick Labyorteaux]] as Ram Sweeney\n* Jeremy Applegate as Peter Dawson\n* Em Lodge as M.C.
