The film also co-stars [[Arsenio Hall]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Shari Headley]], and [[John Amos]]. The film was released in the United States on June 29, 1988. Eddie Murphy plays Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African nation of Zamunda, who travels to the [[United States]] in the hopes of finding a woman he can marry and love for who she is, not for her status or for having been trained to please him.\n\nIn 1989, a [[Coming to America (TV pilot)|pilot]] for a planned [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] television series was made, although this was never picked up for a series.<ref name=\"splinter_spinoff\">{{cite web|url=http://splinternews.com/reminder-a-terrible-coming-to-america-tv-pilot-happene-1793852530|title=Reminder: A terrible 'Coming to America' TV pilot happened in 1989|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Molly|date=April 11, 2015|website=[[Splinter News]]|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Coming 2 America]]'', was released on March 4, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the wealthy African nation of Zamunda, [[crown prince]] Akeem Joffer grows weary of his pampered lifestyle on his 21st birthday and wishes to do more for himself. When his parents, King Jaffe and Queen Aoleon, present him with [[Arranged marriage|an arranged bride-to-be]], Akeem takes action. Seeking an independent woman who loves him for himself and not his social status, Akeem and his best friend/personal aide, Semmi, travel to the New York City borough of Queens and rent a squalid tenement in the neighborhood of Long Island City under the guise of poor foreign students.\n\nBeginning their search for Akeem's bride, they end up being invited by some locals to a rally raising money for the inner city. During the rally, Akeem encounters Lisa McDowell, who possesses all the qualities he is looking for in a woman. So, upon his insistence, he and Semmi get entry-level jobs working at the local fast-food restaurant called McDowell's, a [[McDonald's]] knockoff owned by widower Cleo McDowell, Lisa's father.\n\nAkeem's attempts to win Lisa's love are complicated by Lisa's lazy and obnoxious boyfriend, Darryl Jenks, whose father owns Soul Glo (a [[Jheri curl]]\u2013like hairstyling aid). After Darryl announces their engagement\u2014without Lisa's consent\u2014to their families, she starts dating Akeem, who claims that he comes from a family of poor goat herders.\n\nMeanwhile, although Akeem thrives on hard work and learning how commoners live, Semmi is not comfortable with living in such meager conditions. After a dinner date with Lisa is thwarted when Semmi furnishes their apartment with a hot tub and other luxuries, Akeem confiscates his money and donates it to [[Trading Places|two homeless men]]. Semmi wires a telegraph to King Jaffe for more money, prompting the Joffers to travel to Queens to find him.\n\nCleo initially disapproves of Akeem, as he believes he is poor and therefore not good enough for his daughter. He becomes ecstatic when he discovers that Akeem is actually an extremely wealthy prince, after meeting the Joffers. When Akeem discovers that his parents have arrived in NYC, he and Lisa go to the McDowell residence to lie low where Cleo welcomes them. After Cleo's bond with Akeem is ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Zamundan entourage, Lisa later becomes angry and confused that Akeem lied to her about his identity. Akeem explains that he wanted her to love him for who, not what, he is, even offering to renounce his throne, but Lisa, still hurt and angry, refuses to marry him. Despondent, Akeem resigns himself to the arranged marriage, but as they leave, Jaffe is reprimanded by Aoleon for clinging to outdated traditions instead of thinking of their son's happiness.\n\nAt the wedding procession, a still-heartbroken Akeem becomes surprised when his veiled bride is Lisa herself. Following the ceremony, they ride happily in a carriage to the cheers of Zamundans. Witnessing such splendor, Lisa is both surprised and touched by the fact that Akeem would have given it up just for her. Akeem offers again to abdicate if she does not want this life, but Lisa playfully declines.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- bulleted cast per opening credits --->\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as:\n** Prince Akeem Joffer, the prince of Zamunda\n** Randy Watson, a soul singer with the fictional band Sexual Chocolate.\n** Saul, the [[Judaism|Jewish]] barbershop customer\n** Clarence, the owner of the barber shop.\n* [[Arsenio Hall]] as:\n** Semmi, Akeem's friend\n** Reverend Brown\n** Morris the barber\n** Extremely Ugly Girl, an unattractive female clubgoer.\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as King Jaffe Joffer, Akeem's father and King of Zamunda.\n* [[John Amos]] as Cleo McDowell, Akeem's employer and Lisa's father.\n* [[Madge Sinclair]] as Queen Aoleon Joffer, Akeem's mother and the Queen of Zamunda.\n* [[Shari Headley]] as Lisa McDowell, Cleo's older daughter and Akeem's love interest.\n* Clint Smith as Sweets the barber.\n* Paul Bates as Oha, a royal servant.\n* [[Eriq La Salle]] as Darryl Jenks, Lisa's boyfriend whom she eventually breaks up with.\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as the landlord who manages the apartment building where Akeem and Semmi live.\n* [[Vanessa Bell Calloway|Vanessa Bell]] as Imani Izzi, betrothed as Akeem's intended wife.\n* [[Louie Anderson]] as Maurice, a McDowell's employee.\n* Allison Dean as Patrice McDowell, Cleo's younger daughter and Lisa's sister.\n* Sheila Johnson<!--- do not link to the billionaire American businesswoman ---> as a lady-in-waiting.\n* [[Jake Steinfeld]] as a cab driver.\n* [[Calvin Lockhart]] as Colonel Izzi, Imani's father\n* [[Samuel L.

The two men had previously worked together on the comedy hit ''Trading Places''. Landis recalled the differences in working with Murphy on the two movies: \"The guy on ''Trading Places'' was young and full of energy and curious and funny and fresh and great.
