''Candy'' was directed by debut filmmaker [[Neil Armfield]] and stars [[Heath Ledger]], [[Abbie Cornish]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]].\n\n''Candy'', produced by [[Margaret Fink]], was released in Australia on 25 May 2006 and subsequently released around the world.\n\n==Plot==\nThere are three acts of roughly three scenes each, [[Heaven]], [[Earth]], and [[Hell]]. A poet named Dan and an art student named Candy fall passionately in love, as Candy gravitates to her [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle and love of heroin. Hooked as much on one another as they are on the drug, their relationship is alternating states of bliss, oblivion, self-destruction, and despair.\n\nHeaven: the young lovers ecstatically experience sex, devotion, and heroin. Constantly seeking drug money, they borrow from Candy's parents or eccentric university professor Casper, then steal, then when Candy sells her grandmother's ring, she has sex with a smelly pawn shop owner for $50.\n\nEarth: they marry and confront the realities of addiction and family life. Dan purchases the drugs; Candy prostitutes. While considering having sex with men in a park bathroom for money, Dan steals a credit card and scams the owner for his [[personal identification number|PIN]], taking $7000. Candy becomes pregnant, and despite a few days of tortuously \"[[cold turkey|going clean]]\", their baby is delivered stillborn at 23 weeks. They return to heroin, but stop again, going through agonizing [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms in the process. Despite poor living conditions, constant struggles for money, and frequent disputes, the pair remain entangled in a relationship fueled by love and addiction.\n\nHell: The dissolution of their relationship and recovery. They choose to move to the country to \"try [[methadone]]\" as a way to ease into a more normal life and eventually quit drugs altogether. After a disastrous attempt to have Candy's parents over for Sunday lunch, Candy screams at her mother about how she is the cause for Candy to \"never have been able to unclench [her] fists\". After Dan returns home one day from working as a bricklayer, he finds Candy smoking pot with a new guy and watches as she later leaves to have sex with him. When she returns she screams at Dan about how much she hates him and wants him to go away. He leaves, and when he returns the walls of every room of the house are covered with poems about Dan and Candy that she has written in smeared makeup. Distressed, he seeks Casper again and does heroin with him. Dan is informed the next morning of Candy's hospitalization back in Sydney, where he finds her in the aftermath of a nervous breakdown. Dan returns to Casper's only to find him dead of a heroin overdose. This forces Dan to reconsider his life. While Candy recovers in a treatment clinic, Dan gets clean and finds a job washing dishes at a restaurant while still horribly missing Candy. But when Candy finishes treatment and comes to the restaurant to finish off where they started, he cries and says \"There's no going back. If you're given a reprieve, I think it's good to remember just how thin it is.\" She subsequently leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Abbie Cornish]] as Candy\n*[[Heath Ledger]] as Dan\n*[[Geoffrey Rush]] as Casper \n*[[Tom Budge]] as Schumann\n*Roberto Meza Mont as Jorge\n*[[Tony Martin (Australian actor)|Tony Martin]] as Jim Wyatt\n*[[Noni Hazlehurst]] as Elaine Wyatt\n*[[Tim McKenzie (Australian actor)|Tim McKenzie]] as Uncle Rod\n*[[Tara Morice]] as Aunt Katherine\n*Maddi Newling as Janey\n*[[Cristian Castillo]] as Little Angelo\n*[[Paul Blackwell (actor)|Paul Blackwell]] as Phillip Dudley\n*[[Adrienne Pickering]] as bank teller\n*[[Nathaniel Dean]] as Paul Hillman\n*Alicia Hannah as neighbour\n*[[Luke Davies]] as a milkman\n\n==Music==\nThe film features a version of the [[Tim Buckley]] song \"[[Song to the Siren (Tim Buckley song)|Song to the Siren]]\", sung by actress/singer [[Paula Arundell]].
