The original version was restored and released in 1997.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Los Angeles]] private detective [[Philip Marlowe]] is summoned to the mansion of General Sternwood, who wants to resolve \"gambling debts\" that his daughter Carmen owes to bookseller Arthur Geiger. As Marlowe is leaving, Sternwood's older daughter Vivian stops him. She suspects her father's true motive for hiring a detective is to find his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Sean Regan who had disappeared a month earlier.\n\nMarlowe goes to Geiger's shop, which is minded by Agnes Louzier, and then follows Geiger home. Hearing a gunshot and a woman's scream, he breaks in to find Geiger's body and a drugged Carmen, as well as a hidden camera empty of film. After taking Carmen home, he returns and discovers that the body has disappeared. During the night, Marlowe learns that Sternwood's driver, Owen Taylor, has been found dead in a limo floating off the Lido Pier, having been struck on the back of the head.\n\n[[File:Bogart_and_Bacall_The_Big_Sleep.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Philip Marlowe (Bogart) and Vivian Rutledge (Bacall) eye to eye]]\n\nVivian comes to Marlowe's office the next morning with scandalous pictures of Carmen that she received with a [[blackmail]] demand for the negatives. Marlowe returns to Geiger's book store and follows a car to the apartment of Joe Brody, a gambler who previously blackmailed General Sternwood. He then finds Carmen in Geiger's house, where she insists that it was Brody who killed Geiger. They are interrupted by the landlord, gangster Eddie Mars.\n\nMarlowe goes to Brody's apartment, where he finds Agnes and Vivian. They are interrupted by Carmen, who wants her photos. Marlowe disarms her and sends Vivian and Carmen home. Brody admits that it was he who was behind the blackmailing, having stolen the negatives from Taylor but then has to answer the door and is shot. Marlowe chases the killer and apprehends Carol Lundgren, Geiger's former driver, who believes Brody is swindling him. Marlowe calls the police to arrest Lundgren.\n\nMarlowe visits Mars' casino where he asks about Regan, who is supposed to have run off with Mars' wife. Mars is evasive and tells Marlowe that Vivian is running up gambling debts. Vivian wins a big wager and then wants Marlowe to take her home. A stooge of Mars' attempts to rob Vivian but Marlowe knocks him out. While driving back, Marlowe presses Vivian on her connection with Mars but she admits nothing. Back at home, Marlowe finds a flirtatious Carmen waiting for him. She says she did not like Regan and mentions that Mars calls Vivian frequently.  When she attempts to seduce Marlowe, he throws her out. The next day, Vivian tells him he can stop looking for Regan; he has been found in Mexico and she is going to see him.\n\nMars has Marlowe beaten up to stop him investigating further. He is found by Harry Jones; an associate of Agnes and besotted with her. Jones conveys her offer to reveal the location of Mars' wife for $200. When Marlowe goes to meet him and be taken to where she is hiding, he spots Canino, a gunman hired by Mars, who is there to find Agnes.  As Marlowe watches from hiding, Canino threatens Jones until Jones tells him Agnes's location.  Canino then forces Jones to have a \"drink\" which turns out to be poison.  Afterward, Marlowe discovers that Jones lied about Agnes's location.\n\nAgnes telephones the office while Marlowe is still there and he arranges to meet her. She has seen Mona Mars behind an auto repair shop near a town called Realito. When he gets there, Marlowe is attacked by Canino. He awakes tied up, with Mona watching over him. Vivian is there too and frees Marlowe, allowing him to get to his gun and kill Canino. They drive back together and Marlowe calls Mars from Geiger's house, pretending to be still in Realito.\n\nMars arrives with four men, who set up an ambush outside. When Mars enters, Marlowe reveals that he has discerned the truth: Mars has been blackmailing Vivian, as her sister Carmen had killed Regan. He then forces Mars outside, where he is shot by his own men. Marlowe then calls the police, telling them that Mars was the one who killed Regan. He also convinces Vivian that her sister needs psychiatric care.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Big Sleep - Behind the scenes 02.JPG|thumb|Cast of ''The Big Sleep'' between scenes]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as [[Philip Marlowe]]\n* [[Lauren Bacall]] as Vivian Sternwood Rutledge\n* [[John Ridgely]] as Eddie Mars\n* [[Martha Vickers]] as Carmen Sternwood\n* [[Sonia Darrin]] as Agnes Lowzier (uncredited)<ref>all uncredited actors listed in: [https://books.google.de/books?id=WRD9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=tommy+rafferty+big+sleep&source=bl&ots=ZQ5KEyjcRo&sig=ACfU3U3yUqEVS7xjFsMvRJFfecoQHWG30Q&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjrk5-kw4DyAhVP26QKHU0zAQsQ6AEwCXoECBwQAw#v=onepage&q=tommy%20rafferty%20big%20sleep&f=false The Big Sleep], [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], 2020, p. 77</ref>\n* [[Dorothy Malone]] as Acme Bookstore proprietress\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls\n* [[Peggy Knudsen]] as Mona Mars\n* [[Charles Waldron]] as General Sternwood\n* [[Charles D.

The writing had to be acceptable to the [[Hays Office]] censorship, which was vehement about excluding sexual themes.<ref name=Hays>{{Cite web |url=http://www.artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html |title=The Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 (Hays Code) |access-date=2010-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222092920/http://artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html |archive-date=2011-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the novel, Geiger is selling [[pornography]], illegal then and associated with organized crime, and is a homosexual having a relationship with Lundgren. Carmen is described as being nude in Geiger's house and later nude and in Marlowe's bed. To pass the censorship, changes were made; Carmen had to be fully dressed and the pornographic elements could only be alluded to with cryptic references to photographs of Carmen wearing a \"Chinese dress\" and sitting in a \"Chinese chair\". The [[sexual orientation]] of Geiger and Lundgren goes unmentioned in the film because explicit references to homosexuality were prohibited.<ref name=Hays/>\n\nThe scene of Carmen in Marlowe's bed was replaced with a scene in which she appears, fully dressed, sitting in Marlowe's apartment, when he promptly kicks her out. The scene, shot in 1944, was entirely omitted in the 1945 cut but restored for the 1946 version.<ref name=Hays/> ''The Big Sleep'' is known for its convoluted plot. During filming, neither the director nor the cast knew whether the chauffeur Owen Taylor had killed himself or was murdered.<ref>{{cite news |last=Monaco |first=James |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/notes-big-sleep-30-years-after |title=From the S&S archives: Notes on The Big Sleep, 30 years after |work=Sight & Sound |issue=Winter 1974/75 |date=August 14, 2014 |access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref> A cable was sent to Chandler, who told his friend Jamie Hamilton in a March 21, 1949 letter: \"They sent me a wire ... asking me, and dammit I didn't know either\".<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Hiney|editor1-first=T.|editor2-last=MacShane|editor2-first=F.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imQoKJKgYoQC&pg=PT103|title=The Raymond Chandler Papers|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|year=2000|page=103|isbn=9780802194336}}</ref>\n\n[[Warner Bros.]] studio head [[Jack L.

Because the war was ending, the studio feared the public might lose interest in the films, while ''The Big Sleep''{{'s}} subject was timeless. Indications of the film's wartime production include period dialogue, pictures of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and a woman taxi driver, who says to Bogart, \"I'm your girl\".  [[Rationing in the United States#World War II|Wartime rationing]] influences the film: dead bodies are called \"red points\", which referred to wartime meat rationing and Marlowe's car has a \"B\" gasoline rationing sticker in the lower passenger-side window, indicating he is essential to the war effort and therefore allowed eight gallons of gasoline per week.\n\nThe \"Bogie and Bacall\" phenomenon, a fascination with the couple that began with ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'', was well developed by the end of the war. Bacall's agent, [[Charles K. Feldman]], asked that portions of the film be re-shot to capitalize on their chemistry and counteract the poor reviews Bacall had received for her performance in ''[[Confidential Agent]]'' (1945) which was released prior to ''The Big Sleep'', even though it was produced after the original principal photography.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/09/movies/mystery-of-the-big-sleep-solved.html |title=Mystery of 'The Big Sleep' Solved |author=William Grimes |author-link=William Grimes (journalist) |date=9 January 1997 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Jack Warner agreed and new scenes for ''The Big Sleep'', such as the sexually suggestive racehorse dialogue, were added (scripted by an uncredited [[Julius J.

The parts of [[James Flavin]] and [[Thomas E. Jackson]] were eliminated. Because of the two versions created by the re-shooting, there is a substantial difference in content of some twenty minutes between them, although the difference in running time is only two minutes. Chandler said Martha Vickers (Carmen) overshadowed Lauren Bacall (Vivian) in their scenes together, which led to the producers deleting much of Vickers' performance to enhance Bacall's.<ref>Hiney, T. and MacShane, F. \"The Raymond Chandler Papers\", Letter to Jamie Hamilton, 30 May 1946, page 67, Atlantic Monthly Press, 2000</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe re-shot, re-edited and revised ''The Big Sleep'' was released on 23 August 1946. The cinematic release is regarded as more successful than the 1945 pre-release version (see below), even though it is difficult to follow. Audiences' difficulty in following this version of the film may be due in part to the omission of a long conversation between Marlowe and the Los Angeles District Attorney where the facts of the case, thus far, are laid out. Yet some film critics prefer the 1946 version because they consider the Bogart-Bacall appearances more important than a well-told story. For an example of this point of view, see Roger Ebert's [[The Great Movies]] essay on the film.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-big-sleep-1946|title=The Big Sleep (1946)|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link= Roger Ebert|date=June 22, 1997|access-date=2009-12-16|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> According to Warner Bros records the film earned $3,493,000 domestically and $1,375,000 foreign.<ref name=\"warners\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\n\n====1946 version====\nAt the time of its 1946 release, [[Bosley Crowther]] said the film leaves the viewer \"confused and dissatisfied\", points out that Bacall is a \"dangerous looking female\" ...\"who still hasn't learned to act\" and notes:\n\n<blockquote>''The Big Sleep'' is one of those pictures in which so many cryptic things occur amid so much involved and devious plotting that the mind becomes utterly confused. And, to make it more aggravating, the brilliant detective in the case is continuously making shrewd deductions which he stubbornly keeps to himself. What with two interlocking mysteries and a great many characters involved, the complex of blackmail and murder soon becomes a web of utter bafflement. Unfortunately, the cunning script-writers have done little to clear it at the end.<ref>{{cite news| title=''The Big Sleep'', Warner Film in Which Bogart and Bacall Are Paired Again | url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F00E5DB143FE73ABC4C51DFBE66838D659EDE | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | last=Crowther | first=Bosley | author-link=Bosley Crowther | date=August 24, 1946 | access-date=2009-12-16}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' film critic [[James Agee]] called the film \"wakeful fare for folks who don't care what is going on, or why, so long as the talk is hard and the action harder\" but insists that \"the plot's crazily mystifying, nightmare blur is an asset, and only one of many\"; it calls Bogart \"by far the strongest\" of its assets and says Hawks, \"even on the chaste screen...manages to get down a good deal of the glamorous tawdriness of big-city low life, discreetly laced with hints of dope addiction, voyeurism and fornication\" and characterizing Lauren Bacall's role as \"an adolescent cougar\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933610,00.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110219213427/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933610,00.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= February 19, 2011|title=Cinema: The New Pictures, August 26, 1946|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 26, 1946|access-date=2009-12-16}}</ref>\n\n====1997 release of the 1945 original cut====\nIn the mid-1990s, a pre-release version\u2014director Hawks's original cut\u2014was found in the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].

Ebert preferred the 1946 version and said,\n\n<blockquote>The new scenes [of the 1946 version] add a charge to the film that was missing in the 1945 version; this is a case where \"studio interference\" was exactly the right thing. The only reason to see the earlier version is to go behind the scenes, to learn how the tone and impact of a movie can be altered with just a few scenes... As for the 1946 version that we have been watching all of these years, it is one of the great films noir, a black-and-white symphony that exactly reproduces Chandler's ability, on the page, to find a tone of voice that keeps its distance, and yet is wry and humorous and cares.<ref name=\"ebert\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn a 1997 review, Eric Brace of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the 1945 original had a \"slightly slower pace than the one released a year later and a touch less zingy interplay between Bogart and Bacall, but it's still an unqualified masterpiece\".<ref name=\"washpost\">{{cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/review97/bigsleepbrace.htm | title= The Original 'Big Sleep': Rise and Shine | last=Brace | first= Eric| date=April 25, 1997 | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | access-date=2009-12-16}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Awards and honors}}\nIn 2003, [[American Film Institute|AFI]] named Philip Marlowe the [[AFI's 100 Years\u2026100 Heroes and Villains|32nd greatest hero in film]].<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains |url=http://www.afi.com/100Years/handv.aspx |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date=2003|access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref> The film placed 202nd on the 2012 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics' poll of the greatest films ever made and also received two directors' votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a52249e/sightandsoundpoll2012 |title=Votes for The Big Sleep (1946) |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=December 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{Anchor|DVD}}\nA region-1 (U.S. and Canada) DVD version of ''The Big Sleep'' was released in 2000.<ref>{{cite video|medium=DVD|title=The Big Sleep|publisher=Warner Home Video|date=February 15, 2000}} 114 minutes.
