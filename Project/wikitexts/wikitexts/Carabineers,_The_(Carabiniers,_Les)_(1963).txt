Ulysses ([[Marino Mase]]) and Michelangelo ([[Albert Juross]]) receive letters from the king of their fictional country that allow them to have complete freedom from consequence while fighting in the war, in return for anything they desire\u2014swimming pools, [[Maserati]]s, women\u2014at the enemy's expense.\n\nTheir wives, Venus and Cleopatra ([[Catherine Ribeiro]] and [[Genevieve Galea]]) encourage them to fight when they hear about the riches.  They leave and cross the battlefields and villages, destroying and pillaging as they wish. The pair's exploits are recounted through postcards sent to their wives, telling tales of the horrors of battle. The previously idealistic idea that the men have of war disintegrates, as they are still poor and now wounded. They return home with a suitcase full of postcards of the splendors of the world that they have fought for, and are told by army officials that they must wait until the war ends to receive their pay.\n\nOne day, the sky explodes with sparks, and the couples race into town, believing that the war has ended. Ulysses and Michelangelo are informed by their superiors that their king has lost the war, and that all of the war criminals must be punished. The two men are then shot for their crimes.\n\n==Critical responses==\nWriting about the film in ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers Magazine]]'' in 1969, the critic [[Pauline Kael]] declared it, \"hell to watch for the first hour...exciting to think about after because its one good sequence, the long picture-postcard sequence near the end, is so incredible and so brilliantly prolonged. The picture has been crawling and stumbling along and then it climbs a high wire and walks it and keeps walking it until we're almost dizzy from admiration. The tight rope is rarely stretched so high in movies...\"<ref>Pauline Kael, writing in her essay \"Trash, Art, and the Movies\" from ''Harpers Magazine'', February 1969, reprinted in her collection ''[[Going Steady (book)|Going Steady]]'' {{ISBN|0-7145-2976-1}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe renowned author and critic [[Susan Sontag]] referenced the film in her 1977 collection of essays ''[[On Photography]]''. With respect to the \"two sluggish lumpen-peasants\" returning home bearing postcards of the treasures of the world instead of tangible treasure, Sontag noted that \"Godard's gag vividly parodies the equivocal magic of the photographic image.\"<ref>Sontag, Susan (1977) \"On Photography\", Penguin, London''</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0056905|title=Les Carabiniers}}\n\n{{Jean-Luc Godard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carabiniers}}\n[[Category:1963 films]]\n[[Category:French war comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1960s French-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jean-Luc Godard]]\n[[Category:Anti-war films]]\n[[Category:Films set in a fictional country]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Carlo Ponti]]\n[[Category:1960s political films]]\n[[Category:1963 war films]]\n[[Category:1960s French films]]\n\n\n{{1960s-France-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
