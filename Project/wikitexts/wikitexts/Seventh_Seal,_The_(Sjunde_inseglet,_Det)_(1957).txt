Bergman developed the film from his own play ''Wood Painting''. The title refers to a passage from the [[Book of Revelation]], used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \"And when [[Lamb of God|the Lamb]] had opened the [[Seven seals|seventh seal]], there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\".{{bibleref2c|Rev.|8:1|KJV}} Here, the motif of silence refers to the \"silence of God\", which is a major theme of the film.{{sfn|Bragg|1998|p=45}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1171-the-seventh-seal-there-go-the-clowns |title=''The Seventh Seal'': There Go the Clowns |last=Giddins |first=Gary |publisher=The Criterion Collection |date=15 June 2009 |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n''The Seventh Seal'' is considered a classic of [[world cinema]], as well as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest movies of all time]]. It established Bergman as a world-renowned director, containing scenes which have become iconic through homages, critical analysis, and parodies.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nDisillusioned knight Antonius Block and his cynical [[squire]] J\u00f6ns return from the [[Crusades]] to find the country ravaged by [[Black Death|the plague]]. The knight encounters Death, whom he challenges to a [[chess]] match, believing he can survive as long as the game continues. The game they start continues throughout the story.\n\n[[File:Ingmar Bergman-The Seventh Seal-01.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Death and Antonius Block choose sides for the chess game]]\nThe knight and his squire pass a caravan of actors: Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son Mikael and actor-manager Jonas Skat. Waking early, Jof has [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|a vision of Mary leading the infant Jesus]], which he relates to a smilingly-disbelieving Mia.\n\nBlock and J\u00f6ns visit a church where a fresco of the ''[[Danse Macabre]]'' is being painted, and the squire chides the artist for colluding in the ideological fervor that led to the crusade. In the [[confessional]], Block tells the priest he wants to perform \"one meaningful deed\" after what he now sees as a pointless life. Upon revealing to him the [[chess tactic]] that will save his life, the knight discovers that it is actually Death with whom he has been speaking. Leaving the church, Block speaks to a young woman condemned to be [[burned at the stake]] for consorting with [[the devil]]. He believes she will tell him about life beyond death, only to find that she is insane.\n\nIn a deserted village, J\u00f6ns saves a mute servant girl from being [[rape]]d by Raval, a theologian who ten years earlier persuaded the knight to join the Crusades and is now a thief. J\u00f6ns vows to destroy his face if they meet again. J\u00f6ns kidnaps the servant girl and they go into town, where the actors are performing. There, Skat is enticed away for a tryst by Lisa, wife of the blacksmith Plog. The stage show is interrupted by a procession of [[flagellants]] led by a preacher who harangues the townspeople.\n\nAt the town's inn, Raval manipulates Plog and other customers into intimidating Jof. The bullying is broken up by J\u00f6ns, who slashes Raval's face. The knight and squire are joined by Jof's family and a repentant Plog. Block enjoys a picnic of milk and wild strawberries that Mia has gathered and declares, \"I'll carry this memory between my hands as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk... And it will be an adequate sign \u2014 it will be enough for me.\"\n\nBlock now invites Plog and the actors to shelter from the plague in his castle. When they encounter Skat and Lisa in the forest, she returns to Plog, while Skat fakes a remorseful suicide. As the group moves on, Skat climbs a tree to spend the night, but Death appears beneath and cuts down the tree.\n\nMeeting the condemned woman being drawn to execution, Block asks her to summon [[Satan]] so he can question him about God. The girl claims she has done so, but the knight only sees her terror and gives her herbs to take away her pain as she is placed on the pyre.\n\n[[File:Det-sjunde-inseglet-The-Seventh-Seal-Bergman-1957-dance-of-death.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The final scene depicting the ''[[Danse Macabre]]'']]\nThey encounter Raval, stricken by the plague. J\u00f6ns stops the servant girl from uselessly bringing him water, and Raval dies alone. Jof tells his wife that he can see the knight playing chess with Death and decides to flee with his family, while Block knowingly keeps Death occupied.\n\nAs Death states \"No one escapes me\", Block knocks the chess pieces over but Death restores them to their place. On the next move, Death wins the game and announces that when they meet again, it will be the last time for all. Death then asks Block if he achieved the \"meaningful deed\" he wished to accomplish and the knight replies that he has.\n\nBlock is reunited with his wife and the party shares a final supper, interrupted by Death's arrival. The rest of the party then introduce themselves, and the mute servant girl greets him with \"It is finished.\"\n\nJof and his family have sheltered in their caravan from a storm, which he interprets as the Angel of Death passing by. In the morning, Jof's [[second sight]] allows him to see the knight and his companions being led away over the hillside in a wild Dance of Death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand]] \u2013 J\u00f6ns, squire\n* [[Bengt Ekerot]] \u2013 Death\n* [[Nils Poppe]] \u2013 Jof\n* [[Max von Sydow]] \u2013 Antonius Block, knight\n* [[Bibi Andersson]] \u2013 Mia, Jof's wife\n* [[Inga Landgr\u00e9]] \u2013 Karin, Block's wife\n* [[\u00c5ke Fridell]] \u2013 Blacksmith Plog\n* [[Inga Gill]] \u2013 Lisa, blacksmith's wife\n* [[Erik Strandmark]] \u2013 Jonas Skat\n* [[Bertil Anderberg]] \u2013 Raval, the thief\n* [[Gunnel Lindblom]] \u2013 Mute girl\n* [[Maud Hansson]] \u2013 Witch\n* [[Gunnar Olsson (actor)|Gunnar Olsson]] \u2013 [[Albertus Pictor]], church painter\n* [[Anders Ek]] \u2013 The Monk\n* [[Benkt-\u00c5ke Benktsson]] \u2013 Merchant\n* [[Gudrun Brost]] \u2013 Maid\n* Lars Lind \u2013 Young monk\n* Tor Borong \u2013 Farmer\n* Harry Asklund \u2013 Inn keeper\n* [[Ulf Johanson]] \u2013 Jack's leader (uncredited)\n{{div col end|3}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sjunde inseglet 1957.jpg|thumbnail|Filming of ''The Seventh Seal'' at [[Filmstaden]]]]\n[[Ingmar Bergman]] originally wrote the play ''Tr\u00e4m\u00e5lning'' (''Wood Painting'') in 1953 / 1954 for the acting students of [[Malm\u00f6 City Theatre]].

A camera with no sound was set up and the picture shot before the cloud dissolved.\"<ref>Ingmar Bergman (1988). ''The Magic Lantern''. Penguin Books. London. pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\n==Portrait of the Middle Ages==\nMedieval Sweden as portrayed in this movie includes creative anachronisms. The [[flagellant]] movement was foreign to Sweden, and large-scale [[Witch-hunt|witch persecutions]] only began in the 15th century.<ref>Said by Swedish historian [[Dick Harrison]] in an introduction to the movie on [[Sveriges Television]], 2005. Reiterated in his book ''Gud vill det!'' {{ISBN|91-7037-119-9}}</ref> In addition, the main period of the [[Crusades]] is well before this era; they took place in a more optimistic period.<ref name=\"Tuchman\"/>\n\nWith regard to the relevancy of historical accuracy to a film that is heavily metaphorical and allegorical, John Aberth, writing in ''A Knight at the Movies'', holds\n<blockquote>\nthe film only partially succeeds in conveying the period atmosphere and thought world of the fourteenth century. Bergman would probably counter that it was never his intention to make an historical or period film. As it was written in a program note that accompanied the movie's premier \"It is a modern poem presented with medieval material that has been very freely handled... The script in particular\u2014embodies a mid-twentieth century existentialist angst... Still, to be fair to Bergman, one must allow him his artistic license, and the script's modernisms may be justified as giving the movie's medieval theme a compelling and urgent contemporary relevance... Yet the film succeeds to a large degree because it is set in the Middle Ages, a time that can seem both very remote and very immediate to us living in the modern world... Ultimately ''The Seventh Seal'' should be judged as a historical film by how well it combines the medieval and the modern.\"<ref>John Aberth (2003). ''A Knight at the Movies''. Routledge. pp. 217\u2013218.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[Image:Taby kyrka Death playing chess.jpg|thumb|upright|Death playing chess, from [[T\u00e4by Church]], fresco by [[Albertus Pictor]]]]\n\nSimilarly defending it as an allegory, Aleksander Kwiatkowski in the book ''Swedish Film Classics'', writes\n<blockquote>\nThe international response to the film which among other awards won the jury's special prize at Cannes in 1957 reconfirmed the author's high rank and proved that ''The Seventh Seal'' regardless of its degree of accuracy in reproducing medieval scenery may be considered as a universal, timeless allegory.<ref>''Swedish Film Classics by Aleksander Kwiatkowski'', Svenska filminstitutet p. 93</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMuch of the film's imagery is derived from medieval art. For example, Bergman has stated that the image of a man playing chess with a skeletal Death was inspired by a medieval church painting from the 1480s in [[T\u00e4by kyrka]], [[T\u00e4by]], north of [[Stockholm]], painted by [[Albertus Pictor]].<ref>Stated in Marie Nyrer\u00f6d's interview series (the first part named ''Bergman och filmen'') aired on [[Sveriges Television]] Easter 2004.</ref>\n\nGenerally speaking, historians [[Johan Huizinga]], [[Friedrich Heer]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]] have all argued that the late Middle Ages of the 14th century was a period of \"doom and gloom\" similar to what is reflected in this film, characterized by a feeling of pessimism, an increase in a penitential style of piety that was slightly masochistic, all aggravated by various disasters such as the Black Death, famine, the [[Hundred Years' War]] between France and England, and the [[Papal schism of 1378|Papal schism]].<ref name=\"Tuchman\">Barbara Tuchman (1978). ''[https://archive.org/details/distantmirror00barb A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century]''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|0-394-40026-7}}</ref> This is sometimes called the [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages]], and Tuchman regards the 14th century as \"[[A Distant Mirror|a distant mirror]]\" of the 20th century in a way that echoes Bergman's sensibilities.\n\n==Major themes==\nThe title refers to a passage about the end of the world from the [[Book of Revelation]], used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words \"And when the Lamb had opened the [[seven seals|seventh seal]], there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\" ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: \"Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to?\"{{sfn|Bergman|1960|pp=145\u2013146}} Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block states: \"[[Faith]] is a torment \u2013 did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.\"{{sfn|Bergman|1960|p=172}} [[Melvyn Bragg]] notes that the concept of the \"Silence of God\" in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State [[Lutheran]] Church.{{sfn|Bragg|1998|pp=40, 45}} In Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as ''A Painting on Wood'', the figure of Death in a [[Dance of Death]] is represented not by an actor, but by [[silence]], \"mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void.\"<ref>Martin Esslin. ''Mediations: Essays on Brecht, Beckett and the Media''. Abacus. London. 1980. p. 181.</ref>\n\nSome of the powerful influences on the film were [[Picasso]]'s picture of the two acrobats, [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', [[Strindberg]]'s dramas ''Folkungasagan'' (\"The Saga of the Folkung Kings\") and ''[[To Damascus|The Road to Damascus]]'',<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xYa6Q9VPfoC |author=Egil T\u00f6rnqvist |title=Bergman's Muses: \u00c6sthetic Versatility in Film, Theatre, Television and Radio |publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc. |year=2003 |page=218 |isbn=9780786482023}}</ref> the frescoes at H\u00e4rkeberga church, and a painting by [[Albertus Pictor]] in T\u00e4by church.{{sfn|Bragg|1998|p=49}} Just prior to shooting, Bergman directed for radio the play ''Everyman'' by [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]].{{sfn|Bragg|1998|p=49}} By this time he had also directed plays by [[Shakespeare]], [[Strindberg]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[G.

Since we all play chess with death, and since we all must suffer through that hopeless joke, the only question about the game is how long it will last and how well we will play it. To play it well, to live, is to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] urges in Bergman's metaphor.\"<ref>Gerald Mast ''A Short History of the Movies.'' p. 405.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Melvyn Bragg]] writes:\n<blockquote>\"[I]t is constructed like an argument. It is a story told as a sermon might be delivered: an allegory...each scene is at once so simple and so charged and layered that it catches us again and again...Somehow all of Bergman's own past, that of his father, that of his reading and doing and seeing, that of his Swedish culture, of his political burning and religious melancholy, poured into a series of pictures which carry that swell of contributions and contradictions so effortlessly that you could tell the story to a child, publish it as a storybook of photographs and yet know that the deepest questions of religion and the most mysterious revelation of simply being alive are both addressed.\"{{sfn|Bragg|1998|pp=64\u201365}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Jesuit publication ''America'' identifies it as having begun \"a series of seven films that explored the possibility of faith in a post-Holocaust, nuclear age\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=10155 |title=Ingmar Bergman, Theologian? |author=Richard A.
