A [[remake]] of [[George A. Romero]]'s 1978 horror film [[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|of the same name]], it stars an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Sarah Polley]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[Jake Weber]], and [[Mekhi Phifer]]. [[Scott Reiniger]], [[Tom Savini]], and [[Ken Foree]] from the original film also make cameo appearances. Set in [[Milwaukee]], the film follows a group of survivors who take refuge in an upscale suburban shopping mall during a [[zombie apocalypse]].\n\nProducers [[Eric Newman (producer)|Eric Newman]] and [[Marc Abraham]] developed the film rather as a \"re-envisioning\" of the original ''Dawn of the Dead'', aiming to reinvigorate the [[Zombie film|zombie genre]] for modern audiences. Newman and Abraham were handed the rights to the original courtesy of its producer and rights holder [[Richard P. Rubinstein]]; and then Gunn was brought in to write the script, which adopted the original's basic premise but is oriented around the [[Action film|action genre]]. Snyder, who previously worked as a commercial and music video director, came on board to direct with the goal of keeping every aspect of the production as grounded in [[Realism (arts)|reality]] as possible. Filming took place from June 9 to September 6 of 2003, on location in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada where a now-defunct shopping mall that was slated for demolition was used. The [[Prosthetic makeup|special makeup effects]] for the film were created by [[David LeRoy Anderson]].\n\n''Dawn of the Dead'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on March 19, 2004, topping the box office on its United States opening weekend, and went on to gross $102.3 million worldwide against a budget of $26 million. Upon release it received generally positive reviews from film critics, some of whom considered it an improvement over its predecessor in terms of acting, production values, and scares; though others found it lacking in character development, excessively gory, and indifferent to the sociopolitical subtext of the original. Retrospective reviews have called it Snyder's best film and placed it among the best zombie films ever made. A [[spiritual successor]], ''[[Army of the Dead]]'', was released on May 14, 2021.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter finishing a long shift as a nurse at the [[Froedtert Hospital|Milwaukee County Hospital]], Ana Clark returns to her suburban neighborhood and her husband Luis. Caught up in a date night, they miss an emergency news bulletin. The next morning, Vivian, a girl from the neighborhood randomly enters their bedroom and bites Luis. Ana forces Vivian outside and tries to call for help. While she is dialing, Luis bleeds out, reanimates and attacks Ana. She flees in her car, crashes, and passes out. Upon waking she joins police sergeant Kenneth Hall, electronics salesman Michael Shaunessy, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda. They break into a nearby shopping mall and are attacked by a zombie security guard, who slightly bites Luda. Three guards \u2014 C.J., Bart, and Terry \u2014 make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. They split into groups to secure the mall. On the roof, they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded in his gun store across the zombie-infested parking lot. A broadcast from a television features a group of police officers burning the corpses of zombies and instructs the viewers to shoot zombies in the head to kill them quickly, prompting the survivors to heed this advice.\n\nThe next day a delivery truck carrying more survivors enters the lot, pursued by zombies. They include Norma, Steve, Tucker, Monica, Glen, Frank and his daughter, Nicole. Another woman is too ill to walk; she is wheeled inside, only to die and reanimate. After she is killed, the group determines the disease is passed by bites. Luda keeps her bite a secret from the group, though Andre knows. Frank, who has been bitten, elects to be isolated. When he reanimates, Kenneth shoots him.\n\nKenneth and Andy start a friendship by way of messages written on a whiteboard; romance buds between Ana and Michael, as well as Nicole and Terry. When the power goes out, a few of the survivors go to the parking garage to activate the emergency generator and find a friendly dog who is adopted by Nicole and named Chips. Zombies kill Bart, forcing the others to douse the zombies in gasoline and set them ablaze. Meanwhile, Luda \u2014 tied up by Andre \u2014 dies before giving birth. She reanimates and Norma kills her. This makes Andre snap; he exchanges gunfire with Norma and the two kill each other. The others find a zombie baby in Andre's arms delivered after Luda's death, which they reluctantly kill. The group decides to fight their way to the marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on [[Lake Michigan]]. They reinforce two shuttle buses from the garage; welding on a snowplow, attaching metal bars and chains as well as stocking chainsaws, propane tanks and road flares.\n\nTo keep Andy from starving, the group straps some food onto Chips and lowers him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips enters Andy's store safely, but a zombie follows and bites Andy. Pursuing Chips, Nicole crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. A group of them reach the gun store via the sewers, kill Andy, and rescue Nicole. They grab ammunition and go back to the mall; along the way, Tucker breaks his legs, and at his request C.J. shoots him. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door because Steve temporarily abandoned his guard duty. Zombies storm the mall, forcing an evacuation via the buses.\n\nWhile navigating the city, Glen loses control of a chainsaw, accidentally killing Monica. In the chaos, their bus crashes, killing Glen. Steve tries to flee on his own but is ambushed by a zombie. Ana kills the zombified Steve and retrieves his boat keys. At the marina, C.J. sacrifices himself by detonating a propane tank so the others can escape. Michael, after revealing a bite wound, kills himself as Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, Terry, and Chips flee on the yacht.\n\nDuring the Credits, A Footage from a camcorder found on the boat shows the group run out of supplies,they later arrive at an island and later get attacked by a swarm of zombies. The camcorder drops, leaving their fate unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|total_width=230||image1=Jake Weber cropped.jpg|image2=Ty Burrell 3 2014.jpg|footer=[[Jake Weber]] and [[Ty Burrell]] (''L\u2013R'') got each other's parts after auditioning on the same day for ''Dawn of the Dead''.}}\n<!-- Cast, order and roles per closing credits -->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Ana Clark, a married nurse.<ref name=\"todd\"/> Polley, who was the first choice for Ana,<ref name=\"fsr\">{{cite web |last1=Hunter |first1=Rob |title=32 Things We Learned From Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead Commentary |url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/32-things-we-learned-from-zack-snyders-dawn-of-the-dead-commentary-bd7eb596b099/ |website=[[Film School Rejects]] |date=March 24, 2016 |access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref> agreed to take the role because she saw it as an unusual departure from the stereotypical portrayal of female characters, considering it to be \"anything more than somebody screaming and running away\"; as such, she admired Ana's resilience in the face of adversity.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web |title=Dawn of the Dead - Production Notes |url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2004/dawn_production_details.htm |website=Media Atlantis |publisher=[[Universal Pictures]] |access-date=May 15, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Sergeant Kenneth Hall, a police officer and former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]].

They're gone. They start at nothing and they have to become who they really are in the face of all that and some of the people are redeemed and end up becoming good people and some of them are not redeemed and they end up, you know, not redeemed. And that's what kind of drove me throughout the story, was it was a story about redemption. I also think that there's a lot about how people survive and what people turn to in the face of such tragedy. The tragedy in this case being flesh-eating zombies.

Not wanting his version inevitably compared to [[George A. Romero]]'s, Snyder concurred with the producers on reimagining the latter film instead of doing it as a \"remake\", which, in his view, would entail re-shooting Romero's script.<ref name=\"production\"/> For that matter, Snyder aimed to make his film a straight [[Horror film|horror]] that was \"as serious as a heart attack\",<ref name=\"production\"/> and keep every aspect of its production as grounded in [[Realism (arts)|reality]] as possible.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> To achieve these, he [[Previsualization|previsualized]] the film with [[storyboard]]s and issued the concept of running zombies, which he said was his \"fresh, new way\" of giving it a sense of verisimilitude and rendering [[zombie]]s as if they were real threats, especially when they attack in hordes.<ref name=\"production\"/> Gunn supported this concept, believing that running zombies would be genuinely frightening than Romero's lumbering zombies.<ref name=\"surviving\"/> Snyder would also maintain Gunn's decision not to reveal the origin of the zombie outbreak, as he felt it was \"obvious that in this [[Societal collapse|fallen society]], you wouldn't know where the whole plague started\".<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Dawn of the Dead Unrated Director's Cut |type=audio commentary |people=[[Zack Snyder]] (director), [[Eric Newman (producer)|Eric Newman]] (producer) |publisher=[[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]] |year=2004}}</ref>\n\n====Set design====\nIn searching for a suitable upscale mall location for the film, [[production designer]] Andrew Neskoromny looked for existing malls that were scheduled for demolition.<ref name=\"production\"/> His search yielded no results until he found the now-defunct Thornhill Square shopping mall in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, which measured approximately {{convert|45,000|sqft|acre}}. Dubbed the \"Crossroads Mall\", the crew completely redid the mall over an eight-week period, adding an expensive [[water feature]] near the entrance, 14 stores, parking structures, and warehouse areas.<ref name=\"production\"/> Since Snyder wanted the stores palpable in terms of design and stood not merely as [[storefront]]s, Neskoromny's team accordingly built them as actual retail stores complete with merchandise. These stores were given fake names, since only two major retail brands agreed to be featured in the film.<ref name=\"production\"/><ref name=\"surviving\"/>\n\n====Makeup effects====\nThe [[Prosthetic makeup|special makeup effects]] for the film were created by [[David LeRoy Anderson]], with assistance from his wife [[Heather Langenkamp]]. Prior to accepting the job from Universal Pictures executive [[James D. Brubaker]], Anderson had been in a two-year hiatus from working as a makeup effects artist to operate his company DLA Silverwear.<ref name=\"anderson\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Killing Time at the Mall: The Special Effects of Dawn of the Dead |type=featurette |people=[[David LeRoy Anderson]], [[Heather Langenkamp]] (special makeup effects artist) |publisher=Shout!

The second stage has moist wounds but the skin is beginning to break down. There is a lot of discoloration and mottling, mostly blues and greens. The third stage is the most intense, with the skeletal form coming through. The wounds are dried-up, the skin is sloughing off and colors are oily blacks.<ref name=\"production\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Filming and post-production===\n====Principal photography====\n[[Principal photography|Filming]] began on June 9, 2003, on location in various parts of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.<ref name=\"production\"/> Hundreds of zombie [[Extra (acting)|extras]] had to be constantly available for the entire shoot. To handle the volume of willing extras, Anderson and his team built a large factory where painted extras would stay put until they are spoken for by either the main or [[second unit]] film crew.<ref name=\"raising\"/> Anderson built various makeup rooms for the artists to work in: one consisted of [[Caravan (towed trailer)|camper trailers]] where they would apply detailed prosthetic makeups to extras playing as \"hero zombies\", a special type of zombie; and the other consisted of [[tent]]s where they would produce painted [[mask]]s for extras playing as background zombies.<ref name=\"raising\"/> Extras playing as foreground zombies were painted with plain [[Palette (painting)|palette]] makeups in Anderson's mall lab. The makeup artists were given Anderson's [[Concept art|concept images]] to work on as references.<ref name=\"raising\"/> According to Anderson and Heather Langenkamp, the most extras they ever had in any given day sat between 200\u2013400,<ref name=\"anderson\"/> with a total of 3,000 makeups completed when filming ended on September 6, 2003.<ref name=\"production\"/>\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:Dawn of the dead parking lot zombies.gif|thumb|The scene in which the mall's parking lot is packed with tens of thousands of zombies was achieved with motion-control passes, and actor [[Ving Rhames]] being filmed over a cluster of 200 extras that were shot against [[Chroma key|green screen]] at various spots.<ref name=\"vfx\"/>]]\nThe [[visual effect]]s for the film were provided by Canadian VFX studio Mr. X Inc., with its president Dennis Berardi serving as the film's co-[[Visual effects supervisor|VFX supervisor]].<ref name=\"vfx\">{{cite web |url=https://www.mrxfx.com/media/dod_filmvideomag.pdf |last=Frazer |first=Bryant |publisher=PBI Media, Inc. |work=Film & Video Magazine |title=Envisioning the New Zombie Apocalypse |date=May 2004 |access-date=April 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210406083623/https://www.mrxfx.com/media/dod_filmvideomag.pdf |archive-date=April 6, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe production shot scenes for which Snyder wanted as many as 4,000 live-action zombies, which Berardi created rather as a combination of practical zombies and [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] zombies which he built as 3D models with [[Autodesk Maya]].

Pictures]] would produce a new zombie film from a screenplay written by [[Joby Harold]], based on an original idea conceived by Snyder. In a statement, Snyder said that he wanted the film to feel similar to ''Dawn of the Dead'' and ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and that it would center around a father in [[Las Vegas]] \"who tries to save his daughter from imminent death in a zombie-infested world.\" At the time, Wesley Coller was attached to executive produce, with Snyder and his wife [[Deborah Snyder]] producing through Cruel & Unusual Films (now known as [[The Stone Quarry]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|date=March 25, 2007|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117961772.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1|title=Warner, Snyders enlist in new 'Army'|work=Variety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130004955/https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117961772.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1|archive-date=November 30, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=May 25, 2021}}</ref> Snyder got the idea during ''Dawn of the Dead''{{'}}s production and wanted to explore a new evolution of the zombies. The film is not a sequel to ''Dawn of the Dead'' but rather a [[spiritual successor]]. Snyder realized that he needed a new [[origin story]] to develop the plot and create a new incarnation of the living dead. He titled the project ''Army of the Dead'' as a tribute to [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|the works]] of George A. Romero.<ref name=\"NotSequel1\">{{cite web|last=Colbert|first=Stephen|date=April 20, 2021|url=https://screenrant.com/army-dead-zack-snyder-set-visit-interview/|title=Army of the Dead: Zack Snyder Set Visit Interview|work=[[Screen Rant]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210421195815/https://screenrant.com/army-dead-zack-snyder-set-visit-interview/|archive-date=April 21, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=May 26, 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"NotSequel2\">{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|date=November 21, 2007|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/708305-excl-joby-harold-on-army-of-the-dead|title=EXCL: Joby Harold on Army of the Dead|work=Coming Soon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111235635/https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/708305-excl-joby-harold-on-army-of-the-dead|archive-date=November 11, 2020|url-status=live|access-date=May 26, 2021}}</ref> After languishing for several years in [[development hell]], the distribution rights to the film were acquired by [[Netflix]] in 2019,<ref>{{cite web|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|date=October 4, 2011|url=https://theplaylist.net/the-thing-director-matthijs-van-heijningen-jr-may-return-to-zack-snyders-army-of-the-dead-20111004/|title='The Thing' Director Matthijs Van Heijningen Jr. May Return To Zack Snyder's 'Army Of The Dead'|work=The Playlist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523224645/https://theplaylist.net/the-thing-director-matthijs-van-heijningen-jr-may-return-to-zack-snyders-army-of-the-dead-20111004/|archive-date=May 24, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=May 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |title=Zack Snyder Returning to Movies With Zombie Action Pic 'Army of the Dead' (Exclusive) |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/zack-snyder-returns-movies-zombie-pic-army-dead-1178979/ |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=January 29, 2021 |access-date=June 8, 2021}}</ref> and Snyder began shooting that same year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Galuppo|first=Mia|date=July 15, 2019|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/army-dead-rounds-cast-omari-hardwick-chris-d-elia-1224474/|title=Zack Snyder's 'Army of the Dead' Rounds Out Cast With Omari Hardwick, Chris D'Elia|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210524133807/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/army-dead-rounds-cast-omari-hardwick-chris-d-elia-1224474/|archive-date=May 24, 2021|url-status=live|access-date=May 25, 2021}}</ref> ''Army of the Dead'' had a week-long limited theatrical release starting May 14 prior to its wider Netflix release on May 21, 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rubin |first1=Rebecca |title=Netflix Will Actually Release Zack Snyder's Zombie Thriller 'Army of the Dead' in a Lot of Movie Theaters |url=https://variety.com/2021/film/news/zack-snyder-army-of-the-dead-netflix-theaters-1234966466/ |work=Variety |date=May 4, 2021 |access-date=June 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 2004]]\n*[[List of zombie films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0363547}}\n\n{{Livingdead}}\n{{Zack Snyder}}\n{{James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Portal bar|United States|Film|Wisconsin|Speculative fiction|2000s|Horror|Viruses}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dawn Of The Dead}}\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2004 horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s action horror films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:American zombie films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of Italian films]]\n[[Category:American action horror films]]\n[[Category:Apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 2000s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2004]]\n[[Category:Films set in shopping malls]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Films set in Milwaukee]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Horror film remakes]]\n[[Category:Living Dead films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by James Gunn]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Tyler Bates]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Zack Snyder]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Marc Abraham]]\n[[Category:2004 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Films about viral outbreaks]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
