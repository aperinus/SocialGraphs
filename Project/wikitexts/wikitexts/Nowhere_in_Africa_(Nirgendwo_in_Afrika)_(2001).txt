The screenplay is based on the 1995 [[autobiographical novel]] of the same name by [[Stefanie Zweig]]. It tells the story of the life in Kenya of a [[German-Jewish]] family that emigrated there in 1938 to escape persecution in [[Nazi Germany]]. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] as well as the 2001 [[German Film Award]] ''([[Deutscher Filmpreis]])'' in five categories, including [[German Film Award for Best Fiction Film|Best Fiction Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1938, the Redlich family flees to [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] from [[G\u0142ubczyce|Leobsch\u00fctz]] in [[Silesia]], [[Nazi Germany]], to escape the increasing persecution of the [[History of the Jews in Europe|Jews]]. Walter, a former lawyer, finds work as a farm manager and sends for his family. His wife Jettel has trouble adjusting to life in Africa, although their daughter Regina quickly adapts to her new environment, easily learning the language of the country and showing interest in local culture. Regina soon forms a close friendship with the farm's cook, Owuor, who helped save Walter's life when he contracted [[malaria]]. The only German contact that Jettel has is through a friend of Walter's named S\u00fcsskind, an ex-German who has lived in Africa for years. Jettel asks S\u00fcsskind why he was never married, and he states that he had a habit of falling in love with married women.\n\nWhen [[World War II|war]] breaks out, the British authorities round up all German citizens and intern them, including Jews, separating men from women. The Redlichs' marriage begins to deteriorate and Walter accuses Jettel of not wanting to sleep with him since he is only a farmer. Jettel sleeps with a German-speaking British soldier to secure work and a home on a farm for the family, and Regina and Walter both find out.\n\nWalter decides to join the [[British Army]] and wants Jettel to go to [[Nairobi]] with him, but she refuses and stays to run the farm with Owuor. Regina is sent to an English [[boarding school]], and is kept there for years, only being able to come back every so often during the harvest season. Jettel becomes fluent in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and runs the farm competently, gaining an appreciation for African culture and hard work that she did not have before. During this time, Jettel and S\u00fcsskind develop a relationship; she kisses him, but he seems to decline to have a relationship (whether they slept together or not remains unclear).\n\nWalter comes back from the war for which Jettel is overjoyed and reconciles with him. Later, he tells her that his father was beaten to death and his sister died in a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]. He applies for a law position in Germany and receives word that he can immediately be placed as a judge. He states that the British Army's policy is to send all soldiers and their families back home. Jettel refuses to go with him, saying the farm needs her and that she is tired of following him around. She also refuses to believe that a country that killed their relatives could ever really be considered home. An angry Walter replies that she hated Africa at first and couldn't wait to get back to Germany, and that she is being selfish. Walter asks Regina if she wants to go with him, but Regina does not want to leave Owuor.\n\nAs Walter is preparing to leave alone, a swarm of locusts appears and threatens the harvest. Jettel sees Walter returning to fight off the locusts, and is touched at his dedication to the family. Eventually the locusts leave without serious damage to the crops and the farmers celebrate. Jettel and Walter make love and reconcile, and she tells him that she is pregnant with his child, leading him to conclude that she didn't sleep with S\u00fcsskind. Owuor decides to go on a journey, realising that the Redlichs' life is back in Germany, and he and Regina tearfully say goodbye. Jettel allows Walter to decide whether or not they should leave, and he acquires tickets back to Germany.\n\nThe final scene shows Walter, Regina, and Jettel travelling on a train on the way to leave Africa. As it stops, an African woman offers Jettel a banana. In a narration, Regina states that her brother was born healthy and was named Max, after her paternal grandfather.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Juliane K\u00f6hler]] as Jettel Redlich\n* [[Merab Ninidze]] as Walter Redlich\n* [[Sidede Onyulo]] as Owuor\n* [[Matthias Habich]] as S\u00fcsskind\n* [[Lea Kurka]] as Regina (younger)\n* [[Karoline Eckertz]] as Regina (older)\n* [[Gerd Heinz]] as Max\n* [[Andrew Sachs]] as Mr. Rubens\n* [[Diane Keen]] as Mrs. Rubens\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was very well received by many international critics.
