He has troubles from recurring nightmares and has been seeing psychiatrist Dr. Geraldine \"Geri\" Bennett to treat him.\n\nNathan is teamed with Karen Murphy for a school research project on missing children. He discovers he looks very much like an age-progression photo of a missing child, Steven Price. His investigations show that he and his parents are probably biologically unrelated. He approaches his mother and she confirms the truth.\n\nTwo men claiming to be from the Bridgewater Juvenile Justice Department arrive at Nathan's home while Mara has finished confirming to Nathan that his suspicions are true. Mara is suspicious and attacks the two, but is shot and killed by the intruders. Kevin is also killed, but not before shouting for Nathan to run. Nathan runs but returns for Karen, who is captured. Nathan rescues her and attempts to find out who the man is, but is forced out of the house because of a bomb.\n\nThe blast injures Karen, so Nathan takes her to the hospital and attempts to contact the police. His call is intercepted by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative Frank Burton, who tells Nathan he is in danger and he will send two men to collect him. Dr. Bennett helps him and Karen escape. Burton explains that Nathan's biological father, Martin Price, stole an encrypted list of 25 corrupt CIA operatives from the [[Serbians|Serbian]] terrorist and freelance intelligence broker Nikola Kozlow when Nathan was 3. Kozlow then planned on abducting Nathan to coerce Martin to hand over the list. Nathan had been given to his adoptive parents to protect him. Kozlow used the website to claim Nathan as the missing child Steven Price in order to find him. Dr. Bennett gives Nathan the address of a safe house in [[Arlington, Virginia]] and tells him to trust only Martin and a man named Paul Rasmus. Burton is warned by his superior to end the situation as soon as possible once he learns of Bennett, who is revealed to be a former CIA operative.\n\nArriving at the safehouse: the two obtain money, a gun, a photo of Nathan's biological mother Lorna Price, and a cell phone. Karen tries to call her family, but her call is intercepted by Burton and the CIA, as well as Kozlow, forcing them to flee. Finding the address for his mother, the pair discover the address is a cemetery and Lorna has died. Nathan and Karen find fresh flowers at her grave: the sender is Paul Rasmus, who lives in [[Nebraska]]. The two take an [[Amtrak]] passenger train to get there, using fake IDs provided by their friend Gilly. En route, they confess their feelings and share a kiss. They are unaware that they are being followed by Kozlow's right-hand man, who abducts Karen. He leaves her bound and gagged, but she frees herself. Nathan fights the assailant and throws him out the window. Burton's team finds Kozlow's henchman and tracks them down.\n\nBurton explains the data that Martin had stolen to Nathan, who considers that it may contain Burton's name on the list. The agents are attacked by Kozlow's snipers. Nathan and Karen flee in a car but Kozlow calls and threatens to kill Karen's parents if Nathan does not hand over the data. Nathan gets Kozlow to agree to make the transaction at a [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] baseball game at their home stadium, [[PNC Park]].\n\nNathan works with Gilly to obtain tickets and secures a gun with the intent to kill Kozlow. When Kozlow arrives, he tells Nathan how he killed his mother when Nathan was 3 after she refused to give up Martin's location. Kozlow grabs the gun from Nathan and demands the list, Nathan bolts and Kozlow gives chase, followed by CIA operatives. Nathan is called by Martin, who tells him to trust him and run to the south parking lot. Nathan does so and Kozlow is shot and killed by Martin. Burton and his agents arrive, and Burton asks for the cell phone. However, Martin had warned his superior about Burton's corruption and takes the phone himself while Burton is taken into custody. Martin calls Nathan again, apologizing for not being the father he should have been. Nathan asks him to show himself but Martin refuses. However, he assures Nathan no one will harm him or Karen and then he disappears. Bennett arrives with Karen and says she has arranged for Nathan to live with her until he decides what to pursue in his life. Nathan and Karen go on a date.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Taylor Lautner]] as Nathan Harper / Steven Price\n* [[Lily Collins]] as Karen Murphy\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Frank Burton\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as Kevin Harper\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Mara Harper\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Dr. Geraldine \"Geri\" Bennett\n* [[Michael Nyqvist]] as Nikola Kozlow\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Martin Price\n* [[Nickola Shreli]] as Alec\n* [[Elisabeth R\u00f6hm]] as Lorna Price\n* [[Antonique Smith]] as Sandra Burns\n* [[Denzel Whitaker]] as Gilly\n* [[Ilia Volok]] as \"Sweater\"\n* Nich Donalies as Cracker Jack Vendor # 1\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Lionsgate Films]] bought screenwriter [[Shawn Christensen]]'s [[spec script]] for ''Abduction'' in February 2010, with actor [[Taylor Lautner]] attached to the film.<ref name=\"Fernandez\" /> The studio won a bidding war for the screenplay, acquiring it for $1 million.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Ward |title=What $1 Million Buys in Hollywood |date=February 26, 2010 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20346839,00.html |access-date=July 16, 2010 }}</ref> [[Gotham Group]] and Vertigo Entertainment had developed the script, based on a story idea by Gotham's [[Jeremy Bell (producer)|Jeremy Bell]].<ref name=\"VarietyMarch25\" />\n\nLionsgate rushed to start [[principal photography]] in July, due to Lautner's schedule to begin work on the last two ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films for [[Summit Entertainment]].
