An [[co-production (media)|international co-production]] between Hong Kong, France, Italy, China and Germany, it is a loose [[sequel]] to Wong's films ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1990) and ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000). It follows the aftermath of Chow Mo-wan's unconsummated affair with Su Li-zhen in 1960s Hong Kong and includes elements of [[science fiction]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=August 2021}}\nThere are four main story arcs, their approximate order listed below, though typical of Wong's films, they are presented in pieces and in non-chronological order. For concision, knowledge of ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' and ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' is assumed, though not absolutely necessary.\n\n===2046 arc part I===\n\nIn the future, a rail network connects Earth. Lonely souls try to reach a mysterious room called 2046; nothing ever changes there so there is never loss or sadness. No one has ever returned from 2046 except Japanese man Tak.\n\n===\"All Memories Are Traces of Tears\"===\n\nReturning to Hong Kong after years in Singapore, Chow becomes a suave ladies' man to cover up his pain from losing Su. On Christmas Eve, Chow meets Lulu and takes her home but accidentally keeps her room key. As he leaves, he notices that her room number is 2046. Upon returning the key, the landlord informs him that the room is not available due to renovations and offers the adjacent 2047. Chow later learns that Lulu was stabbed in 2046 the night before by a jealous boyfriend.\n\nAfter finishing renovation of 2046, the landlord asks Chow if he wants to move in. He has now gotten used to 2047 and stays there.\n\n===Wang Jing-wen and Wang Jie-wen arc part I===\n\nThe landlord's daughter Jing-wen moves into 2046; she is involved with a Japanese man that her father opposes. Eventually, Jing-wen breaks up with him, suffers a breakdown, and is institutionalized. The next tenant is Jing-wen's younger sister Jie-wen who seduces Chow to no avail.\n\nA short time later, Chow runs into financial difficulties so he starts writing a series called ''2046'' about heartsick individuals trying to find the mysterious 2046. Nearly all of the characters in ''2046'' are based on people Chow has met, such as Su, Lulu, and Jing-wen.\n\n===Bai Ling arc part I===\n\nThe 3rd to move into 2046 is Bai Ling, implied to be a nightclub girl and high-class prostitute seeking a long-term relationship. On the next Christmas Eve, Bai runs into Chow just after she is dumped by her boyfriend before they are to go to Singapore. He intrigues her with his experiences in Singapore and they become friends, but their initially platonic relationship soon becomes sexual. Chow wants to keep it strictly physical, continuing to pick up other prostitutes. To compromise, Bai makes him pay $10 each time he stays over. However, Bai realizes that she has feelings for Chow and asks him to stop seeing other women. Chow refuses so Bai breaks off with him, starts seeing men solely for money, and moves out of 2046.\n\n===Jing-wen part II===\n\nAfter Bai moves out, Jing-wen moves back in from the mental hospital but is still depressed over the loss of her ex. Her ex wants to reconcile with her but she refuses due to her father. Jing-wen helps Chow with his writing; he remarks that this is his happiest period post-Su. He develops feelings for her and makes some weak attempts but nothing develops since she still loves her ex.\n\nOne day Jing-wen asks Chow if some things in life never change. He answers by writing a story called ''2047'' in which a Japanese man falls in love on the trip home from 2046. While he initially tried to base the story on Jing-wen's ex, he realises that the story is ultimately about himself.\n\n===2046 arc part II===\n\nTak (portrayed by Jing-wen's ex) tries to leave 2046 because he lost his love there. On the trip, he falls for one of the train's [[gynoid]] assistants (portrayed by Jing-wen), but it never responds to him. Tak realises that it is in love with someone else and finds the strength to leave the train and 2046. Completing the story marks a turning point in Chow's recovery.\n\n===Jing-wen part III===\n\nNext Christmas, Chow finds out Jing-wen still misses her ex so he lets her call him in his office. While he has feelings for her and could have taken advantage of the situation, he is happy that he did the \"right thing.\" Soon after, Jing-wen moves to Japan and gets engaged.\n\nWhile still depressed over the loss of Jing-wen, Chow runs into Lulu again as she confronts another woman for sleeping with her current boyfriend. Chow thinks Lulu is likely to forever remain in the past, though she seems content with her misery, and he resolves to get over Su.\n\n===Bai arc part II===\n\nSome time later, Bai calls Chow and they go out to dinner. She informs Chow that she plans to leave for Singapore and asks him for a reference and plane fare. Bai also asks where he was last Christmas, as she stopped by then, hoping to see him. Chow had gone back to Singapore to find another woman named Su Li-zhen.\n\n===Su Arc===\n\nChow met the second Su when he first arrived in Singapore and was grieving over the first Su. The second Su agreed to help him win back his money so he could return to Hong Kong. They became lovers but unless he beat her in a \"high-card\" draw, she would never reveal her identity. After she won back his money, he asked her to go with him. She challenged him to a draw, which he again lost. Chow speculated that she also had a troubled past.\n\nInitially heartbroken, Chow realizes after completing ''2047'' that the second Su did not go with him because he would have tried to recapture the past by looking for elements of the first Su in her. When Chow returned to Singapore to visit her the second time, he did not find her. He inquired about her whereabouts and theorized that she either returned to Cambodia or was killed.\n\n===Bai arc part III===\n\nThe night before Bai leaves for Singapore, Chow dines with her again. She insists on paying for dinner after getting paid by a client and  hands him a stack of money, each $10 bill representing a night they spent together. After dinner, Chow walks her back to her apartment. Grasping his hands at the door, she begs him to spend the night once more. He reminds her of a question she asked him, whether there was anything he wouldn't lend, and now he realizes that there is one thing he won't lend to anyone. Chow leaves in a taxi, staring emptily into space. He never saw her again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]] as Chow Mo-wan, the main character and narrator. A journalist and writer, he is the same character, played by the same actor, as in ''In the Mood for Love''. He also appears in a silent cameo at the very end of ''Days of Being Wild''.\n* [[Maggie Cheung]] as Su Li-zhen, the woman Chow Mo-wan loved most. She appears only in flashback.

It is the number of a hotel room occupied by Lulu, and later by Bai Ling at the Oriental Hotel, while Mo-Wan's room number is 2047.\n\nChow writes science fiction stories, in which 2046 is a popular year and place to which people [[time travel|travel through time]]. The stories are titled ''2046'' and later ''2047'' (in collaboration with Wang Jing-wen).\n\nThe year 2046 has its own significance for Hong Kong, as it is 49 years after the [[handover of Hong Kong]] by the British on 1 July 1997. At the time of handover, [[Mainland China|the Mainland]] government promised [[One country, two systems|fifty years of self-regulation]] for the former British colony. The year 2046 references the moment before Hong Kong's special, self-regulated status ends.<ref name=\"time\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 119 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10.

He isn't the first and certainly not the only one to pry cinema from the grip of classical narrative, to take a pickax to the usual three-act architecture (or at least shake the foundation), while also dispatching with the art-deadening requirements (redemption, closure, ad nauseam) that have turned much of Big Hollywood into a creative dead zone. Like some avant-garde filmmakers and like his contemporary, [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]] of Taiwan, among precious few others these days, Mr. Wong makes movies, still a young art, that create meaning through visual images, not just words.\" [http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/08/05/movies/05wong.html?ex=1157688000&en=801be294f8fdc85e&ei=5070]</blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', Glenn Kenny gave the film four stars and ranked it as one of the ten best films of 2005:<blockquote>\"Insanely evocative '60s-style landscapes and settings share screen space with claustrophobic futuristic CGI metropolises; everyone smokes and drinks too much; musical themes repeat as characters get stuck in their own self-defeating modes of eternal return. A puzzle, a valentine, a sacred hymn to beauty, particularly that of [[Ziyi Zhang]], almost preternaturally gorgeous and delivering an ineffable performance, and a cynical shrug of the shoulders at the damned impermanence of it all, ''2046'' is a movie to live in.\"<ref>[http://www.premiere.com/article.asp?section_id=2&article_id=2233] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218093518/http://www.premiere.com/article.asp?section_id=2&article_id=2233 |date=18 December 2005 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSaid Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'':<blockquote>\"Is it worth the challenge? Of course it is. Wong stands as the leading heir to the great directors of post-WWII Europe: His work combines the playfulness and disenchantment of Godard, the visual fantasias of Fellini, the chic existentialism of Antonioni, and Bergman's brooding uncertainties. In this film, he drills further into an obsession with memory, time, and longing than may even be good for him, and his world reflects and refracts our own more than may be comfortable for us. Love hurts in ''2046,'' but it's the only way anybody knows they're alive.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=7963 | work=The Boston Globe | title=Wong's '2046' is a mind-altering cocktail, perfectly blended | first=Ty | last=Burr | date=19 August 2005}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDaniel Eagan of ''[[Film Journal International]]'':<blockquote>\"it's clear his [Wong Kar-wai] skills and interests have no match in today's cinema.  Whatever his motives, Wong has assembled a remarkable team for this film. The cinematography, production design and editing combine for a mood of utter languor and decadence. Leung Chiu-wai continues his string of outstanding roles, while pop singer Wong achieves a gravity missing from her earlier work...it's Zhang who is the real surprise here...her performance puts her on a level with the world's best actresses.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=2046|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000979957|access-date=16 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219192936/http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000979957|archive-date=19 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nOne of the less enthusiastic reviews came from [[Roger Ebert]] who, in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', gave the film a midly-negative 2\u00bd stars out of a possible four and a \"marginal thumbs down\" on the television show ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Ebert & Roeper]]''.<blockquote>\"''2046'' arrived at the last minute at Cannes 2003, after missing its earlier screenings; the final reel reportedly arrived at the airport almost as the first was being shown. It was said to be unfinished, and indeed there were skeletal special effects that now appear in final form, but perhaps it was never really finished in his mind. Perhaps he would have appreciated the luxury that [[Woody Allen]] had with ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]''; he looked at the first cut of the film, threw out the first act, called the actors back and reshot, focusing on what turned out to be the central story. Watching ''2046'', I wonder what it could possibly mean to anyone not familiar with Wong's work and style. Unlike ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'', it is not a self-contained film, although it's certainly a lovely meander.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050901/REVIEWS/50822004/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=2046 | access-date=17 January 2022 | archive-date=18 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218222925/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050901%2FREVIEWS%2F50822004%2F1023 | url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe official journal of the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]], ''[[Film Comment]]'''s 2005 end-of-the-year film critics' poll, placed the film as the second best film of that year, with 668 points.<ref>[http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/JF06/2005poll.htm FILM COMMENT'S END-OF-YEAR CRITICS' POLL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013011002/http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/JF06/2005poll.htm |date=13 October 2008 }}</ref> ''2046'' was called the best film of 2005 by Michael Atkinson (''[[The Village Voice]]''), Daryl Chin (Journal of Performance and Art), Josef Brown (''[[Vue Weekly]]''), Sean Burns (''[[Philadelphia Weekly]]''), Will Sloan (''The Martingrove Beacon''), and Justine Elias (''[[The Guardian]]''), and was ranked among the top ten best films of the year by Manohla Dargis (''[[The New York Times]]''), [[Richard Corliss]] (''[[Time Magazine]]''), Same Adams (''[[Philadelphia City Paper]]''), Leslie Camhi (''[[The Village Voice]]''), Jason Anderson (''[[eye Weekly]]''), Gary Dretzka (''Movie City News''), Godfrey Cheshire (''[[The Independent Weekly]]''), Ty Burr (''[[The Boston Globe]]''), Liza Bear (''[[indieWIRE]]''), Edward Crouse (''[[The Village Voice]]''), Jeffrey M.
