Pictures]]. It was produced by [[Hal B. Wallis]] and [[Henry Blanke]], directed by [[Michael Curtiz]] and [[William Keighley]], and stars [[Errol Flynn]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Claude Rains]], [[Patric Knowles]], [[Eugene Pallette]] and [[Alan Hale Sr.]] The film is particularly noted for its [[Academy Award]]-winning score by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]].\n\nThe film was written by [[Norman Reilly Raine]] and [[Seton I. Miller]]. The storyline depicts the legendary Saxon knight [[Robin Hood]] who, in [[King Richard the Lionheart]]'s absence in the [[Holy Land]] during the [[Crusades]], fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla band against Prince John and the Norman lords oppressing the Saxon commoners.\n\n''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' has been acclaimed by critics since its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/|title=Top 100 Movies of All Time \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes|work=rottentomatoes.com|access-date=19 April 2016}}</ref> In 1995, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation by the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite news| title=25 old films honored| work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6TEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4800,2630781| date=December 28, 1995| access-date=July 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlan Hale Sr., who plays Little John, had played the same character in [[Douglas Fairbanks]]'s [[Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood|1922 version]] of the film and went on to play him again in ''[[Rogues of Sherwood Forest]]'', released by Columbia in 1950, a 28-year span.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=3983|title=Detail view of Movies Page|work=afi.com|access-date=19 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-09-11|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] rules, plot summaries must be between 400 and 700 words. This summary is at 660 words.-->\n[[Richard I of England|Richard]], the [[Normans|Norman]] King of England, is taken captive in 1191 by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Duke Leopold]] while returning from the [[Third Crusade]]. Richard's treacherous brother [[John, King of England|Prince John]], aided by fellow Norman [[Guy of Gisbourne|Sir Guy of Gisbourne]], takes the opportunity to name himself regent of England, and increases the taxes and regulations on the [[Saxons]] under the pretense of gathering ransom for Richard.\n\nThe Normans exploit and oppress the Saxons. [[Robin Hood|Sir Robin of Locksley]], a Saxon noble, opposes the brutality and rescues [[Much the Miller's Son]] from being executed for [[poaching]], earning Gisbourne's ire. Robin confronts Prince John at [[Nottingham Castle]] during a banquet, telling the guests that he regards John's declaring himself regent in Richard's absence as treason. John orders Robin's execution, but he escapes and flees with Much and [[Will Scarlet]] into [[Sherwood Forest]]. In response, John seizes Robin's lands and names him an outlaw.\n\nMuch is sent to recruit men to join their band. Robin and Will meet up with [[Little John|John the Little]] on a [[log bridge]], and after a [[quarterstaff]] contest, welcome him into their ranks. Dozens more men join Robin's band by swearing an oath to harm the rich only to aid the poor, to fight injustice, and to show courtesy to all oppressed. They start a [[guerrilla]] war against Gisbourne and John, sniping those who abuse their power.\n\nRobin's band encounters the rotund [[Friar Tuck]], a renowned swordsman. Tuck joins the band and assists in capturing a company of Normans bringing a shipment of food and taxes. In the company are Gisbourne, the cowardly [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], and King Richard's ward [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]]; the men are humiliated at the subsequent woodland banquet, while Marian is given a seat of honor by Robin. Initially scornful, she comes to share his views when he shows her the aftermath of the Norman brutality against the Saxons. Robin sends the convoy back to Nottingham Castle, telling them that they have Marian's presence to thank for their lives being spared.\n\nHaving noted Robin's fixation on Marian during the woodland banquet, the Sheriff suggests hosting an archery tournament with the Lady Marian giving out the golden arrow prize in order to entrap Robin. Robin enters the tournament, is recognized by his unsurpassed archery skill, and is sentenced to death. Marian aids the Merry Men in a scheme to save Robin. After his escape, he scales the palace walls to thank Marian, and the two pledge their love for one another. Marian declines Robin's offer of marriage, electing to stay and be a Saxon spy in the castle.\n\nKing Richard returns with some of his knights. The Bishop of the Black Canons sees through Richard's disguise at a roadside inn, and alerts John. John sends disgraced former knight Dickon Malbete to kill Richard, promising Dickon Robin's title and lands. Marian overhears and writes to Robin, but is found out by Gisbourne and sentenced to death. Her nursemaid, Bess, tells Much everything. Much intercepts Dickon and kills him in combat.\n\nRichard and his men disguise themselves as Norman monks, travel through Sherwood and (as planned) are stopped by Robin. Assuring Robin they are on the King's business, Richard accepts Robin's offer of hospitality and his condemnation of the Crusades, but does not reveal his identity.\n\nMuch relays Bess' news. Robin orders his men to find and protect Richard; now sure of Robin's loyalty, Richard reveals himself. He and Robin coerce the Bishop of the Black Canons to allow them to join his monks in disguise so they can enter the castle. Once inside, Richard announces his presence, and a huge melee erupts. Robin duels Gisbourne and kills him, freeing Marian and prompting the rest of John's men to surrender.\n\nBack on the throne, King Richard banishes John and restores Robin's rank, promoting him to Baron of Locksley, and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham. The King also [[royal pardon|pardons]] the Merry Men, and commands Robin to take Lady Marian as his wife. Robin exits the castle with Marian.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Errol Flynn]] as [[Robin Hood]]\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as [[Maid Marian]]\n* [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Guy of Gisbourne]]\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[John, King of England|Prince John]]\n* [[Patric Knowles]] as [[Will Scarlet]]\n* [[Eugene Pallette]] as [[Friar Tuck]]\n* [[Alan Hale, Sr.]] as [[Little John]]\n* [[Melville Cooper]] as High [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]\n* [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]] as [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lion-Heart]]\n* [[Una O'Connor (actress)|Una O'Connor]] as Bess\n* [[Herbert Mundin]] as [[Much the Miller's Son|Much]]\n* [[Montagu Love]] as the Bishop of the Black Canons\n* Leonard Willey as Sir Essex\n* Robert Noble as Sir Ralf\n* Kenneth Hunter as Sir Mortimer\n* [[Robert Warwick]] as Sir Geoffrey\n* [[Colin Kenny (actor)|Colin Kenny]] as Sir Baldwin\n* [[Lester Matthews]] as Sir Ivor\n* [[Harry Cording]] as Dickon Malbete\n* [[Howard Hill]] as Captain of Archers (also Elwyn the Welshman [uncredited])\n* [[Ivan F.

Wallis]] is generally seen as the film's creative helmsman.<ref name=Ebert/> The first draft of the script was written by Rowland Lee, but Wallis objected to its heavily archaic and fanciful dialogue (one line he cited was \"Oh my lord, tarry not too long, for I fear that in her remorse she may fling herself from the window. Some harm may befall her, I know.\"). At Wallis's insistence, the script was heavily rewritten to modernize the dialogue, and it is unclear whether any of Lee's work survives in the completed film.<ref name=BehlmerAu/>\n\nThe scene in which Robin Hood first meets Prince John, Guy of Gisbourne, and Maid Marian went through several iterations. Initially the scene was to be at a jousting tournament with Robin tilting against Guy of Gisbourne, mimicking the 1922 [[Douglas Fairbanks]] production of ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'', but screenwriter [[Norman Reilly Raine]] pointed out that a banquet scene would be much less expensive to produce and, so long as Technicolor was employed, would look just as lavish to the average moviegoer.<ref name=BehlmerAu/> In another draft, instead of a deer, it was a slain villager who Robin Hood brought in and dumped on Prince John's table. Wallis felt the use of a dead villager expended all the tension of the scene in \"a momentary kick\", and preferred the use of a deer from an earlier draft, which allowed the tension to simmer with the threat of an explosion at any moment.<ref name=BehlmerAu/>\n\n[[James Cagney]] was originally cast as Robin Hood, but walked out on his Warner Bros. contract, paving the way for the role to go to [[Errol Flynn]].<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> The filming was postponed three years as a result.<ref name=\"films\">{{cite book |first1=Tony |last1=Thomas |first2=Rudy |last2=Behlmer |author-link2=Rudy Behlmer  |first3=Clifford |last3=McCarty |title=The Films of Errol Flynn |publisher=[[Kensington Books|Citadel Press]] |location=[[Secaucus, New Jersey]] |date=June 1969 |pages=62\u201367 |isbn=978-0806502373}}</ref> Though [[Olivia de Havilland]] was an early frontrunner for the role of Maid Marian, for a time the studio vacillated between her and [[Anita Louise]] for the part.

To win, Robin splits the arrow of Philip of Arras, a captain of the guard under Gisbourne, who had struck the bullseye. Hill did in fact split one arrow with another during filming (albeit while firing from a much closer range than Robin Hood is portrayed as shooting from), but it did not look good enough on film, so the shot was redone with some effects trickery.<ref name=BehlmerAu/> Stuntman Buster Wiles, close friend of Errol Flynn and his frequent on-set stand-in, maintained that the arrow-splitting stunt was carried out using an extra large arrow (for the target) and that the second arrow had a wide, flat arrowhead and was fired along a wire. This wire can briefly be seen attached to the [[fletching]] of the arrow, in the final film. Wiles discusses the scene in his autobiography, ''[[My Days With Errol Flynn]]''.\n\nFlynn performed most of his own stunts in the film; exceptions include Robin jumping onto a horse with hands tied behind his back (during the hanging scene), scaling the fortress gate and coming down the other side, and a few select shots in the duel between Robin and Guy of Gisbourne.<ref name=BehlmerAu/>\n\n===Music score===\nIn 1938, [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]] was conducting opera in Austria when he was asked by Warner Bros. to return to Hollywood and compose a score for ''The Adventures of Robin Hood''.<ref name=Thomas>Thomas, Tony. ''Korngold: Vienna to Hollywood'', Turner Entertainment (1996)</ref>{{rp|27}} Music historian Laurence E. MacDonald notes that there were many factors which made the film a success, including its cast, its Technicolor photography, and fast-paced direction by [[Michael Curtiz]], but \"most of all, there is Korngold's glorious music\".<ref name=MacDonald>MacDonald, Laurence E. ''The Invisible Art of Film Music: A Comprehensive History'', Scarecrow Press (1998)</ref>{{rp|49}} And film historian [[Rudy Behlmer]] describes Korngold's contribution to this and his other films:\n{{blockquote|Korngold's score was a splendid added dimension. His style for the Flynn swashbucklers resembled that of the creators of late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century German symphonic tone poems. It incorporated chromatic harmonies, lush instrumental effects, passionate climaxes{{mdash}}all performed in a generally romantic manner. Korngold's original and distinctive style was influenced by the Wagnerian [[leitmotif]], the orchestral virtuosity of Richard Strauss, the delicacy and broad melodic sweep of [[Puccini]], and the long-line development of Gustav Mahler.<ref name=Behlmer>Behlmer, Rudy. ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'', Univ. of Wisconsin Press (1979)</ref>{{rp|38}}}}\n\nIn reply to Warner Bros.\u2019 request, Korngold told studio head of production Hal B. Wallis that he was a composer of drama and the heart, and felt little connection to what he perceived as \u201ca 90% action picture.\u201d<ref name=BehlmerAu/> Wallis was persistent, and Korngold finally agreed to begin composing on the condition that he not have a contract, and work on a week-by-week basis so that he could withdraw if he were dissatisfied with the music he composed. However, Korngold later admitted that the real reason he changed his mind was [[Adolf Hitler]]'s November 1937 meeting with Austrian ministers, which convinced Korngold that it was no longer safe in his home country.<ref name=BehlmerAu/> As Korngold feared, Austria was [[Anschluss|annexed by the Nazis]], and his home in Vienna was confiscated.<ref name=Behlmer/>{{rp|35}} This meant that all Jews in Austria were now at risk, so Korngold stayed in America until the end of [[World War II]].<ref>Bernardi, Daniel. ''Hollywood's Chosen People: The Jewish Experience in American Cinema'', [[Wayne State University Press]] (2013) p. 48</ref>\n\nKorngold called his film scores \u201cOpern ohne Singen,\u201d operas without singing, but otherwise approached their composition just as he would for the operatic stage. ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' was, therefore, a large-scale symphonic work and, despite the studio music department's providing a team of orchestrators, including future Oscar-winner [[Hugo Friedhofer]], to assist Korngold, the amount of work was immense, especially for the limited time he was given to compose. In describing this dilemma to his father, Julius Korngold, one of Vienna's foremost music critics, the elder Korngold suggested that themes from his 1920 symphonic overture \u201cSursum Corda\u201d (\u201cLift Up Your Hearts\u201d) would serve splendidly for much of the most demanding action-scene music, and Erich agreed.\n\nIt also gave him his second [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] and established the symphonic style that would later be used in action films during Hollywood's Golden Age.<ref name=MacDonald/>{{rp|50}} Modern day epics such as the ''Star Wars'' and ''Indiana Jones'' trilogies similarly included original symphonic scores.<ref name=MacDonald/>{{rp|50}} Composer [[John Williams]] has cited Korngold as his inspiration in scoring the ''Star Wars'' series.<ref name=Hischak>Hischak, Thomas S.

They would ultimately star together in nine films, the aforementioned and ''[[Four's a Crowd]]'' (1938), ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939), ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' (1939), ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940), ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' (1941) and ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (film)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' (1943), although they shared no scenes in the last film.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/search.aspx?s=| title=AFI Catalog of Feature Films| publisher=American Film Institute| access-date=19 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nScenes and costumes worn by the characters have been imitated and spoofed endlessly.  For instance, in the [[Bugs Bunny]] animated [[short film]], ''[[Rabbit Hood]]'', Bugs is continually told by a dim-witted Little John, \"Don't you worry, never fear; Robin Hood will soon be here.\" When Bugs finally meets Robin at the end of the film, he is stunned to find that it is Errol Flynn, in a spliced-in clip from this film (he subsequently shakes his head and declares, \"It ''couldn't'' be him!\"). Other parodies were [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]] in ''[[Robin Hood Daffy]]'' and [[Goofy]] and [[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]] in ''[[Goof Troop]]'' episode \"Goofin' Hood & His Melancholy Men\".\n\n''[[The Court Jester]]'', a musical comedy starring [[Danny Kaye]], is in great measure a spoof of Robin Hood. [[Basil Rathbone]] even appears as the villain and has a climactic sword fight with Kaye.\n\nMost of the [[Mel Brooks]] parody ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'' relied on this film for its aesthetics, although the plot was almost completely a riff on ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', as well as referencing the [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|1973 Disney version]].  Mel Brooks also spoofed the Robin Hood legend in his 1975 television series ''[[When Things Were Rotten]]''.\n\nA fragment of one of the film's sword fighting scenes was converted to [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] by [[Jordan Mechner]] and used for his 1989 [[platform game]] ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]''.<ref name=\"GDC2011\">{{cite speech| title=Classic Game Postmortem: PRINCE OF PERSIA| first=Jordan| last=Mechner| author-link=Jordan Mechner| event=Game Developers Conference| location=San Francisco| date=2011| url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014634/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PRINCE-OF| access-date=30 May 2013| time=38:35}}</ref>\n\nErrol Flynn's acrobatic swordplay became a crucial touchstone for the [[Lightsaber|light-saber]] duels choreography in ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Robey|first=Tim|date=2015-11-24|title=10 films that influenced Star Wars|language=en-GB|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars--a-new-hope/movies-influences-george-lucas/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars--a-new-hope/movies-influences-george-lucas/ |archive-date=2022-01-12 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|access-date=2020-12-25|issn=0307-1235}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]\u2019s 2010 animated film ''[[Tangled]]'', the appearance and personality of [[Flynn Rider]] are partly inspired by that of Errol Flynn,{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}} with his surname also being used in homage.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hall|first=Sandra|date=2011-01-07|title=Tangled|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/tangled-20110107-19i46.html|access-date=2020-12-24|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Picture-Strip adaptation==\n''[[Knockout (UK comics)|Knockout Comic]]'' (weekly picture paper \u2022 [[Amalgamated Press]], London) No 434, June 21, 1947 \u2013 No 447, September 20, 1947 \u2022 14 issues, 28pp in black-and-white (Drawn by Michael Hubbard)<ref>David Ashford/John Allen-Clark/Steve Holland: ''Knockout Comic: An Illustrated Guide'' (CJ Publications, UK \u2022 1997)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Knockout 0434 (UK Comic Books)|url=https://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=74220|access-date=2020-12-26|website=Comic Book Plus|language=en}}</ref> Produced when the film was first revived after [[World War II]], with several deviations made from the film's plot, the picture strip's storyline is generally faithful to the look and narrative of the Warner Bros.' feature. However, the famous climactic duel between Robin and Sir Guy is reduced to only a couple of panels, with Robin still dressed in his earlier monk's habit. The strip opens with a joust between Robin and Sir Guy, a scene which was in the original screenplay but was never actually filmed.<ref name=Behlmer/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes]], a film review aggregator website\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0029843|title=The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* {{Amg movie|991|The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* {{tcmdb title|738|The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* {{AFI film|id=3983|title=The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood|title=The Adventures of Robin Hood}}\n* [http://www.virtual-history.com/movie/film/1122/the-adventures-of-robin-hood ''The Adventures of Robin Hood''] at Virtual History\n* ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, A&C Black, 2010 {{ISBN|0826429777}}, pages 275-276 [https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/deq3xI8OmCkC?hl=en]\n\n{{Robin Hood}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Classic Film DVD Release}}\n{{Michael Curtiz}}\n{{William Keighley}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adventures Of Robin Hood, The}}\n[[Category:1938 films]]\n[[Category:1938 adventure films]]\n[[Category:1930s American films]]\n[[Category:1930s color films]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:Robin Hood films]]\n[[Category:Films about royalty]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Original Score Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose art director won the Best Art Direction Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose editor won the Best Film Editing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Curtiz]]\n[[Category:Films directed by William Keighley]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Hal B.
