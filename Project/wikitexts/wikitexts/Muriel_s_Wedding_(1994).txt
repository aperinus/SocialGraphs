Hogan]]. The film, which stars [[Toni Collette]], [[Rachel Griffiths]], [[Jeanie Drynan]], [[Sophie Lee]], and [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]], focuses on the socially awkward Muriel whose ambition is to have a glamorous wedding and improve her personal life by moving from her dead-end hometown, the fictional Porpoise Spit, to [[Sydney]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[1994 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in Australia on 29 September 1994. It received positive reviews and earned multiple award nominations, including a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] (Collette).\n\n==Plot==\nMuriel Heslop, a socially awkward young woman, is the target of ridicule by her shallow and egotistical friends, Tania, Cheryl, Janine, and Nicole. She spends her time listening to [[ABBA]] songs and perpetually daydreams of a glamorous wedding to get her out of the dead-end beach town of Porpoise Spit and away from her domineering father, Bill, a corrupt politician who constantly belittles his wife, Betty, and five children.\n\nMuriel attends the wedding of Tania and Chook, during which she sees Chook and Nicole having sex in a laundry room. Wedding guest Dianne, a department [[store detective]], calls the police on Muriel for stealing the dress she is wearing, and the police publicly escort Muriel out of the reception.\n\nSoon after, Bill's rumored mistress, Deidre Chambers, recruits Muriel into her multilevel marketing business, and Muriel's \"friends\" officially kick her out of their group after clarifying that she won't be accompanying them on an island holiday. Betty signs a blank cheque for Muriel to buy products for the cosmetics business, but Muriel instead uses the cheque to withdraw $12,000 and follow her former friends to the island anyway. There, Muriel runs into Rhonda Epinstall, an old high school acquaintance, and they quickly strike up a friendship, cemented when Rhonda gleefully tells Tania about Nicole and Chook.\n\nMuriel returns home and is confronted by Betty regarding the stolen money. Muriel immediately runs away to Sydney, sharing a flat with Rhonda and changing her name to Mariel. She gets a job at a [[Video rental shop|video store]], meets and briefly dates an awkward but kind man, Brice Nobes.\n\nOne night, Rhonda suddenly falls down, apparently [[paralyzed]]. While at the hospital, Muriel calls home and learns her father is being investigated for [[Bribery|taking bribes]]. Rhonda has a cancerous [[Neoplasm|tumour]] in her spine and undergoes multiple operations, eventually leaving her permanently unable to walk. Muriel promises Rhonda to look after her and never let her go back to Porpoise Spit. She also uses Rhonda's health crisis to obtain pampered service at numerous bridal shops, trying on wedding dresses and taking photographs to indulge her wedding dreams. When Rhonda discovers what Muriel has done, Muriel finally confesses to her fixation on a storybook wedding, and they have an angry fight.\n\nDesperate, Muriel enters into a conspiracy to marry South African swimmer David Van Arkle so that he can join [[Australia at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Team Australia]] in the [[2000 Summer Olympics|upcoming Olympics]]; she is paid $10,000 by David's parents for her part in the scheme. At Muriel's elaborate wedding in Sydney, she shows off Tania, Cheryl, and Janine as her bridesmaids; Rhonda, disgusted by Muriel's behavior, refuses to be one. Bill openly treats Deidre as his date, and Betty arrives late to the wedding due to being unable to afford plane tickets; Muriel doesn't notice her at the wedding. Rhonda moves back to her mother's home, unable to live in Sydney without help. After the wedding, David makes his contempt for Muriel clear to her.\n\nIn Porpoise Spit, an increasingly distraught Betty shoplifts a pair of sandals she tries on, and Dianne calls the police. Bill arranges for the charges to disappear. Soon after Betty pleads with Bill, telling him that she needs help, he announces his intention to divorce her and marry Deidre. Betty is later found dead by her daughter, Joanie. Deidre claims Betty had a heart attack, but Joanie reveals to Muriel that Betty's death was suicide.\n\nWhen Muriel breaks down at her mother's funeral, David comforts her, and they finally consummate their marriage. Her mother's death forces Muriel to take a hard look at her life, and she tells David that she can no longer remain married to him as neither of them are in love, and she wants to stop lying.\n\nBill asks Muriel to help raise her siblings, as Deidre is less likely to marry him with the children in tow. He has also lost his job on city council. Muriel stands up to him, giving him $5,000 of her wedding money and telling him she will repay the rest of the stolen amount when she gets a job in Sydney. Impressing her father with her more assertive personality, Muriel demands that he stop his verbally abusive treatment of her siblings.\n \nMuriel goes to Rhonda's house, where Muriel's former tormentors are visiting, and offers to take her back to Sydney. Rhonda accepts and lets the other girls know what she thinks of them. Muriel and Rhonda head to the airport, happily leaving Porpoise Spit behind for a more promising future.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- First 3 cast per tombstone opening credits order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Muriel Heslop\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Bill Heslop\n* [[Rachel Griffiths]] as Rhonda Epinstall\n* [[Genevi\u00e8ve Picot]] as Dianne the Store Detective\n* [[Sophie Lee]] as Tania Degano\n* [[Jeanie Drynan]] as Betty Heslop\n* [[Gennie Nevinson]] as Deidre Chambers\n* [[Daniel Lapaine]] as David Van Arkle\n* [[Matt Day]] as Brice Nobes\n* [[Roz Hammond]] as Cheryl\n* Belinda Jarrett as Janine\n* [[Pippa Grandison]] as Nicole\n* [[Daniel Wyllie]] as Perry Heslop\n* [[Gabby Millgate]] as Joanie Heslop\n*[[Rob Steele (actor)|Rob Steele]] (died 2022<ref>{{cite web | title=Steele Passes Away | website=Twin Town Times  | date=19 May 2022 | url=https://twintowntimes.com.au/_/2022/05/steele-passes-away/ | access-date=14 June 2022}}</ref>) as Higgins\n* Chris Haywood as Ken Blundell\n* Cintra Bedford as Bridal shop model\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film used [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]] as the locale for Porpoise Spit,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/22/features \"The wedding belle\"] by Stephen Lowenstein, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 October 2000</ref> although the scene of Muriel and Rhonda leaving Porpoise Spit was filmed in its adjoining \"Twin Town\", [[Coolangatta]].<ref>[http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/where-you-can-recreate-your-favourite-movie-scenes-in-queensland/news-story/e177597cd2990180ac875703d8da64b1 \"Where you can recreate your favourite movie scenes in Queensland\"] by Sarah Motherwell, ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', 12 November 2015</ref> Other filming locations included [[Moreton Island]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]], the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Elanora, Queensland|Elanora]],<ref>{{cite web |title=(facebook publication) |url=https://www.facebook.com/GeckoGoldCoast/posts/did-you-know-that-the-pines-shopping-centre-in-elanora-is-now-famous-for-more-th/939343629434117/  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/190773894291098/939343629434117 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited|publisher=Gecko Environment Council |access-date=2 July 2020 |date=22 January 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Tugun, Queensland|Tugun]], [[Parramatta]], [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]] and Sydney.\n\nFor the role of Muriel, Toni Collette gained 18&nbsp;kg (40&nbsp;lb) in seven weeks.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hynlEn8PcUgC&pg=PA35 | title=Hollywood Winners & Losers A to Z | publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation | author=Thise, Mark | year=2008 | page=35| isbn=9780879103514 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe [[film premiere]]d at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 1994 and opened in Australia at the end of the month, a month after another Australian film, ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]''.<ref name=open/>\n\n===Critical reception===\n\n''Muriel's Wedding'' received positive reviews from critics and has a score of 80% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10.
