The film charts the music career of Denise Waverly, an aspiring singer who writes for other artists in the [[pop music]] world of the mid-1960s. \n\nThe soundtrack features songs by artists [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Gerry Goffin]], and [[Jill Sobule]], replicating the musical style that emerged from the [[Brill Building]], [[New York City]]'s  music factory in the heyday of [[girl groups]] and \"pre-fab\" acts like [[The Monkees]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1958, Philadelphia steel heiress Edna Buxton enters and wins a talent contest. When she attempts to record a [[Demo (music)|demo]], a studio producer tells her that girl singers are not currently getting signed and record companies are even trying to get rid of the ones on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song she wants to record, he is impressed enough to direct her to producer Joel Milner, who takes her under his wing, renames her \"Denise Waverly\" and invents a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male [[doo-wop]] group, the Stylettes, as male groups are far more marketable, and the song becomes a hit.\n\nDenise moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the [[Brill Building]]. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting, they begin a relationship. Denise offers to write a song specifically for her three girlfriends, which culminates in Joel auditioning the girls and creating the [[girl group]] the Luminaries. Howard and Denise also begin writing together and eventually get married and have a child. They pen a song called \u201cUnwanted Number,\u201d based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy. Although it is banned from radio, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential [[disc jockey]] John Murray, who, despite the negative attention around the song, credits Denise with sparking the girl group craze.\n\nJoel recruits the beautiful English songwriter Cheryl Steed, who immediately catches Howard's eye, and initially, Denise's disdain. Cheryl diffuses Denise\u2019s suspicion by informing her that she already has a songwriting partner \u2013 her husband Matthew. Joel tasks Denise and Cheryl with writing a song for the ing\u00e9nue singer Kelly Porter. The two women bond over the realization that the young songstress is in a [[closeted]] [[lesbian]] relationship with her roommate Marion. They write the coded song \"My Secret Love\" for Kelly, which becomes a hit.\n\nDenise\u2019s relationship with Howard becomes strained due to his philandering with other women. When she learns she is pregnant with Howard's second baby, Cheryl convinces her to see an obstetrician, who safely performs an [[Unsafe abortion|illegal abortion]]. Denise and Cheryl then become close friends and Denise eventually breaks up with Howard.\n\nIn 1966, Milner offers to send Denise to the studio to sing for herself. As an added incentive, he offers the production assistance of Jay Phillips, the frontman of California rock group the Riptides, to produce her single. Although initially hesitant as she says she finds the whole \"[[California sound|surf and turf]]\" sound laughable, she writes and sings the song \"God Give Me Strength\" and is delighted by Jay's skillful orchestral arrangement. The record she puts out with him, however, is a commercial failure. Between the loss suffered by her foundering single and the advent of the [[British Invasion]], Milner's fortunes are depleted. Denise blames herself for making the song too personal and bankrupting Joel. He tells her she did more for him than she realized and that it was time for them both to move on.\n\nDenise and Jay become a couple and resettle in California. Jay treats Denise\u2019s daughter Luna as his own, but he is reclusive and a user of [[recreational drugs]] like marijuana and peyote. Denise has since joined forces with the newly-divorced Cheryl to write songs for a [[Bubblegum music|bubblegum pop]] TV show, ''Where the Action Is'', though Jay insists to Denise that writing music for TV is beneath her.\n\nJay's behavior becomes more erratic and he becomes increasingly paranoid, causing his bandmates to distance themselves from him. He falls into a period of deep [[Depression (mood)|depression]] that seemingly abates after a visit from his friend \"Jonesy\", who reminds him of the things that are important in his life, including his \"groovy new old lady\", Denise.\n\nThinking that the worst is over, Denise invites Jay to join her and Cheryl at the Whiskey a Go-Go to see Doris, a former Luminary member who embarked on a solo career after the girl group broke up, perform. Jay declines, saying he has a song idea he wants to explore, so Denise ends up going with Cheryl. While the women celebrate, Jay is revealed to be still in the throes of his depression; having put on a brave face for Denise's benefit. He walks into the ocean, taking his own life. Denise is further distraught to discover that Jay's fans blame her for not intervening in his death.\n\nNumbed by the loss, Denise retires with her family to a hippie [[Intentional community|commune]] in northern California and tries to make sense of everything that has happened. Some time later, Joel visits Denise at the commune and takes her and the children to dinner. That night, he criticizes how far down she's allowed her grieving to take her and says that it's destroying her and her talent. Denise angrily lashes out, telling Milner that he'd be nothing without her success. He agrees; however, the more he agrees with her, the angrier she becomes. She strikes him then collapses in tears, grieving for Jay. Milner consoles her and the two are reconciled.\n\nWith Joel's help, Denise creates the platinum-selling work \"Grace of My Heart\". As she lays down the piano track for the song, her life is recounted in pictures, leading to the moment when her own mother receives a copy of her album in the mail with a handwritten note. Seemingly proud of her daughter's success, she smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Illeana Douglas]] as Edna Buxton/Denise Waverly\n*[[Matt Dillon]] as Jay Phillips\n*[[Eric Stoltz]] as Howard Caszatt \n*[[John Turturro]] as Joel Milner \n*[[Patsy Kensit]] as Cheryl Steed \n*[[Bruce Davison]] as John Murray \n*[[Jennifer Leigh Warren]] as Doris Shelley \n*[[Bridget Fonda]] as Kelly Porter\n*[[Chris Isaak]] as Matthew Lewis\n*[[David Clennon]] as Dr. 'Jonesy' Jones\n*[[Lucinda Jenney]] as Marion\n*[[Christina Pickles]] as Mrs. Buxton\n*[[Lynne Adams]] as Kindly Nurse\n*[[Richard Schiff]] as Audition Record Producer\n*[[Peter Fonda]] as Guru Dave (voice only)\n* [[Tegan West]] as M.C. at Talent Show\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe story is loosely based on the career arc of singer-songwriter [[Carole King]], who, like Denise, started out writing songs in the [[Brill Building]] for artists like [[Aretha Franklin]], [[The Drifters]], and [[Little Eva]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lennon |first=Troy |date=September 14, 2017 |title=The Brill Building pioneered assembly line pop music but left a legacy of hits |work=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/the-brill-building-pioneered-assembly-line-pop-music-but-left-a-legacy-of-hits/news-story/1d9673e48098d06f10a5c96ed603ce13 |access-date=30 October 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=September 19, 1996 |title=Director Allison Anders Recreates a Bygone Era of Popular Music |url=https://freshairarchive.org/segments/director-allison-anders-recreates-bygone-era-popular-music |access-date=2022-10-30 |website=Fresh Air Archive: Interviews with Terry Gross |language=en}}</ref> The character Jay Phillips is loosely modeled on [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |date=March 28, 2021 |title=Allison Anders looks back at Grace of My Heart (1996) |url=https://www.tvstoreonline.com/blogs/tv-movie-news-updates/allison-anders-grace-of-my-heart-1996 |access-date=2022-10-30 |website=TVStoreOnline |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAllison Anders said she was inspired to make the film as a fan of the girl group [[The Shangri-Las]].
