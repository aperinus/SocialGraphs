He is divorced and now works for his ex-wife, Mary, an editor. A biking accident lands Lopez in a hospital.\n\nOne day, he hears a violin being played beautifully. Investigating, he encounters Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless man with [[schizophrenia]], who is playing a violin when Lopez introduces himself. During the conversation that follows, Lopez learns that Ayers once attended [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]].\n\nCurious as to how a former student of such a prestigious school ended up on the streets, Lopez contacts Juilliard but learns that no record of Ayers graduating from it exists. Though at first figuring a man with schizophrenia who's talented with a cello isn't worth his time, Lopez soon realizes that he has no better story to write about. Luckily, he soon learns that Ayers ''did'' attend Juilliard, but dropped out after two years.\n\nFinding Ayers the next day, Lopez says he wants to write about him. Ayers doesn't appear to be paying attention. Getting nowhere, Lopez finds and contacts Ayers' sister, who gives the columnist the information he needs: Ayers was once a [[child prodigy]] with the cello, until he began displaying symptoms of schizophrenia at Juilliard. Unable to handle the voices, Ayers dropped out and ended up on the streets due to the delusion that his sister wanted to kill him. Without a cello, he has resorted to playing a two-string violin.\n\nLopez writes his article. One reader is so touched that she sends a cello for Ayers. Lopez brings it to him and Ayers shows he is just as proficient as with a violin. Unfortunately, his tendency to wander puts both Ayers and the cello in danger, so Lopez talks him into leaving it at a shelter, located in a neighborhood of homeless people. Ayers is later seen playing for the homeless.\n\nA concerned Lopez tries to get a doctor he knows to help. He also tries to talk Ayers into getting an apartment, but Ayers refuses. After seeing a reaction to music played at an opera house, Lopez persuades another friend, Graham, a cellist, to rehabilitate Ayers through music. The lessons go well, though Ayers is shown to be getting a little too attached to Lopez, much to the latter's annoyance. Lopez eventually talks Ayers into moving into an apartment by threatening to abandon him.\n\nThrough Lopez's article, Ayers gains so much fame that he is given the chance to perform a recital. Sadly, he loses his temper, attacks Graham, and leaves. This convinces Lopez's doctor friend to get Ayers help. But when Ayers learns what Lopez is up to, he throws Lopez out of his apartment and threatens to kill him.\n\nWhile speaking with Mary, Lopez realizes that not only has he changed Ayers' life, but Ayers has changed his. Determined to make amends, Lopez brings Ayers' sister to L.A. for a visit. Ayers and Lopez make up. Later, while they all watch an orchestra, Lopez ponders how beneficial their friendship has been. Ayers still hears voices, but at least he no longer lives on the streets. In addition, Ayers has helped improve Lopez's relationship with his own family.\n\nIt is revealed at the end that Ayers is still a member of the [[LAMP Community]] \u2013 a Los Angeles nonprofit organization that seeks to help people living with severe mental illness \u2013 and that Lopez is learning how to play the guitar.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as [[Nathaniel Ayers]]\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Steve Lopez]]\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Mary Weston\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Graham Claydon\n* [[Lisa Gay Hamilton]] as Jennifer\n* [[Nelsan Ellis]] as David Carter\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Leslie Bloom\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Curt Reynolds\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as Flo Ayers\n* Justin Martin as Young Nathaniel Ayers\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Troubled Woman\n* [[Jena Malone]] as Cheery Lab Tech\n* [[Lemon Andersen]] as Uncle Tommy\n* [[Noel G.]] as Winston Street Cop\n* [[Artel Great]] as Leon\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film is based on the true story of [[Nathaniel Ayers]], a musician who developed [[schizophrenia]] and became homeless.
