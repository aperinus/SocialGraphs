In 2000, the film was nominated for and won a [[Genesis Award]] in the category of feature film. This was the first film produced by [[Spyglass Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=February 2018}}\nThe film examines the mind of [[anthropologist]] Ethan Powell who had been missing for a few years, living in the jungle of [[Uganda]]'s [[Bwindi Impenetrable Forest]] with [[mountain gorilla]]s. He is convicted of killing and injuring several supposed Wilderness Park Rangers in [[East Africa]], and is sent to prison. A bright young [[psychiatrist]], Theo Caulder, tries to find out why he killed them, but becomes entangled in a quest to learn the true history and nature of humankind, stating that [[civilization]] has steadily destroyed the natural world, advocating that humans abandon this. Eventually it is revealed that during the course of Powell's stay with the gorillas, they accepted him as part of their group; he was attempting to protect his [[Hominidae|great ape]] family when the [[poacher]]s arrived and started shooting them. He gets a hearing to reveal the truth, but an attack by a vicious guard on another prisoner causes Powell to be reminded of the killed gorillas, at which point he violently attacks the guard to stop him, is restrained and stops talking again. At the end of the film, Powell escapes from prison using a pen to dig out the lock on a window, and heads back to Africa.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Dr. Ethan Powell\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Dr. Theo Caulder\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Professor Ben Hillard\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Lynn Powell\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Dr. John Murray\n* [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] as Dacks\n* [[Ivonne Coll]] as Dr. Marzuez\n* [[John Aylward]] as Warden Keefer\n* [[Rex Linn]] as Alan\n* [[Tracey Ellis]] as Annie\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Foley\n* [[Verne Troyer]] as Gorilla\n* [[Tory Kittles]] as Prisoner\n\n==Production==\nIn production in 1998.
