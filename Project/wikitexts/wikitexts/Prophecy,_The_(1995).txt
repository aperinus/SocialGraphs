It was written and directed by [[Gregory Widen]] in his feature directorial debut, and is the first motion picture of [[The Prophecy (film series)|''The Prophecy'' series]]. It was followed by four [[sequel]]s. The film tells the story of the [[Archangel]] [[Gabriel]] (Walken) and his search for an evil soul on Earth, and a police detective (Koteas) who unknowingly becomes caught in the middle of an angelic civil war.\n\n== Plot ==\nThomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: Simon briefly enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, while [[Uziel (angel)|Uziel]], a lieutenant of the Archangel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of recently deceased Korean War veteran Colonel Arnold Hawthorne, and a thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds Hawthorne awaiting burial and sucks his soul out of his body.\n\nThe medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body has no eyes, [[hermaphroditism]], and the [[hematology|blood chemistry]] of an aborted [[fetus]]. His personal effects include an ancient Bible, with an expanded [[Book of Revelation]] that describes a second war in Heaven and prophecy that a \"dark soul\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon.\n\n[[Gabriel]] arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches a disappointed Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death. Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. Finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is cared for by her teacher, Katherine.\n\nAfter finding the burnt remains of what was once Uziel's body in the morgue, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it, and a win for the rebellious angels would make Heaven like Hell with Earth in its thrall. Gabriel tortures Simon, but he refuses to reveal its location, so Gabriel kills him. Mary shows signs of [[demonic possession|possession]] by Hawthorne, recounting an incident from Hawthorne's harrowing war experiences in first-person perspective. Meanwhile, Thomas examines Simon's remains and questions Katherine. In Hawthorne's home, he finds evidence of war crimes. Thomas visits a church to reflect in and is shaken by a verbal confrontation with Gabriel.\n\nAt school, Katherine finds Gabriel questioning the children. After he leaves, she rushes to Mary's home and finds Thomas. As Mary's condition worsens, Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she had seen Gabriel. They find angelic script and experience together a terrible vision of the angelic war. Returning to Mary, they find Gabriel and Jerry. Thomas kills Jerry, while Katherine distracts Gabriel when her wild gunshot misses him and blows up Mary's trailer home. They take Mary to a Native American site to be exorcised. In a hospital, Gabriel recruits a new unwilling assistant, Rachael, just as she dies of a terminal illness.\n\nLucifer confronts Katherine and tells her that \"other angels\" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to enter Heaven. He knows Gabriel plans to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obedient angels. He also knows that if Gabriel wins the war under his influence Heaven will ultimately devolve into another [[Hell]], which Lucifer considers \"one Hell too many\". Lucifer then appears to Thomas and advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith against him. When Gabriel arrives and attempts to disrupt the exorcism ritual, Thomas kills Rachael, and he and Katherine fight Gabriel. Gabriel defeats them and moves to kill Katherine.\n\nLucifer appears, encouraging the Natives to complete the exorcism. Lucifer confronts Gabriel, telling him that his war is based upon arrogance, which is evil, making it Lucifer's territory. Lucifer tells Gabriel he needs to go home and rips out his heart. Simultaneously Mary expels Hawthorne's soul. The \"enemy ghost\" starts to attack Thomas and Katherine, but a bright light from Heaven appears and destroys it. Lucifer asks Thomas and Katherine to \"come home\" with him, but they refuse. Lucifer drags Gabriel to Hell. As morning comes, Thomas comments on the nature of faith and what it means to truly be human.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Gabriel]]\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Thomas Dagget\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Katherine\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Simon\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Lucifer]]\n* [[Amanda Plummer]] as Rachael\n* Moriah Shining Dove Snyder as Mary\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Jerry\n* [[Steve Hytner]] as Joseph\n* J.C.
