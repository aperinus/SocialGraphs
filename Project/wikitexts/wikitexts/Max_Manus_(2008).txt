The story follows Manus ([[Aksel Hennie]]) from the [[Winter War]] against the [[Soviet Union]], through the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]] until peacetime in 1945. The film is based on Max Manus's own books ''Det vil helst g\u00e5 godt'' and ''Det blir alvor'', as well as other accounts and historical documentation. The film stays largely historically accurate, but omits some events, and moves some of the supporting characters around to show them taking part in events in place of others. The production included around 1,800 extras and 2,000 workers behind the cameras.\n\nThe film's [[premiere]] was attended by King [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]], [[Tikken Manus|\"Tikken\" Manus]], [[Gunnar S\u00f8nsteby]] along with other notable individuals. Reception from critics was largely positive. ''Max Manus'' also sparked a public debate about the role of the Norwegian resistance movement during the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupation]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter fighting the Soviets as a [[Foreign support of Finland in the Winter War|volunteer]] during the [[Winter War]] in Finland, [[Max Manus]], haunted by his experiences, returns to Norway, finding it occupied by the Nazis. He joins with the [[Norwegian resistance movement]] in their fight against the Germans, producing illegal propaganda, but his cell is soon detected and he is arrested after jumping out a window. After being hospitalised, he manages to escape to Scotland where he receives [[British Commando]] training in sabotage and disinformation. Returning to Norway with his friend [[Gregers Gram]], his first mission is an attack on German supply ships. He is spectacularly successful, and becomes a special target for the local [[Gestapo]] chief [[Siegfried Fehmer]]. Manus, however, avoids capture, and with Gram and [[Gunnar S\u00f8nsteby]] forms the so-called \"[[Oslogjengen|Oslo Gang]]\" and along with others, receives a medal from the [[Haakon VII of Norway|Norwegian king]].\n\nStockholm in neutral Sweden becomes a meeting point for Norwegians in [[Allies of World War II|allied]] military service. Here Gram introduces Manus to \"Tikken\", a married woman who works as a Norwegian contact for the British consulate, and the two develop a relationship. As the war becomes more brutal, many of Manus' friends lose their lives, and he starts to blame himself for being the survivor. Late in the war he succeeds in sinking the [[SS Donau (1929)|SS Donau]] which was sunk on 16 January 1945. After the war, at a loss due to his poor prospects, he meets an imprisoned Fehmer and realises that everyone is just a victim of the meaninglessness of war.<ref name=\"NF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfondet.no/icm.aspx?PageId=1848&Hgf=1|title=Max Manus|date=3 December 2007|publisher=Norwegian Film Fund|language=no|accessdate=17 December 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217191904/http://www.filmfondet.no/icm.aspx?PageId=1848&Hgf=1|archive-date=17 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Aksel Hennie]] as [[Max Manus]]\n* [[Agnes Kittelsen]] as [[Tikken Manus|Ida Nikoline \"Tikken\" Lindebr\u00e6kke]]\n* [[Nicolai Cleve Broch]] as [[Gregers Gram]]\n* [[Petter N\u00e6ss]] as [[Martin Linge]]\n* Kyrre Haugen Sydness as [[Jens Christian Hauge]]\n* Knut Joner as [[Gunnar S\u00f8nsteby]]\n* [[Viktoria Winge]] as Solveig Johnsrud\n* Christian Rubeck as [[Kolbein Lauring]]\n* Mats Eld\u00f8en as [[Edvard Tallaksen]]\n* [[Ken Duken]] as [[Siegfried Fehmer]]\n* [[Stig Henrik Hoff]] as Police Captain Eilertsen\n* [[P\u00e5l Sverre Valheim Hagen|P\u00e5l Sverre Hagen]] as [[Roy Nielsen]]\n* [[Jakob Oftebro]] as Lars Emil Erichsen\n* [[Petter N\u00e6ss]] as [[Martin Linge|Captain Martin Linge]]\n* [[Ron Donachie]] as [[J.

Borgersrud accused [[Norway's Resistance Museum]], which was assisting the film makers in a consultancy capacity, of distorting history.
