Murakami ([[Toshiro Mifune]]), a newly-promoted homicide detective in the Tokyo police, has his [[Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket|Colt]] pistol stolen while riding on a crowded trolley. He chases the [[pickpocket]], but loses him. A remorseful Murakami reports the theft to his superior, Nakajima, at police headquarters. After Nakajima encourages him to conduct an investigation into the theft, the inexperienced Murakami goes [[undercover police|undercover]] in the city's backstreets for days, trying to infiltrate the illicit [[arms dealing|arms market]]. He eventually locates a dealer who agrees to sell him a stolen gun, but when Murakami arrests the dealer's girlfriend at the exchange, he is distraught to find that she doesn't know anything about his missing gun.  \n\nForensics experts determine that Murakami's Colt was used to mug a woman of \u00a540,000, and Nakajima partners him up with veteran detective Sat\u014d ([[Takashi Shimura]]). After Sat\u014d skillfully questions the girlfriend, the two detectives learn that the dealer, who is using the alias of \"Honda\", is a fan of [[baseball]]. They stake-out a local high-attendance baseball game looking for Honda and manage to lure him away from the crowd before taking him into custody. A ration card found on his person reveals that the gun was \"loaned\" to Yusa, a disenchanted war veteran who has become involved with the [[yakuza]] to support himself. The detectives interview Yusa's sister, one of his yakuza associates, and his sweetheart, showgirl Harumi Namiki ([[Keiko Awaji]]); none of these visits produce any useful leads.\n\nMurakami's gun is used again, this time to murder another woman during a robbery. He and Sat\u014d continue to question Namiki at her mother's house. She is still reluctant to talk, so Sat\u014d leaves to trace Yusa's movements, while Murakami remains behind hoping that Namiki's mother can persuade her to begin cooperating. Sat\u014d finds the hotel where Yusa is staying. He tries to call Murakami, but just as he is about to reveal Yusa's location, the criminal (having overheard the hotel owners mention that a cop is present) shoots Sat\u014d twice before making his escape. Sat\u014d, badly wounded but alive, staggers out the door, passes out from blood loss, and is taken to the hospital. A distraught Murakami is forcibly removed from the hospital on Nakajima's orders when he becomes disruptive and starts wailing loudly. \n\nThe following morning, Namiki has a change of heart and informs Murakami that Yusa called and asked her to meet him at a train station so they can skip town. Murakami races to the station and manages to get a positive identification on Yusa by taking into account his age, white suit stained with mud, and left-handedness, three tips he has collected over the past few days. Yusa tries to flee and Murakami pursues him into the forest; Yusa is able to wound him in the arm, but then panics, wastes his last two bullets, and throws the gun away. Murakami, in spite of his injury, wrestles Yusa down, handcuffs him, retrieves the gun, and takes him into custody. Days later at the hospital, Sat\u014d has recovered and congratulates Murakami on receiving his first citation. Murakami admits that he sympathizes with Yusa's situation, to which Sat\u014d replies that he will lose such sentimentality as he arrests more people and that he should focus on getting ready for the cases that he will need to solve in the future.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Toshiro Mifune]] as Detective Murakami\n*[[Takashi Shimura]] as Detective Sat\u014d\n*[[Keiko Awaji]] as Harumi Namiki\n*[[Eiko Miyoshi]] as Harumi's mother\n*[[Noriko Honma]] as Wooden Tub Shop woman\n*[[Isao Kimura]] as Yusa\n*[[Minoru Chiaki]] as Girlie Show director\n*[[Ichiro Sugai]] as Yayoi Hotel owner\n*[[Gen Shimizu]] as Police Inspector Nakajima\n*[[Reikichi Kawamura]] as Officer Ichikawa\n*[[Noriko Sengoku]] as Girl\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:StrayDogShadows.jpg|right|thumb|150px|alt=Black-and-white image of two men facing the left of frame, walking in front of a brick wall.

Each man holds a pistol in his right hand.|''Stray Dog'' contains elements associated with [[film noir]] and was a precursor to the [[buddy cop film]] genre.]]\nKurosawa mentioned in several interviews that his script was inspired by [[Jules Dassin]]\u2019s ''[[The Naked City]]'' and the works of [[Georges Simenon]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://imagesjournal.com/2004/reviews/straydog/ |title=DVD Review of Stray Dog by Gary Morris|publisher=imagesjournal.com|access-date=2011-10-12}}</ref> ''Stray Dog'' was the first time that Kurosawa collaborated with [[Ryuzo Kikushima]], with the former sending the latter to the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]] to collect cases that they could use as the basis for the script of the film, choosing a case where a young detective lost his pistol. It also takes inspiration from contemporary debates in Japan about the ''\"apr\u00e8s-guerre\"'' generation with its apparent rise in delinquency and crime. Despite being one of Akira Kurosawa's most critically renowned postwar films, ''Stray Dog'' was not always held in such high regard by the director himself. Kurosawa initially said that he thought little of the film, calling it \"too technical\" and also remarking that it contains \"all that technique and not one real thought in it.\" His attitude had changed by 1982, when he wrote in his autobiography that \"no shooting ever went as smoothly,\" and that \"the excellent pace of the shooting and the good feeling of the crew can be sensed in the finished film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/323-stray-dog-kurosawa-comes-of-age |title=''Stray Dog'': Kurosawa Comes of Age|publisher=criterion.com|access-date=2011-10-12}}</ref> However, Kurosawa was rankled when someone from the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]] accused him of infecting a dog with rabies for the movie's opening shot of a canine panting in the heat. He had to write a letter to American [[occupation of Japan|occupation]] officials denying the allegation, and he later said that he never felt \"a stronger sense of regret over Japan's losing the war.\"<ref>Conrad, David A. (2022). ''Akira Kurosawa and Modern Japan'', 68-73, McFarland & Co.</ref>\n\n''Stray Dog'' was mostly shot at a studio rented by Toho with more than thirty sets built. [[Ishir\u014d Honda]], who would go on to direct several monster movies such as ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'', served as Kurosawa's chief assistant, shooting second unit footage for the 10-minute long sequence of Murakami roaming through Tokyo, and often doubled for [[Toshiro Mifune]] in waist shots. Kurosawa later praised Honda for helping him capture the atmosphere of post-World War II Tokyo. The film marks the first appearances of [[Minoru Chiaki]], [[Noriko Honma]] and [[Isao Kimura]] in a Kurosawa film. Chiaki would go on to appear in ten more movies by the director, Honma played the medium in ''[[Rashomon]]'' and Kimura played the youngest of the seven samurai in ''[[Seven Samurai]]''. The baseball game scene was shot at the actual [[Korakuen Stadium]].\n\nThe film was also the debut of then sixteen-year old [[Keiko Awaji]], who plays Harumi Namiki, a dancer and the girlfriend of Yusa, the villain of the film. She was chosen over other actresses because of her mean looks. Kurosawa described her as being too spoiled and that she could not cry on cue, and never cast her again in another movie of his. Awaji would later regret her unprofessionalism during filming. Kurosawa became so close with his cast and crew during filming that he remarked later it was difficult for him to break up with them after filming was completed.<ref>Akira Kurosawa: Something Like an Autobiography, 1982</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Stray Dog'' was distributed theatrically by [[Toho]] in Japan on 17 October 1949.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=74}} The film received a theatrical release in the United States by Toho International with English subtitles on August 31, 1963.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=74}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Stray Dog'' holds a 95% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1020312-stray_dog |title=Stray Dog (Nora inu) (1963) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=July 1, 2020}}</ref> At the 1950 [[Mainichi Film Concours]] it won awards for Best Actor (Takashi Shimura), Best Film Score (Fumio Hayasaka), Best Cinematography ([[Asakazu Nakai]]) and Best Art Direction ([[S\u014d Matsuyama]]).{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=73}}{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=74}} The film was included on ''[[Kinema Junpo]]''{{'s}} \"Best Ten\" of the year at third place.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=74}} In 2009 the film was voted at No. 10 on the list of ''The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time'' by Japanese film magazine [[Kinema Junpo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mubi.com/topics/greatest-japanese-films-by-magazine-kinema-junpo-2009-version|title=Greatest Japanese films by magazine Kinema Junpo (2009 version)|access-date=2011-12-26|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711021342/http://mubi.com/topics/greatest-japanese-films-by-magazine-kinema-junpo-2009-version|archive-date=July 11, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Remake==\nThe film was remade in 1973, under the name ''[[Nora inu (1973 film)|Nora inu]]'', for [[Shochiku]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=74}} It was later remade for television in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nora inu |url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/norainu/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114215856/http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/norainu/ |archive-date=January 14, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Galbraith IV |first=Stuart |title=The Toho Studios Story: A History and Complete Filmography  |year=2008 |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-1461673743}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Stray Dog}}\n*{{IMDb title|0041699}}\n*{{Amg movie|47270}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/604-excess-in-stray-dog ''Excess in Stray Dog''] an essay by Chris Fujiwara at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n*''[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1949/by001430.htm Stray Dog]'' {{in lang|ja}} at the [[Japanese Movie Database]]\n\n{{Akira Kurosawa}}\n\n[[Category:1949 films]]\n[[Category:1940s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Japanese black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Japanese crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1940s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Film noir]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Akira Kurosawa]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Police detective films]]\n[[Category:Procedural films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Akira Kurosawa]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ryuzo Kikushima]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Fumio Hayasaka]]\n[[Category:Films produced by S\u014djir\u014d Motoki]]\n[[Category:1940s police procedural films]]\n[[Category:Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department in fiction]]\n[[Category:Shintoho films]]\n[[Category:Japanese detective films]]"}]}}}}
