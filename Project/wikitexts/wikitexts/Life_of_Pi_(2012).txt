Based on [[Yann Martel]]'s 2001 novel [[Life Of Pi|of the same name]], it stars [[Suraj Sharma]], [[Irrfan Khan]], [[Rafe Spall]], [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] and [[Adil Hussain]] in lead roles. The storyline revolves around two survivors of a shipwreck. One is a sixteen-year-old Indian boy named Pi Patel ([[Suraj Sharma]]) and the other is a ferocious [[Bengal tiger]] named Richard Parker that are on a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] stranded in the [[Pacific Ocean]] for 227 days.\n\nThe film began development shortly after the release of the book and would see directors [[M. Night Shyamalan]], [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] involved at various stages before the hiring of Lee. Filming was split between [[India]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Montreal]] in 2011, with [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm & Hues Studios (R&H)]] handling the visual effects work.\n\nThe film had its [[premiere|worldwide premiere]] as the opening film of the 50th [[New York Film Festival]] at both the [[Walter Reade Theater]] and [[Alice Tully Hall]] in [[New York City]] on September 28, 2012. It was theatrically released in the U.S. that same day by [[20th Century Fox]]. ''Life of Pi'' became a critical and commercial success, having grossed over $609 million. It was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Picture \u2013 Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]]. At the [[85th Academy Awards]] it had eleven nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Ang Lee.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Canada, a young writer meets middle-aged Pi Patel. The writer has been told that Pi's life story would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells the writer the following story about his life:\n\nPi's father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after [[Piscine Molitor]], a famous swimming pool in France. In secondary school in [[Pondicherry]], he adopts the Greek letter \"[[Pi]]\" as his nickname to avoid bullying. He is raised in a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] family, but at 12 years old, he is introduced to [[Catholic Christianity|Christianity]] and then [[Islam]], and decides to follow all three religions as he \"just wants to love God\". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi's family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in the animals, especially a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.\n\nWhen Pi is 16, his father announces that due to \"[[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]]\" they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship [[Shipwrecking|founders]] while Pi is on deck. He struggles to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a lifeboat. A freed zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the [[Mariana Trench]], drowning his family. Pi briefly sees what appears to be a survivor, but it turns out to be Richard Parker.\n\nAfter the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by an orangutan. A spotted hyena emerges from under a [[tarpaulin]], forcing Pi to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker comes out from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover for several days.\n\nPi fashions a small raft from flotation vests which he tethers to the lifeboat to be safe from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then swims toward Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him back into the boat. One night, a humpback whale destroys the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat, and realizes that caring for the tiger is helping to keep himself alive.\n\nWeeks later, they encounter a floating island. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of [[meerkat]]s, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat and drink and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn acidic. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.\n\nPi and Richard Parker leave the island, eventually reaching [[Mexico]] after over 200 days at sea. Pi is heartbroken that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. Pi is rescued and brought to a hospital. Insurance agents for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by humans: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable sailor for the zebra, and the ship's brutish cook for the hyena. The cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He then kills Pi's mother, after which Pi kills him and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story, but leave without questioning Pi further.\n\nWhen the writer recognizes the parallels between the two stories, Pi says that it does not matter which story is true because his family died either way. He asks which story the author prefers, and the author chooses the first, to which Pi replies, \"and so it goes with God\". Glancing at a copy of the insurance report, the writer reads that Pi survived his adventure \"in the company of an adult Bengal tiger.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Suraj Sharma]] as Piscine Molitor \"Pi\" Patel, age 16/17\n** [[Irrfan Khan]] as Pi Patel, adult\n** Gautam Belur as Pi Patel, age 5\n** [[Ayush Tandon]] as Pi Patel, age 11/12\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as [[Yann Martel|The Writer]]\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as Gita Patel, Pi's mother\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Santosh Patel, Pi's father\n* Ayan Khan as Ravi Patel, Pi's older brother, age 7\n* Mohamed Abbas Khaleeli as Ravi, age 13/14\n* Vibish Sivakumar as Ravi, age 18/19\n* [[Andrea Di Stefano]] as the Priest\n* Shravanthi Sainath as Anandi, Pi's adolescent girlfriend\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as the Cook\n* Wang Po-chieh as Sailor\n* [[Jag Huang]] as Sailor\n* [[Mythili Prakash]] as Pi's wife\n* Raj Patel as Ravi Patel, Pi's son (named in honor of Pi's brother)\n* Hadiqa Hamid as Adita Patel, Pi's daughter\n* Elie Alouf as Francis \"Mamaji\" Adirubasamy\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=I wanted to use water because the film is talking about faith, and it contains fish, life and every emotion for Pi.
