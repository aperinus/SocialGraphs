The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist [[Roger Waters]]. [[The Boomtown Rats]] vocalist [[Bob Geldof]] plays rock star Pink, who, driven insane by the death of his father, constructs a physical and emotional wall to protect himself.\n\nLike the album, the film is highly [[metaphor]]ical, and symbolic imagery and sound are present most commonly. The film is mostly driven by music and features little dialogue from the characters. Despite its turbulent production and the creators voicing their discontent about the final product, the film received generally positive reviews and has an established [[cult following]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\nAt the beginning of the film, Pink is a depressed rock star who appears motionless and expressionless while remembering his father. A [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals how his father was killed defending the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio beachhead]] during [[World War II]] in Pink's infancy. Pink's mother raises him alone. A young Pink later discovers relics from his father's military service and death. An [[animation]] depicts the war, showing that the death of the people was for nothing. Pink places a bullet on the track of an oncoming train within a tunnel, and the train that passes has children peering out of the windows wearing face masks.\n\nAt school, he is caught writing poems in class and is humiliated by the teacher, who reads a poem from Pink's book. However, it is revealed that the poor treatment of the students is because of the unhappiness of the teacher's marriage. Pink recalls an oppressive school system, imagining children falling into a meat grinder. He then fantasizes about the children rising in rebellion and burning down the school, throwing the teacher onto a bonfire. As an adult, Pink remembers his overprotective mother and his marriage. During a phone call, Pink realises that his wife is cheating on him. Another animation shows that his traumatic experiences are represented as a \"brick\" in the metaphorical wall he constructs around himself that divides him from society.\n\nPink then returns to the hotel room with a [[groupie]], only for him to destroy the room in a fit of violence, scaring her away. Depressed, he thinks about his wife and feels trapped in his room. He then remembers every \"brick\" of his wall. His wall is shown to be complete, and the film returns to the first scene.\n\nNow inside his wall, he does not leave his hotel room and begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves all his body hair and watches television. A flashback shows young Pink searching through the trenches of the war, eventually finding himself as an adult. Young Pink runs in terror and appears at a railway station, with the people demanding that the soldiers return home. Returning to the present, Pink's manager finds him in his hotel room, drugged and unresponsive. A paramedic injects him to enable him to perform.\n\nIn this state, Pink thinks he is a dictator, and his concert is a fascist rally. His followers attack blacks, gays and Jews. He then holds a rally in London. The scene includes images of animated marching hammers that [[goose-step]] across ruins. Pink then stops hallucinating and screams, \"STOP!\" deciding he no longer wants to be in the wall. He is then seen cowering in a bathroom stall, quietly singing to himself as a security guard walks past him. In a climactic animated sequence, Pink, as a rag doll, is on trial for \"showing feelings of an almost human nature\". His teacher and wife accuse him, while his mother tries to take him home. His sentence is \"to be exposed before his peers,\" and the judge gives the order to \"tear down the wall!\". Following a prolonged silence, the wall is smashed as Pink can be heard screaming. Pink is not seen again. Back to live action, several children are seen cleaning up a pile of debris, with a freeze-frame on one of the children emptying a [[Molotov cocktail]] as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bob Geldof]] as Pink\n** Kevin McKeon as Young Pink\n** David Bingham as Little Pink\n* [[Christine Hargreaves]] as Pink's mother\n* [[Eleanor David]] as Pink's wife\n* [[Alex McAvoy]] as Teacher\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as Rock manager\n* [[Michael Ensign]] as Hotel manager\n* [[James Laurenson]] as Pink's father\n* [[Jenny Wright]] as American groupie\n* [[Margery Mason]] as Teacher's wife\n* Ellis Dale as English doctor\n* [[James Hazeldine]] as Lover\n* Ray Mort as Playground father\n* Robert Bridges as American doctor\n* [[Joanne Whalley]], [[Nell Campbell]], Emma Longfellow, and Lorna Barton as Groupies\n* [[Phil Davis (actor)|Philip Davis]] and [[Gary Olsen]] as Roadies\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{See also|The Wall}}\n\n=== Concept ===\nIn the mid-1970s, as [[Pink Floyd]] gained mainstream fame, songwriter [[Roger Waters]] began feeling increasingly alienated from their audiences:<blockquote>Audiences at those vast concerts are there for an excitement which, I think, has to do with the love of success. When a band or a person becomes an idol, it can have to do with the success that that person manifests, not the quality of work he produces. You don't become a fanatic because somebody's work is good, you become a fanatic to be touched vicariously by their glamour and fame. Stars\u2014film stars, rock 'n' roll stars\u2014represent, in myth anyway, the life as we'd all like to live it. They seem at the very centre of life. And that's why audiences still spend large sums of money at concerts where they are a long, long way from the stage, where they are often very uncomfortable, and where the sound is often very bad.<ref name=\"eras\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0xAUXaBYqoC | title=Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, 1954\u20131984 | publisher=Popular Press | author=Curtis, James M. | year=1987 | page=283 | isbn=0-87972-369-6 | access-date=27 February 2016 | archive-date=30 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430031120/https://books.google.com/books?id=F0xAUXaBYqoC | url-status=live }}</ref></blockquote>\nWaters was also dismayed by the \"executive approach\", which was only about success, not even attempting to get acquainted with the actual persons of whom the band was composed (addressed in an earlier song from ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'', \"[[Have a Cigar]]\").

EMI suggested that Parker talk to Waters, who had asked Parker to direct the film. Parker instead suggested that he produce it and give the directing task to Gerald Scarfe and [[Michael Seresin]], a cinematographer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schaffner | first=Nicholas | title=Saucerful of Secrets | publisher=Dell Publishing | pages=244\u2013245}}</ref> Waters began work on the film's screenplay after studying scriptwriting books. He and Scarfe produced a special-edition book containing the screenplay and art to pitch the project to investors. While the book depicted Waters in the role of Pink, after screen tests, he was removed from the starring role<ref>{{cite book |last=Schaffner | first=Nicholas | title=Saucerful of Secrets | publisher=Dell Publishing | pages=245\u2013246}}</ref> and replaced with [[New wave music|new wave]] musician and frontman of the [[Boomtown Rats]], Bob Geldof.<ref name=\"PM\"/> In ''[[Behind the Music|Behind the Wall]]'', both Waters and Geldof later admitted to a story during casting where Geldof and his manager took a taxi to an airport, and Geldof's manager pitched the role to the singer, who continued to reject the offer and express his contempt for the project throughout the fare, unaware that the taxi driver was Waters' brother, who told Waters about Geldof's opinion.\n\nSince Waters was no longer in the starring role, it no longer made sense for the feature to include Pink Floyd footage, so the live film aspect was dropped.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schaffner | first=Nicholas | title=Saucerful of Secrets | publisher=Dell Publishing | page=246}}</ref> The footage culled from the five ''Wall'' concerts at [[Earl's Court]] from 13\u201317 June 1981 that were held specifically for filming was deemed unusable also for technical reasons as the fast [[Panavision]] lenses needed for the low light levels turned out to have insufficient resolution for the movie screen. Complex parts such as \"[[Hey You (Pink Floyd song)|Hey You]]\" still had not been properly shot by the end of the live shows.<ref>Pink Floyd's The Wall, page 83</ref> Parker convinced Waters and Scarfe that the concert footage was too theatrical and that it would jar with the animation and stage live action. After the concert footage was dropped, Seresin left the project and Parker became sole director.<ref>Pink Floyd's The Wall, page 105</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Pink Floyd Their Mortal Remains - 2017-10-13 - Andy Mabbett - 57 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Blank of a mask worn by children in the classroom scenes; displayed at the [[Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains]] exhibition.]]\nParker, Waters and Scarfe frequently clashed during production, and Parker described the filming as \"one of the most miserable experiences of my creative life.\"<ref name=\"Pink Floyd's The Wall, page 118\">Pink Floyd's The Wall, page 118</ref> Scarfe declared that he would drive to [[Pinewood Studios]] carrying a bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]], because \"I had to have a slug before I went in the morning, because I knew what was coming up, and I knew I had to fortify myself in some way.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.floydianslip.com/pink-floyd/interviews/gerald-scarfe.php|title=Interview: Gerald Scarfe|date=5\u20137 November 2010|publisher=Floydian Slip|access-date=22 June 2016|archive-date=16 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716083512/http://www.floydianslip.com/pink-floyd/interviews/gerald-scarfe.php|url-status=live}}</ref> Waters said that filming was \"a very unnerving and unpleasant experience\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring production, while filming the destruction of a hotel room, Geldof suffered a cut to his hand as he pulled away the Venetian blinds. The footage remains in the film. It was discovered while filming the pool scenes that Geldof did not know how to swim. Interiors were shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], and it was suggested that they suspend Geldof in [[Christopher Reeve]]'s clear cast used for the ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' flying sequences, but his frame was too small by comparison; it was then decided to make a smaller rig that was a more acceptable fit, and he lay on his back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Geldof | first=Bob | title=Is That It? | publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson}}</ref> In [[Nicholas Schaffner]]'s book ''Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey'' (1991) it is claimed that the body cast from the film ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' (1984) was actually used instead.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schaffner |first=Nicholas |year=1991 |title=Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey |publisher=Harmony Books |isbn=0-517-57608-2 }}</ref>\n\nThe war scenes were shot on [[Saunton Sands]] in North Devon, which was also featured on the cover of Pink Floyd's ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' six years later.<ref>Storm Thorgerson and Peter Curzon.

[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film the approval rating of 72% based on 29 critic reviews, with the average score of 7.3 out of 10.

Ebert described ''The Wall'' as \"a stunning vision of self-destruction\" and \"one of the most horrifying musicals of all time ... but the movie is effective. The music is strong and true, the images are like sledge hammers, and for once, the rock and roll hero isn't just a spoiled narcissist, but a real, suffering image of all the despair of this nuclear age. This is a real good movie.\" Siskel was more reserved in his judgement, stating that he felt that the film's imagery was too repetitive. However, he admitted that the \"central image\" of the fascist rally sequence \"will stay with me for an awful long time.\" In February 2010, Ebert added ''The Wall'' to his [[The Great Movies|Great Movies]] list, describing the film as \"without question the best of all serious fiction films devoted to rock.

One seemingly blatant reference is Pink's detachment from the world as he locks himself away in his room before a show and shaves himself down while suffering a mental break. During a mental breakdown, Barrett shaved his head and face before showing up to a band rehearsal (after already having been removed from the band). However, Bob Geldof, who plays Pink in the film, refused to shave his head for this part of the performance.\n\nAnother influence was the declining state of pianist, [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]], who was allegedly struggling with [[cocaine]] addiction at the time.

A second documentary about the film was produced in 1999 entitled ''Retrospective: Looking Back at The Wall'' that includes interviews with Waters, Parker, Scarfe, and other members of the film's production team.

Guitarist David Gilmour dismissed the album as a collection of songs that had been rejected for ''The Wall'' project, but were being recycled.
