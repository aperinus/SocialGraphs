The story follows Professor Paris Catalano (Plummer), who travels to Venice following the trail of the last known appearance of [[Nosferatu (word)|Nosferatu]] (Kinski), who was seen at [[Carnival of Venice|Carnival]] in 1786. Catalano learns through a [[s\u00e9ance]] that the vampire is seeking eternal death, and tries to put an end to its existence once and for all.\n\nAfter securing Kinski for the lead of Nosferatu, producer August Caminito planned a sequel to [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]''. Caminito originally secured [[Maurizio Lucidi]] as the director but later felt that film would be better with a more well known director and a higher budget, leading Lucidi to be dropped as the director in favor of [[Pasquale Squitieri]]. Squiteri made several changes to the script which did not appeal to Caminito, which led to him paying Squiteri and terminating his contract. This led to further budget cuts in the film and hiring [[Mario Caiano]] on as the director. After clashing with Kinski on set, Caiano left the film leading Caminito to direct the film himself. During filming, Kinski would not follow rehearsal and demanded changes in the actors appearing in the film and often had lighting changed dramatically on set. According to second unit director [[Luigi Cozzi]], Kinski's behaviour on set became so erratic that the entire crew left the set and did not return until Kinski apologized for his behaviour.\n\nAfter six weeks of filming, Caminito came to the conclusion that he did not have the entire film completed, but that he also could not continue with the project. This led to entire sections of the re-written screenplay by Caminito not being shot, and Caminito making do with what he had. The film premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on 9 September 1988 and it was later released theatrically in Italy.\n\n== Plot ==\nBritish Professor Paris Catalano travels to [[Venice]] to investigate the whereabouts of the infamous vampire [[Nosferatu]], whose last known appearance was during the Carnival of 1786. He is summoned there by the young Princess Helietta Canins, who believes that the vampire may be interred in a sealed tomb in the basement of her ancestral estate. Catalano believes that the vampire is searching for a way to end his immortal torment and actually be dead. Upon his arrival, Catalano notices that Helietta bears a striking resemblance to Nosferatu's long-lost love, Letizia. The Canins hold a [[s\u00e9ance]] at the house against the warnings of their [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest, Father Don Alvise. The s\u00e9ance causes Nosferatu to awaken from his 200-year sleep, and escapes from his tomb.\n\nNosferatu roams Venice, soon locating Helietta's mother, Princess Catalano, and forces her out of her balcony, pushing her to her death below where she is impaled on an iron fence. During the elder princess's funeral, Catalano warns Helietta that Nosferatu can only be stopped by legitimate love. During a subsequent carnival celebration, Nosferatu stalks Helietta. He soon follows her home, and awakens her in her bed, seducing her. Meanwhile, Helietta's younger sister, Maria, witnesses part of the encounter.\n\nThe following morning, Helietta awakens and informs Catalano that Nosferatu has visited her. Later, in an alley, Nosferatu attacks Uta Barnveal, the wife of Father Alvise's peer, Dr. Barnveal, and chases her into an abandoned building, where he feasts on her blood. Nosferatu later approaches Catalano, Father Alvise, and his peer, Dr. Barneval, inside a castle. Barneval attempts to shoot Nosferatu to death, but Nosferatu's injuries disappear, and he proceeds to break Barnvela's rifle. Alvise, a cowardly priest, hides. Catalano fights back Nosferatu with his Holy Cross, but Nosferatu burns his hands while holding it. Nosferatu takes Helietta and leaves the castle. Despondent, Catalano packs his bags and leaves the Canins' mansion, announcing that only a pure woman willing to give Nosferatu her true love can destroy him. Subsequently, Catalano, who was dying of an unspecified illness, commits suicide by jumping from a bridge into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].\n\nMaria, who is seeking to fight Nosferatu so she can save her sister's soul, climbs to a tower and jumps to her death in an attempt to catch Nosferatu's attention. Nosferatu saves Maria from the fall and abducts her, taking her with him to an abandoned [[villa]]. Nosferatu explains to Maria that he wishes to die, but to do so, a [[Virginity|virgin]] woman has to give himself to him and love him unrepentantly, which Maria accepts. Meanwhile, Barneval, looking for his missing wife, travels to the villa with two friends. In the basement, they find what appears to be Nosferatu asleep in a coffin. When they drive a stake through his heart, however, his appearance morphs to that of Uta Barneval; they have in fact killed Uta, who had [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] to appear as Nosferatu. Upstairs, they locate the real Nosferatu in bed with Maria. Barneval ineffectively shoots him, and the shot goes through Nosferatu's back, severely injuring Maria. Nosferatu, enraged, kills Barneval's friends. While fleeing the villa, Barneval is lured into a garden by Helietta. Posing as Helietta, Nosferatu seduces Barneval before revealing that he had shapeshifted into her, and killing Barneval while showing his true form.\n\nNosferatu leaves the villa with a nude Maria in his arms, walking along a Venice canal. Dying, Maria asks Nosferatu to turn her into a vampire. He apparently refuses, saying that doing so would be an eternal punishment, the same he has endured for centuries. They hold each other while Nosferatu keeps walking, and they eventually disappear in the morning mist, leaving both of their fates a mystery.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Klaus Kinski]] as [[Count Orlok|Nosferatu]]\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Professor Paris Catalano\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Don Alvise\n* [[Barbara De Rossi]] as Helietta Canins\n* [[Yorgo Voyagis]] as Dr. Barneval\n* Anne Knecht as Maria Canins\n* Elvire Audray as Uta Barneval\n* [[Clara Colosimo]] as Medium\n* [[Maria Cumani Quasimodo]] as Princess\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Development and pre-production===\n[[File:Nosferatu a Venezia (1988) Kinski & De Rossi.png|thumb|Klaus Kinski and Barbara De Rossi in a scene of the film]]\nIn the mid-1980s, producer [[Augusto Caminito]] began producing horror and thriller films in Italy for foreign markets, such as [[Lucio Fulci]]'s ''[[Murder Rock]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=166}} Caminito was introduced to the script for ''Nosferatu in Venice'' by Carlo Alberto Alfieri who had written the screenplay and its original story with Leandro Lucchetti.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=166}} The script was originally a sequel to [[Werner Herzog]]'s film  ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' with Alfieri securing the star of that film, [[Klaus Kinski]], to headline in this sequel.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=166}}{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}} On December 17, 1985, Caminito and Kinski signed on for a two-film deal: ''Nosferatu in Venice'' and ''[[Paganini (1989 film)|Paganini]]'', the latter being a film Kinski had been working on getting produced since 1980.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}}\n\nThe film was initially to be directed by [[Maurizio Lucidi]].{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}} Among the crew was [[Luigi Cozzi]], who was a friend of Alfieri and worked on the set as a consultant and during post-production.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}} Cozzi recounts that Caminito felt the film would be a bigger success with a larger budget and a better-known director.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}} As a consequence, Caminito doubled the film's budget and fired Lucidi, who had only shot a few scenes without Kinski set at the [[Carnival of Venice]] in February 1986 .{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}} Caminito hired director [[Pasquale Squitieri]] and assembled a cast that included [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Barbara De Rossi]], and [[Yorgo Voyagis]].{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}} Squitieri re-wrote the script, setting it in the near future of 1996 Venice and hired a number of comic book artists to storyboard the film.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}}{{sfn|Zanotto|1986}} Caminito found the storyboard to be \"too baroque\"{{sfn|Loparco|2015|p=63}} and too expensive to film.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=167}} Squitieri refused to change his script and he had also been arguing with Kinski.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} As Caminito felt they could not lose Kinski, he terminated the contract with Squitieri and paid him the agreed sum before the director had the chance to shoot anything.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} This led to the hiring of [[Mario Caiano]], who had worked with Kinski in the past on films such as ''[[The Fighting Fists of Shanghai Joe]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} In mid-1986, Caiano completed casting on the film and Caminito re-wrote the script to make it match the films new reduced budget.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} Cozzi later stated that several characters and scenes were scrapped in this new re-write.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}}\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on August 25.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} Kinski refused to shave his head and wear fake fangs for the role. After arguing with Caiano on the first day of filming, Caiano stated later that Kinski would not listen to him when he called cut and found him the next day locked in his trailer with Caminito.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} Caiano learned that Caminito had promised Kinski that he would direct the film.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} According to Caminito, Caiano ran into Kinski's trailer and told him \"Now you're directing the movie!\".{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} Caminito felt determined to finish the film and took on directing the film himself, with Cozzi who helped him to direct scenes as a [[second unit director]].{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} According to Cozzi, Kinski would ignore the staging they did in rehearsals which led to the director of photography [[Antonio Nardi]] having to reset his lighting set-up from scratch as Kinski would not follow cues and would refuse to shoot re-takes.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=168}} Kinski had Caminito fire [[Amanda Sandrelli]]. When Voyagis' girlfriend, Anne Knecht, visited the set, Kinski demanded Caminito hire her as the female lead.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}} This led to the script being changed so that Maria was now Helietta's adopted daughter.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}}\n\nKinski demanded to and  did direct some scenes himself, which included scenes following him as Nosferatu in Venice at dawn.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}} Cozzi stated later that Kinski ended with about 10 hours of footage which consisted of Kinski walking around.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}} The boom man on set, Luciano Muratori, stated that during a scene where Nosferatu was to turn [[Barbara De Rossi]]'s character Helietta into a vampire which was supposed to be Kinski pretending to lean over and bite her neck led to Kinski inserting his fingers into the woman's vagina, which had her run from the set in tears.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}} Cozzi stated that Kinski went as far as slamming her to the floor and psychically and sexually assaulting her by biting her vagina.{{sfn|Edwards|2016|p=291}} [[Barbara De Rossi]] also stated in the documentary ''Kinski in Italy'' that she was \"assaulted one day. He never respected the script and he was always physical when he had something to do with women. [During filming] he grabbed my breasts and he hurt me.\" and that \"It was a mess. We were really scared. We never knew what could have come out of any scene.\"{{sfn|Edwards|2016|p=291}} According to Cozzi, at one point the entire crew abandoned the set in protest of Kinski who later apologized for his behaviour.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}} After six weeks of shooting in Venice, Caminito only had filmed about half the films script set in Venice and had an entire third of the script to film elsewhere.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}} Caminito could not film any further and attempted to compile the film from what footage he had shot.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Klaus Kinski

reviews, a reviewer credited as \"Yung.\" of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reviewed the screening at the Venice Film Festival, stating that the film was \"more kitsch than horror\"  while praising Tonino Nardi's camerawork and that Kinski was \"particularly memorable\".{{sfn|Yung.|1991}}\n\nFrom retrospective reviews, David Alexander writing in ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'' found the film to be \"confusing and scattershot\", with \"some awkwardly constructed scenes and goofy editing choices, though an overall atmosphere of Gothic dread helps somewhat\", and specifically noting Tonino Nardi's \"Beautifully hazy cityscapes in Venice\".{{sfn|Alexander|2014|p=43}} Alexander concluded that the film was \"more of a curiosity than anything\".{{sfn|Alexander|2014|p=43}} Matthew Edwards described the film \"difficult to review\" noting \"its rich atmospheric texture, evocative imagery of Venice and Kinski's wild performance.\" stating that \"Kinski paints his sadistic vampire with a sneering disgust for those around him\" as well as noting \"a decent performance by Christopher Plummer\" and also praised Nardi's cinematography stating he \"captures the canals and Gothic architecutre to stunning effect.\"{{sfn|Edwards|2016|p=290}}{{sfn|Edwards|2016|p=291}} Edwards concluded that the film was a \"monumental muddle that has flashes of brilliance but is rendered bereft of any coherency.\"{{sfn|Edwards|2016|p=290}} In his book on Italian gothic horror films of the decade, Roberto Curti stated that Plummer gave the best performance in the film, and the film had a few arresting if repetitive images, stating that Venice \"never becomes a living prescene in the film (as it does in, say, ''[[Don't Look Now]]'')\"{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=169}}{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=170}} Curti also stated that \"despite the script's ambitions, the dialogue is often poor if not ridiculous\" but that it was Kinski who ultimately \"drowns the film\".{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=170}} [[Kim Newman]] reviewed the film in ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' stating that the film was \"a mess [...] but a strangely beautiful mess, with an oddly poetic take on vampirism\"{{sfn|Newman|2021}} Newman noted that characters often die off screen and other characters often enter the plot without explaining who they are or what happens to them.{{sfn|Newman|2021}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Klaus Kinski
