The film premiered at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]] and received a [[limited release]] in August 2012.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe official website describes, \"Expanding on the themes they developed in ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992) and ''[[Chronos (film)|Chronos]]'' (1985), ''Samsara'' explores the wonders of our world from the mundane to the miraculous, looking into the unfathomable reaches of humanity's spirituality and the human experience. Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue, Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, [[guided meditation]].\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://barakasamsara.com/samsara/about | title = About Samsara | publisher=barakasamsara.com | accessdate=September 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Samsara'' is directed by [[Ron Fricke]] and produced by Mark Magidson. The pair had collaborated on ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992) and reunited in 2006 to plan ''Samsara''. They researched locations that would fit the conceptual imagery of [[sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]], to them \"meaning 'birth, death and rebirth' or 'impermanence'\". They gathered research from people's works and photo books as well as the Internet and [[YouTube]], resources not available at the time of planning ''Baraka''.<ref name=\"cs\">{{cite news | last=Douglas | first=Edward | url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=93727 | title=Interview: The Filmmakers Behind ''Samsara'' | work=[[ComingSoon.net]] | date=August 21, 2012 | accessdate=September 11, 2012 }}</ref> They considered using digital cameras but decided to film in [[70 mm film|70 mm]] instead, considering its quality superior.<ref name=\"portrait\">{{cite news | last=Rapold | first=Nicolas | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/movies/samsara-ron-frickes-cinematic-portrait-of-the-globe.html | title=Planetary Poetry, Woven Into a Movie | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 17, 2012 }}</ref> Fricke and Magidson began filming ''Samsara'' the following year.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Hayes | first=Dade | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965240 | title=Fricke directs 'Baraka' sequel | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 18, 2007 }}</ref> Filming lasted for more than four years and took place in 25 countries across five continents.<ref name=\"nabs\">{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118051456 | title=Oscilloscope Labs nabs doc 'Samsara' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=March 14, 2012 }}</ref> Three years into filming, the pair began assembling the film and editing it. They pursued several [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-up]] shoots to augment the final product.<ref name=\"cs\" />\n\nThe crew used three 70&nbsp;mm cameras for filming; two cameras manufactured by [[Panavision]] and one specialty [[Time-lapse photography|time-lapse camera]] designed by Fricke. While the scenes were captured on [[70 mm film|65 mm]] negative film, they were output to [[Digital Cinema Package]] (DCP), a digital output. Magidson described the process, \"We're doing a combination of what we think is the best of both technologies, the best way to image capture and then the best way to output. Once we get into the digital environment, we're able to refine the imagery, we're able to save shots that we'd have to otherwise trash really for various reasons.\" Where they cut their negatives for ''Baraka'', the negatives for ''Samsara'' were scanned then worked on digitally. The pair used the [[Telecine]] process to format the film to [[Apple ProRes|ProRes]] for the editing process and used [[Final Cut Pro|Final Cut]] for editing.<ref name=\"cs\" />\n\nThe crew shot from a [[bird's-eye view]] a scene of pilgrims surrounding the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca|Mecca, Saudi Arabia]]. A 40-floor building was recently constructed next to the mosque that surrounded the Kaaba, so the filmmakers were able to film the pilgrims with permission of the building's owner.<ref name=\"cs\" />\n\n===Music===\nThe score was composed by [[Michael Stearns]], [[Lisa Gerrard]] and Marcello De Francisci. Stearns previously collaborated with the filmmakers on ''Baraka'' and ''Chronos'', and Gerrard on ''Baraka''. Unlike ''Baraka'', ''Samsara'' was edited without music, and the composers worked on numerous sequences as separate pieces, before connecting. Magidson explained of the pieces, \"It's a piece of music you can listen to as music as well that interprets their feelings to know that imagery in that sequence visually, so they're kind of interpreting it musically.\" The scoring process lasted between six and seven months.<ref name=\"cs\" />\n\n===Filming locations===\n''Samsara'' was filmed in nearly one hundred locations across 25 countries over the course of exactly five years.

Fricke said, \"We just try to keep it in the middle and then we form little blocks of content and then we set them aside until we have enough. We did all of this without music or sound effects. We just let the image guide the flow and then we started stringing the blocks together.\"<ref name=\"cs\" /> Nicolas Rapold of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Samsara's lack of a specific message is \"a departure from similarly expansive, globally conscious nonfiction films in vogue now, like the critically acclaimed work of [[Michael Glawogger]] ('[[Workingman's Death]],' which depicts the same sulfur mines as 'Samsara') and [[Nikolaus Geyrhalter]] ('[[Abendland]]') that also serve as probing sociological critique.\"<ref>Rapold, Nicolas. \"Planetary Poetry, Women into a Movie: 'Samsara,' Ron Fricke's Cinematic Portrait of the Globe.\" New York Times.

Turan concluded, \"Some of the connections made are too obvious, like following images of ammunition with a portrait of a severely wounded veteran, while others are completely elusive.
