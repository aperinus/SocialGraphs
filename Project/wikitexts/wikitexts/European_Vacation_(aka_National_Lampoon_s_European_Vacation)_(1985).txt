The second film in [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'s [[National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)|''Vacation'' film series]], it stars [[Chevy Chase]], [[Beverly D'Angelo]], [[Dana Hill]], [[Jason Lively]], [[Victor Lanoux]], and [[Eric Idle]] with special appearances by [[John Astin]], [[Paul Bartel]], [[Maureen Lipman]], [[Willy Millowitsch]], [[Mel Smith]], and [[Moon Zappa]]. It tells the story of the Griswold family when they win an all-expense-paid trip to Europe as chaos of all sorts occur.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Griswold family competes in a game show called ''Pig in a Poke'' and wins an all-expenses-paid trip to [[Europe]]. In a whirlwind tour of western Europe, chaos of all sorts ensues.\n\nThey stay in a fleabag [[London]] hotel with a sloppy, tattooed [[Cockney]] desk clerk. While in their English rental car, a yellow [[Austin Maxi]], Clark's tendency to drive on the wrong side of the road causes frequent accidents, including knocking over a bicyclist they have many run-ins with. Later, Clark drives the family around the busy [[Lambeth Bridge]] roundabout for hours, unable to maneuver his way out of the chaotic traffic. At [[Stonehenge]], Clark accidentally backs the car into an ancient stone monolith, toppling all the stones like dominoes, which they do not even notice as they happily leave the scene.\n\nIn [[Paris]], the family wears stenciled berets, causing Rusty to be teased by young women at the [[Eiffel Tower]] observation deck. Clark offers to get rid of the beret for Rusty, but when he throws it away, another visitor's [[dachshund]] mistakes it for a Frisbee and jumps off the tower after it, landing safely in a nearby pond. The family's video camera is stolen by a passerby whom Clark had asked to take a picture of the family. Clark is also mocked by a French waiter for his terrible French, though he does not realize it. Later, Clark and Ellen visit a bawdy Paris can-can dance show, finding Rusty already there with a prostitute.\n\nNext in a [[West Germany|West German]] village, the Griswolds burst in on a bewildered elderly couple, who they mistakenly think are relatives but the couple ends up providing them dinner and lodging anyway, each family not being able to understand the other's language. Clark turns a lively Bavarian folk dance stage performance into an all-out street brawl, after which, while fleeing, he hastily knocks down several street vendors' stands and gets their [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] stuck in a narrow medieval archway.\n\nIn [[Rome]], the Griswolds rent a car at a travel office, but unknown to them, the men in charge are thieves, holding the real manager captive. The lead thief gives them a car with the manager in the trunk, claiming he lost the trunk keys. The next day, Ellen is shocked to discover that private, sexy videos of her from the family's stolen video camera have been used in a billboard advertising porn, leaving her completely humiliated. After screaming angrily at Clark (who had told her he had erased the video), Ellen storms off to their hotel where she encounters the thief who rented them the car. She confesses her recent troubles, still unaware that he is a criminal. The man then tries to get the car keys, which are in her purse, but fails. When the police arrive at the hotel, he kidnaps Ellen, prompting Clark to rescue her.\n\nOn the flight home, Clark falls into the pilot's cockpit and accidentally causes the plane to knock the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s torch upside down as Russell says \"The Griswolds are back\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n'''The Griswolds''':\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Clark Griswold, the patriarch of the Griswald family\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Ellen Griswold, the wife of Clark\n* [[Dana Hill]] as Audrey Griswold, the daughter of Clark and Ellen; She was previously portrayed by [[Dana Barron]] in the previous film\n* [[Jason Lively]] as Russell \"Rusty\" Griswold, the son of Clark and Ellen; He was previously portrayed by [[Anthony Michael Hall]] in the previous film\n\n'''Characters in America''':\n* [[John Astin]] as Kent Winkdale, the host of ''Pig in a Poke''\n* [[Paul Bartel]] as Mr. Froeger, the patriarch of the Froeger family that competed against the Griswalds on ''Pig in a Poke''\n* Cynthia Szigeti as Mrs. Froeger, the wife of Mr. Froeger\n* [[Malcolm Danare]] as Moe Froeger, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Froeger\n* Kevi Kendall as Ruth Froeger, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Froeger\n* [[William Zabka]] as Jack, Audrey's boyfriend\n* [[Sheila Kennedy]] as the Game Show Hostess #1.\n* [[Gary Owens]] as the voice of Johnny (uncredited), the announcer of ''Pig in a Poke''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/national/story/2015/feb/14/laugh-in-announcer-voiceover-vetergary-owens/369414/ |title=\u2018Laugh-In\u2019 announcer, voiceover veteran Gary Owens has died |website=www.texarkanagazette.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200703214246/https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/national/story/2015/feb/14/laugh-in-announcer-voiceover-vetergary-owens/369414/ |archive-date=2020-07-03}}</ref>\n\n'''Characters in England''':\n* [[Jeannette Charles]] as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], the Queen of The United Kingdom who appears in Ellen's dream sequence.\n* Peter Hugo as [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], the son of Queen Elizabeth II who appears in Ellen's dream sequence.\n* Julie Wooldridge as [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]], the wife of Prince Charles who appears in Ellen's dream sequence.\n* [[Mel Smith]] as a London hotel manager\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as a man in the bathroom\n* [[Maureen Lipman]] as a lady in the bed\n* [[Paul McDowell (actor)|Paul McDowell]] as First English motorist\n* [[Ballard Berkeley]] as Second English motorist\n* [[Eric Idle]] as The Bike Rider, an unnamed bike rider whom the Griswalds have several encounters with all over Europe\n* [[Derek Deadman]] as Taxi Driver\n\n'''Characters in France''':\n* [[Jacques Herlin]] as a French hotel desk clerk\n* Sylvie Badalati as Rusty's French girl\n\n'''Characters in Germany''':\n* [[Willy Millowitsch]] as Fritz Spritz, the supposed relative of Clark\n* Erika Wackernagel as Helga Spritz, the wife of Fritz and a supposed relative of Clark\n* [[Claudia Neidig]] as Claudia, Rusty's German girl\n\n'''Characters in Italy''':\n* [[Victor Lanoux]] as The Thief, an unnamed criminal who took over a travel office\n* Massimo Sarchielli as The Other Thief, the unnamed accomplice of the unnamed thief\n* [[Moon Zappa|Moon Unit Zappa]] as Rusty's California girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] received nominal credit for writing and story, due to the use of characters and ideas from the first ''Vacation'' film, but was not directly involved with ''European Vacation''.<ref>[https://ew.com/article/1994/12/02/john-hughes-resume/ Hughes's resume]</ref> Hughes would later state that Warner Bros had begged him for a sequel to ''Vacation'' but he declined at the time.
