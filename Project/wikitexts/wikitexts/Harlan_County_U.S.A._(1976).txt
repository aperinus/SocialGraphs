[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill, NC]]: [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] Library.</ref> a 1973 effort of 180 [[coal mining|coal miners]] and their wives against the [[Duke Power Company]]-owned Eastover Coal Company's Brookside Mine and Prep Plant in [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan County]], southeast [[Kentucky]]. It won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary]] at the [[49th Academy Awards]].\n\nIt was directed and produced by filmmaker [[Barbara Kopple]], then early in her filmmaking career. A former [[AmeriCorps VISTA|VISTA]] volunteer, she had worked on other documentaries, especially as an advocate of [[labor rights|workers' rights]].\n\n==Narrative==\nKopple initially intended to make a film about Kenzie{{Citation needed|date=March 2022|reason=who or what is Kenzie?}}, Miners for Democracy <!-- Is Kenzie a place or person? -->and the attempt to unseat [[W. A. Boyle|Tony Boyle]] as president of the [[UMWA]]. When miners at the Brookside Mine in [[Harlan County, Kentucky]], went on strike against [[Duke Power Company]] in June 1973, Kopple went there to film the strike, which the [[UMWA]] had helped to organize. She decided it was the more compelling subject, so switched the focus of her film. In all, she worked on the film for four years, including preparation and editing.<ref name=\"arnold\"/>\n\nWhen Kopple and her cameraman [[Hart Perry]] showed up on the picket line, the locals were suspicious of their intentions. Rumors flew that a \"hippie crew from New York\" was sniffing around the strike. When  confronted a striker who told people not to talk to her, she was told: \"Girl, you gotta tell people here what you're doin'.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Back to Harlan County, USA|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/2/23/back-to-harlan-county-usa|website=The Attic|access-date=July 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nKopple and her crew spent years with the families depicted in the film, documenting the dire straits they encountered while striking for safer working conditions, fair labor practices, and decent wages. She followed them to picket in front of the Stock Exchange in New York City, filming interviews with people affected by [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]], and miners being shot at while striking.\n\nThe company insisted on having a [[Strike action|no-strike clause]] in the proposed new contract.<ref>[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC14folder/HarlanCty.html Biskind, Peter]. \"Harlan County, USA, The miners' struggle\", ''Jumpcut: A Review of Contemporary Media'', no. 14, 1977, pp. 3-4. Last accessed: February 14, 2011.</ref> The miners were concerned that accepting such a provision would limit their ability to influence local working conditions. This sticking point became moot when, a few years after the strike, the [[UMWA]] folded the agreement won by this group of workers into a global contract.\n\nRather than using narration to tell the story, Kopple chose to film the words and actions of the people themselves. For example, when the strike breakers and others hired by the company show up early in the film\u2014the strikers call them \"gun thugs\"\u2014the company people tried to keep their guns hidden from the camera. As the strike dragged on for nearly a year, both sides eventually openly brandished their weapons.  Kopple felt it was important to continue filming (or pretend to, even when they were out of film) because the presence of the crew and staff support seemed to help keep the violence down.\n\nKopple did provide facts and statistics about the companies and the workers. She notes that Duke Power Company's profits increased 170 percent in a single year. Meanwhile, the striking miners, many of whom are living in squalid conditions without utilities or running water, were offered a 4% pay increase, at a time when the estimated [[cost of living]] increase was 7% for that same year.\n\n[[Joseph Yablonski]] was a passionate, populistic union representative who was loved by many of the miners. Yablonski had challenged [[W. A. Boyle|W.A. \"Tony\" Boyle]] for the presidency of the UMWA in 1969, but lost in an election widely viewed as corrupt. Later that year, Yablonski and his family were found murdered in their home. Early in the film Boyle is shown in good health. Later, after he was convicted of giving $20,000 to another union executive council member to hire the killers of Yablonski and his wife, Boyle appears frail, sickly and using a wheelchair; he was carried up the courthouse steps to face sentencing.\n\nAlmost a full year into the strike, miner Lawrence Jones was fatally shot during a scuffle. Jones was well liked, young, and had a 16-year-old wife, and a baby. In the documentary, his mother can be seen breaking down during his funeral, screaming and being carried away by male attendees. The strikers and management finally agreed to come to the bargaining table after his death.\n\nLois Scott, a leading woman in the mining community, is shown playing a major role in galvanizing the people in support of the strike. Several times she is seen publicly chastising those she feels have been absent from the picket lines. In one scene, Scott pulls a pistol from her bra.\n\n==Production==\n===Interviews===\n* Norman Yarborough - Eastover Mining president\n* Houston Elmore - UMW organizer\n* Phil Sparks - UMW staff\n* John Corcoran - Consolidation Coal president\n* John O'Leary - former US Bureau of Mines director\n* Donald Rasmussen - Black Lung Clinic, West Virginia\n* Dr. Hawley Wells Jr. \t\n* Tom Williams - Boyle campaigner\n* Harry Patrick - UMW secretary-treasurer\n* [[William E.

It reflected the culture of the people of Harlan County and showed the power of folk music that was a living part of their culture. Their stories were often told through the songs.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}\n\nThe music used in the film:\n* \"Dark as a Dungeon\", written by [[Merle Travis]], sung by David Morris<!-- not David Morris (musician) -->\n* \"Forty-Two Years\", written and sung by Nimrod Workman, instrumental by Kenny Kosek\n* \"Come All You Coal Miners\", written and sung by [[Sarah Gunnings]]\n* \"Mannington\", written by [[Hazel Dickens]], sung by David Morris\n* \"Black Lung\", written and sung by Hazel Dickens\n* \"Cold Blooded Murder\", written and sung by Hazel Dickens\n* \"Miners Life\", traditional instrumental performed by David Morris's Band\n* \"Which Side Are You On\", written and sung by Florence Reece (as Florence Reese), additional lyrics by Joshua Waletzky (as Josh Waletzky)\n* \"This Little Light of Mine\", written by Harry Dixon Loes (uncredited), sung by [[Bill Worthington]]\n* \"Coal Tattoo\", by [[Billy Edd Wheeler]] with additional lyrics, and sung by David Morris\n* \"Trouble Among Yearlings\", instrumental by Country Cookin'\n* \"Lone Prairie\", by Roscoe Holcomb and Wade Ward\n* \"They'll Never Keep Us Down\", written and sung by Hazel Dickens, accompanied by Lamar Grier, John Katarakis, John Otsuka, and Gary Henderson\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n\n[[Gary Arnold]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised the film, saying that Kopple \"has emerged with a stirring, revealing testament to the courage, tenacity and dignity of Appalachian men and women whose livelihood depends on coal mining. At their best Kopple and photographer Hart Perry bear unassuming, expressive witness to the experiences, aspirations and abiding grievances of the Brookside miners and their wives, who organized auxiliary strike actions.\"<ref name=\"arnold\">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1977/03/23/harlan-county-ardent-absorbing/17846a89-e4f6-46af-ad1f-170487593dea/ |first=Gary |last=Arnold |author-link=Gary Arnold |title='Harlan County': Ardent, Absorbing |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 23, 1977 |access-date=September 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen the film was re-released in 2006, critic [[Roger Ebert]] praised the film, writing \"The film retains all of its power, in the story of a miners' strike in Kentucky where the company employed armed goons to escort scabs into the mines, and the most effective picketers were the miners' wives -- articulate, indomitable, courageous. It contains a famous scene where guns are fired at the strikers in the darkness before dawn, and Kopple and her cameraman are knocked down and beaten.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/There-are-no-neutrals-there |title=Harlan County, U.S.A. movie review (2006) |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |via=[[RogerEbert.com]] |date=February 17, 2006 |access-date=February 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFilm critic Dennis Schwartz liked the documentary, yet found flaw in it providing only one point of view. He described the film as \"One of the better and more rousing labor strike films that calls attention to class war in America, though it doesn't offer enough analysis or balance on the issues (it sees the struggle solely through the miners' eyes)...The film does a good job chronicling the plight of the miners and telling their personal stories in a moving way, and the meaningful catchy coal mining songs add to the emotional impact of the historical event. [[Hazel Dickens]]'s folk song lyrics of 'United we stand, divided we fall' and [[Florence Reece]]'s lyrics for \"Which Side Are You On?\" give one the full-flavor of the miners' mood and the union fervor sweeping the mining community in the black mountains of Appalachia.\"<ref>[http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/harlancountyusa.htm Schwartz, Dennis].

Jerry Johnson, one of the striking Eastover miners, attributes the conclusion of the strike to the presence of Kopple and her film crew: \"The cameras probably saved a bunch of shooting. I don't think we'd have won it without the film crew. If the film crew hadn't been sympathetic to our cause, we would've lost. Thank God for them; thank God they're on our side.\"<ref name=\"The Making of Harlan County\">Interview with Jerry Johnson. ''The Making of Harlan County U.S.A.''

She reveals that the head scab, Basil Collins, wanted to hire someone to shoot her; however, the most dangerous incidents were the acts of violence by the mine owners against the miners. She said that the mine owners would hire \"local prisoners to beat people up, [shoot] at houses.
