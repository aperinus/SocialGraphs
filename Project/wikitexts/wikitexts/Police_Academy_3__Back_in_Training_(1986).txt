It is the third installment of the [[Police Academy (franchise)|''Police Academy'' franchise]] and the sequel to ''[[Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment]]''.\n\nDespite receiving generally negative reviews,<ref name=\"The Los Angeles Times\">{{cite news|title= Movie Reviews : 'Police Academy 3' Is Not The Ticket |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-03-24-ca-218-story.html|access-date=2010-11-11}}</ref> it was an overall box office success, earning $107 million against a budget of $12 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a large parking garage, Lt. Proctor ([[Lance Kinsey]]) and Commandant Mauser ([[Art Metrano]]) meet with Sgts. Chad Copeland ([[Scott Thomson (actor)|Scott Thomson]]) and Kyle Blanks (Brant van Hoffman) from Commandant Lassard's police academy. One of the two police academies is going to be phased out by the state government due to budgetary restraints, and Mauser wants them to ensure Lassard fails. Agreeing to the plan, they see it as revenge against Lassard for graduating them at the bottom of their class.\n\nThe following day, after the governor ([[Ed Nelson]]) announces he will appoint a committee to evaluate which academy will remain open, Mauser lightly cajoles him. Sgt. Jones ([[Michael Winslow]]) undermines him by subtly humiliating him in front of the governor. Commandant Lassard ([[George Gaynes]]) realizes how to win: with Sgt. Jones and Lt. Callahan ([[Leslie Easterbrook]]), he calls back Sgt. Mahoney ([[Steve Guttenberg]]), Sgt. Hooks ([[Marion Ramsey]]), Sgt. Hightower ([[Bubba Smith]]), and Sgt. Tackleberry ([[David Graf]]) as trainers for the new recruits.\n\nAmong those are Sgt. Fackler's ([[Bruce Mahler]]) wife Violet ([[Debralee Scott]]), who he opposes joining the force; Sweetchuck ([[Tim Kazurinsky]]) and Zed ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]), who have a history as Zed's gang had harassed him when he was a small shop owner; Karen Adams ([[Shawn Weatherly]]), a beautiful young woman Mahoney is attracted to but who rejects him; and Tackleberry's brother-in-law Bud Kirkland (Andrew Paris). Tomoko Nogata ([[Brian Tochi]]), initially a recruit of Mauser's academy, is transferred by Mauser into Lassard's instead, in the hopes of sabotaging it.\n\nAfter a few weeks of training, Nogata is lovestruck by Callahan. Sweetchuck contemplates quitting as Zed, who he has to room with, drives him crazy; but Tackleberry dissuades him, taking him under his wing. Copeland and Blanks make the recruits do things so the committee questions their competence. At the recruits' initial failure, Mauser and Proctor tease them. In retaliation, Mahoney tapes Mauser's eyes closed with extremely strong tape while doing a taste test. Proctor removes the tape, but unintentionally pulls off Mauser's eyebrows.\n\nLassard and Mahoney give a pep talk to the cadets before training resumes. Adams finally warms up to Mahoney after the talk, and they bond. At the policepersons' ball, Mahoney sees his prostitute friend ([[Georgina Spelvin]]), and after Proctor insults him and Adams, he has her trick Proctor into stripping naked and then locks him out of the hotel room. Trying to get back to the academy, Proctor accidentally enters the [[Blue Oyster Bar]]. Meanwhile, Mauser insults Lassard in front of the recruits by telling him that he is winning. Mahoney retaliates by giving a speech at the ball and puts the microphone in water, so when Mauser grabs it, he gets a shock.\n\nOn the final day of the cadet training/evaluation competition, one recruit from each academy attends the governor's ball (Proctor misunderstands and sends two, one of whom is portrayed by [[David James Elliott]]). Copeland and Blanks manipulate the computer system, deliberately sending cars to the wrong locations to help Mauser win. Hooks catches them, knocking them out cold. At the governor's party, a gang of thieves dressed as busboys rob the guests, taking the governor hostage. Mauser's cadets promptly faint upon being threatened by the thieves, but Lassard's cadet Hedges (David Huband) alerts the team before being taken hostage. Mahoney and company rush to rescue the governor. Mauser's academy is ineffective in reacting to the emergency, but Lassard's squad arrives in time to fight off the thieves and rescue the governor.\n\nThe governor shuts down Mauser's academy for failing to stop the robbery at the party, so Lassard's stays open. In the epilogue, Lassard speaks about the academy's gratitude for the \"many, many\" recruits. The graduating class salutes the camera as the film ends.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Police Academy characters}}\n\n=== Lassard Academy ===\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Sergeant Carey Mahoney\n* [[Bubba Smith]] as Sergeant Moses Hightower\n* [[David Graf]] as Sergeant Eugene Tackleberry\n* [[Michael Winslow]] as Sergeant Larvell Jones\n* [[Leslie Easterbrook]] as Lieutenant Debbie Callahan\n* [[Marion Ramsey]] as Sergeant Laverne Hooks\n* [[Bruce Mahler]] as Sergeant Douglas Fackler\n* [[George Gaynes]] as Commandant Eric Lassard\n* [[Scott Thomson (actor)|Scott Thomson]] as Sergeant Chad Copeland\n* Brant von Hoffman as Sergeant Kyle Blanks\n\n=== Mauser Academy ===\n* [[Art Metrano]] as Commandant Ernie Mauser\n* [[Lance Kinsey]] as Lieutenant Carl Proctor\n\n=== Lassard's Cadets ===\n* [[Debralee Scott]] as Cadet Violet Fackler\n* [[Tim Kazurinsky]] as Cadet Carl Sweetchuck\n* [[Brian Tochi]] as Cadet Tomoko Nogata\n* Andrew Paris as Cadet Bud Kirkland\n* [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] as Cadet Zed McGlunk\n* [[Shawn Weatherly]] as Cadet Karen Adams\n* David Huband as Cadet Hedges\n* Marcia Watkins as Cadet Sarah\n\n=== Mauser's Cadets ===\n* R.

The city skyline is clearly identifiable in the concluding 'yacht club' scenes. There is also the scene where the female recruit drives the police car up and over a dirt pile out of an alley. At the end of the alley, there is a Toronto Sun paper box. The city grid shown on the computerized dispatch system also shows a map of downtown Toronto streets, with the detail bordering between Trinity, Yonge, and Queen streets, and the Gardiner Expressway. In the scene in which Tackleberry shoots out the television screen with his gun, a [[Canada Dry]] soda machine is visible in the background next to a 'C' Plus soda machine, an orange flavoured sparkling beverage that is only sold in Canada.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\nThe film debuted at number one at the box office in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|title= Police Academy 3' Opening Steals Top Box-office Spot|work= Sun Sentinel|url= https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1986-03-27-8601180801-story.html|access-date=2010-11-09}}</ref> The film grossed $43,579,163 in the United States making it the 17th highest-grossing film of 1986 in the United States.<ref>{{Mojo title|policeacademy3}}</ref> It faced stiff box office competition from many other high-profile comedy films released early that year such as ''[[Back To School]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', ''[[Down And Out In Beverly Hills]]'', ''[[Legal Eagles]]'', ''[[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]]'', ''[[Running Scared (1986 film)|Running Scared]]'', ''[[The Money Pit]]'', ''[[Gung Ho (film)|Gung Ho]]'', ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', ''[[Wildcats (film)|Wildcats]]'', and ''[[Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling]]''.
