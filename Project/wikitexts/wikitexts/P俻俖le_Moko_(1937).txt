An example of the 1930s French movement known as [[poetic realism]], it recounts the trapping of a gangster on the run in [[Algiers]], who believes that he is safe from arrest in the [[Casbah of Algiers|Casbah]].\n\n==Plot==\nP\u00e9p\u00e9 le Moko, a criminal on the run from the police in [[Metropolitan France]], lives with his gang in the Casbah quarter of Algiers where he is beyond the reach of the local police. They seek ways to lure him out of his refuge and a plot results in the death of a fellow gangster, but not of P\u00e9p\u00e9. The wily Inspector Slimane sees his chance when he learns that P\u00e9p\u00e9, who is fed up with his enforced exile and with his mistress In\u00e8s, has been struck by meeting the glamorous French tourist Gaby, mistress of a visiting businessman. When Gaby agrees to an afternoon assignation in P\u00e9p\u00e9's hideout, Slimane leads her to believe that P\u00e9p\u00e9 has been killed and she reluctantly stays with her lover, who immediately books a passage back to France. When P\u00e9p\u00e9 is informed that Gaby is about to leave Algiers, he leaves the Casbah to find her and is arrested at the harbour by Slimane. As he watches the ship take her away for ever, he commits suicide with a knife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean Gabin]] as P\u00e9p\u00e9 le Moko\n* [[Gabriel Gabrio]] as Carlos\n* [[Mireille Balin]] as Gaby Gould, the beautiful Parisienne\n* [[Saturnin Fabre]] as Le Grand P\u00e8re\n* [[Fernand Charpin]] as R\u00e9gis\n* [[Lucas Gridoux]] as Inspecteur Slimane\n* [[Gilbert Gil]] as Pierrot\n* [[Marcel Dalio]] as L'Arbi\n* [[Charles Granval]] as Maxime\n* [[Gaston Modot]] as Jimmy\n* Ren\u00e9 Bergeron as Inspecteur Meunier\n* Paul Escoffier as Chief Inspecteur Louvain\n* [[Roger Legris]] as Max\n* [[Jean T\u00e9merson]] as Grav\u00e8r\n* [[Robert Ozanne]] as Gendron\n* [[Philippe Richard]] as Janvier\n* [[Georges P\u00e9clet]] as Barsac\n* [[Line Noro]] as In\u00e8s\n* [[Fr\u00e9hel]] as Tania\n* Olga Lord as A\u00efcha\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Carl]] as La m\u00e8re Tarte\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography for the film was shot at a replica of the Casbah at [[Joinville-le-Pont]], near Paris, and only exterior shots were filmed in Algiers.

It has many similarities with the American film [[Casablanca (film)|''Casablanca'']], which was released a few years later.\n\n==Remakes==\nThe film was remade in America in 1938 as ''[[Algiers (film)|Algiers]]'', starring [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Charles Boyer]], and again in 1948 as ''[[Casbah (film)|Casbah]]'', a musical starring [[Tony Martin (entertainer)|Tony Martin]], [[M\u00e4rta Tor\u00e9n]], [[Yvonne de Carlo]], and [[Peter Lorre]]. The title character's French accent and womanizing, as portrayed by [[Charles Boyer]] in the 1938 remake, inspired the name and comic premise of the [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon character, [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], introduced in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|last=LoBianco |first=Lorraine |title=Algiers |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/19052/Algiers/articles.html |access-date=March 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0029453}}\n* {{Amg movie|37686}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=86485}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|pepe-le-moko}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/242-pepe-le-moko ''P\u00e9p\u00e9 le Moko''] an essay by [[Michael Atkinson (writer)|Michael Atkinson]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Julien Duvivier}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pepe Le Moko}}\n[[Category:1937 films]]\n[[Category:1937 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1937 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:French romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:French crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1930s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:French gangster films]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films set in Algiers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Julien Duvivier]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert and Raymond Hakim]]\n[[Category:1930s French films]]"}]}}}}
