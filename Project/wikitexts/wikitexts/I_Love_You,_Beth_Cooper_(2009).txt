It is based on the [[I Love You, Beth Cooper|novel]] by [[Larry Doyle (writer)|Larry Doyle]], with Doyle also writing the film's screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\nOn graduation day at Buffalo Glenn High School, [[valedictorian]] Denis Cooverman confesses his love for head cheerleader and long time crush, beautiful Beth Cooper in his speech while also taunting vain rich girl Valli, ignorant bully Greg, and Beth's [[U.S. Army|Army]] soldier boyfriend Kevin; and urging his best friend Rich to finally admit he's gay. Afterwards, Denis invites Beth and her friends, Cammy and Treece, to a party he has planned at his house.\n\nAt Denis's house, his parents leave but not before his father revealing that he has [[condom]]s upstairs if he needs them. They arrive at Denis's house for the party. Kevin and his [[Hummer]] soon come barging in, with his Army buddies Dustin and Sean,  vowing revenge on Denis. They wreck the kitchen attempting to beat Denis up, but the five teenagers escape in Beth's [[Toyota Vitz#First generation .28XP10.3B 1998.E2.80.932005.29|Echo]].\n\nThey drive to a gas station hoping to get beer, but the clerk will not accept Beth's drivers license, which states that she is 37. Beth successfully bribes the clerk with a kiss, which makes Denis realize that she is not who he thinks she is.\n\nThe group starts a bonfire in an isolated section of town where Rich, Cammy, and Treece are chased by a stampede of cows after trying to [[Cow tipping|tip one over]]. When Denis puts on the [[KISS (band)|KISS]] song \"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\", Beth tells him that she was named after the song. Denis thinks it's cool that Beth has two \"headbangers\" for parents. Beth slowly warms to Denis, becoming aware that he genuinely loves her, much to her amazement.\n\nThey all jump in the Echo and Beth, a crazy reckless driver, drives without lights. They stumble upon Denis' parents, having sex in their car, by almost crashing into them. Rather than facing Denis' father with his pants down, Beth drives them away unseen, going to a private party at Valli's house. Kevin and his friends track them there, and Kevin challenges Denis to a fight. Greg briefly overpowers the three, in defence of Denis, then Beth crashes Kevin's Hummer through the front of Valli's house and rescues her four friends.\n\nBeth takes them to their vacant school, entering with her head cheerleader key. After showcasing their cheerleading routine, Beth decide they should all shower in the girls' locker room. Just as Denis is undressing to join the others, Kevin and his buddies arrive in  the Echo and jump Denis again. Rich attacks the thugs in a towel whipping 'duel', as he has been training for years after being towel whipped as a young kid. Rich towel-whips them unconscious down a flight of stairs, then the kids flee in the Echo, going to Treece's family cabin. Rich, Treece, and Cammy have a [[threesome]], while Beth and Denis enjoy the sun rise and finally share their first kiss.\n\nThey return to Denis' house, where his father is delighted to see he has 'hooked up', but makes him aware he still needs to be punished for leaving the house a wreck. Beth says goodbye, gives Denis a kiss, and touchingly thanks him for loving her. Denis tells her \"what's not to love\" and that she mustn't forget that. They promise to reunite at their high school reunion and agree to marry if they are both still single.\n\nAfter the girls leave, Rich proclaims to Denis that he might be [[gay]] after all, or perhaps [[bisexual]], but jokes that after the threesome, he's still more heterosexual than Denis. Denis informs Rich that he will not wait until the reunion to talk to Beth again, and that he is going to ask her out on [[Facebook]]. Richard tells Denis that he should make a grand gesture by going to her house with a boom box (a reference to ''[[Say Anything...]]'') and wait for her. They continue debating how Denis should go about asking Beth on a date.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus four inserted ahead of those in the closing credits scroll, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Beth Cooper\n* [[Paul Rust]] as Denis Cooverman\n* Jack Carpenter as Rich Munsch\n* [[Lauren London]] as Cammy\n* [[Lauren Storm]] as Treece\n* [[Shawn Roberts]] as Kevin\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Mr. C\n* [[Cynthia Stevenson]] as Mrs. C\n* [[Jared Keeso]] as Dustin\n* [[Brendan Penny]] as Sean\n* [[Marie Avgeropoulos]] as Valli Wooley\n* Josh Emerson as Greg Saloga\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn early 2008, producers announced the novel ''[[I Love You, Beth Cooper]]'' would be made into a film, with actress [[Hayden Panettiere]] in the title role.<ref>{{cite web | last=Tyler |first=Josh | url= http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Heroes-Cheerleader-Makes-A-Juno-Knockoff-7735.html | title = Heroes Cheerleader Makes A Juno Knockoff'' | website= Cinemablend.com }}</ref> Filming began in 2008, with a release slated for July 10, 2009.
