The film co-stars [[Kirstie Alley]] and [[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]. It was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] and produced by [[George Shapiro]] and [[Howard West]]. The original music score was composed by [[Danny Elfman]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn the last day of school before summer vacation, [[physical education]] teacher Freddy Shoop ([[Mark Harmon]]) is preparing for a vacation to [[Hawaii]] with his girlfriend, Kim. Vice principal Phil Gills ([[Robin Thomas]]) hands out paper slips informing several underachievers that they must attend [[summer school]] for remedial English. This includes: easily distracted Pam House ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]); \"nocturnal\" Larry Kazamias, a [[male stripper]] ([[Ken Olandt]]); football jock Kevin Winchester ([[Patrick Labyorteaux]]); pregnant Rhonda Altobello ([[Shawnee Smith]]); geeky Alan Eakian ([[Richard Steven Horvitz]]); dyslexic Denise Green ([[Kelly Jo Minter]]); intimidating Jerome Watkins ([[Duane Davis]]), and two horror-film-obsessed underachievers, Dave Frazier ([[Gary Riley]]) and Francis Gremp, a.k.a. \"Chainsaw\" ([[Dean Cameron]]).\n\nThe teacher scheduled to teach the class, Mr. Dearadorian ([[Carl Reiner]]), wins the lottery and immediately quits, so Gills seeks an emergency replacement among the teachers still on school grounds, but each manages to evade him, guessing what he wants them to do. He finally corners Shoop, blackmailing him into taking the job or lose [[tenure]].\n\nOn his first day, Shoop meets Robin Bishop ([[Kirstie Alley]]), who is teaching [[American History]] next door. He falls for her, but she is already dating Gills. His first day is a disaster. Most of the students slack around, and Jerome goes to the bathroom and doesn't return. A beautiful Italian transfer student, Anna-Maria Mazarelli ([[Fabiana Udenio]]), is transferred to the class in order for her to work on her English, much to the delight of Dave and Chainsaw. After some students inexplicably leave and the remaining ones attempt to leave class as well, Shoop admits he has no idea how to teach them. Rather than studying, he and the students spend their first few days having fun going on \"Field Trips\" to the beach, a theme park, and a petting zoo until Alan's grandmother finds out and tells Gills.\n\nGills threatens to fire Shoop unless his students pass the end-of-term test. Shoop negotiates with each teen to grant them a favor if they study. The kids agree, so he gives Denise driving lessons, accompanies Rhonda to [[Lamaze]] classes, gives Kevin [[American football|football]] lessons, allows Dave and Chainsaw to throw a party in his house and gives them rides to school, gives Larry a bed in the classroom, lets Chainsaw arrange a screening of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' in class and allows Pam to move in with him. Seeing he is still floundering as a teacher, Robin tells Shoop to make learning fun. He begins to grow closer to the kids. They study to pass their English basic skills exam, worried that Gills will fire him unless all his students pass.\n\nShoop is arrested, covering for Chainsaw and Dave after they are found in possession of alcohol. He calls Robin and she and Gills to bail him out of jail. Gills then inadvertently exposes his true self to Robin when he states he cares nothing for Shoop or his students and she overhears, causing her to storm off. Larry loses his stripper job when he is found out by his aunt and his mother, who go to the club where he works. The students make more demands on Shoop. He throws an English book against the [[chalkboard]] and, after listing his sacrifices to grant their favors, quits his job in anger. His students start feeling guilty, and scare off Shoop's dull replacement with a series of gory stunts reminiscent of ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre''. Finding Shoop moping on the beach whilst eating ice cream, they ask him to return, and he accepts.\n\nShoop and his students then begin preparing for the test in earnest, and even Jerome, who had \"gone to the bathroom\" weeks before, returns. The exam goes smoothly, despite Rhonda going into labor during the test; she later puts the child up for adoption. Gills tells Shoop the average of grades was below passing, so he is ready to fire him. However, the students' parents come to defend him. Due to the students' marked improvement, Principal Kelban ([[Francis X. McCarthy]]) grants Shoop tenure for his positive efforts.\n\nShoop returns to the beach with his dog and Robin. He asks her to a dinner date for the last time, and she accepts at last, kissing him in the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Mark Harmon]] as Freddy Shoop\n* [[Kirstie Alley]] as Robin Bishop\n* [[Robin Thomas]] as Vice Principal Phil Gills\n* [[Courtney Thorne-Smith]] as Pam House\n* [[Dean Cameron]] as Francis \"Chainsaw\" Gremp\n* [[Gary Riley]] as Dave Frazier\n* [[Patrick Labyorteaux]] as Kevin Winchester\n* [[Kelly Jo Minter]] as Denise Green\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as Rhonda Altobello\n* [[Richard Steven Horvitz|Richard Horvitz]] as Alan Eakian\n* [[Ken Olandt]] as Larry Kazamias\n* [[Fabiana Udenio]] as Anna-Maria Mazarelli\n* [[Duane Davis]] as Jerome Watkins (Bathroom Guy)\n* [[Tom Troupe]] as Judge Stuart R.
