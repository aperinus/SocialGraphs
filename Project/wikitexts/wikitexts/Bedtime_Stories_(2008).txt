It stars [[Adam Sandler]] in his first appearance in a family-oriented film alongside [[Keri Russell]], [[Jonathan Morgan Heit]], [[Laura Ann Kesling]], [[Guy Pearce]], [[Aisha Tyler]], [[Russell Brand]], [[Richard Griffiths]], [[Teresa Palmer]], [[Lucy Lawless]] and [[Courteney Cox]]. In the film, when a hotel handyman's stories to his niece and nephew come true, he keeps telling stories that become more outlandish. Sandler's production company [[Happy Madison]] and [[Andrew Gunn (producer)|Andrew Gunn]]'s company Gunn Films co-produced the film with [[Walt Disney Pictures]].\n\nThe film was theatrically released on December 25, 2008, by Disney. Despite receiving generally negative reviews from critics, it was a box office success, earning $212.9 million against an $80 million budget. As of 2022, it is Happy Madison's only film produced alongside Disney.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1974, Skeeter and Wendy Bronson are raised by their father Marty at the family business: the Sunny Vista Motel. However, despite being a good hotelier and host, Marty faces serious financial problems with the business and almost goes bankrupt. The motel is sold into a forced liquidation to Barry Nottingham, CEO and founder of hotel chain Nottingham Hotels, and rebuilt into a luxury hotel named the Sunny Vista Nottingham. In the present day, Skeeter is stuck as the hotel's hardworking repairman, despite Nottingham previously promising the late Marty to let Skeeter run the hotel if he showed promise. Nottingham announces plans to close the old hotel in order to build a new one, named the Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham, and appoints the snotty Kendall Duncan as its future manager, simply because he is dating Nottingham's daughter Violet.\n\nWendy asks Skeeter to watch her children, Patrick and Bobbi, because the school at which she is the principal is closing down and she is looking for a job in Arizona. The first night, Skeeter cynically tells them a bedtime story in which he casts himself as an underdog [[peasant]] in a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[fantasy]] world, who is unfairly passed over for promotion. Dissatisfied with the story\u2019s unhappy ending, the children add that he at least gets a chance at the promotion, and that it starts raining gumballs.\n\nThe next day, the story miraculously comes true: Nottingham, recalling the original promise he made to Marty, gives Skeeter a shot at the manager position; and on his way home, gumballs rain on Skeeter from a truck crash on an overpass. The next night, at the hotel, Skeeter tells a [[Western fiction|wild west]]-style story in which he, as a cowboy, is freely given an expensive horse named [[Ferrari]]. Going out later that night, he saves Violet from obnoxious paparazzi; he then sees Violet\u2019s Ferrari car and mistakenly thinks it is for him before Violet drives away. Skeeter realizes that only the children's additions to the stories come true. The night after that, Skeeter, with the children's help, tells a story about a chariot-riding stuntman in [[Ancient Greece]] who wins a date with the \u201cfairest maiden in the land\u201d. The next day, Skeeter ends up spending the day with and falling for his sister's friend and colleague Jill.\n\nOn Skeeter\u2019s last night with the children, he tells them a [[space opera]]-style story in which he triumphs over Kendall in a duel, but the children add that someone kills him with a fireball. Skeeter learns from Kendall that the new Nottingham Hotel will be at the location of the closing school. Skeeter and Kendall both make presentations on how best to market the hotel; with his heartfelt speech, Skeeter ultimately wins the managerial position. However, Skeeter, paranoid against fire due to the story, blasts a fire extinguisher at Nottingham's cake who then \u201cfires\u201d him.\n\nSkeeter, much to the surprise of Jill and Nottingham manages to get the hotel\u2019s location moved to the beachfront in Santa Monica; after which Skeeter and Jill race to the school before it can be demolished. While at the site, protesting the school\u2019s closure, Bobbi and Patrick sneak in the building to give their sign a better view. Skeeter and Jill arrive just in time to stop Kendall from setting off the highly sensitive explosives, saving the kids and the school. Sometime later, Skeeter marries Jill and opens a motel named after his father; with Kendall and his accomplice Aspen demoted to the motel's waiting staff. Violet marries Skeeter's best friend Mickey, giving him control of the Nottingham Empire. Nottingham quits the hotel industry to become a school nurse; and newlywed Skeeter and Jill have a baby boy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Skeeter Bronson\n** Thomas Hoffman as Young Skeeter\n* [[Keri Russell]] as Jill Hastings\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Kendall Duncan\n* [[Courteney Cox]] as Wendy Bronson\n** Abigail Droeger as Young Wendy\n* [[Russell Brand]] as Mickey\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Barry Nottingham\n** [[Tim Herlihy]] as Young Barry\n* [[Teresa Palmer]] as Violet Nottingham\n* [[Lucy Lawless]] as Aspen\n* [[Jonathan Morgan Heit]] as Patrick\n* [[Laura Ann Kesling]] as Bobbi\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Martin \"Marty\" Bronson\n* [[Aisha Tyler]] as Donna Hynde\n* [[Annalise Basso]] as Tricia Sparks\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Engineer\n* [[Allen Covert]] as Ferrari Guy\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as Hot Girl\n* [[Blake Clark]] and [[Bill Romanowski]] as Bikers\n* [[Kathryn Joosten]] as Mrs. Dixon\n** Melany Mitchell as Young Mrs. Dixon\n* [[Andrew Collins (actor)|Andrew Collins]] as Mr. Dixon\n* [[Mikey Post]] as Angry Dwarf\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Indian Chief/The Robber {{small|(Uncredited)}}\n* Arne Starr as Nottingham Employee/Senator/Cowboy/Spaceman {{small|(Uncredited)}}\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] and Bob Harvey as Party Guests\n}}\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Adam Shankman]] describes Adam Sandler's character as \"a sort of '[[Cinderfella]]' character\" and adds that \"'He's like [[Han Solo]]&nbsp;...'\"<ref>As quoted in \"First Look: Behind the scenes of Hollywood's biggest projects,\" ''Entertainment Weekly'' 1025 (December 12, 2008): 9.</ref> It was filmed on various locations in California, including in [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]] where Mr. Nottingham's palace is set.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0960731/locations|title = Bedtime Stories (2008) - IMDb|website = [[IMDb]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aluxurylimo.wordpress.com/2017/02/13/best-movies-filmed-in-thousand-oaks/|title=Best Movies Filmed in Thousand Oaks!|date=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Bedtime Stories\n| type       = Film score\n| artist     = [[Rupert Gregson-Williams]]\n| cover      = Soundtrackbedtimestories.png\n| alt        =\n| released   = December 23, 2008\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack, [[film score]]\n| length     = 35:11\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe score to ''Bedtime Stories'' was composed by [[Rupert Gregson-Williams]], who recorded his score with the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] at the Newman Scoring Stage at [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>[http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/162 Rupert Gregson-Williams scores ''Bedtime Stories''].
