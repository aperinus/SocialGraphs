The film stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Johnny Knoxville]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jaimie Alexander]] and [[Rodrigo Santoro]] and was written by Andrew Knauer. This was Arnold Schwarzenegger's first lead acting role since ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' in 2003. The film focuses on a tough small town [[sheriff]] and his deputies who must stop a dangerous drug lord from escaping to [[Mexico]] in a modified sports car.\n\nFilming took place in [[Belen, New Mexico]] and [[Nevada]] in late 2011. The film premiered on January 14, 2013, at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] and was released on January 18, 2013, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]], receiving mixed reviews from critics and grossing $48.3 million worldwide against a $45 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriff]] Ray Owens  resigns himself to a life of crime-fighting in the sleepy border town of [[Somerton, Arizona|Sommerton Junction]], [[Arizona]]. He left his [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] post following a bungled operation and leaving him wracked with failure and defeat after his partner was crippled and his team decimated. The crimes experienced in Sommerton range from the [[Mayor]] parking his Camaro in the [[fire lane]] to vintage arms collector Lewis Dinkum firing off guns at slabs of meat with the deputies. One night, Gabriel Cortez, an international [[drug lord]] and race car driver makes a daring escape from [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] custody in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and speeds off in a modified [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1]], taking Agent Ellen Richards as his hostage as he races southbound toward [[Mexico]] at speeds over 200&nbsp;mph. Agent John Bannister has a blockade set up in [[Bullhead City, Arizona]], but Cortez's men mow down the cops on site and clear the road for him to continue his getaway. Cortez also uses his extraordinary driving skills to immobilize two [[SWAT]] vehicles headed toward Summerton Junction. Before flying to Arizona, Agent Bannister has his team do a financial background check on all agents involved to learn about the mole, who has helped Cortez's escape.\n\nAt 4:30&nbsp;A.M, Owens dispatches deputies Jerry Bailey and Sarah Torrance to visit the residence of the local farmer Parsons, who has suddenly missed his usual milk delivery at the diner. After discovering that Parsons has been murdered, the deputies follow a trail of tire tracks that lead them to Cortez's henchman Thomas Burrell and his mercenary cutthroats, who are planting a mobile assault bridge across the canyon that marks the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S./Mexico border]]. Bailey is fatally shot in the middle of a shootout between the deputies and the thugs before Owens rushes in to bring his officers back to his precinct. Shortly after being notified by Agent Bannister of Cortez's presence, Owens gathers Torrance and senior Deputy Mike \"Figgy\" Figuerola. He also deputizes jailed local Frank Martinez, a former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] who is a veteran of the [[Iraq War]] with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] who developed a streak of never finishing what he started; because Bailey was his friend, Martinez insists that he will not falter. Finally, Owens recruits Dinkum to protect their town. Dinkum agrees only if he becomes a deputy and if he keeps the gun Owens had confiscated earlier. At 7:10&nbsp;A.M., Owens and his deputies, equipped with weapons from Dinkum's private museum, have the town's main road barricaded with cars when Burrell and his men arrive, prompting a lengthy firefight.\n\nArmed with a [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy gun]], Figuerola holds off the thugs before being injured by a sniper. Owens and Dinkum mow down a majority of the thugs with a [[Vickers machine gun]] mounted on the back of a school bus with Martinez providing cover fire, while Torrance snipes several gunmen on the rooftops. After Owens kills Burrell, Cortez's Corvette eventually arrives in town, veering past the barricade as Owens and the deputies shoot it. Cortez ejects Agent Richards from the car before speeding through a corn field. Suddenly, he encounters the mayor's Camaro commandeered by Owens before both cars collide with a [[swather]]. A dazed Cortez continues his escape on foot, but Owens meets him at the bridge. Owens ignores Cortez's bribe offers before both men fight each other. Despite sustaining slashes and stab wounds from Cortez's [[push dagger]], Owens defeats Cortez and handcuffs him before dragging him back into town using the battered and now roofless Camaro. Agent Bannister arrives to take Cortez back into custody and arrests Agent Richards for taking a bribe from Cortez and aiding in his escape. Deputies Figuerola and Dinkum are taken to the hospital to be treated for their wounds. Martinez turns in the deputy's badge, Bailey's badge, that Owens had given him earlier. Owens tells him to keep it, as he's earned it. As the Mayor sees what is left of his Camaro, Owens warns him about parking in the fire lane before he, Torrance and Martinez walk into the diner.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Sheriff Ray Owens\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Lewis Dinkum \n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Agent John Bannister\n* [[Jaimie Alexander]] as Deputy Sarah Torrance\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Deputy Mike Figuerola\n* [[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]] as Gabriel Cortez\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Frank Martinez\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Thomas Burrell\n* [[Zach Gilford]] as Deputy Jerry Bailey\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Agent Ellen Richards\n* [[Daniel Henney]] as Agent Phil Hayes\n* [[Tait Fletcher]] as Eagan\n* [[John Patrick Amedori]] as Agent Aaron Mitchell\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn June 2009, producer [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] and studio [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] pre-emptively picked up Andrew Knauer's [[spec script]] for ''The Last Stand''.

Belen was eventually chosen for having an abandoned area that could be used by the production company for as long as they needed it. Two existing buildings became landmarks of Sommerton, the local hotel and a condemned building that became the diner. Six vacant lots were filled with fa\u00e7ades, in which production designer Franco-Giacomo Carbone tried to put a mixture of styles to heighten the appearance of a frontier city with much history. While the producers originally wanted to actually film in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], they eventually found that downtown [[Albuquerque]] was visually similar and opted to film there instead, adding the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in the background during post-production. The town allowed filming from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., which did not interrupt local businesses. Jee-woon aimed to \"create a distinct look and change the style for every space\", with the chaotic environment of the FBI having cold tones and a smarter ambiance, and Sommerton having a \"peaceful small town feeling\" heightened by warm colors such as yellow and orange.<ref name=making/>\n\nGiven that di Bonaventura had a previous history with [[General Motors]] producing ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'', the company provided them with the required muscle cars. For Cortez' escape car, a [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)|Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1]] was picked for being advertised as \"the fastest car in a straight line ever made\". Eventually, a Camaro was provided for the car that Owens drove during the chase.<ref name=corn>\"Cornfield Chaos: Scene Breakdown\", ''The Last Stand'' DVD</ref> Seven cars of each model were provided by [[Chevrolet]], with two being returned in pristine shape.<ref>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title=Corvette ZR1 outshines Schwarzenegger in 'Last Stand'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/driveon/2013/01/18/last-stand-schwarzenegger-corvette-zr1/1845305/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=January 18, 2013|access-date=December 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022112921/https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/driveon/2013/01/18/last-stand-schwarzenegger-corvette-zr1/1845305/|archive-date=October 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The others had varied changes: some had an [[automated driving system]] built atop them for the scenes shot from inside the car, others were reinforced for collisions, and a few ended up mounted on rigs - with the Camaro dragged atop the Corvette having all its insides removed to make it lighter. A 24-acre cornfield outside Albuquerque was purchased to serve as the scenery for the climactic chase at the end, and that field was later added to the background of the Sommerton scenes. The chase had the problem of a snowstorm shortly before filming, which made the ground muddy and hard to drive on.<ref name=corn/>\n\nOn December 17, 2011, shooting of the film was briefly interrupted, but on January 3, 2012, it continued.
