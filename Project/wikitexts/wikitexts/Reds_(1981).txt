Beatty stars in the lead role alongside [[Diane Keaton]] as [[Louise Bryant]] and [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Eugene O'Neill]].\n\nThe supporting cast includes [[Edward Herrmann]], [[Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski]], [[Paul Sorvino]], [[Maureen Stapleton]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Ramon Bieri]], [[Nicolas Coster]], and [[M. Emmet Walsh]]. The film also features, as \"witnesses\", interviews with the 98-year-old radical educator and peace activist [[Scott Nearing]], author [[Dorothy Frooks]], reporter and author [[George Seldes]], [[civil liberties]] advocate [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]], and the American writer [[Henry Miller]], among others.\n\nBeatty was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], but lost to ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. Beatty, Keaton, Nicholson, and Stapleton were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively. Stapleton was the only one of the four to win.{{efn|Beatty and Keaton lost to [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] for ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' and Nicholson lost to [[John Gielgud]] for ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]''.}} Beatty became the third person to be nominated for Academy Awards in the categories Best Actor, Director, and, with co-writer [[Trevor Griffiths]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Original Screenplay]]\u2014losing again to ''Chariots of Fire''\u2014for a film nominated for Best Picture.{{Efn|This was done previously by [[Orson Welles]] for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and [[Woody Allen]] for ''[[Annie Hall]]''.}}\n\nIn June 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] revealed \"[[AFI's 10 Top 10]]\"\u2014the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres\u2014after polling over 1,500 people from the film community.

After meeting him for an interview on international politics that lasts an entire night, she realizes that writing has been her only escape from her frustrated existence. Inspired to leave her husband, Bryant joins Reed in [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]], and becomes acquainted with the local community of activists and artists, including anarchist and author [[Emma Goldman]] and the playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]. \n\nLater, they move to [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], to concentrate on their writing, becoming involved in the local theater scene. Through her writing, Bryant becomes a feminist and radical in her own right. Reed becomes involved in labor strikes with the \"Reds\" of the [[Communist Labor Party of America]]. Obsessed with changing the world, he grows restless and heads for [[St. Louis]] to cover the [[1916 Democratic National Convention]].\n\nDuring Reed's absence, Bryant falls into a complicated affair with O'Neill. Upon his return, Reed discovers the affair and realizes he still loves Bryant. The two marry secretly and make a home together in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]], north of New York City, but still have conflicting desires. When Reed admits his own infidelities, Bryant takes a ship to Europe to work as a war correspondent. After a flare-up of a kidney disorder, Reed is warned to avoid excessive travel or stress, but he decides to take the same path. Reunited as professionals, the two find their passion rekindled as they are swept up in the fall of Russia's Czarist regime and the [[Russian Revolution|events of the 1917 Revolution]].\n\nThe second part of the film takes place shortly after the publication of ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]]''. Inspired by the idealism of the Revolution, Reed attempts to bring the spirit of Communism to the United States, because he is disillusioned with the policies imposed upon [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Communist Russia]] by [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and the [[Bolsheviks]]. While attempting to leave Europe, he is briefly imprisoned and interrogated in [[Finland]]. He returns to Russia and is reunited with Bryant at the railway station in Moscow. By this point, Reed is growing progressively weaker as a result of spotted [[typhus]]. Bryant helps nurse the ailing Reed, who eventually dies.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Warren Beatty]] as [[John Reed (journalist)|John Silas \"Jack\" Reed]]\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as [[Louise Bryant]]\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as [[Max Eastman]]\n* [[Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski]] as [[Grigory Zinoviev]]\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Eugene O'Neill]]\n* [[Paul Sorvino]] as [[Louis C.

Armstrong]] as Government Agent\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nBeatty came across the story of John Reed in the mid-1960s. Executive producer and film editor [[Dede Allen]] remembers Beatty's mentioning making a film about Reed's life as early as 1966. Originally titled ''Comrades'', the first script was written by Beatty in 1969,{{efn|Attorney Ed Rubin, spokesman for Beatty, briefly outlined the origins of ''Reds'' in a UPI story about a lawsuit brought against Beatty and Paramount by William Greene and Helen Smith, authors of a study of Louise Bryant. Greene contended the film was based upon their work and they did not receive proper compensation. Rubin said Greene had initiated contact with Beatty in 1973, asking the actor to read his manuscript. Advised not to read it without making payment, Beatty paid Greene $250 in a written agreement. Beatty reportedly found the material without substantial value, and he vigorously denied the allegations made in the suit.<ref>[[United Press International]], March 19, 1982</ref>}} but the process stalled. In 1973, Beatty was offered the role of Reed in [[Sergei Bondarchuk]]'s Soviet film production ''[[Red Bells]]'', but declined, and felt further driven to make his own biopic about Reed to compete with the Soviet version.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Reds|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/56684-REDS?cxt=ymal|url-status=live|access-date=2022-01-06|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> \n\nIn 1976, Beatty found a suitable collaborator in [[Trevor Griffiths]], who began work but was delayed by his wife's death in a plane crash.<ref name=\"Biskind\">{{cite news | first=Peter|last = Biskind | title=Thunder on the Left: The Making of ''Reds'' | date=22 January 2007 | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/03/reds200603|work = Vanity Fair| author-link=Peter Biskind |archive-date=December 15, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215004022/https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/03/reds200603}}</ref> The preliminary draft of the script was finished in 1978. Beatty still had problems with it and he and Griffiths spent four and a half months fixing it. Beatty also collaborated with his friends [[Robert Towne]], [[Peter Feibleman]] and [[Elaine May]] to continue polishing the script after shooting had begun.<ref>{{cite book|last=Finstad|first=Suzanne|title=Warren Beatty: A Private Man|year=2006|publisher=Crown/Archetype|isbn=978-0-307-34529-5|page=440|chapter=Act 4: The Pro}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Deborah C.|title=Diane Keaton: Artist and Icon|year=2001|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1082-8|page=63|chapter=1978\u20131971: The Muse}}</ref>\n\n=== Financing ===\nBeatty achieved tremendous success with 1978's ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', which he produced, starred in, co-wrote and co-directed for [[Paramount Pictures]]. The success gave Beatty the clout to seek funding for his long nurtured ''Reds'' project, which was difficult to secure because of the controversial [[Communism|Communist]] subject matter and high price tag.<ref name=\"Biskind\" /> Beatty succeeded in interesting both [[Warner Bros.]] and Paramount, before the head of [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]] (Paramount's parent company), [[Charles Bluhdorn]], agreed to finance the project.<ref name=\"Biskind\" /> Bluhdorn soon had second thoughts, and attempted to dissuade Beatty with the promise of underwriting a $25 million alternative to ''Reds'' of Beatty's choice, but Beatty remained committed.<ref name=\"Biskind\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nBeatty originally had no intention of acting in the film or even directing it because he had learned on projects such as [[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|''Bonnie and Clyde'']] and ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' that producing a film alone is a difficult task. He briefly considered [[John Lithgow]] for the part of John Reed because the two were similar in appearance, but eventually Beatty decided to act in the film and direct it himself. Nicholson was cast as Eugene O'Neill over [[James Taylor]] and [[Sam Shepard]].<ref name=\"Biskind\" /> Nicholson was older than the young O'Neill he was playing, and having just completed work on [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick's]] ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', was in a \"most shambolic\" and \"grotesque\" physical state, according to producer [[Simon Relph]]. But Nicholson was committed to the role and appeared at the start of filming four months later having lost the weight he had gained and looking much younger.<ref name=\"Biskind\" />\n\nBeatty also chose to cast non-actors in supporting roles, including [[George Plimpton]], the editor of ''[[The Paris Review]]'', who played the character of Horace Whigham. [[Jerzy Kosi\u0144ski]], a Polish-American novelist, was asked to play the role of [[Grigory Zinoviev]], but he initially refused because he was a fierce anti-Communist and feared that he might be abducted by the [[KGB]] if he went to Finland to film.<ref name=\"Biskind\" />\n\n==== The Witnesses ====\nTo gain perspective on the lives of Reed and Bryant, Beatty filmed interviews with a group of men and women, referred to only as \"The Witnesses\", as early as 1971. ''American Film'' identified the witnesses in its March 1982 issue.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Newsreel: Who ''Were'' Those Eyewitnesses in ''Reds''?|journal=American Film|date=March 1982|page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn a capsule review for ''The New York Times'', film critic [[Vincent Canby]] refers to them as \"more than two dozen very, very old people, billed only as The Witnesses, whom Mr. Beatty interviewed about the Reeds and their long-gone times.\" He went on to say, \"More than anything else in ''Reds,'' these interviews give the film its poignant point of view and separate it from all other romantic adventure films ever made.\"<ref>{{cite web | last=Canby | first=Vincent | title=For American Movies, a Minor Renaissance | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/movies/film-view-for-american-movies-a-minor-renaissance.html | date=December 27, 1981 | access-date=November 23, 2016}}</ref> \"The most evocative aspect of the presentation is a documentary enhancement \u2013 interviews with a number of venerable 'witnesses,' whose recollections of the period help to set the scene, bridge transitions and preserve a touching human perspective\", wrote Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last=Arnold | first=Gary | title='Reds': The Passions of John Reed; A Film Adrift in the Maelstrom of History | date=December 4, 1981 | work=The Washington Post | location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>\n\n{{div col}}\n* Jacob Bailin, labor organizer\n* [[Roger Nash Baldwin]], founder, [[American Civil Liberties Union]]\n* John Ballato, early socialist\n* Harry Carlisle, writer, teacher\n* Kenneth Chamberlain, political cartoonist for ''[[The Masses]]''\n* [[Andrew Dasburg]], painter\n* Tess Davis, cousin of Louise Bryant's first husband\n* [[Will Durant]], historian\n* Blanche Hays Fagen, member of the Provincetown Players\n* [[Hamilton Fish III|Hamilton Fish]], congressman, Harvard classmate of John Reed\n* [[Dorothy Frooks]], recruiting girl, World War I\n* [[Hugo Gellert]], artist for ''[[The Masses]]''\n* Emmanuel Herbert, student in Petrograd, 1917\u201318\n* [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], entertainer\n* [[Oleg Kerensky]], son of [[Alexander Kerensky]]\n* [[Isaac Don Levine]], journalist, translator for Reed\n* [[Arthur Mayer]], film historian, Harvard classmate of Reed, also film distributor\n* [[Henry Miller]], novelist\n* Adele Nathan, member of the Provincetown Players\n* [[Scott Nearing]], sociologist, pacifist\n* [[Dora Russell]], delegate to [[Comintern]]\n* [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]], journalist\n* [[George Seldes]], U.S. journalist in Moscow\n* Art Shields, political activist\n* [[Jessica Smith (editor)|Jessica Smith]], political activist\n* [[Arne Swabeck]], member, Communist Labor Party\n* Bernadine Szold-Fritz, journalist\n* Galina von Meck, witness to Russian Revolution\n* Heaton Vorse, son of a Provincetown playwright\n* [[William Weinstone|Will Weinstone]], organizer, U.S. Communist Party\n* [[Rebecca West]], writer, novelist\n* Lucita Williams, wife of a Lenin biographer\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Filming ===\nWhen principal photography began in August 1979 the original intention was for a 15- to 16-week shoot, but it ultimately took one year. Filming took place in five different countries and at various points the crew had to wait for snow to fall in [[Helsinki]] (and other parts of Finland), which stood in for the [[Soviet Union]], and for rain to stop in Spain. Beatty asked the Soviet government for a permit to film in Moscow but was denied.<ref name=\":0\"/> A cottage in [[Kent]] was used to depict exteriors of the Reeds' home in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]], which in reality was a small early American [[saltbox house]]. The interior sets built at [[Twickenham Studios]] and [[EMI-Elstree Studios]] were also enlarged to evoke the \"flavor\" of the real home without reproducing it exactly.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/nyregion/the-story-of-reds-and-the-reed-house.html| title=The Story of 'Reds' and the Reed House| first=Marc|last=Myers| newspaper=New York Times| date=1982-01-03| access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> \n\nOther English locations included [[Frensham Common|Frensham Ponds]] in Surrey, which stood in for [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], the Smeaton Room of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] at [[One Great George Street]] for the Liberal Club meeting room in Portland, and the interior of [[Lancaster House]] for that of the [[Winter Palace]] in St. Petersburg.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.british-film-locations.com/Reds-1981| title=Reds (1981)| publisher=british-film-locations.com| access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> Another round of filming began in 1980 in [[New York City]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]], and [[Los Angeles]], including Paramount Studios.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro was banned from shooting the scenes shot in the U.S. after he was unable to gain an [[H-1B visa]] and because local [[Labor unions in the United States|trade unions]] blocked him from doing work on the film. The film encountered similar problems with [[trade unions in the United Kingdom]], and had to hire a separate British crew and pay British actors enrolled in [[Equity (British trade union)|Equity]] at [[Screen Actors Guild]]-rate salaries in order to allow American actors to film scenes in the U.K. These trade disputes caused the film to run heavily over budget, but the studio ultimately recouped its costs after financing the film with a low-interest loan from [[Barclays|Barclays Bank]] as part of a [[Tax shelter|tax-shelter]] plan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nActress [[Maureen Stapleton]] was due to begin shooting her scenes in London in November 1979, but she refused to take a plane because of a fear of flying. Because it was the wrong season for [[ocean liner]] travel, the production had to arrange for Stapleton to travel on a [[Tramp trade|tramp steamer]], which broke down in the [[Atlantic Ocean#North Atlantic|North Atlantic]] and had to be towed to [[Amsterdam]].<ref name=\"Biskind\" /> This caused another unwelcome delay. Beatty would also not stop the camera between [[take]]s, letting it roll continuously, and insisted on a large number of takes. Paul Sorvino said he did as many as 70 takes for one scene; Stapleton had to do 80 takes of one scene, which caused her to say to Beatty, \"Are you out of your fucking mind?\"<ref name=\"Biskind\" />\n\nBeatty and Keaton's romantic relationship also began to deteriorate during filming. [[Peter Biskind]] wrote about the making of ''Reds'', \"Beatty's relationship with Keaton barely survived the shoot. It is always a dicey proposition when an actress works with a star or director\u2014both, in this case\u2014with whom she has an offscreen relationship. Keaton appeared in more scenes than any other actor save Beatty, and many of them were difficult ones, where she had to assay a wide range of feelings, from romantic passion to anger, and deliver several lengthy, complex, emotional speeches.\" George Plimpton once observed, \"Diane almost got broken. I thought [Beatty] was trying to break her into what Louise Bryant had been like with John Reed.\" Executive producer [[Simon Relph]] adds, \"It must have been a strain on their relationship because he was completely obsessive, relentless.\"<ref name=\"Biskind\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe editing process began in early 1980, with as many as 65 people working on editing down and going over approximately 2.5 million feet of film.<ref name=\"Biskind\" /> Post-production ended in November 1981, more than two years after the start of filming. Paramount stated that the final cost of the film was $32 million, which would be the rough equivalent of around $80 million in 2007.<ref name=\"Biskind\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nThe film introduced the song \"Goodbye for Now\", written by [[Stephen Sondheim]], recorded by [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] and [[Claude Bolling]]. The song was later recorded by [[Barbra Streisand]] for ''[[The Movie Album (Barbra Streisand album)|The Movie Album]]'' (2003).\n\n== Reception ==\nReleased on December 4, 1981, ''Reds'' opened to critical acclaim. Despite its political subject matter and limited promotion by Beatty, the film became the [[1981 in film|13th-highest-grossing picture of 1981]], grossing $40 million in U.S. box office revenues, a figure that does not include the film's foreign box office revenues or its substantial subsequent earnings in home video, worldwide broadcast and cable television, and subscription television and streaming services.<ref name=\"box office\" /> Beatty later remarked that the film \"made a little money\" in box office returns. During the film's second and third weekends, there were concerns that it would become a massive flop like ''Heaven's Gate'', but it performed more strongly over the next month. The film was screened at the [[White House]] for President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] of the ''[[National Review]]'' wrote, \"Never exactly boring, sometimes entertaining, ''Reds'' is frequently irritating and finally disappointing\".<ref>{{cite book |title=John Simon on Film: Criticism 1982-2001|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Applause Books |year=2005 |page=19}}</ref> ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' published a largely negative review by [[Richard Grenier (newspaper columnist)|Richard Grenier]], who, among other things, saw the film as deliberately obscuring the protagonists' Communist politics and as exaggerating Bryant's talent and accomplishments.<ref name=Grenier>{{cite web| url = https://www.commentary.org/articles/richard-grenier/bolshevism-for-the-80s/| title = Grenier, Richard, \"Bolshevism for the 80's,\" ''Commentary'', March 1982.}}</ref> Conversely, in a retrospective article for ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'', Jim Poe called ''Reds'' \"one of the greatest and most faithful depictions of revolutionary politics\", praising its \"light touch and brisk storytelling\" for an epic, as well as its cinematography, shifts in mood and performances, in particular those of Keaton and Beatty.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2021/12/reds-history-film-warren-beatty-john-reed-louise-bryant-russian-revolution |title=Forty Years Later, Reds Is Still One of the Best Films Ever Made About Revolutionary Politics |last=Poe |first=Jim |date=2 December 2021 |website=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |access-date=25 December 2021}}</ref>\n\n''Reds'' holds an 89% \"Fresh\" rating on the [[Review aggregator|review aggregate]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10.
