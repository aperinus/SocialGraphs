Their peaceful life turns into a fight for survival when they are attacked by mysterious assailants.\n\n==Plot==\nA mother and daughter drive along a deserted country road at night while having an argument and crash their vehicle. The mother goes out of the car to check the engine but disappears. The daughter calls out for her but her call is repeated from the woods by a soft whispering voice. The daughter attempts to call the police, but is strangled to death.\n\nThe next day, Cl\u00e9mentine passes the crashed vehicle. That night, she is awakened by music outside. She investigates with her boyfriend Lucas and see that their car has been moved away from the house. As Lucas approaches it, the car is driven off. Lucas then finds the TV on and the tap running. He swings a [[Fireplace poker|poker]] at an intruder and shatters the door glass, his leg getting impaled by a large shard in the process. He and Cl\u00e9mentine lock themselves in the upstairs bathroom. Cl\u00e9mentine climbs into the attic to find an escape route. One of the intruders grabs her but she pushes him off a balcony. The couple flee from the house, locking the second intruder inside.\n\nThe pair limp into the woods only to encounter a fence. Due to his injury, Lucas cannot climb over it. He hides in the bushes as Cl\u00e9mentine heads for help. She sees the light from two flashlights and realises the intruders are catching up to her. She finds her car but is confronted by the intruders. Lucas hears Cl\u00e9mentine's screams and finds the car. He kills one of the attackers and discovers it is a teenage boy. He follows her screams and finds a manhole. In the sewers, Cl\u00e9mentine is being tortured by another teenager while a younger boy sits nearby, telling the torturer to stop. Lucas kills the teenager and with the younger boy's help, the two escape through the sewer system. The boy then turns on them and Cl\u00e9mentine watches in horror as Lucas is dragged away. As she is about to kill the boy, he asks, \"Why won't you play with us?\" Cl\u00e9mentine is also dragged off.\n\nThe film ends with a group of four hooded children emerging from the woods and running for a bus. On-screen text explains that the bodies of Cl\u00e9mentine and Lucas were found five days later and that the murderers were children aged 10\u201315. Upon interrogation, the youngest of the group explained that night's events as \"''They'' wouldn't play with us.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Olivia Bonamy]] as Cl\u00e9mentine\n* [[Micha\u00ebl Cohen]] as Lucas\n* Adriana Mocca as Ilona\n* Maria Roman as Sanda\n* Camelia Maxim as Maria\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\nThe film has been advertised as being \"based on real events\". The \"true story\" on which the film is supposedly based is that of an Austrian couple who were murdered by three teenagers while vacationing in the Czech Republic, but no concrete evidence has emerged to prove this tale.\n\nThe film was shot in 30 days. According to Moreau, Olivia Bonamy had suffered from claustrophobia, and so during the scene where her character Cl\u00e9mentine crawls through the narrow tunnels, much of her performance was her genuine fear of being in the tight spaces.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 62% based on {{nowrap|52 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Suspenseful and tense from start to finish, the French horror film ''Them'' proves that a lack of gore doesn't mean a dearth of scares.\"<ref name=\"rottomatoes\">{{cite web |title=Them (2007) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/them_2007 |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Flixer |accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films featuring home invasions]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0465203|title=Them}}\n*{{Amg movie|355175|Them}}\n*''[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/them2007 Them]'' at [[Metacritic]]\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|ils}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Them (2006 Film)}}\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about couples]]\n[[Category:Films about murderers]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Bucharest]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Romania]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:Home invasions in film]]\n[[Category:Romanian horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s Romanian-language films]]\n[[Category:2006 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by David Moreau]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
