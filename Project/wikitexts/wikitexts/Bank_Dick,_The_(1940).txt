He tries to hit Elsie Mae with a concrete urn but is interrupted when his older daughter Myrtle wants to introduce him to her fianc\u00e9 Og Oggilby.\n\nWhen A. Pismo Clam, the director of a film that is shooting in town, goes on a bender, producer Mackley Q. Greene offers the job to Sous\u00e9. While on his lunch break, he catches a man who has robbed the bank where Og works. The grateful bank president offers Sous\u00e9 a job as the bank's \"special officer,\" a bank detective (\"dick\").\n\nAfter being conned by swindler J. Frothingham Waterbury, Sous\u00e9 convinces Og to steal $500 from the bank to invest in a questionable  mining company. Og hopes to return the money to the bank four days later when he expects to receive his annual bonus, but bank examiner J. Pinkerton Snoopington arrives to immediately audit the bank. Sous\u00e9 invites him to the Black Pussy Cat Caf\u00e9, a saloon run by Joe Guelpe, and drugs him with knockout drops and has him examined by the quack Dr. Stall. Despite this, Snoopington is determined to do his duty and proceed with the audit. Og faints when he sees the examiner in the bank, and Sous\u00e9 tries to delay the audit further by depriving Snoopington of his glasses.\n\nAs Snoopington is about to discover the missing funds, the swindler shows up to buy back the stocks from Og at a discount, but Sous\u00e9 learns that the mine has struck it rich, and he and Og are now wealthy and no longer must worry about the audit. However, the escaped bank robber Repulsive Brogan returns to rob the bank a second time, and escapes with the bank's money and Og's mining-company stock, taking Sous\u00e9 hostage. The robber forces him to drive the getaway car, and the police, the bank director, Og and the movie producer chase them, with parts of the getaway car continuously breaking loose. Sous\u00e9 once again receives the credit for catching the thief and receives $5,000 for the capture of Brogan, $10,000 from the film producer for his screen story and a contract to direct a film based on it.\n\nNow that he is rich, Sous\u00e9 lives in a mansion and his family is elegant and well-spoken and treats him with respect, but he still follows Joe Guelpe on his way to open the Black Pussy Cat Caf\u00e9.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[W.C.
