It also features cameos from [[RuPaul]], [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Barbara Eden]], [[David Spade]], and [[Richard Belzer]]. [[Sequel]] to ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' (1995), it followed its predecessor by placing the 1970s Brady Bunch family in a contemporary 1990s setting, where much of the humor is derived from the resulting culture clash and the utter lack of awareness they show toward their relatively unusual lifestyle.\n\n''A Very Brady Sequel'' was released on August 23, 1996. The film received mixed reviews and earned less than half of what ''The Brady Bunch Movie'' did at the [[box office]]. A second sequel, the made-for-television feature ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]]'', aired in November 2002.\n\n== Plot ==\nOne seemingly typical evening, at the Brady house, a man claiming to be Carol's long-lost first husband, Roy Martin, shows up at the suburban Brady residence. The Bradys believe his story about suffering from amnesia and having plastic surgery after being injured. Mike has been planning a second wedding/renewal of vows for himself and Carol, for an anniversary present without her knowing, although Roy's arrival throws a monkey wrench into things. Throughout Roy's stay, he is openly hostile to them, his sarcasm and insults completely going over their heads.\n\nPeter, who is trying to decide what career path to choose, starts idolizing and emulating Roy, which frequently gets him in trouble at the architect firm where Mike works. Peter later mentions Roy talking about \"the big house\", and Mike learns it means prison, making him suspicious.\n\nGreg and Marcia both want to move out of their shared rooms and when neither wants to back down, they have to share the attic together. When Roy's arrival suggests that Carol and Mike might not be married, Greg and Marcia believe that they are technically not related. This leads them to realize they are in love with each other, but try to hide it from one another throughout their time together.\n\nBobby and Cindy start a \"Detective Agency\" hunting down her missing doll and upon finding it, they stumble upon a photo revealing Roy's true intentions. He is actually a con man named Trevor Thomas and is there to steal a familiar horse statue that is actually a $20 million dollar ancient artifact.\n\nThe kids reveal to Carol his plans, and confront Trevor, who, in turn, kidnaps Carol and takes her hostage to Hawaii, where he plans to sell the artifact to Dr. Whitehead, a buyer in [[Hawaii]]. He also ties up the kids and Alice to keep them from intervening. Mike, who's now fully aware of Trevor's deception, having gone to the police with his suspicions, frees them, and the family flies to Hawaii to save Carol and foil Trevor's plans.\n\nIn Hawaii, Carol escapes from Trevor's clutches, and manages to find her way to Dr. Whitehead's estate before Trevor gets there. It turns out, Trevor was responsible for the [[Gilligan's Island|boating accident that led to the disappearance]] of Dr. Whitehead's son [[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]] and Carol's first husband, [[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|a professor]]. In Dr. Whitehead's words, \"The Minnow is lost\", and he refuses to pay Trevor for the horse. Trevor attempts to hold Dr. Whitehead and Carol at gunpoint for payment, but Mike and the family arrive just in time to intervene, and, after a brief scuffle between the two men, in which Mike quickly gains the upper hand, Trevor is arrested and taken to jail.\n\nDr. Whitehead offers to pay the Bradys the $20 million dollars for the horse, but Mike declines the offer, claiming it's a symbol of their togetherness. Cindy gives him her doll, to console him, as she's outgrown it, after almost losing her mother. Jan, who made up a pretend boyfriend named George Glass in order to make herself seem more popular, meets a real boy named George Glass during the family's trip to Hawaii, and they become a couple.\n\nAs Mike and Carol renew their vows in a ceremony held at their home, Marcia agrees to let Greg have the attic to himself, until he goes to college, and the two share one last on-screen kiss, before returning to being brother and sister. The movie ends with Carol tossing the bouquet, and a genie named [[I Dream of Jeannie|Jeannie]] arriving just in time to catch it. She then claims to be Mike Brady's first wife, much to Mike and Carol's dismay.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Gary Cole]] as [[Mike Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Mike Brady]]\n* [[Shelley Long]] as [[Carol Brady]]\n* [[Henriette Mantel]] as [[Alice Nelson]]\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[Greg Brady (Brady Bunch)|Greg Brady]]\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as [[Marcia Brady]]\n* Paul Sutera as [[Peter Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Peter Brady]]\n* [[Jennifer Elise Cox]] as [[Jan Brady]]\n* [[Jesse Lee Soffer|Jesse Lee]] as [[Bobby Brady]]\n* [[Olivia Hack]] as [[Cindy Brady]]\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Roy Martin/Trevor Thomas\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Dr. Whitehead\n* [[Brian Van Holt]] as Warren Mulaney\n\nThe film featured [[cameo appearance]]s from [[RuPaul]] (reprising his role as Mrs. Cummings from the first film), [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]] (in her last screen role), [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Barbara Eden]] (reprising her role as Jeannie from ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''), [[David Spade]], and [[Richard Belzer]].\n\n== Release ==\n===Box office===\n''A Very Brady Sequel'' was released in theaters on August 23, 1996.

He elaborated that it addressed his chief criticism of the original by showing more of the contemporary world the Bradys live in and finding humor in the contrast between their innocence and the dangers of the world around them. He gave it two and a half stars.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=Reviews: A Very Brady Sequel |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-very-brady-sequel-1996 |website=Roger Ebert.com |access-date=31 July 2019 |date=August 23, 1996}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' instead found it not as fresh as the original, opining that while the subplots with the Brady children are bold and funny, the main plot failed to exploit its comedic possibilities. He still found it overall enjoyable enough to satisfy those who liked the first film, and commented that \"As a satire of a sitcom that wasn't funny, it's often at its funniest when it's purposely stale.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |title=Another '70s Freak Show from those Wacky 'Bradys' |url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Another-70s-Freak-Show-From-Those-Wacky-Bradys-2969527.php |website=[[SFGate]] |access-date=31 July 2019 |date=August 23, 1996}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0118073}}\n* {{tcmdb title|444155|A Very Brady Sequel}}\n* {{Amg movie|136478}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|very_brady_sequel}}\n* {{Mojo title|verybradysequel}}\n\n{{The Brady Bunch}}\n{{Arlene Sanford}}\n{{Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Very Brady Sequel}}\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films with live action and animation]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Films about hostage takings]]\n[[Category:Films about identity theft]]\n[[Category:Films about kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Films about theft]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Arlene Sanford]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Honolulu]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:The Brady Bunch films]]\n[[Category:The Ladd Company films]]\n[[Category:1996 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
