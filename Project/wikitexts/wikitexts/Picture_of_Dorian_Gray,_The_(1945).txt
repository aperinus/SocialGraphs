Released in June 1945 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], the film is directed by [[Albert Lewin]], and stars [[George Sanders]] as Lord Henry Wotton and [[Hurd Hatfield]] as Dorian Gray. Shot primarily in [[black-and-white]], the film features four colour inserts in three-strip [[Technicolor]] of Dorian's portrait; these are a special effect, the first two inserts picturing a youthful Dorian and the second two a degenerate one.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile posing for a painting by his friend Basil Hallward, handsome young aristocrat Dorian Gray meets Hallward's friend Lord Henry Wotton. Wotton persuades Gray the only worthwhile life is dedicated to pleasure, because \"what the gods give they quickly take away.\" Contemplating this, Gray wishes his portrait could age instead of him. He makes this wish in the presence of an [[Ancient Egyptian art|Egyptian cat statue]] with supposed magical powers.\n\n[[File:Hurd Hatfield in The Picture of Dorian Gray trailer.jpg|left|thumb]]\nAfter callously breaking off his engagement to [[tavern]] singer Sibyl Vane, Gray finds the portrait has begun to change and wonders if his wish may have come true. He has the portrait locked away in his old schoolroom and disguises its location by firing servants who moved the painting, while Gray becomes more dedicated to a sinful and heartless life.[[File:Angela Lansbury in The Picture of Dorian Gray trailer.jpg|thumb]]\n[[File:Peter Lawford in The Picture of Dorian Gray trailer.jpg|thumb]]\nYears later, Dorian is 40 but still looks 22. London society is awestruck at his unchanging appearance. The portrait has remained locked away, with Gray holding the only key. Over the years, the portrait of the young, handsome, Dorian Gray has warped into a hideous, demon-like creature reflecting his many sins. When Hallward sees his painting, Gray murders his friend and seals his body in the school room next to the portrait, then blackmails his friend, Allen Campbell, to dispose of Hallward's body. Campbell, distraught at his role in destroying Hallward's corpse, commits suicide.\n\nGray starts a romance with Hallward's niece, Gladys. James Vane, Sibyl's brother, follows Gray to his country estate to achieve revenge for Sibyl's death and is shot by accident during a hunting party.\n\nGray despairs at his impact on others and realises he can spare Gladys from misfortune by leaving her. After sending Gladys a letter breaking their engagement, Gray confronts his portrait and sees a subtle improvement. He stabs the portrait in the heart, seeking to end the spell, but cries out as if he has also been stabbed. His friends, realizing what has happened, burst into the schoolroom to discover Gray dead next to the portrait, his deformed body now reflecting his sins in physical form. The portrait, by contrast, once more shows Dorian Gray as a young, innocent man.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[George Sanders]] as Lord Henry Wotton\n* [[Hurd Hatfield]] as [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]]\n* [[Donna Reed]] as Gladys Hallward\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Sibyl Vane\n* [[Peter Lawford]] as David Stone\n* [[Lowell Gilmore]] as Basil Hallward\n* [[Richard Fraser (actor)|Richard Fraser]] as James Vane\n* [[Douglas Walton (actor)|Douglas Walton]] as Allen Campbell\n* [[Morton Lowry]] as Adrian Singleton\n* [[Miles Mander]] as Sir Robert Bentley\n* [[Lydia Bilbrook]] as Mrs. Vane\n* [[Mary Forbes]] as Lady Agatha\n* [[Robert Greig]] as Sir Thomas\n* [[Moyna Macgill]] as Duchess\n* [[Anita Sharp-Bolster]] as Lady Harborough\n* [[Billy Bevan]] as Malvolio Jones \n* [[Lilian Bond]] as Kate\n'''Uncredited Cast'''\n* [[Cedric Hardwicke]] as Narrator\n* [[Mitchell Lewis (actor)|Mitchell Lewis]] as Waiter\n* [[Reginald Owen]] as Lord George Farmour\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=October 2022}}\n\n=== Differences between movie and book===\nChanges to the original include the romance between Gladys and David and \u201csome censorship restrictions that kept Dorian's unspeakable acts offscreen.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web |title=The Picture of Dorian Gray |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2821/the-picture-of-dorian-gray |access-date=2022-10-04 |website=www.tcm.com |language=en}}</ref> In the book, the picture alters in response to Dorian's \"good deed\", but the alteration is ugly, reflecting his cynicism and self-serving motivation. He stabs the painting to destroy his conscience and eliminate the evidence. In the film, he reads a faint change in the painting as a sign of hope, yet stabs the painting as if he can undo his past.
