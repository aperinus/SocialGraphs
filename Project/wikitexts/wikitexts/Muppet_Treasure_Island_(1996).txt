It is the fifth theatrical film in [[The Muppets (franchise)|''The Muppets'' franchise]].\n\nAdapted from the 1883 novel ''[[Treasure Island]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], similarly to its predecessor ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992), the key roles were played by live-action actors, with the Muppets in supporting roles. In addition to the Muppet performers in various roles, the film stars [[Tim Curry]] and introduces [[Kevin Bishop]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States on February 16, 1996, by [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]]. It grossed $34 million on a budget of $31 million, and received generally positive reviews from critics. It is the second Muppets film to be produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], whose [[The Walt Disney Company|parent company]] would later acquire the Muppets franchise in 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 and 700 words. -->\n[[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] is a young orphan who lives in an inn in England with his best friends [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] and [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]]. Jim listens to [[Billy Bones]]' tales about the pirate [[Captain Flint]], who buried his treasure trove on a remote island and executed his crew so only he would own the island's map. One night, Bones' crewmate Blind Pew arrives, giving Bones the [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black spot]]. Just before dying of a heart attack, Bones gives Jim the [[treasure map]] and begs him to go after the treasure and keep it safe from pirate hands, especially a one-legged man. Just then, an army of pirates attack the inn, destroying it, but Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo escape with the map.\n\nThe trio takes the map to the half-wit [[Squire Trelawney]] ([[Fozzie Bear]]), who arranges a voyage to find the treasure. The boys are enlisted aboard the ''Hispaniola'' as cabin boys, accompanied by Trelawney, [[Dr. Livesey (character)|Dr. Livesey]] ([[Bunsen Honeydew]]), and [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]. The ship is commanded by [[Captain Alexander Smollett|Captain Abraham Smollett]] ([[Kermit the Frog]]) and his overly strict first mate, Mr. Arrow ([[Sam Eagle]]). The boys meet the cook [[Long John Silver]], the one-legged man whom Bones warned them of, but Jim and Silver become good friends. The ship sets sail, but Smollett is suspicious of the crew, believing them to be of shady character. After Gonzo and Rizzo are kidnapped and tortured by three of the crew who have turned out to be pirates, he has the treasure map locked up for safe keeping.\n\nIt is revealed that Silver and the secret pirates in the crew had been part of Flint's crew and want the treasure for themselves. Silver fools Mr. Arrow into leaving the ship to test out a rowboat, says he drowned, and has his minions steal the map during Arrow's memorial service. Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo discover Silver's treachery and inform Smollett. Arriving at Treasure Island, Smollett orders the entire crew save the officers to go ashore, planning to keep himself and non-pirate crew aboard the ship and abandon the pirates on the island. However, his plan falls through when it is discovered that Silver has kidnapped Jim to have leverage against the captain. On the island, Silver invites Jim to join them in the treasure hunt using his late father's compass. When Jim refuses, Silver forcibly takes the compass from him. Smollett, Gonzo, and Rizzo land on the island in an effort to rescue Jim. However, unbeknownst to them, Silver had hidden a squad of pirates aboard the ''Hispaniola'' before leaving, and they capture the ship in Smollett's absence. On the island, Smollett and the rest of the landing party are captured by the native tribe of pigs, where Smollett reunites with his jilted lover [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Benjamina Gunn]] ([[Miss Piggy]]), the tribe's queen.\n\nThe pirates find that the cave in which Flint hid the treasure is empty, leading to a brief [[mutiny]] against Silver. Silver reveals that, even though he is a pirate, he cares for Jim and allows him to escape. After reprimanding the crew from using a page from the Bible to deliver a death sentence, Silver and his crew capture Smollett and Benjamina. Smollett is hung from a cliff to fall to his death, joined soon by Benjamina after she reveals where the treasure is hidden to save his life. Jim rescues his friends and with an alive Mr. Arrow, who portrays his own ghost to scare the pirates aboard the ship, the group regains control of the ''Hispaniola'' and rescues Smollett and Benjamina.\n\nThe group engages the remaining pirates in a sword fight on the beach with Sweetums defecting to Smollett's side until only Silver is left standing, but he surrenders when he finds himself outnumbered. While the pirates are imprisoned, Silver discovers he still has Mr. Arrow's keys and tries to escape with the treasure during the night. Jim confronts him and threatens to give his position away, while Silver draws his pistol. In a tearful standoff, neither can bring themselves to follow their threats and Jim allows Silver to leave as long as they never cross paths again, much to their disappointment. Silver rows away, but not before returning Jim's compass to him and complimenting his kind heart. However, Mr. Arrow informs Jim and Smollett that the boat Silver used was not seaworthy, and Silver is later stranded on Treasure Island.\n\nThe crew of the ''Hispaniola'' sails away into the sunset, but not before some scuba-diving rat tourists recover the treasure from the sea.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kevin Bishop]] as [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]], a friendly orphan boy who, for most of his life, has worked at the Admiral Benbow Inn under the strict rule of Mrs. Bluveridge, but has always dreamed of daring adventures. He is very [[Naivety|na\u00efve]], which proves to be somewhat of a problem for him, as he forms a friendship with Long John Silver, who is ultimately revealed to be a pirate.\n* [[Tim Curry]] as [[Long John Silver]], a duplicitous but smooth-talking pirate, posing as a chef, who mentors Jim until he is overheard by Gonzo, Rizzo and Jim as he reveals his plans to take over the ''Hispaniola''. During his siege on Treasure Island, it is suggested that Silver and Benjamina Gunn share a romantic history. Despite his evil nature, he cares about Jim.\n* [[Billy Connolly]] as [[Billy Bones]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-11-14-9611140365-story.html|title=Treasure Island' Gets Muppetized|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=November 14, 1996|access-date=August 2, 2012|archive-date=January 30, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130055515/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-11-14-9611140365-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> an ex-pirate, previously a member of Captain Flint's crew who witnessed the burial of gold on Treasure Island and informs Jim that he still has the map to the treasure before he suffers a fatal [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].\n* [[Jennifer Saunders]] as Mrs. Sarah Bluveridge, an intimidating, feisty woman who owns the Admiral Benbow Inn where Jim and his friends work.
