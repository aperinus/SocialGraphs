Initially, no sequel was planned, but it was produced after the unexpected financial success of the [[Beethoven (film)|first film]]. It is the last entry in the franchise to be released theatrically, as well as to feature the original cast.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nIn the Newton family home, George, Alice, Ryce, Ted, Emily, and Beethoven are all well adjusted to living together. Beethoven sneaks out and meets a female St. Bernard named Missy and her owner, Brillo. His soon-to-be ex-wife, Regina, arrives with her boyfriend, Floyd, takes Missy, and is seeking $50,000 in the settlement as [[alimony]]. She has retained full custody of Missy and only plans to transfer her to Brillo once the [[divorce]] is finalized.\n\nWith Beethoven's help, Missy escapes from Regina's [[condominium]], and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Ryce develops strong feelings for her classmate, Taylor Devereaux, after he kisses her. Ted and Emily become aware of Beethoven constantly sneaking out of the house and follow him, where they discover he and Missy had four puppies in the basement of the building. The janitor also finds them and informs Regina. She reclaims Missy and plans to get rid of the puppies, even if it means killing them, but the janitor talks her out of it by pointing out that [[purebred (dog)|purebred]] puppies are worth a lot of money and suggests that she could sell them at a [[pet store]] and make a fortune.\n\nThinking Regina plans to drown the puppies, Ted and Emily sneak them out of the building and take them home. They keep them in their basement so George will not see them. Realizing they took them, Regina plans revenge. Ryce, Ted, and Emily take it upon themselves to feed and care for them. Eventually, George discovers them and reluctantly agrees to keep them until they are mature.\n\nThe Newtons are offered a free stay in a [[Summer house|lakefront house]] in the mountains owned by one of George's business associates. There, Taylor invites Ryce to a party with friends where she is exposed to [[Underage drinking|teenage drinking]] and [[sexual harassment]]. Beethoven destroys the house's patio deck, removing her from potential danger. Regina and Floyd are staying in a location unknown to Brillo, coincidentally near the Newtons' vacation house. The Newtons go to a county fair with the dogs, and Ryce, Ted, and Emily persuade George to enter a [[Eating competition|burger eating contest]] with Beethoven, which they win. Regina and Floyd are also at the fair, but leave Missy in their car.\n\nMissy escapes from the car with Beethoven's help while Regina snatches the puppies' leashes from Ted. Beethoven and Missy run into the mountains, followed by Regina and Floyd. The Newtons follow and catch up. After a confrontation between George and Floyd, the latter threatens to drop the puppies in the river below and pokes George in the stomach with a large stick. Beethoven charges into the stick and rams it into Floyd's [[groin]], causing him to lose his balance and fall over the cliff, pulling Regina down with him. They land in a pool of mud and are swept away by the river.\n\nFive months later, Brillo visits the Newtons with Missy, revealing that the judge in the divorce had granted him full custody of her and denied Regina's claim. The puppies, now adults, run downstairs to see her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as George Newton\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Alice Newton\n* [[Nicholle Tom]] as Ryce Newton\n* [[Christopher Castile]] as Ted Newton\n* [[Sarah Rose Karr]] as Emily Newton\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Regina\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Floyd\n* [[Ashley Hamilton]] as Taylor Devereaux\n* [[Danny Masterson]] as Seth\n*[[Catherine Reitman]] as Janie\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Cliff Klamath\n* [[Heather McComb]] as Michelle\n* [[Scott Waara]] as Banker\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Gus\n* [[Virginia Capers]] as Linda Anderson\n* Jordan Bond as Jordan\n* Pat Jankiewicz as Arthur Lewis\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Brillo (additional cast)\n\nThe film was [[Danny Masterson]]'s screen debut.<ref name=AFI>{{cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/59461 |title=Beethoven's 2nd (1993) |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=May 22, 2018 }}</ref> His younger brother, [[Christopher Masterson|Christopher]], also had a small role, but when the producers noticed the resemblance, they removed him.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brooke |last=Carter |url=https://gazettereview.com/2016/08/christopher-masterson-news-what-happened-updates/ |title=What Happened to Christopher Masterson?
