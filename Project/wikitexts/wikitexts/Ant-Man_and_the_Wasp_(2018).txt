Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is the sequel to ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015) and the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|20th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is directed by [[Peyton Reed]] and written by the writing teams of [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and [[Erik Sommers]], and [[Paul Rudd]], Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari. It stars Rudd as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Lang]] and [[Evangeline Lilly]] as [[Hope van Dyne]], alongside [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Walton Goggins]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Judy Greer]], [[Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]], [[David Dastmalchian]], [[Hannah John-Kamen]], [[Abby Ryder Fortson]], [[Randall Park]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], and [[Michael Douglas]]. In ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', the titular pair work with [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] (Douglas) to retrieve [[Janet van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Janet van Dyne]] (Pfeiffer) from the [[Quantum Realm]].\n\nTalks for a sequel to ''Ant-Man'' began shortly after that film was released. ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was officially announced in October 2015, with Rudd and Lilly returning to reprise their roles. A month later, ''Ant-Man'' director Reed was officially set to return. He had joined the first film later in the process and was excited to develop this one from the beginning. He also looked forward to introducing Hope van Dyne as the Wasp in this film, and insisted on treating Lang and her as equals. Filming took place from August to November 2017, at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]], as well as [[Metro Atlanta]]; [[San Francisco]]; [[Savannah, Georgia]]; and Hawaii.\n\n''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' had its world premiere in Hollywood on June 25, 2018, and was released in the United States on July 6, 2018, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. The film was a critical and commercial success, receiving praise for its performances (particularly those of Rudd and Lilly), humor, and levity, and grossing over $622 million worldwide. A sequel, ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania]]'', is scheduled for release in February 2023.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nTwo years after [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] was placed under [[house arrest]] due to his involvement with the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]], in violation of the [[Sokovia Accords]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).}} [[Hank Pym (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hank Pym]] and his daughter [[Hope van Dyne]] briefly manage to open a tunnel to the [[Quantum Realm]]. They believe Pym's wife [[Janet van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Janet van Dyne]] might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become [[Quantum entanglement|quantumly entangled]] with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.\n\nWith only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet, despite the strained relationship they have because of Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a large ant with Lang's ankle-monitor on as a decoy so as not to arouse the suspicions of FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jimmy Woo]]. Believing the message from Janet is confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black-market dealer [[Sonny Burch (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sonny Burch]], but Burch realizes the potential profit to be made from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"[[Ghost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|ghost]]\", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase.\n\nPym reluctantly takes Hope and Lang to visit his estranged former partner [[Bill Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bill Foster]], who gives them a way to locate the lab. After they find it, the ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father, [[Elihas Starr|Elihas]], was another of Pym's former partners who died along with his wife during an experiment that caused her unstable state. Foster enters and reveals that Ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition. They plan to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope, Lang, and the lab.\n\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel, Pym, Hope, and Lang are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Using a truth serum, Burch learns the trio's location from Lang's business partners [[Luis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Luis]], [[Dave (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dave]], and [[Kurt (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kurt]], and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see that he is violating his house arrest. Pym and Hope are arrested by the FBI, allowing Ava to take the lab.\n\nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, whom he finds alive. Meanwhile, Lang and Hope are confronted by Burch and his men, and following a lengthy chase, Ava regains control of the lab, allowing her to begin taking Janet's energy by force. Luis, Dave, and Kurt incapacitate Burch and his men so that Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym and Janet return safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gives some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.\n\nLang returns home once again, in time for a now-suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. Ava and Foster go into hiding. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to help Ava remain stable. While Lang is in the quantum realm doing this, the other three turn to dust.{{refn|name=InfinityWar|group=N|Due to [[the Blip]] which began at the end of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"MidCredits\"/><ref name=\"Time Infinity\"/>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang / Ant-Man]]:<br/>A former petty criminal who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.<ref name=\"ReedDouglas\"/> Following the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), in which Lang escapes from the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Raft|Raft prison]], director [[Peyton Reed]] said that \"he's a fugitive in most of the first ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015) movie.

He hoped to incorporate additional flashback sequences in the film, as well as explore Pym's various identities from the comics and his psychology. Reed also said he was \"excited\" about exploring and discovering the film version of the Ant-Man and Wasp relationship that is \"a romantic partnership and a heroic partnership\" in the comics, a \"different dynamic than we've seen in the rest of the [MCU], an actual partnership.\" Additionally, Reed mentioned that pre-production would \"probably\" start in October 2016, with filming scheduled for early 2017.<ref name=\"ReedCBRDec2015\"/> Production writers for the first film, Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer, signed on to write the script along with Rudd,<ref name=\"Writers\"/> with writing starting \"in earnest\" in January 2016.<ref name=\"ReedCBRDec2015\"/> The next month, McKay stated that he would be involved with the film in some capacity.<ref name=\"McKayFeb2016\"/> By April, the four writers and Reed had been \"holed up in a room ... brainstorming the story\", with Reed promising that it would have \"stuff in it that you've never ever seen in a movie before\".<ref name=\"ReedApr2016\"/> Feige added that they wanted to \"stay true to what made [''Ant-Man''] so unique and different\", and teased the potential of seeing the [[Giant-Man]] version of Lang that had been introduced in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\"/> Despite being \"intimately involved in the writing and the development of the script\", Reed did not take or receive a writing credit on the film.<ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\"/>\n\nIn June 2016, Reed said that for inspiration from the comics he had been looking at \"early ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' stuff and all the way up to the [[Nick Spencer]] stuff now\", and was focusing on iconic images that could be replicated in the film over story beats from the comics. He added that there was \"definitely a chance\" for [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]], and Dastmalchian to reprise their respective roles as [[Luis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Luis]], [[Dave (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dave]], and [[Kurt (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kurt]] from the first film.<ref name=\"ReedJun2016\"/> At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2016, Feige stated that Reed and Rudd were still working on the script,<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\"/> and that filming was now expected to begin in June 2017.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\"/><ref name=\"JuneStart\"/> Rudd elaborated that they had \"turned in a treatment, but it's so preliminary.

However, the writers chose to remove the appearance in the final script since the events of ''Civil War'' were already referenced frequently in the film, and this instance \"didn\u2019t feel organic to the story.\"<ref name=\"CapCameo\"/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nAt the start of November 2016, Reed said that the film's production would transition from \"the writing phase\" to \"official prep\" that month, beginning with visual development. Reed reiterated his excitement for introducing the Wasp and \"really designing her look, the way she moves, the power set, and figuring out, sort of, who Hope van Dyne is as a hero\".<ref name=\"PreProduction\"/> Reed was inspired by the films ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988), and ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972) for the look and feel of ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''.<ref name=\"What'sUpDoc\"/> While the first film was more of a heist film, Reed described this as part action film, part romantic comedy, and was inspired by the works of [[Elmore Leonard]] where there are \"villains, but we also have antagonists, and we have these roadblocks to our heroes getting to where they need to be\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit22Things\"/> He also stated his disappointment in the Giant-Man introduction happening in ''Civil War'', rather than an Ant-Man film,<ref name=\"PreProduction\"/> but noted that the appearance provided character development opportunities between Lang, Pym, and Van Dyne since Pym is \"very clear in the first movie about how he feels about [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark]] and how he feels about the Avengers and being very protective of this technology that he has\",<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit22Things\"/> and so Reed thought Pym would be \"pissed\" and Van Dyne would feel betrayed, which was Reed's \"in\" for those characters' starting dynamics.<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\"/> Reed added that he spends \"a lot of time\" talking with the other writers and directors of MCU films, and that he and the writers on this film wished to maintain \"our little Ant-Man corner of the universe. Because it's a whole different vibe tonally\".<ref name=\"PreProduction\"/> Quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis from the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]] returned to consult on the film, after doing the same on ''Ant-Man'', and explained the science behind getting extremely small to the filmmakers. Michalakis described the subatomic realm as \"a place of infinite possibility, an alternative universe where the laws of physics and forces of nature as we know them haven\u2019t crystallized\" and suggested it should be represented in the film by \"beautiful colors changing constantly to reflect transience.\"<ref name=\"ScienceConsultants\"/>\n\nIn February 2017, Douglas confirmed that he would reprise his role as Hank Pym in the film.<ref name=\"DouglasConfirmed\"/> During the Hollywood premiere of ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' in April, Dastmalchian confirmed his return as Kurt,<ref name=\"Dastmalchian\"/> and a month later, Harris confirmed his return as Dave as well.<ref name=\"Harris\"/> Through that May, Marvel was meeting with several actresses for a \"key role\" in the sequel, with [[Hannah John-Kamen]] cast in the part at the beginning of June.<ref name=\"John-Kamen\"/> The following month, [[Randall Park]] joined the cast as [[Jimmy Woo (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jimmy Woo]],<ref name=\"Park\"/> and [[Walton Goggins]] was cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Goggins\"/> At San Diego Comic-Con 2017, Park's casting was confirmed; John-Kamen and Goggins' roles were revealed to be [[Ghost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ghost]] and [[Sonny Burch (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sonny Burch]], respectively; and the casting of Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne and [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Bill Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bill Foster]] was announced.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\"/> [[Judy Greer]] was confirmed to be reprising her role as Maggie from the previous film the following week.<ref name=\"Greer\"/> Louise Frogley served as costume designer on the film after doing so for Marvel's ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), and worked with Ivo Coveney to create the superhero suits for the film. Based on designs by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], the suits are updated for the film from the 1960s-inspired designs used in the first ''Ant-Man'' to more modern designs. The Wasp suit included practical wings which were replaced with digital wings for when they are expanded and ready for flight.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nThe [[Russo brothers]], directors of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', which were filming while ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was preparing to film, were in constant discussion with Reed in order to ensure story elements would line up between the films. Joe Russo added that ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' would have \"some [plot] elements that stitch in\" closely with ''Avengers: Infinity War'', more so than some of the other films leading up to the Avengers films.<ref name=\"RussosIW\"/> Reed knew ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' would be \"a fairly stand-alone movie but... could not ignore the events of ''Infinity War''\", with the biggest connection occurring in the film's [[mid-credit scene]]. Since the events of ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' occur over 48 hours, the timeline in relation to ''Infinity War'' was \"left purposefully ambiguous\" with Reed noting there had been discussions of placing \"little Easter eggs along the way, to start to reveal to the audience where the movie takes place in the timeline, [but t]hat felt not very fun to us and kind of obvious.\" Reed also liked how the film ends with closure and on a positive note \"and then to BANG \u2014 give the audience a gut punch right after the main credits\",<ref name=\"ReedPostCreditPolygon\"/> with the sequence showing Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, and Hope van Dyne disintegrating due to [[the Blip]] featured at the end of ''Avengers: Infinity War''. The film also has a post-credit scene that shows the ant who doubled for Lang while under house arrest performing a drum solo.<ref name=\"MidCredits\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Lombard Street San Francisco 2004.jpg|thumb|Additional filming took place in San Francisco, the setting of the film, including for an action sequence on [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] (pictured).]]\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 1, 2017,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\"/> at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\"/><ref name=\"Pinewood\"/> under the [[working title]] ''Cherry Blue'';<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\"/> [[Dante Spinotti]] served as director of photography,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\"/> shooting on [[Arri Alexa#Alexa 65|Arri Alexa 65]] cameras, with some sequences being shot with a [[Frazier lens]].<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/> At the start of filming, Marvel revealed that [[Bobby Cannavale]] and [[Abby Ryder Fortson]] would also reprise their roles from the first film, respectively as Paxton and [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]], and that [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and Erik Sommers had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\"/>\n\nThe film's lab and quantum tunnel set was inspired by ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' (1966\u201367), and was the largest physical set built for an MCU film, which Reed jokingly said was \"a little counter-intuitive\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\"/> For the sequence where Janet van Dyne communicates through Lang, inspiration was taken from ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'' (1984) in which [[Lily Tomlin]]'s character is trapped in the body of [[Steve Martin]]'s character. There were discussions about having Pfeiffer perform the scene first to give Rudd an idea of how she would act, but the group ultimately decided to let Rudd invent the scene completely himself.<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\"/><ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\"/> For the chamber in Ghost's lair, the production team under production designer Shepherd Frankel wanted to create an environment that was unique to the MCU, and designed the chamber with [[fresnel lens]]es to give it concentric-circle patterns that served a practical purpose for the film's story as well as differentiating the aesthetics of it from other sets and creating mystery about the character. The chamber is surrounded by \"support shapes\" to \"create this feeling of desperation and yearning for family and stability\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nFilming also took place in [[Metro Atlanta]], with filming locations including the [[Atlanta International School]], the [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]] and [[Buckhead]] districts of Atlanta, and the [[Samuel M. Inman]] Middle School in the city's [[Virginia-Highland]] neighborhood; as well as [[Emory University]] and the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] in [[Hampton, Georgia]].<ref name=\"MetroAtlantaFilming\"/> Additional filming took place in [[San Francisco]] in September 2017,<ref name=\"SanFranFilming\"/> in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in late October,<ref name=\"SavannahFilming\"/> and in Hawaii.<ref name=\"HawaiiFilming\"/> Production [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on November 19, 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\"/>\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn late November, Lilly said that the characters would try to enter the [[Quantum Realm]] in the film, and their potential success would \"open a whole entire new [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multi-verse]] to enter into and play around in\" for the MCU.<ref name=\"VanityFairNov2017\"/> The film includes a clip from ''[[Animal House]]'' (1978), which Reed was reminded of while discussing the quantum realm science for the film. Reed insisted that the film be shorter than two hours since it would be following the \"massive epic\" ''Infinity War'' and because it is \"an action/comedy, and it didn't want to overstay its welcome\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\"/> Dan Lebental and [[Craig Wood (film editor)|Craig Wood]] edited the film.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> The film's main credits sequence is a \"table-top\" version of its action sequences,<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\"/> and was created by Elastic.<ref name=\"Elastic\"/> An alternative idea that had been considered was to create a \"fake behind-the-scenes documentary\" that would have made the film look like it was a 1950s-era [[Godzilla]] movie with \"people in suits stomping on model cityscapes\".<ref name=\"Commentary23Things\"/>\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Michelle Pfeiffer de-aging VFX in Ant-Man and the Wasp.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Michelle Pfeiffer 01.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer    = [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was digitally [[de-aging in film|de-aged]] in ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' (top) to appear as she did circa 1985 (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[DNEG]], [[Scanline VFX]], [[Method Studios]], [[Luma Pictures]], Lola VFX, [[Industrial Light & Magic]],<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/> [[Cinesite]], [[Rise FX]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Crafty Apes]], Perception NYC, [[Digital Domain]], and The Third Floor.<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\"/>\n\nDNEG worked on over 500 shots, including the effects for Ghost\u2014which were shared with the other vendors\u2014the third act chase sequence, and the final Ghost fight as Hank and Janet are returning from the quantum realm. For the \"macro-photography\" sequences in the film, DNEG took a different approach from their work in ''Ant-Man'' due to issues including trying to get a camera to seem small enough to capture the small actions. Though some of the film was shot with a [[Frazier lens]] that provides extra depth of field, DNEG would still need to \"re-project the road higher and \"raise the floor level\" to simulate a tiny sized camera\". As the third act chase sequence was mainly shot in Atlanta, while being set in San Francisco, DNEG VFX Supervisor Alessandro Ongaro noted it required \"extensive environment work\" with background elements in some shots not being salvageable at all.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/> DNEG ultimately created 130 unique environments for the chase. Clear Angle aided DNEG with the [[Lidar]] surveying and photography of San Francisco, and were able to get their information for [[Lombard Street (San Francisco)|Lombard Street]] down to the millimeter resolution.<ref name=\"VFXVoice\"/> DNEG also handled the [[stereo conversion]] on the film to release it in both [[2.39:1]] and 1.90:1 (for IMAX) aspect ratios. The squarer frame of the IMAX ratio was used as the basis for the visual effects, with the 2.39:1 version then being [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] from the finished IMAX version.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\nLola once again worked on the de-aging sequences with Douglas, Pfeiffer, and Fishburne. The flashback sequences featuring a younger Hank Pym were set around the same time as the flashback sequences of ''Ant-Man'', so Lola were able to use a similar process, referencing Douglas' appearance in ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) and having the actor on set in a different wardrobe and wig. Lola VFX Supervisor [[Trent Claus]] felt Pfeiffer's was less complicated, since \"she has aged incredibly well\" and still has big hair and a big smile. Pfeiffer's work from ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985) and other films around that time was referenced. For Fishburne, his son served as his younger double, and helped inform Lola how the older Fishburne's skin would have looked in certain lighting situations. The films Lola looked to for Fishburne's younger self included ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Deep Cover]]'' (1992). Lola also made Fishburne thinner, and all actors had their posture adjusted.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\nLuma worked on the scenes where Ant-Man and the Wasp infiltrate Ghost's hideout, where they had to recreate the entire environment with CGI. They also created the first quantum tunnel sequence where Ghost receives her powers, and the flashback missile launch, which had to be replicated exactly from how it appeared in ''Ant-Man''. The new version of the quantum realm, designed by Reed and production VFX supervisor Stephane Ceretti, was created by Method. Method Studios VFX Supervisor Andrew Hellen, explained, \"We did a lot of research into macro and cellular level photography, and played with different ways to visualize quantum mechanics. It has a very magical quality, with a scientific edge. We also used glitching effects and macro lensing to ground the footage, and keep it from feeling too terrestrial.\" Method also worked on the sequence when Lang is the size of a preschooler, and created the digital doubles for Ant-Man and Wasp; Method used the same level of detail on the digital double suits regardless of what scale they were.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Ant-Man and the Wasp (soundtrack)}}\nIn June 2017, Reed confirmed that [[Christophe Beck]], who composed the score for ''Ant-Man'', would return for ''Ant-Man and the Wasp''.<ref name=\"Beck\"/> Beck reprised his main theme from ''Ant-Man'', and also wrote a new one for Wasp that he wanted to be \"high energy\" and show that she is more certain of her abilities than Lang. When choosing between these themes for specific scenes throughout the film, Beck tried to choose the Wasp theme more often so there would be \"enough newness in the score to feel like it's going new places, and isn\u2019t just some retread.\"<ref name=\"BeckFMM\"/> [[Hollywood Records]] and [[Marvel Music]] released the soundtrack album digitally on July 6, 2018.<ref name=\"FilmMusicReporter\"/>\n\n== Marketing ==\nConcept art and \"pre-CGI video\" for the film was shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con.<ref name=\"SDCCFootage\"/> In January 2018, [[Hyundai Motor America]] announced that the 2019 [[Hyundai Veloster]] would play a significant role in the film, with other Hyundai vehicles also appearing.<ref name=\"Hyundai\"/> The first trailer for the film was released on January 30, 2018, on ''[[Good Morning America]]'',<ref name=\"DeadlineTrailer1\"/> and used the guitar riff from [[Adam and the Ants]]' \"Ants Invasion\".<ref name=\"AntsMusic\"/> David Betancourt of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the release, the day after the widely praised ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' premiere, a \"smart move\"; with ''Black Panther'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' also releasing in 2018, \"it can be easy [to] forget that hey, there {{em|is}} an ''Ant-Man'' sequel coming this year... So Marvel Studios giving us a quick reminder with this trailer release is logical\".<ref name=\"WPTrailer1\"/> Tracy Brown, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', praised how the trailer prominently featured Lilly's Van Dyne showing \"she was always meant to be a superhero\".<ref name=\"LATimesTrailer1\"/>\n\nA second trailer was released on May 1, 2018, following a teaser video featuring the ''Infinity War'' cast asking \"where were Ant-Man and The Wasp?\" in that film.<ref name=\"THRTrailer2\"/><ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\"/> Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt the trailer made the film feel \"very much like an intentional antidote for, or at least alternative to, the grimness of ''Infinity War''{{'}}s downbeat ending\", calling it \"a smart move\" since it could be considered \"a palate cleanser and proof that Marvel has more to offer... before audiences dive back into the core narrative with next year's ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]''.\"<ref name=\"THRTrailer2\"/> In June 2018, Feige presented several scenes from the film at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\"/> [[Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!]], an attraction inspired by the film, opened at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] on March 31, 2019.

Charles Gant of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[Screen International]]'' noted, \"The worry for film distributors is that audiences will be caught up in the tournament. So it's easier to play safe and not date your film at this time, especially during the group stage, when all the qualifying nations are competing.\" Tom Butler of [[Yahoo! Movies]] UK added that, unlike the first film, which was one of the lowest-grossing MCU films in the UK, anticipation levels for the film \"are at an all-time high following the events of ''Infinity War''\" and \"UK audiences will probably have found out what happens in the film well before it opens in UK cinemas, and this could have a negative impact on its box office potential.\"<ref name=\"UKReleaseYahoo\"/> Butler and Huw Fullerton of ''[[Radio Times]]'' both opined the delay could also be in part because of Disney also delaying the United Kingdom release of ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' to July 13, 2018 (a month after its United States release), and not wanting to compete with itself with the two films.<ref name=\"UKReleaseYahoo\"/><ref name=\"UKReleaseRadioTimes\"/> This in turn led fans in the country to start a [[Change.org]] petition to have Disney move the release date up several weeks, similarly to how ''Avengers: Infinity War''{{'}}s United States release was moved up a week the previous May.<ref name=\"UKReleasePetition\"/>\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' was released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on October 2, 2018, and on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on October 16.
