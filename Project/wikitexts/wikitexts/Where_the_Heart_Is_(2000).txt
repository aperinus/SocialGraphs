The screenplay, written by [[Lowell Ganz]] and [[Babaloo Mandel]], is based on the best-selling [[Where the Heart Is (novel)|1995 novel of the same name]] by [[Billie Letts]]. The film follows five years in the life of Novalee Nation, a pregnant 17-year-old, who is abandoned by her boyfriend at a [[Walmart]] in a small [[Oklahoma]] town. She secretly moves into the store, where she eventually gives birth to her baby, which attracts media attention. With the help of friends, she makes a new life for herself in the town.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. 748 in Nov 2022-->\nPregnant, 17 y.o. Novalee Nation and her boyfriend Willy Jack Pickens are moving from [[Tennessee]] to [[California]]. He abandons her at a [[Walmart]] in [[Sequoyah, Oklahoma]], when she enters for the restroom and shoes. There, Thelma \"Sister\" Husband gives her a [[buckeye tree]], and local photographer Moses Whitecotton suggests she give her baby a strong name. \n\nA sickly and homeless Novalee is forced to live in the Walmart undetected. She also becomes acquainted with curt librarian Forney Hull who cares for his alcoholic sister Mary Elizabeth.\n\nDuring a thunderstorm, Novalee is alone at the Walmart and goes into labor. Forney, who had followed her there, smashes through the window to help deliver her child, whom she names Americus. Novalee instantly becomes a media darling, and while in the hospital, is befriended by Nurse Lexie Coop. Her estranged mother, Mama Lil, whom Novalee has not seen in over 12 years, visits after seeing her on television but disappears with 500 dollars in donations. Sister Husband arrives and offers to take in Novalee and Americus.\n\nWhile Christmas tree shopping with Forney, Novalee is reminded that it is Americus' five-month birthday. Realizing this, Novalee races to Sister's to find that Americus has been kidnapped. A couple from [[Midnight, Mississippi]], who had previously written an ugly letter to Novalee saying the illegitimate Americus was an abomination, kidnapped her, leaving her in the church nativity scene.\n\nThree years later, Novalee becomes a photographer with Moses' help. Willy Jack becomes a [[one-hit-wonder]] with a song he wrote in jail, by meeting music agent Ruth Meyers in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. She gives him a makeover and the stage name \"Billy Shadow.\"\n\nA [[tornado]] blows through Sequoyah and Sister Husband is killed. In her memory, Novalee shoots a picture of Americus and the still-standing buckeye tree amidst the damage from the storm. Sister leaves her everything, around $41,000, but she feels Sister's companion Mr. Sprock deserves the estate. He insists he only wants the kitchen table.\n\nNovalee goes to [[Vegas]], to accept an award for the tornado photo, narrowly missing Willy Jack who is also at the hotel, but he does not recognize her. His manager Ruth informs him that he is being sued for the rights to \"Beat of a Heart\" by his old cellmate. Willy Jack explains to her that Tommy had actually beaten him up over it, but she does not believe him and drops him. He begs her not to leave him, but she does anyway.\n\nReturning to Sequoyah, Novalee finds Lexie has been nearly beaten to death by her most recent 'boyfriend', who molested her two eldest, as she protected them. Lexie's injuries keep her from nursing, so she and her children move in with Novalee and Americus. Lexie breaks down, feeling guilty and angry, tearfully regretting her choice in men.\n\nWhen Forney's sister Mary Elizabeth passes away and he does not appear at the funeral, Novalee finds him in a hotel and comforts him. They finally act on their hidden feelings, spending the night together. Forney confesses his love for her, but Novalee feels she is not good enough for him. So, when he says he will stay with her rather than resume his studies at [[Bowdoin College]], Novalee struggles to lie to Forney. She says she does not love him, not wanting to hold him back. Heartbroken, Forney returns to Bowdoin.\n\nLexie is seeing Ernie, an exterminator who is not her usual type, but she falls in love with him when hearing he traded his restored 1967 [[Chevy Camaro]] in exchange for custody of his stepdaughter, whom he adopted as his own. They marry, and she's pregnant again.\n\nSeverely depressed at his ruined career following the lawsuit, Willy Jack becomes an alcoholic. He wanders off drunk, collapses on a railroad track and is hit by a train.\n\nOn Americus' fifth birthday, Novalee sees a newspaper article about Willy Jack having lost his legs four months earlier and recently being robbed of his wheelchair. She visits him in the hospital and he realises his whole life would've been different if he had not abandoned her. Seeing Willy Jack is a changed man, Novalee can finally forgive and let go of him, but warns him to never contact Americus.\n\nAfter driving Willy Jack home to Tennessee upon his hospital release, Novalee drives to Maine to find Forney at Bowdoin. She confesses she really does love him, they return to Oklahoma and marry in the Walmart, where Lexie is seen carrying her newest baby.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Novalee Nation, a pregnant girl who gets stranded in Sequoyah.\n* [[Ashley Judd]] as Lexie Coop, a nurse who lives in Sequoyah.\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Thelma \"Sister\" Husband, a promiscuous religious woman in Sequoyah.
