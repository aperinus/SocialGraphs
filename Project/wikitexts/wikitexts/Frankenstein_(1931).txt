The Webling play was adapted by [[John L. Balderston]] and the screenplay written by [[Francis Edward Faragoh]] and [[Garrett Fort]], with uncredited contributions from [[Robert Florey]] and [[John Russell (screenwriter)|John Russell]].\n\n''Frankenstein'' stars [[Colin Clive]] as [[Henry Frankenstein]], an obsessed scientist who digs up corpses with his assistant in order to assemble a living being from body parts. The resulting creature, often known as [[Frankenstein's monster]], is portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]]. The make-up for the monster was provided by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]]. Alongside Clive and Karloff, the film's cast also includes [[Mae Clarke]], [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]], [[Dwight Frye]], and [[Edward Van Sloan]].\n\nProduced and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], the film was a commercial success upon release, and was generally well received by both critics and audiences. It spawned [[Frankenstein (Universal film series)|a number of]] [[sequel]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], and has had a significant impact on popular culture: the imagery of a  maniacal \"mad\" scientist with a [[Igor (character)|subservient hunchbacked assistant]] and the film's depiction of Frankenstein's monster have since become iconic. In 1991, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected ''Frankenstein'' for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=U.S. Film Registry Adds 25 'Significant' Movies|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-26-9103130465-story.html|access-date=June 16, 2020|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing: National Film Preservation Board|via=The Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File: Frankenstein trailer (1931).webm|thumb|right|261px|'''PLAY''' 1931 [[trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for ''Frankenstein'']]\n\nIn a village of the [[Bavarian Alps]], Henry Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz, a [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], piece together a human body. Some of the parts are from freshly buried bodies, and some from the bodies of recently hanged criminals. In a laboratory he's built inside a watchtower, Henry desires to create a human, giving this body life through electrical devices. He still needs a brain for his creation. At a nearby school, Henry's former teacher [[Doctor Waldman|Dr. Waldman]] shows his class the brain of an average human being and the corrupted brain of a criminal for comparison. Henry sends Fritz to steal the healthy brain from Waldman's class. Fritz accidentally damages it, and so brings Henry the corrupt brain.\n\nHenry's fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth speaks with their friend Victor about the scientist's peculiar actions and his seclusion. Elizabeth and Victor ask Waldman for help understanding Henry's behavior, and Waldman reveals he is aware Henry wishes to create life. Concerned for Henry, they arrive at the lab just as he makes his final preparations, the lifeless body on an operating table. As a storm rages, Henry invites Elizabeth and the others to watch. Henry and Fritz raise the operating table toward an opening at the top of the tower. The creature and Henry's equipment are exposed to the lightning storm and empowered, bringing the creature to life.\n\nFrankenstein's Monster, despite its grotesque form, seems to be an innocent, childlike creation. Henry welcomes it into his laboratory and asks it to sit, which it does. He opens up the roof, causing the Monster to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the Monster. Its fright is mistaken by Henry and Waldman for an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. Hearing Fritz shriek in the dungeon, Henry and Waldman run down, finding that the Monster has strangled and hanged Fritz. The Monster lunges at the two but they lock the Monster inside. Realizing the Monster must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the Monster and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the Monster lunges at Henry as Waldman injects the drug into the Monster's back. The Monster falls to the floor unconscious.\n\nHenry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry's father take him home. Henry is worried about the Monster, but Waldman reassures him that he will destroy it. While Henry is at home, recovered and preparing for his wedding, Waldman examines the Monster. As he prepares to vivisect it, the Monster strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape, encountering a farmer's young daughter, Maria. She asks him to play a game with her in which they toss flowers onto a lake. The Monster enjoys the game, but when they run out of flowers he throws Maria into the lake, where she disappears beneath the surface. The Monster runs away.\n\nWith preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. Victor rushes in, saying that Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the Monster. The Monster enters Elizabeth's room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth unconscious. The Monster has escaped.\n\nMaria's father arrives, carrying his drowned daughter's body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form a search party to capture the Monster. During the search, Henry is attacked by the Monster. The Monster knocks Henry unconscious and carries him to an old mill. The peasants hear his cries and find the Monster has climbed to the top, dragging Henry with him. The Monster hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the vanes of the windmill, saving his life. Some of the villagers bring him home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, with the Monster trapped inside.\n\nAt Castle Frankenstein, Henry's father celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:Poster - Frankenstein 02.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Frankenstein'' [[movie theater]] [[film poster|lobby card]].]]\n* [[Colin Clive]] as [[Victor Frankenstein|Henry Frankenstein]], a mad scientist who creates The Monster and is engaged to Elizabeth.\n* [[Mae Clarke]] as [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], Henry's fianc\u00e9e who tries to find out about his experiments with Victor and Dr. Waldman. \n* [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]] as Victor Moritz, Henry's friend, who along with Elizabeth and Dr. Waldman, also tries to find out about his experiments. \n* [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|The Monster]], Henry's creation who wreaks havoc on the village.\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Dr. Waldman]], Henry's former college professor who investigates his experiments with Victor and Elizabeth. \n* [[Dwight Frye]] as Fritz, Henry's assistant who also abuses The Monster.\n* [[Frederick Kerr]] as Baron Frankenstein, Henry's father who is also suspicious about him. \n* [[Lionel Belmore]] as Herr Vogel, the [[Burgomaster]] of the village who plans Henry and Elizabeth's wedding. \n* [[Marilyn Harris (actress)|Marilyn Harris]] as Maria, Ludwig's daughter who befriends The Monster. \n* [[Michael Mark (actor)|Michael Mark]] as Ludwig, Maria's father who creates a town mob to kill The Monster at the end of the film.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:KarloffFrankensteinRealart.png|thumb|left|1951 re-release lobby card]]\n[[Image:1931 lugosi frankenstein.jpg|right|thumb|upright|1931 original [[Bela Lugosi]] casting announcement.]]\nIn 1930, [[Universal Studios]] had lost $2.2&nbsp;million in revenues.

However, the actor was expected by producer Carl Laemmle Jr. to play the Monster<ref>Gregory, Wiliam M. 1981. ''It's Alive! The Classic Cinema Saga of Frankenstein''. San Diego: A. S.

The initial director was [[Robert Florey]], who had re-characterized the Monster as a simple killing machine, without a touch of human interest or pathos, unlike in the original Shelley novel. This reportedly caused Lugosi to complain, \"I was a star in my country<ref>Bela Lugosi was born outside the western border of [[Transylvania]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Lugoj]], [[Romania]]).</ref> and I will not be a scarecrow over here!\"<ref name=\"Sin42-43\">Vieira. pgs. 42\u20133</ref> Florey later wrote that \"the Hungarian actor didn't show himself very enthusiastic for the role and didn't want to play it\". However, the decision may not have been Lugosi's in any case, since recent evidence suggests that he was kicked off the project, along with director Robert Florey, when the newly arrived [[James Whale]] asked for the property and later cast Karloff, who resembled Whale.<ref>{{cite book |last=Riley |first=Philip J. |date= 2010|title=Robert Florey's Frankenstein Starring Bela Lugosi|location=Albany, GA |publisher=BearManor Media |page=15 |isbn=978-1-59393-479-8}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Whale and Karloff.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[James Whale]] and Boris Karloff, 1931]]\nActors who worked on the project either were, or shortly became familiar to the fans of the Universal horror films. These included [[Frederick Kerr]] as the old [[Baron Frankenstein]], Henry's father; [[Lionel Belmore]] as Herr Vogel, the B\u00fcrgermeister; [[Marilyn Harris (actor)|Marilyn Harris]] as Little Maria, the girl the Monster accidentally kills; [[Dwight Frye]] as Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant, Fritz; and Michael Mark as Ludwig, Maria's father.\n\n[[Kenneth Strickfaden]] designed the electrical effects that were used in the \"creation scene\". They were so successful that such effects came to be considered an essential part of every subsequent Universal film involving Frankenstein's Monster. Accordingly, the equipment used to produce them has come to be referred to in fan circles as \"Strickfadens\". It appears that Strickfaden managed to secure the use of at least one [[Tesla Coil]] built by the inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] himself.<ref>\n{{cite book | last = Golman | first = Harry\n| title = Kenneth Strickfaden, Dr. Frankenstein's Electrician\n| publisher = McFarland & Company | date = November 11, 2005\n| isbn = 0-7864-2064-2}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened in New York City at the [[Sony Hall|Mayfair Theatre]] on December 4, 1931, and grossed $53,000 in one week.<ref name=\"Sin42-43\"/>\n\nFlorey and Lugosi were given the ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' film, as a consolation. Lugosi would later go on to play Frankenstein's Monster in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' a decade later, when his career was in decline (in the original shooting script the Monster spoke, cancelling Lugosi's initial objection to the part, but his filmed dialogue sequences were cut prior to release, along with the premise that the Monster was blind, which was the way Lugosi had played it).<ref>''MagicImage Filmbooks Series: Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man''</ref>\n\n==Pre-Code era scenes and censorship history==\n[[File:FrankensteinLobbyCardKarloffandClive.png|right|thumb|upright|[[Colin Clive]] and Karloff in colorized photograph from ''Frankenstein'' (1931).]]\nThe scene in which the Monster throws the little girl, Maria, into the lake and accidentally drowns her has long been controversial. Upon its original 1931 release, the second part of this scene was cut by state censorship boards in [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"Sin42-43\" /> Those states also objected to a line they considered [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] that occurred during Frankenstein's exuberance when he first learns that his creature is alive. The original relevant passage was:\n<blockquote>VICTOR: \"Henry, in the name of God!\"<br>\nHENRY: \"In the name of God? Now I know what it feels like to BE God!\"<ref name=\"Sin42-43\"/></blockquote>\n[[Kansas]] requested the cutting of 32 scenes, which, if they had been removed, would have cut a literal half of the film.<ref>Doherty. pg. 297</ref> Jason Joy of the [[Studio Relations Committee]] sent [[Censorship|censor]] representative [[Joseph Breen]] to urge them to reconsider. Eventually, an edited version was released in Kansas.<ref name=\"Sin42-43\"/>\n\nAs with many [[Pre-Code Hollywood|Pre-Code]] films that were reissued after strict enforcement of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] in 1934, Universal made cuts from the [[original camera negative]],<ref name=\"Sin48\">Vieira. pg. 48</ref> and thus the cut footage is often lost. However, the footage of the girl Maria being thrown into the lake was rediscovered during the 1980s in the collection of the British [[BFI National Archive|National Film Archive]], and it has been reincorporated into modern copies of the film.<ref>Robert Horton [https://books.google.com/books?id=o9irAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 ''Frankenstein''], New York & Chichester: Wallflower Press & Columbia University Press, 2014, p.24</ref>\n\nIn the [[Irish Free State]], the film was banned on February 5, 1932, for being demoralizing and unsuitable for children or \"nervous people\" \u2013 [[Irish Film Classification Office#Certificates|age-restricted certificates]] were not introduced in the country until 1965.

string of sequels, beginning with ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), in which [[Elsa Lanchester]] plays the Monster's bride.\n\nThe next sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), was made, like all those that followed, without Whale or Clive (the latter of whom had died in 1937). This film featured Karloff's last full film performance as the Monster. ''Son of Frankenstein'' presented [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Wolf Frankenstein|Baron Wolf von Frankenstein]], [[Bela Lugosi]] as bearded hunchback Ygor, and [[Lionel Atwill]] as Inspector Krogh.\n\n''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' was released in 1942. The film features [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as the Monster, taking over from Boris Karloff, who played the role in the first three films of the series, and Bela Lugosi in his second appearance as the demented Ygor.\n\nThe fifth installment, ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' was released in 1943, directed by [[Roy William Neill]] and starring [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]]. This is also the sequel to ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', with [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] returning as the Wolf Man.\n\nIn the follow-up, ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944), Karloff returned to the series, but not to reprise his role as the monster, but as the Mad Doctor; the monster was this time portrayed by [[Glenn Strange]]. Chaney Jr. returned as the Wolf Man. Dracula was also featured in the film, played by [[John Carradine]].\n\nIts sequel, ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945), featured the same three monsters, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man with the same cast in their portrayals.\n\nMany of the subsequent films which featured Frankenstein's monster demote the creature to a robotic henchman in someone else's plots, such as in its final Universal film appearance in the deliberately [[farce|farcical]] ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) as well as the aforementioned ''House of Frankenstein'' and ''House of Dracula''.\n\n==Other adaptations==\n{{original research section|date=December 2020}}\n* Karloff would return to the wearing of the makeup and to the role of the monster one last time in a 1962 episode of the television show  ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n* The popular 1960s television sitcom, ''[[The Munsters]]'', depicts the family's father [[Herman Munster|Herman]] as Frankenstein's monster, who married [[Count Dracula]]'s daughter. The make-up for Herman is based on the make-up of Boris Karloff.\n* Frankenstein appears in ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' (1967), a [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] [[Halloween]] special, where Dr. [[Victor Frankenstein|Boris von Frankenstein]] (voiced by Karloff) invites various classic monsters to a reunion at his castle with intentions to announce his retirement and to name his successor.\n* [[Mel Brooks]]'s comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974) parodied elements of the first three [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] ''Frankenstein'' films, while also using the original props built for the 1935 film, provided by their designer [[Kenneth Strickfaden]]. Brooks also recreated the movie into a 2007 [[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]].\n* A live-action parody short film, ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (1984), depicting Victor Frankenstein as a modern [[Americans|American]] boy and his deceased pet dog as the monster, was made by [[Tim Burton]] in 1984. Burton remade it as [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|a full-length animated film]] in 2012.\n\n===Frankenstein's assistant===\nAlthough Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant is often referred to as \"[[Igor (fictional character)|Igor]]\" in descriptions of the films, he is not so called in the earliest films. In both ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'', Frankenstein has an assistant, who is played both times by [[Dwight Frye]], who is disabled. In the original 1931 film the character is named \"Fritz\"; he is hunchbacked and walks with the aid of a small cane. Fritz did not originate from the ''Frankenstein'' novel, and instead originated from the earliest recorded play adaptation, ''[[Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein]]'', where he was played by [[Robert Keeley (comedian)|Robert Keeley]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Behrendt |first=Stephen C. |date=2012 |title=\"A Hideous Bit of Morbidity\": An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I |publisher=McFarland |page=97 |isbn=978-0786469093 |quote=Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' was adapted for the stage many times, and the first of these interpretations was Richard Brinsley Peake's ''Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein'' (1823), which dramatized key scenes from the novel and added Frankenstein's assistant, Fritz, to the mix.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/peake/apparatus/cast-characters.html |title=Cast and Characters \u2013 Romantic Circles |last=Doe |first=John |publisher=RC |date=August 2001 |website=Romantic Circles |access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Son-of-frankensteinCropped.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Boris Karloff as the monster, [[Basil Rathbone]] as Dr. Frankenstein's son, and [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Igor (character)|Ygor]] in ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939).]]\nIn ''Bride of Frankenstein'', Frye plays \"Karl\" a murderer who stands upright but has a lumbering metal brace on both legs that can be heard clicking loudly with every step. Both characters would be killed by Karloff's monster in their respective films. Frye also appears in later films in the series, such as in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943).\n\nIt was not until ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939) that a character called \"Ygor\" first appears, here played by [[Bela Lugosi]] and revived by Lugosi in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) after his apparent murder in the earlier film. This character \u2013 a deranged blacksmith whose neck was broken and twisted due to a botched hanging \u2013 befriends the monster and later helps Dr. Wolf Frankenstein, leading to the \"hunchbacked assistant\" called \"Igor\" commonly associated with ''Frankenstein'' in popular culture. Regarding ''Son of Frankenstein'', the film's director [[Rowland V. Lee]] said his crew let Lugosi \"work on the characterization; the interpretation he gave us was imaginative and totally unexpected ... when we finished shooting, there was no doubt in anyone's mind that he stole the show. Karloff's monster was weak by comparison\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Son of Frankenstein|first=Phil |last=Edwards|publisher=[[Marvel UK]]|isbn=0786402571|volume=3|issue=10|magazine=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|date=January 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Cancelled remake==\n[[Guillermo del Toro]] had expressed interest in directing the reboot film for Universal.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brendon Connelly|title=Guillermo Del Toro Confirms Hugo Weaving for the Hobbit...
