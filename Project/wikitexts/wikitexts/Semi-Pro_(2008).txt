The film was directed by [[Kent Alterman]] in his directorial debut, written by [[Scot Armstrong]], and produced by Jimmy Miller. It stars [[Will Ferrell]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Andr\u00e9 3000|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin]] and [[Maura Tierney]], set during the final season of the [[American Basketball Association]] and telling the story of a fictional ABA team desperate to survive the league's merger with the [[NBA]]. The film was shot in [[Los Angeles]] near [[Dodger Stadium]] (in the gym of the [[Los Angeles City Fire Department]] Training Center), in [[Detroit]], and in [[Flint, Michigan]]. Released in theaters on February 19, 2008 and released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on June 3, 2008,<ref name=\"mojo\" /> it was the last film from [[New Line Cinema]] before they were absorbed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. As of 2021, it is the only film directed by [[Kent Alterman]]. The film received generally negative reviews, with critics criticizing the script, though Ferrell\u2019s performance received praise.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1976, Jackie Moon is a singer who used the profits from his [[one-hit wonder]], \"Love Me Sexy\", to buy a basketball team in the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA), the [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] Tropics, becoming the owner, head coach, starting [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]], and pre-game announcer. At a team owner's meeting, the ABA Commissioner announces a plan to [[ABA-NBA merger|merge the league]] with the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), but only four teams will move to the more established league. The Tropics, the worst team in the league, are in danger of dissolving. Jackie, thinking fast, argues that the teams with the four best records should be merged and the Commissioner accepts.\n\nJackie trades the team's washing machine to the [[Kentucky Colonels]] for Ed Monix, a backup [[point guard]] who won an NBA Championship with the [[Boston Celtics]], but did not play during the playoffs. The Commissioner reveals that in addition to finishing in the top four, the Tropics will also need at least 2,000 fans at every remaining home game. Jackie begins to stage extremely desperate stunts in order to boost attendance, like wrestling a bear named Dewey, as well as the increased intensity of Clarence Withers, the Tropics' best player. Monix takes over as offensive and defensive coordinator and starting point guard, leaving Jackie as the head coach. Monix trains the team rigorously with a play he calls the \"Puke\", as the players are to run it until they literally throw up.\n\nFrom Monix's training, the Tropics go on a winning run, moving from last to fifth. Jackie gets a visit from the Commissioner. The NBA does not think that Flint has a large enough media market and will not allow the Tropics into the league even if they beat the first place [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the last game of the season. Jackie admits that he stole \"Love Me Sexy\" from a napkin his mother wrote on three weeks before she died. Realizing that all his assets are basically stolen, Jackie trades Withers to the Spurs so that he may realize his dream of playing in the NBA. Monix reassembles and inspires the team to leave everything on the court, while they may not be able to continue the franchise after this season, they have come very far and still have a lot to prove.\n\nGoing into the Spurs game, which Jackie declares the \"MegaBowl\", the Tropics are in fifth place and with a win they would make it into fourth, even though they will not be allowed into the NBA. The Tropics fall behind quickly, and Jackie is knocked unconscious when fouled hard at the end of the first half. Withers decides he has seen enough and rejoins the Tropics in their locker room, destroying his chance at the NBA with the Spurs. An unconscious Jackie imagines that he is in heaven with his mother. He apologizes for stealing her song and she gives him a weapon in order to win. Starting the second half, the Tropics reveal their new weapon: the [[Alley-oop (basketball)|alley-oop]]. With the return of Withers, the alley-oop is very effective, but the referee initially calls the play a foul. After some persuasion by Jackie and Monix, the referee is convinced that it is a legitimate play. With seconds left, they have closed to within two points, 117\u2013115, when the Spurs execute a defence against the Alley-Oop. Monix calls a time-out and tells them to run the \"Puke\", executing multiple razzle-dazzle passes ending with the ball in Jackie's hands under the net{{snd}}but he gets fouled hard again with two seconds left, giving him 2 [[free throws]]. Shooting granny style, Jackie sinks the first basket. The second bounces off the rim but Monix tips in the rebound right at the [[buzzer beater|buzzer]] for two points to win, sparking a wild celebration in the arena and the streets of Flint.\n\nThe Spurs' coach offers Withers his position back, while the now-former ABA Commissioner offers Jackie a position on the staff of the NBA Assistant Commissioner, as a marketing director.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Will Ferrell]] as Jackie Moon \u2013 The owner/player/coach of the failing Flint Tropics, famous for the aging disco hit \"Love Me Sexy\".\n*[[Woody Harrelson]] as Ed Monix \u2013 The aging point guard, and former NBA Champion, although he sat through every playoff game for the Boston Celtics.\n*[[Andr\u00e9 3000|Andr\u00e9 Benjamin]] as Clarence Withers aka Coffee Black \u2013 dreams to play in the NBA, although all he ever does is gossip about going.\n*[[Maura Tierney]] as Lynn \u2013 Ed Monix's love interest.\n*[[Andrew Daly]] as Dick Pepperfield \u2013 Play-By-Play Announcer for the Tropics. \n*[[Will Arnett]] as Lou Redwood \u2013 Color Commentator for the Tropics.
