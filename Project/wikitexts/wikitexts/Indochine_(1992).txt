It is the story of \u00c9liane Devries, a French plantation owner, and of her adopted [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] daughter, Camille, set against the backdrop of the rising [[Vietnam]]ese nationalist movement. The screenplay was written by novelist [[\u00c9rik Orsenna]], screenwriters [[Louis Gardel]] and Catherine Cohen, and director [[R\u00e9gis Wargnier]]. The film stars [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Vincent P\u00e9rez]], [[Linh Dan Pham]], [[Jean Yanne]] and [[Dominique Blanc]]. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[65th Academy Awards]].<ref name=\"Oscars1993\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is narrated by \u00c9liane Devries, a woman born to French parents in colonial [[French Indochina|Indochina]], and is told through flashbacks. In 1930, \u00c9liane runs her and her widowed father's large [[rubber]] [[plantation]] with many indentured laborers, whom she casually refers to as her [[coolies]], and divides her days between her homes at the plantation and outside [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]]. She is also the adoptive mother of Camille, whose birth parents were friends of \u00c9liane's and members of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]]. Guy Asselin, the head of the French security services in Indochina, courts \u00c9liane, but she rejects him and raises Camille alone giving her the education of a privileged European through her teens.\n\n\u00c9liane meets a young [[French Navy]] lieutenant, Jean-Baptiste Le Guen, when they bid on the same painting at an [[auction]]. She is flustered when he challenges her publicly and surprised when he turns up at her plantation days later, searching for a boy whose [[sampan]] he set ablaze on suspicion of [[opium]] smuggling. \u00c9liane and Jean-Baptiste begin a torrid affair.\n\nCamille meets Jean-Baptiste by chance one day when he rescues her from a terrorist attack. Believing him to have saved her life, Camille falls in love with Jean-Baptiste at first sight, while Jean-Baptiste has no inkling of Camille's relation to \u00c9liane. When \u00c9liane learns of Camille's love for Jean-Baptiste, she uses her connections with high-ranking Navy officials to get Jean-Baptiste transferred to [[Haiphong]]. Jean-Baptiste angrily confronts \u00c9liane about his transfer during a Christmas party at her home, resulting in a heated argument where he slaps her in front of his fellow officers. For his transgression, Jean-Baptiste is sent to the notorious [[H\u1ea1 Long Bay|Dragon Islet]] (H\u00f2n R\u1ed3ng), a remote French military base in northern Indochina.\n\n\u00c9liane allows Camille to become engaged to Thanh, a pro-[[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist]] Vietnamese boy expelled as a student from France because of his support for the 1930 [[Y\u00ean B\u00e1i mutiny]]. A sympathetic Thanh allows Camille to search for Jean-Baptiste up north. Camille travels on foot and eventually makes it to Dragon Islet, where she and a Vietnamese family she travels with are imprisoned alongside other laborers. When Camille comes across the sight of her traveling companions brutally tortured and murdered by French officers, she attacks a French officer and shoots him in the struggle. Jean-Baptiste defies his superiors to protect Camille in the ensuing firefight, and the two set sail and escape Dragon Islet as outlaws.\n\nAfter spending several days adrift in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], Camille and Jean-Baptiste reach land and are taken in by a Communist theater troupe, who offers the couple refuge in a secluded valley. After several months, Camille has become pregnant with Jean-Baptiste's child, but are told they must vacate the valley out of safety. Thanh, now a high-ranking Communist operative, arranges for the theater troupe to smuggle the lovers into China.\n\nGuy attempts to use operatives to quell the growing insurrections by laborers and to locate Camille and Jean-Baptiste, without success. Camille and Jean-Baptiste's story becomes a celebrated legend in [[tu\u1ed3ng]] performances by Vietnamese actors, earning Camille the popular nickname \"the Red Princess\". When the couple nears the Chinese border, Jean-Baptiste takes his and Camille's newborn son to [[baptize]] him in a river while she's asleep. After christening the baby \u00c9tienne, he is ambushed and apprehended by several French soldiers. A distraught Camille evades capture and escapes with the theater troupe, while French authorities remand Jean-Baptiste to a Saigon jail and hand \u00c9tienne over to \u00c9liane.\n\nAfter some days in prison, Jean-Baptiste agrees to talk if he can first see his son. The Navy, which has authority over the case and refuses to subject Jean-Baptiste to interrogation by the police, plans to court-martial Jean-Baptiste in [[Brest, France]] to avoid the public outcry that would likely arise from a trial in Indochina. Jean-Baptiste is allowed a 24-hour visitation with \u00c9tienne before being taken to France. He goes to see \u00c9liane, who lets him stay with \u00c9tienne at her Saigon residence for the night.\n\nThe next day, \u00c9liane finds Jean-Baptiste dead in his bed with a gunshot to his temple, a gun in hand, and an unharmed \u00c9tienne. Outraged, \u00c9liane tells Guy she suspects the police murdered him, but Guy's girlfriend tells \u00c9liane that the Communists may have killed Jean-Baptiste to silence him. With no evidence sought for either suspicion, Jean-Baptiste's death is ruled a suicide. Camille is captured and sent to [[C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Prison|Poulo-Condor]] \u2013 a high security prison where visitors are not permitted and not even \u00c9liane or Guy can help free her. After five years, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] comes to power and releases all political prisoners including Camille. \u00c9liane reunites with Camille, but she declines to return to her mother and son, choosing instead to join the Communists and [[First Indochina War|fight for Vietnam's independence]]. Camille reasons she does not wish for her son to know the horrors she has witnessed, and tells her mother that French colonialism is drawing to an end. Taking \u00c9tienne with her, \u00c9liane sells her plantation and leaves Indochina.\n\nIn 1954, \u00c9liane finishes telling her story to a grown \u00c9tienne. They have both come to [[Switzerland]], where Camille is a [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist Party]] delegate to the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Conference]]. \u00c9tienne goes to the negotiators' hotel intending to find his birth mother, but it is so crowded with people that he is not sure how Camille can find or recognize him. He tells \u00c9liane he sees her as his mother.\n\nAs the film concludes, an epilogue notes the next day, French Indochina becomes independent from France and [[Partition of Vietnam|Vietnam is partitioned]] into [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Catherine Deneuve]] as \u00c9liane Devries\n*[[Vincent P\u00e9rez]] as Jean-Baptiste \n*[[Linh Dan Pham]] as Camille\n*[[Jean Yanne]] as Guy \n*[[Dominique Blanc]] as Yvette \n*Henri Marteau as \u00c9mile \n*Thi Hoe Tranh Huu Trieu as Mme.

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote the film \"intends to be the French '<nowiki/>''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'',' a story of romance and separation, told against the backdrop of a ruinous war\". He continued \"'''Indochine''<nowiki/>' is an ambitious, gorgeous missed opportunity \u2013 too slow, too long, too composed. It is not a successful film, and yet there is so much good in it that perhaps it's worth seeing anyway\u2026The beauty, the photography, the impact of the scenes shot on location in Vietnam, are all striking.\u201c<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=5 February 1993 |title=Indochine movie review |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/indochine-1993 |access-date=13 April 2022 |website=[[Rogerebert.com]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\nRita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' found the transformation of Camille from a naive, pampered innocent to Communist revolutionary to be a compelling plot line, but noted, \"The trouble is we never see the fragile teenager undergo this surprising metamorphosis. Director [[R\u00e9gis Wargnier|Regis Wargnier]] seems far more interested in what the white folks are doing back on the plantation\". She commented further, \"Wargnier, who learned his craft at the elbow of [[Claude Chabrol]], does expose the geographic splendors of Southeast Asia as well as the common sense of its people, whose sly observations lend '''Indochine''<nowiki/>' both energy and levity\".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kempley |first=Rita |date=5 February 1993 |title=Indochine |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/indochinepg13kempley_a0a35d.htm |access-date=13 April 2022}}</ref>\n\nOf the film's metaphorical mother-daughter relationship between \u00c9liane and her adopted Vietnamese daughter Camille, Nick Davis said \u201c''Indochine''<nowiki/>'s allegorical intentions actually play much better than the specific dramas enacted among its characters\", adding \"While Eliane-as-Establishment, Jean-Baptiste-as-Rebellious-Lower-Class-Youth, and Camille-as-Uneasy Cultural Mixture seem to follow the historical pattern of France's relationship with Indochina, their interactions only make sense to the extent they are interpreted as solely symbolic figures\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davis |first=Nick |title=Indochine |url=http://www.nicksflickpicks.com/indochin.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010228074510/http://www.nicksflickpicks.com/indochin.html |archive-date=28 February 2001 |access-date=13 April 2022 |website=Nick\u2019s Flick Picks}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
