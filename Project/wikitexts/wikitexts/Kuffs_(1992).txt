Evans]] and produced by Raynold Gideon. The film stars [[Christian Slater]] and [[Tony Goldwyn]], as well as [[Milla Jovovich]] in her fourth feature film and [[Ashley Judd]] in her film debut. The film was written directly for the screen by Evans and Gideon, both of whom had Slater in mind for the title role. The film is set in and was filmed around [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and involves a type of law enforcement unique to San Francisco: the [[San Francisco Patrol Special Police|Patrol Special police]] franchises.\n\n==Plot==\nGeorge Kuffs, an irresponsible 21-year-old high school dropout from San Francisco, has walked out on his pregnant girlfriend Maya. Having lost his job and with no other prospects, George visits his brother, Brad, to ask for money. Brad serves as an officer in the [[San Francisco Patrol Special Police]], a [[civilian]] [[auxiliary police]] unit that has potential officers assign themselves specific areas and work on a for-hire basis. Brad, unwilling to loan George any money, suggests George join him as a Patrol Special in the district he owns and work under him. Before George can decide on accepting the offer, Brad is shot by a man named Kane, whom George sees holding the gun. Kane drops the gun and nonchalantly walks away from the scene, and Brad is rushed to the hospital.\n\nGeorge is brought in for a lineup where he identifies Kane as the shooter, but the police are forced to release him because George did not actually see Kane, who had worn gloves to prevent fingerprints, fire the gun. Shortly after, George is told by Captain Morino, a friend of Brad's, that Brad died from his injuries and that George has been bequeathed Brad's district. Local businessman Sam Jones tries to purchase the district so he can control it, but George decides to keep it and train to be a police officer. Seen as unskilled and rude, George draws the mocking of his fellow Patrol Specials and the ire of Officer Ted Bukowsky -a police liaison who has been assigned to work with the Patrol Specials as punishment for having an affair with the police chief's wife. George spikes Ted's coffee with sleeping pills while on duty, resulting in Ted getting suspended.\n\nAfter George is shot and wounded by a suicidal writer, his life begins to improve. He cracks a criminal enterprise run out of a Chinese dry cleaner (run by Jones), gaining respect and admiration from his fellow officers, and also reconnects with Maya. George gets justice for his brother's murder by killing Kane (in self-defense) during a failed ambush in George's apartment. His joy is short lived, however; Jones gives George's high school transcript to the Patrol Specials -proving George is ineligible to be a police officer because he never graduated- and declares he will take control of the district.\n\nGeorge does not stop tracking Jones and seeks out the still-suspended Ted for help. They wind up in a massive rooftop shootout with Jones' goons and are eventually joined by the rest of the police unit. George corners Jones in the lowest level of a parking garage and fatally shoots him in self-defense.\n\nGeorge marries Maya and becomes the proud father of a baby girl named Sarah. At Maya's suggestion, he takes the high school equivalency exam and passes, allowing him to continue working as an officer. He also takes out a loan to expand his brother's district.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Officer George Kuffs\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as Maya Carlton\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as Officer Ted Bukovsky\n* [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Officer Brad Kuffs\n* [[Troy Evans (actor)|Troy Evans]] as Captain Morino\n* [[George de la Pe\u00f1a]] as Sam Jones\n* [[Leon Rippy]] as Kane\n* [[Mary Ellen Trainor]] as Officer Nikki Allyn\n* Joshua Cadman as Officer Bill Donnelly\n* Kim Robillard as Peter Coca\n* [[Scott Williamson]] as Alan Eddy\n* [[Aki Aleong]] as Mr. Chang\n* [[Henry G.

Because of his popularity as a [[teen idol]], Slater said he was asked to do a scene in his underwear.  He refused, saying that it was too gratuitous.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-01-13/features/1992013091_1_christian-slater-kuffs-robin-hood|title=Hot Christian Slater enjoys 'Kuffs' role: 'I could just relax and play the character'|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=1992-01-13|access-date=2015-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Kuffs'' was released in the United States on January 10, 1992.
