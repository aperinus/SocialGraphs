The film was written and directed by [[Don Mancini]], who created the series and has written all of the films (except the [[Child's Play (2019 film)|2019 remake]]), and stars [[Jennifer Tilly]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Hannah Spearritt]], [[John Waters]], [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] and [[Brad Dourif]].  With this entry, Mancini made his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. The film is set six years after ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' and follows a young doll named Glen, the son of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]] and [[Tiffany (Child's Play)|Tiffany]], resurrecting his parents, causing chaos.\n\nThe film, shot in [[Romania]], continues the series' evolution from the pure horror genre of the first three films to a hybrid horror-comedy.<ref name=\"WPF 2017\">{{cite news | title=Cult of Chucky a fine fit in popular slasher series | website=Winnipeg Free Press | date=October 7, 2017 | url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/movies/cult-of-chucky-a-fine-fit-in-popular-slasher-series-449782683.html | access-date=December 13, 2017| last1=King | first1=Randall }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Dunkley | first=Cathy | title=Redman, Waters go to 'Seed' | website=Variety | date=March 16, 2004 | url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/redman-waters-go-to-seed-1117901763/ | access-date=December 13, 2017}}</ref> It was the last ''Child's Play'' film from the original continuity to be released in theaters, with all future installments to be released [[direct to DVD|direct-to-video]] until the [[Child's Play (2019 film)|2019 reboot]]. The film was followed by another sequel, ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'', released on home video and [[Netflix]] in 2013.\n\n''Seed of Chucky'' grossed over $24 million against a $12 million budget. Like its predecessor, the film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nSix years after the [[Bride of Chucky|previous film]], Glen, the benevolent living-doll son of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]] and [[Tiffany Valentine|Tiffany]], has a nightmare in which he murders a little girl's parents. In reality, he is living as a dummy for \"Psychs\", an abusive [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] in England. Glen sees a preview of [[Jennifer Tilly]]'s new horror film ''Chucky Goes Psycho'' on television, which features Chucky and Tiffany dolls rebuilt from their original remains; Glen realizes that he is their son.\n\nDesperate to know his parents, Glen escapes Psychs and tracks the Chucky and Tiffany dolls to a prop room in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. Glen uses the Heart of Damballa, a [[Haitian Vodou#Reception|voodoo amulet]], to bring them back to life. Chucky faints upon learning he has a son, but Tiffany is overjoyed. When a [[Tony Gardner (designer)|special effects technician]] starts taking Tiffany apart, she and Chucky decapitate him with a wire. Jennifer finds the beheaded body and calls the police. Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen sneak a ride to her home in her [[limousine]].\n\nHaving witnessed his parents murder the technician, Glen asks them why they kill, as he feels violence is bad. Chucky replies that it helps them to relax. On the other hand, Tiffany, feeling parental responsibility, agrees with Glen and forces Chucky to agree to stop killing for the sake of their son; Chucky falsely promises to do so. Jennifer tries to get a role as the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] in [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]'s directorial debut. After he tells her she is not right for the part, Jennifer invites him to her home, intending to [[Casting couch|seduce him for the role]].\n\nChucky and Tiffany make plans to transfer their souls into Redman and Jennifer. Tiffany knocks them out and uses a turkey baster to [[Insemination|inseminate]] Jennifer with Chucky's semen. Chucky takes Glen on a car ride {{ndash}} during which they drive [[Britney Spears]]' car off the road {{ndash}} to photographer Pete Peters' [[darkroom]]. Peters had taken pictures of Tilly kissing Redman and of Chucky masturbating. Glen tries to warn Peters that Chucky is about to attack, but Peters bumps into a shelf and causes a jar of [[sulphuric acid]] to fall into his head, accidentally killing him. Chucky is overjoyed, believing Glen did this on purpose, and takes a picture to celebrate, much to the dismay of both Glen and Tiffany.\n\nJennifer awakens the following morning, realizes that she is pregnant, and claims Redman is responsible. Redman denies this and reveals that he previously had a [[vasectomy]], leaving Jennifer confused. Tiffany [[Disembowelment|eviscerates]] Redman in anger. The next day, Jennifer wakes up to find herself with a full pregnant belly, a consequence of the voodoo magic. Chucky captures Jennifer and her [[chauffeur]] Stan to take Redman's place. Jennifer's assistant Joan tries to help her, but she is killed by Glen's murderous twin sister, Glenda, whose soul shares Glen's body and has taken over. Tiffany smacks Glenda to bring back Glen, who is horrified at what has happened.\n\nJennifer gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl, and Tiffany realizes that both Glen and Glenda can inhabit the two children. Chucky has an epiphany: he has finally accepted his circumstances as a living doll and no longer wishes to become human. Disgusted, Tiffany rejects Chucky and decides to take Glen with her. Enraged, Chucky throws a knife at Jennifer to stop Tiffany from leaving him, but Stan jumps in the way to save her. The police arrive, forcing the dolls to flee.\n\nJennifer is rushed to the hospital. Tiffany drugs Jennifer and begins to possess her, but Chucky breaks in and kills Tiffany with an axe. Devastated, Glen snaps and attacks Chucky, striking him with the axe. Chucky assumes it's Glenda again, but Glen reveals it is actually him, finally able to kill in revenge for his mother's death. Glen shouts at his father, asking if he is finally proud of him, as he dismembers Chucky, who praises Glen for his actions, before being decapitated. Realizing what he has done, Glen suffers an emotional breakdown as Jennifer comforts him.\n\nFive years later, at a birthday party for Jennifer's children, a nanny quits her job because Jennifer's daughter Glenda scares her. Jennifer beats her to death, revealing that Tiffany was successful in transferring her soul into Jennifer's body. Meanwhile, Glen opens a birthday present to see Chucky's severed arm, which springs up to grab him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Jennifer Tilly]] as herself and the voice of [[Tiffany Valentine|Tiffany]]<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as the voice of [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]]<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]] as the voice of Glen / Glenda<ref name=\"Film Review 2005\">{{cite book | title=Film Review | publisher=Orpheus Pub. | issue=no. 655; nos. 657-658 | year=2005 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gn9ZAAAAMAAJ | access-date=December 13, 2017 | page=68}}</ref>\n* [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] as himself<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* [[Hannah Spearritt]] as Joan<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* [[John Waters]] as Pete Peters<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* [[Keith-Lee Castle]] as Psychs<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* Steve Lawton as Stan<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] as himself<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as [[Santa Claus|Santa]]<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* [[Nicholas Rowe (actor)|Nicholas Rowe]] as Lawyer\n* [[Stephanie Chambers]] as Claudia's mum<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* Simon James Morgan as Claudia's dad\n* Betty Simons-Denville as Claudia\n* Rebecca Santos as Fulvia\n* Beans El-Balawi as Human Glen<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\">{{cite book | last1=Willis | first1=J. | last2=Monush | first2=B. | title=Screen World: 2005 Film Annual | publisher=Hal Leonard | series=Applause Books | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-55783-667-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1uCCm0TvvG0C&pg=PA220 | access-date=December 13, 2017 | page=220}}</ref>\n* Kristina Hewitt as Human Glenda<ref name=\"Willis Monush 2006\"/>\n* Daniel Getzoff as Assistant Director\n* Nicola Mycroft as Reporter\n* Guy J.
