Along the way he has to juggle the agendas of  headstrong network president Lenny (Weaver), volatile young stars, his pregnant wife Natalie (Bateman), and an ever-optimistic personal manager Alice (Greer), while suffering very serious back pain.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Duchovny]] as Mike Klein\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Lenny\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as Richard McCallister\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Alice\n* [[Fran Kranz]] as Zack Harper\n* [[Lindsay Sloane]] as Laurel Simon\n* [[Justine Bateman]] as Natalie Klein\n* [[Lucy Davis]] as Chloe McCallister\n* [[Philip Rosenthal]] as Cooper\n* Matt Price as Berg\n* [[Willie Garson]] as Brian\n* [[M.
