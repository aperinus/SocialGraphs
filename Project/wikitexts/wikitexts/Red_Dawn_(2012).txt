It is a [[remake]] of the [[Red Dawn|1984 film of the same name]]. The film stars [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Josh Peck]], [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Adrianne Palicki]], [[Isabel Lucas]], and [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]. The film centers on a group of young people who defend their hometown from a [[North Korea|North Korean]] invasion.\n\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] announced its intention to remake ''Red Dawn'' in May 2008 and subsequently hired Bradley and Ellsworth. The principal characters were cast the following year and the film went into production in September 2009 in [[Mount Clemens, Michigan]]. Originally scheduled to be released on November 24, 2010, the film was shelved because of MGM's [[MGM#Consortium ownership and financial troubles|financial troubles]]. While in [[post-production]], the invading army and antagonists were changed from [[China|Chinese]] to North Korean in order to maintain access to the Chinese box office, though the film was still not released in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Directed%20by%20Hollywood%20Edited%20by%20China.pdf|title=DIRECTED BY HOLLYWOOD, EDITED BY CHINA: HOW CHINA'S CENSORSHIP AND INFLUENCE AFFECT FILMS WORLDWIDE|last1=O\u2019Connor|first1=Sean|last2=Armstrong|first2=Nicholas|date=October 28, 2015|website=The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission|access-date=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBecause of MGM's bankruptcy, the distribution rights were sold to [[FilmDistrict]] in September 2011 and the film was released in the [[United States]] on November 21, 2012 to mostly negative reviews. The film is also a [[Box-office bomb|box-office failure]], grossing $50.9 million against its $65 million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nAn introductory montage shows the fallout of an economic crisis in the [[European Union]] and a weakened [[NATO]] alliance, amid collaborative dealings between a progressively militant [[North Korea]], now led by the young [[Kim Jong-un|Kim Jong Un]], and ultranationalist-dominated [[Russia]]. The increased deployment of [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. troops]] abroad leaves the mainland vulnerable, and American infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to the threat of a cyberattack.\n\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Jed Eckert is home on leave in [[Spokane]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. He reunites with his father, Spokane Police Sergeant Tom Eckert, and his brother, football player Matt Eckert, as well as his childhood friend Toni Walsh and her cousin Erica Martin, Matt's girlfriend. Matt's football team, the Wolverines, suffers a defeat against another team. After the game, they go to a bar but an unexpected blackout leads to them going home.\n\nThe following morning, Jed and Matt are shocked to see swarms of invading North Korean paratroopers and transport aircraft. Their father tells them to flee to their cabin in the woods while he helps the townspeople. They are joined there by Matt's friends Robert Kitner, Daryl Jenkins, Danny Jackson, siblings Julie and Greg Goodyear, a stranger named Pete, and later by Toni; Erica is captured by the North Koreans. Tensions build as the teens try to decide whether to surrender to the invaders or resist, with Pete ending up betraying their position. North Korean soldiers, under the command of Captain Cho, bring Sergeant Eckert and Daryl's father, the mayor, out to convince the group to surrender; while the mayor persuades the boys to give up, Cho executes Sergeant Eckert after he refuses to cooperate and actively encourages them to resist.\n\nLater, Jed announces that he intends to fight and the others agree to join him, calling themselves the Wolverines after their school mascot. After acquiring weapons, establishing a base in an abandoned mine, and being trained by Jed, the Wolverines begin a series of guerrilla attacks against soldiers and collaborators, including Pete who gets killed in a bomb explosion.\n\nAs Matt manages to free Erica from her imprisonment, he jeopardizes the mission resulting in Greg's death, leading to tension between him and Jed. The North Koreans retaliate by bombarding the surrounding woods to destroy the Wolverines' base, killing Danny and Julie, with the remaining survivors fleeing deeper into the woods.\n\nThe Wolverines eventually encounter Marine [[Sergeant Major]] Andrew Tanner and two other Marines, Corporal Smith, and Sergeant Hodges. They reveal that the Russian-backed North Korean invasion used an EMP weapon that crippled the U.S. electrical grid and military, followed by landings along the east and west coasts (Camp Pendleton is hinted by the Marines as having been destroyed in the invasion, as most likely the rest of coastal Southern California), with American counterattacks eventually halting their advances, leaving an area stretching from Michigan to Montana and Alabama to Arizona as \"Free America\", using the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the west and the [[Appalachians]] in the east as geographic buffers, as pockets of patriotic guerrillas in the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada mountains, and in Florida continue to fight. They also reveal that Captain Cho's suitcase contains an EMP-resistant radiotelephone, that if captured would enable the U.S. command to listen in on enemy communication, and gain a tactical advantage in a counter-offensive. The Wolverines assist Tanner, Smith, and Hodges in infiltrating the local police station, the North Koreans' center of operations. They succeed in stealing the suitcase with Jed avenging his father's death by killing Cho, though Hodges is killed in the firefight.\n\nAfter they successfully escape with the suitcase, the Wolverines and Marines regroup in a safe house. However, they are ambushed by Russian [[Spetsnaz]] and Jed is killed in the firefight. Matt and the rest of the group escape with the suitcase. Robert realizes that, during the escape from the police station, Daryl was tagged with a subcutaneous tracking device that the Russians used to find them. After some thought, Daryl accepts the fact that he cannot go on with them and decides to stay behind while the rest continue on to the Marines' extraction point.\n\nTanner and Smith depart in a UH-1 with the suitcase. The remaining Wolverines decide to stay behind and continue to fight, recruiting more members and raiding prisoner camps, with Matt now leading the effort to continue opposing the occupation. The flag of Free America is carried by patriots in a daring raid on a North Korean concentration camp in the final shot of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Jed Eckert\n* [[Josh Peck]] as Matt Eckert\n* [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Robert Kitner\n* [[Adrianne Palicki]] as Toni Walsh\n* [[Isabel Lucas]] as Erica Martin\n* Connor Cruise as Daryl Jenkins\n* [[Alyssa Diaz]] as Julie Goodyear\n* [[Brett Cullen]] as Tom Eckert\n* [[Edwin Hodge]] as Danny\n* Julian Alcaraz as Greg\n* [[Will Yun Lee]] as Captain Cho\n* [[Michael Beach]] as Mayor Jenkins\n* [[Matt Gerald]] as Hodges\n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as Tanner\n}}\n\nIn addition, [[Kenneth Choi]] appears as Smith.\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2008, at the [[Festival de Cannes]], [[Harry E.

The film drew sharp criticism from the ''[[Global Times]]'', one of the leading Chinese state-run newspapers, with headlines such as \"U.S. reshoots Cold War movie to demonize China\" and \"American movie plants hostile seeds against China\". One of the articles stated: \"China can still feel U.S. distrust and fear, especially among its people.

The changes reportedly cost less than $1 million and involve changing an opening sequence summarizing the story's fictional backdrop (dropping the original storyline of Chinese \"[[repossession]]\" after the US [[Sovereign default|defaults on loans]] for a North Korean invasion), re-editing two scenes, and using digital technology to change Chinese symbols and dialogue to Korean.<ref>{{cite
