It is based on the story of 24-year-old [[French people|French]] high-wire artist [[Philippe Petit]]'s walk between the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] on August 7, 1974. The film stars [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Petit, alongside [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Charlotte Le Bon]], [[James Badge Dale]], [[Ben Schwartz]], and [[Steve Valentine]].\n\nThe film was released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on September 30, 2015 in the United States in [[IMAX]] 3D, and on October 9 in regular 2D and [[3D film|3D]]. Despite positive reviews, it underperformed at the box office. The film was dedicated to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->\n\nIn 1968, Parisian street performer [[Philippe Petit]] bites a hard candy from the audience, damaging his tooth. In the dentist's waiting room, he sees a photo of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|Twin Towers]] in a magazine. Analyzing it, he dreams of walking a tightrope between the towers. Meanwhile, he is evicted from his parent's house by his father, who disapproves of his job. Philippe returns to the circus that inspired him to wire walk as a child and practices in the big top after hours. He is caught by Papa Rudy, whom he impresses with his juggling skills. Philippe asks Papa Rudy for tips and advice on knot tying and rope rigging, which Papa Rudy agrees to for compensation.\n\nWhile performing one day, Philippe meets Annie, a fellow street performer, and they begin a romantic relationship. Annie supports him on his dream and finds him the perfect place to practice: her music school. Meeting Jean-Louis, a photographer, they become friends, and he, the official photographer and second accomplice in his dream. Jean-Louis introduces Jeff, another accomplice with [[Acrophobia|fear of heights]], to Philippe and Annie. He explains his idea to use a bow and an arrow tied to a fishing line to get the cable across the Towers. After failing his first real performance by falling into a lake due to anxiety, Philippe walks between [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]'s towers in Paris to redeem himself. He succeeds with Jean-Louis' support and is arrested in the process, though he receives universal applause.\n\nPhilippe and Annie travel to America, setting a date for the walk as August 6, 1974. He disguises himself to spy and scout out the locations, impaling his foot on a nail in the process. At one point, he meets a fan of Philippe's, seeing him at Notre Dame: Barry Greenhouse, a life insurance salesman who works in the building, who becomes another team member. They also meet French-bilingual electronics salesman J.P., amateur photographer Albert, and stoner David. The team goes over the plan several times, deciding Philippe must be on the wire before the construction crews arrive at 7:00&nbsp;a.m.\n\nOn the eve of the event, the team encounters several challenges: being three hours behind schedule, guards on the premises, and nearly dropping the heavy cable off the roof. However, they successfully string up the ropes and set the wires. Philippe begins his walk, explaining that everything around him faded once he started, except the wire and himself, and that for the first time in his life, he felt genuinely thankful and at peace. He successfully crosses the gap between the towers while crowds below cheer him on. Once reaching the other building, he has an urge to return, so he walks back again across the void. At one point, he kneels to his audience and even lies down. The police arrive and threaten to remove him by helicopter if he does not get off. But Philippe relentlessly continues to walk back and forth until he achieves the feat a total of six times in his 45-minute performance and feels confident enough to showboat on occasion before complying. He is arrested on site, with the police and construction workers commending him on his bravery.\n\nPhilippe and his accomplices are released, and he decides to stay in New York, but Annie chooses to follow her music dream in Paris. Philippe explains that the building manager gave him a free pass to the observation decks of the towers with the expiry date crossed out and replaced with \"forever\" \u2014 indirectly referring to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]], which resulted in the destruction of both towers.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as [[Philippe Petit]]\n* [[Charlotte Le Bon]] as Annie Allix\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Papa Rudy\n* [[Cl\u00e9ment Sibony]] as Jean-Louis\n* [[James Badge Dale]] as Jean-Pierre\n* [[C\u00e9sar Domboy]] as Jeff\n* [[Ben Schwartz]] as Albert\n* [[Benedict Samuel]] as David\n* [[Steve Valentine]] as Barry Greenhouse\n\n==Production==\nOn January 23, 2014, it was announced that [[Robert Zemeckis]] would direct a film based on the story of [[Philippe Petit]]'s walk between the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in 1974.
