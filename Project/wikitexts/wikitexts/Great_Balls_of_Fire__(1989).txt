Based on a biography by [[Myra Gale Brown|Myra Lewis]] and [[Murray M. Silver Jr.]], the screenplay is written by McBride and Jack Baran. The film is produced by [[Adam Fields]], with executive producers credited as [[Michael Grais]], [[Mark Victor]], and Art Levinson.<ref>{{AFI film|id=58098|title=Great Balls of Fire!}}</ref>\n\nThe film depicts the early career of Lewis, from his rise to rock-and-roll stardom to his controversial marriage to his 13-year-old cousin that led to his downfall. Until the scandal of the marriage depreciated his image, many had thought Lewis would supplant [[Elvis Presley]] as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" in the 1950s.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jerry Lee Lewis]] ([[Dennis Quaid]]) plays piano, as opposed to a guitar like most other rock artists, during [[rock and roll]]'s early years from 1956 to 1958. Jerry Lee is a man with many different sides: a skilled performer with little discipline, and an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]].\n\nAs Jerry Lee rises to the top of the charts with hits such as \"[[Crazy Arms]]\", \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]\", and \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", he falls in love with [[Myra Gale Brown]] ([[Winona Ryder]]), the 13-year-old daughter of his first cousin and bass player J. W. Brown ([[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]]), and eventually marries her ([[elopement|eloping]] to [[Mississippi]]), much to the anger and chagrin of her parents.\n\nJerry Lee's other relationship is that with second cousin and [[televangelist]] [[Jimmy Swaggart]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]) who, during this period, was a struggling [[Pentecostal]] preacher. Jimmy's career kept him in constant conflict with his cousin's wild rock and roll career and brings out some uncomfortable exchanges between the two. The now-financially successful Jerry Lee buys a new car and gives it to his cousin, and when Jimmy praises the Lord for the gift, Jerry Lee replies, \"Don't thank [[Jesus]], thank Jerry Lee Lewis!\"\n\nWhile Jerry Lee is touring in England, a reporter discovers he is married to the underage Myra Gale. Jerry Lee is then condemned as a [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]] and a pervert by the public before being booed and ridiculed off stage at his opening concert; as a result, the tour is cancelled and Jerry Lee is deported. Confident that his career will remain a success, Jerry Lee is undaunted; however, the scandal follows him back to the States.\n\nJerry Lee then begins drinking heavily when record sales and concert attendances are significantly down. Jerry Lee becomes further furious when requested to print a public apology in ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' and becomes increasingly abusive toward Myra. It is during one of these episodes that Myra informs Jerry Lee that she is pregnant, and he collapses into Myra's arms, crying hysterically.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to improve his life, Jerry Lee, with Myra in tow, attends one of Swaggart's church services. During the [[altar call]], Jimmy offers Jerry Lee one more chance to become saved and get right with God, but Jerry Lee again refuses, declaring, \"If I'm going to hell, I'm going there playing the piano!\" The caption preceding the closing credits reads, \"Jerry Lee Lewis is playing his heart out somewhere in America tonight.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Myra Gale Brown]]\n* [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] as J.

Despite this, co-writer Silver was upset by the lack of accuracy in the film, claiming it was \"phoney\".

It also captures, perhaps for the first time on film, something of the sexual aura of rock-and-roll at its birth.\" Yet, she added that anyone looking for a true sense of music history will be let down by the film.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=GREAT%20BALLS%20OF%20FIRE%20(MOVIE)&title2=&reviewer=CARYN%20JAMES&pdate=19890630&v_id= James, Caryn].
