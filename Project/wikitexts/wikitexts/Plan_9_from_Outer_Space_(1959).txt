It went into general release on July 22, 1959, in Texas and several other southern states re-titled ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'', before being sold to television in 1961.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe film stars [[Gregory Walcott]], Mona McKinnon, [[Tor Johnson]], and \"Vampira\" ([[Maila Nurmi]]) and is narrated by [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]]. It also posthumously bills [[Bela Lugosi]] (silent footage of the actor had been shot by Wood for another, unfinished film prior to Lugosi's death in August 1956, and was inserted into ''Plan Nine'' later). Other guest-stars are Hollywood veterans [[Lyle Talbot]], who claimed that he never refused any acting job, and former cowboy star [[Tom Keene (actor)|Tom Keene]].\n\nThe film's storyline concerns [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s who seek to stop humanity from creating a [[doomsday weapon]] that could destroy the universe.<ref>[https://www.avclub.com/the-50-most-important-american-independent-movies-1842597128/slides/4 The 52 most important American independent movies |AV Club]</ref> The aliens implement \"Plan 9\", a scheme to resurrect the Earth's dead, referred to as \"[[ghoul]]s\". By causing chaos, the aliens hope the crisis will force humanity to listen to them; otherwise, the aliens will destroy mankind with armies of the undead. The film was originally developed under the title ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'', but in 1959 it was retitled ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' and re-released under that name.\n\n''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' played on television in relative obscurity from 1961 until 1980, when authors Harry Medved and [[Michael Medved]] dubbed it the \"[[List of films considered the worst#Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957)|worst film ever made]]\" in their book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]''.<ref name=\"LA Times 2011-10-15\">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/entertainment/tn-gnp-1016-space-story.html|title=Return to 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'|last=Thompson|first=L.|date=October 15, 2011|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 27, 2021}}</ref> Wood and his film were posthumously given two [[Golden Turkey Awards]] for Worst Director Ever and Worst Film Ever.

In [[Washington, D.C.]], the military fires missiles at more saucers. Chief of saucer operations Thomas Edwards says that the government has been covering up saucer attacks, and a small town has been annihilated.\n\nThe aliens return to their Space Station 7, and Commander Eros tells the alien ruler that he has been unsuccessful in contacting Earth's governments. Eros recommends \"Plan 9\", the resurrection of recently-deceased humans. Concerned about Paula's safety, Jeff urges her to stay with her mother but she refuses. That night, the undead old man breaks into the house and pursues Paula outside, where the female ghoul and Inspector Clay join him. Paula escapes, finally collapsing after the three ghoul return to Eros in the saucer.\n\nAt [[the Pentagon]], General Roberts tells Edwards that the aliens have been telling the government that they are trying to prevent humanity from destroying the universe. Roberts sends Edwards to [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]], where most of the alien activity has occurred.\n\nClay attacks Eros, nearly killing him.

He approves Eros's Plan 9 to raise armies of the dead to march on Earth's [[capital city|capitals]].\n\nEdwards and the police interview the Trents, unaware that the flying saucer has returned to the cemetery. Officer Kelton encounters the old man, who chases him to the Trents' house. Eros' ray strikes the old man, reducing him to a skeleton. Edwards, the Trents, and the police drive to the cemetery.\n\nLieutenant Harper insists on leaving Paula in the car; when she refuses to remain there by herself, Kelton stays. Eros and Tanna (his fellow female alien) send Clay to kidnap Paula and lure the other three humans to the saucer. Seeing its glow in the distance, Trent and the police head toward it. Clay knocks out Kelton.\n\nEros lets Trent and the police enter the saucer with pistols drawn.

The humans escape, and Tanna and the unconscious Eros take off.

Science fiction remained popular throughout the 1950s, though the genre had experienced significant changes in the [[post-war]] period. The [[Atomic Age]], heralded by the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], had inspired science fiction films to deal with the dangers of unrestricted science, while [[History of spaceflight|space flight]] and the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]] and civilizations (more \"traditional\" elements of the genre), seemed to hold a new fascination for audiences at the beginning of the [[Space Race]]. On the other hand, Gothic fiction enjoyed the height of its film popularity during the 1930s and 1940s. It was in decline by the 1950s and was viewed as old-fashioned. By 1950s standards, the combination of dated and modern elements gives the film a rather [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] quality.<ref name=\"Craig1\">Craig 2009, pp. 138\u2013177.</ref>\n\n''Plan 9''{{'}}s script seems to aim at being an [[epic film]], a genre typically requiring a big budget from a [[major film studio]]. That Ed Wood made it with minimal financial resources underscores one of the qualities of his work: His ideas tended to be too expensive to film, yet he tried to film them anyway. As Rob Craig argues, Wood's failed efforts give the film a peculiar charm. Craig finds that ''Plan 9'' has much in common with both [[epic theatre]] (\"grand melodrama on a minuscule budget\") and the [[Theatre of the Absurd]] (characters acting as buffoons, nonsense, and verbosity in dialogue, [[Dream art|dream-like]] and [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] imagery, hints of allegory, and a narrative structure where [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] is consistently undermined).<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n===The introduction and its origins===\nThe film opens with an introduction by Wood's friend, psychic [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]]: \"Greetings my friends! We are all interested in the future, For that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives!\". (This line appears in the narration for the [[General Motors]]' \"Futurama\" ride and its accompanying film, ''To New Horizons'', that were part of the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]\u2014years before Criswell's own television program.)<ref>{{Internet Archive|id=ToNewHor1940|name=To New Horizons by Handy (Jam) Organization}}</ref> At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now [[KCOP|KCOP-13]]) television series ''Criswell Predicts''. The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show (a ''Criswell Predicts'' title card appears at the start of the scene), but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early [[Televangelism|televangelists]]. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as \"my friends,\" as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line likely derives from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction, \"Future events such as these will affect you in the future\", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nAnother line asserts that the audience is interested in \"the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable,\" probably assuming that the film's audience will have a fascination with the paranormal. The narrator starts claiming that \"we\" (the filmmakers) are bringing to light the full story and evidence of fateful events, based on the \"secret testimony\" of the survivors. The narration seems to emulate the style of [[Sensationalism|sensational]] headlines in tabloid newspapers, and promises audiences access to \"lurid secrets\" as if following the example of ''[[True Confessions (magazine)|True Confessions]]'' and similar scandal magazines. The notion that a film or show could be based on true incidents and testimony would be familiar to a 1950s audience, because it was used in contemporary [[police procedural]]s such as ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nChanging the tone, Criswell delivers the sermon-like lines: \"Let us punish the guilty! Let us reward the innocent!\" which again sounds like a preacher addressing his congregation. The introduction concludes with the dramatic question: \"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about graverobbers from outer space?\". The latter phrase was simply the original title of the film, but the rest of the line again seems to emulate the sensationalist press.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe film's [[postscript]], also narrated by Criswell and delivered in an identical tone to the film's introduction, provides the audience with a challenge (\"...you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony. Can you prove it didn't happen\"?), a warning (\"Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment\"), and concluding wish (\"God help us...in the future\".)<ref>{{cite web |title=Criswell quotes |url=http://www.moviequotedb.com/movies/plan-9-from-outer-space/character_1864.html |website=Movie Quotes Database |publisher=Movie Quotes Database |access-date=2019-01-02 |archive-date=December 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201228100142/http://www.moviequotedb.com/movies/plan-9-from-outer-space/character_1864.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Government conspiracy===\nThrough Trent's initial conversation with his wife, the film introduces the notion of a government and military conspiracy to cover up information on [[List of reported UFO sightings|documented UFO sightings]]. This notion was clearly influenced by the emergence and increased popularity of a [[UFO conspiracy theory]].\n\nThe implications concerning the public's distrust of the government, however, were atypical for a 1950s American film. [[Anti-statism|Anti-statist]] ideas were to become more popular in the 1960s, which is when the subject became \"safe\" for mainstream cinema to explore.<ref name=\"Craig1\" /> In this area and perhaps others, the film was actually ahead of its time.\n\n===Message from the aliens===\nThe film contains a cautionary message from the aliens. The earliest use of this concept in film was probably in ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951), and it had since seen frequent use in science fiction films. The idea was that humanity's self-destructive behavior was the real threat, not any external source of danger.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n===Miscellaneous production details and special effects===\nThe \"iconic\" [[flying saucer]]s seen in the film have been variously identified as paper plates or hubcaps. However, according to the documentary ''Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, The Plan 9 Companion'' (1991), they were actually a recognizable plastic model kit, first issued in 1952 by toy manufacturer Paul Lindberg through his Lindberg Line model kit company: This was the first science fiction plastic model kit produced (product #517). Roughly matching the popular image of UFOs of the era, the saucer model was disk-shaped with a clear dome on top. Under the kit dome was a [[Little green men|little green alien]] pilot. This pilot figure was not used, however. The film's multiple flying saucers were painted all-over metallic silver, including the domes. Two slightly modified versions of the Lindberg kit are used in ''Plan 9''{{'}}s UFO scenes.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nFootage of [[Los Angeles]] is used to ground the otherworldly events in a realistic setting. As a resident, Wood was likely familiar with the shooting locations. The scene where the military fires at the flying saucers is actual military stock footage.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe Rev. Lynn Lemon, who plays an unnamed minister, was one of the [[Baptist]]s variously involved in the production of the film. J. Edward Reynolds was a leader of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], and Hugh Thomas was one of his associates from the church; both play gravediggers, while Reynolds was also the executive producer of the film. At the time of the film's creation, David De Mering was the personal secretary and alleged lover of fellow cast member [[Bunny Breckinridge]]; his inclusion in the cast was probably a result of this association.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />[[File:Quality Studios 2015.jpg|thumbnail|Quality Studios, where much of ''Plan 9'' was filmed, as it appeared decades later in 2015.]]\n\nHarry Thomas, the film's makeup man, was incensed when Wood refused to follow his suggestions regarding the appearance of the aliens in the film. Thomas had created some rubber chin appliances to elongate the actors' faces, as well as \"cat's eyes\" contact lenses and green wigs for them to wear, to lend them a more unearthly appearance. But Wood told him they did not have enough time for Thomas's suggestions, which led the makeup man to withdraw his name from the film's credits. \"I was really mad at Wood\" he said years later in interviews.<ref>Rudolph Grey, ''Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr.'' (1992). pg. 84. ISBN 978-0-922915-24-8.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Maila Nurmi]] (Vampira), she was recruited for $200 by [[Paul Marco]] to act as a vampire in the film. She recalled insisting that her part be silent, as she did not like the dialogue that Wood had written for her. This recollection might be inaccurate since the zombie undead of the film are generally mute. She contributed to the film a \"regal presence\" and theatrical mannerisms. Her performance is reminiscent of a [[silent film]] actress; she credited [[Theda Bara]] as her main influence.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe male alien Eros is apparently named after [[Eros]], the Greek god of love. Craig suggests that the female alien's name, Tanna, invokes the name of another Greek deity: [[Thanatos]], god of death.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe Pentagon office depicted includes a map of the United States with the sign of the [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad]]. The same map appears in ''Baghdad After Midnight'' (1954), which was also filmed at Quality Studios; it was probably an available Quality Studios background prop.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n===Bela Lugosi's last film===\n[[File:PlanNine 08.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Bela Lugosi]], in silent footage for the abandoned ''The Vampire's Tomb'', which was later recycled for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.]]\nShortly before Lugosi's death in August 1956, he had been working with Wood on a handful of half-realized projects, variously titled ''The Vampire's Tomb'' or ''The Ghoul Goes West''.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary 1981, pp. 266\u2013270.</ref> Some scenes connected to these projects had been shot. These scenes featured Lugosi weeping at a funeral, picking a rose from a bush in front of Tor Johnson's house during the daytime, walking in and out of the Johnson home's side door at nighttime, and finally a daylight scene, on a patch of highway, with Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself, then walking back the way he came. According to the documentary ''Flying Saucers : The \"Plan 9\" Companion'', these shots were all improvised. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood was forced to shelve the projects.<ref name=\"Peary\"/>\n\nShortly after Lugosi's death, the story and screenplay for ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' were written and finalized, with Wood planning to use the unconnected, unrelated Lugosi footage as a means of getting a known credit into the film. Wood also used the Lugosi footage as a means of attracting other actors to the picture, gaining the interest of Gregory Walcott and Maila Nurmi, among others, by telling them he was making \"Bela Lugosi's last movie\". Though Wood's actions were driven in part by the desire to give his film a \"star name\" and attract horror fans, he meant the Lugosi cameo as a loving farewell and tribute to the actor, who had become a close friend. Wood hired his wife's chiropractor Tom Mason as a stand-in for Lugosi, although Mason was taller than Lugosi and bore no resemblance to him,<ref name=\"Peary\"/> making Mason one of the earliest known \"[[fake Shemp]]s\".\n\nWood planned at first to make Lugosi the grandfather of Paula Trent, the film's lead female character, with Vampira being the revived corpse of Paula's grandmother, which explains why Lugosi returns to Paula's house after death, enters her bedroom, then follows her into the cemetery, and later winds up skeletonized on her backyard patio. Lugosi picks a rose at the beginning of the film from a bush in the front yard of the very same house where Paula and Jeff Trent live (Tor Johnson's house in real life), their patio being in the backyard, and the cemetery being next door. But Wood decided to cut Lugosi's character's importance down later on, making him unconnected to Paula Trent.<ref>Rudolph Grey, Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr. (1992). pg. 78. ISBN 978-0-922915-24-8.</ref> Narration from [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]] was employed in an attempt to somehow link the Lugosi footage to the rest of ''Plan 9'', but the Dracula cape he wears was always hard to explain. The theatrical cut of the film utilized every last scrap of material Wood had of Lugosi, including minor sprocket discolorations, and film trims that would in a normal film be discarded as unusable. Cuts of ''Plan 9'' on VHS during the '80s and '90s, the majority of which were unauthorized bootleg dupes, varied drastically in both quality and the amount of Lugosi footage retained.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nCoincidentally, further Lugosi footage that Wood had shot at an unspecified pre-1956 date was to have been the basis of a second, posthumous, feature film, ''Ghouls of the Moon'', for the horror legend. This footage had been shot on old, volatile [[nitrate film stock]], however, and had subsequently dissolved into a toxic-smelling sludge by the time Wood returned to use it in the summer of 1959. Therefore, ''Ghouls of the Moon'' was completely abandoned. Mystery surrounds the content and nature of the lost material, described only as \"wild\" by a friend of Wood's, who had watched the raw footage shortly after it was shot.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Release===\n''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' was shot in November 1956 and had a premiere on March 15, 1957 screening at the Carlton Theatre in [[Los Angeles]] (the onscreen title at this time was ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space''). Another year elapsed before [[Distributors Corporation of America]] (DCA) picked up the film.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?companies=co0021899 With Distributors Corporation of America (DCA) (Sorted by Popularity Ascending)-IMDb]</ref> The company folded, however, and it was not released again until July 22, 1959, through DCA's receiver, Valiant Pictures. By then, the film had been retitled ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.  The original title is mentioned however at the end of Criswell's opening narration when he asks the audience, \"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about ... grave robbers from outer space?\". It is thought that Wood may have changed the title himself because he did not want his backers to know that the film was being distributed in the South. (By 1959, the backers had completely given up all hope of seeing a return on their investment.) The new title, however, was less indicative of the film's content and may have contributed to its distribution problems.<ref name=\"Craig1\" /> Like many independent films of the period, ''Plan 9'' was distributed under a [[Film distribution#Pre-studio era|states' rights]] basis.\n\n''Plan 9'' was screened as part of a [[double feature]] at various times.<ref>\"Week's Attractions at the Neighborhood Movie Theaters.\" ''The Washington Post and Times-Herald'' (1954\u20131959) \u00aaWashington, D.C.), June 28, 1959, p.

''Plan 9'' was composed and shot for the 1.85:1 widescreen ratio, which by 1957 had become the common theatrical format alongside [[CinemaScope]]. As unskilled a filmmaker as he was, Ed Wood never intended for his film to be seen in a 1.33:1 open matte aspect ratio. This has led to various boom mics and edges of sets/props being seen at the top and bottom of the image, which have since come to be intrinsically associated with the viewing of this film. Further complicating the matter, Wood incorporated stock footage framed in 1.33:1 (including his own footage of [[Bela Lugosi]]), which becomes overly cropped when shown in widescreen.\n\n[[Turner Classic Movies]] has since presented a high-definition transfer of the film in the original 1.85:1 ratio.
