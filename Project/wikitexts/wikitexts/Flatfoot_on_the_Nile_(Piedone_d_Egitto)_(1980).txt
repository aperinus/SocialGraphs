Flatfoot, who arrives in the land of the pharaohs, discovers that the scientist is kidnapped because he has realized that a particular beetle is attracted by land oilfields and nests on them. Now that the criminals have in hand the research of the scientist, Flatfoot sets out in search of them ...\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bud Spencer]] as Insp.
