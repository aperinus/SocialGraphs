It is the sequel to ''[[Despicable Me 2]]'' (2013), the third main installment, and the fourth installment overall in the [[Despicable Me|''Despicable Me'' franchise]]. Directed by [[Pierre Coffin]] and [[Kyle Balda]], co-directed by production designer and character designer Eric Guillon, and written by [[Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio]], the film stars the voices of [[Steve Carell]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Trey Parker]], Coffin, [[Miranda Cosgrove]], [[Steve Coogan]], [[Jenny Slate]], [[Dana Gaier]], Nev Scharrel, and [[Julie Andrews]]. In the film, [[Gru (Despicable Me)|Gru]] teams up with his long-lost twin brother Dru to stop Balthazar Bratt, a former child actor of the 1980s, from destroying [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], after his show is canceled.\n\n''Despicable Me 3'' debuted at the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] on June 14, 2017, and was released in the United States on June 30.

Gru recovers the diamond as Bratt escapes. Displeased, Valerie Da Vinci, the newly appointed AVL director, dismisses Gru and Lucy from it.\n\nWhen Gru and Lucy return home, they tell their adopted daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes of their dismissal, but assure them they will soon have new jobs. When Gru refuses to return to being a supervillain, and his assistant [[Dr. Nefario]] is frozen in carbonite,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|[[Carbonite (Star Wars)|Carbonite]], a fictional substance from ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), is referenced in the film.<ref name=\"CarboniteSWReference\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/3/15914178/despicable-me-3-minions-star-wars|title=Despicable Me 3 includes a pretty sneaky reference to Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back|first=Julia|last=Alexander|date=July 3, 2017|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|access-date=May 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513213306/https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/3/15914178/despicable-me-3-minions-star-wars|archive-date=May 13, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>}} most of his [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]], led by Mel, abandon him to find new jobs but eventually land in jail.\n\nA butler named Fritz arrives at Gru's home with an invitation from Gru's long-lost twin Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia. The family travels to meet Dru, and are surprised by his immense wealth and massive mansion. Fritz attributes this success to their large pig farming business. Meanwhile, Bratt steals the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot that will destroy [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], as revenge for his show's cancellation. Dru reveals to Gru that their deceased father was a supervillain known as \"the Bald Terror\", whose villainous activities and technological advances are the real source of the family's wealth. Dru wants Gru to teach him how to become a villain, but Gru refuses to revert to his old ways. While Lucy struggles with her new tasks as a mother, Dru and Gru become closer, especially after joyriding in their father's high-tech vehicle.\n\nGru and Dru decide to steal the diamond; however, Gru secretly intends to bring it to the AVL to convince Da Vinci to rehire him and Lucy. They narrowly escape with the diamond and are rescued by Lucy. Dru, finding out Gru's true motives, is upset that Gru lied to him about teaching him how to be a villain. In return, Gru insults Dru's incompetence and declares he will leave Freedonia and end their relationship.\n\nBratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the girls, and once again acquires the diamond. Gru and Dru put aside their differences and pursue him after realizing the deception. With his robot powered by the diamond, Bratt terrorizes Hollywood, covering it in superpowered [[Chewing gum|bubble gum]] in hopes of lifting the city into outer space. Lucy rescues the girls as Bratt tries to kill Gru with the robot's laser. Dru breaks into the robot and power it down from the inside, nearly dying in the process. Gru engages Bratt in a dance fight before stealing his weaponized [[keytar]] to defeat him. The Minions, having escaped jail, reunite with Gru. Dru and Gru also reconcile.\n\nGru and Lucy are reinstated into the AVL. The newly united family celebrates in Gru's home, and Lucy bonds with the girls and acknowledges them as her daughters. Still wishing to be a supervillain, Dru, along with most of the Minions, steals Gru's rocket-powered aircraft and flies away. Gru and Lucy decide to give them a five-minute head-start before engaging in pursuit.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Steve Carell]] as [[Gru (Despicable Me)|Gru]], the spy and former supervillain turned Anti-Villain League agent, Margo, Edith, and Agnes' adoptive father, and Lucy's husband.<ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite magazine|last=Franich|first=Darren|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/13/trey-parker-despicable-me-3-villain|title=Trey Parker Will Voice The Villain In ''Despicable Me 3''|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 13, 2016|access-date=April 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415222851/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/13/trey-parker-despicable-me-3-villain|archive-date=April 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Carell also voices Dru, Gru's long-lost twin brother and the girls' adoptive uncle.<ref name=\"ew.com\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/despicable-me-3-trailer-gru-twin-brother-steve-carell-watch-1202043357/|title='Despicable Me 3' Trailer Reunites Gru With His Long-Lost Twin Brother|last=Calvario|first=Liz|date=2017-03-14|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=2017-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609101241/http://deadline.com/2017/03/despicable-me-3-trailer-gru-twin-brother-steve-carell-watch-1202043357/|archive-date=June 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Kristen Wiig]] as Lucy Wilde, an Anti-Villain League agent, Gru's wife and the girls' adoptive mother.<ref name=\"citizenoracle\">{{cite news|last1=Nequinto|first1=Denise|title='Despicable Me 3' 2017 Plot: Gru Experiences Sibling Rivalry, Faces New Villain|url=http://www.citizenoracle.com/2016/09/30/despicable-me-3-2017-plot-gru-experiences-sibling-rivalry-faces-new-villain/|access-date=9 October 2016|work=CitizenOracle|date=30 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010125828/http://www.citizenoracle.com/2016/09/30/despicable-me-3-2017-plot-gru-experiences-sibling-rivalry-faces-new-villain/|archive-date=October 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n*[[Trey Parker]] as Balthazar Bratt, a supervillain and former child star who grows up to become obsessed with the character he played in the 1980s and is bent on world domination.<ref name=\"ew.com\"/>\n*[[Pierre Coffin]] as Mel and the other [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]]<ref name=\"EWMeetNewMinion\">{{cite magazine|last1=Snetiker|first1=Marc|title=Despicable Me 3: Meet the mutinous new Minion|url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/05/19/despicable-me-3-new-minion/|access-date=May 22, 2017|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523021449/http://ew.com/movies/2017/05/19/despicable-me-3-new-minion/|archive-date=May 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n**Coffin also voices a museum director and does additional voices with Kyle Balda.<ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web|title=Despicable Me 3|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/59ba617202ba4|website=[[British Film Institute]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814170007/https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/59ba617202ba4|archive-date=August 14, 2020|access-date=December 28, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Miranda Cosgrove]] as Margo, Gru and Lucy's oldest and clever adopted daughter.<ref name=\"citizenoracle\"/>\n*[[Steve Coogan]] as Silas Ramsbottom, the director of the Anti-Villain League, who retires at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n**Coogan also voices Fritz, Dru's butler.<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n*[[Jenny Slate]] as Valerie Da Vinci, a tyrannical member of the Anti-Villain League who becomes the new AVL director.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Perez |first=Lexy |date=June 14, 2017 |title=''Despicable 3'': Meet the Voices Behind the Animated Characters |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/famous-cast-despicable-3-meet-voice-actors-1012594/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220818042947/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/famous-cast-despicable-3-meet-voice-actors-1012594/ |archive-date=August 18, 2022 |access-date=August 18, 2022 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n*[[Dana Gaier]] as Edith, Gru and Lucy's middle tomboyish adopted daughter.<ref name=\"CSCastAndTrailer\">{{cite web|last=Lesnick|first=Silas|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/trailers/792971-despicable-me-3-trailer#/slide/1|title=Gru is Back in the Despicable Me 3 Trailer!|work=[[ComingSoon.net]]|date=December 14, 2016|access-date=December 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215162146/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/trailers/792971-despicable-me-3-trailer#/slide/1|archive-date=December 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*Nev Scharrel as Agnes, Gru and Lucy's youngest innocent and immature adopted daughter.
