It stars [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Jack Black]], [[John Turturro]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] and [[Halley Feiffer]]. The film is about the familial storm that arises when Margot, a writer, comes to visit her sister Pauline on the eve of her wedding.\n\nThe film premiered on August 31, 2007 at the 34th [[Telluride Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on December 7, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nMargot is a successful but self-absorbed writer; it is suggested that she has [[borderline personality disorder]]. She brings her 11-year-old son Claude to spend a weekend visiting her free-spirited sister Pauline on the eve of her wedding to Malcolm at their home on Long Island, New York.\n\nMargot disapproves of Pauline's choice of fianc\u00e9: Malcolm is an unsuccessful musician whom Margot considers \"completely unattractive\". While in town, Margot will be interviewed in a local bookstore by Dick Koosman, a successful author with whom she is collaborating on a screenplay. Dick's teenage daughter Maisy also visits the house.\n\nMargot and Pauline have an uneasy relationship. Margot disapproves of her life-choices - besides marrying Malcolm, she is pregnant, a fact that she has not shared with Malcolm or her pre-teen daughter Ingrid. Pauline, meanwhile, resents Margot for writing and publishing thinly-disguised stories about her life. She is also incensed when she shares secrets told to her in confidence, including her pregnancy. Rather than confront each other, Pauline and Margot take out their frustrations on Malcolm and Claude, respectively.\n\nTensions come to a head twice. Margot's interview goes disastrously wrong when Dick's questions become personal. While Pauline interrogates him about emails he received from one of her 20-year-old students, Malcolm admits he kissed Maisy. Returning to the house, Pauline finds her inside. Alhough she says nothing, it is obvious to Maisy that Pauline knows the truth. When Dick finds out what happened, he chases and beats Malcolm.\n\nMargot and Pauline get into a heated argument, unleashing years of resentment. Following a climactic moment, the women leave with their children, leaving Malcolm behind. After the car runs off the road due to malfunctioning brakes, Pauline defecates in her skirt and removes her soiled underwear.\n\nThe next day, Pauline calls Malcolm, intent on breaking up with him. When he begs for forgiveness, she gives in and takes him back.\n\nMargot decides to stay with her sister and puts Claude on a bus to Vermont so he can live with his father. As the bus pulls away with him, she has a change of heart and chases after it. Taking a seat next to a surprised Claude, Margot catches her breath.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Margot\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Pauline\n* [[Jack Black]] as Malcolm\n* [[John Turturro]] as Jim\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Dick Koosman\n* [[Halley Feiffer]] as Maisy Koosman\n* Seth Barrish as Toby\n* Michael Cullen as Mr. Volger\n* Enid Graham as Mrs. Volger\n* Zane Pais as Claude\n* [[Flora Cross]] as Ingrid\n\n==Production==\nNoah Baumbach originally wanted to title the film ''Nicole at the Beach'', in reference to [[French New Wave]] director [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]]'s ''[[Pauline at the Beach]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |date=December 12, 2007 |title=Margot at the Wedding |url=https://www.kpbs.org/news/arts-culture/2007/12/12/margot-at-the-wedding |access-date=June 22, 2022 |website=KPBS Public Media |language=en}}</ref> The title was changed when Nicole Kidman was cast.<ref name=\":0\" /> During filming, Kidman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Zane Pais, and Jack Black lived in a house together in order to perfect the roles of a dysfunctional family.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |date=November 26, 2007 |title=Nicole Kidman digs deeply for \u2018Margot at the Wedding\u2019 |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2007/11/26/nicole-kidman-digs-deeply-for-margot-at-the-wedding/ |access-date=June 22, 2022 |website=[[Orange County Register]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOf her character Margot, Kidman said \u201cI hope you see that the spikiness and the guardedness and the anger is actually a manifestation of her need to protect herself.

''The Squid'' was a witty, affecting and painfully truthful account of two teenagers reacting to the separation of their parents, both writers living in New York, the father a pompous novelist whose once considerable career is in freefall, the mother a writer whose reputation is rapidly rising. ''Margot at the Wedding'', less sharply focused than its predecessor, explores similar territory in an equally allusive and indirect way.\"<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title= Margot at the Wedding|first=Philip|last=French|date=March 1, 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/02/comedy.drama|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\nTodd McCarthy of ''Variety'' wrote \"Kidman is the rawest as the most dangerously neurotic and manipulative of the bunch, Leigh the most prone to mood swings, while Black, whose character is not yet a family insider \u2014 more luck to him \u2014 works in a mode of emotional opaqueness that itself may mask the man\u2019s intense neuroses.
