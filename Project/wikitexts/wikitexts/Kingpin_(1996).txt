It was filmed in and around [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]],<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V19cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s1YNAAAAIBAJ&dq=sharon-stone%20pittsburgh&pg=1397%2C300980 \"City lands good share of movies\"].

In his professional bowling tour debut, he defeats established pro Ernie McCracken, who takes the loss poorly and seeks revenge. \n\nMcCracken convinces Roy to help him [[Hustling|hustle]] a group of local amateur bowlers. When they realize they were [[con artist|conned]], McCracken flees while Roy is brutally beaten and loses his hand when it is forced into the [[pinsetter|ball return]], ending his career. \n\n17 years later, Roy uses a [[prosthetic hand]] to display his championship ring and is living in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], an alcoholic, unsuccessful traveling salesman of bowling supplies. Always behind on his rent, he is constantly harassed by his landlady, Mrs. Dumars, eventually being reduced to trade sexual favors for a break on his back rent.\n\nOn a [[Direct selling|sales visit]] to a bowling alley, Roy meets Ishmael Boorg. Roy tries to convince him to turn pro, with him as manager. Ishmael declines, explaining he is from the local [[Amish]] community, that his bowling hobby must be kept secret from his family. Roy then sees a poster in a bowling magazine advertising a $1&nbsp;million winner-take-all tournament in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Learning that Ishmael's family is about to lose their farm to the bank, Roy eventually convinces them to let him join him, under the guise of going on a mission trip.\n\nRoy discovers that the childlike Ishmael is not aware of some of bowling's basic rules and skills. (His 270 average was because he was taught to bowl fifteen frames and not the standard ten.) However, after some coaching, Ishmael improves. \n\nThe duo earn money in various local tournaments and by hustling bowlers. Ishmael defeats wealthy bowling enthusiast Stanley Osmanski, but he attacks the duo after discovering that the roll of cash Roy put up was fake. As the group flee Osmanski's mansion, his girlfriend Claudia, who had also been a victim of Osmanski's violence, joins them. \n\nRoy suspects Claudia has [[Gold digger|ulterior motives]] and is distracting Ishmael. After Roy gets in a fistfight with her, Ishmael flees. During his absence, they drive on and end up back in Roy's hometown and at his abandoned childhood home, as his father died ten years earlier. Roy then confesses to Claudia he never returned out of shame for his failure as a pro bowler, not even for his father's funeral. They eventually call a truce, find Ishmael and continue on to Reno.\n\nIn Reno, they run into McCracken, who is now a national bowling superstar. He insults and makes fun of Roy and infuriates Ishmael, who attempts to punch McCracken but instead hits a wall and breaks his hand, leaving him unable to bowl. Later on, Claudia disappears with all of their money when Stanley finds her. Feeling distraught, Ishmael convinces Roy that they still have a chance to win $1 million if Roy bowls. \n\nRoy enters the tournament, rolling the ball with his prosthetic rubber hand. He rediscovers his touch, progresses through several rounds, and eventually ends up in the televised finals against McCracken. During the final match, Ishmael's brother arrives and takes him back to Pennsylvania. When Roy realizes he is alone, he struggles and McCracken wins the tournament by one pin.\n\nAfterwards, Roy returns to his Pennsylvania apartment and pours his liquor down the drain. He is visited by Claudia, who explains she had disappeared with Stanley in Reno to keep him from hurting Roy and Ishmael. She made Stanley believe she was running away with McCracken to give McCracken payback off-screen, and confesses her love for Roy, offering him the money Stanley earned from betting on McCracken in the finals. Roy responds that he is going to make $500,000 in an endorsement deal for [[Trojan Condoms]] based on his prosthetic rubber hand. \n\nRoy and Claudia visit Ishmael's family home, who'd told his parents about Ishmael's forbidden bowling career, but also about the moral strength and decency he showed during his travels. Roy tells them how Ishmael straightened out both of their lives, as Roy has finally given up drinking. The Boorg family's debts are paid off with his endorsement check, and Roy and Claudia kiss before driving away together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Roy Munson\n** [[Will Rothhaar]] as young Roy\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Ishmael Boorg\n* [[Vanessa Angel (English actress)|Vanessa Angel]] as Claudia\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Ernie \"Big Ern\" McCracken\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Mrs. Dumars\n* [[Rob Moran]] as Stanley Osmanski, Claudia's ex-boyfriend\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as the gambler\n* [[Chris Schenkel]] as himself\n* [[Morganna|Morganna, the Kissing Bandit]] as herself\n* P.
