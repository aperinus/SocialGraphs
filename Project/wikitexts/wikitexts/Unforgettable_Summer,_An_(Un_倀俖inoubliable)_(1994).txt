A [[Cinema of Romania|Romania]]n-[[Cinema of France|French]] co-production based on a chapter from a novel by [[Petru Dumitriu]], it stars [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born aristocrat Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Von Debretsy. Her marriage with [[Romanian Land Forces]] captain Petre Dumitriu brings her to [[Southern Dobruja]] (present-day northeastern [[Bulgaria]]), where they settle in 1925. There, she witnesses first-hand the violent clashes between, on one hand, the [[Greater Romania]]n administration, and, on the other, ''[[komitadji]]'' brigands of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] origin and [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarian]] locals. The film shows her failed attempt to rescue Bulgarians held hostage by the Romanian soldiers, and who are destined for execution. ''An Unforgettable Summer'' also stars [[Claudiu Bleon\u021b]] as Captain Dumitriu and [[Marcel Iure\u0219]] as Ipsilanti, a general whose unsuccessful attempt to seduce Von Debretsy and the resulting grudge he holds against the couple account for Dumitriu's reassignment.\n\nCompleted in the context of the [[Yugoslav wars]], the film constitutes an investigation into the consequences of [[xenophobia]] and state-sanctioned repression, as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out. It is thus often described as a verdict on the [[history of Romania]], as well as on problems facing the [[Balkans]] at large, and occasionally described as a warning that violence could also erupt in a purely Romanian context.\n\nReleased by MK2 Productions, ''An Unforgettable Summer'' was financed by the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Eurimages]] fund for continental cinema. In the [[United States]] and elsewhere, it was made available on [[limited release]]. Other actors credited in secondary roles include [[George Constantin]] as General Tchilibia, [[R\u0103zvan Vasilescu]] as Colonel Turtureanu, [[Olga Tudorache]] as Madame Vorvoreanu, [[Cornel Scripcaru]], [[Carmen Ungureanu]], [[Dorina Laz\u0103r]], [[Mihai Constantin]] and [[Ioan Gyuri Pascu]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's plot, which develops as a flashback narrated by Dumitriu's young son, opens with what American film magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called \"a mad gallop, with the camera in the saddle, giving viewers a crash course in regional rivalries circa 1925.\"<ref name=\"varieaus\"/> In the opening scenes, Romanian authorities are shown to be frantically engaged in shutting down a [[brothel]], whose presence they believe would embarrass local high society at a time when a grand ball is set to take place. The scandalized prostitutes include the Hungarian Erzsi, who is also a [[Communism|communist]] sympathizer, and who irritates the officials by shouting insults and [[mooning]] them through a window. During the latter scene, John Simon notes, Land Forces officers are shown staring up \"in mixed horror and admiration at the familiar globe whose owner they promptly identify.\"<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> As she is beaten up by the soldiers, Erzsi continues to defy her aggressors by shouting up revolutionary slogans coined under the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/>\n\nThe film then centers on the gala, which is attended by the Dumitrius and offers the setting for Von Debretsy's rejection of General Ipsilanti's advances.<ref name=\"varieaus\"/><ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> The characters' backgrounds are explained through the gossip of Madame Vorvoreanu, a distant relative of Von Debretsy, who is attending the event. The spectators are thus told that Von Debretsy is the daughter of a Romanian [[boyar]]ess and a member of the [[Nobility and royalty of the Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian aristocracy]], and that she is held in contempt by the local notabilities.<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> In parallel, Ipsilanti himself is shown to be not just a military commander, but also as a prince.<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/>\n\nFilm historian Anne J\u00e4ckel describes the story as dealing with \"the slow descent into Hell of two honest, liberal people.\"<ref name=\"aj105\">J\u00e4ckel, p.105</ref> The two persons are the short and [[monocle]]d Captain Dumitriu and his sophisticated wife. Confronted with the general's spiteful decision, they find themselves isolated to a garrison in a land frequently raided by [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] ''[[komitadji]]'', in rebellion against Romanian rule.<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/><ref name=\"aj105\"/><ref name=\"ainytrod\"/><ref name=\"sslp22\">{{in lang|ro}} Silvana Silvestri,{{cite web|url=http://www.revista22.ro/-a-privi-raul-in-fata-1072.html |title=\"Noile h\u0103r\u0163i ale infernului\" (interview with Lucian Pintilie) |access-date=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605194219/http://www.revista22.ro/-a-privi-raul-in-fata-1072.html |archive-date=2011-06-05 }} , in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 753, August 2004 ([{{cite web|url=http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art%3D1072%26nr%3D2004-08-11 |title=:: Revista 22 - Saptamanal independent de analiza politica si actualitate culturala |access-date=2008-05-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603213622/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=1072&nr=2004-08-11 |archive-date=2008-06-03 }} Original).</ref> Initially shocked by the cultural clash, Von Debretsy, a mother of three, attempts to adapt her aristocratic lifestyle to the new requirements, but manages to make herself stand out when she continues to seek a life of luxury.<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/><ref name=\"aj105\"/><ref name=\"jbunfor\">[[James Berardinelli]], [http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/u/unforget_sum.html \"Film Review: ''An Unforgettable Summer''\"], at [http://www.reelviews.net/ ''Reelviews'']; retrieved May 25, 2008</ref> French critic Sylvie Rollet argues that this attempt to \"tame the world\" by erecting \"frontiers\" is a central aspect of ''An Unforgettable Summer''.<ref name=\"aj105\"/>\n\nWhile Petre Dumitriu is motivated by his pursuit of discipline, his wife preserves her sophistication, reading the works of [[Marcel Proust]], playing the [[harpsichord]], employing a [[nanny]] to educate her children, and comparing the surrounding landscape with [[Japan]]'s [[Mount Fuji]].<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/><ref name=\"cjnytright\"/> ''Variety'' calls her \"sensitive-yet-flamboyant in the mold of [[Zelda Fitzgerald]]\".<ref name=\"varieaus\"/> To her husband's assurance that they were not going to spend long in Southern Dobruja, she replies: \"I like it here.\"<ref name=\"cjnytright\"/> In pursuing this path, she only manages to widen the gap between her and most other characters.<ref name=\"cjnytright\"/> This rift is made apparent by a number of [[omen]]s: unknown attackers throw rocks into the Dumitrius' house, while the vegetables she planted in the garden prove unpalatable. Confronted with these signs, Von Debretsy still attempts to make the best of the situation; [[online]] film critic [[James Berardinelli]] notes: \"[She] does her best to make a happy home for her family, despite stray bullets that shatter mirrors.\"<ref name=\"jbunfor\"/> Bulgarian locals, taken as [[hostage]]s by the military, are made to work on the garden. Their labor brings immediate improvement to the crop, and, upset by their condition, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se decides to pay them out of her own pocket, serves them tea and eventually befriends them. In a scene that provided the original title for Petru Dumitriu's book chapter (\"The Salad\"), she invites Ipsilanti and other officers to dinner, and they are all shown to be enjoying the salad provided by Bulgarian labor. However, the episode also renews tensions between Ipsilanti and his Hungarian host, when she expresses her appreciation of her servants' work and attempts to intervene on their behalf.<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/>\n\nAs a result of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute a number of his Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's superiors. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an [[extrajudicial killing]].<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is a result of this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, but is ultimately unable to do so and begins to weep uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive.<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is nearly stoned by the Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.<ref name=\"aj105\"/>\n\n==Production==\nTogether with its predecessor ''[[Balan\u021ba]]'', which is sometimes seen as Pintilie's greatest success,<ref name=\"dtvara\">{{in lang|ro}} Doinel Tronaru, [http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/181/Doinel-Tronaru/O-vara-de-neuitat.html \"Cronici.

It is also connected with the end of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Communist Yugoslavia]] and the onset of the [[Yugoslav wars]]: Lucian Pintilie once stated that he had been inspired by this outcome when filming on location,<ref name=\"aj105\"/> and continued to refer to it in later interviews.<ref name=\"sslp22\"/>\n\nAccording to J\u00e4ckel, ''An Unforgettable Summer'' has a prophetic role to play within the Balkan context, one she equates with that of [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[La Chinoise]]'', which is credited by others with having offered a glimpse into the French revolutionary environment that was to be responsible for the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 events]].<ref name=\"aj105\"/> Writing shortly after the film's release, John Simon specifically linked the plot with the [[Bosnian War|1992\u201395 civil war]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], proposing that \"it may even explain\" what had sparked this conflict;<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> likewise, American critic [[J.

J\u00e4ckel writes: \"Pintilie is convinced that nothing can change until fundamental questions are asked, and that it is only when a nation starts facing its past, that it can move into adulthood.\"<ref name=\"aj106\"/> She believes this focus on revisiting past events is also evident in other [[Cinema of Romania|Romanian cinema]] productions of the 1990s, in particular films by [[Radu Mih\u0103ileanu]].<ref name=\"aj106\"/> Caryn James argues that, through its references to the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and its impact in Romania, the film can serve as a guide to the start of communism, just as ''Balan\u021ba'' is a depiction of its outcome.<ref name=\"cjnytright\"/> Through the means of dialogues in the film, the viewer is informed that communism has had an actual impact on Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se: her father allowed the Hungarian revolutionaries to split up his estate, but, for all his generosity, was killed by them.<ref name=\"cjnytright\"/>\n\nTronaru also points out that ''An Unforgettable Summer'' stays true to Pintilie's condemnation of Romanian administrative tradition, with officials displaying \"an inveterate stupidity\",<ref name=\"dtvara\"/> while J. Hoberman, who emphasizes the Romanian administrators' brutality and describes them as \"[[operetta]] soldiers\", praises the film for undermining nostalgia for \"the Good All Days\".<ref name=\"jhobfinde\"/> In parallel, the remoteness of the Southern Dobrujan location and the clash of values have prompted Hoberman to compare the film with ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'', a 1948 [[Western (genre)|western]] by [[John Ford]].<ref name=\"jhobfinde\"/>\n\nLucian Pintilie himself notes that Dumitriu's book, authored during the [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] stage of communism, and before nationalism made a comeback with the rule of [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], is valid as a critique of [[Interwar period|interwar]] realities.<ref name=\"sslp22\"/> According to Doinel Tronaru, the book chapter on which the film was based was itself controversial, and seen by many as \"indigestible\".<ref name=\"dtvara\"/> Tronaru writes: \"the film was made during the bloody Yugoslav conflict, but Pintilie is telling us [Romanians] not to tune out believing we are somehow better, that, if need be, we could be just as bloodthirsty as our shunned neighbors.\"<ref name=\"dtvara\"/>\n\nPintilie indicates that his interest was in showing the violent intrusion of an \"oppressive mass\" of Romanians into a world peopled by Bulgarian peasants, describing the latter as \"natural cultivators of that land, with a special genius for vegetables\u2014innocent ones, without any political or national consciousness.\" A second area of interest was the Bulgarian government's manipulation of Macedonians living in the region, resulting in \"a lucrative bloody tension on the border\" and \"a political and historical crime that the Romanian and Bulgarian governments are building together.\"<ref name=\"sslp22\"/> Elsewhere, he had indicated: \"In ''An Unforgettable Summer'' the Bulgarian peasants have no consciousness of ethnic difference: they are executed simply because examples must be set.\"<ref name=\"ainytrod\"/> The Macedonian brigands are a mysterious presence throughout the film, and their actual ethnicity, unlike their loyalty to the Bulgarian state, is never specified.<ref name=\"cjnytright\"/> According to Simon, they are themselves multi-ethnic,<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> while Pintilie states that they include resettled [[Aromanians]].<ref name=\"sslp22\"/> This blurring of ethnic division lines is also present among Captain Dumitriu's hostages: one of them is shown to be a [[Turkish people|Turk]], and is unable to speak [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/>\n\nAlthough the film develops on these themes of oppression, both the narrator and Pintilie look back on the age of [[Greater Romania]] with a dose of nostalgia.<ref name=\"ainytrod\"/> Simon writes: \"What was the most horrible summer in the life of a young mother, driving her to drink and wasting away, was for her small son the most unforgettably lovely season of his life.\"<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> ''Variety'' argues: \"The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance, as the narrator's final remarks reframe all that has gone before in a different, deeply ironic light.\"<ref name=\"varieaus\"/> Discussing this aspect, Pintilie stated: \"Maybe I'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film.\"<ref name=\"ainytrod\"/>\n\nIn a 1994 interview, Lucian Pintilie expanded on the issues central to the film by drawing a parallel with his own childhood in a multi-ethnic part of [[Bessarabia]]. He noted that, before [[World War II]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa]], when [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] troops began rounding up and executing members of various communities, the region did not experience \"racial tension\".<ref name=\"ainytrod\"/> Despite his fondness for the interwar period, the director added: \"I believe that an artist should not be a hostage to his own political convictions. If the Romanians are shown as intolerant, at least once, it has to be discussed. Each person, in this ethnic madness, must clean his own doorstep.\"<ref name=\"ainytrod\"/>\n\n==Impact and legacy==\nAlthough available only on [[limited release]] in many parts of the Western world,<ref name=\"jbunfor\"/> Lucian Pintilie's production has attracted significant interest abroad, and was granted a special reception at the [[Telluride Film Festival]].<ref name=\"ainytrod\"/> John Simon describes the film as \"witty, harrowing, wonderful\",<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> and, in one of his comparative essays on cinema traditions, lists it among the most notable European works of 1994 (alongside [[Yves Angelo]]'s ''[[Le Colonel Chabert (1994 film)|Colonel Chabert]]'' and [[Nanni Moretti]]'s ''[[Caro diario]]'').<ref>[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]], \"Movies: The Democratic Art?\", in J.

But Marie-Therese is, deliberately, the apolitical soul of the film, shifting the focus from politics to the humanity that transcends border disputes and ethnic loyalties. Ms. Scott-Thomas makes the film work because she shows Marie-Therese to be something other than a shallow woman playing Lady Bountiful. She is sincere, rather helpless and, finally, shaken with disillusionment. Neither pure heroine nor villain, by the end she is unable to escape the murderous impact of politics.\"<ref name=\"cjnytright\"/> ''Variety'' also commends [[R\u0103zvan Vasilescu]] for his performance in the role of Colonel Turtureanu, \"an opportunistic soldier who has no compunctions about anything the military life may require\", and comments favorably on the soundtrack composed by [[Anton \u0218uteu]] and on [[Paul Bortnovschi]]'s production design.<ref name=\"varieaus\"/>\n\nDiscussing Captain Dumitriu's suicide attempt, John Simon writes: \"It is visually stunning and emotionally shattering, but it may be a bit too theatrical. Still, with such writing, directing, and acting\u2014most prominently from Kristin Scott-Thomas and Claudiu Bleon\u021b as the Dumitrius, but also from the rest\u2014what is a small faux pas? This film resonates in the memory, insistently and inspiredly.\"<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> Simon also discusses the [[cinematography]], arguing that [[C\u0103lin Ghibu]]'s use of lighting manages to convey the \"almost unearthly beauty at sunset\", which helps viewers understand why Scott Thompson's character uses [[Mount Fuji]] as her preferred metaphor for the place.<ref name=\"jsnatrev\"/> Of this aspect, James notes: \"Like its heroine, the film's serene and beautiful appearance masks a powerful conscience.\"<ref name=\"cjnytright\"/>\n\nThe overall positive reception offered by the critics did not materialize in significant box-office success or international awards: ''An Unforgettable Summer'' unsuccessfully completed for the [[Palme d'Or]] during the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"varieaus\"/><ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2974/year/1994.html ''Un \u00e9t\u00e9 inoubliable''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822170751/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2974/year/1994.html |date=August 22, 2011 }}, at the [http://www.festival-cannes.com/en Cannes Festival official site]; retrieved August 30, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.icr-london.co.uk/docs/press/romanian-film-season.pdf ''Romanian Cinema: A Journey''], joint press release of the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] and Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re, London, October 18, 2007, p.2</ref> Of the film's implications and its reduced impact in Romania, Tronaru concludes: \"The ravages of nationalism are the same regardless of the communities involved [...]. Of course Pintilie's uncomfortable message was not accepted in its essence, the film registering only the success of reverence [towards the director].\"<ref name=\"dtvara\"/> Tronaru also notes that the film's high standard of quality was a peak in Pintilie's career, and that it was no longer reached by the director until 2001, when he released ''[[Dup\u0103-amiaza unui tor\u021bionar]]''.<ref name=\"dtvara\"/>\n\nSpeaking in 1994, Pintilie indicated that he was considering a [[sequel]] to the film, also based on Dumitriu's writings.
