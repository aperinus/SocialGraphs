The film stars [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Anne Bancroft]], along with [[Leslie Browne]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], and [[Tom Skerritt]]. The film was nominated for eleven [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture. The script is a [[fiction]]alized version of the real-life Brown family and the friendship between ballerinas [[Isabel Mirrow Brown]] (whose daughter, Leslie Browne, stars in the film) and [[Nora Kaye]].\n\n==Plot==\nDeeDee Rodgers ([[Shirley MacLaine]]) leaves the ballet company after becoming pregnant by Wayne ([[Tom Skerritt]]), another dancer in the company. They marry and later move to Oklahoma City to run a dance studio. Emma Jacklin ([[Anne Bancroft]]) stays with the company and eventually becomes a [[prima ballerina]] and well-known figure in the ballet community.\n\nWhile the company is on tour and performs a show in Oklahoma City, DeeDee and the family go to see the show and then have an after-party for the company at their home. The reunion stirs up old memories and things begin to unravel.\n\nAt the party, DeeDee's aspiring dancer/daughter, Emilia ([[Leslie Browne]]), who is also Emma's goddaughter, is invited to take class with the company the following day. After taking class with the company, Emilia is asked to join the company but she does not immediately accept the offer as she wants to think it over before making her final decision. DeeDee and Wayne decide that DeeDee should go to New York with Emilia, who is rather shy and does not make friends as easily as her younger sister. Meanwhile, their son, Ethan, gets a scholarship to the company's summer program while Wayne and their other daughter stay in Oklahoma City.\n\nOnce in New York, they rent several rooms in Carnegie Hall with Madame Dakharova, a ballet coach. Emilia soon starts a relationship with a Russian dancer in the company, Yuri ([[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]). DeeDee runs into the former conductor of the company and has an affair with him, which causes conflict between Emilia and DeeDee. Meanwhile, Emma argues with Arnold, the choreographer, about giving her a better role in his new ballet, which he refuses and leads Emma to suggest Emilia for the role instead. It is also revealed Emma has been seeing a married man, Carter. During rehearsal, Emilia has an argument with Arnold and storms out, going to a bar and getting drunk. She then shows up for the performance that night still drunk and Emma takes care of her, angering DeeDee. Emilia suffers when she sees Yuri getting involved with another dancer, Carolyn.\n\nEmma and DeeDee eventually enter into major conflict. DeeDee resents that Emma dotes on Emilia, when she has criticized DeeDee for choosing family life over her career while Emma chose not to have children. DeeDee accuses Emma of telling her to get pregnant and have Wayne's baby so Emma could play the lead in ''Anna Karenina'', which Emma later admits is true.\n\nEventually, misunderstandings are settled, with Emma and DeeDee working things out after a physical altercation. Emilia is announced as the star of the next season, and she and Yuri make up and agree to a professional partnership and nothing more. Deedee decides she is content with her life and the decision she made to leave professional ballet to have a family. Emma accepts that her performing days are numbered and she must embrace a different role within the company. DeeDee and Emma step onto the stage and reminisce together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as DeeDee Rodgers \u2013 a former ballerina with the company (based on [[Isabel Mirrow Brown|Isabel Mirrow]])\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Emma Jacklin \u2013 an aging prima ballerina (based on [[Nora Kaye]])\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Wayne Rodgers \u2013 a former dancer with the company, married to DeeDee (based on Kelly Brown)\n* [[Leslie Browne]] as Emilia Rodgers \u2013 a young ballerina beginning professional training and becoming a woman (based on herself) \n* [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] as Yuri Kopeikine \u2013 Emilia's playboy love interest \n* [[Martha Scott]] as Adelaide \u2013 a former dancer, now head of the company (based on [[Lucia Chase]])\n* [[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]] as Michael Cooke \u2013 the company artistic director (based on [[Jerome Robbins]])\n* [[Alexandra Danilova]] as Madame Dakharova \u2013 a ballet coach\n* [[Lisa Lucas]] as Janina Rodgers \u2013 sister of Emilia (based on Elizabeth Brown) \n* Philip Saunders as Ethan Rodgers \u2013 brother of Emilia who takes ballet himself (based on Ethan Brown) \n* [[Antoinette Sibley]] as Sevilla Haslam \u2013 a rival ballerina \n* [[Marshall Thompson]] as Carter \u2013 a married man Emma is dating\n* Starr Danias as Carolyn \u2013 a rival ballerina that Yuri leaves Emilia for \n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Joe \"Rosie\" Rosenberg \u2013 a married former conductor of the company with whom DeeDee has an affair \n* Daniel Levans as Arnold Berger \u2013 a headstrong choreographer with the company\n}}\n\nA number of actresses were offered the roles of Emma and DeeDee, including [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Grace Kelly]], and [[Doris Day]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crouse|first1=Richard|title=HOLLYWOOD GOES DANCING WITH THE STARS IN FOCUS|url=http://www.richardcrouse.ca/hollywood-goes-dancing-with-the-stars-in-focus-by-richard-crouse-metro-canada-published-december-03-2010/|website=RichardCrouse.ca|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nBancroft had no previous dance experience, while MacLaine had started her career as a dancer of ballet and other types. She appeared on Broadway performing in the musicals ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' and ''[[The Pajama Game]]''.\n\nThe title \"The Turning Point\" is a [[double entendre]], meaning a big change in a person's life and being on [[Pointe technique|pointe]].\n\nChoreography for the film was done by [[Alvin Ailey]] and [[George Balanchine]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Isabel Mirrow Brown]] and [[Nora Kaye]] were childhood friends. Their parents had immigrated from Russia around the same time and they lived in the same New York City brownstone building. Kaye was a few years older than Mirrow and encouraged her to train. Nora Kaye was in a relationship with [[Jerome Robbins]] in the early 1950s, but they never married, focusing on their careers instead. Robbins was also a known bisexual.<ref name=\"THE LIVES THEY LIVED\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/03/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-jerome-robbins-dancing-outside-the-box.html|last1=Kisselgoff|first1=Anna|title=THE LIVES THEY LIVED: Jerome Robbins; Dancing Outside the Box|website=The New York Times|date=January 3, 1999}}</ref>\n\nIsabel Mirrow danced with [[American Ballet Theatre]] from 1947 until 1953.<ref name=\"Tableau of History: Generations Link Arms at Ballet Theater Reunion\">{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Tableau of History: Generations Link Arms at Ballet Theater Reunion|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/28/arts/dance/28old.html|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=28 June 2017|date=2007-05-28}}</ref> Nora was with the company from its inception in 1939 until 1951, and later returned in a leadership role. Unlike in the film, Isabel did not get pregnant while she was with the company; however, during this time Isabel married fellow dancer Kelly Brown, who was widely sought after. [[Lucia Chase]] was the head of the company when Isabel and Nora were there.\n\nKaye continued to dance in New York with other companies and became a more prominent figure in the ballet world, while Isabel had stopped performing to marry and have children. Their first child, [[Leslie Browne]], born in 1957, was [[Nora Kaye]]'s goddaughter. Kaye went on to marry director [[Herbert Ross]] in 1959. The two couples were close friends, along with [[Arthur Laurents]]. Kelly Brown, Ross, Kaye, and Laurents all worked together in the Broadway musical ''[[I Can Get It for You Wholesale]]'' in 1962.<ref name=\"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\">{{cite web|title=I Can Get It for You Wholesale|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/i-can-get-it-for-you-wholesale-2773|website=IBDB|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref> In his autobiography, Laurents wrote that in the 1940s he had a sexual relationship with Nora Kaye.<ref name=\"Broadway: The Golden Years\">{{cite book|last1=Emmet Long|first1=Robert|title=Broadway: The Golden Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKxJiOAb6LAC&q=arthur+laurents+nora+kaye+relationship&pg=PA76|access-date=28 June 2017|isbn=9780826414625|date=2003-01-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, an opportunity to run a dance studio opened up, and Kelly Brown decided to move his family to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] (changed to Oklahoma City in the film). By this time he and his wife had aged out of performing. [[Isabel Mirrow Brown]] was not thrilled to leave her native New York for Arizona, and the move caused strain in their marriage. When their daughter Leslie auditioned and was accepted to train back in New York in the [[School of American Ballet]] (SAB), Isabel moved back to New York to watch over Leslie, who was still a teenager. The film depicts Isabel's experience entering back into the dance world after living in Phoenix and having four children (three in the film). In real life she eventually divorced Kelly Brown, who died in 1981 at age 52.<ref name=\"Kelly Brown, Actor and Dancer Was Soloist With Ballet Theater\">{{cite news|title=Kelly Brown, Actor and Dancer Was Soloist With Ballet Theater|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/21/obituaries/kelly-brown-actor-and-dancer-was-soloist-with-ballet-theater.html|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=28 June 2017|date=1981-03-21}}</ref>\n\nWhile in Arizona the Browns had kept in touch with their friends Nora and Herbert. Later in the mid 1970s, a script based on the Brown family was developed by Arthur Laurents. Ross directed the film and co-produced with his wife. Ross, Laurents, and Kaye never had children and took a special interest in [[Leslie Browne]] as she grew older.\n\nThe script was a fictionalized version of the Browns' life and the long friendship between Isabel and Nora. The fictional parts primarily concern the character Yuri, who was created as a love interest for Emilia. Originally, the ballerina [[Gelsey Kirkland]], who was at the height of her fame at the time and dating [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] (Yuri), was offered the role of Emilia.<ref name=\"From Pain and Emotional Turmoil, Gelsey Kirkland Lights Up the Ballet Stage Again\">{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Sally|title=From Pain and Emotional Turmoil, Gelsey Kirkland Lights Up the Ballet Stage Again|url=http://people.com/archive/from-pain-and-emotional-turmoil-gelsey-kirkland-lights-up-the-ballet-stage-again-vol-7-no-8/|website=People Magazine|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref> She rejected the role as she was dealing with substance abuse issues at the time and she \"wanted no part of Hollywood\". Ross then decided that [[Leslie Browne]], who was nineteen at the time, would be able to portray a fictionalized version of herself in the film. In real life, Leslie had just joined [[American Ballet Theatre|ABT]] in 1976 and was experiencing the same things she portrayed on screen. Leslie had added an \"e\" to her last name as her stage name to sound more feminine after being mistaken as a man in a playbill.\n\nThe script changed the family name from Brown to Rodgers, and all the first names except for their son Ethan Brown. The real-life Ethan Brown later became a soloist with [[American Ballet Theatre]], retiring from performing in 2004; he now teaches.<ref name=\"Ethan Brown's Retirement\">{{cite web|last1=Vaughan|first1=David|title=Ethan Brown's Retirement|url=http://archives.danceviewtimes.com/2004/summer/01/abtrj3.htm|website=Dance View Times|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref> In real life, the Browns had another son, Kelly Brown II, who danced as a child but did not train professionally like his siblings and later became a film producer. Their other daughter, Elizabeth Brown (born 1959), was also a dancer, unlike in the film, and was accepted into SAB a year after Leslie. Nora Kaye died of cancer in 1987 at age 67. After the film, Leslie Browne went on to become a principal dancer with [[American Ballet Theatre]] in New York City from 1986 until 1993 and now teaches ballet. Her mother Isabel continued to be associated with New York ballet and died in August 2014 at the age of 86.<ref name=\"An Interview with Leslie Browne,  Retired Principal Dancer, American Ballet Theatre\">{{cite web|last1=Snedeker|first1=Kate|title=An Interview with Leslie Browne, Retired Principal Dancer, American Ballet Theatre|url=http://www.criticaldance.com/interviews/2002/lesliebrowne020710.html|website=Critical Dance|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"An American Dance Dynasty\">{{cite web|title=An American Dance Dynasty|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/An+American+Dance+Dynasty.-a054783600|website=The Free Library|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nHerbert Ross later directed two more dance-themed films, ''[[Nijinsky (film)|Nijinsky]]'' (1980) and ''[[Dancers (film)|Dancers]]'' (1987), both of which also feature [[Leslie Browne]].\n\nArthur Laurents claimed an important subplot regarding Wayne's [[homosexuality]] in the original script was cut from the film by Herbert Ross and his wife.
