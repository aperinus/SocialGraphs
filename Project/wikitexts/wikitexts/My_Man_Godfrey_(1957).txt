Allyson played the role created by [[Carole Lombard]] in the original version, and Niven took on the role made famous by [[William Powell]].  Niven had played the role of Tommy Gray, Godfrey's former classmate, in a 1938 radio version.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot begins as a zany heiress uses and then takes pity on a man whom she believes to be homeless.

The family's new butler, however, harbors a secret: he is actually as wealthy as and, in fact, more well-born than they are.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[June Allyson]] as Irene [Bullock]\t \n*[[David Niven]] as Godfrey\t \n*[[Jessie Royce Landis]] as Angelica [Bullock]\t \n*[[Robert Keith (actor)|Robert Keith]] as Mr. [Alexander] Bullock\t \n*[[Eva Gabor]] as Francesca [Gray]\t \n*[[Jay Robinson]] as Vincent\t \n*[[Martha Hyer]] as Cordelia [Bullock]\t \n*[[Jeff Donnell]] as Molly\t \n*[[Herbert Anderson]] as Hubert\t \n*[[Eric Sinclair]] as Brent\t \n*[[Dabbs Greer]] as Lieutenant O'Connor\t \n*[[Fred Essler]] as Captain\t\n\n==Production==\nThe film was meant to mark the Hollywood debut of [[O.
