'Predestination'|website=[[TheWrap]]|date=14 May 2012 }}</ref> written and directed by [[The Spierig Brothers|Michael and Peter Spierig]]. The film stars [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Sarah Snook]], and [[Noah Taylor]], and is based on the 1959 short story \"&nbsp;[[All You Zombies|'\u2014All You Zombies\u2014']]&nbsp;\" by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn March 1975, an agent stops a bombing of a public building in New York City, but is caught in a gunfight, containing the bomb too late and suffering severe burns. Someone unseen helps him grasp his time-travel device, which he uses to retreat to his employer's facility. The agent considers his mission a failure because the \"Fizzle Bomber,\" the unidentified serial-bombing fugitive he confronted, remains at large and will carry out his bombing on another day, ultimately killing over ten thousand.\n\nThe agent recovers from his injuries, but facial reconstruction surgery and vocal cord damage have altered his face and voice. His superiors force his imminent retirement due to the dangers of the extensive time travel undertaken over the course of his career. His doctor diagnoses him with symptoms of psychosis and depression, but does not disclose this.\n\nThe agent is sent on his final mission. Working undercover as a bartender, he converses with a customer who writes [[confessional writing|true confession]] articles under the pen name \"The Unmarried Mother\". The reticent customer begins telling his own life story after much prompting.\n\nBorn female, the customer grew up as Jane in a [[Cleveland]] orphanage. Superior in intellect and physical strength but plain in appearance, Jane suffered as an unloved outcast and was never adopted. These qualities, however, led a man named Robertson to recruit her for SpaceCorp, a space flight organization seeking young women as [[R&R (military)|R&R]] companions for male astronauts. During Jane's aptitude testing, a physical examination revealed an undiscovered, disqualifying medical condition. Keeping this a secret, Robertson rejected Jane under a pretense while promising to re-enlist her.\n\nIn 1963, Jane fell in love with a man by a chance encounter, briefly finding happiness before the man deserted her one day. Robertson finally revealed to Jane that SpaceCorp was a front to recruit elite operatives with no family ties for a secret government agency, but Jane became disqualified again due to being pregnant by her lover. While performing a [[Caesarean section]], doctors discovered Jane was [[intersex]]. As a result of a forced [[hysterectomy]] due to birth complications, Jane underwent [[gender reassignment]] through an ordeal of extensive surgeries. Amidst all this, her baby was abducted by an unidentified man. Resenting her lover for ruining her life, Jane adopted the name of John and eventually moved to New York City.\n\nThe agent offers John the chance to take revenge on his lover scot-free, in return for John taking over the agent's job. The agent time travels with John to Cleveland in 1963, admitting that he works for Robertson's secret agency, the Temporal Bureau, which uses time travel to prevent crimes. Following instructions for finding Jane in the past, John unwittingly falls in love with his younger self and realizes that the agent set him up to become Jane's lover. Despite knowing that their love is doomed, John cannot bring himself to break off their relationship.\n\nDeviating from his mission, the agent illegally time travels to March 1975 to pursue the Fizzle Bomber once more. The Fizzle Bomber beats him in combat, leaving him to witness, and help, his earlier burned self. The agent expects to be punished by execution, but Robertson excuses him, dismissing the Bureau's protocols.\n\nContinuing his mission, the agent brings Jane's baby, born from her [[Autogamy|self-fertilization]] by John, back in time to the Cleveland orphanage in 1945. Thus, Jane, John, and their baby are the same person, a [[predestination paradox]]. The agent returns to 1963 and convinces John to leave Jane at the preordained time, inducting John into the Temporal Bureau and completing his mission. Robertson extols the importance of John's future role at the Bureau, as a unique operative with no ties to the past or future. The agent still regrets his failure to stop the Fizzle Bomber, but Robertson credits the Fizzle Bomber for motivating the Bureau's growth and success.\n\nThe agent chooses to retire to New York City in 1975 shortly before the March attack; arriving, he decommissions his time-travel device as planned, but the device remains operational. He also finds that Robertson gave him an exact location and time where the Fizzle Bomber will be found. There, he discovers that the Fizzle Bomber is his future self, who claims that his bombings averted greater death tolls in alternate futures. The Bomber also claims that Robertson set up this path for him. Vowing that he will not become the Bomber, the agent guns down his older self.\n\nJohn's surgical scars are shown on the agent's body, confirming that Jane, John, the agent, and the Fizzle Bomber are all the same person. Robertson knowingly orchestrated this agent's existence, responsible for both his own conception and death. On a tape recording left for John, the agent contemplates whether the future can be changed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Agent Doe (listed in film's end credits as \"The Barkeep\")\n* [[Sarah Snook]] as Jane/John (listed as \"The Unmarried Mother\")\n**Monique Heath as 10-year-old Jane\n**Olivia Sprague as 5-year-old Jane\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Mr. Robertson\n* [[Madeleine West]] as Mrs. Stapleton\n* Christopher Kirby as Agent Miles\n* [[Freya Stafford]] as Alice\n* [[Jim Knobeloch]] as Dr. Belfort\n* [[Christopher Stollery]] as The Interviewer\n* [[Tyler Coppin]] as Dr. Heinlein\n* Rob Jenkins as Mr. Jones\n* Ben Prendergast as Dr. Clarke\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{Anchor|Writing}}\nThe film is based on the 1959 short story ''\"[[All You Zombies|\u2014All You Zombies\u2014]]\"'' by [[Robert A.
