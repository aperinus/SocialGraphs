It stars [[Nick Nolte]], [[Nigel Havers]], [[Frank McRae]], and [[Gerry Lopez]] and is loosely based on the 1969 novel ''L'Adieu au Roi'' by [[Pierre Schoendoerffer]]. Longtime Milius collaborator [[Basil Poledouris]] composed the musical score.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring [[World War II]], American [[deserter]] Learoyd escapes a [[Japan]]ese firing squad. Hiding in the wilds of [[Borneo]], Learoyd is adopted by a head-hunting tribe of [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], who consider him divine because of his blue eyes. Before long, Learoyd is the reigning king of the Dayaks. When [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers approach him to rejoin the war against the Japanese, Learoyd resists.  When his own tribe is threatened by the invaders, Learoyd decides to fight for their rights and to protect their independence.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Learoyd\n* [[Nigel Havers]] as Captain Fairbourne\n* [[James Fox]] as Colonel Ferguson\n* Marilyn Tokuda as Yoo\n* [[Frank McRae]] as Sergeant Tenga\n* [[Aki Aleong]] as Colonel Mitamura\n* [[Marius Weyers]] as Sergeant Conklin\n* William Wise as Dynamite Dave\n* [[Gerry Lopez]] as Gwai\n* Elan Oberon as Vivienne\n* Choy Chang Wing as Lian\n* [[Richard Morgan (actor)|Richard Morgan]] as Stretch Lewis\n* [[John Bennett Perry]] as [[General Douglas MacArthur]]\n* Michael Nissman as General Sutherland\n* [[Wayne Pygram]] as Bren Armstrong\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Original novel===\n[[Pierre Schoendoerffer]] originally wrote the story as a film script. He then turned it into a novel, which was published in 1969 and became a best seller in France, selling over 300,000 copies in hardback. He made the lead character Irish because \"the Irish are mad and I like mad people.\"<ref name=\"pierre\">{{cite news|title=New Testament, uniform edition|last=McNay|first=Michael|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 September 1970|page= 8}}</ref>\n\n\"I was wanting to make a great symphonic book on life and death: on how a man can struggle until the very end, without hope and without reason, just to be alive, even though half dead., even though suffering terribly, because life is so powerful. But on the other hand I was wanting to show that if suddenly a man discovers that he is not fulfilling his dream, then he does not want to live anymore.\"<ref name=\"pierre\"/>\n\nThe story had some basis in historical fact - [[Tom Harrisson]]'s stay with the Dayaks during the Second World War was the inspiration for much of what happened in the novel along with the allied drop behind Japanese lines known as [[Operation Semut]].<ref name=\"la\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Rousseau |first1=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |title=Central Borneo: A Bibliography, Volume 38 Issue 5 of Special monograph |date=1988 |publisher=Sarawak Museum |page=135 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbwEAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe film was originally going to be made in 1972, directed by Schoendoerffer and produced by Robert Dorfman, starring [[Donald Sutherland]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sutherland Signs for 'King'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date= 1 October 1971| issn = 0458-3035 | oclc = 3638237 |page= f15}}</ref> However, it was not made. John Milius was interested in the themes of the book. In 1976, he said:\n{{blockquote|My greatest fantasy is to go off to some foreign land and become a legend of some sort, like ''[[The Man Who Would Be King]]'' or ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''. One of my favorite movies is ''[[Return to Paradise (1953 film)|Return to Paradise]]'', [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]]'s film with Gary Cooper. That film is my ultimate fantasy. ''Judge Roy Bean'' is very similar to it: the idea of a man going off to a primitive culture and becoming a legend and a god. As they say in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', \"Lording it over the monkeys.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Richard |date=July\u2013August 1976 |title=Stoked |journal=Film Comment |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=10\u201321}}</ref>}}\n\"I liked the story because it was such a wonderful Kiplingesque adventure tale,\" Milius later said. \"It was a theme I always respond to, a guy living free in the wild, and the world catching up to him. In many ways it's similar to ''Jeremiah Johnson''. I thought if I kept plugging away at it, sooner or later I'd get to do it.\"<ref name=\"anne\"/>\n \nMilius announced he would make the film in 1984.<ref>{{cite news|title=Milius Hopes to Profit From 'Red Dawn' Conflict |last=Vernon|first= Scott| agency =  United Press International | newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News |date=11 August 1984| location = ProQuest document # 1817498602|page= 19}}</ref> Milius described the film as his \"most ambitious work - something I've wanted to do for 15 years... It's a story that explores loyalties, concepts of freedom and justice. And contrasts a seemingly violent but also very innocent society with the most corrupt society of them all, the outside world.<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite news|title=OUTTAKES: THE SEQUEL MOB MENTALITY|last=Modderno|first =Craig|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= 21 June 1987|issn = 0458-3035 | oclc = 3638237 | page= K84}}</ref>\n\n\"I have always wanted to write this story,\" Milius added. \"Learoyd is a character who could have come out of one of those barbershop magazines of the '50s: 'I fought the (Japanese) with the headhunters in Borneo where I was king.' He's sitting on a throne with sloe-eyed beauties all around\u2014a mai tai in one hand, a Thompson submachine gun in the other. There is some sort of primitive appeal in that to all of us.

Leroyd was a slob in paradise. He was a deserter, troublemaker, a '30s labor organizer, the sort of loveable guy that had great ideals, much more than Nigel [Havers, who plays the botanist], who has all the refinement of culture and empire. He looks at this guy and realizes that he is a great man.\"<ref name=\"anne\"/>\n\n\"I would say it's a film about loyalty and trust, freedom and justice,\" said Nolte. \"And it compares a savage but innocent society to the outside world which is the most corrupt society of all.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=At the Movies: Dawn Steel got an offer she couldn't, you know, refuse New site for Oscar night From jailbird to jungle king for Nick Nolte|first=Lawrence|last= Van Gelder|newspaper= New York Times| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/movies/at-the-movies.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212205311/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/30/movies/at-the-movies.html |archive-date = 12 December 2013 | issn  =0362-4331 |oclc = 1645522 |date=30 October 1987|page= C8}}</ref>\n\n\"I'm a story teller,\" said Milius. \"I'm a modern technology version of the Borneo tribal storyteller who squats near the fire in the long house and tells his tale. We're all telling the same tale. It's about the struggle of people to survive and, more important, to be free. It's about the necessity of making moral choices - and their costs. But it seems more real when you see where it really happened - and the people it really happened to.  It's set in the 1940s and many people lost their freedom in the 1940s and were taking action and having adventures to get it back.

In a way - I don't know why - I guess this film is more heartfelt than anything I've done since ''[[Big Wednesday]]''... The producers - Al Ruddy and Andre Morgan - who are friends of mine now - were lied to by Orion executives. They did a very careful divide-and-conquer and turned us against each other.

There were endless arguments between Al and John, and between John and us over the cutting of the film. John ended up being mad at me for years, but we've become close friends again. In the end, the film just didn't play. Perhaps audiences weren't ready to see a white soldier become the king of an indigenous tribe in Borneo.
