Ben Cameron leads a heroic final charge at the [[Siege of Petersburg]], earning the nickname of \"the Little Colonel\", but he is also wounded and captured. He is then taken to a Union [[military hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nDuring his stay at the hospital, he is told that he will be hanged. Also at the hospital, he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben. When [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln is assassinated]] at [[Ford's Theatre]], his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him.

As a result, Elsie breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a [[freedman]] and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Uninterested, she rejects him, but Gus refuses to accept the rejection. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and [[Lynching|lynches]] him.\n\nLynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus's murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing [[interracial marriage|mixed-race marriages]]. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's [[Ku Klux Klan regalia and insignia|Klan regalia]], now considered a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]]. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them.

Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room. At first Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but he is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's own daughter that he wishes to marry (against her will). Undercover Klansman spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan gathered together, with Ben leading them, ride in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes and are intimidated into not voting.\n\nThe film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]]. The penultimate title is: \"Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more. But instead\u2014the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Birth of a Nation (1915) 2.jpg|thumb|George Siegmann, Ralph Lewis, Lillian Gish, and Henry B.

It's tempting to think of the film's influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode\u2014but it's even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. The movie's fabricated events shouldn't lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction. But they also shouldn't lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of ''Birth of a Nation'', even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. The worst thing about ''The Birth of a Nation'' is how good it is. The merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and, despite its disgusting content, also make it hard not to love. And it's that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable, the experience of the film more of a torment\u2014together with the acknowledgment that Griffith, whose short films for Biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema, yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred (which, still worse, he sincerely depicted as virtuous).<ref name=\"Brody\"/></blockquote>\n\nBrody also argued that Griffith unintentionally undercut his own thesis in the film, citing the scene before the Civil War when the Cameron family offers up lavish hospitality to the Stoneman family who travel past mile after mile of slaves working the cotton fields of South Carolina to reach the Cameron home. Brody maintained that a modern audience can see that the wealth of the Camerons comes from the slaves, forced to do back-breaking work picking the cotton. Likewise, Brody argued that the scene where people in South Carolina celebrate the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Bull Run]] by dancing around the \"eerie flare of a bonfire\" implies \"a dance of death\", foreshadowing the destruction of [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Sherman's March]] that was to come. In the same way, Brody wrote that the scene where the Klan dumps Gus's body off at the doorstep of Lynch is meant to have the audience cheering, but modern audiences find the scene \"obscene and horrifying\". Finally, Brody argued that the end of the film, where the Klan prevents defenseless African Americans from exercising their right to vote by pointing guns at them, today seems \"unjust and cruel\".<ref name=\"Brody\"/>\n\nIn an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', film critic [[Ty Burr]] deemed ''The Birth of a Nation'' the most influential film in history while criticizing its portrayal of black men as savage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/what-was-the-most-influential-film-in-history/513863/|title=What Was the Most Influential Film in History?|website=[[The Atlantic]]|date=March 2017|access-date=February 26, 2018}}</ref> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''Time'' wrote that Griffith \"established in the hundreds of one- and two-reelers he directed a cinematic textbook, a fully formed visual language, for the generations that followed.

The assassination of Lincoln marks the transition from war to Reconstruction, each of which periods has one of the two \"acts\" of the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boothiebarn.com/2013/06/15/the-assassination-in-the-birth-of-a-nation/|title=The Assassination in 'The Birth of a Nation'|last=|date=June 15, 2013|website=BoothieBarn|access-date=June 22, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715103923/https://boothiebarn.com/2013/06/15/the-assassination-in-the-birth-of-a-nation/|archive-date=July 15, 2017}}</ref> In including the assassination, the film also establishes to the audience that the plot of the movie has historical basis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/reel_new/films/list/0_68_9_123|title=Reel American History \u2013 Films \u2013 List|last=University|first=Library and Technology Services, Lehigh|website=digital.lib.lehigh.edu|access-date=June 22, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015004629/http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/reel_new/films/list/0_68_9_123|archive-date=October 15, 2015}}</ref> Franklin wrote the film's depiction of Reconstruction as a hellish time when black freedmen ran amok, raping and killing whites with impunity until the Klan stepped in is not supported by the facts.<ref name=Franklin>{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=John Hope|title=''The Birth of a Nation'': Propaganda as History|pages=417\u2013434|journal=[[Massachusetts Review]]|volume=20|number=3|jstor=25088973|date=Autumn 1979}}</ref>{{rp|427\u2013428}} Franklin wrote that most freed slaves continued to work for their former masters in Reconstruction for the want of a better alternative and, though relations between freedmen and their former masters were not friendly, very few freedmen sought revenge against the people who had enslaved them.<ref name=Franklin/>{{rp|427}}\n\nThe depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention, and the organized Klan continued activities as small groups of \"night riders\".<ref>West, Jerry Lee.

Building on [[Black Reconstruction in America|W. E. B. DuBois' work]], but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the African American and white Republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of [[suffrage]] to black men. In response, the Southern-dominated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated white militias had used extensive terrorism, intimidation and even assassinations to suppress African-American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War''.

Griffith introduced the use of dramatic close-ups, tracking shots, and other expressive camera movements; parallel action sequences, crosscutting, and other editing techniques\". He added that \"the fact that ''The Birth of a Nation'' remains respected and studied to this day\u2014despite its subject matter\u2014reveals its lasting importance.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die | editor1-first= Steven Jay | editor1-last= Schneider| year= 2014 | edition= 7th |publisher= [[Barron's Educational Series]] |location=Hauppauge, New York |isbn= 978-1844037339 |page= [http://www.barronsbooks.com/cat/1001movies_pg02.pdf 24-25] |oclc= 796279948| series= Quintessence Editions}}</ref>\n\nGriffith pioneered such camera techniques as close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands.<ref name=\"auto\"/> ''The Birth of a Nation'' also contained many new artistic techniques, such as color tinting for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Home media and restorations===\nFor many years, ''The Birth of a Nation'' was poorly represented in home media and restorations. This stemmed from several factors, one of which was the fact that Griffith and others had frequently reworked the film, leaving no definitive version. According to the silent film website ''Brenton Film'', many home media releases of the film consisted of \"poor quality DVDs with different edits, scores, running speeds and usually in ''definitely unoriginal'' black and white\".<ref name=\"Brenton Film\">{{cite web |url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/the-birth-of-a-nation-controversial-classic-gets-a-definitive-new-restoration |title=The Birth of a Nation: Controversial Classic Gets a Definitive New Restoration |work=Brenton Film |access-date=February 23, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225184025/http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/the-birth-of-a-nation-controversial-classic-gets-a-definitive-new-restoration |archive-date=February 25, 2016 |date=February 17, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest high-quality home versions was film preservationist [[David Shepard (film preservationist)|David Shepard]]'s 1992 transfer of a [[16 mm film|16mm]] print for [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] release via [[Image Entertainment]]. A short documentary, ''The Making of The Birth of a Nation'', newly produced and narrated by Shepard, was also included. Both were released on [[DVD]] by Image in 1998 and the United Kingdom's Eureka Entertainment in 2000.<ref name=\"Brenton Film\" />\n\nIn the UK, [[Photoplay Productions]] restored the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s [[35mm movie film|35mm]] print that was the source of Shepard's 16&nbsp;mm print, though they also augmented it with extra material from the [[British Film Institute]]. It was also given a full orchestral recording of the original Breil score. Though broadcast on [[Channel 4]] television and theatrically screened many times, Photoplay's 1993 version was never released on home video.<ref name=\"Brenton Film\" />\n\nShepard's transfer and documentary were reissued in the US by [[Kino International (company)|Kino Video]] in 2002, this time in a 2-DVD set with added extras on the second disc. These included several Civil War shorts also directed by D. W. Griffith.<ref name=\"Brenton Film\" /> In 2011, Kino prepared a HD transfer of a 35&nbsp;mm negative from the Paul Killiam Collection. They added some material from the [[Library of Congress]] and gave it a new compilation score. This version was released on [[Blu-ray]] by Kino in the US, Eureka in the UK (as part of their \"[[Masters of Cinema]]\" collection) and Divisa Home Video in Spain.<ref name=\"Brenton Film\" />\n\nIn 2015, the year of the film's centenary, [[Photoplay Productions]]' [[Patrick Stanbury]], in conjunction with the [[British Film Institute]], carried out the first full restoration. It mostly used new [[4K resolution|4K]] scans of the LoC's original camera negative, along with other early generation material. It, too, was given the original Breil score and featured the film's original tinting for the first time since its 1915 release. The restoration was released on a 2-Blu-ray set in the UK and US by the BFI and [[Twilight Time (home video label)|Twilight Time]], alongside a host of extras, including many other newly restored Civil War-related films from the period.<ref name=\"Brenton Film\" />\n\n===In popular culture===\n* ''The Birth of a Nation''{{'s}} reverent depiction of the Klan was lampooned in [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974).<ref name=mel/>\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]]'s character Leo Harrigan in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[Nickelodeon (film)|Nickelodeon]]'' (1976) attends the premiere of ''The Birth of a Nation'' and realizes that it will change the course of American cinema.<ref name=mel>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/07/why-birth-of-a-nation-is-still-the-most-controversial-movie-ever/|title=Why 'Birth of a Nation' is still the most racist movie ever|first=Lou|last=Lumenick|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=February 7, 2015|access-date=February 26, 2018}}</ref>\n* Clips from Griffith's film are shown in\n**[[Robert Zemeckis]]'s ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), where the footage is meant to portray the [[Forrest Gump (character)|titular character]]'s ancestor and namesake [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2011/02/17/barbour_birth_nation/|title=Still lying about history|first1=Nancy|last1=Isenberg|first2=Andrew|last2=Burnstein|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=February 17, 2011|access-date=February 26, 2018}}</ref>\n** The closing montage of [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[Bamboozled]]'' (2000), along with other footage from demeaning portrayals of African Americans in early 20th century film<ref name=guardian/>\n** Lee's ''[[BlacKkKlansman]]'' (2018), where [[Harry Belafonte]]'s character Jerome Turner speaks about its role in the [[lynching of Jesse Washington]] as the modern Ku Kluk Klan led by [[Grand Wizard]] [[David Duke]] ([[Topher Grace]]) screens it as propaganda.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/review-blackkklansman-spike-lee-david-edelstein/|title=Review: Spike Lee's provocative 'BlacKkKlansman'|first1=David|last1=Edelstein|website=[[CBS News]]|date=August 11, 2018|access-date=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n* Director [[Kevin Willmott]]'s [[mockumentary]] ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'' (2004) portrays an imagined history where the Confederacy won the Civil War.
