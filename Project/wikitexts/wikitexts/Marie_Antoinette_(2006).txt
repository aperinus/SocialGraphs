It is based on the life of Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], played by [[Kirsten Dunst]], in the years leading up to the [[French Revolution]]. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]]. It was released in the United States on October 20, 2006, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]].\n\n==Plot==\nFourteen-year-old [[Marie Antoinette|Maria Antonia]], the youngest daughter of Empress [[Maria-Theresa]] of [[Habsburg monarchy|Austria]], is a beautiful, charming and na\u00efve archduchess. In 1770, she is sent by her mother to marry [[Louis XVI of France|Louis-Auguste]], the [[Dauphin of France]], to seal an alliance between the two rival countries. \n\nMaria, her name now changed to Marie Antoinette, travels to [[Kingdom of France|France]], relinquishing all connections with her home country, and meets King [[Louis XV of France]] and her future husband, the Dauphin. The betrothed young couple arrive at the [[Palace of Versailles]] and are married at once. They are encouraged to produce an heir to the throne as soon as possible, but the next day it is reported to the king that \"nothing happened\" on the wedding night.\n\nAs time passes, Marie-Antoinette finds life at the court of Versailles stifling. Her husband's courtiers disdain her as a foreigner and blame her for not producing an heir, although the fault really lies with her husband, for the marriage remains unconsummated for an inordinate amount of time. The French court is rife with gossip, and Marie-Antoinette consistently ruffles feathers by defying its ritualistic formality. She instead spends much of her time with the few friends she has in Versailles, including the conservative [[Princesse de Lamballe]] and the flamboyant [[Duchess of Polignac]].\n\nMarie-Antoinette also refuses to meet or speak with [[Madame du Barry]], the mistress of Louis XV. Over the years, Maria-Theresa continues to write to her daughter, giving advice on how to impress and seduce the Dauphin. Marie's attempts to consummate her marriage with her husband fail and they remain childless. Marie spends most of her time buying extravagant clothes and gambling. \n\nAfter a masquerade ball, Marie and Louis return to find the king dying of [[smallpox]]; he orders du Barry to leave Versailles. After the king's death, Marie-Antoinette's husband succeeds him as Louis XVI at the age of 19, and Marie-Antoinette becomes queen consort at age 18.\n\nMarie-Antoinette's brother, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], comes to visit, counseling her against her constant parties, advice that she finds easy to ignore. Joseph meets Louis XVI at the Royal Zoo and explains to him the \"mechanics\" of sexual intercourse in terms of \"key-making\", as one of the king's favorite hobbies is [[locksmith]]ing. Thereafter, Louis and Marie Antoinette have sex for the first time, and in 1778, Marie Antoinette gives birth to a daughter, [[Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France|Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]]. \n\nAs the child matures, Marie-Antoinette spends much of her time at the [[Petit Trianon]], a small chateau in the park of Versailles. It is also at this time that she begins an affair with [[Axel Fersen the Younger|Axel Fersen]]. As France's financial crisis worsens, food shortages and riots increase, her public image deteriorates and her luxurious lifestyle and seeming indifference to the struggles of the French people earned her the name \"Madame Deficit\".\n\nAs the queen matures, Marie Antoinette focuses less on her social life and more on her family and makes what she considers to be significant financial adjustments. Her mother dies in 1780, and the following year she gives birth to a son, Louis-Joseph, Dauphin of France. She gives birth to another son, [[Louis XVII of France|Louis-Charles]], in 1785, and another daughter, [[Sophie of France (1786-1787)|Sophie]], in 1786, who dies a month before her first birthday. \n\nAs the [[French Revolution]] erupts with the storming of the Bastille, the royal family resolves to stay in France, unlike most of the court. Rioting Parisians force them to leave Versailles for Paris. The film ends with the royal family's transfer to the [[Tuileries]]. The last image is Marie-Antoinette's bedroom at Versailles, destroyed by angry rioters.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Kirsten Dunst]] as [[Marie Antoinette]]\n*[[Jason Schwartzman]] as [[Louis XVI of France]]\n*[[Judy Davis]] as [[Anne d'Arpajon|Anne de Noailles, \"Countess of Noailles\"]]\n*[[Steve Coogan]] as [[Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau|Florimond Claude, Count of Mercy-Argenteau]]\n*[[Rip Torn]] as [[Louis XV of France]]\n*[[Rose Byrne]] as [[Yolande de Polastron|Yolande de Polastron, Duchess of Polignac]]\n*[[Asia Argento]] as [[Madame du Barry]] \n*[[Molly Shannon]] as [[Princess Victoire of France|Madame Victoire]] \n*[[Shirley Henderson]] as [[Princess Sophie of France|Madame Sophie]] \n*[[Danny Huston]] as [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]]\n*[[Marianne Faithfull]] as [[Maria Theresa|Empress Maria Theresa]]\n*[[Mary Nighy]] as [[Princess Marie Louise of Savoy|Princesse de Lamballe]]\n*[[Jamie Dornan]] as [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel von Fersen]]\n*[[Al Weaver]] as [[Charles X of France|Charles, Count of Artois]]\n*[[Sarah Adler]] as [[Maria Theresa of Savoy|Maria Theresa, Countess of Artois]]\n*[[Sebastian Armesto]] as [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence]]\n*[[Cl\u00e9mentine Poidatz]] as [[Marie Jos\u00e9phine of Savoy|Marie Jos\u00e9phine, Countess of Provence]]\n*[[C\u00e9line Sallette]] as Lady in Waiting\n*[[Aurore Cl\u00e9ment]] as the [[Louise Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Bourbon|Louise Marie, Duchess of Chartres]]\n*[[Guillaume Gallienne]] as [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Charles Gravier, Count of Vergennes]]\n*[[Jean-Christophe Bouvet]] as [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul|\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Choiseul]]\n*[[Tom Hardy]] as Raumont\n*[[James Lance]] as [[L\u00e9onard Auti\u00e9]]\n*[[Mathieu Amalric]] as Man at Masked Ball\n*[[Joseph Malerba]] as Queen's Guard\n*[[Andr\u00e9 Oumansky]] as [[Charles Antoine de La Roche-Aymon|Cardinal de La Roche Aymon]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was originally planned to be an adaptation of [[\u00c9velyne Lever]]'s ''Marie Antoinette: The Last Queen of France'', a biography she wrote for American readers in 2000.

Special features on the disc included a making-of featurette, two deleted scenes and a brief parody segment of ''[[MTV Cribs]]'', featuring Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI. No commentary was available for the DVD. In France, the double-disc edition included additional special features: Sofia Coppola's first short film, ''[[Lick the Star]]'', and a [[BBC]] documentary on Marie Antoinette. A collector's edition boxset, entitled \"Coffret Royal\", was also released in France, and included the double-disc edition of the movie, [[Antonia Fraser]]'s biography, photographs and a [[Hand fan|fan]]. The Japanese edition was released on July 19. This two-disc edition included the same extra features as the North American release, though it also included the American, European and Japanese theatrical trailers and Japanese TV spots. A limited-edition special Japanese boxed set contained the two disc DVD set, a jewellery box, a [[Swarovski]] high-heeled shoe brooch, a hand mirror, and a lace handkerchief.\n\n[[Pathe Films]] released a [[Blu-ray]] version of ''Marie Antoinette'' on January 4, 2012, alongside Coppola's first film ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]'' exclusively in France. It ports over the previously released bonus features along with the previously released short film and documentary from the French DVD. While it is a region-free disc, the English-language track contains forced subtitles and the [[BBC]] documentary is not English-friendly.\n\nA manufacture on demand Blu-ray was released through Sony's Choice Collection on October 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=19669|title=Sony Announces First Waves of MOD (Manufacture on Demand) Blu-ray Releases|work=Blu-ray.com|first=Martin |last=Liebman|date=August 19, 2016|access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref> This release, along with other Choice Collection releases, was strongly criticised for being a BD-R disc, which means it is a burnt disc instead of pressed, these discs are essentially a [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] and a BD-R is more susceptible to damage and has a much shorter lifespan of about 10 years opposed to a pressed disc lasting for 100 years if properly cared for. Reviews were mixed of the Blu-ray video quality, with ''High Def Digest'' stating \"Everything carries the unfocused blur of non-HD video\".<ref>[https://bluray.highdefdigest.com/38523/marieantoinette.html Marie Antoinette]. High Def Digest. October 26, 2016.</ref>\n\nAnother Blu-ray of the film, unlike the first release that was sold online, was physically released by Mill Creek Entertainment on October 29, 2019 as part of a double feature set containing that and Kirsten Dunst's fellow film ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0422720}}\n* {{AllMovie title|315883}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1158195-marie_antoinette}}\n* {{AFI film|63934}}\n* [https://archive.today/20121130005210/http://community.livejournal.com/i_heart_sofia/141874.html Translated interview with Sofia Coppola]\n* [http://screenmusings.org/MarieAntoinette/index.htm Screencaps]\n\n{{Sofia Coppola}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s historical drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Japanese films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American historical drama films]]\n[[Category:American Zoetrope films]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about Marie Antoinette]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XV]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Madame du Barry]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language Japanese films]]\n[[Category:Films about the upper class]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sofia Coppola]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Dustin O'Halloran]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1760s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1770s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1780s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 18th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Austria]]\n[[Category:Films set in country houses]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Best Costume Design Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Sofia Coppola]]\n[[Category:French biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:French historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese historical drama films]]\n[[Category:Path\u00e9 films]]\n[[Category:Postmodern films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
