The film was produced by Carvey's fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumnus, [[Adam Sandler]], through his [[Happy Madison Productions|Happy Madison]] production company. It tells the story of a man who is trained to become a \"Master of Disguise\" by his grandfather when a master criminal kidnaps his parents.\n\nThe film grossed $43.4 million on a $16 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> It was panned by critics, has a 1% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/master_of_disguise/|title=The Master of Disguise|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=December 28, 2017}}</ref> and has appeared on several [[List of films considered the worst#The Master of Disguise (2002)|lists of the worst films ever made]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1979 [[Palermo, Italy]], Fabbrizio Disguisey, the latest in a long line of secret agents known as \"Masters of Disguise\", breaks up a smuggling ring run by the evil Devlin Bowman while disguised as [[Bo Derek]]. Not wanting his infant son Pistachio to receive the same dangerous future lifestyle as he and his lineage, Fabbrizio decides to keep his family's nature a secret.\n\nTwenty-three years later, Fabbrizio runs an Italian restaurant in an unnamed town in America with his wife and Pistachio. Released from prison three years earlier, Bowman and his henchmen kidnap Fabbrizio and his wife, forcing Fabbrizio to use his talents to steal legendary artifacts around the world to reestablish Bowman's smuggling ring. After Fabbrizio's disappearance, Pistachio is visited by his grandfather, who reveals Pistachio's heritage and begins training him.\n\nPistachio gets the basics down and his grandfather gets him an assistant, Jennifer Baker, who is a little confused about what the job entails. The two find one of Bowman's cigars in the alley where his parents were kidnapped which leads them to the [[Turtle Club]] where it was made and they learn of Bowman's scheme, as well as that he will be at an antiques fair the next day.\n\nPistachio and Jennifer go to the fair, with Pistachio disguised as an elderly woman. Bowman invites Jennifer to a party at his house. Pistachio goes to the party in disguise and distracts Bowman while Jennifer looks for clues.\n\nThat night, Pistachio and Jennifer look through the clues. Bowman's men kidnap Jennifer, so Pistachio talks to his grandfather via a crystal ball and comes up with a scheme to break into Bowman's lair to rescue Jennifer and his parents. They confront Bowman who has attached a mask of his own face to Fabbrizio's head. While the real Bowman escapes, Pistachio fights his father, who is brainwashed to think he is Bowman.\n\nIn the end, Pistachio helps his father snap out of his trance, they free Pistachio's mother and return the artifacts. Pistachio marries Jennifer and becomes an official Master of Disguise. However, they eventually realize that Bowman still got away and has the [[United States Constitution]] with him. The Disguiseys locate Bowman in [[Costa Rica]], defeat him in their disguises, and retrieve the Constitution.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dana Carvey]] as Pistachio Disguisey, a man who follows in the footsteps of his family's legacy by becoming a \"Master of Disguise\".\n** [[Dylan and Cole Sprouse]] as young Pistachio Disguisey\n** Dane Morris as teenage Pistachio Disguisey\n* [[Brent Spiner]] as Devlin Bowman, a master criminal and enemy of the Disguisey family.\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Jennifer Baker, a woman who aids Pistachio in fighting Devlin.\n* [[Harold Gould]] as Grandpa Disguisey, the grandfather of Pistachio who trains him in becoming a \"Master of Disguise\".\n* [[James Brolin]] as Fabbrizio Disguisey, the father of Pistachio and expert \"Master of Disguise\".\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as \"Mama\" Disguisey, the mother of Pistachio.\n* [[Michael Bailey Smith]] as Bald Henchman, the unnamed bald-headed henchman of Devlin.\n* Vincent Riverside as Henchman, an unnamed henchman of Devlin.\n* Austin Wolff as Barney Baker, a young neighbor of the Disguisey family.\n* [[Jay Johnston]] as Rex\n* [[Maria Canals-Barrera|Maria Canals]] as Sophia\n* Mark Devine as Trent\n* Mark Ginther, Carrick O'Quinn, Mitch Silpa, and John Tenn as the rest of Devlin's henchmen.\n* [[Jonathan Loughran]] and [[Ted Rooney]] as Security Guards\n* [[Virginia Hawkins]] as Interview Woman\n* [[Erick Avari]] as Cigar Maker\n* [[Larry Cedar]] as Businessman\n* [[Vincent Castellanos]] as Art Dealer\n* Gabriel Pimentel as Boxing Dummy\n* [[Kevin Nealon]] as White Collar Executive\n* Gabriel Pimental as the unnamed man with dwarfism who operates the Boxing Dummy.\n* Andy Morrow, [[Naya Rivera]], and Julius Ritter as [[Captain America]] Kids\n* [[Leland Crooke]] as Appraiser\n* [[Lisa Foiles]] as Lisa (uncredited)\n}}\n\n===Appearing as themselves===\n* [[Kenan Thompson]]\n* [[Bo Derek]]\n* [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]]\n* [[Jessica Simpson]]\n* [[Jesse Ventura]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThere is a longstanding rumor that the filming of the scene in the Turtle Club took place on [[September 11, 2001]], causing production to stop and observe a moment of silence during the terrorist attacks.<ref name=\"Rabin911\">{{cite news |last1=Rabin |first1=Nathan |title=Exploiting the Archives: Close Readings #1: The Turtle Club Scene in Master of Disguise |url=https://www.nathanrabin.com/happy-place/2019/4/29/close-readings-1-the-turtle-club-scene-in-master-of-disguise |access-date=11 April 2022 |work=Nathan Rabin's Happy Place}}</ref> The rumor includes that Carvey was in the full turtle outfit and makeup during the solemn moment.
