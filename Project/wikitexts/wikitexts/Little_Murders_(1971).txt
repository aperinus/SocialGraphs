When she sees a defenseless man being attacked by street thugs, she intervenes, but is surprised when the passive victim doesn't even bother to thank her. She ends up attracted to the man, Alfred Chamberlain, a photographer, but finds that he is emotionally vacant, barely able to feel pain or pleasure. He permits muggers to beat him up until they get tired and go away.\n\nPatsy is accustomed to \"molding\" men. Alfred is different. When she brings him home to meet her parents and brother, he is almost non-verbal, except to tell her that he doesn't care for families. He learns that Patsy had another brother who was murdered for no known reason. Patsy's eccentric family is surprised when she announces their intention to wed, then amazed when their marriage ceremony conducted by the existential Rev. Dupas turns into a free-for-all. Determined to discover why her new husband is the way he is, Patsy sends Alfred to Chicago to visit his parents, who he left at 17 years of age, with a questionnaire about his childhood. He records the interview with his parents, in which they deny memory of his childhood.\n\nAlfred ultimately agrees to try to become Patsy's kind of man, the kind willing to \"fight back,\" professes he is able to feel emotions again, and that his first feeling is worship for Patsy. The instant that happens, a sniper's bullet kills Patsy, again for no apparent reason. A blood-splattered Alfred goes to her parents' apartment, New Yorkers barely noticing his state. He descends into a silent stupor, Patsy's father even having to feed him. A ranting, disturbed police detective, Lt. Miles Practice, drops by, almost unable to function due to the number of unsolved murders in the city. After he leaves, Alfred goes for a walk in the park. He returns with a rifle, which he doesn't know how to load. Patsy's father shows him how. Then the two of them, along with Patsy's brother, take turns shooting people down on the street. Upon believing Alfred to have shot Lt. Practice, their mood brightens, and all three men giddily join Patsy's mother, who appears horrified, for dinner at the table.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Alfred Chamberlain\n* [[Marcia Rodd]] as Patsy Newquist\n* [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Carol Newquist (reprising 1969 stage role)\n* [[Elizabeth Wilson]] as Marjorie Newquist (reprising 1969 stage role)\n* [[Jon Korkes]] as Kenny Newquist (reprising 1969 stage role)\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as Mr. Chamberlain\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Mrs. Chamberlain\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as the Rev.

Kennedy. \"Which was odd because I wasn't a big fan of his; he was the first actor in the White House,\" he said. \"And then when Oswald was shot, I thought there is a madness going on. And because of my politics, I saw that madness in Vietnam, too. So the motive of the play was the breakdown of all forms of authority\u2014religion, family, the police. Urban violence was always the metaphor in my mind for something more serious in the country.\"<ref name=\"Freedman\">{{Cite news|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G.|date=1987-05-03|title=Theater; Jules Feiffer's West Side Story |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/theater/theater-jules-feiffer-s-west-side-story.html|access-date=2020-09-11|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nFeiffer originally wrote it as a novel. \"Having gone to theater a lot and read plays a lot since adolescence, I realized that if I ever wrote the sort of play I wanted to write, it would close in a week.
