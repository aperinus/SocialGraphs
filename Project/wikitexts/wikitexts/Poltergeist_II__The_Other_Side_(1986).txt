Nelson]], [[Heather O'Rourke]], [[Oliver Robins]], [[Zelda Rubinstein]], [[Will Sampson]], [[Julian Beck]], and [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]]. The second entry in the [[Poltergeist (franchise)|''Poltergeist'' film series]] and a direct sequel to ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982), it follows the Freeling family who again finds themselves under attack from the supernatural forces led by \"the Beast\", revealed to be the spirit of an insane preacher who led an apocalyptic [[cult]] during the 19th century, attempting to claim their daughter. In their efforts to save their daughter, the family finds help in a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[shamanism|shaman]].\n\nFilming of ''Poltergeist II'' took place in California and Arizona in the spring of 1985. The majority of the original film's cast reprised their respective roles, with the exception of [[Dominique Dunne]], who was murdered shortly after the first film's release in 1982. Surrealist artist [[H. R. Giger]] designed the creatures featured in the film.\n\nReleased in the spring of 1986, ''Poltergeist II: The Other Side'' was a financial success, earning nearly $75 million worldwide. Critical reviews were mixed, but the film nevertheless followed its predecessor with a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], as well as two [[Saturn Awards]]. It is Heather O'Rourke's last film released during her lifetime. She died a year after completing what turned out to be her last film, the final entry in the ''Poltergeist'' trilogy, ''[[Poltergeist III]]'' which was released months after her death on June 10, 1988.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set one year after the events of the [[Poltergeist (1982 film)|first film]]. The Cuesta Verde neighborhood has been turned into an archaeological dig centered around the spot where the Freelings' home stood. The excavation leads to the discovery of a cave by a ground crew. Its existence is revealed to [[psychic]] Tangina Barrons, who informs her friend Taylor, a Native American [[shaman]]. After investigating the cave for himself, Taylor realizes that the spirit of Rev. Henry Kane, a deceased, insane preacher, whom he has seen in dreams is after Carol Anne and goes to defend her.\n\nThe Freeling family has relocated to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and now lives in a house with Diane's mother, Jess. Grandma Jess is highly [[clairvoyant]], and believes that Diane and Carol Anne possess the same abilities. Jess later dies from natural causes, but not before telling Diane one last time that she'll always \"be there\" if she needs her.\n\nTaylor shows up as Kane begins his first assault on the home. Unable to get in through the television as the family has removed all television sets from the home, Kane's minions are forced to find another way in, this time through Carol Anne's toy telephone. The attack fails, and the family gets out of the house quickly. Taylor introduces himself and convinces them that running would be a waste of time since Kane would only find them again, and they return to the house.\n\nKane shows up at the home one day in human form and demands to be let in, but Steve refuses. Taylor congratulates him for resisting Kane, then takes Steve to the desert and gives him the \"Power of Smoke\", a Native spirit that can repel Kane. Tangina shows up at the house and helps Diane to understand Kane's history and how he became the Beast that is now stalking the family. She also points out that Diane is unique in that she is one of the only people on earth who have been to the spirit world while living. Diane has visions of Kane in the mid-19th century when he was the head of an apocalyptic [[cult]]. Kane led his followers through the desert and into the cave, because he believed that the end of the world was coming, but then kept them trapped and captive there to slowly die with him after the day of his prediction came and went. Because he was so deranged and evil, Kane became a monster after death and controls the souls of his followers. Taylor warns the family that Kane is extremely clever and will try to tear them apart.\n\nWith Taylor having left, the family's morale drops. Steve lets his guard down and gets drunk, swallowing a [[Mezcal worm]] that is possessed by Kane, who then temporarily possesses him. The possessed Steve tries to rape Diane, who cries out that she loves him, weakening Kane's hold. Steve then vomits up the worm possessed by Kane, which grows into a huge, tentacled horror. In this form, Kane attacks Steve from the ceiling, but Steve uses the smoke spirit to send him away. The Beast launches another assault before the family flees. The Freelings decide to confront the Beast on his own turf, the Other Side.\n\nThe Freelings return to Cuesta Verde and, with Tangina, enter the cavern below their former home, where Kane pulls Diane and Carol Anne over into the Other Side. Steve and Robbie jump in after them through a fire started by Taylor. On the Other Side, which appears as a place of floating limbos without the sense of direction, Steve, Diane, Robbie, and Carol Anne unite, but the now monstrously transformed Kane grabs Carol Anne and begins to drain her life force, but she is saved after Taylor gets a charmed Native spear into Steve's hands, and he stabs Kane with it, defeating the monster. Carol Anne nearly crosses over into the afterlife, but Jess' spirit appears and returns her to the family. The Freelings then return safely and thank Taylor and Tangina.\n\nSteve gives the family car to Taylor after he had expressed affection for it previously, and Taylor drives away with Tangina. After the Freelings realize that they now have no ride home, they chase after Taylor.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Diane Freeling\n** Jaclyn Bernstein as Young Diane\n* [[Craig T.
