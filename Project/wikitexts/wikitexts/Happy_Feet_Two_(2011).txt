He and his best friends, Bodicea \"Bo\" and Atticus, follow one of Mumble's friends, Ram\u00f3n, leader of the Amigos, to [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin|Ad\u00e9lie]]-Land, which is now being ruled by flying penguin [[Confidence trick|con artist]] Sven. After surviving the loss of his native fishing grounds due to his \"miraculous\" flying ability, he partnered with another of Mumble's friends, Lovelace (who was fired from his job as \"Guru\"). They tell the others they were saved by humans but fled to Antarctica after believing they'd be eaten. There Sven performs his first miracles by revealing moss to the locals and using his power of \"Sven Think\" to help Ram\u00f3n find his prospective mate Carmen, who is uninterested. Mumble finds the kids and tells them to return to Emperor-Land, with encouragement from Sven.\n\nMeanwhile, Will, an adventurous and [[Existentialism|existentialist]] [[krill]], is determined to discover what lies beyond the swarm. His best friend, Bill, reluctantly follows to ensure his safety. Once separated from the swarm they realize that they're at the bottom of the food chain. Will attempts to \"move up the food chain\" by eating another creature while Bill believes he's going crazy. Mumble tells Erik he's unique and that he'll someday find his calling, but Erik is still enthralled with Sven. While trying to cross a perilous ice bridge, an [[elephant seal]], Bryan the Beach Master and his two sons, refuse to let the penguins pass. An argument results in Bryan falling off the bridge and getting trapped below. Mumble lures a [[leopard seal]] to chase him into the ice, freeing Bryan and earning his respect. Erik, however attributes the successful rescue to his attempt at using \"Sven Think\", dismaying Mumble.\n\nWhen the penguins return to Emperor-Land, they discover a large [[iceberg]] has trapped the emperor penguins in a deep pit surrounded by ice walls. While Mumble, Erik, and Atticus deliver their meager supply of fish to the stranded penguins, Bo returns to Ad\u00e9lie-Land for more help. When Erik tries to deliver fish by flying like Sven, he nearly tosses himself over the iceberg. Mumble saves him and says penguins cannot fly, hinting that their friends and family are doomed. Erik begins to panic until Gloria sends Mumble away to fish and sings to calm her son down. Meanwhile, Bill creates another swarm after spying a family of [[jellyfish]], but Will adheres to his new predator lifestyle. The next morning, a large flock of [[skua]] attack the trapped emperor penguins. Noah the Elder encourages them to fight the birds. When all seems lost, Bo returns with Ad\u00e9lie-Land, led by Sven. Sven orchestrates a cooperative effort to feed the trapped emperors through hunting and bringing back flows of fish from the sea. Still trying to be a predator, Will attacks a fish, that is later scooped up and carried by Sven into Emperor-Land.\n\nThe humans who saved Sven and Lovelace come to Antarctica again to help the penguins, but a blizzard causes them to flee. Erik urges Sven to teach the penguins how to fly, but Sven reveals he's not really a penguin, but a [[tufted puffin]]. Mumble, after watching snow fall into a crevice between chunks of iceberg, begins to tap-dance and leads the penguins in a dance, weakening the ice. The plan works until several chunks break loose, sending Bo, Atticus, and several penguins into the doomed crevice. Erik and Lovelace tumble towards the edge, and Mumble grabs the threads from Lovelace's vest. The threads snaps and causes Lovelace and Sven to tumble, but Erik is pulled to safety. Having injured his foot, Mumble can't lead the Ad\u00e9lies. Ram\u00f3n realizes Carmen is trapped below and jumps down to be with her, finally winning her love. Sven proves himself a worthy dancer and despite public outcry he leads the remaining Ad\u00e9lies in dance while Erik and Mumble head to the elephant seal beach to seek Bryan, to help in collapsing the ice. Meanwhile, a newly reformed Will reunites with Bill and their swarm. Bill reveals they are now legends after sharing their journey with the swarm.\n\nMumble and Erik arrive at Elephant Seal Beach where Bryan is in the middle of a dominance fight. Mumble pleads for help freeing the emperor penguins but Bryan declines because of his Beach Master duties. Using his singing abilities, Erik praises Mumble for his bravery and lectures Bryan for refusing to help after Mumble rescued him. The elephant seals travel en-masse to Emperor-Land. Mumble, Gloria, Erik, the other emperor penguins, the elephant seals, Will, Bill, their krill swarm, Ram\u00f3n, the Amigos, Carmen, Lovelace and the newly-reformed Sven work together to destroy the iceberg by slamming it to the beat of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[Under Pressure]]\". Finally, the iceberg crumbles, creating an uphill passage and the penguins are saved.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Robin Williams (6451555147).jpg|thumb|Robin Williams, who voiced Ramon and Lovelace, at the film's Australian premiere in Sydney]]\n* [[Ava Acres]] as Erik, only son of Gloria and Mumble and Memphis and Norma Jean's grandson.<ref name=TNYTReview>{{cite news|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Happy Feet Two - Review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/movies/happy-feet-two-with-brad-pitt-matt-damon-and-elijah-wood-review.html|access-date=October 13, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> (singing by [[E.
