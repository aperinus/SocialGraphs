Based on the [[Mister Roberts (novel)|1946 novel]] and [[Mister Roberts (play)|1948 Broadway play]], the film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound, Recording]] ([[William A. Mueller]]), with Jack Lemmon winning the award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].<ref name=\"Oscars1956\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn the waning days of [[World War II]], the [[United States Navy|U.S.]] cargo ship ''Reluctant'' (also called \u201cThe Bucket\u201d) and her crew are stationed in the \"backwater\" areas of the Pacific Ocean. The [[executive officer]]/cargo chief, [[Lieutenant (junior grade)]] Douglas A. \"Doug\" Roberts, shields the dispirited crew from the harsh and unpopular captain, [[Lieutenant Commander]] Morton. Eager to join the fighting, Roberts repeatedly requests a transfer. Morton is forced by regulation to forward his requests, but refuses to endorse them, resulting in their being rejected. Roberts shares quarters with [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Frank Thurlowe Pulver, the laundry and morale officer. Pulver spends most of his time idling in his bunk and avoiding the captain, so much so, that Morton is initially unaware that Pulver is a crew member. Once discovered, Pulver cowers before Morton despite bold (and never realized) ideas for revenge he expresses to the crew.\n\nRoberts surreptitiously requests and is granted crew [[Shore leave|liberty]] from one of Morton\u2019s superiors, a port captain who wishes to reward the ''Reluctant''{{'}}s crew for meeting a difficult resupply schedule. The liberty is supposed to be at their next resupply stop, but when the ship reaches an idyllic South Pacific island, Morton cancels the crew's much-needed shore leave. In private, Morton tells Roberts that the crew will be denied liberty as long as he continues to request a transfer and writes letters regarding disharmony aboard the ship, which is hurting Morton's promotion chances. Morton strikes a bargain with Roberts: In exchange for never requesting another transfer, never resisting Morton's rules, and never revealing why he changed his attitude, Morton will grant the crew liberty.\n\nAshore, the crew releases months of pent-up frustration, with many arrested and hauled back to the ship by the [[military police]] and the [[shore patrol]]. The next morning, Morton is reprimanded by the port captain and ordered to leave port immediately. Morton is livid at the black mark on his sterling record.\n\nMeanwhile, the crew is mystified by Roberts\u2019 new strictness and deference to the captain. Morton deceives them into believing Roberts is vying for a promotion. When a crew member informs Roberts of a new Navy policy which could help him receive a transfer despite the captain's opposition, Roberts declines.\n\nNews of the Allied victory in Europe depresses Roberts further, knowing the war may end soon without his ever seeing combat. Inspired by a patriotic radio speech celebrating [[VE Day]], Roberts tosses Morton's prized palm tree overboard. The captain demands the identity of the culprit, but no one steps forward. He eventually realizes it was likely Roberts and summons him to his quarters and accuses him of the deed. An open microphone allows the crew to overhear their heated conversation and why Roberts changed.\n\nWeeks later, Roberts receives an unexpected transfer. \"Doc,\" the ship's doctor and Roberts' friend, confides to him that the crew risked court-martial by submitting a transfer request with Morton's forged signature of approval. Before he leaves, the crew presents Roberts with a handmade medal, the Order of the Palm, for \"action against the enemy.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, Pulver, who has been appointed cargo officer, receives several letters. The first is from Roberts, who enthusiastically writes about his new assignment aboard the [[destroyer]] USS ''Livingston'' during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. He writes he would rather have the Order of the Palm than the Congressional [[Medal of Honor]]. The second letter is from Pulver's college friend who is also a junior naval officer assigned to the ''Livingston''. He reveals that Roberts was killed in a [[kamikaze]] attack shortly after the first letter had been posted.\n\nIncensed, Pulver throws the captain\u2019s replacement palm tree overboard, then marches into Morton's cabin, openly bragging that he is responsible. He brazenly demands to know why Morton has cancelled the showing of a film that night. Morton slowly shakes his head, realizing his problems have not gone away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Lieutenant (junior grade) Douglas A. \"Doug\" Roberts\n* [[James Cagney]] as Lieutenant Commander \"Captain\" Morton\n* [[William Powell]] as \"Doc\"\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Ensign Frank Thurlowe Pulver\n* [[Betsy Palmer]] as Lieutenant Ann Girard\n* [[Ward Bond]] as Chief Petty Officer Dowdy\n* [[Ken Curtis]] as Dolan\n* [[Philip Carey]] as Mannion (billed as Phil Carey)\n* [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]] as Reber\n* [[Perry Lopez]] as Rodrigues\n* Robert Roark as Insigna\n* [[Harry Carey Jr.]] as Stefanowski\n* [[Patrick Wayne]] as Bookser\n* [[Frank Aletter]] as Gerhart\n* [[Tige Andrews]] as Wiley\n* [[Martin Milner]] as Shore Patrol Officer\n* [[Harry Tenbrook]] as Cookie \n* [[Kathleen O'Malley]] as Nurse\n* [[Gregory Walcott]] as Shore Patrolman\n* [[James Flavin]] as Military Policeman\n* [[Jack Pennick]] as Marine Sergeant\n* [[Duke Kahanamoku]] as Native Chief\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFonda was not the original choice to star in the film version; [[Warner Bros.]] was considering [[William Holden]] or [[Marlon Brando]] for the role. The studio thought Fonda had been on stage and off the screen so long (eight years) that he was no longer a box office draw. In addition, when filming began he was 49, much older than the average lieutenant junior grade. Fonda was hired only because director [[John Ford]] insisted.\n\nThe movie was directed by [[John Ford]], [[Mervyn LeRoy]] and [[Joshua Logan]], who was uncredited. While directing the film, Ford had personality conflicts with Fonda and Cagney.<ref>{{cite book |last=Warren |first=Doug |author2=Cagney, James |title= Cagney: The Authorized Biography |orig-year= 1983 |edition=Mass Market |year= 1986 |publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]] |location= New York |isbn= 0-312-90207-7}}</ref> When Ford met Cagney at the airport, the director warned that they would \"tangle asses,\" which caught Cagney by surprise. Cagney later said, \"I would have kicked his brains out. He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man.\"<ref name=\"Warren191\">Warren, page 191</ref> The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, and Ford became incensed. Cagney cut short the imminent tirade, saying, \"When I started this picture, you said that we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm ready now \u2013 are you?\" Ford backed down and walked away, and he and Cagney had no further conflicts on the set.<ref name=\"Warren191\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Ford was replaced by LeRoy after difficulties with Fonda (Ford apparently punched Fonda in the jaw during a heated argument), and a gall bladder attack that necessitated emergency surgery. It has been widely speculated which scenes were directed by LeRoy. Jack Lemmon shed some light on this issue in his DVD commentary: \"Mervyn LeRoy would watch all of the rushes that Ford had shot prior to his temporary departure and decided to shoot them the way John Ford would have shot 'em.\" Logan, who had directed the original stage production in which Fonda starred, re-shot major portions of the film, at Fonda's request.\n\nThe DVD release of this film includes an audio commentary by Lemmon in which he recounts stories of his experience making the film and his views on acting. During the production of the film, Lemmon began a long-term friendship with Cagney which continued until Cagney's death in 1986. Prior to his appearance in his first film, years before ''Mister Roberts'', he started in live television. In one particular performance, Lemmon decided to play his character differently. He decided to play the character left-handed, which was opposite to his own [[handedness]]. With much practice, he pulled off the performance without anyone noticing the change. Even Lemmon's wife was fooled. A few years later, Lemmon met Cagney on their way to Midway Island to film ''Mister Roberts''. Cagney asked, \"Are you still fooling people into believing you're left-handed?\" They had a great laugh and a strong friendship was born.\n\nFonda wrote in his 1982 autobiography, ''My Life'', that he believed that as good as the movie is, the play is even better. ''Mister Roberts'' was William Powell's final acting appearance, although he lived nearly another 30 years, dying at age 91 in 1984. The film was also Cagney's last movie for Warner Bros., the studio that had propelled him to stardom in the 1930s and under which he had spent the majority of his career under contract.\n\n==USS ''Reluctant''==\nThe Navy vessel that played the role of USS ''Reluctant'' (AK-601), a.k.a. \"the Bucket,\" in the movie's exterior shots was a former U.S. Army Freight and Passenger/Freight and Supply (FP/FS) vessel, which was originally commissioned in the Navy following World War II.<ref>Another of the FP/FS conversions was [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']].</ref>  The {{USS|Hewell|AG-145}} is credited by the Navy as the ship assigned to the filming.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Bill |title= John Ford: A Bio-Bibliography |year= 1998 | page= 176 | publisher= [[Greenwood Press]] |location= Westport, CT |isbn= 0-313-27514-9}}</ref> The official Navy history for the ship<ref>{{cite web | author= Navy History & Heritage Command-Ships History Branch | title=''Hewell'' | work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (DANFS) | url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/h6/hewell.htm | access-date=September 23, 2011}}</ref> notes:\n\n<blockquote>In late August 1954 ''Hewell'' departed Hawaii for [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]], mooring at the Naval Base there on 28 August to help film the Warner Brothers movie ''Mister Roberts''.
