It stars [[Gibson Gowland]] as Dr. John McTeague; [[ZaSu Pitts]] as Trina Sieppe, his wife; and [[Jean Hersholt]] as McTeague's friend and eventual enemy Marcus Schouler. The film tells the story of McTeague, a [[San Francisco]] dentist, who marries his best friend Schouler's girlfriend Trina.\n\n''Greed'' was one of the few films of its time to be shot entirely on location, with von Stroheim shooting approximately 85 hours of footage before editing. Two months alone were spent shooting in [[Death Valley]] for the film's final sequence, and many of the cast and crew became ill. Von Stroheim used sophisticated filming techniques such as [[deep-focus]] cinematography and [[Soviet montage theory|montage editing]]. He considered ''Greed'' to be a [[Greek tragedy]], in which environment and heredity controlled the characters' fates and reduced them to primitive ''b\u00eates humaines'' (human beasts), a [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] concept in the vein of [[\u00c9mile Zola|Zola]].\n\nDuring editing, the production company merged into [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), putting [[Irving Thalberg]] in charge of post-production. Thalberg had fired von Stroheim a few years earlier at [[Universal Pictures]]. Originally almost eight hours long, ''Greed'' was edited against von Stroheim's wishes to about two-and-a-half hours. Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version, now [[List of incomplete or partially lost films|lost]]; some of them called it the greatest film ever made. Von Stroheim later called ''Greed'' his most fully realized work and was hurt both professionally and personally by the studio's re-editing of it.{{sfn|Weinberg|1972|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nThe uncut version has been called the \"holy grail\" for film archivists, amid repeated false claims of the discovery of the missing footage. In 1999, [[Turner Entertainment]] created a four-hour version that used existing stills of cut scenes to reconstruct the film. ''Greed'' was a critical and [[box office bomb|financial failure]] upon its initial release, but, by the 1950s, it began to be regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]; filmmakers and scholars have noted its influence on subsequent films. In 1958, the film was voted number 6 on the prestigious [[Expo 58#International film poll|Brussels 12]] list at the 1958 World Expo. It is one of the first examples of a psychological drama films in the early 20th century.<ref>{{Citation|title=Greed (1924) - Erich von Stroheim {{!}} Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related {{!}} AllMovie|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/greed-v20855|language=en|access-date=2021-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Greed|url=http://www.flickchart.com/movie/A2F740D803|language=en|access-date=2021-08-19}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=left|width=30%|quote=I never truckled, I never took off the hat to fashion and held it out for pennies.

A traveling dentist calling himself Dr. \"Painless\" Potter visits the town, and McTeague's mother begs Potter to take her son on as an apprentice. Potter agrees and McTeague eventually becomes a dentist, practicing on [[Polk Street]] in [[San Francisco]].\n\nMarcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, his cousin and intended fianc\u00e9e, into McTeague's office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine Trina. As they wait for an opening, she buys a [[lottery]] ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court her. After seeing McTeague's conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000.{{efn|Approximately ${{Inflation|US|5000|1908|fmt=c|r=-3}} in {{inflation-year|US}} dollars}} Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between him and McTeague. After McTeague and Trina wed, they continue to live in their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.\n\n{{multiple image|align = right|direction = vertical|total_width=250px|image1 =Greed, 1924, 03 mac e trina al primo appuntamento.jpg |image2 = Greed, 1924, 12 scale.jpg |footer=Trina and McTeague have a relationship that moves from romance to tragedy.}}\n\nSchouler leaves San Francisco to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for practicing dentistry without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even though she has saved over $200 in addition to the original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is still unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).\n\nTrina's bitten fingers become infected and have to be [[amputation|amputated]]. To earn money she becomes a janitor at a children's school. She withdraws the $5,000 from the bank to keep it close to her, eventually spreading it on her bed so she can sleep on it. McTeague then returns, having spent the money he took, and asks Trina for more. The following day McTeague confronts Trina at the school. After a heated argument McTeague beats Trina to death and steals her $5,000.\n\nNow an outlaw, McTeague returns to Placer County and teams up with a prospector named Cribbens. Headed towards [[Death Valley]], they find a large quantity of [[quartz]] and plan to become millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.\n\nThe oppressive heat slows McTeague's progress. Schouler's progress is also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague and moves in to arrest him. After a confrontation, McTeague's horse bolts and Schouler shoots it, puncturing the water container. The water spills onto the desert floor. The pair fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor; however, Schouler has handcuffed himself to McTeague. The film ends with McTeague left in the desert with no horse and no water, handcuffed to a corpse and unable to reach the remaining money.\n\n===Sub-plots===\nVon Stroheim's original edit contained two main sub-plots that were later cut. The point of these sub-plots was to contrast two possible outcomes of Trina and McTeague's life together. The first depicted the lives of the junkman Zerkow and Maria Miranda Macapa, the young Mexican woman who collects junk for Zerkow and sold Trina the lottery ticket. Maria often talks about her imaginary solid gold dining set with Zerkow, who becomes obsessed by it. Eventually, believing she has riches hidden away, Zerkow marries her. He often asks about it, but she gives a different answer each time he mentions it. Zerkow does not believe her and becomes obsessed with prying the truth from her. He murders her and, after having lost his mind, leaps into [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe second sub-plot depicts the lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly boarders who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall and listen to the other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Gibson Gowland]] as Dr. John McTeague, a dentist\n* [[ZaSu Pitts]] as Trina Sieppe, McTeague's wife\n* [[Jean Hersholt]] as Marcus Schouler, McTeague's friend\n; Prologue\n* [[Jack Curtis (actor)|Jack Curtis]] as McTeague's father\n* [[Tempe Pigott]] as McTeague's mother\n* Florence Gibson as a hag\n* Erich von Ritzau as Dr. \"Painless\" Potter, a traveling dentist\n; Sieppe Family\n* [[Chester Conklin]] as Hans \"Popper\" Sieppe, Trina's father\n* [[Sylvia Ashton|Silvia Ashton]] as \"Mommer\" Sieppe, Trina's mother\n* Austen Jewell as August Sieppe, Trina's younger brother\n* Oscar Gottell as Max Sieppe, Trina's younger brother\n* Otto Gottell as Moritz Sieppe, Trina's younger brother\n* [[Joan Standing]] as Selina, Trina's cousin\n* Max Tyron as Uncle Rudolph Oelbermann, Trina's uncle\n\n; Subplots\n* [[Dale Fuller (actor)|Dale Fuller]] as Maria Miranda Macapa, Zerkow's wife\n* [[Cesare Gravina]] as Zerkow, a junkman\n* [[Frank Hayes (actor)|Frank Hayes]] as Charles W.

Von Stroheim's interest in ''McTeague'' can be traced back to January 1920, when he told a journalist that he wanted to film the novel.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=188}} He had lived in San Francisco in the early 1910s, living there in poverty like that of the story's characters.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=186}} He eventually moved to [[Los Angeles]], and worked his way up in the film industry from extra to acting in villainous or aristocratic roles in films.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=25\u201358}} By 1919, von Stroheim had finally become a successful director in his own right at [[Universal Studios|Universal Film Manufacturing Company]], although one with a reputation of going over budget and over schedule.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=122}}\n\nUpon the appointment of [[Irving Thalberg]] as general manager at Universal, von Stroheim's defiance of commercial and industrial norms was no longer tolerated. After Thalberg's prior shutdown of ''[[Foolish Wives]]'' in 1921 (which had been shooting nonstop for eleven months), and after six weeks of filming on ''[[Merry-Go-Round (1923 film)|Merry-Go-Round]]'', von Stroheim was finally fired from the studio on October 6, 1922. This was a step unprecedented in Hollywood, heralding a new era in which the producer and the studio would hold artistic control over actors and directors.{{sfnm|1a1=Wakeman|1y=1987|1p=1073|2a1=Lennig|2y=2000|2p=188}} However, by this time von Stroheim had received several offers of contracts with other studios, even before being fired from Universal. He had met with executives of the [[Goldwyn Pictures|Goldwyn Company]] on September 14, 1922, less than a month before, and he formally signed with them in late November.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Erich Von Stroheim 1 Motion Picture Classic 1920.png|thumb|left|upright|Erich von Stroheim in 1920, the year he first publicly expressed interest in adapting the novel ''[[McTeague]]'']]\nVon Stroheim chose his new studio because of the level of artistic freedom he was offered, which he had been denied at Universal under Thalberg. Since March of that year, Goldwyn had been run by Abe Lehr, who publicly promised that \"each director will have his own staff and will be given every facility in putting into production his own individuality and personality.\"{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=188}} Von Stroheim signed a one-year, three-feature deal with Goldwyn on November 20, 1922. The deal stipulated that each feature would be between {{convert|4,500|and|8,500|ft|m}} long,{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=189\u2013190}} cost no more than $175,000 and be completed in fourteen weeks. It also promised von Stroheim $30,000 for each completed film.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=116}}\n\nLehr initially hired von Stroheim in order to film a big-budget version of the [[operetta]] ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', which the producer saw as a guaranteed hit; von Stroheim, however, convinced Lehr to let him make ''Greed'' first, promising low costs.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=189}} A press release of February 1923 said that although von Stroheim had \"run rather freely to large sets in the past, [he] seems to have reformed\u2014or surrendered\u2014for it is announced that he will not build any sets at all.\"{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=189}}\n\nVon Stroheim wrote a highly detailed 300-page script that contained camera movements, composition and [[Film tinting|tint]] cues.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=190}} Among the changes that he made to Norris's novel was giving McTeague the first name of John and omitting Norris's [[anti-Semitism]].{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=31}} ''McTeague'' had been filmed once before as ''[[McTeague (film)|Life's Whirlpool]]'', a five-reel short by [[William A. Brady]]'s World Pictures, starring Broadway star [[Holbrook Blinn]] as McTeague, which had been released in 1916.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=186}} Film critics disliked this version and von Stroheim later criticized Blinn's performance.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|pp=116\u2013117}} According to film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]], ''Life's Whirlpool'' was also shot on location in Death Valley.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=20}}\n\nVon Stroheim was known for his meticulous perfectionism and attention to detail,{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=8\u20139}} as well as his insolence towards studio executives.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=2}} Working on ''Greed'', von Stroheim set out to make a realistic film about everyday people and rejected the Hollywood tropes of glamor, happy endings and upper-class characters.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=217}} Before shooting began, von Stroheim told a reporter:\n\n{{blockquote|1=It is possible to tell a great story in motion pictures in such a way that the spectator forgets he is looking at beauteous Gertie Gefelta, the producer's pet and discovers himself intensely interested, just as if he were looking out of a window at life itself.

They went on in their daily life with their joys, fun and tragedies and the camera stole it all, holding it up afterward for all to see.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1074}}}}\n\nIn early January 1923, von Stroheim arrived in San Francisco, where he scouted locations and finished writing the shooting script. While researching for ''Greed'', he attended society functions in town and met many friends of Frank Norris, including his brother [[Charles Gilman Norris|Charles]] and his sister-in-law [[Kathleen Norris|Kathleen]].{{sfnm|1a1=Curtiss|1y=1971|1p=164|2a1=Koszarski|2y=1983|2p=122}} To capture the authentic spirit of the story, von Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in [[Iowa Hill, California|Iowa Hill]],{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|pp=156\u2013159}} and Death Valley.{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=29}} He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel.{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=16}} Other locations included [[Cliff House, San Francisco|Cliff House]] and San Francisco Bay.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=190}}\n\nNorris had similarly scouted settings for his novel and chose the upstairs of a building on the corner of Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=16}} Von Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris had described, such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=124}} For authenticity, von Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving on construction costs.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=190}}\n\nDespite the strict conditions of von Stroheim's initial contract, Goldwyn approved the lengthy shooting script before filming began. Production Manager J. J. Cohn later explained that \"they thought they could control him when the time comes.\"{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=127}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Souls for Sale (1923) - Greed fragment.webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=19|Scene of the film ''[[Souls for Sale]]'', showing von Stroheim directing Jean Hersholt in a screen test for ''Greed'']]\nWith the exception of [[Jean Hersholt]], all of the main actors in ''Greed'' were regulars of von Stroheim's earlier films, a group dubbed the \"Stroheim Stock Company\".{{sfn|Finler|1972|pp=17\u201318}} [[Gibson Gowland]] had previously appeared in ''[[Blind Husbands]]'' and returned to the U.S. from Scotland for the role of John McTeague. [[Cesare Gravina]], who played the junkman Zerkow, and [[Dale Fuller (actor)|Dale Fuller]], the lottery-ticket seller Maria, had both appeared in ''Foolish Wives'' and would later appear in ''The Merry Widow''. Other actors in von Stroheim's Stock Company included [[Sidney Bracey]], [[Mae Busch]], [[George Fawcett]], [[Maude George]], [[Hughie Mack]] and [[George Nichols (actor)|George Nichols]].{{sfn|Finler|1972|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nTrina was the most difficult role to cast, and [[ZaSu Pitts]] was hired at the last minute,{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=190}} after von Stroheim had rejected both [[Claire Windsor]] and [[Colleen Moore]].{{sfn|Curtiss|1971|p=165}} Pitts had previously acted only in comedic roles; ''Greed'' was her first dramatic part. The actress later appeared in both ''[[The Wedding March (1928 film)|The Wedding March]]'' and ''[[Hello, Sister! (1933 film)|Hello, Sister!]]'' Von Stroheim said that Pitts was \"the greatest psychopathological actress in the American cinema\" and that \"she should not be in comedy, for she is the greatest of all tragediennes.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Finler|1y=1972|1p=17|2a1=Koszarski|2y=1983|2p=119|3a1=Wakeman|3y=1987|3p=1074}}\n\nVon Stroheim had met casually with Jean Hersholt to discuss the role of Marcus Schouler, but he was initially reluctant to cast him. However, after Hersholt adjusted his appearance and wardrobe to more closely resemble Schouler, von Stroheim changed his mind on the spot.{{sfn|Finler|1972|pp=22\u201323}} With the exception of Gowland, von Stroheim shot extensive [[screen test]]s of all the other actors at Goldwyn with cinematographer [[Paul Ivano]].{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=119}} A scene from the Goldwyn film ''[[Souls for Sale]]'' is thought to be behind-the-scenes footage of von Stroheim directing ''Greed'', but it actually depicts him directing Hersholt during one of these screen tests.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=122}}\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in San Francisco on March 13, 1923,{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=124}} and lasted until late June.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=135}} Despite the initial contract between von Stroheim and Goldwyn, Lehr agreed to double the film's budget to $347,000 three days after shooting began.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|pp=21, 37}} Von Stroheim had already worked twenty-hour days for over two months of pre-production and collapsed on set after a few days of filming. He remained in good health for the remainder of the shoot.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=124}} This was not the only mishap on set; during scenes shot at San Francisco Bay, Cesare Gravina got double pneumonia, making von Stroheim bitterly ashamed that Gravina's entire performance was later cut from the film, despite the actor's dedication to the role.{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=27}} Hersholt was knocked out by Gowland during the picnic scene (later cut) in which McTeague and Schouler fight, and Pitts was almost run over by a trolley.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=129}} In late May, Lehr visited von Stroheim on the set and praised the footage that he had seen, saying that \"it has atmosphere, color and realism that could not possibly have been reproduced in the studio.\"{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=135}}\n\nOne scene that von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence depicted a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is too embarrassed to examine the teeth of a young woman and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=135}} Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A [[special-effect]] shot was used instead.{{sfn|Finler|1968|p=52}}\n\n[[File:Greed, 1924, 19 epilogo.jpg|thumb|The [[Death Valley]] scenes, including this final sequence, were filmed over two months during midsummer, in harsh conditions.]]\nAfter filming in San Francisco wrapped in late June, the production traveled to [[Death Valley]].

Try to hate each other as you both hate me!\"{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=24}} Throughout filming, von Stroheim brought musicians on set to help create mood for the actors. He continued to use this for the Death Valley scenes with a [[harmonium]] and [[violin]] player.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=81}} A theme, inspired by the music of [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], was composed and played throughout production. Other music used included the popular songs \"[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]\", \"[[Hearts and Flowers]]\", \"[[Oh Promise Me]]\", and \"Call Me Thine Own\".{{sfn|Curtiss|1971|p=173}}\n\nFilming moved to Placer County on September 13 and continued for less than a month. The Big Dipper Mine had been closed for ten years, so von Stroheim convinced the Goldwyn Company to lease and renovate it for filming. While first visiting Placer County during pre-production, von Stroheim had met Harold Henderson, a local resident and fan of Norris whose brother had worked in the mine in the 1890s. Von Stroheim hired Henderson to oversee the renovation of the mine and other locations in Iowa Hill. Von Stroheim also wanted to restore the local cemetery for a newly invented scene depicting McTeague's mother's funeral, but the Goldwyn Company turned down this proposal. Inside the mine, von Stroheim usually shot at night between 9&nbsp;pm and 6&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|pp=138\u2013139}} Cinematographer [[William Daniels (cinematographer)|William H. Daniels]] later said that von Stroheim insisted on descending {{convert|3,000|ft|m|sigfig=1}} underground for realism, even though the setting would have looked exactly the same at {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}}.{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=26}} Filming was completed on October 6, 1923,{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=190}} after 198 days.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=140}} Despite his original contract stipulating that all films be under {{convert|8,500|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, von Stroheim shot a total of {{convert|446,103|ft|m}} of footage for the film, running approximately 85 hours.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=215}}\n\n===Style===\n\n[[File:Greed, 1924, 05 passaggio del carro funebre in profondit\u00e0 di campo.jpg|thumb|left|The wedding scene made innovative use of [[deep-focus]] cinematography, despite challenges with the lighting.]]\n\nVon Stroheim's biographer Arthur Lennig compared the director's visual style to that of pioneering filmmaker [[D. W. Griffith]], but felt that \"unlike Griffith, who viewed scenes as though through a fourth wall, von Stroheim shot from many sides and from different angles; he also used deep-focus, meaningful foregrounds and effective camera movement.\"{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=219}} ''Greed''{{'}}s lighting included high contrast, [[chiaroscuro]] techniques with pools or shafts of lights illuminating an otherwise dark space. Examples of this technique include the scene where McTeague begs Trina for money in a pool of moonlight and the merry-go-round scene in which characters alternate between appearing only as dark silhouettes and being fully lit.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=76, 202}}\n\nDaniels was especially proud of the wedding scene, which has a funeral procession visible through the window and was difficult to light properly.{{sfnm|1a1=Finler|1y=1972|1p=26|2a1=Lennig|2y=2000|2p=77}} ''Greed'' has often been praised for its use of [[deep focus]] cinematography, seventeen years before its more-famous application in ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=206}} Daniels sometimes used [[incandescent light]]s instead of studio [[Arc lamp|arc lights]], due to the constraints of his locations.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=134}} He later said that von Stroheim \"was one of the first to insist on no make-up for men, on real paint on the walls which were shiny, real glass in the windows, pure white on sets and in costumes&nbsp; ... everything up to then had been painted a dull brown\" to mask the scratches on worn-down film prints.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=77}} Although not officially credited, [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] worked on the picture as a camera operator.{{sfn|Weinberg|1972|p=21}}\n\nVon Stroheim favored [[Soviet montage theory|\"Soviet-style\" montage editing]]. ''Greed'' often uses dramatic close-ups and cuts instead of long takes. One exception to this is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Von Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=75\u201376, 202}} In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called von Stroheim a montage director, stating that \"each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact.\"{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=142}} In the 1950s film critic [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] praised von Stroheim's use of ''[[mise en sc\u00e8ne]]'' and noted his \"one simple rule for directing. Take a close look at the world, keep on doing so and in the end it will lay bare for you all its cruelty and ugliness.\"{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=142}}\n\nDespite von Stroheim's reputation as a perfectionist, ''Greed'' contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Von Stroheim did his best to avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era ''Greed'' was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, von Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=22}}\n\n===Themes===\n\nFrank Norris's novel belongs to the literary school of [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] founded by French author [[\u00c9mile Zola]].{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=187}} ''McTeague'' depicts the fate of its lower-class characters in terms of heredity and their environment,{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1073}} with the belief that \"man's nature, despite free will, is determined by genetic and environmental factors\"{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=187}} and that heredity controls fate, despite efforts at upward mobility.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=118}} This literary style was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]] and portrayed characters whose higher states of being, the rational and compassionate, are in conflict with their lower states, the ''b\u00eate humaine'' (human beast).{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=118}} ''McTeague'' was first published in 1899 and was inspired by an October 1893 murder case in which Patrick Collins, a poor husband with a history of beating his wife Sarah, finally stole her money and stabbed her to death at her San Francisco workplace. Sarah Collins worked at the Lest Norris kindergarten, which was financed by Norris's family.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=186}}{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|pp=16-18}}\n\nVon Stroheim did not see ''Greed'' as political and told a journalist that he considered it to be like a [[Greek tragedy]]. Despite the characters' struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters whose lives are driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner falling in love with an aristocrat or royal.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=129}}\n\n[[File:Greed, 1924, 06 banchetto.jpg|thumb|right|In the wedding banquet scene, Trina's mother grotesquely devours her food.]]\n\nOne of the cinematic techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=195\u2013196}} In ''Greed'' McTeague is associated with a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=198}} Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=214}} McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=198, 200}} Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=198}} Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=195\u2013196}} Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures or phrases that repeat throughout the film as a visual ''[[leitmotif]]''. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.{{sfn|Finler|1968|pp=31, 38}}\n\nThroughout his career von Stroheim used grotesque imagery and characters. This is most apparent in the wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=87\u201388}} The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity and a sense of communion.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|pp=204\u2013206}} Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=211}} Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=95}}\n\nAs in his other films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=91}} Trina first shows signs of greed on [[Easter Sunday]] and is murdered by McTeague on [[Christmas Eve]]. Christmas Eve was often depicted in von Stroheim's films and was close to the date of his father's death.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=90}} Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom ''Greed'' is dedicated.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=193}} Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=194}}\n\n==Editing==\n\n===Initial editing===\n\nEditing ''Greed'' took almost a year and von Stroheim's contract did not include payment for his post-production work.{{sfn|Weinberg|1972|p=15}} He and his chief film cutter Frank Hull worked on the film for several months before completing a rough cut.{{sfnm|1a1=Finler|1y=1972|1p=29|2a1=Koszarski|2y=1983|2p=326}} Von Stroheim was indecisive during editing. He felt restricted by his contract's limitation on the length of the film.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=140}} Von Stroheim colored certain scenes with gold tinting by using the [[Handschiegl Color Process]], in which individual frames are hand colored with stencils.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=147}} Von Stroheim credited himself in the beginning titles with \"Personally directed by Erich von Stroheim.\"{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=41}}\n\nOther than studio personnel, only twelve people saw the original 42-reel{{efn|It is traditional to discuss the length of theatrical motion pictures in terms of \"[[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reels]]\". The standard length of a 35&nbsp;mm motion picture reel is {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}. This length runs approximately 11 minutes at sound speed (24 frames per second) and slightly longer at silent film speed (which may vary from approximately 16 to 22 frames per second).

I can't imagine what they are going to do with it. It is like ''[[Les Miserables]]''. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels.\"{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=141}} [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of [[Jacques Rivette]]'s ''[[Out 1]]''.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=29}} Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared ''Greed'' to ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' and ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]''.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=141}} However, Welford Beaton of ''The Film Spectator'' disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=141}}\n\n[[File:Greed, 1924, 10.1 rapacit\u00e0.jpg|thumb|left|Some scenes, like this one, were [[Handschiegl Color Process|gold tinted]] by von Stroheim himself, hand coloring individual frames with stencils.]]\n\nMany sources claim that the 42-reel version was only ever intended to be a rough cut,{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=141}} and that Von Stroheim chose to cut it down to 24 reels by March 18, 1924,{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1074}}{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=142}} with the intention of screening it with intermissions over two nights.{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=18}} The director had difficulty cutting the film down, telling his friend Don Ryan, \"I could take out sequences and thus get the job over in a day. That would be child's play. But I can't do it. It would leave gaps that could only be bridged through titles. When you do such a thing you have illustrated subtitles instead of a motion picture.\"{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=141}} Von Stroheim later claimed that at this time the Goldwyn Company wanted him to shoot a scene of McTeague waking up in his dentist chair, showing the entire film to have been a bad dream.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=141}} While von Stroheim was editing the 24-reel cut June Mathis, who was the head of the Goldwyn Story Department, had made her own 13-reel version of ''Greed'' by January 21, 1924. She ordered even more cuts to be made on January 29, but then left for Rome in early February to oversee the production of ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and was uninvolved in the film's editing for several months.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=144}}\n\nAfter having completed the 24-reel{{efn|264 minutes (4 hours and 20 minutes) at 24 fps and 315 minutes (5 hours and 15 minutes) at 20 fps.}} cut of ''Greed'', von Stroheim told Goldwyn executives that he could not cut another frame.{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=18}} Goldwyn producers thought that this version was still too long and told him to cut it to a more manageable length. Von Stroheim then sent the film to his friend, director Rex Ingram, who turned it over to his editor, [[Grant Whytock]].{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=18}} Whytock had worked with von Stroheim on ''[[The Devil's Pass Key]]'' and was familiar with the director's style and tastes. Whytock initially proposed that it be split in two, with one 8-reel film ending with the wedding and a second 7-reel film ending at Death Valley. Whytock eventually cut the film down to 18 reels.{{efn|198 minutes (3 hours and 20 minutes) at 24 fps and 236 minutes (3 hours and 56 minutes) at 20 fps.}} His only major cut was the entire subplot of Zerkow and Maria, which he thought was \"very distasteful\".{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=143}} Otherwise he simply cut down scenes and cut out {{convert|1,200|ft|m|sigfig=1}} of quick \"flash\" shots that only lasted a few frames.

Later in 1952, ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine published its first list of the \"ten greatest films ever made\".

Rosenbaum compared specific shot set-ups in ''Greed'' to shots in [[King Vidor]]'s ''[[The Crowd (1928 film)|The Crowd]]'', Jean Renoir's ''[[Le Crime de Monsieur Lange]]'', Orson Welles's ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[L'Avventura]]''. In addition, he likened certain plot elements or characters in ''Greed'' to [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Les Bonnes Femmes]]'' (1960) and [[Elaine May]]'s ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]'' (1975). Rosenbaum singled out von Stroheim's influence on May, an American director, with ''Mikey and Nicky'' centering on the disintegration of a friendship over money and sex, and including grotesque elements and characters caught between innocence and corruption. Rosenbaum also asserts that Orson Welles's use of satirical caricatures in all of his films is in \"the spirit of von Stroheim\".{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|pp=52\u201358}}\n\nThe two films most commonly compared to ''Greed'' are Huston's ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' and Welles's ''The Magnificent Ambersons''. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being lost in the desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' and ''Greed'' both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. ''Ambersons'' was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that ''Greed'' influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and [[Bill Forsyth]] followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to the intentions of the original novels.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|pp=58-59}} In the first chapter of the 1966 [[serial film]] ''Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates'', the uncut version of ''Greed'' is used as a [[plot device]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Devil Is Driving and Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates: Chapters 1 and 2|url=https://bampfa.org/event/devil-driving-and-captain-celluloid-vs-film-pirates-chapters-1-and-2 |website=bampfa.org |publisher=[[Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive]] |access-date=February 12, 2021 |date=August 1, 1983}}</ref> The 1994 [[Jonathan Lynn]] film ''[[Greedy (film)|Greedy]]'' pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/greedy-1994 |title=Greedy |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] |location=Chicago |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |access-date=October 1, 2013 |date=March 4, 1994 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421212700/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19940304%2FREVIEWS%2F403040304%2F1023 |archive-date=April 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\nAttempts to reconstruct the uncut version of ''Greed'' without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the ''Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que royale de Belgique'' named ''Greed'' as one of the twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for ''Greed'', which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac.{{sfnm|1a1=Finler|1y=1972|1p=6|2a1=Weinberg|2y=1972|2p=15}} This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order to reconstruct the original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and [[Herman G. Weinberg]], both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos to reconstruct the uncut version of ''Greed'', the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nIn 1999, [[Turner Entertainment]] decided to recreate, as closely as possible, the original version by combining the existing footage with over 650 still photographs of the lost scenes (many of which had been used in Weinberg's book),<ref name=\"www.jonathanrosenbaum.net\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1999/11/fables-of-the-reconstruction-the-4-hour-greed/ |title=Fables of the Reconstruction: The 4-Hour GREED |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |newspaper=The Chicago Reader |date=November 26, 1999 |access-date=April 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219134947/http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1999/11/fables-of-the-reconstruction-the-4-hour-greed/ |archive-date=December 19, 2013}}</ref> in accordance with an original continuity outline written by von Stroheim.

He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired him to make a career in filmmaking.{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=14}} [[Georges Sadoul]] later stated that von Stroheim had first read the novel in 1914, while living in poverty in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=20}}\n\nClaims that von Stroheim's original cut was a completely unabridged version of ''McTeague'' are not accurate. Von Stroheim's 300-page script was almost as long as the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=191}} In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In von Stroheim's original ''Greed'', this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=192}} Von Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.{{sfn|Lennig|2000|p=191}}\n\n''Greed'' has sometimes been said to be over 100 reels long. von Stroheim said that his initial edit was 42 reels, although several of the people who saw this cut remembered it as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=24}} Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that von Stroheim initially sent to him as between 26 and 28 reels.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=143}} MGM's official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=25}} As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor [[Samuel Marx]] erroneously claimed that the original version of ''Greed'' was 70 reels.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|p=10}}\n\nJune Mathis is credited with co-writing the script due to her work on the 10-reel version. Mathis was the head of the Story Department at MGM and her contract stipulated that she would receive writing credit for all MGM films. She did not actually write any part of the screenplay.{{sfn|Finler|1972|p=16}} She is said to have changed its title from ''McTeague'' to ''Greed'' during post-production;{{sfn|Weinberg|1972|p=41}} however, a publicity still of the cast and crew taken during production clearly indicates that it was titled ''Greed'' before the MGM merger even took place.{{sfn|Weinberg|1972|p=30}} The film's working title was \"''Greedy Wives''\", a nod towards von Stroheim's previous film ''Foolish Wives''; this working title never was considered as the film's actual title.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=116}}\n\nThe original version of ''Greed'' has been called the \"holy grail\" for film archivists.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=1074}} Various reports of the original version being uncovered have proved to be unfounded. Among these \"sightings\" are a claim that a copy existed in a vault in South America that only was screened once a year for invited guests on New Year's Eve. Another claim was that a copy in the possession of a Texan millionaire was sold to Henri Langlois of ''[[Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise]]''. Other claims include that a film society in Boston held a private screening of a print found by a World War II veteran in Berlin from a tip by [[Emil Jannings]], that [[David Shepard (film preservationist)|David Shepherd]] of the [[American Film Institute]] had found a copy at a garage sale, and that the head of a film society in [[Redwood City, California]] owned \"the longest existing version of ''Greed'' (purchased in Europe).\" von Stroheim himself once stated that [[Benito Mussolini]] owned a personal copy of the film.{{sfn|Weinberg|1972|p=9}} Von Stroheim's son Joseph von Stroheim once claimed that when he was in the Army during World War II, he saw a version of the film that took two nights to fully screen, although he could not remember exactly how long it was.{{sfn|Koszarski|1983|p=149}}\n\nThere were also reports that MGM had retained a copy of the original version. Iris Barry of the Museum of Modern Art claimed that a copy was locked in the MGM vaults, although Thalberg denied it. It was also reported that [[John Houseman]] had a private screening at MGM and that MGM owned two copies stored in a vault in a Utah salt mine.{{sfn|Weinberg|1972|p=9}} Lotte Eisner once claimed that in the 1950s and 1960s, several cans of films labeled \"McTeague\" were found in MGM's vaults and destroyed by executives who did not know that it was footage from ''Greed''.{{sfn|Rosenbaum|1993|pp=38\u201339}} MGM executive [[Albert Lewin|Al Lewin]] said that several years after the film's release von Stroheim asked him for the cut footage.
