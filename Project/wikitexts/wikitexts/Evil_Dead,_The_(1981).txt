The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audio tape that, when played, releases a legion of [[demon]]s and spirits, four members of the group suffer from [[demonic possession]], forcing the fifth member, [[Ash Williams]] (Campbell), to survive an onslaught of increasingly gory mayhem.\n\nRaimi, Tapert, Campbell, and their friends produced the [[short film]] ''[[Within the Woods]]'' as a [[proof of concept]] to build the interest of potential investors, which secured US$90,000 to begin work on ''The Evil Dead''. Principal photography took place on location in a remote cabin located in [[Morristown, Tennessee]], in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the cast and crew; the film's extensive [[prosthetic makeup]] effects and [[stop-motion animation]]s were created by artist [[Tom Sullivan (special effects artist)|Tom Sullivan]]. The completed film attracted the interest of producer [[Irvin Shapiro]], who helped screen the film at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]]. Horror author [[Stephen King]] gave a rave review of the film, which resulted in [[New Line Cinema]] acquiring its distribution rights.\n\n''The Evil Dead'' grossed $2.4 million in the US and between $2.7 and $29.4 million worldwide. Both early and later critical reception were universally positive; in the years since its release, the film has developed a reputation as one of the most significant [[cult film]]s, cited among the greatest horror films of all time and one of the most successful independent films. It launched the careers of Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell, who have continued to collaborate on several films together, such as Raimi's [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]].\n\n''The Evil Dead'' spawned a [[Evil Dead|media franchise]], beginning with two direct [[sequel]]s written and directed by Raimi, ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' (1987) and ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1992), a fourth film, ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'' (2013), which serves as a soft [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] and continuation, and a follow-up TV series, ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'', which aired from 2015 to 2018; the franchise also includes video games and [[Army of Darkness (comics)|comic books]]. The film's protagonist Ash Williams is also considered to be a [[cultural icon]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=December 1, 2008|title=Empire's The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/empires-the-100-greatest-movie-characters-of-all-time/|access-date=October 4, 2020|website=/Film|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words.

Approaching the cabin, the group notices the porch swing move on its own but suddenly stop as Scott grabs the doorknob. While Cheryl draws a picture of a clock, the clock stops, and she hears a faint, demonic voice tell her to \"join us\". Her hand becomes possessed, turns pale and draws a picture of a book with a demonic face on its cover. Although shaken, she does not mention the incident.\n\nWhen the cellar trapdoor flies open during dinner, Shelly, Linda, and Cheryl remain upstairs as Ash and Scott investigate the cellar. They find the ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Naturom Demonto]]'', a [[Sumer]]ian version of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', along with archaeologist Raymond Knowby's [[tape recorder]], and they take the items upstairs. Scott plays a tape of [[incantation]]s that resurrect a demonic entity. Cheryl yells for Scott to turn off the tape recorder, and a tree branch breaks one of the cabin's windows. Later that evening, an agitated Cheryl goes into the woods to investigate strange noises, where she is attacked and raped by [[Demonic possession|demonically possessed]] trees. When she escapes and returns to the cabin bruised and anguished, Ash agrees to take her back into town, only to discover that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. Cheryl panics as she realizes that they are now trapped and the demonic entity will not let them leave. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape, learning that the only way to kill the entity is to dismember a possessed host. As Linda and Shelly play [[Spades (card game)|spades]], Cheryl correctly calls out the cards, succumbs to the entity, and levitates. In a raspy, demonic voice, she demands to know why they disturbed her sleep and threatens to kill everyone. She stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil and throws Ash into a shelf. Scott knocks Cheryl into the cellar and locks her inside.\n\nEveryone fights about what to do. Having become paranoid upon seeing Cheryl's demonic transformation, Shelly lies down in her room but is drawn to look out of her window, where a demon crashes through and attacks her, turning her into a Deadite. She attacks Scott before he throws her into the fireplace and then stabs her in the back with a Sumerian dagger, apparently killing her. When she reanimates, Scott dismembers her with an axe and buries the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves to find a way back to town. He shortly returns mortally wounded from the possessed trees, and dies while warning Ash that the trees will not let them escape alive. When Ash checks on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has become possessed. She attacks him, but he stabs her with the Sumerian dagger. Unwilling to dismember her, he buries her instead. She revives and attacks him, forcing him to decapitate her with a shovel. Her headless body bleeds on his face as it tries to rape him, he escapes and retreats to the cabin.\n\nBack inside, Ash discovers that Cheryl has escaped the cellar. Cheryl eludes Ash, and attempts to choke him. Ash escapes her grasp, then shoots Cheryl in the jaw. As Ash is barricading the door, Scott reanimates into a Deadite. Scott attacks Ash, and inadvertently knocks the Naturom Demonto close to the fireplace. Ash gouges Scott's eyes out and pulls a tree branch from Scott's stomach, causing him to bleed out and fall to the ground. Cheryl breaks through the barricade and knocks Ash to the floor. As Scott and Cheryl continue to attack Ash on the ground, Ash grabs the Naturom Demonto and throws it into the fireplace. While the book burns, the Deadites freeze in place, then begin to rapidly decompose. Large appendages burst from both corpses, covering Ash in blood. Dawn breaks, and Ash stumbles outside.\n\nAs Ash walks away from the cabin, an unseen demon moves rapidly through the forest, rushes through the cabin, and attacks him from behind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Campbell]] as [[Ash Williams]]\n* [[Ellen Sandweiss]] as Cheryl Williams\n* Richard DeManincor (as Hal Delrich) as Scott\n* [[Betsy Baker]] as Linda\n* Theresa Tilly (as Sarah York) as Shelly\n\n===Uncredited===\n* [[Sam Raimi]] as Local Fisherman and the voice of the Evil Dead<ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b713b30c5|title=The Evil Dead (1982)|website=[[BFI]]|access-date=May 31, 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Robert Tapert]] as Local Fisherman<ref name=\"BFI\" />\n* Bob Dorian as Professor Knowby's voice\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sam Raimi by Gage Skidmore.jpg|alt=A man sitting next to a microphone placed on a table.|[[Sam Raimi]] wrote and directed the short film ''[[Within the Woods]]'' to generate the interest of investors for ''The Evil Dead''. |thumb|right|upright]]\n\n===Background and writing===\n[[Sam Raimi]] and [[Bruce Campbell]] grew up together, and have been friends from an early age.{{sfn|Winston Dixon|2010|p=161}} The duo made several low-budget [[Super 8 mm film]] projects together.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=65}} Several were comedies, including ''[[Clockwork (film)|Clockwork]]'' and ''[[It's Murder!]]''.{{sfn|Egan|2011|p=16}}{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=66}} Shooting a suspense scene in ''It's Murder!'' inspired them to approach careers in the horror genre; after researching horror cinema at [[drive-in theater]]s, Raimi was set on directing a horror film, opting to shoot a [[proof of concept]] [[short film]] - described by the director as a \"prototype\" - that would attract the interest of financiers, and use the funds raised to shoot a full-length project.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=66}}{{sfn|Becker|2006|p=64}} The [[short film]] that Raimi created was called ''[[Within the Woods]]'', which was produced for $1,600.{{sfn|Lamberson|2008|p=84}} For ''The Evil Dead'' Raimi required over $100,000.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=85\u201388}}\n\nTo generate funds to produce the film, Raimi approached Phil Gillis, a lawyer to one of his friends.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=85\u201388}}{{sfn|Konow|2012|p=412\u2013413}} Raimi showed him ''Within the Woods'', and although Gillis was not impressed by the short film, he offered Raimi legal advice on how to produce ''The Evil Dead''.

The crew initially attempted to shoot the film in Raimi's hometown of [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], but instead chose [[Morristown, Tennessee]], as it was the only state that expressed enthusiasm for the project. The crew quickly found a remote cabin located several miles away from any other buildings. During pre-production, the 13 crew members had to stay at the cabin, leading to several people sleeping in the same room. The living conditions were notoriously difficult, with several arguments breaking out between crew members.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=96\u201398}}\n\nSteve Frankel was the only carpenter on set, which made him the art direction's sole contributor.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=93\u201394}} For exterior shots, Frankel had to produce several elaborate props with a circular saw.

The film went through name changes and bannings only to survive as not only 'the ultimate experience in grueling horror' but as an oft-imitated and cashed-in-on classic, with 30 years of positive reviews to prove it.\"<ref name=\"PM\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Bruce Campbell .jpg|alt=A man sitting at a table with a VHS on the table.|[[Bruce Campbell]] at a fan convention, signing a [[VHS]] copy of ''The Evil Dead''.|thumb|right|upright]]\n\nWhile ''The Evil Dead'' received favorable critical comment when it was initially released, it failed to establish Raimi's reputation.{{sfn|Egan|2011|p=22}} It was, however, a box-office success, which led to Campbell and Raimi teaming up again for the release of another movie.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=161\u2013163}} [[Coen brothers|Joel Coen]] and his brother [[Coen brothers|Ethan]] had collaborated as directors and released the film ''Blood Simple'', to critical acclaim.{{sfn|\u017di\u017eek|2000|p=111}} According to Campbell, Ethan, then an accountant, expressed surprise when the duo succeeded.{{sfn|Campbell|2002|p=161\u2013163}} The Coen brothers and Raimi collaborated on a screenplay, which was released shortly after ''The Evil Dead''.
