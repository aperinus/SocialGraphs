The original [[screenplay]] is by Morgan Ward. It was filmed in [[Toronto (Canada)|Toronto]].\n\n==Plot summary==\nSergio is a [[Toronto]] pastry shop assistant who is smitten with Hattie, a mousy girl who works in her father Perry's diner and refuses to consider a relationship with him until he begins to earn a decent living. An opportunity presents itself when Linzer, Sergio's employer, offers him $20,000 to torch the store so he can collect the insurance money and use it to give his wife the lifestyle he feels she deserves. Sergio declines the offer, but one night the bakery is burnt to the ground anyway.\n\nSergio is offered $25,000 to take the blame by the [[millionaire]] father of the real culprit, the mentally unstable Garet, who set the bakery on fire as a public declaration of his love for his society girlfriend Stephanie, whose attraction to Sergio, unbeknownst to her vengeance-seeking beau, is unrequited. Despite his innocence, Sergio claims responsibility for the fire so he can use the money to claim Hattie as his own. Linzer, however, has second thoughts about allowing Sergio to pay for the crime, so he confesses he did it, while his wife insists she set the blaze to prevent her husband from being imprisoned. Sgt. Zikowski is left to determine who of the four claiming guilt is the real perpetrator.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Baldwin]] as Garet\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Sergio\n* [[Sadie Frost]] as Hattie\n* [[Erika Eleniak]] as Stephanie\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Perry\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Mrs. Linzer\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Mr. Linzer\n* [[Mike Starr (actor)|Mike Starr]] as Sgt.

But its nearly jokeless screenplay by Morgan Ward is so convoluted with plot twists that the characters barely have time to breathe before the story forces them to adopt a new set of caricatured attitudes.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE1DD173BF93BA15757C0A963958260 ''New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said the film \"starts out like a lighthearted charmer, and then it goes on and on and on\u2014circling the same plot idea so doggedly that I began to wonder idly what it might have been like as a short subject. It doesn't have a mean bone in its body or, for that matter, a brain in its head . . . The characters behave like simpletons, breaking up and getting back together again at the convenience of the plot. Director Joshua Brand . . . has the nerve to go for the sort of cheerful whimsy of ''Moonstruck'', ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' and ''[[While You Were Sleeping (film)|While You Were Sleeping]]''. But whimsy without wit is like an empty smile.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950428/REVIEWS/504280303/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] said it \"has a fine cast and a director, Joshua Brand, who has a feeling for the tone of the piece. The film's cinematography is crisp and slightly fantastic, and its sound track is sardonic but warm. But the script\u2014ooh, that script. After a charming first few minutes, ''A Pyromaniac's Love Story'' becomes relentlessly fey, unbearably picaresque and sadistically lyric. Morgan Ward's screenplay is like an inept attempt at a [[Giraudoux]] play or a [[John Patrick Shanley]] script. But without the passion behind it\u2014or the flair for heightened language\u2014the thing is a 100-minute nose-dive.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/templates/types/popunder/economist/economist.html ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review]</ref>\n\nJoe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"a quirky little gem\" and \"a modern-day fairy tale with a bemused appreciation of romantic love, blazing passions and other human follies.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904004.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', Gary Kamiya observed, \"It would take more than a can of lighter fluid to ignite this soggy film. ''A Pyromaniac's Love Story'' aspires to being an offbeat comedy, somewhere between a fairy tale and a whimsical love story. What it is an irritatingly smarmy, implausible mess. A kind of slow-motion [[farce]] that ill-advisedly attempts to mingle wildly disparate realities and acting styles, [it] might have worked had its various plot strands been ingeniously interwoven. But no [[P.G. Wodehouse]] or [[Georges Feydeau]] is anywhere in sight . . . This film slips between arch cutesiness and semi-seriousness with no discernible pattern or purpose.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1995/04/28/WEEKEND8921.dtl ''San Francisco Examiner'' review]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0114210}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|pyromaniacs_love_story}}\n* {{Mojo title|pyromaniacslovestory}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pyromaniacs Love Story, A}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1995 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1995 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Rachel Portman]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
