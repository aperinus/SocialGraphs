Katherine comes to know them, seeking to inspire them to achieve more than marriage.\n\nHighly opinionated Elizabeth \"Betty\" Warren is outspokenly conservative. She does not understand why Katherine is not married and insists a universal standard exists for good art. She writes editorials for the college paper, exposing campus nurse Amanda Armstrong as a supplier of contraception, resulting in her termination.\n\nOther editorials attack Katherine for advocating that women seek a career instead of being wives and mothers. Betty cannot wait to marry Spencer and expects the traditional exemptions from attending class as a married woman; however, Katherine insists she will be marked on merit.\n\nConstance \"Connie\" Baker begins dating Betty's cousin, Charlie, but Betty tells her he is to marry Deb MacIntyre. Connie ends the relationship, believing Betty. However, some weeks later, Connie and Charlie reconnect, with him telling her he had stopped seeing Deb after the previous summer.\n\nJoan Brandwyn dreams of being a lawyer and is enrolled as prelaw, so Katherine encourages her to apply to [[Yale Law School]]. Accepted, she still opts to play the traditional role of a housewife to Tom Donegal. She tells Katherine that choosing to be a wife and mother does not reduce her intelligence.\n\nGiselle Levy has several lovers and liberal views about sex. She admires Katherine for encouraging the students to be independent. Giselle earns Betty's enmity, who is very conservative.\n\nKatherine declines a marriage proposal from her California boyfriend, as she does not love him enough and begins seeing the Wellesley Italian professor, Bill Dunbar. He is charming and full of stories about Europe and his heroic actions in Italy during the war. He has also had affairs with students (including Giselle), and Katherine makes him promise he will stop.\n\nThe relationship progresses, but when Katherine learns that Bill spent the entire war at the Army Languages Center on Long Island, she breaks up with him. He responds that Katherine did not come to Wellesley to help the students find their way, but rather her way.\n\nBetty's marriage falls apart after Spencer has an affair, and her mother orders her to return to her husband rather than offer support. She visits Giselle in her dorm, who comforts her. In turn, Betty regrets how she has treated Katherine with her poor behavior. Eventually, influenced by her, Betty files for divorce and looks for an apartment in [[Greenwich Village]].\n\nWhen Mrs. Warren confronts Betty for what she has done, she reveals her frustration with her mother for not supporting her when she asked for it. She says the only person who cared about her enough to help her out was Katherine. Therefore, Betty reveals she is going to have a life of her own, living with Giselle, and is considering applying to Yale Law School.\n\nKatherine's course is highly popular, so she is invited to return, but under these conditions: she must follow the syllabus, submit lesson plans for approval, and keep a strictly professional relationship with all faculty members and students.\n\nKatherine decides to leave to explore Europe. In the final scene, Betty dedicates her last editorial to Katherine, calling her \"an extraordinary woman who lived by example and compelled us all to see the world through new eyes.\" As she leaves in a taxi, all her students follow on their bicycles, with Betty reaching to say goodbye until the taxi speeds away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Katherine Ann Watson\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Elizabeth \"Betty\" Warren (Jones)\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Joan Brandwyn (Donegal)\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Giselle Levy\n* [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Constance \"Connie\" Baker\n* [[Laura Allen]] as Susan Delacorte\n* [[Tori Amos]] as wedding singer\n* [[Emily Bauer]] as a student\n* [[Jordan Bridges]] as Spencer Jones\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Nancy Abbey\n* Lisa Roberts Gillan as Miss Albini\n* [[Topher Grace]] as Tommy Donegal\n* [[Annika Marks]] as a student\n* Donna Mitchell as Mrs. Warren\n* [[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]] as Charlie Stewart\n* [[Lily Rabe]] as a student\n* [[Krysten Ritter]] as a student\n* [[Terence Rigby]] as Dr. Edward Staunton\n* [[Marian Seldes]] as President Jocelyn Carr\n* [[John Slattery]] as Paul Moore\n* [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Amanda Armstrong\n* [[Dominic West]] as Bill Dunbar\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Mona Lisa Smile\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Various\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = December 19, 2003\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Jazz]]{{*}}[[easy listening]]{{*}}[[big band]]\n| length     = 48:27\n| label      = [[Sony Music]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Performer\n| title1 = [[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]\n| length1 = 3:11\n| extra1 = [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]\n| title2 = [[You Belong to Me (1952 song)|You Belong to Me]]\n| length2 = 3:03\n| extra2 = [[Tori Amos]]\n| title3 = [[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]\n| length3 = 2:45\n| extra3 = [[Celine Dion]]\n| title4 = The Heart of Every Girl\n| length4 = 3:40\n| extra4 = [[Elton John]]\n| title5 = [[Santa Baby]]\n| length5 = 3:29\n| extra5 = [[Macy Gray]]\n| title6 = [[Happy Go Lucky (1943 film)|Murder, He Says]]\n| length6 = 3:22\n| extra6 = Tori Amos\n| title7 = [[Besame Mucho]]\n| length7 = 2:46\n| extra7 = [[Chris Isaak]]\n| title8 = [[Secret Love (Doris Day song)|Secret Love]]\n| length8 = 3:40\n| extra8 = [[Mandy Moore]]\n| title9 = [[What'll I Do]]\n| length9 = 3:12\n| extra9 = [[Alison Krauss]]\n| title10 = [[Istanbul (Not Constantinople)]]\n| length10 = 2:26\n| extra10 = [[Trevor Horn|The Trevor Horn Orchestra]]\n| title11 = [[Sh-Boom|Sh-Boom (Life Could Be a Dream)]]\n| length11 = 2:49\n| extra11 = The Trevor Horn Orchestra\n| title12 = [[I'm Beginning to See the Light]]\n| length12 = 1:47\n| extra12 = [[Kelly Rowland]]\n| title13 = [[I've Got the World on a String]]\n| length13 = 2:20\n| extra13 = [[Lisa Stansfield]]\n| title14 = [[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]\n| length14 = 4:17\n| extra14 = [[Barbra Streisand]]\n| title15 = Suite\n| length15 = 5:33\n| extra15 = [[Rachel Portman]]\n| total_length = 48:27\n}}\n\n==Box office==\nIn its first weekend, ''Mona Lisa Smile'' opened at number two at the U.S. box office, earning [[USD|US$]]11,528,498 behind ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weekend Box Office December 19\u201321, 2003|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2003&wknd=51&p=.htm|work=Box Office Mojo|access-date=September 13, 2016}}</ref> By the end of its run, while the film had grossed $141,337,989 worldwide, its U.S. domestic gross did not meet its $65 million budget, falling short at $63,860,942.\n\n==Reception==\n''Mona Lisa Smile'' received mixed to negative reviews from film critics.

She gives a rather blah performance as if she's not fully committed to the role... Rather than being a fascinating exploration of a much more constrained time in our social history, the film simply feels anachronistic. The film deserves a solid 'C' for mediocrity and muted appeal.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2003-12-18-mona-lisa_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Claudia | last1=Puig | title=Crooked 'Smile' | date=December 19, 2003}}</ref> Critic Elizabeth M. Tamny of the ''Chicago Reader'' shared this negative assessment, writing \"Part of the problem is simply that ''Mona Lisa Smile'' is a Hollywood film, and Hollywood isn't good at depicting the life of the mind... And Julia Roberts is no help--you either like her or you don't, but either way it has little to do with talent. She's not so much an actor as a vessel for earnest reactions. The fact is... It's easier to take on an extremely black-and-white version of the most salient question from this film--can women bake their cake and eat it too?--than try to answer it in the present.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Tamny|first=Elizabeth M.|date=January 15, 2004|title=History Versus Her Story|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/history-versus-her-story/Content?oid=914311|work=Chicago Reader|access-date=September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"What drew the usually astute Mike Newell ('<nowiki/>''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]''<nowiki/>', '<nowiki/>''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]''<nowiki/>') to this project? There are hints that the script (credited to Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner) may once have had more shadings--a suggestion that Katherine's idealism is a form of power-tripping; that she's afraid of intimacy--but any ambiguity is quickly brushed aside to make way for the Julia lovefest. Newell, no hack, tries not to milk the cliches shamelessly, and that may be the movie's final undoing. Lacking the courage of its own vulgarity, '''Mona Lisa Smile''<nowiki/>' is as tepid as old bathwater.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ansen |first=David |date=2003-12-21 |title=Wipe Off That Smile |url=https://www.newsweek.com/wipe-smile-131713 |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=Newsweek |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:35em;\"| Association\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:35em;\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em;\"| Recipient\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Results\n|-\n|[[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics Choice Movie Award]]\n|[[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song|Best Song]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Elton John]]<br />[[Bernie Taupin]]\n|{{Nominated}}\n|-\n|[[Golden Globe Award]]\n|[[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]\n|{{Nominated}}\n|-\n|Phoenix Film Critics Society Award\n|Best Use of Previously Published or Recorded Music\n|{{n/a}}\n|{{Nominated}}\n|-\n|[[Satellite Awards|Satellite Award]]\n|[[Satellite Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]\n|[[Elton John]]\n|{{Nominated}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Award]]\n|[[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress \u2013 Comedy|Choice Movie Actress - Drama/Action-Adventure]]\n|[[Julia Stiles]]\n|{{Nominated}}\n|-\n|[[Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Villain|Choice Movie - Sleazbag]]\n|[[Kirsten Dunst]]\n|{{Nominated}}\n|}\n\n==Reaction from Wellesley and Wellesley alumnae==\nThe college issued an official statement explaining their decision to allow the film to shoot on campus.<ref>{{cite web|date=December 3, 2003|title=Wellesley College Is Among the Stars of the Film, \"Mona Lisa Smile\"|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Releases/2003/120303.html|work=Wellesley College|access-date=September 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn a message to Wellesley alumnae concerning the film, Wellesley College president [[Diana Chapman Walsh]] expressed regret about some of the reactions it generated, given that many alumnae from the 1950s felt that the film's portrayal of Wellesley was inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/President/DCW/Announcements/monalisasmile.html |title=Message from the President to Wellesley College alumnae concerning the film, ''Mona Lisa Smile'' |first1=Diana Chapman |last1=Walsh |date=January 9, 2004 |publisher=Wellesley College |access-date=August 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812084301/http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/President/DCW/Announcements/monalisasmile.html |archive-date=August 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070520072358/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20031209_2865.html Julia Roberts interview for ''Mona Lisa Smile'']\n* {{IMDb title|0304415|Mona Lisa Smile}}\n* {{tcmdb title|457844|Mona Lisa Smile}}\n* {{Allmovie title|283264|Mona Lisa Smile}}\n* {{mojo title|monalisasmile|Mona Lisa Smile}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|mona_lisa_smile|Mona Lisa Smile}}\n\n{{Mike Newell}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mona Lisa Smile}}\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s feminist films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mike Newell]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Rachel Portman]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1953]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Revolution Studios films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films set in universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:2000s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s female buddy films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
