It is the first [[feature-length]] motion picture with both [[synchronization|synchronized]] recorded music score as well as lip-synchronous singing and speech (in several isolated sequences).<!-- \"lip-synchronous\" thwarts claims made by boosters of \"The Photo-Drama of Creation\", and \"Dream Street\" did not have a recorded score --> Its release heralded the commercial ascendance of [[sound film]]s and effectively marked the end of the [[silent film]] era. It was produced by [[Warner Bros.]] with the [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system and features six songs performed by [[Al Jolson]]. Based on the [[The Jazz Singer (play)|1925 play of the same title]] by [[Samson Raphaelson]], the plot  was adapted from his short story \"The Day of Atonement\".\n\nThe film depicts the fictional story of Jakie Rabinowitz, a young man who defies the traditions of his devout [[American Jews|Jewish]] family. After singing popular tunes in a [[beer garden]], he is punished by his father, a [[hazzan]] (cantor), prompting Jakie to run away from home. Some years later, now calling himself Jack Robin, he has become a talented [[jazz]] singer, performing in [[blackface]]. He attempts to build a career as an entertainer, but his professional ambitions ultimately come into conflict with the demands of his home and heritage.\n\n[[Darryl F. Zanuck]] won an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for producing the film; Alfred A. Cohn was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing (Adaptation)]] at the [[1st Academy Awards]]. In 1996, ''The Jazz Singer'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".  In 1998, the film was chosen in voting conducted by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the best American films of all time, ranking at number ninety.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2022}}\n[[hazzan|Cantor]] Rabinowitz wants his son to carry on the generations-old family tradition and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish [[ghetto]] of Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]]. But, thirteen-year-old Jakie Rabinowitz is performing so-called jazz tunes at the [[beer garden]]. Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie's father, who drags him home. Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, \"I'll teach him better than to debase the voice God gave him!\" Jakie threatens: \"If you whip me again, I'll run away\u2014and ''never come back!''\" After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away. At the [[Yom Kippur]] service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, \"My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight\u2014but now I have no son.\" As the sacred [[Kol Nidre]] is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.\n\nAbout ten years later, Jakie has changed his name to the more assimilated Jack Robin. Jack is called up from his table at a cabaret to perform on stage (\"[[Dirty Hands, Dirty Face]]\").\n\nJack wows the crowd with his energized rendition. Afterward, he is introduced to the beautiful Mary Dale, a musical theater dancer. \"There are lots of jazz singers, but ''you'' have a tear in your voice,\" she says, offering to help with his budding career. With her help, Jack eventually gets his big break: a leading part in the new musical ''April Follies''.\n\nBack at the family home Jack left long ago, the elder Rabinowitz instructs a young student in the traditional cantorial art. Jack appears and tries to explain his point of view, and his love of modern music, but the appalled cantor banishes him: \"I never want to see you again\u2014you ''jazz singer!''\" As he leaves, Jack makes a prediction: \"I came home with a heart full of love, but you don't want to understand. Some day you'll understand, the same as Mama does.\"\n\n[[File:JazzSingerJackMother.jpg|thumbnail|Jack and his mother ([[Eugenie Besserer]])]]\n\nTwo weeks after Jack's expulsion from the family home and 24 hours before the opening night of ''April Follies'' on Broadway, Jack's father falls gravely ill. Jack is asked to choose between the show and duty to his family and faith: in order to sing the Kol Nidre for Yom Kippur in his father's place, he will have to miss the big premiere.\n\nThat evening, the eve of Yom Kippur, Yudelson tells the Jewish elders, \"For the first time, we have no Cantor on the Day of Atonement.\" Lying in his bed, weak and gaunt, Cantor Rabinowitz tells Sara that he cannot perform on the most sacred of holy days: \"My son came to me in my dreams\u2014he sang Kol Nidre so beautifully. If he would only sing like that tonight\u2014surely he would be forgiven.\"\n\nAs Jack prepares for a dress rehearsal by applying [[blackface]] makeup, he and Mary discuss his career aspirations and the family pressures they agree he must resist. Sara and Yudelson come to Jack's dressing room to plead for him to come to his father and sing in his stead. Jack is torn. He delivers his blackface performance (\"Mother of Mine, I Still Have You\"), and Sara sees her son on stage for the first time. She has a tearful revelation: \"Here he belongs. If God wanted him in His house, He would have kept him there. He's not ''my'' boy anymore\u2014he belongs to the whole world now.\"\n\n[[Image:Al Jolson Jazz Singer.JPG|left|thumbnail|250px|Jack Robin on stage, in a publicity shot representing the film's final scene]]\n\nAfterward, Jack returns to the Rabinowitz home. He kneels at his father's bedside and the two converse fondly: \"My son\u2014I love you.\" Sara suggests that it may help heal his father if Jack takes his place at the Yom Kippur service. Mary arrives with the producer, who warns Jack that he'll never work on Broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. Jack can't decide. Mary challenges him: \"Were you lying when you said your career came before ''everything?''\" Jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: \"I haven't sung Kol Nidre since I was a little boy.\" His mother tells him, \"Do what is in your heart, Jakie\u2014if you sing and God is not in your voice\u2014your father will know.\" The producer cajoles Jack: \"You're a ''jazz singer'' at heart!\"\n\nAt the theater, the opening night audience is told that there will be no performance. Jack sings the Kol Nidre in his father's place. His father listens from his deathbed to the nearby ceremony and speaks his last, forgiving words: \"Mama, we have our son again.\" The spirit of Jack's father is shown at his side in the synagogue. Mary has come to listen. She sees how Jack has reconciled the division in his soul: \"a jazz singer\u2014singing to his God.\"\n\n\"The season passes\u2014and time heals\u2014the show goes on.\" Jack, as \"The Jazz Singer,\" is now appearing at the Winter Garden theater, apparently as the featured performer opening for a show called ''Back Room''. In the front row of the packed theater, his mother sits alongside Yudelson. Jack, in blackface, performs the song \"[[My Mammy]]\" for her and the world.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jazz Singer lobby card.jpg|thumb|Lobby card]]\n*[[Al Jolson]] as Jakie Rabinowitz (Jack Robin)\n*[[Warner Oland]] as Cantor Rabinowitz\n*[[Eugenie Besserer]] as Sara Rabinowitz\n*[[May McAvoy]] as Mary Dale\n*[[Otto Lederer]] as Moisha Yudelson\n*[[Richard Tucker (actor)|Richard Tucker]] as Harry Lee\n*[[Yossele Rosenblatt]] as himself\n*[[Robert Gordon (director)|Bobby Gordon]] as Jakie Rabinowitz (age 13)\n\n==Songs==\n* \"My Gal Sal\" (music and lyrics by [[Paul Dresser]]; dubbed by unknown singer with Bobby Gordon onscreen)<ref name=B7>Bradley (2004), p. 7.</ref>\n* \"[[Waiting for the Robert E.

The star of the show was a thirty-year-old singer, [[Al Jolson]], a Lithuanian-born Jew who performed in blackface.<ref name=CE>Carringer (1979), p. 11; Eyman (1997), p. 129.</ref> In a 1927 interview, Raphaelson described the experience: \"I shall never forget the first five minutes of Jolson\u2014his velocity, the amazing fluidity with which he shifted from a tremendous absorption in his audience to a tremendous absorption in his song.\" He explained that he had seen emotional intensity like Jolson's only among synagogue cantors.<ref name=CE/>\n\nA few years later, pursuing a professional literary career, Raphaelson wrote \"The Day of Atonement\", a short story about a young Jew named Jakie Rabinowitz, based on Jolson's real life. The story was published in January 1922 in ''[[Everybody's Magazine]]''.<ref>Carringer (1979), pp. 11\u201312.</ref> Raphaelson later adapted the story into a stage play, ''The Jazz Singer''. A straight drama, all the singing in Raphaelson's version takes place offstage.<ref>Carringer (1979), pp. 22, 23.</ref> With [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] in the lead role, the show premiered at the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Warner Theatre]] in [[Times Square]] on September 1925 and became a hit.<ref>Bloom (2004), p. 229.</ref> [[Warner Bros.]] acquired the movie rights to the play on June 4, 1926, and signed Jessel to a contract.<ref name=B6>Bradley (2004), p. 6.</ref> ''[[The Moving Picture World]]'' published a story in February 1927 announcing that production on the film would begin with Jessel on May 1.<ref name=\"C16\">Carringer (1979), p. 16.</ref>[[File:Jolson-RobinsonCrusoe.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A blackfaced [[Al Jolson]] starring in ''Robinson Crusoe, Jr.''\u2014the performance that inspired the story that led to the play that became the film ''The Jazz Singer'']]\n\nBut the plans to make the film with Jessel would fall through, for multiple reasons. Jessel's contract with Warner Bros. had not anticipated that the movie they had particularly signed him for would be made with sound (he'd made a modestly budgeted, silent comedy in the interim). When Warner had hits with two [[Vitaphone]], though dialogue-less, features in late 1926, ''The Jazz Singer'' production had been reconceived.<ref name=B6/> Jessel asked for a bonus or a new contract, but was rebuffed. According to Jessel's description in his autobiography, [[Harry Warner]] \"was having a tough time with the financing of the company.... He talked about taking care of me if the picture was a success. I did not feel that was enough.\"<ref>Jessel (2006), p. 88.</ref> In fact, around the beginning of 1927, Harry Warner\u2014the eldest of the brothers who ran the eponymous studio\u2014had sold $4 million of his personal stock to keep the studio solvent.<ref name=B6/> Then came another major issue. According to Jessel, a first read of screenwriter [[Alfred A. Cohn]]'s adaptation \"threw me into a fit. Instead of the boy's leaving the theatre and following the traditions of his father by singing in the synagogue, as in the play, the picture scenario had him return to the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] as a blackface comedian, with his mother wildly applauding in the box. I raised hell. Money or no money, I would not do this.\"<ref>Jessel (2006), p. 88. See also Bradley (2004), p. 6; Carringer (1979), p. 17.</ref>\n\nAccording to performer [[Eddie Cantor]], as negotiations between Warner Bros. and Jessel floundered, [[Jack L. Warner]] and the studio's production chief, [[Darryl Zanuck]], called to see if he was interested in the part. Cantor, a friend of Jessel's, responded that he was sure any differences with the actor could be worked out and offered his assistance.<ref>Cantor (1957), p. 91.</ref> Cantor was not invited to participate in the Jessel talks; instead, the role was then offered to Jolson, who had inspired it in the first place. Describing Jolson as the production's best choice for its star, film historian Donald Crafton wrote, \"The entertainer, who sang jazzed-up minstrel numbers in blackface, was at the height of his phenomenal popularity. Anticipating the later stardom of crooners and rock stars, Jolson electrified audiences with the vitality and sex appeal of his songs and gestures, which owed much to black american sources.\"<ref>Crafton (1999), pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> As described by film historian Robert L. Carringer, \"Jessel was a [[vaudeville]] comedian and master of ceremonies with one successful play and one modestly successful film to his credit. Jolson was a superstar.\"<ref>Carringer (1979), p. 17.</ref> Jolson took the part, signing a $75,000 contract on May 26, 1927, for eight weeks of services beginning in July.<ref>Carringer (1979), p. 18.</ref> There have been several claims but no proof that Jolson invested some of his own money in the film.<ref>Carringer (1979), pp. 18\u201319; Bradley (2004), p. 7.</ref> Jessel and Jolson, also friends, did not speak for some time after\u2014on the one hand, Jessel had been confiding his problems with the Warners to Jolson; on the other, Jolson had signed with them without telling Jessel of his plans. In his autobiography, Jessel wrote that, in the end, Jolson \"must not be blamed, as the Warners had definitely decided that I was out.\"<ref>Jessel (2006), p. 88. See also Bradley (2004), p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Introduction of sound===\nWhile many earlier sound films had dialogue, all were short subjects. [[D. W. Griffith]]'s feature ''[[Dream Street (film)|Dream Street]]'' (1921) was shown in New York with a single singing sequence and crowd noises, using the [[sound-on-disc]] system [[Photokinema]]. The film was preceded by a program of sound shorts, including a sequence with Griffith speaking directly to the audience, but the feature itself had no talking scenes.<ref>Bradley (2004), p. 4.</ref> On April 15, 1923, [[Lee De Forest]] introduced the [[sound-on-film]] system [[Phonofilm]], which had synchronized sound and dialogue, but the sound quality was poor, and the films produced in this process were short films only.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crafton|first=Donald|date=1999|title=The Talkies: American Cinema's Transition to Sound, 1926\u20131931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFB_oT-jupQC&q=the+gavotte|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=University of California Press|page=65|isbn=0-520-22128-1}}</ref>\n\nThe first Warner Bros. Vitaphone features, ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]'' (premiered August 1926) and ''[[The Better 'Ole (1926 film)|The Better 'Ole]]'' (premiered October 1926), like three more that followed in early 1927 (''[[When a Man Loves]]'', ''[[Old San Francisco]]'', and ''[[The First Auto]]''), had only a synchronized instrumental score and sound effects. ''The Jazz Singer'' contains those, as well as numerous synchronized singing sequences and some synchronized speech: Two popular tunes are performed by the young Jakie Rabinowitz, the future Jazz Singer; his father, a cantor, performs the devotional [[Kol Nidre]]; the famous cantor [[Yossele Rosenblatt]], appearing as himself, sings an excerpt of another religious melody, [[Kaddish]], and the song \"Yahrzeit Licht\". As the adult Jack Robin, Jolson performs six songs: five popular \"jazz\" tunes and the Kol Nidre. The sound for the film was recorded by British-born [[George Groves (sound engineer)|George Groves]], who had also worked on ''Don Juan''. To direct, the studio chose [[Alan Crosland]], who already had two Vitaphone films to his credit: ''Don Juan'' and ''Old San Francisco'', which opened while ''The Jazz Singer'' was in production.{{cn|date=September 2022}}\n{{listen|filename=Jolson-WaitAMinute.ogg|title=\"Wait a minute, wait a minute...\"| description= The spoken words that made movie history (over considerable crowd noise) and the opening of \"[[Toot, Toot, Tootsie (Goo' Bye!)|Toot, Toot, Tootsie (Goo' Bye)]]\" |format=[[Ogg]]}}\nJolson's first vocal performance, about fifteen minutes into the picture, is of \"[[Dirty Hands, Dirty Face]]\", with music by [[James V. Monaco]] and lyrics by [[Edgar Leslie]] and [[Grant Clarke]]. The first synchronized speech, uttered by Jack to a cabaret crowd and to the piano player in the band that accompanies him, occurs directly after that performance, beginning at the 17:25 mark of the film. Jack's first spoken words\u2014\"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet\"\u2014were well-established stage patter of Jolson's. He had even spoken very similar lines in an earlier short, ''[[A Plantation Act|Al Jolson in \"A Plantation Act.\"]]'' (1926)<ref>{{cite web|author=Kehr, Dave|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/movies/homevideo/16dvd.html?_r=1&|title=New DVDs: ''The Jazz Singer''|work=The New York Times|date=October 16, 2007|access-date=October 16, 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6F1HM3Xpv?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/movies/homevideo/16dvd.html?_r=1&|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The line had become virtually an in-joke. In November 1918, during a gala concert celebrating the end of World War I, Jolson ran onstage amid the applause for the preceding performer, the great operatic tenor [[Enrico Caruso]], and exclaimed, \"Folks, you ain't heard nothin' yet.\"<ref>Bloom (2004), p. 266.</ref> The following year, he recorded the song \"You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet\".<ref>Rees (1999), p. 261.</ref> In a later scene, Jack talks with his mother, played by [[Eugenie Besserer]], in the family parlor; his father enters and pronounces one very conclusive word, \"Stop!\"\n\nIn total, the movie contains barely two minutes' worth of synchronized talking, much or all of it improvised. The rest of the dialogue is presented through the caption cards, or [[intertitles]], standard in silent movies of the era; as was common, those titles were composed not by the film's scenarist, Alfred Cohn, but by another writer&nbsp;\u2013 in this case, Jack Jarmuth.<ref name=block-wilson/>\n\nWhile Jolson was touring with a stage show during June 1927, production on ''The Jazz Singer'' began with the shooting of exterior scenes by the [[second unit]]. In late June, Alan Crosland headed to New York City to shoot the Lower East Side and Winter Garden exteriors on location. Jolson joined the production in mid-July (his contract specified July 11). Filming with Jolson began with his silent scenes; the more complex Vitaphone sequences were primarily done in late August.<ref>Carringer (1979), pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Both Jolson and Zanuck would later take credit for thinking up the ad-libbed dialogue sequence between Jack and his mother; another story had it that [[Sam Warner]] was impressed by Jolson's brief ad-libbing in the cabaret scene and had Cohn come up with some lines on the spot.<ref name=C110>Crafton (1999), p. 110.</ref> On September 23, ''Motion Picture News'' reported that production on the film had been completed.<ref>Carringer (1979), p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe production cost for ''The Jazz Singer'' was $422,000<ref name=Crafton111>Crafton (1999), p. 111.</ref> (approximately US${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US-GDP|422000|1927}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars),<ref name=block-wilson/> a large sum, especially for Warner Bros., which rarely spent more than $250,000. It was by no means a record for the studio, however; two features starring [[John Barrymore]] had been costlier: ''[[The Sea Beast (1926 film)|The Sea Beast]]'' (1926), a loose and entirely silent adaptation of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', at $503,000 and ''Don Juan'' at $546,000.<ref>Glancy (1995) [pp. 2, 4 online]. Both Schatz (1998), p. 63, and Gomery (2005), p. 44 (possibly relying on Schatz), claim ''The Jazz Singer'' cost $500,000 and was the most expensive picture in Warners history. Glancy's and Crafton's well-sourced figures belie those claims.</ref> Nonetheless, the outlay constituted a major gamble in light of the studio's financial straits: while ''The Jazz Singer'' was in production, Harry Warner stopped taking a salary, pawned jewelry belonging to his wife, and moved his family into a smaller apartment.<ref>Eyman (1997), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==Premiere and reception==\n[[File:The Jazz Singer (1927) - Trailer.webm|thumb|thumbtime=108|Original [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] of ''The Jazz Singer'']]\nThe premiere occurred on October 6, 1927, at Warner Bros.' flagship theater in New York City. In keeping with the film's theme of a conflict within a Jewish family, the film premiered after sunset on the eve of the [[Yom Kippur]] holiday.<ref>Crafton (1999), p. 109.</ref> The buildup to the premiere was tense. Besides Warner Bros.' precarious financial position, the physical presentation of the film itself was remarkably complex:<blockquote>Each of Jolson's musical numbers was mounted on a separate reel with a separate accompanying sound disc. Even though the film was only eighty-nine minutes long...there were fifteen reels and fifteen discs to manage, and the projectionist had to be able to thread the film and cue up the Vitaphone records very quickly. The least stumble, hesitation, or human error would result in public and financial humiliation for the company.<ref name=E140>Eyman (1997), p. 140.</ref></blockquote> None of the four Warner brothers<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Warner Sperling, Cass (Director) |date=2008 |url=http://www.warnersisters.com/ourstore.html |title=The Brothers Warner (DVD film documentary) |publisher=Warner Sisters, Inc. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217043304/http://www.warnersisters.com/ourstore.html |archive-date=February 17, 2016 }}</ref> were able to attend: [[Sam Warner]]\u2014among them, the strongest advocate for Vitaphone\u2014had died the previous day of pneumonia, and the surviving brothers had returned to California for his funeral.<ref name=C110/>\n\nAccording to Doris Warner, who was in attendance, about halfway through the film she began to feel that something exceptional was taking place. Suddenly, Jolson's face appeared in big close-up, and said \"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothing yet!\" Jolson's \"Wait a minute\" line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing and hearing someone speak on a film for the first time, so much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. Applause followed each of his songs. Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, \"the audience became hysterical.\"<ref>Eyman (1997), p. 139. See also Kroll (1997).</ref> After the show, the audience turned into a \"milling, battling, mob\", in one journalist's description, chanting \"Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!\"<ref name=E140/> Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's [[Robert E. Sherwood]]. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as \"fraught with tremendous significance.... I for one suddenly realized that the end of the silent drama is in sight\".<ref name=E141>Eyman (1997), p. 141.</ref>\n\nCritical reaction was generally, though far from universally, positive. ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Mordaunt Hall]], reviewing the film's premiere, declared that\n\n<blockquote>not since the first presentation of Vitaphone features, more than a year ago [i.e., ''Don Juan''], has anything like the ovation been heard in a motion-picture theatre.... The Vitaphoned songs and some dialogue have been introduced most adroitly. This in itself is an ambitious move, for in the expression of song the Vitaphone vitalizes the production enormously.

Without his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] reputation he wouldn't rate as a minor player.\"<ref name=E141/>\n\n==Commercial impact and industrial influence==\nThe film developed into a major hit, demonstrating the profit potential of feature-length \"[[sound film|talkies]]\", but Donald Crafton has shown that the reputation the film later acquired for being one of Hollywood's most enormous successes to date was inflated. The movie did well, but not astonishingly so, in the major cities where it was first released, garnering much of its impressive profits with long, steady runs in population centers large and small all around the country. As conversion of movie theaters to sound was still in its early stages, the film actually arrived at many of those secondary venues in a silent version. On the other hand, Crafton's statement that ''The Jazz Singer'' \"was in a distinct second or third tier of attractions compared to the most popular films of the day and even other Vitaphone talkies\" is also incorrect.<ref>Crafton (1999), p. 529.</ref> In fact, the film was easily the biggest earner in Warner Bros. history, and would remain so until it was surpassed a year later by ''[[The Singing Fool]]'', another Jolson feature. In the larger scope of Hollywood, among films originally released in 1927, available evidence suggests that ''The Jazz Singer'' was among the three biggest box office hits, trailing only ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' and, perhaps, ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]''.{{efn-ua|For the following earnings of ''Don Juan'', ''The Jazz Singer'', and other early Vitaphone features, see Glancy (1995) [pp. 4\u20135 online] (and, for the domestic earnings of ''The Jazz Singer'', Crafton [1999], p. 528). Unlike the total box office revenue figures estimated in the main text, the following figures refer to the studio's share:\n*''Don Juan'' (non-talking)/premiered August 6, 1926: $1.695 million total (domestic & foreign) [new Warner Bros. record]\n*::Thomas Schatz (1998) claims that ''Don Juan'' \"was much less successful than the previous Barrymore vehicle, ''The Sea Beast''\" (p. 63). This claim is belied by Glancy's figures, which show total earnings of $938,000 for ''The Sea Beast'' [p. 2 online].\n*''The Better 'Ole'' (non-talking)/premiered October 7, 1926: just over $1 million total (dom. & for.)\n*''When a Man Loves'' (non-talking)/premiered February 3, 1927: just over $1 million total (dom. & for.)\n*''Old San Francisco'' (non-talking)/premiered June 21, 1927: $638,000 total (dom. & for.)\n*''The Jazz Singer'' (part-talkie)/premiered October 6, 1927: $2.625 million total (dom. & for.) [new Warner Bros. record]/$1.97 million domestic\n*::These figures apparently include earnings from the film's 1931 re-release. While no authoritative source has broken out those numbers from those of the initial release, even if they constitute as much as 25 percent of the total (a generous assumption), ''The Jazz Singer'' still set a Warner Bros. record in its initial release and was one of the top films of the 1927\u201328 exhibition season.\n*''Tenderloin'' (part-talkie)/premiered March 14, 1928: just under $1 million total (dom. & for.)\n*''Glorious Betsy'' (part-talkie)/premiered April 26, 1928: just under $1 million total (dom. & for.)\n*''The Lion and the Mouse'' (part-talkie)/premiered May 21, 1928: just under $1 million total (dom. & for.)\n*''Lights of New York'' (all-talking)/premiered July 6, 1928: $1.252 million total (dom. & for.)\n*''The Singing Fool'' (part-talkie)/premiered September 19, 1928: $5.916 million total (dom. & for.) [new Warner Bros. record]\nScholar James Mark Purcell ranks the attendance of 1927's top three films in the following order: ''Wings'', ''The Jazz Singer'', ''The King of Kings'' (see Koszarski [1994], p. 33). For the earnings of ''The King of Kings'', see also {{cite web|author=David Pierce|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/10_dwp_3.htm|title=Costs and Grosses for the Early Films of Cecil B. DeMille|publisher=Cinemaweb|work=The Silent Film Bookshelf|year=1991|access-date=February 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402044451/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/10_dwp_3.htm|archive-date=April 2, 2010|url-status=dead}} Pierce states that it \"seems likely that the gross numbers\" he conveys are actually \"income after deduction of distribution costs\"; he says, as well, that it is unclear if the $2.64 million figure he reports for ''The King of Kings'' is total or only domestic. Note that his article correctly dates the film as 1927 in its main text and incorrectly as 1926 in the relevant table. Reported figures for ''Wings'' differ widely, but a survey of anecdotal accounts and a triangulation of box office claims combine to suggest\u2014in accord with Purcell\u2014that it was a slightly bigger smash than ''The Jazz Singer''.}} According to Warner Bros records the film earned revenues of $1,974,000 in the United States and Canada,<ref>Crafton (1999), p. 549.</ref> and $651,000 elsewhere,<ref name=\"warners\"/> for a worldwide theatrical [[gross rental]] of approximately $2.6 million (the studio's share of the box office gross) and a profit of $1,196,750.<ref name=block-wilson>Block and Wilson (2010), pp. 110\u2013113.</ref>\n\nOne of the keys to the film's success was an innovative marketing scheme conceived by Sam Morris, Warner Bros.' sales manager. In Crafton's description:\n\n<blockquote>[A] special clause in Warners' Vitaphone exhibition contract virtually guaranteed long runs. Theaters had to book ''The Jazz Singer'' for full rather than split weeks. Instead of the traditional flat rental fee, Warners took a percentage of the gate. A sliding scale meant that the exhibitor's take increased the longer the film was held over. The signing of this contract by the greater New York [[Fox Theatres]] circuit was regarded as a headline-making precedent.<ref name=Crafton111/></blockquote>\n\nSimilar arrangements, based on a percentage of the gross rather than flat rental fees, would soon become standard for the U.S. film industry's high-end or \"A\" product.\n\n[[File:Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer - NYPL ps the cd26 386.jpg|thumb|left|210px|One of many alternative posters\u2014this one designed for theaters charging 25 cents; the image of Jack, in a suggestive nightrobe, carrying Mary does appear in the film. It appears shortly after Jack sees Mary perform for the first time.]]\n\nThough in retrospect it is understood that the success of ''The Jazz Singer'' signaled the end of the [[silent film|silent motion-picture]] era, this was not immediately apparent. Mordaunt Hall, for example, praised Warner Bros. for \"astutely realiz[ing] that a film conception of ''The Jazz Singer'' was one of the few subjects that would lend itself to the use of the Vitaphone.\"<ref name=\"Hall 1927\"/> In historian Richard Koszarski's words, \"Silent films did not disappear overnight, nor did talking films immediately flood the theaters.... Nevertheless, 1927 remains the year that Warner Bros. moved to close the book on the history of silent pictures, even if their original goal had been somewhat more modest.\"<ref>Koszarski (1994), p. 90.</ref>\n\nThe film had other effects that were more immediate. George Jessel, who was in his third season touring with the stage production of ''The Jazz Singer'', later described what happened to his show\u2014perhaps anticipating how sound would soon cement Hollywood's dominance of the American entertainment industry: \"A week or two after the Washington engagement the sound-and-picture version of ''The Jazz Singer'' with Al Jolson was sweeping the country, and I was swept out of business. I couldn't compete with a picture theatre across the street showing the first great sound picture in the world...for fifty cents, while the price at my theatre was $3.00.\"<ref>Jessel (2006), p. 91. See Finler (1988), p. 34, for growth in film industry's share of U.S. recreation spending.</ref>\n\nAs the truly pivotal event, Crafton points to the national release of the film's sound version in early 1928\u2014he dates it to January,<ref name=Crafton111/> Block and Wilson to February 4.<ref name=block-wilson/> In March, Warners announced that ''The Jazz Singer'' was playing at a record 235 theaters (though many could still show it only silently).<ref name=Crafton111/> In May, a consortium including the leading Hollywood studios signed up with [[Western Electric]]'s licensing division, ERPI, for sound conversion. In July, Warner Bros. released the first all-talking feature, ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'', a musical crime melodrama. On September 27, ''The Jazz Singer'' became the first feature-length talking picture to be shown in Europe when it premiered at London's [[Piccadilly Theatre]]. The movie \"created a sensation\", according to British film historian [[Rachael Low]]. \"''The Jazz Singer'' was a turning point [for the introduction of sound]. ''The Bioscope'' greeted it with, 'We are inclined to wonder why we ever called them Living Pictures.'\"<ref>Low (1997), p. 203. It premiered the same month in Berlin, but as a silent.</ref> The Paris sound premiere followed in January 1929.<ref>Crisp (1997), p. 101.</ref>\n\nBefore the [[1st Academy Awards]] ceremony was held in May 1929, honoring films released between August 1927 and July 1928, ''The Jazz Singer'' was ruled ineligible for the two top prizes\u2014[[Academy Award for Best Picture|the Outstanding Picture, Production and the Unique and Artistic Production]]\u2014on the basis that it would have been unfair competition for the silent pictures under consideration.<ref name=block-wilson/> By mid-1929, Hollywood was producing almost exclusively sound films; by the end of the following year, the same was true in much of Western Europe. Jolson went on to make a series of movies for Warners, including ''The Singing Fool'', a part-talkie, and the all-talking features ''[[Say It with Songs]]'' (1929), ''[[Mammy (1930 film)|Mammy]]'' (1930), and ''Big Boy'' (1930).\n\n==Critical analysis==\n[[Image:McAvoyJolsonJazzSinger.jpg|thumb|283px|Mary ([[May McAvoy]]) and Jack, preparing for dress rehearsal: the first blackface scene]]\n\nJack Robin's use of [[blackface]] in his Broadway stage act\u2014a common practice at the time, which is now widely condemned as racist<ref name=Kenrick>{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Kenrick|url=http://www.musicals101.com/blackface.htm|website=Musicals 101|title=Blackface and Old Wounds|access-date=May 25, 2016}}</ref>\u2014is the primary focus of many ''Jazz Singer'' studies. Its crucial and unusual role is described by scholar Corin Willis:\n\n<blockquote>In contrast to the racial jokes and innuendo brought out in its subsequent persistence in early sound film, blackface imagery in ''The Jazz Singer'' is at the core of the film's central theme, an expressive and artistic exploration of the notion of duplicity and ethnic hybridity within American identity. Of the more than seventy examples of blackface in early sound film 1927\u201353 that I have viewed (including the nine blackface appearances Jolson subsequently made), ''The Jazz Singer'' is unique in that it is the only film where blackface is central to the narrative development and thematic expression.<ref>Willis (2005), p. 127.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe function and meaning of blackface in the film is intimately involved with Jack's own Jewish heritage and his desire to make his mark in mass American culture\u2014much as the ethnically Jewish Jolson and the Warner brothers were doing themselves. Jack Robin \"compounds both tradition and stardom. The Warner Brothers thesis is that, really to succeed, a man must first acknowledge his ethnic self,\" argues W. T. Lhamon. \"[T]he whole film builds toward the blacking-up scene at the dress rehearsal. Jack Robin needs the blackface mask as the agency of his compounded identity. Blackface will hold all the identities together without freezing them in a singular relationship or replacing their parts.\"<ref>Lhamon (1998), pp. 109, 110.</ref>\n\nSeymour Stark's view is less sanguine. In describing Jolson's extensive experience performing in blackface in stage musicals, he asserts, \"The immigrant Jew as Broadway star...works within a blackface minstrel tradition that obscures his Jewish pedigree, but proclaims his white identity. Jolson's slight Yiddish accent was hidden by a Southern veneer.\"<ref>Stark (2000), p. 112.</ref> Arguing that ''The Jazz Singer'' actually avoids honestly dealing with the tension between American assimilation and Jewish identity, he claims that its \"covert message...is that the symbol of blackface provides the Jewish immigrant with the same rights and privileges accorded to earlier generations of European immigrants initiated into the rituals of the minstrel show.\"<ref>Stark (2000), p. 116.</ref>\n\nLisa Silberman Brenner contradicts this view. She returns to the intentions expressed by Samson Raphaelson, on whose play the film's script was closely based: \"For Raphaelson, jazz is prayer, American style, and the blackface minstrel the new Jewish cantor. Based on the author's own words, the play is about blackface as a means for Jews to express a new kind of Jewishness, that of the modern American Jew.\"<ref>Brenner (2003) [p. 1 online].</ref> She observes that during the same period, the Jewish press was noting with pride that Jewish performers were adopting aspects of African American music.\n\nAccording to Scott Eyman, the film \"marks one of the few times Hollywood Jews allowed themselves to contemplate their own central cultural myth, and the conundrums that go with it. ''The Jazz Singer'' implicitly celebrates the ambition and drive needed to escape the ''[[shtetl]]s'' of Europe and the ghettos of New York City, and the attendant hunger for recognition. Jack, Sam, and Harry [Warner] let Jack Robin have it all: the satisfaction of taking his father's place ''and'' of conquering the Winter Garden. They were, perhaps unwittingly, dramatizing some of their own ambivalence about the debt first-generation Americans owed their parents.\"<ref>Eyman (1997), p. 142.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThree subsequent screen versions of ''The Jazz Singer'' have been produced: a [[The Jazz Singer (1952 film)|1952 remake]], starring [[Danny Thomas]] and [[Peggy Lee]];<ref>See Gabbard (1996), pp. 46\u201348.</ref> a [[The Jazz Singer (Ford Startime)|1959 television remake]], starring [[Jerry Lewis]]; and a [[The Jazz Singer (1980 film)|1980 remake]] starring [[Neil Diamond]], [[Lucie Arnaz]], and [[Laurence Olivier]].<ref>See Gabbard (1996), pp. 46\u201349.</ref> ''The Jazz Singer'' was adapted as a one-hour radio play on two broadcasts of [[Lux Radio Theatre]], both starring Al Jolson, reprising his screen role. The first aired August 10, 1936; the second, also starring [[Gail Patrick]], on June 2, 1947.<ref>Siegel & Siegel (2007), p. 195</ref>\n\n''The Jazz Singer'' was parodied as early as 1936, in the Warner Bros. cartoon ''[[I Love to Singa]]'', directed by [[Tex Avery]]. Its hero is \"Owl Jolson\", a young owl who croons popular ditties, such as the title song, against the wishes of his father, a classical music teacher.<ref>Gabbard (1996), pp. 49\u201350; Rogin (1998), pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Among the many references to ''The Jazz Singer'' in popular culture, perhaps the most significant is that of the [[MGM]] musical ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952). The story, set in 1927, revolves around efforts to change a silent film production, ''The Dueling Cavalier'', into a talking picture in response to ''The Jazz Singer''{{'}}s success.  At one point Donald O'Connor's character suggests a new name for the now-musical, \"I've got it! 'The Dueling Mammy'.\"  The plot of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Like Father, Like Clown]]\" (1991) parallels the tale of Jakie Rabinowitz/Jack Robin.<ref>Gabbard (1996), p. 49.</ref> [[Krusty the Clown]]'s rabbi father disapproves of his son's choice to be a comedian, telling him, \"You have brought shame on our family! Oh, if you were a musician or a jazz singer, this I could forgive.\"<ref>Stratton (2000), p. 282, n. 47.</ref>\n\nAccording to film historian Krin Gabbard, ''The Jazz Singer'' \"provides the basic narrative for the lives of jazz and popular musicians in the movies. If this argument means that sometime after 1959 the narrative must belong to pop rockers, it only proves the power of the original 1927 film to determine how Hollywood tells the stories of popular musicians.\"<ref>Gabbard (1996), p. 66.</ref> More broadly, he also suggests that this \"seemingly unique film\" has \"become a paradigm for American success stories.\"<ref>Gabbard (1996), p. 63.</ref> More specifically, he examines a cycle of [[biopics]] of white jazz musicians stretching from ''[[Birth of the Blues]]'' (1941) to ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' (1959) that trace their roots to ''The Jazz Singer''.<ref>Gabbard (1996), p. 76.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, ''The Jazz Singer'' was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] of \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" motion pictures.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref> In 1998, the film was chosen in voting conducted by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the best American films of all time, ranking at number ninety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/movies.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|publisher=American Film Institute|year=1998|access-date=August 3, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711032427/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/movies.aspx|archive-date=July 11, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2007, a three-disc deluxe [[DVD-Video|DVD]] edition of the film was released.
