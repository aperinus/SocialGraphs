Taylor]] and [[Ernest Lehman]] from Taylor's 1953 play ''[[Sabrina Fair]]''.<ref name=\"Sabrina\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16295/sabrina#credits |title=Sabrina|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=September 22, 2022}}</ref> The picture stars [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[William Holden]]. This was Wilder's last film released by [[Paramount Pictures]], ending a 12-year business relationship between him and the company.\n\nIn 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0301/films2.html|title=Films Selected for the National Film Registry in 2002 (January 2003) - Library of Congress Information Bulletin}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Holden-Hepburn-Sabrina.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Audrey Hepburn|Hepburn]] and [[William Holden|Holden]]]]\nSabrina Fairchild is the young daughter of the Larrabee family's [[chauffeur]], Thomas, and has been in love with David Larrabee all her life. David, a three-times-married non-working playboy, has never paid romantic attention to Sabrina. Since she has lived for years on the Larrabees' Long Island, New York, estate with her father, to him she is still a child.\n\nEavesdropping on a party at the mansion the night before she is to leave to attend the [[Le Cordon Bleu]] cooking school in Paris, Sabrina watches, follows, and listens as David entices yet another woman into a dark and vacant indoor tennis court. Distraught, she leaves her father a suicide note and then starts all eight cars in the closed garage in order to kill herself. She is passing out from the fumes when Linus, David's older brother, opens the door, discovers her, and carries her back to her quarters above the garage when she does pass out.\n\nAfter two years in Paris, Sabrina returns home an attractive sophisticated woman. When her father is delayed from picking her up at the station, flirtatious David, passing by, offers her a lift without recognizing her. She accepts.\n\nOnce David realizes who she is, he is quickly drawn to Sabrina and invites her to join him at a party at the mansion, and then later invites her to the indoor tennis court. When Linus sees this, he fears that David's imminent marriage to Elizabeth Tyson may be endangered. If that engagement were broken it would ruin a profitable opportunity for a great corporate merger between Larrabee Industries and Elizabeth's very wealthy father's business. Instead of confronting David about his irresponsibility, Linus pretends to sympathize with him. Linus manipulates David to sit down on champagne glasses he has placed in his pockets, and David is incapacitated for a few days.\n\nLinus now takes David's place with Sabrina on the pretext that \u201cit\u2019s all in the family.\u201d Linus and Sabrina fall in love, though neither will admit it. Linus\u2019s plan is to pretend to accompany Sabrina back to Paris on an [[ocean liner]] but then not join her on the ship, getting her away from David, the family, and the now-threatened merger. However, when Linus instead confesses these intentions to Sabrina, she is hurt but understands the logic of the tactic. She agrees to sail the next day to live in Paris, but without Linus's offered money and other inducements.\n\nThe following morning Linus has second thoughts, and decides to send David to Paris with Sabrina. This means calling off David's wedding with Elizabeth and the big Tyson deal, and Linus schedules a meeting of the Larrabee board to announce this. David doesn't sail, and enters the meeting room at the last minute. He shows that he will marry Elizabeth after all, and helps Linus recognize his own feelings for Sabrina by insulting her and letting Linus punch him in the face. Linus, who has already arranged a car and a tugboat to wait for David, assists him to rush off and joins Sabrina's ship before it leaves the harbor. Linus seeks out Sabrina on board after providing an inside-joke hint that he is there, and they sail away to Paris together.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Linus Larrabee\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Sabrina Fairchild\n* [[William Holden]] as David Larrabee\n* [[Walter Hampden]] as Oliver Larrabee, Linus and David's father\n* [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as Thomas Fairchild, Sabrina's father\n* [[Martha Hyer]] as Elizabeth Tyson, David's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Joan Vohs]] as Gretchen Van Horn\n* [[Marcel Dalio]] as Baron St. Fontanel\n* [[Marcel Hillaire]] as The Professor, Sabrina's culinary instructor\n* [[Nella Walker]] as Maude Larrabee, Linus and David's mother\n* [[Francis X.

Best known for playing tough detectives and adventurers, Bogart was cast against type as a smart businessman gradually transformed into a romantic lead.\n\nDuring production of the film, Hepburn and Holden entered into a brief but passionate and much-publicized love affair. Bogart had originally wanted his wife [[Lauren Bacall]] to be cast as Sabrina. He complained that Hepburn required too many takes to get her dialogue right and pointed out her inexperience.<ref name=\"auto\">Ben Mankiewicz of Turner Classic Movies.</ref>\n\nBogart was unhappy during the filming, convinced that he was totally wrong for this kind of film, mad at not being Wilder's first choice, and not liking Holden or Wilder.  But Wilder's offbeat casting produced a performance that critics generally considered successful. Bogart later apologized to Wilder for his behavior on set, citing problems in his personal life. {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nWilder began shooting before the script was finished, and Lehman was writing all day to complete it. Eventually he would finish a scene in the morning, deliver it during lunch, and filming of it would begin in the afternoon.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n[[File:Edith Head costume designs for Audrey Hepburn in 1954 film \"Sabrina.\".jpg|thumb|upright|Sketches for skirt, blouse, and apron by [[Edith Head]] for Audrey Hepburn in ''Sabrina'']]\n\nAlthough [[Edith Head]] won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costumes]], most of Hepburn's outfits are rumored to have been created by [[Hubert de Givenchy]] and chosen personally by the star.
