The film centers on a married couple's investigation of the death of their neighbor's wife.\n\nThe film began as an early draft of ''[[Annie Hall]]'', which Allen co-wrote with Brickman. Eventually, the script evolved and principal photography took place in 1992, in the titular city. It was released in August 1993 to positive reviews. Keaton was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]]. This film marked the eighth, and most recent, collaboration between Allen and Keaton.\n\n==Plot==\nLarry Lipton and his wife Carol meet their older neighbors Paul and Lillian House in the elevator in a pleasant encounter. The following night, Lillian is found to have died of a heart attack. The Liptons are surprised by the death because she seemed so healthy and are suspicious of Paul's cheerfulness so soon after his wife's death. Carol starts to investigate, even inventing an excuse to visit him. An urn she finds in Paul's apartment contradicts his story that Lillian had been buried. Larry becomes frustrated with Carol, telling her she's \"inventing a mystery\". Carol sneaks into Paul's apartment while he's away and finds more telling signs. Lillian's urn is missing, there are two tickets to Paris and hotel reservations with a woman named Helen Moss. Carol calls Ted, a close friend who agrees with Carol's suspicions and urges her to keep snooping. When Paul returns unexpectedly, Carol hides under the bed and overhears Paul's conversation with a woman who she suspects is Helen Moss.\n\nTed tracks down where Helen Moss lives, and with Carol and Larry, they follow her to a theater owned by Paul. They discover that Helen is a young actress and eavesdrop on them talking about money. A few days later, Carol spots a woman who's a dead ringer for the supposedly dead Lillian on a passing bus. Upon Larry's suggestion that she has a twin, Ted investigates but finds Lillian has none. Larry and Carol follow her to a hotel and, under the pretense of delivering a personal gift, they enter her hotel room, but find her lying dead on the bedroom floor. They call the police, who subsequently find no trace of the dead body. The Liptons search the room for clues. While leaving, they get trapped in the lift and accidentally stumble across Lillian's body inside the emergency exit panel. At that moment, the lights go out and the Liptons stumble into the basement in pitch darkness. Upon exiting to the street, they spot Paul putting the body in the trunk of his car. They follow him to a junk yard where they witness him disposing of the body into a melting furnace.\n\nThe Liptons meet Ted and Larry's friend and client Marcia Fox and hatch a plan to bring Paul to justice by telling him they retrieved Lillian's body from the furnace and tricking Helen into a fake audition where her voice is recorded, edited, and later used to harass Paul, by demanding he give Larry and Carol $200,000 or kill them if he wanted everything covered up. Marcia also tells them her theory that the dead body in the apartment is Lillian's rich sister who looked similar to her and that when she visited the Houses she had a heart attack. They then took advantage of the situation by claiming Lillian had died so that they could profit from her will. However Paul double-crossed Lillian and killed her so that he could run away with Helen who he had been having an affair with.\n\nThe plan backfires as Paul kidnaps Carol and calls Larry, demanding Lillian's body, in exchange for Carol. Paul and Larry meet in the theater and get into a scuffle. Larry breaks free and searches for Carol, with Paul in pursuit. An array of mirrors and glass behind the theater reflect the film being screened ([[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'') and mislead Paul several times. Suddenly, Paul's loyal assistant Mrs. Dalton, an older paramour earlier brushed aside by him in favor of Helen, shoots him in an exchange of gunfire. Larry rescues Carol and they call the police. After the cops arrive, Marcia discusses with Ted that her theory was correct and they arrange to have dinner together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Carol Lipton\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Larry Lipton\n* [[Alan Alda]] as Ted\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Marcia Fox\n* [[Jerry Adler]] as Paul House\n* [[Lynn Cohen]] as Lillian House\n* Melanie Norris as Helen Moss\n* [[Marge Redmond]] as Mrs. Dalton\n* [[Joy Behar]] as Marilyn\n* [[Ron Rifkin]] as Sy\n* [[Zach Braff]] as Nick Lipton\n* [[Sylvia Kauders]] as Neighbour\n* [[Vincent Pastore]] as Man in restaurant\n}}\n\n==Production==\nAllen started ''Manhattan Murder Mystery'' as an early draft of ''[[Annie Hall]]'', but he did not feel that it was substantial enough, and he decided to go in a different direction.<ref name= \"fine\">{{cite news | first = Marshall | last = Fine| title = Woody's Take | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | location= McLean, Virginia|date = August 18, 1993 }}</ref> He had put off making the film for years because he felt it was too lightweight, \"like an airplane book read\".<ref name= \"dowd\">{{cite news | first = Maureen | last = Dowd | author-link = Maureen Dowd | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/movies/diane-and-woody-still-a-fun-couple.html?pagewanted=all | title = Diane and Woody, Still a Fun Couple | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 15, 1993 | access-date = October 28, 2011 | archive-date = September 5, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120905210652/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/movies/diane-and-woody-still-a-fun-couple.html?pagewanted=all | url-status = live }}</ref> Allen decided to revisit the material in the early 1990s.

I turn into the straight man\". Huston said that the set was \"oddly free of anxiety, introspection and pain\", and this was due to Keaton's presence.<ref name= \"dowd\"/>\n\nThe film was shot in the fall of 1992 on the streets of [[Greenwich Village]], the [[Upper East Side]] and the [[Upper West Side]]. Allen had cinematographer [[Carlo Di Palma]] rely on [[hand-held camera]]s, \"swiveling restlessly from one room to another, or zooming in abruptly for a close look.\"\n\nLarry and Carol Lipton's apartment is at 200 East 78th Street, between [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|2nd]] and [[Third Avenue|3rd Avenue]]<ref name= \"span\"/> and between two groups of [[List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets|New York City Designated Landmarks]], east of [[East 78th Street Houses|one group of rowhouses]] and west of [[Houses at 208-218 East 78th Street|another group]]. Allen staged a climactic shoot-out in a roomful of mirrors that, according to Allen, referenced a similar shoot-out in [[Orson Welles]]' film ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]''.<ref name= \"pendreigh\">{{cite news | first = Brian | last = Pendreigh |title = A New York Story | newspaper = [[The Scotsman]] |location=Edinburgh |date = September 6, 1993}}</ref>\n\nThe film marked Allen's second and final film with [[TriStar Pictures]], and it was speculated in the press that this deal was not extended because of the filmmaker's personal problems or that his films were not very profitable. Allen, however, denied these allegations in interviews at the time.<ref name= \"fine\"/> [[Zach Braff]], who was 17-years-old at the time, appeared in one scene as Nick Lipton, the son of Larry and Carol.
