Filmed and set during [[World War II]], it focuses on an American expatriate (Bogart) who must choose between his love for a woman (Bergman) or helping her husband (Henreid), a [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czech resistance]] leader, escape from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled city of [[Casablanca]] to continue his fight against the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]. The screenplay is based on ''[[Everybody Comes to Rick's]]'', an unproduced stage play by [[Murray Burnett]] and [[Joan Alison]]. The supporting cast features [[Claude Rains]], [[Conrad Veidt]], [[Sydney Greenstreet]], [[Peter Lorre]], and [[Dooley Wilson]].\n\n[[Warner Bros.]] story editor [[Irene Diamond]] convinced producer [[Hal B.

However, despite studio resistance, they left to work on [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series early in 1942. [[Howard Koch (screenwriter)|Howard Koch]] was assigned to the screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later.

Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he [[Gunrunning|ran guns]] to [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] and fought on the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nPetty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of \"letters of transit\" obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around [[German-occupied Europe]] and to [[Portugal in World War II|neutral Portugal]]; they are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and persuades Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt [[Prefecture of Police|prefect of police]]. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that Rick has the letters.\n\nThen the reason for Rick's cynical nature\u2014former lover Ilsa Lund\u2014enters his establishment. Spotting Rick's friend and house pianist, Sam, Ilsa asks him to play \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\". Rick storms over, furious that Sam disobeyed his order never to perform that song and is stunned to see Ilsa. She is accompanied by her husband, Victor Laszlo, a renowned, fugitive [[Resistance in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czech Resistance]] leader. The two need the letters to escape to America, as German Major Strasser has come to Casablanca to arrest Laszlo.\n\nWhen Laszlo makes enquiries, Signor Ferrari, an underworld figure and Rick's friendly business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters of transit. Laszlo returns to Rick's cafe that night and tries to buy the letters. Rick refuses to sell at any price, telling Laszlo to ask his wife the reason. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of German officers in singing \"{{lang|de|[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]}}\". Laszlo orders the house band to play \"{{lang|fr|[[La Marseillaise]]}}\". When the bandleader looks to Rick, he nods his head. Patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. Strasser demands Renault close the club, which he does.\n\n[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|alt=Black-and-white film screenshot of a man and woman as seen from the shoulders up. The two are close to each other as if about to kiss.|Bogart and Bergman]]\nLater, Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted caf\u00e9; when he refuses to give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun, but then confesses that she still loves him. She explains that when they met and fell in love in Paris in 1940, she believed her husband had been killed attempting to escape from a [[concentration camp]]. While preparing to flee with Rick from the city during the [[Battle of France]], she learned Laszlo was alive and in hiding. She left Rick without explanation to nurse her sick husband. Rick's bitterness dissolves. He agrees to help, letting her believe she will stay with him when Laszlo leaves. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl spirit Ilsa away. Laszlo, aware of Rick's love for Ilsa, tries to persuade him to use the letters to take her to safety.\n\nWhen the police arrest Laszlo on a trumped-up charge, Rick persuades Renault to release him by promising to set him up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters. To allay Renault's suspicions, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will be leaving for America. When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to [[Lisbon]] with Laszlo, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed, \"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.\" Strasser, tipped off by Renault, drives up alone. Rick shoots him when he draws his pistol and tries to intervene. When policemen arrive, Renault pauses, then orders them to \"round up the usual suspects\". He suggests to Rick that they join the [[Free French]] in [[Brazzaville]].

In 1984, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM/UA]] hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000.<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\">{{Cite journal|last=Edgerton|first=Gary R.|s2cid=159900256|title='The Germans Wore Gray, You Wore Blue': Frank Capra, ''Casablanca'', and the Colorization Controversy of the 1980s|journal=[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]|volume=27|issue=4|page=24|date=Winter 2000|doi=10.1080/01956050009602812}}</ref> When [[Ted Turner]] of [[Turner Broadcasting System]] purchased MGM/UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000.<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> Turner later reacted to the criticism of the colorization, saying, \"[''Casablanca''] is one of a handful of films that really doesn't have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I'm trying to do is protect my investment.\"<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" />\n\nThe [[Library of Congress]] deemed that the color change differed so much from the original film that it gave a new copyright to Turner Entertainment. When the colorized film debuted on WTBS, it was watched by three million viewers, not making the top-ten viewed cable shows for the week. Although Jack Matthews of the ''Los Angeles Times'' called the finished product \"state of the art\", it was mostly met with negative critical reception.<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> It was briefly available on home video. Gary Edgerton, writing for the ''[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]'' criticized the colorization, \"''Casablanca'' in color ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor.\"<ref name=\"EdgertonCasa\" /> Bogart's son, Stephen, said, \"if you're going to colorize ''Casablanca'', why not put arms on the [[Venus de Milo]]?\"<ref name=\"harmetz342\"/>\n\n== Inaccuracies and a misquote ==\nSeveral unfounded rumors and misconceptions have grown up around the film, one being that [[Ronald Reagan]] was originally chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio early on in the film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=74}}</ref> [[George Raft]] claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sklar|first=Robert|title=City Boys: Cagney, Bogart, Garfield|year=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-04795-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/cityboyscagneybo0000skla/page/135 135]|url=https://archive.org/details/cityboyscagneybo0000skla/page/135}}</ref>\n\nAnother story is that the actors did not know until the last day of shooting how the film was to end. Koch later acknowledged:\n<blockquote>\nWhen we began, we didn't have a finished script&nbsp;... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more&nbsp;...?' I said to her, 'I don't know&nbsp;... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wga.org/writers-room/101-best-lists/101-greatest-screenplays/list |title=101 Greatest Screenplays |publisher=Writers Guild of America, West |access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, while rewrites did occur during filming, Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, according to critic [[Roger Ebert]], \"emotional\", not \"factual\".<ref name=\"Ebertcommentary\" />\n\nThe film has several logical flaws, one being the two \"letters of transit\" that enable their bearers to leave [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] territory. Ugarte says the letters had been signed by (depending on the listener) either Vichy General [[Maxime Weygand|Weygand]] or [[Free French]] General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]. The French subtitles on the official DVD read Weygand; the English ones specify de Gaulle. Weygand had been the Vichy delegate-general for the [[French colonial empire|North African colonies]] until November 1941, a month before the film is set. But de Gaulle was the head of the Free French [[government in exile]], so a letter signed by him would have provided no benefit.<ref name=\"robertson\" /> The letters were invented as a [[MacGuffin]] by Joan Alison for the original play and never questioned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harmetz|1992|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn the same vein, though Laszlo asserts that the Nazis cannot arrest him, saying, \"This is still unoccupied France; any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault\", Ebert points out, \"It makes no sense that he could walk around freely.&nbsp;... He would be arrested on sight.\"<ref name=\"Ebertcommentary\" /> In addition, no uniformed German troops were stationed in Casablanca during World War II, and neither American nor French troops occupied Berlin in 1918.<ref name=\"robertson\" />\n\nA line closely associated with ''Casablanca''\u2014\"Play it again, Sam\"\u2014is not spoken in the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Movie Misquotations |first=Fred R. |last=Shapiro |newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=January 15, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217184411/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html |archive-date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Darth Vader line is the daddy of film misquotes, finds poll |first=Ben |last=Child |newspaper=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=May 11, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/11/star-wars-movie-misquotes-poll |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115201651/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/11/star-wars-movie-misquotes-poll |archive-date=November 15, 2016 }}</ref> When Ilsa first enters the Caf\u00e9 Am\u00e9ricain, she spots Sam and asks him, \"Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake.\" After he feigns ignorance, she responds, \"Play it, Sam.
