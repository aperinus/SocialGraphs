It is the second installment in ''The Delta Force'' film series. In this film, McCoy, now a colonel, leads his [[Delta Force|Delta]] team into the fictional South American country of San Carlos to rescue hostages and stop the flow of cocaine into the United States.\n\n''Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection'' was disliked by critics for sparse connections to its predecessor, a clich\u00e9d script, subpar acting, and similarities to the earlier Norris vehicle ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nRamon Cota ([[Billy Drago]]) is a wealthy and powerful drug kingpin who controls the [[cocaine]] industry with an iron fist. His drugs pour steadily into America, corrupting the country's youth and causing a feud between the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and San Carlos, Cota's country of origin.\n\nThe film opens during a carnival in [[Rio de Janeiro]], as an undercover task force led by several DEA agents conducts surveillance on a private party that Cota is attending (similar to a [[Mardi Gras]] ball); however, the surveillance team is ambushed and massacred by Cota's hitmen, who are masquerading as carnival performers. Due to the Rio fiasco, the DEA enlists the support of the U.S. Army's Delta Force in order to infiltrate San Carlos. They are aided by an undercover agent within Cota's drug cartel.\n\nGeneral Taylor orders Colonel Scott McCoy ([[Chuck Norris]]) and his deputy, Major Bobby Chavez ([[Paul Perri]]) to bring Cota to court. They pose as airline passengers while Cota is en route to Geneva to deposit his drug money in a Swiss bank account, and are able to capture him during a short interval in which the plane enters U.S. airspace. However, their efforts amount to nothing as Cota is easily able to post bail and escape. Unable to contain his rage, Chavez furiously lashes out at Cota in court. Cota decides to strike at Chavez by having Chavez's pregnant wife killed.\n \nOut on a personal mission of vengeance, Chavez is captured by Cota's forces and is tortured and killed. When three DEA agents attempt to go in and bring Cota and his army down, they are taken hostage, and are to be executed. During a press conference, a spokesman for the DEA explains that San Carlos's president Alcazar fears a coup and is therefore reluctant to crack down on the cartels, while his corrupt generals benefit from the drug trade and are willing to protect Cota from extradition.\n\nMcCoy is parachuted into San Carlos and sent to rescue the hostages in a stealth operation, while Taylor and the rest of the Delta Force perform surveillance. Their mission is supervised by a delegate from the government of San Carlos, which has entered an agreement with the U.S. government that severely limits the scope of the mission. Meanwhile, McCoy scales a tall cliff and infiltrates Cota's mansion.\n\nLater, the government of San Carlos attempts to cancel the U.S. intervention outright by staging a massive drug raid that would make the American mission unnecessary. Upon learning of the hoax, Taylor breaks protocol and heads south of his perimeter in a heavily armed gunship, prompting the San Carlos army to send their own choppers in pursuit. The chopper lands at Cota's mansion and deploys troops to destroy cocaine storehouses and laboratories. McCoy succeeds in releasing the hostages, but is captured by Cota and placed in a chamber filled with toxic gas and isolated by a glass pane. Before the gas can kill him, however, a rocket from Taylor's gunship shatters the glass, allowing him to break through.\n\nWith the help of DEA Agent Page, McCoy captures Cota in his own armored limousine and flees the mansion. Cota's bodyguards and a San Carlos attack helicopter pursue the vehicle and eventually bring it to a halt, but Taylor's gunship saves them. Cota flees on foot through the jungle during the fighting. After the drug lord kills a villager who wanted revenge for the murder of her family, McCoy arrives and beats him. Cota then tries to goad McCoy into killing him, knowing he is wanted alive.\n\nTaylor's helicopter arrives to pick up McCoy and his prisoner with ropes, as the last few of Cota's men close in. One of them swings his machete but only manages to partially cut Cota's rope before the helicopter heads out to sea to join the American carrier fleet. Hanging beneath the chopper, Cota continues to goad McCoy about his invulnerability, saying that once in court he will walk free again. However, the rope grows thinner from the machete cut, until it snaps completely. The film ends with Cota falling thousands of feet to his death.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chuck Norris]] as Colonel Scott McCoy\n* [[Billy Drago]] as Ramon Cota\n* [[John P.

I hate it when you start a movie with a script half done; chances are you'll end up with a mediocre movie. The first `Delta Force' was well written.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Rewriters have 'Stranglehold' on Chuck Norris' latest movie|edition=EVENING|author=Marilyn Beck|work=Orange County Register|location=Santa Ana, California|date=Dec 22, 1988|page=K04}}</ref>\n\n\"I researched drug kingpins during the three years we worked to prepare for this movie\", added Norris, \"and much of what I read convinced me that you're dealing with unconscionable, truly vicious individuals. It's true, there are some changes in Colombia, but the fighting is still going on, and these people are other places as well. And what you're fighting is billions of dollars. That much money means an enormous amount of power. That's why we portrayed our kingpin that vindictively. It happens. They feel they're above the law, and when you get in their way, they don't just go after you. They kill your wife, aunts, uncles, all relatives. They eliminate your lineage.\"<ref name=\"delta\"/>\n \n[[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was offered a role in the film but he turned it down to do ''Cyborg''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Punch lineage Van Damme is the actioner's heir apparent|edition=FINAL, C|author=Thompson, Anne|work=Chicago Tribune|date=Aug 27, 1989|page=16}}</ref>\n\nBilly Drago was cast as the villain. \"It is, in a sense, a straight-ahead action picture and you're talking about Good vs. Evil\", said Drago, \"and it is pretty black and white. . . . It's not a matter of becoming someone else as it is really more a matter of finding that dark part of myself that everybody has someplace. I also approach it from an amoral point of view rather than immoral. He was not some cokehead going nuts. And in a sense, that made him scarier. . . .

This explains the visibility of the [[Taal Volcano]] in some scenes.\n\nMuch of the film was shot at an unfinished hilltop mansion in the mountain resort of Tagaytay called the [[Palace in the Sky|People's Park in the Sky]] that [[Imelda Marcos]] started building in 1983 as a guest house for a visit, never made, by then-U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref name=\"heli\">{{cite news|title=Helicopter in Chuck Norris Movie Crashes; 4 Killed|edition=P.M.
