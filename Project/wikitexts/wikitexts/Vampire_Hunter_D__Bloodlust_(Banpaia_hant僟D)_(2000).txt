It was written, directed and storyboarded by [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]], with [[Yutaka Minowa]] designing the characters, Y\u016bji Ikehata serving as art director and designing the setting, and Marco D'Ambrosio composing the music. The film is based on the third novel of [[Hideyuki Kikuchi]]'s ''[[Vampire Hunter D]]'' series, ''[[List of Vampire Hunter D novels#D - Demon Deathchase|Demon Deathchase]]''.\n\nThe film began production in 1997 and was completed with the intention of being shown in American theaters. It was shown in twelve theaters across the United States and received generally positive reception from American critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Film summaries must be less than 700 words. -->\nIn the middle of the night, Charlotte Elbourne, a young woman, is abducted by Baron Meier Link, a [[vampire]] nobleman. Several days later, Charlotte's wealthy and wheelchair-bound father, John, hires D, a [[dhampir]], to rescue her, dead or alive.\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte's older brother Adam hires the Marcus Brothers, composed of their leader Borgoff, the hulking Nolt, the blade master Kyle, the frail/physically bedridden [[Psychic power|psychic]] Grove, and Leila, a woman who holds a grudge towards vampires. D and the Marcus Brothers race after Meier, learning that Charlotte was not kidnapped but chose to accompany him out of love for the vampire.\n\nMeier hires the mutant Barbarois to guard him, consisting of the [[shapeshifter]] Caroline, the shadow manipulator Benge, and the [[werewolf]] Machira. Nolt is killed by Benge, resulting in the brothers confronting the Barbarois in their home territory. At the same time, D visits them. Grove causes a large ruckus using his psychic powers, and D becomes trapped in a void that Benge creates. D escapes the void, and the Marcus Brothers avenge Nolt by killing Benge. They then travel to a nearby town, where Leila convinces the local sheriff to stop D. Fortunately, D is saved by an old man who recalls the dhampir rescuing him as a child.\n\nMeier's carriage stops to rest during the daytime, and Charlotte wanders out, meeting D and Leila. The two fight against Caroline while Machira escapes with the carriage. D defeats Caroline but is forced to seek shelter after absorbing too much sunlight. Leila faces a revived Caroline and survives only by chance when lightning strikes the mutant, killing her instantly. She takes shelter with D after and reveals that a vampire back in her childhood kidnapped her mother. This resulted in her being [[Stoning|stoned to death]] by the people of her hometown when she returned as a completely different person and killed her father. Leila joined the Marcus Brothers to avenge her parents' deaths. The two make a pact to visit each other's graves upon who dies first.\n\nThe Marcus Brothers trap Meier's carriage on a bridge by bombing it and carjacking Charlotte. However, their trap is foiled by Machira's enhanced senses, resulting in Kyle being killed and Borgoff falling off the bridge but surviving, losing an eye. Meier and Charlotte reach the Castle of Chaythe, where [[Countess]] [[Carmilla|Carmilla Elizabeth Bathory]] awaits them. Meanwhile, Machira stays behind to fight D, but the vampire hunter slays him.\n\nIt is then revealed that Meier and Charlotte had reached out to the Countess, hoping they could fly to the City of the Night, a vampire refuge located in space. However, Carmilla betrays the couple, temporarily slaying Meier and tricking Charlotte into being bitten. Revived by Charlotte's blood, she uses hallucinations to haunt D, Borgoff, and Leila. D is unaffected and saves Leila from her hallucinations depicting her tragic childhood, but Borgoff is tricked and turned. Grove reappears and saves Leila by blowing up the now vampiric Borgoff with an embrace. Grove then dies as a result. D confronts Carmilla and is able to destroy her spirit whilst a reawakened Meier destroys her physical body. D and Meier then clash for a final time, with D gaining the upper hand. During the fight, Charlotte dies from her wounds, with her ring tossed to D and Meier by Leila. D ultimately spares Meier's life and leaves the castle with Leila while taking Charlotte's ring as proof for her father and brother. As Meier uses the castle's ship to depart to the City of the Night, D and Leila look on, with Leila wishing the vampire success.\n\nYears later, a funeral is held for Leila, with a large crowd attending. Among the crowd is Leila's granddaughter, who recognizes D from a distance and invites him to spend time with her family, but he kindly refuses. D reveals he is glad Leila was wrong about nobody being at her funeral and leaves contentedly.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !! English Voice Actor !!
