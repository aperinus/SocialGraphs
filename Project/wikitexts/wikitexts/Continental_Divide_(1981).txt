It was the first film to be credited as being produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s production company [[Amblin Entertainment]]. It was directed by [[Michael Apted]] and written by [[Lawrence Kasdan]].\n\n==Plot==\nChicago newspaper reporter Ernie Souchak (Belushi) is investigating a corrupt [[Chicago City Council|alderman]]. While doing an expos\u00e9 on some shady land dealings, he is assaulted by two crooked police officers sent by the alderman and ends up in the hospital.\n\nSouchak's editor decides to send him out of town for his own safety. A city boy, Souchak reluctantly travels to the Rockies to interview the reclusive Dr. Nell Porter (Brown), who has been conducting research on the [[American bald eagle]]s for several years.\n\nThe two are at odds at first. After finding out he is a reporter, she is reluctant to let him stay, but realizes he is not able to survive in the mountains without his guide, who is not scheduled to return for two weeks. He is skeptical about her work, but comes to admire Porter for her strong character and dedication. Eventually, they fall in love.\n\nAt first, she lets him stay as long as he doesn't write his story. As they learn to respect each other, she agrees to let him write about her. During his adventures, he sprains his back in an accident, is mauled by a cougar, and meets an All-American football player who has left civilization and become a mountain man.\n\nSouchak returns to Chicago with her very much on his mind. When he finds out that one of his sources has been \"accidentally\" killed, he once again doggedly pursues the investigation until the alderman is forced to flee the country.\n\nThe same day, Souchak finds out that Porter is coming to Chicago to present a museum lecture on her work. With some uncertainty, he decides to attend, and they quickly rekindle their relationship. Happy as they are together, they cannot reconcile the different paths each has taken in life, and so they reluctantly decide to part again.\n\nSouchak, seeing her off on the train, ends up traveling with her all the way back to Wyoming. After getting off at her stop, they decide that they cannot live without each other and decide to marry. Souchak catches the next train back to Chicago, but the newlyweds promise to meet again very soon.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Belushi]] as Ernie Souchak\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Nell Porter\n* [[Allen Garfield]] as Howard McDermott (billed as Allen Goorwitz)\n* [[Carlin Glynn]] as Sylvia McDermott\n* [[Val Avery]] as Alderman Yablonowitz\n* [[Tony Ganios]] as Max Bernbaum\n* Liam Russell as Deke Lewis\n* [[Bruce Jarchow]] as Hellinger\n* [[Ron Dean]] as Plesko\n\n==Production==\nSinger [[Helen Reddy]] performed the \"Theme from Continental Divide (We Will Never Say Goodbye)\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Theme-Continental-Divide-Never-Goodbye/dp/B0037ELS9S|title=Theme from Continental Divide (We Will Never Say Goodbye) - Helen Reddy|website=Amazon}}</ref>\n\nThe Ernie Souchak character was loosely based on longtime Chicago newspaper columnist [[Mike Royko]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/03/lawrence-kasdan-hollywood-interview.html|title=Lawrence Kasdan: The Hollywood Interview|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nAs of December 2020, ''Continental Divide'' holds a rating of 73% at the film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 11 reviews.\n\n==Filming locations==\nMany of the scenes were filmed around Chicago:\n* Belushi's character works for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', with many scenes filmed in and around the now-demolished Sun-Times building on the Chicago River (now the site of [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]]).\n* Belushi and Brown's characters meet in Chicago while she is giving a lecture at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] next to Lake Michigan.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jcUXYAGbbEC&q=continental+divide+lecture+at+field+museum&pg=PT133 |title=Hollywood on Lake Michigan: 100+ Years of Chicago and the Movies By Michael Corcoran, Arnie Bernstein|isbn=9781613745786|last1=Corcoran|first1=Michael|last2=Bernstein|first2=Arnie|date=June 2013}}</ref>\n\nMany of the mountain scenes were filmed in Colorado in [[Custer County, Colorado|Custer County]].\n\nOther scenes were filmed at:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082200/locations |title=Continental Divide: Filming Locations|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n* Railroad station in Chicago was not Union Station, but the old Chicago & Northwestern Terminal (now called the [[Ogilvie Transportation Center]]) made up to look like an Amtrak station.
