The film stars [[Jeff Bridges]] as Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer and [[video game developer]] who is transported inside the software world of a mainframe computer where he interacts with programs in his attempt to escape; it also stars [[Bruce Boxleitner]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]], [[Cindy Morgan]], and [[Barnard Hughes]]. ''Tron'', along with ''[[The Last Starfighter]]'', has the distinction of being one of cinema's earliest films to use extensive [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).\n\nThe inspiration for ''Tron'' dates back to 1976, when Lisberger became intrigued with [[video games]] after seeing ''[[Pong]]''. He and producer [[Donald Kushner]] set up an animation studio to develop ''Tron'' with the intention of making it an animated film. To promote the studio itself, Lisberger and his team created a 30-second animation featuring the first appearance of the title character. Eventually, Lisberger decided to include live-action elements with both backlit and [[computer animation]] for the actual feature-length film. Various studios had rejected the storyboards for the film before [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] agreed to finance and distribute ''Tron''. There, [[Traditional animation|backlit animation]] was finally combined with the computer animation and live action.\n\n''Tron'' was released on July 9, 1982. The film was a moderate success at the box office, and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its groundbreaking visuals and acting but criticized its storyline as being incoherent. ''Tron'' received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnw3u-49CJU Gandhi Wins Costume Design: 1983 Oscars]</ref> and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7puywQAYfqo E.T.

See WP:FILMPLOT. Please refrain from adding unnecessary detail. -->\nKevin Flynn is a leading [[Software|software engineer]], formerly employed by the computer corporation ENCOM, who now runs a [[video game arcade]] and attempts to [[Security hacker|hack]] into ENCOM's [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] system. However, ENCOM's [[Master Control Program (Tron)|Master Control Program]] (MCP) halts his progress. Within ENCOM, programmer Alan Bradley and his girlfriend, engineer Lora Baines, discover that the MCP has closed off their access to projects. When Alan confronts the senior executive vice president, Ed Dillinger, Dillinger claims that the security measures are an effort to stop outside hacking attempts. However, when Dillinger privately questions the MCP through his computerized desk, he realizes the MCP has expanded into a powerful [[virtual intelligence]] and has become power-hungry, illegally appropriating personal, business, and government programs to increase its own capabilities. Dillinger rose to the top of ENCOM by stealing video games Flynn had created, presenting them to the company as his own. The MCP blackmails Dillinger with information about his plagiarizing Flynn's games if he does not comply with its directives.\n\nLora deduces that Flynn is the hacker, and she and Alan go to his arcade to warn him. Flynn reveals that he has been trying to locate evidence proving Dillinger's plagiarism, which launched Dillinger's rise in the company. Together, the three form a plan to break into ENCOM and unlock Alan's \"Tron\" program, a self-governing security measure designed to protect the system and counter the functions of the MCP. Once inside ENCOM, the three split up and Flynn comes into direct conflict with the MCP, communicating with his terminal. Before Flynn can get the information he needs to reveal Dillinger's acts, the MCP uses an experimental [[laser]] to digitize and upload Flynn into the ENCOM mainframe cyberspace<!-- It is a separate setting from the Grid seen in the sequel -->, where programs are living entities appearing in the likeness of the human \"Users\" (programmers) who created them.\n\nFlynn learns that the MCP and its second-in-command, Sark, rule and coerce programs to renounce their belief in the Users. The MCP forces programs that resist to play in deadly [[Ludi|games]] and begins putting Flynn in duels. Flynn meets other captured programs, Ram and Tron, between matches. Partnered, the three escape into the mainframe during a [[light cycle]] match (an [[arcade game]] Flynn wrote the program for and is skilled at), but Flynn and Ram become separated from Tron by an MCP pursuit party. While attempting to help Ram, who was wounded in the pursuit, Flynn learns that he can manipulate portions of the mainframe by accessing his programmer knowledge. Ram recognizes Flynn as a User and encourages him to find Tron and free the system before \"derezzing\" (dying). Using his new ability, Flynn partially rebuilds a Recognizer vehicle (a construct taken from another one of Flynn's games) and later disguises himself as one of Sark's soldiers.\n\nTron enlists help from Yori, a sympathetic program, and at an I/O tower receives information from Alan necessary to destroy the MCP. Flynn rejoins them, and the three board a hijacked solar sailer to reach the MCP's core. However, Sark's command ship destroys the sailer, capturing Flynn and Yori and presumably killing Tron. Sark leaves the command ship and orders its deresolution, but Flynn keeps it intact by again manipulating the mainframe, while Sark reaches the MCP's core on a shuttle carrying captured programs. While the MCP attempts to absorb captive programs, Tron, who turns out to have survived, confronts Sark and critically injures him, prompting the MCP to give him all its functions. Realizing that his ability to manipulate the mainframe might give Tron an opening, Flynn leaps into the beam of the MCP, distracting it. Seeing the break in the MCP's shield, Tron attacks through the gap and destroys the MCP and Sark, ending the MCP's control over the mainframe and allowing the captured programs to communicate with users again.\n\nFlynn reappears in the real world, rematerialized at his terminal. Tron's victory in the mainframe has released all lockouts on computer access, and a nearby printer produces the evidence that Dillinger had plagiarized Flynn's creations. The next morning, Dillinger enters his office to find the MCP deactivated and the proof of his theft publicized. Subsequently, Dillinger is terminated while Flynn is promoted to CEO of ENCOM, and is happily greeted by Alan and Lora as their new boss.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Tron characters|label1=List of ''Tron'' characters}}\n\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as [[List of Tron characters#Kevin Flynn|Kevin Flynn]], a former programmer and [[video game developer]] at ENCOM and [[video arcade]] proprietor who is beamed into the ENCOM mainframe via a digitizing laser by the Master Control Program\n** Bridges also portrays [[List of Tron characters#Clu|Clu (Codified Likeness Utility)]], a hacking program developed by Flynn to find evidence of Dillinger's theft in the mainframe.\n* [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as [[List of Tron characters#Alan Bradley|Alan Bradley]], Flynn's work partner and fellow programmer at ENCOM\n** Boxleitner also portrays [[List of Tron characters#Tron|Tron]], a security program developed by Bradley to self-monitor communications between the MCP and the real world.\n* [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] as [[List of Tron characters#Ed Dillinger|Ed Dillinger]], the Senior Executive Vice President of ENCOM and former coworker of Flynn's who used the MCP to steal Flynn's work and pass it off as his own, earning himself a series of undeserved promotions\n** Warner also portrays [[List of Tron characters#Sark|Sark]], a command program developed by Dillinger to serve as the MCP's second-in-command.\n** Warner also provides the uncredited voice of the [[List of Tron characters#Master Control Program|Master Control Program (MCP)]], a rogue [[artificial intelligence]] [[operating system]] (originally a [[chess software|chess program]] created by Dr. Gibbs and \"improved\" by Dillinger) which monitors and controls ENCOM's mainframe.\n* [[Cindy Morgan]] as [[List of Tron characters#Lora Beines|Dr. Lora Baines]], Bradley's co-worker and girlfriend, as well as assistant to Dr. Gibbs on the digitization experiment.\n** Morgan also portrays [[List of Tron characters#Yori|Yori]], an input/output program developed by Dr. Baines and an ally of Tron.\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] as [[List of Tron characters#Walter Gibbs|Dr. Walter Gibbs]], a co-founder of ENCOM running the company's science division, who creates the SHV 20905 digitizing laser with Dr. Baines's assistance.\n** Hughes also portrays [[List of Tron characters#Dumont|Dumont]], a \"guardian\" program developed by Dr. Gibbs to protect input/output junctions in the mainframe.\n** Hughes also provides the uncredited voice of the Master Control Program's original incarnation.\n* [[Dan Shor]] as [[List of Tron characters#Roy Kleinberg|Roy Kleinberg]], an ENCOM employee\n** Shor also portrays [[List of Tron characters#Ram|Ram]], an actuarial program possibly developed by Kleinberg to sort out connections between ENCOM and an unnamed insurance company, who is a close ally of Tron and Flynn.\n* [[Peter Jurasik]] as [[List of Tron characters#Crom|Crom]], a compound interest program matched against Flynn on the Game Grid\n* Tony Stephano as Peter, Ed Dillinger's assistant.\n** Stephano also portrays Sark's Lieutenant.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Origins ===\nThe inspiration for ''Tron'' occurred in 1976 when Steven Lisberger, then an animator of drawings with his own studio, looked at a sample reel from a computer firm called [[Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.|MAGI]] and saw ''[[Pong]]'' for the first time.<ref name=\"Culhane\">{{cite news|last=Culhane |first=John |title=Special Effects are Revolutionizing Film |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 4, 1982 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E3DB123BF937A35754C0A964948260&sec=technology&spon=&pagewanted=all |access-date=January 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120915/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E3DB123BF937A35754C0A964948260&sec=technology&spon=&pagewanted=all |archive-date=September 15, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He was immediately fascinated by video games and wanted to do a film incorporating them.

This backlit [[cel animation]] depicted Tron as a character who glowed yellow; the same shade that Lisberger had originally intended for all the heroic characters developed for the feature-length ''Tron''. This was later changed to blue for the finished film (see [[#Pre-production|Pre-production]] below). The prototype Tron was bearded and resembled the [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] Centurions from the 1978 TV series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. Also, Tron was armed with two \"exploding discs\", as Lisberger described them on the 2-Disc DVD edition ([[List of Tron characters#Rinzler/Tron|see Rinzler]]).\n\nLisberger elaborates: \"Everybody was doing backlit animation in the 70s, you know. It was that disco look. And we thought, what if we had this character that was a neon line, and that was our Tron warrior&nbsp;\u2013 Tron for electronic. And what happened was, I saw ''Pong'', and I said, well, that's the arena for him. And at the same time I was interested in the early phases of computer generated animation, which I got into at MIT in Boston, and when I got into that I met a bunch of programmers who were into all that. And they really inspired me, by how much they believed in this new realm.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/Tron/687709/interview_justin_springer_and_steven_lisberger_coproducers_of_tron_legacy.html |title=Interview: Justin Springer and Steven Lisberger, co-producers of Tron: Legacy |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120915/http://www.denofgeek.com/Tron/687709/interview_justin_springer_and_steven_lisberger_coproducers_of_tron_legacy.html |archive-date=September 15, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHe was frustrated by the clique-like nature of computers and video games and wanted to create a film that would open this world up to everyone.

Lisberger planned to finance the movie independently by approaching several computer companies but had little success. However, one company, [[Information International Inc.]], was receptive.<ref name=\"Patterson, Richard\" /> He met with Richard Taylor, a representative, and they began talking about using live-action photography with back-lit animation in such a way that it could be integrated with computer graphics. At this point, there was a script and the film was entirely [[storyboard]]ed, with some computer animation tests completed.<ref name=\"Patterson, Richard\" /> He had spent approximately $300,000 developing ''Tron'' and had also secured $4\u20135 million in private backing before reaching a standstill.

The studio agreed to finance a test reel which involved a [[flying disc]] champion throwing a rough prototype of the discs used in the film.<ref name=\"Patterson, Richard\" /> It was a chance to mix live-action footage with back-lit animation and computer-generated visuals. It impressed the executives at Disney and they agreed to back the film. MacBird and Lisberger's script was subsequently re-written and re-storyboarded with the studio's input.<ref name=\"Patterson, Richard\" /> At the time, Disney rarely hired outsiders to make films for them, and Kushner found that he and his group were given a chilly reception because they \"tackled the nerve center&nbsp;\u2013 [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|the animation department]].

Most of the vehicle designs (including Sark's aircraft carrier, the light cycles, the tank, and the solar sailer) were created by industrial designer [[Syd Mead]]. [[Peter Lloyd (illustrator)|Peter Lloyd]], a high-tech commercial artist, designed the environments.<ref name=\"Patterson, Richard\" /> Nevertheless, these jobs often overlapped, leaving Giraud working on the solar sailer and Mead designing terrain, sets and the film's logo. The original 'Program' character design was inspired by Lisberger Studios' logo of a glowing bodybuilder hurling two [[Flying disc|discs]].<ref name=\"Patterson, Richard\" />\n\nTo create the computer animation sequences of ''Tron'', Disney turned to the four leading computer graphics firms of the day: [[Information International, Inc.]] of [[Culver City, California]], who owned the [[Foonly#The Foonly F1|Super Foonly F-1]] (the fastest [[PDP-10]] ever made and the only one of its kind); [[Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.|MAGI]] of [[Elmsford, New York]]; [[Robert Abel and Associates]] of California; and [[Digital Effects]] of New York City.<ref name=\"Patterson, Richard\" /> [[Bill Kovacs]] worked on the film while working for Robert Abel before going on to found [[Wavefront Technologies]]. The work was not a collaboration, resulting in very different styles used by the firms.\n\n''Tron'' was one of the first films to make extensive use of any form of [[computer animation]], and it is celebrated as a milestone in the industry though only fifteen to twenty minutes of such animation were used,<ref name=\"DVD\">Interview with [[Harrison Ellenshaw]], supplemental material on ''Tron'' DVD</ref> mostly scenes that show digital \"terrain\" or patterns, or include vehicles such as light-cycles, tanks and ships. Because the technology to combine computer animation and live action did not exist at the time, these sequences were interspersed with the filmed characters. One of the computers used had only 2&nbsp;MB of memory and no more than 330&nbsp;MB of storage. This put a limit on detail of background; and at a certain distance, they had a procedure of mixing in black to fade things out, a process called \"depth cueing\". The film's Computer Effects Supervisor Richard Taylor told them \"When in doubt, black it out!\", which became their motto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/dcc/revfeat/video_tron/ |title=The influence of Disney's Tron in filmmaking Tron and CG moviemaking |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707/http://digitalcontentproducer.com/dcc/revfeat/video_tron/ |archive-date=July 7, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Originally the film was meant to use white backgrounds like in [[THX 1138]] inside the Grid, but it would require such huge amounts of lights that it was decided to use black backgrounds instead.<ref>[http://www.tested.com/art/movies/520562-putting-original-trons-special-effects-together/ Putting Tron's Special Effects Together \u2013 Tested]</ref>\n\nThe computers at the time could not do animation, so the frames had to be produced one by one. In some of the more complex sequences, like the Solar Sailer moving through metal canyons, each frame could take up to six hours to produce. There was no way to digitally [[Film-out|print them on film]], either; rather, a motion picture camera was placed in front of a computer screen to capture each individual frame.<ref>[https://variety.com/2017/film/news/tron-jeff-bridges-cgi-1982-disney-anniversary-1202486941/ TRON, Jeff Bridges & CGI: The Classic 80's Film Anniversary&nbsp;\u2013 Variety]</ref><ref>[http://www.cgw.com/Press-Center/Web-Exclusives/2011/Original-TRON.aspx Original TRON | Computer Graphics World]</ref><ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/93956/Tron/articles.html Tron (1982) \u2013 Articles \u2013 TCM.com]</ref>\n\nMost of the scenes, backgrounds, and visual effects in the film were created using more traditional techniques and a unique process known as \"backlit animation\".<ref name=\"Patterson, Richard\" /> In this process, live-action scenes inside the computer world were filmed in [[black-and-white]] on an entirely black set, placed in an enlarger for blow-ups and transferred to [[large format]] Kodalith high-contrast film. These negatives were then used to make Kodalith sheets with a reverse (positive) image. Clear cels were laid over each sheet and all portions of the figure except the areas that were exposed for the later camera passes were manually blacked out. Next the Kodalith sheets and cel overlays were placed over a light box while a VistaVision camera mounted above it made separate passes and different color filters. A typical shot normally required 12 passes, but some sequences, like the interior of the electronic tank, could need as many as 50 passes. About 300 matte paintings were made for the film, each photographed onto a large piece of [[Ektachrome]] film before colors were added by gelatin filters in a similar procedure as in the Kodaliths. The mattes, [[rotoscoping|rotoscopic]] and CGI were then combined and composed together to give them a \"technological\" appearance.<ref name=\"Ansen2\" /><ref>[https://computerarchive.org/files/computer/magazines/electronic%20games/Electronic_Games_Issue_08_Vol_01_08_1982_Oct.pdf The Magnificent Look of ...

The Kodalith was specially produced as large sheets by Kodak for the film and came in numbered boxes so that each batch of the film could be used in order of manufacture for a consistent image.
