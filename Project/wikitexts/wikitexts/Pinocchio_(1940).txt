It was the [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|second animated feature film produced by Disney]], made after the first animated success ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937).\n\nThe plot involves an old Italian [[wood carving|woodcarver]] named [[Geppetto]] who carves a wooden puppet named [[Pinocchio#Disney version|Pinocchio]] and wishes that he might be a real boy. The puppet is brought to life by a [[Fairy with Turquoise Hair|blue fairy]], who informs him that he can become a real boy if he proves himself to be \"brave, truthful, and unselfish\". The key character of [[Jiminy Cricket]], who takes the role of Pinocchio's conscience, attempts to guide Pinocchio in matters of right and wrong. Pinocchio's efforts to become a real boy involve encounters with a host of unsavory characters, representing the temptations and consequences of wrongdoing.\n\nThe film was adapted by several storyboard artists from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by [[Ben Sharpsteen]] and [[Hamilton Luske]], and the film's sequences were directed by [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norman Ferguson]], [[T. Hee]], [[Wilfred Jackson]], [[Jack Kinney]], and Bill Roberts. ''Pinocchio'' was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles, machinery and natural elements such as rain, lightning, smoke, shadows and water. ''Pinocchio'' was released to theatres by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] on February 23, 1940.\n\nAlthough it received critical acclaim and became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award \u2014 winning two for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music, Original Score]] and for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music, Original Song]] for \"[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]\" \u2014 it was initially a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], mainly due to [[World War II]] cutting off the European and Asian markets overseas. It eventually made a profit in its 1945 reissue, and is considered [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest animated films ever made]], with a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|{{RT data|score}} rating]] on the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The film and characters are still prevalent in popular culture, featuring at various [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney parks]] and in other forms of entertainment. In 1994, ''Pinocchio'' was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] for being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\"NationalFilmRegistry\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/movies/25-films-added-to-national-registry.html|title=25 Films Added to National Registry|work=The New York Times|page=C20|date=November 15, 1994|access-date=September 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA 2000 live-action movie titled ''[[Geppetto (TV musical)|Geppetto]]'', told from Geppetto's perspective, was released direct to television.<ref name=\"SchwartzSon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/disneys-my-son-pinocchio.htm|title=Disney's My Son Pinocchio: Geppetto's Musical Tale|website=www.musicalschwartz.com}}</ref> In April 2015, a [[Pinocchio (2022 live-action film)|live-action adaptation of the same name]] officially entered development; filming began in March 2021 and ended that April, and it was released on [[Disney+]] on September 8, 2022.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS AND ONLY CONTAIN THE BARE BASICS OF THE PLOT, NOT EVERY DETAIL. Current count is 624 words.-->\n[[Jiminy Cricket]] addresses the audience as the narrator to tell a story of a wish coming true. The story takes place in a village in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] sometime in the late [[19th century]], where he arrived at the shop of a woodworker and toymaker named [[Geppetto]], who lives with his pets, Figaro the kitten and Cleo the goldfish. Geppetto creates a [[marionette]] whom he names [[Pinocchio]]. Falling asleep, Geppetto wishes upon a star for Pinocchio to be a real boy. Late that night, a [[Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy. When Jiminy reveals himself, the Blue Fairy assigns him to be Pinocchio's conscience. Geppetto wakes up upon hearing a commotion from Pinocchio falling and is overjoyed to discover that his puppet is alive and will become a real boy.\n\nThe next morning, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by con artist fox [[The Fox and the Cat|Honest John]] and his sidekick [[The Fox and the Cat|Gideon the Cat]]. Honest John convinces him to join [[Stromboli (Pinocchio)|Stromboli]]'s puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction but when he tries to go home, Stromboli locks him in a bird cage and leaves to tour the world with Pinocchio. After Jiminy unsuccessfully tries to free his friend, the Blue Fairy appears, and an anxious Pinocchio lies about what happened, but his nose grows longer and longer. The Blue Fairy restores his nose and frees him when Pinocchio promises to make amends but warns him that she can no longer help him.\n\nMeanwhile, Honest John is hired by [[The Coachman|a mysterious \"Coachman\"]] to find disobedient boys for him to take to [[Land of Toys|Pleasure Island]]. Though Honest John and Gideon are frightened by the Coachman's implication of what happens to the boys and by the possible severe legal consequences if the law finds out, the former reluctantly accepts the job and then finds Pinocchio, convincing him to take a vacation on Pleasure Island after his terrible experience with Stromboli. On the way, Pinocchio befriends [[Candlewick (character)|Lampwick]], a delinquent boy. At Pleasure Island, without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio, Lampwick, and countless other boys soon engage in [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] [[cigar]]s and [[cigarette]]s, [[gambling]], [[vandalism]], and getting [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], much to Jiminy's frustration. Jiminy eventually discovers that the island hides a horrible curse, turning boys into actual [[donkeys]] (as revealed by the Coachman: if you leave a young boy to his own unsupervised devices, he'll soon make a \u201cjackass\u201d of himself). The Coachman plans to sell them to [[Slavery|slave labor]] in salt mines and circuses. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick transform into a donkey, and with Jiminy's help, Pinocchio escapes, partially transformed with a donkey's ears and tail, though they have to abandon Lampwick and the other boys.\n\nReturning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find Geppetto\u2019s workshop deserted. They get a letter from the Blue Fairy in the form of a dove, stating that Geppetto had gone out looking for Pinocchio and sailed to Pleasure Island where he learned Pinocchio was taken to but was swallowed by [[The Terrible Dogfish|Monstro]], a terrible [[sperm whale]], and is now living in the belly of the beast. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the ocean, accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro, where he reunites with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them and smashes their raft with his tail. Pinocchio selflessly pulls Geppetto to safety in a cove just as Monstro crashes into it and Pinocchio is seemingly killed.\n\nBack home, Geppetto, Jiminy, Figaro, and Cleo mourn the loss of Pinocchio. However, having proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, Pinocchio is revived and turned into a real human boy by the Blue Fairy, getting rid of the Pleasure Island curse in the process, much to everyone's joy. As the group celebrates, Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n*[[Dick Jones (actor)|Dick Jones]] as [[Pinocchio]], an exuberant and endearing wooden [[puppet]] carved by Geppetto, and brought to life by the Blue Fairy.\n*[[Cliff Edwards]] as [[Jiminy Cricket]], a cheerful, intelligent, wisecracking, optimistic and wise [[cricket (insect)|cricket]], who acts as Pinocchio's \"conscience\", and the partial narrator of the story.\n*[[Christian Rub]] as [[Geppetto]], a kind and elderly [[Wood carving|wood-carver]], who creates Pinocchio, and wishes for him to become a real boy.

Due to his popularity, he has been for long the only character of the film to be part of the official [[Disney Villains]] line-up.\n**Judels also voiced the nefarious and cunning [[The Coachman|Coachman]], owner and operator of Pleasure Island, where unruly boys are turned into donkeys and sold.

After reading the book, \"Walt was busting his guts with enthusiasm\" as Ferguson later recalled. Disney then commissioned storyboard artist [[Bianca Majolie]] to write a new story outline for the book, but after reading it, he felt her outline was too faithful.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=291}} ''Pinocchio'' was intended to be the studio's third feature, after ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942). However, due to difficulties with ''Bambi'' (adapting the story and animating the animals realistically), Disney announced that ''Bambi'' would be postponed while ''Pinocchio'' would move ahead in production. [[Ben Sharpsteen]] was then re-assigned to supervise the production while [[Jack Kinney]] was given directional reins.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=236}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=291}}\n\n=== Writing and design ===\nUnlike ''Snow White'', which was a short story that the writers could expand and experiment with, ''Pinocchio'' was based on a novel with a very fixed, although episodic, story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite AV media |url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/RdUx1RNoPkA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017080529/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdUx1RNoPkA&app=desktop |title=No Strings Attached: The Making of Pinocchio |location=''Pinocchio'' Platinum Edition |medium=DVD, Blu-Ray |year=2009 |publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment |archive-date=October 17, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman brat that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons the hard way.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=237}} The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to [[Edgar Bergen]]'s dummy [[Charlie McCarthy]],{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=294}} but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed in the early stages of animation.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=237}}\n{{multiple image\n  |direction = horizontal\n  |align     = right\n  |footer    = Early scenes animated by [[Ollie Johnston]] and [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] show that Pinocchio's design was exactly like that of a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n  |image1    = OLLIE1989.jpg\n  |width1    = 154\n  |alt1      =\n  |caption1  =[[Ollie Johnston]]\n  |image2    =FrankThomas1974.jpg\n  |width2    = 168\n  |alt2      =\n  |caption2  =[[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]]\n}}\nEarly scenes animated by [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] and [[Ollie Johnston]] show that Pinocchio's design was exactly like that of a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=237\u2013238}} Disney, however, was not impressed with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=237}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=294}} [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]] redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing, but the design still retained a wooden feel.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=238}}\n\nYoung and upcoming animator [[Milt Kahl]] felt that Thomas, Johnston, and Moore were \"rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet\" and felt that they should \"forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards\". Co-supervising director [[Hamilton Luske]] suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence.{{sfn|Canemaker|2001|p=137}}\n\nKahl then showed Disney an animation test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=306}} From this scene, Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child's [[Tyrolean hat]] and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with [[Mickey Mouse]]-type gloves on them.{{sfn|Barrier|2008|pp=140\u2013141}} The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, na\u00efve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=239}}\n\nHowever, Disney discovered that the new [[Pinocchio]] was too helpless and was far too often led astray by deceiving characters. Therefore, in the summer of 1938, Disney and his story team established the character of the cricket. Originally, the talking cricket was only a minor character that Pinocchio abruptly killed by squashing him with a mallet and that later returned as a ghost. Disney dubbed the cricket \"Jiminy\", and made him into a character that would try to guide Pinocchio into the right decisions.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=305}} Once the character was expanded, he was depicted as a realistic cricket with toothed legs and waving antennae, but Disney wanted something more likable. [[Ward Kimball]] had spent several months animating two sequences\u2014a soup-eating musical number and a bed-building sequence\u2014in ''Snow White'', which was cut from the film due to pacing reasons. Kimball was about to quit until Disney rewarded him for his work by promoting him to the supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket.{{sfn|Canemaker|2001|pp=99\u2013101}} Kimball then conjured up the design for Jiminy Cricket, whom he described as a little man with an egg head and no ears.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=240}} Jiminy \"was a cricket because we called him a cricket,\" Kimball later joked.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=305}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Jackie Kelk Dick Jones Henry Aldrich circa 1943 1944.JPG|thumb|left| [[Dickie Jones]] (right, as an adult) voices Pinocchio in the film.]]\nDue to the huge success of ''Snow White'', Walt Disney wanted more famous voices for ''Pinocchio'', which marked the first time an animated film had used celebrities as voice actors.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=304}} He cast popular singer [[Cliff Edwards]], also known as \"Ukulele Ike\", as Jiminy Cricket.<ref>{{cite web|first=William |last=Ruhlmann |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cliff-ukelele-ike-edwards-mn0000153869/biography |title=Cliff \"Ukelele ''[sic]'' Ike\" Edwards &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=February 24, 2014}}</ref> Disney rejected the idea of having an adult play Pinocchio and insisted that the character be voiced by a real child. He cast 11-year-old child actor [[Dickie Jones]], who had previously been in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/almanac-pinocchio/ |title=Almanac: \"Pinocchio\" |website=CBS News |date=February 23, 1940 |access-date=February 24, 2014}}</ref> He also cast [[Frankie Darro]] as Lampwick, [[Walter Catlett]] as \"Honest\" John Foulfellow the Fox, [[Evelyn Venable]] as the Blue Fairy, [[Charles Judels]] as both the villainous Stromboli and the Coachman, and [[Christian Rub]] as Geppetto, whose design was even a caricature of Rub.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\nAnother voice actor recruited was [[Mel Blanc]], best remembered for voicing many of the characters in [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon shorts, including [[Looney Tunes]] and [[Merrie Melodies]]. Blanc recorded the voice of [[Gideon the Cat]] in sixteen days. However, it was eventually decided that Gideon would be mute, so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blanc |first1=Mel |last2=Bashe |first2=Philip |url=https://archive.org/details/thatsnotallfolks00blan/ |title=That's Not All Folks: My Life in the Golden Age of Cartoons and Radio |page=[https://archive.org/details/thatsnotallfolks00blan/page/60/mode/1up 60] |location=New York |publisher=Warner Books |year=1988 |isbn=0446512443 |via=Internet Archive |url-access=registration}}</ref> which was heard three times in the finished film.\n\n=== Animation ===\n{{multiple image\n  |direction = vertical\n  |align     = right\n  |width     = 200\n  |footer    =\n  |image1    =Jiminy Cricket.png\n  |alt1      =\n  |caption1  =[[Jiminy Cricket]]\n  |image2    =Stromboli in Walt Disney's Pinocchio.png\n  |alt2      =\n  |caption2  =[[Mangiafuoco#In other media|Stromboli]], primarily animated by [[Bill Tytla]]\n}}\nAnimation on the film began in January 1938, but work on Pinocchio's animation was discontinued as the writers sought to re-work his characterization and the film's narrative structure. However, animation on the film's supporting characters started in April 1938.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=237\u2013238}} Animation would not resume again with the revised story until September.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=239}}\n\nDuring the production of the film, story artist [[Joe Grant]] formed a character model department, which would be responsible for building three-dimensional clay models of the characters in the film, known as maquettes. These models were then given to the staff to observe how a character should be drawn from any given angle desired by the artists.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=306}} The model makers also built working models of Geppetto's elaborate cuckoo clocks designed by Albert Hurter, as well as Stromboli's gypsy wagon and wooden cage, and the Coachman's carriage. However, owing to the difficulty of animating a realistic moving vehicle, the artists filmed the carriage maquettes on a miniature set using [[stop motion animation]]. Then, each frame of the animation was transferred onto [[Cel|animation cels]] using an early version of a [[Xerox]]. The cels were then painted on the back and overlaid on top of background images with the cels of the characters to create the completed shot on the [[rostrum camera]]. Like ''Snow White'', live-action footage was shot for ''Pinocchio'' with the actors playing the scenes in pantomime, supervised by Luske.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=260\u2013261}} Rather than tracing, which would result in stiff unnatural movement, the animators used the footage as a guide for animation by studying human movement and then incorporating some poses into the animation (though slightly exaggerated).{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=260\u2013261}}\n\n''Pinocchio'' was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, led by [[Joshua Meador]]. In contrast to the [[character animators]] who concentrate on the acting of the characters, effects animators create everything that moves other than the characters. This includes vehicles, machinery and natural effects such as rain, lightning, snow, smoke, shadows and water, as well as the fantasy or science-fiction type effects like the pixie dust of ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953). The influential abstract animator [[Oskar Fischinger]], who mainly worked on ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), contributed to the effects animation of the Blue Fairy's wand.{{sfn|Moritz|2004|p=84}} Effects animator Sandy Strother kept a diary about his year-long animation of the water effects, which included splashes, ripples, bubbles, waves and the illusion of being underwater. To help give depth to the ocean, the animators put more detail into the waves on the water surface in the foreground, and put in less detail as the surface moved further back. After the animation was traced onto cels, the assistant animators would trace it once more with blue and black pencil leads to give the waves a sculptured look.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=262}} To save time and money, the splashes were kept impressionistic. These techniques enabled ''Pinocchio'' to be one of the first animated films to have highly realistic effects animation. Ollie Johnston remarked \"I think that's one of the finest things the studio's ever done, as Frank Thomas said, 'The water looks so real a person can drown in it, and they do.'\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shadowline2000|date=2016-03-26|title=Animation Collection: Original Courvoisier Production Cel Setup of Pinocchio, Geppetto, Figaro, Cleo, and Water Effects Cels from \"Pinocchio,\" 1940|url=http://greganimationart.blogspot.com/2016/03/original-courvoisier-production-cel.html|access-date=2022-01-22|website=Animation Collection}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Pinocchio (soundtrack)}}\nThe songs in ''Pinocchio'' were composed by [[Leigh Harline]] with lyrics by [[Ned Washington]].

Keith Booker considers the film to be the most down-to-earth of the Disney animated films despite its theme song and magic, and notes that the film's protagonist has to work to prove his worth, which he remarked seemed \"more in line with the ethos of capitalism\" than most of the Disney films.{{sfn|Booker|2010|p=11}} Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh believe that the male protagonists of films like ''Pinocchio'' and ''Bambi'' (1942) were purposefully constructed by Disney to appeal to both boys and girls.{{sfn|Mitchell|Reid-Walsh|2008|p=48}} Mark I. Pinsky said that it is \"a simple morality tale\u2014cautionary and schematic\u2014ideal for moral instruction, save for some of its darker moments\", and noted that the film is a favorite of parents of young children.{{sfn|Pinsky|2004|p=28}}\n\nNicolas Sammond argues that the film is \"an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child-rearing\" and that the film is \"ultimately an assimilationist fable\".{{sfn|Honeyman|2013|p=29}} He considered it to be the central Disney film and the most strongly middle class, intended to relay the message that indulging in \"the pleasures of the working class, of vaudeville, or of pool halls and amusement parks, led to a life as a beast of burden\". For Sammond, the purpose of ''Pinocchio'' is to help convey to children the \"middle-class virtues of deferred gratification, self-denial, thrift, and perseverance, naturalized as the experience of the most average American\".{{sfn|Booker|2010|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nAuthor and illustrator [[Maurice Sendak]], who saw the film in theaters in 1940, called the film superior to Collodi's novel in its depiction of children and growing up. \"The Pinocchio in the film is not the unruly, sulking, vicious, devious (albeit still charming) marionette that Collodi created. Neither is he an innately evil, doomed-to-calamity child of sin. He is, rather, both lovable and loved. Therein lies Disney's triumph. His Pinocchio is a mischievous, innocent and very naive little wooden boy. What makes our anxiety over his fate endurable is a reassuring sense that Pinocchio is loved for himself -- and not for what he should or shouldn't be. Disney has corrected a terrible wrong. Pinocchio, he says, is good; his \"badness\" is only a matter of inexperience,\" and also that \"Pinocchio's wish to be a real boy remains the film's underlying theme, but \"becoming a real boy\" now signifies the wish to grow up, not the wish to be good.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Sendak|first=Maurice|author-link=Maurice Sendak|title= Walt Disney's Triumph - The Art of Pinocchio|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 7, 1988|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1988/07/10/walt-disneys-triumph-the-art-of-pinocchio/0f669be4-d61c-4b71-9bc9-e58900c2aa54/}}</ref>\n\n== Home media ==\nOn July 16, 1985, it was released on VHS, Betamax, CED, and [[LaserDisc]] in North America for the first time as part of the [[Walt Disney Classics]] label, the second title with the Classics label after ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1973) which was released the previous December.<ref name=ww/> It would become the best-selling home video title of the year selling 130\u2013150,000 units at $80 each.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=10|date=January 29, 1986|title=Disney Vid Points 'Sword' At March Release Schedule}}</ref> It was re-issued on October 14, 1986 to advertise the home video debut of ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959), this release also helped leave out the preview of ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' from the original 1985 VHS release due to the preview being too dark and scary for kids.
