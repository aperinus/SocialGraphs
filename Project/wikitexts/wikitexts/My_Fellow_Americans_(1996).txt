It stars [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[James Garner]] as feuding ex-presidents, with [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Esther Rolle]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], [[Wilford Brimley]], [[Bradley Whitford]] and [[Jeff Yagher]] in supporting roles. The film is named after the sentence for the traditional opening of [[President of the United States|presidential]] addresses to the American people. [[Walter Matthau]] was slated to star in the film, but he dropped out and Garner was chosen to star with Lemmon for their first film together.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2022}}\n\n[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|senator]] Russell Kramer of [[Ohio]] ([[Jack Lemmon]]) wins the presidential election, narrowly defeating archrival [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[governor]] Matt Douglas of [[Indiana]] ([[James Garner]]). Four years later, Douglas wins a landslide victory over the now-incumbent Kramer.  Another four years later, Kramer's former Vice President, William Haney ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), defeats Douglas. Haney's Vice President, Ted Matthews ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]), is widely seen as an idiot, and becomes a continuing embarrassment for the administration. Three more years later, Kramer is spending his time writing books and speaking at various inconsequential functions, while Douglas is finishing his own book and going through a divorce.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party learns about \"Olympia\", the codename for a series of bribes from [[defense contractor]] Charlie Reynolds ([[James Rebhorn]]) paid to Haney when he was Vice President. The [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman, Joe Hollis ([[Wilford Brimley]]), asks Douglas to investigate. Hollis offers the support of the Democratic Party for a presidential run in return for his help. Douglas accepts, hoping to beat Haney and get back into the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Haney and his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] Carl Witnaur ([[Bradley Whitford]]) plot to frame Kramer for the scandal, despite Haney's private acknowledgment to Witnaur that Kramer had known nothing about it. When rumors begin to suggest that Kramer was involved in Olympia, he begins his own investigation.\n\n[[National Security Agency|NSA]] agent Colonel Paul Tanner ([[Everett McGill]]) has Reynolds assassinated when he attempts to tell Douglas the truth about Olympia. Kramer arrives at the scene to find Douglas with Reynolds' body. Before they can flee, Douglas and Kramer are forced to board [[Marine One]] by Tanner, who claims that they will be taken to [[Camp David]] for their security at the request of Haney. During the flight, Douglas realizes that they are heading in the wrong direction. Suspicious, they force the pilots to land. They disembark just before the helicopter explodes.\n\nKramer and Douglas are left stranded, with the realization that the explosion was meant to kill them. They decide to go to Kramer's [[Presidential library|Presidential Library]] in [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio]], to obtain records the overly frugal Kramer kept of all meals served during his time in the White House, which will prove that Haney was present at a key meeting with Reynolds. During a series of misadventures, they meet a variety of ordinary Americans and see the effects their terms in office have had. After several close encounters with NSA agents, they arrive at the library and discover that the evidence has been tampered with to implicate Kramer. A guard gives Kramer a message from Reynolds' secretary stating that Witnaur had recently met with Reynolds. Douglas and Kramer kidnap Witnaur and with Joe Hollis's help, force him to reveal the plot to frame Kramer, though Witnaur claims to have no knowledge of the attempts on their lives, blaming Tanner. They at first decide to report Witnaur's confession to Kay Griffin ([[Sela Ward]]), a journalist, but Douglas, reflecting upon their adventure, convinces Kramer to go directly to the White House to confront Haney personally, seeing it as a chance of redemption for their poor choices as Presidents.\n\nThey manage to sneak into the White House with the help of the [[White House Executive Chef]] Rita ([[Esther Rolle]]) and make it to the [[Executive Residence]] only to discover that Haney is giving a press conference outside. Tanner traps Douglas and Kramer in a guest room but they utilize a secret tunnel to escape while the NSA gives chase. Tanner catches up with them and is about to shoot them when he himself is killed by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Sniper Lieutenant Ralph Fleming ([[Jeff Yagher]]), who has recognized the presidents from a chance encounter at a gay pride parade during their adventure.\n\nDouglas and Kramer interrupt Haney's speech and take him to the Oval Office to talk. There they play Haney a tape of Witnaur's confession, but Haney denies knowledge of Reynolds' murder or the helicopter explosion. Haney agrees to resign and proceeds to give a resignation speech, claiming to have heart problems. Douglas and Kramer muse that the idiotic Matthews will now be elevated from Vice President to President and realize that the only way it could have happened was under these circumstances.  The pair confront Matthews, who admits his stupidity is just an act and that he, not Haney, had engineered the entire plot so that he could become President, knowing Haney would take the fall. Douglas secretly records his confession on tape, and Matthews is sent to prison.\n\nNine months later, Douglas and Kramer are running together as [[Independent politician|independents]] in the Presidential election, arguing which of them will be the nominee for President. Douglas distracts Kramer by throwing a dollar on the floor, and grabs the microphone to announce himself as the Presidential candidate, much to Kramer's chagrin.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as President Russell Kramer\n* [[James Garner]] as President Matt Douglas\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as President William Haney\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Vice President Ted Matthews\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Joe Hollis\n* [[Lauren Bacall]] as First Lady Margaret Kramer\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Kaye Griffin\n* [[Everett McGill]] as NSA Agent Colonel Paul Tanner\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Chief of Staff Carl Witnaur\n* [[James Rebhorn]] as Charlie Reynolds\n* [[Esther Rolle]] as Rita, The White House Chef\n* [[Jeff Yagher]] as Lieutenant Ralph Fleming / [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]\n* [[Jack Kehler]] as Wayne\n* [[Edwin Newman]] as Himself\n* [[Jack Garner]] as President Haney's Caddy\n* [[Conchata Ferrell]] as Woman Truck Driver\n* [[Tom Everett]] as NSA Agent Wilkerson\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Ernesto\n* [[Wayne Duvall]] as Chet\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as Joanna\n}}\n\n==Filming==\nMost of the principal filming for the film was done in the mountains of western North Carolina.

It holds a 47% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 60 reviews and with an average rating of 5.3/10 and the critical consensus: \"It doesn't commit any impeachable offenses, but ''My Fellow Americans'' lacks strong regulatory oversight of its toothless political satire and misuse of comedic talent.\"<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_fellow_americans/|title=My Fellow Americans|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' praised Lemmon and Garner, but felt the film was \"a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities\". However, he said that \"a lot of the cheap shots are funny, and maybe the climate is wrong for sharply barbed political satire. I dunno.
