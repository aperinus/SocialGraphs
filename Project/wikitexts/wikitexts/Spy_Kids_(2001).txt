An animated reboot series, ''[[Spy Kids: Mission Critical]]'', premiered in 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- The plot summary should be between 400 to 700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. -->\nGregorio and Ingrid Cortez are spies with two children, Carmen and Juni, whom they shield from their lives to protect them from inherent danger. They work for the OSS doing office consultant work, but are suddenly called back to active field work to find missing agents. Gregorio suspects children's television host Fegan Floop has kidnapped them, mutating them into his \"FoOglies\" \u2013 [[Extraterrestrial life|creatures]] on his show. The children are left in the care of their uncle, Felix Gumm.\n\nThe couple is captured by Floop's \"Thumb-Thumbs\", robots whose arms, legs, and heads resemble oversized thumbs, and taken to his castle. Felix is alerted to the parents\u2019 capture, activates the fail-safe, and tells the children the truth about their parents, and that he is not their uncle but an agent sent to watch over them. The house is attacked by Ninja Thumb-Thumbs, and Felix is captured while the children escape alone on the submarine, the NIX Super Guppy, set to auto-pilot to a safe house.\n\nAt the safe house, the children discover their parents were spies and decide to rescue them. Inside Floop's castle, he introduces his latest creation to Mr. Lisp, small child-shaped robots. They plan to replace the world leaders' children with these super-strong robots to control the world. The androids have no artificial intelligence yet, so they can't function outside of their regular programming. Lisp is furious, demanding usable androids.\n\nFloop, with his second-in-command Alexander Minion, interrogates Gregorio and Ingrid about 'The Third Brain'. Ingrid knows nothing of it, while Gregorio claims he had destroyed the brain years ago. After Floop leaves, Gregorio reveals to Ingrid that the Third Brain was a secret OSS project he had worked on: an AI brain with all the skills of the entire OSS. The project was scrapped as being too dangerous, but Gregorio didn't want to destroy the final prototype.\n\nAt the safe house, Carmen and Juni are visited by OSS agent Ms. Gradenko. Giving Carmen a bracelet as a sign of trust, she asks about the Third Brain, but she doesn't know anything. Gradenko orders the house to be dismantled, and Juni sees Ninja Thumbs outside destroying the submarine because she works for Floop. With Gradenko's intentions revealed, Juni accidentally exposes the Third Brain, and a BuddyPack chase ensues. Carmen gets the brain, and she and Juni escape. She realizes too late the bracelet from Gradenko has a tracking device, and she and Juni are attacked by their robot counterparts. Though Juni tries to destroy it, he can't, so the robots take the Third Brain and fly away.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the castle, Gregorio tells Ingrid that Minion used to work for the OSS, but was fired after he reported him tampering with the Third Brain project. With it, Floop can achieve his goal, but he wishes to continue his children's show. Minion has different plans and takes over, locking Floop inside his \"virtual room,\" the chamber where he films his television series. Carmen and Juni receive reluctant help from Gregorio's estranged brother [[Machete (character)|Isador \"Machete\" Cortez]] when they show up at his spy shop. He refuses to accompany them, so they steal some gear and take his spy plane, the RX Express, to fly to Floop's castle. After a few mishaps, Carmen and Juni eject themselves from the plane before it crashes into the castle, and they enter via the underwater entrance.\n\nWhile their children infiltrate the castle, Juni rescues Floop who helps him and Carmen release their parents. Together they trap Minion in Floop's FoOglies machine, mutating him into his True form (a FoOglie) and, confronting Lisp and Gradenko, the family is beset by all 500 robot children. Machete busts through the window, reconciling with Gregorio and joining the family to fight. However, at the last moment, Floop reprograms the robots to change sides. The 500 super-strong robots quickly overpower Minion, Lisp, and Gradenko. With advice from Juni, Floop introduces the robot versions of Carmen and Juni on his show. At home, some time later, the family's breakfast is interrupted by Devlin, the head of the OSS, with a mission for Carmen and Juni. The children tell him they will only accept if all the Cortezes can work on the mission together as a family.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Gregorio Cortez, retired OSS agent, now a consultant worker and father to Juni and Carmen\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Ingrid Cortez, retired OSS agent turned consultant worker and Gregorio's wife, mother to Juni and Carmen\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as Fegan Floop, the host of Floop's Fooglies\n* [[Teri Hatcher]] as Ms. Gradenko, a former OSS agent turned associate of Mr. Lisp and Minion\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Felix Gumm, an OSS agent who pretends to be Carmen and Juni's uncle\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as [[Machete (character)|Isador \"Machete\" Cortez]]{{refn|group=nb|name=AU|Robert Rodriguez stated on a [[/r/IAmA|Reddit AmA]] that the Spy Kids movies and the Machete movies are alternate universes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ytq7j/i_am_director_robert_rodriguez_here_again_with_el/cfnpq7k?context=1 |title=I am director Robert Rodriguez, here again with El Rey.
