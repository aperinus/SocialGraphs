It is a sequel and the second part of Jodorowsky's film autobiography, which began with ''[[The Dance of Reality]]'' (2013), which focused on Jodorowsky's childhood in [[Tocopilla]] ([[Chile|northern Chile]]). ''Endless Poetry'', in turn, depicts the adolescence and youth of Jodorowsky in the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] Matucana neighborhood of [[Santiago]], in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was screened in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Quinzaine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/en/fortnight-2016/ |title=Fortnight 2016: The 48th Directors' Fortnight Selection |access-date=19 April 2016 |publisher=[[Directors' Fortnight]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420130803/http://www.quinzaine-realisateurs.com/en/fortnight-2016/ |archive-date=20 April 2016  }}</ref><ref name=\"Quinzaine-deadline\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-2016-films-lineup-full-list-1201740068/ |title=Cannes: Directors' Fortnight 2016 Lineup \u2013 Laura Poitras' 'Risk', Pablo Larrain's 'Neruda', Paul Schrader's 'Dog Eat Dog' |first=Nancy |last=Tartaglione |date=19 April 2016 |access-date=19 April 2016 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], now living in [[Santiago, Chile]] and working at his father's store, rejects the pressuring of his Jewish family to enter medical school and instead pursues a career as a poet. Through his creation of puppets he makes contact with a man who gives him a studio as his first residence. In this new life he encounters artists, poets and performers both notable and amateur, among them [[Nicanor Parra]], whom he insults during a misunderstanding about [[Stella D\u00edaz Var\u00edn]], the woman who inspired his poem \"The Viper\".\n\nHis best friend and fellow poet [[Enrique Lihn]] has a fight with his girlfriend, whom Alejandro saves from committing suicide. They have sex and she becomes pregnant. An elderly man who used to work in a circus with Alejandro's father Jaime encourages Alejandro to return to the circus, which he does as a means to laugh away his troubles. Enrique and Alejandro later reconcile.\n\nAlejandro's parents notify him that their home has burned down along with all of his writings and childhood possessions. He visits his home to say goodbye to his childhood and contemplate what he wishes to be. He visits Parra, who is teaching mathematics at an engineering school, to ask him for fatherly advice about his future. Parra urges him not to pursue a career as a poet but Alejandro ignores him and refuses to compromise.\n\nWhen a strong pro-[[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo|Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez]] sentiment arises in Chile during his second period in office Alejandro decides to leave for Paris to \"save surrealism.\" His father catches him at the dock before he leaves and attempts to drag him back into working at the store with him by force. Alejandro overpowers him and departs, never to see his father again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Ad\u00e1n Jodorowsky]] as Alejandro (teenager)\n* [[Jeremias Herskovits]] as Alejandro (boy)\n* [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] as himself\n* [[Brontis Jodorowsky]] as Jaime\n* [[Pamela Flores]] as Sara and [[Stella D\u00edaz Var\u00edn]]\n* [[Leandro Taub (actor)|Leandro Taub]] as [[Enrique Lihn]]\n* Julia Avenda\u00f1o as Peque\u00f1ita\n* [[Felipe R\u00edos (actor)|Felipe R\u00edos]] as [[Nicanor Parra]]\n* Carolyn Carlson as Maria Lefevre\n* [[Basti\u00e1n Bodenh\u00f6fer]] as [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]]\n* Felipe Pe\u00f1a as [[Gustavo Becerra-Schmidt]]\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 94%, based on 52 reviews, and an average rating of 7.3/10.
