The film marks the second collaboration between actor Lee Byung-hun and director Kim Jee-woon, who had previously collaborated on the action drama ''[[A Bittersweet Life]]'' (2005) and would later do so again in Kim's ''[[I Saw the Devil]]'' (2010).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the desert wilderness of [[Manchukuo|Manchuria]] in 1939, months before the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Park Chang-yi, The Bad ([[Lee Byung-hun]])\u2014a bandit and hitman\u2014is hired to acquire a treasure map from a Japanese official traveling by train. Before he can get it however, Yoon Tae-goo, The Weird ([[Song Kang-ho]])\u2014a [[Honghuzi|thief]]\u2014steals the map and is caught up in The Bad's derailment of the train. This involves the slaughter of the Japanese and Manchurian guards, and various civilians. Park Do-won, The Good ([[Jung Woo-sung]])\u2014an eagle-eyed bounty hunter\u2014appears on the scene to claim the bounty on Chang-yi. Meanwhile, Tae-goo escapes, eluding his Good and Bad pursuers. A fourth force\u2014a group of Manchurian bandits\u2014also want the map to sell to the [[black market|Ghost Market]]. Tae-goo hopes to uncover the map's secrets and recover what he believes is gold and riches buried by the [[Qing Dynasty]] just before the collapse of their government. As the story continues, an escalating battle for the map occurs, with bounties placed on heads and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] racing to reclaim its map as it can apparently \"save the Japanese Empire\".\n\nAfter a series of graphic shootouts and chases, a final battle erupts in which the Japanese army, Manchurian bandits, Do-won, Chang-yi and his gang are chasing Tae-goo all at once. The Japanese army kills most of the bandits. Do-won kills many Japanese soldiers and sets off an explosion that drives them away. Chang-yi's gang is slowly killed off and he kills those that attempt to leave the chase. Only Chang-yi, Tae-goo and Do-won make it to the \"treasure\". However, they find that it is nothing more than a boarded-over hole in the desert. Chang-yi recognizes Tae-goo as the \"Finger Chopper\"\u2014a criminal that cut off his finger in a knife fight five years ago\u2014and the man that Do-won had thought Chang-yi to be. Turning on each other in a final act of vengeance for the slights they suffered, they finally gun each other down after a prolonged [[Mexican standoff]]. The three lie in the sand, dying and alone, as the \"useless hole\" that they fought and died for suddenly and belatedly erupts with a geyser of [[crude oil]]. Do-won survives along with Tae-goo. With a newly raised bounty on Tae-goo, a new chase begins as he flees across the Manchurian desert.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Yoon Tae-goo, the Weird\n* [[Lee Byung-hun]] as Park Chang-yi, the Bad\n* [[Jung Woo-sung]] as Park Do-won, the Good\n* [[Yoon Je-moon]] as Byeong-choon, Manchurian Bandit Leader's Right-hand man\n* [[Ryu Seung-soo]] as Man-gil, Yoon Tae-goo's friend\n* Song Yeong-chang as Kim Pan-joo\n* [[Ma Dong-seok]] as Gom ([[Bear]])\n* [[Son Byong-ho]] as Seo Jae-sik\n* [[Oh Dal-su]] as Park Seo-bang\n* [[Uhm Ji-won]] as Na-yeon ([[cameo appearance|cameo]])\n* [[Oh Yeon-ah]] as Japanese female train passenger ([[cameo appearance|cameo]])\n\n==Alternative versions==\nTwo versions of the film were released in cinemas: one being for the native Korean market and the other for international sales.

In the alternative ending, ''The Weird'', Tae-goo, gets up. He reveals the thick metal sheet he hid under his quilted jacket and limps over to demolish the corpse of Chang-yi, ''The Bad''. While doing so, he discovers diamonds in Chang-yi's pocket and giggles with delight before realising he's surrounded by the Japanese army. Inadvertently lighting a stick of dynamite, Tae-goo scares off the Japanese and dives for cover after realising it was lit. Over the credits, Tae-goo sets off to continue hunting for the treasure with his bounty multiplied sevenfold, while ''The Good'', Do-won, vindictively pursues him.
