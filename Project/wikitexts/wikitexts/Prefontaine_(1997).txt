[[Jared Leto]] plays the title character and [[R. Lee Ermey]] plays [[Bill Bowerman]]. The film was written by [[Steve James (film producer)|Steve James]] and Eugene Corr, and directed by James. ''Prefontaine'' tells the story from the point of view of [[Bill Dellinger]], played by [[Ed O'Neill]], the assistant coach who was with him day-to-day, and Nancy Alleman, the runner's girlfriend at the time of his death.\n\n==Plot==\nSteve Prefontaine, a [[Coos Bay, Oregon]] student, is too small to play most sports but becomes a talented distance runner. He enrolls at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1969, and meets fellow [[Oregon Ducks track and field]] athletes Pat Tyson and [[Mac Wilkins]]. With coaches [[Bill Bowerman]] and [[Bill Dellinger]], \"Pre\" wins three national cross-country championships and four consecutive [[5k run|5,000-meter run]]s, breaking the U.S. record in the latter. Prefontaine gains fame as an aggressive runner who likes to be out front from the start, rather than biding his time until a strong finish.\n\nPrefontaine accompanies other top American runners including [[Frank Shorter]] and [[Jeff Galloway]] to the 1972 [[Munich Olympics]], where they witness the terrorist attacks of the [[Munich Massacre]] which interrupt and almost cancel the games. In the 5,000-meter, Prefontaine leads with 150 meters to go, but three different runners pass him and he does not medal. The gold goes to Finland's [[Lasse Viren]].\n\nAfter his college career ends, Prefontaine prepares for a rematch with Viren at the 1976 [[Montreal Olympics]]. The strict amateurism rules of American non-collegiate sports force Prefontaine to turn down a lucrative offer to become a professional runner, instead working as a bartender while living in a [[trailer home]]. He becomes an activist to help American athletes compete against better-funded international rivals. On May 30, 1975, after drinking alcohol at a post-meet party, Prefontaine is killed when his [[MG Cars|MG convertible]] flips while he is driving. After his death, the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]] gives athletes more control over their sports' governance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jared Leto]] as [[Steve Prefontaine]]\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as [[Bill Dellinger]]\n* [[R. Lee Ermey]] as [[Bill Bowerman]]\n* [[Amy Locane]] as [[Nancy Alleman]]\n* [[Breckin Meyer]] as [[Pat Tyson]]\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as [[Elfriede Prefontaine]]\n* Brian McGovern as [[Mac Wilkins]]\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as [[Curtis Cunningham]]\n* [[Laurel Holloman]] as [[Elaine Finley]]\n\n==Production==\nThe majority of the film was shot at the [[University of Puget Sound]] campus in [[Tacoma, Washington]]. [[Peyton Field]] was redecorated to resemble [[Hayward Field]] at the [[University of Oregon]]. For the role of Steve Prefontaine, [[Jared Leto]] immersed himself in the runner's life, meeting with members of the family and friends.<ref name=\"sundance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/prefontaine-premieres-at-sundance|title='Prefontaine' premieres at Sundance|first=Roger|last=Ebert|publisher=Roger Ebert|date=January 23, 1997|access-date=December 8, 2013}}</ref> He bore a striking resemblance to the real Prefontaine, also adopting the athlete's voice and upright running style.<ref>{{cite journal|date=September 28, 1998|title=His So-Called Life's on a Roll|first=Louis B.|last=Hobson|journal=Calgary Sun}}</ref> The transformation was so complete that when the runner's sister, Linda, first saw him in character, she broke down and cried.<ref>{{cite journal|date=May 12, 1997|title=Sure, he can run|journal=People Weekly|volume=47|issue=18|pages=94}}</ref> ''Prefontaine'' explores American athletes' amateur status and the conditions and lack of resources these athletes had to endure in their attempts to compete with the world's top athletes, who were provided all they needed to train and compete at a top level, while dealing with the pressure from their American fans who expected nothing but the best from them.\n\n==Critical reception==\nUpon its premiere at the 1997 [[Sundance Film Festival]], ''Prefontaine'' was positively received by critics and audiences, who greatly praised the film for Leto's acting and James' direction.<ref name=\"sundance\"/> As of March 2020, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 56% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 36 reviews with an average score of 6.31 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prefontaine/|title=Prefontaine (1997)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|access-date=July 2, 2019}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 56 based on 15 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/prefontaine|title=Prefontaine Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=December 8, 2013}}</ref> Film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] praised the film giving it \"two thumbs up\" on their [[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|television program]].\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Without Limits]]'', another film based on Prefontaine's life.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0119937|title=Prefontaine}}\n* {{Mojo title|prefontaine|Prefontaine}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|prefontaine|Prefontaine}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Prefontaine}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161205133219/http://www.moviesmackdown.com/2007/07/without-limits.html ''Without Limits -vs- Prefontaine''] at [http://www.moviesmackdown.com Movie Smackdown]\n\n{{Steve James}}\n\n[[Category:1997 drama films]]\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1990s sports films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American track and field films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Eugene, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Sports films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films about the 1972 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Films about Olympic track and field]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Steve James]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about sportspeople]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about educators]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of track and field athletes]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of American men]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mason Daring]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
