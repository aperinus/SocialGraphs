These prisoners were made to assist the camp's guards in shepherding their victims to the [[gas chamber]]s and then disposing of their bodies in the ovens.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in October 1944, in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[extermination camp]]. A small group of ''[[Sonderkommando]]'', prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an [[insurrection]] that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four [[crematoria]] and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from [[Polish people|Polish]] citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the men's camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely [[torture]]d but they don't reveal the plot. A [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian-Jewish]] doctor, [[Mikl\u00f3s Nyiszli]], who works for the [[Nazi]] doctor [[Josef Mengele]] in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele to visit his wife and daughter in the women's [[labor camp]]. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengele's orders will keep them from the gas chambers.\n\nA new trainload of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Jewish prisoners arrives and are sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about \"delousing\", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the ''Sonderkommandos'', Hoffman, who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber and after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer, takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the children's camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, [[SS]]-''[[Oberscharf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Eric Muhsfeldt]] suddenly walks in. Noticing that one of the prisoners present, Abramowics, is there illegally, he shoots him, prompting the girl to scream and to be discovered. Nyiszli then takes Muhsfeldt outside and tells him about the uprising but cannot tell him where or when it will begin. Muhsfeldt agrees to protect the young girl after the uprising is suppressed.\n\nThe insurrection begins and Crematorium IV is destroyed with the smuggled explosives. All the ''Sonderkommando'' prisoners who survive the explosions and gunfights with the SS are captured. They are held until the fire in the crematorium is extinguished, after which they are executed. Hoffmann and a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal, conclude that the girl will not be set free after she is forced to watch the executions. After all captives are shot, the girl is allowed to flee toward the main gate of the camp. Before she can run very far, Muhsfeldt draws his pistol and shoots her. The film closes with a voice-over recitation by the dead girl.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[David Arquette]] as Hoffman\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as \"Hesch\" Abramowics\n* David Chandler as Max Rosenthal\n* [[Allan Corduner]] as Dr. [[Mikl\u00f3s Nyiszli]]\n* [[Daniel Benzali]] as Simon Schlermer\n* [[Mira Sorvino]] as Dina\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Rosa\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Cohen\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as [[Eric Muhsfeldt]]\n* Kamelia Grigorova as the Girl\n* Velizar Binev as [[Otto Moll]]\n* [[Henry Stram]] as [[Josef Mengele]]\n* [[Lee Wilkof]] as Morris\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Morris's Wife\n* [[Hristo Shopov]] as Halivni\n* [[Br\u00edan F.
