Altman]]. Based on the [[The House of the Dead|video game franchise of the same name]] by [[Sega]], it is not a direct adaptation of the individual entries; Boll described the film as a prequel to the [[The House of the Dead (video game)|original 1996 game]]. It stars [[Jonathan Cherry]], [[Tyron Leitso]], [[Clint Howard]], [[Ona Grauer]], [[Ellie Cornell]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]]. The film takes place on a fictional island infested by zombies, forcing survivors to fight their way off. ''House of the Dead'' was Boll's first film to be released theatrically, in addition to his first video game adaptation.\n\nUpon release, ''House of the Dead'' was universally panned by critics, giving Boll a negative reputation that would continue throughout his career. Commercially, the film grossed $13.8 million on a $12 million budget. A [[House of the Dead 2 (film)|sequel]] was released to home media in 2006, with only Cornell returning.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter booking a boat trip to attend a rave on an island located off the coast of [[Seattle]] named \"Isla del Morte\" (\"Island of Death\"), two college students, Simon and Greg meet up with three girls: Alicia, Karma and Greg's girlfriend Cynthia. After arriving at the dock, the five find that they are late and the boat that is supposed to take them to Isla del Morte has already left. Victor Kirk, a boat captain, and his first mate Salish offer them a ride on their boat.\n\nArriving at Isla del Morte, they find the rave site messed up and deserted. Alicia, Karma and Simon leave the site to go find anybody around while Cynthia and Greg stay behind. As Greg and Cynthia are about to engage in sex in a tent, the former leaves to urinate. Alone in the tent, Cynthia is killed by a group of zombies. Meanwhile, Alicia, Karma and Simon find a derelict house and as they attempt to investigate the place, they discover Alicia's ex-boyfriend Rudy, Liberty and Hugh, who inform them of a zombie attack during the rave. The six leave the house to fetch Greg and Cynthia. Meanwhile, the zombies kill Salish when he is alone in the forest.\n\nAlicia, Rudy, Karma, Simon, Liberty and Hugh return to the rave site where they find Greg. A zombified Cynthia comes out from behind a tree and kills Hugh but is killed when Casper, a Coast Guard officer who was tracking Kirk, arrives and shoots her. They form a plan to return to Kirk's boat and leave the island. When they return to the beach they find zombies on Kirk's boat. Casper and Greg leave the group to go find help, but Greg is killed in the forest.\n\nKirk reveals the island's history; Isla del Morte was home to Castillo Sermano, a Spanish Catholic priest that was banished from Spain in the 15th century for his dark experiments, which the Catholic Church forbade. Castillo murdered the crew of St. Cristobal, the ship that was taking him to the island, enslaved the island's natives, and murdered anyone who visited the place. He then created an immortality serum which he injected himself with, allowing him to live forever and return dead souls to life and support his cause. Kirk leads the group to a spot in the forest where he has hidden a box full of guns and weaponry. Once everyone is armed, they decide to head back to the house only to find the courtyard filled with zombies. Liberty and Casper are killed in the ensuing fight and Alicia, Rudy, Kirk, Karma and Simon manage to take shelter inside the house.\n\nWhen Kirk is alone, he hears Salish whistling outside. He goes outside and sees Salish now zombfied. Kirk sacrifices himself by killing Salish and a bunch of zombies with a stick of dynamite, but the explosion also blows up the entrance to the house. The remaining four lock themselves in a lab inside the house, but the zombies break in. Karma finds a hatch in the floor which she, Alicia and Rudy use to escape. Simon sacrifices himself to kill the zombies by shooting a barrel of gunpowder, blowing up the house and the zombies. Alicia, Rudy and Karma find themselves in tunnels. They make their way through the tunnels, but Karma is killed by zombies as she attempts to hold them off as Rudy and Alicia flee.\n\nAlicia and Rudy are aided out of the tunnels by a mysterious man wearing Greg's face as a mask. The man is revealed to be Castillo Sermano, who then orders a horde of zombies to restrain Alicia and Rudy in an attempt to kill them and use their flesh for his own purposes. Alicia and Rudy escape Castillo, blowing the tunnels up in the process. Castillo manages to survive the explosion and Alicia gets into a sword fight with him. Castillo impales her heart, and Rudy manages to decapitate him soon after. However, the still-alive headless body of Castillo begins to strangle Rudy. Alicia, who is barely alive, gets up and crushes the head under her foot, which finally kills him. Although Alicia seemingly dies, she and Rudy are rescued by a team of agents. The agents ask for Rudy's name, to which he responds with \"Rudolph Curien\" (implying this film is a prequel to [[The House of the Dead (video game)|''The House of the Dead'' arcade game]]). The ending narration reveals that Rudy gave Alicia the immortality serum. The two survivors return home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jonathan Cherry]] as Rudy\n* [[Tyron Leitso]] as Simon\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Salish\n* [[Ona Grauer]] as Alicia\n* [[Ellie Cornell]] as Casper\n* Will Sanderson as Greg \n* [[Enuka Okuma]] as Karma\n* Kira Clavell as Liberty\n* [[Sonya Salomaa]] as Cynthia\n* [[Michael Eklund]] as Hugh \n* [[David Palffy]] as Castillo\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Kirk\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Adam J.

The clip was shot on location on the original set, parallel to the shooting of the movie, and shows the artist, who is himself made up as a zombie, in the midst of a group of dancing zombies from the film. This parody-like part was contrasted in a parallel montage of numerous, extremely violent scenes featuring the original cast, which caused many broadcasters to refuse to play the clip in heavy rotation.\n\n'''Songs that are not included on the soundtrack album'''\n* \"Fury (House of the Dead)\" by [[Black Tiger (rapper)|Black Tiger]]\n* \"Danger\" by [[Oliver Lieb]] featuring [[Keith Flint]]\n* \"Zombie Island\" and \"Abu Dhabi\" by Codetrasher\n* \"The Rotten Smell\" by The Horror Boogies\n\n===Score===\n{{infobox album\n| name         = House of the Dead: <br> The Classical Score\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = Reinhard Besser\n| released     = March 29, 2013<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[iTunes]]|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/house-of-the-dead-the-classical-score-original-soundtrack/id626339869|title=House of the Dead - The Classical Score (Original Soundtrack) by Reinhard Besser|access-date=July 2, 2017}}</ref>\n| genre        = [[Film score]]\n| label        = Playground Worldwide\n| length       = 34:24\n}}\n\nThe film's score was composed by German composer Reinhard Besser.
