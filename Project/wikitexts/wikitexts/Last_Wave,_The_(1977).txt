Heavy rainfall followed by unusually large chunks of hail breaking through the windows of the school injuring students, a frog infestation and other anomalies. Only the local Aboriginal people seem to recognize the [[Cosmology|cosmological]] significance of these weather phenomena.\n\nDuring one of these freak rainstorms in [[Sydney]], an altercation occurs among a group of Aboriginal people in a [[Public house|pub]] which results in a mysterious drowning death. At the [[Coroner's inquest#Inquest|coroner's inquest]], the death is ruled a homicide and four of the Aboriginal men are accused of murder. Through the [[Legal aid#Australia|Australian Legal Aid system]], a lawyer named David Burton ([[Richard Chamberlain]]) is procured for their defence. Due to internal politics and the eschatological divide between the European settlers and Indigenous people, the circumstances by which he was contacted and retained are unusual in that his law practice is [[Taxation in Australia#Corporate taxes|corporate taxation]] and not [[Criminal law of Australia|criminal defence]]. He is reluctant at first but is intrigued by the challenge and takes on the case which shortly leads to his professional and personal life beginning to unravel.\n\nBurton starts having bizarre dreams involving running water, drowned corpses, and one of being visited in his home by one of the incarcerated Aboriginals named Chris Lee ([[David Gulpilil]]), whom he had never met. When later introduced to the four accused men, he recognizes Lee and begins to sense an otherworldly connection to him and to the increasingly strange weather phenomena besetting the city. His dreams intensify along with his obsession with the murder case and he comes to suspect that the murder was an Aboriginal tribal execution in which a curse is put on the victim simply by pointing a bone at him. Lee refuses to admit that he is tribal or reveals anything about the murder but tells Burton that his dreams have meaning because he is \"Mulkurul\"; descended from a race of spirits who came from the rising sun bringing sacred objects with them. After meeting with the shaman of Lee's tribe and learning more about Aboriginal practices and the concept of [[Dreamtime]] as a parallel world of existence, Burton comes to believe that his dreams and the strange heavy rain bodes as signs of a coming [[apocalypse]]. After another intense dream, Burton senses danger and persuades his wife to leave the city with their children right before a torrential storm causes a flooding disaster.\n\nIn the chaos of the flood, Lee manages to escape from prison to find Burton and take him down through subterranean tunnels under the city which lead to a sacred Aboriginal ritual site. Lee shows him the entrance to another ancient chamber nearby that is strangely familiar to him and sends him off to find the answers that he seeks. In the chamber, Burton sees a painting on the ceiling depicting the arrival of European explorers from South America and a calendrical prophecy of a cataclysmic oceanic disaster. He finds a collection of ancient relics, a decayed corpse of a man wearing middle-age Western garments and a stone mask which after close inspection, bears a face identical to his own. He collects as many relics as he can carry but is suddenly confronted by the tribe's [[shaman]] shouting and lunging at him. They struggle and Burton kills the shaman with one of the stone relics. He tries to find his way back to the surface through the sewer tunnels, but he loses the relics along the way. He finally emerges through a drain pipe exhausted, then collapses on the beach and stares entranced at the horizon. He realizes that he can never go back to his old life after what had just happened. Then we see the look of both shock and acceptance on his face as the screen is filled by footage of a surreal towering ocean wave, though it remains unclear whether we are witnessing reality or sharing in Burton's final apocalyptic premonition.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Richard Chamberlain]] as David Burton\n*[[Olivia Hamnett]] as Annie Burton\n*[[David Gulpilil]] as Chris Lee\n*[[Fred Parslow]] as Reverend Burton\n*[[Vivean Gray]] as Dr Whitburn\n*Nandjiwarra Amagula as Charlie\n*Walter Amagula as Gerry Lee\n*Roy Bara as Larry\n*Cedrick Lalara as Lindsey\n*Morris Lalara as Jacko\n*[[Peter Carroll (actor)|Peter Carroll]] as Michael Zeadler\n*Athol Compton as Billy Corman\n*Hedley Cullen as Judge\n*Michael Duffield as Andrew Potter\n*[[Wallas Eaton]] as Morgue Doctor\n\n==Production==\nIn an interview on the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD release, director Peter Weir explains that the film explores the question, \"What if someone with a very pragmatic approach to life experienced a premonition?\" Entered in the 6th Tehran International Film Festival in November 1977, the film won the Golden Ibex prize.\n\nFinance was provided by the [[Australian Film Commission]] ($120,000), the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] ($120,000), Janus Films (US$50,000) and [[United Artists]] ($350,000).
