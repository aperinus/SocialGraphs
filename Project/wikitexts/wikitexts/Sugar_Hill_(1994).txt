It stars [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]] as brothers Roemello and Raynathan Skuggs. Considered the second film of Cooper's \"Harlem Trilogy\", it focuses on the two brothers who are major drug dealers in the [[New York City]] neighborhood of [[Harlem]], specifically the namesake [[Sugar Hill, Manhattan|Sugar Hill]].\n\n==Plot==\nThrough the course of the film, several flashbacks are shown involving the Skuggs brothers, including (in the beginning of the film) the drug-overdose death of their mother Ella ([[Khandi Alexander]]), the non-fatal shooting of their drug-addicted musician father, Arthur Romello \"A.R.\" Skuggs ([[Clarence Williams III]]) (ultimately at the hands of the man they would later work for\u2014Gus Molino ([[Abe Vigoda]]), and a scene where Roemello is offered a full scholarship to Georgetown.\n\nRoemello as a teenager ([[Dul\u00e9 Hill]]) avenges his father's shooting by shooting and killing Sal Marconi ([[Raymond Serra]]), Gus's cousin.  After contemplating for a while, Roemello decides to quit dealing and start a new life with his girlfriend, Melissa ([[Theresa Randle]]), to the disdain of Raynathan, who is scared and hesitant to leave the drug game.  However, Roemello learns that getting out is nowhere near as easy as getting in.\n\nA series of events lead up to Roemello's eventual departure from the drug game, such as the death of his best friend, Ricky Goggles ([[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]]) at the hands of an up-and-coming Brooklyn drug dealer and former boxing champion, Lolly Jonas ([[Ernie Hudson]]).  The Skuggs brothers and their associates find Ricky's burned body hanging from the side of a neighborhood apartment building.  They later go after and then kill Tony Adamo, one of the other men responsible for Ricky Goggles\u2019 death.  Because of this, an eventual street war starts off between The Skuggs crew and Lolly's organization.\n\nMelissa becomes more hesitant of being involved with Roemello, because of his lifestyle.  After learning of the death of an aspiring teenage \u201cstick-up kid\u201d, Kymie ([[Donald Faison]]) in Roemello's neighborhood (Kymie, in fact, saves Roemello's life in a drive-in shooting by Lolly's people), she decides to break off with Roemello and would have one date with basketball star, Mark Doby ([[Vondie Curtis Hall]]).\n\nThe date starts off fine as Mark takes Melissa back to his house but he becomes drunk, physically and verbally abuses Melissa and nearly rapes her by forcing her to perform oral sex. She barely escapes by punching Mark in the groin and running out the door. As she returns home, she is shamed by her mother for being a \u201ctramp\u201d. She finally returns to Roemello and they begin to make plans to leave New York City.\n\nBefore Roemello and Melissa depart for North Carolina, they stop by to visit A.R.  However, upon arriving at A.R.\u2019s apartment, they find him dead of a drug overdose.  Raynathan gave A.R. the heroin that would eventually kill him, with Raynathan\u2019s reasoning being that he wanted \u201cput him out of his misery\u201d.  Raynathan is found across the street, coming out of Gus\u2019 restaurant, where he gunned down Gus, Lolly, and Harry, Gus's son.\n\nRoemello tells Raynathan what happened to A.R., but Raynathan accepts responsibility of their father's death.  After seeing Melissa waiting for Roemello, Raynathan fires his gun at her, and the brothers proceed to fight each other and Raynathan accidentally shoots Roemello.  Realizing this, Raynathan panics and fatally shoots himself in the stomach.\n\nRoemello and Melissa, sometime later, do move to North Carolina, where they have a young son, but Roemello is found in a wheelchair, likely paralyzed from the waist down (though the extent of the paralysis is not fully explained), however he is enjoying family life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Romello \"Rome\" Skuggs\n* [[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]] as Raynathan \"Ray\" Skuggs\n* [[Clarence Williams III]] as Arthur Romello \"A.R.\" Skuggs\n* [[Theresa Randle]] as Melissa\n* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Gus Molino\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Lolly Jonas\n* [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]] as Ricky \"Goggles\"\n* [[O.L.
