It is the third film in the [[Beverly Hills Cop (franchise)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' franchise]].\n\nMurphy again plays Detroit cop [[Axel Foley]], who once again returns to [[Beverly Hills, California]], to stop a gang of counterfeiters who are responsible for the death of his boss. Foley teams up with his friend, Beverly Hills detective [[Billy Rosewood]] ([[Judge Reinhold]]), and his investigation leads him to an amusement park known as [[California's Great America|Wonder World]]. The film features a number of cameo appearances by well-known film personalities, including [[Robert B. Sherman]], [[Arthur Hiller]], [[John Singleton]], [[Joe Dante]], [[Barbet Schroeder]], [[Peter Medak]], special effects legend [[Ray Harryhausen]], and [[George Lucas]] as a ride patron. It is also the first film in the series not to involve producers [[Don Simpson]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], who opted out of the film's production due to budgetary disagreements.\n\n''Beverly Hills Cop III'' was released on May 25, 1994, and grossed [[United States dollar|$]]42.6 million in the United States, and $76.5 million at the foreign box office for a worldwide total of $119.2 million. The film received negative reviews from critics, and was considered by them and Murphy himself as the weakest film in the trilogy.<ref name=\"Eddie Murphy: 'Beverly Hills Cop 3' Was 'Garbage'\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/eddie-murphy-beverly-hills-cop-772704 |title=Eddie Murphy: 'Beverly Hills Cop 3' Was 'Garbage' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]], February 12, 2015 |access-date=2015-02-12}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words. -->\nOne night in Detroit, Axel Foley plans to arrest a gang of car thieves who run a local [[chop shop]]. Unbeknownst to his superior, Inspector G. Douglas Todd, Axel has canceled the [[SWAT]], intending to raid the shop using only his team. Meanwhile, a group of four men arrive at the chop shop to pick up a [[cube van]] that the car thieves had hijacked. The leader of the group confirms that the vehicle still contains its cargo, which consists of crates labeled as property of the U.S. government, then has his men execute the car thieves.\n\nAs the murderers are about to leave, Axel, unaware of what has happened inside, proceeds with his plan to enter the shop and quickly finds his team outgunned. Todd, arriving moments later, is killed by the group's leader. When the perpetrators escape in the cube van, an angry Axel gives chase in one of the partially disassembled cars from the shop, but is intercepted by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agent Steve Fulbright. Fulbright informs Axel that the killer must remain on the loose because the federal government is pursuing a larger scheme in which he is involved.\n\nAfter Todd's funeral, Axel learns that several clues left behind by the killers point to Wonder World, a theme park in [[Beverly Hills, California]], owned by \"Uncle Dave\" Thornton. Axel arrives in Beverly Hills and reunites with his friend Billy Rosewood, who has been promoted to \"Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command\" (DDO-JSIOC), and meets Jon Flint, Billy's new partner after John Taggart's retirement. Flint calls his friend Ellis DeWald, the head of Wonder World's park security, to let him know that Axel's coming to the park for his investigation.\n\nAxel meets and befriends Janice Perkins, a park employee, whilst touring the park's underground behind-the-scenes facilities. Later, he is observed by security, shot at and attacked hand-to-hand. Axel retreats to the surface, where he cuts in line to enter the [[Sky Whirl|''Spider'']] [[Ferris wheel]] ride. The guards accidentally jam the ride, placing two little children's lives in danger. Axel rescues them and is subsequently taken to park manager Orrin Sanderson. When DeWald is called in to contest the claim that Axel was attacked by the security guards without prior challenge, Axel immediately recognizes DeWald as Todd's killer, but Rosewood and Flint refuse to believe that claim because DeWald is keeping an impeccable public reputation. However, Axel is later visited in his motel room by Uncle Dave and Janice, who inform him that the Wonder World park's designer and Dave's close friend, Roger Frye, has mysteriously disappeared while inspecting the grounds two weeks earlier, leaving only a letter with a cryptic message.\n\nAxel tries to heckle DeWald into revealing his criminal involvements, despite continued admonishments by Fulbright, but DeWald proves too smooth to be caught in a mistake. When Axel later digs deeper into a closed-off section of the park, he finds out that DeWald and Sanderson run a [[counterfeit]]ing ring that uses Wonder World as a front, and DeWald was at the chop shop in Detroit to get his hands on blank printing paper used for American currency. Axel later meets with Uncle Dave to ask him about further details to find a piece of viable evidence, and thereby discovers that Frye's warning letter is actually written on a sheet of the stolen mint paper. Before he can make use of that evidence, however, Uncle Dave is shot by DeWald, and Axel is framed for his shooting.\n\nAfter getting away from DeWald and bringing Uncle Dave to a hospital, Axel sets out to prove his innocence by storming the park, calling Rosewood and Flint to assist him. The resulting shootout kills DeWald's henchmen, and after a hand-to-hand fight Axel shoots and kills DeWald, thus avenging Todd. During the fight, Sanderson is shot dead in the print shop by Agent Fulbright, who then appears before Axel to explain that he was right. Axel realizes Fulbright's actual involvement with the counterfeiters and fatally shoots him during a brief struggle. Uncle Dave makes a full recovery, and he thanks Axel for his assistance by creating a new character for Wonder World with his name, Axel Fox; and Janice takes Axel, now in a wheelchair, away from the festivities to show him the 'Tunnel of Love'.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Detective [[Axel Foley]]\n* [[Judge Reinhold]] as Sergeant Billy Rosewood\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo|Hector Elizondo]] as Detective Jon Flint\n* [[Timothy Carhart]] as Ellis DeWald\n* [[John Saxon]] as Orrin Sanderson\n* [[Theresa Randle]] as Janice Perkins\n* [[Alan Young]] as Uncle Dave Thornton\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as Secret Service Agent Steve Fulbright\n* [[Tracy Melchior]] as Ticket Booth Lady\n* [[Bronson Pinchot]] as Serge\n* [[Gil Hill]] as Inspector Douglas Todd\n* [[Hattie Winston]] as Mrs. Todd\n* [[Jon Tenney]] as Detective Levine\n* [[Joey Travolta]] as Giolito\n* Eugene Collier as Leppert\n* [[Lindsey Ginter]] as Holloway\n* [[Dan Martin (actor)|Dan Martin]] as Cooper\n* [[Forry Smith]] as Rondy\n* Gregory McKinney as Kimbrough\n* David Parry as Taddeo\n* [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] as Fletch\n* [[Helen Martin]] as Grandma\n* Symba Smith as Annihilator Girl #1\n* [[Julie Strain]] as Annihilator Girl #2\n* Heather Elizabeth Parkhurst as Annihilator Girl #3\n* [[Al Green]] as Minister\n* [[John Singleton]] as Fireman\n* [[George Lucas]] as Disappointed Man\n* [[Arthur Hiller]] as Bar Patron #1\n* [[Ray Harryhausen]] as Bar Patron #2\n* [[Robert B.

I don't need the money and it's not gonna break any new ground. How often can you have Axel Foley talk fast and get into a place he doesn't belong? But these motherfuckers are developing scripts for it. They're in pre-production. The only reason to do a ''Cop III'' is to beat the bank, and Paramount ain't gonna write me no check as big as I want to do something like that. In fact, if I do a ''Cop III'', you can safely say, 'Ooh, he must have got a ''lot'' of money!'\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Bill|last=Zehme|title=The Rolling Stone interview: Eddie Murphy|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 24, 1989|page=130}}</ref>\n\nDuring the script's early drafts, the plot concerned Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart going to London to rescue Captain Bogomil ([[Ronny Cox]]), who was being held hostage by terrorists during an International Police Convention. However, problems such as scripting issues and budgeting caused pre-production to slow to the point where both John Ashton and Ronny Cox had to drop out due to obligations to other film projects. Ashton's part was re-written as John Flint (H\u00e9ctor Elizondo) and dialogue was inserted to explain that Taggart had retired and moved to Phoenix. Cox's character's absence is never addressed in this film, nor is he mentioned. However, Ashton and Cox make subtle cameos in the form of a picture on Rosewood's desk of Foley, Taggart, Rosewood, and Bogomil on a fishing trip. This is the same picture that appeared in ''Cop II'' on Bogomil's and Foley's desks.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In an interview in 2012, Ronny Cox said, \"They wanted me to be in ''Beverly Hills Cop III'', but...I read the script.\"<ref name=\"Random Roles: Deliverance\u2019s Ronny Cox on RoboCop, Total Recall, and the glory of Cop Rock.

Club, July 5, 2012 |access-date=2012-07-06|work=www.avclub.com}}</ref>\n\nRejected ideas for ''Cop III'' included a [[Robert Towne]] screenplay (in which Foley has to deal with his celebrity status), a scenario teaming Murphy with [[Sean Connery]] as a [[Scotland Yard]] detective, and another Axel-in-London idea where his Scotland Yard counterpart would have been played by [[John Cleese]]. The last would have involved British gangsters, loosely based on the real-life [[Kray twins|Kray brothers]], who were captured in Detroit and transported to London by Jeffrey (Axel's friend from ''Beverly Hills Cop'' and ''Beverly Hills Cop II'', played by [[Paul Reiser]]), and Axel would have gone overseas after the gangsters' henchmen broke them out of custody and murdered Jeffrey. This was scrapped because producers [[Don Simpson]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] decided it was too close to the story of [[Michael Douglas]]' 1989 film ''[[Black Rain (American film)|Black Rain]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nWhen writer [[Steven E. de Souza]] was brought in, he originally wrote the story as more \"''[[Die Hard]]'' in a [[theme park]]\". He was told that each of the rides he had designed would cost about $10 million to build and the whole film would cost about $70 million. When box office results for Murphy's 1992 comedy ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' came in, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] ordered the budget to be cut to $55 million. Paramount had earlier told Simpson and Bruckheimer that they would only outlay $25 million for a proposed version to be set in New York City, one of the main reasons that the producing team parted ways with the studio. Joel Silver was set to take over producing duties from Simpson and Bruckheimer; however, negotiations on a large budget resulted in production delays leading to Silver quitting production. It was at this time that producers [[Mace Neufeld]] and Robert Rehme took on the project. Consequently, the film became more about the investigation and less about the action.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Costs Force Paramount to Delay Filming 'Beverly Hills Cop III'|work= Los Angeles Times|date=1993-01-06|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-06/business/fi-1003_1_beverly-hills-cop-iii|access-date=2010-09-29|first=Jane|last=Galbraith}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Movies: Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer just say no to Paramount's offer to make a third 'Beverly Hills Cop.'|work= Los Angeles Times|date=1991-09-30|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-30/entertainment/ca-2392_1_cop-iii|access-date=2010-09-29|first=Elaine|last=Dutka}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Judge Reinhold Still Unsigned For 'Beverly Hills Cop III'|work= Chicago Tribune|date=1988-03-16|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-03-16/features/8803010011_1_beverly-hills-cop-iii-filming-judge-reinhold|access-date=2010-09-29|first=Marilyn|last=Beck}}</ref><ref name=\"Orlando Sentinel\"/>\n\nProduction was temporarily shut down to allow the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] top brass the chance to get to grips with the film's spiraling budget.<ref>{{cite news|title= Filming Postponed Again For 'Beverly Hills Cop 3'|work= Orlando Sentinel|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-01-07/news/9301070514_1_filming-hills-cop-studios-florida|access-date=2010-09-29}}</ref> Originally estimated at $55 million, it was soon in excess of $70 million.
