She is still smitten with him, but opposition from her father remains as resolute as ever.  Further, she also has a rich would-be suitor, Alistair Patton (son of the banker from whom Harrison is seeking a large loan), endeavouring to court her.  Before he returns from Harrison's property to his home, Jim meets an army officer seeking quality horses for the remount service on a regular basis.\n\nAs he realizes Jessica's affections remain for Jim, and that she doesn't \"give a damn\" about him, Patton jealously and maliciously recruits a gang to steal Jim's horses. Jim gives chase and in so doing again rides his horse down the steep mountainside. Patton shoots at him; the horse is killed and Jim is injured but manages to recover and resume the pursuit. Jim had earlier let the wild stallion which led the Brumbies loose into the wild again; in a twist of fate, the stallion shows itself from the wild at this crucial moment, and Jim finally trains the horse that has been the enigma of the entire district for decades.  As Jim breaks him in and learns to ride him, they become friends, and together they catch up to Patton and his gang.\n\nJessica's father has also relented during this time, and he eventually joins with Jim and his friends to hunt down Patton and his gang. Jim Craig gets and wins his man-on-man duel with Patton, and Harrison gives his final approval for Jessica and Jim to marry.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Burlinson]] as Jim Craig\n* [[Sigrid Thornton]] as Jessica Harrison\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Harrison\n* [[Nicholas Eadie]] as Alistair Patton\n* [[Mark Hembrow]] as Seb\n* [[Bryan Marshall]] as Hawker\n* [[Rhys McConnochie]] as Patton Snr.\n* [[Peter Cummins]] as Jake\n* [[Cornelia Frances]] as Mrs. Darcy\n* [[Tony Barry]] as Jacko\n* [[Wynn Roberts (actor)|Wynn Roberts]] as Priest\n* Alec Wilson as Patton's Croney\n* [[Peter Browne (actor)|Peter Browne]] as Reilly\n* [[Alan Hopgood]] as Simmons\n* [[Mark Pennell]] as Collins\n\n==Production==\nGeoff Burrowes, who produced the first movie, decided to direct as he felt he would clash with any other director because he felt so strongly about the material.<ref name=\"stratton2\">David Stratton, ''The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry'', Pan MacMillan, 1990 p67</ref>\n\nA horse was injured during the making of the movie and had to be put down.
