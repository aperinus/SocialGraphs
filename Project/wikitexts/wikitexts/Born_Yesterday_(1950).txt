The screenplay was credited to [[Albert Mannheimer]]. According to Kanin's autobiography, Cukor did not like Mannheimer's work, believing it lacked much of the play's value, so he approached Kanin about adapting a screenplay from his own play. Because of legal entanglements, Kanin did not receive screen credit.<ref>Osborne, Robert. Outro to the [[Turner Classic Movies]] presentation of the film (June 1, 2014)</ref><ref>Thomson, David. ''Have You Seen...?'', 2008, London: Allen Lane, p118</ref>\n\nThe film tells the story of an uneducated young woman, Billie Dawn (played by [[Judy Holliday]], in an [[23rd Academy Awards|Oscar-winning performance]]) and an uncouth, older, wealthy junkyard tycoon, Harry Brock ([[Broderick Crawford]]) who comes to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to try to \"buy\" a [[United States Congress|congressman]]. When Billie embarrasses him socially, Harry hires journalist Paul Verrall ([[William Holden]]) to educate her. In the process, Billie learns how corrupt Harry is, and eventually falls in love with Paul.\n\nThe film was produced and released by [[Columbia Pictures]]. Kanin frequently stated that Harry Brock was modeled on Columbia production chief [[Harry Cohn]], with whom Kanin had a long and testy relationship. According to Cohn biographer [[Bob Thomas (reporter)|Bob Thomas]], Cohn knew of Kanin's attribution but didn't care about it.\n\nIn 2012, ''Born Yesterday'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-12-230/nfr-films-showcased-in-january/2012-12-28/|title=2012 National Film Registry Selections Showcased in January|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:JHandWHforBY.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Holden and Judy Holliday in a promotional still for ''Born Yesterday'']]\nBullying, uncouth junkyard tycoon Harry Brock goes to Washington, D.C., with his brassy girlfriend, Emma \"Billie\" Dawn, and his crooked lawyer, Jim Devery, to \"influence\" a politician or two. As a legal precaution, Devery presses Harry to marry Billie, as [[Spousal privilege|a wife cannot be forced to testify against her husband]].\n\nHarry becomes disgusted with Billie's ignorance and lack of manners, though his are much worse. He hires journalist Paul Verrall, who had come to interview him, to educate her and give her some culture. Blossoming under Paul's encouragement and her own hard work, Billie learns about literature, history, politics and the law, and turns out to be much smarter than anyone knew.\n\nBillie starts thinking for herself and applying her learning to her situation. She also falls in love with Paul, who respects and appreciates her. When she stands up to Harry, he reacts violently, striking her and forcing her to sign the contracts related to his crooked deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Devery has persuaded Harry to sign over many of his assets to Billie to hide them from the government. When Harry experiences Billie's new independence, he tries to intimidate her into signing his assets back to him. Billie and Paul use her leverage to escape from Harry's domination. She promises to give him back his property little by little as long as he leaves them alone. A brief final scene reveals that Billie and Paul have married.\n\n{{stack|[[File:White House Sightseeing Tours.jpg|thumb|right|267px|White House Sightseeing bus as pictured in the film.]]}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Judy Holliday]] as Billie Dawn\n* [[Broderick Crawford]] as Harry Brock\n* [[William Holden]] as Paul Verrall\n* [[Howard St. John]] as Jim Devery\n* Frank Otto as Eddie, Harry's servant\n* Larry Oliver as Congressman Norval Hedges\n* [[Barbara Brown (American actress)|Barbara Brown]] as Mrs. Anna Hedges\n* [[Grandon Rhodes]] as Sanborn, hotel manager\n* [[Claire Carleton]] as Helen the maid\n}}\n\n==Pre-production==\nThough all the major Hollywood studios wanted to film Garson Kanin's Broadway play [[Born Yesterday (play)|''Born Yesterday'']], Columbia Studios purchased the rights for $1 million in 1948. However, the project was put on the shelf for months because of casting problems. In April 1950, Columbia head Harry Cohn assigned George Cukor to direct the film, though Cukor was not the studio's first choice.\n\nCukor's preparatory work for ''Born Yesterday'' was quite innovative. The actors rehearsed the screenplay for two weeks, then performed it before an audience drawn from studio employees. Cukor's idea was to give the actors a chance to develop \u201cdimensional characters,\u201d and clock laugh values from audience reaction before the cameras began rolling.  Cukor held that if a scene is funny, there is no need to play about with it. When people complained, \u201cthat laugh overrode the line, I did not hear the next line,\u201d Cukor's answer remained the same, \u201cGo and see the movie again.\u201d But he did make some changes \u2013 when the laughter was long and loud, he added some visual detail.<ref name=\"emanuellevy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://emanuellevy.com/review/sixty-years-ago-born-yesterday-1950-9-2/|title=Born Yesterday (1950): Starring Judy Holliday in her Oscar-Winning Performance - Emanuel Levy|website=emanuellevy.com}}</ref>\n\n==Casting==\nAccording to a [[The Hollywood Reporter|Hollywood Reporter]] news item, Holliday initially refused to reprise her popular Broadway role for the film. In September 1947, [[Rita Hayworth]] was reported to be in line for the role, but in late April 1949, it was reported that [[Gloria Grahame]] was to be borrowed from RKO for the lead, and that [[Jean Arthur]] and [[Lana Turner]] had also been considered for the part. An October 16, 1947 Hollywood Reporter news item stated that Columbia was negotiating with [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]] to reprise his Broadway role.\n\nAccording to modern sources, Kanin convinced Cohn to cast Holliday by  co-writing \u2013 with wife [[Ruth Gordon]] \u2013 a part specifically for her in the 1949 MGM film ''[[Adam's Rib]].'' Holliday's performance in the film garnered her critical acclaim and convinced Cohn of her comedic abilities. Larry Oliver and Frank Otto also reprised their Broadway roles. A September 20, 1950 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' reported that before filming began, the cast perfected their comic timing during six performances in front of live audiences of studio employees.<ref name=\"afi.com\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/27589|title=AFI-Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\n==Censorship==\nAlthough the film was clearly written for a mature audience, Kanin and Cukor were forced to amend the film to appease censors. Cukor explained, \"It seems ludicrous now, but twenty years ago you couldn't have a character say, 'I love that broad,' you couldn't even say 'broad.' And the nonsense that went on to get over the fact that Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford lived together! It required the greatest skill and some new business that Garson invented, like Billie Dawn always creeping into the apartment the back way. We managed to keep it amusing, I think, but it was so unnecessary.\"\n\nHowever, the censors thought the scrutiny was necessary, and Cukor was urged to use caution when filming Holliday's dresses. At that time, it was mandatory for intimate body areas, especially breasts, to be completely covered. The censors also requested that Cukor avoid any suggestion that Billie was trying to get Paul in bed. Billie's line \"Are you one of those talkers, or would you be interested in a little action?\" was deemed offensive. However, Cukor stood his ground, and the line made it into the final cut.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69435/born-yesterday#overview|title=Born Yesterday (1950)|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref>\n\n==Costumes==\nIn the stage production, Holliday's character Billie Dawn wore only five costumes, but in the film, costume designer Jean Louis designed thirteen elaborate creations. Cukor asked Louis to \u201ccharacterize\u201d the clothes, with obviously expensive and ornate clothes at the beginning, when Billie is dumb and self-centered. However, as she acquires culture, her wardrobe becomes simpler and more elegant.<ref name=\"emanuellevy.com\"/>\n\n==Locations==\nTo increase the film's authenticity, Cukor went to Washington, D.C. for locations, and the city  became a dramatic personage in the story. Six named Washington, D.C. locations ([[Jefferson Memorial]], [[Library of Congress]], [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Statler Hotels#List of hotels|Statler Hotel]], [[United States Capitol]] and the [[Watergate complex#Name origins|Watergate Steps]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042276/locations \"Born Yesterday (1950) Filming Locations\"], [[IMDb.com]].

Retrieved 2016-09-01.</ref>) were included in the shoot. Observing tourists at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], Cukor noticed that sightseers would chew gum and give works of art a cursory glance, if any at all. But in Hollywood movies, sightseers invariably were shown standing in rapt attention. Avoiding these cliches, Cukor considered the outdoor scenes among his best efforts.<ref name=\"emanuellevy.com\"/>\n\n==Premiere==\nThe Hollywood premiere of ''Born Yesterday'' was attended by many celebrities and the film was met with enthusiastic applause.
