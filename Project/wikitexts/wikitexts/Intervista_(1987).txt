A nighttime set is prepared for a sequence that Fellini defines as \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s dream\u201d in which his hands grope for a way out of a dark tunnel. With advancing age and weight, Fellini is finding it difficult to escape by simply flying away, but when he does, he contemplates Cinecitt\u00e0 from a great height.\n \nThe next morning, Fellini accompanies the Japanese TV crew on a brief tour of the studios. As they walk past absurd TV commercials in production, Fellini's casting director presents him with four young actors she's found to interpret Karl Rossmann, the leading role in the maestro's film version of [[Franz Kafka|Kafka's]] [[Amerika (Kafka novel)|''Amerika'']]. Fellini introduces the Japanese to the female custodian of Cinecitt\u00e0 (Nadia Ottaviani) but she succeeds in putting off the interview by disappearing into the deserted backlot of Studio 5 to gather dandelions to make herbal tea. Meanwhile, Fellini's assistant director (Maurizio Mein) is on location with other crew members at the Casa del Passeggero, a once cheap hotel now converted into a drugstore. Fellini wants to include it in his film about the first time he visited Cinecitt\u00e0 as a journalist in 1938 during the Fascist era.<ref>Interviewed by [[Alain Finkielkraut]] for the ''Messager europ\u00e9en'', Fellini explained that the \u201cfirst time I visited Cinecitt\u00e0, I was 18 years old, a journalist from Rimini who considered Cinecitt\u00e0 as something legendary.\u201d In Fellini, ''Intervista'', 228.</ref> Past and present intermingle as Fellini interacts with his younger self played by aspiring actor, [[Sergio Rubini]]. After the crew reconstruct the facade of the Casa del Passeggero elsewhere in Rome, a fake tramway takes young Fellini/Rubini from America's Far West with Indian warriors on a clifftop to a herd of wild elephants off the coast of Ethiopia. Arriving at Cinecitt\u00e0, he sets off to interview matinee idol, [[Greta Gonda]].<ref>\"I came to interview an actress named Greta Gonda and it was the first interview I conducted, the first time I went to Cinecitt\u00e0, and the first encounter with an actress I liked very much.\u201d Fellini, ''Intervista'', 228</ref>\n\nSeamlessly, the illusion takes over the realities of moviemaking as the viewer is thrown into two feature films being directed by tyrannical directors. But only for a short while; for the rest of the film, Fellini and his assistant director (Maurizio Mein) scramble to recruit the right cast and build the sets for the film version of ''Amerika'', a fictitious adaptation that Fellini uses as a pretext to shoot his film-in-progress. This allows Fellini/Rubini to go back and forth in time to experience filmmaking first-hand including disgruntled actors who failed their auditions, [[Marcello Mastroianni]] in a TV commercial as [[Mandrake the Magician]], a bomb threat, a visit to [[Anita Ekberg]]\u2019s house where she and Mastroianni re-live their ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' scenes, screen tests of Kafka\u2019s Brunelda caressed in a bathtub by two young men, and an inconvenient thunderstorm that heralds the production collapse of ''Amerika'' with an attack by bogus Indians on horseback wielding television antennae as spears.\n\nBack inside Studio 5 at Cinecitt\u00e0, ''Intervista'' concludes with Fellini\u2019s voiceover, \u201cSo the movie should end here. Actually, it\u2019s finished.\u201d In response to producers unhappy with his gloomy endings, the Maestro ironically offers them a ray of sunshine by lighting an arc lamp.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n* [[Federico Fellini]] as Himself\n* [[Sergio Rubini]] as Young Fellini / Himself\n* [[Antonella Ponziani]] as Train Girl / Herself\n* Maurizio Mein as Himself\n* Paola Liguori as Star\n* [[Lara Wendel]] as Bride\n* [[Antonio Cantafora]] as Spouse\n* Nadia Ottaviani as Vestal Virgin\n* [[Anita Ekberg]] as Herself\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] as Himself\n\n===Supporting===\n* Maria Teresa Battaglia as Recruited Actress at Train Station\n* [[Christian Borromeo]] as Christian\n* Roberta Carlucci as Recruited Actress in the Subway\n* Umberto Conte as Photographer\n* Lionello Pio Di Savoia as Aurelio\n* Germana Dominici as No Nudity Actress \n* Adriana Facchetti as Star's Assistant\n* Ettore Geri as Menicuccio\n* [[Eva Grimaldi]] as Actress at Audition\n* Alessandro Marino as Cinecitt\u00e0 Director #1\n* Armando Marra as Cinecitt\u00e0 Director #2\n* Mario Miyakawa as Japanese Reporter\n* Francesca Reggiani as Secretary\n* Patrizia Sacchi as Make-up Artist\n* Faustone Signoretti as Cinecitt\u00e0 Gate Guard\n* Rolando De Santis as Chiodo\n\n===Cameo/Uncredited===\n* [[Tonino Delli Colli]] as Himself\n* [[Federico Fellini]] as Himself\n* Gino Millozza as Himself\n* Danilo Donati as Himself\n* Delia D'Alberti as Script Girl\n* Stefano Corsi as Assistant Director\n* [[Sophie Hicks]] as Androgenic Actress / Herself\n* Roberto Ceccacci as Production Assistant\n* Piero Vivaldi as Fellini's Driver \n* Clarita Gatto as \"Fellinian\" Woman\n* [[Domiziano Arcangeli]] as Extra\n\n== Structure ==\nBlurring the line between documentary and fiction, ''Intervista'' threads four films into one<ref>Olivier Curchod, \"Intervista: J'\u00e9cris ''Paludes''\" in ''[[Positif (magazine)|Positif]]'', 168</ref> or a film-within-four-films:\n\n:Film 1 is a television news report: Japanese journalists arrive on the set to interview Fellini and his crew preparing sets, [[location scouting]], searching for actors, inspecting photographs, and shooting screen tests. Fellini, [[Anita Ekberg]] and [[Marcello Mastroianni]] appear as themselves.\n\n:Film 2 is filmed autobiography: while interviewed by the Japanese, Fellini evokes memories (real or invented) of his first visit to Cinecitt\u00e0 in 1938 as a young journalist commissioned to interview a female matinee idol.\n\n:Film 3 is the making of a non-existent movie at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]], an adaptation of [[Kafka]]'s ''[[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]''.\n\n:Film 4 is the movie itself: ''Intervista'' subsumes all three films, making them cohere into the Maestro\u2019s portrait of himself and cinema.<ref>In an essay on ''Intervista'', Carlo Testa argues that \u201cautobiography wins out over the transposition of literature into film.\u201d Cf.
