Pippa Sarkissian ([[Blake Lively]]) was the youngest child and only girl in her large Christian family. Her mother Suky ([[Maria Bello]]) was a [[neuroticism|neurotic]] mother with an obsessive fixation on her daughter's looks. \n\nBy her teen years, Pippa discovers that her mother takes amphetamines to [[self-medicate]] vast mood swings. She has a confrontation with her mother by taking drugs, so Pippa moves to her aunt and roommate's, who are in a [[lesbian]] menage. The aunt discovers Pippa participating in erotic photo sessions with the roommate and her friends; Pippa is banished and goes on to live a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life of drugs and work as an [[exotic dancer]].\n\nOn a weekend jaunt with like-minded friends, she meets charismatic [[publisher]] Herb Lee who is 30 years older than her. A [[Romance (love)|romance]] develops between them although he is married to someone else. Before his wife will grant him a divorce, she invites Pippa and Herb to lunch. At the table, she points the gun at Pippa before ending her own life.\n\nPippa and Lee marry, have two children, and once they are gone later move into a retirement home in [[Connecticut]]. Through her marriage, Pippa has become the \"perfect wife.\" loving, supportive, everything to everyone and no-one to herself. The couple grows apart; Herb has an affair with one of Pippa's friends and middle-aged Pippa connects with 35-year-old Chris. \n\nAfter Herb dies from a [[heart attack]], Pippa breaks with her life of subservience and leaves the details of Lee's memorial etc. to their children. The film ends with Pippa driving off with Chris.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Pippa Lee\n* [[Blake Lively]] as Young Pippa\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Herb Lee\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Chris Nadeau\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Suky Sarkissian\n* [[Zoe Kazan]] as Grace Lee\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Sandra Dulles\n* [[Mike Binder]] as Sam Shapiro\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as Gigi Lee\n* [[Ryan McDonald (Canadian actor)|Ryan McDonald]] as Ben Lee\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Kat\n* [[Shirley Knight]] as Dot\n* [[Robin Weigert]] as Trish\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Milford, Connecticut|New Milford]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Newtown, Connecticut|Newtown]], [[Southbury, Connecticut|Southbury]] and Derby, Connecticut.\n\n== Critical response ==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 75 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Reverential and offbeat, the road trip film Private lives of Pippa Lee takes emotional detours and is elevated by great performances, particularly that of Robin Wright-Penn.\"<ref name=\"rt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/private_lives_of_pippa_lee/ |title=The Private Lives of Pippa Lee |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=October 29, 2009 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 49% based on 16 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Private Lives of Pippa Lee |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-private-lives-of-pippa-lee |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>\n\nDavid Gritten of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''  observed: \"Buttressed by a formidable cast . . . Miller navigates her story between sharp satire, dark comedy and wrenching drama. Pippa feels like a character from films of an earlier vintage, including ''[[Diary of a Mad Housewife]]'' and ''[[The Graduate]]''; however she is less of a rebel than \"Housewife's\" protagonist and more non-conformist than Mrs. Robinson. Hints and traces of a playful, late 1960s mood abound. Yet Miller's film is a triumph. Uniformly well acted, it boasts a psychologically knowing script, clearly written by a smart, assertive human being rather than a software programme.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/5787812/The-Private-Lives-of-Pippa-Lee-review.html|title=The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, review|first=David|last=Gritten|date=9 July 2009|access-date=16 November 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[Philip French]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' said, \"The humour is forced, the shocking revelations too sudden and not altogether convincing, but it's enjoyable in an uninvolving way.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/12/private-lives-pippa-lee-review|title=Film review: The Private Lives of Pippa Lee|first=Philip|last=French|date=11 July 2009 |work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=16 November 2017 }}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' rated the film two out of five stars, calling it a \"hugely overegged pudding of a film,\"  \"indulgent,\" \"complacent,\" and \"a film that is very pleased with itself.\"<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/10/private-lives-of-pippa-lee-film-review|title=Film review: The Private Lives of Pippa Lee|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=9 July 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nTrevor Johnston of ''[[Time Out London]]'' rated the film three out of five stars and commented: \"No challenge to surmise where all this is heading, but there are pleasures to be had while it takes the scenic route. With the story structure working backwards and forwards at the same time, the lack of tension is no surprise, nor does Miller help herself by flitting through a variety of moods, from period satire, whimsical imagining and character comedy to more sinewy drama. On a scene-by-scene basis, though, it's classily effective, mainly because of Wright Penn's skill in nailing the precise tenor of every moment. She's a great actress, and a subtle one, too. Anyone who can wrestle scenes away from a lovably grouchy Alan Arkin must be on top of their game.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/87331/the-private-lives-of-pippa-lee.html|title=The Private Lives Of Pippa Lee|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nHannah Forbes Black from [[Channel 4]] rated the film 2\u00bd out of five stars, calling it a \"soft-focus, chocolate-box fairytale.\" She continued: \"The whole thing is vaguely reminiscent of post-war domestic dramas aimed at a daytime audience of housewives \u2013 like a photo-negative of ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' ... Miller's self-adapted script is no more strained and compromised than the average book-to-film adaptation, but one wishes that she'd seized this amazing opportunity to take liberties with her own work ... Toured rapidly around Pippa's life, we can see the outline of the traumas and choices that have shaped her personality, but the film doesn't seem to know what it wants to say about any of it.\"<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?section=review&id=174095 Channel 4 review]</ref>\n\nDarren Amner of ''Eye For Film'' rated it three out of five stars and called the script \"very wry, funny and emotionally charged.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/reviews.php?id=7715|title=The Private Lives Of Pippa Lee (2009) Movie Review from Eye for Film|website=www.eyeforfilm.co.uk|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Brunette]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it \"the kind of film that most critics desperately want to like\" and added:\n<blockquote>Unfortunately, writer-director Rebecca Miller's script tries so hard to be nervous and edgy that it ultimately succeeds only in making its viewers nervous and edgy. It's as though Miller threw a really loud party for all her Hollywood friends, but forgot to invite the audience ... The acting is top-notch (if consistently over-the-top) and the direction is perky (not to say frenzied), but the script is just immensely too much of a good thing. Virtually every character in the film, and virtually everything they say, is so self-consciously quirky that viewers quickly start wincing when they should be laughing or crying ... The film's basic structure is to alternate between Pippa's present-day life as a suburban Mom and her wild youth, but the transitions are often awkward and the polar opposite moods of each part tend to work against rather than reinforce each other. The ultimate intent of the film seems to be to make some honest points about seeking one's own happiness rather than living for the sake of others, but it also wants to be outrageous and outrageously funny at the same time, and the clash of tones is fatal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/film-review-the-private-lives-of-pippa-lee-1003940297.story|title=Hollywood Reporter - Entertainment News|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=16 November 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlissa Simon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted: \"Cardboard characters and severe problems of tone fatally flaw the awkward satirical relationship drama [that] feels as schizophrenic as its eponymous heroine ... While the film marks a change of pace from the intense seriousness of Miller's earlier work, she never finds the dark comic edge that would make ''Pippa'' more satisfying viewing. Indeed, she never sustains any tone at all. The dialogue teeters from flat comedy to wince-worthy whimsy, with detours through blithe and earnest. Visual style, too, is all over the place ... Period music does a better job of evoking the era than the laughable costumes, hair and makeup.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117939628 |title=''Variety'' review|work=Variety |access-date=6 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|1134629}}\n* {{AllMovie title|423015}}\n\n{{Rebecca Miller}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Private Lives Of Pippa Lee, The}}\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:2009 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about drugs]]\n[[Category:Films about runaways]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on romance novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Rebecca Miller]]\n[[Category:Films set in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Plan B Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
