''Arrietty'' received critical acclaim, praising the animation and music. It became the highest grossing Japanese film at the Japanese box office for the year 2010,<ref name=\"mppaj\" /> and grossed over $145 million worldwide.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\" /> The film also won the Animation of the Year award at the 34th [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] award ceremony.<ref name=\"japanacademy\" /> Two English-language versions of the film were produced, a British dub released in the United Kingdom on July 29, 2011 by [[StudioCanal UK|Optimum Releasing]] and an American dub released in North America on February 17, 2012 by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nA boy named Sh\u014d remembers the week in summer he spent at his mother's home with his maternal great aunt, Sadako, and the housemaid, Haru. When Sh\u014d arrives, he gets a glimpse of Arrietty, a Borrower girl, returning to her home through an underground air vent.\n\nAt night, Arrietty's father, Pod, takes her on her first \"borrowing\" mission, to get sugar and tissue paper. After obtaining a sugar cube from the kitchen, they travel to a bedroom which they enter through a dollhouse. It is Sh\u014d's bedroom; he sees Arrietty when she tries to take a tissue from his table. Startled, she drops the sugar cube. Sh\u014d tries to comfort her but Pod and Arrietty leave.\n\nThe next day, Sh\u014d puts the sugar cube and a little note beside the air vent. Pod warns her not to take it because their existence must be kept secret from humans. Nevertheless, she sneaks out to visit Sh\u014d in his bedroom. Without showing herself, she tells him  to leave her family alone but they soon have a conversation, which is interrupted by the crow. The crow attacks Arrietty but Sh\u014d saves her. On her return home, Arrietty is intercepted by her father. Realizing they have been detected, Pod and his wife Homily decide they must move out. Sh\u014d learns from Sadako that some of his ancestors had noticed the presence of Borrowers in the house and had the dollhouse built for them. The Borrowers had not been seen since.\n\nPod returns injured from a borrowing mission and is helped home by Spiller, a Survivalist boy he met. Sh\u014d removes the floorboard concealing the Borrower household and replaces their kitchen with the kitchen from the dollhouse to show he hopes them to stay. However, the Borrowers are frightened by this and speed up their moving process. Pod recovers and Arrietty bids farewell to Sh\u014d. Sh\u014d apologises that he has forced them to move out and reveals he has had a heart condition since birth and will have an operation in a few days. The operation does not have a good chance of success. He is accepting, saying that every living thing dies.\n\nHaru notices the floorboards have been disturbed. She unearths the Borrowers' house and captures Homily. Alerted by her mother's screams, Arrietty goes to investigate. Saddened by her departure, Sh\u014d returns to his room. Haru locks him in and calls a pest control company to capture the other Borrowers alive. Arrietty comes to Sh\u014d for help; they rescue Homily and he destroys all traces of the Borrowers\u2019 presence.\n\nOn their way out during the night, the Borrowers are spotted by the cat Niya. Thereupon Niya leads Sh\u014d to the \"river\", a small rivulet, where the Borrowers are waiting for Spiller to take them further. Sh\u014d gives Arrietty a sugar cube and tells her that she will always be a part of him and that her courage and the Borrowers' fight for survival have made him want to live through the operation. In return, Arrietty gives him her hairclip, a small clothespin, as a token of remembrance. The Borrowers leave in a floating teapot with Spiller in search of a new home.\n\nThe Disney international dubbed version contains a final monologue, where Sh\u014d states that he never saw Arrietty again. He returned to the house a year later, indicating that the operation had been successful. Happily he overhears rumors of objects disappearing in neighboring homes.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Character\n!
