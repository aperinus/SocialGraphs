This film also marks [[Mariah Carey|Mariah Carey's]] acting debut.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=June 2021}}\nA bachelor, after spoiling his proposal to his girlfriend of three years, discovers that his grandfather has died and left him the family business under the conditions that he be married by 6:05&nbsp;p.m. on his 30th birthday (which is the next day), that he not be apart from his bride for more than a week at a time over the next 10 years of their marriage, and that they must attempt to produce a child sometime during the first five years of their marriage, leading the bachelor, his friends, and a priest to scramble over the next few hours in search of a bride.\n\nIf Jimmie fails, business competitor Oden Sports will buy the company. Meanwhile, Anne has second thoughts which she shares with her sister Natalie, talks Anne into going home to go visit their parents for the night.\n\nA desperate Jimmie opens a shoebox full of photos of old girlfriends, and begins to track them down. First he sees Stacey, an [[Commodity futures|oil futures trader]], who turns out to be engaged. Second is Zoe, a window dresser. Jimmie goes to see her, but just after, he runs off after a woman who he thinks is Anne. He returns to find Zoe has set a [[mannequin]] on fire.\n\nHe strikes out with an opera singer and a cop. Soon his list is depleted, but his last choice accepts Buckley, who detests Jimmie but wants his money to prop up her family's fortune. As the priest tries to conduct the ceremony, she gradually learns the other conditions of the will. Horrified, she drives away.\n\nAnne misses Jimmie and heads back to the city. Trying to locate him, she calls Marco to arrange dinner with Jimmie.\n\nAs everyone scrambles to help Jimmie save the family business, Jimmie realizes the \"effect\" of marriage, as the priest reveals how he took on the priesthood after his wife died, and that he was proud to be married and produce a family in the process.\n\nRealizing that he loves Anne and is ready to 'take the plunge', Jimmie, after being up all night, rests in the church where Marco had promised to deliver a bride. He awakens to find hundreds of women dressed as brides waiting for him. After trying to settle the women down, Marco lies and says it was all a prank. Marco reveals that Anne is on her way back, so Jimmie flees to the train station, ordering a cake on the way. He makes it there after escaping the brides. He finds Anne in the train, but she has discovered a newspaper with its front page asking, \"Would you marry this man for $100 million?\" with Jimmie's picture beside. She is upset, but he professes his love for her and they reconcile.\n\nNatalie finds a discarded wedding dress in the station, and Anne puts it on in the bathroom. She opens the door to see hundreds of brides run past, chasing Jimmie. Jimmie flees. He eventually climbs up a flight on a fire escape and shouts for Anne, as the brides gather below. The priest begins to conduct the ceremony over a loudspeaker from inside a police car, causing many 'brides' to attack the car. Anne, in the crowd, makes her way through and up to Jimmie.  Anne convinces the other women to be happy and let it be her day.\n\nThe priest finishes the ceremony by pronouncing them husband and wife, to cheers from all, and Jimmie and Anne kiss. They made it just in time before the deadline of 6:05&nbsp;p.m. to inherit $100 million. She then tosses her bouquet into the teeming crowd below.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chris O'Donnell]] - Jimmie Shannon\n*[[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] - Anne Arden\n*[[Artie Lange]] - Marco\n*[[Mariah Carey]] - Ilana\n*[[Edward Asner]] - Sid Gluckman\n*[[Hal Holbrook]] - Roy O'Dell\n*[[James Cromwell]] - The Priest\n*[[Marley Shelton]] - Natalie Arden\n*[[Peter Ustinov]] - Grandad James Shannon\n*Katharine Towne - Monique\n*Rebecca Cross - Stacey\n*[[Stacy Edwards]] - Zoe\n*[[Sarah Silverman]] - Carolyn\n*[[Jennifer Esposito]] - Daphne\n*[[Brooke Shields]] - Buckley Hale-Windsor\n*[[Anastasia Horne]] - Peppy Boor\n*[[Pat Finn (actor)|Pat Finn]] - Bolt\n\n==Release==\n===Critical reception===\n{{RT data|prose|ref=yes}} {{Metacritic film prose|score=31|count=26|ref=yes|access-date=May 22, 2022}} Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore :: Movie Title Search |website= [[CinemaScore]] |access-date=August 9, 2019 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190809062201/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date=August 9, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nStephen Holden on ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the film \"builds up some of the zip of a silent-film comedy, although its satire is too broad to carry much of a sting.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title='The Bachelor': Hey, Baby, Want to Marry a Guy Worth $100 Million? |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/110599bachelor-film-review.html |access-date=2022-05-14 |website=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at number 3 at the North American box office behind ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' and ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' making $7.5 million [[USD]] in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite news|title= Bone Collector Makes Winning Debut|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/09/entertainment/ca-31463|accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref> ''The Bachelor'' ultimately grossed $37 million worldwide making it a modest box success.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0120596}}\n* {{tcmdb title|331370}}\n* {{Amg movie|181100}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1093976-bachelor|}}\n* {{Mojo title|bachelor}}\n\n{{Gary Sinyor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bachelor, The}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1999 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1999 fantasy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about weddings in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gary Sinyor]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Murphy (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Mexico]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:Sound film remakes of silent films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
