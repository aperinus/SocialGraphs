Uncle Bill's friend, Steven Lo, loans him a vintage automobile for the wedding. That night, a street gang starts a motorcycle race near Uncle Bill's apartment. They are about to run over his friend's car until Keung jumps down and stops them.\n\nHe soon starts a rivalry with the gang after driving them away from Elaine's supermarket, which they tried to rob and vandalize. A series of brawls breaks out in which the bikers try to corner Keung and finish him off. When a member named Angelo gets involved in an illegal diamond deal gone bad and steals the diamonds, the small-time gangsters become the victims of a larger and more effective criminal syndicate led by White Tiger. While running away with the diamonds, Angelo leaves them in a cushion, which is unknowingly used by Keung for the wheelchair of a disabled Chinese American boy named Danny. Danny's elder sister Nancy, a lingerie model/dancer, works in a seedy bar and is an associate/girlfriend of the bikers.\n\nKeung befriends Nancy and advises her to stay away from crime. When the gangsters see this, they chase Keung and Nancy. After failing to confront Keung, the bikers trash Elaine's supermarket, during which two of Angelo's men are captured by White Tiger's men, who turn up at the supermarket in search of Angelo. Angelo's colleagues are unaware of his diamond heist and one is executed in a tree-shredder; his remains given back to the other gangsters as a warning to return the multimillion-dollar goods. In the meantime, Keung and Nancy go to the bikers' headquarters after the latest supermarket attack, and Keung defeats them in another brawl.\n\nKeung agrees to help the biker leader Tony, convinces the street gangsters to reform, and brings the big-time criminals to justice. The syndicate and Keung discover the diamonds in Danny's wheelchair. The handover is botched after Nancy and Tony are held hostage by the syndicate and the diamonds are lost after they use a tow truck to destroy Elaine's supermarket.\n\nWhite Tiger's men hijack a hovercraft and are pursued by Keung and the [[New York Police Department]] in the [[Hudson River]]. The hovercraft ends up running through the streets, causing much damage to property. Keung ends the chase by stealing a large sword from a museum, clamping it onto a sports car window and driving into the [[hovercraft]], shredding the rubber skirt and crashing the vehicle. After shooting one of the syndicate men non-fatally to force them to reveal White Tiger's location, Keung drives the repaired hovercraft to a golf course where White Tiger is playing with subordinates. He runs them over, leaving White Tiger naked on the ground.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Ma Hon Keung (T: \u99ac\u6f22\u5f37, S: \u9a6c\u6c49\u5f3a, P: ''M\u01ce H\u00e0nqi\u00e1ng'')\n* [[Anita Mui]] as Elaine\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Yip]] as Nancy\n* [[Bill Tung]] as Uncle Bill Ma (T: \u99ac \u9a43, S: \u9a6c \u9aa0, J: maa5 piu3, P: ''M\u01ce Pi\u00e0o'')\n* [[Marc Akerstream]] as Tony, leader of the gang\n* [[Garvin Cross]] as Angelo\n* Morgan Lam as Danny\n* Kris Lord as White Tiger, the syndicate boss\n* Carrie Cain Sparks as Whitney Ma\n* [[Elliot Ngok]] (Yueh Hua) as Walter Wah, the Realtor (T: \u83ef, S: \u534e) (''credited as Elly Leung'')\n* [[Eddy Ko]] as Prospective market buyer\n* [[Wakin Chau|Emil Chau]] as Ice cream salesman\n* [[Alex To]] as Ice cream customer\n* Jordan Lennox as Jordan, a syndicate member with glasses\n* John Sampson as a syndicate member\n* Richard Faraci as a syndicate member with a ponytail who Keung subdues in Danny's apartment\n* Gabriel Ostevic as Gabriel, a syndicate member with a mustache who Keung knocks in the water in the boathouse\n* Terry Howsen as a syndicate member in a black suit\n* Mark Fielding as a syndicate member run over by the hovercraft at the golf course\n* Owen Walstrom as a syndicate member flying into a tree at the golf course\n* Allen Sit as one of Tony's gang members with a mustache and ponytail, who speaks Cantonese in the supermarket and is the first one who Keung physically confronts\n* [[Alf Humphreys]] as a Police Officer\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rumble in the Bronx bad landing.jpg|thumb|Jackie Chan's right foot lands at a bad angle after jumping onto the hoverboat, causing a serious injury that would not heal for the remainder of filming. The shot still made it into the finished movie.]]\n\nIn  his autobiography, ''I am Jackie Chan: My life in Action'', Jackie Chan talked about the initial difficulty of filming a movie in Vancouver that is set in New York. The production team initially had to put up fake graffiti during the day and take it all down during the evening, while simultaneously making sure that no mountains made it into the background. However, Chan decided that it was best that the production team focus on the action only without worrying too much about scenery. In his review, Roger Ebert notes that there are mountains in the background, which are not present in the NYC landscape.<ref>{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rumble-in-the-bronx-1996 |title=Rumble in the Bronx |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |via=[[RogerEbert.com]] |date=February 23, 1996}}</ref> There is also an NYC helicopter which displays a Canadian civil registration (C-GZPM - A [[Bell Textron|Bell]] [[Bell 206|JetRanger]]).\n\nThe original spoken dialogue consisted of all of the actors speaking their native language most of the time. In the completely undubbed soundtrack, available on the Warner Japanese R2 DVD release, Jackie Chan actually speaks his native Cantonese while Fran\u00e7oise Yip and Morgan Lam (the actors playing Nancy and Danny) speak English. All of the original dialogue was intended to be dubbed over in the international and Hong Kong film markets, and New Line cinema overdubbed and slightly changed the original English dialogue.\n\nDuring filming, Chan broke his right ankle while performing a stunt. He spent much of the remaining shooting time with one foot in a cast. When it came to the film's climax, the crew colored a sock to resemble the shoe on his good foot, which Chan wore over his cast. His foot still had not completely healed when he went on to shoot his next film, ''[[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]]'' (filmed the same year, 1994, but released earlier in the U.S.).<ref name=\"I Am Jackie Chan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/iamjackiechan/excerpt_aches.html |title=Jackie's Aches and Pains: It Only Hurts When I'm Not Laughing |author=Jackie Chan |author-link=Jackie Chan |publisher=[[Random House]] |access-date=2012-12-19}}</ref>\n\nThe lead actress and several stunt doubles were also injured during the shooting of a motorcycle stunt, with several people suffering broken limbs and ankles.\n\nThe film had a production budget of {{US$|7.5-13 million|link=yes}}.<ref name=\"numbers\"/><ref name=\"Gazette\"/>\n\n==Release==\nNew Line Cinema acquired the film for international distribution and commissioned a new music score and English dub (with participation from [[Jackie Chan]]). A scene of Keung's airplane flying into [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] was added to the opening credits. Three scenes were added exclusively for the international version: a shot of the syndicate's car pulling up to the diamond deal, Keung and Nancy escaping from the nightclub after the bikers spot them together, and White Tiger taking a golf shot before a subordinate approaches him with his phone. None of these scenes were in the original Hong Kong release. In comparison to the Hong Kong version, 17 minutes of cuts were made, and the new English dub changed some of the context of the characters' conversations. Keung being a cop and having a girlfriend in Hong Kong is never mentioned. Keung's father being shot by a robber years ago is also not mentioned. In the New Line Cinema edit, Elaine buys the grocery store upon her first meeting with Uncle Bill, but in the Hong Kong version, she decides to buy the market at Bill's wedding.\n\nThe new soundtrack replaced Chan's song over the [[closing credits]] with the song \"[[Kung Fu (song)|Kung Fu]]\" by the band [[Ash (band)|Ash]], the lyrics of which mention Jackie Chan, as well as other Asian figures and characters ubiquitous in the west.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+ [[Box office]] performance\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Box office territory|Market]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! colspan=\"2\" | Gross revenue ({{estimation}})\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[List of films by box office admissions|Ticket sales]]<br />({{estimation}})\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Abbr|Ref|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Local currency\n!

However, other versions exist, which are closer to the original theatrical release.\n\n===Warner===\n* A DVD was produced by Warner Brothers HK for Hong Kong and South Korea. This contains the New Line Cinema version with additional abridged Cantonese and Mandarin soundtracks. It has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, but includes no English subtitles.\n* Warner Home Video also released a DVD in Japan of the Hong Kong version. This version contains the Hong Kong cut of the film. The dialogue is completely undubbed in a mono 2.0. However, its aspect ratio is cropped to 1.85:1 and contains no English subtitles.\n* In Hong Kong, a [[VCD]] containing the Hong Kong version in Cantonese, with newly generated English and Chinese subtitles was also released. It's 2.35:1.\n* A [[Blu-ray]] was released in the [[United States]] on 6 October 2015.\n\n===Thakral/Chinastar===\nIt appears that a joint-distribution deal was made, with Thakral releasing the film in China, and Chinastar releasing it in Hong Kong. This version contains no credits, not even the film title,  but is otherwise the Hong Kong version. There are no English subtitles and the ratio is roughly 2.10:1.\n\n===Speedy===\n[[Malaysia]]n distributor Speedy released a VCD. As well as local censorship (for profanity - also featuring a substituted shots of Angelo insulting Keung), it has a slightly different Cantonese/English soundtrack (some characters are dubbed in Cantonese); there are English, Chinese and Malay subtitles languages. It is cropped to approximately 1:85:1 and distorted to 1:56:1.\n\n===Funny===\nThe film had three separate DVD releases by [[Taiwan]]ese distributor Funny. Two of these DVDs feature the Taiwanese Mandarin-dubbed version with embedded subtitles. One of these contains a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack only, whilst the other contains both Dolby and DTS soundtracks. The third release is a double-sided disc, featuring the Taiwanese Mandarin dub on one side and the English-dubbed New Line Cinema version on the other. Despite containing a dubbed soundtrack, these DVDs are the only releases to contain English subtitles for a Chinese version. All three are presented in 2.35:1.\n\n===''4 Film Favorites''===\n* Another DVD was released as part of the ''4 Film Favorites: Martial Arts collection''. The film is exactly like the [[New Line Cinema]] but put on the other side of the disc. The film is also attached to ''[[The Corruptor]]'', ''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]'', and ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hong Kong|Film|1990s}}\n* [[Jackie Chan filmography]]\n* [[List of Hong Kong films]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0113326|title=Rumble in the Bronx}}\n* {{AllMovie title|134905|Rumble in the Bronx}}\n\n{{Stanley Tong|state=expanded}}\n{{Best Action Choreography HKFA}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rumble In The Bronx}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1990s action films]]\n[[Category:1990s martial arts films]]\n[[Category:English-language Hong Kong films]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Bronx]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Golden Harvest films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong martial arts films]]\n[[Category:Kung fu films]]\n[[Category:Martial arts comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stanley Tong]]\n[[Category:Films scored by J.
