Adapted by Seaton from [[Clifford Odets]]' 1950 play [[The Country Girl (1950 play)|of the same name]], the film is about an [[alcoholic]] has-been actor/singer struggling with the one last chance he has been given to resurrect his career. Seaton won the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay]]. It was entered in the [[1955 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3717/year/1955.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Country Girl|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]] |access-date=2009-01-31|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\nKelly won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her role, which previously had earned [[Uta Hagen]] her first [[Tony Award]] in the play's original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production.  The role, a non-glamorous departure for Kelly, was as the alcoholic actor's long-suffering wife.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a theatre, auditions are being held for a new musical production titled ''The Land Around Us''. Director Bernie Dodd watches a number performed by fading star Frank Elgin and suggests that he be cast in the leading role. This is met with strong opposition from Philip Cook, the show's producer.\n\nHowever, Bernie insists on the down-on-his-luck Frank, who is living in a modest apartment with his wife Georgie. They are grateful for the opportunity, though not entirely certain Frank can handle the work.\n\nInitially Frank leads Bernie to believe that Georgie is the reason for the decline in his career. Bernie strongly criticizes her, first behind her back and eventually to her face. What he does not know is that the real reason why Frank's career has ended is his insecurity. When their five-year-old son Johnny was hit by a car and died while in Frank's care, he was devastated. Partly using that as an excuse to cover up his insecurity, Frank has been reduced to a suicidal alcoholic.\n\nMealy-mouthed to the director's face, Frank is actually a demanding alcoholic who is completely dependent on his wife. Bernie mistakenly blames her for everything that happens during rehearsals, including Elgin's requests for a dresser and a run-of-the-show contract. He believes Georgie to be suicidal and a drunk, when it is actually Frank who is both.\n\nHumiliated when he learns the truth, Bernie realizes that behind his hatred of Georgie was a strong attraction to her. His anger melts away and he kisses her. She tells him that it does not mean that anything has changed.\n\nElgin's performance is a success on opening night. Afterward, he demands respect from Cook, which he and his wife had not been given before the opening. Previously Georgie had said that if only Frank could stand on his own two feet, she could get away from him. At a party to celebrate the play's opening, Bernie believes Georgie will be free to leave Frank, and tells her that he loves her. Later Frank tells them he has noticed their longing looks, and all three talk. Shortly after, Frank leaves the party. Georgie says goodbye to Bernie, and he tells her he appreciates a woman who is loyal. She kisses him lightly and goes to catch up with Frank.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bing Crosby]] as Frank Elgin\n* [[Grace Kelly]] as Georgie Elgin\n* [[William Holden]] as Bernie Dodd\n* [[Anthony Ross]] as Philip Cook\n* [[Gene Reynolds]] as Larry\n* Jacqueline Fontaine as lounge singer\n* [[Eddie Ryder]] as Ed\n* [[Robert Kent (actor)|Robert Kent]] as Paul Unger\n* John W.
