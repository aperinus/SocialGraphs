The story revolves around the quest of two [[robot]]s (the band members, played by Peter Hurteau and Michael Reich) to become human.\n\nThe music featured in the film is not by Daft Punk, which is a first for the duo after their previous film and [[home video]] releases, ''[[D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes]]'' and ''[[Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem]]''. The duo instead served as directors and co-wrote the film, along with Daft Arts manager Paul Hahn and collaborator C\u00e9dric Hervet.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]], and was later released in France on March 24, 2007. While initially receiving mixed reviews, ''Electroma'' has gained a cult following.<ref name=\"filmmakermagazine1\">{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/archives/issues/summer2008/daftpunk.php |title=Daft Punk's Electroma \u2013 Filmmaker Magazine \u2013 Summer 2008 |publisher=Filmmaker Magazine |access-date=2015-12-17}}</ref>\n\nDaft Punk used scenes from the end of the film to announce their break-up on February 22, 2021.<ref name=\"ytEpilogue\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe two lead characters appear as the robotic forms of [[Daft Punk]] and are credited as \"Hero Robot No. 1\" and \"Hero Robot No. 2\". One wears a silver helmet and the other wears a golden one. An opening scene shows the duo driving in a 1987 [[Ferrari 412]] with its license plate displaying \"HUMAN\". After passing through a [[Southwestern United States]] landscape, the duo arrives by car at a town in [[Inyo County, California]].<ref name=\"ElectromaReview\" /> The town's residents are also shown to be robots physically identical to the two main characters, but at different ages, with different clothing and alternating gender.\n\nThe pair drive to a high-tech facility where liquid [[Latex (rubber)|latex]] is poured over their heads. The latex is shaped into human-like faces with the aid of [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] appliances and wigs. The resulting look caricaturizes the members of Daft Punk, [[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]]. When the two leave the facility, the locals of the town are shocked by their human appearance. The townsfolk gradually begin to chase the duo, whose faces eventually melt in the sun. The two take cover in a public restroom where the gold robot discards his ruined mask, then encourages the reluctant silver robot to do the same. Again appearing as robots, the pair then undergo a lengthy hike across desert [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]]s.\n\nAfter walking for an extended period, the silver robot slows down and comes to a stop. Becoming aware of this, the gold robot walks back to the silver one. The silver robot continues to stare at the ground for a moment before removing his own jacket. He then turns away from the other robot, revealing a switch on his back. The gold robot flips the switch, which begins a timer. When the countdown ends, the silver robot is blown to pieces. The remaining robot piles the remains of the silver robot, then continues to walk. The gold robot eventually falls to his knees and attempts to reach the switch on his own back, but to no avail. Another moment passes before the robot removes his helmet and repeatedly slams it into the ground until the helmet shatters. Using one of the shards as a [[burning-glass]], the robot focuses the sunlight to set his hand ablaze. The film ends as the robot, completely on fire, walks in [[slow motion]] through darkness.\n\n==Cast==\n* Peter Hurteau as Hero Robot #1 \n* Michael Reich as Hero Robot #2 \n* Ritche Lago Bautista as Robot Groomsman \n* Daniel Doble as Robot Pastor \n* Athena Stamos as Robot Waitress\n* Bradley Schneider as Robot Lawyer\n\n==Production==\n[[Daft Punk]]'s previous directorial credits include the [[music video]]s for their songs \"[[Da Funk#\"Fresh\" video|Fresh]]\", \"[[Robot Rock (song)|Robot Rock]]\" and \"[[Technologic]]\".
