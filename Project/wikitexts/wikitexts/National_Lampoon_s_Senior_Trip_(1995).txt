It marked [[Jeremy Renner|Jeremy Renner's]] film debut.\n\n==Plot==\nAt [[Fairmont High School (Ohio)|Fairmount High School]], [[Ohio]] in the suburbs of [[Dayton]], a group of teenage students begin their school with an assembly featuring a band called \"High on Life\", though they are selfish at teachers and the principal. As the band continues to play onstage, Mark \"Dags\" D'Agastino and Reggie Barry decide to sabotage the assembly by exposing the band is lip syncing their music and playing the song recordings at inappropriate times. After a typing class (during which the teacher suffers a heart attack and dies), the seniors cut school and throw a party for Principal Moss. Moss eventually gets informed about the party from the student body president Steve Nisser. When he returns home, he gives the group detention, forcing them to write a letter to the [[President of the United States]], explaining what is wrong with the education system.\n\nThe next day while arriving at school, Moss and the new typing class teacher notices that various newspaper station vans are there assuming that something has gone wrong within the building. Mrs. Winston tells him that Jason Lerman is inside the building after meeting the seniors. Moss makes the announcement over them being invited by the President, who amazingly enjoyed their letter, to [[Washington, D.C.]] to discuss it. However, it is actually just a plot devised by the corrupt [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] to humiliate the President. The bus arrives at a convenience store, where Dags and Reggie lock Moss in a flooded washroom, and they steal alcoholic beverages. They are pursued by Travis, a crazed ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan and crossing guard, who hitches a ride with an [[Asian people|Asian]] family. While on their way, Moss falls into a \"[[coma]]\" after taking pills given to him by bus driver Red. At this point, the students go on a rampage celebrating over Moss passing out and throw another party, while Carla Morgan, the school [[slut]], puts [[Cosmetics|makeup]] on Moss.\n\nThe next day, the bus is pursued by Travis and the police. Red apparently dies from a [[drug overdose]], and the bus nearly plows into a lake. Dags manages to stop it in time, but the car lands on the water and Travis escapes. Arriving at Washington, the group checks into a hotel and decides to take a class photo at a [[cemetery]]. Miosky uses [[fart lighting]] on [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s flame to distract Travis. That night, the seniors secretly lace a box of [[chocolate]]s with [[tequila]] and give it to Miss Milford. When Milford seduces Moss, the students begin to leave to go to a party at the hotel next door, but Steve Nisser threatens to blow the whistle. Dags orders Mioski to take care of him. At the hotel, while the other students enjoy the party, Lisa Perkins takes Dags to the rooftop where she seduces him. The next day, she suddenly discovers the plot to use the students and embarrass the President.\n\nAt the same time, Senator Lerman unexpectedly wakes up Moss and Milford, who\u2014shocked at finding themselves in the same room\u2014prepare themselves and the seniors for their meeting with the President. However, when they open the room, they do not find them there but only a tied-up Steve Nisser. Moss and Milford find the missing students, as they are informed of Lerman's plot as Lerman baffles to the discovery. The senator subsequently kidnaps Miosky and takes him to the [[White House]] with the others in hot pursuit. When they arrive at the White House, the senator insults the seniors, but Moss unexpectedly stands up for them. The senator's plot is ultimately exposed and the seniors return home. The film ends with a montage of the characters and where they ended up after the events.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Mark \"Dags\" D'Agostino\n* Eric \"Sparky\" Edwards as Miosky\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Principal Todd Moss \n* [[Tommy Chong]] as Red\n* [[Valerie Mahaffey]] as Miss Tracy Milford\n* Rob Moore as Reggie Barry\n* [[Lawrence Dane]] as Senator John Lerman \n* [[Kevin McDonald]] as Travis Lindsey\n* Michael Blake as Herbert Jones\n* [[Tara Strong]] as Carla Morgan (credited as Tara Charendoff)\n* [[Nicole de Boer]] as Meg Smith\n* [[Sergio Di Zio]] as Steve Nisser\n* [[Fiona Loewi]] as Lisa Perkins\n* Kathryn Rose as Wanda Baker\n* [[Danny Smith (actor, musician)|Danny Smith]] as Barry \"Virus\" Kemmer\n* [[Kay Tremblay]] as Mrs. Winston\n* [[Wayne Robson]] as Frank Hardin\n* [[George R.
