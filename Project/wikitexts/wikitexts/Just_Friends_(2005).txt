The plot focuses on a formerly obese high school student (Reynolds) who attempts to free himself from the [[friend zone]] after reconnecting with his best friend (Smart) whom he is in love with while visiting his hometown for Christmas.\n\nThe film revolves around humorous observation of strictly [[Platonic love|platonic relationship]]s as \"just friends\" or \"just as [[wikt:best friend|best friend]]s\". It was shot in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] and [[Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatchewan]].<ref name=GFL>{{cite web|url=https://globalfilmlocations.net/2017/01/30/just-friends-2005-film-locations/ |title=Just Friends (2005) Film Locations |publisher=Global Film Locations|date=January 30, 2017 |access-date=July 2, 2020}}</ref> ''Just Friends'' was released on November 23, 2005 and grossed over $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1995, Chris Brander, an [[Obesity|obese]] high school senior, is secretly in love with his classmate and best friend Jamie Palamino. Confessing his feelings by writing in her [[yearbook]], he attends their graduation party. As he returns Jamie's yearbook, it is swapped by her ex-boyfriend, Tim, who reads the declaration aloud to everyone, humiliating Chris. After kissing him on the cheek, Jamie admits she does not reciprocate his affections. He leaves the party in tears, announcing he will never return and vowing to be more successful than everyone else.\n\nTen years later, a womanizing Chris has lost weight and lives in [[Los Angeles]] as a highly successful record producer and vice president of the company. Before Christmas, company CEO KC, asks him to accompany emerging, self-obsessed pop singer Samantha James to Paris so she signs with their label, and Chris reluctantly complies. She wants a relationship with him but he has no interest after their only date previously led to his hospitalization. On the way to Paris, Samantha accidentally sets her private jet on fire, causing an emergency landing in New Jersey, near Chris's hometown.\n\nChris takes Samantha to his mother's for the night and re-engages with his teenage past, including his unresolved feelings for Jamie. She meets his mother and 18-year-old brother Mike, a huge fan of Samantha who is infatuated with her. At the local bar, Chris encounters some old classmates, including his other best friend Clark and his wife Darla.\n\nHe also sees Jamie, working as a bartender to pay for graduate school for teaching. Chris asks Mike to keep Samantha busy during his date with Jamie, but realizing their platonic friendship is important to him hampers his plan for them to have sex. During a friendly ice skating \"day date\", Chris is taken away in an ambulance after injuring himself during a hockey game with Jamie and a trio of kids (who dislike him). At the scene, Jamie is reunited with Dusty Dinkleman, a paramedic and former high school classmate also in love with her.\n\nThe next night, Chris goes to Jamie's Christmas party to express his feelings for her, but Dusty is already there, charming everyone on guitar. Back at Chris's, Samantha ambushes Mike, demanding he reveal Chris's location. He refuses until she gives him a kiss. In a rage, she drives to Jamie's, crashing through her fence and destroying the Christmas decorations. Chris returns home in embarrassment, and Jamie follows. She tells him she is not mad and they end up spending the night catching up and reminiscing. However, due to Chris's continuing lack of assertion, they end up just sleeping and nothing happens.\n\nThe next day, Jamie speaks with Darla about the night before, while Chris goes to Clark for advice. Jamie admits that while they are \"just friends\", she tried to show Chris she is interested in more. Clark tells Chris that \"the timing wasn't right\" and their history hinders him. Outside the office, Chris and Clark catch Dusty singing to a nurse and then kissing her. Dusty reveals his plans to have sex with Jamie and humiliate her in a way he felt she humiliated him in high school when he was attracted to her.\n\nChris tries to warn Jamie, but instead attacks Dusty in front of her. She refuses to listen when he tries to explain. Consequently, he gets drunk and goes to Jamie's bar, finding her there with Dusty. When she gently declines Dusty's sexual advances, he storms out. Chris and Jamie get into another fight, where he blames her for keeping him in the \"[[friend zone]]\" and says she will never amount to anything. Jamie punches Chris and he is tossed out.\n\nUpon returning to Los Angeles and rejecting Samantha's continued advances when she sees him again, Chris realizes that Jamie is his one and only true love. He returns to New Jersey, declares his love to her and they kiss, while the three kids (from the hockey game earlier) watch in disgust. One of the boys hands the girl a cookie, which she gives to the other. She calls the boy who gave her a cookie her friend, which he replies with \"the bestest\" before realizing he has been put in the friend zone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Chris Brander\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Jamie Palamino\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Samantha James\n* [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as Dusty \"Dusty Lee\" Dinkleman\n* [[Chris Marquette|Christopher Marquette]] as Mike Brander\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Carol Brander\n* [[Stephen Root]] as KC\n* [[Fred Ewanuick]] as Clark\n* [[Amy Matysio]] as Darla\n* Barry Flatman as Mr. Palamino\n* Maria Arc\u00e9 as Athena\n* [[Ty Olsson]] as Tim\n* Todd Lewis as Kyle\n* [[Ashley Scott]] as Janice\n* [[Trenna Keating]] as Nancy\n* JJ Elliott as Movie Goer\n* Tina Cerato as Movie Goer\n* Amanda Park as Dental Assistant\n{{div col end}}\n[[Alanis Morissette]], then Reynolds' fianc\u00e9e, made a [[cameo appearance]] as \"herself\" as a former client of his character.
