The film follows a few Amish teenagers in [[Lagrange County|LaGrange County, Indiana]] who enter the \"English\" (non-Amish) world and experience partying, drinking, illegal drugs, and pre-marital sex.  Some teens in the film profess that they will eventually become [[Believers baptism|baptized as adults]] in the Amish community. If they are baptized, then leave the church, they will be [[shunning|shunned]] by family and friends; one girl recounts her experience of this.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nAccording to ''Devil's Playground'', at the age of 16, Amish youth are allowed to depart from many of the Amish rules.<!-- See Talk about editor-added observations.--> The young people sample life outside of the Amish community. Many drive cars, wear modern clothes and cut and style their hair in more fashionable styles, get jobs, have romantic and sexual relationships, and some experiment with drugs.\n\nOne Amish youth whom the film follows, Faron\u2014a [[preacher's kid|preacher's son]]\u2014turns to drug dealing to satisfy his habit. Faron is eventually apprehended by the authorities; he aids them in arresting another dealer. Each of the film's subjects faces a variety of challenges and pressures from both the \"English World\" and the \"Amish World\" of their families. Some make the commitment to return to their communities, others do not. One girl is baptized but later leaves the Amish church, resulting in her family [[shunning]] her.\n\nAccording to the documentary, \"over 90%\" of Amish youth decide to join the church, returning to their communities and families.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = [[Lucy Walker (director)]]|date=2002 | title=Devil's Playground |publisher= Stick Figure Productions | time=1:13:24 |quote= Intertitle: Currently almost 90% of Amish young people will join the Amish church.
