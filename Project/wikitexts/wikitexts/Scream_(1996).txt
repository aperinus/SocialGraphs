The film stars [[Neve Campbell]], [[David Arquette]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Skeet Ulrich]], [[Jamie Kennedy]], and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Released on December 20, it follows high school student [[Sidney Prescott]] (Campbell) and her group of friends in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, who become the targets of a mysterious killer in a Halloween costume known as [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]]. The film [[satire (film and television)|satirizes]] the [[clich\u00e9]]s of the slasher genre popularized in films such as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980) and Craven's own ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984). ''Scream'' was considered unique at the time of its release for featuring characters aware of real-world horror films who openly discussed the clich\u00e9s that the film attempted to subvert.\n\nInspired by the real-life case of the [[Danny Rolling|Gainesville Ripper]], ''Scream'' was influenced by Williamson's passion for horror films, especially ''Halloween'' (1978). The screenplay, originally titled ''Scary Movie'', was bought by [[Dimension Films]] and was retitled by the Weinstein brothers just before filming was complete. The production faced censorship issues with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and obstacles from locals while filming on location. The film received positive reviews and was a financial success, earning $173&nbsp;million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing slasher film until the release of ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018). It still remains the highest-grossing slasher film in adjusted dollars. It received several awards and award nominations. The soundtrack by [[Marco Beltrami]] was also acclaimed, and was cited as \"[one] of the most intriguing horror scores composed in years\".<ref name=\"musicfromthemovies\" /> The score has since earned \"[[Cult following|cult status]]\".<ref name=\"scream1score\" /> ''Scream'' marked a change in the genre as it cast already-established and successful actors, which was considered to have helped it find a wider audience, including a significant female viewership.\n\n''Scream'' was credited with revitalizing the slasher genre in the 1990s, which was considered to be almost dead following an influx of [[direct-to-video]] titles and numerous sequels to established horror franchises of the 1970s and 1980s. ''Scream''{{'}}s success spawned [[Scream (franchise)|a series of sequels]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->\nHigh school student [[Casey Becker]] is home alone when she receives a phone call from an unknown person, during which they discuss horror films. The caller turns sadistic, refusing to leave Casey alone and threatening her life. He reveals that her boyfriend Steve is bound and gagged outside on her patio and demands she answer questions about horror films if she wants him to live. After Casey answers a question about ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' incorrectly, Steve is murdered in front of her. Casey attempts to escape, but is cornered by [[Ghostface (identity)|someone wearing a \"Ghostface\" costume]], who kills her before her parents arrive home to find her disemboweled corpse hanging from a tree.\n\nNews media descend on the town in the wake of the murders and a police investigation begins. Teenager [[Sidney Prescott]] struggles with the first anniversary of her mother Maureen's rape and murder, while a news reporter, [[Gale Weathers]], who Sidney vehemently despises, arrives among the media. Gale was responsible for spreading rumors and conspiracy theories about Maureen's death, insinuating that the imprisoned Cotton Weary, who was tried and convicted of Maureen's rape and murder, was not responsible for her assault and killing. That night, while waiting at home for her best friend Tatum Riley to arrive, Sidney gets a taunting phone call and is attacked by Ghostface. Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis arrives immediately after. When he drops his cell phone, Sidney suspects him of making the call and flees. Billy is arrested and questioned, but later, at Tatum's house, Sidney receives another ominous call.\n\nThe next day, Billy is released and suspicion shifts to Sidney's father Neil Prescott, due to the ominous phone calls having been traced to his phone. After school is suspended in wake of the murders, Ghostface ambushes Principal Arthur Himbry and stabs him to death. Tatum's boyfriend and Billy's best friend, Stu Macher, throws a party to celebrate the school's closure. Gale attends uninvited, as she expects the killer to strike again. Tatum's older brother, Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley, also looks out for the murderer at the party. Tatum goes out to the garage and is cornered by Ghostface, who crushes her neck with the garage door when she attempts to escape through the pet door. Many party attendees are drawn away after hearing of Himbry's death, leaving only Sidney, Billy, their friend Randy Meeks, Stu, and Gale's cameraman Kenny.\n\nAfter having sex, Sidney and Billy are confronted by Ghostface, who stabs Billy. Sidney escapes from the house and seeks help from Kenny, but he is killed by Ghostface. Gale crashes her van while escaping and Dewey is stabbed in the back while investigating in the house, with Sidney taking his gun for protection. Randy and Stu show up and accuse each other of being the killer, but Sidney retreats back into the house where she finds a wounded Billy. After they let Randy inside, Sidney gives Billy the gun, who in turn shoots Randy, revealing himself to be the killer; Stu is revealed to be his accomplice by talking into a voice changer. \n\nBilly and Stu corner Sidney in the kitchen and discuss their plan to kill her and pin the murder spree on her father, whom they have taken hostage. They also reveal that they murdered her mother and framed Cotton for it, as she was having an affair with Billy's father, which drove his mother away. Gale intervenes, enabling Sidney to escape and turn the tables on the killers, taunting them with a phone call and donning the Ghostface costume, before knocking Billy out and killing Stu by dropping a television set on his head. An enraged Billy awakens and attacks Sidney, but Gale shoots him. Randy, wounded but alive,  remarks that the killer always resurfaces for one last scare. As Billy rises, Sidney shoots Billy in the head, finally killing him. As police arrive, Dewey, badly injured, is taken away by ambulance as Gale makes an impromptu news report about the night's events.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{further|topic=individual characters|List of Scream (film series) characters}}\n{{further|topic=cast members|List of Scream (film series) cast members}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as [[Sidney Prescott]]\n* [[David Arquette]] as Dewey Riley\n* [[Courteney Cox]] as [[Gale Weathers]]\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Stu Macher\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Tatum Riley\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as Billy Loomis\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as Randy Meeks\n* [[W.

He hoped to entice buyers with the potential for a franchise.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /><ref name=\"fangoria169\" /> In an interview, Williamson said that one reason he focused on the ''Scary Movie'' script was because it was a film he wanted to watch, born of his childhood love of horror films such as ''Halloween'', but \"nobody else [was] making it\".<ref name=\"fangoria168\" /> His appreciation for previous horror films became evident in the script, which was inspired by and references films such as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' (1979), ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980), and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984).<ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> Williamson listened to the [[Halloween (soundtrack)|soundtrack of ''Halloween'']] for inspiration while writing the script. Excerpts from the soundtrack appear in the film.<ref name=\"fangoria160\" />\n\nBy June 1995<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> Williamson brought the ''Scary Movie'' script to his agent, Rob Paris, to put out for sale. Paris warned him that the level of violence and gore in his script would make it \"impossible\" to sell.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Following the script's purchase by [[Miramax]], Williamson was required to remove much of the gorier content, such as graphic depictions of the internal organs of gutted murder victims \"rolling\" down their legs. However, once Craven was secured as director, he was able to bring much of the excised content back.<ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> Williamson was going to remove a scene in the school bathroom featuring Sidney, as he felt it was awkward and out of place in the film. Craven insisted the scene should remain, as he felt it developed the character and her relationship with her deceased mother. Williamson later confirmed that he was glad that Craven proved him wrong about the scene.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\n[[Dimension Films]] head [[Bob Weinstein]] realized while reviewing the script that there were thirty pages (approximately thirty on-screen minutes) without a murder, so he instructed Williamson to have another character killed.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Williamson included the death of the character Principal Himbry (Winkler) based on this input and in doing so inadvertently resolved a problem in the script's finale. Williamson had struggled to find a reason for several extraneous characters to leave a party scene so that the killer could attack, finally determining that the announcement of the discovery of Himbry's corpse would serve to remove the non-essential characters, who decide to take a look at the corpse and leave the party before (and enabling) the start of the murders.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Concerning the killers' motives, Williamson felt it was essential for the audience to learn why the antagonists had become killers, but he also felt it was potentially scarier if they had no motivation. Opinions at the studio were split between those who believed a motive was needed for resolution and those who felt the action was scarier without one. As there were two killers, Williamson decided to do both: Billy Loomis had the motive of maternal abandonment, while the second killer, Stu Macher, jokingly suggests \"peer pressure\" as his motive when prompted.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\n=== Development ===\nThe script for what was then known as ''Scary Movie'' went on sale on a Friday in June 1995, but received no bids.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" /> By the following Monday, the script had become the subject of a significant bidding war among a host of established studios, including [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Pictures]], and [[Morgan Creek Entertainment|Morgan Creek Productions]].<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly1150\" /> [[Film producer|Producer]] Cathy Konrad read the script and felt it was exactly what the Weinstein brothers of the fledgling Dimension Films \u2013 then a part of Miramax \u2013 were looking for. Dimension had previously released several horror films and intended to focus on that genre. Konrad brought the script to Bob Weinstein's assistant, Richard Potter. Believing it had potential, he brought it to Weinstein's attention.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Studios began to drop out of the bidding as the price of the script increased, and the final two bidders were [[Oliver Stone]], who was at the time working under [[Cinergi Pictures]], and the Weinsteins of Dimension Films.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /><ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Williamson agreed to a bid of $400,000 from Miramax, plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film. Williamson said he chose Dimension because he believed they would produce ''Scary Movie'' immediately and without significantly censoring the violence in the script.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /><ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> Craven read the script before he became involved in the production, and considered convincing a studio to buy it for him to direct. However, by the time Craven read the script, it had already been sold.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" />\n\nBob Weinstein approached Craven early in the planning stages, because he felt Craven's previous work in the genre that combined horror and comedy would make him the perfect person to bring Williamson's script to screen. Craven was already busy developing a remake of ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' and was considering distancing himself from the horror genre. He was growing weary of what he felt was an inherent [[misogyny]] and violence in it.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Weinstein approached other directors, including [[Robert Rodriguez]], [[Danny Boyle]],<ref name=\"fangoria162\" /> [[George A. Romero]], and [[Sam Raimi]].<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Williamson said that they \"didn't get it\"; he was concerned that having read the script, many of the directors believed the film to be purely a comedy.<ref name=\"fangoria162\" /> Craven was approached again but continued to pass in spite of repeated requests. When production of ''The Haunting'' collapsed, Craven was freed from that commitment and found himself in need of a project.<ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> Meanwhile, Drew Barrymore had signed on to the film at her own request. When he heard an established actress wanted to be involved, Craven reasoned that ''Scary Movie'' might be different from other films of the genre he had previously undertaken, and he contacted Weinstein to accept the job.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" />\n\nAs the film neared completion, the Weinstein brothers changed the film's title from ''Scary Movie'' to ''Scream''.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> They were inspired by the [[Michael Jackson]] song of the [[Scream (Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson song)|same name]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/02/weinstein-miramax-200402|title=The Weinstein Way|date=February 5, 2011|access-date=December 13, 2021|website=Vanity Fair|last=Biskind|first=Peter|archive-date=April 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210416031830/https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/02/weinstein-miramax-200402|url-status=live}}</ref> Bob Weinstein considered ''Scary Movie'' to be an unsuitable title as, in addition to the horror and violence, the film contained elements of satire and comedy; Weinstein wished for that to be better conveyed by the title. The change was effected so late into production that congratulatory gifts bore the original name.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Williamson and Craven immediately disliked the new title, and considered it \"stupid\".<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Both later remarked that the change turned out to be positive, and that Weinstein had been wise to pick the new title.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Following a screening of the film in front of a [[test screening|test audience]] and Miramax executives, Craven was offered a two-picture contract for sequels to ''Scream''.<ref name=\"fangoria160\" />\n\n[[Sony Pictures]] filed a lawsuit against Dimension Films and Miramax, claiming that the title \"''Scream''\" infringed on the copyright of Sony's own ''[[Screamers (1995 film)|Screamers]]'' (1995), released the previous year. After the case was settled out of court\u2014the details remain confidential\u2014''[[Scream 2]]'' producer [[Marianne Maddalena]] considered that the case was a result of other issues between the two companies and did not truly pertain to the film's moniker. Maddalena confirmed that the studio was free to use the ''Scream'' brand for future films.<ref name=\"fangoria169\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{further|topic=cast members|List of Scream (film series) cast members}}\n''Scream'' was a turning point in terms of casting for the horror genre, which normally involved relatively unknown actors. The genre was considered unsuitable for bigger names as the films had lower budgets and often attained negative critical response.<ref name=\"fangoria169\" /> Drew Barrymore read the script and was interested in being involved. She approached the production team herself to request a role. Barrymore, a member of the [[Barrymore family]] of actors and granddaughter of actor [[John Barrymore]], had become a star in her own right following her appearance in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). The producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest, and signed her to play the lead role of [[Sidney Prescott]].<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" /><ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> Her involvement was believed to be instrumental in attracting other popular actors to the film in spite of its smaller budget, and in causing Craven to reconsider his decision to direct the film.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" /> Before filming began, Barrymore was faced with unexpected commitments that meant she would no longer be available to play the lead role. She instead played the smaller role of Casey Becker, which allowed her to remain involved and still gave the production the advantage of her stature.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> Killing off one of their biggest stars early in the film was considered a calculated risk, but it was believed that it would be so shocking and unexpected that the audience would then believe that any character could die.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Craven had seen [[Neve Campbell]] in the TV show ''[[Party of Five]]'' and asked her to audition for the part. He believed she could portray a character who was \"innocent\", but who could also realistically handle herself while dealing with the physical conflict and emotions required by the role.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" /><ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Campbell was initially reluctant to perform in another horror film so soon after her supporting role in ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]''.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" /> After a successful audition, Campbell accepted an offer to play the lead character. She accepted because ''Scream'' would be her first leading role, and because she adored the character, saying \"She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie.\"<ref name=\"fangoria162\" />\n\n[[File:Scream-cast-at-fountain.jpg|thumb|The central young cast of ''Scream''. From left to right: Ulrich, Campbell, Lillard, McGowan, and Kennedy.]]\nFor the character of news reporter Gale Weathers, the studio wanted a recognizable actress. They auditioned [[Brooke Shields]] and [[Janeane Garofalo]].<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> [[Courteney Cox]], who was starring in the sitcom ''[[Friends]]'' at the time, approached the production to pursue the role. She was interested in playing a \"bitch\" character to offset her \"nice\" ''Friends'' image. This image was the main reason why the producers initially refused to consider Cox for the part. Cox continued to lobby the studio as she felt she could believably play the character; her efforts ultimately succeeded.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" /> [[Rose McGowan]] was cast as Tatum Riley: the casting director believed she best embodied the \"spunky\", \"cynical\" but \"innocent\" nature of the character.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> The studio felt the strong female cast of Campbell, Barrymore, Cox, and McGowan would help draw a significant female audience to the film.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\n[[Skeet Ulrich]] was cast in the role of Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis. The producers viewed him as \"perfect\" for the part and noted his resemblance to a young [[Johnny Depp]] as he appeared in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', one of the many films referenced in ''Scream''.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Ulrich and Campbell had worked together on ''The Craft'' shortly before ''Scream''. They believed the experience helped them be more comfortable with each other, which allowed a more natural portrayal of the relationship between their characters.<ref name=\"fangoria162\" /> [[David Arquette]] was also approached for the role of Billy Loomis but he asked to read for the part of [[List of Scream (film series) characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]] after reading the script.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> The role, described as \"[[beefcake|hunky]]\", was considered ill-fitting for Arquette's lean, slender appearance and approach but Arquette was still allowed to audition for the part. Craven appreciated his softer, funnier approach to the character, and gave him the role.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" /> [[Matthew Lillard]] was cast as Billy's equally sadistic friend Stu Macher by chance after accompanying his then-girlfriend to an unrelated audition taking place elsewhere in the same building. Casting director Lisa Beach saw Lillard in the hallway and asked him to audition for the part.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> He got into the role with \"incredible ferocity\".<ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> Lillard would later confirm that he initially was supposed to audition for the role of Billy, but he was eventually persuaded to come back and audition for Stu instead.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stack|first=Tim|url=https://ew.com/article/2011/04/13/making-of-scream-matthew-lillard/|title=The Making of ''Scream'': Matthew Lillard Looks Back on Filming the Horror Classic|date=April 13, 2011|website=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=January 25, 2022|archive-date=January 25, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125203751/https://ew.com/article/2011/04/13/making-of-scream-matthew-lillard/|url-status=live}}</ref> The role of Randy Meeks was contested between [[Jamie Kennedy]] and [[Breckin Meyer]]. The producers favored Kennedy, believing him to best embody the role.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> As he had no major roles prior to ''Scream'', the studio wanted a more prominent actor than Kennedy to play the character. The producers were adamant that he was the best choice and successfully fought to keep him.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> According to Kennedy, [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] and [[Seth Green]] were in the running for the role as well.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/scream-movie-cast-stories-1235038248/#recipient_hashed=a400d779167255dff73775bea53938e8fe37f4d2a3df89513ed557f0f63f754d|title=\"Faster, Better and More Blood\": A ''Scream'' Oral History|date=October 29, 2021|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=January 25, 2022|archive-date=May 16, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220516033910/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/scream-movie-cast-stories-1235038248/#recipient_hashed=a400d779167255dff73775bea53938e8fe37f4d2a3df89513ed557f0f63f754d|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Roger L. Jackson]], voice of the character [[Ghostface (identity)|Ghostface]], was picked at the end of several weeks of local casting in Santa Rosa, where parts of ''Scream'' were filmed.<ref name=\"scream1filmlocations\" /> The producers had originally intended to use his voice only as a placeholder, [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] over it during post-production. They decided that Jackson's contribution was perfect and kept it.<ref name=\"scream3dvdcommentary\" /> Craven described it as an \"intelligent\" and \"evil\" voice that would become irreplaceable to the series.<ref name=\"Empire\" /> To aid their performance, Jackson was never allowed to meet the other actors, preventing them from associating a face with the menacing voice. Jackson was present on the set and spoke to actors by phone to help aid their performance.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\nThe cast was rounded out by [[W. Earl Brown]], who played Gale Weather's cameraman Kenny; [[Joseph Whipp]], who portrayed Sheriff Burke; Lawrence Hecht as Neil Prescott (Sidney's father); and C.W. Morgan as Hank Loomis (Billy's father). [[Liev Schreiber]] appeared in a minor role as Cotton Weary, the framed killer of Sidney's mother, and [[Linda Blair]] made a brief cameo as a TV reporter outside the school. [[Henry Winkler]] appeared as Principal Himbry, an aggressive school principal. He remained uncredited so as to not draw attention away from the young main cast.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Macherhouse.jpg|left|thumb|[[List of Scream (film series) characters#Stu Macher|Stu Macher]]{{'}}s house, the location of the 40-minute finale of the film.

The argument over where to film almost led to Craven being removed from the project, but the Weinsteins eventually agreed to keep the production in America.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> [[Location scout]]s looked at [[North Carolina]] as a possibility, but found that sites that seemed appropriate for the film's requirements would have required extensive building, repairs, or modification, which would have inflated costs.<ref name=\"behindthescreamdocu\" />\n\nAttention was next turned towards [[California]]; scouts discovered [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]] and the cities of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[Healdsburg, California|Healdsburg]], and the nearby [[Tomales Bay]]. The house of Barrymore's character is situated southeast of Santa Rosa on Sonoma Mountain Road, directly facing the house used in the horror film ''[[Cujo (film)|Cujo]]'' (1983).<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> The home of Sidney Prescott is located near [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]], north of Santa Rosa.<ref name=\"scream1filmlocations\" /> Tatum's home is situated on McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa, next to the houses used in ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960) and ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943).<ref name=\"scream1filmlocations2\" /> The home of Lillard's character, which is the location for the entire third act, is a house on Tomales Road east of Tomales Bay that had only recently become available after the death of its owners.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> The Woodsboro town square, including the fountain where many of the cast sit in an early scene, is represented by the Healdsburg town square.<ref name=\"scream1filmlocations\" />\n\nFor the Woodsboro high school, Craven desired a building that looked \"American\",<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> and the producers approached [[Santa Rosa High School (Santa Rosa, California)|Santa Rosa High School]]. The school board insisted on seeing the script and immediately objected to the violence against teenage children and the cynical, dark dialogue, including that of the fictional school principal.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /><ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Local newspapers criticized the project, and irate parents objected to such a film taking place at their children's school. Comparisons were made between film violence and the kidnap and [[murder of Polly Klaas]] three years prior, which had left the area sensitized toward violence.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> The producers received support from the school's students and some local residents, who recognized that economic benefits would be generated by the film's presence. Others argued for the film's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights. The dispute resulted in a three-hour debate scheduled for April&nbsp;16, one day after filming was to begin. Unwilling to be delayed, Craven began filming as scheduled on the 15th. He started with the opening scene of the film, which features Barrymore;<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> the scene took five days to complete.<ref name=\"EntertainmentWeekly1150\" /> The result of the Santa Rosa debate was that permission would be denied. The production was forced to find another location for the school, and ended up filming at the Sonoma Community Center, southeast of Santa Rosa.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" />\n\nThe progress of filming was criticized early on. Bob Weinstein disliked the Ghostface mask, believing it was not \"scary\". Upon reviewing the [[dailies]] footage of the opening scene, the studio was concerned that the film was progressing in an unwanted direction. They considered replacing Craven.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> To assuage their concerns, Craven and editor [[Patrick Lussier]] developed a rough [[workprint]] version of the opening 13 minutes of the film to demonstrate how the completed film might turn out. After viewing the new footage, the studio was content to let Craven continue as director. Weinstein, having seen the mask in action, was satisfied that it could be scary.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> The third and final act of the film, over forty minutes long, is set at a house party where Ghostface strikes. It was shot at a vacant property in Tomales over 21&nbsp;nights.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> The scene, labelled \"Scene 118\", was considered the most difficult to shoot as it took place entirely in one location yet featured the individual stories and deaths of multiple characters. Actors spent weeks undertaking intense emotional and physical scenes while coated in fake blood and wounds.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> As the scene was set during the evening, production had no choice but to halt at dawn.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" />\n\nDirector of photography [[Mark Irwin]] was fired during filming of ''Scream''{{'}}s finale, a week before [[principal photography]] was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was out of focus and unusable.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were to be fired, they would also have to fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with [[Peter Deming]], who finished the film.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" />\n\n=== Special effects and design ===\n[[File:Visualeffectsscream1.jpg|thumb|Barrymore's replica model and the chair used to display Steve Orth's death. Note the actor kneeling behind it.]]\nTo produce the many grisly effects for the film, the producers recruited KNB Effects team [[Howard Berger]], [[Robert Kurtzman]], and [[Gregory Nicotero]]. One of their first tasks was the production of a mask for the film's killer. In his script, Williamson had only described the antagonist as a \"masked killer\", which gave Craven no specific information on what type of mask to use or how to conceal the body.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> While location scouting, Maddalena discovered the Ghostface mask hanging from a post inside the house previously used for the film ''Shadow of a Doubt''.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Craven wanted to use it, but the mask design was owned by Fun World, a costume company. He was told to create one that the production could own.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> KNB developed multiple design sketches varying from deformed faces to monstrous visages riddled with fangs. Craven found nothing like the Ghostface design, so he had KNB develop a mask that was based on it, with enough differences to avoid any claim of copyright. The team developed several [[Molding (process)|molds]] based on the Ghostface design, but Craven found none were as suitable as the mask he wanted to use.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Desperate to use the design, Craven finally convinced the studio to approach Fun World and gained permission to use the mask. While negotiations were in progress, he had KNB make a mask that was very similar to the original mask, but was appropriate for use in filming. The mask they produced, made of a thin foam, was used in two scenes of the film: the opening scene with Barrymore's character and the murder of Principal Himbry. Craven disliked the mask due to its slight differences from the original, and thus used the Fun World design for the rest of filming.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\nKNB Effects created over 50 gallons of [[Theatrical blood|fake blood]], normally composed of corn syrup and food dye, to create the special effect of severe wounds.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> For the penetrating effect of knives, the production used collapsible blades to prevent injury. An umbrella with a retractable tip is used as a stabbing weapon in the finale. Ulrich wore a protective vest beneath his shirt to help prevent harm while a stuntwoman attacked him with it. The second thrust missed the vest and stabbed Ulrich on his chest, impacting a wound from an open heart surgery operation. Ulrich's genuine pain was captured on film and used in the release version of ''Scream''.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\nTwo of the most complex special effects in the film were the corpses of Barrymore's and Walls' characters, Casey Becker and Steve Orth.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> Their deaths involved the character being gutted from ribcage to pelvis, essentially hollowing out the torso of internal organs,<ref name=\"Scream1\" /> with the guts \"rolling\" from the wound.<ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> To allow Walls to continue to move and feign death while displaying the wound, KNB designed a chair with no back. The actor would kneel behind it while his upper body, head, and arms were positioned within the chair's seating area.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> An anatomical model representing the character's torso and legs was positioned in the chair and disguised so that the actor's upper body and the model appeared to be one piece. The fake abdomen was filled with rubber, latex, and gelatin pieces smeared in fake blood\u2014the \"internal organs\" \u2013 which could then fall free.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> The other effect involved Barrymore's character being gutted and hanged by the neck from a tree. The team utilized a similar approach, but replicated Barrymore's entire body, as it would be impossible to conceal her real body and display the special effect of her character having been gutted.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /><ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nAfter filming was completed in June 1996, Craven spent two months editing the final product. He encountered repeated conflicts with the [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]] (MPAA) concerning the content of scenes. He was forced to tone down or obscure the more intense scenes and overall violence to avoid an [[NC-17]] rating, which is considered \"box office suicide\"\u2014cinemas and retail chains often refused to stock NC-17 titles.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /><ref name=\"nc17deathformovies\" /> Though Dimension had previously released NC-17-rated films, the rating made those films difficult to market and attract an audience. Dimension was desperate for a less-restrictive [[Motion Picture Association film rating system|R rating]], but the producers felt the demanded cuts would remove key elements from the film and reduce its quality.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /> The opening scene featuring Barrymore was one of the most difficult parts to process through the MPAA, who required cuts based on its \"intensity\". Craven lied to the MPAA, claiming he had only one take of the scene and could not replace it with something less intense; the MPAA allowed the scene.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n{{Quote box|width=30em|align=left|quote=I'm a director who can do something very well but am not allowed to put it on screen. And they ultimately get you, as they did on this one, on intensity. They say, \"it's not a specific shot, it's not blood, it's just too intense\".|salign=right|source=\u2014Director Wes Craven on his conflict with MPAA censorship during production of ''Scream''<ref name=\"fangoria160\" />}}\nCraven sent eight different cuts of the film to deal with complaints. Problematic scenes included the gutting death of Steve Orth (Walls), where he was required to remove any movement of the character's internal organs; the throat-cutting of Kenny, where he had to trim the end of the scene, as the MPAA felt the actor's pained expression was too \"disturbing\"; and they had to shorten the length of time spent viewing the crushed head of Tatum Riley.<ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> The MPAA still held issue with a scene from the finale, where the killers (Ulrich and Lillard) stab each other, creating large amounts of visible blood. The MPAA required that the blood not be seen in motion\u2014falling to the floor from the body. It seemed unlikely that the film would be able to achieve an R rating without further significant cuts.<ref name=\"fangoria160\" /> With the film's release date drawing closer, Bob Weinstein intervened and personally contacted the MPAA. He believed they misunderstood the film and to which genre ''Scream'' really belonged, and were focusing too much on the horror elements.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Weinstein explained that although he agreed with their assessment that the film was \"intense\", the film also had comedic elements and satire; it was not just a horror film glorifying violence.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> The MPAA reviewed their decision; shortly thereafter the film was granted an R rating.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Listen|filename=SidneysLament.ogg|pos=right|title=''Marco Beltrami \u2013 Sidney's Lament''|description=The theme for the main character of Sidney Prescott by Marco Beltrami is used throughout the series.|format=[[Ogg]]}}The ''Scream'' score was provided by fledgling composer [[Marco Beltrami]], his first time scoring a feature film. Craven's assistant Julie Plec had requested input on composers who were \"new\", \"fresh\", and \"wonderful\", and was given Beltrami's name by several people. Beltrami was contacted for samples of his work. Craven, impressed by what he heard, requested Beltrami come to the set to view the opening thirteen minutes of the film containing the introduction and the death of Barrymore's character.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" /> Beltrami was tasked with scoring a piece of music for this scene, which would be reviewed by the producers and the Weinstein brothers. Beltrami was hired to score the entire film on the basis of this sample.<ref name=\"beltramiinterview\" /> Beltrami had no prior experience scoring a work of horror. Craven and editor Patrick Lussier advised him on how to deliver music that would raise the tension and how to use [[Sting (musical phrase)|stings]] to punctuate the more intense moments.<ref name=\"beltramiinterview\" /><ref name=\"bsospiritbeltrami\" /> Craven wanted the music to intentionally raise tension during scenes where audience expectations were already raised by their experience of previous horror films. The volume would be raised to indicate that the killer is hiding behind a door, but nothing would be present upon its opening.<ref name=\"scream1dvdcommentary\" />\n\nBeltrami decided to intentionally disregard conventional horror score styles. He approached the film as a [[western film|western]], taking influence from [[Ennio Morricone]], a prolific composer for many westerns.<ref name=\"beltramisite\" /> When scoring a theme for the character of Dewey (Arquette), Beltrami approached him as a \"quirky\" [[wild west]] sheriff, using a Morricone-style guitar accompaniment.<ref name=\"BeltramiScoreRunMovies\" /> Sidney Prescott's theme, titled \"Sidney's Lament\", features a female choral arrangement expressing \"sorrow\" concerning the character's situation. Beltrami states that the voice \"spoke\" for the character, \"lamenting\" the loss of her mother.<ref name=\"bsospiritbeltrami\" /> Christian Clemmensen of [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]] called the \"haunting\" vocals of the track the \"voice of the franchise\". The song was used throughout the film's sequels.<ref name=\"scream1score\" />\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n''Scream'' held its [[premiere]] on December 18, 1996, at the [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] Avco theater in [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood, Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"screampremieres\" /> Bob Weinstein ordered that the film be released on December 20, 1996, a date others were critical of as it was the Christmas period where seasonal and family films were more prevalent.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> Weinstein argued this fact was in the film's favor as it meant that horror fans and teenagers had nothing interesting to watch during the December period.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" /> When ''Scream''{{'}}s first weekend takings amounted to only $6{{nbsp}}million, it was considered that this release date gamble had failed, but the following week, takings did not drop but increased and continued to increase in the following weeks leading to a total U.S. gross of over $100{{nbsp}}million and high critical praise.<ref name=\"InsideStoryScream\" />\n\nIn cooperation with rights holder [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Fathom Events]] said it would re-release ''Scream'' in theaters for one night on October 10, 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3677349/relive-magic-seeing-wes-cravens-scream-theaters-october-11th/|title=Relive the Magic of Seeing Wes Craven's 'Scream' in Theaters on October 10th!|date=August 8, 2021|first=Brad|last=Miska|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|access-date=August 11, 2021|archive-date=March 22, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220322120207/https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3677349/relive-magic-seeing-wes-cravens-scream-theaters-october-11th/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Scream'' was released in the United States on [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3) [[LaserDisc]] (uncut) on July 2, 1997,<ref name=\"ldScream1ac3\" /> [[VHS]] on June 24, 1997, and a special release with the ''[[Scream 2]]'' trailer on December 2, 1997,<ref name=\"vhsScream1\" /> and on [[DVD]] on December 3, 1997.<ref name=\"dvdreleaseScream1\" /> A DTS LaserDisc uncut version was released on August 26, 1998,<ref name=\"ldScream1dts\" /> followed by a [[Special edition|collector's edition]] DVD of the film on December 8, 1998,<ref name=\"dvdreleaseScream1CE\" /> containing the film, the theatrical trailer, cast interviews, a director's commentary, and [[Making-of|behind the scenes]] information.<ref name=\"dvdScream1features\" /> These releases were all undertaken by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]].

The soundtrack features 11 songs\u2014most of which appeared in various scenes in the film\u2014plus a piece from the film's score, \"Trouble in Woodsboro\" / \"Sidney's Lament\", by Beltrami. The [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]] version of \"[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]\" appeared in the film following the closure of Woodsboro high school, but it was replaced with a [[Cover version|cover]] version of the song by [[The Last Hard Men (band)|The Last Hard Men]] on the album. An acoustic cover of [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]'s \"[[Don't Fear the Reaper]]\", performed by [[Gus Black]], plays softly in the background while Sidney and Billy discuss their relationship. The song was also one of the few songs featured in John Carpenter's ''Halloween'', a film to which ''Scream'' makes repeated homage. Analyst Jeff Smith describes the musical choice as: {{blockquote|An ironic comment on the brutality we have just seen in the opening sequence. More importantly, however, the allusion to the Blue \u00d6yster Cult classic recasts the song's title by literalizing its meaning. While the title itself invokes the Reaper as a popular symbol for death, the film presents us with an actual person, who not only dresses as the Grim Reaper but also unleashes homicidal vengeance on the other characters of the film. The irony here, of course, is that Billy himself proves to be one of the film's dual slashers and is, in fact, the \"Reaper\" to be feared.<ref name=\"JeffSmithAnalysis\" />}}\n\nThe song \"[[Red Right Hand]]\" by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], heard in the first film, is also used in ''Scream 2'', ''Scream 3'' and ''Scream'' (2022). Nick Cave performs a version of the track written specifically for ''Scream 3'' in that film. An alternate version of the music video \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" by [[Republica]], featuring clips from the film, was shown on music networks such as [[MTV]]. Although the song can be heard in the film, it is only included on the European edition of the soundtrack album. The song was also used in one of the film's television commercials. The soundtrack album was not considered a success, failing to chart on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=\"scream1soundtrack2\" /> [[AllMusic]] awarded the album 3 stars out of 5.<ref name=\"scream1soundtrack\" />\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline         = ''Scream: Music from the Dimension Motion Picture''\n| extra_column = Artist\n| total_length = 46:30\n| title1 = [[Youth of America (Birdbrain song)|Youth of America]]\n| writer1 = [[Joey Ammo]]\n| extra1 = [[Birdbrain (band)|Birdbrain]]\n| length1 = 3:03\n| title2 = [[Hot Saki and Bedtime Stories|Whisper]]\n| writer2 = Mark Rew, Keith Brown, Kerry Brown\n| extra2 = [[Catherine (alternative rock band)|Catherine]]\n| length2 = 3:12\n| title3 = [[Red Right Hand]]\n| writer3 = [[Mick Harvey]], [[Nick Cave]] and [[Thomas Wydler]]\n| extra3 = [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]\n| length3 = 6:11\n| title4 = [[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]\n| writer4 = [[Donald Roeser]]\n| extra4 = [[Gus Black]]\n| length4 = 4:47\n| title5 = Artificial World [Interdimensional Mix]\n| writer5 = Julee Cruise, Louis Tucci, Supa D.J.

The case became known as the \"Scream murder\" and fell under intense media scrutiny after the boys claimed they were inspired by ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2''. The pair confessed to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree, which would include purchasing two [[Ghostface (identity)#Concept and creation|Ghostface costumes]], as well as a [[Voice synthesizer|voice-changer]] used by the characters in the films. During their trial, Madeline Levine, a psychologist who studied the effect of violence on children, stated, \"There were a whole bunch of reasons why they acted out that way. But did the movie provide a blueprint? Absolutely.\"<ref name=\"controversyCBS\" /> The case was expected to highlight the effect of violent films on teenagers. However, presiding judge John Cheroske ordered that evidence pertaining to ''Scream'' be barred and that the case not be referred to as the \"Scream murder\", refusing media access to the courtroom, intending that the case be tried as murder and nothing else.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /><ref name=\"controversyCBS\" />\n\nOn January 17, 1999, 13-year-old Ashley Murray was stabbed multiple times in the head and back before being left for dead by his friends Daniel Gill, 14, and Robert Fuller, 15. He was later found and saved by an elderly man walking his dog. The pair were dubbed the \"Scream attackers\" after it emerged that they had watched ''Scream'' shortly before the attack and drawings of the Ghostface mask were found among their possessions. Their actions were additionally blamed on [[physical abuse]], drugs and exposure to [[black magic]] in their home life.<ref name=\"controversyBBC\" /> Murray, who later testified against the pair, stated that he believed the film may have influenced the pair to attack him.<ref name=\"controversyIndependent\" />\n\nOn May 4, 1999, following the [[Columbine High School massacre]] and increasing news media reports on the effects of violent films, games, and other media on society, the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Commerce committee]] held a hearing about Hollywood's marketing of films to youths. The committee focused specifically on horror films. The opening scene of ''Scream'', featuring the murder of Casey Becker, was shown to the committee as an example of negative media which may be viewed by children.<ref name=\"ETrueHollywoodStory\" /><ref name=\"controversySenate\" />\n\nOn June 3, 2002, a 17-year-old boy lured his friend, 15-year-old Alice Beaup\u00e8re, out of her parents' house in [[Saint-S\u00e9bastien-sur-Loire]], France, and stabbed her 42 times while wearing a Ghostface mask. He ran away when he saw a neighbor approaching, and the girl told the neighbor the name of her attacker before she died from her injuries. After being arrested, the boy told police that he had wanted to kill someone to emulate the Ghostface character from ''Scream''.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/l-ado-meurtrier-s-est-inspire-du-film-scream-05-06-2002-2003130492.php |title=L'ado meurtrier s'est inspir\u00e9 du film \"Scream\" |last1=Dumond |first1=Julien |last2=Landais |first2=Rodolphe |location=Nantes |date=June 5, 2002 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |language=fr-FR |access-date=September 24, 2019 |trans-title=Teen murderer inspired by film \"Scream\" |archive-date=April 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424121827/http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/l-ado-meurtrier-s-est-inspire-du-film-scream-05-06-2002-2003130492.php |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/student-charged-with-murder-amid-concerns-in-france-over-violent-films-1.1059656 |title=Student charged with murder amid concerns in France over violent films |last=Marlowe |first=Lara |author-link=Lara Marlowe |location=Paris |work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=June 6, 2002 |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-date=October 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030081429/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/student-charged-with-murder-amid-concerns-in-france-over-violent-films-1.1059656 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/scream-mask-killer-stabbed-girl-42-times-f08p8fdvgnp |title=Scream mask killer stabbed girl 42 times |last=Sage |first=Adam |date=May 1, 2004 |location=Paris |work=[[The Times]] |access-date=September 24, 2019 |issn=0140-0460 |archive-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924182225/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/scream-mask-killer-stabbed-girl-42-times-f08p8fdvgnp |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nPrior to ''Scream''{{'}}s release, the popularity of the horror genre had been considered to be in decline, with many films released straight-to-video while those released in cinemas were sequels to popular and established franchises, such as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]],'' ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', capable of drawing audiences despite decreasing budgets and diminishing critical reception. The glut of sequels contributed to audience familiarity with the icons of the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Jason Voorhees]], and that familiarity was considered to have dampened their ability to instill fear or interest in their audiences.<ref name=\"ImpactHorrorFilmHistory\" /> ''Scream'', utilizing a popular and attractive cast and an innovative script that both mocked and embraced the conventions of horror which had become considered clich\u00e9d, was credited with changing the status of the genre, becoming both a financial and critical success, and launching the careers of many of its actors.<ref name=\"MovieFoneScreamsLegacy\" /> Such was the film's impact that some commentators considered its legacy as the creation of a distinct era of \"post-Scream\" horror films. Following its release, many studios, including ''Scream''{{'}}s own Dimension Films, rushed to capitalize on its unexpected success with the release of films such as ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997), ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'' (1998) and ''[[Cherry Falls]]'' (2000), as well as sequels to popular, but diminishing, franchises such as ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' and ''[[Bride of Chucky]]''.<ref name=\"MovieFoneScreamsLegacy\" />\n\nMuch of the humor of the 2000 film ''[[Scary Movie]]'' relies upon specific references to other contemporary films. [[Roger Ebert]] remarked in his review that \"to get your money's worth, you need to be familiar with the various teenage horror franchises.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000707/REVIEWS/7070303 |title=Scary Movie |access-date=April 18, 2011 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=July 7, 2000 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |archive-date=August 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824200343/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20000707%2FREVIEWS%2F7070303 |url-status=live }}</ref> The two films on which the script is most heavily based are ''Scream'' and ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer (film)|I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997), utilizing the general narrative arcs of both films, and featuring comedic recreations of key scenes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/04/scary-movie-franchise-every-film-spoofed-referenced.html# |work=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] |title=Every Movie 'Spoofed' in the Scary Movie Franchise |first=Adam K. |last=Raymond |date=April 15, 2013 |access-date=May 4, 2016 |archive-date=April 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422053955/http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/scary-movie-franchise-every-film-spoofed-referenced.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The backstory in which the teenagers are responsible for accidentally killing a man following a beauty pageant recalls the same plot point in ''I Know What You Did Last Summer''.
