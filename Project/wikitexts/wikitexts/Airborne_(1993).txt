His zoologist parents are given the opportunity for grant work in [[Australia]] for six months. Eager to accompany his parents to the surf-friendly shores of the South Pacific, he is dismayed to find out that he will not be joining them and instead will be living with his aunt and uncle in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], to finish the remainder of his high school semester. He arrives in the midst of a winter storm to a blue-collar Midwestern city, quickly coming to the realization that this is far from the free-spirited beach atmosphere that he has been accustomed to. To add to his disillusion, he meets his cousin Wiley, who at first glance is an awkward teenager and whose parents' lifestyle and demeanor, though warm and hospitable, is a bit old-fashioned.\n\nMitchell is met on his first day at school with obstacles. He is antagonized by the gritty [[ice hockey|hockey]] players who chastise Mitchell for his easy going \"[[Maharishi]]\" philosophy and \"California\" appearance. The hockey players include Jack, Augie, Snake, Rosenblatt, and the Banduccis. With an upcoming game against the rival \"[[preppy|preps]]\", Wiley and subsequently Mitchell are asked to fill-in for two students undergoing punishment for misbehavior. Mitchell inadvertently scores a goal for the preps, cementing the disdain of the hockey players, and in particular Jack, who tackles Mitchell while still on the ice, concussing him and leaving him unconscious for what appears to be hours. Over the course of the next few weeks, Mitchell and Wiley are harassed relentlessly, culminating with Mitchell having a dream which convinces him to peacefully confront the situation.\n\nDuring the interim, Mitchell falls in love with Nikki. During a double date with his cousin and Nikki's friend Gloria, the leader of the preps, Blane, physically confronts Mitchell, who is only saved when Jack arrives to stand up for Nikki who, as it turns out, is also Jack's sister. Mitchell's dream comes to fruition when he decides to proactively join Jack and his ice hockey brethren for a street hockey game against the preps. Mitchell embarrasses Blane, causing a change of heart from his teammates. Later, Snake, Augie, and the Banduccis solicit Mitchell's help and rollerblading expertise in a race down a harrowing street route termed Devil's Backbone against the preps. It is agreed upon that the first team with three members crossing the finish line will be deemed the winner. An aggressive and athletic Snake reaches the finish first for Mitchell's team, but two preps swiftly follow suit. Needing only one more person to win and with Blane in sight of the end, he decides to barrel into Mitchell but poorly times his attack and instead lands in the waters below. This leaves Jack and Mitchell in clear sight of the finish line, as they approach in tandem victory to the cheers of their awaiting schoolmates, and kisses of respective love interests. Mitchell has finally earned the respect of Jack and his friends, and he is lifted on the shoulders of a cheering crowd.\n\n==Cast==\n* Shane McDermott as Mitchell Goosen\n* [[Seth Green]] as Wiley Metzner\n* [[Brittney Powell]] as Nikki\n* [[Chris Conrad (actor)|Chris Conrad]] as Jack\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Irene Metzner\n* [[Patrick Thomas O'Brien|Patrick O'Brien]] as Louie Metzner\n* [[Jack Black]] as Jose Augusto Rafael \"Augie\" de la Parra\n* [[Alanna Ubach]] as Gloria\n* [[Jacob Vargas]] as \"Snake\"\n* Owen Stadele as Blane\n* [[Jessica Boevers]] as Alexis\n* [[Chris Edwards (skater)|Chris Edwards]] as Walt\n* Daniel Betances as Tony Banducci\n* David Betances as Mark Banducci\n* Travis Hafer as Ice Skating / Roller Hockey Extra\n* Christian McVeigh as \"Supermac\"\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds a 21% approval rating, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 2.74/10.

The occasional action scenes are as appropriately tortuous as the tired teen out of water plot is torturous. This is a kid flick that's speed skating on one leg.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-20/entertainment/ca-37175_1_airborne-skates-movie | title='Airborne' Skates Past Plot Points | last=Willman | first=Chris | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=September 20, 1993 | accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s [[Stephen Holden]] called it \"a modest attempt to take a familiar genre, the surf movie, and spin it into a new subgenre, the Rollerblades film.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/18/movies/review-film-making-a-race-on-skates-the-reason-to-exist.html | title=Making a Race on Skates the Reason to Exist | last=Holden | first=Stephen | authorlink=Stephen Holden | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 18, 1993 | accessdate=April 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was released in 982 theaters.
