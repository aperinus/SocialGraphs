Wilder also wrote the script, adapting it from the [[Yves Robert]] film ''[[Pardon Mon Affaire]]'' (''Un \u00e9l\u00e9phant \u00e7a trompe \u00e9norm\u00e9ment''). It co-stars [[Charles Grodin]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Joseph Bologna]], [[Judith Ivey]], and [[Kelly LeBrock]]. The film won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]\", written and performed by [[Stevie Wonder]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[San Francisco]] advertising man Theodore \"Teddy\" Pierce is amused by, then infatuated with Charlotte, a beautiful woman whose [[red]] [[dress]] goes billowing over her head by a gust of wind from [[White dress of Marilyn Monroe|crossing over a ventilation grate]], and exposing her red [[satin]] [[panties|string bikini panties]]. Despite his interest, Teddy is already happily married to Didi, but he cannot get this woman out of his mind. When his friend Joe, who has an affair of his own, is abandoned by his wife, who leaves with everything, Teddy gets cold feet and decides to forget it. Still, when he tells his friends Buddy, Joe, and Michael, they encourage him, and after meeting the woman again through his office window, he tries to ask her for a date, but mistakenly phones Ms. Milner, a plain ad-agency employee who is flattered by his interest.\n\nFrom the beginning, his attempts at an affair are doomed, as he creates a charade to get to the date, but Didi tells him that their neighbor told them to take care of her small boy. Ms. Milner gets her revenge by bending Teddy's car antenna and scratching his car. Ms. Milner later tries to make amends, but later when Teddy sees that she is the one who got the memo for the date, he flees, and once more she gets her revenge by letting go of Teddy's car brake, causing him to crash his car. Ms. Milner later acts amicably with Teddy, because she already started seeing another work colleague, much to Teddy's confusion. Charlotte later agrees to meet for dinner with Teddy after he steadfastly asks for one, but once again, his plans fail when he receives a call from Charlotte saying she is in Los Angeles working and to go meet her. He creates another charade by writing a fake telegram from work and sending it to himself, telling him to go to Los Angeles, but due to the airport being fogged in, his flight is detoured to San Diego.\n\nTeddy ultimately does become acquainted with the woman in red, a [[British people|British]] [[model (fashion)|model]] named Charlotte, going [[horseback riding]] with her (after finding out she rode horseback), and even inviting her out on what is supposed to be a date with his nanny, but turns out to be an early surprise party with his relatives and Didi. Teddy's friend Buddy, who goes along them lending his car and being a chauffeur after losing a bet with Teddy, rapidly creates an excuse so as to not arouse any suspicions. After Buddy, Joe and Michael create a ruse to take him to Charlotte, he radically alters his wardrobe and begins acting nonchalant to try to capture his love's interest.\n\nEvents come to a head in Charlotte's high-rise [[apartment]], where she invites Teddy into her satin bed. He is thrilled, as he is finally about to consummate his fantasy, until her [[airline pilot]] husband suddenly comes home. Trying to escape, Teddy ends up on a ledge, where passersby below gather as they believe he is about to [[suicide|take his own life]], all captured on live television. Didi, while watching this on live television, tears up as she believes Teddy is doing this because of her own cheating. After hearing Charlotte making love with her husband, he decides that the affair is not worth it and jumps off the window ledge, and waits to be caught by the firemen. While falling, Teddy sees a lovely newswoman who smiles at him, perhaps hinting at another affair chase.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Ted Pierce\n* [[Kelly LeBrock]] as Charlotte, the [[title character]]\n* [[Gilda Radner]] as Ms. Milner\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Buddy\n* [[Joseph Bologna]] as Joe\n* [[Judith Ivey]] as Didi Pierce\n* [[Michael Zorek]] as Shelly\n* Michael Huddleston as Michael\n* Kyle T.
