The story was based on the 1954 novel ''[[The Living and the Dead (Boileau-Narcejac novel)|D'entre les morts]]'' (''From Among the Dead'') by [[Boileau-Narcejac]]. The screenplay was written by [[Alec Coppel]] and [[Samuel A. Taylor]]. The film stars [[James Stewart]] as former police [[detective]] John \"Scottie\" Ferguson, who has retired because an incident in the line of duty has caused him to develop [[acrophobia]] (an extreme fear of heights) and [[vertigo]] (a false sense of rotational movement). Scottie is hired by an acquaintance, Gavin Elster, as a [[private investigator]] to follow Gavin's wife Madeleine ([[Kim Novak]]), who is behaving strangely.\n\nThe film was shot on location in the city of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], as well as in [[Mission San Juan Bautista]], [[Big Basin Redwoods State Park]], Cypress Point on [[17-Mile Drive]], and [[Paramount Studios]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. It is the first film to use the [[dolly zoom]], an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie's acrophobia. As a result of its use in this film, the effect is often referred to as \"the ''Vertigo'' effect\".\n\n''Vertigo'' received mixed reviews upon initial release, but is now often cited as a classic Hitchcock film and one of the defining works of his career. Attracting significant scholarly criticism, it replaced ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) as the [[List of films considered the best|greatest film ever made]] in the 2012 British Film Institute's ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics' poll.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19078948|title=Vertigo is named 'greatest film of all time'|work=BBC News |date=August 2, 2012 |access-date=August 18, 2012}}</ref> The film has appeared repeatedly in polls of the best films by the [[American Film Institute]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/ |title=AFI's 10 Top 10 |website=American Film Institute |access-date=February 21, 2012}}</ref> including a 2007 ranking as [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|the ninth-greatest American movie of all time]].

Scottie tries to conquer his fear, but his ex-fianc\u00e9e, underwear designer Marjorie 'Midge' Wood, says that another severe emotional shock may be the only cure.\n\nGavin Elster, an acquaintance from college, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming that she has been behaving strangely and her mental state is abnormal. Scottie reluctantly agrees and follows Madeleine to a florist where she buys a bouquet, to the [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] and the grave of Carlotta Valdes (1831\u20131857) and to the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honor]] art museum where she gazes at the ''Portrait of Carlotta''. He watches her enter the McKittrick Hotel, but upon investigating, she does not seem to be there.\n\nA local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes committed suicide: she had been the mistress of a wealthy married man and bore his child; the otherwise childless man kept the child and cast Carlotta aside. Gavin reveals Carlotta (who he fears is possessing Madeleine) is Madeleine's great-grandmother, although Madeleine has no knowledge of this and does not remember the places she has visited. Scottie tails Madeleine to [[Fort Point, San Francisco|Fort Point]] and when she leaps into the bay, he rescues her.\n\nThe next day, Madeleine stops to deliver a letter of gratitude for Scottie, and they decide to spend the day together. They travel to [[Muir Woods]] and Cypress Point on [[17-Mile Drive]], where Madeleine runs down towards the ocean. Scottie grabs her and they embrace. The following day, Madeleine visits Scottie and recounts a nightmare. Scottie identifies its setting as [[Mission San Juan Bautista]], the childhood home of Carlotta. He drives her there and they express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower. Scottie, halted on the steps by his acrophobia, sees Madeleine plunge to her death.\n\nThe death is declared a suicide. Gavin does not fault Scottie, but Scottie breaks down, becomes [[Clinical depression|clinically depressed]] and is sent to a [[sanatorium]], almost [[catatonic]]. Following his release, Scottie frequents the places that Madeleine visited, often imagining that he sees her. One day, he notices a woman on the street who reminds him of Madeleine, despite her different appearance. Scottie follows her to her hotel room where she identifies herself as Judy Barton, from [[Salina, Kansas]].\n\nJudy has a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] revealing that she was the person Scottie knew as \"Madeleine Elster.\" She was impersonating Gavin's wife in an elaborate murder scheme. Judy drafts a letter to Scottie explaining her involvement: Gavin had deliberately taken advantage of Scottie's acrophobia to substitute his wife's freshly killed body in the apparent \"suicide jump.\" However, Judy rips up the letter and continues the charade because she loves Scottie.\n\nThey begin seeing each other, but Scottie remains obsessed with \"Madeleine.\" He asks Judy to change her clothes and dye her hair to resemble Madeleine. After Judy complies, hoping that they may finally find happiness together, he notices her wearing the necklace portrayed in Carlotta's painting. Scottie realizes the truth and insists on driving Judy back again to the Mission.\n\nThere, he tells her he must re-enact the event that led to his madness, admitting he now understands that \"Madeleine\" and Judy are the same person, and that Judy was Gavin's mistress before being cast aside, just as Carlotta was. Scottie forces her up the bell tower and makes her admit her deceit. Scottie reaches the top, finally conquering his acrophobia. Judy confesses that Gavin paid her to impersonate a \"possessed\" Madeleine. Judy begs Scottie to forgive her because she loves him. He embraces Judy, but a shadowy figure \u2014 actually a nun investigating the noise \u2014 rises from the tower's trapdoor, startling her. Judy suddenly lunges backward and accidentally falls to her death. Scottie, bereaved once again but cured of his fear of heights, stands on the ledge while the nun rings the mission bell.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[James Stewart]] as John \"Scottie\" Ferguson\n*[[Kim Novak]] as Judy Barton and Madeleine Elster\n*[[Tom Helmore]] as Gavin Elster \n*[[Barbara Bel Geddes]] as Marjorie \"Midge\" Wood\n*[[Henry Jones (actor)|Henry Jones]] as the coroner\n*[[Raymond Bailey]] as Scottie's doctor\n*[[Ellen Corby]] as the manager of the McKittrick Hotel\n*[[Konstantin Shayne]] as bookstore owner Pop Leibel\n*[[Lee Patrick (actress)|Lee Patrick]] as the car owner mistaken for Madeleine\n'''Uncredited'''\n*Margaret Brayton as the Ransohoff's saleslady\n*[[Paul Bryar]] as Capt.

As Barr states in his book, \"This story of a man who develops a romantic obsession with the image of an enigmatic woman has commonly been seen, by his colleagues as well as by critics and biographers, as one that engaged Hitchcock in an especially profound way; and it has exerted a comparable fascination on many of its viewers. After first seeing it as a teenager in 1958, [[Donald Spoto]] had gone back for 26 more viewings by the time he wrote ''The Art of Alfred Hitchcock'' in 1976. In a 1996 magazine article, Geoffrey O'Brien cites other cases of 'permanent fascination' with ''Vertigo'', and then casually reveals that he himself, starting at age 15, has seen it 'at least thirty times'.\"{{sfn|Barr|2002|p=12}}\n\nCritics have interpreted ''Vertigo'' variously as \"a tale of male aggression and visual control; as a map of female Oedipal trajectory; as a deconstruction of the male construction of femininity and of masculinity itself; as a stripping bare of the mechanisms of directorial, Hollywood studio and colonial oppression; and as a place where textual meanings play out in an infinite regress of self-reflexivity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=Susan |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-last=Allen |editor2-first=Sam |editor2-last=Ishii-Gonzales |title=Alfred Hitchcock: Centenary Essays |publisher=BFI |location=London |year=1999 |page=279 |chapter=''Vertigo'' and Problems of Knowledge in Feminist Film Theory |isbn=978-0-85170-735-8}} cited in {{harvnb|Barr|2002|page=19}}</ref> Critic James F. Maxfield has suggested that ''Vertigo'' can be interpreted as a variant on the [[Ambrose Bierce]] short story \"[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]\" (1890), and that the main narrative of the film is actually imagined by Scottie, whom we see dangling from a building at the end of the opening rooftop chase.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/09/08/is-vertigo-just-the-fever-dream-of-a-dying-man/|title=Is Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" just the fever dream of a dying man?|date=September 8, 2018|website=Salon}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer Novak.jpg|thumb|Kim Novak as \"Madeleine\", who wakes in Scottie's bed after apparently trying to drown herself]]\n\nThe [[screenplay]] of ''Vertigo'' is an adaptation of the French novel ''[[D'entre les morts]]'' (''From Among the Dead'') by [[Boileau-Narcejac|Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac]]. Hitchcock had attempted to buy the rights to the previous novel by the same authors, ''Celle qui n'\u00e9tait plus'' (She Who Was No More), but he failed, and it was made instead by [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]] as ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E5DD153EF936A35754C0A96E958260 |title= Thomas Narcejac, 89, Author of Crime Novels |website=The New York Times |date=July 5, 1998 |access-date=December 1, 2007}}</ref> Although [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] once suggested that ''D'entre les morts'' was specifically written for Hitchcock by Boileau and Narcejac,{{sfn|Truffaut|Hitchcock|1985|p={{page needed|date=January 2021}}}} Narcejac subsequently denied that this was their intention.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=}} However, Hitchcock's interest in their work meant that [[Paramount Pictures]] commissioned a synopsis of ''D'entre les morts'' in 1954, before it had even been translated into English (it appeared in translation as [[The Living and the Dead (Boileau-Narcejac novel)|''The Living and the Dead'']] in 1956).{{sfn|Auiler|1999|p=30}}\n\n[[File:Mission San Juan Bautista.jpg|thumb|The scenes with \"Madeleine\", and subsequently Judy, at [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] used the real Mission location with a much higher bell tower as a [[special effect]].]]\n\nIn the book, Judy's involvement in Madeleine's death was not revealed until the [[denouement]]. At the script stage, Hitchcock suggested revealing the secret two-thirds of the way through the film, so that the audience would understand Judy's mental dilemma.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=547\u2013548}} After the first preview, Hitchcock was unsure whether to keep the \"letter writing scene\" or not. He decided to remove it. Herbert Coleman, Vertigo's associate producer and a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, felt the removal was a mistake. However, Hitchcock said, \"Release it just like that.\" James Stewart, acting as mediator, said to Coleman, \"Herbie, you shouldn't get so upset with Hitch. The picture's not that important.\" Hitchcock's decision was supported by [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], another member of his circle, who felt that the film had been improved. Coleman reluctantly made the necessary edits. When he received news of this, Paramount head [[Barney Balaban]] was very vocal about the edits and ordered Hitchcock to \"Put the picture back the way it was.\" As a result, the \"letter writing scene\" remained in the final film.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=563\u2013564}}\n\n===Writing===\nThere were three screenwriters involved in the writing of ''Vertigo''. Hitchcock originally hired playwright [[Maxwell Anderson]] to write a screenplay, but rejected his work, which was titled ''Darkling, I Listen,'' a quotation from [[John Keats|Keats's]] ''[[Ode to a Nightingale]].'' According to Charles Barr in his monograph dedicated to ''Vertigo'', \"Anderson was the oldest (at 68) [of the 3 writers involved], the most celebrated for his stage work and the least committed to cinema, though he had a joint script credit for Hitchcock's preceding film ''The Wrong Man''. He worked on adapting the novel during Hitchcock's absence abroad, and submitted a treatment in September 1956.\"{{sfn|Barr|2002|p=26}}\n\nA second version, written by [[Alec Coppel]], again left the director dissatisfied.<ref name=\"obsessed\" /> The final script was written by [[Samuel A. Taylor]]\u2014who was recommended to Hitchcock due to his knowledge of San Francisco\u2014{{sfn|Auiler|1999|p=30}} from notes by Hitchcock. Among Taylor's creations was the character of Midge.{{sfn|Auiler|1999|p=51}} Taylor attempted to take sole credit for the screenplay, but Coppel protested to the [[Screen Writers Guild]], which determined that both writers were entitled to a credit, but to leave Anderson out of the film writing credits.{{sfn|Auiler|1999|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Vera Miles]], who was under personal contract to Hitchcock and had appeared on both his television show and in his film ''[[The Wrong Man (film)|The Wrong Man]]'', was originally scheduled to play Madeleine. She modeled for an early version of the painting featured in the film.<ref name=\"obsessed\" /> Following delays, including Hitchcock becoming ill with gallbladder problems, Miles became pregnant and so had to withdraw from the role.<ref name=\"obsessed\" /> The director declined to postpone shooting and cast [[Kim Novak]] as the female lead. By the time Novak had delayed prior film commitments and a vacation promised by [[Columbia Pictures]], the studio that held her contract, Miles had given birth and was available for the film. Hitchcock proceeded with Novak, nevertheless. Columbia head [[Harry Cohn]] agreed to lend Novak to ''Vertigo'' if Stewart would agree to co-star with Novak in ''[[Bell, Book and Candle]]'', a Columbia production released in December 1958.\n\n===Filming===\n====Initial on-site principal photography====\n''Vertigo'' was filmed from September to December 1957.{{sfn|Auiler|2000|p=185}} Principal photography began on location in [[San Francisco]] in September 1957 under the [[working title]] ''From Among the Dead'' (the literal translation of ''D'entre les morts'').<ref name=\"obsessed\" /> The film uses extensive location footage of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], with its steep hills and tall arching bridges. In the driving scenes shot in the city, the main characters' cars are almost always pictured heading ''down'' the city's steeply inclined streets.{{sfn|Auiler|2000|p=185}} In October 1996, the restored print of ''Vertigo'' debuted at the [[Castro Theatre]] in San Francisco with a live on-stage introduction by Kim Novak, providing the city a chance to celebrate itself.{{sfn|Kraft|Leventhal|2002}} Visiting the San Francisco film locations has something of a cult following as well as modest tourist appeal. Such a tour is featured in a subsection of [[Chris Marker]]'s documentary montage ''[[Sans Soleil]]''.\n\n[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer embrace 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|James Stewart as Scottie, and Kim Novak as Judy, in Scottie's apartment, with [[Coit Tower]] visible through the window]]\n\nThe scene in which Madeleine fell from the tower was filmed at [[Mission San Juan Bautista]], a [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish mission]] in [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]], [[California]]. Associate producer Herbert Coleman's daughter Judy Lanini suggested the mission to Hitchcock as a filming location. A steeple, added sometime after the mission's original construction and secularization, had been demolished following a fire, so Hitchcock added a bell tower using scale models, [[matte painting]]s, and trick photography at the Paramount studio in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"obsessed\">\"Obsessed with ''Vertigo''\", directed by Harrison Engle, documentary included on many DVD releases</ref> The original tower was much smaller and less dramatic than the film's version.

The original tower was much smaller and less dramatic than the film's version.\n*The Carlotta Valdes headstone featured in the film (created by the props department) was left at [[Mission Dolores]]. Eventually, the headstone was removed as the mission considered it disrespectful to the dead to house a tourist attraction grave for a fictional person. All other cemeteries in San Francisco were evicted from city limits in 1912, so the screenwriters had no other option but to locate the grave at Mission Dolores.\n*Madeleine jumps into the sea at [[Fort Point, San Francisco|Fort Point]], underneath the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].\n*The gallery where Carlotta's painting appears is the [[California Palace of the Legion of Honor]] in San Francisco. The Carlotta Valdes portrait was lost after being removed from the gallery, but many of the other paintings in the background of the portrait scenes are still on view.\n*What purports to be [[Muir Woods National Monument]] in the film is in fact [[Big Basin Redwoods State Park]]; however, the cutaway of the redwood tree showing its age was copied from one that can still be found at Muir Woods.\n*The coastal region where Scottie and Madeleine first kiss is Cypress Point, along the [[17 Mile Drive]] near [[Pebble Beach, California|Pebble Beach]]. However, the lone tree they kiss next to was a prop brought specially to the location.{{sfn|Auiler|1999|p=90}}\n*The domed building Scottie and Judy walk past is the [[Palace of Fine Arts]].\n*[[Coit Tower]] appears in many background shots. Hitchcock once said that he included it as a [[phallic symbol]].{{sfn|Kraft|Leventhal|2002|p=122}} Also prominent in the background is the tower of the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]].\n*The exterior of the sanatorium where Scottie is treated was St. Joseph's Hospital, located at 355 Buena Vista East, across from [[Buena Vista Park]]. The hospital, which was not a sanatorium, was closed in 1979  and then converted into condominiums. The building, built in 1928, is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n*Gavin and Madeleine's apartment building is \"The Brocklebank\" at 1000 Mason Street on [[Nob Hill]], which still looks essentially the same. It is across the street from the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]], where Hitchcock usually stayed when he visited and where many of the cast and crew stayed during filming. Shots of the surrounding neighborhood feature the [[Flood Mansion]] and [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]]. Barely visible is the [[Mark Hopkins Hotel]], mentioned in an early scene in the movie.\n*The \"McKittrick Hotel\" was a privately owned Victorian mansion from the 1880s at Gough and Eddy Streets. It was torn down in 1959 and is now an athletic practice field for [[Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory]] School. The St. Paulus Lutheran Church, seen across from the mansion, was destroyed in a fire in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2010/09/free_farm_at_gough_and_eddy_in_full_bloom.html |title=From The Flames Of St. Paulus The Free Farm Blooms at SocketSite\u2122 |publisher=Socketsite.com |access-date=February 4, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Podesta Baldocchi]] is the flower shop Madeleine visits as she is being followed by Scottie.

Once sufficient location footage had been obtained, interior sets were designed and constructed in the studio.<ref name=\"obsessed\" />\n\nHitchcock popularized the [[dolly zoom]] in this film, leading to the technique's sobriquet, amongst several others, \"the ''Vertigo'' effect\". This \"dolly-out/zoom-in\" method involves the camera physically moving away from a subject whilst simultaneously zooming in{{efn|Some sources say that ''Vertigo'' uses dolly-in/zoom-out. The ''Obsessed with Vertigo'' [[DVD documentary]] says that the shot was achieved by \"zooming forward and tracking backward simultaneously\".}} (a similar effect can be achieved in reverse), so that the subject retains its size in the frame, but the background's perspective changes.{{sfn|Klein|2005|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfn|Mamer|2008|p=25}} Hitchcock used the effect to look down the tower shaft to emphasise its height and Scottie's disorientation.{{sfn|Sipos|2010|pp=120\u2013121}} Following difficulties filming the shot on a full-sized set, a model of the tower shaft was constructed, and the dolly zoom was filmed horizontally.<ref name=\"obsessed\" /> The \"special sequence\" (Scottie's nightmare sequence) was designed by artist [[John Ferren]], who also created the painting of Carlotta used in the film.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjrX5p_qkc4C&q=John+Ferren+Carlotta+painting+producer&pg=PA199 |title=The San Francisco of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo: Place, Pilgrimage, and Commemoration |last=Cunningham |first=Douglas A. |date=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8122-8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/new-film-history-book-frames-artworks-as-the-stars-of-the-silver-screen-8545|title=New Film History Book Frames Artworks as the Stars of the Silver Screen |last=Fuller |first=Graham |date=April 7, 2014|work=artnet news|access-date=April 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNsiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT100 |title=Vertigo: The Making of a Hitchcock Classic: Special Edition|last=Auiler|first=Dan|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=Dan Auiler |isbn=978-1-311-53317-3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.famsf.org/files/vertigo_4.pdf |title=Alfred Hitchcock and San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nThe rotating patterns in the title sequence were done by [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]], who used a [[mechanical computer]] called the [[3-inch Gun M5|M5 gun]] [[Director (military)|director]], [[wikt:AKA|AKA]] the [[Kerrison Predictor]], which was used during World War II to aim anti-aircraft cannons at moving targets.

It was conducted by [[Muir Mathieson]] and recorded in Europe because there was a musicians' strike in the U.S.<ref name=\"ScorseseMusic\">{{cite journal |first=Martin |last=Scorsese |author-link=Martin Scorsese |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711082930/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/filmmusic/detail.php?t=d&q=42\n|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/filmmusic/detail.php?t=d&q=42 |title=The Best Music in Film: Martin Scorsese |date=September 2004 |journal=[[Sight & Sound]] |archive-date=July 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2004 special issue of the [[British Film Institute]]'s (BFI) magazine ''[[Sight & Sound]]'', director [[Martin Scorsese]] described the qualities of Herrmann's famous score:\n\n<blockquote>Hitchcock's film is about obsession, which means that it's about circling back to the same moment, again and again&nbsp;... And the music is also built around spirals and circles, fulfilment and despair. Herrmann really understood what Hitchcock was going for&nbsp;\u2014 he wanted to penetrate to the heart of obsession.<ref name=\"ScorseseMusic\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Graphic design===\nGraphic designer [[Saul Bass]] used [[Lissajous curve|spiral]] motifs in both the title sequence and the movie poster, emphasizing what the documentary ''Obsessed with Vertigo'' calls, \"''Vertigo''{{'}}s psychological vortex\".<ref name=\"obsessed\" /> Bass's unconventional framing of actress Audrey Lowell's facial features in the first images of the titles was indebted to Bauhaus photography. According to her 1997 Guardian interview Kim Novak wanted to do the opening title sequence but Harry Cohn insisted Hitchcock pay full rate for the single day's shooting and so another face was chosen.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Horak|first=Jan-Christopher|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/892799673|title=Saul Bass : Anatomy of Film Design.|date=2014|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-4720-8|location=Lexington|oclc=892799673}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Vertigo'' premiered in San Francisco on May 9, 1958, at the Stage Door Theater at Mason and Geary (now the August Hall nightclub).{{sfn|Auiler|2000|p=174}} While ''Vertigo'' did break even upon its original release,{{sfn|Monaco|2010|p=153}}{{sfn|Lev|2006|pp=203\u2013204}} earning $3.2 million in North American distributor rentals<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/variety213-1959-01/page/n45/|title=Top Grossers of 1958|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 7, 1959|page=48|via=[[Internet Archive]]|access-date=September 30, 2020}}</ref> against its $2,479,000 cost, it earned significantly less than other Hitchcock productions.{{sfn|Auiler|2000|p=174}}\n\n===Restoration and re-release===\n[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer Stewart on a laddder.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Stewart]] as Johnny \"Scottie\" Ferguson in Midge's apartment, standing on a stepladder trying to overcome his acrophobia]]\n\nIn October 1983, ''[[Rear Window]]'' and ''Vertigo'' were the first two films [[reissue]]d by [[Universal Pictures]] after the studio acquired the rights from Hitchcock's estate.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wells|first=Jeffrey|date=May 9, 1993|title=The Plot to Restore 'Vertigo'|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-05-09-ca-33040-story.html|access-date=September 9, 2020}}</ref> These two films and three others&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956), ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955), and ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948)&nbsp;\u2013 had been kept out of distribution by Hitchcock since 1968. Cleaning and restoration were performed on each film when new 35&nbsp;mm prints were struck.\n\nIn 1996, the film was given a lengthy and controversial restoration by [[Robert A. Harris]] and [[James C. Katz]] and re-released to theaters. The new print featured restored color and newly created audio, using modern sound effects mixed in [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] digital surround sound. In October 1996, the restored ''Vertigo'' premiered at the [[Castro Theatre]] in San Francisco, with Kim Novak and [[Patricia Hitchcock]] in person. At this screening, the film was exhibited for the first time in DTS and [[70 mm film|70mm]], a format with a similar frame size to the [[VistaVision]] system in which it was originally shot.\n\nSignificant color correction was necessary because of the fading of original negatives. In some cases a new negative was created from the silver separation masters, but in many instances this was impossible because of differential separation shrinkage, and because the 1958 separations were poorly made. Separations used three individual films: one for each of the primary colors. In the case of ''Vertigo'', these had shrunk in different and erratic proportions, making re-alignment impossible.<ref name=\"obsessed\" />\n\nAs such, significant amounts of computer assisted coloration were necessary. Although the results are not noticeable on viewing the film, some elements were as many as eight generations away from the original negative, in particular the entire \"Judy's Apartment\" sequence, perhaps the most pivotal sequence in the entire film. When such large portions of re-creation become necessary, then the danger of artistic license by the restorers becomes an issue, and the restorers received some criticism for their re-creation of colors that allegedly did not honor the director's and cinematographer's intentions. The restoration team argued that they did research on the colors used in the original locations, cars, wardrobe, and skin tones. One breakthrough moment came when the [[Ford Motor Company]] supplied a well-preserved green paint sample for a car used in the film. As the use of the color green in the film has artistic importance, matching a shade of green was a stroke of luck for restoration and provided a reference shade.{{sfn|Auiler|2000|pp=190\u2013193}}\n\nWhen restoring the sound, Harris and Katz wanted to stay as close as possible to the original, and had access to the original music recordings that had been stored in the vaults at Paramount. However, as the project demanded a new [[DTS (sound system)|6-channel DTS stereo soundtrack]], it was necessary to re-record some sound effects using the [[Foley artist|Foley]] process.<ref name=\"obsessed\" /> The soundtrack was remixed at the Alfred Hitchcock Theatre at [[Universal Studios]]. Aware that the film had a considerable following, the restoration team knew that they were under particular pressure to restore the film as accurately as possible. To achieve this, they used Hitchcock's original dubbing notes for guidance of how the director wanted the film to sound in 1958.<ref name=\"obsessed\" /> Harris and Katz sometimes added extra sound effects to camouflage defects in the old soundtrack; i.e., \"hisses, pops, and bangs.\" In particular, they added extra seagull cries and a foghorn to the scene at [[the Lone Cypress|Cypress Point]].<ref>Katz, cited in {{harvnb|Auiler|2000|p=198}}</ref> The new mix has also been accused of putting too much emphasis on the score at the expense of the sound effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.universal-pictures-international-germany.de/vertigo/rest.html |title=Vertigo |website=Universal Pictures International (archived)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719111654/http://movies.universal-pictures-international-germany.de/vertigo/rest.html |archive-date=July 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nIn 1996, director Harrison Engle produced a documentary about the making of Hitchcock's classic, ''Obsessed with Vertigo''.

The film ranked 8th on [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'s [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's Annual Top 10 Lists|Top 10 Films of the Year List]] in 1959.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|title=Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951-2009|last=Johnson|first=Eric C.|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|language=en-US|access-date=December 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|archive-date=March 27, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, even [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s [[Hitchcock/Truffaut|important 1962 book of interviews with Hitchcock]] (not published in English until 1967) devotes only a few pages to ''Vertigo''. Dan Auiler has suggested that the real beginning of ''Vertigo''{{'}}s rise in adulation was the British-Canadian scholar [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]]'s ''Hitchcock's Films'' (1968), which calls the film \"Hitchcock's masterpiece to date and one of the four or five most profound and beautiful films the cinema has yet given us\".{{sfn|Auiler|2000|p=177}}\n\nAdding to its mystique was the fact that ''Vertigo'' was one of five Hitchcock-owned films removed from circulation in 1973. When ''Vertigo'' was re-released in theaters in October 1983, and then on home video in October 1984, it achieved an impressive commercial success and laudatory reviews.{{sfn|Auiler|2000|pp=190\u2013191}} Similarly adulatory reviews were written for the October 1996 showing of a restored print in [[70mm]] and [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] sound at the [[Castro Theater]] in San Francisco.{{sfn|Auiler|2000|p=191}} In his 1996 review of the film, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his [[Great Movies]] list.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Vertigo|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-vertigo-1958|website=Roger Ebert|date=October 13, 1996}}</ref>\n\nA small minority of critics have expressed dissenting opinions. In his 2004 book ''[[Blockbuster (2004 book)|Blockbuster]]'', British film critic [[Tom Shone]] suggested that ''Vertigo''{{'}}s critical re-evaluation has led to excessive praise, and argued for a more measured response. Faulting ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' for \"perennially\" putting the film on the list of best-ever films, he wrote, \"Hitchcock is a director who delights in getting his plot mechanisms buffed up to a nice humming shine, and so the ''Sight and Sound'' team praise the one film of his in which this is not the case&nbsp;\u2013 it's all loose ends and lopsided angles, its plumbing out on display for the critic to pick over at his leisure.\"{{sfn|Shone|2004|p=}}\n\nIn 1989, ''Vertigo'' was recognized as a \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\" film by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in the first year of the registry's voting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |website=Library of Congress|date=January 13, 1989|access-date=September 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, ''Vertigo'' came in second (to ''[[Goodfellas]]'') in British magazine ''[[Total Film]]''{{'s}} book ''100 Greatest Movies of All Time''.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Total Film]] |title=Who is the greatest? |date=October 24, 2005 |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/who-is-the-greatest |access-date=August 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123115358/http://www.totalfilm.com/news/who-is-the-greatest |archive-date=January 23, 2014 }}</ref> In 2008, an ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' poll of readers, actors, and critics named it the 40th greatest movie ever made.<ref>{{cite news|work=Empire Magazine|title=Empire's 500 Greatest Movies of All Time|date=January 1, 2014|url=https://www.empireonline.com/500/35.asp|access-date=January 1, 2014}}</ref> The film was Voted at No. 8 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'' in 2008.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmdetail.com/2008/11/23/cahiers-du-cinemas-100-greatest-films/|title=Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma's 100 Greatest Films|date=November 23, 2008}}</ref> In 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]''  ranked it as the 3rd-best crime film of all time.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gilbey, Ryan |date=October 17, 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/vertigo-hitchcock-crime|title=Vertigo: No 3 best crime film of all time|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=July 12, 2021}}</ref> ''Vertigo'' ranked 3rd in [[BBC]]'s 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest American Films|url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films|website=bbc|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 8.80/10.
