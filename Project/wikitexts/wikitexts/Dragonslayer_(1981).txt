It stars [[Peter MacNicol]], [[Ralph Richardson]], [[John Hallam]], and [[Caitlin Clarke]]. It is a co-production between [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]], where Paramount handled [[North America|North American]] distribution and Disney's [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista International]] handled international distribution. The story is set in a fictional [[Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom, where a young [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] experiences danger and opposition as he hunts the [[European dragon|dragon]], Vermithrax Pejorative.\n\nAfter ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980), it is the second joint production between Paramount and [[Disney]] and is more mature than most contemporary Disney films. Because the audience expected the Disney name to be solely children's entertainment, the film's violence, adult themes, and brief nudity were somewhat controversial though Disney did not hold the US distribution rights. The film was rated PG in the U.S.\n\nThe [[special effect]]s were created at [[Industrial Light and Magic]], the first use of ILM outside of a [[Lucasfilm]] production. [[Phil Tippett]] had co-developed an animation technique there for ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) called [[go motion]], a variation on [[stop motion]]. This led to the film's nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], but it lost to ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the only other Visual Effects nominee that year, whose special effects were also provided by ILM. Including the hydraulic {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} model, the dragon consists of 16 puppets dedicated to flying, crawling, or fire breathing.<ref>Ronan, Margaret (1981), [http://www.petermacnicolonline.com/vermithrax.html \"The Vermithrax Pejorative Story: Behind the Scenes at the Making of Dragonslayer\"], ''Weird Worlds''</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]], which went to ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''. It was nominated for a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], again given to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. On October 21, 2003, ''Dragonslayer'' was released on DVD in the U.S. by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]].\n\n== Plot ==\nUrland, a sixth-century [[End of Roman rule in Britain|post-Roman]] kingdom situated near the [[River Ure|River Ur]],<ref name=fingeroth>Fingeroth, Danny, 1981, The Making of Dragonslayer in Dragonslayer - The Official Marvel Comics Adaptation of the Spectacular Paramount/Disney Motion Picture!, Marvel Super Special, 1, 20, Marvel Comics Group, 1981</ref> is being terrorized by Vermithrax Pejorative, a 400-year-old [[dragon]].<ref name=fingeroth/> To appease the creature, King Casiodorus offers it [[virgin]] girls selected by lottery twice a year. An expedition led by a young man called Valerian seeks help from the last [[Wizard (fantasy)|sorcerer]], Ulrich of Cragganmore.\n\nThe expedition is followed by Tyrian, the brutal and cynical Captain of Casiodorus's Royal Guard. He and his lieutenant Jerbul openly intimidate the wizard, doubtful of his abilities. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian does so and Ulrich dies instantly, to the horror of his young [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] Galen Bradwarden and his elderly servant Hodge, who cremates Ulrich's body and places the ashes in a leather pouch. Hodge informs Galen that Ulrich wanted his ashes spread over a lake of burning water.\n\nGalen is selected by the wizard's magical amulet as its next owner; encouraged, he journeys to Urland. On the way, he discovers Valerian is a young woman, who is disguised to avoid being selected in the lottery. In an effort to discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge. Just before dying, he hands Galen the pouch of ashes.\n\nArriving in Urland, Galen inspects the dragon's lair and magically seals \u2013 he thinks \u2013 its entrance with a rock slide. Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to Castle Morgenthorme, from which King Casiodorus governs Urland. Casiodorus guesses that Galen is not a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered the dragon instead of killing it, as his brother and predecessor once did. The king confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter, Princess Elspeth, visits Galen and is shocked when he informs her of rumors that the lottery is rigged; it excludes her name and those who are rich enough to bribe the king into disqualifying their children. Her father is unable to lie convincingly when she confronts him over this.\n\nMeanwhile, the dragon frees itself from its prison and causes an earthquake. Galen narrowly escapes from his prison, but without the amulet. The village priest, Brother Jacopus, leads his congregation to confront the dragon, denouncing it as the [[Devil]], but the dragon incinerates him and then heads for the village of Swanscombe, burning all in its path.\n\nWhen the lottery begins anew, Elspeth rigs the draw so that only her name can be chosen. Consequently, King Casiodorus returns the amulet to Galen so that he might save Elspeth. Galen uses the amulet to enchant a heavy spear that had been forged by Valerian's father (which he had dubbed ''Sicarius Dracorum'', or \"Dragonslayer\") with the ability to pierce the dragon's armored hide. Valerian gathers some molted dragon scales to create a shield for Galen. Valerian laments now that her cross-dressing disguise is blown, she'll be eligible for the lottery since she is still a virgin, and that Galen has fallen in love with Princess Elspeth. Galen admits he has fallen in love, but it's Valerian, not Elspeth, he's in love with. The couple kisses, thus realizing their romantic feelings for each other.\n\nAttempting to rescue Elspeth, Galen fights Tyrian and kills him emerging victorious. The Princess, however, is determined to make amends for all the girls whose names have been chosen in the past; she descends into the dragon's cave and to her death. Galen follows her and finds a brood of young dragons feasting on her corpse. He kills them and finds Vermithrax resting by an underground lake of fire. He manages to wound the dragon, but the spear is broken. Only Valerian's shield saves him from incineration.\n\nAfter his failure to kill Vermithrax, Valerian convinces Galen to leave Swanscombe with her. As both prepare to depart, the amulet gives Galen a vision explaining his teacher's final wish to use Galen to deliver him to Urland. Ulrich had asked that his ashes be spread over \"burning water\", which is in the dragon's cave. Galen realizes that the wizard had planned his own death and cremation, realizing he was too old and frail to make the journey.\n\nGalen returns to the cave. When he spreads the ashes over the fiery lake, the wizard is resurrected within the flames. Ulrich reveals that his time is short and that Galen must destroy the amulet \"when the time is right\". The wizard then transports himself to a mountaintop, where he summons a storm and confronts Vermithrax. After a brief battle, the monster snatches the old man and flies away with him. Cued by Ulrich, Galen crushes the amulet with a rock. The wizard's body explodes and kills the dragon, whose corpse falls out of the sky.\n\nIn the aftermath, villagers inspecting the wreckage credit God with the victory. The king arrives and drives a sword into the dragon's broken carcass to claim the glory for himself. As Galen and Valerian leave Urland together, he confesses that he misses both Ulrich and the amulet. He says, \"I just wish we had a horse.\" Suddenly, a white horse appears, insinuating that the power of the amulet is now within Galen himself. The couple mounts the horse and rides away.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Galen Bradwarden\n* [[Caitlin Clarke]] as Valerian\n* [[Ralph Richardson]] as Ulrich of Cragganmore\n* [[John Hallam]] as Tyrian\n* [[Peter Eyre]] as King Casiodorus\n* [[Albert Salmi]] as Greil (dubbed by [[Norman Rodway]])\n* [[Sydney Bromley]] as Hodge\n* [[Chloe Salaman]] as Princess Elspeth\n* [[Emrys James]] as Simon (Valerian's Father)\n* Roger Kemp as Horsrick, Casiodorus's Chamberlain\n* [[Ian McDiarmid]] as Brother Jacopus\n{{col div end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception ===\nAccording to [[Hal Barwood]], he and [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]] got the inspiration for ''Dragonslayer'' from ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)#Fantasia|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', and later came up with a story after researching [[St. George and the Dragon]]. Barwood and Robbins rejected the traditional conceptions of the medieval world in order to give the film more realism: \"our film has no knights in shining armor, no pennants streaming in the breeze, no delicate ladies with diaphonous veils waving from turreted castles, no courtly love, no holy grail. Instead we set out to create a very strange world with a lot of weird values and customs, steeped in superstition, where the clothes and manners of the people were rough, their homes and villages primitive and their countryside almost primeval, so that the idea of magic would be a natural part of their existence.\" For this reason, they chose to set the film after the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], prior to the arrival of Christianity. Barwood and Robins began to hastily work on the story outline on June 25, 1979 and completed in early August. They received numerous refusals from various film studios, due to their inexperience in budget negotiations. The screenplay was eventually accepted by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]], becoming the two studios' second joint effort after ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980).<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\n=== Dragon ===\n[[File:Rhamphorchynchus white background.jpg|thumb|According to Barwood, the dragon's basic body plan was based on that of the [[Jurassic]] [[pterosaur]] ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]''<ref name=legacy>[https://monsterlegacy.net/2013/04/14/vermithrax-pejorative-dragonslayer/comment-page-1/ Vermithrax Pejorative], ''Monster Legacy'' (April 14, 2013)</ref>]]\nTwenty-five percent of the film's budget went into the dragon's special effects. Graphic artist David Bunnett was assigned to design the look, and was fed ideas on the movement mechanics, and then rendered the concepts on paper. It was decided early to emphasize flying, because the most important sequence is the final battle. Bunnett gave it a degree of personality, deliberately trying to avoid the [[Alien (Alien franchise)|creature]] from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', which he believed was \"too hideous to look at\".<ref name=fingeroth/>\n[[File:Dragonslayervermithraxp.jpg|thumb|[[Ken Ralston]]'s flying model of the dragon, Vermithrax Pejorative]]\nAfter Bunnett handed his storyboard panels to the film crew, the dragon design used a wide variety of techniques. The final creature is a composite of several different models. [[Phil Tippett]] of [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]] finalized the design, and sculpted a reference model which [[Danny Lee (special effects artist)|Danny Lee]] of Disney Studios closely followed in constructing the larger dragon props for closeup shots. Two months later, Lee's team finished a sixteen-foot head and neck assembly, a twenty-foot tail, thighs, legs, claws capable of grabbing a man, and a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} wing section. The parts were flown to [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London in the cargo hold of a [[Boeing 747]].<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\n[[Brian Johnson (special effects)|Brian Johnson]] was hired to supervise the special effects, and began planning on- and off-set effects with various specialists. [[Dennis Muren]], the effects cameraman, stated, \"We knew the dragon had a lot more importance to this film than some of the incidental things that appeared in only a few shots in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' or ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The dragon had to be presented in a way that the audience would be absolutely stunned.\"<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\nAfter the completion of principal shooting, a special effects team of eighty people at ILM studios in northern California worked eight months in producing 160 composite shots of the dragon. [[Chris Walas]] sculpted and operated the dragon head used for close-up shots. The head measured eight feet in length. The model was animated by a combination of radio controls, cable controls, air bladders, levers, and by hand{{mdash}}thus giving the illusion of a fully coordinated face with a wide range of expression.<ref name=fingeroth/> Real World War II era flamethrowers were used for the dragon's fire breathing effects. The animals used for the dragon's vocalizations included lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, alligators, pigs, camels, and elephants.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}\n\nPhil Tippett built a model for the dragon's walking scenes. He did not want to use standard [[stop motion animation]] techniques, and had his team build a dragon model which would move during each exposure, rather than in between, as was once the standard. This process, named \"go motion\" by Tippett, recorded the creature's movements in motion as a real animal would move, and removed the jerkiness common in prior stop motion films.<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\n[[Ken Ralston]] was assigned to the flying scenes. He built a model with an articulated aluminum skeleton for a wide range of motion. Ralston shot films of birds flying in order to incorporate their movements into the model. As with the walking dragon, the flying model was filmed using go-motion techniques. The camera was programmed to tilt and move at various angles in order to convey the sensation of flight.<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\n=== Casting ===\nPeter MacNicol first met Robbins in the office of casting director, Debby Brown, who'd seen MacNicol's work as Benvolio in Romeo and Juliet at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. She'd left a note backstage for him, encouraging him to move to New York saying \"he would do well there\". He took her advice. On his first day in New York MacNicol stopped by Brown's office to tell her he was now a Manhattan resident. While there, he heard the loud voices of actors coming from Brown's audition room. He asked Brown if there was anything right for him in the project. She responded with a smile, \"Well...actually, there is.\" An hour later, MacNicol was the front runner for the role of Galen. He was flown to England along with Caitlin Clarke for a screen test. Within a day or two, Paramount and Disney had said yes and he was renting a flat in Chelsea. MacNicol had grown up riding horses\u2014his first paid job was on a ranch near Arlington, Texas\u2014so the young actor knew how to ride, even jump hurdles without a saddle but during his pre-filming he needed to learn to ride the type of trooper-style saddle they were using in the movie. And because he'd have to ride on camera during action sequences his riding skills had to be stress-tested.  \"They took away my stirrups, they took away my reins and whipped the horse, and then they told me to windmill my arms and turn a complete circle in the saddle. Then they took away the saddle!\" The young actor had already worked for two years in classical repertory theater, and was highly trained in voice production. Nevertheless a voice coach was hired to achieve the mid-Atlantic sound the role required. Having studied stage combat at the University of Minnesota (two years of classes in tumbling, foil, saber rapier and dagger) he was eager to do as much of the fighting as they'd allow. The role also required some juggling and magic tricks. For this he was mentored by British prestidigitator Harold Taylor, who had previously performed for the [[British royal family]].<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\n[[Caitlin Clarke]] was initially hesitant to involve herself in the film, as she was preparing to audition for a play in Chicago. Her agent insisted, though, and after doing an audition tape, was called back for more tests. Clarke failed them, but managed to pass after doing another test at Robbins's insistence. She got along well with [[Ralph Richardson]], and stated that he taught her more in one rehearsal than she had learned in years of acting classes.<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\n=== Set design ===\n[[File:ulrich-castle-ball-siabod-small.jpg|thumb|right|Ulrich's Castle looking over to [[Moel Siabod]], [[Dolwyddelan Castle]], [[North Wales]]]]\n[[Elliot Scott]] was hired to design the sets of the film's sixth-century world. He temporarily converted the 13th-century [[Dolwyddelan Castle]] into Ulrich's ramshackle sixth-century fortress, to the surprise of the locals. He built the entire village of Swanscombe on a farmside outside London. Although Scott extensively researched medieval architecture in the [[British Museum]] and his own library, he took some artistic liberties in creating the thatched roof houses, the granary, Simon's house, and smithy and Casiodorus's castle, because he was unable to find enough information on their exact look. He built the interior of the dragon's lair, using {{convert|25000|cuft|m3}} of polystyrene and 40 tons of Welsh slate and shale. The shots of the Welsh and Scottish landscapes were extended through the use of over three dozen [[matte paintings]].<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\nNearly all of the outdoor scenes were shot in [[North Wales]]. The final scene was shot in [[Skye]], Scotland.\n\n[[File:galen-hodge-opposite-over-llygwy-bryn-llys.jpg|thumb|Galen (Peter MacNicol) and Hodge (Sydney Bromley) rehearsing for the pack levitation scene.

They are roughly stitched and use colors which would have been possible with the vegetable dyes of the time. The costumes of Casiodorus and his court were designed of fine silk, as opposed to the coarsely woven clothes of the Urlanders.<ref name=fingeroth/>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe film's Academy Award-nominated score was composed by [[Alex North]]. The score's linear conception was developed through transparently layered, polyphonic orchestral texture dominated by a medieval-style modal harmony. The score was largely based on five major thematic concepts:\n# the suffering of the Urlanders; \n# a \"magic\" motif;  \n# the amulet;  \n# the sacrificial virgins;  \n# the relationship between Galen and Valerian.\n\nNorth had six weeks to compose the score,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://runmovies.eu/?p=3446 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130911182507/http://www.runmovies.eu/?p=3446 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-09-11 |last=Henderson |first=Kirk |title=Alex North's 2001 and Beyond |periodical=Soundtrack Magazine |volume=13 |issue=49 |year=1994 }}</ref> which featured music rejected from his score for Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey''.

He later stated that he had written \"a very lovely waltz for when the dragon first appears, with just a slight indication that this may not be a bad dragon\". The waltz was scrapped in favor of tracks used earlier in the movie.\n\nThe score was widely praised. Pauline Kael wrote in the ''New Yorker'' that the score was a \"beauty\", and that \"at times, the music and the fiery dragon seem one\". Royal S. Brown of ''Fanfare Magazine'' praised the soundtrack as \"one of the best scores of 1981\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Shoilevska, Sanya |author2=Williams, John |year=2003 |title=Alex North, film composer |quote=A biography, with musical analyses of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'', ''[[Under the Volcano (1984 film)|Under the Volcano]]'', and ''[[Prizzi's Honor]]''. |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0786414707 }}</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2010, a limited edition soundtrack CD was released on La-La Land Records.<ref>{{cite web |title=DRAGONSLAYER: 40th ANNIVERSARY LIMITED EDITION |work=La-La Land Records |url=https://lalalandrecords.com/dragonslayer-40th-anniversary-limited-edition/ |access-date=August 10, 2021}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\nThe film grossed just over $14 million in the US<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1229882881/weekend/ Dragonslayer (1981)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with an estimated budget of $18 million.

The picture was included in the book ''Star Wars: Chronicles''. A creature based on the appearance of this dragon appears in one of [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s creature pens in ''Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\n== Related media ==\n=== Novelization ===\nA novelization ''[[Dragonslayer (novel)|Dragonslayer]]'' was written by [[Wayland Drew]] that delves deeper into the background of many of the characters. Expansions upon the film's plot include details such as these:\n\n* Galen has (or at least had) an elder sister named Apulia.\n* As an infant, Galen was handed to Ulrich by his parents due to their fear of his magical abilities. Ulrich took him as an apprentice, but was concerned with the lad's lack of focus, which usually resulted in the unintentional creation of bizarre, dream-inspired creatures.\n* The other Sorcerers of Cragganmore are mentioned; Ulrich was the apprentice of Belisarius, who was the apprentice of Pleximus. \n* A vision glimpsed by Ulrich in his [[scrying]] bowl implies that sorcerers could have been responsible for the creation of dragons, and that whoever this sorcerer was, he had far more power than Ulrich. This is only briefly alluded to in the film. It is further mentioned that the sorcerer who created dragons also fashioned the magical amulet which Galen wears through most of the story.\n* Urland's neighbor-kingdoms of Anwick, Cantware, and Heronsford are mentioned.\n* The revelation that Vermithrax, while physically androgynous, nevertheless required copulation with another dragon for fertilization.\n* Swanscombe's neighbor-villages of Nudd, Turnratchit, and Veryemere are mentioned.  \n* It is revealed that the lottery's standards for eligibility fluctuated, and several married women and mothers were sacrificed too, Valerian's mother being among them. Her death was the price Simon had to pay in order to fashion Sicarius Dracorum, which was done with the assistance of Ulrich himself.\n* Two major rivers besides Ur are mentioned: Swanscombe and Varn.\n* Simon is revealed to be a master blacksmith who fashioned highly prized weapons and armor. It was the toll of seeing so many use his arms and armor only to be killed by the dragon that convinced him to stop forging arms and armor.\n* King Casiodorus is revealed to be of Roman heritage, and is portrayed as contemptuous toward his largely [[Saxon]] subjects, whom he views as superstitious and backward.\n* Ulrich is revealed to have extensive research and history of dragons. When he reviews his library to determine which dragon it is that is terrorizing Urland, he discovers (to his horror) that it is Vermithrax, unlike the movie which has him knowing all along.\n* When Ulrich is asking about other wizards which might still be alive to assist Valerian, he mentions Prospero, from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\". Valerian gives a (brief) update of Prospero's fate which corresponds to the Shakespearean storyline.\n\n=== Marvel Comics adaptation ===\n[[Marvel Comics]] published three formats of Dragonslayer adaptations in 1981. All were by the same team. These were a magazine-size issue, a two-issue standard comic size adaptation, and a paperback format (Marvel Illustrated) of the two comic books in 160 pages, due to the smaller pages.Writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artists [[Marie Severin]] and [[John Tartaglione]] in ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #20.<ref>{{Gcdb issue|id= 34994|title= ''Marvel Super Special'' #20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Friedt|first= Stephan|title= Marvel at the Movies: The House of Ideas' Hollywood Adaptations of the 1970s and 1980s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 89|page= 65|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= July 2016|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>\n\n=== SPI board game ===\n[[Simulations Publications|Simulations Publications, Inc.]] produced the board game [[Dragonslayer (board game)|of the same name]], designed by Brad Hessel and Redmond A.

That album appeared on [[iTunes]] for a limited time. The first official and improved CD release came in 2010 by U.S. label La-La Land Records. The new album featured newly mastered audio from the original LCR (Left-Center-Right)-mix and included previously unreleased source music and alternative takes.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of films featuring eclipses]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0082288}}\n* {{mojo title|id=dragonslayer|title=Dragonslayer}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=dragonslayer}}\n\n{{portal bar|1980s}}\n{{Matthew Robbins}}\n\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Films about dragons]]\n[[Category:Films about wizards]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Matthew Robbins]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alex North]]\n[[Category:Films set in castles]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 6th century]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films using stop-motion animation]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Robbins]]\n[[Category:American sword and sorcery films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
