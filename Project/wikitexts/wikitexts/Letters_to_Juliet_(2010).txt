This was the final film of director [[Gary Winick]] before his death on February 27, 2011. The film was released theatrically in North America and other countries on May 14, 2010. The idea for the film was inspired by the 2006 non-fiction [[Juliet#Club di Giulietta|book]] ''Letters to Juliet'', by Lise Friedman and Ceil Friedman, which chronicles the phenomenon of letter-writing to Shakespeare's most famous romantic protagonist.\n\n== Plot ==\nSophie is a young American woman who works for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as a [[fact checker]]. She goes on a pre-honeymoon with her chef fianc\u00e9 Victor to [[Verona]], [[Italy]]. Victor is unmoved by the romance of Italy and uses his time to research for his soon-to-open restaurant, often neglecting Sophie. Sophie discovers that thousands of banal \"letters to Juliet\" left in [[Juliet]]'s Verona courtyard are typically answered by the \"[[Juliet Club|Secretaries of Juliet]]\". Sophie asks to join them and accidentally finds an unanswered letter by a Claire Smith from 1957. She answers it and within a week the now-elderly Claire arrives in Verona with her handsome [[barrister]] grandson Charlie Wyman. Claire and Sophie take an instant liking to each other, but Charlie and Sophie do not get along.\n\nFollowing the advice in Sophie's reply, Claire decides to look for her long-lost love, Lorenzo Bartolini. Sophie, thinking Claire's story might help her with her writing career and has genuine interest in the story, helps Claire. The two find out that there are seventy-four Lorenzo Bartolinis living in the area. After many days of searching for the right Lorenzo, they find that one is dead. Charlie blames Sophie for his grandmother's sadness. He accuses her of not knowing what real loss is. Claire, witnessing the dispute, tells Charlie that he was wrong and that Sophie's mother had walked away from her when she was a little girl.\n\nThe following day, Claire insists that Charlie apologize to Sophie at breakfast, which he does. After dinner, Sophie talks to Charlie about love, still believing Claire's Lorenzo is still alive, and the two kiss. The following morning is their last day of searching for Lorenzo. On a whim, Claire points out a vineyard to Charlie and asks if he could stop so they can have a farewell drink for Sophie. As Charlie drives down the road, Claire sees a young man who looks exactly like her Lorenzo. They discover the young man is [[deus ex machina|Lorenzo Bartolini's grandson]], and Claire and the elder Lorenzo reunite. When Sophie heads back to Verona, Claire pushes Charlie to pursue her, but he backs off when he sees Sophie with Victor.\n\nBack in [[New York City|New York]], exhausted by the differences and lack of passion in their relationship, Sophie breaks up with Victor before returning to Verona to [[gatecrashing|attend]] Claire and Lorenzo's wedding. She finds Charlie with another woman, and runs out crying. Charlie comes out to find her, and she admits she loves him but tells him to go back to his girlfriend. Charlie reveals that the woman is his cousin and tells Sophie he loves her. He climbs up the vine to the balcony, recreating the famous scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', but accidentally falls down, and they kiss as he lies on the ground. It is unknown if he was injured from his fall.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Sophie Hall, a fact checker living in New York\n* [[Christopher Egan]] as Charlie Wyman, Claire's grandson, who has trouble coming to terms with his grandmother loving anyone other than his late grandfather.
