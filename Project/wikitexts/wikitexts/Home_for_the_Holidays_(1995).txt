The screenplay was written by [[W. D. Richter]], based on a short story by Chris Radant. The film's score was composed by [[Mark Isham]]. The film follows Claudia Larson, who after losing her job, kissing her ex-boss, and finding out that her daughter has plans of her own for the holidays, departs Chicago to spend her [[Thanksgiving]] with her [[dysfunctional family]].\n\nThe film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Holly Hunter]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Anne Bancroft]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Dylan McDermott]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Cynthia Stevenson]], [[Claire Danes]], [[Austin Pendleton]], and [[David Strathairn]].\n\n''Home for the Holidays'' was released theatrically on November 3, 1995, by [[Paramount Pictures]] in North America and by [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics who appreciated Foster's direction, and Hunter's and Downey's performances but criticised the screenplay. The film grossed $22.1 million against a budget of $20 million.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=June 2021}}\nClaudia Larson is a single mother who has just been fired from her job as an art restorer due to budget cuts. She flies from [[Chicago]] to spend [[Thanksgiving]] at the [[Baltimore]] home of her parents, Adele and Henry Larson, while her only child Kitt decides to stay home and spend the holiday with her boyfriend. As she is dropping her mother off at the airport, Kitt informs Claudia that she intends to have sex with her boyfriend for the first time while she's gone. While on the plane, Claudia makes a phone call to Tommy, her younger brother and confidant, who she believes won't be attending the Thanksgiving dinner, telling him that she lost her job, made out with her boss, and knows that her daughter is going to have sex with her boyfriend.\n\nWhen Claudia arrives at the airport, she is greeted by her parents, who drive her to their home and help her unpack. Claudia remarks that she's thinking of looking into new careers. Adele concludes that Claudia lost her job, which she initially denies. That night, Tommy arrives with his friend Leo Fish, whom Claudia believes to be his boyfriend. Claudia is glad to see her brother but fears that he and Jack, his boyfriend, have broken up.\n\nThe next day, more family members arrive, including their eccentric Aunt Glady (Adele's sister), who once was a very bright Latin teacher but now shows signs of dementia. While returning home after picking up groceries, Claudia runs into a girl she used to go to school with. As Claudia feels diminished by talk of her divorce, Leo comes to her aid. The next family member to arrive is Claudia's resentful, conservative sister, Joanne Wedman, who is accompanied by her stuffy banker husband Walter and their two spoiled children.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, a series of mishaps occur. Aunt Glady professes her love for Henry, and Tommy accidentally drops the turkey all over Joanne and goes too far with his jokes. Joanne reveals to everyone that Tommy had married Jack in a beach wedding several months ago. Their parents are hurt that they weren't told, and Adele retreats to a hidden pantry by the kitchen, where Claudia attempts to console her.\n\nAfter the meal, Kitt calls Claudia to say that she's fine and has decided not to have sex with her boyfriend. Tommy, Leo, Walter, and Walter Jr. play football while Henry washes everybody's cars. When Walter gets frustrated by Tommy and Leo bending the rules, he spikes the ball on Tommy's classic [[Pontiac GTO|GTO]] causing the brothers-in-law to fight. Walter wrestles Tommy onto the ground and threatens him. Tommy accidentally punches Leo who's trying to break them up. Henry sprays his son and son-in-law with the hose, and the Wedmans jump into the car and leave.\n\nThe family returns inside, where they talk for a while. The phone rings a second time, and Henry answers; it turns out to be Jack calling. Before handing the phone over to Tommy, Henry says that he's happy for both of them.\n\nAdele insists that Claudia and Leo drive Aunt Glady home, then deliver leftovers to Joanne's family. On the drive from Glady\u2019s home to the Wedmans\u2019, Leo tells Claudia that Tommy showed him a picture of her, and he came to Thanksgiving to meet her. They end up kissing on the Wedmans\u2019 front porch.\n\nClaudia goes down to the Wedmans' basement where Joanne is exercising, to talk to her. Joanne says, \"If I just met you on the street...if you gave me your phone number, I\u2019d throw it away.\" Claudia responds, \"We don\u2019t have to like each other, we're family\".\n \nArriving back at Claudia\u2019s parents\u2019 home, Leo and Claudia talk and begin to make out in the living room, but Tommy, who is sleeping on the floor, wakes up and reminds Leo that they have to get an early start in the morning. Claudia retreats upstairs to her room; Leo follows her but fails in persuading her to let him in.\n\nEarly the next morning, Claudia wakes up and sees Tommy and Leo driving away. She goes downstairs and reminisces with her father for a while, before being taken to the airport and boarding her plane. Before the plane takes off, Leo gets in the seat next to her, and they fly back to Chicago together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Claudia Larson\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Tommy Larson\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as Adele Larson\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Kitt Larson\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Henry Larson\n* [[Dylan McDermott]] as Leo Fish\n* [[Austin Pendleton]] as Peter Arnold\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Aunt Glady\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Walter Wedman\n* [[Cynthia Stevenson]] as Joanne Larson Wedman\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Russell Terziak\n* [[Emily Ann Lloyd]] as Brittany Lace Wedman \n* Zach Duhame as Walter Wedman, Jr.\n* [[Amy Yasbeck]] as Ginny Johnson Drewer\n* [[Celeste Lecesne]]<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Credited as James Lecesne</ref> as Ron Drewer\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Woman on Airplane\n* [[Randy Stone]] as Man in Car\n* [[Sam Slovick]] as Jack\n* [[Shawn Hatosy]] as Counter Boy\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Jodie Foster 1995.jpg|thumb|left|Foster during the filming]]\nScreenwriter W.
