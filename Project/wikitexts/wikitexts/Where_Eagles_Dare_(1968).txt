Hutton]] and starring [[Richard Burton]], [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Mary Ure]]. It follows a joint British-American [[Special Operations Executive]] team of paratroopers raiding a castle (shot on location in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]]). It was filmed in [[Panavision]] using the [[Metrocolor]] process, and was distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. [[Alistair MacLean]] wrote the screenplay, his first, at the same time that he wrote the novel of the same name. Both became commercial successes.\n\nThe film involved some of the top filmmakers of the day and is considered a classic.<ref name = \"TCM\"/> Hollywood [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] [[Yakima Canutt]] was the [[second unit]] director and shot most of the action scenes; British stuntman [[Alf Joint]] doubled for Burton in many sequences, including the fight on top of the cable car; [[Ivor Novello Awards|award-winning]] conductor and composer [[Ron Goodwin]] wrote the [[film score]]; and future [[Academy Awards|Oscar-nominee]] [[Arthur Ibbetson]] worked on the [[cinematography]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn the winter of 1943\u201344, [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier General]] George Carnaby, a chief planner for the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], is captured by the Germans. He is taken for interrogation to ''Schlo\u00df Adler'', a mountaintop fortress accessible only by [[aerial tramway|cable car]]. A team of seven Allied [[Special Operations Executive]] [[commando]]s, led by British Major John Smith of the [[Grenadier Guards]] and [[U.S. Army Ranger]] Lieutenant Morris Schaffer, is briefed by Colonel Turner and Vice Admiral Rolland of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. Disguised as ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' mountain troops, they are to parachute into the [[Bavarian Alps|German Alps]], enter the castle, and rescue Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him. After their [[Ju 52|transport plane]] drops them off, Smith secretly meets with agent Mary Ellison, with whom he is in a relationship, and his contact Heidi Schmidt. Heidi has arranged for Mary, posing as her cousin Maria, to work temporarily at the castle so the commandos can gain access.\n\nAlthough two of the team are mysteriously killed, Smith continues the operation, keeping Schaffer as a close ally and secretly updating Rolland and Turner by radio. He reveals that Carnaby is actually an American corporal named Cartwright Jones, an ex-actor and lookalike of Carnaby trained to impersonate him. The Germans, tipped off to the operation, eventually surround the commandos in a ''[[gasthaus]]'' and force them to surrender. The officers, Smith and Schaffer, are separated from the rest of the team, Thomas, Berkeley, and Christiansen. Smith and Schaffer kill their captors, blow up a [[supply depot]], and prepare an escape route. They reach the castle by riding on the roof of a cable car and climb inside using a rope lowered by Mary.\n\nGerman [[General der Gebirgstruppe]] Rosemeyer and [[SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer]] Kramer are interrogating Carnaby when the three operative/prisoners, who claim to be double agents working for the Germans, arrive. Shortly thereafter, Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn, but Smith forces Schaffer to drop his weapon. He identifies himself as [[SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] Johann Schmidt of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]], the SS intelligence branch and shows Kramer the name of Germany's top agent in Britain. Kramer silently affirms it and calls a high-ranking officer on [[Albert Kesselring|Kesselring]]'s staff who confirms that Smith is indeed Schmidt. To ensure the three agents are who they say they are, Schmidt proposes that they write down the names of their fellow agents in Britain, to be compared to the list he has in his pocket. After the three finish their lists, Schmidt reveals that he was bluffing; he is in fact a double agent for the Allies and that obtaining the list of agents was the mission's true objective.\n\nMary is visited by [[SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] von Hapen, a highly decorated [[Waffen-SS]] officer who is convalescing whilst on [[secondment]] to the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] and the [[Gestapo]] in Southern Bavaria. He is attracted to her but becomes suspicious of flaws in her cover story, and stumbles upon Carnaby's interrogation just as Smith finishes his explanation. Smith keeps him occupied long enough for Mary to arrive and distract him. Schaffer seizes the opportunity to kill von Hapen and the other German officers with his [[Silencer (firearm)|silenced pistol]]. The group then makes their escape with Jones and the German agents. Schaffer sets a series of explosives to create diversions around the castle while Smith leads the group to the radio room, where he informs Rolland of their success and asks for a transport plane home. During the escape, Thomas is sacrificed as a decoy, and Berkeley and Christiansen both attempt to escape before Smith kills them. The team reunites with Heidi on the ground, boarding a red post bus they had prepared earlier. They battle their way onto a nearby airfield and take off in their transport plane, where Turner welcomes them.\n\nAs Turner debriefs Smith about the mission, Smith reveals that Kramer named Turner as Germany's top agent in Britain. Rolland lured Turner and the others into participating in the fake mission so that MI6 could expose them; Smith's trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer, who had no connection to MI6, had been assigned to the mission to ensure its success. Turner aims a [[Sten gun]] at Smith, who reveals that Rolland had the gun's firing pin removed earlier. He permits Turner to jump out of the plane to his death to avoid being tried for treason and executed. An exhausted Schaffer asks Smith to keep his next mission \"an all-British operation\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Clint Eastwood Ingrid Pitt Where Eagles Dare.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Clint Eastwood]] as [[U.S. Army Ranger]] officer, with [[Ingrid Pitt]], as British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] spy]] -->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Richard Burton]] as [[Major (United Kingdom)|Maj.]] John Smith / [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer|Maj.]] Johann Schmidt\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Lieutenant (United States)|Lt.]] Morris Schaffer\n* [[Mary Ure]] as Mary Ellison\n* [[Patrick Wymark]] as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Col.]] Wyatt Turner\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice Admiral]] Rolland\n* [[Donald Houston]] as [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Capt.]] Olaf Christiansen\n* [[Peter Barkworth]] as Capt.

One scene during the escape from the castle where Smith saves a German guard from burning to death presaged the non-lethal thriller vein that MacLean would explore in his later career. In the novel the characters are more clearly defined and slightly more humorous than their depictions in the film, which is fast-paced and has sombre performances from Burton and Eastwood at its centre. Three characters are differently named in the novel: Ted Berkeley is called Edward Carraciola, Jock MacPherson is called Torrance-Smythe, and Major von Hapen is instead Captain von Brauchitsch. The love stories between Schaffer and Heidi and between Smith and Mary were also cut.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 | title = I capture the castle | newspaper = The Guardian | access-date = 20 April 2019 | archive-date = 9 April 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190409015625/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 | url-status = live }}</ref> Indeed, in the novel Smith asks London to arrange for a priest to meet them at the airport.\n\nIn the book the group is flown into Germany on board an RAF [[Avro Lancaster]], whereas in the film they are transported in a ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[Junkers Ju 52]]. While in the film Kramer, Rosemeyer, and Von Hapen are shot dead by Schaffer and Smith, in the novel they are just given high doses of [[nembutal]]. In the book Thomas, Carraciola, and Christiansen attempt to escape in the cable car with Smith on the roof. Carraciola is crushed by the steel suspension arm of the cable car while struggling with Smith on the roof; Thomas and Christiansen fall to their deaths after Smith blows the cable car up with plastic explosive. In the film Christiansen is killed and Berkeley (Carraciola in the novel) incapacitated by Smith on the cable car (he dies apparently when the cable car explodes), and Thomas is shot and killed by a German soldier while climbing down a rope.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://warmoviebuff.blogspot.com/2015/07/bookmovie-where-eagles-dare-19671968.html?m=1|title=The War Movie Buff: BOOK/MOVIE: Where Eagles Dare (1967/1968)|date=29 July 2015|access-date=21 October 2018|archive-date=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021151256/https://warmoviebuff.blogspot.com/2015/07/bookmovie-where-eagles-dare-19671968.html?m=1|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1979, cult punk act [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]] released a single featuring a [[Where Eagles Dare (Misfits song)|song]] named after the film.\n\nThe British [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]] recorded a song called \"Where Eagles Dare\" on their 1983 album ''[[Piece of Mind]]''.
