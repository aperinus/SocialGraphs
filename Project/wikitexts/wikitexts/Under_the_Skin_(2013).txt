It stars [[Scarlett Johansson]] as an otherworldly woman who [[Predation|preys]] on men in Scotland. The film premiered at [[Telluride Film Festival]] on 29 August 2013. It was released in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2014, North America on 4 April 2014, Switzerland on 23 July 2014, and worldwide on 10 August 2014.\n\nGlazer developed ''Under the Skin'' for over a decade; he and co-screenwriter Walter Campbell pared it back from an elaborate, special effects-heavy concept to a sparse story focusing on an alien perspective on the human world. Most of the cast was chosen from applicants without previous acting experience, and many scenes were filmed with [[hidden camera]]s.\n\n''Under the Skin'' received acclaim for Johansson's performance, Glazer's direction, and [[Micachu|Mica Levi]]'s score. It received [[List of accolades received by Under the Skin|numerous accolades and awards]]; it was named the best film of the year by various critics and publications, was included in many best-of-the-decade lists, and was ranked 61st on the [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]] list. Despite its critical success, it was a [[box-office failure]], grossing around $7 million USD on a budget of $13.3 million.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, film summaries must be between 400 and 700  words. Please don't add unnecessary detail. -->\nIn [[Glasgow]], a motorcyclist retrieves an inert young woman from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman dons her clothes. After buying clothes and make-up at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van from town to town, picking up men. She lures a man into a dilapidated house. As he undresses, following the woman into a void, he is submerged in a liquid abyss.\n\nAt a beach, the woman attempts to pick up a swimmer, but is interrupted by the cries of a drowning couple attempting to rescue their dog, as it is pulled out to sea. The swimmer rescues the husband, but the husband rushes back into the water to save his wife and both drown. As the swimmer lies exhausted on the beach, the woman strikes his head with a rock, drags him to the van, and drives away, ignoring the couple's distraught baby. Later that night, the motorcyclist retrieves the swimmer's belongings, ignoring the baby, who is still on the beach.\n\nThe woman visits a nightclub and picks up another man. At the house, he follows her into the void and is submerged in the liquid. Suspended beneath the surface, he sees the swimmer floating naked beside him, alive but bloated and almost immobile. When he reaches to touch him, the swimmer's body collapses and a red mass empties through a trough.\n\nThe next day, the woman receives a rose from a street vendor, purchased from another man in traffic. She listens to a radio report about the missing family from the beach. The woman enters a dark room and is examined by the motorcyclist. She seduces a lonely man with facial tumours but lets him leave after examining herself in a mirror. The motorcyclist intercepts the man and bundles him into a car, then sets out in pursuit of the woman with three other motorcyclists.\n\nIn the [[Scottish Highlands]], the woman abandons the van in the fog. She walks to a restaurant and attempts to eat cake, but retches and spits it out. In a bus, she meets a man who offers to help her. At his house, he prepares a meal for her and they watch television. Alone in her room, she examines her body in a mirror. They visit a ruined castle, where the man carries her over a puddle and helps her down some steps. At his house, they kiss and begin to have sex, but the woman stops and examines her genitals.\n\nWandering in a forest, the woman meets a commercial logger and shelters in a [[bothy]]. She wakes up to find the logger molesting her. She runs into the wilderness but he catches and attempts to rape her; he tears her skin, revealing a black, featureless body. As the woman extricates herself from her skin, the man douses her in fuel and burns her alive. Elsewhere, the motorcyclist stands on a mountaintop and looks out across a snowy field.\n\n== Themes ==\nWriting for the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'', Duane Dudek speculated that Johansson's character assumes a human identity to collect information about humans as an alien intelligence might, inducing an identity crisis causing her to \"spin out of control like a broken machine\". He wrote that the motorcyclist can be interpreted as a companion, enabler, or pursuer, and that the \"tar-dark world\" where the woman submerges her victims may be a nest, a web, another planet or dimension, or a visual representation of how sex feels to her or them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/movies/under-the-skin-with-scarlett-johansson-confounding-captivating-b99269582z1-259400161.html|title='Under the Skin,' with Scarlett Johansson, confounding, captivating|last=Dudek|first=Duane|date=15 May 2014|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=29 July 2015}}</ref> In the ''Guardian'', Leo Robson wrote that ''Under the Skin'' deals with race and immigration.
