The love story subplot between Lovesix and Irina was not featured in the original story. Brutus, portrayed here as a comical villain with no relation to his depictions in ''Asterix'' comics, is the main antagonist, although he was not even featured as a character in the original comic book.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Ob\u00e9lix\n* [[Clovis Cornillac]] as Ast\u00e9rix\n* [[Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde]] as Brutus\n* [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]] as the Druid [[Getafix|Panoramix]]\n* [[Alain Delon]] as Julius Caesar\n* [[Bouli Lanners]] as Samagas\n* [[Jean-Pierre Castaldi]] as Castaldus\n* [[Michael Bully Herbig]] as Pasunmotdeplus, Brutus\u2019 mute sidekick\n* [[Doroth\u00e9e Jemma]] as Bonemine\n* [[Santiago Segura]] as Docteurmabus\n* [[Vanessa Hessler]] as Princess Irina\n* [[St\u00e9phane Rousseau]] as Lovesix\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Garcia (actor)|Jos\u00e9 Garcia]] as Couverdepus\n* [[Vincent Moscato]] as Goth\n* [[Luca Bizzarri]] as Alpha\n* [[Paolo Kessisoglu]] as Omega\n}}\n\nThere is a cameo of [[Adriana Karembeu]] as [[List of Asterix characters#Mrs. Geriatrix|Mrs Geriatrix]] and [[Jamel Debbouze]] reprises his role as Numerobis.
