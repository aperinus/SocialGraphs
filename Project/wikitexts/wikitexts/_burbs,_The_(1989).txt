Late one night, he hears strange noises coming from the basement of his new and reclusive neighbors, the Klopeks. Ray and his other neighbors\u2014Art Weingartner and [[Vietnam War]] veteran Mark Rumsfield\u2014gradually suspect the Klopeks may be ritualistic murderers. On another night, they observe the youngest Klopek cart an oversized garbage bag to their curbside garbage can and aggressively mash it down. Later that night, during a rainstorm, Ray sees the Klopeks digging in their backyard. In the morning, Ray, Mark, and Art search the garbage truck for human remains after the Klopeks' trash is collected, but find nothing.\n\nMark's wife Bonnie finds their neighbor Walter's dog running loose. Worried about the elderly man, Ray, Art, the Rumsfields, and teenage neighbor Ricky Butler enter Walter's house and find overturned chairs and Walter's [[toup\u00e9e]], but no Walter. Ray collects the dog, leaves a note for Walter, slips the toup\u00e9e back in through the mail slot, and sees one of the Klopeks watching him from their house. Ray and Art theorize that the Klopeks may have used Walter as a human sacrifice, becoming further convinced when Ray's dog digs up a human [[femur]] from along the Klopeks' fence line. Ray's wife Carol, tired of the men's behavior, organizes a welcome visit to the Klopeks. While the Petersons and Rumsfields meet Hans, Reuben, and Dr. Werner Klopek, Art snoops around the Klopeks' backyard and is chased out by a large dog. Afterward, Ray reveals to Art and Mark that he found Walter's mail and toup\u00e9e at the Klopeks', proving they had been in Walter's house.\n\nThe next day, Ray sends Carol and their son Dave to visit Carol's sister. When the Klopeks leave, Art and Ray enter their backyard to search for Walter's corpse while Mark acts as lookout. Finding nothing in the yard, Art and Ray break into the Klopeks' basement, discover what appears to be a [[crematorium]], and dig deep into the floor in search of human remains. The Klopeks return, accompanied by the police after having seen their basement lights on. Ray strikes a gas line with his pickaxe; Art escapes before the house explodes, and Ray emerges from the flames scorched and disheveled just as Carol returns home.\n\nWalter arrives home during the commotion, having spent a few days in the hospital due to [[palpitations]]. He had asked the Klopeks to collect his mail for him, and they had mistakenly gathered up his toup\u00e9e as well. Ray declares that he and the others were wrong about the Klopeks, and climbs into an ambulance. Werner enters and accuses Ray of having seen a human skull in the basement furnace, revealing that the Klopeks murdered the previous homeowners so they could live in their house. Werner attempts to lethally inject Ray as Hans drives the ambulance away. Their struggle causes the ambulance to crash into the Weingartners' house, ejecting Werner and Ray, who then makes a [[citizen's arrest]]. Ricky uncovers human skeletal remains in the Klopeks' car trunk. The Klopeks are arrested, and charges against Ray are dropped. Ray states that he and his family are going away for awhile, and asks Ricky to watch over the neighborhood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Ray Peterson\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Mark Rumsfield\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Carol Peterson\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Art Weingartner\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Ricky Butler\n* [[Wendy Schaal]] as Bonnie Rumsfield\n* [[Henry Gibson]] as Dr. Werner Klopek\n* [[Brother Theodore]] as Uncle Reuben Klopek\n* [[Courtney Gains]] as Hans Klopek\n* [[Gale Gordon]] as Walter Seznick\n* [[Cory Danziger]] as Dave Peterson\n* Heather Haase as Ricky's girlfriend\n* [[Nicky Katt|Nick Katt]] as Ricky's friend Steve Kuntz\n* Brenda Benner as Walter's daughter\n* [[Patrika Darbo]] as Suzette Weingartner, Art's wife\n}}\n\nAdditional minor roles were played by [[Dick Miller]] and [[Robert Picardo]] as garbagemen Vic and Joe; [[Franklyn Ajaye]] and [[Rance Howard]] as detectives; Bill Stevenson, Gary Hays, and [[Carey Scott]] as Ricky's friends; and [[Kevin Gage (actor)|Kevin Gage]] and [[Dana Olsen]] as policemen.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nScreenwriter [[Dana Olsen]] based the script on experiences from his own childhood: \"I had an ultranormal middle-class upbringing, but our town had its share of psychos. There was a legendary hatchet murder in the thirties, and every once in a while, you'd pick up the local paper and read something like 'LIBRARIAN KILLS FAMILY, SELF'. As a kid, it was fascinating to think that Mr. Flanagan down the street could turn out to be [[Jack the Ripper]]. And where there's fear, there's comedy. So I approached ''The 'Burbs'' as ''[[Ozzie and Harriet]]'' meet [[Charles Manson]].\"<ref name=\"FoTH\">{{cite book|last1=Pfeiffer|first1=Lee|last2=Lewis|first2=Michael|year=1996|title=The Films of Tom Hanks|isbn=0806517174|series=Citadel Film|publisher=[[Kensington Books|Citadel Press]]|location=New York|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/filmsoftomhanks00pfei}}</ref> Olsen's script attracted producer [[Larry Brezner]], who brought it to Imagine Films. It was greeted with a warm reception from Imagine co-founder [[Brian Grazer]]: \"I liked the concept of a regular guy taking a vacation in his own neighborhood, plus it was funny and well written. It suddenly dawned on me that [[Joe Dante]] would be fantastic [as a director] because it's a mixture of comedy, horror, and reality.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/>\n\nDante, who had directed ''[[Gremlins]]'' and ''[[Innerspace]]'', and his partner, [[Michael Finnell]], were immediately impressed by the concept of the movie. Dante, who specialized in offbeat subject matter, was intrigued by the blending of real-life situations with elements of the supernatural: \"When I tell people about the story, a remarkable number say, 'On my grandmother's block, there were people like that. They never mowed their lawn, and they never came out, and they let their mail stack up, and nobody knew who they were.' And I must confess that in my own neighborhood there's a house like that, falling to wrack and ruin. I think this is perhaps a more common event than most people are aware of.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nDante, Brezner, and Finnell agreed that [[Tom Hanks]] would be the most suitable actor to portray the married Ray Peterson, a conservative man who tries to introduce excitement into his life by investigating the activities of his strange neighbors. Dante referred to Hanks as \"the reigning [[everyman]], a guy that everybody can identify with\",<ref name=\"FoTH\"/> comparing him to [[James Stewart]].<ref name=\"FoTH\"/> Brezner echoed this sentiment, saying \"Hanks is an actor capable of acting funny rather than funny acting. He also has no problem with transition from comedy to [[Pathos]], as he showed in ''[[Nothing in Common]]'', and he's now proving himself as one of the country's most versatile actors.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/>\n\nHanks accepted the role of Ray with enthusiasm, later saying \"What's so bizarrely interesting about this black psychocomedy is that the stuff that goes on in real life in a regular neighborhood will make your hair stand up on the back of your neck.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/> He was also intrigued by his character's distinctive personality traits: \"Sometimes there's more of an opportunity to create than others. Here's a guy with a great life \u2013 a nice house, a wife, a beautiful tree, a nice neighborhood \u2013 and he's happy. Next day, he hates it all. I thought something must've happened to him offstage. And that's the challenge for me of the part: to communicate Ray's offscreen dilemma. One of the reasons Ray doesn't go away on vacation is because it's another extension of the normalcy he's fallen into. So he thinks he'll try a more Bohemian thing, which is to just hang around the house. With a week's worth of free time on his hands, Ray is drawn into the pre-occupations of his neighbors, who always seem to be at home. But what I did is just back-story embellishment that any actor will do. Perhaps from my repertory experience. I don't ask a director for motivation. If he says, 'Go over to the window', I find the reason myself.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/>\n\nHanks found admiration for Dante's directorial style, saying \"Joe has a stylized, visionary way of looking at the entire movie. It's pure film-making \u2013 the story is told from the camera's point of view, and that's a type of movie I haven't made.\" Dante, in turn, praised his star. \"The most impressive thing about Tom Hanks as a comic actor is how effortless he makes it seem. He actually is very diligent about his acting, but his comic sense of what is going to work \u2013 and what isn't \u2013 is really unparalleled.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/> Dante's laid-back, casual style encouraged improvisation among the actors. He noted, \"Tom doesn't like to do scenes the way they're always done. He goes out of his way to put a different spin on everything and his being good as he is and as open as he is encouraged the other actors to do the same. It set a tone for the movie that made it a lot of fun to make.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n''The 'Burbs'' was filmed entirely at [[Universal Studios]] over ten weeks in the summer of 1988, mainly on the [[Colonial Street]] set on the back lot, which served as the Mayfield Place cul-de-sac.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} \"I can't think of many pictures since ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' that all take place in the same area,\" Dante said as production got under way. \"There was a lot of temptation to broaden it and go outside the neighborhood, but it seemed to violate the spirit of the piece. It's almost the kind of thing that could be a stage play except that you could never do on-stage what we've done in this movie.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/> The Colonial Street set had been used in 1987's ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', also starring Hanks.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} At the time ''The 'Burbs'' began production, it was being used as the location for ''[[The New Leave It to Beaver]]'' television series, so the entire area \"reeked\" of normalcy.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} Dante said, \"I asked [production designer] James Spencer, a veteran of ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' and ''[[Gremlins]]'' if he thought he could turn that street into the neighborhood we needed in that period of time.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/> Spencer rose to the challenge, and within a few days they began work on sketching out the proposed designs for the sets. Spencer observed, \"We had to be on the spot. Due to the lack of time, it would have been ludicrous to do our drawing elsewhere.\"<ref name=\"FoTH\"/>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at number 1 with $11,101,197 in its opening weekend (February 17\u201320, 1989).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=burbs.htm|title=The 'Burbs (1989) - Weekend Box Office Results|publisher=[[IMDb]]|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref> Overall, in the US, the film made $36,601,993 and $49,101,993 worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=burbs.htm|title=The 'Burbs (1989) |publisher=[[IMDb]]|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reaction===\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''The 'Burbs'' a negative review, calling it \"as empty as something can be without creating a vacuum\".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/17/movies/reviews-film-suspicious-goings-on-next-door.html \"Reviews/Film; Suspicious Goings-On Next Door\"] - ''New York Times'', February 17, 1989.</ref>\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave it two out of four stars, writing \"''The 'Burbs'' tries to position itself somewhere between ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', but it lacks the dementia of the first and the wicked intelligence of the second and turns instead into a long [[shaggy dog story]].\"<ref>{{cite web |date= February 17, 1989 |last1= Ebert |first1= Roger |author-link1= Roger Ebert |title=The 'Burbs movie review & film summary (1989) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-burbs-1989 |website= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref> On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 53% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.98/10.
