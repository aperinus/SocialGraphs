Kai and Asano's daughter Mika fall in love, despite the scorn her father's samurai hold for Kai\u2019s mixed ancestry.\n\nLord [[Kira Yoshinaka|Kira]], the [[Sh\u014dgun]]'s master of ceremonies, seeks to take Ak\u014d for himself with the help of Mizuki, a shapeshifting [[kitsune]]. She sends a [[Qilin|kirin]] to kill Asano and his men on a hunting trip, leading Kai to ride to their aid. Taking up a fallen sword, Kai slays the monster and spots Mizuki in the form of a white fox with [[Heterochromia iridum|different-colored eyes]]. When the Sh\u014dgun [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]] visits Ak\u014d, Kai notices Mizuki disguised as a concubine with the same multi-colored eyes. He tries to warn Asano's principal counselor, [[\u014cishi Yoshio|Oishi]], about the witch in Kira's household, but is dismissed.\n\nFor the entertainment of the Sh\u014dgun, Kira arranges a duel between his best warrior, a [[golem]], and Asano's chosen combatant, whom Mizuki incapacitates with magic. Kai secretly dons his armor to fight in his stead, but is unmasked during the duel, and the Sh\u014dgun orders him severely beaten. That night, Mizuki bewitches Asano into believing Kira is raping Mika, causing him to attack the unarmed lord. Sentenced to death, Asano is compelled to perform ''[[seppuku]]'' to preserve his honor. The Sh\u014dgun gives Kira domain over Ak\u014d and Mika, granting her one year of mourning before she must marry Kira. The Sh\u014dgun brands Oishi and his men ''[[ronin]]'', forbidding them from avenging Asano, and Kira has Oishi imprisoned and Kai sold into slavery.\n\nNearly a year later, Oishi is released by his captors, believing him harmless. Having realized that Kira used sorcery to frame Asano, Oishi and his son Chikara reunite the scattered ronin, and rescue Kai from the fighting pits of the Dutch colony of [[Dejima]]. Kai leads them to the mystical [[Tengu]] Forest, which he escaped as a child, to obtain the special blades of the Tengu. Warning Oishi never to draw his sword inside the Tengu temple, Kai faces the Tengu Master who once trained him. Faced with an illusion of his men being slaughtered by the Tengu, Oishi resists the urge to draw his sword, while Kai bests his former master. Having proven themselves worthy, the ronin receive their blades.\n\nThey plan to ambush Kira on his pilgrimage to a shrine to seeks blessings for his wedding to Mika, but the procession is a trap and most of the ronin are killed. Believing them all dead, Mizuki presents Kira with Oishi's sword, and taunts Mika with their deaths. Oishi and Kai, having survived the attack, lead half the remaining ronin to infiltrate Kira's castle, disguised as a band of wedding performers. With Kira's men distracted during the performance, the other ronin scale the castle walls and attack the guards. While Oishi fights Kira, Kai and Mika face Mizuki in the form of a dragon, and Kai finally draws on the mystical powers of the Tengu to kill her. Oishi emerges with Kira's severed head, and Kira's retainers surrender.\n\nThe ronin and Kai surrender themselves to the authorities of the [[bakufu]] and are sentenced to death, having violated the Sh\u014dgun's prohibition on avenging Asano. However, the Sh\u014dgun declares that they followed the principles of ''[[bushido]]'' and restores their honor as samurai, allowing them to perform ''seppuku'' and receive the honor of burial with Asano. The Sh\u014dgun returns domain of Ak\u014d to Mika, and pardons Chikara so that he may preserve Oishi\u2019s bloodline and serve Ak\u014d.\n\nAn epilogue explains the tradition of paying respect at the graves of the 47 Ronin, which continues every year on [[December 14]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast as billed per [[WP:CASTLIST]] -->\n<!-- Roles as listed in the Cast list in film -->\n<!-- Actors billed 1 per screen -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Kai, a half-Japanese, half-English outcast adopted by the household of Lord Asano who joins the Ronin.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news | url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=74822 | title=''47 Ronin'' Start of Principal Photography Announced | website=ComingSoon.net | date=March 1, 2011 | access-date=March 10, 2011 }}</ref> The character was created for the film.<ref name=\"japanese\" />\n** Daniel Barber as Teen Kai\n* [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as [[\u014cishi Yoshio|Yoshio Oishi]], the leader of the R\u014dnin.<ref name=\"start\"/>\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as [[Kira Yoshinaka|Lord Yoshinaka Kira]], Lord Asano's rival [[daimy\u014d]].<ref name=\"start\" />\n* [[Rinko Kikuchi]] as Mizuki the Witch, an [[Heterochromia iridum|odd-eyed]] sorceress who serves Lord Kira<ref name=\"start\" />\n* [[Ko Shibasaki]] as Mika Asano, Lord Asano's daughter and Kai's love interest.<ref name=\"start\" />\n** Arisa Maekawa as Teen Mika\n* [[Min Tanaka]] as [[Asano Naganori|Lord Naganori Asano]], the former master of the R\u014dnin.\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi|Sh\u014dgun Tsunayoshi Tokugawa]]\n<!-- Billed 2 per screen-->\n* [[Jin Akanishi]] as Chikara Oishi, Oishi's son.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pang | first=Lauren | url=http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/w_apa/showarticle.aspx?articleID=16644 | title=Jin Akanishi set to star in 47 Ronin | work=Asia Pacific Arts | publisher=[[University of Southern California]] | date=April 14, 2011 | access-date=May 16, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227081810/http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/w_apa/showarticle.aspx?articleID=16644 | archive-date=December 27, 2013 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Masayoshi Haneda]] as Yasuno\n<!-- Billed 3 per screen-->\n* Hiroshi Sogabe as Hazama\n* Takato Yonemoto as Basho\n* Hiroshi Yamada as Hara\n<!-- Billed 3 per screen-->\n* [[Yorick van Wageningen]] as Kapitan\n* [[Masayuki Deai]] as Isogai\n* Shu Nakajima as Horibe\n<!-- Billed 3 per screen-->\n* [[Togo Igawa]] as [[S\u014dj\u014db\u014d|Tengu Lord]]\n* Natsuki Kunimoto as Riku\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as Troupe Leader (Kabuki Actor)\n* [[Rick Genest]] as Foreman\n* Ron Bottitta as Narrator\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Universal Pictures]] first announced the film in December 2008, with [[Keanu Reeves]] attached to star.
