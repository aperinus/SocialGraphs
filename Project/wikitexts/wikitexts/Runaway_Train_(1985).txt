After two previous escape attempts, Manny is put in solitary confinement for three years.  A court order compels sadistic Associate Warden Ranken to release him from solitary. Planning a third break out, Manny is forced to advance his plan to mid-winter after he is stabbed. Manny recruits young prisoner Buck McGeehy to help in the complicated plan. After escaping from the prison via a sewer tunnel that opens out above a freezing river, and an arduous cross-country hike, the two arrive at a switchyard. After stealing some railroad clothing, they hop on board a train, consisting only of four locomotives.\n\nThe elderly railroad engineer, Al, has a fatal heart attack after starting the train and falls off the lead locomotive. He manages to apply the brakes, but the locomotives overpower them; resulting in the brake shoes burning off. As the unmanned train accelerates, dispatchers Dave Prince and Frank Barstow are alerted to the situation. Barstow allows the train to reach onto the mainline, whilst trying to keep the tracks farther down the line clear. Unfortunately, the runaway smashes the caboose of another train pulling onto a siding. The collision badly damages the cab of the lead locomotive and jams the front door of the second engine, an old [[EMD F-unit]]. The convicts finally realize something is wrong. Barstow's superior Eddie McDonald orders him to intentionally derail the train.\n\nAt this point, the train's horn blows, alerting the authorities (and the two fugitives) someone else is aboard the train. Barstow has the maintainer cancel the derailment. Ranken concludes his two escaped convicts are fleeing by rail. Meanwhile, the two fugitives are discovered by Sara, a [[Hostler#Modern uses|locomotive hostler]], who explains she sounded the horn and the train is out of control. She convinces them jumping off the train at its current speed would be suicide while revealing the only possible way to stop the train would be to climb forward onto the lead engine and press its [[kill switch]], a near-impossible feat. They manage to shut down the third and fourth locomotives, nearly derailing on a bridge while doing so.\n\nThe dispatchers divert the runaway onto a dead-end branch line after determining it is only five minutes away from a head-on collision with a passenger train. Further ahead the train has a tight curve near a chemical plant. Barstow agrees they must crash it, thus condemning all three on board to death, rather than risking a chemical explosion. Ranken forces Barstow to help him reach the train via helicopter. Manny tries forcing Buck into a suicidal scramble around the outside of the second engine's nose. Sara's intervention on Buck's behalf results in an armed face-off. Emotionally broken, all three slump into depression. Ranken's accomplice is lowered from a helicopter to the lead engine, but falls under the train after smashing through its windscreen. \n \nSpurred on by the appearance of his arch-enemy with an absolute resolve to not be returned to prison, Manny makes a perilous leap to the lead engine. He barely makes it, severely crushing his hand. Ranken boards the locomotive from the helicopter; Manny ambushes and handcuffs him inside the lead engine. Ranken orders Manny to stop the train before it crashes, but Manny has chosen to die rather than be recaptured. When reminded of Buck and Sara in the second engine, Manny uncouples the lead engine from the rest of the train. He waves goodbye without a word (ignoring Buck's screaming pleas to shut down the lead engine), and climbs onto the roof in the freezing snow, with his arms stretched out, accepting his inevitable fate. Buck and Manny's fellow inmates quietly mourn in their cells as the lone engine vanishes into the storm. The film closes with an on-screen quote from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'':\n\n{{Blockquote|\"No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.\"<br>\"But I know none, and therefore am no beast.\"<ref>In the play the first line is spoken by the character Lady Anne, the second by the Duke of Gloucester (later to become King Richard III).</ref>}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Oscar \"Manny\" Manheim\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Buck McGeehy\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Sara\n* [[Kyle T.

He thought it would make a good film and contacted [[Joseph E. Levine]] about doing an international co-production. In June 1966, Kurosawa announced he would make ''Runaway Train'' for Joseph E. Levine's [[Embassy Pictures]]. The budget was to be $5.6 million. The script was written by Kurosawa, [[Hideo Oguni]] and [[Ryuzo Kikushima]], about two escaped convicts who hide on board a stationary train, only for it to roll away, gradually picking up tremendous speed. [[Sidney Carroll]] was hired to adapt Kurosawa's script into English. The film would be shot along tracks between Syracuse and Rochester in New York over 16 weeks in October 1966. Tetsuo Aoyagi would produce and the film would be shot in 70&nbsp;mm.<ref>{{cite news|title=Train on a 'Foreign' Track|author=Martin, Betty|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 1, 1966|page=d11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kurosawa to Make Film Here Jointly With Embassy Pictures|author=Howard Thompson|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 1, 1966|page=42}}</ref>\n\nPlans to shoot were cancelled at the last minute, only to be scheduled and cancelled yet again.<ref>{{cite news|title=TV Producer Says Sophia Loren Going to Have Baby|work=The Washington Post and Times-Herald|date=December 14, 1966|page=C12}}</ref> In April 1967 the project had been \"indefinitely postponed\" and Kurosawa signed to make ''[[Tora!

Coppola and his producer, Tom Luddy, suggested Andrei Konchalovsky. The director succeeded in raising finance from Cannon Films.\n\n\"The design is still Kurosawa's\", said Andrei Konchalovsky. \"The concentration of energy and passion, the existential point of view, and the image of the train as something \u2013 perhaps civilization \u2013 out of control....

During filming, the crew realized they didn't have any real snow, due to warm temperatures (a false spring) in the area. They used Christmas tree flock for fake snow, and they had to keep it from melting on the tracks at the west yard. Cannon Films had to cut short its stay in Anaconda, and they moved onto [[Deer Lodge, Montana]], to film the prison scenes at the Old Montana State Prison. Approximately 200 extras were hired to play prisoners in the scenes. They spent a week filming several scenes at the prison. Finally the second unit team went to [[Whittier, Alaska]], to film on the Alaska Railroad tracks. The Bridge sequence was filmed on the Seneca Bridge on Placer Creek, about 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) from Whittier. The scene where Jordan makes the switch on the tracks was filmed at [[Portage, Alaska]]. The cast and crew went to the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, to film the interior of the train scenes and the prisoners' escape scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskarails.org/sf/film/runaway-train/|title=Runaway Train|website=www.AlaskaRails.org|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe runaway train's lineup in the movie consisted of four Alaska Railroad locomotives, all built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]]: [[EMD GP40-2|GP40-2]] #3010, [[EMD F7|F7]] #1500, and #1801 and #1810, both [[EMD GP7|GP7s]]. The latter two locomotives had previously been rebuilt by ARR with low short hoods as opposed to a GP7's original high short hood, but were fitted with mock-up high hoods made of plywood for the film, branded with fictional numbers 531 and 812, respectively.
