Despite all this, sweet-natured family patriarch Darryl ([[Michael Caton]]) believes that he lives in the lap of luxury. Blissfully unaware of his family's lack of style or sophistication, he busies himself by driving a tow truck, racing greyhounds, and constantly adding tacky renovations to the house. The rest of the Kerrigan clan shares and supports his enthusiasm in every way.\n\nOne day, a property valuer arrives to inspect the house. Though he [[Holdout (real estate)|has no wish to sell]], Darryl points out all the features of the property, believing they will add value to the appraisal. A few weeks later, he receives a letter informing him of the compulsory acquisition of his house for the sum of $70,000. His neighbours (elderly Jack, divorcee Yvonne, and Farouk and Tabulah, recent immigrants from [[Lebanon]]) all receive similar notices. Believing on common principle that the government cannot evict him unwillingly from his treasured home, Darryl attempts to fight the eviction. Agents from the airport try to bribe and bully the family into giving up, but their actions only stiffen the Kerrigans' resolve. Darryl hires an incompetent lawyer acquaintance, Dennis Denuto ([[Tiriel Mora]]), but Dennis's meagre argument that the eviction goes against \"the vibe\" of the Constitution does not go well in court. While awaiting the court's final decision, Darryl makes pleasant small talk with a man whom he meets outside the courthouse, Lawrence Hammill ([[Bud Tingwell]]), who has come to watch his son (a barrister) perform in court in a different case. The court rejects the family's appeal and gives them two weeks to vacate. The purchase price for the home is scarcely enough to cover a small apartment. Dejected in defeat, the family begins to pack.\n\nA new breath of hope comes with the surprise arrival of Lawrence, who reveals himself to be a retired [[Queen's Counsel]]. Lawrence has taken an interest in the Kerrigans' case, in part due to his extensive experience in constitutional law, and offers to argue before the [[High Court of Australia]] on their behalf, [[Pro bono publico|gratis]]. Lawrence makes a persuasive case that the Kerrigans have the right to just terms of compensation for acquisition of property under [[Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution]]. He closes by paraphrasing Darryl's own comments that his house is more than just a structure of bricks and mortar, but a home built with love and shared memories. The court rules in favour of the Kerrigans, and their case becomes a landmark [[precedent]] on the subject. An [[epilogue]] shows that the Kerrigans continue to prosper happily, and Lawrence becomes a lasting friend of the family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caton]] as Darryl Kerrigan, the father\n* [[Anne Tenney]] as Sal Kerrigan, the mother\n* [[Stephen Curry (comedian)|Stephen Curry]] as Dale Kerrigan, the youngest son, digger of holes, and the film's narrator\n* [[Sophie Lee]] as Tracey Petropoulous (n\u00e9e Kerrigan), the family's only daughter, a newlywed hair dresser\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Con Petropoulous, Tracey's new husband, an accountant and amateur kickboxer\n* [[Anthony Simcoe]] as Steve Kerrigan, the second oldest son and an apprentice mechanic\n* [[Wayne Hope]] as Wayne Kerrigan, the black sheep, who is serving time for armed robbery but is loved by his family regardless\n* [[Tiriel Mora]] as Dennis Denuto, a bumbling small-time lawyer who previously failed to defend Wayne on his charge\n* [[Costas Kilias]] as Farouk, the Kerrigans' neighbour\n* [[Bud Tingwell|Charles 'Bud' Tingwell]] as Lawrence Hammill QC, a retired barrister who comes to the Kerrigans' aid by representing them ''[[pro bono]]''\n* [[John Flaus]] as Sgt.

The screenplay was written in two weeks, shot in ten days and taken to rough cut in two weeks.<ref name=\"santo\">[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Santo+Cilauro&bl Interview with Santo Cilauro, Signit, 6 February 1997] accessed 14 October 2012</ref><ref>Peter Malone, \"A House is a Castle\", ''Cinema Papers'', April 1997 p10-12</ref>\n\n''The Castle'' was filmed mostly in [[Melbourne]], Victoria. The external shots of the Kerrigan household were shot at 3 Dagonet St, [[Strathmore, Victoria|Strathmore]], and airport footage was shot at [[Essendon Airport]] and [[Melbourne Airport]]. Location shots of [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]] feature in the film, including [[Brunswick Town Hall, Victoria|Brunswick Town Hall]] and Rocky Porcino Pharmacy at 720 Sydney Rd (Dennis's office). Melbourne's [[200 Queen Street]] and the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] are featured along with the [[High Court of Australia]] in [[Canberra]]. Some of the film is set in [[Bonnie Doon, Victoria|Bonnie Doon]], and a very small portion of it was shot there.\n\nThe name Kerrigan was chosen for the family so that tow trucks could be borrowed from an existing [[Melbourne]] tow-truck company with that name. The company still operates today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118826/trivia |title=The Castle (1997) \u2013 Trivia |work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2011, 3491 Maintongoon Road, [[Bonnie Doon, Victoria|Bonnie Doon]] was listed for sale.

It also draws on one of the few rights protected in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] for subject matter, the right to just terms compensation for acquisition of property under [[Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution|s51(xxxi)]]. Also interspersed in the film are many references to famous Australian Constitutional Law Cases, such as [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo]] and the [[Tasmanian Dams Case]]. The film also deals with [[Section 109 of the Australian Constitution|section 109]] of the Constitution which provides that in the case of an inconsistency between Federal and State law, the Federal law shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\nFor the purpose of the drama, some of the relevant legal principles are simplified. For example, the law relating to compulsory acquisition can be complicated and raises more questions than are noted in the film. Section 51 (xxxi) of the Commonwealth Constitution applies to acquisitions only by the Commonwealth, not by the States, and the latter are more likely to compulsorily acquire property.<ref name=Hardwick>{{cite news|last1=Hardwick|first1=Ben|title='Tell him he's dreamin': five myths about The Castle and the law|url=http://www.domain.com.au/news/tell-him-hes-dreamin-five-myths-about-the-castle-and-the-law-20151027-gkja63/|\naccess-date=2 November 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 October 2015}}</ref> Similarly, in contrast to Kerrigan's idea that the value he places on his own home cannot be bought, the law regularly places a monetary value on intangible human values.\n\n==Themes==\n''The Castle'' can be seen as a social study on the lives and aspirations of the inhabitants of suburban Australia. The central character, Darryl Kerrigan, ties into the stereotypical depiction of an \"[[Aussie battler]]\", a man who will protect and serve his family through bold and sometimes ruthless assertion.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Castle hero Darryl Kerrigan best represents Australians: survey|date=6 October 2010|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/the-castle-hero-darryl-kerrigan-represents-australians-best-survey/news-story/4249993462a92e4eda77a997da42f273}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-the-castle-actor-michael-caton-joins-campaign-for-legal-aid-funding-20160622-gpp0mb.html|title=Federal election 2016: 'The Castle' actor Michael Caton joins campaign for Legal Aid funding|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=23 June 2016}}</ref> The Aussie battler will at times face challenges or adversity, often in the face of oppressive government or economic hardship.
