She works as a stockbroker's secretary in [[lower Manhattan]], aspiring to reach an executive position. Tess is treated like a bimbo by her boss and male co-workers, who nonetheless benefit from her intelligence and business instincts. Fed up with being humiliated by her boss, Tess quits in dramatic fashion.\n\nTess soon finds a job as an administrative assistant to Katharine Parker ([[Sigourney Weaver]]), a young associate in Mergers and Acquisitions. Seemingly supportive as fellow female professional, Katharine encourages Tess to share ideas. Tess suggests an idea for a merger between Trask Industries and a radio station. Katharine seems intrigued but eventually tells Tess it wouldn't work out.\n\nWhen Katharine injures her leg skiing, she asks Tess to house-sit. While staying there, Tess discovers some meeting notes and realizes Katharine plans to pass off the merger idea as her own.\n\nTess decides to use her boss' absence, connections, and clothes to move ahead with her merger plans. She schedules a meeting with Jack Trainer ([[Harrison Ford]]), a mergers and acquisitions associate from another company. With her friend Cyn's ([[Joan Cusack]]) help, she cuts her hair to look more professional and raids Katherine's closet for more stylish clothing.\n\nAt the meeting with Trainer and his associates, Tess lacks confidence and leaves believing the meeting was a failure. Jack, however, arrives at her office and wants to move forward with her idea. Jack quickly secures a radio network acquisition for Trask Industries and bristles when Tess attempts to meet with the Trask CEO, Oren Trask ([[Philip Bosco]]) on her own, which he soon realizes is because her plan is to meet with him while crashing his daughter's wedding. Despite Jack's misgivings, Tess's charm and quick thinking secures Trask's interest in the merger.\n\nJack and Tess grow closer as they prepare the financials for the merger proposal, which is ultimately a success. They give in to their attraction and end up in bed. Tess is tempted to tell him the truth, but demurs when she discovers Jack is also involved with Katharine, though he was going to break up with her before her injury.\n\nKatharine returns home the same day as the meeting to finalize the merger. While Tess is helping her get settled, Jack arrives to end things with Katharine, who pressures him to propose. He dodges the conversation and runs to the merger meeting. Tess accidentally leaves her appointment book in Katharine's apartment before leaving for the same meeting, which leads to Katharine discovering what Tess has been up to.\n\nKatharine pushes her way into the meeting and outs Tess as her secretary, accusing her of having stolen the idea. Tess begins to protest but feels nobody would believe her. She leaves, apologizing profusely.\n\nDays later, Tess clears out her desk and then bumps into Jack, Katharine, and Trask at the lobby elevators. A confrontation between Katharine and Tess leads Jack to stand up for Tess. When Tess reveals she's discovered a hole in the deal, Trask abandons Katharine in a closing elevator and hears Tess's explanation for how she came up with the merger idea.\n\nWhen Trask confronts Katharine, she is unable to explain where she got the merger idea. He promises to have her fired for her actions and offers Tess an entry-level job with Trask Industries, which she happily accepts.\n\nTess arrives for her first day at her new job at Trask and is shown to an office where she meets Alice, the woman Tess assumes she will be working for; however, Alice explains that she is actually Tess's secretary. Tess insists they work together as colleagues, showing she will be very different from Katharine. She then calls Cyn from her own office to tell her she has finally made it.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast list|\n*[[Melanie Griffith]] as Tess McGill\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as Jack Trainer\n*[[Sigourney Weaver]] as Katharine Parker\n*[[Alec Baldwin]] as Mick Dugan\n*[[Joan Cusack]] as Cynthia\n*[[Philip Bosco]] as Oren Trask\n*[[Zach Grenier]] as Jim\n*[[Nora Dunn]] as Ginny, a colleague of Katharine's\n*[[Oliver Platt]] as Lutz, Tess's first boss\n*James Lally as Turkel\n*[[Kevin Spacey]] as Bob Speck, a cokehead arbitrageur\n*[[Robert Easton (actor)|Robert Easton]] as Armbrister\n*[[Amy Aquino]] as Alice Baxter, Tess's secretary\n*[[Olympia Dukakis]] as personnel director\n*[[Ricki Lake]] as Bridesmaid\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nScreenwriter [[Kevin Wade]] was inspired to write the screenplay after visiting New York City in 1984 and witnessing throngs of career women walking through the streets in tennis shoes while carrying their high-heels.<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Casting===\nMelanie Griffith read the screenplay for ''Working Girl'' over a year before the production began, and expressed interest in playing the role of Tess McGill.<ref name=afi/> Approximately a year later, [[Mike Nichols]] agreed to direct the film after reading the screenplay while shooting his film ''[[Biloxi Blues (film)|Biloxi Blues]]'' in [[Alaska]].<ref name=afi/> Following Nichols' attachment, Griffith had a formal audition for the role.<ref name=afi/> Nichols was so determined for Griffith to have the part that he threatened to drop out of the production if the studio, [[20th Century Fox]], would not hire her.<ref name=afi/>\n\nFollowing the casting of Sigourney Weaver and Harrison Ford\u2014both major stars at that point\u2014the studio agreed to cast Griffith, as they felt Weaver and Ford's involvement gave them a higher chance of box-office success.<ref name=afi/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] of ''Working Girl'' began on February 16, 1988, in New York City.<ref name=afi/> Many scenes were shot in the [[New Brighton, Staten Island|New Brighton]] section of Staten Island in New York City.
