It was originally released in Japan on March 10 between episodes 39 and 40 of ''DBZ'', at the \"Toei Manga Matsuri\" film festival along with the second ''[[Akuma-kun]]'' film (''Welcome to Devil Land'') and the 1990 film version of ''[[Sally the Witch]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\n[[Gohan]] and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Oolong|Oolong]] search for the [[magic (supernatural)|magical]] Dragon Balls and their [[radar]] shows them that the orbs are being gathered by another, unknown party. They investigate near a large wall of ice where [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] is training. Meanwhile, the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Kochin, having successfully gathered all of the Dragon Balls, summons the eternal dragon Shenron and [[wishes]] for Dr. Wheelo and his lab to be released from the ice. The ice breaks away as a building emerges and Gohan and Oolong are attacked by Dr. Kochin's \"bio-men\". Piccolo saves them but is overcome by three mysterious warriors while Gohan and Oolong escape.\n\nDr. Kochin and his bio-men soon present themselves to [[Master Roshi]] who refuses to accompany them to Wheelo's lab and defeats the bio-men. Dr. Kochin kidnaps [[Bulma]] to force Master Roshi to pursue them. At Wheelo's lab, Master Roshi is forced to fight three \"bio-warriors\" but is swiftly defeated. Bulma discovers that Dr. Wheelo's mission is to obtain the body of the strongest warrior on Earth to become the host for his brain, which is currently separated from his deceased body and kept alive by his advanced technology. Bulma informs him that [[Goku]] will undoubtedly be coming to rescue them and that he is much more powerful than Roshi. Meanwhile, Goku learns of situation and he arrives at Dr. Wheelo's lab and is confronted by Mikokatsun, Kishime, and Ebifurya \u2013 Dr. Kochin's three bio-warrior [[henchmen]]. Goku defeats Mikokatsun but is frozen by an ice-like attack launched by Ebifurya. Gohan and [[Krillin]] arrive to  help but are no match for Kishime. Goku breaks free from ice with his Kaio-ken technique, defeats the two remaining bio-warriors, and confronts Dr. Wheelo. Piccolo, who has been brainwashed by Dr. Wheelo, attacks Goku. Gohan tries to stop Piccolo but fails, causing his anger to explode, shattering Dr. Wheelo's brainwashing device. Dr. Wheelo is stunned by Gohan's power and desires to steal his body instead. He breaks his [[robot]] body free from the ice wall, subsequently knocking Dr. Kochin down a shaft which kills him.\n\nDr. Wheelo attacks, overwhelms the fighters, and only Goku and Piccolo are left to oppose him. Goku knocks Dr. Wheelo into the atmosphere and begins to form a Spirit Bomb attack. Wheelo interrupts him before he can finish gathering the [[qi|energy]] for it requiring Goku's allies to distract Wheelo. Goku's successfully launches the bomb and Wheelo is killed.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"3\" |English\n|-\n! <small>[[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer]]/[[Funimation]]/<br>[[Ocean Studios]] (1998)</small>\n! <small>Chinkel Post-Production/[[Mediawan Thematics|AB Groupe]] ({{circa|2003}})</small><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614|title = Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref>\n! <small>[[FUNimation]] (2006)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Goku]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Masako Nozawa]] || [[Peter Kelamis]] || [[David Gasman]]<br>Ed Marcus <small>(some vocal effects)</small> || [[Sean Schemmel|Se\u00e1n Schemmel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gohan]]\n| [[Saffron Henderson]] || Jodi Forrest || [[Stephanie Nadolny]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Toshio Furukawa]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Scott McNeil]]\n! <small>Big Green</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Christopher Sabat|Christopher R.

Both dubs use Toei's official English title rather than Funimation's title, and until recently, the voice cast of the AB Groupe dub version was unknown, but then it has been determined that they used voice actors who were involved in French TV shows like ''[[Code Lyoko]]'', while the Malaysian dub's cast remains unknown.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150404055028/http://corp.toei-anim.co.jp/english/film/dragon_ball_z_2_the_strongest.php Official anime website] of [[Toei Animation]]\n*{{IMDb title|0142240}}\n*{{ann anime|anime|id=140}}\n{{Portal bar|Anime and manga|Film|Japan|1990s}}\n\n{{Dragon Ball anime}}\n{{Toei Animation films 1990s}}\n\n[[Category:1990 films]]\n[[Category:1990 anime films]]\n[[Category:Dragon Ball animated films|Worlds Strongest]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Daisuke Nishio]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:Geneon USA]]\n[[Category:Films about genetic engineering]]\n[[Category:Toei Animation films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Shunsuke Kikuchi]]\n[[Category:Japanese animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Japanese fantasy adventure films]]"}]}}}}
