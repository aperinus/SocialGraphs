The film has an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Rhys Ifans]], [[Nick Frost]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]]. Set in 1967, it tells the story of the fictional pirate radio station \"Radio Rock\" and its crew of eclectic [[disc jockey]]s, who broadcast [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] to the United Kingdom from a ship anchored in the [[North Sea]] while the British government tries to shut them down. It was produced by [[Working Title Films]] for [[Universal Pictures]] and was filmed on the [[Isle of Portland]] and at [[Shepperton Studios]].\n\nAfter the world premiere in [[Leicester Square]] on 23 March 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Knapton|first=Sarah|title=The Boat That Rocked stars hit red carpet for premiere|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/5039599/The-Boat-That-Rocked-stars-hit-red-carpet-for-premiere.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=2 May 2014|date=23 March 2009}}</ref> the film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 1 April 2009. It was a commercial failure at the British box office making only US$10.1 million in its first three months, just a fifth of its US$50 million production cost.<ref name=\"Mojo\" /> It received mixed reviews and criticism for its length. For its North American release, the film was cut by 20 minutes and retitled ''Pirate Radio''. Opening on 13 November 2009, it earned only $8 million in the US. When the worldwide theatrical run was finished in January 2010, the film had grossed US$36.6 million.<ref name=\"Mojo\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1966, various [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio stations]] broadcast to the United Kingdom from ships in [[international waters]], specialising in [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] not played on [[BBC Radio]]. Seventeen-year-old Carl, recently expelled from school, is sent to stay with his godfather Quentin, who runs the station \"Radio Rock\" anchored in the [[North Sea]]. The eclectic crew of [[disc jockey]]s and staffers, led by brash American DJ \"The Count\", accept Carl as one of their own (although he appears to have no significant duties).\n\nConspiring to help Carl lose his virginity, DJ Doctor Dave arranges for Carl to seduce a female fan in the dark, believing Carl to be Dave, but the plan is foiled, embarrassing Carl.\n\nIn London, government minister Sir Alistair Dormandy resolves to shut down [[pirate radio]] stations for their commercialism and immorality, instructing his subordinate Twatt to pursue legal stratagems to accomplish this. They attempt to cut off the pirates' revenue by prohibiting British businesses from advertising on unlicensed stations.\n\nQuentin counters by bringing massively popular DJ Gavin Kavanagh out of retirement on Radio Rock, enticing advertisers to pay their bills from abroad. Gavin's popularity creates a rivalry with The Count.\n\nOn his eighteenth birthday, Carl becomes smitten with Quentin's niece Marianne, but is heartbroken when she is seduced by Doctor Dave. Carl's roommate \"Thick\" Kevin observes that the sex, drug, and alcohol-fueled atmosphere of Radio Rock is no place for Carl to get on the straight-and-narrow. He theorises that Carl's mother's true reason for sending him there is that his father \u2013 whom Carl has never met \u2013 is on the ship, with Quentin being the likeliest suspect.\n\nDJ \"Simple\" Simon Swafford marries glamorous fan Elenore in an onboard ceremony, but learns that she only married him to be near Gavin, with whom she is infatuated but refuses to marry anyone. The Count challenges Gavin to a [[chicken (game)|game of chicken]] in defence of Simon's honour: The stubborn rivals climb the ship's [[radio masts and towers|radio mast]] to a dangerous height, but reconcile after they are both injured jumping into the ocean. Carl's mother Charlotte visits for Christmas, and denies that Quentin is his father. Carl gives her a cryptic message from reclusive late-night DJ \"Smooth\" Bob Silver, unexpectedly revealing that Bob is his father. Marianne arrives to apologise to Carl for sleeping with Dave, and she and Carl have sex. The following morning, the DJs announce news of the coupling to cheering fans across Britain.\n\nMeanwhile, Dormandy's vendetta against pirate radio advances when Twatt finds news of a fishing boat whose distress call was blocked by Radio Rock's powerful signal. Twatt proposes the creation of the [[Marine, &c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967|Marine Offences Act]], making pirate radio stations illegal on the grounds that they endanger communication with other vessels. Despite heavy public support for the pirate stations, the Act passes unanimously through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and takes effect at midnight on 1 January 1967. The Radio Rock crew defy the law and continue broadcasting, firing up the ship's engine to evade arrest. The ageing vessel's engine explodes, and the ship sinks. The DJs broadcast their position in hope of aid, and Twatt appeals to Dormandy to send rescue boats, but Dormandy refuses. Carl saves the oblivious Bob from his cabin while The Count vows to broadcast as long as possible.\n\nWith the lifeboats inoperable, the crew gather on the [[prow]] as the ship goes down. They are rescued by dozens of fans in a fleet of small boats; Carl is saved by Marianne, Simon by a fan who genuinely loves him, and Dave by a throng of fans. The Radio Rock ship disappears beneath the sea, with the Count emerging at the last moment. Though pirate radio in Britain comes to an end, the music lives on, growing increasingly popular in subsequent decades and broadcast over hundreds of legal stations around the world.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|<!-- In credits order -->\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as \"The Count\", the brash American DJ on Radio Rock, loosely based on [[Emperor Rosko]], DJ on [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate]] [[Radio Caroline]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/5061924/Girls-in-our-cabins-Well-its-a-nice-image.html |title=Girls in our cabins?
