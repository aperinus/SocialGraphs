In the wake of the tragedy, questions are raised as to why Judge Walter Stern, an old friend of the ambitious [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] John Pappas, had previously set the criminal responsible free on [[probation]]. Pappas' loyal [[Deputy Mayor of New York City|deputy mayor]], Kevin Calhoun, decides to dig for answers. Meanwhile, legal aid Marybeth Cogan uncovers a conspiracy to smear Santos.\n\nCalhoun's investigation leads to Frank Anselmo, a [[Brooklyn]] politician who has connections to Tino's uncle, crime boss Paul Zapatti. Anselmo plants money at Zapatti's behest to frame Santos. Calhoun and Cogan continue to seek the truth from a number of sources, including Santos' partner and another Zapatti relative. After the murder of probation officer Larry Schwartz, they ultimately conclude that Judge Stern had to be on the take. Pappas agrees that Stern must resign.\n\nThe scandal snowballs to the point where Zapatti instructs Anselmo to commit suicide rather than become an informer or go to jail. To protect his family, Anselmo shoots himself. Calhoun uncovers evidence that Pappas put Stern together with Anselmo to receive a [[bribe]] and leave the young Zapatti on the street. Shocked and disheartened by the revelation, Calhoun talks to Pappas and tells him there is only one choice\u2014to quit as mayor and leave politics for good (\"You're gonna take yourself out, John. You're gonna take yourself out.\"). Even though Pappas initially wants to fight the nearing scandal, he has great respect for Calhoun's integrity and acquiesces to his request. Pappas and Calhoun share an emotional goodbye, and Pappas retires from politics.\n\nSome time later Calhoun runs for city councilor and loses the election, remaining steadfast on trying to make a place for himself in politics and also make the city a better place in which to live.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Mayor John Pappas\n* [[John Cusack]] as Kevin Calhoun\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Frank Anselmo\n* [[Murphy Guyer]] as Captain Florian\n* [[John Finn]] as Commissioner Coonan\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Marybeth Cogan\n* [[Anthony Franciosa]] as Paul Zapatti\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Judge Walter Stern\n* [[David Paymer]] as Abe Goodman\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Larry Schwartz\n* [[Harry Bugin]] as Morty the Waiter\n\n[[Fritz Hollings]], the then-current U.S. Senator from South Carolina, plays Senator Marquand, whom Pappas & Calhoun lobby in order to land the Democratic National convention.\n\nFormer [[New York City mayor]] [[Ed Koch]] also has a brief cameo in a political commentary segment of a TV news broadcast.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 56% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10.
