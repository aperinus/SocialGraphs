Karen, an artist, leaves her assistant Louis ([[Aaron Burns]]) in charge of her sculpture that needs to be moved to an art gallery. During a rainstorm on the first night, two young women, Genesis ([[Lorenza Izzo]]) and Bel ([[Ana de Armas]]), knock on Evan's door asking for help finding a party. Evan allows them in to dry off and use the Internet to get hold of the party's host.\n\nEvan orders an [[Uber]] for the girls, who become overly flirtatious with him and seem reluctant to leave. When their driver arrives Evan finds them nude in the bathroom and tries to convince them to leave, but they kneel and begin [[fellating]] him. He gives in and has a [[threesome]] with them. The next morning, Evan finds the girls have vandalized his wife's sculpture and tells them to leave. Karen's friend Vivian ([[Colleen Camp]]) stops by and sees him with Genesis. When Evan threatens to report a break-in, the girls give in and agree to be taken home. He returns them home, cleans up their mess and tries to get back to his work when the girls break in and knock him out with one of his wife's sculptures.\n\nThe girls tell Evan they are underage and threaten to [[FaceTime]] his wife unless he agrees to do what they demand. After being tied to his bed and raped by Bel [[sexual roleplay|role-playing as a schoolgirl]] in his daughter's school uniform, Evan tries to escape but is stabbed with a fork by Genesis and she and Bel tie him to a chair. Louis arrives to collect the sculpture to find Evan tied up and the girls smashing the vandalized sculpture. He starts to have an asthma attack and realizes they have taken his [[inhaler]], while trying to get it back he falls, hits his head and dies. The girls make Louis' corpse into a sculpture and use his phone to make it look like Evan murdered Louis after discovering an affair with his wife. \n\nEvan is further tormented and tortured by the girls, who force him to play hide and seek. He makes an attempt to escape from the house, but is held at gunpoint by Genesis. She and Bel then tell him they have killed other men, and that he will die at dawn. At dawn the next day they tie Evan up with a hose and bury him up to his head in the back yard. Laughing hysterically, they reveal that the entire ordeal was merely a \"game\", as they never intended to kill Evan, nor are either of them underage. Everything they did was part of a wicked hobby of seducing, victimizing, and ruining the homes of married men with children. Genesis uploads video of Bel raping him to his [[Facebook]] profile and the two leave with his dog, Monkey. Karen and the kids arrive home; seeing the house ruined, Evan's son, Jake, says, \"Daddy had a party.\"\n\nIn an alternate ending, Evan takes his revenge by tracking the girls at another victim's house via Monkey's GPS tracker on his collar. He knocks on the door and the girls ask 'Who's there?'.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Keanu Reeves]] as Evan Webber\n*[[Lorenza Izzo]] as Genesis\n*[[Ana de Armas]] as Bel\n*[[Ignacia Allamand]] as Karen Alvarado\n*Dan Baily as Jake\n*Megan Baily as Lisa\n*[[Aaron Burns]] as Louis\n*[[Colleen Camp]] as Vivian\n*Otto as Monkey\n}}\n\n==Production==\nOn April 4, 2014, [[Keanu Reeves]] was added to the cast to play Evan Webber.
