It was executive-produced by [[Adrian Malone]], produced by David Kennard, Geoffrey Haines-Stiles, and Gregory Andorfer, and directed by the producers, David Oyster, Richard Wells, Tom Weidlinger, and others. It covers a wide range of scientific subjects, including the [[origin of life]] and a perspective of our place in the universe. Owing to its [[Cosmos (Sagan book)|bestselling companion book]] and soundtrack album using the title, '''''Cosmos''''', the series is widely known by this title, with the subtitle omitted from home video packaging. The subtitle began to be used more frequently in the 2010s to differentiate it from the sequel series that followed.\n\nThe series was first broadcast by the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] in 1980, and was the most widely watched series in the history of American [[public television]] until ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990). As of 2009, it was still the most widely watched PBS series in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmolearning.com/documentaries/cosmos/|title=CosmoLearning Astronomy|publisher=CosmoLearning|access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref> It won two [[Emmy Awards|Emmys]] and a [[Peabody Award]], and has since been broadcast in more than 60 countries and seen by over 500 million people.<ref name =Starchild>{{cite web | url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/sagan.html | title=StarChild: Dr. Carl Sagan | publisher=[[NASA]] | access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html |title=Carl Sagan |publisher=EMuseum@Minnesota State University |access-date=October 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528213538/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/sagan_carl.html |archive-date=May 28, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref><!-- Retaining two refs here as Wikipedia seems to have incorrectly stated 500 million for years... --> A [[Cosmos (Sagan book)|book]] was also published to accompany the series.\n\n''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage'' has been considered highly significant since its broadcast; [[David Itzkoff]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as \"a watershed moment for science-themed television programming\".<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/05/arts/television/fox-plans-new-cosmos-with-seth-macfarlane-as-a-producer.html | title = 'Family Guy' Creator Part of 'Cosmos' Update | work = [[The New York Times]] | date= August 5, 2011 | access-date = June 28, 2012 | first = Dave | last = Itzkoff }}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Sagan planetary orbits2.jpg|left|thumb|Sagan on the set of ''Cosmos'']]\n\n''Cosmos'' was produced in 1978 and 1979 by Los Angeles [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member station [[KCET]] on a roughly $6.3 million budget, with over $2 million additionally allocated to promotion. The program's format is similar to earlier BBC documentaries such as [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''[[Civilisation (television series)|Civilisation]]'', [[Jacob Bronowski]]'s ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'', and [[David Attenborough]]'s ''[[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]]''. However, unlike those series, which were shot entirely on film, ''Cosmos'' used videotape for interior scenes and special effects, with film being used for exteriors and location shooting (this film-video hybrid format was common in British scripted television at the time, but less so in documentary productions). The BBC\u2014a co-producer of ''Cosmos''\u2014later screened the series, but the episodes were cut to fit 50-minute slots.\n\n[[File:CosmosSagan5.jpg|left|thumb|Sagan in the series' episode, \"Blues for a Red Planet\"]]\n\nThe series is notable for its groundbreaking use of special effects, which allow Sagan to seemingly walk through environments that are actually models rather than full-sized sets. The soundtrack includes pieces of music provided by Greek composer [[Vangelis]], such as ''Alpha'', ''Pulstar'', and ''[[Heaven and Hell (Vangelis album)|Heaven and Hell Part 1]]'' (the last movement serves as the signature theme music for the show, and is directly referenced by the title of the fourth episode). Throughout the 13 hours of the series, many tracks from several 1970s albums are used, such as ''[[Albedo 0.39]]'', ''[[Meddle]]'', ''[[Spiral (Vangelis album)|Spiral]]'', ''Ignacio'', ''[[Beaubourg (album)|Beaubourg]]'', and ''[[China (Vangelis album)|China]]''. The worldwide success of the documentary series put Vangelis' music in the homes of many, and brought it to the attention of a global audience.\n\n[[Turner Home Entertainment]] purchased ''Cosmos'' from series producer KCET in 1989. In making the move to commercial television, the hour-long episodes were edited to shorter lengths, and Sagan shot new epilogues for several episodes, in which he discussed new discoveries\u2014and alternative viewpoints\u2014that had arisen since the original broadcast. A 14th episode, consisting of an interview between Sagan and [[Ted Turner]], was also produced. This new version of the series was eventually released as a VHS box set. This same re-edited version was also released on 12\" [[LaserDisc]]. Two episodes were released per disc, one episode on each side. The LaserDiscs for the various episodes were sold separately, not in a boxed set (as was done for VHS).\n\n''Cosmos'' was unavailable for many years after its initial release because of copyright issues with the soundtrack music, but when it was released in 2000 on [[DVD region code|worldwide]] [[NTSC]] DVD, subtitles in seven languages<ref>English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] and Japanese</ref> and remastered [[5.1]] sound were included, as well as an alternative music and sound effects track. In 2005, [[The Science Channel]] rebroadcast the series for its 25th anniversary, with updated [[computer graphics]] and film footage, [[digital sound]], and information about relevant scientific discoveries in the intervening 25 years. Despite being shown again on the Science Channel, the total amount of time for the original 13 episodes (780 minutes) was reduced 25% to 585 minutes (45 minutes per episode) in order to make room for commercials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.habitablezone.com/space/messages/496458.html|title=Some of the missing scenes from Cosmos episode 2|date=June 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617221439/http://www.habitablezone.com/space/messages/496458.html|archive-date=June 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051001060701/http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/cosmos.html 25th Anniversary Rebroadcast of ''Cosmos''] on [[The Science Channel]]</ref><ref>[https://www.popmatters.com/tv/reviews/c/cosmos-051020.shtml ''Cosmos'' clips 25th Anniversary Edition] PopMatters Television Review, Bill Gibron, PopMatters, October 20, 2005</ref>\n\nIn a 2009 UK release, [[FremantleMedia|Fremantle Media]] Enterprises digitally restored and remastered the original series as a five-disc DVD set which included bonus science updates. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#191970 |overall= |title= |airdate= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1980|9|28}}\n| ShortSummary    = Carl Sagan opens the program with a description of the cosmos and a \"Ship of the Imagination\" (shaped like a dandelion seed). The ship journeys through the universe's hundred billion [[galaxy|galaxies]], the [[Local Group]], the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]], the [[Orion Nebula]], our [[Solar System]], and finally the planet Earth. [[Eratosthenes]]' successful calculation of the circumference of Earth leads to a description of the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]]. Finally, the \"Ages of Science\" are described, before pulling back to the full span of the [[Cosmic Calendar]]. Note: the revised version of the series adds an introduction by [[Ann Druyan]] to this episode, recorded after Sagan's death, in which she discusses some of the changes that occurred in the years after its broadcast.\n| LineColor       = 191970\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1980|10|5}}\n| ShortSummary    = Sagan discusses the story of the [[Heikegani|Heike crab]] and [[artificial selection]] of crabs resembling [[samurai]] warriors, as an opening into a larger discussion of [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]] (and the pitfalls of [[intelligent design]]). Among the topics are the development of life on the [[Cosmic Calendar]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]]; the function of [[DNA]] in growth; genetic replication, repairs, and [[mutation]]; the common biochemistry of terrestrial organisms; the creation of the molecules of life in the [[Miller\u2013Urey experiment]]; and speculation on alien life (such as [[Jupiter#Possibility of life|life in Jupiter's clouds]]). In the ''Cosmos Update'' ten years later, Sagan remarks on [[RNA]] also controlling chemical reactions and reproducing itself and the different roles of comets (potentially carrying organic molecules or causing the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]]).\n| LineColor       = 191970\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Harmony of the Worlds\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1980|10|12}}\n| ShortSummary    = Beginning with the separation of the fuzzy thinking and pious fraud of [[astrology]] from the careful observations of [[astronomy]], Sagan follows the development of astronomical observation. Beginning with [[constellation]]s and ceremonial calendars (such as those of the [[Anasazi]]), the story moves to the debate between Earth and Sun-centered models: [[Ptolemy]] and the [[geocentric model|geocentric]] worldview, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' theory, the data-gathering of [[Tycho Brahe]], and the achievements of [[Johannes Kepler]] ([[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] and the [[Somnium (novel)|first science-fiction novel]]).\n| LineColor       = 191970\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = Heaven and Hell\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1980|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Sagan discusses [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s as planetary impactors, giving recent examples of the [[Tunguska event]] and a [[Giordano Bruno (crater)#Formation|lunar impact]] described by [[Canterbury]] monks in 1178.

G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'', [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' science fiction books, and [[Percival Lowell]]'s false vision of [[Martian canals|canals on Mars]]). It then moves to [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard's]] early experiments in [[rocket]]-building, inspired by reading science fiction, and the work by [[List of planetary probes#Mars probes|Mars probes]], including the [[Viking probes|Viking]], searching for [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]. The episode ends with the possibility of the [[terraforming of Mars|terraforming]] and [[colonization of Mars|colonization]] of Mars and a ''Cosmos Update'' on the relevance of Mars' environment to Earth's and the possibility of a [[human mission to Mars]].\n| LineColor       = 191970\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Travellers' Tales\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1980|11|2}}\n| ShortSummary    = The journeys of the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes is put in the context of the [[Renaissance in the Low Countries|Netherlands in the seventeenth century]], with a centuries-long tradition of [[sailing ship]] explorers, and its contemporary thinkers (such as [[Constantijn Huygens]] and his son [[Christiaan Huygens|Christian]]). Their discoveries are compared to the Voyager probes' discoveries among the [[Jupiter's natural satellites|Jovian]] and [[Saturn's natural satellites|Saturn systems]]. Sagan was a member of the Voyager research team, and production of the episode coincided with the probes arriving at Jupiter; at one point, Sagan is filmed receiving one of the first-ever images of one of Jupiter's moons. In ''Cosmos Update'', [[image processing]] reconstructs Voyager's worlds and Voyager's last portrait of the Solar System as it leaves is shown.\n| LineColor       = 191970\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = The Backbone of Night\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1980|11|9}}\n| ShortSummary    = Carl Sagan teaches students in a classroom in his childhood home in [[Brooklyn]], New York, which leads into a history of the different mythologies about stars and the gradual revelation of their true nature. In ancient Greece, some philosophers ([[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Thales of Miletus]], [[Anaximander]], [[Theodorus of Samos]], [[Empedocles]], [[Democritus]]) freely pursue scientific knowledge, while others ([[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]]) advocate slavery and [[epistemic]] secrecy. During the episode, Sagan intricately referred the discovery of [[Shapley supercluster]] in the aftermath of first world war and correctly gives the students the prediction that astronomers will confirm the existence of [[exoplanet]]s within their lifetime.\n| LineColor       = 191970\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| Title           = Journeys in Space and Time\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1980|11|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = Ideas about time and space are explored in the changes that [[constellation]]s undergo over time, the [[redshift]] and [[blueshift]] measured in interstellar objects, [[time dilation]] in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], the designs of both [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and spacecraft that could travel near [[light speed]], [[time travel]] and its hypothetical effects on human history, the origins of the [[Solar System]], the history of life, and the immensity of space. Propping the curiosity about speed of light, Sagan suggested the possibility from the practical projects of the 20th century by British Interplanetary Society marking the beginning of interstellar travel with the projects named [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] and [[Project Daedalus]]. Although Project Orion was discontinued as a result of nuclear disarmament treaties, Project Daedalus pioneered the idea of using nuclear fusion rather than fission for a viable interstellar spacecraft. In ''Cosmos Update'', the idea of [[faster-than-light]] travel by [[wormhole]]s (researched by [[Kip Thorne]] and shown in Sagan's novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'') is discussed.\n| LineColor       = 191970\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| Title           = The Lives of the Stars\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1980|11|23}}\n| ShortSummary    = The simple act of making an apple pie is extrapolated into the [[atom]]s and subatomic particles ([[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s) necessary. Many of the ingredients necessary are formed of chemical elements formed in the life and deaths of stars (such as our own Sun), resulting in massive [[red giant]]s and [[supernova]]e or collapsing into [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[pulsar]]s, and even [[black hole]]s. These produce all sorts of phenomena, such as [[radioactivity]], [[cosmic ray]]s, and even the curving of [[spacetime]] by gravity.

The search into other ideas such as [[dark matter]] and the [[multiverse]] is shown, using tools such as the [[Very Large Array]] in [[New Mexico]].
