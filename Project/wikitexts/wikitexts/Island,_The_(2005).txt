It stars [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], and [[Steve Buscemi]]. The film is about Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor), who struggles to fit into the highly structured world in which he lives, isolated in a compound, and the series of events that unfold when he questions how truthful that world is. After Lincoln learns the compound inhabitants are clones used for [[organ harvesting]] as well as [[Surrogacy|surrogates]] for wealthy people in the outside world, he attempts to escape with Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) and expose the illegal cloning movement.\n\n''The Island'' has been described as a [[pastiche]] of \"escape-from-[[dystopia]]\" science fiction films of the 1960s and 1970s, such as ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'', ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[Parts: The Clonus Horror]]'', and ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]''.  ''The Island'' cost $126 million to produce. The original score was composed by [[Steve Jablonsky]], who went on to score Bay's further works. It opened on July 22, 2005 by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] in North America and internationally by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], to mixed reviews, earning $36 million at the United States box office and $127 million overseas for a $162 million worldwide total.\n\n==Plot==\nOn July 19, 2019, Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta live with others in an isolated compound. This [[dystopian]]<ref name=\"Chang\" /> community is governed by a strict set of rules. The residents are told that the outside world has become too contaminated to support life with the exception of a pathogen-free island. Each week, one resident gets to leave the compound and live on the island by way of a lottery.\n\nLincoln begins having dreams that he knows are not from his own experiences. Dr. Merrick, a scientist who runs the compound, is concerned and places probes in Lincoln's body to monitor his cerebral activity. While secretly visiting an off-limits power facility in the basement where technician James McCord works, Lincoln discovers a live moth in a ventilation shaft, leading him to deduce the outside world is not really contaminated. Lincoln follows the moth to another section, where he discovers the \"lottery\" is actually a system to selectively remove inhabitants from the compound, where the \"winner\" is then used for [[organ harvesting]], [[surrogacy|surrogate pregnancies]], and other important purposes for each one's wealthy sponsor, of whom they are clones.\n\nMerrick learns Lincoln has discovered the truth about his existence, which forces Lincoln to escape. Meanwhile, Jordan has been selected for the island. Lincoln and Jordan escape the facility and emerge in the desert. Lincoln explains the truth to her, and they set out to discover the real world. Merrick hires [[Burkina Faso|Burkinab\u00e9]] mercenary and former [[GIGN]] operative Albert Laurent to find and return them to the compound.\n\nLincoln and Jordan find McCord, who explains that all the facility residents are clones of wealthy sponsors and are kept ignorant about the real world and conditioned to never question their environment or history. McCord provides the name of Lincoln's sponsor, automobile designer Tom Lincoln, in Los Angeles and helps them to the Yucca [[maglev]] station, where they board an [[Amtrak]] train to LA before mercenaries kill him. In New York City, Jordan's sponsor, supermodel Sarah Jordan, is comatose following a car crash and requires transplants from Jordan to survive. Lincoln also meets Tom, who gives him some explanation about the cloning institute, causing Lincoln to realize that he has gained Tom's memories. Tom seemingly agrees to help Lincoln and Jordan reveal Merrick's crimes to the public, but secretly betrays them to Merrick and Laurent, as he desperately needs Lincoln's liver to survive his cirrhosis. Tricking Lincoln into leaving with him, Tom brings him to an ambush that results in a car chase through suburban LA and ends with Lincoln tricking Laurent into believing Tom is the clone and killing him, allowing him to assume Tom's identity. Returning to Tom's home, Lincoln and Jordan give in to their romantic urges and have sex.\n\nMerrick surmises that a cloning defect was responsible for Lincoln's memories and behavior, resulting in him and every future clone generation to question their environment and even tap into their sponsor's memories. To prevent this, he decides to eliminate the four latest generations of clones. Lincoln and Jordan, however, plan to liberate the other clones. Posing as Tom, Lincoln returns to the compound to destroy the [[holographic projector]]s that conceal the outside world. Jordan allows herself to be caught to assist Lincoln's plan. Laurent, who has moral qualms about the clones' treatment after witnessing their fight for survival and learning that Sarah Jordan may not survive even with the organ transplants, helps Jordan. Lincoln kills Merrick with a [[Harpoon cannon|harpoon gun]], and the clones are freed, seeing the outside world for the first time. As Laurent seemingly gives up his mercenary life, Lincoln and Jordan sail away in one of Tom's boats together toward an island, fulfilling their dream of one day going to such a place.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Tom Lincoln/Lincoln Six-Echo\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Sarah Jordan/Jordan Two-Delta\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as Albert Laurent\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Dr. Merrick\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Jamal Starkweather/Starkweather Two-Delta\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as James \"Mac\" McCord\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Charles Whitman\n* [[Ethan Phillips]] as Jones Three-Echo\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Rhyolite Cook Bank.jpg|thumb|220px|Ruins in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]]]]\nPrincipal photography for The Island began on October 24, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Island begins principal photography |url=https://www.michaelbay.com/2004/10/25/the-island-begins-principal-photography/ |publisher=MichaelBay.com |access-date=July 30, 2018 |year=2004}}</ref> The ruined buildings where Jordan and Lincoln sleep after leaving the subterranean compound are in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]].
