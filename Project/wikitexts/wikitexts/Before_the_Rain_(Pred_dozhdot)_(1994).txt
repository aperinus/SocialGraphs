The sophisticated interplay of three seemingly unrelated short narratives and the emotional effect of the masterful directing were highly praised by the reviews and festivals, and appreciated by audiences in more than 50 countries.\n\n==Plot==\nSet against the background of political turbulence in Macedonia and contemporary London, three love stories intertwine to create a powerful portrait of modern Europe in Milcho Manchevski\u2019s Before The Rain.\n\nWhen a mysterious incident in the fabled Macedonian mountains blows out of proportion, it threatens to start a civil war, and brings together a silent young monk, a London picture editor, and a disillusioned war photographer in this tragic tale of fated lovers. Told in three parts, and linked by characters and events, Before The Rain explores the uncompromising nature of war as it ravages the lives of \u00a0the unsuspecting, and forces the innocent to take sides.\n\n===Story notes===\nUpon watching the film, the viewer sees that the sequence of sections could have been any of three (Words, Faces, Pictures; Faces, Pictures, Words; or Pictures, Words, Faces). An intended inconsistency becomes apparent. The end of ''Words'' shows Zamira gunned down and killed by her family when she tries to escape them. Still photos of the scene are shown in ''Faces''.  Suddenly the reappearance of Zamira's photo and Kiril's voice (in a telephone call) in ''Pictures,'' coupled with the ending, which returns to the beginning, could temporarily hoodwink the viewer that this is the first part of the film. But a close observation of the man lying dead near the beginning of ''Words'' shows he is Aleksandar Kirkov, while Zamira is hiding in Kirill's after having killed one of the Macedonians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://manchevski.com/docs/2america.gif|title=Balkan Homecoming|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220940/http://manchevski.com/docs/2america.gif|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Faces,'' set in London, has a living Aleksandar Kirkov, whose close friend Anne is developing black-and-white pictures of a dead Zamira. The motto of the film is, \"The Circle is not Round.\"  The message is written as graffiti on a wall shown in ''Pictures'' and is repeated in the other two parts by Father Marko. The director suggests that in life, people and places may change, but overshadowing scenarios (such as conflicts) go backward and forward in a cycle.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Katrin Cartlidge]] as Anne\n*[[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Aleksandar\n*[[Gr\u00e9goire Colin]] as Kiril\n*[[Labina Mitevska]] as Zamira\n*Jay Villiers as Nick\n*Silvija Stojanovska as Hana\n*[[Phyllida Law]] as Anne's Mother\n*Josif Josifovski as Father Marko\n*Kiril Ristoski as Father Damjan\n*Petar Mir\u010devski as Zdrave\n*Ljup\u010do Bresliski as Mitre\n*Igor Mad\u017eirov as Stojan\n*Ilko Stefanovski as Bojan\n*Suzana Kirand\u017eiska as Neda\n*Katerina Kocevska as Kate\n*Abdurahman Shalja as Zekir\n*Vladimir Ja\u010dev as Ali\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nOne of the main points of focus in the film is the ethnic clash that existed between [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Macedonian people|Macedonians]] and the [[Albanians in Macedonia|Albanian Muslim minority]] in the early 1990s. It offers a view on how sociocultural norms and mechanisms can give rise to [[nationalism]] that grows into phobia of the foreign. Additionally, through the character of Aleksandar, the film offers a view of the \"cultural shock\" and foreignness he experiences upon reintegrating and returning to his home country after being away.<ref name=\"katarzyna\">{{cite journal|title=Transnational Anatomies of Exile and Abject|first=Katarzyna|last=Marciniak|journal=Cinema Journal|publisher=University of Texas Press|pages=63\u201384|year=2003|issue=42|doi=10.1353/cj.2003.0025}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \nThe creation of the film served partly as a homecoming for Manchevski, who had lived in New York City since the 1980s.<ref name=\"cineint\">{{cite journal |last1=Manchevski |first1=Milcho |last2=Horton |first2=Andrew |title=Cinema Across the Oceans: An Interview with Milcho Manchevski |journal=Cin\u00e9aste |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=45 |jstor=41687391 |year=1995 }}</ref> That said, the film was initially not set in Macedonia.
