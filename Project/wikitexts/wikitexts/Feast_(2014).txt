James, the man who dropped the fry, offers a second one to the puppy and decides to adopt him as his pet. James names him Winston and begins feeding him portions of his own meals and junk food in addition to regular kibble.\n\nOne day, James begins a relationship with Kirby, a waitress at a local restaurant. She persuades him to take up a healthier diet and lifestyle, but the change upsets Winston as the leftovers James slips to him now consist of vegetables, which disgust him. However, the couple break up after an argument, sending James into a deep depression and causing him to revert to his old eating habits. Winston is initially gleeful to eat junk food again, but he soon recognizes James's low spirits. Seeing a piece of [[parsley]] that has reminded James of Kirby and the meals they used to prepare together, Winston decides to bring them back together and steals it, leading to a chase as he brings it to Kirby and overcomes several temptations of delicious food. James follows Winston to the restaurant, where he reconciles with Kirby, and the two marry soon afterward. Winston, relieved that his master is happy again, is initially content to eat normal [[dog food]].\n\nSome time after the couple have moved into a new house, Winston spots a couple of [[meatball]]s that have rolled across the kitchen floor and eats them. Following the trail of sauce they have left behind, he reaches the base of a high chair occupied by the couple's infant child, who happily throws another meatball to him. As the film ends, Winston gets ready to feast on a tray of [[cupcake]]s knocked off a table by a guest at the baby's first birthday party.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Ben Bledsoe]]<ref name=MWFeastPreview>{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=Brian|title=Disney's 'Feast' Preview Introduces Winston the Dog|url=http://www.movieweb.com/disney-feast-movie-animated-short-preview|publisher=MovieWeb|access-date=November 16, 2014|date=October 16, 2014}}</ref>\n* Stewart Levine<ref name=MWFeastPreview />\n* [[Katie Lowes]]<ref name=MWFeastPreview />\n* [[Brandon Scott (actor)|Brandon Scott]]<ref name=MWFeastPreview />\n* Adam Shapiro<ref name=MWFeastPreview />\n* Tommy Snider<ref name=MWFeastPreview />\n* Stephen Apostolina\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{multiple image\n|align = right\n|image1=Patrick Osborne.jpg\n|width1={{#expr: (175 *788 / 1052) round 0}}\n|image2=Kristina Reed.jpg\n|width2={{#expr: (175 *681 / 973) round 0}}\n|footer=Director Patrick Osborne and producer Kristina Reed premiered the short at the 2014 [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]]\n}}\nPrior to working on ''Feast'', Patrick Osborne was co-head of animation on ''Big Hero 6''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feast: Patrick Osborne|url=http://waltdisneystudiosawards.com/#/feast/filmmakers/patrick-osborne|publisher=Disney|access-date=December 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110121818/http://waltdisneystudiosawards.com/#/feast/filmmakers/patrick-osborne|archive-date=November 10, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The idea for the short film started from an [[Mobile app|app]] called 1secondeveryday, which allows a user to record 1-second-long video snippets each day and cut them into a movie.<ref name=3dartist/> Osborne used the app to create a film of dinners he ate in 2012, which he thought could form the basis for a nice short film.<ref name=3dartist>{{cite news|last1=Mori|first1=Larissa|title=The making of Disney's new animated short: 'Feast'|url=http://www.3dartistonline.com/news/2014/10/the-making-of-disneys-new-animated-short-feast/|access-date=December 2, 2014|work=3D Artist|publisher=Imagine Publishing|date=October 9, 2014}}</ref><ref name=buzz/>\n\nFollowing the previous Walt Disney Animation Studios short films ''[[Paperman]]'' and ''[[Get a Horse!]]'', the studio decided to formalize a program for pitching shorts.

The filmmakers wanted a breed that does not appear in any prior Disney film. The breed is small so that he can be shown being promoted to a chair at the table and demoted back to the floor.
