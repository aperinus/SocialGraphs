It was written by [[Hanif Kureishi]] from his short story ''[[My Son the Fanatic]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot of the film revolves around Parvez, a Pakistani-born taxi driver and a tolerant, secular Muslim. His life takes an unexpected dark turn when his son Farid converts to fundamentalist Islam, leading to  a family breakdown and social conflict.\n\nAccording to Rachel Donadio, ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer and editor, the film's theme is encapsulated in a pivotal scene:\n\n<blockquote>One of the most revealing insights into Britain's recent social history comes early in ''My Son the Fanatic'', Hanif Kureishi's tender and darkly prescient 1997 film. It\u2019s morning in an unnamed city in northern England, and Parvez, a secular Pakistani immigrant taxi driver brilliantly portrayed by Om Puri, watches Farid, his increasingly devout college-age son, sell his electric guitar. \"Where is that going?\" Parvez asks Farid as the buyer drives off. \"You used to love making a terrible noise with these instruments!\" Farid, played by Akbar Kurtha, looks at his father with irritation. \"You always said there were more important things than 'Stairway to Heaven'\" he says impatiently in his thick northern English accent. \"You couldn't have been more right\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/magazine/10kureishi-t.html|date=8 August 2008|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|title=My Beautiful London|magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]]}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Om Puri]] as Parvez: an alcoholic Pakistani taxi driver who after living in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for many years is still working hard to make a living in his taxi whilst others who migrated with him have become wealthy.\n*[[Rachel Griffiths]] as Bettina/Sandra: a woman who goes by the name of Bettina who does sex work and has become friends with Parvez.
