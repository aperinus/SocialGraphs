The film also stars [[Demi Moore]], along with [[Tom Skerritt]] and [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Estevez's parents. The ending credits song is \"Home Again\" by [[Oingo Boingo]] and the score by [[Danny Elfman]].\n\nThe film is dedicated to the memory of Henry Proach, who was a good friend of Estevez, and who appears briefly in the picture.\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Wisdom is a young man just out of college. On the night of his high school graduation, he had gotten drunk and stolen a car.\n\nWith a [[Motor vehicle theft|grand theft auto]] conviction he is branded a [[Felony|felon]] and as a result can not hold down a decent job. Seeing no future for himself, Wisdom takes a left turn: he decides to become a criminal \"for the people\", evocative of [[Robin Hood]].\n\nAfter seeing news reports about impoverished [[farmer]]s and [[working class]] people being sent to the bank to pay ownership debts, Wisdom goes on a [[Bank robbery|bank robbing]] spree with his girlfriend, Karen Simmons. He planned to do it alone, but she insists giving him a ride on the first job, so inadvertantly becomes his accomplice.\n\nThey don't steal money, but rather erase loan and mortgage records, buying time for the poor to pay their debts. At a small motel, the owner recognises them. Not able to keep it to himself, he and half a dozen people come to thank them, bearing gifts. Among them is a new vehicle.\n\nWith the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] after them, things take a turn for the worse. At the motel they'd been staying at they shoot it up, only to find Wisdom and Karen have already gone.\n\nUnfortunately, a panicky Karen kills a local [[sheriff]] who recognises her in a convenience store. She and Wisdom make a run for the [[Canada\u2013United States border]], but when Karen is shot by a police helicopter, Wisdom leaves her in the care of some high school students and their teacher.\n\nWisdom resumes his flight on foot on the school grounds, first unloading his gun before he is surrounded by police and federal agents at the football field. As he appears to be reaching for his gun, he is riddled with gunfire and dies.\n\nJohn wakes up where the film started, in his parents' bathroom. He emerges from the bathtub and proceeds to get ready for his job interview. His entire story has apparently been a daydream.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as John Wisdom\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Karen Simmons\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Lloyd Wisdom\n* [[Veronica Cartwright]] as Samantha Wisdom\n* [[William Allen Young]] as Agent Williamson\n* Richard Minchenberg as Agent Cooper\n* [[Ernie Lively|Ernie Brown]] as Bill, Motel manager\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as City Burger manager\n* Brenda Medcalf as Girl on bike\n\n==Production==\nEstevez says the idea for the film \"started as just the title. I thought it would be great visually. Just 'Wisdom' across the screen.\"<ref name=\"globe\">{{cite news|author=Danahy, M.|date=Oct 31, 1986|title=Emilio estevez is running with a new crowd these days young actor leaves brat pack behind|work=The Globe and Mail|id={{ProQuest|386337836}}}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote the first draft in three weeks. Wisdom became the surname of the lead character. Estevez says Wisdom is \"without a place in society... He becomes a criminal because he feels it's the only thing society has left him to do.\"<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nEstevez added at the film was basically \"about two people \u2013 their relationship and their discoveries. Those discoveries leave Wisdom not only wanted dead or alive in five states, but also a modern-day folk hero.\"<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nIn October 1985 [[David Begelman]]'s Gladden Entertainment announced it had signed a deal with the 23 year old Estevez to write, produce and direct ''Wisdom''. Estevez had previously written ''That Was Then This is Now''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mathews, J.|date=Oct 16, 1985|title=A 'BIG BRASS RING' THAT ELUDED WELLES' GRASP|work=Los Angeles Times|id={{ProQuest|292159612}}}}</ref> Begelman had been in charge of Columbia, and MGM, during which time he gave [[Walter Hill]], [[Barry Levinson]] and [[Richard Benjamin]] their first directing jobs.<ref>{{cite news|date=Oct 16, 1985|title=Hollywood \"brat' scores movie hat trick|work=Toronto Star|id={{ProQuest|435352337}}}}</ref>\n\nComparisons were made with [[Orson Welles]] who was 24 when he wrote, produced and directed ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Estevez said \"if they promote ''Wisdom'' as this most phenomenal thing that hasn't happened since [[Orson Welles]], I'm going to get hit.\"<ref name=\"tempo\">{{cite news|author=Blau, R.|date=Oct 31, 1985|title=Tempo|work=Chicago Tribune|id={{ProQuest|176407418}}}}</ref>\n\n\"I have a kind of nihilistic point of view\", he added. \"I'm into making films that are realistic and not fluff. When you deal in reality, you're dealing with a lot of serious problems. We could be sitting here and now and being vaporized by nuclear weapons by accidentally. That's reality... Life does not end happily ever after.\"<ref name=\"tempo\"/>\n\nThe female lead went to [[Demi Moore]] who was then Estevez's fianc\u00e9e. (The two met while making ''St Elmo's Fire''.)<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say it was the most positive professional move for me when I made that picture\", she said later. \"Of course, doing it was based on my feelings for him and my desire to share it with him. It was very special. I was around from the day Emilio wrote the first page. I would read every page, and we would talk. The attachment to the project was real.\"<ref name=\"demi\">{{cite news|author=Portman, J.|date=Mar 31, 1988|title=Ex-brat packer has new life and new film|work=The Ottawa Citizen|id={{ProQuest|239127412}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Gladden Entertainment Company suggested [[Robert Wise]] be hired to work as \"executive director\" (mentor) and Estevez agreed. Wise said, \"I was there to be an aid to him if he wanted to discuss something or whether he felt this kind of angle or editing standpoint was a good one, whether the different angles in a scene were enough coverage. I didn't ever step in when he was staging a scene. Then if I saw something that bothered me, I would get him aside and say, 'Be careful of this or watch for that. Be careful, I think you have her looking the wrong way in this shot.' Mainly technical things. We would discuss the pacing of scenes. And that would be primarily it.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Gelder, L. V.|date=May 16, 1986|title=AT THE MOVIES|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|425876216}}}}</ref>\n\nThe film was finished $200,000 under budget and a day ahead of schedule.<ref name=\"globe\"/>\n\nIt was one of the first film scores from [[Danny Elfman]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Lewis, R.|date=Oct 31, 1986|title=OINGO BOINGO TO ENERGIZE MEADOWS|work=Los Angeles Times|id={{ProQuest|292415513}}}}</ref>\n\n\"In a way, it's a very subversive film\", Estevez said. \"A lot of people are angered by the message it gives the kids: If you want something changed, then pick up a gun and change it. But if they stay until the end, they'll realize that violence doesn't solve anything. I'm going to take a beating on this one. \"I can see myself getting my feet wet as a director, and there's a choppiness, an awkwardness to it. It's not totally relaxed. I made the movie first for myself, and I think just getting it done is an accomplishment. I fought my battle in just getting it done, and being the youngest person to get it done. Not that I set out to break any kind of record or anything, or to prove to anybody that I could do it.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Haithamn, D.|date=Jan 7, 1987|title=Young actor-director prepared to take a beating on new film|work=The Ottawa Citizen|id={{ProQuest|238997561}}}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews from critics: [[Leonard Maltin]] considered it \"wretchedly scripted, with one of the most self-defeating wrap-ups you'll ever see.\"<ref>Maltin's TV, Movie, & Video Guide</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url= https://cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= CinemaScore |access-date= March 22, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= December 20, 2018 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nEstevez later said the film \"was a very disappointing experience \u2013 the outcome of it. I shouldn't say disappointing. I should say devastating \u2013 the response, how it was received. I tell you what: It was not a great film, but it was a good film. And I believe that now... I think if I show an area of weakness, it's in the writing and in the structure of my writing. I think I need to get an objective point of view.\" \"<ref>{{cite news|author=WILLISTEIN, P.|date=Aug 8, 1987|title=EMILIO ESTEVEZ GROWS UP|work=Morning Call|id={{ProQuest|392248663}}}}</ref>\n\nMoore and Estevez broke up not long after the film's release. She later recalled \"there was a strong lash-out against Emilio. I can't get in the skins of those people who wrote what they wrote... I thought he did a great job and that his directing was very strong for someone who had never done this before.\"<ref name=\"demi\"/>\n\n\"I took a beating from critics and I took it personally\", said Estevez later. \"I was broken for a period of time. But I've learned you really can't take it personally. . . . Making a film at that age was winning the battle. Having it released was icing on the cake.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Heller, M.|date=Aug 26, 1988|title=BILLY THE KID ROLE IS WELL SUITED TO HOLLYWOOD YOUNG GUN ESTEVEZ|work=Orlando Sentinel|id={{ProQuest|277447365}}}}</ref>\n\nEstevez added \"I learned that you don't go into a project with a script that's not ready. You've got to have all the bugs worked out before you start... I also learned how to be more economical with my shots and with my time... [I was] like a kid in a candy store. When you're 23 and somebody hands you $4.5 million and tells you to go out and make a film, there will be some excesses.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Barry Koltnow|date=Aug 1, 1990|title=A break from the pack while many of his peers struggle with negative publicity, emilio estevez forges ahead with 'Young guns II' and his second outing as a director|work=Orange County Register|id={{ProQuest|272479838}}}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2009, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''Wisdom'' on DVD through its \"Warner Archive\" burn-on-demand service.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[1986 in film]]\n* [[Cinema of the United States]]\n* [[List of American films of 1986]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0092225|Wisdom}}\n* {{mojo title|wisdom|Wisdom}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|wisdom}}\n\n{{Emilio Estevez}}\n\n[[Category:1986 crime films]]\n[[Category:1986 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1986 films]]\n[[Category:1986 independent films]]\n[[Category:1986 romance films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American crime films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American romance films]]\n[[Category:Films about bank robbery]]\n[[Category:Films about dreams]]\n[[Category:Films about the Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Emilio Estevez]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Danny Elfman]]\n[[Category:Films set in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Golan-Globus films]]\n[[Category:Romantic crime films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Robert Wise]]"}]}}}}
