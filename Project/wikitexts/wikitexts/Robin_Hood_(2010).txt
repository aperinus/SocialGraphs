Casting Crowe in the title role, Ridley Scott was hired to direct later that same year. Rewrites delayed the film throughout 2008, with [[Brian Helgeland]] hired to rewrite the screenplay, which saw a refocus of the story to be about Robin Hood once again, abandoning the Nottingham angle entirely. Filming commenced in March 2009 throughout [[England]] and [[Wales]].\n\n''Robin Hood'' held its world premiere at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]] the same day as its [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] releases. It was then released on 14 May 2010 in [[North America]]. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $321.7 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Anchor|Premise}}\nIn 1199, [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride]] serves as a common [[archery|archer]] in the army of [[King Richard the Lionheart]]. A veteran of [[Third Crusade|Richard's crusade]], he now takes part in the siege of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol|Chalus Castle]]. Disillusioned and war-weary, he gives a frank but unflattering appraisal of the King's conduct when the King asks for it, and Robin and his comrades\u2014archers [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A'Dayle]] and [[Will Scarlett]] and soldier [[Little John]]\u2014are locked in the [[stocks]].\n\nAfter the King is killed during an attack on the castle, Robin and his comrades manage to free themselves and desert. They come across an ambush of the English royal guard by Godfrey, an English knight who has conspired with [[Philip II of France|King Philip of France]] to assassinate King Richard. After chasing Godfrey away, Robin takes advantage of the situation impersonating the dead English knights to return to England. Before they depart to sail across the Channel, he promises a dying knight, Sir Robert Loxley, to return his sword to his father in [[Nottingham]].\n\nAwaking to find their ship arrived in the Thames estuary, Robin must continue to assume the identity of Loxley to inform the royal family of King Richard's death. He witnesses the coronation of [[John, King of England|King John]], who orders the collection of harsh new taxes. [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] since the days of John's [[Henry II of England|father]], opposes the new taxes and is relieved of his position by John. The new king dispatches Godfrey to the [[Northern England|North]] to collect the taxes\u2014unaware that Godfrey will instead use French troops to stir up unrest and prepare for King Philip to invade England. In secret, spies working for Marshal follow Godfrey's men and learn of the planned invasion of England.\n\nRobin and his companions head to Nottingham, where Loxley's elderly and blind father, Sir Walter, asks him to continue impersonating his son to prevent the Crown from seizing the Loxley family lands. Loxley's widow, [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]], is initially cold toward Robin, but warms to him when he and his men recover grain for the townsfolk to plant.\n\nGodfrey's actions incite the northern barons, who march to meet King John. Speaking now for Sir Walter, Robin proposes that King John agree to a [[Magna Carta|charter of rights]] to ensure the rights of every Englishman and to unite his country. Realising Godfrey's deception, and knowing he must meet the French invasion with an army, the King agrees. Meanwhile, French marauders plunder Nottingham. Robin and the northern barons arrive to stop Godfrey's men, but not before Godfrey has slain the blind Sir Walter.\n\nAs the main French expeditionary force begins its invasion of England on a beach below the [[cliffs of Dover]], Robin leads the now united English army against them. In the midst of the battle, Robin duels with Godfrey, who attempts to kill Marian and flees until Robin finally kills him with an arrow from afar. King Philip realises that his plan to divide England has failed and calls off his invasion. When King John sees the French surrendering to Robin instead of to himself, he senses a threat to his power.\n\nIn London, King John reneges on his promise to sign the charter and declares Robin an [[outlaw]] to be hunted throughout the kingdom. The [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] announces the decree, and Robin and his men flee to [[Sherwood Forest]] with the orphans of Nottingham. Marian narrates their new life in the greenwood, noting that they live in equality as they right the many wrongs in the kingdom of King John. \"And so the legend begins.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride]]\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Maid Marian|Marion Loxley]]\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Sir Walter Loxley\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]]\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Godfrey\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[John, King of England|Prince John]]\n* [[Danny Huston]] as [[King Richard the Lionheart]]\n* [[Eileen Atkins]] as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\n* [[Mark Addy]] as [[Friar Tuck]]\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[Sheriff of Nottingham]]\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as [[Little John]]\n* [[Scott Grimes]] as [[Will Scarlet]]\n* [[Alan Doyle]] as [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A'Dayle]]\n* [[Douglas Hodge]] as Sir Robert Loxley\n* [[L\u00e9a Seydoux]] as [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]]\n* [[Jonathan Zacca\u00ef]] as [[Philip II of France|King Philip of France]]\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Baron Baldwin\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as [[Walter Fitz Robert|Baron Fitzrobert]]\n* [[Velibor Topi\u0107]] as Belvedere\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as Father Tancred\n* [[Denise Gough]] as Village Mother\n* [[Pip Carter]] as Royal Equery\n* [[Mark Lewis Jones]] as Stone Mason Longstride\n* [[Bronson Webb]] as Jimoen\n* [[Denis M\u00e9nochet]] as Adhemar\n* [[John Atterbury]] as Exchequer\n* [[Luke Evans]] as Sheriff's Thug\n* [[Roy Holder]] as Gaffer Tom\n* [[Jessica Raine]] as [[Isabella, Countess of Gloucester|Princess Isabel of Gloucester]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and pre-production===\n[[File:Sheriff of Nottingham.PNG|thumb|left|100px|Earlier drafts of the script featured a bigger, more sympathetic focus on the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], with one idea being Robin Hood beginning as the Sheriff.]]\nIn January 2007, [[Universal Studios]] and [[Brian Grazer]]'s [[Imagine Entertainment]] acquired a [[spec script]] written by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris, creators of the TV series ''[[Sleeper Cell (TV series)|Sleeper Cell]]''.
