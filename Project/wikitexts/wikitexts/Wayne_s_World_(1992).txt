It was also produced by [[Lorne Michaels]] and written by [[Mike Myers]] and [[Bonnie and Terry Turner|Bonnie & Terry Turner]]. Based on the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch ''[[Wayne's World]]'', it stars Myers in his feature film debut as Wayne Campbell and [[Dana Carvey]] as Garth Algar, a pair of [[rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans who broadcast a [[public-access television|public-access television show]]. It also features [[Tia Carrere]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Ed O'Neill]], [[Ione Skye]], [[Meat Loaf]], and [[Alice Cooper]] in supporting roles.\n\n''Wayne's World'' was released in the United States on February 14, 1992, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. A critical and commercial success, it was the [[1992 in film#Highest-grossing films|tenth-highest-grossing film of 1992]] and remains the highest-grossing [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch]]. ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'' was released the following year.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Aurora, Illinois]], [[rock music]] fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World'', from Wayne's parents' basement; a broadcast of ''Wayne's World'' catches the attention of television producer Benjamin Kane. While out cruising with friends in Garth's car, the [[AMC Pacer#In popular culture|Mirthmobile]], Wayne stops to admire a 1964 [[Fender Stratocaster]] in a shop window. They later go to a nightclub, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy while Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his [[Cantonese]].\n\nBenjamin meets with Wayne and Garth to convince them to sell him the rights to the show for $5,000 each, which Wayne uses to purchase the Stratocaster. Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne using his wealth and good looks by distracting Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an [[Alice Cooper]] concert in [[Milwaukee]] while offering to produce a [[music video]] for Crucial Taunt. At the show, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records.\n\nWhile filming the revamped ''Wayne's World'' under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find adjusting to the professional studio environment challenging. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of [[amusement arcade|amusement arcades]]. After Wayne ridicules Vanderhoff on the show, he is fired, leaving Garth to host the show on his own. This infuriates Garth and jeopardizes their friendship. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot, and she breaks up with him for his distrust.\n\nWayne and Garth reconcile and hatch a scheme to win Cassandra back by getting her a record deal. They plan to ensure that Frankie Sharp hears Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive. Cassandra initially tells him to go home, but realizing Benjamin is up to no good, she changes her mind and leaves for Aurora with Wayne while he apologizes.\n\nThe ''Wayne's World'' crew hacks into Sharp's satellite television and broadcasts the Crucial Taunt performance from Wayne's basement, where Sharp and Benjamin converge. Unfortunately, Sharp declines to offer Crucial Taunt a record contract. As a result, Cassandra breaks up with Wayne permanently. She and Benjamin depart to a tropical resort. Stacy reveals she is pregnant with Wayne's child. An electrical fire destroys Wayne's house and kills Garth.\n\nDissatisfied with this ending, Wayne and Garth [[Fourth wall|turn to the film's audience and halt proceedings]]; they restart the scene in which Benjamin is unmasked as \"Old Man Withers\" in a ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' parody ending. Still unsatisfied, they restart again with a \"mega happy ending,\" in which Cassandra successfully signs a record contract and rekindles her relationship with Wayne. Garth begins a relationship with a waitress he had fantasized over earlier in the movie, while a reformed Benjamin learns that money and good looks do not necessarily bring happiness.\n\nDuring the credits, Wayne and Garth say they hope the audience didn't think the movie sucked. The duo later predicts the credits will fade to black, which they do.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mike Myers]] as Wayne Campbell, host of ''Wayne's World.''
