It stars [[Dakota Blue Richards]] as [[Lyra Belacqua]], [[Nicole Kidman]] as [[Marisa Coulter]], and [[Daniel Craig]] as [[Lord Asriel]], alongside [[Sam Elliott]], [[Ian McKellen]], and [[Eva Green]]. In the film, Lyra joins a tribe of seafarers on a trip to the far North in search of children kidnapped by the Gobblers, a group supported by the universe's rulers, the Magisterium.\n\nDevelopment on the film was first announced in February 2002, but difficulties over the screenplay and the selection of a director (including Weitz departing and returning) caused significant delays. Richards was cast as Lyra in June 2006, with Kidman and Craig joining soon thereafter. [[Principal photography]] began that September and lasted for several months, with filming locations including [[Shepperton Studios]] and also on location throughout England, Switzerland, and Norway.

''The Golden Compass'' has grossed $372 million worldwide but was a box office disappointment in North America which directly contributed to New Line Cinema's 2008 [[restructuring]].<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news | author=Staff and agencies | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2261033,00.html | title=New Line merged with Warner Bros Pictures |work=The Guardian  | date=February 29, 2008 | location=London}}</ref> The film won for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[80th Academy Awards]] and for [[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects|Best Special Visual Effects]] at the [[61st British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn an alternate [[Retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] Earth ruled by the Magisterium, every person's soul exists outside the body as an [[Power animal|animal companion]], a [[d\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)|d\u00e6mon]].\n\n[[Lyra Belacqua]] is an orphan raised at [[Jordan College, Oxford|Jordan College]] in [[Oxford]] with her d\u00e6mon [[Pantalaimon]] or \"Pan\". Her uncle [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Lord Asriel|Lord Asriel]] returns from seeking the elusive [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]], a cosmic particle the Magisterium forbids to be mentioned. Lyra saves him from wine poisoned by a Magisterium agent, and Asriel presents his discovery that Dust at the North Pole links to infinite worlds. He is granted another expedition though his theory, if proven, could undermine the Magisterium's control.\n\n[[Marisa Coulter|Mrs. Coulter]], a wealthy \"friend\" of the college, invites Lyra to stay with her in [[London]]. The Master of the college entrusts Lyra with her uncle's alethiometer, a compass-like artefact that reveals the truth, warning her to keep it secret. Kidnappers called \"Gobblers\" have been abducting children, including Lyra's friend [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Roger Parslow|Roger]] and Billy Costa, a young [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gyptians|Gyptian]]. Lyra discovers Mrs. Coulter is head of the General [[Oblation]] Board, realising they are the Gobblers, and she and Pan escape when Mrs. Coulter's d\u00e6mon attempts to steal the alethiometer.\n\nLyra is saved from Gobblers by Ma Costa, Billy's mother, and taken to the Gyptian king John Faa, who is sailing north to search for the children. Gyptian elder [[List of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust characters#Farder Coram|Farder Coram]] recognizes the alethiometer, which Lyra discovers she can decipher. In league with the Magisterium, Mrs. Coulter sends mechanical spy-flies after Lyra, but one is caught by Farder Coram. Asriel reaches [[Svalbard]], the kingdom of the Ice Bears, but is captured by [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] tribesmen hired by Mrs. Coulter.\n\nThe witch queen [[Serafina Pekkala]] tells Lyra the children are at [[Locations in His Dark Materials#Bolvangar|Bolvangar]], and Lyra befriends Texan [[aeronaut]] [[Lee Scoresby]], who suggests she hire him and his friend [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]], an [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Armoured Bears (panserbj\u00f8rne)|armoured bear]] he has come to rescue. Once a prince of the bears, Iorek was defeated and exiled, and the townspeople have tricked him out of his armour. Lyra uses the alethiometer to help Iorek recover his armour, and he and Scoresby join the Gyptian trek northward.\n\nLyra, astride Iorek, follows the alethiometer and finds Billy, whom the Gobblers have experimented on using \"[[D\u00e6mon (His Dark Materials)#Intercision|intercision]]\", a procedure that surgically separates him from his d\u00e6mon. The Gyptians are attacked by Samoyeds who capture Lyra, with Iorek and Lee in pursuit in Lee's airship. Lyra is taken to the bear king [[List of His Dark Materials and The Book of Dust characters#Iofur Raknison|Ragnar Sturlusson]], and tricks him into fighting Iorek himself. Ragnar, who poisoned Iorek's father, has the upper hand until Iorek feigns weakness and kills him, reclaiming the throne.\n\nIorek carries Lyra to Bolvangar, but she is forced to cross a narrow ice bridge alone before it collapses. Reaching the experimental station, Lyra reunites with Roger, and overhears Mrs. Coulter say that Asriel will soon be arrested for heresy. Caught by the scientists, Lyra and Pan are thrown into the intercision chamber but rescued by Mrs. Coulter. Explaining that the Magisterium believe intercision protects children from Dust's corrupting influence, Mrs. Coulter admits she is Lyra's mother, and Lyra realises Asriel is her father. Mrs. Coulter asks for the alethiometer, but Lyra gives her the can containing the spy-fly, which tranquilizes Mrs. Coulter unconscious.\n\nDestroying the intercision machine, Lyra leads the children outside. They are confronted by [[Tatars|Tatar]] mercenaries, who are defeated by Iorek, Scoresby, the Gyptians, and flying witches led by Serafina. With the children safe, Lyra, Roger, Iorek, Lee, and Serafina fly north to search for Asriel. Confirming Serafina's prophecy of a coming war with Lyra at its centre, Lyra is determined to fight the Magisterium, who plot to control all other worlds in the universe.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:NicoleKidmanGoldenCompass2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nicole Kidman]] at the film's premiere.]]\n* [[Dakota Blue Richards]] as [[Lyra Belacqua]], who embarks on a voyage to battle the forces of evil and rescue her best friend.
