The motion picture features an [[ensemble cast]] with [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Huey Lewis]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Scott Speedman]], and [[Andre Braugher]] among others.<ref name=\"IMDb\">{{IMDb title|id=0134630|title=Duets}}.</ref> The movie \"revolves around the little known world of [[karaoke]] competitions and the wayward characters who inhabit it.\"<ref name=\"IMDb\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around unrelated pairs of people who spend time in [[karaoke]] bars across the [[United States]] in the week leading up to a big contest in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].\n*Ricky Dean ([[Huey Lewis]]), a [[hustling|hustler]] on the karaoke circuit, travels from town to town feigning ambivalence of karaoke, then winning both the contests and side bets with locals. Detoured by a phone call, he travels to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for the [[funeral]] of an ex; while there, he meets his daughter Liv ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), with whom he hasn't had contact for many years.\n\nSeeking a father figure after her mother's death, Liv joins him against his wishes on the road, both singing solos at karaoke bars. They are involved in a bar fight when one of Ricky's [[Glossary of cue sports terms#mark|marks]] retaliates.\n*[[Depression (mood)|Depressed]] California salesman Todd Woods ([[Paul Giamatti]]), so exhausted from business travel he doesn't even know what city he's in. Arriving home, his wife Candy ([[Kiersten Warren]]) and two children are too self-absorbed to even say hello. He walks out on his family and his old life, driving aimlessly. He wanders into a karaoke bar in [[New Mexico]], where a fellow participant offers [[beta blockers]] to help him overcome his [[anxiety]] and [[stage fright]]. Todd gets hooked on the drugs as he keeps driving.\n\nIn [[Utah]], Todd picks up hitchhiker Reggie Kane ([[Andre Braugher]]), a charismatic but violent [[fugitive]] convict, who recently robbed at gunpoint a truck driver who gave him a lift. They form an unlikely friendship after Reggie reveals a beautiful singing voice during a duet at a karaoke bar. Todd's mental health deteriorates further as Reggie tries to keep him out of trouble; he first has to drag Todd out of a hotel when he threatens the clerk with a gun; then, after he causes a standoff at a service station, Reggie shoots and kills the attendant. Reggie arranges for Candy to meet them in Omaha, but an emotionless Todd rejects her, insisting he is finished with his former life.\n*[[Cincinnati]]-based [[Slacker|underachieving]] cab driver and once aspiring priest Billy ([[Scott Speedman]]) goes on a drinking binge after catching his partner cheating on him. He meets Suzi Loomis ([[Maria Bello]]), a [[Homelessness|broke]] [[Vagrancy (people)|drifter]] who gets by on karaoke contest prizes and sexual favors. Neither respects the other's lifestyle, but Billy nonetheless agrees to drive her to [[California]], stopping at karaoke bars for her to compete along the way.\n\nAll three pairs end up at the Omaha contest, each having won the right to compete there for $5,000 after winning in a smaller town. Finally accepting his daughter, Ricky invites her to perform a duet of her mother's favourite song, \"[[Cruisin' (Smokey Robinson song)#Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis version|Cruisin']]\". Billy discovers that Suzi's has stage fright when he finds her in the ladies' room, vomiting, but he convinces her to compete. Reggie sees the police arrive, investigating the service station shooting. Performing an [[a cappella]] version of \"[[Free Bird]]\", he pulls his gun on stage, prompting police to shoot him; putting the full blame for the service station shooting on Reggie, and freeing Todd to return to his family.\n\nAfter the contest, Billy and Suzi continue on their way to California. Billy invites Liv (with whom he had been flirting at the contest) and Ricky to join them, and they resolve to take a slight detour to another karaoke contest in [[Nevada]]. Todd and Candy fly home together on his frequent flyer miles.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=65%}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] as Liv Dean\n* [[Huey Lewis]] as Ricky Dean\n* [[Maria Bello]] as Suzi Loomis\n* [[Andre Braugher]] as Reggie Kane\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Todd Woods\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as Billy Hannan\n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Ronny Jackson\n* [[Angie Dickinson]] as Blair\n{{col-2}}\n* [[John Pinette]] as Finals singer\n* [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]] as Finals singer\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Omaha Hostess\n* [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] as Shelia\n* [[Kiersten Warren]] as Candy Woods\n* [[Marian Seldes]] as Harriet Gahagan\n* [[Brent Butt]] as Hotel clerk\n* Aaron Pearl as Buddy\n* Steve Oatway as Ralph Beckerman\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\nBruce Paltrow spent several years trying to get the project started.

''Los Angeles Times,'' film review, \"Nothing Much to Sing About,\" September 15, 2000.</ref>\n\nCritic Bob Graham, writing for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', liked the spirit of the film and the acting, and he wrote, \"Cut 'Duets' some slack. This is an appealing, and ultimately moving, ensemble comedy/drama about ordinary folks whose one chance at anything resembling stardom is a karaoke contest...The fable style is a fragile one. The ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' test probably applies here. Fans of that show are likely to give themselves over to ''Duets,'' too.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/09/15/DD67326.DTL Graham, Bob].

She wrote, \"Its three interlocking stories don't find the right rhythmic balance, and some of the dialogue is stiff and mannered.\" Zacharek did praise the acting and the film's message. She added, \"In that respect, the way ''Duets'' treats its characters is refreshing. There are brief moments when it reminds us that plenty of people enjoy karaoke at the expense of their audience (during one scene an Asian businessman warbles tunelessly in the background), but ''Duets'' isn't out to make anyone look ridiculous.\"<ref>[http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2000/09/15/duets/index.html Zacharek, Stephanie].
