The screenplay by [[Howard A. Rodman]] is based on the magazine article ''Professor Sea Gull'' and the book ''[[Joe Gould's Secret]]'' by [[Joseph Mitchell (writer)|Joseph Mitchell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Manhattan]] in the early 1940s, the film focuses on the relationship between Joseph Mitchell, a writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and  [[Joe Gould (Bohemian)|Joe Gould]], an aging, bearded, disheveled [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[Harvard University]] graduate who wanders through the streets of [[Greenwich Village]] carrying a tattered portfolio and demanding donations to \"The Joe Gould Fund\". At times Gould is calmly sweet and perceptive, at others he's a pathological liar and an obnoxious drunk, and he frequently experiences sudden outbursts of rage. Earning occasional financial support from poet [[E. E. Cummings]], portrait painter [[Alice Neel]], [[Village Vanguard]] founder [[Max Gordon (Village Vanguard founder)|Max Gordon]], art gallery owner Vivian Marquie, and even the sculptor [[Gaston Lachaise]], Gould is able to secure a nightly room in [[flophouse]]s until an anonymous benefactor arranges accommodations in a residential hotel for him.\n\nGould allegedly is collecting the observations of average citizens to incorporate into his oral history of the world, fragments of which he has given to various people for safekeeping. Mitchell meets him in a coffee shop and initially is fascinated by the colorful character. However, with the passage of time, as Gould becomes irritatingly intrusive and demanding, disrupting the ordinary life Mitchell shares with his photographer wife and their two daughters, the journalist begins to question if the elderly man's 9 million-word opus actually exists or is merely a figment of his imagination.\n\nOne scene with Mitchell and Neel takes place at a gallery filled with the work of Lachaise, and was filmed at [[Salander-O'Reilly Galleries]] at 20 East 79th.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Ian Holm]] as Joe Gould\n*[[Stanley Tucci]] as Joe Mitchell\n*[[Hope Davis]] as Therese Mitchell\n*[[Hallee Hirsh]] as Nora Mitchell\n*[[Sarah Hyland]] as Elizabeth Mitchell\n*[[Celia Weston]] as Sarah\n*[[Susan Sarandon]] as Alice Neel\n*[[Patricia Clarkson]] as Vivian Marquie\n*[[Steve Martin]] as Charlie Duell\n*[[David Wohl (actor)|David Wohl]] as Max Gordon\n*[[Harry Bugin]] as Newsman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's [[soundtrack]] includes a number of period songs performed by [[Dinah Washington]], [[Count Basie]], [[Josephine Baker]], [[Woody Herman]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Perry Como]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], and [[Geoffrey Menin]] among others.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2002. It opened on five screens in New York City and Los Angeles on April 7 and grossed $38,760 on its opening weekend.

The movie does a lovely job of evoking a boozy 1940's Greenwich Village of poetry readings, cavernous bars and raucous parties ... Despite its rich period ambience and Sir Ian's fiery acting, the movie never brings Mitchell's relationship to Gould into clear enough focus ... Lacking dramatic tension, ''Joe Gould's Secret'' settles for being an atmospheric scenes-in-the-life biography of someone's most unforgettable character. It could have been so much more.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/040700secret-film-review.html ''New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed, \"Stanley Tucci is a director and actor with an openhearted generosity for his characters; he loves and forgives them ... Here he's made a chamber piece of quiet scenes, acutely heard dialogue and subterranean emotional shifts ... There is a dark, deep and sad undercurrent in the movie ... Some have said the film is too quiet and slow. There is anguish here that makes ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' pale by comparison.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000414/REVIEWS/4140304/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review]</ref>\n\nEdward Guthman of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' stated, \"[Ian Holm] nails one of the best roles of his career ...

Holm and Tucci are as brilliant in ''Secret'' as they were in ''[[Big Night]]'' ... The cast is outstanding ... but the movie belongs to Tucci and Gould with no room, really, for anyone else.\"<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/2000/04/14/WEEKEND12638.dtl ''San Francisco Examiner'' review]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0172632|title=Joe Gould's Secret}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|id=joe_goulds_secret|title=Joe Gould's Secret}}\n\n{{Stanley Tucci}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films based on non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1940s]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stanley Tucci]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
