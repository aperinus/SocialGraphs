The film argues that the word is an integral part of societal discussions about [[freedom of speech]] and [[censorship]]. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film ''[[Perversion for Profit]]''. Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Journalist [[Sam Donaldson]] talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian [[Billy Connolly]] states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician [[Alanis Morissette]] comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author [[Hunter S. Thompson]] before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist [[Reinhold Aman]], journalism analyst [[David Shaw (writer)|David Shaw]] and ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' editor [[Jesse Sheidlower]], explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.\n\nAnderson was exposed to public conceptions surrounding the word \"fuck\" by comedian [[George Carlin]]'s monologue \"[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]\". He named the film ''Fuck'' despite anticipating problems with marketing. Animator [[Bill Plympton]] provided sequences illustrating key concepts in the film. The documentary was first shown at the [[AFI Film Festival]] on November 7, 2005, at [[ArcLight Hollywood]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]].\n\n''Fuck''{{'}}s reviews were generally mixed. Film critic [[A. O. Scott]] called the documentary a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' criticized its length and other reviewers disliked its repetitiveness&nbsp;\u2013 the word \"fuck\" is used 857&nbsp;times in the film. In his 2009 book ''[[Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties]]'', law professor [[Christopher M. Fairman]] called the movie \"the most important film using 'fuck'\".\n\n==Content summary==\n[[File:Perversion-for-Profit-putnam.jpg|thumb|left|The documentary begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film ''Perversion for Profit''.<ref name=\"dvdverdict\" /><ref name=\"sampeczek\" />|alt=A still shot from the 1965 film ''Perversion for Profit'' showing a man in a suit holding a placard.
