The film was produced by Andrew A. Kosove, [[Broderick Johnson]], [[Lloyd Phillips]] and Edward L. McDonnell, based on a script written by David Schmidt, Steven P. Wegner, [[Kirk DeMicco]], and Du Chau. It was released theatrically on January 14, 2005, by Warner Bros.\n\nThe film tells the story of Stripes, a circus [[plains zebra]] who is accidentally abandoned in [[Kentucky]] and raised on a farm next to a racing track. Believing he is a racehorse, Stripes dreams of training for and competing in the races. The film stars [[Hayden Panettiere]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Wendie Malick]] and [[M. Emmet Walsh]], with the vocal and voice talents of [[Frankie Muniz]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Joshua Jackson]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Michael Rosenbaum]], [[Steve Harvey]], [[David Spade]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Fred Dalton Thompson]], [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]].\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and it earned $90 million. ''Racing Stripes'' was released on DVD and VHS on May 10, 2005, by [[Warner Home Video]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a thunderstorm, a [[traveling circus]], Circus Sarano, accidentally leaves behind a baby [[plains zebra]] ([[Jansen Panettiere]]) after replacing a flat tire. The foal is rescued by widower and former racehorse trainer Nolan Walsh ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), and is taken to his farm where his 13-year-old daughter, Channing ([[Hayden Panettiere]]) names him Stripes. He meets a [[Shetland pony]] named Tucker ([[Dustin Hoffman]]); a [[Saanen goat]] named Franny ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]); and a rooster named Reggie ([[Jeff Foxworthy]]). The next day, Stripes soon becomes convinced that he is destined for the nearby racetrack, [[Turfway Park]], not realizing that he is a zebra and is not qualified to race. Two foals named Trenton's Pride (Kyle Alcazar) and Ruffshodd (Frankie Ryan Manriquez) decide to race Stripes until they are stopped by Pride's father, three time Kentucky Open champion, Sir Trenton ([[Fred Dalton Thompson]]).\n\nThree years later, after racing the mailman again, an adult Stripes ([[Frankie Muniz]]) meets an [[Arabian horse|Arabian filly]] named Sandy ([[Mandy Moore]]) and develops a crush on her after losing to the mailman in their usual race. While talking to Sandy, he is approached by Pride ([[Joshua Jackson]]) and Ruffshodd ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), Stripes' tormentors since childhood while Channing's [[bloodhound]], Lightning ([[Snoop Dogg]]) is lazy and talks while he rests. Pride challenges Stripes to a racing match at a secret race track in the woods called the Blue Moon Races; he accepts, but loses the race.\n\nThe following day, Tucker, having secretly watched Stripes, approaches him and suggests that he gets proper training first. Stripes, in need of a rider, chooses 16-year-old Channing and convinces a new farm animal, a [[American white pelican|pelican]] named Goose ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), to sabotage Channing's motorcycle and ''Old Blue'', Nolan's old pickup truck, so that Channing can ride him to her workplace at Turfway Park. The plan works, and Channing, with Nolan's reluctant approval, rides Stripes to Turfway Park. There, Channing is antagonized by her boss, Clara Dalrymple ([[Wendie Malick]]), for bringing Stripes to the racetrack, while Stripes meets a pair of [[horse-fly]] brothers, Buzz and Scuzz ([[Steve Harvey]] and [[David Spade]]).\n\nAs night approaches, Channing, remembering her first ride on horseback with her mother, Carolyn, completes a lap around the track with Stripes. They are approached by Woodzie ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]), a racetrack gambler and old friend of the family, who encourages Channing to sign her and Stripes up for a tryout race tomorrow. She does, despite Nolan's disapproval stemming from his wife's death in a racing accident six years ago, which discouraged him to continue training horses ever since, but Stripes has a major meltdown after being easily scared by the horse-gate like all the other horses the next morning at the tryouts. Once he calms down, he begins running, but then gets hit in the face by flying dirt while racing, causing Channing to fall off. Though she is uninjured, Nolan chastises and blames her. However, when Dalrymple mocks her riding skills, Nolan defends his daughter. In response, Dalrymple sarcastically signs Stripes up to compete in the Kentucky Open competition.\n\nMeanwhile, Stripes realizes he is a zebra after being told off by Sir Trenton, which severely discourages him. Despite Channing's pleas and Woodzie's encouragement, Nolan refuses to let her race Stripes. Realizing this, the farm animals lure Nolan into the farm to show him a table holding his past accomplishments and he changes his mind. Meanwhile, due to Stripes' misbehavior during training, Franny reveals to Stripes that Tucker helped Nolan train the racehorse champions including Sir Trenton without getting any thanks, which encourages him to begin training.\n\nRefusing to allow Stripes to race, Sir Trenton and several thoroughbreds ambush Stripes and Sandy at a creek as they are talking and making up for their previous argument one night, kidnapping Sandy and threatening to hurt her if he races. The next day, after rescuing Stripes, Tucker, Franny, and Goose agree to rescue Sandy. With a little help from Buzz and Scuzz, the rescue is successful and they get back in time for Stripes to go to the race.\n\nAt the race, Nolan bets Dalrymple that if Stripes wins, then he gets Sandy, and if he loses then he will come back to work for her. During the race, Ruffshodd, and even his jockey, try to stop Stripes from winning until Scuzz gets them disqualified by biting Ruffshodd's rear-end. Later, Stripes begins to wear out until he finally remembers what Tucker taught him, \"Don't look back. Leave it all on the track,\" which boosts his confidence. Stripes wins the race and earns respect from the other racehorses, including Pride. In the end, they all pose together in a group photo, which is later shown with the other previous Walsh wins.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Humans===\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Channing \"Chan\" Walsh, who is Nolan's beautiful free-spirited 16-year-old daughter who is determined and willing to ride on horseback on Stripes, and despite her lack of opportunity, she has a natural talent for it exactly like her late mother, Carolyn, who died in a horse racing accident at Turfway Park when she was 10 six years ago.\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Nolan \"The Chief\" Walsh, who is Channing's widowed father, a veteran Kentucky corn farmer, and a retired racehorse trainer who has not been able to bear training horses, let alone Stripes the prized zebra, ever since his late wife, Carolyn, was killed when her racehorse stumbled six years ago when his daughter, Channing, was only 10 years old. Fearing that Channing will hurt herself if she ever rides Stripes, he refuses to let her anywhere near a saddle or the Turfway Park racetrack until at almost the end of the movie, where he finally wants to help Channing and Stripes for the big race, the Kentucky Open (an implied spoof of the [[Kentucky Derby]]), and finally encourages them to enter in it and win, which they do in the end.\n* [[M. Emmet Walsh]] as Sheriff Woodzie, who is an old, wide racetrack gambler and a good friend to the Walsh family. He sympathizes with Channing, especially since he sees the same gift in her that was present in her late mother, Carolyn.\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Clara Dalrymple, who is Nolan's former employer, Channing's boss, and, while beautiful, the film's main [[villain]]. She admires Trenton's Pride and Ruffshodd and only sees the Kentucky Open competition as a means of business and money and is not concerned for the well-being of her horses, especially not Stripes.\n* [[Gary Bullock]] as John Cooper, who is one of the racehorse trainers for the Kentucky Open thoroughbred sweepstakes. He doesn't share his boss, Dalrymple's views on pushing her horses past their limits, but continues to follow her instructions in order to get his paychecks, which are important for his work.\n* [[Caspar Poyck]] as The Mailman, who Stripes is beaten by every morning after they race around the block.\n\n===Voice actors===\n* [[Frankie Muniz]] as Stripes, a [[Foundling baby|foundling]] [[zebra]] who desires to compete in the Kentucky Open race, which leads to bullying from the local [[horses]] with the sole exception of Sandy, whom he has a crush on. His younger self was voiced by [[Jansen Panettiere]], Hayden Panettiere's brother.\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Tucker, a [[Shetland pony]] who used to help Nolan train [[racehorses]], including Sir Trenton. He presents himself with a grumpy demeanor after years of training ungrateful horses before retiring. But then helps Stripes by teaching him to race, Stripes was the only one who was really grateful to him for his help.\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Franny, an [[Old age|elderly]] [[Saanen goat]] who constantly encourages Stripes to pursue his dream and gives him many words of advice. She seems to be the only animal on the farm aware of how upset Tucker is about his retirement.\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Sandy, a professional jumper [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] [[filly]]. She is the only horse who supports Stripes' dream to become a racehorse. She and Stripes have romantic feelings for each other, which become mutual by the end of the film. After Stripes wins, she ends up living at the farm as part of Nolan and Dalrymple's bet.\n* [[Steve Harvey]] and [[David Spade]] as Buzz and Scuzz, a pair of [[horsefly]] brothers who serve as the film's comic relief and are good friends with Tucker. Buzz is larger and has blue eyes and combed hair, while Scuzz is scrawnier and has red eyes and messed-up hair. The brothers have a different taste in music: Scuzz is a rap fan while Buzz favors classical music.\n* [[Jeff Foxworthy]] as Reggie, the Walsh farm's [[rooster]], who means well, but is not very bright. He serves as the news announcer for the rest of the farm animals.\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Goose, a New York-accented [[American white pelican]] from the big city. He states that he moved to the farm in order to escape several other birds who have placed a hit on him, and that he was a \"hit bird\". It is presumably his experiences that render him afraid of loud noises.\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as Lightning, the family's lazy [[Bloodhound]] who talks while asleep.\n* [[Fred Thompson]] as Sir Trenton, an arrogant black [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse]] who sees his son, Trenton's Pride, as having no purpose other than to carry on the Trenton legacy. He also seems to view the Kentucky Open competition as his property, which leads to his antagonistic nature towards Stripes, whom he believes might ruin it. He is also one of Tucker's former racehorses-in-training before Nolan and Tucker retired from training.\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Trenton's Pride, Sir Trenton's son, who is a bully and picks on Stripes every chance he gets but still believes in winning a race the fair and honest way unlike his father and other horses. However, by the end of the film, he makes up and becomes friends with Stripes, having become impressed with his racing ability. His younger self was voiced by Kyle Alcazar.\n* [[Michael Rosenbaum]] as Ruffshodd, Pride's friend and lackey. At first, it seems that he bullies Stripes with Pride merely out of sycophancy for the latter and fear of Pride's father, but in reality, he is a worse bully by far, proving quite eager to help Sir Trenton in threatening Sandy in order to keep Stripes from racing in the Kentucky Open. This is further evidenced when he and his rider persistently try to sabotage Stripes during the Kentucky Open competition. His younger self was voiced by Frankie Ryan Manriquez.\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] as Clydesdale, a [[Clydesdale horse]] who oversees the Bluemoon races.\n\n===Additional voices===\n* [[Philip Proctor|Phil Proctor]] as Trenton's Henchhorse #1\n* [[Mona Marshall]] as Sheep\n* [[Chris Edgerly]] as Horses\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Animals\n* [[Jess Harnell]] as Horse 1 \n* [[Robert Clotworthy]] as Horse 2\n* [[Paul Pape]] as Angry Horses \n* [[Eddie Frierson]] as Various Horses\n* [[Jason Harris Katz|Jason Harris]] as Various Horses\n* Randall Montgomery as Horse\n* [[Anne Lockhart (actress)|Anne Lockhart]] as Horse\n* [[Bob Neill]] as Cheering Horse\n* [[Jason Harris (voice actor)|Jason Harris]] as Various Horses\n* [[Claudette Wells]] as Various Animals\n\n==Production==\n[[File: Kirk DeMicco, Golden Globes 2014 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kirk DeMicco]] is the film's writer.]]\nOn September 10, 2002, it was announced that [[Frederik Du Chau]] was hired and set to direct ''Racing Stripes''.

Sam was more well-behaved, and \"kind of wanted to be a horse,\" according to Tim Rivers, who trained him at the Animals in Motion farm near [[Citra, Florida]]. Sam had experience in ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]'', ''[[Second Noah]]'' and ''[[Sheena (TV series)|Sheena]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gainesville.com/article/LK/20050114/News/604151454/GS/|title=Local zebra stars in new film|last=Stinson|first=Lashonda|work=[[The Gainesville Sun]]|publisher=[[Ocala Star-Banner]]|date=January 14, 2005|access-date=May 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring production of the film, Hayden Panettiere was thrown off a zebra and ended up hospitalized with a [[concussion]] and a [[radiculopathy|pinched nerve]] in her neck.
