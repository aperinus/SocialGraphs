A [[remake]] of the 1941 film ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', it stars [[Benicio del Toro]] (who also produces), [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Hugo Weaving]]. In the film, after his brother is brutally murdered, an American actor named [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence Talbot]] (del Toro) returns to his ancestral homeland where he is bitten by a [[werewolf]] and cursed to become one.\n\n[[Mark Romanek]] was originally attached to direct the film but left weeks before filming due to creative differences and budgetary issues. Johnston was hired four weeks before principal photography, under the impression he could shoot the film in 80 days as Universal intended. However, re-shoots extended production, inflated the budget, and delayed the film's release several times. The film underwent numerous alternative versions during post-production. [[Danny Elfman]] was briefly replaced by [[Paul Haslinger]] as the film's composer, however, the studio reverted to Elfman's previously completed score a month before the film's release after finding Haslinger's electronic-based score unsuitable.\n\n''The Wolfman'' was theatrically released on February 12, 2010, by [[Universal Pictures]] to negative reviews. The film was also a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $142.6 million against a production budget of $150 million. Despite the film\u2019s failure, [[Rick Baker]] and make-up effects supervisor [[Dave Elsey]] won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]] for their work.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1891, Ben Talbot is attacked in the woods by a wolf-like [[Humanoid|humanoid]]. His brother, [[Shakespeare in performance|Shakespearean actor]] [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence Talbot]], returns home after receiving a letter from Ben's fianc\u00e9e Gwen Conliffe informing him of Ben's disappearance. Lawrence reunites with his estranged father Sir John, who informs him that Ben's body has already been found mutilated.\n\nAt a local pub, Lawrence overhears the locals believing it to be a wild animal. However, many blame [[Gypsy|gypsies]] who are camped outside the town. Another claims there was a similar murder 25 years earlier; a werewolf was the suspected killer. Lawrence has [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] as he tours his family's home where his mother Solana seemingly committed suicide when he was a boy. Lawrence saw his father standing over her dead body; he was sent to [[Lambeth Hospital]] in [[London]] for a year, having suffered from [[delusions]] connected to the event.\n\nLawrence visits the gypsies during a full moon. The local townspeople raid the camp to confiscate a [[dancing bear]] they believe is the killer. The werewolf then attacks the camp, killing several gypsies and townspeople before biting Lawrence and escaping. A gypsy woman named Maleva sutures Lawrence's shoulder wounds, but another gypsy insists the now-cursed Lawrence should be killed before he kills others. Maleva refuses, saying he is still a man and only a loved one can release him.\n\nAfter a night of fever dreams, Lawrence recovers with unnatural speed and develops heightened vitality and senses. Inspector Francis Aberline arrives to investigate, suspecting Lawrence is responsible based on his mental history. Terrified of possibly harming Gwen, Lawrence sends her to London. He follows Sir John to Solana's [[crypt]], where Sir John locks himself in a room and gives his son a cryptic warning. Lawrence undergoes a painful transformation into a werewolf before running off into the woods and killing a group of local hunters.\n\nThe next morning, Aberline and the police arrest Lawrence. Taken back to Lambeth, Lawrence is subjected to advanced treatments overseen by the sadistic Dr. Hoenneger. Sir John visits Lawrence; explaining 25 years ago during a hunting expedition in [[India]], he was bitten by a feral boy infected with [[lycanthropy]]. Sir John was the werewolf who bit Lawrence and is responsible for the recent murders, including Solana and Ben. He made Singh lock him up every full moon night and contemplated suicide for years. Driven insane by his condition, Sir John has come to embrace his curse and has decided to let himself loose during his transformations. He informs Lawrence the moon will be full and leaves a razor in case Lawrence contemplates suicide.\n\nBy nightfall, Dr. Hoenneger conducts an evening lecture with Lawrence as a case study. Lawrence attempts to warn the attendees of the impending danger, but they laugh it off and continue. Transforming once more, Lawrence kills Dr. Hoenegger and a few orderlies before he escapes and goes on a rampage. The next day, Lawrence visits Gwen's antique shop for help. They admit their love for each other and share a passionate kiss. Aberline waits outside Talbot Hall, arming himself and accompanying policemen with silver bullets. Gwen searches for Maleva hoping to cure Lawrence, but Maleva tells her there isn't any cure and Lawrence must die.\n\nLawrence arrives at Talbot Hall, where Sir John has killed Singh and one of Aberline's men. He loads a gun with Singh's silver bullets and attempts to shoot Sir John. Unfortunately, he realizes too late Sir John had removed the powder from the cartridges years ago. As the two struggle, with Sir John striking Lawrence with a silver cane, the full moon arises and the Talbots transform into werewolves. They set Talbot Hall on fire during their fight. Sir John initially gains the upper hand, wounding Lawrence. However, the latter manages to kick his deranged father into the fireplace and ultimately decapitates his father, avenging the deaths of his mother and brother.\n\nStill in his werewolf form, Lawrence pursues Gwen and corners her above a gorge. She pleads with Lawrence, and his consciousness recognizes her. The police and hunters approach, distracting Lawrence long enough for Gwen to fatally shoot him with Aberline's gun. Lawrence reverts to human form; thanking Gwen for setting him free and dies in her arms. As Talbot Hall burns, Aberline is horrified with the knowledge he was bitten by Lawrence as he watches the full moon come into view, foreshadowing his imminent fate in becoming the next werewolf.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Larry Talbot|Lawrence Talbot / The Wolfman]]\n** Mario Marin-Borquez as Young Lawrence Talbot\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Sir John Talbot / Wolfman\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Gwen Conliffe\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as Inspector Francis Aberline (loosely based on [[Frederick Abberline]])\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Maleva\n* [[Art Malik]] as Singh\n* [[Antony Sher]] as Dr. Hoenneger\n* [[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]] as Constable Nye\n* [[David Sterne]] as Kirk\n* [[Simon Merrells]] as Ben Talbot\n** [[Asa Butterfield]] as Young Ben Talbot\n* Cristina Contes as Solana Talbot\n* [[Michael Cronin (actor)|Michael Cronin]] as Dr. Lloyd\n* [[Nicholas Day (actor)|Nicholas Day]] as Colonel Montford\n* [[Clive Russell]] as MacQueen\n* Roger Frost as Reverend Fisk\n}}\n\n[[Max von Sydow]] appears as an elderly man who gives Lawrence the wolf-head cane;

That was really my main reason [for using CG]; it gave me so much more flexibility.\"<ref>[http://30ninjas.com/blog/exclusive-interview-ninjas-claw-at-the-truth-with-wolfman-and-captain-america-director-joe-johnston 30 Ninjas Interview Wolfman Director Joe Johnston on Make-up VS CGI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224024414/http://30ninjas.com/blog/exclusive-interview-ninjas-claw-at-the-truth-with-wolfman-and-captain-america-director-joe-johnston |date=February 24, 2010 }}</ref> In February 2009, [[ZBrush]] art of the transformation by Baker leaked online.<ref>{{cite news|title=Want to See Some Wolfman Concept Art?!|work=Shock Till You Drop|date=2009-02-26|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/712729-want-to-see-some-wolfman-concept-art|access-date=2009-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228052623/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=9704|archive-date=2009-02-28|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition to the film, at the 2009 ''[[Halloween Horror Nights (Orlando)#XIX: Ripped From The Silver Screen (2009)|Halloween Horror Nights]]'',  [[Universal Studios Florida]] added ''The Wolfman'' to the event.<ref>{{cite news|title='The Wolfman' Joins Uni's Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights|work=Bloody Disgusting|date=2009-07-06|url=https://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16664|access-date=2009-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709104337/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16664|archive-date=2009-07-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[Danny Elfman]] was reported to have written a dark, melodic, and moody score for ''The Wolfman'', which was rejected by the studio after the film was cut down half an hour in length and the music became too \"wall-to-wall\", creating what Johnston called too much repetition. Due to his not being able to come back and re-score (because he was contractually obligated to work on [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' feature film), the producers decided that, rather than expand on his ideas with a new composer \u2013 a path that they would eventually take \u2013, they would instead attempt a completely different approach with a different composer, which would include extensive re-shooting of scenes.\n\nThe idea was to quicken the pace and strike a similar tone to the successful ''Underworld'' film series, turning a slow-paced story into a much faster one. [[Paul Haslinger]] subsequently wrote an electronic contemporary incarnation of ''The Wolfman'' score, which the studio quickly realised was not appropriate for the late 19th-century Gothic setting. Elfman's previously recorded original score is, as a result, the one that is used in the final film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35451/danny-elfman-will-be-scoring-the-wolfman-afterall|title=Danny Elfman WILL Be Scoring The Wolfman After all|date=16 July 2012 |access-date=2020-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017062327/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35451/danny-elfman-will-be-scoring-the-wolfman-afterall|archive-date=2012-10-17|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Elfman's original recording was used in the final film, several additional composers ([[Conrad Pope]], [[Edward Shearmur]] and Thomas Lindgren) were brought in to shape Elfman's score to fit the final cut of the film, as well as compose new material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/danny-elfmans-score-is-back-in-the-wolfman/|title=Danny Elfman's Score is Back in The Wolfman|first=Russ|last=Fischer|work=Slash Film|date=January 20, 2010|access-date=February 10, 2019|archive-date=February 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211050018/https://www.slashfilm.com/danny-elfmans-score-is-back-in-the-wolfman/}}</ref>\n\nDanny Elfman's version of ''The Wolfman'' score was officially released on 23 February, 11 days after the film's release. This is actually the original score Elfman made for the earlier cut of ''The Wolfman'' before it was temporarily rejected.
