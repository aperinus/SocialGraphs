Later at an awards ceremony, the coach Duke Goulding presents the [[Most Valuable Player]] award to Odin for his efforts, an award he shares with his teammate Michael Cassio. In giving Odin the award, Duke passes over his son Hugo, Odin's teammate and friend. At a party celebrating the victory, Hugo plots with school outcast Roger Calhoun to go to the school's dean, Bob Brable, and tell him that Odin raped his daughter, Desi, whom Odin has been dating. Hugo promises Roger that Desi will be his after Odin is out of the way, but Roger is only a pawn in Hugo's ultimate plan to destroy Odin.\n\nLater, in another game, Odin's team wins once again. At the celebration party, Hugo engineers a fight between Roger and a very drunk Michael, who is temporarily suspended from the team. Hugo tells Michael to ingratiate himself with Desi so that she will talk to Odin on his behalf. Soon afterward, Hugo tells Odin that Michael and Desi have been spending a lot of time together, and that she may be cheating on him. Odin doesn't believe this at first, but gradually comes to suspect them. Odin questions Desi, but she calms him down and he believes her. Nevertheless, the stress of the situation drives Odin to begin using drugs.\n\nHugo manipulates his girlfriend Emily into stealing a scarf for him that Odin gave to Desi. Hugo, in turn, gives it to Michael in hopes that Odin will believe Desi gave Michael the scarf in an effort to prove Desi is cheating on Odin.\n\nMeanwhile, Odin and Desi are having sex at a motel, during which Odin sees an image of Michael on top of Desi in the mirror; angered, he becomes very rough with Desi, to the point that she cries out for him to stop, a plea he ignores as he continues to rape her. Afterward, they lie together staring in opposite directions.\n\nAfter Odin assaults another student during a game in a drug-fueled rage, Hugo tells him about the scarf, convincing him that Desi is cheating on him. Enraged, Odin vows to kill her; Hugo then promises to kill Michael. Hugo, with Odin and Roger, plans to kill Michael and Desi. Hugo and Roger attempt to kill Michael in a carjacking, but it does not go as planned: Roger and Michael struggle, Hugo hits Michael with a crowbar, knocking him unconscious. Roger shoots Michael in the leg, and then Hugo turns the gun on Roger and kills him after telling him that Desi is dead.\n\nOdin and Desi are in Desi's room talking and Odin is pretending to make up with her. They are making out on the bed when suddenly Odin attacks her; Desi fights back, but he finally strangles her to death. Emily rushes into the room and sees Desi's corpse; she soon finds out what Hugo has done. She begins telling Odin that Hugo told her to steal the scarf and exposes his plot, and Hugo fatally shoots her when she refuses to be quiet. Odin finally realizes that Hugo has been manipulating him the entire time, and demands to know why; Hugo refuses to answer. When the police arrive, Odin tells them what happened and shoots himself, dying by suicide. As Hugo is taken into police custody, he says in voice over that he will have his day in the spotlight.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mekhi Phifer]] as Odin James (based on [[Othello (character)|Othello]])\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as Hugo Goulding (based on [[Iago]])\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Desi Brable (based on [[Desdemona]])\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Roger Calhoun (based on [[Roderigo]])\n* [[Andrew Keegan]] as Michael Cassio (based on [[Michael Cassio]])\n* [[Rain Phoenix]] as Emily (based on [[Emilia (Othello)|Emilia]])\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Coach Duke Goulding (based on the Duke of Venice)\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Bob Brable (based on [[Brabantio]])\n* [[Anthony Johnson (actor)|Anthony Johnson]] as Dell\n* Rachel Shumate as Brandy (based on [[Bianca (Othello)|Bianca]])\n\n== Production ==\nScreenwriter Brad Kaaya's inspiration for the script came from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'', \"the spate of suburban school shootings that rocked the country in the 1980s\", and his own experiences as a Black teenager attending a largely white private school.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|date=August 31, 2001|title=Long wait is finally over for Tim Blake Nelson's 'O'|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|url=https://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/Long-wait-is-finally-over-for-Tim-Blake-Nelson-s-1064362.php|url-status=live|access-date=June 17, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220617225326/https://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/Long-wait-is-finally-over-for-Tim-Blake-Nelson-s-1064362.php|archive-date=June 17, 2022}}</ref> [[Tim Blake Nelson]] came across the script while filming [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'', and was offered the chance to direct based on his directorial debut ''[[Eye of God (film)|Eye of God]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFilming began in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], South Carolina in early 1999<ref name=\":1\" /> and wrapped that March.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news|last=Caro|first=Mark|date=August 26, 2001|title=Story of 'O' is a controversial tale|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-08-26-0108250282-story.html|url-status=dead|access-date=June 17, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220617234145/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-08-26-0108250282-story.html|archive-date=June 17, 2022}}</ref> [[Dimension Films]], a division of [[Miramax]], acquired the film two days into principal photography.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Tim Blake|author-link=Tim Blake Nelson|date=August 26, 2001|title=FILM;
