It is the fifth film in the [[Beach Party#Films in the series|Beach Party film series]]. The film stars [[Frankie Avalon]], [[Annette Funicello]], [[Linda Evans]], [[Deborah Walley]], [[Paul Lynde]], and [[Don Rickles]]. [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] and [[Buster Keaton]] appear.<ref name=\"gary\">Gary A. Smith, ''The American International Pictures Video Guide'', McFarland 2009, p. 20.</ref> Evans's singing voice was dubbed by [[Jackie Ward]].\n\n==Plot==\nA singer, Sugar Kane ([[Linda Evans]]), is unwittingly being used for publicity stunts for her latest album by her agent ([[Paul Lynde]]), for example, faking a [[parachuting|skydiving]] stunt, actually performed by Bonnie ([[Deborah Walley]]).\n\nMeanwhile, Frankie ([[Frankie Avalon]]), duped into thinking he rescued Sugar Kane, takes up skydiving at Bonnie's prompting; she secretly wants to make her boyfriend Steve ([[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]]) jealous. This prompts Dee Dee ([[Annette Funicello]]) to also try free-falling. Eric Von Zipper ([[Harvey Lembeck]]) and his Rat Pack bikers also show up, with Von Zipper falling madly in love with Sugar Kane. Meanwhile, Bonehead ([[Jody McCrea]]) falls in love with a mermaid named Lorelei ([[Marta Kristen]]).\n\nEventually, Von Zipper \"puts the snatch\" on Sugar Kane, and in a ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|Perils of Pauline]]''-like twist, the evil South Dakota Slim ([[Timothy Carey]]) kidnaps Sugar and ties her to a buzz-saw.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frankie Avalon]] as Frankie\n* [[Annette Funicello]] as Dee Dee\n* [[Harvey Lembeck]] as Eric Von Zipper \n* [[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]] as Steve\n* [[Deborah Walley]] as Bonnie\n* [[Jody McCrea]] as Bonehead\n* [[Marta Kristen]] as Lorelei\n* [[Linda Evans]] as Sugar Kane\n* [[Don Rickles]] as Big Drop\n* [[Paul Lynde]] as Bullets\n* [[Donna Loren]] as Donna\n* [[Timothy Carey]] as South Dakota Slim\n* [[Buster Keaton]] as Buster\n* [[Bobbi Shaw]] as Bobbi\n* [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] as himself\n* [[Michael Nader]] as Butch\n* [[Donna Michelle]] as Animal\n* Patti Chandler as Patti\n* [[Andy Romano]] as J.D.\n* [[Alberta Nelson]] as Puss\n* Myrna Ross as Boots\n* [[Chris Cranston]] as a Beach Girl\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n* ''Beach Blanket Bingo'' was [[Frankie Avalon]]'s last starring role in the [[beach party film]]s. He appears for only a few minutes in ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]'' and not at all in  ''[[The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini]]''.\n* [[Donna Michelle]], who portrays Animal, was ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Year]] for 1964.\n* [[Bobbi Shaw]] once again plays her \"ya, ya\" Swedish bombshell role.<ref>[http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/TheScore \"The Score of Beach Blanket Bingo\"]{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \n* Though this was Rickles' fourth film in the series, it's the only one in which he stepped out of his character in one scene and does a little of his night-club act, tossing some barbs at the characters, notably asking why Avalon and Funicello were in the picture, teasing \"You're 40 years old!\"\n\n==Production==\n;Cast and character changes\nThe part of Sugar Kane, played by [[Linda Evans]], was intended for [[Nancy Sinatra]]. This change was due in part to the fact that the plot involved a kidnapping, somewhat reminiscent of her brother [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]]'s kidnapping a few months before shooting began. That made her uncomfortable, causing her to drop out.<ref name=\"McParland\">McParland</ref>\n\n[[Elsa Lanchester]] was announced for a small role off the back of her performance in ''Pajama Party''<ref>George Succeeds Despite Miscasting\nDorothy Kilgallen:. The Washington Post and Times-Herald (1959-1973) [Washington, D.C] 07 Dec 1964: B11.</ref> but does not appear in the final film.\n\nThe character of Deadhead in ''Beach Party'', ''Muscle Beach Party'' and ''Bikini Beach'' is called Bonehead in this film because AIP had decided the term Deadhead was a so-called \"bankable noun\" and had decided to cast Avalon as the title character of its upcoming ''[[Sergeant Deadhead]]''.<ref name=\"McParland\">McParland</ref> The Rat Pack leader character Eric Von Zipper is given more screen time in this third film. He gets to sing his own song titled \"Follow Your Leader\" (which he reprises as \"I Am My Ideal\" for the follow-up ''How to Stuff a Wild Bikini'').\n\n[[John Ashley (actor)|John Ashley]], who played Ken in ''Beach Party'', and Johnny in both ''Muscle Beach Party'' and ''Bikini Beach'', returns in this movie as Steve, playing opposite his real-life wife [[Deborah Walley]]. According to ''Diabolique'' magazine, the Beach Party movies \"weren\u2019t all about songs, sex, and surfing; they were also about friendship, and you really notice the entries where the lead male isn\u2019t good friends with Ashley \u2013 in ''Beach Blanket Bingo'' it\u2019s downright stressful to see him and Avalon as strangers.\"<ref name=\"vagg\">{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/the-nine-lives-of-john-ashley/url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/the-nine-lives-of-john-ashley/|magazine=Diabolique Magazine|title=A Hell of a Life: The Nine Lives of John Ashley|date=December 2019}}{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n;Deleted sequences and songs\n* After the sequence wherein Frankie sings \u201cThese Are the Good Times\u201d:<ref name=\"McParland\">McParland</ref>\n:Dee Dee leaves the beach club and sings \u201cI\u2019ll Never Change Him\u201d by herself at the beach house.\n<small>(This sequence can still be seen in 16mm prints and television broadcasts of ''Beach Blanket Bingo,''<ref>{{YouTube|zAMDcIhOuAI|Annette Funicello sings ''I'll Never Change Him'' in ''Beach Blanket Bingo''}}</ref> but the Region 1 MGM DVD omits it.

''[[The New York Times]]''. 24.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"No one can blame Nicholson and Arkoff for continuing a pattern that has made them money, but this is ridiculous.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. April 7, 1965. 6.</ref> Margaret Harford of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that \"Some of it is pretty silly,\" but the movie \"is best when it is giving the kids a sly drubbing. Its teen-age inanities are not nearly so dull as its adult presumptuousness. For example: Columnist Earl Wilson hovering awkwardly around as a talent spotter. Earl looks as though he'd give a pearl or two just to be back in his less strenuous New York haunts.\"<ref>Harford, Margaret (April 9, 1965). \"'Blanket Bingo' Wins With Teens\".

Part V, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nFrankie Avalon later recalled \"'That's the picture of mine that I think people remember best, and it was just a lot of kids having a lot of fun \u2014 a picture about young romance and about the opposition of adults and old people. There's nothing that young people respond to more than when adults say `These kids are nuts,` and that's what this movie was about. It was also fun because we got to learn how to fake skydive out of an airplane.\"<ref>Talking Head: Frankie Avalon, Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y] 16 July 1999: W2.</ref>\n\n* The title of this movie inspired the title for [[Steve Silver]]'s 1974 play ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', which has become America's longest-running musical revue.\n* The March 5, 1978 episode of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' featured \"Beach Blanket Boo-Boo\", a parody of the film with Burnett as \"Nanette Vermacelli\" and [[Steve Martin]] as \"Frankie Travelon\".\n* In the 1983 film ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'', set in the mid-1960s, ''Beach Blanket Bingo'' is shown playing at a drive-in.\n* An excerpt from the title song and a partial scene from ''Beach Blanket Bingo'', dubbed into Vietnamese, is included in the 1987 film ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.\n* In the May 21, 1989 Season 3, Episode 21 (\"Life's a Beach\") of the American sitcom ''[[Married... with Children]],'' Marcy sees a bodybuilder walk by on the beach and remarks \"Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Beach blanket bingo over here, babycakes.\"\n* Beach Blanket Bingo is also the name of a band from the UK.\n* The combination of surfing and skydiving also appear in the 1991 film ''[[Point Break]]''. Both movies contain scenes of a football game on the beach, and feature scenes shot at Leo Carrillo State Beach in Malibu.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1965]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book\n  |last=McParland\n  |first=Stephen J.\n  |title= It's Party Time - A Musical Appreciation of the Beach Party Film Genre|location = Riverside, California, USA \n  |publisher=PTB Productions\n  |year=1994\n  |isbn=0-9601880-2-9}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n  | title = Beach Blanket Bingo\n  | journal = Dell Movie Classic\n  | publisher = Dell Publishing Inc.\n  | date = July\u2013September 1965}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AFI film|18528}}\n* {{IMDb title|0058953}}\n* {{Amg movie|4413}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=20605}}\n* [http://www.briansdriveintheater.com/bbb.html ''Beach Blanket Bingo''] at Brian's Drive-in Theatre\n* [http://impdb.org/index.php?title=Beach_Blanket_Bingo Entry at impdb.org]\n\n{{William Asher}}\n{{Beach Party series}}\n\n[[Category:1965 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:1965 films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American International Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Beach party films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by William Asher]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Les Baxter]]\n[[Category:Films about mermaids]]\n[[Category:Films about singers]]\n[[Category:Films set on beaches]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
