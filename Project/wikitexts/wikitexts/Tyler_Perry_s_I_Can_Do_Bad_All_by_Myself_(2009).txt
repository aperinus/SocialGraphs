Henson]], [[Adam Rodriguez]], [[Brian J. White|Brian White]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Gladys Knight]], and [[Marvin Winans|Marvin L. Winans]]. Although the film and play share the same title, the film is not an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of Perry's [[I Can Do Bad All By Myself (play)|play of the same name]]; the two works have different storylines as this film tells the story of an alcoholic lounge singer who is persuaded to take the custody of her niece and nephews by Madea after she catches them breaking into her house and their grandmother has gone missing. It is the fifth film in the [[Madea|''Madea'' cinematic universe]].\n\nDespite receiving generally mixed reviews from critics, ''I Can Do Bad All by Myself'' was a box office success, grossing $51.7 million worldwide against a $19 million budget.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2015}}\nThe film opens with April, a self-centered, [[alcoholic]] singer, performing at the nightclub Club Indigo where she works.\n\nOn the other side of town, [[Madea]] and Joe Simmons catch Jennifer, Manny, and Byron breaking into their house. After hearing the children\u2019s troubles, Madea welcomes and feeds them. Manny tells Madea that they're living with their grandmother Rose, whom they haven't seen in four days and their mother is deceased. They tell her that their only other relative is their Aunt April.\n\nApril shares her home with her shady abusive boyfriend Randy who's married with children. The next morning, Madea brings the kids to April's house, but April doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. Meanwhile, Pastor Brian sends a Colombian immigrant named Sandino to her house for work and a place to stay. April puts Sandino in her basement and wants to lock him down there because she doesn't know him that well. While working around the house, Sandino surprises April by cleaning himself up. When Randy arrives, he sees April with the kids and Sandino and heckles him while making not-so subtle [[Child molestation|advances]] at Jennifer.\n\nShortly afterward, Pastor Brian and Wilma, a church member, come to inform April that her mother Rose died from a fatal [[Cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] while riding on a city bus and was cremated. April is devastated by the news and seeks comfort from Randy. However, he is sleeping and shrugs her off. Later, Sandino comforts April as she tells him about her mother's death and the last time she spoke with her. Shortly afterwards Jennifer, Manny, and Byron return to April's after searching for their grandmother and April dejectedly tells them the news.\n\nDepressed, Jennifer goes to Madea wanting to know how to pray. Inexperienced with prayer, Madea attempts to instruct her in a scene that plays out comically.\n\nLater that night, Tanya, Club Indigo's bartender, sings \"''I Can Do Bad''\". Before singing the song, Tanya strongly confronts April about her attitude. She says that April must change her selfish ways and think about the safety of Byron, Manny and Jennifer. Tanya declares she loves April but says she can\u2019t help her unless she helps herself.\n\nOver time, Sandino and April become good friends. Sandino fixes a ruined bedroom in her house. This makes Manny and Byron happy, but upsets Jennifer, who feels April does not want them there. While on a date, Sandino tells April he doesn't understand why she is with Randy and asks if she loves Randy. He tells her what true love is to him. One Sunday morning, Sandino eagerly knocks on April's bedroom door to get April ready for church, but Randy threatens to kill Sandino if he continues to spend time with April.\n\nLate the next night, Manny needs his insulin shot and Jennifer goes to the kitchen to get it. As she prepares the shot, Randy approaches and attempts to [[rape]] her, but Sandino fights him off. April walks in on the fight and Randy claims Jennifer offered him sex for money. April pretends to believe him and sends Randy to take a bath. When he is in the tub, April threatens to [[electrocute]] him with a plugged-in radio. Sandino arrives and tries to stop her, but April is enraged, as she explains that she was [[sexually abused]] by her step-father Lee, who then lied about it to her mother, thus causing April to lose her faith in the people that cared about her. Once this is revealed, it is then known why April became an alcoholic due to her step-father lying to her mother for years over the sexual abuse and why April chose to live a life without bearing children and resenting her step-father for what he did to her. After twice asking \"Do you want me to put it down?!\", she drops the plugged-in radio into the water, giving Randy a severe [[electric shock]]. Randy barely jumps out just in time and Sandino orders him to leave in three minutes.\n\nApril goes to Club Indigo for a drink and blames herself for not seeing the signs, just like her mother didn't see the signs with her. Sandino tries to stop her from drinking while mentioning that Randy has moved out, but she pushes him away. She then asks Sandino if he is a child molester because of all the attention he gives the children. Sandino tells April of his childhood as a child laborer and explains that he loves the children so much because he sees himself in them. Feeling hurt at her unfair accusations, Sandino says farewell to the children and leaves.\n\nJennifer and April begin to get along and connect after April tells Jennifer about her bad experience as a child. Jennifer tells her that she should recognize Sandino as a good man. Eventually, Sandino returns and April apologizes to him and admits that she loves him like a friend. Sandino tells her that she can't love anyone until she learns to love herself. He tells April that he is in love with her but he wants April to love him back the same way he loves her. He shows her by kissing her.\n\nEventually, April and Sandino get married. April and Sandino then hold a block party for their reception with Tanya singing \"Good Woman Down\", dedicated to April, then the new couple is shown embracing and sharing a passionate kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Taraji P.
