The case remains one of the United States' most infamous unsolved crimes. Fincher, Vanderbilt, and producer [[Bradley J. Fischer]] spent 18 months conducting their own investigation and research into the Zodiac murders. Fincher employed the digital [[Thomson Viper FilmStream Camera]] to photograph most of the film, with traditional high-speed film cameras used for slow-motion murder sequences.\n\n''Zodiac'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in North America and [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in international markets on March 2, 2007, and received mostly positive reviews, with praise for its writing, directing, acting, and historical accuracy. The film was nominated for several awards, including the [[Saturn Award for Best Action, Adventure or Thriller Film]]. It grossed over $84.7 million worldwide on a production budget of $65 million. In a 2016 critics' poll conducted by the [[BBC]], ''Zodiac'' was voted the 12th greatest film of the 21st century.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nOn July 4, 1969, an unknown man attacks Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau with a handgun at a [[lovers' lane]] in [[Vallejo, California]]. Only Mike survives.\n\nOne month later, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' receives [[encrypted]] letters written by the killer calling himself \"[[Zodiac Killer|Zodiac]],\" who threatens to kill a dozen people unless his coded message containing his identity is published. Political [[cartoonist]] [[Robert Graysmith]], who correctly guesses that his identity is not in the message, is not taken seriously by crime reporter [[Paul Avery]] or the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings. When the newspaper publishes the letters, a married couple deciphers one. In September, the killer stabs law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard at [[Lake Berryessa]] in [[Napa County]]; Cecelia dies two days later.\n\nAt the office, Avery makes fun of Graysmith before they discuss the coded letters. Graysmith interprets the letter, which Avery finds helpful, and he begins sharing information. One of Graysmith's insights about the letters is that Zodiac's reference to man as \"the most dangerous animal of them all\" is a reference to the film ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', which features the villainous Count Zaroff, a man who hunts live human prey.\n\nTwo weeks later, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city's [[Presidio Heights]] district. The Zodiac killer mails pieces of Stine's bloodstained shirt to the ''Chronicle'' along with a taunting letter. San Francisco police inspectors [[Dave Toschi]] and his partner Bill Armstrong are assigned to the case by Captain Marty Lee and work closely with Vallejo's Jack Mulanax and Captain Ken Narlow in Napa. Someone claiming to be Zodiac continues to send taunting letters and speaks on the phone with lawyer [[Melvin Belli]] on a television talk show hosted by [[Jim Dunbar]].\n\nIn 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax question Arthur Leigh Allen, a suspect in the Vallejo case. They notice that he wears a [[Zodiac Watches|Zodiac wristwatch]], with the same logo used by the killer, and Toschi heavily suspects him. However, a [[Questioned document examination|handwriting expert]] insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be [[ambidextrous]]. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. He shares information with the [[Riverside Police Department]] that the killer might have been active before the initial killings, angering Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who cannot sit through a Hollywood film, ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', loosely based on the Zodiac case.\n\nBy 1978, Avery has moved to the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]''. Graysmith persistently contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders and eventually impresses him with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides names in other police departments where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the [[San Francisco Police]] homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter.\n\nGraysmith continues his own investigation, profiled in the ''Chronicle'', and gives a television interview about the book he is writing about the case. He begins receiving phone calls with heavy breathing. As his obsession deepens, Graysmith loses his job, and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children. Graysmith learns that Allen lived close to Ferrin and probably knew her and that his birthday matches the one Zodiac gave when he spoke to one of Melvin Belli's maids. While [[circumstantial evidence]] seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as [[fingerprint]]s and handwriting samples, do not implicate him. In 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen to a Vallejo [[Ace Hardware]] store, where he is employed as a sales clerk; they stare at each other before Graysmith leaves. Eight years later, after Graysmith's book, [[Zodiac (true crime book)|''Zodiac'']], has become a bestseller, Mike Mageau identifies Allen from a [[police mugshot]].\n\nA textual epilogue indicates that Allen died before police could question him and that the case remains open.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as [[Robert Graysmith]]\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Inspector [[Dave Toschi]]\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Paul Avery]]\n* [[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as Inspector Bill Armstrong\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Melvin Belli]]\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Sergeant Jack Mulanax\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Captain Ken Narlow\n* [[John Carroll Lynch]] as [[Arthur Leigh Allen]]\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Captain Marty Lee\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Melanie Graysmith\n* [[John Terry (actor)|John Terry]] as Charles Thieriot\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Sherwood Morrill\n* [[June Diane Raphael]] as Carol Toschi\n* Ciara Moriarty as Darlene Ferrin\n* [[Adam Goldberg]] as Duffy Jennings\n* [[Tom Verica]] as [[Jim Dunbar]]\n* [[Lee Norris]] as Mike Mageau\n**[[Jimmi Simpson]] as Older Mike Mageau\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Mel Nicolai\n* [[Joel Bissonnette]] as Inspector Kracke\n* [[James LeGros]] as Detective George Bawart\n* [[John Getz]] as Templeton Peck\n* [[John Mahon (actor)|John Mahon]] as Captain Gillette\n* [[Matt Winston]] as John Allen\n* [[Jules Bruff]] as Catherine Allen\n* [[John Ennis (actor)|John Ennis]] as Terry Pascoe\n* Patrick Scott Lewis as Bryan Hartnell\n* [[Pell James]] as Cecilia Shepard\n* [[Charles Fleischer]] as Bob Vaughn\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Linda del Buono\n* Zachary Sauers as Aaron Graysmith\n* Micah Sauers as David Graysmith \n* [[Paul Schulze]] as Sandy Panzarella\n* [[John Hemphill (actor)|John Hemphill]] as Donald Cheney\n* [[Ed Setrakian]] as Al Hyman\n* Richmond Arquette as Zodiac 1 / Zodiac 2\n* [[Bob Stephenson (actor)|Bob Stephenson]] as Zodiac 3\n* John Lacy\tas Zodiac 4\n* [[Ione Skye]] as Kathleen Johns (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Robert Graysmith]] first sold the film rights to his true crime book ''[[Zodiac (true crime book)|Zodiac]]'' to [[Shane Salerno]], who he had built up a close relationship with.

Fincher found that there was much speculation and [[hearsay in United States law|hearsay]] and, therefore, wanted to interview people who were directly involved in the case in-person to see if their stories were believable. He did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.<ref name=\"production notes\" />\n\nFincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt spent months interviewing witnesses, family members of suspects, retired and current investigators, the two surviving victims, and the mayors of San Francisco and Vallejo. Fincher said, \"Even when we did our own interviews, we would talk to two people. One would confirm some aspects of it and another would deny it. Plus, so much time had passed, memories are affected and the different telling of the stories would change perception. So when there was any doubt we always went with the police reports.\"<ref name=\"production notes\" /> During the course of their research, Fincher and Fischer hired Gerald McMenamin, a [[forensic linguistics]] expert and professor of linguistics at [[California State University Fresno]], to analyze the Zodiac's letters.

He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like [[Final Cut Pro]] to edit ''Zodiac''. Fincher remarked in an interview, \"[[Dailies]] almost always end up being disappointing, like the veil is pierced and you look at it for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what I really have to work with.'

The director's approach to ''Zodiac'' was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching was the truth. The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer or tell the story through his eyes. \"That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own,\" Fincher said.<ref name=\"Williams, David\" />\n\nSavides' first experience with the Viper Filmstream camera was shooting a [[Motorola]] commercial with Fincher. From there, he used it on ''Zodiac''. Fincher wanted to make sure that the camera was more inclined towards film production so that the studio would be more comfortable about using it on a project with a large budget. To familiarize himself with the camera, he \"did as many things 'wrong' as I possibly could. I went against everything I was supposed to do with the camera.\"<ref name=\"Williams, David\" /> Savides felt comfortable with the camera despite its certain limitations.<ref name=\"Williams, David\" />\n\nFincher and Savides used the photographs of [[William Eggleston]], [[Stephen Shore]]'s work from the early Seventies, and actual photos from the Zodiac police files.<ref name=\"Williams, David\" /> The two men worked hard to capture the look and feel of the period as Fincher admitted, \"I suppose there could have been more [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW bugs]] but I think what we show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended.\"<ref name=\"production notes\" /> The ''San Francisco Chronicle'' was built in the old post office in the [[U.S. Post Office&nbsp;\u2013 Los Angeles Terminal Annex|Terminal Annex Building]] in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. [[Principal photography]] began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.<ref name=\"production notes\" />\n\nSome of the cast was not happy with Fincher's exacting ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upward of 70 takes. Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, \"You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's a point at which you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?\"<ref name=\"halbfinger\" /> Downey said, \"I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to [[garrote]] him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand [[gulag]]s\".<ref name=\"halbfinger\" /> Fincher responded, \"If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake&nbsp;\u2013 and it's the 56th take that's in the movie\".<ref name=\"Svetkey, Benjamin\" /> Ruffalo also defended his director's methods when he said, \"The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger.\"<ref name=\"halbfinger\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\n[[File:Zodiacfx.jpg|thumb|alt=Man is standing on a street in front of a car and a bluescreen and then the same image is repeated but with the background of the city instead of the bluescreen|Side-by-side comparison of soundstage blue screen work (left) with finished [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-enhanced scene]]\n[[Digital Domain]] handled most of the film's 200+ effects shots, including pools of blood and bloody fingerprints found at crime scenes. For the murder of Cecelia Shepard at Lake Berryessa, blood seepage and clothing stains were added in post-production. Fincher did not want to shoot the blood with practical effects because cleaning the costumes after every take would take too long, so the murder sequences were done with [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] (CG) blood.<ref name=\"crabtree\">{{cite news\n | last = Crabtree\n | first = Sheigh\n | title = Re-creating 1969 \"Zodiac\" Murders\n | newspaper = Los Angeles Times\n | date = March 11, 2007\n | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/11/entertainment/ca-zodiac11\n | access-date = April 20, 2020\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170329003218/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/11/entertainment/ca-zodiac11\n | archive-date = March 29, 2017\n | url-status = live\n }}</ref>\n\nCG was also used to recreate the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly over the years and residents did not want the murder to be recreated in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the sequence on a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] stage. [[Production designer]] Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based [[Geometric modeling|geometric models]] of homes that were then textured with period facades. [[3D scanning|3D]] vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.<ref name=\"crabtree\" />\n\nSeveral of the film's establishing shots of the 1970s-era Bay Area were created by the Marin County effects house [[Matte World Digital]] (MWD). The \"helicopter shots\" of the fireworks-laden sky over Vallejo, the San Francisco waterfront, and the overhead shot of the cab driving through San Francisco were CG, as was the shot looking down at traffic from the tower of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. A [[Time-lapse photography|time-lapse]] sequence of the construction of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] was a hybrid of 2D and 3D [[matte painting]], created using reference photos of the Pyramid taken from the rooftop of [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s [[Columbus Tower (San Francisco)|Sentinel Building]].

Klyce inserted music from one of his favorite soundtracks, [[David Shire]]'s score for ''[[The Conversation]].''<ref name=\"Jackson, Blair\" />\n\nKlyce contacted film and sound editor [[Walter Murch]] who worked on ''The Conversation,'' and he connected Klyce with Shire. Fincher sent Shire a copy of the script and flew him in to Los Angeles for a meeting. Fincher only wanted 15\u201320 minutes of score and based solely on piano. Shire worked on it and incorporated textures of a [[Charles Ives]] piece called \"[[The Unanswered Question]]\" and ''Conversation''-based cues, he found that he had 37 minutes of original music. The orchestra Shire assembled consisted of musicians from the [[San Francisco Opera]] and [[San Francisco Ballet]]. Shire said, \"There are 12 signs of the Zodiac and there is a way of using atonal and tonal music. So we used 12 tones, never repeating any of them but manipulating them\".<ref name=\"production notes\" /> He used specific instruments to represent the characters: the trumpet for Toschi, the solo piano for Graysmith and the dissonant strings for the Zodiac killer.<ref name=\"production notes\" />\n{{Track listing\n| headline  = Soundtrack CD\n| extra_column = Performing artist\n| title1    = [[Easy to Be Hard]]\n| length1   = 3:10\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Galt MacDermot]]|[[James Rado]]|[[Gerome Ragni]]}}\n| extra1 = [[Three Dog Night]]\n| title2    = [[Sky Pilot (song)|Sky Pilot]]\n| writer2     = {{hlist|[[Eric Burdon]]|[[Vic Briggs]]|[[John Weider]]|[[Barry Jenkins (musician)|Barry Jenkins]]|[[Danny McCulloch]]}}\n| extra2 = [[Eric Burdon and The Animals]]\n| length2   = 7:27\n| title3    = [[Soul Sacrifice (song)|Soul Sacrifice]]\n| writer3     = {{hlist|[[David Brown (American musician)|David Brown]]|[[Marcus Malone]]|[[Gregg Rolie]]|[[Carlos Santana]]}}\n| extra3 = [[Santana (band)|Santana]]\n| length3   = 6:37\n| title4    = [[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]\n| writer4     = [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]]\n| length4   = 3:00\n| extra4 = [[Four Tops]]\n| title5    = [[(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden]]\n| writer5     = [[Joe South]]\n| length5   = 2:55\n| extra5 = [[Lynn Anderson]]\n| title6    = [[I Want to Take You Higher]]\n| writer6     = [[Sly Stone]]\n| length6   = 5:23\n| extra6 = [[Sly and the Family Stone]]\n| title7   = [[Hot Buttered Soul|Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic]]\n| writer7     = {{hlist|[[Isaac Hayes]]|[[Alvertis Isbell]]}}\n| length7   = 9:38\n| extra7 = [[Isaac Hayes]]\n| title8   = [[Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)]]\n| writer8     = {{hlist|[[Marvin Gaye]]|[[James Nyx Jr.]]}}\n| length8   = 5:28\n| extra8 = [[Marvin Gaye]]\n| title9   = [[Brother Louie (Hot Chocolate song)|Brother Louie]]\n| writer9     = {{hlist|[[Errol Brown]]|[[Tony Wilson (musician)|Tony Wilson]]}}\n| length9   = 3:55\n| extra9 = [[Stories (band)|Stories]]\n| title10   = [[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]\n| writer10     = [[Donovan]]\n| length10   = 3:15\n| extra10 = [[Donovan]]\n| title11   = [[It's Not for Me to Say]]\n| writer11     = {{hlist|[[Robert Allen (song composer)|Robert Allen]]|[[Al Stillman]]}}\n| length11   = 3:06\n| extra11 = [[Johnny Mathis]]\n| title12   = [[Dakar (album)|Mary's Blues]]\n| writer12     = [[Pepper Adams]]\n| length12   = 6:47\n| extra12 = [[John Coltrane]]\n| title13   = [[Solar (composition)|Solar]]\n| writer13     = [[Miles Davis]]\n| length13   = 4:44\n| extra13 = [[Miles Davis]]\n| title14   = Sound of the City\n| writer14     = [[Johnny Mann]]\n| length14   = 1:14\n| extra14 = [[The Johnny Mann Singers]]\n| total_length = 1:06:39\n}}\n\n==Release==\nAn early version of ''Zodiac'' ran three hours and eight minutes.
