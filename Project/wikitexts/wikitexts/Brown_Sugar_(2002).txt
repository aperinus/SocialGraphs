The film is a story of a lifelong friends, A&R Andre and Editor-in-Chief Sidney. The two can attribute their friendship and the launch of their careers to a single, seminal childhood moment \u2013 the day they discovered hip-hop on a New York street corner. Now some 15 years later, as they lay down the tracks toward their futures, hip-hop isn't the only thing that keeps them coming back to that moment on the corner.\n\nThe movie was released in the US on October 11, 2002 and ran for 16 weeks, grossing $27,363,891 domestically and $952,560 in the foreign sector for a worldwide total of $28,316,451.\n\n==Plot==\nChildhood friends Sidney ([[Sanaa Lathan]]) and Dre ([[Taye Diggs]]), who originally bonded over their love of [[Hip hop culture|hip-hop]], face an evolving relationship as adults. Sidney has just been appointed the [[editing|editor-in-chief]] of the hip hop magazine ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', and Dre is an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] for Millennium Records. While Sidney's career is flourishing, Dre is increasingly frustrated with his label's preference for marketable artists over true talent.\n\nDre meets and falls in love with Reese ([[Nicole Ari Parker]]), a successful entertainment attorney, and soon becomes engaged to her.  The night before Dre's wedding, he and Sidney kiss and almost have sex, but they stop themselves. At the wedding, Sidney's cousin Francine ([[Queen Latifah]]) deduces the romantic tension between Sidney and Dre and encourages her to object during the ceremony. She does not and Dre settles into married life with Reese. Sidney, meanwhile, begins dating professional athlete Kelby Dawson ([[Boris Kodjoe]]).\n\nDre sees Cavi ([[Mos Def]]), a rapper who works as a taxi driver during the day, perform and is impressed with his talent, but Cavi isn't interested in signing with Dre's label because he doesn't like the music they produce. Dre's boss meanwhile pushes him to manage an untalented but commercially viable rap group, forcing him to choose between his income and his love of hip hop. He decides to quit and form his own label, focusing on bringing back the real hip hop that his generation fell in love with, and manages to sign Cavi.\n\nReese is unsupportive of Dre's new business venture, concerned it will fail and they will be forced to live in reduced circumstances. Meanwhile, Sidney draws closer to Dre due to their partnership in the label, and Reese develops jealousy over Dre and Sidney's friendship, while Cavi falls for Francine but struggles to muster the courage to ask her out.\n\nSidney also grows closer to Kelby, who proposes to her. Dre tells her he's against her marrying Kelby because he thinks he's inauthentic. Sidney doesn't agree, but begins to have doubts when she discovers that Kelby doesn't read her articles.\n\nWhen Dre discovers Reese has been cheating with a man from the gym, he brings Sid to catch her in the act. This leads to a night of shared passion between Dre and Sid and opens Sid's eyes to the fact she is not prepared to marry Kelby. She calls off the engagement and while searching for Dre sees Reese and Dre in a parting embrace that she misconstrues as more.\n\nWhile at [[WQHT|Hot 97]] waiting for Cavi's first single to play on the Angie Martinez show, Dre hears Sid talking about her new book ''I Used to Love H.I.M.'' Though based on her love affair with hip-hop, it really is a chronicled timeline of her love affair with Dre. He recognizes this and rushes over to the station to confront his feelings, as well. Meanwhile, in the production booth, Cavi stumbles in trying to ask Francine out again. She recognizes their attraction and asks him out on a date.\n\nThe film ends with Cavi's song playing in the same park where their love of hip-hop began.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Taye Diggs]] \u2014 Andre Romulus 'Dre' Ellis\n**[[Marc John Jefferies]] - Young Dre Ellis\n*[[Sanaa Lathan]] \u2014 Sidney 'Sid' Shaw, Dre's best friend\n** Aaliyyah Hill - Young Sidney\n*[[Mos Def]] \u2014 Christopher Anton 'Cavi' Vichon, a cabby (and secret rapper) who later befriends Dre \n*[[Nicole Ari Parker]] \u2014 Reese Marie Wiggam Ellis, an attorney who later marries Dre\n*[[Boris Kodjoe]] \u2014 Kelby Dawson, an NBA star who Sid meets and starts dating\n*[[Queen Latifah]] \u2014 Francine, Sid's cousin\n*[[Wendell Pierce]] - Simon, Dre's boss at Millennium Records\n*[[Erik Weiner]] \u2014 Ren, half of The Hip Hop Dalmatians\n* Reggi Wyns - Ten, half of The Hip Hop Dalmatians\n* [[Venida Evans]] - Aunt Betty\n* [[Liza Lapira]] - Hot 97 Receptionist\n* [[Wyking Jones]] - Bartender\n\n'''cameo appearances'''\n*[[Big Daddy Kane]] - Himself\n*[[Kool G Rap]] \u2014 Himself\n*[[Pete Rock]] \u2014 Himself\n*[[De La Soul]] \u2014 Themselves\n*[[Tariq Trotter]] aka Black Thought \u2014 Himself\n*[[Jermaine Dupri]] \u2014 Himself\n*[[Talib Kweli]] \u2014 Himself\n*[[Common (entertainer)|Common]] - Himself\n*[[Method Man]] - Himself\n*[[Slick Rick]] - Freestyler\n*[[Dana Dane]] - Freestyler\n*[[Jen Taylor]] - Boathouse Attendant \n*[[Doug E.
