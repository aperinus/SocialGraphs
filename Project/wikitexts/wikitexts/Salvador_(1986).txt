It stars [[James Woods]] as [[Richard Boyle (journalist)|Richard Boyle]], alongside [[Jim Belushi]], [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] and [[Elpidia Carrillo]], with [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] and [[Cynthia Gibb]] in supporting roles. Stone co-wrote the screenplay with Boyle.\n\nThe film tells the story of an American journalist covering the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] who becomes entangled with both the [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|FMLN]] and the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador|military dictatorship]] while trying to rescue his girlfriend and her children. The film is highly sympathetic toward the left-wing revolutionaries and strongly critical of the US-supported military dictatorship, focusing on [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|the murder of four American Catholic nuns]], including [[Jean Donovan]], and the assassination of Archbishop [[\u00d3scar Romero]] by death squads. The film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (Woods) and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] (Stone and Boyle).<ref>{{cite web|title=The 59th Academy Awards 1987|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1987|access-date=3 February 2016|website=Oscars.org}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nVeteran [[photojournalist]] [[Richard Boyle (journalist)|Richard Boyle]] ([[James Woods]]) has over 20 years of experience, and while he has good output, Boyle's substance abuse problems and his arrogance have marred his reputation and left him practically unemployable. One morning, he finds that his wife has abandoned him, and took their child with her. Broke and with no immediate prospects, Boyle and his close friend, Doctor Rock ([[Jim Belushi]]), an out-of-work disc jockey, head to [[El Salvador]], where Boyle is convinced that he can do freelance work amidst the nation's political turmoil.  After arriving, Boyle asks to meet a general he met during the [[Football War]], and he and Rock are taken to him in a school-turned-barracks where both discuss the situation and he learns that the [[Salvadoran Army]] is being supplied by the United States. Sensing that disaster is imminent in El Salvador, Boyle eventually decides to leave, but he is reunited with an old flame named Mar\u00eda ([[Elpidia Carrillo]]) and her two children, and is motivated to help them escape the country.\n\nIn the meantime, Boyle and Mar\u00eda go to a mass led by [[Archbishop Oscar Romero]]. During the mass, the Archbishop is assassinated by the far-right [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARANA party]] while the army outside opens fire on the fleeing crowd with Boyle and Maria barely escaping. Afterwards, Boyle goes to the United States Embassy to convince the ambassador to cut aid for the Salvadoran government, but his suggestions are denied and he is told to leave the country for his own safety.\n\nWhile attempting to get Mar\u00eda out of the country, Boyle is harassed by military authorities, which eventually leads to the deaths of people either close to him or Mar\u00eda. As [[Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front|rebels]] overrun the government forces in [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]], Boyle witnesses them execute captured soldiers with the same cruelty the military had previously shown them, which greatly disgusts him. When the Salvadoran Army starts using American supplies to combat the rebels, Boyle's friend and fellow photojournalist, [[John Hoagland|John Cassady]] ([[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]]), is killed during the battle.\n\nBoyle and Mar\u00eda eventually leave the country for the United States. However, upon entering California, their bus is stopped by immigration officers and Mar\u00eda allows herself to be deported alongside her children due to the guilt of leaving her home country behind while Boyle is arrested after desperately arguing with the officers.\nAn epilogue reveals that Mar\u00eda and her children survived and were last rumored to be in a refugee camp in Guatemala; Doctor Rock eventually returned to San Francisco; Cassady's photos were published; Boyle is still looking for Mar\u00eda and her children; and that El Salvador continues to receive [[United States military aid|American military aid]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[James Woods]] as [[Richard Boyle (journalist)|Richard Boyle]]\n*[[Jim Belushi]] as Doctor Rock\n*[[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Ambassador Thomas Kelly\n*[[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as John Cassady\n*[[Elpidia Carrillo]] as Mar\u00eda\n*[[Cynthia Gibb|Cindy Gibb]] as Cathy Moore (based on [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|Jean Donovan]])\n*[[Tony Plana]] as Major Maximiliano Casanova (based on [[Roberto D'Aubuisson]])\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Ruiz]] as Archbishop [[Oscar Romero]]\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in the United States on March 5, 1986.

[[Roger Ebert]], a film critic for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', gave the movie three stars out of four and wrote, \"The movie has an undercurrent of seriousness, and it is not happy about the chaos that we are helping to subsidize.
