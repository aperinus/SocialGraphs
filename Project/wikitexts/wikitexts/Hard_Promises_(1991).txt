For ''Hard Promises'' to be half as much fun as it intends to be, Joey should be a thoroughly likable scamp. For reasons that may be due to Jule Selbo's screenplay, [[Martin Davidson]]'s direction or something in [[William Petersen|Mr. Petersen]]'s screen personality, Joey is not the dreamboat the movie requires. He's a bore... The movie offers a lot of running gags that walk very slowly, and small roles to a number of very good actors, including [[Mare Winningham]], [[Peter MacNicol]], [[Lois Smith]], [[Ann Wedgeworth]] and [[Amy Wright]].<ref name=NYT/>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0102002|Hard Promises}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|hard_promises}}\n*{{amg movie|21534|Hard Promises}}\n\n{{Martin Davidson}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hard Promises}}\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1991 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Martin Davidson]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George S.
