The film also stars [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]], [[Jonathan Pryce]], and [[John Krasinski]] and focuses on the early years of professional [[American football]]. The film was released on April 4, 2008. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed just $41 million against its $58 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1925, Jimmy \"Dodge\" Connelly ([[George Clooney]]) is captain of the [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] Bulldogs, a struggling professional American football team.  Dodge is determined to save both his team and pro football in general when the players lose their sponsor and the league is on the brink of collapse. He convinces [[Princeton University]]'s college football star, Carter \"the Bullet\" Rutherford, to join the Bulldogs, hoping to capitalize on Carter's fame as a decorated hero of the [[World War I|First World War]] (like [[Alvin York]], he single-handedly captured a large group of [[Imperial German Army|German soldiers]]).  In addition to his legendary tales of combat heroism, Carter has dashing good looks and unparalleled speed and skill on the field.  As a result of his presence, both the Bulldogs and pro football in general begin to prosper.\n\n''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' newspaper reporter Lexie Littleton becomes the object of the affections of both Dodge and Carter. Lexie has been assigned to find proof that Carter's war heroics are bogus. Carter confesses that the surrender of the Germans was a lucky accident and that his role in it was more foolish than heroic. Carter soon discovers Lexie's agenda and is doubly hurt when he learns that Dodge and Lexie are starting to show affections for each other and even shared a kiss. The ensuing fight over Lexie's affections puts her off. Spurred on by the threats of Carter's manager, she decides to publish the story.\n\nThe story sparks a firestorm of accusations and reprimands. Carter's manager resorts to shady dealing to cover it up, even bribing the original witness to change his story.\n\nDodge's attempts to legitimize pro football take on a life of their own. The new commissioner of football appointed by the US Congress, formalizes the game's rules, taking away improvisational antics. In addition, the commissioner takes the responsibility of clearing up the Carter controversy to set an example for the new direction of professional football.\n\nWith the whole world against Lexie (even the ''Tribune'' is pushing her to retract her story), Dodge concocts a clever ruse. Interrupting a private hearing in the commissioner's office, Dodge threatens Carter with a confrontation by his old army mates. Dodge claims that they are just outside the door, ready to congratulate him for his heroic actions. In truth, the men are Bulldogs in borrowed Army uniforms.\n\nCarter confesses the truth. The commissioner frees Lexie from printing a retraction. Carter is ordered to simply say he got too much credit for his war actions, but must give a hefty part of his paycheck to the American Legion. Carter's conniving manager is banned from football as well. Dodge is warned that if he pulls any old tricks to win the next game, he will lose his place in the league.\n\nDodge plays in one last game. This time it will be against Carter, who has changed sides from Duluth to Chicago. The rivalry for Lexie's affection spills onto the field.\n\nThe game does not go well for Dodge, including how muddy the field is. Dodge decides football should be played without rules. Lexie notices that after a brawl, Dodge is missing and with most players covered in mud, no one can tell who is who. There appears to be an interception and Chicago seems to have won, but when the mud is removed it is seen that the player is none other than Dodge Connelly, who disguised himself as a Chicago player on the play. The play is changed from an interception to a touchdown, and the Bulldogs win.\n\nCarter tells Dodge that Dodge is finished playing football, based on the threat the commissioner had made. He intends to tell the newspapers the real story about his \"capture\" of the German soldiers. Dodge argues that America \"needs\" heroes and it is implied the true story will not be told. Dodge and Carter part on good terms once again.\n\nAfter the game, Dodge meets up with Lexie and they ride into the sunset on Dodge's motorbike, discussing with humor the possibilities in their future, which include bankruptcy, scandals and jail time.  During the end credits, pictures show Dodge and Lexie getting married, Carter donating $10,000 to the US military and Carter's former manager with new clients [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Lou Gehrig]].\n\n==Real-life basis==\nIn an interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Clooney mentioned the plot is loosely based on [[George Halas]]'s signing of [[University of Illinois]] football star [[Harold \"Red\" Grange]].  Grange was signed to a contract with the [[Chicago Bears]] in 1925, the day after his final game at Illinois.\n\nThe team itself is loosely based on the [[Duluth Eskimos]]. Clooney later explained that \"We wanted to call them the Eskimos, but because we were drinking in the movie, the NFL said we couldn't use the actual names.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Kelleher |title=Hundred of fans welcome Clooney, Zellweger to Duluth |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/03/24/duluthvisit/ |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |date=2008-03-24 |access-date=2009-08-18}}</ref> The [[Canton Bulldogs]] was the first successful pro football team, which is why the [[Professional Football Hall of Fame]] is located in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[Ohio]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[George Clooney]] as Jimmy \"Dodge\" Connelly\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Lexie Littleton\n* [[John Krasinski]] as Carter Rutherford\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as CC\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Suds\n* [[Wayne Duvall]] as Coach Frank Ferguson\n* [[Keith Loneker]] as Big Gus\n* [[Malcolm Goodwin]] as Bakes\n* Matt Bushell as Curly\n* [[Tim Griffin (actor)|Tim Griffin]] as Ralph\n* [[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]] as Stump\n* Nick Paones as Zoom\n* Nick Bourdages as Bug\n* [[Jeremy Ratchford]] as Eddie\n* Alex Via as Scoreboard Keeper\n* Cody Froelich as Scoreboard Keeper\n* [[Max Casella]] as Mack Steiner\n* [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]] as Harvey\n* [[Peter Gerety]] as Commissioner Pete Harpin\n* Bill Roberson as  Mr. Dunn\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Chicago Referee\n* [[Marian Seldes]] as Clerk\n* [[Thomas Francis Murphy (actor)|Thomas Francis Murphy]] as Cook \n* [[Ledisi|Ledisi Young]] as Blues Singer (performed song \"[[The Man I Love (song)|The Man I Love]]\")\n* Donnie Fowler as Chicago Tribune Reporter\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Leatherheads'' began filming on February 12, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|title =Box office business for Leatherheads|publisher=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379865/business|access-date=2008-03-20}}</ref> Filming locations mainly included locations in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], upstate [[South Carolina]] around [[Anderson, South Carolina|Anderson]], [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[Ware Shoals, South Carolina|Ware Shoals]], [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]] and [[Travelers Rest, South Carolina|Travelers Rest]], as well as [[Boiling Springs, South Carolina|Boiling Springs]]  and western [[North Carolina]] around [[Statesville, North Carolina|Statesville]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] and [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], specifically at Hanes Middle School and the Winston-Salem Millennium Center.
