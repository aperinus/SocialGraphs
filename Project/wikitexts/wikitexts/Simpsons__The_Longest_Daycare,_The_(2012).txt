In the film, [[Maggie Simpson]] is enrolled at a new daycare facility where she squares off with the foul-tempered [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Baby Gerald|Baby Gerald]] when she befriends a caterpillar. The short originated with ''Simpsons'' producer [[James L. Brooks]], who enlisted long-time veteran of the series [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] to direct the film. The picture was written by producers Brooks, [[Al Jean]], [[David Mirkin]], writers [[Michael Price (writer)|Michael Price]] and [[Joel H. Cohen]], as well as the show's creator [[Matt Groening]], who also produced the short.\n\nThe film premiered on July 13, 2012, where it was attached to screenings of the [[20th Century Fox]] release ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''. The film is the second ''Simpsons'' theatrical release. The short was re-released on February 15, 2013 and played before the film ''[[Life of Pi (film)|Life of Pi]]'' in selected theaters in United States.<ref name=\"pi\" /> Reception has been positive, praising the storytelling and animation. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] in [[85th Academy Awards|2013]], losing to ''[[Paperman]]''.<ref name=\"oscarnom\" />\n\n==Plot==\n[[Marge Simpson]] drops off [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] at the [[A Streetcar Named Marge|Ayn Rand School for Tots]], where, after going through a security screening, she is classified as being of \"average intelligence\", by a machine manufactured by \"Often-Wrong Technologies\". A guard then carries her past the \"Room for Gifted Babies\" and puts her in the \"Nothing Special\" dreary corner.  The playtime items are either taken away or eaten by the other babies.  A butterfly then makes its way into the room as Maggie's nemesis, [[Baby Gerald]], squashes and kills it on the wall with a mallet and draws a box around it with a [[crayon]].  A second butterfly also meets the same fate.  Maggie finds a caterpillar and a [[pop-up book]] about the [[Butterfly#Life cycle|life cycle of the butterfly]].  Realizing that the caterpillar could also meet the fate of the first two butterflies, she tries to protect it from Gerald.  The caterpillar later encases itself in a [[chrysalis]] and starts to transform.  Once the newly formed butterfly emerges, Maggie tries to help it fly out of the window, but Gerald seemingly kills it by shutting the blinds on it as it attempts to pass through.  Maggie dramatically mourns as she falls to the floor.  Marge then arrives to pick her up, when it is revealed Maggie's scene was only a [[Ruse of war|ruse]] to cover the truth: she had slipped her hair bow onto the windowsill and wore the butterfly on her forehead in its place.  She then sets the butterfly free as Marge drives her home.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Jameslbrooks.jpg|alt=James L. Brooks standing in a crowd being photographed|150px|thumb|left|''[[The Simpsons]]'' executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] conceived the idea of producing a short film based on the series.]]\nThe origins of ''The Longest Daycare'' came about when ''The Simpsons'' executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] proposed the idea of making a short film and releasing it in cinemas in front of a feature film\u2014similar to how animation film studio [[Pixar]] creates shorts to play before their feature films.<ref name=\"snierson\" /> He wanted the short to be a fun gift for the fans of ''The Simpsons'', and according to the series' [[showrunner]] [[Al Jean]], \"We [the staff] just wanted to do this as a way of saying, 'We appreciate how much people have stayed with the show and watched it for 25 years.'\"<ref name=\"snierson\" /> Brooks picked [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], long-time veteran of the series and director of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' (2007) to oversee the film.<ref name=\"snierson\" /> Silverman gave credit to [[Richard Sakai]] for the idea to produce the film in stereoscopic 3-D. He considered the reasoning for employing 3-D \"hard to describe,\" noting that was largely an experiment and its genesis was born out of \"having fun.\"<ref name=\"awn\" /><ref name=\"hr\" />\n[[File:David Silverman in 2007-cropped.JPG|150px|thumb|right|The film was directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]].]]\nThe group first gathered in March 2011\u2014consisting of Brooks, Silverman, Al Jean, [[David Mirkin]], writers [[Joel H. Cohen|Joel Cohen]] and [[Michael Price (writer)|Michael Price]], and ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] via phone\u2014to pitch ideas for a short. Early on, it was decided to keep it entirely silent and employ Maggie as the lead character, and the setting of a daycare was decided upon.<ref name=\"hr\" /> Jean wrote the [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the film, and Silverman completed an [[animatic]] of early story reels in June 2011. By the following February, the team regrouped to structure the story and formulate more ideas.<ref name=\"awn\" /> With the help of Brad Ableson, Erick Tran and Ben Lane, the storyboards and animatic for the short were approved and the film entered production. Silverman himself animated two shots present in the final film.<ref name=\"am\" />\n\nSilverman and his crew began animation work on the short in March 2012, completing in May after just under ten weeks of production. He considered his crew \"very experienced\", noting that he worked with stereographer Eric Kurland for the 3-D shots.<ref name=\"awn\" /> It was animated with ''The Simpsons''{{'s}} usual production pipeline, which involved sending shots to [[AKOM]] in [[South Korea]], but with an amplified focus on the 3-D.  The team would attempt to complete ten scenes to send to AKOM per week, which would be returned in a cleaned-up form after two weeks.<ref name=\"am\" /> Shots were then composited together at Film Roman out of necessity as the backgrounds relied on the 3-D.<ref name=\"awn\" /> Most stereo elements for 3-D were picked out after shots were cleaned up, while others were manipulated in post-production with After Effects.<ref name=\"awn\" /> The short was more costly than the average episode of the television show.<ref name=\"hr\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The Longest Daycare'' was first announced to the public in a title card at the end of the series' twenty-third-season finale \"[[Lisa Goes Gaga]]\" that aired on May 20, 2012.<ref name=\"snierson\" /> It was revealed that the short would be shown in theaters in the United States prior to screenings of the film ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', starting on July 13, 2012. Like ''The Simpsons'', ''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' was produced by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"snierson\" /> A teaser trailer for ''The Longest Daycare'', lasting approximately five seconds, was released on July 3, 2012.<ref name=\"trailers\" /> This was the second time that characters from ''The Simpsons'' appeared on the big screen, as ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' was released in 2007. Coincidentally, the trailer for that film was first attached to screenings of the ''Continental Drift'' predecessor ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''.<ref name=\"snierson\" />\n\nA 2D version of the short was displayed by the producers of ''The Simpsons'' at the series' panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 14, 2012.<ref name=\"snierson\" /><ref name=\"comiccon\" />\n\nIt had its world television premiere on [[Network Ten]] in Australia on February 17, 2013 at 6:25{{nbsp}}pm,<ref name=\"foxitaly\" /> 5 hours before it premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the USA but 16 hours later in real time due to time zone differences, right after ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Hardly Kirk-ing]]\".<ref name=\"foxus\" /> It was also aired in the UK on the same day on Sky 1 at 9:55{{nbsp}}am, 12 noon and 7:30{{nbsp}}pm and on Channel 4 at 1:30{{nbsp}}pm [[GMT]]. It also premiered on the same day, at 7:55{{nbsp}}pm on Prima COOL, in the Czech Republic and on FOX Brasil at 8:30{{nbsp}}pm.\n\nAfter being nominated for an [[Academy Award]], ''The Longest Daycare'' was released along with all the other 15 Oscar-nominated short films in theaters by [[ShortsHD]].<ref name=\"NYT\" /><ref name=\"NYT2\" />\n\nThe short became available on [[Disney+]] on May 29, 2020.<ref name=\"d+\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''The Longest Daycare'' has received critical acclaim. Many film critics have said that the short was better than ''Ice Age: Continental Drift''.<ref name=\"nypost\" /><ref name=\"Spake\" /><ref name=\"Puig\" /><ref name=\"Paatsch\" /><ref name=\"Biancolli\" /><ref name=\"Williams\" /><ref name=\"Lin\" /><ref name=\"Scott-12/07\" /> Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' argued that \"the brief tale is far more clever and whimsical than any sequence in ''Ice Age''.\"<ref name=\"Puig\" /> Similarly, ''[[Sun Herald]]'' critic Leigh Paatsch said the short \"displays all the wit and creativity missing from ''Continental Drift''.\"<ref name=\"Paatsch\" /> ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' writer Amy Biancolli commented that the short is \"only a few minutes long, but those few minutes boast more imagination, pathos and suspense than the entire film that follows.\"<ref name=\"Biancolli\" /> Joe Williams of the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' wrote that while the short takes place in a daycare, it ironically features more \"artistic maturity\" than ''Continental Drift''.<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n\n''The Longest Daycare'' has been praised for being both humorous and emotional. Puig and Biancolli described the short as \"hilarious\".<ref name=\"Puig\" /><ref name=\"Biancolli\" /> Bill Goodykoontz of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' stated that the film is \"terrific\u2014sweet, sad, funny, surprising,\"<ref name=\"Goodykoontz\" /> and Kristian Lin of ''[[Fort Worth Weekly]]'' said it is \"clever\" and \"surprisingly moving\".<ref name=\"Lin\" />  Writing for ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press|Pioneer Press]]'', Chris Hewitt noted that Maggie's interaction with Gerald \"is hilarious and, ultimately, poignant in an animated film that covers more territory, all without dialogue, than most full-length movies.\"<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> He went on to call the short a \"triumph of storytelling, pacing and big-hearted humor.\"<ref name=\"Hewitt\" />\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the short a \"charming 3-D cartoon\" that is \"witty and touching and marvelously concise\".<ref name=\"Scott-12/07\">{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.

It also upholds (more than the TV series itself) one of the golden rules of animation: no talking.\"<ref name=\"Scott-12/07\"/> Tim Martain of ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]'' has also described the short as \"touching\".<ref name=\"Martain\" /> ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'}}s Tom Russo thought the short was \"a welcome throwback to the days when ''The Simpsons'' had more sentiment at its core, and wasn\u2019t so much about the latest batch of newbie [[Ivy League]] writers taking their cues from ''[[Family Guy]]''.\"<ref name=\"Russo\" /> In a joint review of the episode \"[[Hardly Kirk-ing]]\", Teresa Lopez of TV fanatic said \"''The Longest Daycare'' was a beautiful piece of animation showcasing a tender story of hope in an otherwise bleak environment. I feel like the only time ''The Simpsons'' can really exercise some creativity and depth is in these shorts and during the show's opening sequence.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Spiritual sequels==\nSubsequent episodes involving Maggie as a protagonist have been produced including [[The Simpsons (season 27)|2015's]] \"[[Puffless]]\" and [[The Simpsons (season 31)|2020's]] \"[[The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby]].\"<ref name=\"jean\" />\n\nOn March 6, 2020, a new short film with Maggie Simpson called ''[[Playdate with Destiny]]'' premiered with the release of ''[[Onward (film)|Onward]]'' from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] and [[Pixar]],<ref name=\"pwd\" /> with a further short featuring Maggie Simpson titled ''[[The Force Awakens from Its Nap]]'' released on [[Disney+]] on May 4, 2021, [[Star Wars Day|''Star Wars'' day]].
