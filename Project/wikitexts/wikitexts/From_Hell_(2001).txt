It is loosely based on the [[From Hell|graphic novel of the same name]] by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Eddie Campbell]] about the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Frederick Abberline]], the lead investigator of the murders, and [[Heather Graham]] as [[Mary Jane Kelly|Mary Kelly]], a prostitute targeted by the Ripper. Other cast members include [[Ian Holm]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Ian Richardson]] and [[Jason Flemyng]].\n\n''From Hell'' was theatrically released in the United States on October 19, 2001 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film grossed over $74 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the performances (particularly those of Depp and Graham), atmosphere and production values, but was negatively compared to its source material.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1888, [[Mary Jane Kelly|Mary Kelly]] and a small group of London prostitutes trudge through unrelenting daily misery. Their friend Ann Crook is a former prostitute now married to a wealthy painter named Albert, and she has recently given birth to a daughter, Alice. When Ann is kidnapped, the women are drawn into a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] with links to high society. Ann's kidnapping is followed by the gruesome murder of another one of the women, and it soon becomes apparent that each of the prostitutes is being hunted, murdered and mutilated post-mortem by a killer called [[Jack the Ripper]].\n\nThe prostitute murders grab the attention of [[Whitechapel]] [[Police Inspector|police inspector]] [[Frederick Abberline]], a brilliant yet troubled man whose police work is often aided by his [[psychic]] \"visions.\" Abberline is still grieving the death of his wife during childbirth two years earlier. His colleague Sergeant Peter Godley tries to grasp Abberline's strange theories. Abberline's investigations reveal that an educated person, likely knowledgeable in human anatomy, is responsible for the murders because of the highly precise, surgical methods used.\n\nAnn is soon located in a [[workhouse]] after being [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] because doctors deemed her violent and insane. It is implied that the operation was performed in order to silence her.\n\nAbberline consults [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], a physician to the royal family, drawing on his experience and knowledge of medicine. During this meeting, Gull deduces that Abberline is struggling with [[opium addiction]]. Gull's findings point Abberline to a darker, more organized conspiracy than he had originally suspected. Abberline becomes deeply involved with the case, which takes on personal meaning when he falls in love with Mary.\n\nAbberline deduces that [[Freemason]] influence is involved in the murders. His superior, a high-ranking Freemason, opposes Abberline's methods and suspends him from the case. Thereafter, Abberline persists and discovers that Gull is the killer. Gull was instructed to dispose of all witnesses to the forbidden marriage of painter [[Walter Sickert|Albert Sickert]] to Ann Crook, the mother of his legitimate daughter, Alice. Sickert is revealed to be [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], grandson of reigning [[Queen Victoria]]. Albert is dying of [[syphilis]], which makes baby Alice the soon-to-be heiress to the British throne. Gull boasts to Abberline that he will be remembered in history for giving \"birth to the 20th century.\" Abberline draws his gun, vowing that Gull will never see the 20th century, but before he is able to shoot Gull, he is knocked out by Ben Kidney, another Freemason.\n\nThe Freemasons try to eliminate Abberline without leaving any witnesses, but Abberline fights back and kills two of the assassins by overturning a carriage. Abberline rushes to save Mary but arrives too late, and blames his superior for not helping him or Godley on the cases. Gull's increasingly sinister behavior lends an insight into his murderous, but calculating, mind. Rather than publicly charge Gull, the Freemasons lobotomize him to protect themselves and the royal family from the scandal. Gull defiantly states he has no equal among men, remaining unrepentant until the operation, which renders him an invalid like Ann.\n\nAbberline goes to the Ten Bells Tavern in Whitechapel and receives a mysterious letter from Mary. It is revealed that Gull had mistaken another prostitute, Ada, for Mary and killed her instead. To protect Mary, Abberline decides not to look for her, as the Freemasons are still watching him closely. He burns Mary's letter, knowing that he can never have a normal life with her. Sergeant Godley later finds Abberline dead of an opium overdose. Distraught, Godley places two coins over Abberline's eyes and mournfully says, \"Good night, sweet prince.\"\n\nYears later, Mary is shown to have adopted Alice, and the two are living in a cottage on a cliff by the sea.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], a sympathetic police officer who investigates the Ripper murders.
