Astle and Matt Ember and produced by [[Leonard B. Stern]], who is also the producer of the original series. The film is based on [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Buck Henry]]'s television series of the [[Get Smart|same name]].\n\nThe film stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Dwayne Johnson]], and [[Alan Arkin]], with [[Terence Stamp]], [[Terry Crews]], [[David Koechner]], and [[James Caan]] in supporting roles. [[Bernie Kopell]], who played Siegfried in the original series, also appeared in the film. The film centers on an analyst named Maxwell Smart (Carell) who dreams of becoming a real field agent and a better spy. The film was released in North America on June 20, 2008.\n\n''Get Smart'' received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, earning $230 million on an $80 million budget.<ref name=BOM/><ref name=\"boxoffice\" />\n\n==Plot==\nMaxwell Smart, an analyst for the top secret American intelligence agency, [[CONTROL (Get Smart)|CONTROL]], yearns to become a [[field agent]] like his idol, Agent 23. Despite top scores in the acceptance tests, Smart is denied the promotion due to his higher value as an analyst. When CONTROL headquarters is attacked by the [[Terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[KAOS (Get Smart)|KAOS]], almost all of CONTROL's agents' identities are exposed, leaving only Agent 99 as a viable field operative. Smart is also promoted to field agent as Agent 86, but the experienced 99 is reluctant to partner with him due to his inexperience.  On the first day of his new job, Smart receives a [[Swiss Army knife]] which includes special add-ons like a miniature flamethrower and a [[crossbow]] that shoots darts attached to spider web thread.\n\nWhile on a plane to [[Moscow]], Agent 99 spots a threatening looking man in the back. She suspects he is an [[assassin]], but Smart brushes it off as profiling.  Max notices gum on his shoe and tries to remove it with a matchstick.  When passengers assume Max is attempting to blow up the aircraft, he is tackled by an Air Marshal and his hands are put into zip ties. Max requests to use the bathroom, and while inside attempts to break his zip ties using the crossbow on his pocketknife. He does finally break the zip tie, but one of the darts hits the \"eject\" button and leaves him plummeting towards the earth with no parachute. Agent 99 follows with a parachute, as does the assassin. The latter is prevented from making all three crash when Agent 99 kisses him, surprising him enough for her to deploy the parachute. The assassin crashes in a barn, and Agent 99 and Smart assume he is dead, though he is berated by her for the incident.\n\nThe two arrive at the mansion of KAOS' chief bomb-maker, Ladislas Krstic, during a party. Upon the completion of an intense dance-off they infiltrate the main office and trace nuclear material to a KAOS nuclear weapons factory disguised as a [[Moscow]] bakery. They are caught by Krstic and his men, but eliminate all of them successfully. In the bakery, Smart meets with KAOS boss Siegfried and his second-in-command, Shtarker, only to learn that a double-agent has compromised their identities. Smart manages to escape and destroy the weapons factory, but he and Agent 99 are confronted by the same man that they had assumed dead earlier. All seems lost, but Smart recognizes the man as [[Jaws (James Bond)|Dalip]], who was in a recording taken during Smart's time as an analyst. He gives Dalip advice on fixing his failing marriage, and Dalip promptly lets them go.\n\nThe Chief sends Agent 23 to observe the cleanup of the factory, but KAOS sneaks the weapons out through the [[Moskva River]] beforehand, leaving Agent 23 convinced that only a bakery had been destroyed. Realizing that Smart was alone during his key discoveries, CONTROL believes him to be the [[double agent]]. Agent 99, who has gradually been developing feelings with Smart, is heartbroken but takes him into custody, just when he starts suspecting that she is the double agent. Meanwhile, conferring with Shtarker, Siegfried plans to detonate a nuclear bomb in [[Los Angeles]] while the [[President of the United States|President]] is in the city.\n\nSiegfried contacts the U.S. government during a meeting attended by the Chief and the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and threatens to release nuclear weapon detonator codes to hostile countries unless he is paid a ransom of $200 billion. The members of the meeting, especially the Vice President (who has intense enmity towards the Chief), do not take the call seriously, to the Chief's dismay. While Smart is in a CONTROL holding cell, Dalip sends him a coded message via the radio show ''[[American Top 40]]'' posing as his girlfriend, alerting him to Siegfried's plan. Smart escapes and arrives in Los Angeles to reunite with the Chief, Agent 99, and Agent 23. He convinces them that he is not the double agent. Meanwhile, as the President arrives at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall|Disney Hall]] for a concert, Siegfried, Shtarker and Dalip plant the bomb in the concert hall. When Smart's [[Geiger counter]]-equipped watch picks up traces of radiation from Agent 23, they realize Agent 23 is the real double agent.\n\nAgent 23 takes Agent 99 hostage and flees in a vehicle. After a chase, Smart manages to rescue Agent 99, but in the struggle, the car is set on fire and forced onto railroad tracks. Smart kisses Agent 23 to distract him, a trick learned from Agent 99. He and Agent 99 are thrown off the vehicle before it collides with a freight train, killing Agent 23. After analyzing Agent 23's nuclear football, Smart realizes that the bomb will be triggered by the final note of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s \"[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ode to Joy]]\". They rush to the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall|Disney Hall]], and Smart tackles the elderly [[conducting|conductor]] just before the final note, saving the President and Los Angeles. Siegfried, despite his plan failing, is satisfied with Dalip's performance and promises not to kill his wife as he would have had Dalip failed, but states that he would be 'doing the sighted world a favor' if he did. In response, Dalip throws Siegfried into a river, much to Shtarker's delight.\n\nBack in CONTROL headquarters, a party is held in Smart's honor, where Agent 99 gives him a puppy. Smart is afterwards given honors and gets his dream of becoming a real spy. While leaving, Smart attempts to fix a jammed door, and ends up jammed between the sliding doors as a humorous ending shot, and the film cuts to black, and Smart angrily yells (offscreen) \"You gotta be kidding me!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Steve Carell]] as [[Get Smart#CONTROL|Maxwell Smart]]\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as [[Get Smart#CONTROL|Agent 99]]\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Agent 23\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as [[Get Smart#CONTROL|The Chief]]\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as [[Get Smart#KAOS|Siegfried]]\n* [[Masi Oka]] as Bruce\n* [[Nate Torrence]] as Lloyd\n* [[The Great Khali|Dalip Singh]] as [[Jaws (James Bond)|Dalip]]\n* [[Ken Davitian]] as Shtarker\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Agent 91, a CONTROL agent.\n* [[David Koechner]] as [[Get Smart#CONTROL|Larabee]]\n* [[James Caan]] as [[President of the United States|The President]]\n* David S.
