Joffe]]. The film stars Allen as Alvy Singer, who tries to figure out the reasons for the failure of his relationship with the eponymous female lead, played by [[Diane Keaton]] in a role written specifically for her.\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began on May 19, 1976, on the South Fork of [[Long Island]], and continued periodically for the next ten months. Allen has described the result, which marked his first collaboration with cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]], as \"a major turning point\",<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman75\">{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rkman|1995|p=75}}</ref> in that unlike the farces and comedies that were his work to that point, it introduced a new level of seriousness. Academics have noted the contrast in the settings of New York City and Los Angeles, the stereotype of gender differences in sexuality, the presentation of [[Jewish identity]], and the elements of [[psychoanalysis]] and [[modernism]].\n\n''Annie Hall'' was screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] on March 27, 1977, before its official release in the United States on April 20, 1977. The film was highly praised, was nominated for the [[List of Big Five Academy Award winners and nominees|Big Five Academy Awards]], winning four: the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], two for Allen ([[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and, with Brickman, [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Keaton. The film additionally won four [[BAFTA awards]] and a [[Golden Globe]], the latter being awarded to Keaton. The film's North American box office receipts of $38,251,425 are fourth-best of Allen's works when not adjusted for inflation.\n\n[[List of films considered the best|Ranking among the best films]] ever made, it ranks 31st on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|AFI's List of the greatest films]] in American cinema, 4th on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|their list of greatest comedy films]] and 28th on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\".

Growing up in Brooklyn, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, but he was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity, suddenly kissing a classmate at six years old and not understanding why she was not keen to reciprocate.\n\nAnnie and Alvy, in a line for ''[[The Sorrow and the Pity]],'' overhear another man deriding the work of [[Federico Fellini]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]; Alvy  imagines McLuhan himself stepping in at his invitation to criticize the man's comprehension. That night, Annie shows no interest in sex with Alvy. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whose ardor gave him no pleasure. His second marriage was to a New York writer who didn't like sports and was unable to reach orgasm.\n\nWith Annie, it is different. The two of them have fun making a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. He met her playing [[Doubles (tennis)|tennis doubles]] with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk leads her to offer him a ride uptown, and then a glass of wine on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in \"mental subtitles\" as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club (\"[[It Had to Be You (song)|It Had to be You]]\"). After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is \"a wreck\", while Annie relaxes with a [[cannabis (drug)|joint]].\n\nSoon, Annie admits she loves Alvy, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love. When Annie moves in with him, things become very tense. Eventually, Alvy finds her arm-in-arm with one of her college professors, and the two begin to argue about whether this is the \"flexibility\" they had discussed. They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, and imagining a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon Annie portrayed as the [[Evil Queen]] in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]''.\n\nAlvy attempts a return to dating, but the effort is marred by neurosis and an episode of bad sex that is interrupted when Annie calls in the middle of the night, insisting that he come over immediately to kill two spiders in her bathroom. A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together, come what may. However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken and unbridgeable divide. When Alvy accepts an offer to present an award on television, they fly out to Los Angeles with Alvy's friend, Rob. However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working. After losing Annie to her record producer, Tony Lacey, Alvy unsuccessfully tries rekindling the flame with a marriage proposal. Back in New York, he stages a play of their relationship, but changes the ending: now she accepts.\n\nThe last meeting between Annie and Alvy is a wistful coda on New York's Upper West Side after they have both moved on to someone new. Alvy's voice returns with a summation: love is essential, especially if it is [[neuroticism|neurotic]]. Annie sings \"[[Seems Like Old Times (song)|Seems Like Old Times]]\", and the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:TrumanCapote1959.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Truman Capote]], pictured here in 1959, had a cameo role in the film.]]\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Alvy Singer\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Annie Hall\n* [[Tony Roberts (actor)|Tony Roberts]] as Rob\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Allison Portchnik\n* [[Paul Simon]] as Tony Lacey\n* [[Janet Margolin]] as Robin\n* [[Shelley Duvall]] as Pam\n* [[Christopher Walken]]{{efn|Misspelled as \"Christopher Wlaken\" in the closing credits.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/christopher-walken-birthday-best-movies-ranked-age-76-1379798 |title=To celebrate Christopher Walken's 76th birthday, we rank his best 20 movies |last=Sim |first=David |date=March 31, 2019 |website=[[Newsweek]] |access-date=May 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505023715/https://www.newsweek.com/christopher-walken-birthday-best-movies-ranked-age-76-1379798 |archive-date=May 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}} as Duane Hall\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Mrs. Hall\n* [[Donald Symington]] as Mr. Hall\n* Joan Newman as Mrs. Singer\n* [[Marshall McLuhan]] as Himself\n* [[Mordecai Lawner]] as Alvy's father\n[[Truman Capote]] has a cameo.

[[Laurie Bird]] also appears, two years before her suicide.\n\n==Style and technique==\nTechnically, the film marked an advance for the director. He selected [[Gordon Willis]] as his [[cinematographer]]\u2014for Allen \"a very important teacher\" and a \"technical wizard,\" saying, \"I really count ''Annie Hall'' as the first step toward maturity in some way in making films.\"<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman77\">{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rkman|1995|p=77}}</ref> At the time, it was considered an \"odd pairing\" by many, Keaton among them. The director was known for his comedies and farces, while Willis was known as \"the prince of darkness\" for work on dramatic films like ''[[The Godfather (film)|The Godfather]]''.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\">{{cite video |people=Weide, Robert B. (Director) |year=2011 |title=Woody Allen: A Documentary |medium=Television |publisher=[[PBS]] }}</ref> Despite this, the two became friends during filming and continued the collaboration on several later films, including ''[[Zelig]]'', which earned Willis his first Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\"/>\n\nWillis described the production for the film as \"relatively easy.\"<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\"/> He shot in varying styles; \"hot golden light for [[California]], grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for&nbsp;... dream sequences,\" most of which were cut.<ref name=\"baxter248\">{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=2487}}</ref> It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] method.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\"/> He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: \"Few viewers probably notice how much of ''Annie Hall'' consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton is as close to perfect as such a speech can likely be&nbsp;... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship.\" He cites a study that calculated the [[average shot length]] of ''Annie Hall'' to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4\u20137 seconds.<ref name=\"ebert\"/> [[Peter Cowie]] suggests that \"Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cowie|1996|p=47}}</ref> Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation in the use of the split-screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.<ref name=\"Herzogenrath\"/>\n\nAlthough the film is not essentially experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter J.|last=Bailey|title=The Reluctant Film Art of Woody Allen|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|date=September 29, 2010|page=35|isbn=978-0813139241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5rGWBIW_FgC&pg=PA35}}</ref> James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film.<ref name=\"Bernardoni01\"/> In one scene, Allen's character, in line to see a movie with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off-camera to correct the man's errors personally.<ref name=\"ebert\"/> Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, \"mental subtitles\" convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts.<ref name=\"ebert\"/> An animated scene\u2014with artwork based on the [[comic strip]] ''[[Inside Woody Allen]]''\u2014depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]''.<ref name=\"ebert\"/> Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the \"[[fourth wall]]\" is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another, he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable \"wish-fulfillment.\" Allen chose to have Alvy break the [[fourth wall]], he explained, \"because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them.\"<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman77\"/>\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nThe idea for what would become ''Annie Hall'' was developed as Allen walked around [[New York City]] with co-writer [[Marshall Brickman]]. The pair discussed the project frequently, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on a man in his forties, someone whose life consisted \"of several strands.\" One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of the life that we all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find out what kind of character he had. Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that \"advancing age\" and \"worries about death\" had influenced Allen's philosophical, personal approach to complement his \"commercial side\".<ref name=rose274>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=274}}</ref><ref name=\"baxter241\"/> Allen made the conscious decision to \"sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings\".<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\"/> He recognized that for the first time he had the courage to abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman75\"/> He was also influenced by Federico Fellini's comedy drama ''[[8\u00bd]]'' (1963), created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director's [[psychoanalysis]].<ref name=\"baxter241\"/>\n\nBrickman and Allen sent the screenplay back and forth until they were ready to ask [[United Artists]] for $4&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"baxter241\">{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=241}}</ref> Many elements from the early drafts did not survive. It was originally a drama centered on a murder mystery with a comic and romantic subplot.<ref name=\"Lax283\">{{harvnb|Lax|2000|p=283}}</ref> According to Allen, the murder occurred after a scene that remains in the film, the sequence in which Annie and Alvy miss the Ingmar Bergman film ''[[Face to Face (1976 film)|Face to Face]]'' (1976).<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman79\"/> Although they decided to drop the murder plot, Allen and Brickman made a murder mystery many years later: ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993), also starring Diane Keaton.{{Sfn|Mitchell|2001|p=123}} The draft that Allen presented to the film's editor, [[Ralph Rosenblum]], concluded with the words, \"ending to be shot.\"<ref name=rose262>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=262}}</ref>\n\nAllen suggested ''[[Anhedonia]]'', a term for the inability to experience pleasure, as a working title,<ref name=\"baxter245\">{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=245}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Mel |last=Gussow |author-link=Mel Gussow |title=Woody Allen Fights Anhedonia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/annie-ar.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 20, 1977 |access-date=February 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312025455/http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/annie-ar.html |archive-date=March 12, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and Brickman suggested alternatives including ''It Had to Be Jew'', ''Rollercoaster Named Desire'' and ''Me and My Goy''.<ref name=rose289>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=289}}</ref> An advertising agency, hired by United Artists, embraced Allen's choice of an obscure word by suggesting the studio take out newspaper advertisements that looked like fake tabloid headlines such as \"Anhedonia Strikes Cleveland!\".<ref name=\"rose289\"/> However, Allen experimented with several titles over five test screenings, including ''Anxiety'' and ''Annie and Alvy'', before settling on ''Annie Hall''.<ref name=rose289/>\n\n===Casting===\nSeveral references in the film to Allen's own life have invited speculation that it is autobiographical. Both Alvy and Allen were comedians. His birthday appears on the blackboard in a school scene, and \"Alvy\" was one of Allen's childhood nicknames;<ref name=\"spignesi185\">{{harvnb|Spignesi|1992|p=185}}</ref> certain features of his childhood are found in Alvy Singer's;<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman78\">{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rkman|1995|p=78}}</ref> Allen went to [[New York University]] and so did Alvy. Diane Keaton's real surname is \"Hall\" and \"Annie\" was her nickname, and she and Allen were once romantically involved.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman83\">{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rkman|1995|p=83}}</ref> However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions. \"The stuff that people insist is autobiographical is almost invariably not,\" Allen said. \"It's so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people upon whom these little nuances are based. People got it into their heads that ''Annie Hall'' was autobiographical, and I couldn't convince them it wasn't\".<ref>1987 interview with William Geist in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', cited in ({{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=244}}) and in ({{harvnb|Spignesi|1992|p=188}})</ref> Contrary to various interviewers and commentators, he says, Alvy is not the character that is closest to himself; he identified more with the mother (Eve, played by [[Geraldine Page]]) in his next film, ''[[Interiors]]''.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman86\">{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rkman|1995|p=86}}</ref> Despite this, Keaton has stated that the relationship between Alvy and Annie was partly based on her relationship with the director.<ref name=\"keatonmemoir\">Diane Keaton. ''Then Again: A Memoir'', 2011.</ref>\n\nThe role of Annie Hall was written specifically for Keaton, who had worked with Allen on ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973) and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"keatonmemoir\"/> She considered the character an \"affable version\" of herself\u2014both were \"semi-articulate, dreamed of being a singer and suffered from insecurity\"\u2014and was surprised to win an Oscar for her performance.<ref name=\"keatonmemoir\"/> The film also marks the second film collaboration between Allen and Tony Roberts, their previous project being ''Play It Again, Sam''.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\"/>\n\nFederico Fellini was Allen's first choice to appear in the cinema lobby scene because his films were under discussion,<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman79\">{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rkman|1995|p=79}}</ref> but Allen chose cultural academic Marshall McLuhan after both Fellini and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] declined the cameo.<ref name=\"baxter249\">{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=249}}</ref> Some cast members, biographer John Baxter claims, were aggrieved at Allen's treatment of them. The director \"acted coldly\" towards McLuhan, who had to return from Canada for reshooting, and [[Mordecai Lawner]], who played Alvy's father, claimed that Allen never spoke to him.<ref name=\"baxter249\"/> However, during the production, Allen began a two-year relationship with [[Stacey Nelkin]], who appears in a single scene.<ref name=\"baxter249\"/>\n\n===Filming, editing and music===\n[[File:ThunderboltConeyIsland1995.jpg|thumb|[[Woody Allen]] saw the [[Thunderbolt (Coney Island)|Coney Island Thunderbolt]] when scouting locations and wrote it into the script as Alvy's childhood home.<ref name=\"spignesi185\"/>]]\nPrincipal photography began on May 19, 1976, on the South Fork of [[Long Island]] with the scene in which Alvy and Annie boil live lobsters; filming continued periodically for the next ten months,<ref name=\"baxter247\">{{harvnb|Baxter |1999|p=247}}</ref> and deviated frequently from the screenplay. There was nothing written about Alvy's childhood home lying under a roller coaster, but when Allen was scouting locations in Brooklyn with Willis and art director Mel Bourne, he \"saw this roller-coaster, and&nbsp;... saw the house under it. And I thought, we have to use this.\"<ref name=\"Bj\u00f6rkman78\"/> Similarly, there is the incident where Alvy scatters a trove of cocaine with an accidental sneeze: although not in the script, the joke emerged from a rehearsal happenstance and stayed in the movie. In audience testing, this laugh was so sustained that a much longer pause had to be added so that the following dialogue was not lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=284-284}}</ref>\n\nEditor Ralph Rosenblum's first assembly of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. \"I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions,\" Brickman recalled.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|pp=280\u2013281}}</ref> \"It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=278}}</ref> Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes,<ref name=rose275>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=275}}</ref> as \"the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life and in the process satirizing much of our culture... a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of ''[[Take the Money and Run]]''\".<ref name=\"rose275\"/> Brickman found it \"nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise.\"<ref name=rose281>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=281}}</ref> He suggested a more linear narrative.<ref name=\"rose283\">{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=283}}</ref>\n\nThe present-tense relationship between Alvy and Annie was not the narrative focus of this first cut, but Allen and Rosenblum recognized it as the dramatic spine, and began reworking the film \"in the direction of that relationship.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|pp=281\u2013282}}</ref> Rosenblum recalled that Allen \"had no hesitation about trimming away much of the first twenty minutes in order to establish Keaton more quickly.\"<ref name=\"rose281\"/> According to Allen, \"I didn't sit down with Marshall Brickman and say, 'We're going to write a picture about a relationship.' I mean the whole concept of the picture changed as we were cutting it.\"<ref name=\"rose283\"/>\n\nAs the film was budgeted for two weeks of post-production photography,<ref name=\"rose262\"/> late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but only some of this material was used.<ref name=\"rose287\">{{harvnb|Rosenblum|Karen |1986|p=287}}</ref> The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.<ref name=\"rose287\"/>\n\nThe credits call the film \"A [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]] and [[Charles H. Joffe]] Production\"; the two men were Allen's managers and received this same credit on his films from 1969 to 1993. However, for this film, Joffe took producer credit and therefore received the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].
