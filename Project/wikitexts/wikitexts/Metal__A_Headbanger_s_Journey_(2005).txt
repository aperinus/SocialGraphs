each category. Below is a typed version of that chart, which can be found on the second disc of the film's special edition DVD package. A new version was presented in the related TV series [[Metal Evolution]] which included a new \"Pre-Metal\" field that listed non-metal bands that had an influence on heavy metal and also listed additional bands as examples of the various subgenres.\n\n[[File:Metal Genealogy.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The film's flow chart of metal genres.]]\n\n*'''[[Traditional heavy metal|Early Metal]] (1966\u20131971)''' \n<!-- DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE BANDS.

It currently holds a 90% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of 6.9/10 and the critical consensus being: \"Made by a metalhead, this documentary of the musical genre both informs and entertains with its range of interviewees.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/metal_a_headbangers_journey/ Metal: A Headbanger's Journey on Rotten Tomatoes] Retrieved on 18 November 2010</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSome brief controversy arose over the film's depiction of black metal, which many fans of the genre saw as being one-sided and biased during a screening documented in the film. In the special features to the DVD of the film, Dunn attempted a restitution to the concerns of the black metal fans by including an additional featurette.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180807081407/http://www.metalhistory.com/ Official Website]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0478209}}\n\n<!-- Please do not remove the 3 primary film categories -Year, Country, Language -->\n<!-- end of primary film categories -->\n\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Canadian documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about heavy metal music and musicians]]\n[[Category:2005 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Music fandom]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
