The film is a parable and marked the debut of [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] writer and director [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]]. It is a co-production among companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Slovenia]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Belgium]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The film was first premiered on 19 September 2001 in France. The film won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for  [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2002.\n\n==Plot== \nTwo wounded soldiers, a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] (\u010ciki, portrayed by [[Branko \u0110uri\u0107]]) and a [[Bosnian Serbs|Bosnian Serb]] (Nino, portrayed by [[Rene Bitorajac]]) are caught between their lines in the no man's land, in a struggle for survival.  The two soldiers confront each other in a trench, where they wait for dark. They trade insults and even find some common ground. Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier (Cera, portrayed by [[Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107]]) who wakes from unconsciousness. A [[land mine]] had been buried beneath him by the Bosnian Serbs; should he make any move, it would be fatal.\n\nA [[French Army|French]] sergeant (Marchand, portrayed by Georges Siatidis), of the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), gets involved in effort to help the three trapped soldiers, despite initial orders to the contrary by high command. UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia was to guard the [[humanitarian aid]] convoys, to remain neutral and act as a mere bystander. Luckily, an [[English people|English]] reporter arrives on scene, bringing media pressure to bear that moves the United Nations high command to swing into action to try to save the soldiers.\n\nA row between the stressed out and fatigued \u010ciki and Nino gradually escalated even after being rescued. Eventually, \u010ciki shoots Nino and is in turn shot by a Peacekeeper. Meanwhile, it is found that the mine cannot be defused. The UNPROFOR high command tries to save face: they lie, saying that Cera has been saved and they leave the area, along with the reporters and everyone else.\n\nIn reality, Cera is left alone and desolate in the trenches, still immobilized by the mine. Meanwhile, the UNPROFOR commander has arranged false information to be passed to both Bosnian and Serb troops, to make them believe their enemies will be trying to reoccupy the trench at night (which each side would try to counter with an [[artillery]] barrage that presumably will kill Cera and obliterate the evidence).\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Branko \u0110uri\u0107]] - \u010ciki\n*[[Rene Bitorajac]] - Nino\n*[[Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107]] - Cera\n*Georges Siatidis -  Sergeant Marchand\n*Serge-Henri Valcke - Captain Dubois\n*Sacha Kremer - Michel\n*Alain Eloy - Pierre\n*[[Mustafa Nadarevi\u0107]] - Older Serbian soldier\n*[[Bogdan Dikli\u0107]] - Serbian officer\n*[[Boro Stjepanovi\u0107]] - Bosnian soldier\n*[[Simon Callow]] - Colonel Soft\n*[[Katrin Cartlidge]] - Jane Livingstone, journalist\n*[[Tanja Ribi\u010d]] - Martha\n*Branko Zavr\u0161an - Deminer\n*{{ill|Mirza Tanovi\u0107|bs}} - officer\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Box Office ===\nThe film had an estimated budget of \u20ac2,000,000.
