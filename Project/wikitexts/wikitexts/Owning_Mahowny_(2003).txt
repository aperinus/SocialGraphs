His boss trusts him, but is unaware that Mahowny is a compulsive gambler. Mahowny is soon [[embezzlement|skimming]] larger and larger amounts for his own use and making weekly trips to [[Atlantic City]], where he is treated like a king by the [[casino]] manager.

Molony's story was told in the best-selling 1987 book ''Stung'' by journalist Gary Ross, which formed the basis for the screenplay.\n\nIn an interview on the web site of ''Stung'' publishers McClelland and Stewart, Ross says he has kept in touch with Molony and updated what happened to him after the events portrayed in the movie. Molony was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to fraud, eventually serving only two years of his sentence. He has not gambled since his arrest, has married his girlfriend, has three sons and works as a financial consultant.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |title=Stung by Gary Stephen Ross {{!}} Author Q&A |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/157667/stung-by-gary-stephen-ross/ |access-date=October 14, 2022 |website=Penguin Random House}}</ref>\n\nMolony was a manager at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, with access to significant resources.
