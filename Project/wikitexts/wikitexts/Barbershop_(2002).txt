Scott and Marshall Todd, from a story by Brown. The film was produced by George Tillman Jr., Robert Teitel and Brown, and stars [[Ice Cube]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Sean Patrick Thomas]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Troy Garity]], [[Michael Ealy]], [[Leonard Earl Howze]], [[Keith David]] and [[Cedric the Entertainer]]. The film revolves around the social life in a [[barber]]shop on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side of Chicago]]. It is the first installment in the ''[[Barbershop (franchise)|Barbershop series]]''.\n\n''Barbershop'' was released on September 13, 2002 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Distribution Co.]] It received positive reviews from critics, with praise going to the performances of the cast. It went on to become a major commercial success, grossing $77 million worldwide on a $12 million production budget, launching the careers of then-acting newcomers Eve and Ealy.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]'' was released on February 6, 2004, with the original cast returning without director Story, and a third installment, ''[[Barbershop: The Next Cut]]'', was released on April 15, 2016, and was directed by [[Malcolm D. Lee]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn a cold winter day in [[Chicago]], Calvin Palmer Jr. ([[Ice Cube]]) decides he has had enough of trying to keep open the [[barber]]shop his father handed down to him. He cannot borrow, revenues are falling, and he seems more interested in [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s to bring in easy money. Without telling his employees or the customers, he sells the barbershop to a greedy loan shark, Lester Wallace ([[Keith David]]), who secretly plans to turn it into a [[striptease|strip club]].\n\nAfter spending a day at work, and realizing just how vital the barbershop is to the surrounding community, Calvin rethinks his decision and tries to get the shop back - only to find out Wallace wants double the $20,000 he paid Calvin to return it, and before 7 pm that day. Right after he admits to the employees that he sold the barber shop, and that it would be closing at the end of the day, the police arrive to arrest one of the barbers, Ricky ([[Michael Ealy]]).\n\nRicky is accused of driving his pickup truck into a nearby market to steal an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], but it's revealed that his cousin J.D. ([[Anthony Anderson]]) committed the crime after borrowing Ricky's truck. As this would be Ricky's '[[Three strikes law|third strike]]', he could be sentenced to life in prison. Calvin uses the $20,000 from Lester to bail Ricky out of jail, but because J.D. was going to let Ricky take the fall without remorse, Ricky is still angry.\n\nCalvin reveals that he found a gun in Ricky's locker in the barbershop and shows it to him. They stop the car and Ricky throws the gun into the river, proving that he does not want to get into any more trouble. Then they both go to confront Lester, as well as J.D. and Billy (Lahmard Tate), who took the ATM to Lester's place without his knowledge, still trying to pry it open. Calvin and Ricky demand that Lester give the barbershop back.\n\nAngered, Lester orders his bodyguard Monk (Kevin Morrow) to pull out his gun. The police arrive just in time to save Calvin and Ricky and arrest J.D. and Billy. Calvin and Ricky see the ATM, and get a $50,000 reward for returning it to police. They get the money, and the barbershop reopens with even better business than before. In the meantime, Calvin's wife Jennifer ([[Jazsmin Lewis]]) has given birth to a baby boy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Calvin Palmer Jr.\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as J.D.\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Eddie Walker\n* [[Keith David]] as Lester Wallace\n* [[Michael Ealy]] as Ricky Nash\n* [[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as Jimmy James\n* [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] as Terri Jones\n* [[Troy Garity]] as Isaac Rosenberg\n* [[Leonard Earl Howze]] as Dinka\n* [[Jazsmin Lewis]] as Jennifer Palmer\n* Lahmard Tate as Billy\n* [[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Detective Williams\n* [[Sonya Eddy]] as Janelle\n* [[Jason Winston George]] as Kevin\n* [[DeRay Davis]] as Ray Ray\n* [[Parvesh Cheena]] as Samir\n* [[Carl Wright (actor)|Carl Wright]] as Checker Fred\n* [[Kevyn Morrow]] as Monk\n* [[Norm Van Lier]] as Sam\n* [[Jalen Rose]] as Himself\n* [[Lorenzo Clemons]] as Bank Manager\n* [[Deon Cole]] as Darrel\n* [[Eric Lane (actor)|Eric Dane]] as Rodney\n* [[Janina Gavankar]] as Fine Woman\n* Marcia Wright-Tillman as Angry woman who smashes car with bat\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}\nProduced on a $12 million budget,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/columns/helmer-exits-barbershop-sequel-for-hot-date-1117884087/|title = Helmer exits 'Barbershop' sequel for hot 'Date'|date = April 4, 2003}}</ref> ''Barbershop'', with a story by Mark Brown and a screenplay by Brown, Marshall Todd, and Don D. Scott, was filmed in Chicago during the winter of 2001 to early 2002. The filmmakers used a storefront in the [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago community area]] (79th Street and Exchange Avenue) that was once a [[laundromat]] to build the set for Calvin's barbershop, and the set was duplicated on a [[soundstage]]. Similar to what he achieved with his 1997 film ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'', producer [[George Tillman Jr.]] wanted to portray African Americans in a more positive and three-dimensional light than many other [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] films had in the past. This film also features three original songs by [[R&B]] singer/songwriter Sherod Lindsey.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2012}}<!-- needs comments from individual critics, with references -->\nThe film received positive reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a {{RT data|score}} approval rating based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}. [[Metacritic]] gives the film a weighted average score of 66% based on reviews from 29 critics.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/barbershop |title= Barbershop |work= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\nAudiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade \"A\u2212\" on scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20 |access-date= 2019-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Sequels, spin-off and television series==\n{{Anchor|Sequels}}\nIn 2004, MGM released the [[sequel]], ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]''. All of the original cast returned, but director [[Tim Story]] did not. This film was directed by [[Kevin Rodney Sullivan]]. In the same year, [[Billie Woodruff]] directed a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film entitled ''[[Beauty Shop]]'', with [[Queen Latifah]] as the lead (Latifah's character made her debut in ''Barbershop 2''). ''Beauty Shop'' was pushed back from a late summer 2004 release, and finally reached theaters in March 2005.\n\nDuring the fall of 2005, State Street and Ice Cube debuted ''[[Barbershop: The Series]]'' on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] [[cable television|cable]] [[television network|network]], with [[Omar Gooding]] taking over [[Ice Cube]]'s role of Calvin. The character \"Dinka\" is renamed \"Yinka\" on ''Barbershop: The Series'', as \"Dinka\" is not a typical Nigerian name (although a certain tribe in the Nigerian middle belt bears the name \"Dimka\"). In addition, Isaac's last name is changed from \"Rosenberg\" to \"Brice\", and the character Ricky has been replaced by a more hardened ex-con, Romadal.\n\nIn 2014, a third ''Barbershop'' film was announced, titled ''[[Barbershop: The Next Cut]]''. In late March of that year, MGM executives revealed that they have been negotiating deals with Ice Cube to appear in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/03/mgm-re-opens-barbershop-for-business-with-ice-cube-deal/|title='Barbershop' Sequel In Works With Ice Cube At MGM - Deadline|author=Mike Fleming Jr|work=Deadline|date=March 26, 2014}}</ref> A year later, MGM announced that the studio has been setting up deals with Cedric the Entertainer, Queen Latifah, [[Lisa Maffia]], and [[Nicki Minaj]] to appear in the film.
