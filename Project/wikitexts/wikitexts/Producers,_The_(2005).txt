The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Nathan Lane]], [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Gary Beach]], [[Roger Bart]], and [[Jon Lovitz]]. Creature effects were provided by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]] in a [[limited release]] on December 16, 2005, followed by a [[wide release]] on December 25. It garnered generally mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|commercial failure]], earning $38 million worldwide from a $45 million budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo.com\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1959, following the flop of the theatrical musical ''Funny Boy'' (based on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'') (\"Opening Night\"), the show's washed-up producer, [[Max Bialystock]], hires the neurotic [[Leo Bloom]] as his accountant. While studying Max's books, Leo notes that as a flop is expected to lose money, the [[IRS]] will not investigate the finances of failed productions. Leo jests that by selling an excess of shares and [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] the funds, a flop could generate up to $2 million. Max asks for Leo's help with the scheme, only for the latter to refuse (\"We Can Do It\").\n\nReturning to his old accounting firm, Leo starts fantasizing about being a Broadway producer (\"I Wanna Be a Producer\"). Leo quits his job and forms \"Bialystock & Bloom\" with Max. Searching for the worst play ever written, the duo finds ''[[Springtime for Hitler]]'', a musical written by an ex-[[Nazi]] named [[Franz Liebkind]]. Max and Leo, in order to acquire Franz's rights to the musical, perform Hitler's favorite song and swear the sacred \"[[Hitler Oath|Siegfried Oath]]\" to him (\"Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop\").\n\nIn order to ensure the play's failure, Max and Leo meet failing, [[Flamboyancy|flamboyant]] director [[Roger De Bris]] and his assistant [[Carmen Ghia]]. Roger is reluctant to direct, but when Max and Leo suggest he could win a [[Tony Award]], he agrees on the condition that the play be more \"[[Camp (style)|gay]]\" (\"Keep It Gay\"). Back at their office, a Swedish woman named [[Ulla (The Producers)|Ulla]] appears to audition. Although Leo points out that they have not started casting, Max hires her as their secretary until they audition her later (\"When You've Got It, Flaunt It\").\n\nTo gain backers to fund the musical, Max has dalliances with several elderly women (\"Along Came Bialy\"), allowing him to raise the $2 million. Leo laments about the dangers of sex distracting him from his work, and shares a kiss with Ulla (\"That Face\"). At auditions for the role of Hitler, Franz, angered at a performer's rendition of a German song, storms the stage and performs it himself (\"Haben Sie geh\u00f6rt das Deutsche Band?\"). Based on the performance, Max hires Franz to play Hitler.\n\nOn opening night, as the cast and crew prepare to go on stage, Leo wishes everyone good luck, to which everyone warns it is [[Theatrical superstitions#\"Break a leg\" vs. \"Good luck\"|bad luck]] to say \"good luck\" on opening night, and that the correct phrase is to say \"break a leg\" (\"You Never Say Good Luck on Opening Night\"). Franz leaves to prepare and literally breaks his leg in a fall. Max enlists Roger to perform the role in his place, and Roger accepts.\n\nAs the show opens, the audience is horrified at the first song (\"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]]\"), and people begin leaving out of disgust until Roger enters as Hitler (\"Heil Myself\"). Roger, playing Hitler very flamboyantly, causes the audience to misinterpret the play as [[satire]], resulting in the show becoming a smash. Terrified the IRS will learn of their crimes, a dispute breaks out between Max and Leo, but stops when Roger and Carmen come into the office to congratulate them. Furious at Roger for making the play successful, Max angrily confronts Roger for his actions, and even goes as far to physically torture Carmen when he tries to defend Roger. Franz then appears and attempts to shoot all four of them for breaking the Siegfried Oath by mocking Hitler, only to attract the police. As Max and Franz attempt to evade the police, Franz breaks his other leg.\n\nArrested for his tax fraud, Max is imprisoned while Leo elopes with Ulla to [[Rio de Janeiro]] (\"Betrayed\"). About to be sentenced, Max is saved by Leo, who returns to defend him (\"{{'}}Til Him\"). The judge, realizing Max and Leo are inseparable, sentences them both to five years at [[Sing Sing|Sing Sing Prison]] with Franz. Writing and producing a new musical in prison (\"Prisoners of Love\"), Leo, Max, and Franz are pardoned by the governor for their work, allowing them to collaborate with Roger and Ulla and release ''Prisoners of Love''. The play's success means Max and Leo go on to become successful Broadway producers.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the cast sings \"Goodbye!\", telling the audience to leave the theater.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as [[Max Bialystock]]\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as [[Leo Bloom|Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom]]\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as [[Ulla (The Producers)|Ulla Inga Hansen Benson Yansen Tallen Hallen Svaden Swanson (later Bloom)]] \n* [[Will Ferrell]] as [[Franz Liebkind]]\n* [[Gary Beach]] as [[Roger De Bris]]\n* [[Roger Bart]] as [[Carmen Ghia]]\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Mr. Marks\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Prison Trustee\n* [[David Huddleston]] as Judge\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Jury Foreman\n* [[Eileen Essell]] as Hold Me-Touch Me\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Lick Me-Bite Me\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Kiss Me-Feel Me\n* [[John Barrowman]] as the Lead Tenor Stormtrooper\n* [[Brent Barrett]] as Brian\n* [[Peter Bartlett (actor)|Peter Bartlett]] as Kevin\n* Jim Borstelmann as Scott, Donald Dinsmore\n* Kathy Fitzgerald as Shirley Markowitz\n* Roland Rusinek as Jack Lepidus and soundtrack vocalist\n* [[Jason Antoon]] as Jason Green\n* Bryn Dowling and Meg Gillentine as Usherettes \n* [[Marilyn Sokol]] as Bag Lady\n* [[Danny Mastrogiorgio]] as Jail Guard\n* [[Mel Brooks]] as himself, voices of Tom the Cat, Hilda the Pigeon and German Soldier\n\n===Puppeteers (Franz Liebkind segment)===\n* [[Fran Brill]] \u2013 Pigeon\n* [[Tyler Bunch]] \u2013 Pigeon\n* [[James Kroupa]] \u2013 Pigeon\n* [[Tim Lagasse]] \u2013 Pigeon\n* [[Peter Linz]] \u2013 Pigeon\n* [[Drew Massey]] \u2013 Pigeon\n* [[Joey Mazzarino]] \u2013 Pigeon\n* [[Martin P.

The film\u2019s failure was partly due to its competition with ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', and ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]''.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Despite the rich source material, ''The Producers'' has a stale, stagy feel more suited to the theater than the big screen.\" On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=The Producers |work=[[CinemaScore]]|access-date=June 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA positive review from Betty Jo Tucker of [[Reel Talk]] said: \"Outrageous musical numbers evoke most of the laughs in this movie funfest. Eat your heart out, Rockettes, because here comes a little old ladies' chorus line ('Along Came Bialy') to rival your success. Watch out, real-life producers, for an actor named Gary Beach ('Heil Myself'). Never, and I mean never, hire him if you want your play to flop! And stop spinning in your grave, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]. Those '[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler and Germany]]' showgirls are all in good fun. Finally, congratulations to director Susan Stroman, for making this Broadway gem into a film that old-time movie musical fans like me can cheer about.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reeltalkreviews.com/browse/viewitem.asp?type=review&id=1515|title=ReelTalk Movie Reviews|first=Mark Lubischer and Betty Jo|last=Tucker}}</ref>\n\nNathan Rabin wrote: \"Between the rough start and an ending that lingers too long, there's a solid hour or so of terrific entertainment that serves as both a giddy tribute to Broadway musicals and a parody thereof. Thirty-seven years after Brooks declared war on taste and propriety, ''The Producers'' has lost its power to shock or offend, but it's retained its ability to amuse.\"<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/43532 The Producers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203033155/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/43532 |date=February 3, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] cited difficulty in reviewing the film due to familiarity with the original 1967 film. However, he did state that the new version was \"fun\" and gave it three out of four stars. Said Ebert: \"The new movie is a success, that I know. How much of a success, I cannot be sure.\"<ref name=ebertreview>{{cite news | last = Ebert  | first = Roger  | title = ''The Producers'' review  | publisher = RogerEbert.com | date = 2005-12-16 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051215/REVIEWS/51213003/1023 | access-date = 2007-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these positive reviews, it was nominated for four [[Golden Globe]]s (including nominations for actors Ferrell and Lane).\n\nMost negative reviews suggested that the performances were tuned more for the theater rather than for film. [[Stephanie Zacharek]] observed: \"''The Producers'' is essentially a filmed version of a stage play, in which none of the characters' expressions or line readings have been scaled down to make sense on-screen. Every gesture is played out as if the actors were 20 feet away in real life, which means that, by the time the performers are magnified on the big screen, they're practically sitting in your lap. The effect is something like watching a [[3D film|3-D]] [[IMAX]] film without the special glasses.\"<ref name=\"Zacharek\">Zacharek, Stephanie,[http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2005/12/16/producers/index.html \"The Producers\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719202230/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2005/12/16/producers/index.html |date=July 19, 2006 }}, ''Salon'', retrieved January 26, 2007</ref>\n\nIn addition to these negative reviews, it was nominated for five [[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]] (Worst Director, Worst Remake, Worst Actor for Broderick, Least Dynamic Duo for Broderick and Lane, and Worst Song for \"Keep It Gay\") along with winning a special \"Annie Award\", which criticised the decision to sell tickets for the film for an additional $2.50; the name reflects a decision similarly used by the film ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]''.\n\n==''Jimmy Kimmel Live'' sketch==\nOn February 28, 2016, a five-minute  [[short film]] serving as a [[sequel]] to ''The Producers'', entitled '''''Trumped''''', was released on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprising their roles as Max Bialystock and Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom. The film follows Bialystock & Bloom having formed their own Political Consultants business, which has since fallen on hard times. Bloom realises that under the right circumstances more money can be made from a losing candidate than from a winner. They choose [[Donald Trump]] as a candidate, only for him to become a political phenomenon.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OemqVWi_R0k/ \u201c''Trumped''\" Starring Matthew Broderick & Nathan Lane]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*{{Section link|Second weekend in box office performance|Second-weekend increase}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0395251|The Producers}}\n* {{mojo title|producers|The Producers}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|producers_the_movie_musical|The Producers}}\n\n{{The Producers}}\n{{Mel Brooks}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Producers 2005 Film}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2005 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2005 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2005 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:2000s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s satirical films]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Adolf Hitler]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:Films about entertainers]]\n[[Category:Films about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:Films about musical theatre]]\n[[Category:Films about fraud]]\n[[Category:Films based on musicals]]\n[[Category:Films based on musicals based on films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1959]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Mel Brooks]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Thomas Meehan (writer)]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by Mel Brooks]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Mel Brooks]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Brooksfilms films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
