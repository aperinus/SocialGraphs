The film stars [[Eva Green]], [[Asa Butterfield]], [[Chris O'Dowd]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Terence Stamp]], [[Ella Purnell]], [[Judi Dench]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]].\n\nFilming began in February 2015 in [[London]] and the [[Tampa Bay Area]]. The film premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] in [[Austin, Texas]], on September 25, 2016, and was theatrically released in the [[United States]] on September 30, 2016, by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"DecReleaseDate\" /> It received mixed reviews, with praise for Burton's direction and visual atmosphere, but criticism for its plot, and grossed $296 million worldwide against a production budget of $110 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- KEEP THIS SECTION TO 700 WORDS, OR FEWER. -->\nAbe Portman has told stories to his grandson Jake about battling monsters and spending his childhood at \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" at Cairnholm, an island off the coast of [[Wales]]. The home's children and headmistress, Miss Alma Peregrine, possess paranormal abilities and are known as \"Peculiars\". One day, Jake finds Abe dying with his eyes removed, and he tells Jake to go to \"the loop of September 3, 1943\".\n\nFollowing advice from Dr. Golan, Jake travels to the United Kingdom to go to Cairnholm with his father Frank to investigate the children\u2019s home, learning that it was destroyed during a [[Luftwaffe]] raid. Upon entering the ruins, he finds the children from Abe's stories. They take him through a portal and he emerges in the year 1943 with the house still intact. Miss Peregrine explains that she belongs to a class of female Peculiars named \"Ymbrynes\", who can transform into birds (in Miss Peregrine's case, a [[peregrine falcon]]) and manipulate time. To avoid persecution for being Peculiars, she and her children hide from the outside world in a [[time loop]] she created, accessible only to Peculiars and set to September 3, 1943, allowing them to live the same day repeatedly and avoid aging as long as they stay inside it.\n\nJake is introduced to the rest of the children, including aerokinetic Emma Bloom, whom he likes. Jake learns he is also a Peculiar like his grandfather, and can see the invisible monsters from his stories, called \"Hollowgasts\" (or \"Hollows\"). They are disfigured Peculiar scientists who killed a Ymbryne in a failed experiment to harvest her powers trying to achieve immortality. Led by [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] Mr. Barron, they hunt Peculiars to consume their eyeballs, which allow them to regain visibly human form, but with milky-white eyes, named \"Wights\".\n\nA wounded Ymbryne named Miss Avocet arrives, explaining Barron assaulted her in the January 2016 time loop at [[Blackpool]], [[England]], killing her children and is trying to repeat the failed experiment using more Ymbrynes. Jake returns to 2016, but finding an elderly man killed by a Hollow, goes back to the portal to warn them the Hollow is near. He is followed by an ornithologist who is actually Mr. Barron.\n\nBarron had tried to extract the location of Ms. Peregrine's loop from Abe, but his hungry Hollow companion, Mr. Malthus killed Abe before he could do so. He then posed as Dr. Golan, encouraging Jake to go to the island so Jake could lead him to the loop. Using Jake as a hostage, Barron forces Miss Peregrine to trap herself in bird form and takes her to Blackpool, leaving Jake, the other children, and Miss Avocet as prey for Malthus.\n\nMalthus kills Miss Avocet, but Jake and the children escape just as the Luftwaffe raid destroys the house, killing Malthus. Without Miss Peregrine to reset it, the loop closes, leaving them stuck in 1943. Salvaging a sunken ocean liner ''RMS Augusta'', they travel to Blackpool and enter its January 2016 loop, fight Barron's Wight and Hollow allies, and rescue Miss Peregrine and other captive Ymbrynes. When the last remaining Hollow arrives, Jake is able to see and avoid it. The Hollow kills Barron and is in turn killed by Jake.\n\nJake says goodbye to the children as they return to 1943 while he stays in 2016 and relates his adventures to Abe, who is alive and well: Barron's death in the beginning of 2016 erased his presence in Florida later on. Abe gives Jake a map of international time loops, allowing Jake to reunite with his friends in 1943. The children and Miss Peregrine journey to seek a happy time loop.\n\n==Cast==\n===Peculiars===\n====Peculiar adults==== \n* [[Eva Green]] as Miss Alma LeFay Peregrine, the strict but clever and caring Ymbryne headmistress of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children who can transform into a peregrine falcon and manipulate time<ref name=\"GreenCast\" />\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as Abe Portman, Jake's grandfather who can see the invisible Hollows\n** Callum Wilson as young Abe<ref name=\"ComingSoon\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0504184/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t35 |title=Abraham Portman (Character) |work=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=March 5, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Judi Dench]] as Miss Esmeralda Avocet, the Ymbryne headmistress of another shelter for Peculiar Children in Blackpool.
