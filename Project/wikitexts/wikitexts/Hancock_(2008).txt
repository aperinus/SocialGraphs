The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Charlize Theron]], and [[Jason Bateman]].\n\nThe story was originally written by Vy Vincent Ngo in 1996. It languished in [[development hell]] for years with various directors attached, including [[Tony Scott]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], [[Jonathan Mostow]], and [[Gabriele Muccino]], before being filmed in 2007 in Los Angeles with a production budget of $150 million.\n\nIn the United States, the film was rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after changes were made at their request in order to avoid an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R]] rating, which it had received twice before. The film was released on July 2, 2008, in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]]. ''Hancock'' received mixed reviews from critics who praised its performances, visual effects and premise, but criticized its execution and failure to deliver on its potential, especially during its second half. It grossed $629 million worldwide, becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\nJohn Hancock is an alcoholic, reckless [[superhuman]] imbued with flight, invulnerability, and super-strength. Acting as a haphazard [[superhero]] in [[Los Angeles]], he is often ridiculed and hated by the public for his drunken and careless acts, and becomes enraged when called an \"asshole\". Hancock rescues Ray Embrey, a [[public relations]] specialist, from an oncoming train, which he irrationally derails to save Ray. Thankful and seeing him as a career opportunity, Ray offers to help improve Hancock's public image. Hancock meets Ray's family, his son Aaron, who is a fan, and his wife Mary, who is suspicious of Hancock.\n\nRay encourages Hancock to issue a public apology, and then go to [[prison]] for a time, until Los Angeles needs him properly. Hancock reluctantly agrees, struggling to fit in at prison, and quickly causes trouble when he assaults two fellow inmates that resent the fact he put them in prison. Hancock is visited by Ray, encouraging him to be patient but when he hears he might be in for 8 years he starts to break out. Ray persuades him to stay inside and stick to the plan. Hancock is later visited by Mary and Aaron who bring him homemade spaghetti with meatballs. \n\nThe Los Angeles' crime rate rises and Hancock is eventually released to help. He foils a [[bank robbery]] orchestrated by Red Parker, with Hancock slicing off his hand to prevent him from activating a [[Dead man's switch|dead man's switch.]] He is praised as a hero and becomes popular.\n\nHancock has dinner with Ray and Mary, and reveals that he is [[amnesia]]c and an immortal, having woken up in a hospital 80 years ago with no memory of his identity. He had awakened in a hospital with doctors telling him that he was stopping a mugging and was clubbed in the head. Ray tells Hancock that Mary is Aaron's stepmother and that his biological mother had died in childbirth. Carrying a drunk Ray home, Hancock kisses Mary, who kisses him back but then throws him through the wall, revealing that she has superpowers, too. \n\nThe next day, Hancock and Mary speak in private. Mary claims in the past there were more like them - sometimes called angels or gods by other - but no longer. They have lived for three thousand years and are soulmates. The other angels/gods paired up, lived human lives and then died. Hancock flies away to inform Ray of Mary's kissing him, only for Mary to chase him and incite a violent battle across the city. Ray witnesses the fight, later confronting the duo. Mary admits Hancock is actually her husband from the past, but that she chose to quietly leave him once he had lost his memories. \n\nAfter stopping a store robbery, Hancock finds that a bullet has hurt him and he needs hospital treatment. Mary tells him that the closer they are, the more mortal they become. They will lose their powers unless they stay apart. The last time Hancock and Mary were together was eighty years ago when Hancock was attacked.\n\nParker, who escaped prison with several other criminals, attacks the hospital to get revenge. Mary is caught in the crossfire and injured. Hancock recovers, killing the criminals, but is further injured, when Parker shoots him. He is saved by Ray, who cuts off Parker's other hand with a [[fire axe]] before killing him as well. Hancock throws himself out of the hospital, trying to increase his distance from Mary so that she can recover, before flying off towards the [[Moon]].\n\nA month later, Ray and his family receive a call from Hancock (who is now in [[New York City]]), revealing that he has imprinted the Moon's surface with Ray's AllHeart marketing logo. In a mid-credits scene, Hancock confronts a criminal holding a woman at gunpoint and demands that he help him escape from the police, while calling him an asshole in the process, much to Hancock's amusement.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as John Hancock, an alcoholic superhero.<ref name=\"retitled\"/> Hancock is invulnerable, immortal, possesses [[superhuman strength]], reflexes and stamina, highly developed regeneration, and can fly at supersonic speeds.<ref name=\"preview\">{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Linder |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/879/879467p1.html |title=Preview: Hancock |work=[[IGN]] |date=June 5, 2008 |access-date=June 24, 2008}}</ref> He is also an [[amnesia]]c; his first memories are of waking up alone in a hospital in 1931. During his release, the duty nurse asked him for his \"[[Signature|John Hancock]]\", which he adopted as his current alias. Smith described the character, \"Hancock is not your average superhero.

According to the director, \"Once the fight starts, you're very limited and you're at the mercy of your effects guys ... unless they're really technically oriented ... it's definitely the time we have the least amount of control as directors.\" He and other filmmakers worked to cut down on the fight scene, believing that the film's success would come from the character study of Smith's character, John Hancock, similar to [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]'s acclaimed portrayal of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] in the previous May's superhero release, ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''.<ref name=\"boozy\"/>\n\nVisual effects supervisor [[Carey Villegas]] described Peter Berg's photography as \"very high energy\", to which the visual effects crew had difficulty adapting. Though the crew had estimated developing 300 visual effects shot at its initial bid, the final tally was approximately 525 shots. An unexpected shot was a scene in which Hancock shoves a prisoner's head up another's anus, and filmmakers initially attempted to film it conventionally, using [[sleight of hand]] techniques with cameras. Finding that doing so did not capture \"the vulgarity of the gag\", the crew was enlisted to use computer-generated effects. Visual effects were also applied in conjunction with the film's choreography, incorporating palm trees, twisters, and debris in the computer-generated fight scene and combining visual effects with a crane shot to portray Hancock's derailment of a [[Freight rail transport|freight train]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Tara |last=Bennett |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/production/ihancocki-cuff-vfx |title=''Hancock'': Off-the-Cuff VFX |publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=July 7, 2008 |access-date=April 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Hancock'' had its world premiere as the opener at the 30th [[Moscow International Film Festival]] on June 19, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|first=Amie |last=Ferris-Rotman |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2063506920080620|title=Smith and Theron descend on Moscow to promote film |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=June 20, 2008 |access-date=April 26, 2010}}</ref> To avoid copyright infringement, organizers took \"unprecedented\" steps to prevent illegal reproduction of the film.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Vladimir |last=Kozlov |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/awards_festivals/news/e3i36ba53a2d13a6bd75c11ba21656ab04b |title=Moscow film fest to open with ''Hancock'' |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 5, 2008 |access-date=June 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620010808/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/awards_festivals/news/e3i36ba53a2d13a6bd75c11ba21656ab04b |archive-date=June 20, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFor the film, Sony created a [[Digital Cinema Package|digital cinema package]] (DCP) having 4K resolution, containing four times more information than the typical DCP that possessed 2K resolution.

There was no way to do that and then regain even a modicum of emotional integrity.\" The director kept the scene with the prisoners since a Las Vegas test screening was overwhelmingly successful: \"At the end of the day, I couldn't ignore an audience when they're laughing that hard.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Glenn |last=Whipp |title=Will power: The wait is over!
