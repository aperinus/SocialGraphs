It was filmed near [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. It had a limited theatrical release on October 31, 2008. [[HDNet Movies]] aired the film two days prior to its theatrical release.<ref>[http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/10/23/hdnet-movies-debuting-splinter-to-get-you-in-the-halloween-spiri/ HDNet / Splinter]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAt a sleepy gas station, the pump attendant is attacked by a splinter-infected animal. The attendant's body contorts. A young couple, Seth Belzer and Polly Watt, drive for a romantic camping trip in the forests of [[Oklahoma]], but their plans are shattered when they are car-jacked by an escaped convict, Dennis Farell, and his drug-addict girlfriend, Lacey Belisle. The group gets a flat tire when they run over a splinter-infected animal on the road. They find shelter at the now-abandoned gas station.\n\nLacey discovers the horribly-infected pump attendant, writhing in the bathroom. She is attacked and is killed by the monster, but her corpse slowly reanimates and becomes a new creature, which attacks the remaining survivors. While fighting her, Seth, Polly and Dennis discover that severed pieces of the infected victims are capable of attacking on their own. Sheriff Terri Frankel arrives and attempts to arrest Dennis, but is ripped in half by Lacey's corpse. The creature takes the top half of the officer's body and bonds with it, becoming a larger creature. The trio hide in the walk-in refrigerator when a piece of the creature's arm attacks them. It is discovered that Dennis has been infected, as his left arm violently twists on its own. Seth and Polly amputate his arm to prevent the infection from spreading. Dennis explains that he had been pricked by a splinter from the dead creature they encountered on the road. Seth discovers that the creatures themselves are a [[fungus]] taking control of the corpses they infect and consuming the blood in the body, using the currently zombified host to seek out fresh and new hosts. Because of this, they hunt based on temperature and attack the warmest thing they can find.\n\nBy lowering his body temperature with bags of ice, Seth sneaks past the creature to the police car, while Polly and Farell distract it with fireworks. Seth discovers that, without the keys, the car and the police radio inside are useless. His body temperature rises again, forcing Dennis to leave the gas station to lure the creature away from him. The creature enters the gas station, and Dennis and Polly hide in the freezer. The discarded fireworks ignite the trail of flammable liquid, and the gas station catches on fire. Seth retrieves a shotgun from the police car and helps Polly and Dennis escape. Dennis is infected after helping to keep the creature at bay while Seth and Polly escape. He shoots one of the gas pumps with the shotgun, and the creature is engulfed in flames, killing it. Dennis, still infected, gives Seth and Polly a key to a bank account, telling them to give it to the wife of a man he shot, who later died. Dennis shoots directly into the propane tanks, incinerating himself, the station, and any remaining infected corpses. Seth and Polly wander into the distance as other infected creature corpses lie dormant in the woods.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jill Wagner]] as Polly Watt\n* [[Paulo Costanzo]] as Seth Belzer\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Dennis Farell\n* Rachel Kerbs as Lacey Belisle\n* Laurel Whitsett as Sheriff Terri Frankell\n* [[Charles Baker (actor)|Charles Baker]] as Blake Sherman Jr.\n\n== Production ==\nWilkins said the original script was a \"classic siege movie\" that interested him.  The monster in this script was more generic, but he realized that an idea he and a friend had been developing about a parasitic creature would fit in well.<ref name=screeen>{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/interview-splinter-and-grudge-3-director-toby-wilkins/4042153.article|title=Interview: Splinter and Grudge 3 director Toby Wilkins|last=Mitchell|first=Wendy|work=[[Screen Daily]]|date=27 November 2008|accessdate=16 March 2022}}</ref>  Wilkins found the concept of a creature that takes over its host to be scarier than one that simply kills it.  Like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', he wanted his characters to briefly fight against the infection before losing their personality.  Wilkins also wanted to introduced horror from the creature's ignorance of how human bodies work and its resulting abuse of the host's skeleton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/8837/wilkins-toby-splinter/|title=Wilkins, Toby (Splinter)|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[Dread Central]]|accessdate=16 March 2022}}</ref>  To choreograph the jerky movements by the infected people, Wilkins used multiple performers, including a gymnast, mime, and stuntperson.
