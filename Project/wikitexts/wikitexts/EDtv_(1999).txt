An adaptation of the [[List of Quebec films|Quebecois film]] ''[[Louis 19, King of the Airwaves]] (Louis 19, le roi des ondes)'' (1994),<ref>\"EDtv a fun, fluffy Truman Show\". ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', March 26, 1999.</ref> it stars [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Jenna Elfman]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Martin Landau]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[Sally Kirkland]], [[Elizabeth Hurley]], [[Clint Howard]], and [[Dennis Hopper]].\n\nThe movie received mixed reviews, with some criticizing its similarity to ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998), and was a [[box office flop]], grossing only a little over $35 million compared to its $80 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nTelevision network True TV is commencing interviews for a planned reality show that shows a normal person's life [[24/7]], created by TV producer Cynthia. They interview Ed Pekurny and his brother, Ray. When the producers see the interview, Cynthia chooses Ed. The show hits the airwaves under the title \"Ed TV.\" It is a total failure at first, as only boring things happen. The producers want to pull the plug, but Cynthia remains determined that the show will succeed.\n\nEd TV gets interesting when Ed visits Ray. Ed (along with the cameramen) discovers that Ray is cheating on his girlfriend Shari. Ed visits Shari to apologize to her for Ray's actions, but a drunk Shari starts insulting Ray, calling him \"a bad lay\", to the audience's amusement. Ed tries to comfort Shari, revealing he has feelings for her; she reveals she has feelings for him too, and they kiss, making Ed TV extremely popular. At Cynthia's insistence, Ed starts a relationship with Shari, but their relationship is short-lived, as Ed grows more interested in staying on TV and Shari is abused by viewers who find her unappealing.\n\nEd goes on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and meets beautiful model and actress Jill who takes a liking to Ed. Ed visits Shari, who tells him she does not want to be with him until Ed TV stops airing. She then leaves town. Ed goes to a park to play football with Ray when Jill arrives to invite Ed over for dinner at her house, as Cynthia brought her in to earn more ratings. When Ed arrives at Jill's house, there is a massive crowd. The two have a small talk, and kiss on top of a table. They are about to have sex, but Ed falls off the table and lands on her cat, which results in a sore back for the former and a broken leg for the latter. Ed never sees Jill again, and he also finds out his brother wrote a book (called ''My Brother Pissed on Me'').\n\nEd's father Hank, who abandoned his family when Ed was thirteen, unexpectedly visits Ed and informs him that he left because Ed's mother was having an affair with Ed's current stepfather, Al . Ed is furious with his mother Jeanette, who had previously claimed that she'd only met Al after Hank left, and argues with her. Ed then gets a phone call telling him to come to the hospital, where he is told his father died making love to his wife. Ed assumes the father in question is Al, but it is actually Hank, who was having an affair with Jeanette.\n\nAfter Hank's funeral, Ed becomes disheartened by how the producers want him to stay on longer and that he cannot do anything to change their minds or he would be in breach of his contract. Ed is depressed until he notices a disguised Shari. He chases her to a women's bathroom in a movie theater, where she explains that she is staying with her brother for his birthday and that she just wanted to see Ed. Ed vows to find a way to end the show to be with Shari. When Ed exits, one cameraman stays with Shari, explaining that it is the producers' new idea: Ed's entire family is being filmed, but they will focus on the most interesting person, eliminating his family's right to privacy for as long as the show will air.\n\nEd gets an idea on how to stop the main producer from airing the show: he will give $10,000 to the person who can give him the best amount of  \"dirt\" on the producers and that he will announce it live, with the desired result being that they stop airing the show before he can make the announcement. As Cynthia feels sorry for Ed, she tells him a secret of the main producer. Ed announces the secret (that the man has to pump a liquid into his penis to get an erection), but before he can announce who it is, the show is taken off the air.\n\nAfter the camera crew finally leaves Ed's apartment, he and Shari renew their relationship and celebrate as TV news panelists predict Ed will be forgotten in a short period of time.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Edward \"Ed\" Pekurny\n* [[Jenna Elfman]] as Shari\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Raymond \"Ray\" Pekurny\n* [[Ellen DeGeneres]] as Cynthia Reed\n* [[Martin Landau]] as Al\n* [[Sally Kirkland]] as Jeanette Pekurny\n* [[Elizabeth Hurley]] as Jill\n* [[Rob Reiner]] as Mr. Whitaker\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Henry 'Hank' Pekurny\n* [[Viveka Davis]] as Marcia Pekurny\n* [[Christian Kane]] as P.A.\n* [[Adam Goldberg (actor)|Adam Goldberg]] as John\n* Wendle Josepher as Rita\n* [[Merrin Dungey]] as Ms. Seaver\n* [[Ian Gomez]] as McIlvaine\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Ken\n* [[RuPaul]] as Himself\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Barry\n* [[Gedde Watanabe]] as Greg\n* [[Alexandra Holden]] as College girl\n* [[Don Most]] as Benson\n* [[Geoffrey Blake (actor)|Geoffrey Blake]] as Keith\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Moderator (Shearer also featured as a talk show host in ''[[The Truman Show]]'').\n* [[Michael Moore]], [[Merrill Markoe]], and [[George Plimpton]] as Panel members\n* [[Bill Maher]] as Himself\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Himself\n* [[Arianna Huffington]] as Herself\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was screened out of competition at the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5326/year/1999.html |title=Festival de Cannes: EDtv |access-date=2009-10-11|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $35.2 million against a production budget of $80 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | title=EDtv (1999) |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=edtv.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=15 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 64%, based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10.
