The film received generally positive reviews from critics and, at the [[75th Academy Awards]], it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]].\n\nA [[sleeper hit]], the film became the highest-grossing romantic comedy domestically of all time, and grossed $241.4 million in North America, despite never reaching number one at the box office during its release. It was the highest-grossing film with that distinction for 14 years until the animated film ''[[Sing (2016 American film)|Sing]]'' grossed $268 million in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/never1.htm |title=Top Grossing Movies that never hit #1|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nThe film spawned [[My Big Fat Greek Wedding (franchise)|a franchise]], which inspired the short-lived 2003 [[CBS]] TV series ''[[My Big Fat Greek Life]]'' and a film [[sequel]] titled ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2]]'', which was released on March 25, 2016 by [[Universal Pictures]].

Frumpy and meek, she works in her family's [[Chicago]] restaurant, \"Dancing Zorba's\", but longs to do something more with her life. While working one day, she is immediately smitten with Ian Miller, a handsome school teacher. She amuses Ian when he catches her staring at him and jokingly calls herself his \"own private Greek statue\". That evening, Toula offers to go to college to learn about computers so she can improve the restaurant, but her father, Gus, becomes emotional, claiming Toula wants to leave him. Her mother, Maria, comforts Toula and convinces Gus to agree to Toula's idea.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Toula gains more confidence and changes her image, switching her thick-framed glasses for contact lenses, styling her hair, and wearing makeup and brighter clothes that show off her figure. She sees a notice for a course on computers and tourism and tells her Aunt Voula, who owns a travel agency, that she could apply what she learns in the course to Voula's business. Voula agrees, and she and Maria slyly convince Gus to agree as well.\n\nToula's happiness working at the travel agency catches Ian's attention and he asks her to dinner. Knowing her family would not approve of her dating a non-Greek, Toula lies that she is taking a pottery class in order to see Ian.  Ian eventually realizes Toula is the waitress from Dancing Zorba's; contrary to Toula's fear that he would lose interest in her, Ian reaffirms his fondness of her. They continue dating and fall in love.\n\nToula's lie is ultimately exposed. Gus is furious that Ian did not ask his permission to date Toula, despite the fact that they are grown adults. Gus refuses to let them continue seeing each other, but they ignore his decree, so Gus introduces Toula to single friends of his own, to no avail.\n\nIan proposes marriage and Toula accepts.  Maria tells Gus that he must accept their marriage, but Gus remains upset because Ian is not a member of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. To get the family to accept him, Ian agrees to be baptized into the church. The Portokalos family does finally accept him, but constantly inserts themselves into the wedding planning, designing ugly bridesmaid's dresses and misspelling Ian's mother's name on their wedding invitations.\n\nIan's quiet, conservative parents meet the entire family during a loud and extravagant Greek family dinner and are overwhelmed by the experience, frustrating Gus. Toula worries about whether her father has really accepted Ian. Maria explains that, growing up, her family experienced many hardships, and that she and Gus simply want her to be happy. Toula's grandmother shows Toula photos of herself as a young woman and the crown she wore at her own wedding, which Toula puts on. When the three women all look at Toula in her bedroom mirror, the sight of three generations in the reflection makes Toula smile with pride. The wedding proceeds as planned.\n\nAt the wedding reception, Gus gives a heartfelt speech focusing on how the differences in the newlyweds' backgrounds do not matter. He and Maria then surprise Toula and Ian with a house as a wedding gift; Toula is speechless at the gesture of love from her father. As the two families dance together, Toula narrates that while her family is indeed loud, odd, and somewhat dramatic, she knows they love her and will always be there for her.\n\nSix years later, Toula and Ian leave their house\u2014conveniently located right next door to Gus and Maria's\u2014to walk their daughter to Greek school.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nia Vardalos]] as Fotoula \"Toula\" Portokalos\n* [[John Corbett]] as Ian Miller\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Maria Portokalos, Toula's mother<ref>{{cite news|title=Lainie Kazan's 'Big Fat' Jewish Life|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=10364|newspaper=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|access-date=June 10, 2022|first=Naomi|last=Pfefferman|date=April 11, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122408/http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=10364|archive-date=September 29, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Michael Constantine]] as Costas \"Gus\" Portokalos, Toula's father<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D03E7D9153FF93AA25757C0A9649C8B63|title=FILM IN REVIEW; 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=April 19, 2002|access-date=June 13, 2022}}</ref>\n* [[Andrea Martin]] as Aunt Voula\n* [[Louis Mandylor]] as Nikos \"Nick\" Portokalos, Toula's brother\n* [[Gia Carides]] as Cousin Nikki\n* [[Gerry Mendicino]] as Uncle Taki\n* [[Joey Fatone]] as Cousin Angelo\n* Bess Meisler as Yiayia (Grandma)\n* Stavroula Logothettis as Athena Portokalos, Toula's sister\n* [[Ian Gomez]] as Mike, Ian's best friend; he was Vardalos's real-life husband at the time of filming\n* [[Bruce Gray]] as Rodney Miller, Ian's father\n* [[Fiona Reid]] as Harriet Miller, Ian's mother\n* [[Jayne Eastwood]] as Mrs. White, a non-Greek neighbor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'' started as a one-woman play written by and starring Vardalos, performed for six weeks at the Hudson Backstage Theatre in [[Los Angeles]] in the summer of 1997.<ref name=\"playbill\">{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/36470-My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding-Headed-for-LAs-Globe-Jan-15----and-Film |title=My Big Fat Greek Wedding Headed for L.A.'s Globe Jan. 15 -- and Film |first=Willard |last=Manus |website=Playbill |date=January 15, 1998 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630040313/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/36470-My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding-Headed-for-LAs-Globe-Jan-15----and-Film |archive-date=30 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Vardalos later jokingly stated that she only wrote the play \"to get a better agent\".<ref name=\"hollywood jesus\">[http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/mybigfatgreek_about.htm ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'': About the Production] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910074138/http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/mybigfatgreek_about.htm |date=September 10, 2019 }}, ''Hollywood Jesus'', 2002</ref> The play was based on Vardalos's own family in [[Winnipeg]] in [[Canada]] and on her experience marrying a non-Greek man (actor [[Ian Gomez]]).<ref name=\"hollywood jesus\" /> The play was popular, and was sold out for much of its run, in part due to Vardalos's marketing it across [[Greek Orthodox]] churches in the area.<ref name=\"screenmancer\">[http://www.screenmancer.tv/screentalk/vardalos.htm Nia Vardalos interview], Robin Rea, ''Screenmancer.com''</ref> A number of Hollywood executives and celebrities saw it, including actress [[Rita Wilson]], who is herself of Greek origin;<ref name=\"screenmancer\" /> Wilson convinced her husband, actor [[Tom Hanks]], to see it as well.\n\nVardalos began meeting various executives about making a film version of the play and began writing a screenplay as well.

But then when John (Corbett) and I recently sat down to do that interview (for the 10th anniversary edition), we laughed so hard through the whole thing. It made me think that it's time. He said, \"Come on, write something, will you?\" And I now think I will. We have such an easy chemistry together. And we have chemistry because we never 'did it.' That's the surefire way to kill chemistry in a scene. You have to make sure your actors don't 'do it' off-screen.
