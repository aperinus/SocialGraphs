It serves as an [[alternate ending]] to the television series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', which aired from 1995\u20131996 and ended with two episodes that became controversial.\n\nThe story follows the teenagers [[Shinji Ikari]], [[Rei Ayanami]] and [[Asuka Langley Soryu]], who pilot [[mecha]] called [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]]. Shinji is subjected to the Human Instrumentality Project, in which human souls are merged into a single divine entity. The film features the voice actors of the original series, including [[Megumi Ogata]] as Shinji, [[Yuko Miyamura]] as Asuka, and [[Megumi Hayashibara]] as Rei.\n\nShortly before ''The End of Evangelion''{{'}}s release, Anno and Gainax released another film, ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth]],'' which summarizes the first twenty-four episodes of the series. Like ''Death & Rebirth'', the creators conceived ''The End of Evangelion'' as a duology comprising \"Episode 25: Love Is Destructive\" and \"Episode 26: I Need You\", remakes of the last two episodes of the original television series. In 1998, the overlapping films were edited together and reissued as ''Revival of Evangelion''.\n\n''The End of Evangelion'' was a box-office success, grossing {{\u00a5|2.47 billion}}. It won awards including the 1997 ''[[Animage]]'' Anime Grand Prix, and was praised for its violence, direction, editing, emotional power, and script, though some reviewers criticized its oblique religious symbolism and abstraction.\n\n==Plot ==\n<!-- NOTE: The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT or WP:PLOTSUM for more information. -->\n\nTeenager [[Shinji Ikari]] is the pilot of [[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelion]] [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit-01|Unit 01]], one of several giant cyborgs designed to fight hostile supernatural entities called [[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion|Angels]]. Shinji is distraught after having had to kill his friend [[Kaworu Nagisa]], who revealed himself as an Angel in human form. He visits his fellow pilot [[Asuka Langley Soryu]] in a hospital where she lies comatose. Trying to shake her awake, he accidentally exposes her breasts and masturbates over her comatose body.\n\nNerv, the paramilitary organization that controls the Evangelions, is controlled by a secretive committee called Seele, which has been planning to initiate an event called Third Impact, which will wipe out life on Earth and achieve Human Instrumentality. Seele discovers Shinji's father [[Gendo Ikari]], the commander of Nerv, intends to create his own version of Third Impact to reunite with his deceased wife Yui, whose soul resides in Unit 01. Seele dispatches the Japanese military to seize control of Nerv and exterminate its staff. Nerv major [[Misato Katsuragi]] orders Asuka to be moved to [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit-02|Evangelion Unit 02]] and placed at the bottom of a lake. Misato, who wants Shinji to defend Nerv, rescues him from the invading troops and drags him to Unit 01's bay doors but is shot in the process. Before her death, Misato implores Shinji to pilot Unit 01 and kisses him. Shinji discovers Unit 01 has been immobilized in [[bakelite]].\n\nGendo meets with pilot [[Rei Ayanami]], who carries the soul of the Angel [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Lilith|Lilith]]. Gendo possesses the body of the Angel [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Adam|Adam]]; if he merges Adam and Lilith it will begin Third Impact. Inside Unit 02, Asuka overcomes her trauma and re-activates the unit. She destroys the military forces, but Seele's new mass-produced Evangelion units arrive. Asuka defeats them, but they reanimate and disembowel her and Unit 02. Unit 01 breaks free of the bakelite and ascends above Nerv headquarters. Piloting it, Shinji sees Seele's units carrying the mutilated remains of Unit 02 and screams.\n\nRei betrays Gendo and takes Adam for herself. She merges with Lilith, who changes into a gigantic, white version of Rei. The mass-produced units pull Unit 01 into the sky and crucify it, beginning the ritual to start Third Impact.\n\nLilith makes contact with Shinji. After several dreamlike contemplations, including fighting with and strangling Asuka, who refuses his pleas for help and understanding, Shinji concludes he is alone and everyone in the world, including himself, should die. Lilith responds by initiating Third Impact and dissolving human bodies into the primordial fluid LCL, reforming their souls into a single consciousness. After more contemplation, Shinji rejects this new state, realizing life is about experiencing pain as well as joy. Shinji's rejection causes the destruction of Lilith and the souls of humanity are set free. Yui's soul tells Shinji anyone can return if they have the will to, and they bid farewell, Yui leaving Earth in Unit-01's body to serve as an eternal monument to humanity.\n\nSometime later, the rematerialized Shinji and Asuka lie on a post-apocalyptic shoreline. Shinji catches a glimpse of an ethereal Rei before being startled by Asuka. Shinji begins to strangle her, but when she caresses his face, he stops. As Shinji breaks down in tears, Asuka voices disgust.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Japanese<ref name=BVA>{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/movies/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-The-End-of-Evangelion/|title=Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion (2002)|publisher=Behind The Voice Actors|access-date=21 November 2021}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\"|English\n|-\n!

Asuka says the same phrase in a scene of the director's cut of the twenty-second episode; disgusted by human contact, she refuses to share space and her existence with Shinji or Misato. According to Anime Nation, Shinji strangles Asuka to prove to himself she is distinct and separate from him, the Other, while Asuka's final words may be a reworking of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s quotation; \"Hell is other people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/01/27/ask-john-what-does-asukas-final-line-mean/ |title=Ask John: What Does Asuka's Final Line Mean?|access-date=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309115813/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2003/01/27/ask-john-what-does-asukas-final-line-mean/ |archive-date=9 March 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the official figurine game of the series, a similar explanation is given:\n<blockquote>Shinji renounced the world where all hearts had melted into one and accepted each other unconditionally. His desire to live with 'others'\u2014other hearts that would sometimes reject him, even deny him. That is why the first thing he did after coming to his senses was to place his hands around Asuka's neck. To feel the existence of an 'other'. To confirm rejection and denial.<ref>''Evangelion Carddass Masters G'', card D-88, \u6c17\u6301\u3061\u60aa\u3044, [[Bandai]].</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to contemporary artist and writer [[Takashi Murakami]], Shinji, by attempting to kill Asuka, is asking her for help and seeking understanding. Asuka feels disgusted because she sees Shinji as pathetic and capable of communicating only with himself, and his response represents to Murakami society's view of him.<ref>{{cite book |title=Little Boy: The Arts Of Japan's Exploding Subculture|url=https://archive.org/details/littleboyartsofj0000unse|author=[[Takashi Murakami]]|agency=Yale University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/littleboyartsofj0000unse/page/130 130]-131|year=2005|isbn=978-0-300-10285-7}}</ref> In contrast to the optimistic tone of the series finale, Shinji stops the strangulation only because he begins to cry and feels disgusted with himself.

For Shinji, interpreted by some as a representative of otaku and Anno, Asuka is an ambiguous existence that escapes his control and her ambiguity represents the ambiguity of ''Evangelion''; their relationship is marked by violence and possessiveness, in an ironic criticism of the escapist tendency of animation fans, who are unable to relate to other people and closed in their interiority.<ref name=Tsuribe>{{cite web |url=http://www001.upp.so-net.ne.jp/tsuribe/anime/critique/evait.html |title=La prigione della coscienza: un saggio su Evangelion |author=Manabu Tsuribe |date=February 1999 |access-date=12 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210102233633/http://www001.upp.so-net.ne.jp/tsuribe/anime/critique/evait.html |archive-date=2 January 2021 |url-status=dead}}</ref> According to Nozomi Omori, the film is about \"living with anime\", and would be interpretable as Anno's attempt to argue with himself.

During the live scene, Ayanami tells him one cannot dream alone because it would not be a dream, only an alternative to reality, accusing him of wanting to deceive reality with his fantasy. Simultaneously with Rei's speech, photographs of graffiti on Gainax offices and images of fans at Shinjuku Milano cinema appear on the screen, so the concept of the dream has been interpreted as a metaphor for anime.
