The plot focuses on two siblings and their large family in [[Uppsala]],{{efn|Critic [[Roger Ebert]] observed the town in the film is unnamed.<ref name=\"Ebert\"/> However, some publications refer to it as Bergman's own hometown Uppsala.{{sfn|Haenni|Barrow|White|2014|p=231}}<ref name=\"NYT\"/><ref name=\"Kempley\"/> Frank Gado suggests that \"though not identified by name,\" the town is \"unmistakably Uppsala.\"{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=496}}}} Sweden during the first decade of the twentieth century. Following the death of the eponymous children's father ([[Allan Edwall]]), their mother ([[Ewa Fr\u00f6ling]]) remarries a prominent bishop ([[Jan Malmsj\u00f6]]) who becomes abusive towards Alexander for his vivid imagination.\n\nBergman intended ''Fanny and Alexander'' to be his final picture before retiring, and his script is semi-autobiographical. The characters Alexander, Fanny and stepfather Edvard are based on himself, his sister [[Margareta Bergman|Margareta]] and his father [[Erik Bergman (Lutheran minister)|Erik Bergman]], respectively. Many of the scenes were filmed on location in Uppsala. The documentary film ''[[The Making of Fanny and Alexander]]'' was made simultaneously with the feature and chronicles its production.\n\nThe production was originally conceived as a television [[miniseries]] and cut in that version, spanning 312 minutes; a 188-minute cut version was created later for cinematic release, although this version was in fact the one to be released first. The television version has since been released as a complete film, and both versions have been shown in theaters throughout the world. The 312-minute cut is one of the [[List of longest films|longest cinematic films in history]].\n\nThe theatrical version was released to positive reviews. It won four [[Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]; three [[19th Guldbagge Awards|Guldbagge Awards]], including [[Guldbagge Award for Best Film|Best Film]]; and other honours. ''Fanny and Alexander'' was followed by stage adaptations and further semi-autobiographical screenplays by Bergman, released as films in 1992: ''[[The Best Intentions]]'', directed by [[Bille August]], and ''[[Sunday's Children]]'', directed by [[Daniel Bergman]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1907, young Alexander, his sister Fanny, and their well-to-do family, the Ekdahls, live in a Swedish town, running a moderately profitable theatre. At Christmastime, the Ekdahls hold a [[Nativity play]] and later a large Christmas party. The siblings' parents, Emilie and Oscar, are happily married until Oscar suddenly dies from a stroke. Shortly thereafter, Emilie marries Edvard Verg\u00e9rus, the local bishop and a widower, and moves into his home where he lives with his mother, sister, aunt, and maids.\n\nEmilie initially expects that she will be able to carry over the free, joyful qualities of her previous home into the marriage, but realises that Edvard's harsh authoritarian policies are unshakable. The relationship between the bishop and Alexander is especially cold, as Alexander invents stories, for which Edvard punishes him severely. As a result, Emilie asks for a divorce, which Edvard will not consent to; though she may leave the marriage, this would be legally considered desertion, placing the children in his custody. Meanwhile, the rest of the Ekdahl family has begun to worry about their condition, and Emilie secretly visits her former mother-in-law, Helena, revealing she is pregnant.\n\nDuring Emilie's absence, Edvard confines the children to their bedroom, ostensibly for their safety. There, Alexander shares a story, claiming he was visited by the ghosts of the Verg\u00e9rus family, who revealed the bishop was responsible for their deaths. The maid Justina reports the story to Edvard, who responds with [[corporal punishment]]. After Emilie returns, the Ekdahl family friend Isak Jacobi helps smuggle the children from the house. They live temporarily with Isak and his nephews in their store.\n\nEmilie's former brothers-in-law confront Edvard to negotiate a divorce, using the children, the bishop's debts, and the threat of a public scandal for leverage, but Edvard is unmoved.\n\nEmilie, now in the later stages of her pregnancy, refuses to restore the children to Edvard's home. Emilie allows Edvard to drink a large dosage of her [[bromide]] sedative. She explains to him, as the medication takes effect, that she intends to flee the home as he sleeps. He threatens to follow her family and ruin their lives, but falls unconscious. After she escapes, Edvard's dying Aunt Elsa accidentally overturns a gas lamp, setting her bedclothes, nightgown, and hair on fire. Engulfed in flames, she runs through the house, seeking Edvard's help, but he too, is set aflame. Although partially incapacitated by the sedative, he is able to disentangle himself from Aunt Elsa, but is badly burned and dies shortly thereafter.\n\nAlexander had fantasised about his stepfather's death while living with Isak and his nephews Aron and Ismael Retzinsky. The mysterious Ismael explains that fantasy can become true as he dreams it.\n\nThe Ekdahl family reunites for the christening celebration of Emilie's and the late bishop's daughter as well as the extra-marital daughter of Alexander's uncle, Gustav Adolf, and the family maid, Maj. Alexander encounters the ghost of the bishop who knocks him to the floor, and tells him that he will never be free. Emilie, having inherited the theatre, hands Helena a copy of [[August Strindberg]]'s play ''[[A Dream Play]]'' to read and tells her that they should perform it together onstage. Initially scoffing at the idea and declaring Strindberg a \"misogynist,\" Helena takes to the idea and begins reading it to a sleeping Alexander.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|align     = right\n|width      = 150\n|direction = vertical\n|image1    = Allan Edwall 1965.jpg\n|image2    = Ewa Fr\u00f6ling 1971.jpg\n|footer    =[[Allan Edwall]] and [[Ewa Fr\u00f6ling]] star as parents Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl.\n}}\nThe cast consists of:<ref name=\"BFI\"/>\n\n'''The Ekdahl house'''\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Gunn W\u00e5llgren]] as Helena Ekdahl (grandmother)\n* [[Jarl Kulle]] as Gustav Adolf Ekdahl\n* [[Mona Malm]] as Alma Ekdahl (Gustav's wife)\n* Angelica Wallgren as Eva Ekdahl (Gustav and Almas' daughter)\n* Maria Granlund as Petra\n* Kristian Almgren as Putte\n* Emelie Werk\u00f6 as Jenny\n* [[Allan Edwall]] as Oscar Ekdahl\n* [[Ewa Fr\u00f6ling]] as Emilie Ekdahl (Oscar's wife)\n* Bertil Guve as Alexander Ekdahl\n* Pernilla Allwin as Fanny Ekdahl\n* [[B\u00f6rje Ahlstedt]] as Carl Ekdahl\n* [[Christina Schollin]] as Lydia Ekdahl (Carl's wife)\n* [[Sonya Hedenbratt]] as Aunt Emma\n* [[K\u00e4bi Laretei]] as Aunt Anna von Bohlen\n* Majlis Granlund as Miss Vega\n* [[Svea Holst]] as Miss Ester\n* [[Kristina Adolphson]] as Siri\n* [[Siv Ericks]] as Alida\n* [[Inga \u00c5lenius]] as Lisen\n* Eva von Hanno as Berta\n* [[Pernilla August]] as Maj\n* [[Lena Olin]] as Rosa\n* [[G\u00f6sta Pr\u00fczelius]] as Dr. F\u00fcrstenberg\n* [[Hans Str\u00e5\u00e5t]] as priest\n* [[Carl Billquist]] as Jespersson, police officer\n* [[Axel D\u00fcberg]] as witness\n* [[Olle Hilding]] as priest in the epilogue\n}}\n\n'''The Bishop's house'''\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Jan Malmsj\u00f6]] as Bishop Edvard Verg\u00e9rus\n* [[Kerstin Tidelius]] as Henrietta Verg\u00e9rus\n* Hans Henrik Lerfeldt as Elsa Bergius\n* [[Marianne Aminoff]] as Blenda Vergerus\n* [[Harriet Andersson]] as Justina\n* Linda Kr\u00fcger as Pauline\n* [[Pernilla Wahlgren]] as Esmeralda\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as young man\n}}\n\n'''Jacobi's house'''\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Erland Josephson]] as Isak Jacobi\n* [[Stina Ekblad]] as Ismael Retzinsky\n* [[Mats Bergman]] as Aron Retzinsky\n* [[Gerd Andersson]] as Japanese woman\n}}\n\n'''The Theatre'''\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand]] as Filip Landahl\n* [[Heinz Hopf (actor)|Heinz Hopf]] as Tomas Graal\n* [[Sune Mangs]] as Mr Salenius\n* Nils Brandt as Mr Morsing\n* Per Mattsson as Mikael Bergman\n* [[Anna Bergman]] as Hanna Schwartz\n* Lick\u00e5 Sj\u00f6man as Grete Holm\n* [[Ernst G\u00fcnther]] as Rector Magnificus\n* [[Hugo Hasslo]] as the singer\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Fanny och Alexander manus.jpg|250px|thumb|Bergman's screenplay]]\nDirector [[Ingmar Bergman]] conceived of ''Fanny and Alexander'' while working on his 1980 film ''[[From the Life of the Marionettes]]'', and wrote the screenplay at [[F\u00e5r\u00f6]] in summer 1979.{{sfn|Vermilye|2006|p=42}} Bergman intended ''Fanny and Alexander'' to be his last feature film,{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=494}} although he wrote several screenplays afterwards and directed for television.

The glow that warmed audiences radiates from only an outer layer; its core is as chilling as any of Bergman's fictions\".{{sfn|Gado|1986|p=496}}\n\n===Magic and reality===\n[[File:Gunn W\u00e5llgren and Uno Henning - A Dreamplay.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Gunn W\u00e5llgren]] in Strindberg's ''[[A Dream Play]]'', 1955.]]\nAcademic [[Egil T\u00f6rnqvist]] identified the character Gustav Adolf with secular merriment, while Alexander and Isak inhabit a world filled with the supernatural and evil.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=185}} Critic [[Dave Kehr]] interpreted the [[fairy tale]] style as a product of the story being told from Alexander's perspective, coloured with \"myth and legend\".{{sfn|Kehr|2017|p=102}} Alexander experiences \"visions of ghosts or dream visions alongside everyday reality\", author Laura Hubner wrote.{{sfn|Hubner|2007|p=122}} The sequence these visions are seen in may be significant. After being punished by Edvard for telling a story about how the Verg\u00e9rus family died, Alexander is haunted by the ghosts of the family who deny Edvard's culpability, suggesting Edvard frightened Alexander into seeing this new vision.{{sfn|Hubner|2007|pp=122-123}} Writer Mas'ud Zavarzadeh rationalised Alexander's visions as a product of the character being \"an artist in the making\". Zavarzadeh further noted, \"He is involved in the construction of a more genuine and stable reality than the one that surrounds him\".{{sfn|Zavarzadeh|1991|p=229}}\n\nAs indicated by Gustav Adolf's final speech, most of the Ekdahls do not spend much time grappling with the meaning of life.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=176}}{{efn|Gustav Adolf states: \"We Ekdahls have not come into the world to see through it, never think that. We are not equipped for such excursions. We might just as well ignore the big things. [...] Suddenly, the storm howls and disaster is upon us [...] So it shall be. Therefore, let us be happy while we're happy, let's be kind, generous, affectionate, and good. Therefore it is necessary, and not in the least shameful, to take pleasure in the little world, good food, gentle smiles, fruit trees in bloom, Waltzes\".{{sfn|Gervais|1999|pp=142-143}} }} Zavarzadeh also contrasted Alexander to another of his uncles, Carl, a scholar who relies on logic but who is reduced to an absurdity, at one point entertaining the children with his flatulence.{{sfn|Zavarzadeh|1991|p=232}} T\u00f6rnqvist considered the surname of the characters to be inspired by [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s 1884 play ''[[The Wild Duck]]'', and that it made the name Ekdal synonymous with characters who cope with illusions about reality. ''Fanny and Alexander'' adds an H to Ekdal, giving it an aristocratic air, T\u00f6rnqvist added.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=175}}\n\nHuber cited academics Marilyn Johns Blackwell and T\u00f6rnqvist in support of the point that, despite the title, Alexander is the lead role and Fanny is a minor character; Blackwell added that imagination is \"largely gendered as male\".{{sfn|Hubner|2007|p=121}} Concurring that Fanny is a minor character, Kehr further argued that Alexander influences the plot to a lesser degree than the adult characters, but remains the focus in the storytelling.{{sfn|Kehr|2017|p=102}}\n\nOn Alexander's visions and their reality, critic [[Roger Ebert]] argued:\n{{Blockquote|''Fanny and Alexander'' is above all the story of what Alexander understands is really happening. If magic is real, if ghosts can walk, so be it. Bergman has often allowed the supernatural into his films. In another sense, the events in ''Fanny and Alexander'' may be seen through the prism of the children's memories, so that half-understood and half-forgotten events have been reconstructed into a new fable that explains their lives.<ref name=\"Ebert\"/>}}\n\nIn the end, Helena reads from [[August Strindberg]]'s 1902 play ''[[A Dream Play]]'': \"Anything can happen, all is possible and probable. Time and space do not exist.

Cohen-Shalev argued Edvard disguises his emotional shortcomings with his bourgeois veneer and \"glib, affected piety\".{{sfn|Cohen-Shalev|2009|p=81}} While espousing his devotion, Edvard personally may have secretly lost his belief, and he conflicts with Alexander with \"[[doublethink]]\": using \"love\" to mean \"hate\".{{sfn|Brady|Lee|1988|p=205}} Following Oscar's death, Cohen-Shalev argued Emilie chooses to marry Edvard because she is frightened as to how empty she is: \"I could not understand why nothing really happened, why I never felt really happy\".{{sfn|Cohen-Shalev|2009|p=78}}\n\nThe story makes multiple references to [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'';{{sfn|Weinstein|2008|p=191}} According to Scott-Douglas, Alexander observes Oscar playing [[Ghost (Hamlet)|''Hamlet'''s Ghost]] before he dies, and afterwards appears as a ghost, while Alexander acquires a new abusive stepfather. This made \"theatre and reality seem indistinguishable\".{{sfn|Scott-Douglass|2004|p=256}} Cohen-Shalev argued Oscar being reduced to a ghost is his punishment for never truly living, and losing his life.{{sfn|Cohen-Shalev|2009|p=78}} T\u00f6rnqvist wrote the \"triangle\" of Alexander, Emilie and Edvard is explicitly explained with Emilie's reference to ''Hamlet'', and the characters [[Hamlet (character)|Hamlet]], [[Queen Gertrude]] and [[King Claudius]]: \"Don't act Hamlet, my son. I'm not Queen Gertrude, your kind stepfather is no king of Denmark, and this is not [[Elsinore Castle]], even if it does look gloomy\".{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=177}} Emilie, like Gertrude, is also portrayed as unfaithful, with Bergman's screenplay suggesting Oscar is not Alexander's biological father: in the Nativity play, Oscar plays [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=177}} According to Helena, Oscar fell impotent after Fanny's birth, and Emilie afterwards conducted circumspect affairs.{{sfn|Nyberg|2005|p=103}}\n\nBy framing Edvard as \"stepfather-king\", the story becomes a battle between \"infanticide and parricide\", where killing Edvard is associated with Alexander's \"artistic/sexual emancipation\", scholar [[Arnold Weinstein (scholar)|Arnold L. Weinstein]] wrote.{{sfn|Weinstein|2008|p=191}} T\u00f6rnqvist wrote Alexander displays an \"erotic attraction to his mother\", combined with a hatred for his stepfather, referencing the [[Oedipus complex]].{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=177}} Author Viveka Nyberg identified Oedipal themes as pervasive, suggesting Alexander believes he may have killed both his father and stepfather in competition for his mother's love.{{sfn|Nyberg|2005|p=101}} Nyberg described Emilie as \"beautiful and aloof in equal measure\", and she cares for her children but concerns herself more with other things.{{sfn|Nyberg|2005|p=103}} Alexander's story of being sold to the circus reflects his feelings of his mother forsaking him.{{sfn|Nyberg|2005|p=109}} While Alexander appears to admire Oscar and his imagination, Alexander also listens in on his parents' interactions, and sleeps in Maj's bed, with Maj acting as stand-in mother and an object of sexual desire.{{sfn|Nyberg|2005|p=105}}\n\nCohen-Shalev described cyclical patterns in the story: the family endures seasons of distinct \"symbols, myths, and moods\", including death in winter and resurrections in the spring; or, a journey in which the protagonist experiences a test in the \"Valley of Tears\" before achieving \"blissful family unification\".{{sfn|Cohen-Shalev|2009|p=76}} Edvard is also forgiven with \"a kind of humanity\", Cohen-Shalev wrote, as Edvard confesses his faith is a mask, and his burning death mirrors his analogy of a mask that cannot be removed unless the flesh is removed as well.{{sfn|Cohen-Shalev|2009|p=81}}\n\n===Christianity and Judaism===\n[[File:Julaftonen av Carl Larsson 1904.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Carl Larsson]]'s ''Julaftonen'', a depiction of the [[Jul (Sweden)|Swedish Christmas]] in the 1900s.]]\nThe story opens with exploring celebrations of the [[Jul (Sweden)|Swedish Christmas]], which is expressed through \"colors, sounds, movements, music\" that ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' critic Royal Brown called \"life-affirming, pagan Christianity\".

After this point, true miracles in Bergman's universe have to come from a different source, Perridon wrote.{{sfn|Perridon|1998|p=185}}\n\nThe depiction of [[History of the Jews in Sweden|Jews in Sweden]] revolves around Isak, which academic Rochelle Wright argues is \"far more nuanced\" than in Bergman's previous ''[[The Touch (1971 film)|The Touch]]'' (1971). Isak is not completely assimilated, but his presence in Sweden is presented as positive, as he stands for imagination, \"magic and mystery\", Wright wrote.{{sfn|Wright|2005|p=59}} [[Erland Josephson]], who played Isak, described his performance as a stereotyped portrayal of a Jew, but with mystical and tragic elements, drawing on Jewish people and their history.<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Josephson |first=Erland  |date=2011 |title=Fanny and Alexander: A Bergman Tapestry |work=Fanny and Alexander |medium=Blu-ray |language=sv |publisher=The Criterion Collection}}</ref> Hayes argued that with its take on \"time and space\", the story hinted at Jewish mysticism and the [[Kabbalah]]. The light that engulfs Isak when he screams after being beaten by Edvard calls on the light of the Kabbalah to vanquish evil, Hayes hypothesised.{{sfn|Hayes|1997|p=43}} The scream may have invited \"spiritual intervention\", allowing the children's escape by rendering them invisible in Isak's trunk, while the children seemingly appear lying on the floor to Edvard.{{sfn|Luko|2015|p=196}} T\u00f6rnqvist hypothesised that Jewish [[pantheism]] replaces Christian belief in \"grace and punishment\" in the story.{{sfn|T\u00f6rnqvist|1995|p=177}} Royal Brown argued that Isak's \"cabbalistic magic and animism\" is closer to the Ekdahls' Christianity than to Edvard's.<ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = The biblical [[Ishmael]] (depicted in statue by [[Hans Peder Pedersen-Dan]]) is the namesake of Ismael, played by [[Stina Ekblad]].\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Ismael i bronze.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Stina Ekblad 2014-02-07 CROPPED.jpg\n | width2    = 205\n | alt2      = \n}}\n\nT\u00f6rnqvist identified Ismael as \"one of the more enigmatic features\" of ''Fanny and Alexander'', commenting on the character as a fusion of elements.
