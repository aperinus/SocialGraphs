It co-stars [[Liam Neeson]] and [[Patricia Clarkson]], with [[Jim Carrey]] in his first dramatic role.\n\nIt is the only film in the series not to feature [[Albert Popwell]], an actor who had played a different character in each of the previous four films.\n\nAt 91 minutes, it is the shortest of the five ''Dirty Harry'' films. Like those films, ''The Dead Pool'' is notable for coining [[catchphrase]]s uttered by Clint Eastwood's gun-wielding character, one of which is: \"Opinions are like assholes; everybody has one\".<ref>The effectiveness of this phrase is somewhat diluted in the cleaned-up television version, which goes, \"Opinions are like airheads; every unit has one\".</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nInspector [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]]'s testimony against crime lord Lou Janero puts the mobster in prison. Callahan becomes famous and the target of Janero's men as well as the news media, both of which he dislikes. After Callahan kills four hit men during an ambush, the [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] assigns Al Quan as his partner; Callahan advises him to get a [[bulletproof vest]], as his partners often get killed. The pair investigate the fatal heroin overdose of rock singer Johnny Squares, found in his trailer during filming of a [[music video]] directed by Peter Swan at the [[Port of San Francisco]]. Squares' death was not a typical overdose, but actually murder.\n\nDean Madison, Swan's executive producer, is killed during a [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] restaurant robbery. Callahan kills three of the robbers, and Quan captures the fourth. They discover a list in Madison's pocket with Callahan and Squares' names on it. It is revealed that Madison and Swan are participants in a \"[[dead pool]]\" game, in which participants predict celebrity deaths in the [[San Francisco Bay area|Bay area]]: whether by accident, violence, or natural causes. Movie critic Molly Fisher, also on Swan's list, is soon murdered by an intruder claiming to be Swan \u2014 causing panic among the surviving celebrities, and making Swan a suspect.\n\nAfter Callahan destroys a television station's camera, he must cooperate with reporter Samantha Walker to avoid a lawsuit; if he agrees to a profile of his controversial career, the suit will be dropped. Callahan sees this as a ploy to exploit the danger he is in for its ratings value. Yet after they survive another attack by Janero's men, the incident and her own unwillingness to be the subject of news coverage cause Walker to reconsider the dangers police officers face in juxtaposition with the public's right to know. Meanwhile, at [[San Quentin State Prison]], Callahan uses triple murderer Butcher Hicks to threaten the imprisoned Janero if anything happens to him. Janero ends the attacks, and assigns two men to Callahan as his personal bodyguards, though Callahan initially thinks they are after him.\n\nA man named Gus Wheeler, claiming responsibility for the murders, douses himself in gasoline and threatens to light himself on fire in front of a large crowd. Wheeler is not the murderer, but an attention seeker desperate to appear on camera. Walker foils his plan by refusing to film him; however Wheeler accidentally sets himself on fire, but fortunately Callahan saves him. Impressed by her refusal to exploit Wheeler, Callahan and Walker become close. Meanwhile, Swan tells Callahan and Quan of Harlan Rook, a [[Stalking|deranged fan]] suffering from \"process [[schizophrenia]]\" who thinks the director stole his ideas and work; Swan has a [[restraining order]] against him. Rook kills talk show host Nolan Kennard, another person on the dead pool list, using a [[radio-controlled car]] filled with [[C4 explosive]] under the victim's vehicle. Callahan finds a toy car wheel at the crime scene, and later sees another toy car following him and Quan. Recognizing the threat, they flee through the city pursued by the toy car and Rook himself controlling it from his car. Trapped in an alleyway, Rook sends the car in armed. Callahan is able to back the car up enough so the engine takes most of the blast. Both survive, but Quan has broken ribs.\n\nRook, claiming to be Swan, calls Walker at the television station and invites her to Swan's film studio for an interview. The police discover at Rook's apartment torn posters of Swan's films, large quantities of explosives, and Walker's name replacing Callahan's on the dead pool list. At the studio, Callahan confronts Rook holding Walker hostage. The detective surrenders his [[Smith & Wesson Model 29|.44 Magnum revolver]] after Rook threatens to slit her throat. Callahan lures Rook to a pier after a chase during which Rook shoots at him with his own gun. Rook runs out of ammunition, and Callahan shoots Rook with a [[Svend Foyn]] [[harpoon cannon]], impaling him. Callahan leaves with Walker as the police arrive.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Inspector]] [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]]\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Samantha Walker\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Peter Swan\n* [[Evan C.

It's like revisiting an old friend you haven't seen for a long time. You figure 'I'll go back and see how he feels about things now.'\"<ref>Munn, p. 218</ref> ''The Dead Pool'' was filmed in February and March 1988 in San Francisco.<ref name=\"Hughes76\">Hughes, p.76</ref>\n\n''The Dead Pool'' is the only Dirty Harry film in which [[Albert Popwell]] does not appear. He was not available due to a scheduling conflict with filming on ''[[Who's That Girl (1987 film)|Who's That Girl]]''.\n\n=== Car chase ===\nCallahan is pursued through San Francisco's hilly streets in his unmarked [[Oldsmobile 98]] squad car by a miniature R/C (remote-controlled) car (assembled and controlled by Rook) containing an R/C bomb for Rook to detonate. The R/C car used for the film was a highly modified [[Associated Electrics|Team Associated]] RC10 [[1:10 radio-controlled off-road buggy|electric race buggy]] powered by a Reedy motor that had to be geared up high to an 8.4v [[nickel\u2013cadmium battery|NiCd battery]], topped with an off-the-shelf [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|1963 Chevrolet Corvette]] R/C car body by Parma International. The RC10 had its suspension lowered from the original to a lower ground clearance for better high-speed stability. Needing the best R/C car driver to control the RC10 action, Van Horn hired the [[1985 IFMAR 1:10 Electric Off-Road World Championships|1985 IFMAR 1:10 Electric Off-Road World Champion]] Jay Halsey. At first, Van Horn was unsure if the RC10 could keep up with the Oldsmobile, so for the scene where both vehicles start from the top of the hill, the director allowed both cars to start-off together. As a result, the RC10 outran the Oldsmobile, so the scene had to be re-filmed with the Oldsmobile reaching the bottom first. At one point in a scene where the cars interact, the RC10 jumps over the Oldsmobile, lands, and then proceeds to the end of the street to wait for the Oldsmobile. One scene, in which Halsey was only required to drive the RC10 at full speed to where the bomb was to be detonated, required over a week to film. A [[motorized tricycle]] with a camera mounted at ground level was used for close-up filming of the RC10 in action.<ref name=\"RCCA081988\">{{cite magazine |last1=DeFrancesco |first1=Louis |last2=Hustings |first2=Gene|date=August 1988 |page=56 |title=Dead Pool |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4hnd1wJQLh5Z2lXU0IwOWwyUHc/edit?pref=2&pli=1 |magazine=Radio Control Car Action |publisher=[[Air Age Media]] }}</ref> Engine sound effects for the electric-motor RC10 were added in post production. The chase scenes have many similarities with the famous car-chase in the [[Steve McQueen]] film ''[[Bullitt]]'',<ref name=\"Hughes76\" /> which Eastwood has said was his favorite part of the McQueen film. The necessity of closing down various continuously busy city streets meant that the sequences tend to jump from district to district, much as the similar scenes did in the McQueen film, making for a number of continuity errors that are easily overlooked during the fast-paced scenes, just as the motorcycle chase-scenes in the second Dirty Harry film (\"Magnum Force\") jumped around but are seldom mentioned.\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Dead Pool'' received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 53% approval rating on the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 34 reviews.<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=the_dead_pool}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=The Dead Pool }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that it was \"as good as the original 'Dirty Harry,'\" praising it as \"smart, quick, and made with real wit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-dead-pool-1988 |title=The Dead Pool movie review |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=July 13, 1988 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=December 18, 2019 }}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also awarded three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"the second best of the series, beaten only by the 1971 original,\" explaining that \"where the previous sequels have been mostly dour gun blasts, 'The Dead Pool' is a thriller with wit and humour and tension.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (July 15, 1988).
