It was edited and produced by [[Mary Sweeney]], Lynch's longtime partner and collaborator, who also co-wrote the script with John E. Roach. It is based on the true story of [[Alvin Straight]]'s 1994 journey across [[Iowa]] and [[Wisconsin]] on a [[lawn mower]]. Alvin is an elderly [[World War II]] veteran who lives with his kind [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] daughter. When he hears that his estranged brother has suffered a stroke, Alvin makes up his mind to visit him and hopefully make amends before he dies. Because Alvin's legs and eyes are too impaired for him to receive a driver's license, he hitches a trailer to his recently purchased thirty-year-old [[John Deere]] 110 Lawn Tractor, having a maximum speed of about {{convert|5|mph|km/h}}, and sets off on the 240 mile (390 km) journey from [[Laurens, Iowa]], to [[Mount Zion, Wisconsin]].\n\n''The Straight Story'' was released by [[Buena Vista Pictures]] (under the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] banner<ref name=AFI>{{cite web|title=The Straight Story (1999)|website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|access-date=9 February 2022|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/61718-THE-STRAIGHTSTORY?sid=b9d2126e-1539-4e1c-ba73-6a0c6e1c1296&sr=7.913997&cp=1&pos=0}}</ref>) in the United States,<ref name=\"Disney\"/> and was a critical success, though it underperformed at the [[box office]]. Reviewers praised the intensity of the character performances, particularly the [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] dialogue which film critic [[Roger Ebert]] compared to the works of [[Ernest Hemingway]].<ref name=\"ebert\"/> It received a nomination for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]] and Farnsworth received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Laurens, Iowa]], Alvin Straight fails to show up to his regular bar meeting with friends and is eventually found lying on his kitchen floor. His daughter, Rose, takes her reluctant father to see a doctor, who sternly admonishes Alvin to give up tobacco and use a [[walking frame]]. Alvin refuses and instead opts to use two canes. Shortly after, Alvin learns that his brother, Lyle, has suffered a stroke. Longing to visit him, but unable to drive, Alvin develops a plan to travel 240 miles to [[Mount Zion, Wisconsin]] on his riding lawnmower, towing a small homemade travel-trailer along the way. This stirs doubt and worry in the minds of his family, friends, and neighbors.\n\nAlvin's first attempt fails: after experiencing difficulty starting the old mower's motor, he does not get far before the machine breaks down. Alvin arranges for his mower to be transported back home on a flatbed truck, where he takes out his frustrations on the mower with a shotgun blast. At the [[John Deere]] dealership, he purchases a used lawn tractor whose transmission is still intact from 1966. The salesman offers Alvin kind words as his journey resumes.\n\nOn the side of the highway, Alvin passes a young female hitchhiker who later approaches his campfire and says that she could not get a ride. In conversation, Alvin deduces that she is pregnant and has run away from home. Alvin tells her about the importance of family by describing a bundle of sticks that is hard to break compared to a single stick. The next day, Alvin emerges from the trailer to find that she has left him a bundle of sticks tied together. Later, a huge group of [[RAGBRAI]] cyclists race past him. He arrives at the cyclists' camp and is greeted with applause. That night, he speaks with a pair of friendly cyclists around the campfire about growing old.\n\nThe next day, Alvin is troubled by massive trucks passing him. He then interacts with a distraught woman who has hit a deer and is being driven insane by the fact she continually hits deer while commuting, no matter how hard she tries to avoid them. She drives away in a tearful huff, and Alvin, who has started to run short on food, cooks and eats the deer. He mounts the antlers on his trailer as a tribute to the deer and the sustenance it provided. Alvin's brakes fail as he travels down a steep hill; he struggles to maintain control of the speeding tractor and finally manages to bring the vehicle to a complete stop. A man named Danny helps Alvin get his mower and trailer off the main road. They discover that the mower has transmission problems.\n\nNow beginning to run low on cash, Alvin borrows a cordless phone from Danny \u2013 gently refusing an invitation to come indoors \u2013 and calls Rose to ask her to send him his [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] check. He leaves money on the doorstep to pay for his telephone call. Danny offers Alvin a ride the rest of the way to Lyle's, but Alvin declines, stating that he prefers to travel his own way. Verlyn, an elderly war veteran, takes Alvin into town for a drink. As Alvin does not drink alcohol, he orders a glass of milk, and the two men exchange traumatic stories about their experiences in [[World War II]] fighting against the Germans.\n\nAlvin's tractor is fixed, and he is presented with an exorbitant bill by the mechanics, who are twins and are constantly bickering. Alvin successfully negotiates the price down and explains his mission to help his brother. The twins seem to relate to Alvin's struggle. Alvin crosses the [[Mississippi River]] and makes camp in a cemetery. He chats with a Catholic priest who recognizes Lyle's name and is aware of his stroke. The priest says that Lyle did not mention he had a brother. Alvin responds that all he wants is to make peace with Lyle after their falling out ten years prior.\n\nFinally arriving in Mount Zion, Alvin stops at a bar to have a single beer: his first drink in years. He asks the bartender for directions to Lyle's house. Alvin experiences engine trouble just a few miles from Lyle's house and stops in the middle of the road. A large farm tractor driving by stops to help, then leads the way to make sure Alvin gets to his destination. When he arrives, Alvin finds the house dilapidated. He calls for his brother, who appears using a zimmer frame. Using two canes, Alvin makes his way to the door. Lyle invites Alvin to sit down on the porch. Lyle tearfully looks at Alvin's mower-tractor contraption and asks if Alvin had ridden it just to see him. Alvin simply responds, \"I did, Lyle.\" The two men sit together silently and gaze up at the stars.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columnslist|\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as [[Alvin Straight]]\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Rose Straight\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Lyle Straight\n* Jane Galloway Heitz as Dorothy\n* Joseph Carpenter as Bud\n* Donald Wiegert as Sig\n* Ed Grennan as Pete\n* Jack Walsh as Apple\n* James Cada as Danny Riordan\n* [[Wiley Harker]] as Verlyn Heller\n* [[Kevin Farley]] as Harald Olsen\n* [[John P.
