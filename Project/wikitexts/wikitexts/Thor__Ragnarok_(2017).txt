Ruffalo joined the cast reprising the role of [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]] from previous MCU films, which allowed elements of the 2006 comic storyline \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" to be adapted for ''Ragnarok''. The rest of the cast, including Blanchett as Hela, was confirmed in May 2016, with Pearson's involvement revealed at the start of filming that July.

He explains that the realm will soon be destroyed during the prophesied [[Ragnarok (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ragnar\u00f6k]], once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Odin's vault|Odin's vault]]. Thor frees himself, defeats Surtur and takes his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnar\u00f6k.\n\nThor returns to Asgard to find [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] gone and his estranged brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] posing as Odin. After exposing Loki, Thor forces him to help find their father, and with directions from [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] at the [[New York Sanctum|Sanctum Sanctorum]] in [[New York City]], they locate Odin in [[Norway]]. Odin explains that he is dying, Ragnar\u00f6k is imminent despite Thor's efforts to prevent it, and his passing will free his firstborn child, [[Hela (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hela]], from [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Hel|a prison]] she was sealed in long ago. Hela was the leader of Asgard's armies, conquering the [[Nine Realms (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nine Realms]] with Odin, but he imprisoned her and wrote her out of history after fearing that she had become too ambitious and powerful.\n\nOdin dies as Thor and Loki look on, and Hela appears, destroying Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]]. She pursues the two as they attempt to flee through the [[Bifrost (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bifr\u00f6st Bridge]], forcing them out into space. Arriving in Asgard, she defeats its army and kills the [[Warriors Three (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Warriors Three]]. She then resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Fenris|Fenris]], and appoints the Asgardian [[Skurge (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skurge]] as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifr\u00f6st to expand Asgard's empire, but Heimdall sneaks in, takes the sword that controls the Bifrost, and begins hiding other Asgardians. Thor crash-lands on Sakaar, a garbage planet surrounded by [[wormhole]]s.\n\nA slave trader designated [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scrapper 142]] subdues him with an obedience disk and sells him as a [[gladiator]] to Sakaar's ruler, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]], with whom Loki has already ingratiated himself. Thor recognizes 142 as a [[Valkyrior|Valkyrie]], one of a legendary force of female warriors who were killed fighting Hela eons ago. Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]], facing his old friend [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]]. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved after the fight, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither is willing.\n\nHe soon manages to escape the palace and finds the [[Quinjet (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Quinjet]] that brought the Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] causes him to transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia. The Grandmaster orders 142 and Loki to find Thor and Hulk, but the pair come to blows and Loki forces her to relive the deaths of her Valkyrie companions at the hands of Hela. Deciding to help Thor, she takes Loki captive. Unwilling to be left behind, Loki provides the group with the means to steal one of the Grandmaster's ships. They then liberate the other gladiators who, incited by two aliens named [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]] and [[Miek (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Miek]], stage a revolution. Loki again attempts to betray his brother, but Thor anticipates this and incapacitates him, leaving him behind where Korg, Miek, and the gladiators soon find him.\n\nThor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces attack Heimdall and the remaining Asgardians in pursuit of the sword that controls the Bifr\u00f6st. Banner transforms into Hulk again, defeating Fenris, while Thor and 142 fight Hela and her warriors. Loki and the gladiators arrive to rescue the citizens, and a repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to enable their escape. Thor, facing Hela, loses his right eye and then has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only Ragnar\u00f6k can stop her. He sends Loki to retrieve Surtur's crown and place it in the Eternal Flame. Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, killing Hela as the refugees flee.

Director [[Taika Waititi]] added that \"stripping\" the character down like this allowed him to become a refugee at the end of the film.<ref name=\"ThorLoseEye\" /> Waititi also wanted to use more of Hemsworth's comedic skills showcased in films such as ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]'' (2015) and ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /> and cited [[Kurt Russell]]'s performance in ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986) as an influence on the character.<ref name=\"ColliderSequelSep2017\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and [[Archenemy|nemesis]], based on the deity of the [[Loki|same name]].<ref name=\"Oct2014EventEW\" /><ref name=\"MarvelMay2016\" /> Hiddleston was interested in how Loki's attitude has changed, saying, \"he is always a trickster.

The decision to make Hela related to Thor, as opposed to only Loki as in the comics and Norse mythology, came from needing more impact with Hela and Thor's final confrontation. By making the change, Pearson felt Hela became \"the thing that [represents] what it is to rule Asgard, [Thor's] family, what he's been told, what he hasn't been told.\"<ref name=\"PearsonYahoo\" /> Blanchett found it difficult to portray the character in a motion capture suit rather than costume, feeling Hela's headdress is \"such a huge part of\" the power of the character that she would have liked to wear it on set.<ref name=\"LATimesSept2017\" /> Hela's design was taken from the comic ''Thor: God of Thunder'' by [[Jason Aaron]], while the character [[Gorr the God Butcher|Gorr]] from that comic, who has the ability \"to manifest an infinite number of weapons\", inspired a similar ability for Hela.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Influence\" /> Blanchett worked with stuntwoman [[Zo\u00eb Bell]] and Hemsworth's personal trainer Luke Zocchi, and studied [[capoeira]] for the role.<ref name=\"NewsAUSDCC\" /><ref name=\"EWMar2017\" />\n* [[Idris Elba]] as [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]]: <br />The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian and former sentry of the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, based on the deity of the [[Heimdall|same name]], who has gone into self-imposed exile during Loki's reign.<ref name=\"MarvelMay2016\" /><ref name=\"UrbanComingSoonSDCC\" /><ref name=\"PressKit\" /> After Hela invades Asgard, he helps to hide its vulnerable citizens. Describing Heimdall's character arc in the film, Winderbaum says, \"he's gone from this elder statesmen, the gatekeeper to Asgard, to this badass warrior-wizard character who lives in the hills and kicks a lot of ass throughout the entire film.\"<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]]: <br />One of the [[Elders of the Universe]]<ref name=\"EWSDCC2017\" /><ref name=\"CNETSDCC2017\" /> who rules the planet Sakaar<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /> and enjoys manipulating lesser life-forms.<ref name=\"MarvelMay2016\" /><ref name=\"THRMay2016\" /> Goldblum described the character as \"a hedonist, a pleasure-seeker, an enjoyer of life and tastes and smells\". He also said that Waititi encouraged improvisation in order for Goldblum to \"make [the character his] own\".<ref name=\"Goldblum\" /> Waititi explained that Grandmaster does not have blue skin in the film as the character does in the comics, because Goldblum had already played a blue-colored character in ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' (1988), and because Waititi did not want to detract from Goldblum's personality by concealing his appearance.<ref name=\"GoldblumBlue\" /> Grandmaster is the brother of [[Benicio del Toro]]'s [[Taneleer Tivan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Collector]] from ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), and producer [[Kevin Feige]] expressed interest in seeing the two together in a future film.<ref name=\"GrandmasterCollector\" />\n* [[Tessa Thompson]] as [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scrapper 142 / Valkyrie]]: <br />A tough, hard-drinking Asgardian slave trader,<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /> based on the mythological being [[Brynhildr]],<ref name=\"BustleMay2016\" /> who was once a legendary Valkyrie warrior and now works for the Grandmaster under the designation \"Scrapper 142\".<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> Thompson said the various versions of the character from the comics \"left us a lot of leeway\" in creating the film version.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Influence\" /> Waititi \"wanted to make sure we weren't making a female character that was boring and pretty\",<ref name=\"ThompsonMar2017\" /> and Feige said Marvel wanted to pair Thor with a love interest more his equal than [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]].<ref name=\"FosterUpdate\" /> Co-screenwriters [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]]'s original draft of the film had more of a romantic relationship between Thor and Valkyrie. When Pearson started working on the film, he moved away from that storyline, instead focusing more on \"the mutual respect\" between the characters and Valkyrie \"dealing with her [[PTSD]]. She's someone who's drowning her sorrows in the bottle, and I just thought that was such a cool thing that you don't often see\".<ref name=\"PearsonYahoo\" /> Thompson stated that the character is [[bisexual]], which she based on the character's comic book relationship with [[Annabelle Riggs]], and convinced Waititi to shoot a glimpse of a woman walking out of Valkyrie's bedroom, which was later cut from the film, as it \"distracted\" from the scene's exposition.<ref name=\"ThomponRollingStone\" /> Thompson was inspired by pictures of [[Linda Hamilton]] as [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991) while training for the role,<ref name=\"ThompsonMar2017\" /> and worked with dialect coach [[Andrew Jack (dialect coach)|Andrew Jack]] to create an Asgardian-sounding accent that was different enough to sound like she had been away from there for a long time.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg2\" /> Thompson will appear in future MCU films.<ref name=\"MarvelMay2016\" /><ref name=\"Thompson\" />\n* [[Karl Urban]] as [[Skurge (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skurge]]: <br />An Asgardian warrior<ref name=\"MarvelMay2016\" /><ref name=\"THRMay2016\" /> who guards the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge in Heimdall's absence and chooses to join Hela to survive.<ref name=\"LATimesSept2017\" /><ref name=\"UrbanComingSoonSDCC\" /> Urban shaved his head for the role, and worked out to \"get into the zone and feel\" the part even though his body is hidden under a costume.<ref name=\"UrbanPrep\" /> Urban said Skurge \"makes a deal with the devil\" and becomes Hela's \"henchman.

Feige explained that this was changed to an Earth-based location to leave Hulk's fate ambiguous and dispel rumors that a film based on \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" was in development, since Marvel Studios had no plans to adapt the storyline at the time.<ref name=\"HulkAgeOfUltron\" /> According to executive producer Brad Winderbaum, the idea to include Hulk in ''Ragnarok'' came early on in development, when the production team looked at the \"Planet Hulk\" storyline and felt it was a \"no brainer\" to integrate Hulk into the ''Thor'' franchise, exploring \"the idea of a planet where there's gladiatorial games as a Thor predicament. [That storyline] was a really cool idea to us.\"<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Trivia\" /> Feige further explained that initial discussions had focused on doing \"something totally different with Thor\", and that centered on continuing the relationship with Loki and ideas for [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], and [[Beta Ray Bill]], \"but we were like, 'We need something big.{{'\"}} This turned to discussing Thor going to space, and jokingly calling it \"Planet Thor\", which led to including Hulk in the film and revealing that he ultimately went to space at the end of ''Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"HulkAgeOfUltron\" />\n\nAlso in October, Australia's [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] [[Julie Bishop]] announced that filming would take place in the country,<ref name=\"Australia\" /> exclusively throughout the state of [[Queensland]], including at [[Village Roadshow Studios]] in [[Oxenford, Queensland|Oxenford]], [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. According to [[Premier of Queensland|Premier]] [[Annastacia Palaszczuk]], the production was to spend over [[Australian dollar|$]]100{{nbsp}}million in Queensland and employ 750 Queenslanders.<ref name=\"Queensland\" /> Hemsworth had asked Marvel to produce the film in his home country of Australia.<ref name=\"HemsworthAustralia\" /> At the end of November 2015, [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], who portrayed [[Erik Selvig]] in the previous ''Thor'' films, said that he was contracted to appear should Marvel want to include him, but he was uncertain at the time if they did.<ref name=\"SkarsgardOption\" /> He later confirmed that he would not appear in ''Thor: Ragnarok''.<ref name=\"SkarsgardNo\" /> The next month, [[Stephany Folsom]] was hired to work on the script, and [[Cate Blanchett]] entered final negotiations to join the cast.<ref name=\"Blanchett\" /><ref name=\"Folsom\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Taika Waititi by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Waititi at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nIn January 2016, with the film beginning pre-production,<ref name=\"Queensland\" /><ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" /> Ruffalo described it as a \"[[road movie]]\" and indicated that additional filming would take place in [[Sydney]].<ref name=\"Ruffalo3\" /> Waititi stated that he was working on the script \"a little bit\", mainly adding humor to the screenplay,<ref name=\"WaititiScript\" /> with [[Eric Pearson]] joining the project to rewrite the screenplay. Pearson felt joining presented many challenges, as \"there were so many puzzle pieces already there,\" such as having Blanchett as Hela,<ref name=\"PearsonTHR\" /> who was confirmed in the role a month later,<ref name=\"Blanchett2\" /> and including Hulk, Valkyrie, and [[Executioner (comics)|Skurge]], that he was asked to assemble. Pearson was told not to be restrained by anything from the previous films, and Waititi asked him to make the film fun and have Thor \"be the coolest character.\"<ref name=\"PearsonTHR\" /> Alexander said in early March that she was no longer sure if she would appear in the film, due to scheduling conflicts with her television series ''[[Blindspot (TV series)|Blindspot]]''.<ref name=\"AlexanderUnsure\" /> She later indicated that this may not be the case,<ref name=\"THRMay2016\" /><ref name=\"AlexanderMayTweet\" /> but ultimately was unable to appear in the film due to the conflict.<ref name=\"AlexanderNo\" /><ref name=\"AlexanderConflict\" /> Sif does appear as a character in the play based on the events of ''The Dark World'', portrayed by [[Charlotte Nicdao]].<ref name=\"Nicadao\" />\n\nIn April, [[Tessa Thompson]] was cast as [[Valkyrie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Valkyrie]],<ref name=\"MarvelMay2016\" /><ref name=\"Thompson\" /> with [[Natalie Portman]] not returning from the previous films as love interest [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]].<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" /><ref name=\"NoPortman\" /> Marvel never asked the screenwriters to include the Earth-based characters from the previous films,<ref name=\"NoEarthCharacters\" /> and Feige said that Foster and Thor have broken up between films.<ref name=\"FosterUpdate\" /> In May, Marvel confirmed Blanchett and Thompson for the film, announced the casting of [[Jeff Goldblum]] as [[Grandmaster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Grandmaster]] and [[Karl Urban]] as [[Skurge (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Skurge]], and revealed that [[Idris Elba]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]] would reprise their respective roles of [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] and [[Odin (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Odin]] from the previous films.<ref name=\"MarvelMay2016\" /> In early June, Palaszczuk and Marvel Studios executive David Grant announced that filming would begin on July 4, 2016,<ref name=\"July4Filming\" /> with [[Weta Workshop]] creating props for the film.<ref name=\"UrbanPrep\" /> Before the sets for Marvel's ''Doctor Strange'' were demolished, Waititi wrote and filmed a scene for ''Ragnarok'' where Thor meets [[Benedict Cumberbatch]]'s [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]]. Marvel and ''Doctor Strange'' director [[Scott Derrickson]] felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU, so the scene also appears during the credits of ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"CumberbatchRagnarok\" /><ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" />\n\nFeige noted that ''Thor: Ragnarok'' would primarily take place in the \"cosmos\" rather than on Earth, a departure from the previous ''Thor'' films.<ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"FeigeDec2015\" /> He expanded by saying, \"Tonally and geographically there are a lot of different planets outside of the nine realms that we visit\" in the film.<ref name=\"FeigeMay2016\" /> Waititi consulted with [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Clifford Victor Johnson|Clifford Johnson]] on [[Intergalactic travel|space travel]]. Johnson viewed early drafts of the script, and gave Waititi physics ideas that could \"wink at some of the classic old [Thor] stuff\"; Johnson previously consulted on the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]] of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|MCU television series]] ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]''.<ref name=\"JohnsonConsultant\" /> Astronomer-physicist Adam Frank was also a consultant on the film, advising on wormholes and interstellar travel.<ref name=\"FrankConsultant\" /> Comic artist and Thor co-creator [[Jack Kirby]] was one of Waititi's major visual inspirations for the film.<ref name=\"TotalFilmSakaar\" /> Winderbaum also called [[Walt Simonson]]'s \"Ragnarok\" story arc an inspiration for \"really fun elements ... both stylistically and narratively\", as well as ''Thor: God of Thunder'' by [[Jason Aaron]], which was the inspiration for Hela's design and abilities.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Influence\" /> Waititi said the planet Sakaar, which is featured in the \"Planet Hulk\" storyline, was \"the biggest shift for the film and these characters\",<ref name=\"TotalFilmSakaar\" /> with Winderbaum describing it as \"the toilet of the universe\", surrounded by \"wormholes that have been spitting things out into this place for eons\".<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Trivia\" /> Also featured is [[Muspelheim]], one of the [[Nine Realms]], ruled by [[Surtur (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Surtur]]. [[Production designer]] [[Dan Hennah]] described it as a [[Dyson sphere]], with the realm drawing power out of a dying star to energize its inhabitants.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg1\" /> Hennah hoped to give [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] \"more of a humanity\" than in previous films, by adding smaller building perspectives to help the realm seem more practical and utilitarian. For Saakar's gladiator arena, Hennah looked at Roman gladiators, but differentiated from previous similar ideas by going \"all alien with it\". The arena is surrounded by \"standing up bleachers\".<ref name=\"HennahMarvelOct2017\" />\n\nWaititi said that the film would reinvent the franchise, as \"a lot of what we're doing with the film is, in a way, kind of dismantling and destroying the old idea and rebuilding it in a new way that's fresh. Everyone's got a slightly new take on their characters, so in that way, it feels like [this is] the first ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).\"<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /> He added that he had seen the other films and respected them, but wanted to focus on making a \"standalone film because this could be the only time I do this. I just want to make it [my] version of a Marvel film in the best way possible.\"<ref name=\"ColliderSequelSep2017\" /> This is something Hemsworth had hoped for, looking to have a lighter tone in ''Ragnarok'' compared to the previous ''Thor'' films, especially the second one, similar to ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. He said, \"I feel we had less of the sort of the naivety or fun or humor that the first [''Thor''] might have had. I wish we had more of that in the second [movie] ... We've done regal. We've done Shakespeare, and we've shown that. I think now it's time to go, 'Ok, cool. Let's try something different.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"HemsworthNov2015\" /> Hemsworth continued that in order to prevent the character or film from becoming \"predictable\", there was \"definitely a goal to do something unexpected...I think we want to get back to more of a sense of adventure and fun\".<ref name=\"HemsworthDec2015\" />\n\nThe events of ''Ragnarok'' are set four years after the events of ''Thor: The Dark World'', two years after the events of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"Oct2014EventMarvel\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineSDCC\" /> and around the same time as the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) and ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), with Winderbaum noting that \"things happen on top of each other now in Phase Three.\"<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Timeline\" /> The events of ''Ragnarok'' also set up ''Avengers: Infinity War'',<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /> and Hemsworth spoke to ''Infinity War'' directors [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]] before receiving the script for ''Ragnarok'' to see how it would link to ''Infinity War''. He said ''Ragnarok'' \"definitely bleeds nicely into those [films]\",<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Timeline\" /> and Winderbaum likened ''Ragnarok''{{'}}s impact on the larger MCU to that of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), saying it would break down ideas regarding Asgard that were previously established similar \"to how ''Winter Soldier'' broke down [[S.H.I.E.L.D.

However, Premier Palaszczuk stated that the work for set builders simply \"finished\", and that other jobs would become available as actors arrived for filming.<ref name=\"GCBJuly2016\" /> Sets constructed for the film were for Sakaar, including the Grandmaster's palace and surrounding junkyard, as well as Asgard (based on the aesthetics of the previous ''Thor'' films).<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> The interior of the Avenger [[Quinjet]], which was built for ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), was shipped to Australia.<ref name=\"WaititiNYTimes\" /> Waititi, who is [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], made hiring [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] and [[Aboriginal Australians]], along with [[New Zealanders]], a priority for the various departments, saying, \"It's a responsibility you have to the Indigenous people. You're coming to a country and you're bringing money into the economy and creating jobs but I think you have an even bigger responsibility to look after the people that have less opportunities.\" He added that having these people on the crew \"feel[s] very much like family\" and \"helps calm me down and makes me feel relaxed\". The Indigenous and Aboriginals were hired as part of an initiative by [[Screen Australia]]'s Indigenous Department, whose mission is \"to give Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islanders]] a foot in the door of the film industry\".<ref name=\"Aboriginals\" />\n\nIn mid-September 2016, concept art seen during a set visit indicated [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]] would appear,<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg3\" /> and that [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Warriors Three]], allies of Thor in the previous two films, would be addressed in ''Ragnarok''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg2\" /> Towards the end of the month, [[Sam Neill]], who worked with Waititi in ''Hunt for the Wilderpeople'', revealed he had a role in the film.<ref name=\"Neill\" /> Shortly after, Waititi teased the inclusion of the characters [[Korg (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Korg]],<ref name=\"KorgTease\" /> who Waititi portrays through motion-capture,<ref name=\"Korg2\" /> and [[Miek (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Miek]],<ref name=\"Miek\" /> who is not portrayed by an actor as he does not speak in the film, and is depicted as \"a larva-like creature... [with] cybernetic legs and arms\".<ref name=\"Korg2\" /> In mid-October, Waititi revealed that new camera technology had been used for a shot in the film, and that he had hoped to include [[John C. Reilly]]'s [[Nova Corps]]man [[Rhomann Dey]] in the film, but there was \"no real way to pull it off\".<ref name=\"WaititiAMA\" /> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 28, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /> [[Second unit]] filming took place on [[Dirk Hartog Island]] off the coast of [[Western Australia]], and in the [[South Island]] of New Zealand.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> According to Waititi, 80 percent of the dialogue in ''Thor: Ragnarok'' was improvised, in order to create a \"very loose and collaborate mood\" among the cast, and as an attempt to replicate the tone and sensibility from his previous films. He stated, \"My style of working is I'll often be behind the camera, or right next to the camera yelling words at people, like, 'Say this, say this! Say it this way!{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Improv\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn January 2017, it was revealed that Pearson would receive sole screenwriting credit on the film, with the story credited to Kyle, Yost, and Folsom.<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /> These credits were later updated the following September, with Pearson as the screenwriter and story credit for Kyle and Yost. Folsom took issue with Marvel marketing the film with these credits, noting the [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) had yet to determine the final credits for the film.<ref name=\"PosterWritingCredits\" /> She later said that Marvel had given her a story credit on the film, but it was denied by the WGA due to their regulation that a maximum of two individuals can receive story credit, with an allowance for a writing team to count as one individual; Pearson and the team of Kyle and Yost received the story credit on ''Ragnarok''. Folsom added that she planned to appeal the decision, and that Marvel has been supportive of her throughout her attempt to receive credit.<ref name=\"FolsomCreditDenied\" /> By the end of the month, the writing credits were updated once again, this time simply crediting Pearson, Kyle, and Yost as screenwriters.<ref name=\"PearsonTHR\" /><ref name=\"AlexanderNo\" /><ref name=\"NewCredits\" />\n\nIn February 2017, [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]] said she had a small role in the film, having worked with Waititi before.<ref name=\"House\" /> Additional filming took place in [[Atlanta]] in July 2017, over three weeks,<ref name=\"Atlanta\" /><ref name=\"ReshootsDone\" /> including filming [[post-credit scene]]s.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes\" /> One of these introduces the spaceship ''Sanctuary II'', which belongs to [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] in ''Avengers: Infinity War'',<ref name=\"MidCredits\" /> while the other, shown at the end of the credits, features the Grandmaster. Goldblum and Waititi improvised multiple versions of the latter scene; one unused version involved the singing of the Sakaarian national anthem, which was \"made up on the spot\".<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes2\" /> Also filmed in Atlanta was the completion of a sequence where Asgardian actors perform a play based on the events of ''The Dark World''. Neill appears in the sequence as the Odin actor, and Hemsworth's brother [[Luke Hemsworth|Luke]] portrays the Thor actor.<ref name=\"/FilmFeige\" /> Explaining the sequence, Waititi said, \"if I was Loki and I was ruling Asgard, I would write a play about myself and force everyone to go and see it\u2014change the details of the play and get a huge celebrity to play myself.\" For the Loki actor, they \"really wanted someone good and someone who's funny\", and Chris Hemsworth suggested that [[Matt Damon]], whom he knew personally, take on the role.<ref name=\"ActorActors\" /> Damon was in New York City at the time, and flew to Atlanta just to shoot the cameo \"on a lark\".<ref name=\"ActorActors\" /><ref name=\"/FilmFeige\" /> Also changed during reshoots was the location of the sequence where Thor and Loki find Odin on Earth, and Hela subsequently destroys Mjolnir. Originally set in a New York City alley, Waititi decided that the environment was distracting from the emotions of the sequence. The location was changed to Norway, which Waititi felt gave more weight to the scenes, made Odin's storyline more \"authentic\", and also allowed the characters and the audience to \"chill out for a second, and have that moment, because the rest of the film basically just runs at a clip\".<ref name=\"OdinSceneChange\" />\n\nBy the time the reshoots for the film were completed, the film had been cut down from Waititi's initial version of two hours and forty minutes to around ninety minutes, with that expected to increase slightly with the newly filmed scenes. However, after the film's 2017 Comic Con panel, it was decided to add back a lot of the jokes that had been removed, with the final runtime being two hours and ten minutes.<ref name=\"WaititiColliderVid\" /> Joel Negron and [[Zene Baker]] served as editors on the film.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"WaititiNYTimes\" /> Waititi described the process of deciding exactly what jokes to keep as \"very tricky ... sometimes it would be funny in the beginning of the film and then not funny at all [or] it was funny in the wrong places and in the end, we had to just keep testing jokes and testing parts of the film\".<ref name=\"WaititiCBRJokes\" /> ''Ragnarok'' also clarifies that an [[Infinity Gauntlet]] seen in ''Thor'' was a fake. Feige expanded, saying that it had been included in ''Thor'' as an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]], since Marvel Studios was \"working on ''The Avengers'' and trying to [put] that all together for the conclusion of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]].\" However, shortly after ''The Avengers'' released and the studio began to solidify plans for ''Avengers: Infinity War'', they realized that the gauntlet seen in ''Thor'' could not be the actual one, creating an internal theory that it was fake; this resulted in the scene in ''Ragnarok'', which was created \"just [to have] the opportunity to call it a fake\".<ref name=\"/FilmFeige\" />\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n[[File:Valkyrie flashback VFX in Thor Ragnarok.jpg|thumb|Original (top) and effects (bottom) shots of the Valkyrie flashback sequence in ''Thor: Ragnarok'']]\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzhnVMkquwE Marvel Studios' Thor: Ragnarok End Credits Main on End Title Sequence Design] presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, [[YouTube]] video from [[Perception (visual effects company)|Perception]]'s channel}}\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Industrial Light & Magic]]'s (ILM) San Francisco and Vancouver studios,<ref name=\"ILM\" /> with help from [[Base FX]], Animatrik, and Virtuos; [[Framestore]]; [[Method Studios]] Vancouver; [[Digital Domain]]; [[Rising Sun Pictures]]; [[Luma Pictures]]; [[Double Negative (VFX)|D Negative]]; Iloura; [[Image Engine]]; Trixter; The Secret Lab; WhiskeyTree Inc; Fin Designs + Effects; and [[Perception (visual effects company)|Perception]].<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> [[Previsualization]] work was provided by The Third Floor and Day for Nite.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"DayforNite\" /> Luma Pictures produced over 200 shoots in eight sequences, particularly for the characters Korg (receiving assets from Framestore) and Miek. Method Studios provided over 450 shots, including Thor's opening fight against Surtur in Muspelheim and Hela's fight against the Asgardian guards. D Negative worked on over 190 shots, creating the environment for the planet Sakaar, including its junkyard landscape and wormholes, with the wormholes also created through a collaboration with Digital Domain.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception.<ref name=\"Perception\" />\n\nILM, who worked on previous incarnations of the Hulk, had to add much more detail to the character's facial features in ''Ragnarok'' due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM \"built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics.\"<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Trivia\" /> Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under {{convert|5|ft|m|2}} tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stuntmen would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from ''The Dark World'', resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" />\n\nRising Sun Pictures produced more than 170 visual effects shots for ''Thor: Ragnarok''. They worked on the Valkyrie flashback sequence, with the sequence's surreal ethereal appearance achieved through a combination of motion capture, computer graphics, a 900 fps high-speed frame rate, and a special 360-degree lighting rig containing 200 strobe lights to bathe the scene in undulating patterns of light and shadow. Rising Sun also helped create the various CGI aspects of Hela, such as her \"hair wipe transition\" to her horns, and her original introduction in New York City. Following the reshoots, ImageEngine completed the new Norway introduction since Rising Sun was focused on the palace fight by then.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart1\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Thor: Ragnarok (soundtrack)}}\nBy August 2016, [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] was hired to score the film.<ref name=\"Mothersbaugh\" /><ref name=\"Mothersbaugh2\" /> The synthesized score is influenced by the work of [[Jean-Michel Jarre]].<ref name=\"LATimesSept2017\" /> Waititi stated he would have asked the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to work on the soundtrack for the film if their lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] was still alive, because the film is \"a cool, bold, colorful cosmic adventure\" which would have suited the \"feel\" of the band.<ref name=\"WaititiQueen\" /> Additional music featured in the film include \"Immigrant Song\" by Led Zeppelin and \"[[Pure Imagination]]\" from the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971). [[Patrick Doyle]]'s themes from ''Thor'' and [[Brian Tyler]]'s themes from ''The Dark World'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', as well as [[Joe Harnell]]'s \"The Lonely Man\" theme from ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' series, are also used in the film.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /> [[Hollywood Records]] released the film's soundtrack digitally on October 20, 2017, and physically on November 10, 2017.<ref name=\"SoundtrackRelease\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nAt the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], a physical model of Hulk's gladiator armor was revealed,<ref name=\"HulkArmor\" /> concept art and rough animatics were shown,<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> and a \"[[mockumentary]]\" short titled ''[[Team Thor]]'' was screened.
