The film stars<!-- Order per billing block and main-on-end credits --> [[Tom Bateman (actor)|Tom Bateman]], Branagh, [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Judi Dench]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Josh Gad]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Leslie Odom Jr.]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and [[Daisy Ridley]],<!-- Do not add \"ensemble cast\", as the film has a clear protagonist --> with Branagh portraying [[Hercule Poirot]]. The film is the fourth screen adaptation of Christie's novel, following the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|1974 film]], [[Murder on the Orient Express (2001 film)|a 2001 TV film]] version, and a 2010 episode of the television series ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/murder-on-the-orient-express-cast-london-1202410262/ |title=All-Star 'Murder on the Orient Express' Cast Assembles in London |first=Robert |last=Mitchell |date=May 5, 2017 |newspaper=Variety}}</ref> The plot follows Poirot, a world-renowned detective, as he investigates a murder on the luxury [[Orient Express]] train service in the 1930s.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in November 2016 in the United Kingdom; it is one of the few productions in recent decades to have used [[65mm film|65&nbsp;mm film]] cameras. ''Murder on the Orient Express'' had its world premiere on November 2, 2017, at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, and was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on November 3, 2017, and in the United States on November 10, 2017, by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/watch-murder-orient-express-world-premiere-red-carpet-livestream-123442643.html |work=[[Yahoo!

A sequel titled ''[[Death on the Nile (2022 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' was released in 2022.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1934, famous Belgian detective [[Hercule Poirot]] solves a theft at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]]<!-- Branagh says in interview (cited elsewhere in article) that he portrays Poirot as obsessive compulsive; so do reviews -->\u2014who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth to be a curse \u2014 wants to rest in [[Istanbul]], but must return to [[London]] for another case. His friend Bouc, director of the [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]]-route [[Orient Express]] service, arranges a bunk for him aboard the train. The other passengers include: American widow Caroline Hubbard, American businessman Edward Ratchett, with his English manservant Edward Masterman and secretary/translator Hector MacQueen; elderly Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Hungarian diplomat Count Rudolf Andrenyi and his wife Elena; physician John Arbuthnot; Mary Debenham, a governess; Pilar Estravados, a Spanish missionary; Cuban-American car salesman Biniamino Marquez; and Gerhard Hardman, an Austrian university professor.\n\nRatchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received threatening letters from an unknown party, but Poirot refuses. That night, Poirot hears strange noises coming from Ratchett's compartment, and later sees someone in a red [[kimono]] running down the hallway. An avalanche derails the train's engine, stranding the passengers.\n\nThe next morning, Poirot discovers Ratchett was murdered during the night after having been stabbed a dozen times. Poirot and Bouc investigate the other passengers as repairs begin. Evidence indicates that Ratchett was murdered by one person, and Mrs Hubbard claims that a man had been in her compartment in the night. Poirot discovers a partially burned note connecting Ratchett to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. Though the family paid the ransom, Daisy was murdered nonetheless. Ratchett's true identity is revealed: he was John Cassetti, Daisy's kidnapper and murderer. The shock of her death caused her mother, Sonia, to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, Colonel John Armstrong, then committed suicide. The family's nursemaid Susanne was wrongly suspected of complicity, leading to her being arrested and subsequent suicide in police custody, only to be posthumously exonerated.\n\nMore evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief, and, in Mrs Hubbard's compartment, the button of a conductor's uniform. The uniform is later found, as is the red kimono \u2014 in Poirot's own suitcase. Hubbard is suddenly stabbed, non-fatally, in the back but cannot identify the culprit. Poirot discovers many of the passengers have direct connections to the Armstrong family and uncovers their hidden pasts. While interviewing Debenham, Poirot is shot in the shoulder by Dr Arbuthnot, who claims responsibility for the murder, but Bouc stops him from killing Poirot. Poirot realises that Arbuthnot, a former army sniper, never meant to kill him.\n\nPoirot confronts the suspects outside the train, offering two theories of how Cassetti died. The first is simple but does not meet all of the facts: a murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train at a previous stop, murdered Cassetti, then fled at the stop as the train left. The second is more complex: with every suspect connected to the Armstrongs, Susanne, or her trial in some way, they all had a motive against Cassetti:\n*MacQueen's father was the [[district attorney]] for the kidnapping case, who was pressured into prosecuting Susanne and sending her to prison, only for his career to be destroyed when the truth was discovered after her suicide\n*Masterman, who is terminally ill, was Colonel Armstrong's [[Batman (military)|batman]] during the [[World War I|war]], and later his valet, who also acted as butler to the Armstrong household\n*Dr Arbuthnot was Colonel Armstrong's comrade and best friend\n*Countess Andrenyi (n\u00e9e Goldenberg and real name Helena) was Sonia Armstrong's sister and Daisy's aunt\n*Count Andrenyi was Sonia's brother-in-law\n*Princess Dragomiroff was Sonia's godmother, and a friend of her mother\n*Ms Debenham was Sonia's secretary and Daisy's governess\n*Schmidt was the Armstrong family's cook\n*Marquez was the Armstrong family's chauffeur\n*Estravados was Daisy's nurse\n*Hardman, whose real name is Cyrus and is American, was a former policeman in love with Susanne\n*Pierre Michel, the train's conductor, was Susanne's brother\n*Hubbard is revealed to be Linda Arden, a former stage actress and aspiring director, as well as Sonia's mother and Daisy's grandmother.\nPoirot predicts that they acted together, which Hubbard confirms, admitting that she planned the murder and had recruited everyone else to help her. All the other passengers and Michel took turns stabbing Cassetti. Debenham wore the kimono, and Arbuthnot stabbed Hubbard without endangering her life, to convince Poirot of a lone killer. Poirot challenges the passengers and Michel to shoot him with a confiscated gun to prevent him from exposing their plot; Bouc can lie, but Poirot, obsessed with truth and balance, cannot. Hubbard grabs the gun and attempts suicide, but it is empty; Poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react.\n\nWith the train back on track, Poirot concludes that justice is impossible in this case, as Cassetti deserved death; for the first time, Poirot will have to live with a lie and imbalance. He presents the lone killer theory to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] police, allowing the others to leave on the train. As he disembarks, a [[British Army]] messenger asks him to investigate a ''[[Death on the Nile (2022 film)|death on the Nile]]''. Poirot accepts the case.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Order per billing block and main-on-end credits -->\n* [[Tom Bateman (actor)|Tom Bateman]] as Bouc, Poirot's friend, and nephew of the owner of the Orient Express.\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Hercule Poirot]], a world-renowned Belgian detective and former police officer.\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Pilar Estravados, the Armstrongs' Spanish nurse.
