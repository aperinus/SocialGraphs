The film was directed by [[Gus Van Sant]] (credited as Gus Van Sant Jr.) and starred an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Uma Thurman]], [[Lorraine Bracco]], [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[John Hurt]], and [[Rain Phoenix]]. Robbins himself was the narrator. The soundtrack was sung entirely by [[k.d. lang]]. The film was dedicated to the late [[River Phoenix]].\n\n==Plot==\nSissy Hankshaw is a woman born with a [[mutation]] (she would not call it a [[birth defect|defect]]) giving her enormously large thumbs. Sissy makes the most of her thumbs by becoming a [[hitchhiker]]. Her travels eventually take her to New York City, where she becomes a model for a homosexual feminine hygiene products mogul, known as \"The Countess\". A few years later, he introduces her to his \"beauty ranch\", the Rubber Rose Ranch. The main plot revolves around the cowgirls who work at the ranch after they violently take over and drug the endangered whooping cranes that nest along the lake on their land, making the once migratory birds stay. The cowgirls end up in a showdown with government agencies because the cranes will not leave the ranch and the cowgirls refuse to allow the men on the ranch to take the cranes. Sissy and the ranch leader, Bonanza Jellybean, have a brief love affair. After a fatal shootout between the cowgirls and the various agencies, the cranes leave, and Sissy takes over running the ranch.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/BrowsHeldHighEvenCowgirlsGetTheBluesHD Brows Held High Even Cowgirls Get the Blues HD-Internet Archive]</ref><ref name=\"Rabin\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Robbins]] (voice) as Narrator\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Sissy Hankshaw\n** Treva Jeffryes as young Sissy\n* [[Lorraine Bracco]] as Delores Del Ruby\n* [[Angie Dickinson]] as Miss Adrian\n* [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]] as The Chink\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Julian Gitche\n* [[John Hurt]] as The Countess\n* [[Rain Phoenix]] as Bonanza Jellybean\n* [[Roseanne Barr|Roseanne Arnold]] as Madame Zoe\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Rupert\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as Howard Barth\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Dr. Dreyfus\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Carla\n* [[Sean Young]] as Marie Barth\n* [[Victoria Williams]] as Cowgirl Debbie\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Mrs. Hankshaw\n* [[Ken Kesey]] as Mr. Hankshaw\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Cowgirl Heather\n* [[Udo Kier]] as Commercial Director\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Rubber Rose Maid\n* [[William S.
