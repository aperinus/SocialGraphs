It stars [[Kevin Costner]] as an escaped convict who takes a young boy ([[T. J. Lowther]]) hostage and attempts to escape on the road with the child. Eastwood co-stars as a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] in pursuit of the convict.\n\nThough the film was not a box-office success in North America and grossed only $31 million for its November 1993 release, it managed to gross $104 million overseas for a total of $135 million worldwide. The film received critical acclaim for its acting (particularly from Kevin Costner), directing, editing, themes, cinematography and musical score. It's also considered by some critics and fans as one of Eastwood's best films.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Phipps |first=Keith |date=22 September 2021 |title=Every Clint Eastwood\u2013Directed Movie, Ranked |url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-clint-eastwood-movies-ranked.html |website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=16 September 2021 |title=Clint Eastwood directed movies: 15 greatest films ranked from worst to best |url=https://www.goldderby.com/gallery/clint-eastwood-directed-movies-15-greatest-films-ranked-from-worst-to-best/ |website=[[Gold Derby]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Orlandini |first=Gino |date=9 December 2021 |title=The 15 Best Clint Eastwood-Directed Movies, Ranked |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/681475/the-best-clint-eastwood-directed-movies-ranked/ |website=[[/Film]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/clint-eastwood-movies-directed-ranked-worst-best/|title = Every Movie Clint Eastwood Has Directed Ranked from Worst to Best|website = [[Screen Rant]]|date = 27 September 2021}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |date=September 13, 2021 |title=12 Best Clint Eastwood Directed Movies |url=https://www.moviefone.com/news/clint-eastwood-best-movies-as-director-ranked-unforgiven/ |website=[[Moviefone]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963 [[Texas]], convicts Robert \"Butch\" Haynes and Terry Pugh escape from the [[Huntsville Unit|state penitentiary in Huntsville]]. Fleeing, Pugh stumbles into a house where eight-year-old Phillip Perry lives with his devout [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] mother and two sisters. Butch follows, and hits Pugh to make him stop molesting the mother. Needing a hostage to aid their escape, Butch grabs the boy, who meekly accompanies them. The trio's journey soon hits an unpleasant note as Butch kills Terry, following the latter's attempt to harm the child. With his partner out of the way, the convict and his young victim take to the Texas highway in an attempt to flee from the pursuing police.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas Ranger Red Garnett is in pursuit. With [[criminologist]] Sally Gerber and [[FBI]] [[marksman|sharpshooter]] Bobby Lee in tow, Red is determined to recover the criminal and the hostage before they cross the Texas border. Also, Red reveals to Sally that he has a personal interest in apprehending Butch alive.  Even though Butch doesn't realize it, Red has a history with him.  When Butch was a teenager, he stole a car, and Red was the arresting officer.  Butch was living with his abusive father, also a criminal, at the time. Due to his age and it being a first offense, Butch was supposed to get a lenient sentence.  Red thought juvenile prison was safer for Butch than home, and muses that some of the kids who went through Gatesville turned out ok, and one even became a priest. He also felt that if Butch had been left at home with his father, he would have a rap sheet \"as long as my arm.\" Red asked the judge to give Butch a harsh sentence. Years later, Red has come to realize that the harsher sentence only encouraged the very life of crime he feared would happen.  Now, Red is hoping that if he can bring Butch in alive, he can redeem himself for his past mistake.\n\nPhillip has never participated in [[Halloween]] or [[Christmas]] celebrations due to his religion. Escaping with Butch, however, he experiences a freedom which he finds exhilarating, as Butch gladly allows him the kind of indulgences he has been forbidden, including the wearing of a shoplifted [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]] costume. Gradually, Phillip becomes increasingly aware of his surroundings, and with constant encouragement from Butch, seems to acquire the ability to make independent decisions on what is wrong and right. Butch slowly finds himself drawn into giving Phillip the kind of fatherly presence which he himself never had.\n\nButch and Phillip try to make it to New Mexico, but find out that the highway they are driving on is unfinished.  While asleep in their car in a cornfield, they encounter Mack, a farmer, and his family - Lottie his wife, and his grandson Cleveland. Mack frequently abuses Cleveland, which Butch tries to tolerate, but when Mack figures out who he is he puts a stop to it. He beats Mack and plans on killing him, but Phillip picks up Butch's gun and shoots Butch in the stomach. Phillip walks out of the house, drops the gun into a well, throws the car keys away, and runs across a meadow. Butch follows, and rests at the tree Phillip has climbed. In the following dialogue Phillip apologizes for shooting Butch who tells him he did the right thing.\n\nRed's team surrounds the field where Phillip and Butch are situated, and Butch soon sends the boy to his mother, who has arrived by helicopter and who Butch has made promise to take Phillip trick-or-treating every year. Unwilling to leave the already wounded Butch, the boy runs back and hugs him \u2013 a gesture which, along with his knowledge of Butch's character and background, convinces Red that he can resolve the situation peacefully. His plans are thwarted, however, when Bobby Lee, mistaking one of Butch's gestures to mean he is about to draw a gun, shoots him in the chest, killing him. The move leaves Red angry and frustrated at his inability to save Butch and take him alive. Red punches Bobby Lee and Sally knees him in the groin before walking away. Phillip is then reunited with his mother, and they fly away in a helicopter while Phillip sadly looks through the window at Butch's lifeless body in the meadow.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Robert \"Butch\" Haynes\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Chief \"Red\" Garnett\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Sally Gerber\n* [[T.
