It begins with meeting the campus party girl, Tracy, who invites her to a frat party. There, Sara also meets musician, Stephen, for whom she feels an immediate attraction. Not realizing that the punch at the party was spiked, Sara gets intoxicated. Upon returning to her dorm room, Sara discovers that her roommate, Rebecca has arrived. The next day, they get to know each other at the campus bookstore. One night, Tracy invites Sarah and Rebecca to go clubbing. Sarah accepts, but Rebecca refuses One, because Rebecca developed an instant dislike of Tracy...Rebecca is unusually conservative for a girl her age, shunning Tracy's attempts to nickname her Becky. Two, she clearly views Tracy as trashy and sluttish. This is further emphasized when Tracy strands her at the nightclub, and has to call Rebecca to come get her at a local diner. The next day, Rebecca takes Sarah to view various art museums. The girls begin to bond and Rebecca learns that Sara had an older sister, Emily, who died when Sara was nine, and an ex-boyfriend, Jason, who keeps calling her in attempts to reconcile. They get even closer when Sara brings home a stray kitten, naming her Cuddles,  even though it's against dorm rules.\n\nOver time, Rebecca's obsession with Sara grows, which causes her to drive away anyone who could come between them. She begins camping outside of Tracy's dorm room, glaring at her malevolently. However, Sara isn't that alarmed when Tracy confronts her with it. Especially when Rebecca blows off what Tracy told Sara  claiming that it was Tracy who freaked HER out by knowing her over to get to the bathroom, sick after a night of partying.  One night, Rebecca ambushes Tracy in the shower room. Claiming that she is a bad influence, Rebecca attacks Tracy in the shower, pins her down, rips out her belly-button ring, and threatens to kill her unless she stays away from Sara. Tracy moves to another dorm, fearful of Rebecca. An old friend of Sara's named Irene invites Sara to move in with her when Sara's cat Cuddles is discovered by an RA. Rebecca kills Cuddles, putting her into a laundromat dryer, lying to Sara that the cat ran away, and inflicts injuries upon herself and says she was assaulted by a thug. Feeling sympathetic, Sara decides to spend Thanksgiving with Rebecca. When Sara's fashion design professor, Roberts, kisses her, Rebecca plans to get the professor out of the picture by seducing him while recording their dialogue on a tape recorder to make it sound like he was trying to rape her.\n\nDuring her Thanksgiving stay, Sara immediately picks up on the tension between Rebecca and her parents. Spending the night with Rebecca in her room, she immediately notices artwork of a beautiful, dark haired girl on her walls. Later, Sara overhears a conversation between Rebecca and her father, hinting Rebecca has had trouble making friends in the past. The next day, Rebecca's mother lets it slip that Rebecca is supposed to be taking medication. Rebecca takes Sara to a local coffee shop that she used to go to everyday. There, Sara has a disturbing encounter with the girl that she recognizes from Rebecca's artwork. She appears to be terrified of Rebecca, immediately bolting outside with her friends. Rebecca brings Sara outside to the girl's table, introducing Sara to her. Named Maria, the girl treats them coldly. As Rebecca and Sara are leaving, Maria walks over to confront Rebecca. In front of Sara, Maria makes it clear to Rebecca that the two of them were never friends. Sara now realizes that in the past, Rebecca most likely had been stalking Maria.\n\nBy now, Sara is beginning to realize that Rebecca was nothing like the person that she initially thought she was. That something was very, very wrong here. Deciding to investigate while Rebecca went out, claiming to go to the art studio, Sara and Stephen find a bottle of unused [[Olanzapine|Zyprexa]] pills. Sara discovers that this is a psychlotropic medication used to treat [[schizophrenia]] or [[bipolar disorder]]. Stephen points out that he doesnt believe Rebecca was ever taking her medication,  reemphasizing the suspicions her mother voiced to Sara. Sara decides to move in with Irene. Unknown to Sara, Rebecca had never gone to the studio as she had claimed. She had been stalking Irene and tracked her down to a local gay bar. She seduces Irene and they go to Irene's apartment. The following morning, Sara goes to Irene's apartment, but she is not there. She returns to the dorm to tell Rebecca that she's moving in with Irene. Before she can, however, Rebecca suddenly tells her that she wants to get a tattoo and wants Sara to come with her. It turns out to be EMILY, the name of Sara's dead sister. She tells Sara to now think of her as Emily. Alarmed, Sara finally realizes Rebecca is obsessed with her and removes her belongings from the dorm. Jason arrives at Sara's dorm and slips a note under her door, saying that he wants to see her. Rebecca intercepts the note, and disguises herself like Sara by dying her hair black. She then goes to Jason's hotel room and stabs him to death.\n\nSara receives a text message from Irene saying she needs to meet with her right away, and she calls Stephen so he can meet her there. She arrives and finds a gagged Irene handcuffed to the bed. Rebecca reveals herself and points a gun at Sara, proclaiming her love and loyalty, before revealing tearfully she was responsible for what happened to Tracy, Cuddles, Professor Roberts, Irene, and Jason, and that she did it all to win Sara's friendship. Rebecca moves to smother Irene, and Sara attempts to stop her. Sara tries to call for help, but the phone is dead. Bound and helpless, Irene pleads for Sara to save herself. Sara tries to get out the window to get help. Rebecca breaks back into the room and aims the gun at the cuffed and helpless Irene, only to be stopped by Stephen who briefly disarms her but is knocked unconscious. Climbing back into the room, Sara is strangled by an enraged Rebecca. Whilst choking, Sara stabs Rebecca with a box cutter, killing her after saying the words \u201cYou were never my friend\u201d.\n\nSara moves back into her dorm and moves the extra bed out of her room with the help of Stephen, proclaiming that she does not want anyone as a roommate for a while.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Leighton Meester]] as Rebecca Evans\n* [[Minka Kelly]] as Sara Matthews\n* [[Cam Gigandet]] as Stephen\n* [[Danneel Ackles|Danneel Harris]] as Irene Crew\n* [[Matt Lanter]] as Jason Tanner\n* [[Nina Dobrev]] as Maria\n* [[Aly Michalka]] as Tracy Long\n* [[Kat Graham]] as Kim Johnson\n* Cherilyn Wilson as Landi Rham\n* [[Billy Zane]] as Professor Roberts\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Alison Evans\n* [[Tomas Arana]] as Jeff Evans\n* [[Alex Meraz]] as Frat boy\n* [[Nathan Parsons]] as Cashier Boy\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nSonny Mallhi first thought of shooting the film in [[New York City]] but it was eventually shot on location at the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles]] and at [[Loyola Marymount University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Roommate \u2013 Production Notes \u2013 On The Dark Side Of The City Of Angels|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=6271|publisher=CinemaReview.com|access-date=August 17, 2013}}</ref>  [[Leighton Meester]] was originally set to play Sara but was replaced by Minka Kelly and Leighton played Rebecca.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/18466|title=First Ever Look at Screen Gems' 'The Roommate', Hi-Res 'Priest' Teaser|website=Bloody Disgusting|date=22 December 2009 |access-date=November 16, 2017}}</ref> [[Billy Zane]] and [[Frances Fisher]] had both starred together in ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' thirteen years earlier, though in this film they shared no scenes.\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 3% based on 86 reviews, with an average rating of 2.86/10.
