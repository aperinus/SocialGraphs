A sequel to ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), it is the third installment in the [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]]. \n\nThe film depicts fictional events during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]. In the film, Rambo sets out on a dangerous journey to [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in order to rescue his former commander and his longtime best friend, Col. Sam Trautman, from the hands of an extremely powerful and ruthless [[Soviet Army]] colonel who is bent on killing both Trautman and Rambo, while helping a local band of Afghan rebels fight against Soviet forces threatening to destroy their village.\n\n''Rambo III'' was released worldwide on May 25, 1988. At the time of its release, ''Rambo III'' was the most expensive film ever made with a production budget between $58 and $63 million. The film was not well received by critics and grossed less than its predecessor, ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', earning $189 million worldwide. \n\nA sequel, ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]],'' was released in 2008 with Stallone reprising his role and also directing the film. \n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nThree years [[Rambo: First Blood Part II|after the events in Vietnam]], [[John Rambo]] has settled in a [[Thailand|Thai]] monastery and is helping with construction work on the monastery grounds. He supports the monastery by competing in [[krabi-krabong]] matches in nearby [[Bangkok]]. [[Colonel Sam Trautman]] visits his old friend and ally Rambo, and explains that he is putting together a mercenary team for a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-sponsored mission to supply the [[Mujahideen]] and other tribes as they try to repel the Soviet Army in [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]. Despite being shown photos of civilians suffering at the hands of the Soviet military, Rambo refuses to join, as he is tired of fighting. Trautman proceeds anyway and is ambushed by enemy forces near the border, resulting in all of his men being killed. Trautman is captured and sent to a large mountain base to be interrogated by Soviet Colonel Zaysen and his henchman Sergeant Kourov.\n\nEmbassy official [[Robert Griggs]] informs Rambo of Col. Trautman's capture but refuses to approve a rescue mission for fear of drawing the United States into the war. Aware that Trautman will die otherwise, Rambo gets permission to undertake a solo rescue on the condition that he will be disavowed in the event of capture or death. Rambo immediately flies to [[Peshawar]], [[Pakistan]], where he intends to convince arms dealer Mousa Ghani to bring him to [[Khost]], the town closest to the Soviet base where Trautman is held captive.\n\nThe Mujahideen in the village, led by chieftain Masoud, hesitate to help Rambo free Trautman. Meanwhile, a Soviet informant in Ghani's employ informs the Soviets, who send two attack helicopters to destroy the village. Though Rambo manages to destroy one of them with a [[DShK]] heavy machine gun, the rebels refuse to aid him any further. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid, Rambo attacks the base and inflicts significant damage before being forced to retreat. Hamid, as well as Rambo, are wounded during the battle and Rambo sends him and Mousa away before resuming his infiltration.\n\nSkillfully evading base security, Rambo reaches and frees Trautman just as he is about to be tortured with a [[flamethrower]]. He and Trautman rescue several other prisoners and hijack a [[Mil Mi-24|Hind]] [[Gunship|gunship helicopter]] to escape the base. The helicopter is damaged during takeoff and quickly crashes, forcing the escapees to flee across the sand on foot. An [[attack helicopter]] pursues Rambo and Trautman to a nearby cave, where Rambo destroys it with an explosive arrow. A furious Zaysen sends [[Spetsnaz]] commandos under Kourov to kill them, but they are quickly routed and killed. An injured Kourov attacks Rambo with his bare hands, but is overcome and killed.\n\nAs Rambo and Trautman make their way to the [[Durand Line|Pakistani border]], Zaysen and his forces surround them. But before the duo are overwhelmed, Masoud's Mujahideen forces attack the Soviets in a surprise cavalry charge. Despite being wounded, Rambo takes control of a tank and uses it to attack Zaysen's Hind gunship in a head-on battle with both vehicles firing high-calibre machine gun rounds, Rambo firing the tank's main gun and Zaysen unleashing volleys of the Hind's high explosive rockets and missiles. The final charge sees the two vehicles collide, but Rambo survives after firing the tank's main gun after colliding with Zaysen's Hind. At the end of the battle, Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to the Mujahideen and leave Afghanistan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rambo characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[John Rambo|John J.

Stallone:\n\n<blockquote>The canvas of this movie is so large you have to constantly think 10 scenes ahead. You can't wing it. They didn't go into the [[Battle of Waterloo]] not knowing what their strategy would be. Well, this movie is kind of like a cinematic warfare. We have a huge cast and crew (more than 250 people) and tough locations to deal with.

These men were {{sic|suppose}} to make your blood run cold. When I arrived on the set, what I saw was two dozen blond, blue-eyed pretty boys that resembled rejects from a surfing contest.

It was MacDonald's first film as director but he was very experienced and had directed the second unit action sequences in ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. MacDonald later said, \"I tried very hard to change the Rambo character a bit and make him a vulnerable and humorous person, I failed totally.\"<ref name=\"peter\">[http://filmint.nu/?p=10089 David Ellis, \"Peter MacDonald: The Man Who Failed to Change Rambo\", ''Film International'' 20 November 2013]</ref> \"I knew instinctively what was a good and bad shot,\" he added. \"Stallone knew his character because it was his third outing as Rambo.

MacDonald:\n\n<blockquote>There were so many restrictions in Israel, where you could and couldn't shoot. The producers and Stallone decided they would go back to Arizona where they had looked long before I was on the film. There was a group there called the re-enactors.

Between 1988 and 1990, the project was in development at Carolco Pictures, with [[Joel Silver]] attached as a producer and [[William Friedkin]] as a director. [[Cynthia Rothrock]] was also cast as partner of Stallone's Mack Bolan character, and she would play more of a \"calm and cool headed\" character, while Stallone would be more of a \"unpredictable wildcard\". At least several different scripts were written by screenwriters who wrote some of the more popular action films at the time, like [[Hilary Henkin]], who wrote ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]]'' (1989), [[Edward Neumeier]] and Michael Miner, who wrote ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), and even Stallone wrote a version of the script. However, due to his dislike of the scripts and problems he had with Stallone and Silver about it, Friedkin left the project which was cancelled soon after.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=May 15, 1988 |title=Rambo Lets His Guns Do the Talking in Sequel |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/rambo-lets-his-guns-do-the-talking-in-sequel |access-date=September 6, 2022 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-06-05-ca-6383-story.html |title=No News Is No News |first=Pat H. |last=Broeske |date=June 5, 1988 |quote=But hey--isn't Sly's next up \"The Executioner\" going to kick off the UA deal?
