It was directed by [[Pitof]] and written by [[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]], [[John Brancato and Michael Ferris]] from a story by [[Theresa Rebeck]], Brancato and Ferris, with music by [[Klaus Badelt]]. The film stars [[Halle Berry]] as Catwoman, plus [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Lambert Wilson]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Alex Borstein]], and [[Sharon Stone]] in supporting roles. The film centers on Patience Phillips, a meek designer who discovers a conspiracy within the cosmetics company she works for that involves a dangerous product that could cause widespread health problems. After being discovered and murdered by the conspirators, she is revived by Egyptian cats that grant her superhuman cat-like abilities, allowing her to become the crime-fighting [[superhero]]ine Catwoman, while also romancing a detective who pursues her.\n\nProduced by [[Village Roadshow Pictures]] and [[Denise Di Novi]]'s Di Novi Pictures, ''Catwoman'' was released theatrically on July 23, 2004 by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[box-office bomb|performed poorly at the box office]], grossing $82 million against a budget of $100 million. The film received seven [[25th Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] nominations and won in the categories of [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]], [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay|Worst Screenplay]]; the film was panned by critics and many considered it to be one of [[List of films considered the worst#Catwoman (2004)|the worst films of all time]], with criticism directed at the performances, direction, CGI, editing, costume design, pacing, plot, dialogue and unfaithfulness to the source material, which includes the lack of connection to Batman.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lowerison|first=Jean|title='Catwoman' The cat and the Bratt|url=http://sandiegometro.archives.whsites.net/reel/index.php?reelID=713|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724130824/http://sandiegometro.archives.whsites.net/reel/index.php?reelID=713|archive-date=July 24, 2011|access-date=2011-01-17|publisher=San Diego Metropolitan|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Janet|date=July 20, 2004|title=Me-Ouch|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2004/07/20/me-ouch/|url-status=live|access-date=February 6, 2021|publisher=Village Voice|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915163513/https://www.villagevoice.com/2004/07/20/me-ouch/ |archive-date=September 15, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nArtist Patience Phillips is a meek people-pleaser whose main support is her best friend Sally. She works for a [[cosmetics]] company called Hedare Beauty, which is ready to ship a new skin cream called Beau-line that is able to reverse the effects of aging. However, when Patience visits the [[Research and development|R&D]] laboratory facility to deliver a redone ad design, she overhears a discussion between scientist Dr. Ivan Slavicky and Laurel Hedare, the wife of company-owner George Hedare, about the dangerous [[side effect]]s from continually using the product. Laurel's guards discover Patience and are ordered to dispose of her. Patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush her out of it, drowning her. Washed up on shore, Patience is mysteriously revived by an [[Egyptian Mau]] cat named Midnight which had appeared at her apartment earlier; from that moment on, she develops cat-like attributes.\n\nFrom Midnight's owner eccentric researcher Ophelia Powers, Patience learns that Egyptian Mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess [[Bastet|Bast]]. Patience realizes that she is now a \"catwoman\", [[Dying-and-rising god|reborn]] with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. Disguised as a mysterious vigilante, named [[Catwoman]] to hide her identity, Patience under cover of darkness, searches for answers as to who killed her and why. Eventually, her search (which includes finding Slavicky's body and later being accused of his murder) leads her to Laurel. She asks Laurel to keep an eye on George, to which Laurel agrees. However, when Patience confronts George (who is attending an opera with another woman) as Catwoman, he reveals that he knows nothing about the side effects. The police led by Patience's love interest, detective Tom Lone, arrive and Catwoman escapes. Later on, Laurel murders George for his infidelity and admits to having Dr. Slavicky killed because he wanted to cancel the product's release. She contacts Catwoman and frames her for the murder. Tom then takes Catwoman into custody. Laurel plans to release Beau-line to the public the following day.\n\nPatience slips out of her cell and confronts Laurel in her office, rescuing Tom; who came to question Laurel after second thoughts about Patience's guilt in the process and revealing that Laurel is the one responsible for her death. Laurel reveals the product's side effects; discontinuing its use makes the skin disintegrate, while continuing its use makes the skin as hard as marble. During the fight, she scratches Laurel's face several times, causing Laurel to fall out of a window and grab onto a pipe. Laurel sees her face in a window's reflection, and horrified by her skin's rapid disintegration (as a result of the scratches and her own use of Beau-line for years), she fails to grab hold of Patience's outstretched arm and falls to her death.\n\nAlthough Patience is cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of Dr. Slavicky and the Hedares, she decides to end things with Tom by choosing to continue living outside the law and enjoying her newfound freedom as the mysterious Catwoman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Catwoman|Patience Phillips / Catwoman]]\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Detective Tom Lone\n* [[Sharon Stone]] as Laurel Hedare\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as George Hedare\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Ophelia Powers\n* [[Alex Borstein]] as Sally\n* [[Michael Massee]] as Armando\n* [[Byron Mann]] as Wesley\n* Alex Cooper as Gloria Ojeda\n* [[Kim Smith (model)|Kim Smith]] as Drina\n* [[Peter Wingfield]] as Dr. Ivan Slavicky\n* Berend McKenzie as Lance\n{{div col end}}\n[[Missy Peregrym]] appears uncredited as the Hedare factory computer monitor image (Beau-line graphics model), depicting the bad effects of the beauty product.{{Cn|date=November 2022}} A photograph of [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Selina Kyle (1989 film series character)|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' are among the pictures that Ophelia shows to Patience of former Catwomen.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWith [[Warner Bros.]] developing ''[[Batman Forever]]'' in June 1993, a ''Catwoman'' spin-off film was announced.
