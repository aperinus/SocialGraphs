It is a [[remake]] of the [[Dark Water (2002 film)|2002 Japanese film of the same name]], which was inspired by the short story \"[[Dark Water (book)|Floating Water]]\" by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]], who also wrote the [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|''Ring'' trilogy]]. The film stars [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], [[Perla Haney-Jardine]], [[Dougray Scott]] and [[Ariel Gade]].\n\n''Dark Water'' was released on July 8, 2005, and grossed $44\u201349&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\" /><ref name=numbers/> It is a co-production between the United States and Japan.<ref name=afi/>\n\n==Plot==\nDahlia battles her ex-husband Kyle for custody of their daughter Cecilia, a five-year-old kindergartener. Kyle wants Cecilia to live closer to his apartment in [[Jersey City]], but Dahlia wants to move to the cheaper [[Roosevelt Island]], where she has found a good school.\n\nDahlia and Cecilia view an apartment in a dilapidated complex on Roosevelt Island, a few blocks from Cecilia's new school. Cecilia sneaks to the roof and finds a [[Hello Kitty]] backpack near the building's [[water tower]]; the manager, Cory Murray, explains that no one has claimed it. Cecilia initially dislikes the apartment but decides she wants to live there. Dahlia makes an offer the same day.\n\nShortly after they move in, the bedroom ceiling begins to leak dark water. Dahlia finds the apartment above flooded from every faucet. She finds a family portrait of the former tenants, the Rimsky family: a mother, father, and a girl who is Cecilia's age. Dahlia complains to Murray and the superintendent Veeck about the water, but Veeck insists that he is not a plumber and blames teenage vandals. The ceiling, shoddily patched by Veeck, leaks again. Dahlia is intimidated by teenagers in the apartment, and sees the face of a screaming girl in a washing machine. This isn't helped by a recurring nightmare she has, seeing the girl's mother warning her not to tell the police what she's done to her own daughter or else she will harm Cecilia.\n\nCecilia's teacher is troubled by Cecilia's \"imaginary friend\" named Natasha. Cecilia appears to argue with her before losing control of her hand while painting. After Dahlia catches Cecilia playing with dolls and talking to Natasha in the elevator, she forbids Cecilia to talk to Natasha again. In the bathroom, Cecilia passes out as dark water gushes from the toilets and sinks. As Dahlia is busy meeting her lawyer, Jeff Platzer, Kyle takes Cecilia to his apartment. Dahlia feels some form of relief knowing that Kyle will keep her safe.\n\nThat night, Dahlia follows footsteps to the roof and sees that water is spilling from the water tower. Inside she finds Natasha's body and calls the police, horrified. Veeck is arrested for negligence as he was aware of her body. This was why he refused to fix the complex's plumbing problems, and he is taken away. Veeck kept claiming that Natasha's parents paid him money to keep quiet about their willful abandonment of their daughter and lie for them that she was with either of them. Dahlia and Platzer discover that Natasha's parents had cruelly abandoned her. In turn, they also conclude that Natasha was left to fend for herself. She fell into the water tower and drowned, leaving her as a vengeful ghost who is jealous of Cecilia because she has Dahlia as her mother.\n\nDahlia agrees to move closer to Kyle so that shared custody will be easier. As she packs, a girl in a hooded bathrobe who resembles Cecilia asks her to read to her. When Dahlia hears Cecilia playing in the bathtub, she realizes that the girl is Natasha. Natasha begs Dahlia not to leave but Dahlia rushes into the bathroom to save Cecilia. Natasha locks Cecilia in the shower compartment and holds her underwater. Dahlia pleads with Natasha to let her daughter go, promising to be her mother forever. Floods overwhelm the apartment which drowns Dahlia, and Natasha and the ghost of Dahlia walk the hall as mother and daughter.\n\nThree weeks later, Kyle (now given full custody over his daughter following Dahlia's death) and Cecilia pick up the rest of their belongings in Dahlia's apartment. In the elevator, Dahlia's ghost braids Cecilia's hair, telling her she will always be with her. The film ends with Kyle and Cecilia leaving for Kyle's apartment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Dahlia Williams\n** [[Perla Haney-Jardine]] as young Dahlia Williams / Natasha Rimsky\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Kyle Williams\n* [[John C.

Screenwriter Rafael Yglesias ([[Fearless (1993 film)|Fearless]]) stays alert to the psychological fears that underpin the supernatural doings in the apartment upstairs. Connelly digs deep into the role of a woman with issues of abandonment and rage that slowly reveal their roots. In a movie with more subtext than ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary\u2019s Baby]]'', nearly everyone, including Tim Roth as Dahlia\u2019s lawyer, harbors secrets.
