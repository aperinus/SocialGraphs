Although it takes the name of [[The Bourne Supremacy|the second Bourne novel]] (1986), its plot is entirely different. The film was directed by [[Paul Greengrass]] from a screenplay by [[Tony Gilroy]].  It is the second installment in the [[Bourne (film series)|''Jason Bourne'' film series]]. It is preceded by ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'' (2002) and followed by ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007), ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' (2012), and ''[[Jason Bourne (film)|Jason Bourne]]'' (2016).\n\n''The Bourne Supremacy'' continues the story of [[Jason Bourne]], a former [[CIA]] assassin suffering from [[psychogenic amnesia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/jason-bourne-takes-his-case-to-moma/78614 |title=Jason Bourne Takes His Case to MoMA |author=Bennett, Bruce |date=2008-05-28 |work=NYSun.com |access-date=2009-09-10}}</ref> Bourne is portrayed by [[Matt Damon]]. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy involving the CIA and Operation Treadstone. The film also stars [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Ward Abbott, [[Joan Allen]] as Pamela Landy, and [[Julia Stiles]] as Nicky Parsons.\n\n[[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] released the film to theaters in the United States on July 23, 2004, to positive reviews and commercial success, grossing $290 million on a $75 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jason Bourne]] and Marie Kreutz are living in [[Goa]], India. Bourne, who is still suffering from amnesia, records flashbacks about his life as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] assassin in a notebook.\n\nIn Berlin, a CIA agent working for [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Pamela Landy is paying $3 million to an unnamed Russian source for the Neski files, documents on the theft of $20 million seven years prior. The deal is interrupted by Kirill, a Russian [[Federal Security Service]] agent who works for oligarch Yuri Gretkov. He kills the agent and source, steals the files and money, and plants fingerprints framing Bourne for the attack.\n\nAfter finding Bourne's fingerprint, Landy asks Section Chief Ward Abbott about [[Jason Bourne#Operation Treadstone|Operation Treadstone]], the defunct CIA program to which Bourne belonged. She tells Abbott that the CIA agent who stole the $20 million was named in the Neski files. Some years previously, Russian politician Vladimir Neski was about to identify the thief when he was killed by his wife in a suspected murder-suicide in Berlin. Landy believes that Bourne and Treadstone's late supervisor, Alexander Conklin, were involved and that Bourne killed the Neskis. Abbott and Landy go to Berlin to capture Bourne.\n\nGretkov directs Kirill to Goa to kill Bourne. Bourne flees with Marie; Kirill follows and kills Marie, but believes he has killed Bourne. Bourne leaves Goa and travels to Naples, where he allows himself to be identified by security. He subdues a [[Diplomatic Security]] agent and a [[Carabinieri]] guard and [[Phone cloning|copies the SIM card]] from his cell phone. From the subsequent phone call, he learns about Landy and the frame job.\n\nBourne goes to Munich to visit Jarda, the only other remaining Treadstone operative. Jarda informs Bourne that Treadstone was shut down after Conklin's death, and attacks him; Bourne strangles Jarda to death, before destroying his home in a gas explosion as agents move in. Bourne follows Landy and Abbott as they meet former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons to question her about Bourne. Bourne believes the CIA is hunting him again and calls Landy from a nearby roof. He demands a meet-up with Nicky and indicates to Landy that he can see her in the office.\n\nBourne kidnaps Nicky in [[Alexanderplatz]] and learns from her that Abbott had been Conklin's boss. Bourne spares Nicky after she reveals she knows nothing about the mission. Bourne then visits the hotel where the killing took place and recalls more of his mission\u2014he killed Neski on Conklin's orders, and when Neski's wife showed up, he shot her and made it look like a murder-suicide.\n\nDanny Zorn, Conklin's former assistant, finds inconsistencies with the report of Bourne's involvement with the death of the agent, and explains his theory to Abbott. Abbott kills Zorn to prevent him from informing Landy. Bourne breaks into Abbott's hotel room and records a conversation between him and Gretkov that incriminates them in the theft of the $20 million. Abbott admits to Bourne that he stole the money, ordered Kirill to retrieve the files, and had Bourne framed before arranging for him to be silenced in Goa. Abbott expects Bourne to kill him, but Bourne refuses\u2014believing Marie would not want him to kill Abbott\u2014though he leaves his gun on the table. After Bourne leaves, Landy confronts Abbott about her suspicions and he kills himself. Landy returns to her hotel room, finding an envelope containing the tape of Abbott's conversations with Gretkov and Bourne.\n\nBourne travels to Moscow to find Neski's daughter, Irena. Kirill, tasked once again by Gretkov with killing Bourne, finds and wounds him. Bourne flees in a stolen taxi and Kirill chases him. Bourne forces Kirill's vehicle into an accident, and leaves behind a seriously<!-- review Talk page before changing --> wounded Kirill. Gretkov is arrested. Bourne locates Irena and confesses to murdering her parents, apologizing to her as he leaves.\n\nLater in New York, Bourne calls Landy; she thanks him for the tape, reveals to him his original name, David Webb, and his date and place of birth, and asks him to meet her. Bourne says, \"Get some rest, Pam. You look tired.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Jason Bourne (character)|Jason Bourne]]: An amnesiac and former assassin of the CIA's Operation Treadstone\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Pamela Landy: Deputy Director and Task Force Chief, pursues Bourne after her operation goes badly\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Ward Abbott: CIA Section Chief, who was formerly in charge of [[Jason Bourne#Operation Treadstone|Treadstone]]\n* [[Franka Potente]] as Marie Helena Kreutz: Bourne's girlfriend\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Nicolette \"Nicky\" Parsons: A former agent who is taken from her post-Treadstone assignment to assist in the search for Bourne\n* [[Karl Urban]] as Kirill: A Russian [[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|Federal Security Service]] agent and an expert assassin who is working for Gretkov\n* [[Karel Roden]] as Yuri Gretkov: Kirill's employer\n* [[Gabriel Mann]] as Danny Zorn: Formerly assigned to Treadstone headquarters, is now on Abbott's staff\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as Jarda: A Czech former Treadstone operative based out of [[Munich]]\n* [[Tomas Arana]] as Martin Marshall: CIA Director\n* [[Tom Gallop]] as Tom Cronin: Landy's righthand agent\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Kim: Landy's number two agent\n* [[Oksana Akinshina]] as Irena Neski: Daughter of politician Vladimir Neski, whom Bourne killed\n\n==Production==\nThere were no plans to make a sequel to ''The Bourne Identity'' (2002) when it was conceived.  Matt Damon commented, \"When ''The Bourne Identity'' came out I said, 'There is very little chance we will do a second film, just because nobody on the team who made the first wants to make another movie if it can't be as good as, or better than, the first one.{{' \"}} According to producer [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], the plot for the sequel was not only based on the novel ''[[The Bourne Supremacy]]''  but also on Bourne's threat in the first film to come after the CIA if it targeted him.  Producer Paul L. Sandberg felt that screenwriter [[Tony Gilroy]]'s deviating so much from the book was necessary \"because so much of the world has changed\" since 1986, when the sequel was first published.  Marshall said that Gilroy thought of an idea that Bourne \"would go on what amounts to the samurai's journey, this journey of atonement.\"\n\nThe producers replaced [[Doug Liman]], who directed ''The Bourne Identity''.  This was mainly due to the difficulties Liman had with the studio when making the first film, and their unwillingness to work with him again.  British director [[Paul Greengrass]] was selected to direct the film after the producers saw ''[[Bloody Sunday (film)|Bloody Sunday]]'' (2002), Greengrass' depiction of the [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday shootings]] in Northern Ireland, at Gilroy's suggestion.  Producer Patrick Crowley liked Greengrass' \"sense of the camera as participatory viewer\", a visual style Crowley thought would work well for ''The Bourne Supremacy''.<ref>\"Picking Up the Thread\".
