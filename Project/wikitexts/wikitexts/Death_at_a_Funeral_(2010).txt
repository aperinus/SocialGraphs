It is a remake of  the 2007 British film [[Death at a Funeral (2007 film)|of the same name]] that Craig wrote. The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Chris Rock]], [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Regina Hall]], [[Peter Dinklage]], [[James Marsden]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Loretta Devine]], [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a]], [[Columbus Short]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Keith David]], [[Ron Glass]] and [[Kevin Hart]]; Dinklage is the only actor to appear in  both films. The film was released in the United States on April 16, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nA funeral service is held for the father of Aaron and Ryan. Aaron, the older son, and his wife Michelle live at his parents' home. Aaron and Michelle have been trying to buy their own home and have children but have been unsuccessful. Aaron envies his brother because Ryan is a successful author, while Aaron has not yet had his novel published, and resents him because Ryan would rather spend money on a first class airline ticket than help him pay for the funeral expenses.\n\nAaron and Ryan's cousin Elaine and her fianc\u00e9 Oscar are on their way to pick up Elaine's brother Jeff before heading to the funeral. To ease Oscar's nerves, she gives him a pill from a bottle labeled as [[Valium]]. Jeff later reveals to Elaine that it is a powerful [[hallucinogenic]] drug he has concocted for a friend. Chaos ensues when Oscar hallucinates that the coffin is moving. He knocks it over, and the body falls out of the coffin.\n\nAaron is approached by an unknown guest named Frank, who reveals himself to be the secret lover of his late father. Frank shows Aaron photos as proof and threatens to reveal them to Aaron and Ryan's mother Cynthia unless he is paid $30,000. While in shock, Aaron relays the situation to Ryan, who suggests Aaron to pay the money because Ryan claims that he is in debt. When Aaron and Ryan meet with Frank to pay him, Frank starts to deride Aaron's ability as a writer and Aaron refuses to pay. Frank turns violent, but Aaron and Ryan subdue him, tying him up to prevent him from leaving. Family friend Norman enters the room, giving Frank several doses of what he also believes is Valium to try to calm him down. Jeff also enters the room, telling them that it is the same hallucinogen Oscar took earlier.\n\nWhen Jeff and Norman, who are supposed to be watching Frank, get distracted by Uncle Russell, Frank releases himself from his bonds and is knocked unconscious upon falling over and hitting his head on a table. With Aaron, Ryan, Jeff and Norman believing that Frank is dead, they plan to put him in the coffin. While everyone is outside watching Oscar, who is on the roof naked and threatening to jump off the roof because he has seen Elaine's ex-boyfriend Derek kissing her, Aaron and Ryan put Frank in the coffin. Elaine tells Oscar that Derek forcibly kissed her and calms him down by revealing she is pregnant. With everyone back inside, they continue the eulogy. While Aaron awkwardly tries to give his speech, Frank starts banging on the coffin, then suddenly forces it open and emerges. The pictures fall out of Frank's pocket, while Cynthia sees the pictures and screams at Frank, attacking him. Aaron yells for everyone's attention as he delivers a moving and impromptu eulogy, saying that his father was a good man with flaws like everyone else.\n\nAaron and Ryan say goodbye while Ryan gets a ride to the airport from Martina, whom he had been trying to seduce all day. Aaron and Michelle are finally alone when Aaron asks where Uncle Russell is. Michelle tells him that she gave him what she believes is Valium to calm him down, shocking Aaron. Uncle Russell sits on the roof naked, like Oscar had been, complaining about how \"everything is so green.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keith David]] as Reverend Davis\n* [[Loretta Devine]] as Cynthia, Aaron and Ryan's mother.\n* [[Peter Dinklage]] as Frank, the main antagonist, the lover of Aaron and Ryan's father.\n* [[Ron Glass]] as Duncan, Jeff and Elaine's father, and Edward's brother.\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Uncle Russell, the short-tempered great-uncle of Aaron, Ryan, Elaine and Jeff.\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Michelle, Aaron's wife.\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Brian\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Ryan, Aaron's selfish younger brother and a successful author.\n* [[James Marsden]] as Oscar, Elaine's fianc\u00e9.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Norman, a friend of the Barnes family.\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Aaron, a novelist and the main protagonist.\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a]]<!-- as credited, with her full diacritics --> as Elaine, Aaron and Ryan's cousin.\n* [[Columbus Short]] as Jeff, Elaine's brother.\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Derek, Elaine's ex-boyfriend and Norman's best friend.\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 43% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 5.00/10.
