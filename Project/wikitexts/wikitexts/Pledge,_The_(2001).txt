The film features an [[ensemble cast]], starring [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Aaron Eckhart]], [[Helen Mirren]], [[Robin Wright|Robin Wright Penn]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Tom Noonan]], [[Lois Smith]] and [[Benicio del Toro]]. It was in competition at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n''The Pledge'' is based on [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s 1958 [[novella]] ''[[The Pledge: Requiem for the Detective Novel]]''. D\u00fcrrenmatt wrote the novella to refine the theme he originally developed in the screenplay for the 1958 German film ''[[It Happened in Broad Daylight]]'' with [[Heinz R\u00fchmann]].\n\n==Plot==\nAging [[Reno, Nevada]] police detective Jerry Black attends a retirement party hosted by his department, at which Captain Pollack presents Jerry tickets to a fishing trip in Mexico as a gift. The celebration is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny Larsen. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak, to the scene of the crime.\n\nJerry delivers the bad news to Ginny's parents, and the mother, Margaret Larsen, makes Jerry swear on a [[Christian cross|cross]], made by their daughter, that he will find the killer. A suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] man with an [[intellectual disability]], is found the next day. Stan uses Toby's disorder to his advantage, convincing him that he killed Ginny. After having confessed to doing so, Toby steals a deputy's gun and commits suicide. An autopsy on Ginny proves that she had consumed chocolate before she died; wrappers found in Toby's truck solidify the likelihood that he killed the little girl, and the case is closed, despite Jerry\u2019s suspicions.\n\nStill adamant about his pledge to find the killer, Jerry chooses not to go to Mexico and misses his flight. Instead, he visits Ginny's grandmother, Annalise Hansen, who tells him of the many stories that she and Ginny used to read; one tells of an [[angel]] who descends from [[Heaven]] in order to fly a deceased child over all the places they loved in life, before delivering them to [[God]]. Jerry then visits one of Ginny's friends, Becky Fiske, who reveals that she had made friends with a man she called \"The Giant\" shortly before she was killed. Jerry finds a picture Ginny drew of \"The Giant\", but it does not resemble Toby, and features a black station wagon and not the red truck driven by Toby. He takes the drawing with him.\n\nJerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three local, unsolved cases that bear the same [[Modus operandi|M.O.]] as seen with Ginny's, and which Toby could not have possibly committed because he was incarcerated at the time. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack and Stan, who are doubtful.\n\nWhile fishing, Jerry notices a gas station that is located near the center of the cases. After buying the station, Jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender Lori, and her daughter, Chrissy. He takes an interest in Chrissy and becomes friends with the small family. One night, Lori shows up at Jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains that her ex (who has a restraining order) attacked her. Jerry, out of concern for their safety, suggests that Lori and Chrissy move in with him temporarily; she agrees. Jerry slowly develops a fatherly relationship with Chrissy, and even begins a romance with Lori herself.\n\nOne day, local pastor Gary Jackson visits Chrissy outside the station. Jerry suspects that Jackson is Ginny's killer after he invites Chrissy to his church. Jerry rushes to the church after Jackson picks her up one day while he was fishing, but finds it was nothing more than a close call, and that Jackson is not the killer.\n\nMeanwhile, Chrissy begins meeting with a man who drives a black car with a toy [[porcupine]] hanging on the rear mirror; porcupines were another aspect of Ginny's drawing that have set Jerry off. At night, while reading her a bed-time story, Chrissy tells Jerry that she met a \"wizard\" who gave her porcupine candies and told her not to tell her parents of their correspondence. Chrissy alerts Jerry to a meeting that will happen between her and the \"wizard\" the next day. Using Chrissy as bait, Jerry stages an operation with Stan's help to catch the killer. However, as they await his arrival, the \"wizard\" dies in a car accident; hours later, Stan gives up and tells Lori what happened. She confronts Jerry angrily about putting Chrissy in danger, and breaks up with him.\n\nSome time later, Jerry sits alone on a bench in front of the ruined gas station. Despondent, destitute, and drunk, Jerry ends up all alone, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there, unaware that he is actually dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Jerry Black\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Margaret Larsen\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Toby Jay Wadenah\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Stan Krolak\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as Doctor\n* [[Tom Noonan]] as Gary Jackson\n* [[Robin Wright|Robin Wright Penn]] as Lori\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Annalise Hansen\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Jim Olstad\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Eric Pollack\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Floyd Cage\n* [[Dale Dickey]] as Strom\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as Monash Deputy\n* [[Michael O'Keefe]] as Duane Larsen\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Helen Jackson\n* [[Brittany Tiplady]] as Becky Fiske\n* [[Eileen Ryan]] as Jean}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot mainly on location in the [[British Columbia]] interior. While the opening scenes were filmed in [[Reno, Nevada]], the rest of the film was shot in [[Keremeos]], [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], [[Hedley, British Columbia|Hedley]], [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]] and [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]], all in British Columbia. Tom Noonan recounts that, when ''Battlefield Earth'' flopped, the film's backers \"were so freaked out... that they got on Sean [Penn] about finishing on time and finishing under budget, which wasn't really possible, because they were shooting in the mountains, and there were four or five scenes that I still had to shoot, which they never shot, which explain who I am in that film. Because I'm not the guy who killed the kids. I'm not the bad guy in the film.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://film.avclub.com/tom-noonan-1798218359 | title=Tom Noonan | date=November 20, 2009 }}</ref> He has repeated this assertion: \"There's another guy who's in a Mercedes that gets burned at the end.
