The disease caused permanent hearing loss and temporary [[vocal cord paresis]] which became permanent after unsuccessful surgery. Hoping to advance her writing career following her publication of the novel ''[[Midnight Mass (miniseries)|Midnight Mass]]'' and receiving international critical acclaim, Maddie leaves [[New York City]] and lives an isolated life in the woods with her cat. Her friend Sarah visits her one evening to return a copy of her book. Later that night, a masked killer with a [[crossbow]] attacks Sarah and chases her to Maddie's house. A bloodied Sarah bangs on the door shouting for help; she goes unnoticed by Maddie and the killer stabs Sarah to death.\n\nThe killer quickly deduces that Maddie is deaf and decides to try and make her another victim. He sneaks into her house and steals her phone, which he then uses to take pictures of her and send them to her. Maddie realizes she is being [[stalking|stalked]] and tries to call the police, but the killer cuts the power and punctures the tires on her car to prevent escape. Maddie writes \"won't tell, didn't see face, boyfriend coming home\" on the glass panel door with her lipstick. The killer responds by taking off his mask and revealing his face and\u2014upon learning she can [[lip reading|read lips]]\u2014taunts her with the threat of waiting to break in. He then uses Sarah's corpse to knock on the window. Maddie uses her car keys to trigger her car alarm in an attempt to distract the killer so she can retrieve Sarah's phone from her corpse\u2019s pocket, but is caught by him before she can grab it and quickly locks herself back inside.\n\nWhile attempting to escape through the second-story window, Maddie is shot in the leg by the killer with a crossbow bolt, but she manages to knock him off the roof and steal the weapon. Sarah's boyfriend, John, arrives at Maddie's house looking for Sarah. The killer poses as a police officer responding to a call, but John grows suspicious of him. He plans to attack the killer from behind with a rock, but Maddie distracts him by banging on the window, allowing the killer to stab him in the neck. As John bleeds to death, he puts the killer in a [[chokehold]] to buy Maddie enough time to escape, but she realizes that she will either be caught or bleed to death. Her only chance for survival is to kill her assailant.\n\nOutside, the killer threatens Maddie's cat with his knife, but she shoots him in the shoulder with the crossbow. As Maddie retreats into the house, the killer slams the sliding door on her wrist and crushes her hand beneath his boot. He allows Maddie to pull her mangled hand inside and close and lock the door. When he threatens to enter the house, Maddie writes \"do it, coward\" on the door with her own blood. As the killer begins bashing the door in with a tire iron, Maddie uses her laptop to type up a description of the man and a message to her family. She then locks herself in her bathroom, armed with a knife.\n\nFailing to break through the door, the killer opts to crash through the bathroom skylight. Maddie does not notice him until he inadvertently breathes against her neck. She narrowly avoids his attack and stabs him in the knee. He follows her into the kitchen, where she blasts his face with [[insecticide]] and uses her visual smoke alarm to disorient him. He begins strangling her, but she finally kills him when she stabs him in the neck with a [[corkscrew]]. Maddie retrieves her cell phone from the man's body and dials [[9-1-1]]. As she sits on her porch steps while the police approach her, Maddie pets her cat and smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--CHARACTER NAMES PER CLOSING CREDITS-->\n* [[Kate Siegel]] as Madison \"Maddie\" Young\n*[[John Gallagher Jr.]] as The Man\n* [[Michael Trucco]] as John Stanley\n* [[Samantha Sloyan]] as Sarah Greene\n* Emma Graves as Max, Maddie's sister\n\n==Production==\nNothing was known about the project until September 2015, when its existence was revealed at a buyers' screening at the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/09/hush-buyer-screening-leaves-buyers-buzzing-toronto-1201522328/|title=Hush' Buyer Screening Leaves Buyers Buzzing: Toronto|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Mike Jr.|last=Fleming|date=September 11, 2015|access-date=March 11, 2016}}</ref> It was disclosed that [[Mike Flanagan (filmmaker)|Mike Flanagan]] had directed the film, and co-wrote it with his wife Kate Siegel, who also stars in it.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2015/09/toronto-2015-mike-flanagans-secret-project-hush-creates-buzz-at-buyers-screening.html|title=Toronto 2015: Mike Flanagan's 'Secret Project' HUSH Creates Buzz At Buyers Screening|publisher=TwitchFilm.com|first=Andrew|last=Mack|date=September 12, 2015|access-date=March 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016001900/http://twitchfilm.com/2015/09/toronto-2015-mike-flanagans-secret-project-hush-creates-buzz-at-buyers-screening.html|archive-date=October 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFlanagan said that he made the main character a [[deaf mute]] because he wanted to direct a film \"without dialogue.\"<ref name=\"Bloodydisgustinghush\">{{cite web|last1=Thurman|first1=Trace|title=[Interview] 'Hush' Director Mike Flanagan and Actress Kate Siegel On Their New Thriller!|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3384092/interview-hush-mike-flanagan-kate-siegel/|website=Bloody Disgusting|date=7 April 2016|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref> The possibility of making the film entirely silent was briefly considered, but was soon abandoned when Flanagan had decided that building tension with this limitation would be \"impossible.\"<ref name=\"Bloodydisgustinghush\"/> Flanagan also noted that the target audience would not have been used to [[silent films]] and, as such, would \"seek out every kind of audio stimulus anywhere else in the environment\" or simply choose to not watch the film.<ref name=\"Bloodydisgustinghush\"/>\n\nThe script itself consisted largely of scene directions, which Flanagan and Siegel developed by acting out in their own house.<ref name=\"buzzfeed\">{{cite web|last1=Peitzman|first1=Lous|title=Meet The Filmmaker Who Wants To Save Horror From Jump Scares|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/meet-the-filmmaker-who-wants-to-save-horror-from-cheap-scare|website=Buzzfeed|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref> The fact that so much of the script was based around Flanagan and Siegel's house proved problematic for filming, as when they went to shoot the film in Alabama, they could not find a house similar enough to theirs and had to significantly alter the film's script.<ref name=\"ADRbreath\">{{cite web|last1=Gingold|first1=Michael|title=Q&A: \"HUSH\" Director Mike Flanagan on the Scary Sounds of Silence|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-hush-director-mike-flanagan-on-the-scary-sounds-of-silence/|website=Fangoria|access-date=8 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202011513/http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-hush-director-mike-flanagan-on-the-scary-sounds-of-silence/|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Flanagan also found challenges in the single location and had to plan the cinematography to keep the film interesting to the audience, especially given the mute nature of the protagonist; to this end, Flanagan used a [[Steadicam]] to follow Siegel's every move, along with a boom mic and a spotter, to make the movement more \"dynamic.\"<ref name=\"ADRbreath\"/> The resulting audio for these scenes could not be used and had to be redone in post, with Flanagan noting that the audio initially \"sounded like a herd of elephants.\"<ref name=\"ADRbreath\"/>\n\nTo represent Maddie's world, various [[Ambience (sound recording)|ambient]] sounds were used, such as the sound of [[Ultrasound|ultrasound machines]].
