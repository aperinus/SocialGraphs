It is the tenth film in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, as well as the fourth and final film to star the cast of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. It was written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] from a story developed by Logan, [[Brent Spiner]], and producer [[Rick Berman]]. In the film, which is set in the 24th century, the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]] are forced to deal with a threat to the [[United Federation of Planets]] from a clone of Captain Picard named [[Shinzon]], who has taken control of the [[Romulan|Romulan Star Empire]] in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place from November 2001 to March 2002. ''Nemesis'' held its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on December 9, 2002. The film was released in North America on December 13, 2002 by [[Paramount Pictures]], and received generally mixed reviews, with publications criticizing it for being the least successful in the franchise. The film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office failure]], earning $67 million worldwide against a $60 million budget. Plans for a final film featuring ''The Next Generation'' cast were scrapped, and the film series was rebooted instead with ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' in 2009, which was a box office success. The television series ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', a continuation of ''The Next Generation'' and ''Nemesis'' set two decades after the latter at the end of the [[24th century]], premiered in 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Romulus, members of the [[Romulan]] Senate debate terms of peace and alliance from the Reman rebel leader Shinzon. The Remans are a slave race of the Romulan Empire from the neighboring planet Remus, used as miners and cannon fodder. While a faction of the military supports Shinzon, the Praetor and Senate are opposed to an alliance. After rejecting the motion, the Praetor and senators are disintegrated by a device left in the room.\n\nMeanwhile, the crew of the Starship ''Enterprise'' prepare to bid farewell to newly-married officers [[William Riker]] and [[Deanna Troi]]. The android officer Data serenades the couple with a rendition of \"[[Blue Skies (Irving Berlin song)|Blue Skies]]\" at a reception. En route to the ceremony, they discover an energy reading on the planet Kolarus III near the Romulan Neutral Zone. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, security officer Worf, and Data land on the planet and discover the remnants of an android resembling Data, named B-4. The trio are attacked by the native population, and leave the planet with B-4, which they deduce to be an earlier version of Data.\n\n''Enterprise'' is ordered on a diplomatic mission to Romulus, where Shinzon has taken over the Empire and professes a desire for peace with the Federation. On arrival, they learn Shinzon is a clone of Picard, secretly created by the Romulans to plant a high-ranking spy into the Federation. The project was abandoned when Shinzon was still a child, and he was left on Remus to die as a slave. After many years, Shinzon became a leader of the Remans, and constructed a heavily armed flagship, ''Scimitar''. The ''Enterprise'' crew discover that ''Scimitar'' is producing low levels of deadly thalaron radiation. There are also unexpected attempts to communicate with the ''Enterprise'' computers, and Shinzon invades Troi's mind through the telepathy of his Reman viceroy.\n\nDoctor Beverly Crusher discovers that Shinzon is aging rapidly because of the process used to clone him, and the only possible treatment is a transfusion of Picard's blood. Shinzon kidnaps Picard and B-4, having planted the android on Kolarus as a lure. Data reveals he swapped places with B-4, and rescues Picard. They determine Shinzon plans to use ''Scimitar'' to invade the Federation, using its thalaron radiation generator to eradicate all life on Earth.\n\n''Enterprise'' races back to Federation space, but is ambushed by ''Scimitar''. Despite the aid of two Romulan Warbirds, ''Enterprise'' is heavily damaged. Picard rams his ship into ''Scimitar'', crippling both vessels. Shinzon activates the thalaron weapon in an act of [[mutually assured destruction]]. Picard boards ''Scimitar'' alone to face Shinzon, and kills him by impaling him on a metal strut. With ''Enterprise''{{'}}s transporters damaged, Data leaps the distance between the two ships equipped with an emergency transporter, beaming Picard off the ship, and sacrifices himself to destroy the thalaron generator and ''Scimitar'' with it. The crew mourn Data, and the surviving Romulan commander, Donatra, offers them her gratitude for saving the Empire.\n\nBack at Earth, Picard bids farewell to Riker, who is leaving to command the USS ''Titan''. Picard meets with B-4, and discovers that, before he boarded the Scimitar, Data downloaded his memories into B-4, allowing him to live on. As B-4 starts singing \"Blue Skies\", Picard leaves B-4's quarters and smiles.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]]\n* [[Jonathan Frakes]] as Commander / Captain [[William Riker|William T.

Baird specifically wanted an unknown actor, and Hardy auditioned by tape after Stewart asked Hardy's agent if he thought any of his clients were suitable for the role. Hardy was filming ''Simon: An English Legionnaire'' in Morocco at the time,<ref name=\"haydock-2012\" />{{rp|37}} and decided against using the requested text for the audition. Instead, he got possession of a full script for ''Nemesis'', used a different part of the script, and filmed it partly nude.<ref name=\"haydock-2012\" />{{rp|38}} He was flown to Los Angeles to do a screen test with Stewart; Hardy later described his performance there as \"appalling\". However, he had recorded himself performing the same piece in a hotel room the night before, and gave that tape to Baird, resulting in his being cast as Shinzon a few days later.<ref name=\"haydock-2012\" />{{rp|39}}\n\nSirtis was \"ecstatic\" about the role Troi plays in the movie.<ref name=\"bride\">{{cite magazine |last=Spelling |first=Ian |date=January 2003 |title=Bride of the Stars |url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-306/306#page/n25/mode/1up |magazine=Starlog |volume=1 |issue=306 |pages=23\u201326 |access-date=May 15, 2015}}</ref> She was pleased with the wedding scene, saying that the dress she wore for ''Nemesis'' was nicer than the one she wore at her actual wedding. She was happy to work once again with [[Wil Wheaton]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]], but felt that the film would be the last one with the entire cast of ''The Next Generation''. She remained certain that it would not be the last ''Star Trek'' film to be made, as she thought that Paramount would want to make a film involving a variety of characters from the different ''Star Trek'' series.<ref name=\"bride\" />\n\nPerlman and Hardy became friends on the set. Perlman said in an interview eight years after the release of the film, \"I loved him when I first met him. I loved working with him.

Baird did not have a background in ''Star Trek''; he was aware of the films and television series but did not consider himself an expert on the subject.<ref name=\"action\" /> Berman explained that Baird would bring \"fresh blood\" to the film and that Berman had enjoyed \"the sense of fun and action that existed in ''Executive Decision''.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=The Long Trek|journal=Starlog|date=November 2001|volume=1|issue=292|pages=67\u201369|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-292/292#page/n68/mode/1up|access-date=May 15, 2015}}</ref> Baird said in a promotional interview that this resulted in a non-typical Baird film, saying that it was \"perhaps a little different from the dynamics of the previous films.\"<ref name=action/> He wanted to add energy to the action scenes and added some set pieces, such as the car chase. He called that scene a \"signature piece\" for the film, which turns dark after the crew is put in danger by the inhabitants of the planet.<ref name=action/> He also found that the cast would discuss any issues they had with the direction he gave to their characters. Despite Frakes' being in the cast and having directed the previous two ''Star Trek'' films, Baird decided not to seek his opinion on the direction of the film. He said that there was no resentment on set, noting that Frakes was completing work on directing ''[[Clockstoppers]]'' at the time and so likely could not have taken on directing ''Nemesis'' even if Baird had not been given the job. Baird had hoped that ''Nemesis'' would be enough of a success that he could consider whether to take the lead on a future, eleventh ''Star Trek'' film.<ref name=action>{{cite magazine |last=Spelling|first=Ian|title=Galactic Action|magazine =Starlog|date=February 2003|volume=1|issue=307|pages=46\u201350|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-307/307#page/n45/mode/2up|access-date=May 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Make-up===\nThe make-up team sought to make Hardy look more similar to Stewart by creating latex prosthetics from moulds of the latter's face. These included numerous versions of noses and chins, and in order to reduce the visible size of Hardy's lips a fake scar was added.<ref name=\"haydock-2012\"/>{{rp|41}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Star Trek: Nemesis (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe music to ''Star Trek: Nemesis'' was composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who composed previous entries in the franchise, such as the [[Academy Award]]-nominated score for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'', as well as the themes to the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (arranged by [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]]) and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. One of the final works written before his death in 2004, Goldsmith had also previously collaborated with Baird on ''[[Executive Decision]]'' and ''[[U.S. Marshals (film)|U.S. Marshals]]''.\n\nThe score opens with airy synthesizers under a trumpet performing an [[augmented triad]] before preceding into [[Alexander Courage]]'s ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' fanfare. The score then quickly transitions into a much darker theme to accompany the conflict between the [[Romulan#Remus|Reman]] and [[Romulan]] empires. Goldsmith also composed a new 5-note theme to accompany the character [[Shinzon]] and the ''Scimitar'', which is manipulated throughout the score to reflect the multiple dimensions of the character. The score is book-ended with Goldsmith's theme from ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', following a brief excerpt from the song \"[[Blue Skies (Irving Berlin song)|Blue Skies]]\" by [[Irving Berlin]] and the original ''Star Trek'' fanfare.<ref name=\"Filmtracks\">{{Cite web | last = Clemmensen |first= Christian |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/star_trek10.html |title=''Star Trek Nemesis'' soundtrack review | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122180515/http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/star_trek10.html |archive-date=January 22, 2011 |work=[[Filmtracks.com]] |url-status=live |access-date=April 1, 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\n''Nemesis'' had comparatively little marketing, despite releasing so long after the previous film.
