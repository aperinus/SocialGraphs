The film stars [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Julia Roberts]], with [[Dean Norris]], [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]], [[Joe Cole (actor)|Joe Cole]] and [[Alfred Molina]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was released by [[STXfilms]] on November 20, 2015. It received mixed reception from critics, who praised its performances but compared it unfavorably to the original.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2002, shortly after [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], Ray Kasten, a [[counterterrorism]] agent for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and his friend Jessica \"Jess\" Cobb, an investigator for the [[Los Angeles]] [[district attorney]]'s office, meet new [[District attorney|ADA]] Claire Sloan. Jess and Ray receive a call about an unknown female body found in a dumpster near a local [[mosque]], which Ray has been investigating for possible terrorist links. At the crime scene, both are devastated to discover that the victim is Jess's 18-year-old daughter, Carolyn, whose body has been bleached inside and out to destroy DNA evidence of both rape and murder.\n\nRay, who was supposed to meet Carolyn to plan a surprise party for Jess, feels responsible for what happened to her, while Jess feels the increasing need to move out of the city. While helping Jess pack, Ray notices pictures from a picnic thrown for law enforcement in which a young man is seen staring at Carolyn. Ray scans the photo and matches it to Anzor Marzin, who is an [[informant]] in the terrorism probe. DA Martin Morales is reluctant to go after Marzin, fearing it would compromise the terrorism investigation. Officer Reggie Siefert brings in a suspect named Aban Ghazala, who Ray realizes is not the killer.\n\nRay forces Siefert to admit that he set up Ghazala as a [[patsy]] to protect Marzin. Ray and Detective Bumpy Willis track down and arrest Marzin at [[Dodger Stadium]]. Claire argues with Ray over his methods while seemingly defending Marzin, saying he wasn't capable of the crime. Claire taunts Marzin, provoking him to [[indecent exposure|expose himself]] and punch her, saying he's going to give Claire what Carolyn got. Ray beats Marzin, which leads to Morales ordering Marzin released. As Marzin gloats, an enraged Ray suggests they kill him before he gets away, but Jess refuses to go that route, saying death would be too easy on him. After his release, the police find Marzin's van, but Siefert burns it to destroy the evidence against Marzin.\n\nThirteen years later, Ray, now head of security for the [[New York Mets]], returns to Los Angeles and reunites with Claire, now the DA, while Jess, who has been asocial since the loss of her daughter, is Claire's top investigator. Ray has found a man named Clay Beckwith, who he believes is Marzin living under an alias. The investigation eventually leads to a shootout with Beckwith in which Siefert is killed. Beckwith and his men are arrested, but Jess insists that Beckwith is not Marzin.\n\nWhen Ray and Claire pay a visit to Jess's isolated farmhouse, she confesses that she found and killed Marzin thirteen years previously, shortly after Ray left Los Angeles. Later, Ray follows Jess into her barn and discovers that Marzin is actually alive, having been imprisoned in a cage for over a decade. Marzin begs Ray to ask Jess to talk to him. Ray pulls out his gun and leaves it with Jess as he goes outside and starts digging a grave. Ray hears Jess shooting Marzin. The two meet each other with a sense of relief while Claire officially closes Carolyn's case.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as Raymond \"Ray\" Kasten\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Claire Sloan\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Jessica \"Jess\" Cobb\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Bumpy Willis\n* [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]] as Reginald \"Reg\" Siefert\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Martin Morales\n* Zoe Graham as Carolyn Cobb\n* [[Lyndon Smith]] as Kit\n* [[Joe Cole (actor)|Joe Cole]] as Anzor Marzin / Clay Beckwith\n* [[Donald Patrick Harvey]] as Fierro\n* [[Mark Famiglietti]] as Duty Sergeant Jacobs\n* [[Ross Partridge]] as Ellis\n\n==Production==\nOn January 20, 2015, [[STX Entertainment]] acquired the US rights to the film.
