The film is set during [[World War II]] and concerns a group of Italian soldiers who become stranded on a [[Greece|Greek]] island in the [[Aegean Sea]], and are left behind by the war. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1992.<ref name=\"Oscars1992\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1992 |title=The 64th Academy Awards (1992) Nominees and Winners |access-date=15 September 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1941, one year after [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] joined [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] against the Allies in [[World War II]], a small group of misfit Italian soldiers is sent to a small Greek island in the [[Aegean Sea]] for four months of lookout duty. The soldiers include a lieutenant who likes art, a macho sergeant, a ski instructor accompanied by his beloved donkey Silvana, and other quirky people. They are not very good soldiers, but a cross section of average, independent men, who like the Greeks (and the occasional visiting Turk), are Mediterraneans, who greatly resemble the locals in appearance and culture\u2014a catchphrase \"One face, one race\" occurs throughout the film.\n\nThe soldiers anticipate attack from outside and on the island, and take all sorts of inept precautions. They find a small town with no people. That night, they see bombing on the horizon and by radio interception, discover that the ship that was intended to pick them up has been destroyed. Mysteriously, people reappear in the village: the villagers say they hid because the Germans had taken all the men, but having seen that the Italians are absolutely harmless they have decided to return to their lives. It's not long before everyone's sunny nature appears. The Italian soldiers, unacquainted with a war they clearly do not sense as theirs, are absorbed into the life, heat and landscape of the idyllic island.\n\nThe local [[Greek Orthodox Church|orthodox]] priest asks the lieutenant, an amateur painter, to restore the murals in his church. Two soldiers, who are brothers, befriend a lovely young woman, a shepherdess. They eventually consummate their friendship with the shepherdess who in turn loves them both equally. Sergeant Lo Russo, the only member of the crew with a fiery spirit for war, takes up folk dancing and begins to reflect on his place in the universe. Meanwhile, the shyest soldier, Farina, falls in love with the island's prostitute, named Vasilissa{{refn|group=note|''Vasilissa'' is the Greek word for ''queen''.}}.\n\nIn their old age, three of the men are reunited on the island<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE0D9153DF931A15750C0A964958260 Mediterraneo (1991).

The script and the novel show marked differences in how they portray the Italian army in Greece, with the novel giving a more realistic account.<ref>Saverio Giovacchini, ''Soccer with the Dead: Mediterraneo and the Myth of Italiani Brava Gente,'' in Repicturing the Second World War, ed.

Nevertheless, the victory of the Academy Award raised some eyebrows, with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' describing the movie as a \"schmaltzy island fantasy\", and the ''[[Film Journal International|Film Journal]]'' calling it a \"clich\u00e9d number\".<ref>Saverio Giovacchini, ''Soccer with the Dead: Mediterraneo and the Myth of Italiani Brava Gente,'' in Repicturing the Second World War, ed. Michael Paris (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008), p. 55-69</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] stated that this was the only film he ever walked out of because it was \"utterly without redeeming merit\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Watson|first=Bret|title=Siskel and Ebert answer 10 Stupid Questions|date=17 May 1996|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://ew.com/article/1996/05/17/siskel-and-ebert-answer-10-stupid-questions/|access-date=1 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAmong historians the movie was discussed as a prime example of the myth of ''[[Italiani brava gente]]'', the popular Italian belief that Italian soldiers were not complicit in [[Italian war crimes|war crimes]] and had distinguished themselves through humanity and compassion during World War II \u2014 in stark contrast to their ideologically motivated and brutal German allies. The movie fails to give any reference to the atrocities committed by Italians during the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], while portraying [[Royal Italian Army]] soldiers as essentially good-natured people, if not cute, innocent buffoons. While in reality the burning of villages, the shooting of civilians and rapes were common features of the Italian occupation, the film goes so far as to show Italian aggressors happily mingling with the locals and even establishing consensual erotic relationships with Greek women.<ref>Saverio Giovacchini, ''Soccer with the Dead: Mediterraneo and the Myth of Italiani Brava Gente'' in Repicturing the Second World War, ed.
