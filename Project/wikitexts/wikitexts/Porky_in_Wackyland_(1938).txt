Upon landing his airplane in Darkest Africa, Porky sees a sign telling him that he is in Wackyland, where anything can happen. He tiptoes along the ground in his airplane and is greeted by a roaring beast, who suddenly becomes effeminate and dances away into the forest.\n\nA musical interlude introduces several more bizarre creatures that inhabit Wackyland's impossible landscape. These include a [[one-man band]] that plays its nose like a flute, a rabbit swinging in midair, a duck caricature of [[Al Jolson]], and a beast with the heads of the [[Three Stooges]]. One creature wears a [[sandwich board]] advertising information about the do-do. The creature beckons Porky into a dark passage, where he falls down a chute and watches the do-do's big entrance. The do-do introduces itself and then tramples Porky while [[scat singing]]. Porky gives chase, but the do-do repeatedly uses surreal tricks to escape and humiliate him.\n\nSome time later, the do-do encounters a creature selling newspapers announcing that Porky's hunt has been a success. Shocked by the news, the do-do drops its guard long enough for the creature (Porky in disguise) to grab it. Porky briefly celebrates catching the last do-do, but is bested again when the bird calls for its other do-do friends.\n\n== Voice cast ==\nInformation is taken from the website ''Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie''<ref name=\"Merrie Looney\"/>\n*[[Mel Blanc]] as various characters, including [[Porky Pig]] and [[Dodo]]\n*[[Billy Bletcher]] as the Roaring Goon\n*[[Tedd Pierce]] as mysterious voice\n*[[Danny Webb (American actor)|Dave Weber]] as the Prisoner\n*[[Bob Clampett]] as vocal effects\n\n== Reception ==\nSteve Schneider's 1998 ''That's All Folks!

Animation |date=1988 |publisher=Henry Holt and Co |isbn=0-8050-0889-6 |page=60}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2001 ''Masters of Animation'', John Grant writes that \"this short, in its cumulative effect, is more wildly inventive than anything even [[Tex Avery|[Tex] Avery]] had produced for Warners.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=John |title=Masters of Animation |date=2001 |publisher=Watson-Guptill |isbn=978-0823030415 |page=55 |url=https://archive.org/details/mastersofanimati00gran_0?q=%22porky+in+wackyland%22 |accessdate=23 July 2020}}</ref>\n\nAnimation historian Steve Schneider writes, \"No mere Looney Tune, ''Porky in Wackyland'' was Warner Bros.

A color remake of ''Porky in Wackyland'' was supervised by [[Friz Freleng]] in 1948. Re-titled as ''[[Dough for the Do-Do]]'', the remake was released in 1949. The films were nearly identical, in many cases appearing to match frame-by-frame in certain details, albeit with Porky's appearance updated (by redoing most of the animation of the character), the voices having evolved (with less use of speeding-up) and the backgrounds being changed to a surreal, Daliesque landscape. \n''Dough for the Do-Do'' was produced in [[Technicolor]], but was originally released in [[Cinecolor]] due to a dispute with the Technicolor corporation. Later reissues were printed by Technicolor.\n\nThere were at least two [[Terrytoons]] plagiarizations of ''Porky in Wackyland'' in the 1940s or 50's. ''[[Dingbat Land]]'' (1949)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classiccartoons.blogspot.com/2006/04/rare-and-unknown-dingbat-land.html|title=Classic Cartoons|work=classiccartoons.blogspot.com}}</ref> starred Gandy Goose and Sourpuss. The role of the Do-Do was taken by a minor Terrytoons character, Dingbat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animationarchive.org/pics/terrylc08-big.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311194421/http://www.animationarchive.org/pics/terrylc08-big.jpg |archivedate=2007-03-11 }}</ref> The second film, a more direct plagiarization of the Porky Pig/Do-Do cartoons, starred a British hunter and a Do-Do stand-in. The creature didn't talk, but made strange hooting noises, and flung flames from a tuft of hair on top of its head.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n[[Tex Avery]], for whom Clampett worked as an animator in the mid-1930s, borrowed strongly from this cartoon for his 1948 MGM cartoons ''Half-Pint Pygmy'' (in which the characters, George and Junior, travel to Africa in search of the world's smallest pygmy, only to discover that he has an uncle who's even smaller) and ''[[The Cat that Hated People|The Cat That Hated People]]'' (where the cat travels to the moon and encounters an array of characters similar to those in Clampett's Wackyland, e.g., a pair of gloves and lips that keep saying \"Mammy, mammy\", just like the Al Jolson duck in ''Porky in Wackyland''). Clampett would again use the Three Stooges parody when a later creation of his, [[Beany and Cecil]], faced the \"Dreaded Three-Headed Threep\".\n\nAccording to writer [[Paul Dini]], the Do-Do Bird is the father of [[Gogo Dodo]], a character on the 1990s animated TV series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', and a second Wackyland is drawn into Acme acres by Babs and Buster Bunny.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} A small clip from the film was used in a [[Slappy Squirrel]] segment on another Warners animated TV series of the 1990s, ''[[Animaniacs]]''. The segment, titled \"Critical Condition\", featured ''Porky in Wackyland'' as part of a fake [[LaserDisc]] release. The Do-Do Bird has made occasional guest spots in the [[DC Comics]] ''Looney Tunes'' comic book, being colored in [[grayscale]] as opposed to the rest of the art being in color. The character makes an appearance in the [[Wii]] game ''[[Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal]]'' as an unplayable character. He is given a first name, Yoyo Dodo. Yoyo can also be seen at Maroon Cartoon Studios as a brief cameo in the beginning of the 1988 film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. Yoyo also made a cameo in the 2020 ''[[Looney Tunes Cartoons]]'' short \"Happy Birthday, Bugs Bunny!\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1929\u20131939)]]\n* [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1940\u20131949)]]\n* [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection]] ''Porky in Wackyland'' on Volume 2 (Disc 3) and ''Dough for the Do-Do'' on Volume 1 (Disc 2)\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0030604}}\n* {{bcdb title|339|Porky in Wackyland}}\n\n[[Category:1938 films]]\n[[Category:1938 animated films]]\n[[Category:1938 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bob Clampett]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes shorts]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:1930s American animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Porky Pig films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling]]\n[[Category:Animated films about animals]]\n[[Category:Films about pigs]]\n[[Category:Dodo]]"}]}}}}
