The movie was produced by Robert Simond, directed by Rob Pritts, and was written by [[David Garrett (screen writer)|David Garrett]] and Jason Ward. In the movie, Kattan plays the title character, a [[veterinarian]] who is forced by his [[mobster]] family to infiltrate the local [[FBI]] facility to steal evidence incriminating his father, [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] boss Francis A. \"Pops\" Romano ([[Peter Falk]]), of [[racketeering]] charges. It opened in theaters on October 12, 2001.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Veterinary technician]] Corky Romano ([[Chris Kattan]]), banished from his family after the death of his mother, is unaware of their criminal connections until he receives a call from his father \"Pops\" ([[Peter Falk]]), a Mafia crime lord. [[Indicted]] on [[racketeering]] charges and knowing the strong case against him, Pops has concluded the only solution is to destroy the FBI\u2019s evidence.\n\nAt the family mansion, a bedridden Pops convinces Corky to infiltrate the local FBI office, since the Romano family cannot send anyone with known underworld connections, such as Corky's brothers Paulie ([[Peter Berg]]) and Peter ([[Chris Penn]]). With the aid of a computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], Corky obtains a false identity, \u201cAgent Corky Pissant\u201d and gains access to the building, where he discovers from office chief Howard Schuster ([[Richard Roundtree]]) that, according to his falsified r\u00e9sum\u00e9, \"Pissant\" graduated from [[Harvard]], speaks five different languages, is an expert [[sharpshooter]], and has extensive martial arts training.\n\nCorky makes several trips to the evidence room, only to be sidetracked each time. He is sent on investigations and raids, with several assignments tied to the Night Vulture, a [[heroin]] trafficker who is number six on the FBI's Most Wanted List. Corky's frequent mistakes often inadvertently solve the problem at hand, leading others at the FBI to assume Corky has developed intricate strategies. He receives praise at the office and in the local media, though Agent Brick Davis ([[Matthew Glave]]) remains jealous and suspicious.\n\nCorky develops feelings for FBI agent Kate Russo ([[Vinessa Shaw]]), but she seems uninterested until they bump into each other at the Romano mansion, where Russo has been sent undercover to collect more evidence against the family. Corky convinces Russo that he is also working undercover, and befriends agents Bob Cox ([[Roger Fan]]) and Terrence Darnell ([[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]]). Cox and Darnell are captured trying to infiltrate one of Pops' underground [[casino]]s. Corky comes to the rescue, but is caught by the bouncers; revealed to be a member of the Romano family, he asks them to let his friends go.\n\nCorky obtains the evidence file regarding Pops, and discovers that his father will be facing [[murder]] charges. Shocked, he tells Pops, who vehemently denies killing anyone. Snooping through family photo albums, Russo discovers that Corky is a Romano and not an FBI agent. The entire FBI office raids the Romano mansion, where it is revealed that family friend Leo Corrigan ([[Fred Ward]]) is an FBI informant and has been lying about the extent of the family's crimes, including the alleged murder; it is also discovered that Brick Davis is the Night Vulture. Corky knocks Leo unconscious with a light fixture, and Davis is arrested by his fellow agents.\n\nCorky and Russo marry and drive off in Corky's bright yellow [[Mazda Miata]]. Corky gains the respect and love of his entire family, and his former boss at the veterinary clinic retires, giving Corky the keys to the business.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chris Kattan]] as Corky Romano/Agent Pissant\n*[[Vinessa Shaw]] as Agent Kate Russo\n*[[Peter Falk]] as Francis A. \"Pops\" Romano\n*[[Peter Berg]] as Paulie Romano\n*[[Chris Penn]] as Peter Romano\n*[[Fred Ward]] as Leo Corrigan\n*[[Matthew Glave]] as Agent Brick Davis\n*[[Richard Roundtree]] as Howard Shuster\n*[[Roger Fan]] as Agent Bob Cox\n*[[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Agent Terrence Darnell\n*[[Michael Massee]] as Angry Gunman\n*[[Vincent Pastore]] as Tony\n*[[Zach Galifianakis]] as Computer Hacker Dexter\n*[[Sable (wrestler)|Rena Mero]] as Female Bouncer\n\n==Production==\nIn his 2019 autobiography ''Baby Don't Hurt Me'', Chris Kattan claimed that [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] (writer-director of ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'') and [[Richard LaGravenese]] (screenwriter of ''[[The Fisher King]]'') each assisted with rewriting the script for ''Corky Romano'', for which they received no official credit.<ref name=\"hurt\">''Baby Don't Hurt Me: Stories and Scars from Saturday Night Live'' by Chris Kattan.</ref>\n\nThe nickname \"Corky\" is alleged to be taken from real life [[New Jersey]] mobster [[Gaetano Vastola (gangster)|Gaetano Vastola]] whose nickname among the mafia ranks as a street soldier was \"Corky\". Gaetano is also believed to have been the model for the fictional character in ''[[The Sopranos]]'', [[Hesh Rabkin]] (played by [[Jerry Adler]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Corky Romano'' was panned by critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds a 7% rating based on 83 reviews with the consensus stating: \"''Corky Romano'' continues the trend of bad movies featuring SNL members. The jokes are tired and unfunny, and the slapstick feels forced.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Corky Romano |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/corky_romano |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref>\n\n[[James Berardinelli]] rated the film half a star out of four, stating: \"It only takes about three minutes of running time to realize that you have wasted your money. The question is whether you have the stamina to endure all 80 minutes. 'I survived Corky' tee-shirts should be given out to everyone who stays until the end credits roll and can provide proof that they didn't take the easy way out of napping.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Corky Romano |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/c/corky.html |work=[[ReelViews]] |access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] also rated the film half a star out of four stars, calling it \"a desperately unfunny gangster spoof\" and wrote: \"The concept is exhausted, the ideas are tired, the physical gags are routine, the story is labored, the actors look like they can barely contain their doubts about the project.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Corky Romano |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/corky-romano-2001 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=October 12, 2001 |access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref> Miles Beller was one of the few critics who gave a positive review, saying: \"Although ''Corky Romano'' contains its share of witless wisecracks and puerile pranks, it achieves something more than the current crop of would-be funny films.
