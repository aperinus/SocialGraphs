It is based on a chapter from [[Lillian Hellman]]'s 1973 book ''[[Pentimento (book)|Pentimento]]'' about the author's relationship with a lifelong friend, Julia, who fought against the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in the years prior to [[World War II]].  The film stars [[Jane Fonda]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Jason Robards]], [[Hal Holbrook]], [[Rosemary Murphy]], [[Maximilian Schell]] and [[Meryl Streep]] (in her film debut).\n\n''Julia'' was released theatrically on October 2, 1977 by [[20th Century Fox]]. Upon release the film received generally positive reviews and grossed $20.7 million against its $7 million budget. It received a leading 11 nominations at the [[50th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won 3 awards, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (for Robards), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Redgrave) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. \nAt the [[35th Golden Globe Awards]] it received a leading six nominations, including for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], with Fonda and Redgrave winning for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]] respectively. The film also received a leading ten nominations at the [[32nd British Academy Film Awards]] and won four, including for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe young [[Lillian Hellman]] and her friend Julia, daughter of a wealthy family being brought up by her grandparents in the United States, enjoy a childhood together and an extremely close relationship in late adolescence. Later, while medical student/physician Julia attends [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and the [[University of Vienna]] and studies with such luminaries as [[Sigmund Freud]],  Lillian, a struggling writer, suffers through revisions of her play with her mentor and sometime lover, famed author [[Dashiell Hammett]], at a beach house.\n\nJulia's school in Vienna is overrun by Nazi thugs, and Julia is severely injured trying to protect her colleagues.  Lillian receives word of Julia's condition and rushes to Vienna to be with her.  Julia is taken away for \"treatment\", and Lillian is unable to find her again since the hospital denies any knowledge of her being treated there.  She remains in Europe to try to find Julia again but is unsuccessful.\n\nLater, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]], Lillian has become a celebrated playwright and is invited to a writers' conference in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Julia, having taken on the battle against [[Nazism]], enlists Lillian ''en route'' to smuggle money into Nazi Germany to assist the [[anti-Nazi]] cause. It is a dangerous mission, especially for a Jewish intellectual on her way to Russia.\n\nLillian departs for the USSR via Berlin, and the movements of her person, and placement of her possessions (a hat and a box of candy), are carefully guided by compatriots of Julia through border crossings and inspections. In Berlin, Lillian is told to go to a cafe where she finds Julia. They are able to speak only briefly. Julia divulges that the \"treatment\" she received in the hospital in Vienna was the amputation of her leg.  Julia tells her that the money she has brought will save 500 to 1,000 people, many of them Jews. Lillian also learns that Julia has a daughter, Lily, who is living with a baker in [[Alsace]]. After Lilian leaves Julia in the cafe and boards the train to Moscow, a man tells her to avoid passing through Germany again after she leaves the USSR.\n\nWhen Lillian reaches London, she receives word that Julia has been killed in the Frankfurt apartment of a friend by Nazi agents although the details of her death are shrouded in secrecy. Lillian unsuccessfully looks for Julia's daughter in Alsace. She returns to the United States and is reunited with Dashiell Hammett.  She is haunted by her memories of Julia and is distraught over not having found Julia's baby.  She is shocked that Julia's family pretends not to remember Lillian, clearly wanting to excise from their memory a granddaughter who refused to conform at a time when conformity caused the murder of many innocent people.\n\nThe film ends with an image of Lillian Hellman seated in a boat alone, fishing.  She reveals in voiceover that she continued to live with Hammett for another thirty years and outlived him by several more.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as [[Lillian Hellman|Lillian]]\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Julia\n* [[Jason Robards]] as [[Dashiell Hammett|Hammett]]\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as Alan\n* [[Rosemary Murphy]] as [[Dorothy Parker|Dottie]]\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Johann\n* [[Dora Doll]] as Woman Passenger\n* Elisabeth Mortensen as Girl Passenger\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Anne Marie\n* [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] as Sammy\n* [[Lisa Pelikan]] as Young Julia\n* Susan Jones as Young Lillian\n* [[Maurice Denham]] as Undertaker\n* [[G\u00e9rard Buhr|Gerard Buhr]] as Passport Officer\n* [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] as Grandmother\n* [[Lambert Wilson]]\n}}\n\nThe film marked the film debut of [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Lisa Pelikan]].\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in England and France. Although [[Lillian Hellman]] claimed the story was based on true events that occurred early in her life, the filmmakers later came to believe that most of it was fictionalized. Director [[Fred Zinnemann]] would later comment, \"Lillian Hellman in her own mind owned half the Spanish Civil War, while [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] owned the other half. She would portray herself in situations that were not true. An extremely talented, brilliant writer, but she was a phony character, I'm sorry to say.

On June 30, 1976, as the film was going into production, Hellman wrote about the screenplay to its producer:<ref>Austenfeld, ''American Women Writers'', pp. 102-03</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|This is not a work of fiction and certain laws have to be followed for that reason ... Your major difficulty to me is the treatment of Lillian as the leading character. The reason is simple: no matter what she does in this story\u2013and I do not deny the danger I was in when I took the money into Germany\u2013my role was passive. And nobody and nothing can change that unless you write a fictional and different story ... Isn't it necessary to know that I am a Jew? That, of course, is what mainly made the danger.}}\n\nIn a 1979 television interview with Dick Cavett, author [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], long Hellman's political adversary and the object of her negative literary judgment, said of Hellman that \"every word she writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'.\"<ref name=\"martinson354\"/> Hellman responded by filing a US$2,500,000 defamation suit against McCarthy, interviewer [[Dick Cavett]], and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].<ref name=\"martinson354\">Martinson, ''Lillian Hellman'', pp. 354\u201356</ref> McCarthy produced evidence she said proved that Hellman had lied in some accounts of her life.

She claimed to be the model for the character named Julia in ''Pentimento'', and in the movie ''Julia'' based on a chapter of that book. Hellman, who never met Gardiner, said that \"Julia\" was somebody else.<ref name=nyt1 >{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/29/books/publishing-new-memoir-stirs-julia-controversy.html |newspaper=New York Times |first=Edwin |last=McDowell |title=New Memoir Stirs 'Julia' Controversy |date=April 29, 1983 |access-date= December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nGardiner wrote that, while she never met Hellman, she had often heard about her from her friend [[Wolf Schwabacher]], who was Hellman's lawyer. By Gardiner's account, Schwabacher had visited Gardiner in Vienna. After Muriel Gardiner and Joseph Buttinger moved into their house at [[Brookdale Farm (Pennington, New Jersey)|Brookdale Farm]] in [[Pennington, New Jersey]] in 1940, they divided the house in two.

Variety gave it a positive review, praising Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave as being \"dynamite together on the screen,\" Richard Roth's production as \"handsome and tasteful,\" as well as the period costumes and production design.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://variety.com/1976/film/reviews/julia-1200423977/ |title=Julia \u2013 Variety |publisher=Variety.com |date=1976-12-31 |access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] called the film a \"fascinating story,\" but felt the movie suffered from being told by Lillian Hellman's point of view. \"The film never really establishes a relationship between the two women,\" he wrote. \"It's awkward, the way the movie has to suspend itself between Julia \u2013 its ostensible subject \u2013 and Lillian Hellman, its real subject.\" He gave it two and a half out of four stars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/julia-1977 |title=Julia Movie Review & Film Summary (1977) |publisher=Roger Ebert |date=1977-01-01 |access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] said of Julia- \"Very little of what happens in the film is intrinsically interesting\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Reverse Angle: A Decade of American Film|url=https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo|url-access=registration|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Crown Publishers Inc. |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo/page/338 338]}}</ref>\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' gave it three out of five stars and declared it \"Beautifully crafted, nominated for eleven Academy Awards, a big hit at the box office--and a dramatic dud ...
