Written by [[Danny Strong]] and directed by [[Jay Roach]], the television film stars [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Laura Dern]], [[John Hurt]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Bruce McGill]], and [[Tom Wilkinson]]. It premiered on [[HBO]] on May 25, 2008. The television film was nominated for eleven [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], winning three for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding Made for Television Movie]], [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie|Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or Dramatic Special]] (for Roach), and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries or a Movie]] (for Baumgarten). It was also nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] (for Dern).\n\n==Plot==\n''Recount'' chronicles the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 U.S. presidential election]] ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' case between Governor of Texas [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|George W. Bush]] and U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000|Al Gore]]. It begins with the election on November 7 and ends with the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling, which stopped the [[Florida election recount]] on December 12.\n\nKey points depicted include: Gore's retraction of his personal telephone concession to Bush in the early hours of November 8; the decision by the Gore campaign to sue for hand recounts in [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] strongholds where [[Hacking Democracy|voting irregularities]] were alleged, especially in light of the statistical dead heat revealed by the reported machine recount; [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] pressure on [[Florida]]'s Secretary of State [[Katherine Harris]] in light of her legally mandated responsibilities; the attention focused on the hand recounts by media, parties, and the public; the two major announcements by Florida Supreme Court spokesman [[Craig Waters]] extending the deadline for returns in the initial recount (November 21, 2000) and ordering a statewide recount of votes (December 8, 2000), and later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court; and finally the adversarial postures of the Supreme Courts of [[Florida Supreme Court|Florida]] and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States]], as well as the dissenting opinions among the higher court's justices.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[Ron Klain]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Warren Christopher]]\n* [[Laura Dern]] as [[Katherine Harris]]\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as [[James Baker]]\n* [[Denis Leary]] as [[Michael Whouley]]\n* [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] as [[David Boies]]\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as [[Benjamin Ginsberg (lawyer)|Ben Ginsberg]]\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as [[John McKager Stipanovich|Mac Stipanovich]]\n* Paul Jeans as [[Theodore Olson|Ted Olson]]\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Mitchell Berger\n* Alex Staggs as [[Craig Waters]]\n* Doug Williford as Mark Fabiani\n* [[Gary Basaraba]] as Clay Roberts\n* Stefen Laurantz as [[Joe Allbaugh]]\n* [[Mitch Pileggi]] as [[William M.
