It received mixed to positive reviews from critics and won several awards, including the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for [[Sean Connery]]. Another adaptation was made in 2019 as a [[The Name of the Rose (miniseries)|television miniseries]] for [[RAI]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=January 2020}}\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], the plot should be 400-700 words; word count is ##; do not add more detail. -->\nAdso of Melk recounts how, in 1327, as a young [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] novice, he and his mentor, Franciscan friar [[William of Baskerville]], traveled to a Benedictine abbey in [[northern Italy]] where the Franciscans were to [[Disputation|debate]] with papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey boasts a famed [[scriptorium]] where scribes copy, translate or [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminate]] books. The monk Adelmo of Otranto \u2014 a young but famous manuscript illuminator \u2014 was suspiciously found dead on a hillside below a tower with only a window that could not be opened. The abbot seeks help from William, who is renowned for his deductive powers. William is reluctantly drawn in by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also worries the abbot will summon officials of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] if the mystery remains unsolved.\n\nWilliam quickly deduces that Adelmo committed suicide, having jumped from a nearby tower having a window, and that the slope of the hill caused the body to roll below the other tower. William's solution briefly allays the monks' fears, until another monk is found dead, ominously floating in a vat of pig's blood. The victim is Venantius, a translator of [[Greek language|Greek]] and the last man to speak with Adelmo. The corpse bears black stains on a finger and the tongue. The translator's death rekindles the monks' fears of a supernatural culprit, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan friar [[Ubertino of Casale]] warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]]. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, the head librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building.\n\nWilliam encounters Salvatore, a demented hunchback, and his protector, Remigio da Varagine, the [[cellarer]]. William deduces that both were [[Dulcinian|Dulcinites]], members of a heretical, militant sect that believes that clergy should be impoverished. William does not suspect them of murder though because Dulcinites target wealthy bishops, not poor monks. Nevertheless, Remigio's past gives William leverage in learning the abbey's secrets. Salvatore tells William that Adelmo had crossed paths with Venantius on the night that Adelmo died. Meanwhile, Adso encounters a beautiful, semi-feral, peasant girl who has sneaked into the abbey to trade sexual favors for food, and is seduced by her.\n\nReturning that night to Venantius's desk, William finds a book in Greek, and a parchment with Greek writing, smudges of a color blended by Adelmo for illuminating books, and cryptic symbols written by a left-handed man using invisible ink. Berengar sneaks into the darkened scriptorium, distracts William and steals the book.\n\nBerengar is later found drowned in a bath and bearing stains similar to those on Venantius. William narrates his conclusions that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide, due to giving in to Berengar's requests for homosexual favors. Venantius received a parchment from Adelmo before Adelmo's death, and Berengar is the only left-handed man in the abbey. William theorizes that the translator transcribed the Greek notes on the parchment from a book, and that the book is somehow responsible for the deaths. The abbot is unconvinced and, burning the parchment, he informs William that the Inquisition \u2014 in the person of [[Bernardo Gui]], an old adversary of William from his former time as an inquisitor \u2014 has already been summoned.\n\nDetermined to solve the mystery before Gui arrives, William and Adso discover a vast, hidden library above the scriptorium. William suspects the abbey hid the books because much of their contents comes from pagan philosophers. Gui finds Salvatore and the peasant girl fighting over a black cockerel while in the presence of a [[black cat]]. For Gui, this is irrefutable proof of [[witchcraft]], and he tortures Salvatore into a [[false confession]]. As both William's Franciscan brothers and the papal delegates arrive, the debate begins. The abbey's herbalist, after telling William he has found a book written in Greek in his dispensary, is murdered by another monk, who is revealed to be Malachia. The latter tricks Remigio into attempting to escape, causing him to be arrested by Gui's guards and charged with the murders.\n\nRemigio, Salvatore and the girl are brought before a tribunal. Remembering William, Gui chooses him to join the abbot as a tribunal judge. At trial, Remigio proudly admits his Dulcinite past and, under Gui's threats of torture, also falsely confesses to the murders. William points out that the murders are tied to the Greek book, which Remigio could not read, and warns that Remigio's execution will not end the murders. Gui arranges for the prisoners to be [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]], while William will be taken to [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]]. The papal delegates condemn the Franciscans for William's obstinacy and end the debate.\n\nAs the monks prepare to burn Gui's prisoners, Malachia is found dying, with black stains on his tongue and finger. Although Malachia's death vindicates William's warning, Gui takes it as proof that William is the murderer, and orders his arrest. Fleeing Gui's guards, William and Adso re-enter the secret library and come face to face with the blind Venerable Jorge, the oldest denizen of the abbey. Having decoded the lines on the translator's parchment, William demands that Jorge turn over the book that the dead men had been reading: [[Aristotle]]'s ''Second Book of [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] on Comedy''. Jorge hates laughter, thinking it undermines faith in God, and a book on laughter written by Arisotle will only bring laughter to the wise men, and undermine the faith among those of learning. To prevent that, Jorge killed those who had read the book by poisoning its pages. Jorge gives the book to William, thinking he too will suffer the poison. When William reveals that he is wearing gloves, Jorge grabs the book, then starts a blaze that quickly engulfs the library. William stays behind, trying to save some of the books and encouraging Adso to leave. Jorge kills himself by consuming the poison-coated pages.\n\nSeeing the fire, the monks abandon the prisoners, allowing the local peasants to save the girl, though Salvatore and Remigio die. Adso chases Gui, who manages to escape him, but the peasants push his wagon off a cliff, impaling him. As William and Adso depart, Adso encounters the girl, stops for a few seconds, but eventually chooses to go with William. The much older Adso states that he never regretted his decision as he learned many more things from William before their ways parted. He also says that the girl was the only earthly love of his life, but he never learned her name.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[William of Baskerville]]\n* [[F.
