The film stars [[Scott Bakula]], [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Robert Loggia]], and [[Harley Jane Kozak]]. Co-stars include [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]], [[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]], [[Jason Bateman]], [[Kathy Ireland]], [[Rob Schneider]], and [[Fred Dalton Thompson]].\n\nThe film touches on an up-and-coming [[season (sport)|season]] at the fictional higher learning institution of Texas State University and its [[American football|football]] team nicknamed the Fightin' Armadillos.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mghelmets.com/movies.html |title=Movie/TV helmets |publisher=Mghelmets.com |access-date=2012-12-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714081535/http://mghelmets.com/movies.html |archive-date=2011-07-14 }}</ref> (At the time the film was made, there was no Texas State University, but in 2003, Southwest Texas State University changed its name to [[Texas State University]], nicknamed the Bobcats, which coincidentally was the \"season opener\" opponent of the fictional Texas State Armadillos.)\n\nThe once-powerful Armadillos are forced to start the season with a host of new coaches and players after the previous staff and all but one players are banned following a scandal. This predicament is based on the \"[[Death penalty (NCAA)|death penalty]]\" handed out to the [[SMU Mustangs football|Southern Methodist University football team]] for violations very similar to the ones found at the fictional Texas State.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Texas State University Fightin' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. After winning consecutive conference and national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit years' worth of victories. All of the coaches were fired and all of the players are banned from returning and expelled from college except Charlie Banks, the only \"clean\" player, who never got to play despite having \"heart\".\n\nThis move forces new head coach Ed \"Straight Arrow\" Gennero (Elizondo) to build an almost entirely new team with little assistance. No athletic [[scholarship]]s are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Phillip Elias (Miller), the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the university, who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it due to the corruption the football program has caused over the years, and funnel the funding into his own pocket. The coaches soon have a makeshift team in place.\n\nDue to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible because of poor grades, only 17 players are allowed on the team\u2014not enough for separate [[offense (sports)|offensive]] and [[defence (sports)|defensive]] squads. The Armadillos are thus forced to play [[ironman football]]. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at [[quarterback]], [[placekicker]], and the [[defensive line]]. Assistant coach Wally \"Rig\" Riggendorf (Loggia) finds Paul Blake (Bakula), a 34-year-old high school star who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and become the Armadillos' quarterback.\n\nBlake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter (Kozak). Blake then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm (Sinbad), who is also enrolled at the school and still has some eligibility remaining. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team is unable to win.\n\nCarter tells Blake that she knows him from 16 years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a 1975 championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship which Dean Elias opposes due to their student-teacher dynamic\u2014not to mention Elias' own lascivious interest in Carter.\n\nCoach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper (Ireland) from the school's [[association football|women's soccer]] team.  When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3\u20133 tie with [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] (in real life, Kansas holds the all-time NCAA Division I-A record for number of tie games with 57<ref>[http://www.totalfootballstats.com/KansasJayhawks.asp Total Football Stats.com] Division I-A All-Time Wins</ref>). After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with Gennero and Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate Edison, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. Dean Elias barges into Carter's office after end-of-term exams, first coming onto her as a distraction from him tampering with the team's grades (to sabotage their eligibility for the final game), but she plays along momentarily before warning him that if one grade changes, she'll report him to the University President.\n\nWith the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the state of Texas, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Gennero, who is hospitalized just before the game for a potential heart attack, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they rally in the second half to cut the deficit to one, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from \nindigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. Minutes before the final touchdown, after learning about his scheme to get rid of the football program (and his sexual harassment of Carter), TSU president Purcell fires Dean Elias, though not before the entire Armadillo defensive line runs him down. The team decides to try to win it all with a [[two-point conversion]]. They fake a [[extra point|point after]] attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Team===\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as Paul Blake\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Coach Ed Gennero\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Coach Wally Riggendorf\n* [[Sinbad (entertainer)|Sinbad]] as Andre Krimm\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Jarvis Edison\n* [[Andrew Bryniarski]] as Wyatt Beaudry\n* [[Duane Davis]] as Featherstone\n* [[Michael Dolan]] as Eric 'Samurai' Hansen\n* [[Marcus Giamatti]] as Sargie 'Fumblina' Wilkinson\n* [[Kathy Ireland]] as Lucy Draper\n* [[Andrew Lauer]] as Charlie Banks\n* [[Louis Mandylor]] as McKenzie\n* [[Peter \"Navy\" Tuiasosopo|Peter Tuiasosopo]] as Laikai \"the Slender\" Manumana\n\n===Other===\n* [[Harley Jane Kozak]] as Dr. Suzanne Carter\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Dean Phillip Elias\n* [[Fred Thompson]] as University President Carver Purcell\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Chuck Neiderman\n* Garrett Schenck as Grant Edison\n* [[Rodger Boyce]] as Sheriff Woods\n* [[Chris Berman]] as Himself\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot at various locations in [[Texas]].<ref name=bsun>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-05-17/features/1991137121_1_longest-yard-ben-davidson-roughness|title='Necessary Roughness' includes football stars|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=1991-05-17|access-date=2016-01-16}}</ref> [[Azle, Texas|Azle]], [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], and [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] were the primary locations used for filming.
