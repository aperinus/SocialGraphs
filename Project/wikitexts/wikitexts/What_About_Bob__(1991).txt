When Bob befriends the other members of Leo's family, the patient's problems push the doctor over the edge.\n\nThe film received positive reviews and was a box office success. This film is number 43 on [[Bravo (American TV network)|Bravo]]'s \"100 Funniest Movies\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/gallery/bravos_funniest/|title=Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies of All Time|publisher=Boston.com|access-date=November 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[New York City]] Bob Wiley has great work ethic and treats people well, but he suffers from multiple phobias which makes it difficult for him to leave his apartment and is divorced because his ex-wife likes [[Neil Diamond]] and he does not. Despite regular therapy, he makes little progress and his fears compel him to seek constant reassurance from his therapists.\n\nExhausted by Bob's high-maintenance conditions and invasions of personal boundaries, his current therapist refers him to the egotistical Dr. Leo Marvin, who believes his recently published book ''Baby Steps'' will make him a household name. Bob feels good about their initial session, but Dr. Marvin dismisses Bob in a rush to his long-standing, month-long family vacation. Unable to cope, Bob contacts Leo via his telephone exchange and tries to find out where he is, but Leo dismisses him. Then Bob pays a prostitute to impersonate Leo's sister Lily so Bob can call him, but Leo tells Bob he cannot trust him if he pulls any more stunts like that. He then disguises himself as a homicide detective telling the switchboard operator that Bob committed suicide and tracks Leo to [[Lake Winnipesaukee]], [[New Hampshire]]. Leo is annoyed, but sees Bob's desperation and tells him to \"take a vacation\" from his problems. Bob seems to have made a breakthrough, but the next morning, he tells Leo that he will also be vacationing at Lake Winnipesaukee as a guest of the Guttmans, who hold a grudge against Leo for purchasing the lakeside home they had been scrimping and saving for years to buy.\n\nLeo dismisses Bob's attempts at friendship as he believes patients are beneath him, but Bob ingratiates himself with Leo's family and relates to the problems of Leo's kids, Anna and Sigmund \"Siggy\", in contrast with their father's clinical approach. Bob begins to enjoy life, going sailing with Anna and helping Sigmund dive, which Leo had been unsuccessfully trying for years. After Leo angrily pushes Bob into the lake, Leo's wife Fay forces him to apologize, which he begrudgingly does. She then invites Bob to dinner and he accepts, believing Leo's slights against him are either accidental or part of his therapy. After dinner, a thunderstorm forces Bob to spend the night.  Before sleeping, Bob, being germaphobic up to this point, throws away the tissues that he carried with him everywhere when making contact with various objects, showing that he is slowly making therapeutic progress.  Leo wants Bob out of the house early the next morning before ''[[Good Morning America]]'' arrives to interview him about ''Baby Steps''. The TV crew, oblivious to Leo's discomfort, suggest having Bob on the show as well. Leo humiliates himself during the interview, while Bob is relaxed and speaks glowingly of Leo and the book, inadvertently stealing the spotlight.\n\nLeo attempts to have Bob institutionalized, but Bob is soon released after befriending the hospital staff and telling them therapy jokes, demonstrating his sanity and showing that he has made real therapeutic progress due to his time with Dr. Marvin's family. Forced to retrieve Bob, Leo abandons him in the middle of nowhere, but Bob quickly gets a ride back to Leo's house while various mishaps delay Leo. Returning after nightfall, Leo is surprised by the birthday party Fay has secretly planned for him and is delighted to see his beloved sister Lily. When Bob appears and puts his arm around Lily, Leo becomes completely psychotic and attacks him. Bob still remains oblivious to Leo's hostility until Fay explains Leo's grudge against Bob, to which Bob finally understands and agrees to leave.\n\nLeo breaks into a general store, stealing a shotgun and 20 pounds of explosives and kidnaps Bob at gunpoint. Leo leads him deep into the woods and ties him up with the explosives, calling it \"death therapy\", and returns to the house, gleefully preparing his cover story. Believing the explosives are props as a metaphor for his problems, Bob applies Leo's \"''Baby Steps''\" approach and manages to free himself of his restraints and remaining fears; he reunites with the Marvins and praises Leo for curing him. Leo asks Bob where the explosives are and Bob says they are in the family's vacation house, which promptly explodes into flames, much to the Guttmans' delight. Horrified, Leo is rendered [[catatonic]] and institutionalized while having his medical license revoked for attempted murder.\n\nSome time later, Bob marries Leo's sister, and upon their pronouncement as husband and wife, the still-catatonic Leo finally regains his senses and screams, \"No!\", but the sentiment is lost in the family's excitement at his recovery, and Leo is forced to accept Bob as his new brother-in-law. Text at the end reveals that Bob went back to school and became a psychologist, then wrote a best-selling book titled ''Death Therapy'', for which Leo is suing him for the rights.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Bob Wiley\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Dr. Leo Marvin\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Fay Marvin\n* [[Charlie Korsmo]] as Sigmund \"Siggy\" Marvin\n* [[Kathryn Erbe]] as Anna Marvin\n* [[Tom Aldredge]] as Mr. Guttman\n* [[Susan Willis]] as Mrs. Guttman\n* [[Roger Bowen]] as Phil\n* [[Fran Brill]] as Lily Marvin-Wiley\n* [[Doris Belack]] as Dr. Catherine Tomsky\n* [[Marcella Lowery]] as Betty\n}}\n\n==Production==\nBefore Frank Oz was hired to direct, [[Garry Marshall]] was considered, and [[Woody Allen]] was approached to play Dr. Leo Marvin.

He said it was Bill Murray's best movie since ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in 1984. [[Gene Siskel]] gave it a \"thumbs down\" rating and felt Murray gave a very funny and enjoyable performance in the film, but was rather upset by the Dreyfuss character and his angry and arrogant behaviors. He felt it would have been funnier if Dreyfuss had not given such an angry performance in the film and said that Dreyfuss ultimately ruined the film for him.<ref>{{Cite episode |title= Soapdish/What About Bob?/Hudson Hawk/Only the Lonely  |series= [[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]] |first1= Siskel |last1= Gene |first2= Roger |last2= Ebert |date= June 1, 1991 |season= 5 |number= 38 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1912855/ }}</ref>\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] also gave the film a favorable review: in ''Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide'' he gives the film three stars out of a possible four, saying it's \"a very funny outing with Murray and Dreyfuss approaching the relationship of [[Wile E.
