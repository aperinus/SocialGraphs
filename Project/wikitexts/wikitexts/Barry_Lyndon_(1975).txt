Starring [[Ryan O'Neal]], [[Marisa Berenson]], [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]], [[Leonard Rossiter]], and [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]], the film recounts the early exploits and later unravelling of a fictional 18th-century Irish rogue and opportunist who marries a rich widow to climb the social ladder and assume her late husband's aristocratic position.\n\nKubrick began production on ''Barry Lyndon'' after his 1971 film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. He had originally intended to direct a [[Stanley Kubrick's unrealized projects#Napoleon|biopic]] on [[Napoleon]], but lost his financing because of the commercial failure of the similar 1970 [[Dino De Laurentiis]]-produced ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]''. Kubrick eventually directed ''Barry Lyndon'', set partially during the [[Seven Years' War]], utilising his research from the Napoleon project. Filming began in December 1973 and lasted roughly eight months, taking place in England, Ireland, [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]].\n \nThe film's cinematography has been described as ground-breaking. Especially notable are the long [[Two shot|double shots]], usually ended with a slow backwards zoom, the scenes shot entirely in candlelight, and the settings based on [[William Hogarth]] paintings. The exteriors were filmed on location in Ireland, England and West Germany, with the interiors shot mainly in London.<ref name=\"production\"/> The production had problems related to logistics, weather,<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/marisa-berenson-on-the-making-of-barry-lyndon-kubrick-wasnt-a-difficult-ogre-he-was-a-perfectionist-a7134716.html|website=[[The Independent]]|title=Marisa Berenson on the making of Barry Lyndon: Kubrick wasn't a 'difficult ogre \u2013 he was a perfectionist'|date=13 July 2016|access-date=20 June 2020}}</ref> and politics (Kubrick feared that he might be an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] hostage target).<ref name=\"Whitington\"/><ref name=\"rte\"/>\n\n''Barry Lyndon'' won four Oscars at the [[48th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Scoring: Original Song Score and Adaptation or Scoring: Adaptation]]; [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]; [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]]; and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]. Although some critics took issue with the film's slow pace and restrained emotion, its reputation, like that of many of Kubrick's works, has grown over time.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|film|date=September 2021}}\n\n===Part I: ''By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon''===\n\nAn [[Omniscient narrator|omniscient]] (though possibly [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable]])<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Mark Crispin|title=Barry Lyndon Reconsidered|journal=The Georgia Review|year=1976|volume=XXX|issue=4|url= http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0086.html}}</ref> narrator relates that in 1750s Ireland, Redmond Barry's father is killed in a [[duel]] over a sale of some horses. The widow devotes herself to her only son.  Barry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Nora and her family plan to improve their finances through marriage to a well-off British Army captain, John Quin. Barry shoots Quin in a duel, then flees. He is robbed by [[highwayman]] [[James Freney|Captain Feeney]].  Penniless and dejected, Barry joins the British Army. Later, family friend Captain Grogan informs him that his dueling pistol had been loaded with [[Tow (fibre)|tow]], and Quin is not dead: the duel was staged by Nora's family to get rid of Barry.\n\nBarry's regiment fights in Germany in the [[Seven Years' War]]. Grogan is fatally wounded in a skirmish. Fed up with the war, Barry deserts. En route to neutral Holland, he encounters Frau Lieschen. The two briefly become lovers. Later, Barry encounters Prussian Captain Potzdorf, who, seeing through his disguise, offers him the choice of being handed over to the British to be shot or enlisting in the [[Prussian Army]]. Barry enlists and later receives a special commendation from Prussian King Frederick II for saving Potzdorf's life in a battle.\n\nTwo years later, after the war ends in 1763, Barry is employed by Captain Potzdorf's uncle in the Prussian Ministry of Police. The Prussians suspect the Chevalier de Balibari, a professional gambler, of spying for the Austrians, and have Barry become his servant. Barry reveals everything to the Chevalier, a fellow Irishman. They become confederates. After they cheat the Prince of T\u00fcbingen at cards, the Prince accuses the Chevalier of cheating and demands [[Duel#Offense and satisfaction|satisfaction]]. Barry's Prussian handlers, still suspecting that the Chevalier is a spy, arrange for the Chevalier to be expelled from the country. Alerted by Barry, the Chevalier flees in the night. The next morning, Barry, disguised as the Chevalier, is escorted from Prussia.\n\nOver the next few years, Barry and the Chevalier travel across Europe, perpetrating gambling scams, with Barry forcing payment from reluctant debtors with sword duels. In [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], he encounters the beautiful and wealthy Countess of Lyndon. He seduces and later marries her after the death of her elderly husband, Sir Charles Lyndon (caused by Barry's goading and verbal repartee).\n\n===Part II: ''Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon''===\n\nIn 1773, Barry takes the Countess's last name and settles in England. Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's ten-year-old son by Sir Charles, quickly comes to despise Barry. Barry retaliates by physically abusing Bullingdon. The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money, while keeping her in seclusion.\n\nBarry's mother comes to live with him. She warns him that if Lady Lyndon were to die, Lord Bullingdon would inherit everything, and advises him to obtain a noble title to protect himself. Toward this goal, he cultivates the acquaintance of the influential Lord Wendover and spends large sums of money to ingratiate himself to high society. However, a now adult Lord Bullingdon crashes a lavish birthday party Barry throws for Lady Lyndon. He publicly explains why he detests his stepfather and declares he will leave the family estate for as long as Barry remains there and married to his mother. Barry viciously assaults Bullingdon until he is physically restrained. This causes him to be cast out of polite society.\n\nBarry proves an overindulgent father to Bryan and gives him a full-grown horse for his ninth birthday. Bryan is thrown from the horse and dies a few days later. The grief-stricken Barry turns to alcohol, while Lady Lyndon seeks solace in religion, assisted by the Rev. Samuel Runt, who had been tutor to Lord Bullingdon and Bryan. Barry's mother dismisses Runt, both because the family no longer needs (nor can afford, due to Barry's spending debts) a tutor and for fear that his influence will worsen Lady Lyndon's condition. Lady Lyndon later attempts suicide. Runt and Graham, the family's accountant, then seek out Lord Bullingdon, who returns and challenges Barry to a duel.\n\nA coin toss gives Bullingdon the first shot, but he nervously misfires his pistol. Barry magnanimously [[Delope|fires into the ground]], but Bullingdon refuses to let the duel end. In the second round, Bullingdon shoots Barry in the leg. The leg has to be amputated below the knee.  While Barry is recovering, Bullingdon takes control of the Lyndon estate. He offers Barry 500 guineas a year provided he leave England forever. With his credit exhausted, Barry accepts. The narrator states that Barry resumes his former profession of gambler (though without his former success). In December 1789, a middle-aged Lady Lyndon signs Barry's annuity cheque as her son looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Suits.BarryLyndon.jpg|thumb|Suits worn in ''Barry Lyndon'']] [[File:Barrylyndon.suits2.jpg|thumb|Suits worn in ''Barry Lyndon'']]\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Michael Hordern]] (''voice'') as Narrator\n* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Redmond Barry (later Redmond Barry Lyndon)\n* [[Marisa Berenson]] as Lady Lyndon\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as the Chevalier du Balibari\n* [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]] as Captain Potzdorf\n* [[Gay Hamilton]] as Nora Brady\n* [[Godfrey Quigley]] as Captain Grogan\n* [[Steven Berkoff]] as Lord Ludd\n* [[Marie Kean]] as Belle, Barry's mother\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as Reverend Samuel Runt\n* [[Frank Middlemass]] as Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon\n* [[Leon Vitali]] as Lord Bullingdon\n** [[Dominic Savage]] as young Bullingdon\n* [[Leonard Rossiter]] as Captain John Quin\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Morell]] as Lord Wendover\n* [[Anthony Sharp]] as Lord Hallam\n* [[Philip Stone]] as Graham\n* [[David Morley (musician)|David Morley]] as Bryan Patrick Lyndon\n* [[Diana K\u00f6rner|Diana Koerner]] as Lieschen (German Girl)\n* [[Arthur O'Sullivan]] as Captain Feeney\n* [[Billy Boyle]] as Seamus Feeney\n* [[Jonathan Cecil]] as Lt.

Their relationship lasted until Kubrick's death. The film's cinematographer, [[John Alcott]], appears at the men's club in the non-speaking role of the man asleep in a chair near the title character when Lord Bullingdon challenges Barry to a duel. Kubrick's daughter [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian]] also appears (in an uncredited role) as a guest at Bryan's birthday party.\n\nOther Kubrick featured regulars were Leonard Rossiter (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''), Steven Berkoff, Patrick Magee, Godfrey Quigley, Anthony Sharp, and Philip Stone (''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''). Stone went on to feature in ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter completing post production on ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Kubrick resumed planning a film about [[Napoleon]]. During pre-production, [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] and [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' was released, and failed at the box office. Reconsidering, Kubrick's financiers pulled funding, and he turned his attention towards an adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1962 novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Subsequently, Kubrick showed an interest in Thackeray's ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' but dropped the project when a serialised version for television was produced. He told an interviewer, \"At one time, ''Vanity Fair'' interested me as a possible film but, in the end, I decided the story could not be successfully compressed into the relatively short time-span of a feature film ... as soon as I read ''Barry Lyndon'' I became very excited about it.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Michel|title=Kubrick on Barry Lyndon|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |access-date=31 May 2007|last=Ciment| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070505010625/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archive-date= 5 May 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHaving earned Oscar nominations for ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ''A Clockwork Orange'', Kubrick's reputation in the early 1970s was that of \"a perfectionist [[auteur]] who loomed larger over his movies than any concept or star\".<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\">{{Cite news|last=Robey|first=Tim|date=27 July 2016|title=Kubrick by candlelight: how Barry Lyndon became a gorgeous, period-perfect masterpiece|language=en-GB|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/07/27/kubrick-by-candlelight-how-barry-lyndon-became-a-gorgeous-period/|access-date=12 May 2020|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826130615/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/07/27/kubrick-by-candlelight-how-barry-lyndon-became-a-gorgeous-period/|archive-date=26 August 2019}}</ref> His studio\u2014Warner Bros.\u2014was therefore \"eager to bankroll\" his next project, which Kubrick kept \"shrouded in secrecy\" from the press partly due to the furore surrounding the controversially violent ''A Clockwork Orange'' (particularly in the UK) and partly due to his \"long-standing [[paranoia]] about the [[tabloid press]].\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\nHaving felt compelled to set aside his plans for a film about Napoleon Bonaparte, Kubrick set his sights on Thackeray's 1844 \"[[satire|satirical]] picaresque about the fortune-hunting of an Irish rogue,\" ''Barry Lyndon'', the setting of which allowed Kubrick to take advantage of the copious period research he had done for the now-aborted ''Napoleon''.<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> At the time, Kubrick merely announced that his next film would star [[Ryan O'Neal]] (deemed \"a seemingly un-Kubricky choice of leading man\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>) and [[Marisa Berenson]], a former ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover model,<ref name=\"Grdn2019\">{{cite news |last1=Saner |first1=Emine |title='I did the first nude in Vogue': Marisa Berenson on being a blazing star of the 70s and beyond: Interview |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/30/marisa-berenson-warhol-dali-vogue-cabaret |access-date=25 November 2019 |work=The Guardian|date=30 October 2019}}</ref> and be shot largely in Ireland.<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/> So heightened was the secrecy surrounding the film that \"Even Berenson, when Kubrick first approached her, was told only that it was to be an 18th-century costume piece [and] she was instructed to keep out of the sun in the months before production, to achieve the period-specific pallor he required.\"<ref name=\"TelegraphReview\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\n[[Principal photography]] lasted 300 days, from spring 1973 through to early 1974, with a break for Christmas.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Making Time in Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon: Art, History, and Empire|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0_I8BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Bloomsbury Academic|date = 18 December 2014|isbn = 9781441167750|language = en|first = Maria|last = Pramaggiore}}</ref> The crew arrived in [[Dublin]], Ireland in May 1973.

Barry is pushed through life by a series of key events, some of which seem unavoidable. As Roger Ebert says, \"He is a man to whom things happen.\"<ref name=\"rogerebert.com\">{{cite news |date=9 September 2009 |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/barry-lyndon-1975 |title=Technically awesome, emotionally distant, and classically Kubrick |first=Roger| last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=RogerEbert.com }}</ref> He declines to eat with the highwaymen Captain Feeney, where he would most likely have been robbed, but is robbed anyway farther down the road. The narrator repeatedly emphasizes the role of fate as he announces events before they unfold on screen, like Bryan's death and Bullingdon seeking satisfaction. This theme of fate is also developed in the recurring motif of the painting. Just like the events featured in the paintings, Barry is participating in events which always were.\n\nAnother major theme is between father and son. Barry lost his father at a young age and throughout the film he seeks and attaches himself to father-figures. Examples include his uncle, Grogan, and the Chevalier. When given the chance to be a father, Barry loves his son to the point of spoiling him. This contrasts with his role as a father to Lord Bullingdon, whom he disregards and punishes.<ref name=\"rogerebert.com\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/32367/1/why-barry-lyndon-is-stanley-kubrick-s-seminal-masterpiece |title=Why Barry Lyndon is Stanley Kubrick's secret masterpiece |author=Charlie Graham-Dixon |date=8 August 2016|website=Dazed}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/barry-lyndon-review-stanley-kubrick-ryan-o-neal|title=Barry Lyndon review \u2013 Kubrick's intimate epic of utter lucidity|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=28 July 2016 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref>\n\n==Source novel==\nKubrick based his adapted screenplay on [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' (republished as the novel ''Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq.),'' a [[picaresque]] tale written and published in serial form in 1844.\n\nThe film departs from the novel in several ways. In Thackeray's writings, events are related in the first person by Barry himself. A comic tone pervades the work, as Barry proves both a [[raconteur]] and an [[unreliable narrator]]. Kubrick's film, by contrast, presents the story objectively. Though the film contains voice-over (by actor [[Michael Hordern]]), the comments expressed are not Barry's, but those of an omniscient narrator. Kubrick felt that using a first-person narrative would not be useful in a film adaptation:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html |title=Visual memory | place = UK | type = interview |access-date=7 March 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210204149/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.bl.html| archive-date= 10 February 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|I believe Thackeray used Redmond Barry to tell his own story in a deliberately distorted way because it made it more interesting. Instead of the omniscient author, Thackeray used the imperfect observer, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the dishonest observer, thus allowing the reader to judge for himself, with little difficulty, the probable truth in Redmond Barry's view of his life. This technique worked extremely well in the novel but, of course, in a film you have objective reality in front of you all of the time, so the effect of Thackeray's first-person story-teller could not be repeated on the screen. It might have worked as comedy by the juxtaposition of Barry's version of the truth with the reality on the screen, but I don't think that Barry Lyndon should have been done as a comedy.}}\n\nKubrick made several changes to the plot, including the addition of the final duel.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-04-09|title=All hail Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon,' a masterclass in bringing a unique filmmaker's vision to life \u2022 Cinephilia & Beyond|url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/stanley-kubricks-barry-lyndon/|access-date=2021-07-22|website=Cinephilia & Beyond|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1975]]\n*''[[Overlord (1975 film)|Overlord]]'' \u2013 the 1975 [[Stuart Cooper]] [[WWII]] film John Alcott also worked on\n*[[Cinema of Ireland]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n{{Noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Tibbetts, John C., and James M.
