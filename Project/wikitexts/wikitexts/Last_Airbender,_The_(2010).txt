April 19, 2010. Retrieved January 5, 2022.</ref> The film tells the story of Aang, a young Avatar who must master all four elements of air, water, fire and earth and restore balance to the world while stopping the Fire Nation from conquering the Water Tribes and the Earth Kingdom.\n\nDevelopment for the film began in January 2007, and the casting and pre-production process happened during 2008. Filming began on March 2009 with a preliminary schedule held in [[Greenland]] for two weeks, and the rest of the film were shot in major locations across [[Pennsylvania]], United States. Post-production began in August and took several months due to extensive visual effects. The name ''Avatar'' was dropped from the title to avoid confusion with [[James Cameron]]'s 2009 film [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]].\n\n''The Last Airbender'' premiered in [[New York City]] on June 30, 2010, and was theatrically released in United States the following day. In contrast to the universal acclaim for the animated series, the film was widely panned by critics, audiences, and fans of the original series upon its release, with some considering it to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst#The Last Airbender (2010)|worst films ever made]].<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Richard|last=Corliss|authorlink=Richard Corliss|date=July 2, 2010|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2000996,00.html|title=''The Last Airbender'': Worst Movie Epic Ever?|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=September 22, 2022}}</ref> Many criticized the screenplay, acting, direction, casting, effects, action sequences, plot holes, unfaithfulness to the source material, characters, and 3D conversion. However, [[James Newton Howard]]'s score received some praise. Produced on a $150 million budget, the film grossed $131 million domestically and $319 million worldwide. ''The Last Airbender'' was originally envisioned as the first of a [[trilogy]] of films based on the three seasons of the series, but due to the near-universal backlash and low{{clarify|date=November 2022}} profits of the film, the planned trilogy was ultimately scrapped.\n\n==Plot==\nA century has passed since the Fire Nation declared war on the other three nations of air, water, and earth in their attempt to conquer the world. [[Sokka]] and his younger sister [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]], who live in the Southern Water Tribe, discover an unusual [[iceberg]]. Breaking into the iceberg releases a beam of light and reveals a 12-year-old boy named [[Aang]] and his pet flying [[bison]] [[Appa (character)|Appa]].\n\n[[Zuko]], the disgraced prince of the Fire Nation, detects the light from Aang's release and arrives at the Southern Water Tribe to demand the villagers hand over the Avatar: the only person capable of manipulating, or \"bending\", all four elements of air, water, earth, and fire. Aang surrenders himself to save the village, but escapes the Fire Nation ship and flies to Appa, brought by Katara and Sokka. The trio travel to Aang's homeland at the Southern Air Temple, where Aang learns he was in the iceberg for a century and that the Fire Nation wiped out the other Air Nomads, including his guardian [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters|Monk Gyatso]]. In despair, Aang enters the Avatar State and finds himself in the Spirit World where he encounters a Dragon Spirit. Katara's pleas bring Aang out of the Avatar State.\n\nThe group arrives at an Earth Kingdom village controlled by the Fire Nation. When they are arrested and imprisoned, they incite a rebellion, battling and defeating the Fire Nation soldiers occupying the village. Aang tells Katara and Sokka that he only knows airbending and has yet to master the other three elements. They make their way to the Northern Water Tribe where Aang can learn from waterbending masters.\n\nDuring a side trip to the Northern Air Temple, Aang is betrayed by a peasant and captured by Fire Nation archers led by [[Admiral Zhao|Commander Zhao]]. However, a masked marauder called the Blue Spirit helps Aang escape. Zhao realizes that Zuko is the Blue Spirit, and has a crossbowman fire a bolt that knocks Zuko out, but Aang uses his skills to escape with the unconscious Zuko. Aang watches over Zuko until morning, then leaves to reunite with Sokka and Katara. Zhao tries again to kill Zuko by blowing up his ship, but Zuko secretly survives and sneaks aboard Zhao's ship.\n\nUpon arriving, Aang and company are welcomed by the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe, and waterbending master [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters|Pakku]] teaches Aang and Katara. The Fire Nation arrives and Zhao begins his attack while Zuko continues his independent search for the Avatar. After defeating Katara in battle, Zuko captures Aang, who reenters the Avatar State to search for the Dragon Spirit for help to defeat the Fire Nation. The Dragon Spirit advises him to \"use the ocean and show the power of water\".\n\nReturning to his body, Aang battles Zuko until Katara freezes Zuko in ice, then leaves to join the battle. Zuko's uncle Iroh and Zhao make their way to a sacred cave where Zhao captures the Moon Spirit. Despite Iroh's pleas, Zhao kills the Moon Spirit to strip all the waterbenders of their abilities. Enraged by Zhao's sacrilege, Iroh reveals his mastery of firebending, frightening Zhao and his entourage out of the sacred cave. Princess Yue gives her life to revive the Moon Spirit. Zhao finds out Zuko survived and they prepare to fight, but Iroh talks Zuko out of it and Zhao is drowned by waterbenders. Recalling his life before being trapped in the ice, Aang enters the Avatar State and raises the ocean into a gigantic wall to drive the Fire Nation back.\n\nZuko's father [[Fire Lord Ozai]] learns of the defeat and tasks his daughter Princess [[Azula]] with preventing the Avatar from mastering earth and fire.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters}}\n[[File:Noah Ringer.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Noah Ringer]] made his acting debut in the film as [[Aang]].

Rather than software, computer graphic cards were the basis for \"bending\" the elements, allowing previews to be viewed more swiftly. This resulted in Shyamalan having to direct more than sixty takes before the effect was finished and lined up with his visions.<ref name=effects />\n\nDue to reality-based expectations, fire and water were the hardest elements to effectively bend, and because of particle work which was unable to be rendered in hardware, earth bending also was difficult to create.<ref name=effects /> With water, the variety in different scales required Helman and his team to create different techniques. The concept for air was derived from the animation of the television series.<ref name=effects /> To create the air bending effect, visual effects art director Christian Alzman and digital matte department supervisor Barry Williams explained that seeing dust and snow particles, rather than seeing the air itself, helped shape the real-world effect of bending the element. Before the bending effects could be applied, though, the actor's movements had to be matched; Shyamalan, therefore, wanted each character's bending styles to be unique to fit with their unique personalities.<ref name=effects />\n\nThe challenge for fire did not come with making it look realistic, but rather making the fire behave in an unrealistic way that would be believable to the audience.<ref name=effects /> The film that inspired ''The Last Airbender''{{'}}s fire style was [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|the sixth ''Harry Potter'']] film, which was re-engineered to reflect two-dimensional simulations.<ref name=\"fire\">{{cite news |date= July 1, 2010 |last= Boucher |first= Geoff |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-jul-01-la-et-fire-20100701-story.html |title= The Last Airbender and ILM's quest for fire  |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100708011934/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/last-airbender-and-ilms-quest-for-fire.html |archive-date= July 8, 2010 |url-status= live |access-date= 2020-04-04 }}</ref> Helman's team referenced images of flames being pushed through the air by giant fans for certain shots needed throughout the film. The team also considered using a meshed image of real and digital fire, but in the end, went with the richer, deeper texture of computer-generated flame.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nThe film also used [[matte paintings]], which had to be in 3D because the visual style included long-duration shots in which the camera always moved.<ref name=effects /> The climax, which was enacted on a {{convert|200|x|200|ft|m}} set, had to be merged with stills of the Greenland landscapes, as well as the low-angle lighting that was captured on location there.<ref name=effects /> The camera was animated to get angles needed for different shots in the film by importing these stills into the computer. Multiple cameras were utilized to achieve the different wire-work and animation that was used to create the creatures and many fight scenes within the film. In creating these creatures, the team looked at various real-world creatures to influence the look of the lemur [[Momo (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Momo]]'s wings.<ref name=effects /> In order for them to be believable, they looked for examples of the same size and weight as the animated character and then produced hybrids from different animals to make each species distinct. This was done by observing actual animals to get a take on how they would act.<ref name=effects /> Shyamalan's take on the personality of each creature also influenced the creation stage of the creatures. For example, Momo has flying mechanics based on a giant [[fruit bat]]. Other elements, such as texturing, hair or scale simulation, and light and shadow complementary to the live action, were added to make the final animation appear as real as possible during the later stages of character development.<ref name=effects />\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] made an announcement in late April 2010, revealing that ''The Last Airbender'' would be released in [[3-D film|3D]].<ref name=convert>{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/04/airbender-goes-3d/ |title=Paramount And M.

Shyamalan's response was that all of his previous films were 90 minutes because they were small-scale supernatural thrillers, and as a result, his instinct for the pacing of the film was to edit it down to 90 minutes. This short runtime indirectly led to several other problems which multiple critics objected to: characters frequently resort to giving long speeches of exposition to summarize entire scenes that were cut for time, and a running voiceover commentary by Katara was added in which she summarizes entire subplots (e.g. Sokka's relationship with Yue) that barely appear on-screen.<ref name=\"nymag\">{{cite web | title = Vulture Reads M.
