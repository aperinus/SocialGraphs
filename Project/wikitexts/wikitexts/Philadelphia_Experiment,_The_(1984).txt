It is directed by [[Stewart Raffill]] and stars [[Michael Par\u00e9]], [[Bobby Di Cicco]], [[Kene Holliday]] and [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] and based on the [[urban legend]] of the [[Philadelphia Experiment]]. In 1943,  [[United States Navy]] sailors David Herdeg (Par\u00e9) and Jim Parker (Di Cicco) are thrown forward in time to the year 1984 when a scientific experiment being performed aboard the [[USS Eldridge (DE-173)|USS ''Eldridge'']] suffers a catastrophe. The film follows the two men as they attempt to survive the future and race against time to put an end to the experiment that now threatens the fate of the entire world.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1943, [[United States Navy]] sailors David Herdeg and Jim Parker serve aboard destroyer escort [[USS Eldridge (DE-173)|USS ''Eldridge'']], docked in Philadelphia. Doctor James Longstreet and his team conduct an experiment to render the ship invisible to radar, but a malfunction causes the ship to disappear. David and Jim's attempts to stop the experiment fail and they jump overboard to escape.\n\nThey land during the night in a small town, which also disappears, leaving them marooned in a desert. Startled by the appearance of an unfamiliar aircraft (a helicopter), they flee and Jim is nearly electrocuted by an electric fence. Eventually, they find their way to a roadside diner. An energy discharge from Jim destroys two [[arcade game]]s, forcing an altercation with the owner. Fleeing to the parking lot, they take a woman named Allison hostage and force her to drive them away. Confused by their surroundings, they are shocked when Allison tells them that the year is 1984. They are tracked and apprehended by the police. Jim, who is suffering increasingly severe seizures, is hospitalized before disappearing from his hospital bed in a flash of light. David and Allison then evade [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]], who have arrived to take David into custody.\n\nLearning that they are near Jim's birthplace, Santa Paula California, David decides to try to find his family. Jim's wife Pamela, who is now a senior citizen, immediately recognizes David from 1943. She says that the ''Eldridge'' had reappeared minutes after disappearing. Jim had also returned and had been chastised and hospitalized after telling the truth about temporarily visiting 1984. David finds that he himself never returned. David sees an elderly Jim outside a window but Jim refuses to speak with him. As David and Allison leave, they see military police approaching and a high speed chase through Jim's ranch ensues. The two manage to elude them when the pursuing vehicle crashes and burns. From the burning wreck, David salvages documents mentioning Longstreet. Recognizing that Longstreet had been involved with the Philadelphia experiment in 1943, David decides to find him. As they spend time together, David and Allison fall in love.\n\nIn 1984, Longstreet has attempted to use the same technologies that were used in the ''Eldridge'' experiment to create a shield as protection from an [[ICBM]] attack. When the equipment was tested, the shielded town disappeared into \"hyperspace\". The scientists are unable to shut down the experiment, which has created a vortex that is drawing matter into it and causes extremely unstable and severe weather. Longstreet predicts that the vortex will continue to expand until the entire world is consumed. The scientists send a probe into the vortex and discover the ''Eldridge'' inside. They theorize that the two experiments have linked together with the generators on the ''Eldridge'' powering the vortex.\n\nDavid captures an assistant at Longstreet's home and forces the man to take them onto the base. Longstreet explains the situation to David and tells him that, according to surviving sailors from the ''Eldridge'', the ship returned to Philadelphia in 1943 after David shut down the generator. Longstreet says that David must go through the vortex to the ''Eldridge'' and terminate the experiment or the vortex will destroy the Earth.\n\nDavid is outfitted with an electrically insulated suit and catapulted into the vortex. He lands on the deck of the ''Eldridge'', where he finds crew members badly injured. He hurries to the generator room and smashes arrays of [[vacuum tube]]s using a firefighting [[axe]]. The generator shuts down and David looks for Jim. Assured that Jim is fine, David jumps over the side of the ship and disappears. Back in 1943, Longstreet and others watch the ''Eldridge'' reappear in Philadelphia, revealing crew members with severe burns, while others have been fused alive into the ship's hull.\n\nIn 1984, the missing town reappears as Allison and David are reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Par\u00e9]] as David Herdeg\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Allison Hayes\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Dr. Jim Longstreet\n**Miles McNamara as Young Jim Longstreet\n* [[Bobby Di Cicco]] as Jim Parker\n**[[Ralph Manza]] as Older Jim Parker\n* [[Louise Latham]] as Pamela\n**Debra Troyer as Young Pamela\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Barney\n* [[Kene Holliday]] as Major Clark\n* Joe Dorsey as Sheriff Bates\n* [[Michael Currie (actor)|Michael Currie]] as Magnussen\n* [[Gary Brockette]] as Adjutant / Andrews\n* James Edgcomb as Officer Boyer\n* [[Glenn Morshower]] as Mechanic\n* [[Vaughn Armstrong]] as Cowboy\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[John Carpenter]] wrote an original draft. He called it a \"great shaggy dog story. Absolute crap, but what a great story. While I was writing it, I couldn\u2019t figure out the third act. A friend suggested the revenge of the crew against the people who put them there, but I thought it was too much like ''[[The Fog]]''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://justinbeahm.com/on-john-carpenter-career-retrospective-interview/|title=Interview with John Carpenter|website=Justin Beahm}}</ref>\n \nStewart Raffill says by the time he became involved with the film, the script had been rewritten nine times. He agreed to do the film, subject to the next rewrite which he thought was \"terrible\". The head of the studio agreed with Raffill's additions to the script, even though it was only three weeks before filming: \"So, he asked if I had ever dictated a screenplay before. I told him I had not. Then he said, \"Well, I\u2019m gonna send someone to your house, a girl, every afternoon, and just dictate the story you told me and fill in the dialogue and we\u2019ll make that\". And I said, \"Okay\". So that's what I did\".<ref name=\"int3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/stewart-raffill-mannequin-2-interview/3/|website=Slashfilm|date=15 July 2016|title=Interview with Stewart Raffill Part 3}}</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography began on November 28, 1983.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=The Philadelphia Experiment|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/57165|url-status=live|access-date=2022-01-05|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> Parts of the film were shot in [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Wendover, Utah]], [[Denver, Colorado]], [[Santa Paula, California]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref> The destroyer [[USS Laffey (DD-724)|USS ''Laffey'' (DD-724)]], then on display at [[Patriots Point]], represented USS ''Eldridge'' in the film.
