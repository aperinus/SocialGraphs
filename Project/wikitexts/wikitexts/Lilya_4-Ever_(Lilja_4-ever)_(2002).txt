When the figure turns around, the film introduces the audience to Lilya Michailova, an adolescent girl who has recently been badly beaten. The film then reveals her past.\n\nLilya lives with her mother in a run-down apartment block in an unnamed former republic of the [[Soviet Union]]. Lilya's mother tells her they are emigrating to the United States with the mother's new boyfriend, but instead, she abandons Lilya in the care of her aunt while she and the boyfriend move to America. The aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat Lilya and her mother had lived in while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment.\n\nA subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilya. Her best friend Natasha encourages her to join her in [[prostitution]], but Lilya declines. When money is discovered in Natasha's possession, she lies and says the money belongs to Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school. This culminates in Lilya being raped by a group of boys she knows. She ultimately has to become a prostitute to support herself.\n\nMeanwhile, Lilya forms another close, protective friendship with a younger boy named Volodya, who is [[physical abuse|physically abused]] by his alcoholic single father. She buys Volodya a basketball, but his father punctures it with a pair of scissors. She then meets a young man, Andrei, who becomes her boyfriend and convinces her to move to Sweden, where he says she will have a better life.  After arriving in Sweden, she is instead met by a [[pimp]] who takes her to a nearly empty apartment where he imprisons and rapes her. Lilya is then forced to perform sexual acts for a large number of clients.\n\nDespondent over the departure of his only friend, Volodya commits suicide, his soul taking the form of an angel. As an angel, Volodya comes to Lilya to watch over her. On Christmas Day, he transports Lilya to the roof of the apartment building where they lived and, deeply regretting having killed himself, gives her the world as a present, but Lilya rejects him. After an escape attempt, Lilya is violently beaten by her pimp, but she escapes again successfully. With the story arriving full circle to the scene at the beginning of the film, Lilya jumps from the bridge and commits suicide herself.\n\nThe film's conclusion presents two different endings. One version shows Lilya being sent back in time after killing herself to when she made the decision to go to Sweden with Andrei. However, this time she rejects Andrei's offer, and she and Volodya are shown to presumably live happier lives. In the final scene, Lilya and Volodya are both angels happily playing basketball on the roof of a tenement building.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Oksana Akinshina]] as Lilya Michailova\n* [[Artyom Bogucharsky]] as Volodya\n* Lyubov Agapova as Lilya's mother\n* Liliya Shinkaryova as Anna, Lilya's aunt\n* Elina Benenson as Natasha\n* Pavel Ponomaryov as Andrei\n* Tomasz Neuman as Witek\n* Anastasiya Bedredinova as neighbour\n* T\u00f5nu Kark as Sergei\n* Nikolai Bentsler as Natasha's boyfriend\n\n==Production==\n===Writing and pre-production===\nThe script was loosely based on the life of [[Danguol\u0117 Rasalait\u0117]], a 16-year-old girl from [[Lithuania]] whose case had made headlines in Sweden in 2000. A male acquaintance helped Rasalait\u0117 travel to Sweden with the promise of a job in [[Malm\u00f6]]. When she arrived, a man referred to as \"the Russian,\" who would become her pimp, took her passport and told her she would have to repay him 20,000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] ($2410 USD in 1999; ${{Inflation|US|2410|1999|r=-1}} today) for travel expenses and she was forced to prostitute herself for the next month. She escaped from the apartment where she was being held in the rough suburb of [[Arl\u00f6v]], moved to Malm\u00f6 and after three months, day after she had been raped by her boyfriend and two other men, on 7 January 2000 jumped from a bridge and died three days later in the hospital.

Janson went on to compare the directing to [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' and ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'', but found ''Lilja 4-ever'' to be superior: \"What particularly distinguishes Moodysson's from von Trier's destruction tales and makes it so much more gruesome, are the ties to reality.
