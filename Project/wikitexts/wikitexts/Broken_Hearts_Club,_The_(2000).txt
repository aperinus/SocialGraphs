It follows the lives of a group of [[homosexual|gay]] friends in [[West Hollywood]], centered on a restaurant owned by the fatherly Jack ([[John Mahoney]]) and the softball team he sponsors. The friends rely on each other for friendship and support as they search for love, deal with loss, and discover themselves.\n\n''The Broken Hearts Club'' was Berlanti's first feature film, based on his circle of friends at the time. The movie was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, receiving praise for portraying homosexuality as normal and its characters as average gay men. The film focuses on \"the universal themes of romance, acceptance and family\", as opposed to [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], [[coming out]], and sex, which are more controversial and stereotypical topics commonly covered in [[LGBT films]].<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite web |last=Clinton |first=Paul |author-link=Paul Clinton |date=October 3, 2000 |title=See ''The Broken Hearts Club'' with someone special |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/03/review.broken.hearts/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202053507/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/03/review.broken.hearts/index.html |archive-date=February 2, 2008 |access-date=April 10, 2010 |website=[[CNN]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows the lives of a group of [[homosexual|gay]] friends in [[West Hollywood]].

But when tragedy strikes, and the group's newest member, 23-year-old Kevin, attempts to fit in, their friendships are put to the test.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Jack\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Dennis\n* [[Dean Cain]] as Cole\n* [[Zach Braff]] as Benji\n* [[Matt McGrath (actor)|Matt McGrath]] as Howie\n* [[Ben Weber (actor)|Ben Weber]] as Patrick\n* [[Billy Porter (Broadway performer)|Billy Porter]] as Taylor\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Betty\n* [[Andrew Keegan]] as Kevin\n* [[Nia Long]] as Leslie\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Anne\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Marshall\n* [[Kerr Smith]] as catcher\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Broken Hearts Club'' was written by [[Greg Berlanti]] about his own circle of friends at the time; the Howie/Marshall storyline is semi-autobiographical to a relationship Berlanti once had.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kilday |first=Gregg |date=June 6, 2000 |title=The Big Movie Preview \u2014 Broken Hearts Club |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2IEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA32 |access-date=September 26, 2021 |website=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |page=32}}</ref> The film had a working title of ''The Broken Hearts League'' as well as ''8x10's'', a term Berlanti's sister used to describe the men he dated.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Reddish |first=David |date=October 21, 2020 |title=Happy 20th: How Greg Berlanti's 'The Broken Hearts Club' changed the course of queer cinema |url=https://www.queerty.com/happy-20th-greg-berlantis-broken-hearts-club-changed-course-queer-cinema-20201021 |access-date=September 26, 2021 |website=[[Queerty]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe production was able to secure funding from the studio with the casting of [[John Mahoney]] and [[Timothy Olyphant]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Dean Cain]] took a role against the wishes of his agents, who had cautioned him against a playing a gay character.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Billy Porter (actor)|Billy Porter]], who was the least known of the actors cast at the time, won the role of Taylor when he \"[imbued] the character with heart and something real\" in his audition.<ref name=\":0\" /> The film also stars [[Nia Long]], [[Mary McCormack]] and [[Justin Theroux]].
