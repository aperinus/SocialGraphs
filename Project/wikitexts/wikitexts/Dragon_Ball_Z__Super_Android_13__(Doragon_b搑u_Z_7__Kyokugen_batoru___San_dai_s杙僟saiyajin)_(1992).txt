San Dai S\u016bp\u0101 Saiyajin|lead=yes}}, is a 1992 Japanese [[anime]] [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[martial arts film]] and the seventh [[Dragon Ball Z]] film. It was originally released in Japan on July 11 at the Toei Anime Fair along with the third ''[[Dragon Quest: Dai no Daib\u014dken]]'' film and the ''[[Rokudenashi Blues]]'' film. Early concept art for the reissue used the title '''Android Assault''', but the final product went back to using Funimation's original title for the film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nThe [[mad scientist]] [[Dr. Gero]] is killed at the hands of his creations, the [[Artificial Human 17|Androids 17]] and [[Artificial Human 18|18]]. However, Gero had secretly copied his consciousness into an underground supercomputer that continued to manifest his dream of creating the ultimate android capable of killing [[Goku]] and destroying humanity.\n\nAt a shopping mall, Goku, [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]], [[Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball)|Chi-Chi]], [[Krillin]], [[Master Roshi]], [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]], and [[Future Trunks]] eat lunch in a restaurant. Two beings enter the city and begin causing mayhem as they hunt for Goku, eventually detecting his location in the restaurant above them. They use a massive energy attack in an attempt to kill Goku but he, Gohan, Krillin, and Trunks manage to survive and save the people inside of the restaurant from certain death. Goku is confronted by the culprits and correctly assumes that they are androids because he cannot sense their [[qi|energy]]. Introducing themselves as Androids 14 and 15, they attack and overwhelm Goku before Trunks intervenes. Goku suggests that they take the fight elsewhere in order to avoid harming innocent people in the city, and they fly off as the androids pursue them.\n\nGoku and Trunks engage the androids when another android soon appears - Android 13. He explains that despite Dr. Gero's death, his computer has been programmed to continue the mission to kill Goku out of revenge for defeating the Red Ribbon Army decades prior. 13 quickly overwhelms Goku while Trunks is outmatched by the combined assault of 14 and 15. However, [[Vegeta]] also arrives and joins the fight. Goku engages 13 while Trunks and Vegeta fight 14 and 15 respectively. Goku, Vegeta and Trunks all simultaneously power up to their Super Saiyan forms as Gohan and Krillin watch on. 13 manages to hold the upper hand against Goku, who is soon assisted by the arrival of [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], while Trunks and Vegeta destroy 14 and 15. They surround 13 who is pleased that 14 and 15 have been destroyed and he proceeds to absorb their cores into his own being and undergoes a transformation into a hulking form.\n\nWith his newfound power, 13 completely overwhelms Goku and his allies. Seeing no other option for victory, Goku begins summoning energy for the ''Spirit Bomb'' attack while his allies attempt to hold off 13. 13 eventually realizes what Goku is doing and attempts to stop him, but Piccolo manages to hold him off just long enough for Goku to transform into a Super Saiyan again and he merges with the Spirit Bomb's energy. 13 attacks again, but Goku punches through 13's abdomen and sends him soaring into the core of the Spirit Bomb where he is obliterated by its massive energy. With 13's demise, the underground supercomputer shuts down for good. Krillin and Gohan are hospitalized where the group modestly celebrate their victory together. Elsewhere, Piccolo and Vegeta sit on an iceberg, isolated from the celebration.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"2\" |English\n|-\n! <small>Chinkel Post-Production[[Mediawan Thematics|AB Groupe]] ({{circa|2003}})</small><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614|title=Dragon Ball Z: Big Green Dub Cast - Behind The Voice Actors|website=www.behindthevoiceactors.com|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref>\n! <small>([[Funimation]] (2003)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Goku]] \n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Masako Nozawa]] || [[David Gasman]] || [[Sean Schemmel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gohan]] \n| Jodi Forrest || [[Stephanie Nadolny]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] \n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Toshio Furukawa]] \n! <small>Big Green</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Christopher Sabat|Christopher R.
