A. Bayona]] and written by [[Sergio G. S\u00e1nchez]]. It is based on the experience of [[Mar\u00eda Bel\u00f3n]] and her family in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. It features an international cast including <!---to avoid misunderstanding of Spanish actors speaking English in this \"English-language Spanish film\"---> [[Naomi Watts]], [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Tom Holland]] in his film debut.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics for its direction and its acting, especially for Watts who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2004, Doctor Maria Bennett, her husband Henry, and their three sons Lucas, Thomas, and Simon go on a Christmas holiday to [[Khao Lak]], [[Thailand]]. Arriving on Christmas Eve, they settle in and begin to enjoy the brand new Orchid Beach Resort. Two days later on [[December 26]], the massive [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]] inundates the area.\n\nMaria and Lucas eventually emerge from the swirling water and find one another, with Maria having sustained serious injuries to her leg and chest. They help a toddler, Daniel, from the debris and are soon found by locals who dress and transfer them to a hospital in the city of [[Takua Pa]]. Daniel is separated from them during the journey. At the hospital, Maria encourages Lucas to help others find their family members while she goes into surgery for her chest injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, Henry and the two younger boys have also survived and are together. Henry leaves Simon and Thomas with another family who are then taken to the mountains for safety by local relief crews. Henry stays behind to search for Maria and Lucas in the rubble. While out looking, injured and alone, he is picked up by a passer-by and driven to a nearby bus station with other survivors. \n\nCommunication facilities are scarce, but a European tourist named Karl, who has also been separated from his family, lends Henry his cell phone to contact his relatives in England. Henry promises Maria's father he will look everywhere for his family and that he will find them. Karl volunteers to accompany Henry to look for Maria and Lucas as well as his own family, who were at the beach when the tsunami hit.\n\nWhile Maria is in surgery, her medical chart is mixed up with a patient named Muriel Barnes, who has died. Lucas returns to find his mother's bed empty and is then taken to a tent where children without families are kept safe. The mistake is discovered when Lucas cannot identify any of the dead woman's jewelry and he is subsequently reunited with his mother, who had been moved to a private room in the [[Intensive Care Unit|ICU]]. While he waits in the hospital, Lucas sees Daniel, who has been reunited with his father.\n\nHenry and Karl search for their families in various places before they arrive at the hospital, where Henry is given five minutes to look. Karl gives him a piece of paper with the names of his family members. \n\nA vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also stops outside the hospital, and the boys get off so Simon can urinate. From a distance, Lucas recognizes his father, and while searching for him in the chaotic crowd outside, Lucas's brothers spot him and they reunite. Henry finds the three of them together. He learns that Maria is in the hospital, ready to undergo more surgery for her leg. \n\nAs the anesthesia puts her to sleep, Maria experiences [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of how she came to be injured and how she surfaced the water. While she is in surgery, Lucas tells Henry he has something really important to tell Maria.\n\nThe following day, the family boards an ambulance airplane to [[Singapore]] so Maria may receive further medical treatment. A representative from their insurance company, [[Zurich Insurance Group|Zurich Insurance]], assures them everything will be taken care of as Lucas sees countless people outside the hospital looking through patient lists. On the plane, Lucas tells his mother that Daniel is safe with his father. Maria cries and looks out the window at the chaos left behind as the plane takes off.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as [[Mar\u00eda Bel\u00f3n|Maria]], a doctor and the mother of the Bennett family.\n*[[Ewan McGregor]] as Henry, the father of the Bennett family.\n*[[Tom Holland]] as Lucas, the 12-year-old son.\n* [[Samuel Joslin]] as Thomas, the seven-and-a-half-year-old son.\n* [[Oaklee Pendergast]] as Simon, the five-year-old son.\n* [[Marta Etura]] as Simone\n* [[S\u00f6nke M\u00f6hring]] as Karl, a German man trying to find his wife and daughter.

He says of the comments, \"As I must, I've never been the sort of person to revisit and analyse events of the past, but some of these articles frustrated me. Had this film been purely about the tale of a western middle class family's 'ruined' holiday then I would have agreed. For me, it was the exact opposite. Rather than concentrating on the 'privileged white visitors', the film portrayed the profound sense of community and unity that I experienced in Thailand, with this family at the centre of it. Both for my (then) 16-year-old self and the Bel\u00f3n family, it was the [[Thai people]] who waded through the settled water after the first wave had struck to help individuals and families... The Thai people had just lost everything \u2013 homes, businesses, families \u2013 yet their instinct was to help the tourists.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/04/the-impossible-beautifully-accurate-film |title=The Impossible is 'beautifully accurate', writes tsunami survivor |publisher=theguardian.com |date=4 January 2013 |first=Simon |last=Jenkins |access-date=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''The Impossible'' was a box office success.
