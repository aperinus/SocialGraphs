The screenplay by [[Michael Seitzman]] was inspired by the 2002 book ''Class Action: The Story of Lois Jenson and the Landmark Case That Changed Sexual Harassment Law'' by [[Clara Bingham]] and Laura Leedy Gansler, which chronicled the case of ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.|Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Company]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1989, Josey Aimes flees from her abusive husband back to her hometown in northern [[Minnesota]] with her children, Sammy and Karen, and moves in with her parents, Alice and Hank. Hank is ashamed of Josey, who had Sammy as a teenager by an unknown father, and believes Josey is [[promiscuous]]. While working a job washing hair, Josey reconnects with an old acquaintance, Glory Dodge, who works at the local iron mine and suggests Josey do the same, as a job there pays six times more than what Josey's making now. When Josey takes the job, her relationship with Hank becomes strained. Hank also works at the mine and believes women shouldn't be working there, so Josey and her children move in with Glory and her husband, Kyle.\n\nJosey quickly befriends several other female workers at the mine and soon realizes the women are constant targets for sexual harassment and humiliation by most of their male co-workers, who, like Hank, believe the women are taking jobs more appropriate for men. Josey in particular is targeted by Bobby Sharp, her ex-boyfriend from high school. Josey tries to talk to her supervisor, Arlen Pavich, about the problem, but he refuses to take her concerns seriously. The women experience additional harassment and even abuse in retaliation, and Bobby spreads rumors that Josey attempted to seduce him, leading his wife to publicly berate and humiliate Josey at Sammy's hockey game. Sammy begins to resent the way the townspeople treat them and comes to believe the gossip about his mother's alleged promiscuity.\n\nJosey takes her concerns to the mine's owner, Don Pearson, but despite his previous assurances that he is there to help, she arrives to find that he has invited Pavich to the meeting, along with several other executives and offers to accept her resignation immediately. She refuses, and after Pearson implies he believes the rumors about her promiscuity, leaves devastated. Later, after being sexually assaulted by Bobby at work, she resigns and asks Bill White, a lawyer friend of Kyle and Glory, to help her file a lawsuit against the company. Bill advises her to recruit other women to form a [[class action]] lawsuit, which would be the first of its kind. The female miners, however, fear losing their jobs and facing additional harassment, so Josey attempts to go ahead with the case alone. She also discovers that Glory has [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's Disease]], and her health is declining rapidly.\n\nAlice and Hank argue over Josey's lawsuit, and when Hank still refuses to forgive his daughter, Alice leaves him. At a union meeting, Josey attempts to address the miners and explain her reasons for suing the mine, but they constantly interrupt and insult her, leading Hank to stand up for his daughter and reprimand his co-workers for their treatment of Josey and all the women at the mine. He and Alice then reconcile. In court, the mining company's attorney attempts to hold Josey's sexual history against her, based on Bobby's testimony that Sammy is the result of a consensual sexual relationship between Josey and her high school teacher, Paul Lattavansky. Josey then reveals that after school one day, where she and Bobby had been serving [[school detention|detention]] together after being caught kissing, she was raped by Lattavansky, which led to her becoming pregnant with Sammy. Hank attacks the teacher in question and Bill gets a recess after Josey storms out of the courtroom.\n\nSammy still refuses to believe his mother and runs away, until Kyle urges him to reconsider, and he and Josey embrace after having a talk. Bill cross-examines Bobby and gets him to admit he witnessed  Lattavansky rape Josey, but was too scared to do anything about it. Glory, who has come to the court in her wheelchair and is unable to speak, has Kyle read a letter saying she stands with Josey, though still not enough to qualify for a class action suit. After a pause, many other women stand, followed by family members and even several male miners who didn't harass the female ones. The mining company is forced to pay the women for their suffering and establish a landmark [[sexual harassment]] policy at the workplace.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Josephine \"Josey\" Aimes\n** [[Amber Heard]] as young Josey\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Glory Dodge\n* [[Sean Bean]] as Kyle Dodge\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Henry \"Hank\" Aimes\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Robert \"Bobby\" Sharp\n** [[Cole Williams]] as young Bobby\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Sherry\n* [[Thomas Curtis (actor)|Thomas Curtis]] as Samuel \"Sammy\" Aimes\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Bill White\n* [[Sissy Spacek]] as Alice Aimes\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Gray Suchett\n* [[Linda Emond]] as Leslie Conlin\n* [[Rusty Schwimmer]] as Big Betty\n* [[Jillian Armenante]] as Peg\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Arlen Pavich\n* [[Chris Mulkey]] as Earl Slangley\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as Ricky Sennett\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as Mr. Lattavansky\n* [[John Aylward]] as Judge Halsted\n* [[Marcus Chait]] as Wayne\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nLois Jenson, on whom the character of Josey is based, actually began working at the EVTAC (from \"Eveleth Taconite\") mine in [[Eveleth, Minnesota]], in 1975 and initiated her lawsuit in 1984, four years before the year in which the film begins. Its timeline was condensed, but in reality it took fourteen years for the case to be settled.

We remember that Frances McDormand played a woman police officer in this same area in ''[[Fargo (1996 film)|Fargo]]'', and we value that memory, because it provides a foundation for Josey Aimes. McDormand's role in this movie is different and much sadder, but brings the same pluck and common sense to the screen. Put these two women together (as actors and characters) and they can accomplish just about anything. Watching them do it is a great movie experience.\"<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051020/REVIEWS/51005002/1023 ''Chicago Sun-Times'' review].

Instead, we get a TV-movie fantasy of female empowerment glazed with soap-opera theatrics.
