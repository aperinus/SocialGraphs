Birdee and her daughter Bernice ([[Mae Whitman]]) go to live with her mother (Rowlands) in the small town where Birdee grew up, where everyone knows of her televised marital collapse. Meanwhile, she meets an old friend named Justin (Connick Jr.) and instantly sparks a romance. While Justin's intentions are clear and good, Birdee struggles with the decision to unequivocally accept him in her life.\n\nThe film made its release on May 29, 1998 and was distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\n==Plot==\nBirdee Pruitt is a [[Chicago]] housewife who is invited onto the national Toni Post [[talk show]] under the pretense of getting a free makeover, but is ambushed with the revelation that her husband Bill has been having an affair with her best friend Connie.\n\nHumiliated, Birdee and her precocious daughter Bernice move back to Birdee's hometown of [[Smithville, Texas]], with Birdee's eccentric mother Ramona and her young, imaginative nephew Travis. As Birdee and Bernice leave Chicago, Birdee gives Bernice a letter from Bill, telling Bernice how much he misses her.\n\nBirdee struggles to make a new life as a working single mother and deals with the growing attraction between herself and a former high school classmate, Justin Matisse, who Ramona hopes that Birdee will get together with. She also tries to rebuild her relationship with her estranged mother, her father (who has [[Alzheimer's disease]]), and Bernice, who desperately wants to be with her father and attempts to sabotage the romantic overtures Justin makes towards Birdee. Meanwhile, Bernice is struggling to adjust to her new life and school in Smithville.\n\nAdding to Birdee's heartache is her former status as the school [[Queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]] and beauty pageant winner who dismissively alienated many of her classmates. They remember Birdee's high school snobbery and rub her nose in her televised embarrassment.\n\nRamona tries to mend the gap between her daughter and granddaughter by telling a story about her childhood.  She then asks Bernice what she wants for her upcoming birthday. Even though Bernice says she does not have a birthday wish, she secretly wishes for her father to return.\n\nRamona suffers a massive heart attack and dies. Birdee's sister and Travis's mother, Desiree, sends a telegram that she cannot make the funeral. Meanwhile, Travis wonders if his aunt Birdee will raise him now. When Bill arrives at the funeral, Bernice believes that her wish has come true and that her father wants them both to come home.\n\nHowever, it soon becomes clear to Bernice that her parents' split is permanent when Bill asks Birdee for a divorce. Wanting to be with her father, Bernice runs to her room, packs a suitcase, and follows Bill to his car. She is devastated when he tells her that even though he loves her and promises to come back for her, he has no room for her in his new life with Connie right now. Bill drives off, leaving Bernice sobbing and screaming for him to come back and take her with him.\n\nBirdee picks Bernice up, carrying her back into the house. As Birdee comforts her, she says she knows the letter was actually written by her mother, and not really by her father.\n\nOne day at work, Birdee finds Justin outside waiting for her with flowers. As she walks to him, she says, \"Ok, Mama, stop pushing.\" After they kiss and embrace, he picks her up, places her in his truck and they drive off.\n\nThe final scene shows Birdee, Justin, Bernice, and Travis at a big town event. It is shown that Birdee has taken full custody of Travis and is also dating Justin, but is not planning on getting married again for a really long time. Bernice embraces Smithville as her new hometown, ultimately accepts Bill's departure from her life, and has warmed up to Justin as her mother's new love interest and a father figure.\n\nThe mother and daughter share a tender, yet humorous moment when Bernice asks if Birdee plans to marry Justin. When Birdee asks her if she does not like him, Bernice says her only real concern is being known as \"Bernice Matisse\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Birdee Pruitt\n* [[Harry Connick Jr.]] as Justin Matisse\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Ramona Calvert\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as Peck \n* [[Mae Whitman]] as Bernice Pruitt\n* [[Michael Par\u00e9]] as Bill Pruitt\n* [[Cameron Finley]] as Travis\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Toni Post\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Nurse\n* [[Connie Ray]] as Bobbi-Claire Patterson\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Connie Phillips (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Filming==\nThe home in the movie is the McCollum-Chapman-Trousdale House, built in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hollywood Stars and Smithville, Texas |url=http://blueeyesandbluebonnets.com/2010/01/smithville-texas |publisher=Blue Eyes and Bluebonnets |access-date=9 October 2012 |date=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211173113/http://blueeyesandbluebonnets.com/2010/01/smithville-texas |archive-date=11 December 2010 }}</ref> The elementary school in the movie is a 1924 high school building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.katyhouse.com/smithville-attractions.htm |title= |website=www.katyhouse.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101212846/http://www.katyhouse.com/smithville-attractions.htm |archive-date=November 1, 2006}}</ref>  The church used was Saints Peter and Paul Church in [[Kovar, Texas]], about 6 miles from Smithville.

McEwen had a more mixed reaction, assessing the film as \"a run-of-the-mill romance, but fair work by all involved.\" He particularly praised the chemistry between Connick and Bullock and the country-flavored soundtrack. However, he criticized that the townspeople's callousness towards Birdie strains credulity, since Bullock's performance makes it hard to imagine people disliking her so much, and that even if they did it would be normal for them to have some sympathy after her public humiliation and the breakup of her marriage.<ref>{{cite web|last=McEwen|first=John R.|title=Filmquips -- Hope Floats |url=http://www.filmquipsonline.com/hopefloats.html |access-date=20 October 2017|date=1998}}</ref>\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Awards and nominations {{anchor|Awards}}===\n* 1999 [[ALMA Awards]]\n** Nomination: ''Outstanding Performance of a Song for a Feature Film'' - ''[[The Mavericks]]'' for the song \"All I Get\".\n* 1999 [[Acapulco Black Film Festival]]\n** Nomination: ''Best Director'' - Forest Whitaker\n* 1999 [[Blockbuster Entertainment Award]]s\n** Nomination: ''Favorite Actor - Drama/Romance'' - Harry Connick Jr.\n** Nomination: ''Favorite Supporting Actress - Drama/Romance'' - Gena Rowlands\n* 1999 ''Lone Star Film & Television Awards''\n** Winner: ''Best Actress'' - Sandra Bullock\n** Winner: ''Best Supporting Actress'' - Gena Rowlands\n* 1999 [[Young Artist Awards]]\n** Winner: ''Best Performance in a Feature Film - Young Actress Age Ten or Under'' - Mae Whitman\n** Nomination: ''Performance in a Feature Film - Young Actor Age Ten or Under'' - [[Cameron Finley]]\n* 1998 [[YoungStar Award]]s\n** Nomination: ''Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Drama Film'' - Cameron Finley\n** Nomination: ''Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Drama Film'' - Mae Whitman\n* 1998 [[Stinkers Bad Movie Awards]]\n** Nomination: ''Most Annoying Fake Accent'' - Sandra Bullock\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/hope-floats|''Hope Floats''}}\n* {{IMDb title|0119313|Hope Floats}}\n* {{Amg movie|162470|Hope Floats}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|hope_floats|Hope Floats}}\n\n{{Forest Whitaker}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 drama films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:Country music films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Forest Whitaker]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Lynda Obst]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Dave Grusin]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Texas]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
