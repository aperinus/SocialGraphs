The number ends with Astaire symbolically smashing his top hat, considered one of his trademarks, signaling his retirement from movie musicals, which he announced following the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\nA brash American film producer, Steve Canfield, wants Russian composer Peter Illyich Boroff to write music for his next picture, which is being made in Paris. However, when the composer expresses his wish to stay in Paris, three comically bumbling operatives, Brankov, Bibinski, and Ivanov, are sent from Moscow to take Boroff back.\n\nCanfield manages to corrupt them with decadent western luxuries (champagne, women, nightclubs, etc.) and talks them into allowing Boroff to stay. He also arranges for his leading lady, Peggy Dayton, to \"convince\" Boroff to cooperate.\n\nFearful of his own precarious position, a commissar at the Ministry in Moscow summons a dedicated and humorless, fanatical operative, Nina \"Ninotchka\" Yoschenko, to bring all four men back home. Canfield succeeds in romancing her, despite her determination not to fall prey to the decadent attractions of Paris. He even proposes marriage. She and Boroff are horrified when they realize what changes have been made to Boroff's music. They decide to return to Moscow.\n\nCanfield does not give up, arranging for the pliable Brankov, Bibinski, and Ivanov to be sent back to Paris, knowing that they will be seduced again by the city's charms. Ninotchka is sent after them, giving Canfield time to convince her to give in to her love for him.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Cyd Charisse in Silk Stockings trailer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cyd Charisse]] as Ninotchka Yoschenko in ''Silk Stockings'']]\n* [[Fred Astaire]] as Steve Canfield\n* [[Cyd Charisse]] as Ninotchka Yoschenko\n* [[Janis Paige]] as Peggy Dayton\n* [[Peter Lorre]] as Brankov\n* [[Jules Munshin]] as Bibinski\n* [[Joseph Buloff]] as Ivanov\n* [[George Tobias]] as Vassili Markovitch, Commisar of Art\n* [[Wim Sonneveld]] as Peter Ilyitch Boroff\n\n==Songs==\nMusic and lyrics by Cole Porter.\n* \"Too Bad\"\n* \"Paris Loves Lovers\"\n* \"Stereophonic Sound\"\n* \"It's a Chemical Reaction, That's All\"\n* \"[[All of You (Cole Porter song)|All of You]]\"\n* \"Satin and Silk\"\n* \"Without Love\"\n* \"Fated to Be Mated\"\n* \"Josephine\"\n* \"Siberia\"\n* \"The Red Blues\"\n* \"The Ritz Roll and Rock\"\n\n==Production==\nMGM bought the film rights to the musical for $300,000.
