Directed and co-written by [[Spike Lee]], the film stars [[Denzel Washington]] in the title role, as well as [[Angela Bassett]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Al Freeman Jr.]], and [[Delroy Lindo]]. Lee has a supporting role, while [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]], the Rev. [[Al Sharpton]], and future South African president [[Nelson Mandela]] make [[cameo appearance]]s. It is the second of four film collaborations between Washington and Lee.\n\n''Malcolm X's'' screenplay, co-credited to Lee and [[Arnold Perl]], is based largely on [[Alex Haley]]'s 1965 book, ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]''. Haley collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X's death. The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his [[Prison|incarceration]], his [[conversion to Islam]], his ministry as a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to [[Betty Shabazz|Betty X]], his [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] and reevaluation of his views concerning [[White people|whites]], and his [[Assassination of Malcolm X|assassination]] on February 21, 1965.  Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], and his experiences with racism are dramatized in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.\n\n''Malcolm X'' was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and released on November 18, 1992. Denzel Washington won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hollywood Blockbusters, Independent Films and Shorts Selected for 2010 National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-10-273/2010-national-film-registry-announced/2010-12-28/|access-date=2020-12-04|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=February 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228035318/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-10-273/2010-national-film-registry-announced/2010-12-28/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-12-04|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305191832/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. As of June 20, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 698 words. -->\n[[Malcolm X|Malcolm Little]] is raised in a poor household in rural [[Michigan]] by his Caribbean mother and African-American father. When Malcolm is a young boy, their house is burnt down and his father, an activist for black rights, is killed by a chapter of the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]]. His death is registered as a suicide and the family receives no compensation. Malcolm's mother's mental state deteriorates and she is admitted to a [[mental institution]]. Malcolm and his siblings are put into protective care. Malcolm performs well in school and dreams of being a lawyer, but his teacher discourages it due to his skin color.\n\nIn 1944, Malcolm, now a teenager, lives in [[Boston]]. One night, he catches the attention of the white Sophia, and the two begin dating. Malcolm travels to [[Harlem]] with Sophia, where he meets \"West Indian\" Archie, a gangster who runs a local [[numbers game]], at a bar. The two become friends and start co-operating an illegal numbers racket. One night at a club, Malcolm claims to have bet on a winning number; Archie disputes this, denying him a large sum of money. A conflict ensues between the two and Malcolm returns to Boston after an attempt on his life. Malcolm, Sophia, Malcolm's friend Shorty, and a woman named Peg decide to perform robberies to earn money.\n\nBy 1946, the group has accrued a large amount of money from thievery. However, they are later arrested. The two girls are sentenced to two years as first offenders in connection with the robberies, while Malcolm and Shorty are sentenced to 8\u201310 years in jail. While incarcerated, Malcolm meets Baines, a member of the [[Nation of Islam]], who directs him to the teachings of the group's leader [[Elijah Muhammad]]. Malcolm grows interested in the [[Muslim]] religion and lifestyle promoted by the group, and begins to resent white people for mistreating his race. Malcolm is [[parole]]d from prison in 1952 after serving six years, and travels to the Nation of Islam's headquarters in [[Chicago]]. There, he meets Muhammad, who instructs Malcolm to replace his surname \"Little\" with \"X\", which symbolizes his lost African surname that was taken from his ancestors by white slavemasters; he is rechristened as \"Malcolm X\".\n\nMalcolm returns to Harlem and begins to preach the Nation's message; over time, his speeches gather large crowds of onlookers. Malcolm proposes ideas such as African-American separation from white Americans. In 1958, Malcolm meets nurse [[Betty Shabazz|Betty Sanders]]. The two begin dating, quickly marry and become the parents of four daughters. Several years later, Malcolm is now in a high position as the spokesperson of the Nation of Islam. During this time, Malcolm learns that Muhammad had fathered numerous children out of wedlock, contradicting his teachings and Islam.\n\nAfter President [[John F. Kennedy]] is assassinated in November 1963, Malcolm comments that the assassination was the product of the white violence that has been prevalent in America since its founding, comparing the killing to \"the chickens coming home to roost.\" This statement damages Malcolm's reputation and Muhammad suspends him from speaking to the press or at temples for 90 days. In early 1964, Malcolm goes on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] where he meets Muslims from all races, including white. Malcolm, having lost his faith in the Nation of Islam, publicly announces that is founding the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]], which teaches tolerance instead of racial separation. He is exiled from the Nation of Islam, and his house is firebombed in early 1965.\n\nOn February 21, 1965, Malcolm prepares to speak before a crowd at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] in Harlem, but tragically, disciples of the Nation of Islam shoot him several times. One of Malcolm's bodyguards shoots one of the shooters, [[Thomas Hagan]], in the leg before a furious crowd beats Hagan. Malcolm is transported to a hospital, but is pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nThe film concludes with a series of clips showing the aftermath of Malcolm's death. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivers a eulogy to Malcolm, and [[Ossie Davis]] recites a speech at Malcolm's funeral. [[Nelson Mandela]] delivers a speech to a school, quoting an excerpt from one of Malcolm's speeches.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Denzel Washington cropped 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Denzel Washington (pictured in 2000) portrays Malcolm X.]]\n{{cast list|\n*[[Denzel Washington]] as [[Malcolm X]], a former petty criminal and convict, Nation of Islam (NOI) minister and activist for [[African Americans]].\n*[[Angela Bassett]] as [[Betty Shabazz]], a nurse and NOI activist who marries Malcolm.\n*[[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]] as Baines, the convict who mentors Malcolm and converts him to Islam.\n*[[Al Freeman Jr.]] as [[Elijah Muhammad]], the leader of the [[Nation of Islam]].\n*[[Delroy Lindo]] as West Indian Archie, a [[Harlem]] gangster and who runs a local [[numbers game]] and takes a young Malcolm under his wing.\n*[[Spike Lee]] as Shorty, Malcolm's childhood friend.\n*[[Theresa Randle]] as Laura, a young Malcolm's romantic interest.\n*[[Kate Vernon]] as Sophia, Malcolm's lover as a younger criminal.\n* [[Ernest Lee Thomas]] as Sidney, a member of the [[Fruit of Islam]] and relative of Elijah Muhammad assigned to protect Malcolm.\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Chaplain Gill, prison chaplain.\n* [[Lonette McKee]] as [[Louise Little (activist)|Louise Little]], Malcolm's mother.\n* [[Tommy Hollis]] as Earl Little, Malcolm's father, a reverend and vocal activist who is murdered by the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]].\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as [[Thomas Hagan|Talmadge X Hayer]], an NOI member who is part of the five-man group that assassinates Malcolm.\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Ben Thomas, a member of the assassination team who supervises the plot.\n* [[Leonard L.

Here's a guy who essentially led so many lives. He pulled himself out of the gutter. He went from country boy to hipster and semi-hoodlum. From there he went to prison, where he became a Muslim. Then he was a spiritual leader who evolved into a humanitarian.\"\u2014 Producer Marvin Worth on his 25-year effort to make a film about the life of Malcolm X.<ref name=NYT112392a>Bernard Weinraub, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DF143FF930A15752C1A964958260 A Movie Producer Remembers The Human Side of Malcolm X] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515033513/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/23/movies/a-movie-producer-remembers-the-human-side-of-malcolm-x.html |date=May 15, 2021 }}, ''The New York Times'', November 23, 1992; retrieved June 18, 2008.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nProducer [[Marvin Worth]] acquired the rights to ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' in 1967. Worth had met Malcolm X, then called \"Detroit Red,\" as a teenager selling drugs in New York City. Worth was fifteen at the time, and spending time around [[jazz]] clubs in the area. As Worth remembers: \"He was selling grass.  He was sixteen or seventeen but looked older. He was very witty, a funny guy, and he had this extraordinary charisma. A great dancer and a great dresser. He was very good-looking, very, very tall. Girls always noticed him. He was quite a special guy.\"<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\nEarly on, the production had difficulties telling the entire story, in part due to unresolved questions surrounding Malcolm X's assassination.  In 1971, Worth made a well-received documentary, ''[[Malcolm X (1972 film)|Malcolm X]]'', which received an [[Academy Award]] nomination [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|in that category]]. The project remained unrealized. However, several major entertainers were attached to it at various times, including [[Richard Pryor]], [[Eddie Murphy]], and director [[Sidney Lumet]].<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nIn 1968, Worth commissioned a screenplay from novelist [[James Baldwin]], who was later joined by [[Arnold Perl]], a screenwriter who had been a victim of [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]]-era [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]].<ref name=NYT111592>Sheila Rule, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DF173BF936A25752C1A964958260 FILM; Malcolm X: The Facts, the Fictions, the Film] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305030546/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DF173BF936A25752C1A964958260 |date=March 5, 2016 }}, ''The New York Times'', November 15, 1992; accessed May 23, 2008.</ref> However, the screenplay took longer to develop than anticipated. Perl died in 1971.<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\nBaldwin developed his work on the screenplay into the 1972 book ''One Day, When I Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's The Autobiography of Malcolm X''. In 1976, Baldwin wrote of his experience, \"I think that I would rather be horsewhipped, or incarcerated in the forthright bedlam of Bellevue, than repeat the adventure\".<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Baldwin |author-link=James Baldwin |title=[[The Devil Finds Work]] |year=1976 |publisher=The Dial Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8037-1916-7 |page=95 }}</ref> Baldwin died in 1987.

Due to the revisions, the Baldwin family asked the producer to take his name off the credits. Thus ''Malcolm X'' only credits Perl and Lee as the writers and Malcolm X and Alex Haley as the authors of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''.<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\n=== Production difficulties ===\nThe production was considered controversial long before filming began.  The crux of the controversy was Malcolm X's denunciation of whites before he undertook his [[hajj]].  He was, arguably, not well regarded among white citizens by and large; however, he had risen to become a hero in the African-American community and a symbol of blacks' struggles, particularly during the presidencies of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].  In the three years before the movie's release, sales of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' had increased 300 percent, and four of his books had a nine-fold increase in sales between 1986 and 1991.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>\n\nOnce Warner Bros. agreed to the project, they initially wanted [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated Canadian film director [[Norman Jewison]] to direct the film. Jewison, director of the seminal civil rights film ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', was able to bring Denzel Washington into the project to play Malcolm X. Jewison and Washington previously worked together in the 1984 film ''[[A Soldier's Story]]''. A protest erupted over the fact that a white director was slated to make the film.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/> Spike Lee was one of the main voices of criticism; since college, he had considered a film adaptation of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' to be a dream project. Lee and others felt that it was appropriate that only a black person should direct ''Malcolm X.<ref name=OnionAV>Scott Tobias, [http://www.avclub.com/review/malcolm-x-11023 Malcolm X] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225040228/http://www.avclub.com/review/malcolm-x-11023 |date=February 25, 2014 }}, The Onion A/V Club, February 15, 2005, Retrieved February 19, 2014.</ref>''\n\nAfter the public outcry against Jewison, Worth concluded that \"it needed a black director at this point. It was insurmountable the other way...There's a grave responsibility here.\" Jewison left the project, though he noted he gave up the movie not because of the protest, but because he could not reconcile Malcolm's private and public lives and was unsatisfied with Charles Fuller's script. Lee confirmed Jewison's position, stating, \"If Norman actually thought he could do it, he would have really fought me. But he bowed out gracefully.\" Jewison and Denzel Washington would reunite several years later for ''[[The Hurricane (1999 film)|The Hurricane]]'', in which Washington played imprisoned boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter]], who spent nearly twenty years in prison for a murder he claimed he did not commit before his conviction was overturned in 1985.\n\nSpike Lee was soon named the director, and he substantially edited the script. \"I'm directing this movie and I rewrote the script, and I'm an artist and there's just no two ways around it: this film about Malcolm X is going to be my vision of Malcolm X. But it's not like I'm sitting atop a mountain saying, 'Screw everyone, this is the Malcolm I see.' I've done the research, I've talked to the people who were there.\"<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/> Soon after Spike Lee was announced as the director and before its release, ''Malcolm X'' received criticism by [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]] and members of the United Front to Preserve the Legacy of Malcolm X, headed by poet and playwright [[Amiri Baraka]], who were worried about Lee's portrayal of Malcolm X.  One protest in Harlem drew over 200 people.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=NYT080991>Evelyn Nieves, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DF123FF93AA3575BC0A967958260& Malcolm X: Firestorm Over a Film Script] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515033515/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/09/nyregion/malcolm-x-firestorm-over-a-film-script.html |date=May 15, 2021 }}, ''The New York Times'', August 9, 1991; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref>  Some based their opinion on dislike of Lee's previous films; others were concerned that he would focus on Malcolm X's life before he converted to Islam.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=\"NYT080991\"/><ref name=NYT052092>Lena Williams, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DB1338F933A15756C0A964958260 Spike Lee Says Money From Blacks Saved 'X'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515033516/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/20/movies/spike-lee-says-money-from-blacks-saved-x.html |date=May 15, 2021 }}, ''The New York Times'', May 20, 1992; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref> Baraka bluntly accused Spike Lee of being a \"[[Buppie]]\", stating \"We will not let Malcolm X's life be trashed to make middle-class Negroes sleep easier\", compelling others to write the director and warn him \"not to mess up Malcolm's life.\"<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>  Some, including Lee himself, noted the irony that many of the arguments made against him mirrored those made against Norman Jewison.<ref name=\"NYT080991\"/>\n\nAlthough Washington agreed to play Malcolm X while [[Norman Jewison]] was scheduled to direct the film, Lee stated he never envisioned any actor other than Washington in the role. The two had previously worked together on ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'' (1990), and Lee noted that Washington had \"really captured Malcolm\" in his [[Off Broadway]] performance as him.<ref name=NYT102592>Lena Williams, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D81F30F936A15753C1A964958260 Playing With Fire] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605102401/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D81F30F936A15753C1A964958260 |date=June 5, 2008 }}, ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 25, 1992; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Budget issues===\nSpike Lee also encountered difficulty in securing a sufficient budget.  Lee told Warner Bros. and the [[Completion guarantee|bond company]] that a budget of over US$30&nbsp;million was necessary; the studio disagreed and offered a lower amount.  Following advice from fellow director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], Lee got \"the movie company pregnant\": taking the movie far enough along into actual [[Filmmaking#Production|production]] to attempt to force the studio to increase the budget.<ref name=\"OnionAV\"/> The film, initially budgeted at $28&nbsp;million, climbed to nearly $33&nbsp;million. Lee contributed $2&nbsp;million of his own $3&nbsp;million salary. Completion Bond Company, which assumed financial control in January 1992, refused to approve any more expenditures; in addition, the studio and bond company instructed Lee that the film could be no longer than two hours, fifteen minutes in length.<ref name=\"NYT052092\"/> The resulting conflict caused the project to be shut down in [[Filmmaking#Post-production|post-production]].<ref name=\"OnionAV\"/>\n\nThe film was saved by the financial intervention of prominent black Americans, some of whom appear in the film: [[Bill Cosby]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Tracy Chapman]], and [[Peggy Cooper Cafritz]], founder of the [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]].  Their contributions were made as donations; as Lee noted: \"This is not a loan. They are not investing in the film. These are black folks with some money who came to the rescue of the movie. As a result, this film will be my version. Not the bond company's version, not Warner Brothers'. I will do the film the way it ought to be, and it will be over three hours.\"<ref name=\"NYT052092\"/>  The actions of such prominent members of the African American community giving their money helped finish the project as Lee envisioned it.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=\"OnionAV\"/>\n\nThe dissatisfaction Warner Bros. had for how Lee funded the film by completing it through the help of his African American friends later resulted in Warner Bros. blocking out Lee from participating in the development of ''[[Space Jam]]'', as Lee had approached [[Joe Pytka]] about polishing the film's script.<ref name = \"2021EW\">{{cite magazine|last=Lawrence|first=Derek|date=November 15, 2016|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/11/15/space-jam-20th-anniversary-joe-pytka/|title=''Space Jam'': The story behind Michael Jordan's improbable victory|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=April 11, 2021|archive-date=April 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210409211918/https://ew.com/article/2016/11/15/space-jam-20th-anniversary-joe-pytka/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Request for black interviewers===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"I'm doing what every other person in Hollywood does: they dictate who they want to do interviews with.

The request proved controversial.  While it was common practice for celebrities to pick interviewers who were known to be sympathetic to them, it was the first time in many years in which race had been used as a qualification.  Lee clarified that he was not barring white interviewers from interviewing him, but that he felt, given the subject matter of the film, that black writers have \"more insight about Malcolm than white writers.\"<ref name=\"NYT102992\"/>\n\nThe request was turned down by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', but several others agreed including ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  The ''Los Angeles Times'' explained they did not give writer approval.  The editor of ''Premiere'' noted that the request created internal discussions that resulted in changes at the magazine: \"Had we had a history of putting a lot of black writers on stories about the movie industry we'd be in a stronger position. But we didn't. It was an interesting challenge he laid down. It caused some personnel changes. We've hired a black writer and a black editor.\"<ref name=\"NYT102992\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nMalcolm X's widow, Dr. Betty Shabazz, served as a consultant to the film.<ref name=\"NYT080991\"/>  The [[Fruit of Islam]], the defense arm of the Nation of Islam, provided security for the movie.<ref name=\"NYT102592\"/>\n\nWhen Denzel Washington took the role of Malcolm X in the play, ''When the Chickens Come Home to Roost'', which dealt with the relationship between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, he admitted he knew little about Malcolm X and had not yet read ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''.  Washington prepared by reading books and articles by and about Malcolm X and went over hours of tape and film footage of speeches.  The play opened in 1981 and earned Washington a warm review by [[Frank Rich]], who was at the time the chief theater critic of ''[[The New York Times]]''. Upon being cast in the film, he interviewed people who knew Malcolm X, among them Betty Shabazz and two of his brothers. Although they had different upbringings, Washington tried to focus on what he had in common with his character: during the making of the movie Washington was close to Malcolm X's age when he was assassinated, both men were from large families, both of their fathers were ministers, and both were raised primarily by their mothers.<ref name=\"NYT102592\"/>\n\n''Malcolm X'' is the first non-documentary, and the first American film, to be given permission to film in [[Mecca]] (or within the [[Masjid al-Haram|Haram Sharif]]). A second unit film crew was hired to film in Mecca because non-Muslims, such as Lee, are not allowed inside the city. Lee fought very hard to get filming in Mecca but Warner Bros. initially refused to put up the money for location shooting. New Jersey was considered for filming the Mecca segments. In the end, Lee got money and permission together for filming in Mecca.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spike Lee: interviews|last=Spike|first=Lee|date=2002|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|editor-last=Fuchs|editor-first=Cynthia|isbn=1578064708|location=Jackson|oclc=48163614}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Nelson Mandela, the film featured cameos by [[Christopher Plummer]] (as the prison's Catholic chaplain), [[Peter Boyle]] (as a police officer), [[William Kunstler]] (as a judge), as well as activists [[Al Sharpton]] and [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]] (as street preachers).<ref name=NYT111892>Vincent Canby, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8173CF93BA25752C1A964958260 Review/Film; 'Malcolm X', as Complex as Its Subject] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210515033514/https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/18/movies/review-film-malcolm-x-as-complex-as-its-subject.html |date=May 15, 2021 }}, ''The New York Times'', November 18, 1992, Retrieved May 23, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe film was made shortly after Mandela's 1990 release from prison and during the [[negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa]].
