The plot is loosely based on a short story about [[Nie Xiaoqian]] from [[Qing dynasty]] writer [[Pu Songling]]'s ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' and is also inspired by the 1960 [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] film ''[[The Enchanting Shadow]]''. The film was popular in Hong Kong and several Asian countries, including [[South Korea]] and Japan. Although the film could not gain access to movie theaters in mainland China when it was first released, it became a [[cult film]] among young people in the mainland. At that time the film generated a phenomenal cult following among audiences, especially the generation born in the 1980s. In 2011, the Hong Kong producers screened a restored version officially in mainland China.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Hongjian |date=2018-05-04 |title=''A Chinese Ghost Story'': A Hong Kong comedy film's cult following in Mainland China |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17508061.2018.1475968 |journal=Journal of Chinese Cinemas |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013157 |doi=10.1080/17508061.2018.1475968 |issn=1750-8061}}</ref>\n\nMost notably{{according to whom|date=July 2020}} it boosted the stardom of Joey Wong, won Leslie Cheung popularity in Japan,{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} and sparked a trend of folklore ghost films in the [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong film industry]],{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} including two sequels, an animated film, a television series and a 2011 remake. The film was ranked number 50 of the [[Hong Kong Film Award#Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures|Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures]] presented at the [[24th Hong Kong Film Awards]], the Special Jury Special Award of the 16th French Science Fiction Film Festival and the Best Film Award of the Portuguese Science Fiction Film Festival.\n\n==Plot==\nNing Choi-san, a timid debt collector, goes to a rural town to collect debts but fails and runs out of money. He has no choice but to take shelter in a deserted temple in the forest on the outskirts of the town. That night, he meets a beautiful and alluring young maiden, [[Nie Xiaoqian|Nip Siu-sin]], and falls in love with her. In the morning, however, after he recalls that night's events, he becomes increasingly fearful and superstitious because Yin Chik-ha, a [[Taoist priest]], told him that the people he saw in the temple are ghosts. That night, he returns to the temple and confirms his theory that Nip is actually a ghost.\n\nNip tells Ning her story of how she became eternally bound to the servitude of a sinister Tree Demoness. She explains that as long as her remains are buried at the foot of the tree, her spirit will be forever enslaved by the Tree Demoness. Ning attempts to free her from her suffering so he seeks help from Yin Chik-ha. Yin fights with the Tree Demoness and attempts to free Nip's soul but fails. As punishment for betraying her master, Nip's soul is banished to the [[Diyu|Underworld]].\n\nNing is unwilling to give up on Nip and he insists that Yin help him. Yin reluctantly opens a temporary portal into the Underworld and brings Ning along to search for Nip. As the Underworld is full of spirits, they have a hard time finding her. Ning and Nip are eventually able to see each other briefly near dawn when they manage to leave the Underworld. When sunlight shines on the urn containing Nip's cremated remains, Ning uses a curtain to shield the urn to prevent Nip's soul from being destroyed by exposure to sunlight. Before leaving for good, she tells him that the only way to save her soul is to rebury her remains at a more auspicious burial site. Ning follows her instructions and, acting on Yin's advice, he buries her remains near the crest of a hill. He burns a [[joss stick]] for her and prays for her soul while Yin watches solemnly behind him.\n\nNing and Yin are then seen riding off seeking a new adventure, with rainbow visible in the sky above them.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Leslie Cheung]] as Ning Choi-san\n*[[Joey Wong]] as [[Nip Siu-sin]]\n*[[Wu Ma]] as Yin Chik-ha\n*Lau Siu-ming as the Tree Demoness\n*Lam Wai as Hsia-hou\n*Xue Zhilun as Siu-ching\n*[[Wong Jing]] as the magistrate\n*[[David Wu (Hong Kong actor)|David Wu]] as Secretary Chiu\n\n==Production==\nProducer [[Tsui Hark]] was interested in creating ''A Chinese Ghost Story'' as early as 1978, where he suggested it as a television production at [[TVB]].{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=74}} The producer turned it down, feeling it would not be suitable for television.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=74}} ''A Chinese Ghost Story'' uses elements of several stories from [[Pu Songling]]'s 17th century collection ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]''.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=72}} Tsui Hark stated that they changed a lot of the stories for their adaptation as they found out the stories were against their initial interpretation.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} On developing the film, Tsui Hark noted that director [[Ching Siu-tung]] wanted to work with him.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Ching Siu-tung had previously worked as a director and an action choreographer on various [[Film Workshop]] productions such as ''[[Peking Opera Blues]]'' and ''[[A Better Tomorrow II]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=111}} Hark suggested developing ''A Chinese Ghost Story'', describing it as a love story which Siu-tung was not as interested in developing as either a romance film or a non-horror based ghost story.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Hark noted that his higher up approached him to develop the film into being about a female cop, not being aware that it was based on a book or that it was a period film.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} While working on the film, Hark and Siu-tung did not really know what it would end up being like, as Siu-tung was still apprehensive on creating a romance film and desired to add horror film elements.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Rumours persist around the production suggesting that Tsui Hark effectively directed the film.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=111}} British critic [[Tony Rayns]] stated that effectively, most Film Workshop productions were \"redirected or hijacked by Tsui Hark\"{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=111}} [[Joey Wong]] was a professional basketball player and model before starting her film career.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} Prior to working on the film, she appeared in films such as the Taiwanese production ''It'll Be Very Cold at the Lakeside This Year''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} She would show up in a few [[Shaw Brothers]] produced Hong Kong films and Tsui Hark's film ''Working Class''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}}\n\nActors in the film include [[Leslie Cheung]] who was also a cantopop singer.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} Cheung had previously worked with Tsui Hark productions such as ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[A Better Tomorrow II]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}}  Cheung also sung the films theme song.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} [[Wu Ma]] had previously appeared in several Hong Kong horror film productions such as ''[[Spooky Encounters]]'', ''The Dead and the Deadly'' and ''[[Mr. Vampire]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} The film used the services of Cinefex Workshop, Hong Kong's first proper special effects studio who had previously worked on Hark's film ''[[Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain]]''.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} The film script called for a giant slithering tongue and zombies, which were developed by Cinefex technician Man Xian Liang, who taught himself stop motion animation in order to make the effects happen.{{sfn|O'Brien|2003|p=112}} [[James Wong (lyricist)|James Wong]] contributed to the score of the film.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}} Wong was primarily known for writing songs for pop stars and television programs and completed his first score for Hark's ''[[Shanghai Blues]]''.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=75}}\n\n==Release==\n''A Chinese Ghost Story'' opened on July 18, 1987.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=70}} The film received theatrical release throughout Asia and Europe.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=71}} The film also received international recognition when it won the special Jury Prize at the Avoriaz festival in France and the Best Film Award at the Opporto Festival in Portugal in 1987.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=74}}\n\n===Box office===\n''A Chinese Ghost Story'' performed well at the Hong Kong box office, earning {{HK$}}18,831,638 ({{US$|{{#expr:18831638/7.798 round 0}}|link=yes}}) and becoming 1987's fifteenth highest-grossing film in Hong Kong.{{sfn|Morton|2001|p=74}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) -
