Based in part on Spike Lee's experiences as a [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] student in the [[Atlanta University Center]] during the 1970s, it is a story about [[undergraduates]] in a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] clashing with some of their classmates at a [[historically black college]] during homecoming weekend. It also touches upon issues of [[colorism]], [[elitism]], [[classism]], [[political activism]], [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|hazing]], [[groupthink]], [[self-esteem|female self-esteem]], [[social mobility]], and [[Discrimination based on hair texture|hair texture bias]] within the African-American community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/movies/spike-lee-appear-30th-anniversary-school-daze-screening-fox/eBmZTzjfJhRbPWxp2hNS2H/|title=Spike Lee to appear at 30th anniversary \u2018School Daze\u2019 screening at Fox|website=Ajc.com|access-date=November 15, 2021}}</ref> The second feature film by Spike Lee, ''School Daze'' was released on February 12, 1988 by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nVaughn \u201cDap\u201d Dunlap is a politically and socially conscious black student at Mission College, a leading [[historically black college]] in [[Atlanta]]. On [[homecoming]] weekend, Dap leads an [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid]] demonstration, demanding that the school [[Disinvestment from South Africa|divest from South Africa]], and feuds with Julian \u201cDean Big Brother Almighty\u201d Eaves, the head/president of Mission College's Gamma Phi Gamma [[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternity]] chapter.  Dap's younger cousin Darrell \u201cHalf-Pint\u201d, a Gamma [[Fraternities and sororities#Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)|pledge]], is ordered by Julian to bring a girl to the fraternity that night, and goes to Dap for advice.\n\nCedar Cloud, chairman of Mission's board of trustees, warns college president Harold McPherson that the divestment protests may scare off the school's wealthy donors. The Gamma Rays, the Gamma women's auxiliary led by Julian's girlfriend Jane Toussaint \u2013 mostly light-skinned black women with straightened hair \u2013 clash with some of their non-Greek classmates, including Dap's girlfriend Rachel Meadows \u2013 mostly dark-skinned black women with natural hair \u2013 over skin color and [[Discrimination based on hair texture|hair politics]]. Unsuccessful in courting any female students, Darrell and the pledges are [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|hazed]]. Dap and Rachel have a falling out when she plans to [[sorority recruitment|rush a sorority]], and she accuses him of [[colorism]].\n\nThe weekend's festivities begin, and the Gamma brothers nearly come to blows with Dap and his fellow protestors at the homecoming parade. After the Mission football team suffers an embarrassing loss, Cloud and McPherson threaten Dap with expulsion if he continues his activism. Dap and his friends drive into town to eat at [[KFC]], where they are [[town and gown|harassed by locals]] who resent them as privileged college boys. Returning to campus, Dap confronts Julian about Darrell's pledge status. At the Greeks\u2019 [[Stepping (African-American)#History|step show]], a performance by Dap and his friends leads to a brawl with the Gammas. Seeking out Rachel, Dap is humiliated by her dorm neighbors, but he and Rachel reconcile.\n\nDarrell and the Gamma pledges endure a grueling initiation and are welcomed as new members. At the school dance, Dap's roommate Grady hits it off with a female student and coaxes her to his room, but she refuses to stay when Dap and Rachel are already there. As the Gammas celebrate, Julian forces Jane to have sex with Darrell, but rejects her afterward. Darrell excitedly informs Dap, who is infuriated. At sunrise, Dap wakes the entire campus from the previous night's debauchery. A tearful Julian arrives and stands eye-to-eye with Dap, who breaks [[the fourth wall]] to tell the audience directly, \u201cPlease, wake up\u201d.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Laurence Fishburne]] (credited as Larry Fishburne) as Vaughn \"Dap\" Dunlap\n*[[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Julian \"Dean Big Brother Almighty\" Eaves\n*[[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]] as Jane Toussaint\n*[[Kyme (actress)|Kyme]] as Rachel Meadows\n*[[Joe Seneca]] as President Harold McPherson\n*[[Ellen Holly]] as Odrie McPherson\n*[[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]] as Cedar Cloud\n*[[Ossie Davis]] as Coach Odom\n*[[Bill Nunn]] as Grady\n*[[Branford Marsalis]] as Jordan\n*[[Kadeem Hardison]] as Edge\n*[[Spike Lee]] as Darrell \"Half-Pint\" Dunlap\n*[[Darryl M.

In the film, Dap and his politically-conscious friends, collectively known as \"the fellas\", come from [[American lower class|lower-class]] backgrounds and are [[First-generation college students in the United States|first-generation college students]], and their rivals \"The Gammas\" are the elitist, traditionalist, [[Upper middle class in the United States|upper-middle class]] children of successful Mission College alumni. The two groups and their ideologies constantly clash throughout the film until the very end. \n\n==Production==\nProduction began on March 9, 1987 and ended on May 4, 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/59106|title=AFI&#124;Catalog|website=Catalog.afi.com|access-date=November 15, 2021}}</ref> Spike Lee arranged for the two groups of actors to stay in separate hotels during filming. The actors playing the \"wannabees\" were given better accommodations than the ones playing the \"jigaboos.\" This favoritism contributed to tension on the set, which showed in the on-camera animosity between the two camps.<ref name=\"castcommentary\">{{cite video\n  | people = Campbell, Tisha; Cundieff, Rusty, Nunn, Bill; Bell, Darryl M.\n  | title = Audio commentary for ''School Daze''.\n  | medium = DVD\n  | publisher = Sony Pictures Home Entertainment\n  | date = 2005}}</ref> (Similar tactics were used during the filming of ''[[Animal House]]'' and ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]''.) In ''School Daze,'' the method approach yielded strong results&nbsp;\u2014 the fight that occurs at the [[Stepping (African-American)|step show]] between Dap's crew and the Gammas was not in the script. On the day the scene was shot, the fight broke out between the two sides. Lee ordered the cameras to keep rolling.<ref name=\"castcommentary\" />\n\nOfficials of [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]], [[Spelman College|Spelman]], and [[Clark Atlanta University]] asked Lee to stop filming on the campuses before he completed his work because the colleges' Boards of Directors had concerns on how he was portraying the [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black colleges]] in the film.<ref name=\"castcommentary\" /> Lee had to finish filming at the neighboring [[Morris Brown College]].<ref name=\"castcommentary\" />\n\n[[Ruth E. Carter]] designed the costumes for the film, inspired by uniforms and styles worn at the HBCUs. At Lee's encouragement, she commissioned American fashion designer [[Willi Smith]] to design the gowns for the Homecoming Court in the film.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews for its exploration of issues within the black community. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' noted, \"There is no doubt in my mind that 'School Daze,' in its own way, is one of the most honest and revealing movies I've ever seen about modern middle-class black life in America.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/school-daze-1988 |author-link=Roger Ebert |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=School Daze |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher = Ebert Digital LLC |date= February 12, 1988 |access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref> He also noted its frank exploration of issues of discrimination within the black community related to skin tone and nature of hair. He said it was significant as a film with a \"completely black orientation. All of the characters, good and bad, are black, and all of the character's references are to each other.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\"/>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 57%, based on 28 reviews, and an average rating of 5.9/10. The critical consensus reads: \"''School Daze'' is undeniably messy, but thought-provoking themes, strong performances, and Spike Lee's ingratiating energy help tie it all together.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/school_daze |title=School Daze (1988) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=May 11, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n[[Kadeem Hardison]], [[Darryl M.
