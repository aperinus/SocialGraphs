The plot line centers around a \"mutual dare\" that is introduced at a party, which involves the two main characters engaging in a pornographic film together. The film was shot on-location in [[Washington state]] around Seattle from September 2008 to January 2009, and much of the dialogue for the film was improvised.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Putting a Bromance to an Erotic Test|first=Stephen|last=Holden|authorlink=Stephen Holden|date=July 9, 2009|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/movies/10hump.html?_r=0}}</ref>\n\nHump Day received positive critical reception and won the 2009 Sundance Film Festival \"Special Jury Prize for Spirit of Independence,\" award among other awards.\n\nIn 2012, a remake in French entitled ''[[Do Not Disturb (2012 film)|Do Not Disturb]]'' was released.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Seattle]] during the late-2000s, two [[heterosexual]] male friends Ben (Duplass) and Andrew (Leonard) meet after having not seen each other for 10 years. During a party, they find themselves locked in a \"mutual dare\" situation engaging to make a [[gay pornography|gay pornographic film]], including [[anal sex]], as an \"art project\" between two straight guys and submit it to the [[HUMP! (film festival)|HUMP! film festival]], an annual amateur pornography contest put on by the underground newspaper ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''. They do not decide yet who will penetrate whom. Ben tells Andrew that he will discuss the project with his wife Anna (Delmore), an otherwise introverted record store clerk at [[Easy Street Records]]. As Ben begins to describe the project to Anna, she reacts skeptically at the mere mention of amateur pornography. Ben finds himself lying to Anna; he talks about the project with only vague detail, telling her that he will likely act as a behind-the-scenes assistant to the hypothetical film crew.\n\nLater, after a raunchy debate with her coworkers about the contest, Anna finds herself alone with Andrew and suggests that they have a drink together in an effort to get to know one another. Now drunk, the two begin discussing Ben and Andrew's art project, Andrew assuming that Ben has completely informed Anna of their intentions. After Andrew bluntly reveals that Ben will potentially have a gay experience, Anna becomes upset and confused, confronting Ben personally. The next morning, Ben insists that he still wants to go through with the project, and Anna consents.\n\nBen and Andrew meet in a hotel, bringing a video camera. Their attempts to have sex are prolonged by lengthy discussions and frequent analyzing of how to approach the experience. Although they film themselves kissing each other on the mouth, and [[hug]]ging each other in their underpants, neither Ben nor Andrew appears comfortable becoming completely naked, let alone having sex. The two continue to talk, not sure if either one will be able to achieve an erection, and begin to question the validity of their experiment as a work of art. Ben finally suggests that they call off the project, and the two laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. Ben leaves the hotel, intending to apologize to Anna. Andrew prepares to leave shortly afterward, but not before reviewing the footage that the two have recorded.\n\n==Cast==\nIn addition to Duplass and Leonard, the film features appearances from multiple indie musicians based out of [[Capital Hill, Seattle|Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood]] in the late 2000s as well as noted Seattle icons Ken Schram, Dan Savage and [[Artis the Spoonman|the Spoonman]].\n* [[Mark Duplass]] as Ben\n* [[Joshua Leonard]] as Andrew\n* [[Alycia Delmore]] as Anna\n* [[Lynn Shelton]] as Monica\n* Trina Willard as Lily\n* Tyler Swenson as Teddy\n* [[The Long Winters|John Roderick]] as Mitch\n* Kelly Swanson as Jennifer\n* Leon Allen as Lenny\n* [[Tori Black|Michelle Chapman]] as Shelley\n* Kyle Stump as Peter\n* [[Forgive Durden|Thomas Patton III]] as Josh\n* Brittany Brown as Gwen\n* [[Ken Schram]] as Ben's father\n* [[Dan Savage]] as himself (cameo)\n* [[Jim Page (singer)|Jim Page]] as himself (cameo)\n* [[Mark Arm]] as himself (cameo)\n\n==Reception==\n''Humpday'' received positive reviews from critics.
