It is the first animated film in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in film|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' film franchise]]. Written and directed by [[Kevin Munroe]] (in his feature directorial debut), the film stars the voices of [[James Arnold Taylor]], [[Nolan North]], [[Mikey Kelley]], [[Mitchell Whitfield]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Mako (actor)|Mako]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Patrick Stewart]], and [[Zhang Ziyi]] with narration by [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\nThe film sees the four turtles ([[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], and [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]]) having grown apart after their final defeat of their arch-enemy, [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]], but are set to reunite and overcome their faults to save the world as evil ancient creatures threaten it.\n\n''TMNT'' was released theatrically in the United States on March 23, 2007, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was a small commercial success, grossing $95 million worldwide against a budget of $34 million. Planned sequels were cancelled after [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]] acquired the franchise in 2009, rebooting the film series with a [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|new film]] in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn ancient times, warlord Yaotl opens a portal into a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that grants him immortality and petrifies his four generals. The portal also releases thirteen immortal monsters that destroy his army and his enemies while becoming famous mythical monsters as centuries pass.\n\nIn the present, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles grow apart after defeating [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]]. For training, [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Master Splinter]] sends [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] to [[Central America]], where he becomes the protector of a village. [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] works as an [[Information technology|IT]] specialist, [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] works as a birthday party entertainer, and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] continues to fight crime as a masked [[vigilante]] known as the Nightwatcher, which he keeps a secret. The Turtles' old friend [[April O'Neil]] now operates a shipping company that acquires relics for collectors, assisted by her boyfriend, [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]].\n\nAfter traveling to Central America for work, April tells Leo his brothers have drifted apart. She then returns to [[New York City]] with a statue for wealthy tycoon Max Winters. Winters hires Shredder's former second-in-command, [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]] and her ninja [[Foot Clan]] to search the city for the thirteen monsters before the portal opens again. Casey figures out Raph's double identity and joins him in hunting criminals. Winters, who is actually Yaotl, reanimates his four stone generals using technology created by his company.\n\nLeo returns to the Turtles' sewer lair, reuniting with his family. Splinter forbids them from fighting crime until they can act as a team again. While training, the Turtles encounter one of the thirteen beasts, [[Bigfoot]]. They engage Bigfoot, disobeying Splinter's orders, and come into conflict with the Foot Clan in the process. While the Turtles and ninja fight, a fleeing Bigfoot is captured by the generals. The next day, Splinter admonishes his sons for their disobedience. Raphael later visits Casey, and they encounter Vampire Succubor, another one of the monsters. They witness its capture by the Foot and the Stone Generals but are spotted. Despite a successful escape, Raph is rendered unconscious. Casey and April take care of Raph and call the other Turtles for help. Together, they figure out the identities of Yaotl and his generals. After being revived, Raph suggests they pursue Yaotl, but Leonardo refuses to act until Splinter gives his permission. Raph decides to investigate alone.\n\nDonatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower, and Splinter tells Leonardo they need Raphael. Meanwhile, Yaotl reveals that he wishes to turn his generals back into humans and break the curse that keeps them alive. The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. As the Nightwatcher, Raph patrols the city. Leo, not recognizing his brother, pursues the Nightwatcher, believing him to be just a regular thug. In the ensuing fight, Leo discovers that the Nightwatcher's identity and Raph breaks his swords. After almost killing his brother, Raphael flees in a fit of guilt and shame. The generals seize a weakened Leo, intending to substitute him for the thirteenth beast, and Raph decides to make amends by rescuing Leo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through a Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower.\n\nRefusing to betray Yaotl, Karai and the Foot Clan work together with April and Casey, searching for the final monster, the Sea Monster, while the Turtles fight the generals. April, Casey, and Karai arrive at the tower with the Sea Monster, which crashes into the Generals, dragging them into the portal before it closes. Karai warns them to enjoy their victory while it lasts, cryptically saying they will soon contend with faces from their past before vanishing. A now-mortal Yaotl thanks the heroes for fulfilling his wish and dissipates into the afterlife. As they return to their roles as the shadowy guardians of New York City, Raph says that the Turtles will always be brothers.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Nolan North]] as [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], the hot-headed brother; who has been secretly operating as the vigilante Nightwatcher.\n* [[James Arnold Taylor]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], the [[leader]] of the group; who has been away training in Central America.\n* [[Mikey Kelley]] as [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], the light-hearted and carefree brother, who has been operating as a birthday entertainer, \"Cowabunga Carl\". \n* [[Mitchell Whitfield]] as [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], the genius brother; who has been operating as an IT tech support.\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], April's boyfriend and a friend of the turtles; who still engages in crime-fighting.\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[April O'Neil]]: a young, [[virtuous]] [[archaeologist]] and friend of the Turtles owning a [[shipping company]].\n* [[Mako (actor)|Mako Iwamatsu]] and [[Greg Baldwin]] as [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], a mutant rat; who is the turtles' father and [[sensei]].\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as Max Winters, a businessman; who is really the immortal [[warlord]] Yaotl; who desires to be mortal again and to do amends for his past errors.\n* [[Zhang Ziyi]] as [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]], the Shredder's former second-in-command and the new leader of the Foot Clan.\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as Colonel Santino, the leader of a group of South American bandits; who has been extorting protection money from the local villagers.\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as General Aguila, the leader of Yaotl's four generals; his name is Spanish for \"eagle\".\n* Paula Mattioli as General Serpiente, one of Yaotl's four generals; her name is Spanish for \"snake\".\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as General Gato, one of Yaotl's four generals; his name is Spanish for \"cat\".\n* [[Frank Welker]] as General Mono, one of Yaotl's generals (his name is Spanish for \"monkey\").\n* [[Kevin Smith]] as an unnamed cook at a diner where Nightwatcher fights the Jersey Devil.<ref>{{cite web |last=Topel |first=Fred |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1648092/smiths_15_seconds_of_quottmntquot_fame/ |title=Smith's 15 Seconds of \"TMNT\" Fame |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date=2007-01-14 |access-date=2013-08-05}}</ref>\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as the Narrator.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nA [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' movie was first announced in 2000, with [[John Woo]] supposedly at the helm.
