One brother, Primo, is a brilliant, perfectionist chef who chafes under their few customers' expectations of \"Americanized\" [[Italian food]]. Their uncle's offer for them to return to Rome to help with his restaurant is growing in appeal to Primo. The younger brother, Secondo, is the restaurant manager, a man enamoured of the possibilities presented by their new endeavor and life in America. Despite Secondo's efforts and Primo's magnificent food, their restaurant is failing to gain success and recognition.\n\nSecondo's struggles as a businessman render him unable to commit to his girlfriend Phyllis, and he has recently been sleeping with Gabriella, the wife of a competitor. Her husband's eponymous restaurant, \"Pascal's\", has succeeded despite (or perhaps due to) the mediocre, uninspired food served there. Desperate to keep Paradise afloat, Secondo asks Pascal for a loan. Pascal demurs, repeating a past offer for the brothers to work for him, which Secondo refuses: he and his brother want their own restaurant.  In a seemingly generous gesture, Pascal insists that he will persuade popular Italian-American singer [[Louis Prima]] to dine at Paradise when in town, assuming the celebrity jazz singer's patronage will revitalize the brothers' business. Primo and Secondo dive into the preparations for this \"big night\", spending their entire savings on  food, drinks and decoration, inviting numerous people (including a newspaper reporter and Primo's love interest) to join them for a magnificent feast showcasing a [[Timballo|timpano]] (a complex baked pasta dish). Primo pours his heart into every dish, lavishing care and great expertise on the cooking.\n\nAs they wait for Prima and his entourage to arrive, the dinner party indulges in the exquisite food and partake in a fabulous celebration. Hours go by, however, and it becomes apparent that the famous singer is not coming, although a reporter who came to cover the singer's appearance promises to ask his newspaper to send a food critic. Phyllis catches Secondo and Gabriella kissing and runs off to the beach. At Gabriella's insistence, Pascal admits that he never called Louis Prima, thus ending the party.\n\nSecondo follows Phyllis to the beach where they have a final quarrel.  Primo and Secondo have a fiery, heart-wrenching argument, chafing at their mutual differences. In the wee hours of the morning, Pascal admits to Secondo that he set the brothers up for failure; not as revenge for Secondo's affair with Gabriella but because the brothers would have no choice but to return to Italy or work for Pascal.  Secondo refuses him, saying they will never work for him.\n\nAs dawn breaks, Secondo silently cooks an [[omelette]]. When done, he divides it among three plates, giving one to Cristiano, their waiter, and eating one himself. Primo hesitantly enters, and Secondo hands him the last plate. They eat without speaking, and lay their arms across one another's shoulders.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Stanley Tucci]] as Secondo\n*[[Tony Shalhoub]] as Primo\n*[[Minnie Driver]] as Phyllis\n*[[Ian Holm]] as Pascal\n*[[Isabella Rossellini]] as Gabriella\n*[[Allison Janney]] as Ann Travis  \n*[[Marc Anthony]] as Cristiano\n*[[Caroline Aaron]] as Woman in restaurant \n*[[Campbell Scott]] as Bob\n*[[Susan Floyd]] as Joan\n*[[Pasquale Cajano]] as Alberto N.
