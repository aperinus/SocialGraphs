Looking into each other's eyes, Juli knows it\u2019s love, but Bryce is put off and avoids her.\n\nFour years later, Juli is still completely enamored, rarely leaving Bryce alone. He tries everything to get rid of her, including dating Sherry Stalls, one of the most popular girls in school, whom he knows she dislikes. This does not deter her. Bryce's best friend Garrett, who has a crush on Sherry, tells her why Bryce is dating her, so she dumps him. Embarrassed, Bryce looks forward to seventh grade as he hopes with more students Juli will finally meet someone else.\n\nThe following year, Chet Duncan, Bryce's grandfather, moves in with the family. Juli adores an old [[Platanus occidentalis|sycamore tree]] in their neighborhood, but one day discovers the tree is going to be cut down. Juli tries to prevent its removal by climbing it and refusing to come down. After much attention from the town, her father Richard convinces her to come out of the tree and it is cut down. Juli is almost inconsolable until Richard gives her a painting of the tree, which helps her overcome her distress, and her exploits are written about in the local paper.\n\nJuli raises chickens in her backyard as part of a school project and soon finds them laying eggs, which she sells to their neighbors but gives to Bryce as a gesture. She is hurt when she finds out Bryce has been throwing away the eggs she offered, out of his father's fear of [[salmonella]] due to the state of their yard. Embarrassed, Juli decides to fix it up.\n\nAfter reading about Juli in the paper, Chet helps her with her yard work and develops real affection for her, as she reminds him of his late wife. When traditional and house proud Steven, Bryce's father, criticizes the Bakers' apparent lack of care for their property, Chet confides that it's rented, as they devote most of their finances to caring for Juli's mentally-disabled uncle Daniel. The property is supposed to be cared for by their landlord. As Chet spends more time with Juli and encourages Bryce to be more open-minded, Bryce realizes he has feelings for her.\n\nMeanwhile, as Juli is encouraged to broaden her mind by Chet, she starts to question if she actually likes Bryce. Going with her father to visit Daniel on his birthday, they have a difficult but ultimately positive interaction. Afterward, Juli is told by a classmate that Bryce has been admiring her, but she overhears Bryce agreeing with Garrett as he makes fun of her and Daniel, causing Juli to completely lose interest in him. Unbeknownst to her, Bryce is disgusted with Garrett's attitude and stops spending time with him, but they remain friendly.\n\nFeeling badly about their indifference towards the Bakers, Bryce's mother Patsy invites them over for a family dinner. Bryce is excited, but Juli tells him privately that she overheard Bryce making fun of her and her uncle, calling him a coward for not defending her. The dinner gets off to an awkward start, but is a success. After dinner, Juli apologizes to Bryce for her behavior, and he realizes she feels complete indifference to him, leaving him feeling confused and hurt.\n\nAs the basket boy [[auction]], an annual school charity event, approaches, Bryce finds out he has been selected as a basket boy and will be auctioned off to the other students along with a homemade lunch. Juli finds out Sherry is planning to bid on Bryce, but acts uninterested. Bryce hears a rumor that Sherry and another girl are going to bid for him and Juli is seen having a lot of cash with her, but out of sympathy she bids on a rejected boy named Eddie Trulock instead. Sherry bids on Bryce and wins.\n\nDuring the basket boy lunch, Bryce is completely uninterested in Sherry's conversation, and instead watches Juli eat with Eddie Trulock. Overwhelmed with jealousy, Bryce gets up and tries to kiss Juli in front of all their classmates, but she rejects him and runs off in humiliation. Bryce runs after her, and Garrett confronts him for abandoning the prettiest girl in school. When he makes fun of Juli, Bryce ends their friendship for good. He tries to talk to Juli and explain, but Juli won't see or speak to him.\n\nTwo days later, with Richard's permission, Bryce plants a sapling sycamore tree in Juli's front yard to show her how he truly feels. When she sees this, she goes out to help him and realizes that after all these years, they have never really talked. As they plant the tree, their hands touch, they look into each other\u2019s eyes and share a knowing smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Madeline Carroll]] as Julianna \"Juli\" Baker\n**[[Morgan Lily]] as young Juli\n*[[Callan McAuliffe]] as Bryce Loski\n**Ryan Ketzner as young Bryce\n*[[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Patsy Loski\n*[[Anthony Edwards (actor)|Anthony Edwards]] as Steven Loski\n*[[John Mahoney]] as Chet Duncan.
