The film stars the voices of [[Louis C.K.]], [[Eric Stonestreet]], [[Kevin Hart]], [[Steve Coogan]], [[Ellie Kemper]], [[Bobby Moynihan]], [[Lake Bell]], [[Dana Carvey]], [[Hannibal Buress]], [[Jenny Slate]], and [[Albert Brooks]].\n\n''The Secret Life of Pets'' premiered at the [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] on June 16, 2016, and was released in theaters in the United States on July 8, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed $875 million worldwide, making it the [[2016 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2016]] as well as the year's most profitable release.\n\nA sequel, ''[[The Secret Life of Pets 2]]'', was released on June 7, 2019, with [[Patton Oswalt]] taking over the role of Max from Louis C.K.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Don't add anything here; it's already long enough. The FILMPLOT guideline recommends 700 words at most. -->\nA [[Jack Russell Terrier]] named Max lives with his owner Katie in a [[New York City|New York]] apartment. While she works, he socializes with other pets in the building: [[tabby cat]] Chloe, [[pug]] Mel, [[dachshund]] Buddy, and [[budgerigar]] Sweet Pea. One day, Katie adopts the [[mongrel]] Duke, making Max envious. Enraged by Max's attitude, Duke tries to abandon Max in an alley, but they are both attacked by cats led by [[Sphynx cat]] Ozone who removes their collars and leaves them to be caught by [[Animal control service|Animal Control]]. Duke fears that he will be killed if he goes back to the pound. When Gidget, a white [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]] who is in love with Max, discovers that he is missing, she decides to find him.\n\nMax and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball, the leader of \"the Flushed Pets,\" a gang of drain-dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners mistreated and rejected them. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans by saying they killed their owners, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty through a viper [[snakebite|bite]], Snowball learns that Max and Duke are domesticated. Realizing they had blown their cover, Max and Duke escape the drains and board a ferry to [[Brooklyn]], inadvertently killing the viper in the process. Snowball vows revenge and leads the Flushed Pets after them.\n\nMeanwhile, Gidget recruits a [[red-tailed hawk]] named Tiberius to find Max, but he mistakenly locates Ozone, whom Gidget coerces into telling what he knows about the dogs. They then enlist Mel, Buddy, Chloe, [[guinea pig]] Norman and Sweet Pea. On the way, they meet Pops, an old [[Basset Hound]] who helps Gidget and the pets find Max. Gidget and her team later encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of Gidget's team flees.\n\nIn the meantime, Duke tells Max about his previous owner Fred, who adopted him as a puppy and loved spending time with him. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was caught by Animal Control, but Fred never came to claim him. They visit Fred's house nearby, confident Fred will still love him and take him back, but they learn from the resident cat Reginald that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who have just returned to the house and called Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes long enough for Max to escape and ends up being captured instead.\n\nWhile trying to rescue Duke, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball realizes that he and Max must work together to rescue them. They drive a [[Transit bus|city bus]] into the Animal Control van on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], stopping traffic. The Flushed Pets encircle Max intending to harm him, unaware of Max's new partnership with Snowball, but they are saved by Gidget and her team. The van plummets into the [[East River]] as Max tries to free Duke, Snowball decides to jump into the river to give them the keys to Duke's cage and escape the van.\n\nThe entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven [[taxicab|taxi]]. Snowball and the Flushed Pets form a new plan to annihilate all humans, but a little girl named Molly arrives and adopts Snowball, and the remaining Flushed Pets head back to the drain. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become re-domesticated. The other pets return to their homes and embrace their owners, and Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!-- Please see the Talk page before changing breed designations!
