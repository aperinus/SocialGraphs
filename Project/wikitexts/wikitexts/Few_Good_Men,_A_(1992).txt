It was written by Sorkin, directed by [[Rob Reiner]], and produced by Reiner, [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] and [[Andrew Scheinman]]. It stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Tom Cruise]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Kevin Pollak]], [[J. T. Walsh]], [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], and [[Kiefer Sutherland]]. The plot follows the [[court-martial]] of two [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] charged with the murder of a fellow Marine and the tribulations of their lawyers as they prepare a case.\n\nProduced by [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], the film was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 11, 1992, and premiered on December 9, 1992, at [[Westwood, Los Angeles]]. It received acclaim for its screenwriting, direction, themes, and acting, particularly that of Cruise, Nicholson, and Moore. It grossed more than $243&nbsp;million on a budget of $40&nbsp;million, and was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The 65th Academy Awards |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/search/results |publisher=oscars.org |access-date=1 January 2021 |archive-date=November 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116163847/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/search/results |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==<!-- Too long! Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! -->\nAt the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in Cuba, Private William Santiago is a weak [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], has poor relations with other Marines, and has broken the [[chain of command]] to ask to be transferred away. [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Matthew Markinson advocates for Santiago to be transferred, but Base Commander [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Nathan Jessup orders Santiago's platoon commander, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick, to \"train\" Santiago. Santiago dies shortly afterward. Marines [[Lance Corporal]] Harold Dawson and [[Private First Class]] Louden Downey are accused of his murder and face a [[Courts-martial of the United States|court-martial]].\n\nWhile Santiago was ostensibly killed in retaliation for naming Dawson in a fenceline shooting{{what|reason=Is this a US colloquialism?|date=November 2022}} into Cuba, [[United States Navy]] [[United States Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps|JAG Corps]] investigator and lawyer [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Joanne Galloway suspects Dawson and Downey carried out a \"code red\" order: a violent [[extrajudicial punishment]]. Galloway wants to defend them, but the case is given to Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, a callow lawyer with a penchant for [[plea bargain]]s. Galloway is bothered by Kaffee's blas\u00e9 approach, and Kaffee resents Galloway's interference.\n\nKaffee and Galloway question Jessup and others at Guantanamo Bay. Jessup claims Santiago was to be transferred the next day. When Kaffee negotiates a plea bargain with the prosecutor, [[United States Marine Corps Judge Advocate Division|US Marine JAG Corps]] Captain Jack Ross, Dawson and Downey refuse, insisting that Kendrick gave them the \"code red\" order and that they never intended to kill Santiago. Dawson believes that it is dishonorable to pursue a plea bargain rather than defend their actions at trial. Kaffee intends to get removed as counsel as he thinks the trial is pointless. At the arraignment, Kaffee unexpectedly enters a plea of not guilty for the defendants. He tells Galloway that he was chosen to handle the case because he was expected to accept a plea, and the matter would then be kept quiet.\n\nMarkinson meets Kaffee in secret and says that Jessup never ordered a transfer for Santiago. The defense establishes that Dawson had been denied promotion for smuggling food to a Marine who had been sentenced to be deprived of food. Dawson is portrayed in a good light and the defense, through Downey, proves that \"code reds\" had been ordered before. But under cross-examination, Downey says that he was not present when Dawson received the supposed \"code red\" order. Markinson, ashamed that he failed to protect a Marine under his command, commits suicide before he can testify.\n\nWithout Markinson's testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost. He returns home in a drunken stupor, lamenting that he fought the case instead of taking a deal. Galloway encourages Kaffee to call Jessup as a witness, despite the risk of being court-martialed for challenging a high-ranking officer.\n\nAt the [[Washington Navy Yard]] court, Jessup spars under Kaffee's questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee points out a contradiction in his testimony: Jessup said that his Marines never disobey orders and that Santiago was to be transferred for his own safety. Kaffee asks why Santiago was in danger if Jessup had ordered his men to leave him alone. Disgusted by Kaffee's attitude, Jessup extols the military's importance, and his own, to national security. Finally, he bellows with contempt that he ordered the \"code red.\" Jessup tries to leave the courtroom but is arrested.\n\nDawson and Downey are cleared of the murder and conspiracy charges, but found guilty of \"[[conduct unbecoming]]\" and will be [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]]. Downey does not understand what they did wrong; Dawson says that they failed to defend those too weak to fight for themselves, such as Santiago. Kaffee tells Dawson that he does not need to wear a patch on his arm to have honor. Dawson acknowledges Kaffee as an officer, and renders a salute. Kaffee and Ross exchange kudos before Ross departs to arrest Kendrick.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)]] Daniel Kaffee, [[United States Navy|USN]], [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy|JAG Corps]]\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Nathan R.
