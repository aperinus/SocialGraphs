However, the Empress has been in an affair with the first son, Crown Prince Wan ([[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]]), who was born of the Emperor's previous wife. At the same time, Crown Prince Wan has been in an affair with Jiang Chan ([[Li Man]]), daughter of the Imperial Doctor, and is keen on rejecting the throne so that he may run away with her.\n\nPrince Jai notices the declining health of his mother, and is confused by her sudden interest in [[chrysanthemum]]s, the golden flowers. The Empress explains that the tea she drinks has been poisoned for some time by the Emperor, but that she is planning a rebellion to overthrow him. Prince Jai agrees to be the leader of the rebellion. The Empress hires a mysterious woman to discover the type of poison which she is suffering from, but the woman is captured by Crown Prince Wan and taken to the Emperor. As it happens, the woman is Jiang Shi (Chen Jin), the Imperial Doctor's wife, whom the Emperor imprisoned a while ago and who was believed dead, but somehow escaped. The Emperor decides to pardon her and to promote the Imperial Doctor to governor of [[Suzhou]]. When Crown Prince Wan meets with Jiang Chan to say goodbye, she informs him that the Empress has woven 10,000 scarves with golden flower sigils. Crown Prince Wan confronts the Empress, and when she admits to planning a rebellion, he is anguished, and tries to kill himself, but survives.\n\nOn the way to Suzhou, the Imperial Doctor's household is betrayed and attacked by the Emperor's assassins, resulting in his death. Jiang Shi and Jiang Chan run back to Nanjing and confront the Emperor, who refuses to answer, whereupon the Empress explains to Jiang Chan that Jiang Shi was the Emperor's first wife and Crown Prince Wan's mother, meaning that Jiang Chan and Crown Prince Wan are half-brother and sister. Jiang Chan is horrified by this news and runs from the palace. Jiang Shi chases after her, whereupon both are murdered by more assassins. At this point, the third son, Prince Yu, suddenly murders Crown Prince Wan and reveals he has been aware of the corruption of both the Emperor and the Empress. Summoning a group of his own soldiers, Prince Yu demands the Emperor [[abdication|abdicate]] and offer him the throne. However, more of the Emperor's assassins descend from the ceiling and easily defeat Prince Yu's soldiers. The Emperor proceeds to whip Prince Yu to death using his belt.\n\nMeanwhile, the outer square of the palace is assaulted by 10,000 soldiers wearing gold flower sigils, with Prince Jai in the lead. They overpower the assassins and proceed to the inner square of the palace, trampling upon the bed of golden flowers arranged for the ceremony. However, thousands of soldiers, the reserve army of the Emperor, appear and slaughter the golden soldiers; only Prince Jai survives, and he is taken captive. Behind him, the courtyard is cleaned with mechanical efficiency by a legion of servants, with bodies being removed, floors being scrubbed and laid with carpets, and pots of yellow flowers being replaced, making it seem as if the entire rebellion never even happened. At midnight, the Double Ninth Festival begins as scheduled. At the table, the Emperor expresses disappointment with Prince Jai, saying that he was already planning to give him the throne. Prince Jai says that he did not rebel to obtain the throne, but for his mother's sake. The Emperor responds by offering to pardon Prince Jai if he cooperates in the Empress's poisoning. Prince Jai refuses and kills himself, and as he does so, his blood spills into another cup of poisoned tea that has been brought to the Empress, turning the tea red.  Horrified, the Empress slaps the tea away, and the liquid is shown to corrode the table's wood, along with the golden flower image engraved into the wood.\n\n==Cast==\n===Imperial family===\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as Emperor Ping (\u5927\u738b ''D\u00e0w\u00e1ng'' \"King\")\n* [[Gong Li]] as Empress Phoenix (\u738b\u540e ''W\u00e1ngh\u00f2u'' \"Queen\")\n* [[Jay Chou]] as Prince Jai (Prince Yuanjie (\u738b\u5b50\u5143\u6770 ''W\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Yu\u00e1nji\u00e9'')), the middle son of Emperor Ping\n* [[Qin Junjie]] as Prince Yu (Prince Yuancheng (\u738b\u5b50\u5143\u6210 ''W\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Yu\u00e1nch\u00e9ng'')), the youngest son of Emperor Ping\n* [[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]] as Crown Prince Wan (Crown Prince Yuanxiang (\u592a\u5b50\u5143\u7965 ''T\u00e0iz\u01d0 Yu\u00e1nxi\u00e1ng'')), the eldest son of Emperor Ping\n\n===Physician Jiang's family===\n* [[Ni Dahong]] as Imperial Physician Jiang (\u848b\u592a\u533b ''Ji\u01ceng-t\u00e0iy\u012b''), later Governor of Xuju and Commander of Chariots\n* [[Chen Jin (actress)|Chen Jin]] as physician's wife (Mrs. Jiang (\u848b\u6c0f ''Ji\u01ceng-sh\u00ec''))\n* [[Li Man]] as Jiang Chan (\u8523\u5b0b ''Ji\u01ceng Ch\u00e1n'', physician's daughter)\n\n==Title==\nThe Chinese title of the movie is taken from the last line of a poem written by the rebel leader [[Huang Chao]] who was also the [[Chinese emperor|Emperor]] of self-proclaimed Qi Dynasty that was at war with the [[Tang Dynasty]]. [[Huang Chao]] had composed the poem \"On the Chrysanthemum, after failing the Imperial Examination\" ([[s:zh:\u4e0d\u7b2c\u5f8c\u8ce6\u83ca|\u4e0d\u7b2c\u5f8c\u8ce6\u83ca/\u4e0d\u7b2c\u540e\u8d4b\u83ca]]) or simply \"Chrysanthemum\": \n{{cquote|When autumn comes on [[Double Ninth Festival]], / my flower [the chrysanthemum] will bloom and all others perish. / When the sky-reaching fragrance [of the chrysanthemum] permeates [[Chang'an]], / '''the whole city will be clothed in golden armour'''.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200311/16/eng20031116_128344.shtml \"Chrysanthemum - flower of honour\"].

The plot could also be possibly based on [[Hamlet]] according to James Berardinelli.<ref>Berardinelli, James.

Accessed 11 August 2009.</ref>\n\nThe two protagonists are known in the Chinese version as \"King\" and \"Queen\", which in the English version has been upgraded to the more stereotypically Chinese \"Emperor\" and \"Empress\". The distinction is not trivial, as the lower title \"king\" only lays claim to a defined region whereas the supreme \"emperor\" claims overlordship over the entire (Chinese-speaking) world. The choice of title therefore implies that despite the splendour of its court the polity depicted in the film does not actually rule all of China.\n\nThe English language version states that this movie is set in the \"Tang dynasty\" in the year 928. The Chinese version doesn't specify a time period. The film's published screenplay indicates it is set during [[Later Shu]] of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928214826/http://www.storyparty.com/Story_Detail.aspx?ID=81297 The novel ''Curse of the Golden Flower'']</ref> Neither the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) nor Later Shu (934\u2013965) existed in the year 928, although another state named Tang \u2014 known as [[Later Tang]] in history \u2014 did, as well as other Chinese states [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]], [[Chu (Ten Kingdoms)|Chu]], [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]], [[Southern Han]], [[Jingnan]] and [[Wuyue]], in addition to the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-ruled [[Liao dynasty]] (known as just Khitan in 928). However, Later Tang rulers were known as \"[[Emperor of China|Emperor]]\" (\u7687\u5e1d) and never \"King\" (\u5927\u738b), and of all the states mentioned above, only Chu, Wuyue, Min and Jingnan rulers could be called \"King\" by their subjects in 928.\n\n[[Suzhou]] is evidently under the jurisdiction of the state featured in the film, as the King is able to appoint Dr. Jiang its governor. This narrows the number of candidates to the states with territory in the [[Yangzi River Delta]].\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe US release garnered a generally positive reception. {{Anchor|Box office}}\nIt has grossed over $78 million worldwide.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=curseofthegoldenflower.htm Boxoffice Mojo]</ref> It was also the third highest grossing non-English language film in 2006 after ''[[Apocalypto]]'' and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2006&p=.htm 2006 Worldwide Grosses]</ref>\n\nRichard Corliss of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'' praised the film's lurid operatic aspect: \"this is high, and high-wire, melodrama...where matters of love and death are played at a perfect fever pitch.
