Mavis and Johnny have a young son named Dennis, whose lack of any vampire abilities worries both Mavis and his maternal grandfather Dracula for differing reasons. When Mavis and Johnny travel to Johnny's hometown in California, Drac calls his friends to help him make Dennis a vampire, much to Mavis's dismay.\n\nOriginal voices from the first film \u2014 Sandler, [[Andy Samberg]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Kevin James]], [[David Spade]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Molly Shannon]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Rob Riggle]], Sadie Sandler, Jonny Solomon, [[Luenell]], [[Chris Parnell]] and [[Jon Lovitz]] \u2014 returned for the sequel, with [[Keegan-Michael Key]] replacing [[CeeLo Green]] as Murray. New additions to the cast include [[Asher Blinkoff]], [[Nick Offerman]], [[Megan Mullally]], [[Dana Carvey]], and [[Mel Brooks]]. The film was released on September 25, 2015, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] under the [[Columbia Pictures]] label. Hotel Transylvania 2 received mixed reviews from critics but it had grossed over $474 million worldwide on an $80 million budget. A sequel, ''[[Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation]]'', was released in July 2018.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2021}}\nSome time after the events of [[Hotel Transylvania (film)|the first film]], [[Hotel Transylvania characters#Mavis|Mavis]] and [[Hotel Transylvania characters#Jonathan (Johnny)|Johnny]] are finally married, with the approval of her father [[Count Dracula]]. A year after the wedding, Mavis reveals to Drac that she is pregnant and later gives birth to a baby boy whom the couple name [[List of Hotel Transylvania characters#Dennisovitch|Dennis]], nicknamed \u201cDenisovich\u201d by Dracula.\n\nAs Dennis's fifth birthday nears, he has yet to grow his fangs and Drac worries that his grandson might not gain vampire powers. Noticing the potential dangers her son might face living in Transylvania, Mavis starts to consider moving to Johnny's hometown in [[California]] in order to give Dennis a more \u201cnormal\u201d childhood, much to Drac's disapproval. Drac tells Johnny (who does not want to leave the hotel either) to bring Mavis to California to visit his parents, Mike and Linda, but to make sure to keep her distracted so that she will not move, leaving Dracula to \"babysit\" Dennis.\n\nConvinced that Dennis is a \"late fanger\", Drac enlists his friends [[Frankenstein's monster|Frank]], Wayne, [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Griffin]], Murray, and [[The Blob|Blobby]] to help train Dennis to become a monster, but every attempt that they try fails. Drac and the gang then go to Camp Winnepacaca, Drac's childhood summer camp, only to sneak away after Drac finds out that the camp has become much safer and child-friendly. Drac attempts to hurl Dennis from a tall, unstable tower to pressure the boy's transformation into a bat, but he fails to transform and Drac flies down and rescues him at the last second.\n\nMeanwhile, in California, Mavis enjoys exploring the more human world. When the couple arrive at Mike and Linda's house, Linda unsuccessfully attempts to make Mavis feel more comfortable by covering her room with spooky, [[Halloween]] decorations and inviting other monster/human couples over. Feeling like a stranger, Mavis retreats up to the roof, and Johnny tells her that if they stay together, Dennis will live normally, persuading her to stay at the hotel. However, Johnny then discovers a video of Dennis falling that was filmed by the campers, and he and a furious Mavis go back to Transylvania, with Drac and his friends reaching the hotel at the same time. Mavis confronts her father for putting Dennis in grave danger and failing to accept him as a human, and shows him a pop music remix parody of Dennis in danger and Drac arguing with the staff. Mavis says that they will move out of the hotel after Dennis's birthday party.\n\nThe night before the party, Drac hosts Johnny's family, and finds out that Mavis invited his father Vlad. As Vlad is more hateful of humans than he was, Drac tells Johnny to have his family disguise themselves as monsters. The next day, Vlad arrives with his monstrous bat-like servant Bela, and meets Dennis for the first time. Believing that fear will cause Dennis' fangs to sprout, Vlad possesses a stage performer, named Brandon, dressed as Dennis' favorite TV monster Kakie to scare him, but Drac shields his frightened grandson at the last moment, breaking Vlad's hold over the performer. Mavis mistakenly believes that Drac was responsible for the ruse, and while the family argues about whether or not Dennis can be happy in California, a guilt-ridden Dennis flees the hotel and enters the forest with Wayne and Wanda's daughter [[Hotel Transylvania characters#Winnie|Winnie]], who has a crush on him, in tow.\n\nIrritated with Vlad, Johnny and his family expose themselves, and an irate Vlad reprimands Drac for accepting humans. Upon hearing that Dennis is a human, Bela attacks him and Winnie in their treehouse and abducts them. When Bela injures Winnie and threatens to destroy the hotel, Dennis's anger causes him to instantly grow his fangs and develop his vampire abilities, and he bashes up Bela. A furious but defeated Bela calls his giant-bat minions, but Drac, Johnny, Mavis, Dennis, and the rest of the monsters team up to defeat Bela's minions and drive them away, while Bela is shrunk by Vlad, who has been won over by Drac's claim that humans now coexist peacefully. With Dennis finally embracing his vampire abilities, Johnny and Mavis decide to continue raising him in Transylvania, and they resume the party with his friends and family.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Hotel Transylvania characters}}\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as [[Count Dracula|Count \"Drac\" Dracula]]: Mavis' father, Jonathan's father-in-law, and Dennis' maternal grandfather.\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Jonathan \"Johnny\" Loughran: Mavis' husband, Dennis' father, and son-in-law of Dracula.\n* [[Selena Gomez]] as Mavis Dracula: Johnny's vampire wife, Dennis' overprotective mother, and daughter of Count Dracula and his late wife Martha.\n* [[Kevin James]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]:<ref name=\"USA Today\" /> Drac's friend who hangs with Murray.\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Wayne: a [[werewolf]].<ref name=\"USA Today\" />\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Murray: a [[Mummy (undead)|mummy]] who hangs with Frank.<ref name=\"USA Today\" /> He was previously voiced by [[CeeLo Green]] in [[Hotel Transylvania (film)|the first film]].\n* [[David Spade]] as [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Griffin the Invisible Man]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24dffi/david_spade_talks_about_his_fake_problems_ama |title=David Spade talks about his fake problems.
