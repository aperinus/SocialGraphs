The film was written and directed by [[C. Jay Cox]] and stars [[Steve Sandvoss]] as the missionary, Aaron, and [[Wes Ramsey]] as the neighbor, Christian. [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] appears as Elder Ryder, and [[Rebekah Johnson]] as Julie Taylor. [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Khary Payton]], [[Erik Palladino]], [[Amber Benson]], and [[Jacqueline Bisset]] have supporting roles.\n\n''Latter Days'' premiered at the [[Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival]] on July 10, 2003 and was released in various states of USA over the next 12 months. Later the film was released in a few other countries and shown at several gay film festivals. It was the first film to portray openly the [[Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|clash]] between the principles of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and [[homosexuality]], and its exhibition in some [[U.S. state]]s was controversial. Various religious groups demanded that the film be withdrawn from theaters and video stores under [[boycott]] threats.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reactions from film critics, but was popular with most film festival attendees. At the North American box office however, ''Latter Days'' only made $834,685, barely covering the production's costs with an estimated budget of $850,000. In 2004, freelance writer T. Fabris made ''Latter Days'' into a novel, which was published by [[Alyson Publications]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]] Aaron Davis, a young [[Mormon]] from [[Pocatello, Idaho]], is sent to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] with three other missionaries to spread the Mormon faith. They move into an apartment next to openly gay party boy Christian Markelli and his roommate Julie, an aspiring singer. Christian and Julie work as waiters at Lila's, a trendy restaurant owned by retired actress Lila Montagne.\n\nChristian makes a bet with his co-workers that he can seduce one of the Mormons, and  soon realizes that Aaron, the least experienced missionary, is a [[Coming out#Closeted|closeted]] homosexual. Aaron and Christian become acquainted through several encounters in the apartment complex. When Christian accidentally injures himself, Aaron helps him indoors and cleans his wound. Christian attempts to seduce Aaron, but the hesitant Mormon becomes upset by Christian's remark that sex \"doesn't have to mean anything.\" Aaron accuses him of being shallow and walks out. Worried that Aaron is correct, Christian joins a charity, delivering meals to people with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].  He gains new insights through a friendship with one of the beneficiaries, Keith.  Aaron meets and befriends Lila, whose life partner has died, unaware of her connection to Christian.\n\nAaron's fellow missionary, Paul Ryder, has a cycling accident. Returning to his apartment, a distraught Aaron encounters Christian, who tries to comfort him with a hug. Both men are overwhelmed by their feelings and end up kissing, failing to notice the return of Aaron's roommates. Aaron is sent home in disgrace, leading Christian to confront Ryder, who is angry that Christian corrupted Aaron for no reason. Christian admits that he initially just wanted to win a bet, but says \"it's not about that\" anymore. Recognizing Christian's distress, Ryder tells him that Aaron's flight has a five-hour [[layover]] in [[Salt Lake City]].\n\nChristian finds Aaron standing in the snow outside the airport terminal. Christian confesses his love, and despite his misgivings, Aaron admits his own feelings of love. With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron's pocket watch, a family heirloom, has been left behind. Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the church elders, led by his own father, Farron, who is the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)#Stake officers|stake president]]. Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother, who tells him that he needs to pray for forgiveness. When Aaron suggests that he might be gay, his mother slaps him. Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be [[Ex-gay movement|cured of his homosexuality]].\n\nChristian is desperate to find Aaron and locates his home address and phone number. Aaron's mother informs him that \"Thanks to you, my son took a razor to his wrists; thanks to you I have lost my son.\" Believing that Aaron is dead, Christian spends the next few days thinking continually about Aaron. Christian travels to the Davis home in Idaho, where he tearfully returns Aaron's watch to his mother.\n\nJulie writes a song based on Christian's journal entry about the ordeal.  Julie hesitantly shows Christian her [[Music video|video]] for the song, and he is upset that Julie used his writings without his consent. Julie tells Christian that she hoped something good would come from it.  In the treatment facility, Aaron hears Julie's song when her video airs on television. The video prompts Aaron to return to Los Angeles in search of Christian. When a stranger answers the door to Christian's apartment, Aaron is heartbroken, thinking that Christian has returned to his party boy ways and moved on. Having nowhere else to go, Aaron makes his way to Lila's restaurant during Christian's shift. Christian is overjoyed to see Aaron alive. They reconcile and later celebrate [[Thanksgiving]] with Christian's co-workers. Lila tells everyone that, no matter what, they will always have \"a place at my table, and a place in my heart\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Steve Sandvoss November 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Steve Sandvoss]] (Elder Aaron Davis in the film)]]\n* [[Steve Sandvoss]] as Elder Aaron Davis, a young Latter-day Saint from  Pocatello, Idaho, who falls in love with Christian and must choose between his sexuality and his church. The producers auditioned a large number of people before casting Sandvoss, saying he \"blew us away.\"<ref name= \"DVD\"/>\n* [[Wes Ramsey]] as Christian William Markelli, an LA party boy aspiring to be an actor, Christian has his ideas of happiness and the meaning of life challenged when he falls for the simple but kind-hearted Aaron. Ramsey said on the DVD Special featurette, \"The character of Christian was on so many levels intriguing to me. I was just so excited and feel very blessed to have the opportunity to tell that story through his eyes.\"<ref name= \"DVD\"/>\n* [[Rebekah Johnson]] as Julie Taylor, Christian's roommate who tries to break out into the music world and on the way stop Christian from falling apart.\n[[File:JacquelineBissetSept08.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacqueline Bisset]] (Lila Montagne in the film)]]\n* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as Lila Montagne, the owner of Lila's, a restaurant where Christian, Traci, Julie, and Andrew work. Her lover is terminally ill in hospital, but she still finds time to support Christian and Aaron with her witty and sarcastic advice. Bisset herself said, \"I like humor, so I just, I really enjoyed doing all the cracks.\"<ref name= \"DVD\"/>\n* [[Amber Benson]] as Traci Levine; Traci has moved from New York to LA to become an actress and works at Lila's to support herself. Traci does not like living in LA, but later admits she did not like New York much either.\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, judgmental young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not enthusiastic about being in LA and even less so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but good sense of humor made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.<ref name= \"DVD\"/>\n[[File:Rob McElhenney by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rob McElhenney]] portrays Elder Harmon]]\n* [[Khary Payton]] as Andrew, an aspiring actor, but spends more time at Lila's gossiping and telling racy anecdotes.

Cox said that Palladino's performance was not how he originally envisioned it, but he could not now imagine a different person playing Keith.<ref name= \"DVD\"/>\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Sister Gladys Davis, Aaron's deeply religious mother, who, despite showing unconditional love and affection toward Aaron before he leaves for Los Angeles, cannot accept the fact that her son is gay.\n* Jim Ortlieb as Elder Farron Davis, Aaron's father, who serves as a Latter-day Saint [[Stake President]] in Pocatello, excommunicates Aaron from the church upon learning that he is gay. Farron is portrayed as a distant, evasive individual.\n* Linda Pine as Susan Davis, the only Davis who accepts her brother's homosexuality. In a deleted scene, she tells Aaron that his homosexuality has changed nothing between them. She also discovers Aaron's suicide attempt, and in a panic, is able to save him just in time.\n\n==Themes==\nCox has stated that the film is primarily about a love story between two characters.<ref name= \"Killer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.killermoviereviews.com/main.php?nextlink=display&dId=434&subLinks= |title=Cox, C.
