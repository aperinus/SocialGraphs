The film adapts the play's story and characters to a setting based on 1930s Britain, with Richard depicted as a [[fascist]] plotting to usurp the throne.\n\n[[Ian McKellen]] portrays the titular [[Richard III of England|Richard]], as well as co-writing the screenplay with Loncraine. The cast also includes [[Annette Bening]] as [[Elizabeth Woodville|Queen Elizabeth]], [[Jim Broadbent]] as the [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers|Rivers]], [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as [[Anne Neville]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as the [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]], [[Maggie Smith]] as the [[Cecily Neville, Duchess of York|Duchess of York]], [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]], [[Tim McInnerny]] as Sir [[William Catesby]], and [[Dominic West]] as the [[Henry VII of England|Earl of Richmond]] (the latter's first feature film role).\n\nThe film premiered in Brazil on 20 August 1995, and was released in the United States on 29 December 1995, and in the United Kingdom on 26 April of the following year. While [[Box-office bomb|unsuccessful at the box office]], it received critical acclaim,<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /> and won several accolades. At the [[50th British Academy Film Awards]], it won the awards for [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], with nominations for [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Best British Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]]. It also earned [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and McKellen was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a fictitious timeline of [[England]] in the late 1930s, a chaotic and bloody [[Wars of the Roses|civil war]] (which occurs 450 years later than the actual historical event) ends with [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] King [[Henry VI of England|Henry]] and his son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Prince Edward]] assassinated by [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Richard III of England|Richard Gloucester]] of the rival faction supported by the [[House of York]]. Richard's elder brother [[Edward IV of England|Edward York]] becomes King. Richard is determined to take the crown, and pits King Edward against his brother, [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Clarence]], who is imprisoned under a sentence of death. Richard deceives and marries Prince Edward's widow Lady [[Anne Neville]].\n\n[[Elizabeth Woodville|Queen Elizabeth]] intercedes on Clarence's behalf and persuades Edward to spare his life. Richard destroys the [[Royal prerogative of mercy|royal pardon]] and commissions [[James Tyrrell]] to execute Clarence, ostensibly in compliance with Clarence's death sentence. Richard informs Edward of Clarence's death at a meeting with Prime Minister [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|William Hastings]], and the King dies from a stroke. As Edward's sons are underage, Richard becomes Regent, taking the title of [[Lord Protector]] with the support of the ambitious and corrupt [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Henry Buckingham]].\n\nTo undermine his rivals for the throne, Richard has Rivers, the Queen's brother, assassinated and uses the sordid circumstances of his death to damage the Queen's reputation and cast doubt on her sons' legitimacy. Hastings' reluctance to support Richard's claim to the crown so enrages Richard that he manufactures false charges of treason against Hastings, who is sentenced to death by hanging. Having made an example of his only vocal opponent, Richard persuades the [[Lord Mayor of London]] and members of the [[House of Lords]] to acknowledge his claim to the throne and crown him King. Acting on the advice of [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Archbishop Thomas]] and [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], the Lancastrian heir, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Richmond]], flees to France.\n\nFollowing his coronation Richard, now King Richard III, seeks to make his throne secure. He employs Tyrrell to murder the princes after failing to convince Buckingham to do so. Aware that Richmond intends to marry [[Elizabeth of York|Elizabeth]], he instructs Sir William Catesby to spread rumours that Lady Anne is ill and likely to die, intending to marry Elizabeth himself. Lady Anne is found dead sometime later from an apparent drug overdose. Impatient for the promised reward for his loyalty, Buckingham demands the [[Earl of Hereford|Earldom of Hereford]]. Richard dismisses this in a high-handed manner, with the line \"I am not in the giving vein\". Buckingham, also disturbed by the murders of the princes and Hastings, flees to meet Richmond but is later captured and killed by Tyrrell under Richard's orders.\n\nRichmond gathers supporters, among them Archbishop Thomas and Richard's mother, the [[Cecily Neville, Duchess of York|Duchess of York]]. They are joined by [[Air marshal|Air Marshal]] Thomas Stanley. Richmond marries Elizabeth and unites both Houses and political factions against Richard. With the army's loyalty slipping and the legitimacy of his claims to the crown weakened, Richard prepares for the final battle against the Lancastrians, who plan an invasion and an advance on London. Richard's remaining loyal troops, assembling in a marshalling yard, are attacked from the air, revealing Stanley's defection to the Lancastrian cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/richard/screenplay/100.htm|title=Richard III|website=Screenplay by Ian McKellen and Richard Loncraine|publisher=mckellen.com|access-date=22 April 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe two armies meet soon after at a ruined [[Battersea Power Station]]. Richard and Richmond seek each other out but when his vehicle stalls Richard flees into the structure. Pursued by Richmond, Richard is forced to exit onto exposed metal beams high above the burning battlefield. Cornered by Richmond and refusing to surrender, Richard falls into the inferno with a maniacal grin, reflected by Richmond.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as Richard, [[Duke of Gloucester]], later [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]]\n* [[Annette Bening]] as [[Elizabeth Woodville|Queen Elizabeth]]\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as the [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers|Rivers]]\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Lady [[Anne Neville]]\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as the [[Cecily Neville, Duchess of York|Duchess of York]]\n* [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] as [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]]\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George, Duke of Clarence]]\n* [[Adrian Dunbar]] as Sir [[James Tyrrel]]\n* [[Edward Hardwicke]] as [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]]\n* [[Tim McInnerny]] as Sir [[William Catesby]]\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|Lord Hastings]]\n* [[Dominic West]] as [[Henry VII of England|Henry, Earl of Richmond]] (the future King Henry VII)\n* [[Tres Hanley]] as Lord Rivers' mistress\n* [[Roger Hammond (actor)|Roger Hammond]] as [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Archbishop Thomas]]\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as [[Robert Brackenbury]]\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as [[Richard Ratcliffe]]\n* Kate Steavenson-Payne as [[Elizabeth of York|Princess Elizabeth]]\n* [[Christopher Bowen]] as [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Lancaster, Prince of Wales]]\n* Matthew Groom as [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Prince Richard of York]]\n* [[Marco Williamson]] as [[Edward V of England|Edward of York, Prince of Wales]]\n* [[Edward Jewesbury]] as [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]]\n* [[Stacey Kent]] as Singer at the celebratory ball\n{{Div col end}}\n\n[[Michael Elphick]] has an uncredited cameo appearance as the second murderer of George the Duke of Clarence.\n\n==Concept==\nThe film's concept was based on a stage production [[Richard Eyre]] directed for the [[Royal National Theatre]], which also starred McKellen. The production was adapted for the screen by McKellen and directed by [[Richard Loncraine]].\n\nThe film is notable for its unconventional use of famous British landmarks, often using special effects to move them to new locations. The transformed landmarks include:\n* [[St Pancras railway station]], instead of the [[Palace of Westminster]], is [[Edward IV of England|King Edward]]'s seat of government.\n* [[Battersea Power Station]], relocated to the coast of [[Kent]] and portrayed as a heavily damaged military base.\n* [[Bankside Power Station]], rather than the actual Tower of London, depicted as the prison where [[George, Duke of Clarence|Clarence]] is imprisoned. At the time of filming, the station was partially derelict, before its current use as the [[Tate Modern]].\n* [[Brighton Pavilion]], King Edward's country retreat on a coastal clifftop.\n* [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] of the [[University of London]], Richard's seat of government, used for interior and exterior scenes.<ref name=\"gallery\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mckellen.com/galleries/60.htm |title=Richard III: Photographs |work=mckellen.com |year=2014 |access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref> The famous [[art deco]] facade and clock of [[Shell Mex House]] are also featured in exterior shots.\n\nThe visually rich production features various symbols, uniforms, weapons, and vehicles that draw openly from fascist aesthetics, similar to those of the [[Nazi Germany]] as depicted in [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] (especially ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'') and war films. Richard's appearance (in terms of haircut and moustache) is modelled on that of [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]], though the remainder of Richard's appearance includes the other deformities specified within Shakespeare's stage directions of a hunchback and withered arm - for the film in addition, a blinded left eye, the same side as the withered arm.\n\nAt the same time, obvious care is put into diluting and mixing the totalitarian references with recognizable British and American uniforms, props, and visual motifs. The resulting military uniforms, for instance, range from completely standard 1930s British Army and Air Force uniforms for good characters to heavily [[Blackshirts|squadristi]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-inspired insignia on British uniforms for Richard's entourage, with SS collar tabs replacing the gorget patches and a white boar replacing the royal crown on Richard's uniform.\n\nFor road transport, great care was taken to ensure that all cars in filming were of pre-war vintage.\n\nFor air transport, pre-war types were used again to ensure authenticity. As Lord Rivers arrives, he does so in a [[Pan-Am]] [[DC-3]] airliner. As the Duchess of York ([[Maggie Smith]]) departs for France, she does so in a De Havilland [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide|Dragon Rapide]] biplane airliner. For the climactic final battle, the restored [[Bristol Blenheim]] is used to represent Lord Stanley's air-attack, which is also period-correct for [[RAF]] deployment immediately before and during the start of the [[Second World War]], for the period at which the film ends.\n\nAnother example of this balanced approach to production design is the choice of tanks for battle scenes between Richmond's and Richard's armies: both use [[Soviet]] tanks ([[T-55]]s and [[T-34]]s respectively), mixed with [[Sd.Kfz. 251|German]], [[M3 Half-track|American]], and British [[World War II]]-era vehicles. To convey the out-of-place nature of the common-born Queen Elizabeth, she is reconfigured as an American socialite similar to [[Wallis Simpson]], and members of the court treat her and her brother with marked disapproval.\n\nOne of the play's most famous lines\u2014\"A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!\"\u2014is re-contextualized by the 20th-century setting; during the climactic battle, Richard's jeep becomes stuck in a pile of debris, and his lament is a plea for a mode of transport with legs rather than wheels.\n\nThe film enlarges the role of the [[Duchess of York]] considerably by combining her character with that of Queen Margaret, as compared with [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[Richard III (1955 film)|1955 film version]] of the play, in which the Duchess hardly appeared at all and Queen Margaret was completely eliminated. The roles of Rivers, Grey, Vaughan, and Dorset are combined into Rivers. The death scenes are shown rather than implied as in the play, and changed to suit the time (Hastings is hanged rather than beheaded) and historical accuracy (Clarence dies by having his throat cut in a bathtub, rather than being drowned in a wine barrel). Rivers\u2014who usually dies offstage (or, in the case of Olivier's film, offscreen)\u2014is impaled by a sharp spike spurting up from the bottom of his mattress while he lies in bed during sex with a woman in a hotel room. Each character's pre-death monologue is also removed, except those of Clarence and Buckingham.\n\nMcKellen wrote, \"When you put this amazing old story in a believable modern setting, it will hopefully raise the hair on the back of your neck, and you won't be able to dismiss it as 'just a movie' or, indeed, as 'just old-fashioned [[Shakespeare]]'.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Keith |last=Stern |url=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/richard/notes.htm |title=Richard III: Notes |work=Mckellen.com |year=1995 |access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* [[68th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]<ref name=\"Oscars1996\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1996 |title=The 68th Academy Awards (1996) Nominees and Winners |access-date=5 August 2011 |work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n** [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] \u2013 [[Tony Burrough]] (nominated)\n** [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] \u2013 [[Shuna Harwood]] (nominated)\n* [[50th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Film Awards]]\n** [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Best British Film]] (nominated)\n** [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor]] \u2013 [[Ian McKellen]] (nominated)\n** [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] \u2013 Ian McKellen and [[Richard Loncraine]] (nominated)\n** [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] \u2013 Shuna Harwood (won)\n** [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] \u2013 Tony Burrough (won)\n* [[46th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]\n** [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] \u2013 Richard Loncraine (won)<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1996/03_preistr_ger_1996/03_Preistraeger_1996.html |title=Berlinale: 1996 Prize Winners |access-date=1 January 2012 |work=berlinale.de |archive-date=30 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830090700/https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1996/03_preistr_ger_1996/03_Preistraeger_1996.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n** [[Golden Bear]] (nominated)\n* [[53rd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]]\n** [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] \u2013 Ian McKellen (nominated)\n\n== Reception ==\n''Richard III'' received universal acclaim from critics.
