The film stars the voices of [[Gabriel Damon]], [[Candace Hutson]], [[Judith Barsi]] (posthumously) and [[Will Ryan]] with narration provided by [[Pat Hingle]]. It is the first film in [[The Land Before Time|''The Land Before Time'' franchise]].\n\nProduced by [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Sullivan Bluth Studios]], it features [[dinosaur]]s living in the prehistoric times. The plot concerns a young ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' named Littlefoot, who is orphaned<ref name=\"Lenburg2009\">{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |edition=Third|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6599-8}}</ref> when his mother is killed by a vicious carnivore (''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''). Littlefoot flees [[famine]] and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area spared from devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions: Cera a ''[[Triceratops]]'', Ducky a ''[[Saurolophus]]'',<!-- There has been a dispute over Ducky and her family's species. Please do not change \"Saurolophus\" to \"Parasaurolophus\" and state that Ducky is a Parasaurolophus.--> Petrie a ''[[Pteranodon]]'', and Spike a ''[[Stegosaurus]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uphe.com/movies/the-land-before-time |title=The Land Before Time |date=March 8, 2015 |publisher=Universal Pictures Entertainment |access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref> The film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot's mother and forced to deal with a \"sharptooth\" (''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''). \n\n''The Land Before Time'' is the only Don Bluth film of the 1980s in which [[Dom DeLuise]] did not participate (instead, he starred in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' that same year), and the only film in ''The Land Before Time'' series that is not a musical, as well as the only one to be released theatrically worldwide. It was also the last film that Bluth directed that was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nThe film was released by Universal on November 18, 1988, to generally positive reviews from critics and was a box office success, grossing $84.4 million. Its success, along with ''[[An American Tail]]'' and the 1988 live-action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' led Spielberg to found his animation studio, [[Amblimation]]. The first film spawned a franchise with thirteen [[direct-to-video]] sequels, [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|a television series]], [[List of The Land Before Time video games|video games]] and merchandise, none of which had Bluth, Spielberg nor Lucas' involvement (though Amblin Entertainment was involved in the television series like it was for ''[[Fievel's American Tails]]'').\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please read this before editing.

Among these, a mother in a diminished \"[[Apatosaurus|longneck]]\" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot encounters Cera, a \"three-horn\" (''[[Triceratops]]''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landbeforetime.com/dino_friends_cera.html|title=Land Before Time Characters: Cera &#124; Land Before Time Movies|date=June 14, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614120801/http://www.landbeforetime.com/dino_friends_cera.html|archive-date=June 14, 2006}}</ref> until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with longnecks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes other kinds of dinosaurs, who only associate with their own species. That night, as Littlefoot follows a \"hopper\" (''[[Triadobatrachus]]''), he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large \"sharptooth\" (''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'') attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but is mortally wounded in the process. An earthquake swallows up the sharptooth and divides Littlefoot, Cera, and other dinosaurs from their herds; several die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who first gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies, \"Littlefoot, let your heart guide you. It whispers, so listen closely.\" Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old dinosaur named Rooter (who is also narrating the story), who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the \"Mountains that Burn\" (volcanoes).\n\nLater, Littlefoot meets a \"bigmouth\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landbeforetime.com/dino_friends_ducky.html|title=Ducky Land Before Time &#124; Land Before Time DVDs|date=April 5, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405114113/http://www.landbeforetime.com/dino_friends_ducky.html|archive-date=April 5, 2006}}</ref> (''[[Saurolophus]]'') named Ducky and a \"flyer\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landbeforetime.com/dino_friends_petrie.html|title=Dinosaurs Land Before Time &#124; Petrie Dino|date=April 5, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405114138/http://www.landbeforetime.com/dino_friends_petrie.html|archive-date=April 5, 2006}}</ref> (''[[Pteranodon]]'') named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey.

Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of longnecks<!-- Formerly linked to Diplodocus. -->. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, she and everyone else gravitate to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.\n\nThe next morning, they are attacked by the sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Before the volcanic range, a clash between Littlefoot's intention to follow his mother's directions and Cera's strong-willed insistence on going a different way results in a fight breaking out between them that causes the others to follow Cera, forcing Littlefoot to continue alone. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by [[lava]] and Petrie gets stuck in a [[tar pit]], Littlefoot returns to rescue them. Cera gets ambushed by a pack of \"domeheads\" (''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'') who are also living in the Mountains that Burn; the rest of the group pose as a tar monster, scaring away the domeheads and frightening Cera. When she realizes who it really is, Cera angrily leaves the group. It is not long, however, before it becomes clear that her pride had been wounded, as Cera is reluctant to admit that her stubbornness and selfishness nearly put others in danger. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.\n\nThe plan nearly fails when the sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera, having finally overcome her sorrow, reunites with the group and headbutts the boulder, causing the sharptooth to fall into the water below, the boulder crashing into him in the process. The sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him, seemingly to his death, but Petrie later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot finds his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a loving hug.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Land Before Time characters}}\n* [[Gabriel Damon]] as Littlefoot\n* [[Candace Hutson]] as Cera\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Ducky\n* [[Will Ryan]] as Petrie\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Littlefoot's mother\n* [[Burke Byrnes]] as Cera's father\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Littlefoot's grandfather\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Narrator (Rooter)\n\n== Production ==\nDuring production of ''[[An American Tail]]'', talk began of the next feature with Bluth and executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]]. Bluth and Spielberg wanted to do a film similar to ''[[Bambi]]'', but with dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg's longtime friend [[George Lucas]] was also brought in on the project after being interested with it. The three persuaded ''An American Tail'' writers [[Judy Freudberg]] and [[Tony Geiss]] (both of whom were also prominent writers for ''[[Sesame Street]]'') to write the screenplay for the film. Their initial draft was based on their early ideas, but when it was felt the story was too juvenile, Stu Krieger was brought on to revise their draft.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=110}} Early into story development, the film was about a group of young dinosaurs looking for a wise, older dinosaur.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=111}} Later on, Bluth explained, \"...we came up with another idea that none of these dinosaurs get along with each other, they all hate each other. They're taught from the time they were born not to associate with each other, that's racism.\"{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=110}} An early working title for the film was ''The Land Before Time Began''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |pages=354}}</ref> Bluth, Spielberg and Lucas originally wanted the film to have no dialogue, like ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', but the idea was abandoned in favor of using voice actors in order to make it appealing to children.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=110}} \n\n=== Animation ===\nAs work on the script continued, Bluth delegated some of the animation staff to begin creating concept art. As with his previous films, Bluth handled the storyboarding but with final revisions by Larry Leker. Production was initially delayed by several months as the studio moved to [[Ireland]]. Production would eventually begin in spring 1987, a few months after the release of ''An American Tail''.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=111}}\n\nThe production was preceded by extensive research, including visits to natural history museums in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC. Skeletons, fossils, and paleoart from the turn of the century were consulted to help create a credible landscape and animals. Further research was conducted using live-action footage of quadrupedal modern animals, including elephants and giraffes.<ref>{{cite AV media|people= Bluth, Don (Director) |title= The Land Before Time - Special CAV Collector\u2019s Edition (1988) |medium= Laserdisc|publisher= MCA Universal Home Video |date= 1996}}</ref>\n\n=== Editing ===\nLate into production, ''The Land Before Time'' underwent a severe cutting and editing of footage. Spielberg and Lucas thought that some scenes in the movie would appear too dark and intense for young children. At a screening in Soho Square, London in late April 1988, six months before the film was completed, Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film, \"It's too scary. We'll have kids crying in the lobby, and a lot of angry parents. You don't want that.\"{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=112}} A total of 19 fully animated shots from the sharptooth attack were cut from the final film, to attain a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G rating]] instead of a PG rating. Examples can be seen in the storyboards of the chase sequence in the briar patch. POV shots of sharptooth's snapping jaws were deleted, and shots were rearranged to shorten the sequence.<ref>https://markpudleiner.blogspot.com/2015/04/don-bluth-storyboards-2-land-before.html Part 1 \u2013 Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> This results in continuity errors, depicting the Tyrannosaur with his right eye still open after it had been blinded.<ref>https://markpudleiner.blogspot.com/2015/06/part-2-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref><ref>https://markpudleiner.blogspot.com/2015/10/part-3-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> \n\nPerhaps just weeks before the film's release, more than 10 additional minutes of footage was cut from the film by Spielberg \"to be sure it would not disturb parents or their children\", according to producer Gary Goldman, reducing the runtime from 80-82 minutes to just 69 minutes. Much of the cut footage also consisted of sequences of the five young dinosaurs in grave danger and distress. An extended scene involving the introduction of Spike was deleted, as was some of the \"Green Food\" sequence. Petrie's apparent death scene originally went longer, and was followed by a group hug where Littlefoot says \"Now we'll always be together.\" (this line survives in the form of a Pizza Hut promotional advertisement for the film). The film's final act was also heavily altered and rearranged; originally, Littlefoot was to find the Great Valley on his own before turning back to rescue his friends, kill sharptooth, and enter the valley as a group. This ending survives in multiple book adaptations, and the music accompanying it still exists in the official soundtrack release. Some screams were re-voiced using milder exclamations.{{sfn|Cawley|1991|p=112}} The scenes are believed to be destroyed, but some did make it into multiple advertisements and trailers created before the release of the film, and multiple stills can be found in storybook adaptations and press kits for the movie. Much of the unused music from the film score was meant to play over the deleted scenes. Many animation cels and drawings from the deleted scenes have surfaced on the internet.\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = November 21, 1988<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5Q |title=James Horner, Diana Ross \u2013 The Land Before Time |website=Amazon |access-date=October 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length       = 57:49 (original release)<br />74:00 (2020 expansion)\n| label        = [[MCA Records]] (1988)<br />[[Geffen Records]] (2013)<br />[[Intrada Records]] (2020)\n| producer     = [[James Horner]]\n| chronology   = Don Bluth Music of Films\n| prev_title   = [[An American Tail]]\n| prev_year    = 1986\n| next_title   = [[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]\n| next_year    = 1989\n| misc         = {{Singles\n | name        = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[If We Hold on Together]]\n | single1date = November 5, 1988\n}}\n}}\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mw0000202560|pure_url=yes}}]\n|rev2 = [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]]\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmtracks.com/titles/land_before.html |title=Filmtracks: The Land Before Time (James Horner) |publisher=Filmtracks |access-date=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nThe music for ''The Land Before Time'' was composed by [[James Horner]], who had previously provided the soundtrack for ''An American Tail'', and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|Choir of King's College]].

Littlefoot does not undergo crucifixion or resurrection, making other typological interpretations more persuasive. The journey to the Great Valley, which is to the west, mirrors that of the Mormon pioneers, who moved from fertile lands in the east to the arid and mountainous great basin. Astle concludes that \"Littlefoot is both a Joseph Smith\u2014he sees a pillar of light and receives heavenly visitors\u2014and a Brigham Young\u2013he leads his followers across the plains.\"<ref name=Astle>{{Cite journal|last=Astle|first=Randy|date=2009|title=What Is Mormon Cinema?

Bluth, Spielberg, and Lucas have no affiliation with any of the film's sequels. The sequels have generally been met with mixed reception: many fans of the original disregarded the sequels, while others have embraced the sequels into the canon of the story.\n\nIn 2007, a television series was released in North America. It follows the style of the sequels in terms of the morality and the musical numbers (with some of the songs being shortened, and reworked).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book |last=Cawley |first=John |title=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |year=1991 |chapter=The Land Before Time |pages=103\u2013116 |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8 |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Portal|United States|Film|1980s|Cartoon|Animation|Dinosaurs}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.uphe.com/movies/the-land-before-time}}\n* {{IMDb title|0095489|The Land Before Time}}\n* {{TCMDb title|80741|The Land Before Time}}\n* {{amg movie|28159|The Land Before Time}}\n* {{mojo title|landbeforetime|The Land Before Time}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|land_before_time|The Land Before Time}}\n\n{{The Land Before Time}}\n{{Don Bluth}}\n{{Lucasfilm}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Universal Animation Studios}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Land Before Time 01, The}}\n[[Category:The Land Before Time films]]\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 animated films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s children's adventure films]]\n[[Category:1980s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy films]]\n[[Category:1988 drama films]]\n[[Category:Amblin Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Amblin Entertainment animated films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated drama films]]\n[[Category:American buddy drama films]]\n[[Category:Irish animated films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Animated buddy films]]\n[[Category:Animated coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:Films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:Films about earthquakes]]\n[[Category:Films about famine]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television shows]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Don Bluth]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Pomeroy]]\n[[Category:Lucasfilm films]]\n[[Category:Lucasfilm animated films]]\n[[Category:American drama road movies]]\n[[Category:Rotoscoped films]]\n[[Category:Sullivan Bluth Studios films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures animated films]]\n[[Category:1980s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about friendship]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Irish children's films]]"}]}}}}
