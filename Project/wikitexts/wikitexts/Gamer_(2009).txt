Alongside Butler and Lerman, it also stars [[Michael C. Hall]], [[Ludacris]], [[Amber Valletta]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Alison Lohman]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Sam Witwer]] and [[Zo\u00eb Bell]].\n\n''Gamer'' was released in North America on September 4, 2009, receiving generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $43 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Gamer.svg|thumb|267px|Textual logo]]\nIn 2034, [[computer programmer]] Ken Castle ([[Michael C. Hall]]) invents self-replicating [[nanite]]s that replace [[brain tissue]] and allow humans to control other humans' actions and see through their eyes.  The first application of Castle's \"Nanex\" technology is a [[virtual community]] [[life simulation game]], ''Society'', which allows [[gamer]]s to manipulate live actors as their [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]s.  ''Society'' becomes a worldwide sensation, making Castle the richest man in the world. He then creates ''Slayers'', a [[first-person shooter]] where the \"characters\" are [[death-row]] prisoners using real weapons in specially created arenas.  Unlike ''Society'' actors, ''Slayers'' participants are not paid; instead, they volunteer in exchange for the promise that any Slayer who survives 30 matches will earn his freedom (though no one ever has).\n\nJohn \"Kable\" Tillman (Butler) is the crowd's favorite, having survived a record 27 matches (no inmate before him has managed to last more than ten). He is exclusively controlled by Simon (Lerman), a seventeen-year-old superstar gamer from a wealthy family.\n\nAn activist organization called the \"Humanz\" hacks a talk-show interview with Castle and claims that his technology will one day be used to [[mind control|control people against their will]]. The Humanz also disrupt ''Society'' play, but Castle sees both these actions as trivial.  However, Castle feels threatened by Kable's winning streak, and introduces a new inmate into ''Slayers'', Hackman (Crews), specifically to kill Kable.  Unknown to anyone else, Hackman will not be controlled by a player, and thus not be handicapped by the [[Lag (online gaming)|\"ping\"]] that causes a small but dangerous delay between the player's command and the Slayer's action.\n\nKable/Tillman's wife, Angie (Valletta), works as a ''Society'' character, but in spite of her earnings, she is refused custody of their daughter Delia, who has been placed with a wealthy family.\n\nThe Humanz contact Kable and Simon separately, warning them that Castle has no intention of letting Kable survive, and offer to create a [[Mod (gaming)|mod]] that will let him escape, but only if Simon relinquishes control during the game.  The escape is successful, and news outlets report that Kable has been [[fragging|fragged]], which puts Simon in a difficult position: he is labeled a \"cheater\", locked out of his bank account, and investigated by the [[FBI]] for helping Kable escape.\n\nTillman is brought to the Humanz' hideout; he refuses to help their fight against Castle, but learns of Angie's current location in ''Society''.  He rescues her, escaping from both Hackman and Castle's security forces. They are met by Gina (Sedgwick), the talk show host, secretly assisting the Humanz.  The Humanz deactivate the nanites in Angie and Tillman's brains, and Tillman remembers that the original nanites were tested on him while he was still in the military.  Under Castle's control, Tillman shot and killed his best friend, and was imprisoned.\n\nUpon learning that Castle is the wealthy father who adopted Delia, Tillman infiltrates his mansion to get her back. He locates Castle, who  reveals that his henchmen have already tracked down the Humanz' lair and killed all of them.  He also reveals that 98% of his own brain has been replaced with nanites, but this allows him to control others, rather than be controlled.  He plans to release air-borne nanites which will infect the entire United States within six months, giving him ultimate control. Hackman attacks Tillman, who easily kills him.  Tillman then attacks Castle, but is frozen in place, as Castle explains that his men have reactivated his and Angie's nanites.\n\nUnknown to Castle, Gina and Trace (Lohman) escaped the murder of the Humanz, and patch into the Nanex, revealing the confrontation to the world and exposing Castle's plans, much to the disgust of the people worldwide.  It also unblocks Simon's account and restores his control of Tillman.\n\nCastle tries to manipulate Tillman into killing his own daughter, but he resists, and then Simon's control allows him to attack Castle.  He and Simon wrestle for control over Tillman, but Tillman tells Castle to imagine Tillman's knife stabbing him. Castle unconsciously does so, allowing Tillman to kill him and removing his control over everyone.  With Castle dead, the world population cheers for the demise of their potential slaver and dictator, Tillman convinces his technicians to deactivate the Nanex, freeing all the \"characters\" in ''Society'' and ''Slayers''.\n\nThe film closes with the Tillman family taking a trip down a country road, ending with the words \"Game Over\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as John \"Kable\" Tillman, the highest-ranked warrior in the game ''Slayers''. \n* [[Amber Valletta]] as Angie \"Nika\" Roth Tillman, Kable's wife, an avatar in ''Society''. \n* [[Michael C.
