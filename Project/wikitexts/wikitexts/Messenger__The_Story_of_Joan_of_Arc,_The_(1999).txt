The screenplay was written by Besson and [[Andrew Birkin]], and the original score was composed by [[\u00c9ric Serra]].\n\n''The Messenger'' portrays the story of St. [[Joan of Arc]], the French war heroine and religious [[martyr]] of the [[Hundred Years War]]. It begins with young Joan as she witnesses the atrocities of the English against her family, and she has visions that inspire her to lead the French in battle against the occupying English. Her success in routing the English allows Charles VII to take the throne. Eventually Joan is captured by the English, tried and executed for heresy.\n\nBesson's previous film, ''[[The Fifth Element]]'', which also starred Jovovich, was a critical and financial success, and had a positive influence on both of their careers. ''The Messenger'' was intended to follow up that success and cement Besson's and Jovovich's status in film.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=161}} However, it received mixed reviews and underperformed at the box office,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/people/luc-besson/AA3lA7Q |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128094437/http://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/people/luc-besson/AA3lA7Q |archive-date=28 November 2014 |url-status=dead |title=Luc Besson |work=[[MSN]] |access-date=5 October 2014 }}</ref> earning just under $67 million on a $60 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot is already at maximum length allowed as per WP:Mosfilm#Plot, please do not expand it -->\nAs a child, Joan has a violent and supernatural vision. She returns home to find her village burning. Her sister Catherine tries to protect her by hiding her from the attacking English forces, part of a longstanding rivalry with France. Joan, while hiding, witnesses the brutal murder and rape of her sister. Afterward, Joan is taken in by distant relatives.\n\nSeveral years later at [[Chinon]], the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] and soon to be King of France, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] ([[John Malkovich]]), receives a message from the now-teenager Joan ([[Milla Jovovich]]), asking him to provide an army to lead into battle against the occupying English. After meeting him and his mother-in-law [[Yolande of Aragon]] ([[Faye Dunaway]]) she describes her visions. Desperate, he believes her prophecy.\n\nClad in armor, Joan leads the French army to the besieged city of [[Orl\u00e9ans]]. She gives the English a chance to surrender, which they refuse. The armies' commanders, skeptical of Joan's leadership, initiate the next morning's battle to take over the stockade at St. Loup without her. By the time she arrives on the battlefield, the French soldiers are retreating. Joan ends the retreat and leads another charge, successfully capturing the fort. They proceed to the enemy stronghold called the \"[[Siege_of_Orl\u00e9ans#Assault_on_the_Tourelles|Tourelles]].\" Joan gives the English another chance to surrender, but they refuse. Joan leads the French soldiers to attack the Tourelles, though the English defenders inflict heavy casualties, also severely wounding Joan. Nevertheless, Joan leads a second attack the following day. As the English army regroups, the French army moves to face them across an open field. Joan rides alone toward the English and offers them a final chance to surrender and return to England. The English accept her offer and retreat.\n\nJoan  [[March to Reims|returns to Rheims]] to witness the coronation of Charles VII of France. Her military campaigns then continue to the walls of [[Paris]], though she does not receive her requested reinforcements, and the siege is a failure. Joan tells King Charles VII to give her another army, but he refuses, saying he now prefers diplomacy over warfare. Believing she threatens his position and will require the expenditure of treasure, Charles conspires to get rid of Joan by allowing her to be captured by enemy forces. [[Siege of Compi\u00e8gne|She is taken prisoner by the pro-English Burgundians]] at [[Compi\u00e8gne]], who sell her to the English. Led in chains, her trial begins.\n\nCharged with the crime of [[heresy]], based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is [[Trial of Joan of Arc|tried]] in an [[ecclesiastical court]] proceeding, which is forced by the English occupation government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. [[Pierre Cauchon|Bishop Cauchon]] expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught that she will be executed without making a final [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.\n\nThe frustrated English devise another way to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes, and give her men's clothing to wear. They then state she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, suggesting that she is a witch who must be burned. Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of [[Rouen]], though a postscript adds that [[Canonization of Joan of Arc|she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century]].\n<!-- Plot is already at maximum length allowed as per WP:Mosfilm#Plot, please do not expand it -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as [[Joan of Arc]] \n* [[John Malkovich]] as [[Charles VII of France]]\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as [[Yolande of Aragon]]\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as The Conscience\n* [[Andrew Birkin]] as [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|John Talbot]]\n* Jane Valentine as Joan of Arc 8 years old\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as [[Gilles de Rais]]\n* [[Pascal Greggory]] as [[John II of Alen\u00e7on|John II, Duke of Alen\u00e7on]]\n* [[Richard Ridings]] as [[La Hire]]\n* [[Desmond Harrington]] as [[Jean d'Aulon]]\n* [[Timothy West]] as [[Pierre Cauchon]]\n* [[Gina McKee]] as [[Anne of Burgundy|Duchess of Bedford]]\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as [[Jean de Dunois]]\n* [[Joseph Malerba]] as Beaurevoir's Guard\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as Buck\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nLuc Besson stated that he was not interested in narrating the history of Joan of Arc; rather, he wanted to pull a message out of history that is relevant for today. Besson states that in order to achieve this he stepped away from the factual narrative of the 15th century, instead trying to get behind the \"exterior envelope\" and into both the emotional effect and affect of Joan. In the book ''The Films of Luc Besson'', Susan Hayward interprets this as meaning Besson sought to follow Joan emotionally, revealing her doubts and demonstrating that one cannot return intact from the experience of war.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=165}}\n\nAs the medievalist Gwendolyn Morgan observes, Joan's sanity is a continuing theme throughout the film, beginning with the priest questioning her as a child and ending with her conversations with 'The Conscience' in the film's final scenes.  Scholars view The Conscience as providing a postmodern explanation of Joan's visions. At the time that Joan lived, her voices and visions would not have been doubted.<ref name=studies/> John Aberth, writing in the book ''A Knight at the Movies'' stated the filmmakers invented The Conscience to satisfy a modern audience that is aware of mental illness.<ref name=\"Movies and the Maid\">{{cite book|last1=Aberth|first1=John|title=A Knight at the Movies|date=2012|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-25726-2|pages=257\u2013298}}</ref> The film was also said to have \"[[feminist]] undercurrents\"; after Joan witnesses the rape of her sister, her crusade is said to become \"a fight against male domination and the abuse of women.\"<ref name=studies>{{cite book |date=23 January 2003 |title=Studies in Medievalism XII: Film and Fiction: Reviewing the Middle Ages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZW_NxMH_JcC&pg=PA40 |publisher=[[Boydell & Brewer|D.S.

Joan also manages to triumph in battle where those with more experience and knowledge could not, made especially apparent by her use of a siege weapon backward to force open a gate.<ref name=\"Shooting the Messenger\"/>\n\n==Production==\nLuc Besson was originally hired as executive producer for a film that was to be directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]]. Bigelow had been developing ideas for a Joan of Arc film for about a decade. Her film was to be entitled ''Company of Angels'', with [[Jay Cocks]] hired to write the script. The film was to be made with Besson's assistance and financial backing. In July 1996 contracts between Bigelow and Besson were exchanged, which gave Besson the right to be consulted on casting in addition to his personal fee. According to Bigelow, eight weeks prior to filming, Besson realised that his then wife, Milla Jovovich, was not going to be cast as Joan. He subsequently withdrew his support from the film, and with it the support of his financial backers. Bigelow threatened legal action for [[breach of contract]] and \"stealing her research\";<ref>{{cite book |last=Schubart |first=Rikke |date=3 April 2007 |title=Super Bitches and Action Babes: The Female Hero in Popular Cinema, 1970&ndash;2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vVWBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA273 |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |page=273 |isbn=978-0-7864-2924-0 }}</ref> the matter was settled out of court.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=161}} After Besson left, he commenced production of his own Joan of Arc project, ''The Messenger'', with Jovovich given the lead role; the production of ''Company of Angels'' disbanded shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jermyn |first1=Deborah |last2=Redmond |first2=Sean |date=15 January 2003 |title=The Cinema of Kathryn Bigelow: Hollywood Transgressor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtShseOVCe4C&pg=PA11 |publisher=[[Wallflower Press]] |page=11 |isbn=978-1-903364-42-0 }}</ref> ''The Messenger'' was intended to follow up the success Besson and Jovovich achieved with their previous collaboration, ''[[The Fifth Element]]''.{{sfn|Hayward|2009|page=161}}\n\nFilming took place in the [[Czech Republic]].
