The film, starring [[Robert Englund]], [[Jenna Jameson]], [[Penny Drake]], and [[Roxy Saint]], was distributed by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a news montage showing a [[Dystopian|dystopic]] near-future in which [[George W. Bush]] has been elected to a fourth term. The [[United States Congress]] has been disbanded; public nudity is banned; the United States is embroiled in wars with [[France]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Syria]], [[Venezuela]], [[Canada]], and [[Alaska]]. Due to there being too few soldiers for all the wars, a secret laboratory run by Dr. Chushfeld in fictional Sartre, Nebraska, has developed a virus to re-animate dead Marines and send them back into battle. However, this virus has broken containment and infected test subjects and scientists, and they are at risk of escaping from the lab. A team of Marines code-named the \"Z\" Squad is sent in to destroy the zombies. One of the Marines named Byrdflough is bitten but escapes. He ends up in an alley outside an underground [[strip club]] named \"Rhino\". The Marine dies and awakens as a zombie who goes into the club.\n\n\"Rhino\" is run by Ian Essko. A new stripper named Jessy has arrived at the club to save up enough money for her grandmother's operation. She is introduced to the club's dancers, including star dancer Kat. Kat begins her dance on the stage, but is attacked by Byrdflough. Essko, concerned about losing his best dancer, lets her go back on stage as a zombie. To everyone's surprise, Kat is a better and more popular dancer as a zombie than she was as a human.\n\nThe other strippers now find themselves faced with the prospect of losing their customers, as the customers prefer zombie strippers to human strippers. One by one, the human strippers become zombies, some by choice in order to compete or (in the case of [[gothic rock]] stripper Lillith) for fun. During private dances, the zombie strippers bite and kill their customers. Essko tries to keep the zombies hidden in a cage in the club's cellar, but eventually, the zombies escape after Gaia, wanting to become one, releases the zombies who overrun the club. Kat and the underrated stripper Jeannie fight for supremacy. The remaining humans in the club struggle to survive until the \"Z\" Squad burst in to destroy the zombies. They discover that the zombies have been allowed to escape by the Bush Administration in the hopes that the ensuing zombie plague would distract Americans from their gross mishandling of the war effort and the economy.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Jenna Jameson Penny Drake Zombie Strippers.jpg|thumb|upright|Penny Drake and Jenna Jameson on the set]]\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Robert Englund]] as Ian Essko\n*[[Jenna Jameson]] as Kat\n*[[Roxy Saint]] as Lillith\n*[[Penny Drake]] as Sox\n*Joey Medina as Paco\n*Whitney Anderson as Gaia\n*[[Jennifer Holland]] as Jessy\n*Shamron Moore as Jeannie\n*Jeannette Sousa as Bereng\u00e9\n*Carmit Levite as Madame Blavatski\n*Johnny D.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 39% based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's consensus states: \"Though intentionally campy, ''Zombie Strippers'' suffers from poor execution, and never rises above its silly premise.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zombie_strippers/|title=Zombie Strippers (2008)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|access-date=August 18, 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 15 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/zombie-strippers!|title=Zombie Strippers reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=August 18, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIt has been criticised as having poor production values, and poor execution, while recognizing its intentionally [[Camp (style)|camp style]] and its attempt as a [[satire]]. The film absurdly transforms the classic zombie introduced in ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (1932), a mindless being without human traits, into nice, sexually attractive and desirable creatures.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pop|first=Doru|title=The Desecration of Bodies.
