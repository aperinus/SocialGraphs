He then decided to collaborate with [[Peter Tosh]] and Bunny Wailer to create \u201cThe Wailers.\u201d This group later became known as \u201c[[Bob Marley and the Wailers]]\u201d and achieved international fame. The group made Bob Marley a household name and brought worldwide attention to [[Jamaica|Jamaican culture]], [[Reggae|Reggae music]] and the [[Rastafari|Rastafari movement]].\n\nThroughout the documentary, much of the content deals with Marley's struggle with racial identity and acceptance. Marley's widow, [[Rita Marley]] stated \u201cthey saw Bob as an outcast, because he didn\u2019t really belong to anyone. You\u2019re in-between. You\u2019re black and white; so you\u2019re not even black.\u201d Livingston also comments that Marley was harassed in school for being mixed race. On his race, Marley stated:\n\n\"I don't have prejudice against meself. My father was a white and my mother was black. Them call me half-caste or whatever. Me don't dip on nobody's side. Me don't dip on the black man's side nor the white man's side. Me dip on [[Jah|God's]] side, the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white.\"\n\nMarley's journey to become a member of the [[Rastafari movement]] is documented in the film starting with his friendship with Rastafari preacher [[Mortimer Planno]]. Marley firmly states several times that he is a key part of the Rastafari movement: the belief that the [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] of [[Ethiopia]], [[Haile Selassie I]], is the reincarnation of [[Jesus of Nazareth|Christ]]. Rita Marley stated that she also converted to Rastafari upon the visit of Selassie I to Jamaica when she saw \u201cmarks in his hands\u201d, similar to those Jesus bore when he was nailed to the cross.\n\nMarley's love of Rastafari was brought out in lyrics of songs such as, [[Exodus (Bob Marley & The Wailers song)|\u201cExodus\u201d]] and  \u201c[[Jah Live]]\u201d. Marley's inspiration for other songs is addressed in the documentary. Examples of this are \u201cCorner Stone\u201d, which dealt with the rejection of Marley by white relatives on his father's side; \u201cWork\u201d, which dealt with Jamaica's political conflicts; and [[Zimbabwe (song)|\u201cZimbabwe\u201d]], which dealt with the [[Zimbabwe]]an  [[Chimurenga#Second Chimurenga|liberation movement]].\n\nThroughout Marley's life, he had a total of eleven children with seven women, despite being married from a young age. When asked if he was married, Marley responded:\n\n\"No. You see, I can\u2019t deal with the [[Western world|Western]] ways of life. If I must live by a law, it must be the laws of [[Haile Selassie I|His Majesty]]. If it\u2019s not the laws of His Majesty, then I can make my own law.\"\n\nMarley's most famous relationship was with [[Cindy Breakspeare]] ([[Miss World 1976]]). From this relationship, Breakspheare had Marley's son, [[Damian Marley]]. When asked about how she felt about Marley's relationships with other women, Rita Marley responded:\n\n\"I became his guardian angel. By that time, I was past the service of being a wife because of the importance of who I knew Bob is. I didn\u2019t see it as a fun trip. We were on a mission. It was like an evangelist campaign to bring people closer to [[Jah]].\"\n\nMarley's death is uniquely depicted in the documentary. In 1977, Marley found out that he had a [[tumor|cancerous sore]] on his right big toe. It is believed that the sore on his toe was the result of a cancer that was already spreading in Marley's body. Contrary to those sources, Rita Marley is quoted in saying:\n\n\"Somebody stepped on it with their spiked boots and it started to get infested. But Bob would still play football the next day on it, and the next day.\"\n\nThe documentary also conducts interviews with Rastafari doctors, which shows Marley's strict adherence to the religion. Rastafari doctor, Carleton Fraser, states that \u201cdoctors recommended amputation of the hip and removing the entire leg.\u201d [[Chris Blackwell]] gives conflicting information and insists that they just needed to amputate Marley's big toe for him to survive. Later, when Marley started losing his hair in the course of chemotherapy treatment for his cancer, family members also state that Marley had much displeasure in cutting off his dreadlocks, an aspect of Rastafarism, which was unfortunately necessitated by the physical pain their heavy weight was causing him.\n\nThe film ends with Marley saying a quote that was the overall message in his music:\n\t\n\"I don\u2019t really have any ambition, you know? I only have one thing I\u2019d really like to see happen. I\u2019d like to see mankind living together. Black, White, Chinese , everyone. That\u2019s all.\"\n\nDuring the credits, it shows people from many countries singing the performing \u201c[[Get Up, Stand Up]]\u201d and [[One Love/People Get Ready|\u201cOne Love\u201d]].\n\nInterviews conducted and featured include: [[Cedella Marley Booker]], [[Rita Marley]], [[Bunny Livingston]], [[Ziggy Marley]], [[Cindy Breakspeare]], [[Aston Barrett]], Constance Marley (half-sister), Peter Marley (second cousin), [[Chris Blackwell]], [[Peter Tosh]], [[Lee Jaffe]], [[Donald Kinsey]], [[Edward Seaga]], [[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Junior Marvin]].\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Marley (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[soundtrack]] to ''Marley'' was released four days prior to the film, on 16 April 2012.<ref name=\"Marley (The Original Soundtrack) iTunes\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/marley-original-soundtrack/id516864457|title= Marley (Original Soundtrack) \u2013 United States|work=[[iTunes]]|publisher=Apple, Inc.|access-date=April 21, 2012}}</ref> It contains 24 of the 66 tracks listed in the closing credits of the movie.
