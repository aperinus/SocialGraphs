It was produced by Fran\u00e7ois de Lannurien and Hel\u00e8ne Vager and its original music was composed by Harald Maury. Made on a low budget with no intelligible dialog, ''Themroc'' tells the story of a French [[blue collar]] worker who rebels against modern society, reverting into an urban [[caveman]]. The film's scenes of [[incest]] and [[cannibalism]] earned it adults-only ratings. It was the first film to be shown in the UK's [[Channel 4]]'s [[Red triangle (Channel 4)|red triangle]] series of controversial films in 1986. It has become a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://planetneukoln.biserika.ro/themrock-1973/ |title=THEMROC (1973) the Police Eater |accessdate=2015-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527114412/http://planetneukoln.biserika.ro/themrock-1973/ |archivedate=2017-05-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdretro.org.uk/special-discretion-required-the-controversial-channel-4-film-season.html|title=Cinema: Special Discretion Required: The Controversial Channel 4 Film Season|website=Weird Retro|accessdate=13 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Main cast==\n*[[Michel Piccoli]] as Themroc\n*[[B\u00e9atrice Romand]] as Sister of Themroc\n*[[Maril\u00f9 Tolo]] as Superior shapely secretary\n*[[Francesca Romana Coluzzi]] as Female neighbor\n*[[Jeanne Herviale]] as Mother\n*[[Patrick Dewaere]] as A police officer\n*[[Coluche]] as Male neighbor\n*[[Miou-Miou]] as the young neighbor\n\n==Sources==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0069369|title=Themroc}}\n* {{Amg movie|143357|Themroc}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1973 films]]\n[[Category:1970s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1973 comedy films]]\n[[Category:French satirical films]]\n[[Category:French political satire films]]\n[[Category:French avant-garde and experimental films]]\n[[Category:Films without speech]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]\n[[Category:Films about cannibalism]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Claude Faraldo]]\n[[Category:1970s avant-garde and experimental films]]\n[[Category:Films about cavemen]]\n[[Category:1970s French films]]\n\n\n{{1970s-France-film-stub}}\n{{1970s-comedy-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
