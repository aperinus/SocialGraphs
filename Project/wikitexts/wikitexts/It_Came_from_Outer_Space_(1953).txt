At the crash site, he discovers a round alien spaceship just before it is completely buried by a landslide. When he tells the local sheriff and newspaper editor what he saw, he is branded a crackpot. Before long, odd things begin to happen, and the disbelief turns hostile.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should always be between 400-700 words.-->\nIn the early 1950's, author and amateur astronomer John Putnam (Richard Carlson) and schoolteacher Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush) watch a large [[meteorite]] crash near the small town of Sand Rock, [[Arizona]]. They awaken a neighbor, who has a helicopter, and all three fly to the crash site. Putnam climbs down into the crater and notices a partially buried round object in the crater's pit. He comes to the realization, after he sees a six-sided hatchway close, that this isn't a meteorite but a large alien spaceship. The hatchway's noise starts a landslide that completely buries the craft. Putnam's story is later scoffed at by Sand Rock's sheriff (Charles Drake) and the local news media.\n\nEven Ellen Fields is unsure about what to believe but still agrees to assist Putnam in his investigation. Over the next several days, local people disappear; a few return, but they act distant or appear somewhat dazed and not their usual selves. Convinced by these and other odd events, Sheriff Warren comes to believe Putnam's story that the meteorite is actually a crashed spaceship with alien inhabitants; he then organizes a posse to hunt down the invaders at their crash site. Putnam, however, hopes to reach a peaceful solution to the looming crisis. Alone, he enters a nearby abandoned mine, which he hopes will eventually connect to the now buried spaceship and its alien occupants.\n\nPutnam finally discovers the spaceship and learns from the alien leader that they crashed on Earth by accident; the aliens appear benign and only plan to stay on Earth just long enough to repair their damaged craft and then continue on their voyage. The aliens' real appearance, when finally revealed to Putnam, is entirely non-human: they are large, single-eyed, almost jellyfish-like beings that seem to glide across the ground, leaving a glistening trail that soon vanishes. They are also able to [[shape shift]] into human form in order to appear human and move around Sand Rock, unobserved, in order to collect their much needed repair materials. To do this, they copy the human forms of the local townspeople that they have abducted. In doing so, however, they fail to reproduce the townspeople's exact personalities, leading to suspicion and eventually to the deaths of two of the aliens.\n\nNow that they have been discovered, the aliens have decided to destroy themselves and their spaceship. Putnam reasons with them at length and convinces the alien leader to instead finish the repairs while he, as a sign of the aliens' good faith, takes the captives outside to the sheriff. To protect the aliens from the sheriff and his advancing [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]], Putnam manages to seal off the mine in order to give them the time they still need to finish their spaceship repairs.\n\nShortly afterwards the alien spaceship finally leaves Earth. Putnam's fianc\u00e9e Ellen asks him if they are gone for good. He responds \"No, just for now. It wasn't the right time for us to meet. But there will be other nights, other stars for us to watch. They'll be back\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:It Came from Outer Space trailer(1953).webm|thumb|thumbtime=20|upright=1.3|Trailer]]\n\n* [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as John Putnam\n* [[Barbara Rush]] as Ellen Fields\n* [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]] as Sheriff Matt Warren\n* [[Joe Sawyer]] as Frank Daylon\n* [[Russell Johnson]] as George\n* [[Kathleen Hughes]] as Jane, George's girl\n* [[Alan Dexter]] as Dave Loring\n* [[Dave Willock]] as Pete Davis\n* [[Robert Carson (actor)|Robert Carson]] as Reporter Dugan\n* [[George Eldredge]] as Dr. Snell\n* Brad Jackson as Bob, Dr. Snell's assistant\n* Warren MacGregor as Toby\n* [[George Selk]] as Tom\n* [[Edgar Dearing]] as Sam\n* [[William Pullen]] as Deputy Reed\n* Virginia Mullen as Mrs. Daylon\n* Dick Pinner as Lober\n* Whitey Haupt as Perry, a boy<ref>{{AFI film|50887}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe screenplay by [[Harry Essex]], with input by [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]], was derived from an original and lengthy screen treatment by [[Ray Bradbury]]; screen legend says that Bradbury wrote the screenplay and Harry Essex merely changed the dialogue and took the credit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''It Came From Outer Space'' DVD Commentary by film historian Tom Weaver</ref> Unusual among science fiction films of the era, the alien \"invaders\" were portrayed by Bradbury as creatures stranded on Earth and without malicious intent toward humanity.
