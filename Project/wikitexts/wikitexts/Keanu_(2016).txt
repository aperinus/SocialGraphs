The film stars Peele and [[Keegan-Michael Key]] in their first film as lead actors following five seasons of their [[Key & Peele|sketch TV series]]; it also features [[Tiffany Haddish]], [[Method Man]], [[Nia Long]], [[Will Forte]], and [[Keanu Reeves]]. The plot follows two cousins who infiltrate a gang in order to retrieve their stolen kitten.\n\nFilming began in [[New Orleans]] in June 2015. The film premiered at the [[South by Southwest Festival]] on March 13, 2016, and was theatrically released in North America on April 29, 2016. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $20 million against its $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nAssassins the \"Allentown Brothers\", enter a Mexican cartel's drug-processing facility and kill everyone, including the boss, King Diaz. They try to take Diaz's kitten Iglesias, but the kitten escapes. Recently-dumped Rell finds the kitten on his doorstep and names it Keanu. Two weeks later, Rell and his cousin Clarence come home from seeing a movie to find Rell\u2019s place ransacked and Keanu missing.\n\nRell's weed dealer Hulka tells them the \"17th St. Blips\" gang may have raided Rell's looking for his cat. Hulka sends them to a strip club, where they meet Hi-C, a female gangster, and the gang's leader Cheddar, who mistakes them for the Allentown Boys. Cheddar says he will return the kitten if they act as expert advisors for the Blips on a run to sell a new drug called \"Holy Shit\". After the sale run, they are abducted by the real Allentown Boys.\n\nRell and Clarence are tied to chairs and the Allentown Boys prepare to torture them. Keanu frees Rell and Clarence, and they grab their guns. As the Allentown boys approach them, Clarence and Rell unload the guns into them. On their way out, searching for Keanu, they run into the Blips and Cheddar forces them to come along to meet with the Mexican drug cartel the next morning.\n\nThere, the Blips meet King Diaz's cousin, Bacon Diaz, offering Clarence and Rell, \u2018The Allentown Boys.\u2019 When Bacon also demands \"Iglesias\", Cheddar refuses and a gunfight erupts between the two gangs. Clarence and Rell shoot their way out of the mansion pursuing Bacon, who has Keanu, only for Rell to be shot in the leg and Clarence shot in the hand.\n\nRell, who never learned to drive, hijacks Bacon's escape car with Bacon and Keanu in the back; Clarence chases them. It ends at Clarence's front yard where Rell crashes, sending Bacon flying through the broken windshield. Bacon gets up and attempts to shoot Rell, but Clarence runs him over. Again, Bacon gets up, but is shot dead by Cheddar and the Blips.\n\nHi-C reveals herself as an undercover police officer. She forces the Blips to drop their guns and shoots Cheddar. The police arrive. Hi-C promises to testify for leniency and agrees to go on a date with Rell after they get out of jail.\n\nSix months later, Rell and Clarence have three weeks left on their jail sentences. They are respected by the inmates, including the Blips, for killing the Allentown Boys. Hi-C brings Keanu, telling Rell through a visitation phone that he has a rare disease which will cause him to stay a kitten forever.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Clarence Dresden<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite web|last=Bowles |first=Scott |url=https://deadline.com/2014/10/key-and-peele-movie-new-line-cinema-keanu-854553/|title=Key & Peele's First Feature Film To Start Production Next Spring|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=October 20, 2014|access-date=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Jordan Peele]] as Rell Dresden<ref name=\"deadline1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|first=Haileagh|last=Fouch|title=Key and Peele Star in Keanu Movie Red-Band Trailer|url=https://collider.com/key-and-peele-keanu-movie-red-band-trailer/|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=January 21, 2016|access-date=January 22, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Tiffany Haddish]] as Trina \"Hi-C\" Parker<ref>{{cite news|last=Callender|first=Samantha|url=http://thesource.com/2016/01/27/interview-tiffany-haddish-talks-homelessness-comedy-the-power-of-affirmations/|title=Interview: Tiffany Haddish Talks Homelessness, Comedy & the Power of Affirmations|work=[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]|date=January 27, 2016|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Method Man]] as Cheddar<ref name=\"variety1\">{{cite magazine|first=Justin|last=Kroll |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/method-man-joins-key-and-peele-comedy-keanu-1201493375/|title=Method Man Joins Key and Peele Comedy|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 12, 2015|access-date=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Mitchell]] as Bud\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Bacon Diaz\n* [[Nia Long]] as Hannah<ref>{{cite web|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|url=https://deadline.com/2015/06/nia-long-keanu-movie-casting-key-and-peele-1201445604/|title=Nia Long Cast In Key & Peele Movie 'Keanu'|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 16, 2015|access-date=July 3, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Will Forte]] as Hulka<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter2\">{{cite magazine|last=Kit|first=Borys|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/will-forte-star-key-peele-798567|title=Will Forte to Co-Star With Key and Peele in Comedy 'Keanu' (Exclusive)|magazine=[[Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 28, 2015|access-date=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Darrell Britt-Gibson]] as Trunk<ref name=GibsonCast>{{cite news|last1=Pedersen|first1=Erik|title=Josh Harto Finds 'Gold'; Raul Castillo Joins 'Special Correspondents' \u2013 Film Briefs|url=https://deadline.com/2015/06/josh-harto-cast-in-gold-raul-castillo-special-correspondent-darrell-britt-gibson-keanu-mikaela-hoover-belko-experiment-1201437407/|access-date=June 7, 2015|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Jamar Malachi Neighbors]] as Stitches\n* [[Rob Huebel]] as Spencer<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ford|first=Rebecca|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rob-huebel-joins-new-line-804604/|title=Rob Huebel Joins New Line Comedy 'Keanu'|magazine=[[Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 23, 2015|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref>\n* Ian Casselberry as King Diaz\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Keanu (voice)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/keanu-reeves-is-doing-a-voiceover-for-kitten-comedy-keanu|title=KEANU REEVES IS DOING A VOICEOVER FOR KITTEN COMEDY KEANU|website=[[IGN]]|last=Tilly|first=Chris|date=March 10, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Herself (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe film was officially announced by New Line Cinema in October 2014, with [[Peter Atencio]] directing.<ref name=\"deadline1\"/> Many sites reporting on the film had initially believed it to be a [[parody]] of the then recently released ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]'', but according to Atencio the two films were developed independently of each other, and the team was initially unaware of ''Wick'' until work on ''Keanu'' was already underway.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghahremani|first1=Tanya|title=Is 'Keanu' A Parody Of Keanu Reeves' 'John Wick'?
