The film was directed by [[Takashi Miike]] with a screenplay by Sh\u014dgo Mut\u014d, and stars [[Shun Oguri]], Ky\u014dsuke Yabe, [[Meisa Kuroki]], and [[Takayuki Yamada]]. The plot serves as a prequel to the manga, and focuses on the power struggle between gangs of students at Suzuran All-Boys High School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviexclusive.com/review/crowszero/crowszero.htm|title=Crows Zero (Kurozu Zero) (2007)|access-date=2008-06-16|author=Tyler Lim|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614025431/http://www.moviexclusive.com/review/crowszero/crowszero.htm|archive-date=2008-06-14}}</ref> The film was released in [[Japan]] on October 27, 2007. It has spawned two sequels, ''[[Crows Zero 2]]'' and ''[[Crows Explode]]'', as well as a manga adaptation released November 13, 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nNewly transferred high school senior Genji Takiya ([[Shun Oguri]]) arrives at Suzuran All-Boys High School, an institution infamous for its population of violent [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquents]]. During the freshman orientation assembly, yakuza arrive at the school seeking vengeance on third-year Serizawa Tamao ([[Takayuki Yamada]]) for assaulting some members of their gang. The thugs mistake Genji for their target and a brawl ensues on the school field. Meanwhile, Serizawa is visiting his best friend Tatsukawa Tokio (Kenta Kiritani), who has just been discharged from a hospital. Upon returning to the school, Serizawa witnesses Genji defeat the last of the yakuza.\n\nThat night, Genji goes to a nightclub he frequents and meets R&B singer Aizawa Ruka ([[Meisa Kuroki]]). He then goes to see his father, yakuza boss Takiya Hideo ([[Goro Kishitani]]), to whom he proclaims his ambition to conquer Suzuran, a feat which Hideo himself had attempted in his youth, but failed. Genji makes Hideo promise to acknowledge him as his successor should he succeed. The next day, Genji challenges Serizawa to a fight, but is halted by Tokio. He tells Genji that if he really wants to make an impression he should begin by defeating Rindaman, a legendary fighter at the school. After Rindaman refuses his challenge, Genji encounters Katagiri Ken (Kyosuke Yabe), one of the yakuza who'd come to the school the previous day. He attacks Genji in retaliation for getting his gang arrested, but is taken down with a single punch. Humbled, Ken goes with Genji to the club where they discuss the latter's plans for Suzuran.\n\nFollowing advice from Ken, Genji begins building his army, called \"Genji Perfect Seiha\" (a.k.a. \"GPS\"). Anticipating the brewing conflict, Serizawa also begins recruiting factions for his own cause. Genji succeeds in rallying several strong members, including Tamura Ch\u016bta, Makise Takashi, and Izaki Shun. Serizawa is alarmed by Genji's rapid rise to power, but chooses not to take action. One of Serizawa's lieutenants, Tokaji Y\u016bji, is not so ambivalent and begins covertly attacking members of the GPS, severely beating Ch\u016bta and putting Izaki in the hospital. The provocations cause tensions between the two armies to rise drastically, but Genji is prevented from acting by Makise. One night, Tokio and Serizawa visit the nightclub and encounter Genji. As Tokio runs interference between the opposing leaders, he suffers a seizure and is rushed to a hospital, where he learns that he has a [[cerebral aneurysm]] which requires surgery. Despite initial hesitation about the procedure's 30% success rate, Tokio agrees to the operation.\n\nTokaji approaches Band\u014d Hideto, leader of \"The Front of Armament\" biker gang, with a plan to kidnap Ruka and further aggravate Genji. Elsewhere, yakuza boss Yazaki J\u014dji orders Ken to kill Genji, disregarding the fact that doing so will incite a war between the yakuza organizations. The task proves to be too much for Ken, who has grown fond of Genji and begins lamenting his decision to become a yakuza in the first place. He decides to inform Takiya Hideo of the plot to kill his son. Genji gets a call from Ruka, who tells him that she is being held hostage by men with skulls on their jackets, and that her captors mentioned the name \"Band\u014d\". Surmising that her captors are The Armament, Genji gathers the GPS and proceeds to the biker gang's headquarters. A fight ensues, but Genji soon realizes that the men they are fighting are missing their trademark skull patches. Band\u014d demands an end to fight, revealing that he'd ordered the skulls be removed after part of The Armament aligned with Tokaji. After locating Tokaji and saving Ruka, Genji decides it's finally time for war against Serizawa. They decide to fight at 5:00pm the following day, at the same time that Tokio will undergo his operation, with Serizawa believing it will allow him to fight alongside Tokio.\n\nThe next day, as the battle begins, the tide seems to be in Serizawa's favor, but after Band\u014d's faction of The Armament arrives and joins the GPS, the odds are evened out. The fighting continues until only Serizawa and Genji are left standing. Meanwhile, Ken is taken to the harbor to be executed for disobeying the order to kill Genji. Yazaki gives Ken his coat as a parting gift before shooting him in the back. He falls into the water and begins to sink. Genji and Serizawa fight well into the night, and though injured and exhausted, Genji eventually gains the upper hand and triumphs. Clinging to consciousness, Serizawa receives a call from the hospital informing him that Tokio's operation was a success. Back at the docks, Ken suddenly recovers and swims to the surface. He discovers that the coat Yazaki had given to him was bulletproof, and that his \"execution\" was a ploy to allow him to leave the organization and live a different life.\n\nSeveral days later, Genji again challenges Rindaman, the final obstacle on his path to ruling Suzuran. Rindaman expresses his belief that Suzuran can never be truly conquered, and that there will always be someone left to fight. The film ends as the skirmish between Genji and Rindaman begins.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Genji Perfect Seiha (GPS) ===\n\n* Genji Takiya\n* Takashi Makise\n* Chuta Tamura\n* Izaki Shun\n\n=== Serizawa Army ===\n\n* Serizawa Tamao\n* Tatsukawa Tokio\n* Tokaji Y\u016bji\n* Tsutsumoto Shoji\n* The Mikami Brothers (ex-members)\n\n=== The Front of Armament (Second Year, Biker Gang) ===\n\n* Band\u014d Hideto\n\n=== Ebizuka Junior High Trio (First Year) ===\n\n* Kirishima Hiromi\n* Honj\u014d Toshiaki\n* Sugihara Makoto\n\n=== Unaffliliated ===\n\n* Rindaman / Hayashida Megumi\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shun Oguri]] as Genji Takiya\n* [[Takayuki Yamada]] as Serizawa Tamao\n* [[Sansei Shiomi]] - Yoshinobu Kuroiwa\n* [[Kenichi End\u014d]] - Joji Yazaki\n* [[Meisa Kuroki]] as Aizawa Ruka\n* Ky\u014dsuke Yabe as Katagiri Ken\n* [[Kenta Kiritani]] as Tatsukawa Tokio\n* Suzunosuke Tanaka as Tamura Ch\u016bta\n* [[Sousuke Takaoka]] as Izaki Shun\n* Goro Kishitani as Takiya Hideo\n* Motoki Fukami as Rindaman / Hayashida Megumi\n* Yusuke Izaki as Mikami Takeshi\n* Hisato Izaki as Mikami Manabu\n* [[Shunsuke Daito]] as Kirishima Hiromi\n* [[Yusuke Kamiji]] as Tsutsumoto Sh\u014dji\n* Tsutomu Takahashi as Makise Takashi\n* Yu Koyanagi as Sugihara Makoto\n* [[Kaname Endo]] as Tokaji Y\u016bji\n* Dai Watanabe as Band\u014d Hideto\n* Ryo Hashizume as Honj\u014d Toshiaki\n* [[Kazuki Namioka]] as Washio G\u014dta\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in Japan on October 27, 2007.
