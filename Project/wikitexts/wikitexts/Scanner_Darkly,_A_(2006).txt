Dick]]. The film tells the story of identity and deception in a near-future [[dystopia]] constantly under intrusive high-tech police surveillance in the midst of a drug addiction epidemic.\n\nThe film was [[Digital cinematography|shot digitally]] and then animated using [[Rotoshop|interpolated]] [[rotoscope]], an animation technique in which animators trace over the original footage frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films, giving the finished result a distinctive animated look. Principal photography began on May 17, 2004, and lasted six weeks.\n\nThe film features performances by [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Woody Harrelson]], and [[Winona Ryder]]. [[Steven Soderbergh]] and [[George Clooney]] are among the executive producers. ''A Scanner Darkly'' had a limited release on July 7, 2006, and then a wider release later that month by [[Warner Independent Pictures]]. The film was screened at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] and the 2006 [[Seattle International Film Festival]], and was a finalist for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]] in 2007. The film receives generally positive reviews, with praise for its performances and animation. \n\n== Plot ==\nThe United States has lost the [[war on drugs]]. Substance D, a powerful drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants.\n\nBob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate up the supply chain. Arctor has a vision of being in his house with a wife and two children in [[Anaheim, California]]; today he has two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend time taking D and having complex, possibly paranoiac examinations of their experiences. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a \"scramble suit\" that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and voice; he is known only by the code name \"Fred.\" Arctor's senior officer, \"Hank\", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other.\n\nSince going undercover, Arctor himself has become addicted to Substance D, and buys from Donna, who Arctor hopes to purchase large enough quantities of D from so that she is forced to introduce him to her own supplier. They have a tense, at times caring romantic relationship, but she rebuffs his physical advances.\n\nAt work, Hank orders \"Fred\" to increase surveillance on Arctor himself and his associates. Arctor's house is now at the center of his own investigation, since this is where Donna and the other addicts spend time. Arctor is inexpertly negotiating a double life, and his prolonged use of D is damaging his brain. Barris is informing on Arctor to Hank, arguing that Arctor is a terrorist, and angling to be hired as a cop himself. However, Barris unknowingly conveys this information in the presence of Arctor himself, whose identity at the time is hidden behind his scramble suit.\n\nHank reveals to \"Fred\" that he has long known that he is Arctor. Arctor seems legitimately surprised, and repeats his own name in a disoriented, unfamiliar tone. Hank informs him that the real purpose of the surveillance was to catch Barris, and that the police were deliberately increasing Barris' paranoia until he attempted to cover his tracks. Hank reprimands Arctor for becoming addicted to Substance D, and warns him that he will be disciplined. Hank explains how seriously brain damaged Arctor has become from D, and Hank \"phones\" Donna, asking her to come pick up Arctor and take him to New-Path, a corporation that runs a series of rehabilitation clinics. Hank immediately leaves, and in private removes his scramble suit, revealing Donna. At the New-Path clinic, Arctor and other D addicts show serious cognitive deficiencies.\n\n\"Donna\", now known as Audrey, meets with Mike, a fellow police officer. They discuss how New-Path is secretly responsible for the manufacture and distribution of Substance D. Audrey expresses her growing ethical aversion to their police work, in which they deliberately recruited Arctor \u2014 without his knowledge \u2014 to become addicted to D; his health sacrificed so that he might eventually enter a New-Path rehabilitation center unnoticed as a genuine addict, and collect incriminating evidence of New-Path's D farms. Audrey and Mike debate whether Arctor's mind will recover enough to grasp the situation.\n\nNew-Path sends Arctor to a labor camp at an isolated farm, where he mindlessly repeats what others tell him. Tending to corn crops, Arctor discovers hidden rows of the blue flowers that produce D. He secretly hides one flower in his boot, to bring to his friends at his next holiday from the farm.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Keanu Reeves]] as Bob Arctor/\"Fred\"\n*[[Robert Downey Jr.]] as James Barris\n*[[Woody Harrelson]] as Ernie Luckman\n*[[Winona Ryder]] as Donna Hawthorne/Audrey/\"Hank\"\n*[[Rory Cochrane]] as Charles Freck\n*Chamblee Ferguson as Medical Deputy 2\n*Angela Rawna as Medical Deputy 1\n*Mitch Baker as Brown Bear Lodge Host\n*[[Lisa Marie Newmyer]] as Connie\n*[[Dameon Clarke]] as Mike\n*Hugo Perez as New-Path Staff Member\n*[[Jason Douglas]] as New-Path Farm Manager\n*[[Marco Perella]] as Donald\n*[[Alex Jones]] as Street prophet with bullhorn\n*Sean Allen as Additional Fred Scramble Suit Voice ''(voice)''\n*Mark Turner as Additional Hank Scramble Suit Voice ''(voice)''\n*Leif Anders as Freck Suicide Narrator ''(voice)''\n*[[Turk Pipkin]] as The Creature\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nOriginally, [[Richard Linklater]] toyed with adapting the [[Philip K.

It was important to him that Dick's estate approve his film. Pallotta wrote a personal appeal and pitched a faithful adaptation of the novel to Russ Galen, the Philip K. Dick estate's literary agent who shared it with the late author's two daughters (Laura Leslie and [[Isa Dick Hackett|Isa Hackett]]) who own and operate their father's trust.<ref name=\"ashlock\">{{Cite news |last=Ashlock |first=Jesse |date=January\u2013February 2006 |title=What A Scanner Sees: Richard Linklater Animates a Philip K.

They felt that it was one of their father's most personal stories and liked that Linklater was not going to treat the drug aspects lightly,<ref name=\"production\" /> that he wanted to set it in the near future and make it right away.<ref name=\"ashlock\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\nFor the dual roles of Arctor and Fred, Linklater thought of [[Keanu Reeves]], but figured that the actor would have been reluctant to make another science fiction film after making [[The Matrix trilogy|''The Matrix'' trilogy]]. Robert Downey Jr. was attracted to the film when he heard Reeves was going to star and Linklater to direct. He thought that the script was the strangest one he had ever read. Linklater wrote the role of Freck with [[Rory Cochrane]] in mind.<ref name=\"production\" /> The actor was interested but did not want to recreate his role in ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]''. Both [[Woody Harrelson]] and [[Winona Ryder]] agreed to appear in the film based on the script. Reeves and Ryder agreed to work for the [[Screen Actors Guild]] scale rate plus any back-end profits.

The result was a fusion of Linklater's writing, the novel and the actors' input.<ref name=\"production\" /> To prepare for their respective roles, Cochrane came up with his character five minutes before he got on the elevator to work; Downey Jr. memorized his dialogue by writing it all out in run-on sentences, studying them and then converting them to acronyms; and Reeves relied on the book, marking down each scene in the screenplay to the corresponding page.<ref name=\"production\" />\n\nPrincipal photography began on May 17, 2004, and lasted six weeks.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> Arctor's house was located on Eric Circle in Southeast Austin. The previous tenants had left a month prior to filming and left the place in such a state that production designer Bruce Curtis had to make few modifications so that it looked like a run-down home.<ref name=\"production\" /> The filmmakers had looked at 60 houses before settling on this one. Linklater shot a lot of exteriors in [[Anaheim, California]] and then composited them into the Austin footage in post-production. Since the live action footage was to be animated over later, makeup, lighting and visible equipment, like boom mics, were less of a concern.<ref name=\"production\" /> However, cinematographer Shane Kelly carefully composed shots and used a color palette with the animators in mind. Sometimes, they would show up to tell Kelly what they needed. Because the movie was being shot digitally and then animated, occasionally actors forgot they would later be animated as they worked through a scene. Robert Downey Jr. noted that he completely forgot the scene would later be animated as he worked through several takes in order to produce the smoke ring that would be featured in Barris' first closeup shot.<ref name=\"roman\">{{Cite news |last=Roman |first=Julian |date=July 11, 2006 |title=Robert Downey Jr. Talks ''A Scanner Darkly'' and David Fincher's ''Zodiac'' |work=MovieWeb |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEEhdNJFY7GmIG |url-status=live |access-date=July 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219053728/http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEEhdNJFY7GmIG |archive-date=December 19, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nExtensive on-set footage of the filming of ''A Scanner Darkly'' was featured in a UK documentary about Richard Linklater directed by [[Irshad Ashraf]] and broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in December 2004.\n\n=== Animation ===\nAfter principal photography was finished, the film was transferred to [[QuickTime]] for an 18-month animation process: second order magnified contrast separation. ''A Scanner Darkly'' was [[Digital cinematography|filmed digitally]] using the [[Panasonic AG-DVX100]] and then animated with [[Rotoshop]], a proprietary graphics editing program created by [[Bob Sabiston]]. Rotoshop uses an [[animation]] technique called [[interpolation|interpolated]] [[rotoscope]], which was previously used in Linklater's film ''[[Waking Life]]''. Linklater discussed the ideas and inspiration behind his use of rotoscoping in Ashraf's documentary, linking it to his personal experiences of [[lucid dreaming]]. Rotoscoping in traditional [[cel animation]] originally involved tracing over film frame-by-frame. This is similar in some respects to the rotoscope style of filmmaker [[Ralph Bakshi]].<ref name=\"PM\">{{Cite web |last=Ma\u00e7ek III, J.C. |date=August 2, 2012 |title='American Pop'...

Most of the animators were hired locally with only a few of them having movie-making experience.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> Six weeks into the animation process, only a few animated sequences were close to being completed while Linklater was off making ''[[Bad News Bears]]''. Sabiston had divided the animators into five teams and split the work amongst them. However, there was poor communication between the teams, and the uniform animation style that Linklater wanted was not being implemented.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> After almost two months some animators were still learning the software, and Linklater became frustrated with the lack of progress.<ref name=\"lafranco\" />\n\nAnimation and training for the 30 new artists had begun October 28, 2004. In late November, Mark Gill, head of [[Warner Independent Pictures]], asked for a status report. There were no finished sequences, as the majority of animators were still learning to implement the film's highly detailed style.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> Under pressure, some animators worked 18-hour days for two weeks in order to produce a trailer, which seemed to appease Gill and Linklater.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> Sabiston and his team were falling behind on the studio's 6-month animation schedule and asked that the schedule be extended to a year and that the 2 million dollar animation budget be enlarged accordingly.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> This created tension, and in January 2005, while Sabiston and his four-person core team were strategizing at a local cafe, Pallotta changed the locks and seized their workstations, replacing them with two local artists, [[Jason Archer and Paul Beck]]. Sabiston's four team leaders Patrick Thornton, Randy Cole, Katy O'Connor, and Jennifer Drummond subsequently received the credit \"additional animation\" in the film, despite having worked six months designing the general look of the animation and the scramble suit, hiring and training animators, and 3D compositing.<ref name=\"lafranco\" />\n\nThe studio increased the budget from $6.7 to $8.7 million and gave Linklater six months to finish the film.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> Pallotta took charge and instituted a more traditional [[Disney]]-esque production ethic that included a style manual, strict deadlines, and breaking the film up into smaller segments.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> The animation process lasted 15 months. Linklater said, in regard to the post-production problems, \"There's a lot of misinformation out there... Changes took place during the early stages of us really getting going on this had everything to do with management and not art. It was a budgetary concern, essentially.\"<ref name=\"savlov\" />\n\nA test screening in December 2005 went reasonably well.<ref name=\"lafranco\" /> A revised release date was set for March 31, 2006, but Gill felt that there would not be enough time to mount a proper promotional campaign and the date was changed to July 7, putting the film up against [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe score (more than an hour's worth is in the film) was provided by [[Austin, Texas]]-based composer [[Graham Reynolds (composer)|Graham Reynolds]]. Linklater approached Reynolds in 2003 after a club performance and suggested Reynolds create the score for ''A Scanner Darkly''.<ref name=\"hernandez\">{{Cite news |last=Hernandez |first=Raoul |date=July 7, 2006 |title=Graham Reynold's ''Scanner'' Score |work=[[Austin Chronicle]]}}</ref>\nLinklater and Reynolds had worked previously on ''Live from Shiva's Dance Floor'', a 20-minute short featuring [[Timothy \"Speed\" Levitch]].<ref name=\"hernandez\" />\n\nThe composition and recording process took over one and a half years (the unusual time allotment was due to the film's time-consuming animation process) and was done in Reynolds' east Austin home, in his bedroom.<ref name=\"hernandez\" /> It is not a synthesized score; all the instruments except electric guitar and bass were acoustic, though many were transformed through effects.<ref name=\"hernandez\" /> The film also includes clips of four [[Radiohead]] songs\u2014\"[[Knives Out (song)|Fog]]\", \"[[COM LAG (2plus2isfive)|Skttrbrain (Four Tet Mix)]]\", \"[[Pyramid Song|The Amazing Sounds of Orgy]]\", \"[[Amnesiac (album)|Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors]]\" (although it appears uncredited)\u2014and one [[Thom Yorke]] solo song, \"[[The Eraser|Black Swan]]\". An early test screening featured an all-Radiohead soundtrack.<ref name=\"hernandez\" />\n\nThe album is available from [[Lakeshore Records]] and includes the score by [[Graham Reynolds (composer)|Graham Reynolds]] featuring the [[Golden Arm Trio]]. Additionally, the CD includes exclusive [[remix]]es of Graham's music by [[DJ Spooky]] and [[Jack Dangers]] ([[Meat Beat Manifesto]]). After finishing the film, Reynolds set to work on remixing the [[surround sound]] music into stereo. He then selected 44 minutes out of the film score in order to craft a listening CD while attempting to retain some feel of the arc of the film. Some of the shorter cues were assembled into longer CD tracks.\n\nThe soundtrack to ''A Scanner Darkly'' was released on June 27, 2006.\n\n== Reception {{anchor|Reaction}} ==\n\n=== Box office ===\n''A Scanner Darkly'' opened in 17 theaters and grossed $391,672 for a per-theater average of $23,039. The film saw some expansion in later weeks, but ultimately was about $1 million short of earning back its $8.7 million production budget.
