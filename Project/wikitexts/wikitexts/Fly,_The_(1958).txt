Produced and directed by [[Kurt Neumann (director)|Kurt Neumann]] and starring [[David Hedison]], [[Patricia Owens (actress)|Patricia Owens]], [[Vincent Price]], and [[Herbert Marshall]]. The screenplay by [[James Clavell]] was based on the 1957 [[The Fly (George Langelaan)|short story of the same name]] by [[George Langelaan]].\n\nThe film tells the story of a scientist who is transformed into a grotesque creature after a common house fly enters unseen into a molecular transporter with which he is experimenting, resulting in his atoms being combined with those of the insect, which produces a human\u2013fly hybrid. The film was released in [[CinemaScope]] with [[DeLuxe Color|color by Deluxe]] by [[20th Century Fox]]. It was followed by two black-and-white sequels, ''[[Return of the Fly]]'' (1959) and ''[[Curse of the Fly]]'' (1965). The original film was [[The Fly (1986 film)|remade in 1986]] by director [[David Cronenberg]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Montreal]], Quebec, scientist Andr\u00e9 Delambre is found dead with his head and arm crushed in a [[hydraulic press]]. Although his wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne confesses to the crime, she refuses to provide a motive, and begins acting strangely. In particular, she is obsessed with [[housefly|flies]], including a supposedly white-headed fly. Andr\u00e9's brother, Fran\u00e7ois, lies and says he caught the white-headed fly. Thinking he knows the truth, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne explains the circumstances surrounding Andr\u00e9's death.\n\nIn [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]], Andr\u00e9, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, and their son Philippe are a happy family. Andr\u00e9 has been working on a matter-transporter device called the disintegrator-integrator. He initially tests it only on small, inanimate objects, such as a newspaper, but he then proceeds to living creatures, including the family's pet [[housecat|cat]] (which fails to reintegrate, but can be heard meowing somewhere) and a [[guinea pig]]. After he is satisfied that these tests are succeeding, he builds a man-sized pair of chambers.\n\nOne day, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, worried because Andr\u00e9 has not come up from the basement lab for a couple of days, goes down to find Andr\u00e9 with a black cloth draped over his head and a strange deformity on his left hand. Communicating only with typed notes and knocking, Andr\u00e9 tells H\u00e9l\u00e8ne that he tried to transport himself, but that a fly was caught in the chamber with him, which resulted in the mixing of their atoms. Now, he has the head and left arm of a fly; and the fly has his miniature head and left arm, though he keeps his mind.\n\nAndr\u00e9 needs H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to capture the fly so he can reverse the process. After she, her son, and their housemaid exhaustively search for it, she finds it, but it slips out a crack in the window. Andr\u00e9's will begins to fade as the fly's instincts take over his brain. Time is running out, and while Andr\u00e9 can still think like a human, he smashes the equipment, burns his notes and leads H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to the factory. When they arrive, he sets the hydraulic press, puts his head and arm under, and motions for H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to push the button. Andr\u00e9's arm falls free as the press descends, and trying not to look, she raises the press, replaces the arm, and activates the machine a second time.\n\nUpon hearing this confession, the chief detective on the case, Inspector Charas, deems H\u00e9l\u00e8ne insane and guilty of murder. As they are about to haul her away, Philippe tells Fran\u00e7ois he has seen the fly trapped in a web in the back garden. Fran\u00e7ois convinces the inspector to come and see for himself. The two men see the fly, with both Andr\u00e9's head and arm, trapped in the web as Phillippe told them. It screams \"Help me! Help me!\" as a large [[brown spider]] advances on it. Just as the spider is about to devour the creature, Charas crushes them both with a rock. Knowing that nobody would believe the truth, Fran\u00e7ois and he decide to declare Andr\u00e9's death a suicide so that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is not convicted of murder.\n\nIn the end, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Fran\u00e7ois, and Philippe resume their daily lives. Sometime later, Philippe and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne are playing [[croquet]] in the yard. Fran\u00e7ois arrives to take his nephew to the zoo. In reply to his nephew's query about his father's death, Fran\u00e7ois tells Philippe, \"He was searching for the truth. He almost found a great truth, but for one instant, he was careless. The search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous\". The film closes with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne escorting her son and Fran\u00e7ois out of the yard.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col div}}\n* [[David Hedison]] (credited as Al Hedison) as Andr\u00e9 Delambre\n* [[Patricia Owens (actress)|Patricia Owens]] as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Delambre\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Fran\u00e7ois Delambre\n* [[Herbert Marshall]] as Inspector Charas\n* [[Kathleen Freeman]] as Emma\n* [[Betty Lou Gerson]] as Nurse Anderson\n* [[Charles Herbert]] as Philippe Delambre\n* [[Eugene Borden]] as Dr. \u00c9joute\n* [[Torben Meyer]] as Gaston\n{{col div end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nProducer-director Kurt Neumann discovered the short story by George Langelaan in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"dexter\">{{cite book| url= https://fiftieswesterns.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/highway-to-hollywood1.pdf| title=Highway to Hollywood| first= Maury| last= Dexter| date=2012|page=99}}</ref> He showed it to [[Robert L.
