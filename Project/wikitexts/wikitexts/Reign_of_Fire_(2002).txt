The film also features [[Izabella Scorupco]] and [[Gerard Butler]].\n\nThe film is set in [[England]] in the year 2020,<!--WARNING! It takes place in 2020, as seen in the film was confirmed. Do not remove or change--> twenty years after London tunneling project workers inadvertently awakened [[dragon]]s from centuries of slumber and the creatures have subsequently replaced humans as the dominant species on Earth. With the fate of mankind at stake, two surviving parties, led by Quinn Abercromby (Bale) and Denton Van Zan (McConaughey), find that they must work together to hunt down and destroy the beasts in a desperate attempt to take back the world.\n\nThe film was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]] on 12 July 2002. Upon release, it received generally mixed reviews from critics and audiences and was a box office disappointment, grossing far less than expected, only $82&nbsp;million on a $60&nbsp;million budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web | url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=reignoffire.htm | title = Reign of Fire (2002) | publisher= IMDB | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSoon after the start of the 21st century, during construction on the [[London Underground]], workers penetrate a cave and a huge [[European dragon|dragon]] emerges from [[hibernation]], incinerating the workers with its breath. The only survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen ([[Alice Krige]])\u2014the project engineer\u2014is crushed to death protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons appear. Years later, Quinn ([[Christian Bale]]), now an adult, records the events that transpired after the first dragon sighting. Scientists discovered that dragons were the species responsible for the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s and most plant life on the planet when they razed it with fire; the ash from this event caused the first [[Ice age]] before the dragons disappeared, presumably in a cycle of hibernation. Once re-emerged, the population surged to several million, prompting most militaries to use increasingly devastating weapons, finally leading to targeting the largest population areas with [[nuclear weapon]]s in 2010; however, this only hastened the destruction, and by 2020, humans are [[Endangered species|nearly extinct]]. The dragons, now starving as well, are dying off and increasingly aggressive in search of food.\n\nQuinn, along with his best friend Creedy ([[Gerard Butler]]) leads a community of survivors at [[Bamburgh Castle]], [[Northumberland]] where he plans to outlast dragons until they go back into hibernation; as insurance, he shares his notes and plans with Jared (Scott Moutter) an orphan he rescued as a child and is grooming to lead the community. The community is short on supplies and in a state of unrest pending the harvest of their meager crops. Eddie ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]) and his group steal a truck to pilfer the crops early, but they are attacked by a dragon. One man is killed and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn, Creedy, and Jared rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon kills Eddie's son before escaping and burns the majority of the crops, leaving the community without a means to feed itself.\n\nShortly afterwards, a group of heavily armed [[Americans]] arrive in an armored convoy with a [[Chieftain tank]] and an [[AgustaWestland AW109]] utility helicopter. The leader, Denton Van Zan ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), explains that they are the Kentucky [[Irregular military|Irregulars]]. They flew to [[Manchester]] from the USA in a rebuilt [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]] on two engines, and are some of the last remaining military dragon hunters seeking safe haven on their way to London. Initially skeptical and worried that they are marauders, Van Zan convinces Quinn by sharing the dragons' main weakness: poor vision during twilight. With Quinn's help, Van Zan and his team hunt and slay the dragon who destroyed the crops.\n\nThe survivors enjoy a celebration at the castle that night but Van Zan is embittered by the loss of three of his men. Van Zan introduces Quinn to Alex Jensen ([[Izabella Scorupco]]), his team's helicopter pilot and intelligence officer and together they brief Quinn on their mission. After killing nearly 200 dragons, Alex discovered that they were all female; she postulates that they reproduce quickly because the species relies on a single male to fertilize the eggs. Having tracked the spread of the dragons, they believe that the male is located in London and that if they kill it, they will effectively stop dragons from reproducing. Although Quinn suspects that the male dragon is the same one that had killed his mother, he refuses to help knowing that London is a dragon stronghold and that if they fail, the dragon will track them back to their shelter.\n\nVan Zan  first recruits, then [[Conscription|\"drafts\"]] the castle's best defenders, including Jared, despite Quinn's objections and a physical altercation. Van Zan and some of the castle's men then depart, but true to Quinn's warnings, their caravan is attacked by the dragon in the ruins of a town {{convert|66|mi}} from London. Everyone but Van Zan and Jensen are killed. The dragon then finds the castle and kills many of the inhabitants. Quinn gets the survivors to a [[bunker]], but they are trapped when the dragon returns; during its final attack, Creedy is killed.\n\nVan Zan and Jensen return and free everyone trapped in the bunker. Quinn leaves Jared in charge and decides to help Van Zan and Alex hunt down the male dragon as their best chance at survival. They fly to London and find hundreds of small dragons, one of which is cannibalized by the larger male. This scatters the smaller dragons and leaves the male undefended. Without the support needed for a major battle, Van Zan coordinates a simplified plan: split up, bait the male into attacking, ground him with explosives, and then have another member shoot explosives into his mouth once he is ground level. The plan initially works, but the dragon detonates the initial explosives early and Van Zan is devoured. Quinn and Alex gather the last explosives and together, they lure the dragon to ground level, where Quinn fires an explosive down the dragon's throat, killing it.\n\nLater, Quinn and Alex erect a [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]] on a hill overlooking the [[North Sea]]. There has been no dragon sighting for over three months. Jared arrives to say they have contacted a group of [[French people|French]] survivors who want to speak to their leader. Quinn officially makes Jared the community leader and dedicates himself to rebuilding civilization with Alex.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Quinn Abercromby\n** Ben Thornton as Young Quinn\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Denton Van Zan\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as Alex Jensen\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Creedy\n* [[Scott Moutter]] as Jared Wilke\n* [[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]] as Eddie Stax\n* [[Alexander Siddig]] as Ajay\n* [[Ned Dennehy]] as Barlow\n* [[Rory Keenan]] as Devon\n* Terence Maynard as Gideon\n* [[Doug Cockle]] as Goosh\n* Randall Carlton as Burke\n* Chris Kelly as Mead\n* [[Alice Krige]] as Karen Abercromby\n* [[Jack Gleeson]] as \"Kid\" (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\nKevin Peterka and Gregg Chabot wrote the original [[screenplay]] in 1996, after which they sold it to [[Spyglass Media Group]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wehner |first1=Christopher |title=Reign of Fire |url=http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/article/d17f4b37 |website=Screenwriter's Utopia |publisher=Screenwriter's Utopia |access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref> In 2000 [[Matt Greenberg]] revised the screenplay for production.<ref name=\"Reign of Fire screenplay PDF\">{{cite web |title=Reign of Fire Screenplay PDF |url=https://www.scriptslug.com/assets/scripts/reign-of-fire-2002.pdf |website=Script Slug |publisher=Script Slug |access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Reign of Fire'' was filmed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Wicklow Mountains]], at the Glendasan Valley Lead Mines. Permission was given on the condition that the area was not damaged and the crew removed all sets once filming was complete. However, an [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak#Spread to the rest of Europe|outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe]] stopped many planned scenes from being filmed due to quarantine restrictions.\n\nThe dead dragon was designed and built by [[Artem]], with visual effects by [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Secret Lab|Secret Lab]]. The dragon's digital effects posed a problem for animators: <blockquote>\"In recent years there have been several movies starring creatures with scaled surfaces. Among these are ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Dragonheart]]'', and ''[[Lake Placid (film)|Lake Placid]]''. The surfaces of these creatures have generally been constructed by layering painted textures atop displacement maps. This gives the model texture, but the scales stretch and shrink under the movement of the creature, giving a rubbery look that is not realistic.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Petti|first1=Ernest J|last2=Thompson|first2=Thomas V, II|last3=Lusinsky|first3=Adolph|last4=Driskill|first4=Hank|title=Dragon Scales: The Evolution of Scale Tool for ''Reign of Fire''|journal=ACM SIGGRAPH 2002 Conference Abstracts and Applications|date=2002|pages=172|doi=10.1145/1242073.1242185|publisher=ACM|s2cid=2034980}}</ref></blockquote> In order to overcome this limitation, the then-groundbreaking work done by digital effects animator Neil Eskuri on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] 2000 release ''[[Dinosaur (2000 film)|Dinosaur]]'' was utilized as a benchmark in order to create a realistic physical simulation of the dragon. According to Carlos Gonzalez-Ochoa, the film called for \"{{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} creatures with wing spans of {{convert|300|ft}} that could undergo enormous speeds and accelerations.
