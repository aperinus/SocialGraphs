The plot centers on a wealthy but uneducated father (Dangerfield) who goes to college to show solidarity with his discouraged son Jason (Gordon) and learns that he cannot buy an education or happiness.\n\nAuthor [[Kurt Vonnegut]] has a cameo as himself, as does the band [[Oingo Boingo]], whose frontman [[Danny Elfman]] composed the score for the film. The [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] was used as a backdrop for the movie, although it was called \"Grand Lakes University.\" The diving scenes were filmed at the since-demolished [[Industry Hills Aquatic Club]] in the [[Industry, California|City of Industry]], California.\n\nBefore the end credits, the message \"For ESTELLE Thanks For So Much\" is shown in dedication to Estelle Endler, one of the executive producers of the film, who died during production. She was Dangerfield's long-time manager, who helped him get into films such as ''[[Caddyshack]]''.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NbaAF5Zwax0C | title = It's Not Easy Bein' Me: A Lifetime of No Respect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs | last = Dangerfield | first = Rodney | author-link = Rodney Dangerfield | publisher = [[HarperCollins]] | date = 2004 | isbn = 9780060779245 | quote = I was right about Estelle\u2014she was the best manager anyone could ever have.

His ambition is to go into his father's line of work, but his stern father warns Thornton \"If a man has no education, he's got nothing\".\n\nAs decades pass, Thornton changes his last name to the more Americanized \"Melon\" and becomes a self-made corporate giant, with a successful chain of [[plus-size clothing]] stores and numerous other business ventures. He becomes a widower, and remarries to a gold-digging socialite named Vanessa. Feeling dejected when his college student son Jason cancels a visit, he returns home to a party hosted by Vanessa. Finally weary of Vanessa's nasty attitude and adultery, Thornton divorces her, and asks his bodyguard and chauffeur Lou to drive him up to the college to visit Jason.\n\nOn the campus, Thornton learns from Jason that he is C-student, unhappy with college life and intends to drop out. He is a towel boy for the diving team instead of a member, was rejected by the fraternities, is antagonized by diver and jock Chas Osborne, and has no friends except for his roommate Derek Lutz. Thornton motivates him to stay in college by deciding to enroll alongside him. Despite Thornton's lack of academic qualifications, the dean David Martin admits him when he bribes Martin with a donation for a new campus building.\n\nThornton's bribery earns him the wrath of Dr. Philip Barbay, dean of the business school. His displeasure is further exacerbated by Thornton's canny practical experience clashing with Barbay's hypothetical theorizing in class, and [[ivory tower]] ways. Thornton also develops a romantic interest in Barbay's girlfriend, the literature professor Dr. Diane Turner. Meanwhile, Jason begins to attract the interest of Valerie Desmond, a girl that Chas has been trying to impress. Thornton instantly becomes a popular man on campus, throwing huge parties and exhibiting generosity to the fellow students. Jason earns a spot on the diving team, after Thornton, a former diver himself, convinces the diving coach to reconsider his abilities. Despite all this, Jason still feels he is living in his father's shadow.\n\nAs a student, even though Diane is inspiring a deeper appreciation of literature, Thornton prefers partying to studying. He hires a team of professionals to complete his assignments, including author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] to write a paper on Vonnegut for literature class. To Thornton's surprise, Diane gives the paper a failing grade for obviously not being his own work, and she becomes disillusioned by his frivolous behavior. Jason is also upset with Thornton for trivializing education, while mistakenly believing Thornton bribed the diving coach into accepting him on the team.\n\nDr. Barbay accuses Thornton, in the presence of Dean Martin, of academic fraud. He challenges Thornton to an oral examination conducted by all of his professors, facing expulsion if he fails any part of it. Believing he has no chance of passing, Thornton packs up and prepares to leave. Jason stops Thornton and successfully encourages him to stay and prepare for the challenge.\n\nWith limited time to prepare, Thornton crams for the examination with help from Jason, Derek, Lou, and Diane. When the big day comes, Barbay begins by intimidating Thornton with a single, 27-part question. Nevertheless, Thornton answers every part, though the effort was so much that he wants to forfeit. Diane inspires him to finish, and he does.\n\nAt the championship dive meet later that day, Thornton and Jason reconcile, while Jason's team takes the lead. To spite Jason for his performance and for winning over Valerie, Chas fakes a cramp in an attempt to make his team lose. The coach decides to recruit Thornton as a last-minute replacement. Thornton helps the team win by performing the legendary \"Triple Lindy\" dive. Afterwards, Thornton learns from Diane that he has passed the examination with all D's, except for a single A from her. At the end of the school year, Thornton gives the commencement speech, advising the new graduates to move back in with their parents.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rodney Dangerfield]] as Thornton Melon\n* [[Sally Kellerman]] as Dr. Diane Turner\n* [[Burt Young]] as Lou\n* [[Keith Gordon]] as Jason Melon\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Derek Lutz\n* [[Paxton Whitehead]] as Dr. Phillip Barbay\n* [[Sam Kinison]] as Professor Terguson\n* [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]] as Valerie Desmond\n* [[M.
