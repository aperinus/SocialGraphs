Two students manage to escape, but upon alerting the authorities they learn that \"Pleasant Valley\" is nothing but a [[cemetery]] - a memorial for 2001 [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] villagers who were massacred 140 years earlier by renegade Union troops during the Civil War. A plaque reveals that the town's residents will not rest until the crime has been paid back: 2001 villagers were killed, 2001 Northerners must be killed - an eye for an eye.\n\nAs the two students drive away on their [[motorcycle]], they are [[decapitation|decapitated]] by [[barbed wire]]. The heads are picked up by Hucklebilly who walks down the road and fades away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Robert Englund]] as Mayor George W.
