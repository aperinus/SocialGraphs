[[still image film|Constructed almost entirely from still photos]], it tells the story of a [[post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-nuclear war]] experiment in time travel. It is 28 minutes long and shot in black and white.\n\nIt won the [[Prix Jean Vigo]] for short film. The 1995 science fiction film ''[[12 Monkeys]]'' was inspired by and borrows several concepts directly from ''La Jet\u00e9e''.\n\n==Plot ==\nA man (Davos Hanich) is a prisoner in the aftermath of [[World War III]] in post-apocalyptic Paris, where survivors live underground in the ''[[Palais de Chaillot]]'' galleries. Scientists research [[time travel]], hoping to send test subjects to different time periods \"to call past and future to the rescue of the present.\" They have difficulty finding subjects who can mentally withstand the shock of time travel. The scientists eventually settle upon the protagonist; his key to the past is a vague but obsessive memory from his pre-war childhood of a woman ([[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Ch\u00e2telain]]) he had seen on the observation platform (\"the [[jetty]]\") at [[Orly Airport]] shortly before witnessing a startling incident there. He did not understand exactly what happened, but knew he had seen a man die.\n\nAfter several attempts, he reaches the pre-war period. He meets the woman from his memory, and they develop a romantic relationship. After his successful passages to the past, the experimenters attempt to send him into the far future. In a brief meeting with the technologically advanced people of the future, he is given a power unit sufficient to regenerate his own destroyed society.\n\nUpon his return, with his mission accomplished, he discerns that he is to be executed by his jailers. He is contacted by the people of the future, who offer to help him escape to their time permanently; but he asks instead to be returned to the pre-war time of his childhood, hoping to find the woman again. He is returned to the past, placed on the jetty at the airport, and it occurs to him that the child version of himself is probably also there at the same time. He is more concerned with locating the woman, and quickly spots her. However, as he rushes to her, he notices an agent of his jailers who has followed him and realizes the agent is about to kill him. In his final moments, he comes to understand that the incident he witnessed as a child, which has haunted him ever since, was his own death.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean N\u00e9groni]] as Narrator\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Ch\u00e2telain]] as The Woman\n* Davos Hanich as The Man\n* [[Jacques Ledoux]] as The Experimenter\n* [[Ligia Borowczyk|Ligia Branice]] as Woman From The Future\n* Janine Kleina as Woman From The Future\n* [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] as Man From The Future\n\n==Production==\n''La Jet\u00e9e'' is constructed almost entirely from [[optical printer|optically printed]] photographs playing out as a [[photomontage]] of varying rhythm. It contains only one brief shot (of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up) originating on a motion-picture camera, this due to the fact that Marker could only afford to hire one for an afternoon. The stills were taken with a [[Pentax Spotmatic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cadrage.net/entretiens/bonfanti.htm |title=Entretien avec Antoine Bonfanti, Cadrage 2004 |publisher=Cadrage.net |access-date=2015-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090704191233/http://www.cadrage.net/entretiens/bonfanti.htm |archive-date=4 July 2009 }}</ref> and the motion-picture segment was shot with a [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] [[Arriflex]].<ref>{{cite web|title=De l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du miroir|url=http://www.net4image.com/pedagogie/cineastes/marker.htm|access-date=8 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701132256/http://www.net4image.com/pedagogie/cineastes/marker.htm|archive-date=1 July 2007 |language=fr}}</ref> The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German and people talking in an airport terminal. The story is told by a [[voice-over]] narrator.<!-- The soundtrack is stock music by [[Trevor Duncan]]. The music of the opening of the film is from a Russian piece titled \"We bow down before your cross\" (or \"\u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443 \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0443\" in Russian), composed by [[Piotr Gontcharov]]. [This needs citation before being put back] --> The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1958 film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' which Marker also references in his 1983 film ''[[Sans soleil]]''.<ref>\"On ''Vertigo''\", special feature on the [[Criterion Collection]] DVD of ''La Jet\u00e9e'' and ''Sans soleil''. The same scene also appears in Terry Gilliam's [[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]].</ref>\n\nThe editing of ''La Jet\u00e9e'' adds to the intensity of the film. With the use of cut-ins and [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade-outs]], it produces the eerie and unsettling nature adding to the theme of the apocalyptic destruction of World War III. [[Terry Gilliam]], director of ''[[12 Monkeys]]'', describes the editing as \"simply poetic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=55&v=XfVDUOYECSU&feature=emb_title|title=Terry Gilliam on La Jet\u00e9e|date=28 November 2012|via=YouTube|access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref> in the combination of editing and soundtrack that is used in the short film.\n\nAs the film plays out as a photomontage, the only continuous variable is the sound. The sound used in this production is minimal, showing up in the form of narration, [[Orchestral score]] and [[sound effect]]. The rhythmic patterns of the soundtrack act as a framework to add to the intensity of the film. \"The dissolve is synchronized with the sound. As the story moves from the past to the present, ''La Jetee'' creates mental continuity.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://filmslie.com/chris-marker-la-jetee-analysis-temporality/|title=Chris Marker's La Jetee Analysis: Mortality and the Illusion of Time|last=Ignoramous|first=Lamos|website=Films Lie|date=11 April 2014 |access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref> The soundtrack adds to the [[illusion]] of movement within the film and the change of time.\n\n==Interpretation==\nIn ''Black and Blue'', her study of postwar French fiction, [[Carol Mavor]] describes ''La Jet\u00e9e'' as \"taking place in a no-place (u-topia) in no-time ([[Uchronia|u-chronia]])\" which she connects to the time and place of the [[fairy tale]]. She further elaborates: \"even the sound of the title resonates with the fairy-tale surprise of finding oneself in another world: ''La Jet\u00e9e'' evokes 'l\u00e0 j'\u00e9tais' (there I was)\". By \"u-topia\", Mavor does not refer to \"[[utopia]]\" as the word is commonly used; she also describes an ambiguity of [[dystopia]]/utopia in the film: \"It is dystopia with the hope of utopia, or is it utopia cut by the threat of dystopia.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Mavor | first=Carol | author-link=Carol Mavor|title=Black and Blue: The Bruising Passion of Camera Lucida, La Jet\u00e9e, Sans soleil, and Hiroshima mon amour | date=2012 | page=60 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OiFkvwzEoGsC&q=%22It+is+dystopia+with+the+hope+of+utopia%22&pg=PA60 | isbn=978-0-8223-5271-6 | access-date=11 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Tor Books]] blogger Jake Hinkson summed up his interpretation in the title of an essay about the film, \"There's No Escape Out of Time\". He elaborated:\n\n{{blockquote|text=What [the protagonist] finds ... is that the past is never as simple as we wish it to be. To return to it is to realize that we never understood it. He also finds\u2014and here it is impossible to miss Marker's message for his viewers\u2014a person cannot escape from their own time, anyway. Try as we might to lose ourselves, we will always be dragged back into the world, into the here and now. Ultimately, there is no escape from the present.}}\n\nHinkson also addresses the [[symbolism (arts)|symbolic]] use of imagery: \"The Man is blindfolded with some kind of padded device and he sees images. The Man is chosen for this assignment because ... he has maintained a sharp mind because of his attachment to certain images. Thus a film told through the use of still photos becomes about looking at images.\" He further observes that Marker himself did not refer to ''La Jet\u00e9e'' as a film, but as [[photo novel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2014/11/03/theres-no-escape-out-of-time-la-jetee/|title=There's No Escape Out of Time: ''La Jet\u00e9e''|last=Hinkson|first=Jake|date=3 November 2014|website=Tor.com|publisher=Tor Books/Macmillan|access-date=14 June 2015}}<!--As an official blog from a major sci-fi publisher this is not a WP:SPS.--></ref>\n\nYannis Karpouzis makes a [[structuralistic]] analysis on ''La Jet\u00e9e'', examining it as an intermedial artwork: Chris Marker creates an \"archive\" of objects and conditions that have a photographic quality of their own and they are followed by the same predicates as pictures.
