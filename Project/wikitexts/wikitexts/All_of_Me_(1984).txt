This film is based on the unpublished novel ''Me Two'' by Edwin Davis.<ref>''[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=111434&mainArticleId=220857 All of Me]'' at TCM.com</ref>  The title song and theme of the movie is the 1931 jazz standard \"[[All of Me (jazz standard)|All of Me]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nDissatisfied 38-year-old attorney Roger Cobb (Martin) is dating his boss' daughter and is also an aspiring jazz guitarist. A difficult, eccentric millionairess named Edwina Cutwater (Tomlin) has been bedridden since childhood. Edwina, who has employed Roger's law firm to manage her estate, asks him to make some unusual final arrangements to her will.\n\nHaving discovered she is dying, Edwina has enlisted the aid of a culture-shocked mystic named Prahka Lasa ([[Richard Libertini]]), who has mastered the secret of transferring human souls. She has made an arrangement with Terry Hoskins ([[Victoria Tennant]]), a beautiful young woman. Edwina wants her own soul [[Body swap|placed in Terry's vacated body]] so that she can finally experience youth and health. Terry, who expresses discontent with the material world, will have her soul released to the universe. Roger is to change Edwina's will so that Terry, as Edwina's future self, is her sole beneficiary. Unsurprisingly, Roger believes the whole plan is \"bananas\".\n\nEdwina dies at the law office. The soul-transfer works, but the bowl temporarily holding her soul falls out the window and hits Roger. Roger ends up with Edwina's soul sharing his body. She has control over the right side of his body and he the left. She causes him to lose both his girlfriend and his job. Besides being able to hear her thoughts, Roger talks to Edwina's image that appears in mirrors and other reflective surfaces. Their relationship gradually warms up, but both of them want Edwina out of his body. Meanwhile, Terry is shocked to learn that the soul transference really works, as she admits she only agreed to it to get Edwina's fortune. Terry tries to prevent Roger from finding the guru by sending him to the airport with a plane ticket, but when the holy man shows up again unexpectedly, she refuses to cooperate.\n\nRoger pledges to help Edwina transfer to Terry's body as originally planned with the guru's help. They, along with Tyrone Wattell ([[Jason Bernard]]), Roger's blind friend and fellow musician, pose as band members and sneak into a party Terry is throwing at her mansion, newly inherited from the deceased Edwina.\n\nGuru Prahka successfully transfers Edwina's spirit back into the bowl, but when Roger attempts to force Terry to touch the bowl, it is flung into a bucket of water, transferring Edwina into the liquid. Prahka explains that he must repair the dented bowl before her soul can be transferred again. Terry summons security to apprehend Roger and the bucket. Roger flees and pours the water into a pitcher, which he gives to Tyrone for safekeeping.\n\nRoger allows himself to be caught with the bucket, which he has filled with ordinary water. Terry, however, appears with the pitcher, which she empties into a flower bed. Believing Edwina to be lost forever, Roger despondently wanders around the mansion as the party continues into the night.\n\nWhen he reunites with Tyrone, Roger discovers that his friend, mistaking the water for gin, had drunk from the pitcher before Terry took it, thereby transferring Edwina into his own body. Guru Prahka, having repaired the bowl, sends Edwina back into Roger.\n\nRoger, Prahka and Tyrone sneak into Terry's bedroom to attempt another transference, but she meets them at the door with a loaded gun. She intends to kill Roger and pass him off as an intruder, but Roger manages to gain the upper hand. In the course of the struggle another guest's life is threatened and he threatens to call the police. It is revealed that the discontent with the world Terry referred to included a storied criminal record, and rather than go to jail for life as a \"[[Three-strikes law|three-strikes]] loser,\" Terry consents to having her soul placed into the body of her favorite horse and to let Edwina take up residence in her body as originally planned. The final shot shows Roger and Edwina (who now resides in Terry's body) dancing together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Roger Cobb \n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Edwina Cutwater \n* [[Madolyn Smith]] as Peggy Schuyler \n* [[Victoria Tennant]] as Terry Hoskins \n* [[Richard Libertini]] as Prahka Lasa \n* [[Dana Elcar]] as Burton Schuyler, Roger's boss\n* [[Jason Bernard]] as Tyrone Wattell , Roger's blind musician friend\n* [[Selma Diamond]] as Margo , Roger's secretary\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Fred Hoskins, Terry's father\n* [[Gailard Sartain]] as Fulton Norris \n* [[Neva Patterson]] as Gretchen \n* [[Michael Ensign]] as Mr. Mifflin \n* [[Peggy Feury]] as Dr. Betty Ahrens\n\nIn an interview, Martin described his sense of his character Roger Cobb: \"This man is not an idiot. He is a contemporary person with some brains, [...] he's not naive or a victim of circumstances. He's an intelligent man who happens to get caught in a disaster. That's a big difference between this role and any other part I've played. [...] For the first time I'm in a story with a beginning, middle, and end. It's old-fashioned and solid [...] This movie was like going to school. I learned a lot about structure and character.\"<ref>Sterritt, David (2005) ''Guiltless pleasures: a David Sterritt film reader''.
