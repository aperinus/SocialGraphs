The film stars [[Al Pacino]], [[John Cazale]], [[James Broderick]], and [[Charles Durning]]. The screenplay is written by [[Frank Pierson]] and is based on the ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine article \"The Boys in the Bank\" by [[P. F. Kluge]] and Thomas Moore. The feature chronicled the 1972 robbery and [[hostage situation]] led by [[John Wojtowicz]] and [[Salvatore Naturile]] at a [[Chase Manhattan Bank|Chase Manhattan]] branch in [[Brooklyn]].\n\nElfand brought Bregman's attention to the article, who proceeded to negotiate a deal with [[Warner Bros]] and clear the rights to use the story. Pierson conducted his research and wrote a script that centered the story of the robbery around Wojtowicz. The cast was selected by Lumet and Pacino, with the latter selecting past co-stars from his [[Off-Broadway]] plays. Filming took place between September and November 1974, and the production was finished three weeks ahead of schedule.\n\nUpon theatrical release on September 21, 1975, ''Dog Day Afternoon'' was a critical and box office success. The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]] and seven [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. In 2009, ''Dog Day Afternoon'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]], and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn August 22, 1972, first-time crook [[John Wojtowicz|Sonny Wortzik]], his friend [[Salvatore Naturile|Salvatore \"Sal\" Naturile]], and Stevie attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank. The plan immediately goes awry when Stevie loses his nerve and flees. Sonny discovers they arrived after the daily cash pickup, and find only $1,100 in cash.\n\nSonny takes the bank's [[traveler's check]]s and burns the register in a trash can, but the smoke raises suspicion outside, and the building is surrounded by police. The two panicked robbers take the bank employees hostage.\n\nPolice Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti calls the bank and Sonny bluffs that he is prepared to kill the hostages. Sal assures Sonny that he is ready to kill if necessary. A security guard has an [[asthma]] attack and Sonny releases him as a display of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside. Using the head teller as a shield, Sonny begins a dialogue with Moretti that culminates in his shouting \"Attica!  Attica!\" to invoke the recent [[Attica Prison riot]]. The crowd begins cheering for Sonny.\n\nSonny demands a vehicle to drive himself and Sal to the airport so they can board a jet. He also demands pizzas to be brought for the hostages, and for his wife to be brought to the bank. Sonny's partner, Leon Shermer, arrives and reveals that the robbery was intended to pay for Leon's [[sex reassignment surgery]], and divulges that Sonny has children with his estranged wife, Angie.\n\nAs night sets in, the bank's lights are shut off as [[FBI]] Agent Sheldon takes command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when the bank manager Mulvaney goes into diabetic shock, Sheldon lets a doctor inside. Sheldon then convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone. Leon had been hospitalized at [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] after a suicide attempt. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal in their escape, and Sonny tells the police that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery.\n\nSonny agrees to let Mulvaney leave, but the manager refuses to leave his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank to talk to his mother, who fails to persuade him to give himself up. Back inside, Sonny writes out his will, leaving money from his life insurance for Angie, and for Leon to have the surgery.\n\nWhen the requested limousine arrives, Sonny checks for hidden weapons or booby traps, and selects Agent Murphy to drive him, Sal, and the remaining hostages to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy Airport]]. Sonny sits in the front beside Murphy with Sal behind. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal will not accidentally shoot him.\n\nAs they wait on the airport tarmac for the plane to taxi into position, Sal releases another hostage, who gives him her rosary beads for his first plane trip. Murphy again reminds Sal to aim his gun away. Sal does, and Sheldon seizes Sonny's weapon, allowing Murphy to pull a revolver hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested, and the hostages are freed.\n\nThe film ends as Sonny watches Sal's body being taken from the car on a stretcher. On-screen text reveals that Sonny was sentenced to twenty years in prison, that Leon was a woman living in New York City, and that Angie and her children subsisted on welfare.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Sonny Wortzik ([[John Wojtowicz]])\n* [[John Cazale]] as Sal Naturile ([[Salvatore Naturile]])\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Sergeant Eugene Moretti\n* [[Chris Sarandon]] as Leon Shermer ([[Elizabeth Eden]], then Ernest Aron)\n* [[Penelope Allen]] as Sylvia 'Mouth' (Shirley \"Mouth\" Ball)\n* [[Sully Boyar]] as Mulvaney (Robert Barrett)\n* [[Susan Peretz]] as Angie (Carmen Wojtowicz)\n* [[James Broderick]] as FBI Agent Sheldon\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as FBI Agent Murphy\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Jenny 'The Squirrel'\n* Beulah Garrick as Margaret\n* Sandra Kazan as Deborah\n* Estelle Omens as Edna\n* [[Marcia Jean Kurtz]] as Miriam\n* Amy Levitt as Maria\n* Gary Springer as Stevie\n* [[John Marriott (actor)|John Marriott]] as Calvin Jones\n* [[Philip Charles MacKenzie]] as the doctor\n* [[Dick Anthony Williams]] as the Limo Driver / Undercover FBI Agent \n* [[Judith Malina]] as Sonny's Mother\n* [[Dominic Chianese]] as Sonny's father\n* [[Edwin Malave|Edwin \"Chu Chu\" Malave]] as Maria's boyfriend\n* Lionel Pina as the Pizza Boy\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\nOn August 22, 1972, [[John Wojtowicz]], [[Salvatore Naturile]], and Robert Westenberg attempted to rob a branch of the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] at 450 Avenue P in [[Gravesend, Brooklyn]].{{sfn|Associated Press staff|1972|p=1}}{{sfn|UPI staff|p=1|1972}} The robbers aimed to take the US$150,000\u2013$200,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.2|1972|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) that they expected to be delivered at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. that afternoon by an armored truck. According to Wojtowicz, a Chase Manhattan executive that he met at a gay bar in [[Greenwich Village]] tipped him off.{{sfn|Meskil, Paul|1972|p=2C}} They entered the bank at 3:00&nbsp;p.m. to discover that the armored truck had instead taken money away at 11:00&nbsp;a.m. The robbers took the $29,000 ({{Inflation|US|29,000|1972|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) that was available at the branch and tried to escape. Westenberg was successful, but Wojtowicz and Naturile were left behind as the police arrived on the scene. The robbery then turned into a [[hostage situation]].{{sfn|Bell, Arthur|1972|p=30}}\n\n[[File:LFChaseP1975.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Photograph of the Chase branch involved in the robbery | The Chase branch<!--, pictured--> in 1975]]\n\nTwo hours into the negotiations Wojtowicz and Naturile extended a list of demands to the police: release Elizabeth Eden (Ernest Aron) from [[Kings County Hospital Center]] in exchange for a hostage, bring hamburgers and Coca-Cola, and provide transportation to John F.

The feature, written by [[P. F. Kluge]] and Thomas Moore, was titled \"The Boys in the Bank\". It detailed the holdup and the hostages' eventual [[Stockholm syndrome|fraternization with their captors]].{{sfn|Kluge, P.F|Moore, Thomas|1972|p=66}} The authors compared Wojtowicz's appearance to that of [[Dustin Hoffman]] or [[Al Pacino]].{{sfn|Erickson, Hal|p=36|2017}} The feature caught the attention of producer [[Martin Elfand]].{{sfn|Parker, Jerry|1974|p=7}}  Elfand took it to [[Martin Bregman]], who piqued the interest of [[Warner Brothers]]' executive [[Richard Shepherd (producer)|Richard Shepherd]].{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=114}} Elfand hired Kluge and Moore to interview the people involved in the story. Before the script was written, Elfand wanted to ensure he had signed releases by all the interviewees for the story rights. After the negotiation, each hostage received $600 ({{Inflation|US|600|1973|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}); one hostage asked for more money and was not included in the script. Initially, Westenberg was offered $2,000, but he turned it down following the advice of his lawyer, as he was still serving a two-year sentence. After his release, he settled for $750.{{sfn|Parker, Jerry|1974|p=7}} Wojtowicz received $7,500 ({{Inflation|US|7,500|1973|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=$}}) for the rights to the story. From the money, he earmarked $2,500 to Eden's reassignment surgery.{{sfn|UPI staff|1973|p=3}} News outlets reported Wojtowicz was granted one percent of the film's net profit;{{sfn|Jones, J.R.|2014}} Bregman later denied that his company, Artists Entertainment Complex, granted Wojtowicz a percentage of the gross. Bregman added he would give him $25,000 if the film performed as well as ''[[Serpico]]'' (1973) at the box office.{{sfn|Jahr, Cliff|1975|p=125}} Wojtowicz's lawyer, Mark Landsman, retained $3,500 of the payment he received.{{sfn|Jahr, Cliff|1975|p=125}} Meanwhile, Warner Bros paid for Naturile's funeral.{{sfn|Washington Post-LA Times News Services|1974|p=72}} The working title of the film was ''The Boys in the Bank''.{{sfn|Alyson Publications staff|1990|p=32}} The budget was set at an estimate of $3.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.5|1973|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}),{{sfn|Parker, Jerry|1974|p=7}} or $3.8 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.8|1973|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{sfn|Gottlieb, Martin|1977|p=28}}\n\n[[Frank Pierson]] was hired to write the screenplay. Aside from Kluge and Moore's research, Pierson conducted his own. He contacted journalist [[Randy Wicker]], who covered the story of the heist for gay publications, and provided technical assistance regarding Manhattan's gay nightclub scene.{{sfn|Washington Post-LA Times News Services| 1974|p=72}} Pierson decided he wanted to center the story around Wojtowicz, who refused to receive Pierson in prison while he was in a financial dispute with Warner Bros. Pierson analyzed the tapes of the interviews and news articles about the robbery and approached those involved for additional information. Pierson could not define Wojtowicz's character because a different impression was left on each of the interviewees. The project overwhelmed him, but he could not quit, as he had spent his cash advance. Pierson reviewed his material and found the unfulfilled promises Wojtowicz made as the common trait. Pierson viewed them as \"the story of the bank\" and the failure of the robbery. Pierson finished the screenplay by Christmas 1973.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 3|2006}} Author [[Leslie Waller]] later worked on a [[novelization]] of the Pierson script, to be published after the release of the film by [[Dell Publishing]].{{sfn|Copyright Office|1976|p=1784}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nWith the finished script, Bregman met with director [[Sidney Lumet]] and Pacino in London.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 3|2006}} Pacino, who was at the time represented by Bregman, agreed to play the role. He then backed out, and Dustin Hoffman expressed interest. Bregman did not meet with Hoffman; he felt Pacino could bring the \"sensitivity\" and \"vulnerability\" needed for the role.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=114}} After more discussion, Pacino accepted the part but then rejected it again. Bregman attributed it to Pacino's use of [[method acting]] and said it \"might have been a world [Pacino] did not want to explore\". Bregman added that \"no major star had ever played a gay\".{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} He wanted to make the film with Pacino. The actor backed out of the project a third time and told Bregman he wanted to return to the theater. He said he would \"never make the adjustment necessary for the movies\".{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} Pacino again returned to the project and attributed his behavior to stress and drinking, and that he needed \"a life outside work\".{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} Lumet mentioned the characterization of Sonny Wortzik's (Wojtowicz) \"insane framework of life\" as the stress factor for Pacino.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} In a meeting before the rehearsals, Pacino asked Pierson and Lumet to tone down Sonny Wortzik's behavior; his request was rejected.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=115}} Eden described Wojtowicz as \"a very domineering person\",{{sfn|Washington Post-LA Times News Services|1974|p=72}} and added: \"he is good-natured&nbsp;... but sometimes went overboard&nbsp;... and he terrified me\".{{sfn|Bell, Arthur|1972|p=32}} Wicker later said that the screenplay of ''Dog Day Afternoon'' portrayed Wojtowicz to be \"more rational than he really was\".{{sfn|Getlen, Larry|2014}}\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | I thought basically that the most important thing to capture was the human conflict, the human cry, the human need.

[[Charles Durning]]{{sfn|Murphy, Mary|1975|p=11 (Part IV)}} and [[James Broderick]]{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 2|2006}} were cast as Moretti and Sheldon respectively, though Lumet initially decided on Durning being the bank manager and Broderick playing Moretti until Pacino intervened. Because Durning was also working on [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[Two People (1973 film)|Two People]]'', Lumet and Wise had to coordinate his schedule, as he flew between California and New York.{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}} Lumet did not worry about Broderick's recasting because of his reputation for [[method acting]].{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 2|2006}} [[Sully Boyar]] was cast as bank manager Mulvaney (based on Robert Barrett).{{sfn|Erickson, Hal|2017|p=36}} [[Chris Sarandon]] convinced Lumet and Pacino during his reading and was cast as Leon Shermer. Lumet asked him to shift the focus of his characterization to \"a little less [[Blanche DuBois]], a little more Queens housewife\".{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 2|2006}}\n\nThere were three weeks of rehearsals,{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=117}} and the name of the project was changed to ''Dog Day Afternoon''. Pierson flew from Los Angeles to New York at Lumet's request. Pacino refused to kiss Sarandon in a scene as he thought it was \"exploitative\"; he felt that the script kept \"pushing the gay issue\" on the audience.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 3|2006}} He expressed the view that viewers already knew the characters were homosexual and wanted to convey the failure of the relationship instead. Pierson agreed; he realized the couple did not actually kiss and that they had actually carried on a phone conversation. Pierson modified the scene to include the call.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 3|2006}} The [[National LGBTQ Task Force|National Gay Task Force]] approved of the script. Ronald Gold, then director of the organization, welcomed it as \"sensitive and tasteful\".{{sfn|Parker, Jerry|1974|p=7}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n==== Opening scene ====\nFilming took place between September and November 1974.{{sfn|AFI staff|2020}} The opening montage shows New York's traffic, bridges, beaches, and neighborhoods before moving to a view of the Manhattan skyline from a cemetery.{{sfn|Schoell, William|2016|p=45}} Lumet wanted to convey \"a hot boring day, a [[Dog days|dog day]] afternoon\".{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}} The director shot the footage from a station wagon, and ended in front of the bank, showing the robbers.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}} The footage was silent, as Lumet decided that he did not want a score for the film. The director felt that \"he could not reconcile trying to convince an audience that this really happened ... with putting a music score into it\".{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}} Editor [[Dede Allen]] played [[Elton John]]'s composition \"[[Amoreena]]\" in the editing room. Lumet added the song to the film, which comes out of the getaway car's radio.{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}}\n\n==== The bank ====\nMost of the film took place inside of the bank. Lumet discarded the idea of building a studio set; instead, the director found a street with a warehouse on the lower floor of a building that used to be an automotive workshop. The crew built a bank set with movable walls, which allowed Lumet to place the cameras as he desired, and to use [[Long-focus lens|long lenses]] to shoot from a distance. The warehouse's location also allowed Lumet to transition freely between the bank and the street, and he avoided changing film locations,{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2010|p=100}} and allowed the street to be visible from the inside of the bank.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent  4|2006}} The scenes were shot on Prospect Park West, between 17th and 18th streets.{{sfn|Harris, Scott Jordan|2011|p=56}} The bus line that ran through the street was re-routed for filming, and the second story of the building housed the production offices and catering.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent  4|2006}}\n\n[[File:Al Pacino Penelope Allen in Dog Day Afternoon.jpg|thumb|Pacino and Allen, re-entering the bank on a scene|left|250px]]\nTo capture Pacino's movements in a natural fashion, and to allow the actor greater mobility, Lumet integrated the use of roller skates and wheelchairs for the cameramen in the panoramic shots. Lumet would order the camera operators to be pulled as Pacino acted to make the scene look \"naturalistic\", and \"like it was shot by television cameramen, fighting their way through the crowd\".{{sfn|Rapf, Joanna|2006|p=125}} He wanted the production to have the appearance of a newsreel.{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}} The film featured [[close-up]]s centered on Sonny and the situation in the bank.{{sfn|Cagle, Chris; Davis, Nick|2010|p=73}}\n\nTwo different cameras were used to cover the negotiations from Durning and Pacino's side.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent  4|2006}} Lumet and cinematographer [[Victor J. Kemper]] relied on [[Wide shot|long shots]] to depict the point of view of the police, and the robbers' \"entrapment\".{{sfn|Cagle, Chris; Davis, Nick|2010|p=73}} Lumet wanted to use the light available on the set to avoid additional luminescence. He fitted the bank with extra [[fluorescent lamp]]s to achieve desired exposure, and he used other fluorescent lamps of lower power as [[fill light]] in close-ups. The film required seven nights of filming. Lumet needed the neighbors' cooperation for the use of their [[fire escape]]s to hold additional lights. The production was challenged by the weather, as temperatures dropped.{{sfn|Geisinger, Elliot; Saland, Ronald|1975}} On the day of the heist in August 1972, the temperature reached {{Convert|87|F|C|abbr=}} when the robbers entered the bank.{{sfn|National Weather Service|1972}} The film was shot during the fall; to avoid having their breath be visible, the cast placed ice in their mouths to even out the temperature.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent  4|2006}} Lighting was provided for the scenes by [[emergency vehicle lighting|emergency vehicles]], that were specially fitted with four 7,500 watt lamps. The white brick [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the building provided light reflection. An existing lamp post was utilized, and its lighting reinforced to keep the crowd visible. [[Emergency light]]s were used on set in scenes where the power was shut off by the police.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent  4|2006}}\n\nPacino shot the first scene wearing sunglasses, but he asked the director to re-shoot it after watching the [[dailies]], as he felt that Sonny \"wanted to get caught\".{{sfn|Edelstein, David|2018}} He also shaved off a moustache he grew for the role after the replay.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent  4|2006}} Lumet allowed the cast to [[Ad libitum|ad-lib]] lines with the condition that they did not deviate greatly from the script by Pierson.{{sfn|Erickson, Hal|2017|p=36}} The production team had recorded improvisations during the rehearsals that were added to the script.{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}} Lumet wanted the dialog to \"feel natural\",{{sfn|Malone, Aubrey|2019|p=96}} and he encouraged the actors to wear their own clothes and to not use makeup.{{sfn|Malone, Aubrey|2019|p=96}}\n\nA crowd of three to four hundred extras was hired. Meanwhile, Lumet asked the neighbors to appear in the film by watching from their windows. The director offered to relocate to a hotel for those who did not want to be disturbed by the shooting. The crowd grew as filming progressed, and pedestrians joined the actors.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent  4|2006}} Lumet directed the crowd and \"whipp[ed] them up to a frenzy\". By the second week, he felt that the crowd could improvise on its own. To amplify the effect in the film, he utilized hand-held cameras.{{sfn|Malone, Aubrey|2019|p=93}} In regards to the project while it was filming, Lumet said \"It's out of my hands. It's got a life of its own\".{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=117}} In a scene on the street, before Pacino left the bank, assistant director Burtt Harris whispered to him to ask the crowd about Attica. Pacino then improvised the complete dialog with the crowd.{{sfn|Edelstein, David|2018}}\n\n==== Phone conversations ====\nLumet decided to shoot the phone conversations Sonny had with his wife and Leon back-to-back. As Pacino acted the scene, he increased the intensity of the portrayal. While both conversations lasted a total of fourteen minutes, Lumet's camera could only shoot ten at a time, and he had to bring a second camera.{{sfn|Malone, Aubrey|2019|p=94}} For the scene, Lumet separated Pacino from the rest of the bank with a black velvet mask to isolate him. He left a hole for both cameras, and for himself to look in.{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}} Lumet wanted a second take. An exhausted Pacino accepted, and he kept the same intensity. At the end of the scene, Lumet and Pacino cried. The director later remembered it as \"an amazing moment, as good a moment of directing as I've ever had in my life\".{{sfn|Malone, Aubrey|2019|p=94}}\n\nThe call between Pacino and Sarandon was improvised.{{sfn|Yule, Andrew|1992|p=117}} Lumet felt that Sarandon \"had great taste\", and that the actor would not resort to \"homosexual clich\u00e9s\".{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}} He deemed the humor of his improvisation as \"genuinely funny\", and that it was not \"laughing at a gay character\".{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}} Sarandon felt that the conversation was welcomed by the audiences because it \"wasn't about a drag queen and his boyfriend\", and that it reflected two people that were \"trying to come to grips with what is wrong in their relationship.\"{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}} The film was characterized by its \"light comic touch\",{{sfn|Blake, Richard Aloysius|2005|p=68}} and according to critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], for its \"ear and instinct for comedy\".{{sfn|Thomson, David|2008|p=484}} In Pierson's script, Wortzik's question regarding which country Sal wanted to escape to did not have a scripted response, but Cazale improvised by answering \"Wyoming\".{{sfn|Schulman, Michael|2016|p=136}} Lumet had to cover his mouth, as he nearly interrupted the scene by laughing.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 2|2006}}\n\n==== Final scene ====\nThe start of the final scene at the bank was shot on a {{Convert|40|F|C|abbr=}} night with wind. Pacino was sprinkled with water to simulate sweat;{{sfn|Washington Post-LA Times News Services|1974|p=72}} Lumet mixed the artificial sweat himself, as he felt that the makeup crews often used it in excess, or that it was insufficient. The director used a mixture of glycerin and water that he learned to make during the shooting of ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]''. The mixture lasted longer and allowed him better continuity throughout the scenes.{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}}\n\nHarris directed the scene of the caravan that headed to Kennedy Airport from a helicopter. A plane and squad cars on the tarmac were used.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}} Senator [[Jacob Javits]], an acquaintance of Lumet, facilitated the negotiations with the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]]. The production team was given one day to shoot in an area of the airport that was not a terminal.{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}} The international flights that headed to the main runway had to go around the shooting location. Lumet directed the scene at the airport from the ground. He chose to cut from the close-up after Sal was shot and a gun was held to Sonny's head, to a long shot; the view presented a panorama of the scene at the airport. Lumet centered on Pacino and ordered the crew to roll Cazale on a stretcher to be visible by the actor. Pacino used the image to improvise his reaction.{{sfn|Bouzereau, Laurent 4|2006}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | [The wedding footage] was so extreme visually, that I thought, if we ever see that, we are not gonna be able to take the rest of the movie seriously.

Wojtowicz's mother and eight male bridesmaids were present. Lumet planned to use it in the film; the scene would have featured the footage broadcast on a television in the bank, but he decided not to include it, as he felt it would be \"unrecoverable\" and that the audiences would not \"take the rest of the movie seriously\".{{sfn|Lumet, Sidney|2005}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Dog Day Afternoon'' opened on September 20, 1975, at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]].{{sfn|Blanco y Negro staff|1976}} The film premiered in New York City on September 21, 1975, and released nationwide in October.{{sfn|Film Review Digest staff|1975}} It grossed between $50 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|50|1975|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) million and $56 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|56|1975|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).{{sfn|Box Office Mojo staff|2020}}{{sfn|Gottlieb, Martin|1977|p=28}}\n\n''Dog Day Afternoon'' holds a \"Certified Fresh\" 96% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on fifty-one reviews.

It called the film a \"gaudy street-carnival\", and Lumet's \"most accurate, most flamboyant\" depiction of New York. The reviewer remarked the \"brilliant characterizations\" of the cast: Pacino's display of a \"bravura style\", Sarandon's performance of \"fear, dignity and silliness\" and the acting \"that one remembers\" from the supporting cast.{{sfn|Canby, Vincent|1975|p=41}} ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave ''Dog Day Afternoon'' four stars: it described the film as a \"gut-level human comedy\" and called Pacino \"stunning\", \"brilliantly erratic and terribly touching\". The publication felt that Pacino portrayed \"a rich, volatile character\". It favored Durning and Sarandon, and called the female cast \"marvelous\".{{sfn|Carroll, Kathleen|1975|p=42}} ''[[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]]'' welcomed the performances as \"very natural\".

Sarris also noted that \"pain [came] pouring out of Pacino's eyes\" as he deemed Sonny a \"Freudian tragic hero\", and that the combination with Cazale's character's \"deadpan death wish\" produced \"much emotional debris\". The piece declared the \"high point\" of the film to be the phone conversation between Pacino and Sarandon. Sarris pointed that the dialogue featured \"two wounded creatures capable of an extraordinary emotional audacity\", and concluded that the film was to be \"seen, but not swallowed whole\" and \"making heroes out of felons\" was \"a short step to utter chaos\".{{sfn|Sarris, Andrew|1975|p=111}} Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] rated it with three-and-a-half stars out of four, welcoming its \"irreverent, quirky sense of humor\".{{sfn|Ebert, Roger|1975}} Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it \"a triumphant new classic of American movie naturalism\".{{sfn|Arnold, Gary|1975|p=A14}} [[Penelope Gilliatt]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote, \"Though the farcical tone of the movie is blusterous, falling into the common show-biz habit of supplying energy in place of intent, the movie succeeds, on the whole, because it has the crucial farcical value of not faltering.\"{{sfn|Gilliatt, Penelope|1975|p=95}}\n\n[[Gene Siskel]] gave ''Dog Day Afternoon'' four stars on his review for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and rated the film as \"superb\", noting the \"scenes mixing the fear of violence with insane laughter\". He felt that Pacino, Cazale, and Durning kept the film from \"degenerating into silliness\". Siskel talked about Pacino's display of \"so much energy\" that made him \"believe the unbelievable\" and Cazale's \"haunting, sallow-cheeked silence\". Lumet and Allen were praised for the \"terrific, roller-coaster\" pace of the film.{{sfn|Siskel, Gene|1975|p=1 (S3)}} [[United Press International]] defined it as an \"exceptionally fine film\u2014outrageously funny and deeply moving\", and welcomed Pacino's acting as a \"dazzing display\". The supporting roles by Cazale, Durning, Allen and Broderick were deemed \"excellent\", while Peretz and Sarandon's performances were singled out.{{sfn|Dugas, David|1975|p=13}} For [[Joe Baltake]], Pacino's appearance was a \"raw, high voltage, uproariously funny performance\". His review on the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' continued by calling the film \"super-charged\", and \"multi-leveled\" by \"a slapstick comedy, tense drama, caper tale, biographical material and character study\". Baltake compared Cazale's appearance on the film to that of a ''[[Coonskin (film)|Coonskin]]'' character by [[Ralph Bakshi]]. In regards to the rest of the cast, he determined \"everyone [was] good\".
