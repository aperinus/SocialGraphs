The screenplay by [[Jeremy Leven]] is based on [[Steven Pressfield]]'s 1995 book ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance (novel)|The Legend of Bagger Vance: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life]]''. The film is set in 1931 [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It was the final film starring [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Lane Smith]]. The film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing almost $40 million worldwide{{snd}}only half of its budget{{snd}}and received mixed reviews; it was criticized by several [[African American]] commentators and reviewers for employing the \"[[Magical Negro]]\" stereotype.<ref name=\"Farley\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nAs an old man having his sixth heart attack while playing golf, Hardy Greaves ([[Jack Lemmon]]) contemplates how his late wife used to ask him why he kept playing \"a game that seems destined to kill\" him. Explaining his love for the game, he begins the story of his childhood idol: Rannulph Junuh ([[Matt Damon]]).\n\nJunuh is the favorite son of [[Savannah, Georgia]]: a noteworthy golfer from a wealthy family; he and his beautiful girlfriend Adele Invergordon ([[Charlize Theron]]) seem to have it all. While serving as a captain in the U.S. Army during [[World War I]], Junuh is traumatized when his entire company is wiped out in battle. Though he earns the [[Medal of Honor]], he disappears after the war, returning to Georgia years later as a broken-down [[alcoholic]].\n\nAt the start of the [[Great Depression]] (circa 1930),<ref>Jones actually retired from golf in 1930, but a theater playing [[The Public Enemy|''The Public Enemy'' (1931)]] is seen.</ref> Adele is trying to recover her family's lost fortune by holding a four-round, two-day [[exhibition match]] between  [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] ([[Joel Gretsch]]) and [[Walter Hagen]] ([[Bruce McGill]]), the best golfers of the era, with a grand prize of $10,000, at the golf resort her family opened as the Depression struck. However, needing a local participant to gain local interest, a young Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief) speaks up for his hero, Junuh, prompting Adele to ask her estranged lover to play.\n\nJunuh is approached by a mysterious traveler carrying a suitcase, who appears while he is trying to hit golf balls into the dark void of the night. The man identifies himself as Bagger Vance ([[Will Smith]]) and says he will be his [[caddie]]. With Greaves as assistant caddie, Bagger helps Junuh come to grips with his personal demons and play golf again.\n\nWhen the match starts, Jones and Hagen each play well in their distinctive ways, but the disengaged Junuh plays poorly and is far behind after the first round. With Bagger caddying for him and giving advice, Junuh rediscovers his \"authentic swing\" in the second round and makes up some ground. In the third round, he closes the gap even more, hitting a hole in one in the process. Meanwhile, Junuh and Adele rekindle their romance.\n\nLate in the final round, an overconfident Junuh disregards Bagger's advice at a crucial point and, after that, plays poorly. He hits a ball into a forest, which triggers a war flashback, but Bagger's words help him focus on the game. Junuh pulls back to a tie with Jones and Hagen, then has a chance to win on the final hole, but has the integrity to call a penalty on himself when his ball moves after trying to remove a loose impediment.\n\nSeeing Junuh has grown and matured, Bagger decides that his golfer does not need him any more. With the 18th hole left unfinished, Bagger gives the position of caddie to Greaves and leaves as mysteriously as he came.\n\nThough losing a chance to win because of the penalty, Junuh sinks an improbable putt and the match ends in a gentlemanly three-way tie. The three golfers shake hands with all of Savannah cheering. Junuh and Adele get back together.\n\nThe old Greaves wakes up and sees Bagger Vance, not aged a day, on the golf course. As Bagger beckons, Greaves follows.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Will Smith]] as Bagger Vance\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Rannulph Junuh\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Adele Invergordon\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as [[Walter Hagen]]\n* [[Joel Gretsch]] as [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]]\n* J.

Junuh) refuses to fight. The god [[Krishna]] appears as [[Bhagavan]] (Bagger Vance) to help him follow his path as the warrior and hero that he was meant to be. This relationship was explained by [[Steven J. Rosen]] in his 2000 book ''Gita on the Green: The Mystical Tradition Behind Bagger Vance'', for which Pressfield wrote the foreword.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONDYJTXf8loC|title=Gita on the Green: The Mystical Tradition Behind Bagger Vance|first=Steven|last=Rosen|date=30 May 2002|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|via=Google Books|isbn=9780826413659}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nPortions of the exhibition match were set at the [[Kiawah Island Golf Resort]] in [[South Carolina]], United States, considered one of the toughest in the country. The scene in which Greaves has a heart attack was shot on No. 11 of the resort's Cougar Point golf course. The final hole in the film was temporary, so the filming did not interfere with the club activities, and cost US$200,000 to build. Most of the golf scenes were filmed at Colleton River Plantation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colletonriverclub.com/|title=Colleton River Club&nbsp;Homepage|website=www.colletonriverclub.com}}</ref> just off [[Hilton Head Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-11-12/travel/0011090370_1_bagger-vance-pressfield-19th-hole |title= The Bagger Vance Hole: Watch For That Alligator Hazard |publisher= Orlando Sentinel }}</ref> Certain segments were filmed in Savannah and [[Jekyll Island]], Georgia.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146984/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt IMDb ''The Legend of Bagger Vance''] [[IMDb]]</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Anchor|Critics}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 43% based on reviews from 130 critics, with an average rating of 5.23/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Despite the talent involved in ''The Legend of Bagger Vance'', performances are hindered by an inadequate screenplay full of flat characters and bad dialogue.

Redford and his writer, Jeremy Leven, starting from a novel by Steven Pressfield, are very clear in their minds about what they want to do.
