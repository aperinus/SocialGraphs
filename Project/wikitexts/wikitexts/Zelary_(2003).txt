The film received a [[Submissions for the 76th Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|2004 Academy Award nomination]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category. It was produced by [[Barrandov Studios]] in [[Prague]].\n\nThe film is adapted from two works by [[Czechs|Czech]] novelist [[Kv\u011bta Leg\u00e1tov\u00e1]] - \"\u017delary\", a collection of short stories published in 2001, and her 2002 book, \"Jozova Hanule\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1940s [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], Eli\u0161ka is a nurse who works alongside her lover, Richard, a respected surgeon.  They are part of an underground [[Resistance in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|resistance]] network that has formed to help those in danger of persecution from the Nazis.  Eli\u0161ka acts as a messenger.\n\nOne night, Richard responds to an emergency call to a patient needing a risky operation.  Because she has the same blood type, Eli\u0161ka gives blood for the transfusion.  Days later, she arrives at Richard's apartment to find their friend, Sl\u00e1vek, with news that the Gestapo has apprehended two of their members, putting everyone at risk of discovery.   Eli\u0161ka is told that Richard has emigrated, leaving papers for her to assume a new identity.  Sl\u00e1vek says that she must leave the city with a man named Joza - the patient who had received the transfusion.  Seeing no alternative, Eli\u0161ka - now Hana - leaves for the countryside.\n\nAs a mountain-dweller, Joza appears uncouth and disheveled, but he is kind and considerate to her plight.  He provides her with temporary refuge in a small village, where she quickly becomes the object of curiosity.  Some, such as Teacher Tk\u00e1\u010d the schoolmaster, are xenophobic and suspicious. The Nazis have killed anyone harbouring enemies. Eli\u0161ka tries to leave, but the village doctor reveals that the Nazis have executed Sl\u00e1vek.  He tells her that to remain safe, she must marry Joza and live with him in the mountain village of \u017delary.\n\nInitially, Eli\u0161ka is reluctant. Joza takes her to their new home, a small cottage with no electricity, dirt floor, and a fly-infested outhouse.  On the day of their wedding, Eli\u0161ka rebels, but relents upon Joza's explanation that the villagers will not accept a strange, single woman.  So Eli\u0161ka agrees, and the two are married.  At the wedding, she meets most of \u017delary's inhabitants.  Helenka is a young girl who lives near Joza and Eli\u0161ka with her mother, \u017de\u0148a.  Her best friend is Lipka, a boy whom the villagers treat as an outcast, but who is actually homeless due to his step-father Michal's dislike of him.  He survives through the goodwill of \u017de\u0148a, Lucka the village midwife, and Old Goreik, an elderly gentleman who lives with his daughter-in-law, Marie, a victim of spousal abuse.\n\nEli\u0161ka seems ill-suited to rural life.  She finds the villagers' behavior raucous and crude, and is particularly repulsed by Michal, the drunk, who makes unwanted advances.  As time passes, Joza's patience and \u017de\u0148a's gentle guidance help her to assimilate.  Despite this, Eli\u0161ka remains wary of her husband, until one evening when she breaks their only lamp and fears a beating.  On the contrary, Joza is comforting and gives her a gift: a stack of books that she may like.  One day, he takes her to his mother's grave and Eli\u0161ka is moved by the love and kindness he feels.  Joza falls in love with Eli\u0161ka and she with him, leading to the consummation of their marriage.\n\nYears pass and Eli\u0161ka - called Hanula by the villagers and Hanulka by Joza - bears witness to a number of incidents.  The Nazis, though scarce in \u017delary, kill an entire family for harbouring partisans, and then murder an innocent man in front of everyone.  Eli\u0161ka fears that the [[Gestapo]] will find her.  Michal attempts to rape her at the saw mill.  Helenka witnesses the attack and alerts Joza, who beats Michal and breaks his arm. His parents, the Kutinas, then force Michal's pregnant wife and Lipka's mother, Aninka, to do all the farm work, which leads to her miscarrying. Lipka alerts Eli\u0161ka, Lucka, and \u017de\u0148a, but it is too late. Aninka's death destroys Michal's reputation and redeems Lipka in the eyes of the villagers.\n\nBy the spring of 1945, Eli\u0161ka is a nurse again, and learns the art of herbal healing from Lucka. The old woman divulges that Marie and her father-in-law, Old Goreik, are expecting a child. Following the birth, soldiers from the Red Army arrive with news that the war is over. After a night of celebration, Joza reminds Eli\u0161ka that she is free to leave (their marriage being technically invalid). Eli\u0161ka replies that she wants to stay with him always, and falls asleep on the mountain in Joza's arms.\n\nYoung Goreik, furious over his father's relationship with his wife, arrives at Old Goreik's home with a drunken soldier who he persuades to rape Marie.  Old Goreik arrives and shoots his son, as well as the would-be rapist, but the latter's brother arrives and shoots him. Intoxicated, the soldiers interpret the killing as the act of fascists and shoot at the villagers.  With help from Lipka, many escape by crossing a swamp towards an old saw mill, where Lucka and Eli\u0161ka tend to the wounded. Joza races back and forth between the haven and the village, and rescues several people - including Michal. Meanwhile, the soldiers kill the village priest and rape \u017de\u0148a.  Vojta, a farmhand, comes to her aid and Joza goes back to rescue him. The next morning, they arrive at the saw mill and find soldiers heading in the same direction.  The villagers are relieved, but Joza collapses (Vojta having shot him earlier after mistaking him for the enemy). Devastated, Eli\u0161ka kneels beside Joza's lifeless body and weeps.\n\nYears later, \u017delary is virtually abandoned due to modernisation of the town below.  Eli\u0161ka, now with Richard, returns to visit the mountains and the cottage that she had shared with Joza. Lucka emerges from the ruins and is shocked to see Hanula, but remembers that \"nothing disappears off the mountain, there\u2019s always tracks\".  Astounded, Eli\u0161ka asks if it is possible that Lucka is still alive, to which Lucka responds, \"I'm none too sure.  I'm none too sure at all.\" On the top of the mountain, the women laugh.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Anna Geislerov\u00e1]] as Eli\u0161ka / Hanulka: a young nurse who leaves city-life behind when the [[Gestapo]] catch wind of the resistance.
