However, she leaves them in suspense as to which one. All three marriages are shown in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to be strained.\n\nDeborah grew up on a farm. Her first experience with the outside world came when she joined the Navy [[WAVES]] during [[World War II]], where she met her future husband, upper-class Brad. When they return to civilian life, Deborah is ill at ease in Brad's social circle. Adding to her insecurity, she learns that everyone expected Brad to marry Addie, whom all three husbands consider practically a goddess.\n\nHowever, she is comforted by Brad's friend Rita, a career woman who writes stories for sappy radio [[soap opera]]s. Her husband George, a schoolteacher, feels somewhat emasculated since she earns much more money, but refuses to leave his teaching job, which he thinks is important despite the low pay. He is also disappointed that his wife constantly gives in to the demands of her boss, Mrs. Manleigh. Rita's flashback recalls a dinner party she gave for Mrs. Manleigh. She forgot that her husband's birthday was that night, and only remembered when a birthday present, a rare [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] recording, arrived from Addie Ross.\n\nLora Mae grew up poor, not just on the \"wrong side of the tracks,\" but literally next to the railroad tracks where passing trains shake the family home periodically. She sets her sights on her older, divorced employer, Porter, the wealthy owner of a statewide chain of department stores. Her mother, Ruby Finney, is unsure what to think of her daughter's ambition, but Ruby's friend (and the Phippses' servant) Sadie approves. Matters come to a head when Lora Mae sees a picture of Addie on the piano in Porter's home. She tells him she wants her picture on a piano: her own piano in her own home. When Porter refuses to marry her, Lora Mae breaks off their romance. However, he loves her too much, and finally gives in and proposes (albeit unromantically), skipping a New Year's party at Addie's house to do so.\n\nWhen the women return from the picnic, Rita is overjoyed to find her husband at home. They work out their issues and she vows not to let herself be pushed around by Mrs. Manleigh.\n\nPorter is late coming home, causing Lora Mae to think he has gone off with Addie, though Ruby insists that Porter loves her and would never leave. When Porter suddenly arrives and hears about his wife's suspicions, he accuses her of being happy at the thought of having grounds to divorce him and receive a large monetary settlement.\n\nDeborah's houseman gives her a message stating that Brad will not be coming home that night. A heartbroken Deborah goes alone to the local club with the other two couples.\n\nWhen Porter complains about his wife dancing with another man, Deborah tells him he has no idea how much Lora Mae really loves him, but Porter is certain Lora Mae only sees him as a \"cash register.\" Unable to take it anymore, Deborah gets up to leave, announcing that Brad has run off with Addie. Porter stops her, confessing it was he who started to run away with Addie, but then explains that he changed his mind. As Deborah leaves to find Brad and reconcile with him, Porter then tells Lora Mae that, with his admission in front of witnesses, she can divorce him and get what she wants. To his shock, Lora Mae claims she did not hear a word he said. Finally convinced of her love, Porter asks her to dance.\n\nThe voice of Addie Ross bids all a good night. In the film, she is shown only twice and from behind.\n\n==Differences between novel and film==\nKlempner's novel was ''A Letter to Five Wives''. Two wives were lost in the transition to the screen. At one point, the film was called ''A Letter to Four Wives''. When submitting the adapted screenplay to [[20th Century-Fox]] chief [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] mentioned that he found it too long and asked how Zanuck felt about shortening the movie. \"Take out one of the wives\", Zanuck replied. Originally, the movie would have featured [[Anne Baxter]] as Martha. Zanuck did not feel Baxter's segment was as strong as the other three, so it was cut.\n\nAll the major characters differ substantially between the novel and film, and the nature of the problems with their marriages also. In the novel, Lora May (not Lora Mae) is less a gold digger than a woman who has always been dominated by her wealthy husband; Rita is trying to succeed in a second marriage with a man she has never felt passionate about; and Deborah is a plain and quiet former spinster whose \"catch\" of a husband has been disappointed in her lack of success in society. As for the other two wives, Martha and her husband locked horns over child-rearing issues, while Geraldine was devoting excessive time and money to her singing career with few results.\n\nThe novel also gives no indication that any of the couples will work through their problems (the film, ambiguities notwithstanding, has a decidedly happy ending as per the prevailing social mores and film censorship code), and the identity of the errant husband is different although not his rationale.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Image:Jeanne Crain in A Letter to Three Wives trailer.jpg|70px]] || [[Jeanne Crain]]<br> as Deborah Bishop || [[Image:Jeffrey Lynn in A Letter to Three Wives trailer.jpg|70px]] || [[Jeffrey Lynn]] <br>as Bradbury \"Brad\" Bishop\n|-\n| [[Image:Linda Darnell in A Letter to Three Wives trailer.jpg|70px]] || [[Linda Darnell]]<br>as Lora Mae Hollingsway || [[Image:Paul Douglas in A Letter to Three Wives trailer.jpg|70px]] || [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]]<br> as Porter Hollingsway\n|-\n| [[Image:Ann Sothern in A Letter to Three Wives trailer.jpg|70px]] || [[Ann Sothern]] <br>as Rita Phipps ||[[Image:Kirk Douglas in A Letter to Three Wives trailer.jpg|70px]] || [[Kirk Douglas]] <br>as George Phipps\n|-\n|}\n* [[Barbara Lawrence]] as Georgiana \"Babe\" Finney, Lora Mae's sister\n* [[Connie Gilchrist]] as Mrs. Ruby Finney\n* [[Florence Bates]] as Mrs. Manleigh\n* [[Hobart Cavanaugh]] as Mr. Manleigh\n* [[Thelma Ritter]] as Sadie Dubin (uncredited)\n* [[Celeste Holm]] as Addie Ross (uncredited voice)\n\n==Production==\nFilm rights to John Klempner's ''A Letter to Five Wives'' were acquired by 20th Century-Fox in February 1946,<ref>{{cite news |title=People Who Read and Write; New House |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0910F7385D107A93C6AB1789D85F428485F9|date=February 24, 1946|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2010-08-23 | first=John K. | last=Hutchens}}</ref> seven months after it was first published in a magazine.<ref name=\"notes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=81295&category=Notes |title=Notes for A Letter to Three Wives (1949) |access-date=2010-08-23|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> [[Melville Baker]] and Dorothy Bennett wrote the first treatments of the script.
