The film debuted at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]] and went into limited theatrical release in the US on May 2, 2007. It is the basis for the [[Tony Awards|Tony]]-nominated musical ''[[Waitress (musical)|Waitress]]''. Shelly's supporting role is her final film appearance before her death.\n\n==Plot==\nJenna Hunterson is a [[waitress]] living in the [[Southern United States|American South]], trapped in an unhappy marriage with her controlling and abusive husband, Earl. She works in Joe's Pie Diner, where her job includes creating inventive pies with unusual titles inspired by her life, such as the \"Bad Baby Pie\" she invents after her unintended pregnancy is confirmed. Jenna longs to run away from her dismal marriage and is slowly accumulating money to do so. She pins her hopes for escape on a pie contest in a nearby town, which offers a $25,000 grand prize, but her husband won't let her go. Upon learning she is pregnant, he demands she promise never to love the baby more than him.\n\nHer only friends are her co-workers, Becky and Dawn, and Joe, the curmudgeonly owner of the diner and several other local businesses, who is a regular customer of Jenna's at the diner and encourages her to begin a new life elsewhere. She also bonds unexpectedly with her gruff bossy manager, Cal the cook, when she fearfully informs him of her pregnancy, only to discover he already knows and always planned to keep her employed. Prompted by her co-workers' gift of a baby journal, Jenna begins to keep a diary, ostensibly as letters to her unborn child, revealing her inner thoughts and plans.\n\nJenna's life changes after she meets her new [[obstetrician]], Jim Pomatter. He has moved to the small town to accommodate his wife, who is completing her [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] at the local hospital, and is filling in for the woman who has been Jenna's doctor since childhood. The two are attracted to each other, and over the course of several prenatal appointments the attraction grows. After Dr. Pomatter invites her into the office under a quickly exposed pretext, she impulsively initiates a passionate affair.\n\nAt Dawn's wedding at the diner, Earl interrupts the celebration and demands Jenna leave at once. Earl drives Jenna home and confronts her, having found Jenna's multiple stashes of cash throughout the house. Reluctantly, Jenna tells Earl that the money was for the baby, which forces her to spend the money to conceal the true purpose of the funds. In despair, she flees to Dr. Pomatter, who provides much-needed comfort; as they fantasize about running away together, Jenna's [[Rupture of membranes|water breaks]].\n\nAt the hospital, Jenna discovers Joe is also a patient undergoing an [[elective procedure]]; he hands her an envelope with instructions not to open it until after the baby is born. Much to her dismay, she is also greeted warmly by Dr. Pomatter's wife, who is rounding with other residents. Jenna then begs Dr. Pomatter to administer as many drugs as possible so she won't feel a thing.\n\nJenna soon gives birth to a baby girl. When she holds and sees her newborn for the first time, Jenna's profound ambivalence melts into a full-blown bond with her daughter, whom she names Lulu. Earl, clearly disappointed that it's a girl, reminds Jenna of her coerced promise not to love the baby more than she does him. She bluntly tells him that she hasn't loved him in years, will no longer put up with his possessiveness and abuse, and will not let Lulu grow up with his mistreating her, and wants a divorce. Enraged, Earl attempts to assault Jenna, but is escorted out of the hospital by security staff.\n\nLater, as Jenna prepares to leave the hospital, due to Earl refusing to pay her medical bills as retaliation for being kicked out, Becky and Dawn inform her Joe collapsed into a coma during his procedure. Jenna then remembers the envelope Joe brought her before the birth. In the envelope she finds a handmade card with a sketch of her, inscribed \"To my only friend, start fresh\", along with a check for $270,450.\n\nWhile leaving the hospital, Dr. Pomatter requests a word with her in private, inquiring about their future. Grateful for his profound kindness, she nonetheless promptly breaks it off, informing him of the enormous trust she sensed from his wife. She then hands him a chocolate [[Moon Pie]] and asks her friends to wheel her out.\n\nIn an epilogue, it is loosely implied that Earl left town or was arrested and never seen or heard from again, Jenna is shown winning the pie contest, as well as turning the diner into a successful chain named \"Lulu's Pies\", and she and Lulu walk home happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Keri Russell]] as Jenna Hunterson\n* [[Nathan Fillion]] as Dr. Jim Pomatter\n* [[Cheryl Hines]] as Becky\n* [[Adrienne Shelly]] as Dawn\n* [[Eddie Jemison]] as Ogie Anhorn\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Earl Hunterson\n* [[Andy Griffith]] as Joe\n* [[Lew Temple]] as Cal\n* [[Darby Stanchfield]] as Francine Pomatter\n* Lauri Johnson as Nurse Norma\n* Sarah Hunley as Dr. Lily Mueller\n* Nora Paradiso as Ethel\n* Holgie Forrester as Dawn's mother\n* Sophie Ostroy as Lulu\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote = \"Seeing ''Waitress'' at Sundance was a really emotional experience.
