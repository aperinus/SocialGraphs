It was directed by [[S. S. Wilson]], and stars [[Fred Ward]], [[Christopher Gartin]], [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]], and [[Helen Shaver]].\n\nAfter spending all the reward money from his first encounter with Graboids, Earl Bassett agrees to hunt more of the deadly creatures at a Mexican oil refinery for $50,000 each. Knowing that he cannot face the monsters alone, Earl recruits Burt Gummer, another veteran of the incident in Nevada, to supply the firepower. There is only one problem: the Graboids have now evolved into creatures able to attack above ground.\n\nReviews for the film were mostly positive, with some critics labeling it one of the best direct-to-video sequels ever made.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/best-direct-to-video-dvd-sequels-actually-great/ |title = Direct-To-Video Sequels That're Actually Great {{!}} ScreenRant}}</ref>\n\nThe film is the second in the [[Tremors (franchise)|''Tremors'' franchise]]. It was followed by a 2001 sequel, ''[[Tremors 3: Back to Perfection]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nYears after the events of [[Tremors (1990 film)|the first film]], Val McKee has moved away and married Rhonda LeBeck, while Earl Basset has squandered his fortune on a failing ostrich ranch. He is approached by Carlos Ortega, who informs him that Graboids are killing his workers at his oil field in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], and hires him to hunt them down. Earl initially declines, but Ortega's taxi driver, Grady Hoover, convinces Earl to change his mind after mentioning that Ortega will pay $50,000 for each Graboid killed; both join the hunt. Upon arrival, Earl learns that the company would pay him double if he caught one of the creatures alive. He also meets [[geologist]] Kate Reilly, her assistant Julio, and a mechanic named Pedro, all of whom are scientifically investigating the Graboids.\n\nEarl and Grady begin systematically killing the Graboids by using remote-controlled cars rigged with explosives. Though their strategy seems to work, the vast number of Graboids overwhelms them and Earl enlists the help of Burt Gummer, who arrives with a [[deuce-and-a-half|\"deuce-and-a-half\" truck]] loaded with firearms and explosives. The next day, Earl and Grady are surprised by one of the Graboids, causing them to drive backwards in a panic and crash the truck into an inclined ditch. Returning to where they saw the Graboid, Earl and Grady find that the creature looks sick and non-aggressive with all of its tentacles mysteriously dead. Realizing they have one of the creatures alive (which Ortega offered $100,000 if accomplished), they call Pedro to come and pick them up along with the Graboid. However, the Graboid later begins making horrific and painful sounds and is soon found dead with a huge hole torn open into its body. They see Pedro's truck approach from the distance but it suddenly stops, prompting Grady and Earl to investigate and discover the truck\u2019s destroyed engine as well as Pedro\u2019s remains. They make their way to a nearby radio broadcasting building which has similarly been destroyed, only to be met by strange [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] graboid-like creatures. Earl successfully kills one as it charges him, but the two flee in a car they had found as more of the creatures arrive. Meanwhile, Burt's truck is ambushed by a pack of these new creatures while returning to base.\n\nThe following morning, the creatures have made their way to the oil refinery, where Julio is violently killed by one. Grady and Earl arrive before it can attack Kate, with Burt shortly arriving thereafter following a near-fatal firefight that has left him drained of ammunition. Through experimentation, the group discovers that these creatures (now dubbed 'Shriekers') are [[hermaphrodite]]s that can replicate at an incredible rate after eating enough food. They also learn that the creatures cannot hear unlike their predecessors, but rather see heat through special [[infrared]] receptors on their heads. However, they are attacked by the Shriekers, who have discovered Burt's [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] food supply and have rapidly doubled their numbers in a matter of minutes. They run for Julio's car, but Burt accidentally disables it while killing a Shrieker.\n\nHiding from the Shriekers, Burt is trapped in a bulldozer bucket while Grady, Kate, and Earl are on top of an oil tower. The Shriekers work together in an attempt to climb the tower before Burt traps them in the storage shed with the truck. However, they discover [[rice flour]] is stored inside as well, enabling the Shriekers to continue eating and multiplying inside. Earl douses himself in [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]] from a fire extinguisher to hide his body heat, and tries to find Burt's explosives amongst the Shriekers, who have multiplied into dozens of creatures. While the plan initially works, the {{CO2}} quickly wears off and the Shriekers detect his body heat, forcing Earl to throw the detonator among Burt's supplies before escaping. The group manages to escape before a massive explosion devastates the entire facility, destroying all of the Shriekers with it. In the aftermath, Earl and Kate decide to pursue each other romantically, while Grady suggests opening a monster-themed theme park due to the money Ortega now owes them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Earl Bassett \n* [[Christopher Gartin]] as Grady Hoover\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Dr. Kate Reilly.

The film was originally planned to be filmed in [[Australia]] on a 17 million-dollar budget with the proposal that [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Reba McEntire]] would both be returning. Unfortunately, McEntire declined due to a major tour she had currently been on, and Bacon, while intrigued, ultimately turned it down to do ''[[Apollo 13 (Film)|Apollo 13]]''. Due to the lack of star power and the mediocre box-office performance of the first film, the distributional and promotional cost for a theater release was considered to be too high and the feature film division lost interest. The film was on the verge of being canceled entirely due to high costs when several actors and effects artists offered to lower their rates or do the jobs for free just to help the film get produced; this included S.S. Wilson, who offered to direct the film for free to save money on hiring another director.\n\nAlthough the first film was only a minor theatrical hit, it would go on to be far more successful on the home-video rental market. This caused ''Tremors 2'' to be moved to the MCA/Universal home video division on a budget of $4 million. Despite the budget being severely slashed, the same script was ultimately used but with several special effects sequences scrapped, including a scene where Burt Gummer commandeers a tank and a scene where characters fight the monsters using [[American Civil War]] muskets. To assist with costs, the location was changed from Australia to southern [[Mexico]].<ref name=intro>{{cite web |url=http://www.stampede-entertainment.com/wrmkllr/intro.html |title=Intro To ''Tremors II'' |website=Stampede Entertainment |access-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> Filming took place near [[Valencia, California]] in a total of 27 days in early 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stampede-entertainment.com/wrmkllr/brd.html |title=Story Board |website=Stampede Entertainment |access-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> The film was also released straight-to-video with only a limited theater release.<ref name=intro/>\n\n===Props===\nIn ''Tremors 2: Aftershocks'', the creature design team, [[Amalgamated Dynamics]], was faced with a challenge different from the first film. In ''Tremors'', the graboids spend most of their time underground, and thus a prop was not needed for these scenes. However, in this film the shriekers spend all their time above ground and there are always more shriekers than graboids, thus the need for more props. The shrieker props used in the film include two fully articulated, full-scale puppet shrieker,<ref name=full>{{cite web |url=http://www.stampede-entertainment.com/wrmkllr/behind.html#shrieker |title=Fully Articulated Shrieker |website=Stampede Entertainment |access-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> three hand-puppet versions of the shriekers,<ref name=hand>{{cite web |url=http://www.stampede-entertainment.com/wrmkllr/behind.html#hand |title=Hand Puppet Shrieker |website=Stampede Entertainment |access-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> and three un-jointed non-articulated rubber shrieker dummies.<ref name=stunt>{{cite web |url=http://www.stampede-entertainment.com/wrmkllr/behind.html#stunt |title=\"Stunt\" Shriekers |website=Stampede Entertainment |access-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> The fully articulated, full-scale puppet shrieker required 16 puppeteers to operate,<ref name=behind>{{cite web |url=http://www.stampede-entertainment.com/wrmkllr/behind.html#behind |title=The Shrieker Controls |website=Stampede Entertainment |access-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> while the rubber shrieker dummies, not requiring puppeteers, were used in scenes when a shrieker needed to be dropped, shot, or exploded.<ref name=stunt/>\n\nOne of the full scale graboids used in the film was a refurbished model that was used in the first film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stampede-entertainment.com/monstermakers/a-tremors-03-l.html |title=Refurbished Graboid From Tremors |website=Stampede Entertainment |access-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Effects===\nTo achieve the infrared view of the shriekers as seen in several scenes, the actors wore red suits and yellow stockings, then were shot in [[Hi-8]] video tape and blown up to [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] to add an additional grainy effect.
