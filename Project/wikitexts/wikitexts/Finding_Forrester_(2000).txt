In the film, a black teenager, Jamal Wallace ([[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]), is invited to attend a prestigious private high school. By chance, Jamal befriends a reclusive writer, William Forrester ([[Sean Connery]]), through whom he refines his talent for writing and comes to terms with his identity. [[Anna Paquin]], [[F. Murray Abraham]], [[Michael Pitt]], [[Glenn Fitzgerald]],  April Grace, [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Charles Bernstein (poet)|Charles Bernstein]] star in supporting roles.\n\nAlthough the film is not based on a true story, film critics have compared the character portrayed by Connery with real-life writer [[J.

They are watched by William Forrester, a recluse who never leaves his apartment and has become a neighborhood [[urban legend]]. Dared by his friends, Jamal sneaks into the apartment, but is surprised by Forrester and flees, leaving his backpack behind. Forrester later drops the backpack onto the street, having edited Jamal\u2019s personal writings. Jamal asks him to read more of his writing, but Forrester angrily tells him to begin with 5,000 words on why he should \"stay out of my home.\" Jamal does so, leaving the essay on Forrester\u2019s doorstep, and is invited inside.\n\nDue to his high test scores, Jamal is offered a full academic scholarship and transfers to Mailor-Callow, a prestigious [[Manhattan]] private school, with the understanding that he will join the basketball team. Jamal learns that Forrester is the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author of a famous novel, ''Avalon Landing'', but never published another book. Forrester agrees to help Jamal with his writing as long as he does not ask about Forrester\u2019s life or tell anyone about him. They bond as Forrester gives Jamal his own work to rewrite, on the condition that their writing never leaves the apartment. Jamal's writing improves, leading one of his professors, Robert Crawford, to suspect him of [[plagiarism]].\n\nJamal befriends his classmate Claire and excels on the basketball court, but is alienated from his old friends. He convinces Forrester to attend a game with him at [[Madison Square Garden]], but they become separated and Forrester, overwhelmed by the crowd, has an anxiety attack. With his brother Terrell\u2019s help, Jamal takes Forrester onto the empty field at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], where an emotional Forrester reveals he often came with his brother. He tells Jamal about his brother's trauma returning home from [[World War II]] \u2013 the basis for his book \u2013 and how Forrester's indirect role in his death, followed by the deaths of their parents, led him to become a recluse.\n\nStill suspicious, Crawford forces Jamal to complete his next assignment in his presence. Running out of time to enter the school\u2019s essay competition, Jamal submits one of Forrester's exercises to the contest, and humiliates Crawford during class. He is called before Crawford and the school board, who reveal that Forrester had published the article upon which Jamal based his essay. Asked to prove he had the author\u2019s permission to use his material, Jamal keeps his promise to Forrester and says nothing. Crawford demands he read a letter of apology to his classmates, but Jamal refuses, endangering his scholarship. Telling Forrester what he has done, Jamal asks his friend to defend him, but Forrester is angry Jamal betrayed his trust by taking their writing, and is still unwilling to leave his home.\n\nThe school assures Jamal that the plagiarism charges will be dropped if he wins the state basketball tournament, but he deliberately misses the final free throws, costing them the championship. Watching the game on TV, Forrester manages to ride his bicycle through the city. Terrell gives him a letter from Jamal, who arrives at school for the essay contest. Forrester appears, and reads a heartfelt essay to the captive audience. He acknowledges his friendship with Jamal, whom he explains had his blessing to use his material, but Crawford declares that this will not influence the school\u2019s decision. Forrester reveals that the essay he recited was actually the letter Jamal had written, and the headmaster overrules Crawford and clears Jamal\u2019s name. Jamal leaves with Forrester, who plans to visit his native [[Scotland]].\n\nOne year later, Jamal is preparing to graduate from Mailor-Callow. He meets with Sanderson, an attorney, who explains that Forrester has died, having been diagnosed with cancer before he met Jamal. Forrester has bequeathed his apartment to Jamal, with a letter thanking him for rekindling his desire to live. Jamal is also given the manuscript of Forrester's second novel, for which he is expected to write the [[foreword]], and joins his old friends in a basketball game.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sean Connery]] as William Forrester\n* [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]] as Jamal Wallace\n* [[F.
