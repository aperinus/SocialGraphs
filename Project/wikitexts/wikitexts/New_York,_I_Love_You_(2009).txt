The shorts all relate in some way to the subject of love, and are set among the five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of [[New York City]]. The film is a [[Spiritual successor|sequel of sorts]] to the 2006 film ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'', which had the same structure, and is the second installment in the ''Cities of Love'' franchise, created and produced by [[Emmanuel Benbihy]]. Unlike ''Paris, je t'aime'', the shorts of ''New York, I Love You'' all have a unifying thread, of a [[videographer]] who films the other characters.\n\nThe film stars an [[ensemble cast]], among them [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Anton Yelchin]], [[Hayden Christensen]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Irrfan Khan]], [[Rachel Bilson]], [[Chris Cooper]], [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[John Hurt]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Robin Wright]], [[Julie Christie]], [[Maggie Q]], [[Ethan Hawke]], [[James Caan]], [[Shu Qi]], and [[Eli Wallach]].\n\n''New York, I Love You'' premiered at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2008, and was released in the United States on October 16, 2009. While the TIFF premiere of the film featured 14 novellas, distributors later decided to cut two of them: [[Scarlett Johansson]]'s directorial debut \"These Vagabond Shoes\" and [[Andrei Zvyagintsev]]'s novella \"Apocrypha\". The decision was taken after a focus screening in New York, where these two shorts were met with unfavorable reactions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.az-film.com/en/Movies/2.html | title=Apocrypha | publisher=[[Andrey Zvyagintsev]] | access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and crew==\nFollowing is the cast and crew of ten segments of ''New York, I Love You'' with the transition segment directed by Randy Balsmeyer:<ref>{{cite video |title = New York, I Love You |format = DVD |publisher = Vivendi Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
