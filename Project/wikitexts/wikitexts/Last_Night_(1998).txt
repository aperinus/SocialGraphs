It was produced as part of the French film project [[2000, Seen By...]]. McKellar wrote the screenplay about how ordinary people would react to an unstated imminent [[Global catastrophic risk|global catastrophic event]]. Set in [[Toronto]], Ontario, the film was made and released when many were concerned about the [[Year 2000 problem]].\n\nThe film was released to positive reviews for McKellar's direction and Oh's acting. It won awards at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and [[1998 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festivals]], and three [[19th Genie Awards|Genie Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Oh.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Toronto, a group of friends and family prepare for the end of the world, expected at midnight as the result of a calamity that is not explained, but which has been expected for several months. There has been panic and rioting after the imminent catastrophe was announced, but the chaos has since largely died down, with only sporadic murders, robberies, and incidents of vandalism as humanity accepts that Earth's demise is going to happen. On the last evening, Sandra\u2019s car is vandalized by passersby while she scavenges leftovers in a supermarket, leaving her stranded. Meanwhile, Patrick meets with his extended family for a mock Christmas dinner celebration; Duncan, husband of Sandra, spends much of the day calling his customers to reassure them that their heating gas will be kept on until the very end; Craig is having sex with Lily as part of his plan to mark every sexual milestone he can think of before the end.\n\nPatrick leaves the dinner prematurely to spend his final hours alone in his apartment. However, he unexpectedly meets Sandra at his front door. After Sandra begs him for help, Patrick reluctantly lets her in to use his phone to contact Duncan. Patrick then suggests Sandra steal a car as she leaves his apartment. Meanwhile, Craig and Mrs. Carlton are having sex, and Donna turns up the music and lets go of herself in the power company after Duncan had left.\n\nPatrick meets his high school friend, Menzies, who is driving around to give out tickets to his concert with his cousin while Patrick and Sandra are trying to [[Hitchhiking|hitchhike]]. Later, Patrick, while visiting Craig in his apartment, convinces Craig to lend him car, despite his reluctance. After Sandra leaves, Craig tries to convince Patrick to enjoy sex in the final hours, and discloses his omnisexual approach to addressing all of his fantasies before \"the end.\" Craig later tells Patrick that he is not belittling Patrick, but trying to inspire him to enjoy his final hours. While Patrick is leaving Craig's apartment, Craig attempts to have a homosexual affair with him, but he refuses, despite his love for Craig.\n\nIn the final hour, Duncan opens the door upon hearing a gunshot on the street only to be held hostage by Marty; in the concert that only a few people attended, Mrs. Carlton quietly walks in while Menzies plays piano poorly on the stage. Sandra is stopped by a group of protesters who block traffic and vandalize her car. Sandra then returns to Patrick's apartment. Using Patrick's phone, Sandra listens to Duncan's voicemail in which he assured his power company's customers that the gas will be running 'til the end.  Upon realizing she will not reunite with Duncan, Sandra asks Patrick to join in her [[suicide pact]] which she had with Duncan. Patrick initially refuses, stating that he needs to know her more and to find a reason to love her in order to consider it, so they share their stories, slowly progressing into a serious topic: Patrick's lost loved one.\n\nAs midnight approaches, Craig meets with Donna and finds it difficult to believe that she is a virgin. Donna finds herself ashamed but Craig successfully turns the situation around and they have sex. While Patrick and Sandra make their final attempt to contact Duncan, it is revealed that Duncan was killed by a mob. Patrick and Sandra both sit on the roof facing each other, listening to the song \"[[Guantanamera]],\" each holding a loaded pistol to the other's temple. However, as the final seconds approach, both characters, overcome with emotion, lower their pistols and slowly embrace in a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Don McKellar]] as Patrick Wheeler, the male protagonist who is depressed after losing his loved one due to sickness.\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Sandra, Duncan's wife, the female protagonist who is stranded in the city.\n* [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as Craig Zwiller, Patrick's best friend.
