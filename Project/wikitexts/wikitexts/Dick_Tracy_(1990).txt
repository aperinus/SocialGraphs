[[Warren Beatty]] produced, directed, and starred in the film, whose supporting cast includes [[Al Pacino]], [[Madonna]], [[Glenne Headly]], and [[Charlie Korsmo]]. ''Dick Tracy'' depicts the detective's romantic relationships with [[Breathless Mahoney]] and [[Tess Trueheart]] as well as his conflicts with crime boss [[Alphonse \"Big Boy\" Caprice]] and his henchmen. Tracy also begins fostering a young street urchin named Kid.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in the early 1980s with [[Tom Mankiewicz]] assigned to write the script. The screenplay was written instead by [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps Jr.]], both of ''[[Top Gun]]'' fame. The project also went through directors [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Landis]], [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]], and [[Richard Benjamin]] before the arrival of Beatty. It was filmed mainly at [[Universal Studios]]. [[Danny Elfman]] was hired to compose the score, and the film's music was featured on three separate soundtrack albums.\n\n''Dick Tracy'' premiered at the [[Uptown Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Uptown Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], on June 10, 1990 and was released nationwide a day later. Reviews ranged from favorable to mixed, with positive comments on Madonna's acting and Beatty's direction. The film was a success at the box office and at awards time. It garnered seven Academy Award nominations, winning in three of the categories: [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]].<ref name=oscars>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1991 |title=1990 (63) Academy Awards |work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |access-date=April 27, 2009 }}</ref> ''Dick Tracy'' is remembered today for its [[Style (visual arts)|visual style]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1938,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8790397/dick-tracy-movie-25|title=Dick Tracy was unlike any other movie made in 1990 \u2014 and any movie made today|first=Emily Todd|last=VanDerWerff|date=June 17, 2015|website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Garyn G|title=Dick Tracy and American Culture: Morality and Mythology, Text and Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-OCBcT1O4UC&pg=PA277|year=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C|isbn=978-0-7864-1698-1|page=277|oclc=27977131}}</ref> at an illegal card game, a 10-year-old young [[Street children|street urchin]] witnesses the massacre of a group of mobsters at the hands of Flattop and Itchy, two of the hoods on the payroll of Alphonse \"Big Boy\" Caprice. Big Boy's crime syndicate is aggressively taking over small businesses in the city. Detective Dick Tracy catches the urchin (who calls himself \"Kid\") in an act of petty theft. After rescuing him from a ruthless host, Tracy temporarily adopts him with the help of his girlfriend, Tess Trueheart.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Boy coerces club owner Lips Manlis into signing over the deed to Club Ritz. He then kills Lips with a [[Cement shoes|cement overcoat]] (referred to onscreen as \"The Bath\") and steals his girlfriend, the seductive and sultry singer Breathless Mahoney. After Lips is reported missing, Tracy interrogates his three hired guns Flattop, Itchy, and Mumbles, then goes to the club to arrest Big Boy for Lips' murder. Breathless is the only witness. Instead of providing testimony, she unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Tracy. Big Boy cannot be indicted, and he is released from jail. Big Boy's next move is to try to bring other criminals, including Spud Spaldoni, Pruneface, Influence, Texie Garcia, Ribs Mocca, and Numbers, together under his leadership. Spaldoni refuses and is killed with a [[carbomb]], leaving Dick Tracy, who discovered the meeting and was attempting to spy on it, wondering what is going on. The next day, Big Boy and his henchmen kidnap Tracy and attempt to bribe him; Tracy rebuffs them, prompting the criminals to attempt to kill him. However, Tracy is saved by Kid, who is then bestowed by the police with an honorary detective certificate, which will remain temporary until he decides on a legitimate name for himself.\n\nBreathless shows up at Tracy's apartment, once again in an attempt to seduce him. Tracy allows her to kiss him. Tess witnesses this scene and eventually leaves town. Tracy leads a seemingly unsuccessful raid on Club Ritz, but it is actually a diversion so that Officer \"Bug\" Bailey can enter the building to operate a secretly installed listening device so the police can listen in on Big Boy's criminal activities. The resultant raids all but wipe out Big Boy's criminal empire. However, Big Boy discovers Bug, and captures him for a trap planned by Influence and Pruneface to kill Tracy in the warehouse. In the resulting gun battle, a stranger with no face called \"The Blank\" steps out of the shadows to save Tracy after he is cornered, and kills Pruneface. Influence escapes as Tracy rescues Bug from the fate that befell Lips Manlis, and Big Boy is enraged to hear that The Blank foiled the hit. Tracy again attempts to extract the testimony from Breathless that he needs to put Big Boy away. She agrees to testify only if Tracy agrees to give in to her advances. Tess eventually has a change of heart, but before she can tell Tracy, she is kidnapped by The Blank, with the help of Big Boy's club piano player, 88 Keys. Tracy is drugged and rendered unconscious by The Blank, then framed for murdering the corrupt District Attorney John Fletcher, whereupon he is detained by the police. The Kid, meanwhile, adopts the name \"Dick Tracy, Jr.\"\n\nBig Boy's business thrives until The Blank frames him for Tess' kidnapping. Released by his colleagues on New Year's Eve, Tracy interrogates Mumbles, and arrives at a gun battle outside the Club Ritz where Big Boy's men are killed or captured by Tracy and the police. Abandoning his crew, Big Boy flees to a drawbridge and ties Tess to its gears before he is confronted by Tracy. Their fight is halted when The Blank appears and holds both men at gunpoint, offering to share the city with Tracy after Big Boy is dead. When Junior arrives, Big Boy takes advantage of the distraction and opens fire before Tracy sends him falling to his death in the bridge's gears, while Junior rescues Tess. Mortally wounded, The Blank is unmasked to reveal Breathless Mahoney, who kisses Tracy before dying. All charges against Tracy are dropped.\n\nLater, Tracy proposes to Tess, but is interrupted by the report of a robbery in progress. He leaves her with the ring before he and Dick Tracy, Jr., depart to respond to the robbery.\n\n==Cast==\n;Main characters\n* [[Warren Beatty]] as [[Dick Tracy (character)|Dick Tracy]]: a square-jawed, fast-shooting, hard-hitting, and intelligent police detective sporting a yellow overcoat and fedora.

At the time, the [[film rights]] were owned by [[Michael Laughlin]], who gave up his option from [[Tribune Media Services]] after he was unsuccessful in [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]] ''Dick Tracy'' to Hollywood studios. [[Floyd Mutrux]] and [[Art Linson]] purchased the film rights from the Tribune in 1977,<ref name=week/> and, in 1980, [[United Artists]] became interested in financing/distributing ''Dick Tracy''. [[Tom Mankiewicz]] was under negotiations to write the script, based on his previous success with ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980). The deal fell through when [[Chester Gould]], creator of the ''Dick Tracy'' comic strip, insisted on strict financial and [[artistic control]].<ref>{{cite news | first= Daniel|last=Dickholtz | title = Steel Dreams: Interview With Tom Mankiewicz | work = [[Starlog]] | date = December 1998 | pages = 53\u201357 }}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Mutrux and Linson eventually took the property to [[Paramount Pictures]], who began developing screenplays, offered [[Steven Spielberg]] the director's position, and brought in [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] to co-finance. Universal put [[John Landis]] forward as a candidate for director, courted [[Clint Eastwood]] for the title role, and commissioned [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps, Jr.]] to write the screenplay. \"Before we were brought on, there were several failed scripts at Universal,\" reflected Epps, \"then it went dormant, but John Landis was interested in ''Dick Tracy'', and he brought us in to write it.\"<ref name=first/> Cash and Epps' simple orders from Landis were to write the script in a 1930s [[pulp magazine]] atmosphere and center it with [[Alphonse \"Big Boy\" Caprice]] as the primary villain. For research, Epps read every ''Dick Tracy'' comic strip from 1930 to 1957. The writers wrote two drafts for Landis; [[Max Allan Collins]], then-writer of the ''Dick Tracy'' comic strip, remembers reading one of them. \"It was terrible. The only positive thing about it was a thirties setting and lots of great villains, but the story was paper-thin and it was uncomfortably [[camp (style)|campy]].\"<ref name=first/>\n\nIn addition to Beatty and Eastwood, other actors who were considered for the lead role included [[Harrison Ford]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Tom Selleck]], and [[Mel Gibson]].<ref name=leading>Hughes, pp. 53-54</ref> Landis left ''Dick Tracy'' following the controversial on-set accident on ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983), in which three actors were killed.<ref name=first>Hughes, pp. 51</ref> [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]] then came on board to direct with [[Joel Silver]] as producer.

Cash and Epps continued to rewrite the script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the ''Dick Tracy'' rights himself for $3 million,<ref name=$101/> along with the Cash/Epps script.

Their main intention was to stay close to [[Chester Gould]]'s original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the [[Art Deco]] movement and [[German Expressionism]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Kathleen Beckett-Young | title = The Movie's Creators Used the Strip To Tease | date = June 10, 1990 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\nFor Storaro, the limited color palette was the most challenging aspect of production. \"These are not the kind of colors the audience is used to seeing,\" he noted. \"These are much more dramatic in strength, in saturation. Comic strip art is usually done with very simple and primitive ideas and emotions,\" Storaro theorized. \"One of the elements is that the story is usually told in [[vignette (graphic design)|vignette]], so what we tried to do is never move the camera at all. ''Never''.

Shortly after the release of the 1990 film, Max Allan Collins wrote ''Dick Tracy Goes to War''. The story is set after the commencement of [[World War II]], and involves Dick Tracy's enlistment in the [[U.S. Navy]], working for their Military Intelligence Division (as he did in the comic strip). In the story, [[Nazi]] saboteurs Black Pearl and Mrs. Pruneface ([[Pruneface]]'s widow) set up a sabotage/[[espionage]] operation out of Caprice's old headquarters in Club Ritz. For their activities, they recruit B.B. Eyes, The Mole, and Shaky. Their reign of terror, culminating in an attempt to bomb a weapons plant, is averted by Tracy. A year after ''War'' was released, Collins wrote a third novel titled ''Dick Tracy Meets His Match'', in which Tracy finally follows through on his marriage proposal to Tess Trueheart.\n\nIn April 2016, Beatty again mentioned the possibility of producing a sequel when he attended CinemaCon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/warren-beatty-dick-tracy-howard-hughes-movie-1201752997/|title=Warren Beatty Eyeing 'Dick Tracy' Sequel, Howard Hughes Movie Gets Release Date|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Rainey|first=James|date=April 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[List of 1990 box office number-one films in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n* {{cite book|author=Mike Bonifer|title=Dick Tracy: The Making of the Movie|publisher=[[Bantam Books]]|date=June 1990|isbn=0-553-34900-7|location=New York City}}\n* {{cite book|author=David Hughes|title=Comic Book Movies|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|year=2003 | chapter=Dick Tracy|isbn=0-7535-0767-6|location=London}}\n* {{cite book|author=[[James B.
