A loose adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s posthumously published 1965 [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a breakthrough technological solution to [[1973 oil crisis|contemporary energy shortages]], while facing the assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], the \"Man with the Golden Gun\". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.\n\n''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was the fourth and final film in the series directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The script was written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. The film was set in the face of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 energy crisis]], a dominant theme in the script; Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then-popular [[martial arts film]] craze, with several [[kung fu]] scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. Part of the film is also set in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], but it was not shot there.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. [[Christopher Lee]]'s portrayal of Scaramanga as a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond was praised, but reviewers criticised the film as a whole, particularly its comedic approach and the performances of Moore and [[Britt Ekland]]. Whilst profitable, the film is the fourth lowest-grossing in the series, and its relatively modest returns by comparison with those of ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973) reportedly placed the continuation of the franchise in jeopardy.<ref name=Aldis-2020>{{cite web |last=Aldis |first=Ben |date=21 March 2020 |title=The Man With The Golden Gun Almost Ended James Bond Movies |url=https://screenrant.com/james-bond-movies-man-golden-gun-bad/ |website=Screen Rant |access-date=23 March 2020 |archive-date=22 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322133620/https://screenrant.com/james-bond-movies-man-golden-gun-bad/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the last Bond film to be co-produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in [[Danjaq, LLC]], the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nAn American gangster, Rodney, visits famed crack shot hitman [[Francisco Scaramanga]] to kill him and collect a bounty, but he is directed into a [[funhouse]] section of the estate, where Scaramanga eventually retrieves his golden gun and kills him.\n\nIn London, a golden bullet etched with '007' is received by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]; it is believed to have been sent by Scaramanga, but because no one knows of his appearance outside of having a [[Supernumerary nipple|third nipple]], [[M (James Bond)|M]] relieves Bond of his current mission involving tracking an energy scientist named Gibson.\n\nAt a hint from Moneypenny, Bond sets out unofficially to locate Scaramanga, first by retrieving a spent golden bullet from a [[belly dancer]] in [[Beirut]]. He traces the bullet to a gun maker in [[Macau]], and forces him to reveal how he ships the bullets. Bond follows the shipment carried to Hong Kong by Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress. At her [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]] room, he coerces her to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans. She directs Bond to the [[Bottoms Up Club]] where Scaramanga snipes Gibson when he steps outside, and Scaramanga's [[midget]] assistant Nick Nack steals a small device called the Solex Agitator off his body. Bond, who had pulled out his pistol outside the club, is arrested by Hong Kong police lieutenant Hip. But instead of going to the station, he is transported to the wreck of {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} in the harbour where he meets M and Q, and is assigned to work with Hip to retrieve the Solex.\n\nBond travels to [[Bangkok]] to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Thai entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Posing as Scaramanga by showing off his fake third nipple, Bond is invited to dinner, but his plan backfires because unbeknownst to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Fat's estate. Bond is captured and placed inside Fat's martial arts academy, where the students duel to the death and then are instructed to kill him. Escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorised [[sampan]] along the river, and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Fat with his golden gun and assumes control of his empire and the Solex.\n\nAnders reveals to Bond that she sent the bullet to London. She wants him to kill Scaramanga, and promises to give him the Solex as they spent the night together. At a [[Muay Thai]] boxing event the next day, Bond finds Anders sitting and staring silently, dead from a bullet to the heart. Scaramanga arrives and introduces himself to Bond, but Bond is able to smuggle the Solex to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight follows Nick Nack to place a [[homing device]] on Scaramanga's car, Scaramanga traps her in the [[Trunk (car)|car's boot]]. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an [[AMC Hornet]] from a showroom to give chase, coincidentally with the holidaying [[Sheriff J.W. Pepper|J.W. Pepper]] (the [[Louisiana]]n sheriff Bond encountered in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'') sitting inside. The chase concludes when Scaramanga's [[AMC Matador]] hides in a building and then transforms into a plane that flies off.\n\nTracking Goodnight's [[homing beacon]], Bond takes a [[seaplane]] and flies to Scaramanga's island in the [[People's Republic of China|Red Chinese]] waters. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the [[solar power plant]] facility that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses the solar-powered energy beam to destroy Bond's plane, preventing him from escaping.\n\nDuring lunch, Scaramanga proposes a [[pistol duel]] with Bond on the beach. With Nick Nack officiating, the two men take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's manor and funhouse section. Bond eventually outwits and kills Scaramanga by posing as his mannequin. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, but the latter's fall into a [[liquid helium]] vat causes the plant's temperature to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the plant is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's [[Junk (ship)|Chinese junk]]. After Bond fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, he romances Goodnight.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond in film|James Bond \u2013 007]], an MI6 agent who receives a golden bullet, supposedly from Scaramanga, indicating that he is a target of Scaramanga.\n<!-- starring -->\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Francisco Scaramanga#Film biography|Francisco Scaramanga]], an assassin who is identified by his use of a golden gun; he also has a 'superfluous papilla', or [[supernumerary nipple]].
