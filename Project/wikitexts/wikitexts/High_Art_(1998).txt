The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival|1998 Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. It was given a [[Limited theatrical release|limited release]] in the United States on June 12, 1998.\n\n''High Art'' was acclaimed by critics. For her performance, Ally Sheedy won the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead]], the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress]], and the [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nSydney (or simply \"Syd\"), age 24, is a woman who has her whole life mapped out in front of her. Living with longtime boyfriend James, and working her way up at the respected high-art photography magazine ''Frame,'' Syd has desires and frustrations that seem typical and manageable. But when a crack in her ceiling springs a leak and Syd finds herself knocking on the door of her upstairs neighbor, a chance meeting suddenly takes her on a new path.\n\nOpening the door to an uncharted world for Syd is Lucy Berliner, a renowned photographer, enchanting, elusive, and curiously retired. Now 40, Lucy lives with her once glamorous, heroin-addicted German girlfriend Greta, and plays host to a collection of hard-living party kids. Syd is fascinated by Lucy and becomes drawn into the center of Lucy's strangely alluring life upstairs.\n\nSyd mentions Lucy to her bosses (without realising that she is famous) but they remain uninterested until they realise exactly who Lucy is. At a lunch, Lucy agrees to work for the magazine as long as Syd is her editor. Soon a working relationship develops between the two and a project is underway which promises a second chance for Lucy's career. But as Syd and Lucy's collaboration draws them closer together, their working relationship turns sexual and the lines between love and professionalism suddenly blur. As Syd slowly discovers the darker truths of Lucy's life on the edge, she is forced to confront her own hunger for recognition and the uncertain rewards of public esteem.\n\n==Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Lucy Berliner\n* [[Radha Mitchell]] as Syd, an assistant editor at ''Frame''\n* [[Gabriel Mann (actor)|Gabriel Mann]] as James, Syd's live-in boyfriend\n* [[Charis Michelsen]] as Debby\n* [[David Thornton (actor)|David Thornton]] as Harry, an editor at ''Frame'' and Syd's boss\n* [[Anh Duong]] as Dominique, chief editor of ''Frame''\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Greta, a German actress and Lucy's live-in girlfriend\n* Helen Mendes as White Hawk\n* [[Bill Sage]] as Arnie\n* [[Tammy Grimes]] as Vera, Lucy's mother\n* Cindra Feuer as Delia\n* [[Anthony Ruivivar]] as Xanderr\n* Elaine Tse as Zoe\n* [[Rudolf Martin]] as Dieter\n* Laura Ekstrand as Waitress\n* [[Sarita Choudhury]] as Joan\n}}\n\n==Production notes==\nThe photography by Lucy Berliner (Sheedy) was based on [[Nan Goldin]]'s work.
