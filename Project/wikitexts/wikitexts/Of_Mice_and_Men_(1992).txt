Directed and produced by [[Gary Sinise]], the film features Sinise as George Milton, alongside [[John Malkovich]] as Lennie Small, with [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Curley, [[John Terry (actor)|John Terry]] as Slim, [[Ray Walston]] as Candy, [[Joe Morton]] as Crooks, and [[Sherilyn Fenn]] as Curley's wife.\n\n[[Horton Foote]] adapted the story for film. Its plot centers on George and the [[intellectually disabled]] Lennie, two farm workers who travel together and dream of one day owning their own land. The film explores themes of discrimination, loneliness, and the [[American Dream]], as well as the desire for a place to call home. \n\n''Of Mice and Men'' took part in the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]], where Sinise was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] award, given to the director of the best-featured film. After the film debuted in the United States on October 2, 1992, it received acclaim from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n<!--Do not add the year, it was never specified.-->\nThe movie opens with George reminiscing in a boxcar.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], quick-witted George Milton and physically strong but [[mentally disabled]] Lennie Small are fleeing their previous employment, where Lennie was accused of attempted [[rape]] after he held on to a young woman, prompted by his love of stroking soft things. They travel to work on Tyler ranch near Soledad.\n\nGeorge reluctantly agrees to tell Lennie again about their dream, describing how they will one day have their own piece of land where Lennie will tend their rabbits. George says if Lennie should ever get in trouble, he is to hide in the brush and wait for him. At Tyler Ranch, the Boss is suspicious of Lennie's mental condition; George claims Lennie was kicked in the head by a horse when he was a child. They befriend old one-handed [[Cowboy|ranch-hand]] Candy, but dislike the Boss' son, Curley, who hates people bigger than him. Curley's attractive wife flirts with Lennie and George, and George instructs Lennie to avoid her.\n\nGeorge meets their work team, respected head man Slim, and Carlson, who suggests they shoot Candy's sick old dog and get one of his pups. Lennie excitedly asks George for a pup. After a hard day, George is proud of Lennie's work and gets him his puppy. Candy offers to pitch in with Lennie and George to buy their farm. Just as it seems their dream is moving closer to fruition, Curley accuses Slim of keeping his wife company. Curley viciously attacks Lennie for laughing, yelling at him to fight back. Prompted by George, Lennie crushes Curley's hand. George fears for their jobs, but Slim gives Curley an ultimatum: if Curley tries to get George and Lennie fired, Slim will humiliate Curley by telling everyone how Curley's hand really got crushed. Concerned for his reputation, Curley reluctantly agrees to say his hand got caught in a machine.\n\nLennie talks about being lonely, and Curley's wife attempts to engage him in conversation. Frustrated, she runs to the house in tears vowing to leave the ranch forever. In the barn that evening, Lennie has accidentally killed his puppy and is greatly upset. Curley's wife enters and admits her loneliness, confiding that her dreams of being a [[actress|movie star]] were crushed. Learning of Lennie's love of petting soft things, she lets him stroke her hair. She soon complains and then screams that he is pulling too hard. Trying to keep her quiet, Lennie accidentally breaks her neck. He runs to hide in the brush as George told him to do. Candy finds Curley's wife dead and informs George. Curley leads a lynch mob but George finds Lennie first and calms him by retelling their dream. As George gets to the part where Lennie tends the rabbits, he shoots Lennie in the back of the head, sparing him from a cruel death at the hands of the mob.\n\nThe scene returns to George in the boxcar, heading South.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as George Milton\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Lennie Small\n* [[Ray Walston]] as Candy\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Curley\n* [[Sherilyn Fenn]] as Curley's wife\n* [[Noble Willingham]] as the Boss\n* [[John Terry (actor)|John Terry]] as Slim\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Carlson\n* [[Joe Morton]] as Crooks \n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as the Bus Driver\n* [[Moira Harris]] as the Girl in the Red Dress\n* [[Alexis Arquette|Robert (later Alexis) Arquette]] as Whitt\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe first experience Sinise had with Steinbeck's work came when Sinise attended [[Highland Park High School (Highland Park, Illinois)|Highland Park High School]]. His drama class went to [[Guthrie Theater]] and observed three plays in two days, one being ''Of Mice and Men''. After viewing the play, he \"stood up and applauded\" and \"was trying to scream some sort of acknowledgement of my feelings ... but I was so choked up nothing came out except tears.\" He credits the play with \"[introducing] me to literature\".<ref name=\"Production_1\">{{cite news|title=Sinise To Steinbeck To Sinise: A Lifelong Passion Comes To The Screen|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-09-13/entertainment/9203230681_1_mice-and-men-john-steinbeck-john-malkovich|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|date=September 13, 1992|last=Terry|first=Clifford}}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\nThrough the story of George and Lennie and their pursuit of a place to call home Steinbeck highlights that sometimes as stated by Charlotte Cook Hadella in her ''Of Mice and Men: A Kinship of Powerlessness''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://col-fsu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991005597206004773&context=L&vid=01COL_FSU:01COL_FSU&lang=en&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=flite&query=any,contains,of%20mice%20and%20men |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=col-fsu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com |language=en}}</ref> \"real life is more complex than \u201clife\u201d as depicted in realistic art.\" this is shown in George and Lennie's pursuit of the American dream, which to them meant purchasing their own farm so they would finally have a place to call their own. What follows is a tragic tale of how life can be more unpredictable and tragic than any film or novel ever devised. \n\n== Historical Context ==\nThe Great Depression was a period within the 1930s that reflected a great growth between the wealth-gap in America, Steinbeck worked as a laborer during the 1920s which exposed him tio the lives of many migrant workers and their stories off harship, many of his early works reflect these experiences such as stated by Charlotte Cook Hadella in her ''Of Mice and Men: A Kinship of Powerlessness'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://col-fsu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991005597206004773&context=L&vid=01COL_FSU:01COL_FSU&lang=en&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=flite&query=any,contains,of%20mice%20and%20men |access-date=2022-10-16 |website=col-fsu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com |language=en}}</ref> \"One of his earliest published stories, \u201cFingers of Cloud\u201d (1924), takes place in the bunkhouse of a Filipino work gang. Tortilla Flat (1935), his first commercial success, details the lives of the paisanos, people of Spanish-Mexican descent who lived in the hills above Monterey. Juan Chicoy, a Mexican Indian, is the central character in The Wayward Bus (1947). Given the multiracial configuration of the California labor force in the early decades of the twentieth century, we may conclude that in Of Mice and Men, where the laborers are white Americans, Steinbeck did not intend to draw an accurate sociohistorical picture. Still, the subsistence-level economy, the tensions between workers and owners, and the social marginality of the migrant workers in the novella ring true to the historical details of the actual setting.\"\n\n== Differences between the Film and Book ==\nWhile the film and book tell the same story there are some creative liberties taken within the film, such as the scene that depicts Lennie killing the puppy. In the book Lennie feels remorse for what he had done, while in the film he simply paces around while holding the puppy. This shows how the book depicts Lennie in a much more sympathetic fashion compared to the film. Another difference between the film and the book is the important scene depicting George shooting Lennie, within the movie George shoots Lennie very quickly with little to no hesitation. In the book George hesitates to shoot Lennie which shows how he is depicted as a more sympathetic character within the book. Another difference is the depiction of the character of Curley's wife, in the book she is depicted as flirtatious and cruel and when she dies she is painted as less of a victim than in the movie where she is depicted as more bland/bored and therefore painted as more of a victim.<ref>{{Cite web |last=West |first=Thomas |date=2020-04-15 |title=Of Mice And Men: 10 Differences Between The Book And The Film |url=https://screenrant.com/of-mice-and-men-differences-book-film/ |access-date=2022-10-10 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> \n\n==Release and reception==\nOn April 16, 1992, Gilles Jacob, director of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], announced the 27 films competing in the \"[[Cannes Film Festival#Programmes|Official Competition]]\" category, including ''Of Mice and Men''.
