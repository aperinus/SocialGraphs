The film tells an [[alternate history]] story of two plots to assassinate [[Nazi Germany]]'s leadership\u2014one planned by Shosanna Dreyfus, a young [[History of the Jews in France|French Jewish]] cinema proprietor, and the other by the British; but is ultimately conducted solely by a team of [[Jewish American]] soldiers led by [[First Lieutenant]] Aldo Raine. [[Christoph Waltz]] co-stars as [[Hans Landa]], an [[Standartenf\u00fchrer|SS]] colonel in charge of tracking down Raine's group. The title was inspired by Italian director [[Enzo G. Castellari]]'s 1978 [[Euro War]] film ''[[The Inglorious Bastards]]'', though Tarantino's film is not a remake of it.\n\nTarantino wrote the script in 1998, but struggled with the ending and chose instead to direct the two-part film ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1|Kill Bill]]''. After directing ''[[Death Proof]]'' in 2007, Tarantino returned to work on ''Inglourious Basterds''. A co-production of the United States and Germany, the film began [[principal photography]] in October 2008 and was filmed in Germany and France with a $70 million [[production budget]]. It premiered on May 20, 2009, at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival|62nd Cannes Film Festival]], and received a wide release in theaters in the United States and Europe in August 2009 by [[The Weinstein Company]] and [[Universal Pictures]].\n\n''Inglourious Basterds'' grossed over $321.5 million in theaters worldwide, making it Tarantino's highest-grossing film to that point, until it was surpassed in box office by ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood]]'' (2019). The film received generally positive reviews with Waltz's performance as Hans Landa being singled out for praise, but some criticized the historical liberties taken. It also won multiple awards and nominations, among them eight [[82nd Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]). For his role as Landa, Waltz won the Cannes Film Festival's [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]], as well as the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTA]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Screen Actors Guild]], [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actor|Critics' Choice]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!---Synopsis to be between 400-700 words per Wikipedia policy--->\nIn 1941, [[SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer]] [[Hans Landa]] interrogates French farmer Perrier LaPadite as to the whereabouts of a Jewish family, the Dreyfuses. Landa suspects the LaPadites are hiding them under their floorboards, and in exchange for the [[Nazis]] not murdering his family, LaPadite tearfully confirms it. Landa's soldiers shoot through the floorboards, killing all but Shosanna Dreyfus, who escapes.\n\nIn 1944, Lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits [[Jewish-American]] soldiers to the Basterds, a [[commando]] unit formed to instill fear among Nazis by killing and [[scalping]] them. They include Sergeant Donny \"The Bear Jew\" Donowitz; Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, a German defector; and Corporal Wilhelm Wicki, the group's translator. In Germany, [[Adolf Hitler]] interviews Private Butz, the lone German survivor of a Basterd attack, who reveals that Raine carved a [[swastika]] into Butz's forehead.\n\nShosanna Dreyfus is living in Paris, operating a cinema under the name Emmanuelle Mimieux. She meets Fredrick Zoller, a German sniper famed for killing 250 Allied soldiers in a battle. Zoller is the star of a new Nazi [[propaganda film]], ''Stolz der Nation'' (''Nation's Pride''), and, having become infatuated with Shosanna, convinces [[Joseph Goebbels]] to hold the premiere at her cinema. Landa, the head of security for the premiere, interrogates Shosanna. Shosanna plots with her [[Afro-French]] lover and projectionist, Marcel, to set the cinema ablaze during the premiere, killing the Nazi Party leaders in attendance.\n\nMeanwhile, [[British Commando]] Lieutenant Archie Hicox is recruited to lead an attack on the premiere with the Basterds. Hicox, along with Stiglitz and Wicki, goes to a tavern in German-occupied northern France to meet with German film star Bridget von Hammersmark, an undercover Allied agent who will be attending the premiere. Hicox inadvertently draws the attention of Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and Major Dieter Hellstr\u00f6m, then blows the group's cover by using a British hand gesture. A gunfight ensues, killing everyone except Sergeant Wilhelm and von Hammersmark, who is shot in the leg. Raine arrives and negotiates with Wilhelm for von Hammersmark's release, but she shoots Wilhelm when he lowers his guard. Raine, believing von Hammersmark set his men up, tortures her, but she convinces him she is loyal and reveals Hitler will be attending the premiere. Raine decides to continue, with himself, Donowitz and Omar Ulmer taking the place of Hicox, Stiglitz and Wicki. Later, Landa investigates the tavern and finds von Hammersmark's shoe and a napkin with her signature.\n\nRaine, Donowitz and Ulmer attend the premiere with timed explosives strapped to their ankles. Landa takes von Hammersmark to a room, verifies the shoe from the tavern fits her and kills her. Raine and another Basterd, Smithson Utivich, are taken prisoner. Landa has Raine contact his superior to cut a deal: He will allow the mission to proceed in exchange for his safe passage through the Allied lines, a full [[pardon]] and other privileges.\n\nDuring the screening, Zoller slips away to the projection room and attempts to force himself on Shosanna. She shoots him, and he shoots and kills her before he dies. As the film reaches its climax, Shosanna's spliced-in footage tells the audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Having locked the auditorium doors, Marcel ignites a pile of flammable film behind the screen as Shosanna's image laughs and the theater goes up in flames. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the opera box containing Hitler and Goebbels, submachine-gunning them both down, then firing into the crowd until the bombs go off, killing everyone in the theater.\n\nLanda and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender themselves. Raine shoots the radio operator before ordering Utivich to scalp him. Raine has Landa restrained and carves a swastika into his forehead, professing it to be his \"masterpiece.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Lieutenant {{vanchor|Aldo Raine}} aka \"The Apache\", the battle-hardened commanding officer of the Basterds.
