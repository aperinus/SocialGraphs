Years later in 1985, after defeating a rogue [[Arcade game|arcade machine]] robot, Kung Fury quits the force when he is assigned to partner with Triceracop, fearing that he would lose another partner in the line of duty. Meanwhile, [[Adolf Hitler]], a.k.a. \"Kung F\u00fchrer\", enters the timeline and remotely guns down the police chief and attacks the precinct through a mobile phone. Intent on avenging the chief, Kung Fury has computer whiz Hackerman send him back in time to kill Hitler in [[Nazi Germany]]. A glitch in the system, however, sends him back into the [[Viking Age]]. After Kung Fury meets the Viking valkyries Barbarianna and Katana, the [[Norse god]] [[Thor]] sends him to Nazi Germany for him to finish his job.\n\nUpon his arrival, Kung Fury singlehandedly mows down dozens of Nazi soldiers with his kung fu skills, but is gunned down by Hitler using a [[Rotary cannon|Gatling-type gun]] from inside his podium. Suddenly, Thor, Hackerman, Triceracop, the Viking valkyries, and a [[tyrannosaurus]] hack into the timeline and kill the rest of the Nazi army while the tyrannosaurus squares off against Hitler's robotic ''[[Reichsadler]]''. After being revived by Hackerman, Kung Fury gives Hitler an uppercut to the testicle before Thor drops his hammer on the Nazi leader and his robotic eagle. Seeing his mission as accomplished, Kung Fury returns to his timeline.\n\nBack in 1985 Miami, Kung Fury once again battles and defeats the arcade machine robot, but notices a [[Swastika]] on the robot's body while Hitler and his ''Reichsadler'' enter the timeline, vowing revenge on Kung Fury.\n\n==Cast==\n* David Sandberg as Kung Fury, a Miami detective who possesses a new and powerful form of [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] after being struck by lightning and bitten by a cobra, thus becoming \"The Chosen One\" as foretold by an ancient prophecy\n* [[Jorma Taccone]] as [[Adolf Hitler]], a.k.a. \"Kung F\u00fchrer\", who aims to become the greatest martial artist by traveling through time to kill \"The Chosen One\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vk.se/1438152/han-spelar-hitler-i-kung-fury |title=Han spelar Hitler i Kung Fury |publisher=[[V\u00e4sterbottens-Kuriren]] |date=5 May 2015 |access-date=5 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505021317/http://www.vk.se/1438152/han-spelar-hitler-i-kung-fury |archive-date=5 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Steven Chew as Dragon, Kung Fury's partner who is killed by a red ninja\n* Leopold Nilsson as Hackerman, a computer whiz who can transform into a Hackerbot\n* [[Andreas Cahling]] as [[Thor]] (voiced by Per-Henrik Arvidius), the Norse god of thunder\n* Erik Hornqvist as Triceracop (voiced by Frank Sanderson), a half-man, half-[[Triceratops]] cop who is assigned as Kung Fury's new partner\n* Per-Henrik Arvidius as Chief\n* Eleni Young as Barbarianna, a Viking warrior who rides a giant wolf and wields a [[Minigun]]\n* Helene Ahlson as Katana (voiced by Yasmina Suhonen), a Viking warrior who rides a talking [[Tyrannosaurus]] and uses an [[Uzi]]\n* Eos Karlsson as the Red Ninja\n* [[Magnus Betn\u00e9r]] as Colonel Reichstache\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Gustafsson]] as Private Lahmstache\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as Hoff 9000 (voice)\n* Frank Sanderson as Cobra (voice), Kung Fury's spirit animal; and Dinomite (voice), Katana's pet Tyrannosaurus\n\n==Production==\n[[File:SDCC 2015 - David Sandberg (19408262509).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.22|Director David Sandberg dressed as Kung Fury at the 2015 [[Comic-Con International]].]]\n\nDavid Sandberg is a Swedish filmmaker who had previously directed [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] and [[music videos]]. In 2012, he quit the commercial directing business and focused on writing a script for an action comedy film set in the 1980s, inspired by action films of that era. He initially spent US$5,000 on producing and shooting footage with his friends, which became the trailer.<ref name=\"Kickstarter\" />\n\nIn December 2013, Sandberg released the trailer and began a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to [[Crowdfunding|crowdfund]] the film's production with the goal of raising US$200,000 to produce a 30-minute version of the film and stream it online for free. A second goal was added with the target set to $1 million to rewrite the story into a full-length feature and a possible distribution deal.

As he could only afford one police uniform during the production of the trailer, he filmed the police precinct scene by shooting each extra separately and [[compositing]] them in the scene. The single-shot scene where Kung Fury dispatches dozens of Nazi soldiers was achieved by combining the primary take of Sandberg's moves with over 60 takes of individual extras attacking him.<ref name=\"Kickstarter\" />\n\nOn 30 July 2014, Sandberg announced that he and his crew had begun filming new footage, with the 30 backers who pledged to be in the film as extras.

One instance of this effect is in the scene where the Viking Babe Katana summons Thor. The scene was in the trailer with Joanna H\u00e4ggblom originally as Katana, but because H\u00e4ggblom was replaced by Helene Ahlson for the actual film, visual scratches and distortion effects were added to the scene to mask the cast change.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Kung Fury (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack score was composed by Swedish [[synthwave]] musicians [[Mitch Murder]] and Lost Years,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://futurecityrecords.com/kung-fury-gets-crazy/ |title=''Kung Fury'': Beyond Awesome |publisher=Future City Records |date=29 December 2013 |access-date=18 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418152339/http://futurecityrecords.com/kung-fury-gets-crazy/ |archive-date=18 April 2015}}</ref> with additional music by Patrik \u00d6berg, Christoffer Ling, [[Highway Superstar]], and Betamaxx.
