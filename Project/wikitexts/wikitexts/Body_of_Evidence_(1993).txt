In Japan, Madonna's other 1993 film ''[[Dangerous Game (1993 film)|Dangerous Game]]'' was released there as ''Body II'' even though the films have nothing in common nor are related to each other in narrative.\n\n==Plot==\nThe elderly and wealthy Andrew Marsh dies from complications stemming from an erotic incident involving bondage and homemade pornography. The main suspect is his lover Rebecca Carlson (Madonna) who proclaims her innocence to lawyer Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe). Initially believing her, Dulaney agrees to represent her.\n\n[[District Attorney]] Robert Garrett seeks to prove that Carlson deliberately killed Marsh in bed to receive the $8 million he left her in his [[will and testament|will]]. As the trial begins, Carlson and Dulaney enter a [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] sexual relationship behind the back of Dulaney's unsuspecting wife, Sharon (Julianne Moore).\n\nDuring their first sexual encounter, Carlson secures Dulaney\u2019s arms behind his back using his own belt and alternatively pours hot wax and champagne on him before having sex.\n\nAfter an ex-lover of Carlson\u2019s testifies that he both changed his will to favour her and that she engaged in similar risky sexual behaviour with him, Dulaney attempts to end their affair.\n\nSharon, Dulaney\u2019s wife, confronts him about the affair having figured it out from a phone call with Carlson as well as the strange marks on his body from the hot wax. Dulaney goes to Carlson's home and accuses her of telling his wife about them (although Sharon says she worked it out from her tone alone). When Dulaney accidentally knocks her to the ground, Carlson begins to masturbate on the floor in front of him. Carlson pulls out handcuffs, Dulaney forcibly cuffs her hands instead and sexually assaults her. Initially she resists before appearing to enjoy the assault.\n\nFootage from Marsh\u2019s home video reveals that he had an affair with his secretary, Joanne Braslow, who is a key witness against Carlson. He also had previously left Braslow more money in his will before beginning his relationship with Carlson. She says that she was hurt but she loved him and would never hurt him. However, there is evidence that she bought the murder weapon. Carlson suggests to Dulaney that the secretary tried to frame her, but he is now less sure of her innocence in the crime.\n\nCarlson takes the stand and her surprising testimony that Marsh had an affair with another man convinces the jury, which [[acquittal|acquits]] her. Before leaving court, she mockingly thanks Dulaney indicating that she may be guilty after all.\n\nDulaney visits Carlson's home and overhears an incriminating conversation between her and Marsh's doctor, Alan Paley. He confronts the co-conspirators, realizing that it was Paley who supplied the fatal dose of cocaine. Carlson is unconcerned about his discovery, but Paley is upset to find out that she was sleeping with Dulaney as well. Paley realizes she does not care about him and becomes enraged when she tells him she has already forgotten him.\n\nAfter a struggle with Dulaney who tries to save Carlson, Paley shoots her twice. She plunges from a window to her death. Paley is arrested for murdering her.\n\nBefore leaving the scene with his wife to repair their relationship, Dulaney then tells Garret he should've won the case with Garrett replying: \"I did\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Madonna]] as Rebecca Carlson \n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Frank Dulaney\n* [[Joe Mantegna]] as Robert Garrett\n* [[Anne Archer]] as Joanne Braslow\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Sharon Dulaney\n* [[Stan Shaw]] as Charles Briggs\n* [[Charles Hallahan]] as Dr. McCurdy\n* [[Lillian Lehman]] as Judge Mabel Burnham\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Detective Reese\n* [[Jeff Perry (American actor)|Jeff Perry]] as Gabe\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Detective Griffin\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Dr. Alan Paley\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Jeffrey Roston\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Body of Evidence'' was filmed in [[Portland, Oregon]], with the [[Pittock Mansion]] serving as a primary location.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Portland Mercury]]|last=Sullivan|first=Marissa|url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/Feature/2015/10/14/16698395/body-of-evidence-boobs-bondage-and-the-pittock-mansion|date=October 14, 2015|title=Body of Evidence: Boobs, bondage, and the Pittock Mansion|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-date=August 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220819035526/https://www.portlandmercury.com/Feature/2015/10/14/16698395/body-of-evidence-boobs-bondage-and-the-pittock-mansion|access-date=August 19, 2022}}</ref> The cemetery scene featured in the beginning of the film was shot on location at [[Lone Fir Cemetery (Portland, Oregon)|Lone Fir Cemetery]].{{sfn|Bergen|Davis|2021|p=13}}\n\n[[Julianne Moore]] said her nude scene in this movie was \"just awful\": \"I was too young to know better.
