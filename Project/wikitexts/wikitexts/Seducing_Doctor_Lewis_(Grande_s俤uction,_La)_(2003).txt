Retrieved 03-06-2005.</ref> The script was written by [[Ken Scott (writer)|Ken Scott]]. It won the Audience Award at 2004 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Starring in the movie are [[Raymond Bouchard]], [[Beno\u00eet Bri\u00e8re]], [[David Boutin (actor)|David Boutin]] and [[Lucie Laurier]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe small fishing village Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne on the north coast of Quebec is in decline. Every resident collects welfare. To lure a company into building a plastic container factory nearby, they need to double their population of 120, have a resident doctor, and give a $50,000 bribe for the company owner.\n\nMontreal plastic surgeon Dr. Christopher Lewis (David Boutin) gets pulled over for speeding by an officer, R\u00e9al Fournier (Jean-Pierre Gonthier), the former mayor of Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne who moved to the city because he, like most of the residents of Ste-Marie, couldn't get a job there. After finding cocaine on Dr. Lewis, Fournier agrees not arrest him for drug possession if Dr. Lewis will visit Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne for one month. In a deleted scene, Dr. Lewis sells cocaine to his patients.\n\nGermain Lesage (Raymond Bouchard), a welfare recipient himself and the new mayor, hatches a plan. The entire village will convince Dr. Lewis to stay. They tap his phone, and pretend to share his likes: cricket, fusion jazz, and all the same foods. Henri Giroux (Beno\u00eet Bri\u00e8re), the local banker whose sole job is to cash the townfolks' welfare cheques, leaves small amounts of money for Dr. Lewis to find as small measures to increase Dr. Lewis' happiness about being in town, and attempts to secure a loan through his bank for the bribe. Dr. Lewis likes the beautiful post office worker \u00c8ve Beauchemin (Lucie Laurier), but \u00c8ve knows he has a girlfriend, Brigitte, in Montreal.\n\nThe ruse works, but they cannot secure a loan. Henri fronts the money from his personal savings, after a bank executive tells him that he has a job only as a favour to his father, and that his position could easily be replaced by an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. When the plastics company owner arrives, everyone continues their elaborate trick, and convinces him to build the factory there. The owner is ready to sign, but insists that they must have a doctor.\n\nWhen Dr. Lewis learns that Brigitte has been having an affair with his best friend Paul for three years, he proclaims that he will stay because everyone in the village is genuine. Germain feels bad for lying, and \"lets him off the hook\" by telling him another lie in that they have secured another person as a permanent doctor. Hurt, Dr. Lewis turns to \u00c8ve, who has disliked all the lying, and confesses all to him, including the phone tap. Dr. Lewis confronts Germain about the lies, with Germain confirming the accusations. When Dr. Lewis asks him if he will learn the game of cricket for real if he decides to stay, Germain replies \"no\". It is then that Dr. Lewis decides to stay. The factory is built, Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne is saved, everyone gains renewed pride, and Dr. Lewis has five years in which to woo \u00c8ve.\n\n==Production==\nProducer Roger Frappier wanted to film ''Seducing Doctor Lewis'' in Newfoundland but the film was eventually shot on an island with a population of about 300, [[Harrington Harbour, Quebec|Harrington Harbour]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Quebec film La Grande Seduction gets triple remake|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/quebec-film-la-grande-seduction-gets-triple-remake-1.1070646|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=December 28, 2013|date=June 21, 2011}}</ref> The film's [[Film producer|producers]] felt the island looked too pretty to fill the role of a fishing village experiencing hard times, so they worsened its appearance in the movie.\n\n==Awards==\n*'''Winner''' - Sundance Film Festival: World Cinema Audience Award<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sundance.org/festival/press_industry/pdf/Sundance%20Film%20Festival%20Awards%201985-2007.pdf |title=SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL FILMS HONORED 1985-2007 |publisher=Sundance Institute |accessdate=17 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033453/http://www.sundance.org/festival/press_industry/pdf/Sundance%20Film%20Festival%20Awards%201985-2007.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}</ref> [[Genie Award]] \u2013 Cinematography; [[Prix Jutra]] \u2013 Supporting Actor ([[Pierre Collin]]), Supporting Actress (Desrochers), Editing, Cinematography, Art Director, Sound and Costumes.\n\n==Remakes==\n{{main|The Grand Seduction}}\nAn English language remake titled ''[[The Grand Seduction]]'' was released in 2013, starring [[Taylor Kitsch]] as Dr Lewis with [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Mary Walsh (actress)|Mary Walsh]], [[Cathy Jones]], and [[Gordon Pinsent]] as town folks.<ref name=EngRemake>{{cite web|title=English remake|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/taylor%20kitsch-brendan-gleeson-grand-seduction-355841|accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref> The story's setting was moved to [[Newfoundland]].\n\nA [[France|French]] remake ''Un village presque parfait'' ([[English language|English]]: ''An almost perfect village'') produced by St\u00e9phane Meunier, was released in 2015.
