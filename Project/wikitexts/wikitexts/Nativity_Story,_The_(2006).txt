The remainder of the film portrays the [[annunciation]] and birth of [[Jesus]] Christ to explain why King [[Herod the Great]] ([[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]]) ordered the murder.\n\nOne year before the massacre, [[Zechariah (New Testament figure)|Zechariah]] ([[Stanley Townsend]]), a [[kohen|rabbi]] in Jerusalem, is making an offering, when he is told in a vision by the Archangel [[Gabriel]] ([[Alexander Siddig]]) that his wife, [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]] ([[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]), will bear a son. Zechariah does not believe him, stating that he is too old, and Gabriel tells him that he will be unable to speak until the boy is born. In [[Nazareth]], 16 to 17-year-old [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] ([[Keisha Castle-Hughes]]) is farming when soldiers come to collect taxes. One man, unable to pay, has a third of his land seized and his daughter pressed into [[Debt bondage|debt slavery]]. Mary, [[erusin|betrothed]] to marry 32-year-old [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] of Judaea ([[Oscar Isaac]]), is visited by Archangel Gabriel and told that she will become pregnant with God's son, whom she is to name \"Jesus\". He tells her that God has blessed her cousin Elizabeth with a child despite her old age. Mary visits her before the harvest, where she witnesses the birth of [[John the Baptist]] to Elizabeth and Zechariah, who regains his speech. Mary returns from the visit pregnant, to the shock of Joseph and her parents, who fear that Joseph will accuse her of adultery, a [[sin]] punishable by death by [[stoning]] according to the [[Torah]]. At first Joseph does not believe Mary's religious explanation, but decides not to accuse her. Still shocked and angry, he is later visited in a dream by the Archangel Gabriel, who tells him of God's plan for Mary's son. Finally believing, he is ashamed of his earlier doubts.\n\nMeanwhile, Roman emperor Caesar [[Augustus]] has demanded that every man across the [[Roman Empire]] return with his family to his place of birth for the [[census]]. A direct descendant of King [[David]], Joseph is forced to travel {{convert|110|km|sp=us}} across Judea's rocky terrain from Nazareth to [[Bethlehem]], the place of his birth. With Mary on a donkey laden with supplies, it takes the couple nearly four weeks to reach Bethlehem. Upon arriving in town, Mary goes into labour, and Joseph frantically seeks a place for her to deliver. There is, however, no room in any inn or home because of the crowds arriving for the census, but at the last minute an innkeeper offers his stable for shelter.\n\nMeanwhile, three Magi\u2014[[Biblical Magi|Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar]] ([[Stefan Kalipha]], [[Nadim Sawalha]] and [[Eriq Ebouaney]]) \u2014travel towards Judaea after having previously discovered that three planets will align to form a great star. This [[Star of Bethlehem]] appears before the Magi, after a visit by the Archangel Gabriel. The Magi visit Herod and reveal to him that the [[Messiah]] is still a child and he will be a Messiah \"for the lowest of men to the highest of kings.\" Shocked by this, Herod asks that they visit the newborn Messiah and report the child's location back to him, under the pretence that he, too, would like to worship him, while in fact he plans to kill the baby for fear of a new king taking his throne. The Magi arrive at the stable where Mary is giving birth to Jesus, and they present the Infant with gifts of gold, [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]].\n\nSuspicious of his intentions, the Magi avoid Herod, returning home via a different route. Herod realises that the Magi have tricked him and orders the death of every boy in Bethlehem under the age of two. Joseph is warned in a dream of the danger and [[Flight into Egypt|flees to Egypt]] with Mary and Jesus as the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]\n* [[Keisha Castle-Hughes]] as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]\n* [[Hiam Abbass]] as [[Saint Anne|Anna]]\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as [[Joachim]]\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] as [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]\n* [[Stanley Townsend]] as [[Zechariah (New Testament figure)|Zechariah]]\n* [[Alexander Siddig]] as the Angel [[Gabriel]]\n* [[Eriq Ebouaney]] as [[Balthazar (magus)|Balthasar]]\n* [[Alessandro Giuggioli]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Nadim Sawalha]] as [[Melchior (magus)|Melchior]]\n* [[Stefan Kalipha]] as [[Caspar (magus)|Saint Caspar]]\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Matera]] and [[Craco]], [[Italy]], and [[Ouarzazate]], [[Morocco]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Strain|first=Arthur|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6213440.stm|title=Star shines in Herod nativity role |website=BBC news|date=6 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bensalhia|first=John|url=https://www.italymagazine.com/featured-story/basilicata-blockbusters-what-watch-visiting|title=Basilicata Blockbusters: What To Watch Before Visiting|website=Italy Magazine|date=28 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Nativity Story'' opened to a modest first weekend at the domestic [[box office]] by grossing $7.8 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2006&wknd=48&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 1-3, 2006|work=[[IMDb]]|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref> with a 39% increase over the extended Christmas weekend.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nativity Story (2006) \u2013 Weekend Box Office Results|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=nativity.htm|work=[[IMDb]]|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref> After its initial run, the film closed out with about $37.6 million in domestic gross and $8.8 million in foreign gross, resulting in a worldwide total of almost $46.4 million on a reported $35 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web|title=The Nativity Story (2006)|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=nativity.htm|work=[[IMDb]]|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Nativity Story'' received mixed reviews. {{As of|2020|06}}, the film holds a 37% approval rating on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 131 reviews with an average rating of 5.29/10.
