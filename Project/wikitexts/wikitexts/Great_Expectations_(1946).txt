The supporting cast included [[Bernard Miles]], [[Francis L. Sullivan]], [[Anthony Wager]], [[Jean Simmons]], [[Finlay Currie]], [[Martita Hunt]] and [[Alec Guinness]].\n\nThe script is based on a slimmed-down version of Dickens' novel. It was written by David Lean, [[Anthony Havelock-Allan]], [[Cecil McGivern]], [[Ronald Neame]] and [[Kay Walsh]], after Lean had seen an abridged 1939 stage version of the novel, written by Alec Guinness.<ref name=Brownlow1996>{{cite book |first=Kevin |last=Brownlow |title=David Lean: A Biography |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312145781/page/206 206] |year=1996 |publisher=St Martin's Press |isbn=978-0312145781 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780312145781/page/206 }}</ref> In the stage version, Guinness had played [[Herbert Pocket]] while Martita Hunt played [[Miss Havisham]], roles that they reprised for the film. However, the film was not a strict adaptation of the play. The film was produced by Ronald Neame and photographed by [[Guy Green (filmmaker)|Guy Green]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/7839072/Ronald-Neame.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=Obituaries: Ronald Neame |date=18 June 2010}}</ref> It was the first of two films Lean directed based on Dickens' novels, the other being his 1948 adaptation of ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]''.\n\n[[John Bryan (art director)|John Bryan]] and [[Wilfred Shingleton]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction, Black-and-White]], while [[Guy Green (filmmaker)|Guy Green]] won for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography, Black-and-White]]. The film was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], as well as [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay Adaptation]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. The film is now regarded as one of Lean's best; in 1999, on the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]] list, ''Great Expectations'' was named the 5th greatest British film of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nOrphan Phillip \"Pip\" Pirrip lives with his shrewish older sister and her kindhearted blacksmith husband, Joe Gargery. While visiting his parents' graves alone, Pip encounters an escaped convict, Abel Magwitch, who intimidates the boy into returning the next day with blacksmith's tools to remove his chains. Pip also brings some food. Famished, Magwitch devours the food and thanks him. Magwitch is caught when he attacks a hated fellow escapee rather than fleeing.\n\n[[Miss Havisham]], a rich, eccentric spinster, arranges to have Pip come to her mansion regularly to provide her with company and to play with her adopted daughter, beautiful but cruel teenager [[Estella Havisham|Estella]]. Estella mocks Pip's coarse manners at every opportunity, but Pip quickly falls in love with her. He also meets a boy, Herbert Pocket, whom he beats in an impromptu boxing match. The visits come to an end when Pip turns 14 and begins his apprenticeship as a blacksmith. Estella also leaves, for France, to learn the ways of a lady.\n\nSix years later, Miss Havisham's lawyer Mr Jaggers visits Pip to tell him a mysterious benefactor has offered to transform him into a gentleman with \"great expectations\"; Pip assumes it is Miss Havisham. He is taken to London and stays with Herbert Pocket, who is to teach him how to behave like a gentleman. From Herbert, Pip learns that Miss Havisham was left at the altar many years ago and that she is determined to avenge herself against men, with Estella as her instrument to break men's hearts.\n\nWhen Pip turns 21, Joe Gargery brings a request from Miss Havisham to visit her. There Pip is reunited with Estella, who tells him, \"You must know, Pip, I have no heart.\" She confesses to Pip that, despite flirting with the wealthy but unpopular Bentley Drummle, she has absolutely no feelings for him.\n\nBack in London, Pip receives an unexpected visitor: Magwitch, who escaped from prison again and made a fortune sheep-farming in New South Wales, Australia. Magwitch reveals that he is Pip's benefactor, and that he was so touched by Pip's kindness, he resolved to prosper so Pip could live a gentleman's life. He tells the \"dear boy\" that he considers him his son.\n\nGrowing suspicious of Drummle's overtures towards Estella, Pip visits Estella. She tells him she is going to marry Drummle. Pip confronts Miss Havisham, saying, \"I am as unhappy as you could have ever meant me to be.\" Miss Havisham begs his forgiveness. Pip leaves, but when she stands to follow him, a piece of flaming wood from the fireplace rolls out and ignites her dress. Her screams alert Pip, who runs back to save her, but fails.\n\nAfter being warned that an old enemy has learned that Magwitch is in London, Pip and Herbert plot to smuggle the old man onto a [[packet ship]] leaving England, on which Pip is to accompany him. They row out to the ship, but are intercepted by waiting police, tipped off by Magwitch's old enemy. Magwitch is injured in a struggle, but his nemesis is pushed down to his death by the ship's paddlewheels. Magwitch is captured and sentenced to death.\n\nMagwitch had spoken to Pip of his lost daughter, and Pip's suspicion that she is Estella is confirmed by Jaggers. Pip visits Magwitch, now dying in prison, and tells him of her fate and that he, Pip, is in love with her. Magwitch dies a contented man.\n\nStricken by illness and with his expectations gone, Pip is taken home and nursed back to health by Joe Gargery. He revisits Miss Havisham's deserted house, where he finds Estella. Drummle broke off their engagement when Jaggers informed him of her parentage. Learning that Estella plans to live in seclusion in the house, which she has inherited, Pip tears down the curtains and opens the boarded-up windows. Sunlight reveals cobwebs, dust and decay. Pip tells Estella that he has never stopped loving her. After hesitating, she embraces him and they leave the house together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[John Mills]] as [[Pip (Great Expectations)|Pip]] as an adult\n* [[Anthony Wager]] as Pip as a boy\n* [[Valerie Hobson]] as [[Estella Havisham|Estella]] as an adult\n* [[Jean Simmons]] as Estella as a girl.

The production reproduced Restoration House in [[Denham Film Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nDickens based Joe Gargery's house on the forge in the village of [[Chalk, Kent|Chalk]], near [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]] \u2013 a replica was erected on St Mary's Marshes on the [[Isle of Grain]] on the [[Thames Estuary]].<ref name=Brownlow1996 />{{rp|212}} Pip and Herbert Pocket arrange to meet Magwitch and help him escape at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham Docks]] where slip 8 was used for the scene as well as exterior shots of the prison hulk ships.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The [[River Medway]] and the adjacent St Mary's Marshes appear in scenes where Pip and his friend, Herbert Pocket, row their boat to a small inn whilst waiting for the [[paddle steamer]] to arrive. The ship used in the film was called ''Empress'', dating from the latter half of the nineteenth century and owned by [[Cosens & Co Ltd]] of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]]. She was brought down to the River Medway for the shoot.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1946/02/great-expectations-1946/|title=Kent Film Office Great Expectations Film Focus}}</ref> \"New masts were stepped-in with square rigging and dummy sails, the funnel was lengthened and the paddle-boxes enlarged until it looked exactly right.\"<ref name=Brownlow1996 />{{rp|224}}\n\nThe company was based at Rochester, and stayed for six weeks at the Royal Victoria and Bull Hotel \u2013 the ''Blue Boar'' in Dickens' novel. The unit for the location work for the film was based on a derelict [[Fort Darnet|naval fort on Darnett Ness Island]] in the River Medway.<ref>Picturegoer,  14 September 1946</ref>\n\n==Development of the script==\nThe script is a slimmed-down version of Dickens' novel. It was inspired after David Lean witnessed an abridged 1939 stage version of the novel,<ref name=Brownlow1996 /> by Alec Guinness. Guinness had played Herbert Pocket, and Martita Hunt was Miss Havisham in the stage version of 1939. The script for the film was written by David Lean, [[Anthony Havelock-Allan]], [[Cecil McGivern]], [[Ronald Neame]] and [[Kay Walsh]].\n\nDavid Lean approached [[Clemence Dane]] to write the script, but considered what she wrote \"so awful [-] It was hideously embarrassing\" \u2013 that he decided he and Ronald Neame should write their own versions. In January 1945 they went to the ''Ferry Boat Inn'' at [[Fowey]] in Cornwall and wrote a continuity. When Lean worked on ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' Neame worked on the script with Havelock-Allan, and later with Cecil McGivern. Kay Walsh was another writer given a screen credit and wrote the ending.\n\n==Production notes==\nAlec Guinness admired the way Lean directed him, singling out a close-up in which he had to laugh out loud, and which he struggled to make look un-manufactured. Lean told him to forget about the whole thing, sat by his side, and made a little signal to the camera to start turning in the course of the conversation. He said something which made Guinness laugh and then said, \"Cut\". Guinness: \"So he got this shot on a totally false premise... but thank God. I don't think I would have ever achieved it otherwise\". Valerie Hobson however called the experience of working with Lean on the film \"the unhappiest\" and called him \"a cold director \u2013 he gave me nothing at all as an actress\".<ref name=Brownlow1996 />{{rp|207, 219}}\n\nAt the end of the film, a shot of Valerie Hobson staring into a mirror was taking longer than anticipated and was suspended \u2013 it was lunchtime \u2013 and returned to in the afternoon. Later, some three months after the film had been on exhibition, a cinema-goer asked what was meant by a [[Kilroy was here#Chad|Chad]] being reflected in the mirror.  It seems that a worker on the film had drawn it on the wall during the break in filming, and it is dimly visible in the final scene behind John Mills' shoulder as he says \"I've never ceased to love you when there seemed no hope in my love\".<ref name=Brownlow1996 />{{rp|220}}\n\nThe musical score is credited to [[Walter Goehr]], known primarily as a conductor, but significant portions were actually written by Kenneth Pakeman.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical===\nThe film won critical praise on first release, with many commentators hailing it as the finest film yet made from a Dickens novel. [[Dilys Powell]], writing for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', was \"grateful for cinema which includes so much of Dickens, which constructs its narrative from the original material with scarcely an intrusion\" and Richard Winnington, in the ''[[News Chronicle]]'', wrote that \"Dickens has never before been rendered effectively into cinema terms\". [[Gavin Lambert]] however, writing for the short-lived, but influential ''[[Sequence (journal)|Sequence]]'' magazine, felt \"that it is not so much an attempt to recreate Dickens on the screen, as a very graceful evasion of most of the issues\". In America [[James Agee]] praised the film \u2013 \"almost never less than graceful, tasteful and intelligent\".<ref name=\"McFarlane2014\">{{cite book |first=Brian |last=McFarlane |title=Screen Adaptations: Great Expectations: A close study of the relationship between text and film |date=26 September 2014 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4081-4902-7|pages=166\u2013172}}</ref>\n\nA 1999 review in the US by Roger Ebert noted the film as \"the greatest of all the Dickens films\" and added that \"The movie was made by Lean at the top of his early form\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-great-expectations-1946 |title=Great Movie: Great Expectations |date=22 August 1999 |work=Roger Ebert Reviews |access-date=2 December 2018 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIt was also the third most popular film at the British box office in 1947<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27893195 |title=Anna Neagle Most Popular Actress. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 January 1948 |access-date=24 April 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and most popular movie at the Canadian box office in 1948.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26631567 |title=FILM NEWS |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tasmania |date=11 June 1949 |access-date=4 March 2013 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Screen_Volume_32_Issue_3/page/n17|magazine=Screen|page=258|volume=32|issue=3|title=The popular cash and culture in the postwar British cinema industry|first=Janet|last=Thumim}}</ref> According to ''Kinematograph Weekly'' the 'biggest winner' at the box office in 1947 Britain was ''The Courtneys of Curzon Street'', with \"runners up\" being ''The Jolson Story'', ''Great Expectations'', ''Odd Man Out'', ''Frieda'', ''Holiday Camp'' and ''Duel in the Sun''.<ref>{{cite book|page=232|title=Blackout : reinventing women for wartime British cinema|last=Lant|first= Antonia|year=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}</ref>\n\nThe film's critical status has generally stayed high. [[Kevin Brownlow]], a biographer of Lean, wrote that \"Dickens' brilliance at creating characters was matched by [[Cineguild Productions|Cineguild]]'s choice of actors\", and Alain Silver and James Ursini have drawn attention to the film's \"overall narrative subjectivity\", finding Lean \"more than faithful to the original's first person style\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Silver |first1=Alain |last2=Ursini |first2=James |title=David Lean and His films |year=1992 |publisher=Silman-James Press |isbn=978-1879505001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, it came fifth in a [[BFI Top 100 British films|BFI poll of the top 100 British films]], while in 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' named it the fourteenth greatest British film of all time.
