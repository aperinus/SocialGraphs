He rejects most of modern technology and carries no identification, such as a [[driver's license]] or [[Conscription|draft card]]. He cannot even provide the authorities with a home address because he just sleeps wherever he finds a place.\n\nAs Burns crosses a highway into a town in [[New Mexico]], his horse Whiskey has a difficult time crossing the road, confused and scared by the traffic. They enter town to visit Jerry. She is the wife of an old friend, Paul Bondi, who has been jailed for giving aid to illegal immigrants. Jack explains his dislike for a society that restricts a man on where he can or can't go, what he can or can't do.\n\nTo break Bondi out of jail, Burns decides he himself needs to get arrested. After a violent barroom fight against a one-armed man, in which he is forced to use only one arm himself, Burns is arrested. When the police decide to let him go, he deliberately punches a cop to get himself re-arrested. He is now facing a probable sentence of a year in jail, which allows him to see Bondi, with the aim of helping him escape. The town is in a sleepy border area and the cops are mostly bored, occasionally dealing with minor offenses. The Sheriff, Morey Johnson, has to compel them to pay attention to their duties at times.\n\nJoining Bondi in jail, Burns tries to persuade him to escape. He tells Bondi he couldn't spend a year locked up because he'd probably kill someone. Burns defends Bondi from the attention of sadistic Deputy Sheriff Gutierrez, who picks Burns as his next target. During the night the inmates saw through one of the jail's bars using two hacksaw blades Burns had hidden in one of his boots. The deputy summons Burns in the middle of the night and beats him. On returning to his cell Burns tries to persuade Bondi to join him in escaping. Bondi has accepted his two-year sentence knowing he has a family waiting and has too much at stake to become a fugitive from the law. He therefore decides to remain, and Burns breaks out by himself, returning to Bondi's house, where he picks up his horse and some food from Bondi's wife. After the jail break the Sheriff learns that Burns served in the military during the [[Korean War]], including seven months in a disciplinary training center for striking a superior officer. He also received a [[Purple Heart]] and a [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] with oak leaf clusters for his valour during battle.\n\nBurns heads for the mountains on horseback with the goal of crossing the border into [[Mexico]]. The police mount an extensive search, with Sheriff Johnson and his Deputy Sheriff Harry following him in a [[jeep]]. A military helicopter is brought in, and when the aircrew locates Burns they relay his location to the sheriff. Whiskey is repeatedly spooked by the helicopter, so Burns shoots the tail rotor, damaging it and causing the pilot to lose control and crash land.\n\nDeputy Gutierrez also chases Burns. He sees the horse and is preparing to shoot when Burns sneaks up, knocking him unconscious with his rifle butt. Burns leads his horse up impossibly difficult, rocky slopes to escape his pursuers, but the lawmen keep on his trail, forcing him to keep moving. Surrounded on three sides, Burns' horse refuses at first to climb a steep slope. They finally surmount the crest of the [[Sandia Mountains]] and escape into the east side of the mountains, a broad stand of heavy timber, with the lawmen shooting at him. The Sheriff acknowledges that Burns has evaded their attempts to capture him. Burns is shot through the ankle during his dash to the timber.\n\nBurns tries to cross Highway 66 in [[Tijeras Canyon]] during a heavy rainstorm on Whiskey but the horse gets spooked by the traffic and blinded by the lights. A truck driver strikes Burns and Whiskey as they are attempting to cross the road. The sheriff arrives and, asked by the state police if Burns is the man he has been looking for, says he can't confidently identify him, because he's never seen the man he is looking for up close. Both seriously wounded, Burns is taken away in an ambulance and Whiskey is humanely destroyed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Kirk Douglas]] as John W. \"Jack\" Burns\n*[[Gena Rowlands]] as Jerry Bondi\n*[[Walter Matthau]] as Sheriff Morey Johnson\n*Michael Kane as Paul Bondi\n*[[Carroll O'Connor]] as Truck Driver\n*[[William Schallert]] as Harry (Johnson's deputy)\n*[[George Kennedy]] as Gutierrez (sadistic deputy)\n*[[Karl Swenson]] as Rev.

This is what attracted me to the story&nbsp;\u2013 the difficulty of being an individual today.<ref name=tcmarticle /></blockquote>\n\nDouglas assembled the cast and crew through his production company, [[Joel Productions]], recruiting ex-blacklisted writer [[Dalton Trumbo]], who had written ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' two years before, to write the screenplay.\n\nThe movie was filmed in the area in and around [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]: the [[Sandia Mountains]], the [[Manzano Mountains]], the [[Tijeras Canyon]] and [[Kirtland Air Force Base]].<ref>IMDb [http://imdb.com/title/tt0056195/locations Filming locations]</ref>\n\nThe working title for the film was \"The Last Hero,\"<ref name=tcmover>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=81722 Overview]</ref> but the release title of the film was a matter of contention between Douglas, who wanted to call it \"The Brave Cowboy\" after the novel, and the studio. Douglas wanted the film to open in art houses and build an audience, but Universal chose to market the film as a Western, titling it \"Lonely Are the Brave\" and opening it widely without any particular support. Despite this, the film has a cult following, and is often listed as one of the best Westerns ever made.<ref name=tcmarticle />\n\nMiller directed the picture with a reverent and eloquent feeling for the landscape, complementing the story arc of a lone and principled individual tested by tragedy and the drive of his fiercely independent conscience.<ref>{{cite web|last= Levy |first= Emanuel |authorlink= Emanuel Levy |title= Lonely Are the Brave (1962) |date= 2009-07-13 |accessdate= 2016-06-22 |url= http://emanuellevy.com/review/lonely-are-the-brave-1962-4/ |website= Emanuel Levy Cinema 24/7}}</ref>\n\n''Lonely Are the Brave'' premiered in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]] on 24 May 1962.<ref name=tcmover />\n\nPresident [[John F.
