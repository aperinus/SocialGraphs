It stars [[Henry Fonda]] (who also produced the film with Reginald Rose), [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Ed Begley]], [[E. G. Marshall]], and [[Jack Warden]].\n\n''12 Angry Men'' explores many techniques of consensus-building and the difficulties encountered in the process among this group of men whose range of personalities adds to the intensity and conflict. The jury members are identified only by number; no names are revealed until an exchange of dialogue at the very end. The film forces the audience to evaluate their own self-image through observing the personalities, experiences, and actions of the jurors. The film is also notable for its almost exclusive use of one set, where all but three minutes of the film takes place.\n\nThe film was selected as the second-best courtroom drama ever (after 1962's ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'') by the [[American Film Institute]] for their [[AFI's 10 Top 10|AFI's 10 Top 10 list]].<ref name=\"AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama\">{{cite news |title=AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama |url=https://www.afi.com/afis-10-top-10/ |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date=June 17, 2008 |access-date=November 29, 2014}}</ref> It is regarded by many as [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films ever made]].

According to [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plots should not exceed 700 words. Please add nothing without first checking the wordcount. Thanks!-->\n\nIn the overheated jury room of the [[New York County Courthouse]], a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an impoverished 18-year-old accused of stabbing his abusive father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any [[reasonable doubt]], the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty; if found guilty, the defendant will receive a mandatory death sentence via the [[electric chair]]. The verdict must be unanimous.\n\nAt first, the case seems clear. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window, through the windows of a passing [[elevated train]]. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father, and the father's body hitting the ground; then, as he ran to his door, saw the defendant running down the stairs. The boy has a violent past; he had recently purchased a [[switchblade]] of the same type that was found, wiped of fingerprints, at the murder scene, but claimed he lost it.\n\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He says he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists. With his first few arguments seemingly failing to convince any of the other jurors, Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote; he respects Juror 8's motives, and agrees that there should be more discussion.\n \nJuror 8 argues that the noise of the passing train would have obscured everything the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11. Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. After looking at a diagram of the witness's apartment and conducting an experiment, the jurors determine that it is impossible the disabled witness could have made it to the door in time. Juror 3, infuriated, argues with and tries to attack Juror 8. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split.\n\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi based on the boy's inability to recall specific details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory to make a point. Jurors 2 and 5 point out the unlikelihood the boy made a stab wound angled downwards, as he was shorter than his father. Juror 7 changes his vote out of impatience rather than conviction, angering Juror 11. After another vote, Jurors 12 and 1 also change sides, leaving only three \"guilty\" votes.\n\nJuror 10 goes on a bigoted rant, causing Juror 4 to forbid him to speak for the remainder of the deliberation. When Juror 4 is pressed as to why he still maintains a guilty vote, he declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts to a guilty vote.\n\nAfter watching Juror 4 remove his glasses and rub the impressions they made on his nose, Juror 9 realizes that the first witness was constantly rubbing similar impressions on her own nose, indicating that she also was a habitual glasses wearer. He observes she also always dressed up in clothes befitting a younger woman, hence not wearing the glasses in court. Juror 8 remarks that the witness, who was trying to sleep when she saw the killing through her bedroom window, would not have had glasses on or the time to put them on, making her story questionable. Jurors 12, 10 and 4 all change their vote, leaving Juror 3 as the sole dissenter.\n\nJuror 3 vehemently and desperately tries to convince the others, until he finally reveals that his strained relationship with his own son makes him wish the defendant guilty. He breaks down in tears and changes his vote to \"not guilty\". As the others leave, Juror 8 graciously helps Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is acquitted off-screen, and the jurors leave the courthouse. Jurors 8 and 9 stop to learn each other's real names (Davis and McCardle, respectively), before parting.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:12 Angry Men (1957) - Trailer.webm|thumb|245px|thumbtime=20|The film's trailer]]\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Juror 1, the jury foreman; a calm and methodical assistant high school [[American football|football]] coach.\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Juror 2, a meek and unpretentious bank teller who is easily flustered, but eventually stands up for himself. \n* [[Lee J.

A complete [[kinescope]] of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003.

[[Sidney Lumet]], whose prior directorial credits included dramas for television productions such as ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'' and ''[[Studio One (CBS series)|Studio One]]'', was recruited by Henry Fonda and Rose to direct. ''12 Angry Men'' was Lumet's first feature film, and the only producing credit for Fonda and Rose (under the production company, Orion-Nova Productions).<ref name=Variety /> Fonda later stated that he would never again produce a film.\n\nThe film was shot in New York and completed after a short but rigorous rehearsal schedule, in less than three weeks, on a budget of $337,000 ({{Inflation|US|337000|1957|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Rose and Fonda took salary deferrals.<ref name=Variety />\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the cameras are positioned above eye level and mounted with [[wide-angle lens]]es, to give the appearance of greater depth between subjects, but as the film progresses the [[focal length]] of the lenses is gradually increased. By the end of the film, nearly everyone is shown in closeup, using [[telephoto lens]]es from a lower angle, which decreases or \"shortens\" [[depth of field]]. Lumet stated that his intention in using these techniques with cinematographer [[Boris Kaufman]] was to create a nearly palpable [[claustrophobia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html |title=Evolution of Twelve Angry Men|website=Playhouse Square |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=September 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106012115/http://www.playhousesquare.org/bbuzz/12angrymen/d-evolution.html}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Initial response ===\nOn its first release, ''12 Angry Men'' received critical acclaim.

She was particularly inspired by immigrant Juror 11's monologue on his reverence for the American justice system. She also told the audience of law students that, as a lower-court judge, she would sometimes instruct juries to not follow the film's example, because most of the jurors' conclusions are based on speculation, not fact.<ref>{{Citation| last1 = Semple | first1 = Kirk| title = The Movie That Made a Supreme Court Justice| newspaper = The New York Times| date = October 18, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/nyregion/18sonia.html| access-date =October 18, 2010}}</ref> Sotomayor noted that events such as Juror 8 entering a similar knife into the proceeding; performing outside research into the case matter in the first place; and ultimately the jury as a whole making broad, wide-ranging assumptions far beyond the scope of reasonable doubt (such as the inferences regarding the woman wearing glasses) would not be allowed in a real-life jury situation, and would in fact have yielded a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Jury_Admonitions.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528102537/http://www.nycourts.gov/cji/1-General/CJI2d.Jury_Admonitions.pdf |archive-date=2010-05-28 |url-status=live |title=Jury Admonitions In Preliminary Instructions (Revised May 5, 2009)1 |access-date=June 23, 2011}}</ref> (assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed).\n\nIn 2007, Michael Asimow argued that the jury in ''12 Angry Men'' reached an incorrect verdict, writing that the amount of [[circumstantial evidence]] against the defendant should have been enough to convict him, even if the testimony of the two eyewitnesses were disregarded.<ref name=\"Asimow 2007\" />\n\nIn 2012, Mike D'Angelo of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also questioned the verdict of the jury in the film, writing: \"What ensures The Kid's guilt for practical purposes, [...] is the sheer improbability that ''all'' the evidence is erroneous. You'd have to be the jurisprudential inverse of a national lottery winner to face so many apparently damning coincidences and misidentifications. Or you'd have to be framed, which is what [[Johnnie Cochran]] was ultimately [[O. J. Simpson murder case|forced to argue]]\u2014not just because of the [[DNA evidence]], but because there's no other plausible explanation for why every single detail points to [[O.J. Simpson]]'s guilt. But there's no reason offered in ''12 Angry Men'' for why, say, the police would be planting switchblades.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/did-12-angry-men-get-it-wrong-1798232604|title=Did 12 Angry Men get it wrong?|last=D'Angelo|first=Mike|date=August 2, 2012|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|access-date=April 24, 2022}}</ref>\n\n== Adaptations and parodies ==\nThere have been a number of adaptations. A 1963 German TV production ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen|de|3=Die zw\u00f6lf Geschworenen (1963)}}'' was directed by G\u00fcnter Gr\u00e4wert, and a 1973 Spanish production, ''Doce hombres sin piedad'', was made for TV 22 years before Spain allowed juror trials, while a 1991 homage by [[K\u014dki Mitani]], ''Juninin no Yasashii Nihonjin'' (\"12 gentle Japanese\"), posits a Japan with a jury system and features a group of Japanese people grappling with their responsibility in the face of Japanese cultural norms. A 1986 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' entitled \"[[List of Murder, She Wrote episodes#Season 2 (1985\u201386)|Trial by Error]]\" pays tribute to ''12 Angry Men''. The major twists are originally 10 jurors vote for \"not guilty\" due to self defense, Jessica votes \"unsure\" and another juror votes \"guilty\". Jessica and other jurors recall the evidence, as more and more jurors switch from \"not guilty due to self defense\" and come to a realization as to what actually occurred the night of the murder. The 1987 Indian film in [[Hindi]] language ''[[Ek Ruka Hua Faisla]]'' (\"a pending decision\") and also in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Dashamukha]]'' (\"ten faces\") are the remakes of the film, with an almost identical storyline. Russian director [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] also made a 2007 adaptation, ''[[12 (2007 film)|12]]'', featuring a Chechen teen on trial in Moscow. A 2015 Chinese adaptation, ''[[12 Citizens]]'', follows the plot of the original 1957 American movie, while including characters reflecting contemporary Beijing society, including a cab driver, guard, businessman, policeman, a retiree persecuted in a 1950s political movement, and others.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/12-citizens-shanghai-review-804416|title='12 Citizens' Shanghai Review|first1=Deborah|last1=Young|magazine=Hollywood Reporter|date=June 23, 2015|access-date=August 23, 2015}}</ref> The detective drama television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', which like the film includes the theme of class issues, featured an episode, \"[[One Angry Veronica]]\", in which the title character is selected for jury duty. The episode flips the film's format and depicts one holdout convincing the jury to ''convict'' the privileged defendants of assault against a less well-off victim, despite their lawyers initially convincing 11 jury members of a not guilty verdict.\n\nIn 1997, a television remake of the film [[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|under the same title]] was directed by [[William Friedkin]] and produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In the newer version, the judge is a woman and four of the jurors are black, but the overall plot remains intact. Modernizations include not smoking in the jury room, changes in references to pop culture figures and income, references to execution by lethal injection as opposed to the electric chair, more race-related dialogue and profanity.\n\nThe film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the [[Comedy Central]] TV series ''[[Inside Amy Schumer]]'' aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/amy-schumer-12-angry-men-pictures.html |title= Behold Inside Amy Schumer's Dead-On ''12 Angry Men''\n |last1 = Lyons | first1 = Margaret |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2015/05/06/404649955/amy-schumer-puts-her-own-looks-on-trial |title= Amy Schumer Puts Her Own Looks On Trial\n |last1 = Homes | first1 = Linda |work=[[NPR]] |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref> The BBC Television comedy ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]'', starring [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]], and written by [[Ray Galton]] and [[Alan Simpson (scriptwriter)|Alan Simpson]], was parodied in [[Twelve Angry Men (Hancock's Half Hour)|the episode]] broadcast on October 16, 1959. ''[[Family Guy]]'' paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled \"[[12 and a Half Angry Men]]\", and ''[[King of the Hill]]'' acknowledged the film with their parody \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\" in season 3.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Twelve Angry Men]]''\n* [[List of American films of 1957]]\n* [[List of films considered the best]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"12AngryMen1957film-r1\">{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-07-254/librarian-of-congress-announces-2007-film-registry/2007-12-27/|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Sidney Lumet|Lumet, Sidney]] (1995).
