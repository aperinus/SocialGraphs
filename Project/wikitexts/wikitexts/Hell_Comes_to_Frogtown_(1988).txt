Jackson]] and R. J. Kizer, and written by Jackson and [[Randall Frakes]]. The film stars [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Roddy Piper]] as well as [[Sandahl Bergman]], [[Cec Verrell]], [[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]] and [[Rory Calhoun]].\n\n==Plot==\nThis film is set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] wasteland where few fertile men and women exist due to atomic fallout. As a result, the government places a high priority on those who can still breed. Shortly before the movie opens, a group of mutant [[amphibian]]s (who have been exiled to the desert by humans) capture a group of fertile women and are using them as sex slaves.\n\nSam Hell (Piper) is a [[nomad]]ic traveler who wanders the countryside. He is first seen tied to a chair and smashed over the head with a bottle by a man whose daughter he sexually assaulted. He is eventually captured by an organization of warrior-nurses, the closest thing to a government in his region of the world, who reveal that they located him by tracking the trail of pregnant women left in his wake. Their original plan was to use him as breeding stock with their collection of fertile women, but this was the group captured by the mutants. With their own attempts to capture the women failing, the group presses Hell into service as a mercenary; he is to infiltrate the mutant city (derogatorily referred to as \"Frogtown\") and rescue the women. To make sure that the rebellious Hell follows his orders, he is forced to wear an electronic protective codpiece that will explode if he disobeys or tries to abort his mission. Having already had numerous samples of his reproductive material taken, he is now deemed far more expendable than the women themselves. To aid him in his mission (and make sure he follows the plan), he is paired with one of the nurses, Spangle (Bergman), and an aggressive guard named Centinella (Verrell).\n\nDuring their journey to Frogtown, Hell tries numerous times to escape, but quickly learns that a device Spangle carries will shock his genitals if used or if he gets too far away from it. Despite their rocky start and Spangle's initial cold demeanor, the pair grow closer during the journey and eventually fall in love. When they reach Frogtown, everyone involved is captured. The frogs' second-in-command, Bull ([[Nicholas Worth]]), tortures Hell and attempts to remove the codpiece for its technology. Meanwhile, a slightly drugged Spangle is forced to work as a slave and dance for the frogs' Commander Toty (Brian Frank) in the notable \"Dance of the Three Snakes\" sequence. Proving more successful than she had wished, the nurse soon finds herself at the mercy of the aroused commander. However, with the codpiece now removed (Bull finally removed it with a chainsaw, but it blew up and killed him), the escaped Hell rescues her along with the group of fertile women (Ellen Crocker, Kim Hewson, Ilana Ishaki, Annie McKinon and Janie Thorson) held captive.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-01-18|title=Hell Comes to Frogtown (1987)|url=https://www.moriareviews.com/sciencefiction/hell-comes-to-frogtown-1987.htm|access-date=2021-07-29|website=Moria|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Cast== \n[[File:Roddy Piper (2014-04-04 19-10-01 NEX-6 7421 DxO (13933727033)).jpg|thumb|Roddy Piper portrayed Sam Hell in the film.]]\n[[File:Sandahl Bergman on Count Gore De Vol.jpg|thumb|Sandahl Bergman on Count Gore De Vol]]\n* [[Roddy Piper]], as Sam Hell, a man who lost his daughter in the nuclear war that precedes this movie and hooks up with women very frequently after the disaster.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Irel|first=Rob|date=2020-07-31|title=Roddy Piper - From The Streets to the Big Time|url=https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/roddy-piper/|access-date=2021-07-29|website=Pro Wrestling Stories|language=en-US}}</ref> He is the main protagonist in this film and is tasked with saving a group of girls from the frog leader Toty (Brian Franks).
