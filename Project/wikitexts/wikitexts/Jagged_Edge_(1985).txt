(1992). ''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style'' (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> [[legal thriller]] written by [[Joe Eszterhas]] and directed by [[Richard Marquand]] which also marked the last film released in his lifetime. The film stars [[Glenn Close]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Peter Coyote]]<ref name=\"Maslin\"/> and [[Robert Loggia]]. A lawyer reluctantly takes the case of a man accused of killing his wife, but remains uncertain if he is guilty or not.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. Loggia was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance.<ref name=\"oscar\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nA masked intruder breaks into the beach house of [[San Francisco]] socialite Paige Forrester, ties her to her bed, rips open her shirt, and kills her with a hunting knife. Her husband Jack, arrested for her murder, tries to hire high-profile lawyer Teddy Barnes to defend him. Barnes is reluctant to take the case since an incident with district attorney Thomas Krasny, her former boss, caused her to quit practicing criminal law.\n\nKrasny tells Barnes that prisoner Henry Styles hanged himself, which distresses her. Barnes visits Sam Ransom, a private detective who also used to work for Krasny and who changed careers at the same time as Barnes. Barnes decides to take the case.\n\nBarnes and Forrester prepare for the trial and eventually sleep together. Ransom warns Barnes that Forrester is just trying to make her care more about his case. Her office begins receiving anonymous letters containing non-public case details and an analysis shows they were typed on a 1942 [[Smith Corona|Corona]] typewriter.\n\nIn a pre-trial meeting, Barnes tells the judge that Krasny has a history of not meeting [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] obligations. The prosecution's case relies on circumstantial evidence and two of its key witnesses are discredited by Barnes.\n\nKrasny calls Eileen Avery, who had an affair with Forrester, to testify. As Avery details her relationship with Forrester, Barnes finds it eerily similar to her own relationship with him. She feels manipulated and now believes Forrester is guilty but continues out of a sense of duty.\n\nAnother note arrives at her office saying, \"He is innocent. Santa Cruz. January 21, 1984. Ask Julie Jensen.\" Barnes calls Jensen to testify that she was attacked in the same manner as Paige Forrester. All the details match, but she says her attacker seemed to stop himself from killing her. As Krasny objects that the attack on Jensen is unrelated to the one on Forrester, he lets slip that his office had investigated the attack and not revealed it in discovery. In chambers, the judge threatens to have Krasny disbarred. Krasny insists that Forrester planned Paige's murder for 18 months, he attacked Jensen to create an alibi for himself, and he is the writer of the anonymous letters.\n\nThe judge forbids Krasny from presenting his theory to the jury and Forrester is found not guilty. Barnes announces to the media that she left the district attorney's office when Krasny suppressed evidence that proved Henry Styles was innocent. Krasny walks off in disgust.\n\nBarnes goes to Forrester's house to celebrate, and they sleep together again. In the morning, she discovers, in a closet, a 1942 Corona typewriter matching the analysis of the anonymous notes. She takes it and flees.\n\nWhen Forrester calls, she tells him she found the typewriter. Forrester insists on coming over. Barnes calls Ransom, on the brink of telling him that Forrester is a killer, but instead hangs up. A masked figure breaks in and confronts her in her bedroom. As he starts to attack, Barnes throws back the covers to reveal a handgun. She shoots him several times until he falls to the floor. Ransom comes in and unmasks the attacker: Forrester.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Teddy Barnes\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jack Forrester\n* [[Peter Coyote]] as Thomas Krasny\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Sam Ransom\n* [[John Dehner]] as Judge Carrigan\n* [[Karen Austin]] as Julie Jensen\n* [[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]] as Matthew Barnes\n* [[Marshall Colt]] as Bobby Slade\n* [[Louis Giambalvo]] as (Anthony) Fabrizi\n* Ben Hammer as Dr. Goldman\n* [[Lance Henriksen]] as Frank Martin\n* Sanford Jensen as Scott Talbot\n* [[James Karen]] as Andrew Hardesty\n* [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] as Virginia (Ginny) Howell\n* [[William Allen Young]] as Greg Arnold\n* [[John Clark (actor)|John Clark]] as Dr. Holloway\n* [[Michael Dorn]] as Dan Hislan\n* Diane Erickson as Eileen Avery\n}}\n\nMaria Mayenzet briefly appears, in the opening scene, as murder victim Paige Forrester.\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to [[Joe Eszterhas]], the film originated with producer [[Martin Ransohoff]], who wanted to make a courtroom drama in the vein of ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]''.

The story was about a private investigator framed for murder and the female lawyer who defends him. The project was developed at Columbia Pictures but then head of production Guy McElwaine was replaced by [[David Puttnam]], who, according to producer Martin Ransohoff, said that he did not want to make sequels (Puttnam denied this, saying his problem was the script \"wasn't good and for no other reason... when there's a terrific script for ''Jagged Edge II'' Columbia will be anxious to make it\".). Ransohoff decided to turn the script into an original story. \"It's a good mystery on its own terms,\" he said. \"I think the story is really more effective as an original. Because there wasn't an agreement with Loggia and Close, we had always designed the project to go either as a sequel or on its own terms.\"<ref>Klady, L. (August 9, 1987).
