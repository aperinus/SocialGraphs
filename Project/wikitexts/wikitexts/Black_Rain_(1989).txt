It stars [[Michael Douglas]], [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Ken Takakura]], and [[Kate Capshaw]] and features [[Y\u016bsaku Matsuda]] (in his final film role before his death that year) and [[Shigeru K\u014dyama]]. The film focuses on two NYPD officers who arrest a member of the [[Yakuza]] and must escort him back to [[Japan]]. Once there, he escapes, and the two officers find themselves dragged deeper and deeper into the Japanese underworld.\n\n''Black Rain'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on September 22, 1989. It received much publicity beforehand as it was Douglas's first film in two years and the first since his Oscar winning role in the film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]''.  Upon release, the film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics, which praised the performances, action sequences, [[Hans Zimmer]]'s musical score, direction and editing but criticized the screenwriting, clich\u00e9d story and lack of character development.  In the years since, the film has become a major [[cult film]] and has been widely praised.\n\n''Black Rain'' was also a huge box office hit with grossing over $134 million worldwide in front of a production budget of $30 million, and was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nNick Conklin is a [[New York City]] police officer facing possible criminal charges; [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] believes Nick was involved with his former partner, who was caught taking criminal money, in a [[police corruption|corruption]] scandal. Nick, who has financial difficulties, is divorced from his wife, who has custody of their two children.\n\nAt a restaurant, Nick and his current partner Charlie Vincent observe two Japanese men meeting with [[American Mafia|Mafia]] gangsters. Nick's suspicions are validated when another Japanese man, Sato, enters the restaurant, seizes a small package at gunpoint, kills two people, and leaves. Nick and Charlie chase and arrest the suspect after he nearly kills Nick. Sato is to be [[Extradition|extradited]] to [[Osaka]] and given to the police there. Though angered that he will not be prosecuted in the US, Nick agrees to escort him. Nick's captain believes it will keep Nick from causing more trouble and exacerbating the already biased Internal Affairs investigation.\n\t\nNick and Charlie fly Osaka and surrender Sato to the Japanese police, only to realize they were impostors. Nick convinces the real Osaka police to allow them to observe the investigation, though their weapons are confiscated. They are assigned to Masahiro Matsumoto. Nick [[xenophobia|behaves rudely and offends]] Matsumoto, while Charlie attempts to be more polite. Nick also makes contact with an American nightclub hostess, Joyce, who explains that he and Charlie represent American inefficiency and stupidity to the Japanese. Through her, Nick discovers Sato is fighting a gang war with a notorious crime boss, Sugai, and traveled to New York to disrupt Sugai's [[counterfeiting]] scheme.\n\nNick joins a police raid without permission and takes a few $100 bills from the crime scene. The next day, Matsumoto explains they have dishonored themselves, him, and the police force by his theft, which has been reported in America; Nick calls him a snitch and demonstrates the money is counterfeit by burning one of the bills. That night, Nick and Charlie walk back to their hotel drunk and unescorted, despite warnings about their safety. In an apparent prank, a young motorcyclist steals Charlie's coat and leads him to an underground parking garage. The motorcyclist turns out to be one of Sato's henchmen. Separated from Charlie, Nick watches in horror as Sato and several others briefly torture Charlie before Sato beheads him. Joyce comforts the distraught Nick at her apartment. Later, Matsumoto hands him Charlie's service revolver.\n\nAs Matsumoto and Nick trail one of Sato's operatives, Nick admits he stole money in New York. The operative retrieves a sample counterfeit note, which she passes to a gangster. Nick and Matsumoto tail him to a steel foundry, where they find Sato is meeting Sugai, and the package from New York is a printing plate for American $100 bills. Nick confronts Sato, who escapes when swarming police arrest Nick for waving a gun in public. Though [[deportation|deported]], Nick sneaks off the plane to pursue Sato on his own, as Matsumoto has been suspended and demoted. Joyce helps him meet Sugai, who explains that making counterfeit US currency is his revenge for the \"black rain\", or [[nuclear fallout]], after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]]. Nick suggests a deal where Sugai can use Nick to retrieve the stolen plate from Sato, leaving Sugai's reputation and hands clean.\n\nSugai drops Nick at a remote farm with a shotgun. Matsumoto arrives, and they deduce Sato plans a massacre. During a meeting with Sugai, Sato [[Yubitsume|cuts off one of his fingers]] in atonement, stabs Sugai, and escapes with the plates, prompting a gunfight between Sugai's and Sato's men. Sato escapes the fight on a dirt bike, Nick pursues, and the two fight briefly. Nick gains the advantage and, having Sato at his mercy, has the choice of whether or not to kill Sato for Charlie and all the humiliation he has suffered. Matsumoto and Nick walk a handcuffed Sato into police headquarters to the amazement of everyone and later receive commendations, which Nick accepts gratefully.\n\nBefore boarding his flight home, Nick thanks Matsumoto for his assistance and friendship, and gives him a dress shirt in a gift box. Underneath it, Matsumoto finds the counterfeit printing plates.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Detective Nick Conklin\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Detective Charlie Vincent\n* [[Ken Takakura]] as Assistant Inspector Masahiro \"Mas\" Matsumoto\n* [[Kate Capshaw]] as Joyce\n* [[Y\u016bsaku Matsuda]] as Sato Koji\n* [[Shigeru K\u014dyama]] as Chief Inspector Ohashi\n* [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as Captain Oliver\n* [[Guts Ishimatsu]] as Katayama\n* [[Yuya Uchida (singer)|Yuya Uchida]] as Nashida\n* [[Tomisaburo Wakayama]] as Sugai Kunio\n* [[Miyuki Ono]] as Miyuki\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n|Luis Guzman]] as Frankie\n* [[Stephen Root]] as IA Detective Berg\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as IA Detective Crown\n* Clem Caserta as Abolofia\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as Detective\n* [[Professor Toru Tanaka]] as Sugai's Bodyguard\n* Mak Takano as Tattooed Yakuza (uncredited)\n* [[Nathan Jung]] as Sato's Enforcer (uncredited)\n* [[Al Leong]] as Sato's Assassin (uncredited)\n* Bruce Locke as Sato's Bodyguard (uncredited)\n\nHong Kong actor [[Jackie Chan]] was originally approached to play the role of Sato, but instead turned it down as he felt audiences did not want to see him play a \"bad\" character.<ref>Logan, Bey.

Japanese actor [[Y\u016bsaku Matsuda]], who played Sato, died of [[bladder cancer]] shortly after the film's completion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/obituaries/yusaku-matsuda-39-japanese-movie-actor.html|title=Yusaku Matsuda, 39, Japanese Movie Actor|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 November 1989}}</ref> Director Ridley Scott dedicated the film to his memory.\n\nThe high cost and [[red tape]] involved in filming in Japan prompted director Scott to declare that he would never film in that country again.<ref>According to the commentary on the Criterion DVD of ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]''</ref> Scott was eventually forced to leave the country and complete the final climactic scene (which included American character actor [[Al Leong]]) in [[Napa Valley]], [[California]].\n\nThis film marks the first collaboration between [[Hans Zimmer]] and Ridley Scott. He would go on to score several more films for Scott, including ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'', ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]'', ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]],'' ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Matchstick Men (film)|Matchstick Men]]''.\n\nJapanese musician [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] contributed the song \"Laser Man\" to the film's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Rain (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Black-Rain-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/1669514|access-date=31 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\nLarge parts of ''Black Rain'' were filmed in [[Osaka]], although some of the locations have changed somewhat since the late 1980s when production took place. The original intention of Ridley Scott was to film in the [[Kabukicho]] nightlife district of [[Shinjuku, Tokyo]]. However, the Osaka authorities were more receptive towards [[film permit]]s so the similarly futuristic neon-infused [[D\u014dtonbori]] in [[Namba]] was chosen as the principal filming location in Japan.\n\nAn aerial shot of Osaka bay at sunset with the estuaries of the [[Yodo River|Yodogawa]], Kanzakigawa and Ajigawa rivers frames the opening sequence of the arrival into Japan.\n\nThe main filming location in Osaka is by the Ebisubashi bridge. The futurist [[Kirin Plaza]] building (architect [[Shin Takamatsu]], built 1987), the Ebisubashi and the famous neon wall overlooking the D\u014dtonbori canal creates the ''[[Blade Runner]]''-esque mise-en-sc\u00e8ne.\n\n[[Umeda]], Osaka's northern centre, is represented by the first floor shopping mall concourse of Hankyu Umeda station Terminal Building. Resembling a futuristic neo-gothic nave from a cathedral, this is where Charlie Vincent's (Andy Garcia) jacket is stolen by a [[bosozoku]] biker. Because the production could not finish the segment in Japan, Charlie's demise, the subsequent escalator chase and car park scenes, replete with appropriate Japanese signs, were shot in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe now removed [[Shinsaibashi]] bridge (dismantled in 1995), Osaka Municipal Central Wholesale Market, Nippon Steel Works in Sakai City (south Osaka), [[Ky\u014dbashi, Osaka|Kyobashi]], the elevated Hanshin Expressway, [[Osaka Castle]] and Nanko Port Town also feature briefly, as well as the [[Motomachi, Kobe|Motomachi]] shopping district of neighbouring [[Kobe]].\n\nIn New York City, the 1964 World Expo's Unisphere opens the film, followed by Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) riding over the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. The illegal bike race between Nick and an anonymous challenger took place from underneath the west underside of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] north to the [[Manhattan Bridge]].\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack had various artists with the [[Film score|score]] composed by [[Hans Zimmer]]. The soundtrack was originally released as a 7-track album in 1989 by [[Virgin Records|Virgin Movie Music]] on cassette, vinyl and compact disc.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/black-rain-mw0000206479 Black Rain - Original Soundtrack] | Songs, Reviews, Credits | AllMusic</ref> However, it was re-released in 2012 by La-La Land Records in limited edition as a two-disc package.<ref>[http://www.hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco&id=1099 Hans-Zimmer.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317034415/http://www.hans-zimmer.com/index.php?rub=disco&id=1099 |date=2018-03-17 }} - Black Rain ..</ref>\n{{Track listing\n| headline = ''Black Rain (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)''\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| total_length    = {{duration|m=48|s=26}}\n\n| title1          = [[Brick by Brick|Livin' on the Edge of the Night]]\n| note1           = [[Iggy Pop]]\n| writer1         =  Eric Rackin, [[Jay Rifkin]]\n| extra1          = \n| length1         = 3:40\n\n| title2          = [[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]\n| note2           = [[UB40]]\n| writer2         =  [[Bobby Rogers|Robert Rogers]], [[Smokey Robinson|William Robinson]]\n| extra2          = \n| length2         = 3:15\n\n| title3          = [[Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)|Back to Life]] (Jam On The Groove Mix)\n| note3           = [[Soul II Soul]] Featuring [[Caron Wheeler]]\n| writer3         = Beresford Romeo, Paul Hooper, Simon Law\n| extra3          = \n| length3         = 5:09\n\n| title4          = Laserman\n| note4           = [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]\n| writer4         = Sakamoto\n| extra4          =\n| length4         = 4:49\n\n| title5          = Singing in the Shower\n| note5           = [[Les Rita Mitsouko]] and [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]]\n| writer5         =  [[Ron Mael]], [[Russell Mael]]\n| extra5          = \n| length5         = 4:24\n\n| title6          = I'll Be Holding On\n| note6           = [[Gregg Allman]]\n| writer6         = [[Hans Zimmer]], [[Will Jennings]]\n| extra6          =\n| length6         = 5:40\n\n| title7          = Black Rain Suite - Sato, Charlie Loses his Head, Sugai, Nick & Masa\n| note7           = \n| writer7         = Hans Zimmer\n| extra7          = \n| length7         = 4:45, 7:03, 6:55, 2:52\n\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''Black Rain'' was released in the United States on September 22, 1989, and in the Philippines on February 1, 1990.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opens Today|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8cBNEdFwSQkC&dat=19900201&printsec=frontpage|access-date=16 January 2019|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publishing, Inc.|date=1 February 1990|page=17}}</ref> It was screened as the opening film at the 3rd [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] in October 1989 and shown as the Special Invitational Screening film.
