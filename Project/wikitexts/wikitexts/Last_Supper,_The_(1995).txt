It stars [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Ron Eldard]], [[Annabeth Gish]], [[Jonathan Penner]] and [[Courtney B. Vance]] as five [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[graduate school]] students who invite a string of [[Far-right politics|extreme]] [[Conservatism|conservatives]] to dinner in order to murder them. The film premiered at the 1995 [[Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=imdb-release />\n\n==Plot==\nThe film centers on five [[graduate school]] students in [[Iowa]] who live together in a rustic home: Jude, Pete, Paulie, Marc, and Luke.\n\nAfter Zack, a [[Desert Storm]] veteran, helps move Pete's car, the group invite him to have dinner at their home. However, Zack turns out to be a [[racism|racist]] and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] who praises [[Adolf Hitler]], leading to a tense political debate with the [[Liberalism|liberal]] students.\n\nThe evening takes a turn for the worse when the veteran snaps and holds a knife to Marc's throat, threatening to kill him and rape Paulie. Zack releases Marc, then Pete holds a knife to his throat, but he easily incapacitates Pete and breaks his arm. Marc fatally stabs Zack in the back to defend his friend, and the group decides to cover up the murder. Paulie regrets that Zack is dead even though he threatened her and Marc.\n\nAfter a long discussion led by Luke, the students decide to follow up this event by inviting other conservatives for dinner to murder them, reasoning this would \"make the world a better place\". They lay down a procedure for each murder. The guest will be given every opportunity to change his/her mind and recant his/her beliefs. If the guest fails to change his/her ways by dessert, the guest is offered poisoned white wine from a blue decanter and raises a toast. The bodies are buried in the vegetable garden.\n\nGuests include a [[homophobia|homophobic]] [[protestantism|protestant]] [[reverend]]; a misogynistic, [[Chauvinism|chauvinistic]] rape apologist; a [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]]; an [[anti-environmentalism|anti-environmentalist]]; a racist, [[anti-Semitic]] [[Nation of Islam]] [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]; an [[anti-abortion]] activist; a [[censorship]] advocate; a man who beats homeless people (the only dinner guest who momentarily considers recanting his beliefs); and [[LGBT rights opposition|critics of gay rights]], all of whom are murdered.\n\nAfter ten murders, misgivings begin to surface within the group as a few grow indecisive regarding the justification of their actions. Infighting and guilt compel them to spare a teenage opponent of mandatory [[sex education]], despite the protests of Luke and Pete.\n\nSheriff Alice Stanley, investigating the whereabouts of missing girl Jenny Tyler, comes upon the group. By coincidence, the main suspect in the case is Zack, their first victim, also a convicted [[sex offender]]. The sheriff grows suspicious of the students\u2019 behavior, questioning Pete, Marc and Paulie at their home. Finding Stanley trespassing in their back yard, Luke\u2014increasingly unhinged\u2014kills Stanley unbeknownst to the rest.\n\nDuring a school break, Luke and Pete meet famous conservative pundit Norman Arbuthnot, inviting him to dinner. (Throughout the film, brief segments of radical statements made by him had been appearing on TV.) During dinner, Norman stymies them with his moderate and persuasive arguments, all of which the usually argumentative group have difficulty debunking. He even admits that he says more radically conservative things mostly for attention.\n\nThe frustrated students all suspiciously excuse themselves to the kitchen to determine Norman's fate. Jude warns him that the wine in the blue bottle, \"It was left out too long and has gone bad.\" After a brief discussion, only Luke still wishes to kill Norman, calling him Hitler. After a tense altercation, where he aims a gun at Jude, Luke is dissuaded and breaks down into tears.\n\nMeanwhile, Norman examines the home and pieces together their murderous activities. When they return to the table, Norman presents them with glasses of wine and offers them a toast but does not drink himself, with the excuse that he has to fly his private plane. He puffs on a huge cigar and says, \"Don't worry, I didn't pour any of the bad wine.\"\n\nA closing shot of a painting portrays all five students collapsed on the floor, with Norman standing next to the blue bottle and smoking his cigar. The film ends with audio of Norman speculating about his possible presidential bid to a cheering crowd, pledging to do the people's will and describing himself as the people's \"humble, humble servant.\" In the closing voice-over, Norman explains his reluctance to accept his fans' urging to take on the responsibility of \"the highest office in the land\" by saying, \"I already have.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/last-supper-script-transcript-diaz.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107082101/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/last-supper-script-transcript-diaz.html|url-status=dead|title=The Last Supper Script - Dialogue Transcript|archive-date=January 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Jude\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as Pete\n* [[Annabeth Gish]] as Paulie\n* [[Jonathan Penner]] as Marc\n* [[Courtney B.
