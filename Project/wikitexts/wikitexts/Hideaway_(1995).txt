It is based on the 1992 [[Hideaway (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Dean Koontz]], and stars [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Christine Lahti]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Jeremy Sisto]], [[Alfred Molina]] and [[Rae Dawn Chong]].\n\nIn the film, Goldblum plays a man who dies in a car accident, only to be revived two hours later. After being revived, he experiences frightening visions. He begins to understand that he has become psychically connected to a [[serial killer]], and that by cutting himself, he can actually induce the visions and see through the killer's eyes. However, the vision works both ways, and the killer can also see through his eyes.\n\n''Hideaway'' was released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on March 3, 1995. Critical reception was largely negative, and the film was not a financial success.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter killing his mother and sister and ritualistically arranging their bodies as a sacrifice to [[Satan]], a [[Devil]] worshipper recites the [[Lords Prayer]] backwards as it is written on the wall in a room filled with candles and [[Satanism|Satanic]] imagery. He then commits suicide by throwing himself onto an [[athame]] in an attempt to ensure that he is eternally damned. What follows next is a [[near-death experience]] where the clinically dead killer flies through tunnels of light, eventually arriving at a gaping, [[tentacle]]-like [[Phanuel (angel)|being of light]] who, after flashing through scenes of the recent brutal murders, darkens and casts the killer's soul down into [[Hell]].\n\nHatch Harrison is driving home from his family's lakeside cabin with his wife Lindsay, and daughter Regina. They collide with a truck and, after Regina manages to escape, the car plummets down a ravine into a fast-flowing river. Lindsay believes she watched her husband die.\n\nAt the hospital, Hatch is revived by Dr. Jonas Nyebern, who runs a specialist resuscitation team. During the procedure, a nurse warns Dr. Nyebern about bringing back a patient who has been gone for so long, saying \"We both remember what happened last time.\" While he is on the operating table, Hatch experiences visions of the same tunnels of light as the killer, but upon arriving for judgment is slowly floated into a surreal heavenly scene, where he sees his young daughter Samantha who died years before in a car accident. Hatch then enters [[Heaven]] and is merged into the light of a great [[angel]].\n\nHatch begins to experience disturbing visions while he sleeps which involve him seemingly murdering young women, when in fact he is actually seeing through the eyes of the real killer. As the killer looks down at his young blonde victim dead in shrubs at the side of a road, Hatch sees the same vision; in his vision the young blonde woman becomes his daughter Regina. The killer, who can also see through the eyes of Hatch, sees Regina.\n\nHatch realizes that the murders are actually happening when the women he sees in his visions are announced as missing in news reports. Regina sneaks out the house to meet some friends and they go to a dingy alternative night club, where the killer also happens to be. He recognizes Regina from his vision and introduces himself as \"Vassago\". Regina's friends interrupt and tell Vassago to leave them alone. Hatch, asleep at home, sees all this happening in his visions.\n\nThe next day, Hatch accuses Regina of being at the night club, which she denies. Hatch scares Regina as he attempts to warn her about Vassago. He is told that he is experiencing mental problems by his family, his psychiatrist, and the police. He visits a [[psychic]] who confirms his beliefs and tells him that he is tied to Vassago by a \"coincidence of fate\", and that Vassago is also seeing through Hatch's eyes. Vassago sees this and then visits the psychic at her home and kills her.\n\nHatch discovers that Vassago's real name is Jeremy Nyebern, and is the son of Dr. Nyebern. He confronts Dr. Nyebern, who explains that Jeremy is psychotic and that after murdering his mother and sister and attempting suicide, was revived by his resuscitation team. Jeremy kidnaps Regina and takes her to his hideaway beneath an abandoned [[amusement park]] where he has been building a \"monument to hell\". He ties Regina up at the top. Nyebern finds Jeremy and tries to talk him down, but Jeremy kills him. Hatch and Lindsay find them, and the souls of Hatch and Jeremy collide in a battle of good vs evil. Hatch (revealing himself to Vassago as \"Uriel,\" Vassago's antithesis) is the victor, killing Vassago and saving Regina. With his family safe, he exits the park with them.\n\nA post-credits scene shows Jeremy being pulled in to be revived. Jeremy wakes up, reaches for a scalpel on the medical table, and slits a nurse's throat. Hatch wakes up in his bed, realizing he was only dreaming. However, it could also be interpreted as Jeremy's resuscitation after his attempted suicide, and the \"remember what happened last time\" incident that the nurse mentioned in the operating room. Hatch and Lindsay laugh and go back to sleep.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Hatch Harrison / Uriel\n* [[Christine Lahti]] as Lindsey Harrison\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Regina Harrison\n* [[Jeremy Sisto]] as Vassago / Jeremy Nyebern\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Dr. Jonas Nyebern\n* [[Rae Dawn Chong]] as Rose Orwetto\n* [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Detective Breech\n\n==Production==\nAn international co-production film between The United States and Canada.

According to Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', \"Koontz hates the movie so much he tried to force TriStar to remove his name from the credits.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Rita | last=Kempley | title=Hideaway | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/hideawayrkempley_c00d6e.htm | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=March 4, 1995 | access-date=March 21, 2007 }}</ref> In addition, according to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle|San Francisco Chronicle's]]'' Walter Addiego, Koontz was so dissatisfied with ''Hideaway'' that he would only allow a film adaptation of his novel ''[[Phantoms (novel)|Phantoms]]'' to be made if he was allowed to approve the final version of the film.<ref>{{cite news | first=Walter | last=Addiego | title=How it was made more interesting than the film Author Koontz got his say on Phantoms | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1998/01/23/WEEKEND7998.dtl | work=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=January 28, 1998 | access-date=March 21, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn his own website, Koontz states that pre-production of the film was promising under [[Mike Medavoy]], who wanted to preserve Koontz's vision for the story and ordered a rewrite of the first script at Koontz's request. However, Medavoy was removed from the film and new production staff did not communicate with Koontz about the finished film, which departed drastically from his novel. Koontz ultimately resorted to legal means to get his name removed from the title of the film and from major advertising, but was unable to get his name removed from the credits. He also writes that he sent several letters to the Japanese CEO of the parent company of [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]/[[MCA Inc.|MCA]], which had the rights to the film, requesting that his name be removed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.deankoontz.com/hideaway-from-the-author/ | title=Hideaway \u2013 From the author | work=Dean Koontz official website | access-date=April 17, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''Hideaway'' made $12,201,255 at the US and Canadian box office<ref name=\"gross\">{{cite web | url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=hideaway.htm | title=Hideaway| work=[[Box Office Mojo]]| access-date=July 21, 2012 }}</ref> and $14 million internationally for a worldwide gross of $26.2 million.<ref name=ww/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0113303|title=Hideaway}}\n\n{{Dean Koontz}}\n{{Brett Leonard}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hideaway (Film)}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s serial killer films]]\n[[Category:American horror films]]\n[[Category:American serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Canadian horror films]]\n[[Category:Canadian serial killer films]]\n[[Category:Canadian slasher films]]\n[[Category:Films about child abduction in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about Satanism]]\n[[Category:Films about telepathy]]\n[[Category:Films based on American horror novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Dean Koontz]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Brett Leonard]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Trevor Jones]]\n[[Category:Films set in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Andrew Kevin Walker]]\n[[Category:Matricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fiction about near-death experiences]]\n[[Category:Patricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Sororicide in fiction]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
