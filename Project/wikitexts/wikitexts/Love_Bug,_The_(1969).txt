It was based on the 1961 book ''Car, Boy, Girl'' by Gordon Buford. {{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\nThe movie follows the adventures of Herbie, Herbie's driver, Jim Douglas ([[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]), and Jim's [[Romantic interest|love interest]], Carole Bennett ([[Michele Lee]]). It also features [[Buddy Hackett]] as Jim's enlightened, kind-hearted friend, Tennessee Steinmetz, a character who creates \"art\" from used car parts. English actor [[David Tomlinson]] portrays the villainous Peter Thorndyke, the owner of an [[automobile|auto]] [[showroom]] and an [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] national champion who sells Herbie to Jim and eventually becomes his racing rival.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Herbie the Matchmaker.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Dean Jones in ''The Love Bug'']]\n\n[[Race car driver]] Jim Douglas has been reduced to competing in [[demolition derby]] races against drivers half his age. As part of his overall life of poverty, Jim lives in an old [[fire house]] overlooking [[San Francisco Bay]] with his friend and mechanic, Tennessee Steinmetz.  Steinmetz, a claimant of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[spiritual enlightenment]], is a sculptor who uses old car parts. After yet another race ends in a crash, Jim must find a new car to drive. At an upmarket European car showroom, Douglas meets sales assistant and mechanic Carole Bennett, and the dealership's owner, Peter Thorndyke, who abuses a white [[Volkswagen Beetle]].\n\nDouglas, lacking money, leaves Thorndyke's showroom with nothing, but the abused Beetle follows him home.  After a police run-in on charges of [[motor vehicle theft|grand theft]], Thorndyke agrees to Douglas's offer to lease-purchase the tiny car. Douglas then enters himself and the Beetle in a series of races. To the astonishment of spectators and the growing hatred of rival driver Thorndyke, the \"Love Bug\" repeatedly wins.  Frustrated, Thorndyke finally infiltrates Tennessee's garage, the night before the next race, and sabotages the upstart vehicle by pouring [[Irish coffee]] into the gas tank.  A disgusted Douglas, with his eyes now on the upcoming El Dorado [[road racing|road race]], decides to switch out the underpowered vehicle for a brand new [[Lamborghini 400GT]].  In despair, the Beetle drives itself away from the Douglas/Tennessee garage with the goal of throwing itself off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. By the barest of margins, the car is saved when a repentant Jim Douglas risks his own life to save \"Herbie.\" With a financial backer, Chinese-American businessman Tang Wu ([[Benson Fong]]), Jim and Herbie are ready for the El Dorado.   \n\nThe El Dorado, an out-and-back [[open-road racing|open road race]], runs through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains from [[Yosemite Valley]] to [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]] and back. On the outbound leg, rival driver Thorndyke and his assistant Havershaw (acting as the \"Thorndyke Special's\" [[co-driver]]), carry out a series of dirty tricks against Herbie. As a result of Thorndyke's shenanigans, Jim (with Carole and Tennessee as co-drivers) limps home last with Herbie missing two wheels and having to use a wagon wheel to get to the first finish line.  Having come in last on Day 1, Herbie, Jim, Carole, and Tennessee must make a slow start on the race's Day 2, the homeward leg.  Thanks to some ingenious shortcuts, Jim is able to make up for lost time in the second leg.  As Herbie and the \"Thorndyke Special\" race towards the second finish line, Herbie succumbs to [[metal fatigue]] and breaks in two.  The Beetle's back half (carrying Tennessee and the engine) crosses the line just ahead of Thorndyke, while the front (carrying Jim and Carole) rolls over the line just behind.  The Love Bug has taken both first ''and'' third place.\n\nAs the Love Bug's backer, Wu takes over Thorndyke's car dealership.  He hires Tennessee as his assistant, and demotes Thorndyke and Havershaw to the mechanics' shop.  Rewelded into shape, Herbie chauffeurs the newlywed Jim and Carole away on their honeymoon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as James \"Jim\" Douglas, a racing driver\n*[[Michele Lee]] as Carole Bennet, Jim's love interest\n*[[David Tomlinson]] as Peter Thorndyke, the owner of the car shop \n*[[Buddy Hackett]] as Tennessee Steinmetz, Jim's friend and roommate and partner in racing\n*[[Joe Flynn (American actor)|Joe Flynn]] as Havershaw, Thorndyke's right-hand man\n*[[Benson Fong]] as Tang Wu, Jim's friend and team supporter\n*[[Joe E.

Although Jones tried to pitch him a serious, straightforward film project concerning the story of the first [[sports car]] ever brought to the United States, Walt suggested a different car story for him, which was ''Car, Boy, Girl'', a story written in 1961 by Gordon Buford.\n\n''Car, Boy, Girl;'' ''The Magic Volksy;'' ''The Runaway Wagen;'' ''Beetlebomb;'' ''Wonderbeetle;'' ''Bugboom'' and ''Thunderbug'' were among the original development titles considered for the film before the title was finalized as ''The Love Bug.''\n\nHerbie competes in the [[Monterey Grand Prix]], which, except for 1963, was not a sports car race. The actual sports car race held at Monterey was the [[Monterey Sports Car Championships]]. The 1968 Monterey Grand Prix was in fact a [[Can Am Series]] race, and did not feature production cars.\n\nPeter Thorndyke's yellow \"Special\" is actually a 1965 [[Apollo (1962 automobile)|Apollo GT]], a rare sports car sold by International Motorcars of [[Oakland, California]]. It used an Italian-built body and chassis from [[Intermeccanica]] paired with a small-block [[Buick V8 engine]] that was installed in Oakland. This car exists today, is in the hands of a private collector, and has been restored as it was seen in the film with its yellow paint and number 14 logo.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Thorndyke Special|url=http://barnfinds.com/thorndyke-special/|website=Barnfinds.com|date=7 November 2013|access-date=2017-11-12|archive-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113060341/http://barnfinds.com/thorndyke-special/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===\"Herbie\"===\n{{main|Herbie}}\n[[File:Herbie film car from The Love Bug.jpg|left|thumb|One of the original cars used during the filming of ''The Love Bug'']]\nBefore the film entered production, the titular car was not specified as a [[Volkswagen Beetle]], and Disney set up a casting call for a dozen cars to audition. In the lineup, there were a few [[Toyota]]s, a [[TVR]], a handful of [[Volvo]]s, an [[MG Cars|MG]] and a pearl white Volkswagen Beetle. The Volkswagen Beetle was chosen as it was the only one that elicited the crew to reach out and pet it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Volkswagen brand name, logo or shield does not feature anywhere in the film, as the automaker did not permit Disney to use the name. The only logos can be briefly seen in at least two places, however. The first instance is on the brake pedals during the first scene where Herbie takes control with Jim inside (on the freeway when Herbie runs into Thorndyke's Rolls Royce), and it is shown in all the future scenes when Jim is braking. The second instance is on the ignition key, when Jim tries to shut down the braking Herbie. The later sequels produced, however, do promote the Volkswagen name (as sales of the Beetle were down when the sequels were produced). The VW \"[[Wolfsburg]]\" castle emblem on the steering wheel hub is also seen throughout the car's interior shots. Within the script, the car was only ever referred to as \"Herbie\", \"the small car\" or \"the Bug\"\u2014the latter, although a common nickname for the Beetle, was not trademarked by Volkswagen at the time of filming.\n\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Align = Right\n|Image = LAret53.PNG\n|Name = Donald Drysdale\n|Number = 53\n|Team = Los Angeles Dodgers\n|Year = 1984\n}}\n\nThe car was later given the name \"Herbie\" from one of [[Buddy Hackett]]'s [[Sketch comedy|skit]]s about a ski instructor named Klaus, who speaks with a German accent as he introduces his fellow ski instructors, who are named Hans, Fritz, Wilhelm, and Sandor. At the end of the skit, Hackett would say \"If you ain't got a Herbie (pronounced \"''hoy-bee''{{-\"}}), I ain't going.\"\n\nHerbie's trademark \"53\" racing number was chosen by producer [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]], who was a fan of [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball player [[Don Drysdale]] (Drysdale's jersey number, later retired by the team, was 53).\n\nWalsh also gave Herbie his trademark red, white and blue [[racing stripe]]s presumably for the more [[patriotic]] color and came up with the film's gags such as Herbie squirting oil and opening the doors by himself.<ref>DVD commentary, ''The Love Bug'', 2003</ref>\n\nBenson Fong, who played Mr. Wu, said that when he and the others were dragged along the dirt by Herbie, it was like being pulled by 40 horses. The 1961\u20131965 Volkswagen Beetles actually were rated by the [[SAE International|SAE]] at {{convert|40|hp}} in factory configuration (though only {{convert|34|hp}} by the European [[DIN]] system which measured engine output as installed in the car with cooling fan and exhaust system attached).\n\nHerbie has his own cast billing in the closing credits, the only time this was done in the entire series of films.\n\nToday, only a handful of the original Herbie cars are known to exist. Car #10 was recovered from a warehouse in Pennsylvania, and has been preserved\u2014still sporting its original paint from the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Love Bug Reunion|url=http://barnfinds.com/love-bug-reunion/|website=Barnfinds.com|date=8 November 2013|access-date=2014-02-21|archive-date=2014-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803153613/http://barnfinds.com/love-bug-reunion/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nThe bonuses on the DVD provide two deleted scenes named \"Used Car Lot\" and \"Playground\".\n\nA scene shot, but not included in the final cut of the film, featured Jim calling at a [[Car dealership|used car lot]] prior to his visiting Thorndyke's auto showroom. This missing sequence has long since been lost, and all that remains is the [[Screenplay|script]] and a single [[black-and-white]] photograph of Jim talking with the salesman at the lot.\n\nAn unfilmed scene at the end of the story that was scripted and [[storyboard]]ed was to have shown Herbie playing with children at a nearby [[playground]] prior to taking the newly married Jim and Carole off on their honeymoon.\n\n===Stock footage===\nThe opening scene of the [[demolition derby]] cars is [[stock footage|footage]] from the film ''[[Fireball 500]].'' Parts of this scene can also be found in a 1966-model year dealer promotional film by Chevrolet, titled ''Impact '66''.\n\n===Shooting locations===\nSome of the racetrack scenes were shot at the [[Riverside International Raceway]] in [[Riverside, California]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Sam|title=Shelby, American|journal=[[Road & Track]]|date=May 2014|volume=65|issue=8|page=65}}</ref> Others were filmed at [[Laguna Seca Raceway]] in [[Monterey, California]], [[Willow Springs Raceway]] in [[Willow Springs, Kern County, California|Willow Springs, California]] and [[Paramount Ranch Racetrack|Paramount Ranch]] in [[Agoura Hills, California]].

It received mostly positive reviews from critics, later earning a 78% \"Fresh\" rating from 18 critics on the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1012813-love_bug/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=The Love Bug, Movie Reviews|access-date=March 3, 2022|archive-date=October 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001171854/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1012813-love_bug/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' panned the film as \"a long, sentimental Volkswagen commercial ... which has the form of fantasy-comedy, lots of not-very-special effects and no real humor.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (March 14, 1969). \"The Screen: And Now a Word From...\" ''[[The New York Times]]''. 50.</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"For sheer inventiveness of situation and the charm that such an idea projects, 'The Love Bug' rates as one of the better entries of the Disney organization.\"<ref>\"Film Reviews: The Love Bug\".

Some parts of the racing sequences from the film were later reused for Herbie's [[dream sequence]] in ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', responding to Grandma Steinmetz's telling Willoughby Whitfield that Herbie used to be a famous racecar.\n\nA five-episode television series, titled ''[[Herbie, the Love Bug (TV series)|Herbie, the Love Bug]]'', aired on [[CBS]] in the United States in 1982. Directed by Vincent McEveety, the series acted as a continuation of the films, with Dean Jones reprising his role as Jim Douglas. In 1997, there was a [[The Love Bug (1997 film)|made-for-television]] [[sequel]] which included a Dean Jones cameo, tying it to the previous films. The most recent sequel, ''[[Herbie: Fully Loaded]]'', was released on June 22, 2005, by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].\n\nAt [[Disney's All-Star Movies Resort]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], Herbie has been immortalized in the \"Love Bug\" buildings 6 and 7.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on VHS on March 4, 1980. It was re-released on November 6, 1985, September 11, 1991 and on October 28, 1994 with ''Herbie Rides Again''. It was soon re-released again on September 16, 1997 along with the entire ''Herbie the Love Bug'' film series. It was released on DVD for the first time on May 20, 2003. It was released again with its sequels in a four movie collection in 2012. A 45th Anniversary Edition [[Blu-ray Disc]] was released on December 16, 2014 as a Disney Movie Club exclusive title.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Superbug (film series)|Superbug]]'' (1971\u20131978)\u2014a knockoff series of West German films also about a sentient Volkswagen Beetle named Dudu.\n* ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983)\u2014a later supernatural horror film about an anthropomorphic autumn-red, hardtop 1958 [[Plymouth Fury]] named Christine.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Herbie 1963|The Love Bug (Herbie)}}\n*[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/lovebugfans/ Lovebugfans forum]\n*{{IMDb title|0064603}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20210319175515/http://www.lovebugfans.net/ Lovebugfans] (archived)\n*{{Amg movie|30279}}\n*[https://mistersf.com/cinema/index.html?cinherbie.htm San Francisco in Cinema: ''The Love Bug'']\n*{{tcmdb title|81946|The Love Bug}}\n\n{{Herbie|state=expanded}}\n{{Robert Stevenson}}\n{{Portal bar|Film|Disney|1960s}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Love Bug, The}}\n[[Category:1968 films]]\n[[Category:1960s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:1968 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Herbie films|1]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films shot in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Robert Stevenson]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Bill Walsh (producer)]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Bruns]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
