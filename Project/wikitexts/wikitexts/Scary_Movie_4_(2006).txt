It is the sequel to ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' and the fourth installment in the [[Scary Movie (film series)|''Scary Movie'' film series]], as well as the first film in the franchise to be released under [[The Weinstein Company]] banner since the purchase of [[Dimension Films]] from [[Disney]]. It was directed by [[David Zucker]], written by [[Jim Abrahams]], [[Craig Mazin]], and [[Pat Proft]], and produced by [[Robert K. Weiss]] and [[Craig Mazin]].\n\nThe film marks the final franchise appearances of the main stars, [[Anna Faris]] and [[Regina Hall]] (who portray Cindy and Brenda, respectively), and concludes the original story arc. This was initially intended to be the final film in the ''Scary Movie'' film series, until ''[[Scary Movie 5]]'' was released by The Weinstein Company on April 12, 2013, in a different storyline, with [[Simon Rex]], [[Charlie Sheen]], and [[Molly Shannon]] in different roles.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] [[Saw (2004 film)|wake up to find themselves chained to pipes in a bathroom]]. Their host, [[Billy the Puppet]], reveals that the room is slowly filling with nerve gas with the only way out being to make a basket and get the saws, which have to be used on their feet. Unfortunately, Dr. Phil saws the wrong foot and faints, leaving the two to die.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Cindy Campbell]] visits her brother-in-law, Tom Logan in [[New York City]]. Her husband George has died, and her nephew Cody has enrolled in military academy, leaving her heartbroken and lonely. Tom's attempted suicide results in his ingesting [[viagra]], which greatly [[erection|swells his penis]] and causes his death when he falls off the railing. Afterwards, Cindy takes a job to care for Mrs. Norris, [[The Grudge (film)|who lives in a haunted house]]. Next door is Tom Ryan, who runs into George's friends Mahalik and CJ, learning about [[Brokeback Mountain|their homosexual one-night stand]]. He is greeted at home by the arrival of his estranged children, Robbie and Rachel. Over the following day, Cindy bonds with Tom, confiding to him about George's death in [[Million Dollar Baby|a fateful boxing match]]. The two realize their newfound love, but are interrupted by a gigantic [[IPod Classic|triPod]] which disables electricity and starts [[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|vaporizing the town residents]].\n\nCindy converses in mock [[Japanese language|Japanese]] with the haunted house's ghost, [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]], learning that the answer of the invasion is his father's heart. While Tom leaves the city with his children, Cindy reunites with her friend, Brenda Meeks, inexplicably alive after [[Scary Movie 3|her death]]. Following Toshio's directions, the two head to the countryside and end up in [[The Village (2004 film)|a mysterious, isolated community]]. They are captured and put to trial headed by Henry Hale. The result allows them to live but never leave the village. Meanwhile, an emergency [[United Nations]] meeting, headed by the eccentric [[U.S. President]] Baxter Harris, who is reluctant to stop reading [[The Pet Goat|\"My Pet Duck\"]], goes awry when a weapon scavenged from the aliens renders everyone stark-naked.\n\nTom and his children drive and find themselves in the middle of a war between the [[U.S. military]] and the aliens. Excited with the conflict, Robbie runs away, while Tom and Rachel are taken by the triPod. Back at the village, Henry is killed by the village loon, Ezekiel, revealing to Cindy that he fathered Toshio, who was killed during Cindy's boxing match. Cindy and Brenda are soon taken by the triPod and sent to the bathroom seen in the prologue, and they get stuck into the [[Saw 2|Venus flytrap]]. Cindy manages to get through Billy's challenge, but is threatened with the safety of Tom and his children, who are put to traps. Looking at a toilet with the \"heart\" nearby, Cindy realizes that Billy, through Henry's wife, is the true biological father of Toshio. Seeing how far Tom would go to save his children, Billy, who realizes his mistakes, apologizes for the invasion and releases them. Robbie and Rachel are successfully returned to their mother, who is revealed to have married a much older man. Brenda also becomes romantically involved with Billy's brother, Zoltar.\n\nAn epilogue set one month afterwards, narrated by [[James Earl Jones]] who is subsequently hit by a bus, reveals Brenda's giving birth to her child with Zoltar, Mahalik and CJ resuming their relationship, and President Harris being contented with his duck. Meanwhile, Tom appears in ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and wildly professes his love for Cindy by jumping around, throwing Cindy across the room, then breaking Oprah's wrists and hitting her with a chair afterwards.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anna Faris]] as [[Cindy Campbell]]\n* [[Regina Hall]] as Brenda Meeks\n* [[Craig Bierko]] as Tom Ryan\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as President Baxter Harris\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Henry Hale\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Mahalik Phifer\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as CJ Iz\n* [[Beau Mirchoff]] as Robbie Ryan\n* [[Conchita Campbell]] as Rachel Ryan\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Marilyn\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Oliver\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Ezekiel\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as Holly\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Emma Norris\n* Garrett Masuda as [[Toshio Saeki]]\n* [[Craig Mazin]] as [[Billy the Puppet|Billy]] (voice)\n* [[DeRay Davis]] as Marvin\n* Henry Mah as Mr. Koji\n* [[Patrice O'Neal]] as Rashed/CrackHead\n* Tomoko Sato as [[Kayako Saeki]]\n* Kathryn Dobbs as School Teacher\n* [[Bryan Callen]] as Agent Harper \n* [[David Zucker (director)|David Zucker]] as Zoltar (voice)\n* Angelique Naude as Waitress\n* Rorelee Tio as Yoko\n* Allison Warren as Polish Delegate\n* [[Edward Moss (impersonator)|Edward Moss]] as [[Michael Jackson]]\n* Champagne Powell as [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]]\n* [[Dave Attell]] as Knifeman\n* [[John Reardon]] as Jeremiah\n* Kimani Ray Smith as Cutman\n* Dale Wolfe as Hang Gliding Man\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Cameo appearances ===\n* [[Shaquille O'Neal]] as himself\n* [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] as himself\n* [[Simon Rex]] as George Logan\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Tom Logan<ref name=\"Hallenbeck\">{{cite book|last1=Hallenbeck|first1=Bruce G.|title=Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914\u20132008|date=2009|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786453788|pages=196\u2013197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AIgAef-bAcC|access-date=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> (uncredited)\n* [[Debra Wilson]] as [[Oprah Winfrey]]\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as Narrator / Himself<ref name=\"Hallenbeck\"/>\n* [[Holly Madison]], [[Bridget Marquardt]] and [[Kendra Wilkinson]] as girls in Tom's bed\n* [[Lil Jon]] as himself\n* [[Fabolous]] as himself/gunman\n* [[Chingy]] as himself\n* [[Crystal Lowe]] as Chingy's girl\n* [[Bubba Sparxxx]] as hoodlum\n* [[Bone Crusher (rapper)|Bone Crusher]] as hoodlum\n* [[Sean P]] and [[J-Bo]] as [[YoungBloodZ]]\n* [[Michael McDonald (kickboxer)|Michael McDonald]] as Tiffany Stone (female boxer)\nNara- The scene with jigsaw \n\n== Release ==\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was released on DVD on August 15, 2006 in rated (83 minutes) and unrated (89 minutes) editions with [[deleted scene]]s, [[blooper]]s, and [[outtake]]s.
