Smith]], based on Smith's [[A Simple Plan (novel)|1993 novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Bill Paxton]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], and [[Bridget Fonda]]. Set in rural [[Minnesota]], the story follows brothers Hank (Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Thornton), who, along with Jacob's friend Lou ([[Brent Briscoe]]), discover a crashed plane containing $4.4 million in cash. The three men and Hank's wife Sarah (Fonda) go to great lengths to keep the money a secret but begin to doubt each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 1993 before the novel was published. [[Mike Nichols]] purchased the film rights, and the project was picked up by [[Savoy Pictures]]. After Nichols stepped down, the film adaptation became mired in [[development hell]], with [[Ben Stiller]] and [[John Dahl]] turning down opportunities to direct it. After Savoy closed in November 1997, the project was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[John Boorman]] was hired to direct, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Raimi. An international co-production between the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan, the film was financed by [[Mutual Film Company]], its investors and [[Newmarket Capital Group]], which allocated a budget of $17 million. [[Principal photography]] began in January 1998 and concluded in March after 55 days of filming in [[Wisconsin]] and Minnesota. The [[film score|score]] was produced and composed by [[Danny Elfman]].\n\n''A Simple Plan'' premiered at the [[1998 Toronto International Film Festival]], where it was met with critical acclaim. The film's appearance at the festival preceded a limited release in the United States on December 11, 1998, followed by a general release in North America on January 22, 1999. It underperformed at the North American box office, grossing $16.3 million. Reviewers praised various aspects of the film's production, including the storytelling, performances and Raimi's direction. ''A Simple Plan'' earned multiple awards and nominations, among them two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Thornton) and one for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Smith).\n\n==Plot==\nHank Mitchell and his pregnant wife Sarah live in rural [[Wright County, Minnesota|Wright County]], [[Minnesota]]. One of the town's few college graduates, Hank works as a bookkeeper at a feed mill, while Sarah is a librarian. Hank, his older brother Jacob, who has learning difficulties, and their friend Lou Chambers chase a fox into the woods, and stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in [[United States one-hundred-dollar bill|$100 bill]]s. He suggests turning the money in, but Lou and Jacob persuade him not to. Hank then proposes that he keep the money safe at his house until the end of winter when the snow will melt and the plane will be found. At that point, if no-one talks about missing money, they will take their share and move away.\n\nSheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they've hidden the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. At Lou's suggestion, Jacob attempts to avoid suspicion by mentioning hearing a plane nearby. Hank becomes worried but they return to their truck. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to keep the money a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he reveals the discovery to Sarah.\n\nSarah suggests that Hank return a small portion of the money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. She insists that he should go alone, but Hank takes Jacob with him. Hank walks through the woods to the plane while Jacob waits at the car pretending to change the tire. Elderly farmer Dwight Stephanson approaches Jacob and asks him if he came across a [[fox]] that ran off with a chicken. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons Dwight. Hank arrives and says Dwight is dead and they need to split up and meet later whilst he moves the body. But Dwight regains consciousness, so Hank suffocates him. He then uses the snowmobile to drive the body off a bridge, making the murder resemble an accidental death.\n\nWhile searching newspaper clippings at the library, Sarah finds out that the money was a [[ransom]] for a kidnapped heiress from [[Michigan]], who was abducted by two brothers, Stephen and Vernon Bokovsky. Sarah surmises that the dead pilot was one of the brothers, as the ransom was delivered, but the whereabouts of the two brothers remain unknown.\n\nThe following night, Lou drunkenly demands his portion of the money from Hank, because he is broke and has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about Dwight's murder. Hank lies to Lou, telling him that the money is not inside his house. He gives him $40 to appease him, and calms him down by telling him that they are in this together.\n\nAfter giving birth to their daughter Amanda, Sarah advises Hank to frame Lou for Dwight's murder by getting Lou drunk and tricking him into falsely confessing to the killing and recording the confession. The plan works, although Jacob is dismayed and reluctant to betray his friend. Lou grows enraged when he realizes that they have conspired against him, and he pulls a [[shotgun]] on Hank. Jacob then grabs his hunting rifle and after a tense standoff, kills Lou to save Hank. Hank then tries to calm Lou's wife Nancy, who gets a revolver and shoots at Hank, who then kills her with Lou's shotgun. Hank stages the scene to make it look like Lou shot Nancy and was about to shoot him. He and Jacob tell the police this story, and successfully avoid arrest and suspicion.\n\nBecause Jacob mentioned hearing a plane in the woods, Carl asks the brothers to assist [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Neil Baxter in a search for the missing aircraft. Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah is immediately skeptical of Baxter, suspecting he is actually Vernon Bokovsky, posing as an FBI agent to recover the money for himself. When she discovers this to be true, she calls to warn Hank, who steals a [[Smith & Wesson Model 15|revolver]] and a handful of assorted bullets from Carl's office and desk. The four men head into the woods and split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and forces Hank to retrieve the money from the plane. Hank manages to distract Baxter with the small amount of money he had returned to the plane, before then shooting and killing Baxter.\n\nHe starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities, but Jacob tells him that he does not want to live with the memories of what they have done, and asks Hank to kill him and frame Baxter for it. When Hank refuses, he threatens to commit suicide, which would implicate them both in the whole conspiracy. After weighing the decision, a heartbroken Hank kills Jacob with Baxter's [[SIG-Sauer P226|pistol]]. At the police station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. He is cleared of any wrongdoing, and is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' [[serial number]]s were written down to track the cash, so the bills making up that cash could not in any case realistically be spent without the individual eventually being identified and caught. Hank returns home and burns it all, upsetting Sarah. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses. Although he tries to move on with his life, the murders constantly haunt him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Paxton]] as Hank Mitchell\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Jacob Mitchell\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Sarah Mitchell\n* [[Brent Briscoe]] as Lou Chambers\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Vernon Bokovsky / FBI Agent Neil Baxter\n* Jack Walsh as Tom Butler\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as Sheriff Carl Jenkins\n* [[Becky Ann Baker]] as Nancy Chambers\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | width1 = 130\n | image1 = ScottSmith2.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | width2 = 140\n | image2 = Sam Raimi by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = From left to right: [[Scott Smith (author)|Scott B.
