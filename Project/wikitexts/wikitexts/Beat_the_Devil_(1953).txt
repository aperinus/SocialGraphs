It starred [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Jennifer Jones]], and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] and featured [[Robert Morley]], [[Peter Lorre]], and [[Bernard Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Beat the Devil (1953)|url=http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/beat-the-devil-m100010576|publisher=MRQE|access-date=1 June 2012}}</ref>  Huston and [[Truman Capote]] wrote the [[screenplay]], loosely based upon the 1951 novel of the [[Beat the Devil (novel)|same name]] by British journalist [[Claud Cockburn]] writing under the pseudonym James Helvick. Huston made the film as a sort of loose parody of the 1941 film ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', which Huston directed and in which Bogart and Lorre appeared. Capote said, \"John [Huston] and I decided to kid the story, to treat it as a parody. Instead of another ''Maltese Falcon'', we turned it into a... [spoof] on this type of film.\"<ref>Gehring, Wes D.

He is reluctantly working with four crooks: Peterson, Julius O'Hara, Major Jack Ross, and Ravello, who are trying to acquire [[uranium]]-rich land in [[British East Africa]]. Billy suspects that Major Ross murdered a British Colonial officer who threatened to expose their plan. While waiting in [[Italy]] for passage to Africa, Billy and his wife Maria meet a British couple, Harry and Gwendolen Chelm, who plan to travel on the same ship. Harry seems a very proper and traditional Englishman, while Gwendolen is flighty and a compulsive fantasist. Billy and Gwendolen have an affair, while Maria flirts with Harry. Peterson becomes suspicious that the Chelms may be attempting to acquire the uranium themselves. Though this is untrue, it seems confirmed by Gwendolen, who lies about her husband and exaggerates his importance.\n\n[[File:Beat the Devil (1953).webm|thumb|upright=1.3|Sea-sick Harry and Gwendolen on board]]\n\nBilly and Peterson decide to take a plane instead, but their car runs over a cliff when they are pushing it after a breakdown and the pair are wrongly reported to have been killed. In order to replace Peterson's lost capital, Ravello approaches Harry Chelm and explains their scheme. Just then, to everyone's surprise, Billy and Peterson return to the hotel unharmed, just as the purser announces that the ship is at last ready to sail. On board, Harry reveals that he knows about Peterson's scheme and intends to inform the authorities. Peterson orders Major Ross to kill Harry, but Billy thwarts the murder attempt. Disbelieving Harry's outraged accusations, however, the ship's drunken captain has Harry locked in the brig.\n\nThe ship's engine malfunctions and the passengers are told to escape by lifeboat. When Billy goes to rescue Harry, he finds that he has freed himself and left the ship, intending to swim ashore. Having abandoned ship, the passengers land on an African beach, where they are arrested by Arab soldiers. They are interrogated by Ahmed, an Arab official who suspects that they may be spies or revolutionaries. Billy creates a distraction by fleeing the room, and befriends Ahmed when he is recaptured by talking to him about [[Rita Hayworth]], whom he pretends to have known. Billy then persuades him to send the party back to Italy by sailing boat.\n\nAfter the party land, they are questioned by a [[Scotland Yard]] detective who is investigating the murder of the Colonial officer. Just as he seems taken in by Peterson's smooth talk, Gwendolen reveals Peterson's scheme, his involvement in the murder, and his attempt to kill Harry. The detective promptly arrests Peterson, O'Hara, Ross, and Ravello. As the four crooks are led away in handcuffs, Gwendolen receives a telegram from British East Africa saying that Harry has acquired the land where Peterson and the others were aiming to enrich themselves; he is now extremely wealthy and willing to forgive Gwendolen. Billy laughs happily, saying, \"This is the end, the end!\"\n\n== Cast ==\n\n[[File:Beatthedevil01.jpg|thumb|267px|Film still image of [[Jennifer Jones]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Billy Dannreuther<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=Clifford|title=BOGEY - The Films of Humphrey Bogart|date=1965|publisher=Cadillac Publishing Co, Inc.|location=New York, N.Y.|page=171}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Jones]] as Mrs. Gwendolen Chelm\n* [[Gina Lollobrigida]] as Maria Dannreuther\n* [[Robert Morley]] as Peterson\n* [[Peter Lorre]] as Julius O'Hara\n* [[Edward Underdown]] as Harry Chelm\n* [[Ivor Barnard]] as Major Jack Ross\n* [[Marco Tulli]] as Ravello\n* Manuel Serrano as Ahmed\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as Inspector Jack Clayton\n* Mario Perrone as Purser on SS Nyanga\n* [[Giulio Donnini]] as Administrator\n* [[Saro Urz\u00ec]] as Captain of SS Nyanga\n* [[Juan de Landa]] as Hispano-Suiza Driver\n* [[Aldo Silvani]] as Charles, restaurant owner\n* Alex Pochet as Hotel Manager (uncredited)\n* Mimo Poli as Barman (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nDuring the filming of ''Beat the Devil'', Humphrey Bogart lost several of his teeth in a car accident.
