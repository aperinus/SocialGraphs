It stars [[Scott Valentine (actor)|Scott Valentine]], [[Janet Gunn]], Rick Dean, Rodger Halston and [[Anthony Peck]]. The film follows a military team as they try to capture several genetically reconstructed dinosaurs. It received negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the opening sequence, an army convoy is attacked by terrorists who soon discover they have stolen a truck of living frozen biological material instead of uranium. Once at a dockside warehouse, two frozen ''[[Velociraptor]]''s and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' escape and kill many of the terrorists before the police arrive, who expect to find drug smugglers. After finding the sole survivor, the police are killed inside the warehouse by the Velociraptors. An anti-terrorist special force led by Colonel Rance Higgins is called in by General Mercer where they find pieces of bodies and a refrigeration truck rather than uranium. They maneuver through warehouse boxes until two get slashed to death.\n\nThe survivors learn from Dr. Hodges that these dinosaurs were genetically reconstructed and are now the last three \"carnosaurs\" left in existence. The dinosaurs had been en route to a government research facility, and it is made clear that they need to be caught alive, relating to the potential for curing major diseases. A massive meat shipment resides at the dock, so the three remaining soldiers hunt in that area, meeting up with a unit of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]]s who have come as backup. Soldier Polchek is given drugs to shoot into the carnosaurs as the group set up a lure and net trap with meat. One of the ''Velociraptor''s attacks and almost succeeds in dragging off Polchek, but is shot down.\n\nThe raptor is taken to the base for examination. Hodges soon theorizes that the [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] ''T. rex'' is breeding since Polchek was being dragged off, perhaps to hatchlings. The injured ''Velociraptor'' awakens and begins to attack. The ''T. rex'' also appears and bites off a soldier's head before escaping with the ''Velociraptor'' to an agricultural transport ship. With Marine member Rossi as captain, the team decides to move the ship out to sea and to use its refrigeration coolant to freeze the dinosaurs.\n\nWhen time comes to explore the lower decks of the ship, the carnosaurs knock out the lights and kill a couple more soldiers. The survivors get to an elevator, but a ''Velociraptor'' chews the cable through and they crash on the bottom level. There, the team discover the nest of eggs and begin shooting it, angering the ''T. rex'', who soon bites off Polchek's arm and then eats him. The survivors decide to kill the dinosaurs, by blowing up the ship with dynamite.\n\nThe ''T. rex'' bursts through the ceiling and drags Rossi through it before eating him. The two Velociraptors are shot to death after one of them kills Marine member Proudfoot. Hodges senses the ''T. rex'' is close. She and Rance hide behind lockers which the ''T. rex'' head-butts. Rance throws an explosive in the mouth of the dinosaur, killing it. The two race against time to jump in the ocean before the ship explodes. Back in a police car at the port, the sole surviving terrorist is still bound and gagged in the back seat when a ''Velociraptor'' soon appears outside the vehicle and eats him, foreshadowing that the prehistoric terror is not over yet.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Scott Valentine (actor)|Scott Valentine]] as Colonel Rance Higgins\n* [[Janet Gunn]] as Dr. Hodges\n* Rick Dean as Polchek\n* Rodger Halston as Sanders\n* [[Anthony Peck]] as General Pete Mercer\n* [[Terri J.
