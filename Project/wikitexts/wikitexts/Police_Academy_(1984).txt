The film stars [[Steve Guttenberg]], [[Kim Cattrall]], and [[G.W. Bailey]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[The Ladd Company]]. It premiered on March 23, 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/police-academy|title=Home Page|website=Warnerbros.com|access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref> It grossed $8.5 million in its opening weekend and over $149 million worldwide, against a budget of $4.5 million, and remains the most successful film of the series as of 2022.<ref name=block/> The film spawned six sequels in the [[Police Academy (franchise)|''Police Academy'' franchise]].\n\n==Plot==\nDue to a shortage of [[police officer]]s, Mary Sue Beal, the mayor of an unnamed city, requires the police department to accept all recruits. Easy-going [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Off./Sgt. Carey Mahoney|Carey Mahoney]], who has repeatedly gotten in legal trouble while standing up to arrogance, is given a choice by Police Captain Reed: enroll in the police academy or go to jail. Mahoney agrees to the former, but plans to be such a bad student that he's expelled. But he cannot quit, if he quits he can go to jail. The chief of police, [[List of Police Academy characters#Police Chief/Commissioner Henry J. Hurst|Henry Hurst]], outraged by the Mayor's plan, decides to make the experience so bad for the new recruits that they give up.\n\nLieutenant [[List of Police Academy characters#Lt./Capt. Thaddeus Harris|Thaddeus Harris]] makes their lives miserable, though [[Eric Lassard|Commandant Eric Lassard]] wants to give the new cadets a chance. Harris appoints [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Sgt. Chad Copeland|Copeland]] and [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Sgt. Kyle Blankes|Blankes]] as squad leaders to help him.\n\nLassard reveals to Mahoney his deal with Capt. Reed to keep him at the police academy for the full term. Mahoney falls in love with cadet [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet Karen Thompson|Karen Thompson]] and befriends fellow cadets [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Off./Sgt. Larvell Jones|Larvell Jones]], a human [[beatbox]], ladies' man [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet George Martin|George Martin]], gun-obsessed security guard [[Tackleberry|Eugene Tackleberry]], cowardly man [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet Leslie Barbara|Leslie Barbara]], accident-prone [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Off./Sgt. Douglas Fackler|Douglas Fackler]] and gentle giant [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Off./Sgt./Lt. Moses Hightower|Moses Hightower]].\n\nBlankes and Copeland investigate a party organized by Mahoney, who tricks them by saying that the party is at the Blue Oyster, a [[gay bar]]. The pair plant a prostitute in Mahoney's dormitory, to be found during room checks. While smuggling her off the campus, Mahoney is forced to hide with her under a lectern as Commandant Lassard leads in a group of officers. While Mahoney is not looking, the prostitute performs [[fellatio]] on Lassard. Mahoney steps out from under the lectern but finds Lassard still present, leading Lassard to assume Mahoney did it.\n\nHightower reveals to Mahoney that he has not driven a car since he was 12. To help Hightower prepare for a [[driving test]], they steal Copeland's car. After Hightower passes the test, Copeland racially insults cadet [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Off./Sgt. Laverne Hooks|Laverne Hooks]] for an accident. Hightower, angered by the insult, overturns the car with Copeland inside. Harris ejects Hightower from the academy, upsetting the other cadets.\n\nBlankes and Copeland fail to trick Mahoney into fighting them after they find Copeland's destroyed car. Barbara stands up for Mahoney and knocks Copeland out with a lunch tray. Blankes retaliates, and Mahoney becomes involved in a brawl. When Harris asks who started the fight, Mahoney takes the blame to protect Barbara's standing and is expelled.\n\nWhile downtown, Fackler throws an apple out of a police car, which hits a man on the back of the head; this triggers a chain reaction of violence which quickly escalates into a general riot. Mahoney, just about to leave, instead joins the other cadets to pacify the crowd. The cadets are accidentally transported to the epicenter of the rioting, and [[List of Police Academy characters#Unnamed Main Antagonist/Axe Murderer|one criminal]] steals Blankes and Copeland's revolvers, whereupon the two hide out in the Blue Oyster Bar. A rioter gang captures Harris, with their group leader taking him as a hostage. Mahoney attempts to rescue Harris but is also taken hostage. Hightower appears, deceives the madman, and knocks him down a set of stairs, to be arrested by Hooks.\n\nMahoney and Hightower are both reinstated, and for rescuing Harris and capturing his kidnapper, they receive the academy's highest commendation and medals. The film ends with all cadets graduating.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of Police Academy characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as [[List of Police Academy characters#Cadet/Off./Sgt.

They were an unbelievable bunch-including a lady who must have weighed over 200 pounds and a flabby man of well over 50. I asked the sergeant about them, and he explained that the mayor had ordered the department to accept a broad spectrum for the academy. \"We have to take them in,\"...[he said] ...\"And the only thing we can do is wash them out.\"<ref name=\"latimes\"/></blockquote> \nMaslansky said he wondered \"But what if they actually made it?\"<ref name=\"latimes\"/> He took the idea to Alan Ladd Jr who agreed to finance.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\nNeal Israel was hired to write the script with Pat Proft. Israel said:\n<blockquote>It's a matter of block comedy scenes. Perhaps the most recognizable was the obvious results of guys eating beans in `Blazing Saddles.' If you have four or five of these block comedy scenes in a teen-age comedy, you have a hit. If your block comedy scenes are very, very strong ones, you have a blockbuster.<ref name=\"latimes\"/></blockquote>\n[[Dom DeLuise]] was considered to direct the film but he was unavailable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/77207/15-lawful-facts-about-police-academy-movies|title = 15 Lawful Facts About the Police Academy Movies|date = 28 April 2016}}</ref> Hugh Wilson was hired as director based on his success with ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' even though he was not familiar with many films of this genre. He then saw a lot of those sort of movies and says \"it was fairly discouraging. This immediately convinced me to cut down on the sleaze. I asked for, and got, the power to refine the Israel-Proft script. Maintaining that `funny is money,' I wanted to go for real laughter rather than going for the elements such as gratuitous sex and anti-Establishment exploits. I wanted jokes which were rooted in reality.\"<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\nMaslansky says Wilson \"took a lot of the vulgarity out; some of the very things I considered necessary. I worried that it was becoming more homogenized, and I told Hugh, `Let's keep some of the flatulence in.'\"<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\nWilson says \"I found out that the shower scene, the party scene and the fellatio scene were obligatory; I had to put them in. So I was stuck with trying to make those scenes as artistic as possible.\"<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\nAccording to the ''Los Angeles Times'', about \"20 of the major elements in the movie\" remain from the Israel and Proft version. Israel says that when Wilson and Maslansky turned in their rewrite to the Ladd Company, \"it was rejected and the project was almost shelved. Only when they put back in dozens of our gags did the project get the go ahead.\"<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\nSome of the scenes Wilson was unhappy with included the fellatio scene and the scene where a police sergeant was hurled into the back of a horse. A compromise was reached where these acts were not actually shown.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\n\"I realize that you can carry grossness, rudeness and crudeness just so far before the audience finds it terribly repetitive and not so funny,\" said Wilson. \"After the enormous success of ''Police Academy'', I no longer believe that you have to show the female breast or make cruel ethnic jokes-not to mention the rampant sexism. And you don't have to reproduce the sounds that an overfed body makes.\"<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nOpening scenes were shot in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].
