[[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]'s \"[[If You Leave (song)|If You Leave]]\" became an international hit and charted at #4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in May 1986.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400 to 700 words. -->\nHigh school senior Andie Walsh lives with her underemployed working-class father, Jack, in a [[Chicago]] suburb. Andie's best friend, the outsider Phil \"Duckie\" Dale is in love with her, but is afraid to tell her how he truly feels. In school, Duckie and Andie, along with their friends, are harassed and bullied by the arrogant [[Preppy|\"richie\"]] kids, specifically Benny Hanson and her boyfriend, Steff McKee, who finds Andie attractive and secretly resents having been rejected by her.\n\nWhile working after school at a record store called TRAX, Andie starts talking about her school's senior prom to her manager, Iona, who advises Andie to go, despite not having a date. Blane McDonough, one of the preppy boys and Steff's best friend, starts talking to Andie and eventually asks her out.\n\nOn the night of the date, Andie waits for Blane at TRAX, but he is late. Duckie enters and asks Andie to go out with him, but she ignores him. When Blane arrives, Duckie becomes upset and argues with Andie before storming off. Blane brings Andie to Steff's house party, where Andie is mistreated by the rich partygoers. Andie then brings Blane to a local nightclub, where Iona is sitting with Duckie, who is hostile toward Blane. After another argument with Duckie, Andie and Blane walk out of the club. Andie tells Blane that she wants to go home, but refuses to let him bring her there, admitting that she doesn't want him to see where she lives. She eventually allows him to drop her off and he asks her to the prom and they share their first kiss. Andie visits Iona the next day to talk about the date. Meanwhile, Blane, pressured by Steff and his rich friends, begins distancing himself from Andie.\n\nJack presents Andie with a pink dress that he has bought for her. However, they begin to argue because Jack has been lying about going to a full-time job. Jack breaks down, revealing that he is still bitter and depressed about his wife having left him. At school, Andie confronts Blane for avoiding her and not returning her calls. When asked about the prom, he claims that he had already asked somebody else but had forgotten. Andie calls Blane a liar and tells him that he is ashamed of being seen with her because he knows his rich friends will not approve. Andie runs away as a teary-eyed Blane leaves, with Steff trashing Andie as he passes. Duckie overhears Steff and attacks him in the hallway. The two fight before teachers intervene. Andie goes to Iona, upset about what happened, and asks for Iona's old prom dress.\n\nUsing the fabric from Iona's dress and the dress that her father had bought, Andie creates a pink prom dress. When she arrives at the prom, Andie has second thoughts about braving the crowd on her own until she sees Duckie. They reconcile and walk into the ballroom hand in hand. As a drunk Steff begins mocking the couple, Blane confronts him and finally realizes that Steff resents Andie because she had turned down his advances. He calls Steff out on his spoiled and entitled attitude, saying that he no longer wishes to associate with him. Blane shakes Duckie's hand and apologizes to Andie, telling her that he always believed in her and that he will always love her, kissing her cheek before walking out. Duckie concedes that Blane is not like the other rich kids at school and advises Andie to go after him, joking that he will never take her to another prom if she does not. Duckie then sees a girl smiling at him, signaling him to come over and dance with her. Andie catches up with Blane in the parking lot and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Andie Walsh\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Jack Walsh\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Philip F. \"Duckie\" Dale\n* [[Annie Potts]] as Iona\n* [[James Spader]] as Steff McKee\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Blane McDonough\n* [[Kate Vernon]] as Benny Hanson\n* [[Andrew Dice Clay]] as Bouncer\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Duckette\n* [[Alexa Kenin]] as Jena Hoeman\n* [[Dweezil Zappa]] as Simon\n* [[Gina Gershon]] as Trombley\n* [[Margaret Colin]] as English teacher\n* [[Maggie Roswell]] as Mrs. Dietz\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Charlie Sheen]] was considered for the role of Blane but Ringwald convinced the filmmakers to cast McCarthy instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc7.com/archive/8833252/|title=OTRC: Andrew McCarthy talks 'Pretty In Pink' wig, travel writing: 9 facts|last=Heller|first=Corinne|website=[[KABC-TV]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013154047/http://abc7.com/archive/8833252/|archive-date=13 October 2016|access-date=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Anthony Michael Hall]] turned down the role of Duckie because he didn\u2019t want to be typecast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.today.com/today/amp/tdna76081|title = 'Pretty in Pink' turns 30: Here are 17 surprising facts about the '80s classic}}</ref> Ringwald lobbied for [[Robert Downey Jr.]] to be cast as Duckie but agreed that Cryer made sense in light of the film's revised ending.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Molly Ringwald Fought for Robert Downey Jr. to Star in 'Pretty in Pink'|url=https://www.floor8.com/posts/molly-ringwald-fought-for-robert-downey-jr-to-star-in-pretty-in-pink-01d3pdg78ffn|access-date=2020-09-06|website=floor8.com|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Jennifer Beals]] turned down the role of Andie Walsh.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2021/film/news/pretty-in-pink-john-hughes-howard-deutch-molly-ringwald-some-kind-of-wonderful-1234908094/|title = 'Pretty in Pink' Director Howard Deutch on Film's Legacy and Casting Molly Ringwald|date = 15 February 2021}}</ref> [[Jodie Foster]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Tatum O'Neal]] and [[Lori Loughlin]] were also considered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/entertainment/pretty-in-pink-original-ending-director-commentary-duckie-sexuality-molly-ringwald-222406960-015105494.html|title = 'Pretty in Pink' director on movie's famous lost ending and Molly Ringwald's theory that Duckie was secretly gay}}</ref>\n\n==Changed ending==\nOriginally, the film portrayed Andie and Duckie ending up together.<ref>[http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/80s/content/original-ending-pretty-pink-uncovered-along-other-john-hughes-scripts Original ending to 'Pretty in Pink' uncovered along with other John Hughes scripts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516041328/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/80s/content/original-ending-pretty-pink-uncovered-along-other-john-hughes-scripts |date=2013-05-16 }}, at the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''; by Steve Spears; published May 7, 2010; retrieved March 29, 2013</ref> However, [[test audience]]s booed this ending.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1328652,00.html Don't You Forget About Duckie], at ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', by Mandi Bierly; published August 24, 2006; retrieved March 29, 2013</ref> John Hughes wrote a new five-page ending where Andie and Blane get together instead.

While director Howard Deutch originally intended the film to primarily contain [[theme music]], Hughes influenced Deutch's decision to use post-punk music throughout the film. The title song by [[the Psychedelic Furs]] acted as a bit of inspiration for the film and was re-recorded specifically for the film's opening sequence in a version that was less raw than the original version that appeared on the 1981 album ''[[Talk Talk Talk]]''. \"Left of Center\" was remixed by [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]. The first track, \"If You Leave\", by [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], was written in 1985 specifically for the film. In addition to their soundtrack song \"Shellshock\", [[New Order (band)|New Order]] also contributed an instrumental version of  \"[[Thieves Like Us (song)|Thieves Like Us]]\"  and the instrumental \"[[Elegia (New Order song)|Elegia]]\", both of which appear in the film but not on the soundtrack. [[The Rave-Ups]], who appear in the film performing \"Positively Lost Me\" and \"Shut-Up\" from their ''Town and Country'' album, do not have any songs on the soundtrack album. [[Nik Kershaw]]'s \"[[Wouldn't It Be Good]]\" appears on the soundtrack in a version by former [[Three Dog Night]] [[singing|vocalist]] [[Danny Hutton]]'s band, Danny Hutton Hitters. [[The Smiths]]' \"[[Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want]]\" appears on the soundtrack and was later covered by [[the Autumns]] for the 2000 ''Isn't She Still...
