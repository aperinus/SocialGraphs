Directed by [[Jonathan Mostow]], it stars [[Bruce Willis]] as Tom Greer, an FBI agent who ventures out into the real world to investigate the murder of surrogates ([[Humanoid robot|humanoid]] [[remote-controlled robots]]). It also stars [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Rosamund Pike]], [[Boris Kodjoe]], [[Ving Rhames]], and [[James Cromwell]].\n\nThe film's main concept centers on the mysterious murder of a college student linked to the man who helped create a high-tech surrogate phenomenon that allows people to purchase remote-controlled humanoid robots through which they interact with society. These fit, attractive, remotely controlled robots ultimately assume their life roles, enabling people to experience life vicariously from the comfort and safety of their own homes. ''Surrogates'' was released on September 25, 2009, in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=39442| title=The Surrogates | work=ComingSoon.net | publisher=Coming Soon Media, L.P|access-date=July 15, 2008}}</ref> It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $122 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--The film never really states the exact date and could very well take place in the present, as the featured computers, cars and other devices are current date, as well as a search warrant shown in the film being dated in 2009.-->In the near future, widespread use of remotely controlled [[Android (robot)|androids]] called \"surrogates\" enables everyone to live in idealized forms from the safety of their homes. Compared to their surrogates, the human operators are depicted as slovenly and homebound. Protected from harm, a surrogate's operator feels no pain when the surrogate is damaged, and can do acrobatics that a normal person couldn't. In [[Boston]], [[FBI]] agent Tom Greer has been estranged from his wife Maggie since their son's death in a car crash several years before. He never sees her outside of her surrogate and she criticizes his desire to interact via their real bodies.\n\nTom and his partner, Agent Jennifer Peters, investigate the death of two people who were killed when their surrogates were destroyed at a [[Fort Point, Boston|Fort Point]] club. Jared Canter, one of the victims, is the son of Dr. Lionel Canter, the inventor of surrogates and the former head of their manufacturing company, Virtual Self Industries (VSI). The two determine that a human, Miles Strickland, used a new type of weapon to overload the surrogates' systems and kill their operators. After locating Strickland, Tom attempts to bring him into custody. Strickland uses the weapon and injures Tom during the chase; Tom inadvertently crash-lands into an anti-surrogate zone known as the Dread Reservation (one of many throughout the US). A mob helps Strickland and destroys Tom's surrogate. The Dread leader, a man known as the Prophet, kills Strickland and confiscates the weapon.\n\nWith his surrogate destroyed, Tom is forced to interact in the world without one. He learns that VSI originally produced the weapon, designed to load a virus that overloads a surrogate's systems, thus disabling it, under a government contract. Unexpectedly, the weapon also disabled the fail-safe protocols protecting operators. The project was promptly scrapped and all prototypes supposedly destroyed. Tom also learns that Andrew Stone, his FBI superior, supplied the weapon to Strickland and ordered Dr. Canter's assassination, upon VSI's request, for his criticism of surrogate use. Jared, using one of his father's many surrogates, was killed instead. Jennifer is murdered in her own home by an unknown man who hijacks her surrogate, and the Prophet orders the weapon delivered to her. During a military raid on the reservation, the Prophet is shot, revealing he was actually a surrogate, with Canter himself as the operator. Tom steals the weapon's codes from Stone, but \"Jennifer\" escapes with the codes.\n\nImmediately travelling to Canter's home, Tom discovers that Canter has been controlling not only the Prophet, but also Jennifer and the surrogate he used to kill Jennifer as well. Using Jennifer's surrogate in FBI Headquarters, Canter uses the weapon to kill Stone and proceeds to upload the virus to all surrogates, which will destroy them and kill their operators. Canter reveals that he only wanted to empower the disabled to live normal lives, but after he was fired from VSI, they capitalized on surrogacy for profit. Convinced his plan is unstoppable, Canter disconnects from Jennifer's surrogate and swallows a [[cyanide]] pill. Tom takes control of Jennifer's surrogate and, with the assistance of the network's system administrator, Bobby Saunders, insulates the virus so the operators will survive, but a second step is required to save the surrogates. After a moment of consideration, Tom chooses to let the virus permanently disable surrogates worldwide. With all the surrogates disabled, people emerge from their homes, confused and afraid.\n\nReturning home, Tom shares an emotional embrace with Maggie in her real form. The film ends with an aerial view of the collapsed surrogates along with overlapping news reports of downed surrogates all over the world and how people are now \"on their own\" again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Greer, an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent investigating the mysterious murder of a college student linked to the high-tech surrogate phenomenon.\n* [[Radha Mitchell]] as Peters, Greer's FBI partner.\n* [[Rosamund Pike]] as Maggie, Greer's wife.<ref name=three>{{cite journal| url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20188617,00.html| title=Three Cast Alongside Willis in 'Surrogates'|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time Inc]]|date=April 4, 2008|access-date=July 15, 2008}}</ref>\n* [[Jack Noseworthy]] as Strickland, a man hired to kill Lionel Canter.<ref name=\"the\"/>\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Older Canter, the reclusive inventor of the surrogates.\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as The Prophet, a human cult figure who disdains surrogates.<ref name=three/>\n* [[Boris Kodjoe]] as Stone, Peters' and Greer's supervisor at the FBI.<ref name=\"the\"/>\n* [[James Francis Ginty]] as Canter, a surrogate that belonged to Lionel Canter's son.\n* [[Michael Cudlitz]] as Colonel Brendon, an [[United States Army|Army]] colonel in charge of using surrogates in warfare.\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Bobby, the administrator of the FBI computer system that controls the surrogate network.\n* [[Helena Mattsson]] as JJ the Blonde, a blonde female surrogate for Cameron McAllister.\n* Shane Dzicek as Jarod Canter, Dr. Lionel Canter's son who is murdered by a human assassin.\n* [[Cody Christian]] as Boy Canter, an alternate surrogate that belongs to Lionel Canter.\n* [[Trevor Donovan]] as Surrie/Greer, a temporary replacement surrogate that Peters convinces Greer to try out.\n\n==Production==\nIn March 2007, [[Disney]] acquired feature film rights to the 2005\u20132006 comic book series ''[[The Surrogates]]'' with the intent to distribute under [[Touchstone Pictures]].
