The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> where the film is set. The film features the voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[will.i.am]], and [[Jamie Foxx]]. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a domesticated male [[Spix's macaw]] who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a [[cockatoo]].\n\nSaldanha developed his first story concept of ''Rio'' in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to [[Chris Wedge]] in 2006, and the project was set up at [[Blue Sky Studios|Blue Sky]]. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to study their movements.\n\n[[Taio Cruz]] contributed a song to the ''Rio'' soundtrack called \"[[Telling the World]]\".\n\n''Rio'' premiered on March 22, 2011, in [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro]], followed by its general release on April 15, 2011, by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received generally positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for the song \"Real in Rio\" at the [[84th Academy Awards]], but lost to the other nominee, \"[[Man or Muppet]]\" from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |access-date=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012 |archive-date=August 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825202636/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |url-status=live }}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Rio 2]]'', was released on April 11, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words. -->\nExotic birds are smuggled out of [[Brazil]]. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate containing a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls from a truck and is found by a child named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Fifteen years later, Blu is frequently ridiculed for being unable to fly by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by Linda's bookstore. [[ornithology|Ornithologist]] T\u00falio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] for Blu, the last known male of his species, to mate with the last known female. At T\u00falio's [[aviary]] in Rio, Blu meets his prospective mate, the fiercely independent Jewel who longs to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by orphan boy Fernando and [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] Nigel, who both work for a [[smuggler]] gang led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country quickly to sell  Blu and Jewel on the [[black market]].\n\nWhile Fernando has second thoughts, Nigel wants revenge on \"pretty birds\" after a [[parakeet]] replaced him on a television show. Blu's familiarity with cages sees him escape to the jungle with Jewel. Fernando helps Linda and T\u00falio search for the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet the [[toco toucan]] Rafael, whose [[bulldog]] friend, Luiz, will remove the legcuffs holding them together. Rafael tries to teach Blu to fly. They meet [[red-crested cardinal]] Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. Nigel coerces a horde of [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico take the macaws to a [[samba]] dance party, where they begin to fall in love, until the marmosets arrive. The five birds escape on a [[tram]].\n\nAt the smugglers' hideout Fernando, Linda, and T\u00falio discover the birds are no longer there. Henchmen Armando and Tipa reveal they plan to use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to take the birds to the airport. Blu and the others meet Luiz, who breaks the chain holding Blu and Jewel together. Once released, Jewel flies happily into the sky with the others. Hurt, Blu goes to look for Linda, but Jewel does not want to leave Blu behind. After a brief argument, they go their separate ways.\n\nWhen Nigel captures Jewel, Blu and Rafael rush to the carnival to rescue her. As Linda and T\u00falio pose as dancers in Spix's macaw costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. The smugglers take off in their aircraft. Blu breaks out his cage and releases the other birds. Nigel injures Jewel's wing. Blu sends Nigel into the plane's propellers and the plane to begin to fall. The smugglers jump from the plane while Jewel falls out of the open cargo hatch. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu discovers he can fly. He and Jewel kiss and he carries her to Linda and T\u00falio.\n\nLinda and T\u00falio adopt Fernando and live in their jungle sanctuary. Blu and Jewel raise three chicks together and celebrate with Rafael, Nico, Pedro, Luiz, Linda, and T\u00falio, who have set up a branch of Blu and Linda's Minnesota bookstore in Rio. Nigel has survived the plane crash, but Mauro ridicules him for losing his feathers. The smugglers are sent to jail.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Blu, a male [[Spix's macaw]] who was born in Rio de Janeiro but raised in [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], after he was smuggled.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from the Amazon Jungle, but was taken into Rio de Janeiro.\n* [[will.i.am]] as Pedro, a [[red-crested cardinal]] who is Nico's best friend.\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Nico, a [[yellow canary]] who is Pedro's best friend, loves to [[samba]], and whose bottlecap hat functions as a tambourine.\n* [[George Lopez]] as Rafael, a romantic, wise, and energetic [[toco toucan]] who is fond of Carnival and Eva's mate.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Luiz, a [[bulldog]] who is Rafael's friend and a [[chainsaw]] expert who has a medical condition of drooling.\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] who used to be a TV star, but was replaced by a Parakeet, causing him to have a strong hatred for \"pretty birds.\"\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Linda Gunderson, a girl who discovered Blu after he was taken from Rio de Janeiro to Moose Lake and adopted him for 15 years.\n** Sofia Scarpa Saldanha as Young Linda Gunderson\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Dr. T\u00falio Monteiro, a Brazilian ornithologist who befriends Linda.
