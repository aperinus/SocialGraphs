Adapted from the [[Stage Door (play)|play of the same name]], it tells the story of several would-be actresses who live together in a boarding house at 158 West 58th Street in [[New York City]]. The film stars [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Gail Patrick]], [[Constance Collier]], [[Andrea Leeds]], [[Samuel S. Hinds]] and [[Lucille Ball]]. [[Eve Arden]] and [[Ann Miller]], who became notable in later films, play minor characters.\n\nThe film was adapted by [[Morrie Ryskind]] and [[Anthony Veiller]] from the play by [[Edna Ferber]] and [[George S. Kaufman]], but the play's storyline and the characters' names were almost completely changed for the movie, so much so in fact that Kaufman joked the film should be called \"Screen Door\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Stage-Door-1937.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''Stage Door'']]\nTerry Randall ([[Katharine Hepburn]]) moves into the Footlights Club,<ref>Inspired by the real-life [[Rehearsal Club (New York)|Rehearsal Club]], according to [[Robert Osborne]], host of [[Turner Classic Movies]]</ref> a theatrical boarding house in New York. Her polished manners and superior attitude make her no friends among the rest of the aspiring actresses living there, particularly her new roommate, flippant, cynical dancer Jean Maitland ([[Ginger Rogers]]). From Terry's expensive clothing and her photograph of her elderly grandfather, Jean assumes she has obtained the former from her [[wikt:sugar daddy|sugar daddy]], just as fellow resident Linda Shaw ([[Gail Patrick]]) has from her relationship with influential theatrical producer Anthony Powell ([[Adolphe Menjou]]). In truth, Terry comes from a wealthy Midwest family. Over the strong objections of her father, Henry Sims ([[Samuel S. Hinds]]), she is determined to try to fulfill her dreams. In the boarding house, Terry's only supporter is aging actress Anne Luther ([[Constance Collier]]), who appoints herself Terry's mentor and acting coach.\n\nWhen Powell sees Jean dancing, he decides to dump Linda. He arranges for Jean and her partner Annie ([[Ann Miller]]) to get hired for the floor show of a nightclub he partly owns. He then starts dating Jean, who starts falling for him.\n\nMeanwhile, well-liked Kay Hamilton ([[Andrea Leeds]]) had great success and rave reviews in a play the year before but has had no work since and is running out of money. She clings desperately to the hope of landing the leading role in Powell's new play, ''Enchanted April''. She finally gets an appointment to see Powell, only to have him cancel. She faints in the reception area, the result of malnutrition and disappointment. Seeing this, Terry barges into Powell's private office and berates him for his callousness.  As a result, the other boarding house residents start to warm up to the newcomer.\n\nTerry's father secretly finances ''Enchanted April'' on the condition that Terry is given the starring role, hoping she will fail and return home. Powell invites Terry to his penthouse to break the news. When Jean shows up unannounced, Terry sees the opportunity to save her friend from the philandering Powell. She pretends that Powell is trying to seduce her. It works. However, it makes things uncomfortable around the boarding house. Terry's landing on the plum part breaks Kay's heart.\n\nThe inexperienced Terry is so woodenly bad during rehearsals that Powell tries to get out of his contract with Sims. On opening night, after she learns from Jean that Kay has committed suicide, Terry decides she cannot go on. Anne Luther tells her that she must, not just for herself and the tradition of the theatre, but also for Kay. She does and gives a heartfelt performance. She and the play are a hit, much to the chagrin of her father, who is in the audience. At her [[curtain call]], Terry gives a speech in tribute to her dead friend, and Terry and Jean are reconciled. The play remains a success after months, but Terry continues to board at the Footlights Club. A newcomer shows up looking for a room.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| '''[[File:Katharine Hepburn in Stage Door trailer.jpg|120px]]''' ||[[Katharine Hepburn]] <br/>as Terry Randall\n|| '''[[File:Ginger Rogers in Stage Door trailer.jpg|120px]]''' ||[[Ginger Rogers]] <br/>as Jean Maitland\n|-\n| '''[[File:Adolphe Menjou in Stage Door trailer.jpg|120px]]''' ||[[Adolphe Menjou]] <br/>as Anthony Powell\n|| '''[[File:Gail Patrick in Stage Door trailer.jpg|120px]]''' ||[[Gail Patrick]] <br/>as Linda Shaw\n|-\n| '''[[File:Constance Collier in Stage Door trailer.jpg|120px]]''' ||[[Constance Collier]] <br/>as Anne Luther\n|| '''[[File:Andrea Leeds in Stage Door trailer.jpg|120px]]''' ||[[Andrea Leeds]] <br/>as Kay Hamilton\n|-\n| '''[[File:Samuel S Hinds in Stage Door trailer.jpg|120px]]''' ||[[Samuel S.

Director [[Gregory La Cava]] also allowed the actresses to ad lib during filming.{{Citation needed|reason=The IMDb trivia section is not a reliable source.|date=December 2020}} Hepburn's famous lines during the play within the film, \"The calla lilies are in bloom again. Such a strange flower, suitable to any occasion. I carried them on my wedding day and now I place them here in memory of something that has died,\" are from ''[[The Lake (play)|The Lake]]'' (1934), the play for which [[Dorothy Parker]] panned Hepburn's performance as \"running the gamut of emotions from A to B.\"<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/09/26/gamut-emotion/| title=She Runs the Gamut of Emotions from A to B| last=O'Toole| first=Garson| date=September 27, 2013| website=[[Quote Investigator]]| access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe movie has almost nothing to do with the play, except in a few character names, such as Kay Hamilton, Jean Maitland, Terry Randall, Linda Shaw, and Judith Canfield. In the play, Terry Randall is from a rural family whose father is a country doctor, and Jean Maitland is actually a shallow girl who becomes a movie star. Kay Hamilton does commit suicide, but for completely different reasons and not on an opening night.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received very good reviews and was a moderate success at the box office. The reviewer in ''[[The Times]]'' wrote of January 3, 1938, after the film's London premiere at the [[Odeon Marble Arch|Regal]] on December 31, 1937:\n{{blockquote|text=Stories of life on the stage have always appealed to Hollywood: here success is sensational and meteoric, and failure equally sudden and dramatic. We know the formula by heart, and expect of our entertainment that it shall be rowdy, aggressive, and spectacular, culminating in the rise of the central character to fame in the bright lights of Broadway. ''Stage Door'' is rowdy and aggressive, and it does end in success for one of its characters and failure for another, but for all that it is a film of unusual insight and characterization. (...) The dialogue is brilliant, with typical American point and brevity, but nearly always spiteful and cruel, for these girls are the product of a hard environment. Three stand out from among the rest: Miss Katharine Hepburn (...) Miss Ginger Rogers (...) Miss Andrea Leeds.| source=\"New films in London: Back-stage tragedy\", ''[[The Times]]'', January 3, 1938, p. 10.}}\n\nHepburn's four movies preceding ''Stage Door'' had been commercial failures. However, as a result of the positive response to this performance, RKO immediately cast her opposite [[Cary Grant]] in the screwball comedy ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938).\n\n''Stage Door'' made a small profit of $81,000.<ref name=\"rko\"/>\n\n===Academy Awards===\n{{Main|10th Academy Awards}}\n;Nominations<ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/search/results \"Stage Door\"] Oscars: Awards Database {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20131120195241/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1384922394087# |date=November 20, 2013}}.
