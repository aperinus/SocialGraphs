The film stars [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], and [[Sydney Pollack]], in his final screen appearance prior to his death less than a month after the film's release.\n\nThe plot follows a lifelong [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] who falls in love with his best friend, only to have her get engaged and ask him to be her [[maid of honor]]. It was released by [[Columbia Pictures]] in the United States on May 2, 2008. The film garnered negative reviews from critics who criticized the formulaic humor and script, but grossed $106.4 million worldwide against a $40 million budget making it a box office success. It was released on [[DVD]] on September 16, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Halloween night, 1998, at [[Cornell University]], Tom Bailey, Jr., dressed as [[Bill Clinton]], slips into bed with his pre-arranged date, Monica. It turns out to be her roommate Hannah. Tom likes her because she is honest and does not fling herself at him. Ten years later, they are best friends. He is wealthy, as he invented the \"[[coffee cup sleeve|coffee collar]]\" and gets a dime every time it is used. Tom is with a different girl every week, while Hannah focuses on her career at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. He is very content with life, and thinks she is too.\n\nAfter taking Hannah to his father's sixth wedding, she tells Tom she must go to Scotland for work. He discovers that without her, being with a different woman week after week is not fulfilling. Realizing he loves her, he decides to confess his feelings when she gets back. Upon returning, Hannah surprisingly introduces Colin, a wealthy Scot, as her fianc\u00e9. She asks Tom to be her maid of honor and Tom decides to do it upon his other friends' advice, to spend time with her, convincing her to marry him instead.\n\nHe is introduced to the other three bridesmaids. One is Melissa, Hannah's cousin and a disgruntled ex. She hates him even more when she doesn't get to be the maid of honor. So, when Tom throws the bridal shower, Melissa sabotages it by giving him a business card for entertainment, which turns out to be for a sex toy party. Hannah gets upset and leaves. Again seeking advice from his other friends, they teach him what a maid of honor must remember. The next day, he takes Hannah shopping, impressing her. Afterwards, she tells him she is moving to Scotland with Colin after the wedding.\n\nAfter arriving in Scotland at [[Eilean Donan|Eilean Donan Castle]], Tom realizes he is running out of time to stop Hannah. He meets Colin's family and must participate in a variant of the [[Highland Games]], in which the groom competes to prove himself worthy of his bride. He also competes, but loses in the last round. Tom takes Hannah out for a walk, planning to tell her his feelings. The other bridesmaids interrupt for Hannah's [[bachelorette party]]. On her Hen Night, Hannah sells her kisses for change in a pub. As she goes around, Tom kisses Hannah. Though it starts as a peck on the cheek, it becomes a passionate kiss.\n\nThat night, when Hannah tries to ask Tom about the kiss, her drunk cousin is in his room, trying to have sex with him. Hannah leaves and Tom runs after her. Then he knocks on her door, pleading for her to let him in. She refuses and asks about the kiss. He tells her he knows he, not Colin, is the one for her. She refuses to cave in and instead tells Tom she will still marry Colin the next day. He cannot watch Hannah and Colin get married so he decides to go home.\n\nWhen questioned about Tom's sudden departure shortly before the wedding, Hannah informs Colin he is just afraid of losing her. On the way home, Tom realizes that he must stop the wedding and goes back on horseback. Just as the priest asks for objections, Tom is sent flying with his horse and through the chapel doors. Seeing her best friend on the floor, Hannah rushes to him. As he struggles to stand up, he tells her that he loves her more than anything and that she should marry him. They then share a kiss. Hannah tells Colin that she is very sorry and that he is the perfect guy, just not for her. Colin's aunt then tells Colin, in [[Scots language|Scots]], to punch Tom, which he does immediately.\n\nHannah and Tom eventually get married. Melissa catches the bouquet and then links arms with Tom's dad. On their honeymoon, Tom turns on the light just to make sure he has got the right girl and Hannah replies \"You do\". They kiss and Hannah turns off the light, Tom saying \"Oh, Monica\" and Hannah replies \"Oh, Bill.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Tom\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Hannah\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as Colin\n* [[Kathleen Quinlan]] as Joan\n* [[Sydney Pollack]] as Thomas Sr.\n* [[Chris Messina (actor)|Chris Messina]] as Dennis\n* [[Busy Philipps]] as Melissa\n* [[Whitney Cummings]] as Stephanie\n* [[Christine Barger]] as PsychoBlogger\n* [[Kevin Sussman]] as the tiny shorts guy\n* Richmond Arquette as Gary\n* [[Kadeem Hardison]] as Felix\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\nThe filming schedule was 26 days to accommodate [[Patrick Dempsey]]'s commitments to [[Grey's Anatomy]].
