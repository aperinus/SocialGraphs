Based on [[Colin Wilson]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The Space Vampires]]'', the film portrays the events that unfold after a trio of humanoids in a state of [[suspended animation]] are brought to Earth after being discovered in the hold of an alien space ship by the crew of a European Space Shuttle.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lifeforce | url=http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/lifeforce | publisher=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] | access-date=27 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film received negative reviews on release and was a box office failure, but has since become a [[Cult following|cult film]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2013/06/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-tobe-hoopers-underseen-lifeforce-96723/|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Tobe Hooper's Underseen 'Lifeforce'|last1=Taylor|first1=Drew|date=2013-06-21|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/citypaper/bcp-cms-1-1378560-migrated-story-cp-20120926-film2-20120926-story.html|title=A cult classic featuring naked space vampires |last=Gardner|first=Lee|website=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/241279|title=Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce: Space Vampires, Comets, and Nudity |website=[[Den of Geek]] |language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe crew of the joint British and American [[Space Shuttle]] ''Churchill'', under the command of Colonel Tom Carlsen, finds a {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} spaceship hidden in the [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] of [[Halley's Comet]]. Inside, the crew discovers hundreds of desiccated bat-like creatures and three naked humanoid bodies (two male and one female) in [[suspended animation]] within glass containers. The crew recovers a bat-alien and the three bodies and begins the return trip to Earth. However, during the return journey, [[mission control]] loses contact with ''Churchill''. A rescue mission is launched to investigate.\n\nThe rescuers discover that ''Churchill'' has been gutted by fire. The present crew are dead, and the escape pod is missing, yet the three containers bearing the bodies remain intact. The bodies are taken to the European Space Research Centre in London. Prior to an [[autopsy]], the female alien awakens and drains the life force out of a guard. She then escapes the facility and proceeds to drain other humans of their life force. The two male vampires awaken and attempt a violent escape, but they are apparently destroyed by grenades thrown by the guards. Soon after, the guard revives two hours after his death and also displays the ability to drain others of their life force.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, an [[escape pod]] from ''Churchill'' is found with Carlsen inside. Carlsen is flown to London, where he describes the course of events, including feeling compelled to open the female vampire's container and share his life force with her, culminating in the draining of the ''Churchill'' crew's life force. Carlsen explains that he set fire to the shuttle with the intention of saving Earth from the same fate and escaped in the pod. However, when he is hypnotised, it becomes clear that Carlsen possesses a [[telepathy|psychic link]] to the female alien, and he reveals her ability to [[shapeshift]]. Carlsen and [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Colonel Colin Caine trace her to a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Yorkshire]]. The two believe they have managed to trap her within the heavily sedated body of the hospital's manager, Dr. Armstrong. Carlsen and Caine later learn they were deceived, as the aliens had wanted to draw them out of London.\n\nThe two male vampires have survived by shapeshifting into the soldiers who killed their previous bodies, and now the pair are infecting most of London's population. As Carlsen and Caine are transporting Dr. Armstrong back to London, the female alien escapes from her sedated host and disappears. [[Martial law]] is declared as the vampire plague sweeps through the city; the victims seeking out other humans to absorb their life force and perpetuate the cycle. The absorbed life forces are channeled by the male vampires to the female vampire, who transmits the accumulated energy to their spaceship, which is now in [[geosynchronous orbit]] over London.\n\nDr. Fallada impales one of the male vampires with an ancient weapon of \"leaded iron\". He contacts Carlsen and Caine and surmises that the creatures have visited Earth periodically with the coming of Halley's Comet, creating the vampire legends. He delivers the weapon to Caine before succumbing to the infection. The female vampire is tracked by Carlsen to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], where she is lying upon the altar, transferring energy to her spaceship. She reveals, much to Carlsen's shock, that they are a part of each other due to the sharing of their life forces, thus sharing their psychic bond. Caine follows Carlsen to the cathedral and is intercepted by the second male vampire, whom he kills. Caine throws the weapon to Carlsen, who impales himself and the female alien simultaneously. This action causes the release of a burst of energy that blows open the dome of St. Paul's. The two ascend the column of energy to the spaceship, which then returns to the comet as Caine watches.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Steve Railsback]] as Col.

The other two films are the remake of ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' and ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Macor |first=Alison | title=Chainsaws, Slackers, and Spy Kids |publisher=University of Texas Press |date=2010 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBQ_FGDKiSkC |isbn=978-0-292-77829-0}}</ref>\n\nFilming began on 2 February 1984. Before Hooper was finally approved, [[Michael Winner]] was offered the chance to direct the film.<ref name=\"fun\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grindhousedatabase.com/index.php/Lifeforce/Fun_Facts|title=Lifeforce/Fun Facts|date=20 July 2016|work=The Grindhouse Cinema Database|access-date=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film was originally filmed and promoted under the same title as the Colin Wilson novel. Cannon Films, which reportedly spent nearly $25&nbsp;million in hopes of creating a blockbuster film, disliked ''[[The Space Vampires]]'' for sounding too much like another of the studio's typical low budget exploitation films.<ref name=\"Scapperotti\">{{cite journal|last=Scapperotti|first=Dan|title=The Hooper on Lifeforce|journal=Cinefantastique|location=Oak Park|date=July 1985}}</ref> As a result, the title was changed to ''Lifeforce'', referring to the spiritual energy the space vampires drain from their victims, and it was edited for its US theatrical release by [[TriStar Pictures]] into a 101-minute domestic cut that was partially re-scored by [[Michael Kamen]], with a majority of [[Henry Mancini]]'s original music remaining.\n\nIt has been suggested that ''Lifeforce'' is largely a remake of [[Hammer Film Productions]]'s ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]''. In an interview, director Tobe Hooper discussed how Cannon Films gave him $25 million, free rein, and Colin Wilson's book ''[[The Space Vampires]]''. Hooper then shares how giddy he was: \"I thought I'd go back to my roots and make a 70 mm Hammer film.\"<ref>''The Making of Lifeforce'' (2013) documentary, by filmmakers Calum Waddel and Naomi Holwill, included on the ''Lifeforce'' Blu-Ray.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Thomas Kent|title=Mars in the Movies: A History|location=Jefferson|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2016|isbn=9780786499144}} p. 180</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last1=Migliore|first1=Andrew |first2=John |last2=Strysik|title=Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H.P.

Hooper came up with the idea of using [[Halley's Comet]] in the screenplay, rather than the asteroid belt as originally used in the novel, as the comet was going to pass by Earth one year following the film's release. The time settings were also changed from the mid-21st century to the present day.<ref name=\"Scapperotti\"/> [[Michael Armstrong (filmmaker)|Michael Armstrong]] and [[Olaf Pooley]] were brought on during production to perform uncredited rewrites, Armstrong acting as a liaison between Hooper and the art department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/cathode-ray-tube/lifeforce-special-edition-blu-ray-review-e8d6f316a83c|title=Lifeforce\u2014Special Edition Blu-Ray / Review|last=Collins|first=Frank|date=27 August 2017|website=Cathode Ray Tube|access-date=17 April 2018|via=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2020}}\n\nHooper later said, \"The spirit of the book is certainly there from my interpretation of the reading. Though Colin Wilson's novel was set in the future, I made it a contemporary piece for identification. Also, I tied in Halley's comet, where they make the find of the alien ship. It has been millions of years in the coma of Halley's comet, traveling as a parasite of sorts. But, basically, I think the movie embodies the same spiritual feeling that Colin Wilson intended.\"<ref name=\"ac\">Bealmear, Robert (June 1985). \"Eerie Effects for LIFEFORCE\". ''American Cinematographer''; Hollywood Vol. 66, Iss. 6. pp. 60\u201367.</ref>\n\nColin Wilson was unhappy with the way the film turned out. He wrote of it, \"[[John Fowles]] had once told me that the film of ''[[The Magus (film)|The Magus]]'' was the worst movie ever made. After seeing ''Lifeforce'' I sent him a postcard telling him that I had gone one better.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Colin |title=Dreaming to Some Purpose |publisher=[[Random House]] |date=2011 |page=332 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCvrS9DjE68C |isbn=9781446473603}}</ref>\n\nHooper later said \"''Lifeforce'' had a great look but lacked a screenplay. There wasn't a hell of a lot that could be done  about that except to change it completely. The film started off as ''Space Vampires'', and that's actually what it should've been called. With that title you'd look at that picture with a completely different set of sunglasses!\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/Monsterland_10_June_1986_c2c_Ragman-Dregs/page/n32/mode/1up/search/lifeforce+?q=lifeforce+%22tobe+hooper%22|magazine=Monsterland|date=10 June 1986|page=32|title=Tobe Hooper Director from Mars|first=Ron|last=Magid}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nIn February 1984, [[Billy Idol]] said he had been offered a lead role as a vampire by Hooper, who had directed the video of \"[[Dancing with Myself]]\", but turned it down due to touring commitments.<ref>Pop Eye: The Looters Look Inside Nicaragua\nGoldstein, Patrick.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 1 June 1985: 3.</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\nThe film marked the fourth project to feature [[special effects]] produced by [[Academy Award]] winner [[John Dykstra]], who in 1986 was granted with the \"Caixa Catalunya Award for Best Special Effects\" in the [[Sitges Film Festival]] (located in Spain) for his special effects work in ''Lifeforce''.{{efn|This award (presented annually) is the Special Effects Award attributed by the Sitges Film Festival, but its name has changed among years, depending on different sponsors.

It took a week to film the death scene of the pathologist played by Jerome Willis, and [[bodycast]]s of Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart and [[Aubrey Morris]] were made by make-up effects supervisor [[Nick Maley]] for their death scenes.\n\nOne effect near the end of the film involving the column of energy rising from the female alien through the top of St. Paul's Cathedral to the spacecraft was engineered by art director [[Tony Reading]]. A column of [[Retroreflective sheeting|retroreflective material]] was placed against black velvet and a crew member blew cigar smoke into its bottom. This image was then [[Front projection effect|front projected]] onto a translucent projection screen behind the actors to create the energy column.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rizzo |first=Michael |title=The Art Direction Handbook for Film |publisher=CRC Press |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lv05yGXskQQC&pg=PT134 |isbn=9780240806808}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[James Horner]] was first asked to write the score before [[Henry Mancini]] was brought in and produced a score consisting of 90 minutes of occasionally [[atonal]] and ambient music using the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name=\"Caps\">{{cite book |last=Caps |first=John |title=Henry Mancini: Reinventing Film Music |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |date=2012 |pages=193\u201398 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QK6UmDGh2V4C&pg=PA193 |isbn=9780252093845}}</ref> Mancini had agreed to do the film based on the original concept of a 15-minute essentially dialogue-free opening sequence involving the discovery and exploration of the alien spacecraft and the moving of the three aliens back to the ''Churchill'', for which he composed a tonal \"space ballet\".<ref name=\"Caps\"/>\n\nFor the American domestic version, [[Michael Kamen]] and [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]] were asked to write occasional music cues that were placed in at the last minute.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moviemusicuk.us/2015/07/02/lifeforce-henry-mancini/|title=Lifeforce \u2013 Henry Mancini|date=2 July 2015|work=Movie Music UK|access-date=17 April 2018|first=Jonathan|last=Broxton}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://comingsoon.net/horror/features/786489-sound-shock-the-music-of-lifeforce|title=Sound Shock: The Music of Lifeforce|date=16 November 2016|work=ComingSoon.net|access-date=17 April 2018|publisher=[[CraveOnline Media]]|first=Chris|last=Alexander}}</ref><ref name=variety/>\n\n===Editing and post-production===\nThe initial cut of ''Lifeforce'' as edited by Tobe Hooper was 128 minutes long. This is 12 minutes longer than the final version which had several scenes cut, most of them taking place on the Space Shuttle ''Churchill''. According to [[Nicholas Ball (actor)|Nicholas Ball]], who played the main British astronaut, Derebridge, it was felt that there was too much material in outer space and so the majority of the ''Churchill'' scenes were deleted. Also, most of Nicholas Ball's performance ended up on the [[cutting room floor]] according to an interview he gave on the UK talk show ''[[Wogan]]'' in 1985.\n\nAccording to interviews with Bill Malin, who plays one of the male vampires, the film went over schedule during production. Because of this some important scenes were never shot, and the film was shut down at one time because the studio had simply run out of money.<ref name=\"fun\"/>\n\nDespite being credited on the US domestic cut, the following actors were deleted from that cut of the film: [[John Woodnutt]], [[John Forbes-Robertson (actor)|John Forbes-Robertson]] and Russell Sommers. The ''Churchill'' [[commanding officer]] Rawlins, played by Geoffrey Frederick, was British, but in [[post-production]] it was decided that [[Patrick Jordan]] would dub his voice. Also in the US version, some of Geoffrey Frederick's voiceover heard on the ''Churchill'' is dubbed.\n\n==Release==\n''Lifeforce'' was released on 21 June 1985 to poor box office returns.<ref name=\"caulfield\" /> The film opened in fourth place, losing a head-to-head battle against [[Ron Howard]]'s science fiction film, ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''.
