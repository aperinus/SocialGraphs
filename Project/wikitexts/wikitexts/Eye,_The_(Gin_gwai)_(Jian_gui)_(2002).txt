The film spawned two sequels by the Pang brothers, ''[[The Eye 2]]'' and ''[[The Eye 10]]''. There are three remakes of this film, including ''[[Adhu]]'', made in 2004 in [[Tamil film|Tamil]], ''[[Naina (2005 film)|Naina]]'' made in 2005 in Hindi and ''[[The Eye (2008 film)|The Eye]]'', a 2008 Hollywood production starring [[Jessica Alba]].\n\n==Plot==\nBlind since the age of five, 20-year-old [[Hong Kong]] classical violinist Wong Kar Mun undergoes an [[Corneal transplantation|eye cornea transplant]] after receiving a pair of new eyes from a donor. Initially, she is glad to have her sight restored but becomes troubled when she starts seeing mysterious figures that seem to foretell gruesome deaths. The night before her discharge from the hospital, she sees a shadowy figure accompanying a patient out of the room and the next morning the patient is pronounced dead.\n\nMun goes to see her doctor's nephew, Dr. Wah, a psychotherapist, about the strange entities that she has been seeing. He is skeptical at first, but as he gradually develops a closer relationship with her, he decides to accompany her on a trip to northern [[Thailand]] to find Ling, the eye donor. When they ask a village doctor about Ling and her family, he is unwilling to reveal anything but becomes more cooperative when Mun tells him that she sees what Ling used to see. Apparently, Ling had a psychic ability that allowed her to foresee death and disaster. However, her fellow villagers misunderstood her as a jinx and refused to trust her. Once, Ling tried to warn the people about an imminent disaster, but they drove her away in disbelief. When her vision came true, she felt guilty about the deaths and hanged herself. Ling's mother is both depressed and angry with her daughter and has never forgiven Ling for committing suicide, until one night Ling's spirit possesses Mun and attempts suicide. Ling's mother saves Mun and breaks down, saying that she has forgiven Ling and Ling's spirit leaves in peace.\n\nOn the return journey, their bus is caught in a traffic jam and Mun sees hundreds of ghostly figures lumbering on the road. Believing that a catastrophe is approaching, she runs out of the bus and tries to warn everyone to leave, but no one understands her and think that she is insane. In fact, the traffic jam is due to a tank truck that has toppled over and is blocking the road. The truck starts leaking natural gas but nobody notices it. A driver restarts his engine and ignites the gas, causing a chain explosion. Dr. Wah saves Mun from death by shielding her with his body, but Mun is already blinded by glass fragments. In the epilogue, a blind Mun is seen roaming the streets of Hong Kong. Although she has lost her sense of sight again, she is happy that she now has the support and friendship of Dr. Wah.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Angelica Lee]] as Wong Kar Mun\n**Cusnithorn Chotiphan as young Mun\n*[[Lawrence Chou]] as Dr. Wah\n*Chutcha Rujinanon as Chiu Wai-ling\n**Tassanana Nuntasaree as Ling (4 years old)\n**Damronowiseeatpanich as Ling (8 years old)\n*So Yat-lai as Yingying\n*[[Candy Lo]] as Yee (Mun's sister)\n**Dampcingcingtrakulsawadee as young Yee\n*Ko Yin-ping as Mun's grandmother\n*[[Pierre Png]] as Dr Eak\n*[[Edmund Chen]] as Dr Lo\n\n==Production==\n''The Eye'' is a co-production of [[MediaCorp Raintree Pictures]] in Singapore and Applause Pictures of Hong Kong, and was shot in Hong Kong and Thailand with a pan-Asian cast and crew, including Malaysian actress [[Angelica Lee]], Chinese-Canadian singer [[Lawrence Chou]], Singaporean singer-actor [[Pierre Png]] and Thai actress Chutcha Rujinanon.<ref name = \"Eyeing\">Ho, Karl. 9 August 2002. \"Eyeing a trend\", Straits Times/Asia News Network via Nation Weekend, page 8 (print edition).</ref> The crew included Thai cinematographer Decha Seementa and the Thai music collective Orange Music provided the score.\n\nDanny and Oxide Pang said they were inspired to write the screenplay for ''The Eye'' by a report they had seen in a Hong Kong newspaper 13 years before, about a 16-year-old girl who had received a [[Corneal transplantation|corneal transplant]] and committed suicide soon after.\n\n\"We'd always wondered what the girl saw when she regained her eyesight finally and what actually made her want to end her life\", Oxide said in an interview.<ref name = \"Seeing\">Ho, Karl. 9 August 2002. \"Seeing dead people\", Straits Times/Asia News Network via Nation Weekend, page 8 (print edition).</ref>\n\nAt the end, the scene with the accident, is based on an actual event from [[1990 Bangkok gas explosion]] on New Petchburi Road on 24 September 1990.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ancuta |first=Katarzyna |date=2016 |chapter=That\u2019s the Spirit!: Horror Films as an Extension of Thai Supernaturalism |title=Ghost Movies in Southeast Asia and Beyond: Narratives, Cultural Contexts, Audiences |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NC7ODAAAQBAJ |publisher=BRILL |page=127 |isbn=9789004323643 |quote=...turned to the infamous 1990 LPG tanker explosion on New Petchabure Rd. in Bangkok for inspiration.}}</ref> It killed 88 people, injured 36 people, 67 cars were destroyed and total damage was 215 million baht.\n\n==Release==\n''The Eye'' was released in Hong Kong on 9 May 2002 and in Singapore on 27 June 2002.
