The film's narrative is circular and repeats several motifs, including a flower on a long driveway, a key falling, a door unlocked, a knife in a loaf of bread, a mysterious [[Grim Reaper]]\u2013like cloaked figure with a mirror for a face, a phone off the hook and an ocean. Through creative editing, distinct camera angles, and slow motion, the surrealist film depicts a world in which it is more and more difficult to catch reality.\n\nIn 1990, ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", going into the registry in the second year of voting. In 2015 the BBC named the film the 40th greatest American movie ever made.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films \"The 100 Greatest American Films\"], [[BBC|BBC Culture]], July 20, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Meshes of the Afternoon (1943).webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=10|''Meshes of the Afternoon'']]\nA woman ([[Maya Deren]]) sees someone on the street as she is walking back to her home. She goes to her room and sleeps on a chair. As soon as she is asleep, she experiences a dream in which she repeatedly tries to chase a mysterious hooded figure with a mirror for a face but is unable to catch it. With each failure, she re-enters her house and sees numerous household objects including a key, a bread knife, a flower, a telephone and a phonograph. The woman follows the hooded figure to her bedroom where she sees the figure hide the knife under a pillow. Throughout the story, she sees multiple instances of herself, all bits of her dream that she has already experienced. The woman tries to kill her sleeping body with a knife but is awakened by a man ([[Alexander Hammid]]). The man leads her to the bedroom and she realizes that everything she saw in the dream was actually happening. She notices that the man's posture is similar to that of the hooded figure when it hid the knife under the pillow.  She attempts to injure him and fails. Towards the end of the film the man walks into the house and sees a broken mirror being dropped onto wet ground. He then sees the woman in the chair, who was previously sleeping, but is now dead.\n\n==Background and production==\nThe film was the product of Deren's and Hammid's desire to create an [[avant garde]] personal film that dealt with devastating psychological problems, like the French [[surrealist]] films of the 1920s such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (1929) and ''[[L'Age d'Or]]'' (1930).\n\nDeren and Hammid wrote, directed and performed in the film. Although Deren is usually credited as its principal artistic creator, filmmaker [[Stan Brakhage]], who knew the couple, has claimed in his book ''Film at Wit's End'' that ''Meshes'' was in fact largely Hammid's creation, and that their marriage began to suffer when Deren received more credit. Other sources claim that Alexander Hammid's role in the creation of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' is mainly as cameraperson. Maya Deren made extensive storyboards for all of her films including camera movements and camera effects. She wrote about these techniques in professional filmmaking magazines. The ideas and execution of the film are mostly attributable to Deren. Hammid also acknowledged Deren as the sole creator of ''Meshes of the Afternoon''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=VeVe A. |last2=Hudson |first2=Millicent |last3=Neiman |first3=Catrina |editor1-last=Melton |editor1-first=Hollis |title=The Legend of Maya Deren: A Documentary Biography and Collected Works |date=1988 |publisher=Anthology Film Archive/Film Culture |location=New York City |isbn=0-911689-17-6 |edition=Volume 1 Part Two}}</ref>\n\nThe original print had no score. However, a musical score influenced by classical [[Japanese music]] was added in 1959 by Deren's third husband, [[Teiji Ito]].<ref name=Robert /><ref name=Senses>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/deren-2/ |title=Great Directors: Maya Deren |first=Wendy |last=Haslem |journal=Senses of Cinema |issue=23 |date=12 December 2002 |access-date=19 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=Zeitgeist>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/films/inthemirrorofmayaderen/presskit.pdf |title=In the Mirror of Maya Deren |website=Zeitgeist Films |access-date=19 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606075957/http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/films/inthemirrorofmayaderen/presskit.pdf |archive-date=June 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\nIn the early 1970s, [[J. Hoberman]] claimed that ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' was \"less related to European surrealism\" and more related to \"Hollywood wartime ''[[film noir]]''\".<ref name=village>{{cite book |last1=Hoberman |first1=J. |title=The Village Voice Film Guide: 50 Years of Movies from Classics to Cult Hits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yHcIp0sa6MkC&pg=PA171 |publisher=[[Wiley & Sons]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |date=2007 |page=171 |isbn=9780471787815 |access-date=9 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nDeren explained that ''Meshes'' \"...is concerned with the interior experiences of an individual. It does not record an event which could be witnessed by other persons. Rather, it reproduces the way in which the subconscious of an individual will develop, interpret and elaborate an apparently simple and casual incident into a critical emotional experience.\"<ref name=dvd>{{cite AV media |people=Deren, Maya (director) |title=Maya Deren: experimental films |medium=DVD |location=New York |date=2002 |publisher=Mystic Fire Video}}</ref>\n\n===Lewis Jacobs's discussion===\n<!-- This section has been ported from the Maya Deren biography page as it is more appropriate to the article on the film itself. -->\n\nWriting about ''Meshes of the Afternoon'', Lewis Jacobs credits Maya Deren with being the first film maker since the end of the [[World War II|war]] to \"inject a fresh note into experimental film production\".<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite journal |last1=Jacobs |first1=Lewis |title=Experimental Cinema in America (Part Two: The Postwar Revival) |journal=Hollywood Quarterly |date=Spring 1948 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=278\u2013292 |doi=10.2307/1209699 |jstor=1209699}}</ref>\n\nFurther in his discussion of experimental cinema in postwar America, Jacobs says the film \"attempted to show the way in which an apparently simple and casual occurrence develops subconsciously into a critical and emotional experience. A girl comes home one afternoon and falls asleep. In a dream she sees herself returning home, tortured by loneliness and frustration and impulsively committing suicide. The story has a double climax, in which it appears that the imagined, the dream, has become real.\u201d<ref name=Jacobs />\n\nDeren uses specific cinematic devices in this film to convey deeper meaning. In a particular scene, Deren is walking up a normal set of stairs, and each time she pushes against the wall, it triggers the camera to move in that direction, almost as if the camera is part of her body. As she pulls herself up the last stair, the top of the stairs leads her to a window in her bedroom, which breaks the expectations of the viewer. In doing so, Deren destroys normal sense of time and space. There is no longer a sense of what the space is that she is in, nor for how long she was there. Deren constantly asks the viewer to pay attention and remember certain things by repeating the same actions over and over with only very subtle changes. In ''Meshes of the Afternoon'', repeated images are of the knife in the bread, the phone off the hook, the key, and the record player as Deren goes about performing the same actions. Deren uses familiar images to trigger memory.\n\nA recognizable trait of Deren's work is her use of the subjective and objective camera. For instance, shots in ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' cut from Deren looking at an object, to Deren's point of view, looking at herself perform the same actions that she has been making throughout the film. This conveys the meaning of Deren's dual personality or ambivalent feelings towards the possibility of suicide. It is Lewis Jacobs' opinion that \"the film is not completely successful, it skips from objectivity to subjectivity without transitions or preparation and is often confusing.\"<ref name=Jacobs /> An example of Jacobs' comment would be when Deren cuts to her point of view, which normally is an objective shot, but in this POV shot she is watching herself, which is subjective. The viewer cannot expect Deren's POV shot to contain herself.\n\n===Joseph Brinton's discussion===\n<!-- This section has been ported from the Maya Deren biography page as it is more appropriate to the article on the film itself. -->\n\nIn Joseph Brinton\u2019s 1947 essay \"Subjective Camera or Subjective Audience\", he states that \"the symbolic picturization of man\u2019s subconscious in Maya Deren\u2019s experimental films suggest that the subjective camera can explore subtleties hitherto unimaginable as film content. As the new technique can clearly express almost any facet of everyday human experience, its development should presage a new type of psychological film in which the camera will reveal the human mind, not superficially, but honestly in terms of image and sound.\"<ref name=Brinton>{{cite journal |last1=Brinton, III |first1=Joseph P. |title=Subjective Camera or Subjective Audience? |journal=Hollywood Quarterly |date=July 1947 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=365 |jstor=1209531}}</ref>\n\nJacobs' critique that \"the film is not completely successful, it skips from objectivity to subjectivity without transitions or preparation and is often confusing\", represents one point of view. However, others take the film's approach to be a direct representation on the character's thought patterns in a time of crisis: \"Such a film should indeed endow the cinema with a wholly new dimension of subjective experience, permitting the audience to see a human being both as others see him and as he sees himself.\"<ref name=Brinton />\n\n===Museum of Modern Art===\nIn the [[Museum of Modern Art]] retrospective (2010), it was suggested that the pieces of the mirror falling into the ocean waves set up ''[[At Land]]'' (1944) as a direct sequel, while Deren's last scene in the latter film (running with her hands up with a chess piece in one of them) is then echoed by a scene in ''[[Ritual in Transfigured Time]]'' (1946) with that character still running.\n\n== Possible influences ==\n=== Jean Cocteau ===\n''Meshes of the Afternoon'' resembles a French film called ''[[Blood of a Poet]]'' (1930) by [[Jean Cocteau]]. The film is a representation of the subjective point of view of the Cocteau's mind in which he grapples with the concepts of inner and outer reality. ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' and Cocteau's film share the same imagery in many instances; however, Deren repeatedly claimed to have never seen the film, and denied any influence by Cocteau. After seeing ''Blood of a Poet'' for the first time, she actually became fond of Cocteau.<ref name=\"Athology Film Archive/Film Culture\">{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=VeVe A. |last2=Hudson |first2=Millicent |last3=Neiman |first3=Catrina |editor1-last=Melton |editor1-first=Hollis |title=The Legend of Maya Deren: A Documentary Biography and Collected Works |date=1988 |publisher=Athology Film Archive/Film Culture |location=New York City |isbn=0-911689-17-6 |edition=Volume 1 Part Two}}</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1945, Deren wrote to Victor Animatograph Corp. that she had now seen the film multiple times, and expressed interest in publishing a commentary on it. The article was never written.<ref name=\"Athology Film Archive/Film Culture\"/>\n\n=== Dali and Bu\u00f1uel ===\nThe surrealist background of [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] is a possible influence, because of the surreal nature of ''Meshes of the Afternoon''. Bu\u00f1uel's ''Un Chien Andalou'' (1928) is one of the premier examples of film representing the structure of the subconscious.<ref name=\"Athology Film Archive/Film Culture\"/>\n\nDeren detested this comparison because of the surrealist movement's interest in the entertainment value of its subject more than its meaning. Also, the form of ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' does not compare to that of ''Un Chien Andalou''.<ref name=\"Athology Film Archive/Film Culture\"/>\n\n===Freud and Jung ===\nViewers attempted to decode the symbolism in the film from a [[Freudian]] or [[Jungian]] point of view to uncover what Deren was saying about identity and sexuality. Deren adamantly objected to her film undergoing analysis for its symbolism; for her, the objects in the film were just that, objects \"whose value and meaning is defined and confirmed by their actual function in the context of the film as a whole\". Deren wanted her audiences to appreciate the art for its conscious value, and spent a lot of her later career delivering lectures and writing essays on her film theory.<ref name=\"Athology Film Archive/Film Culture\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nA cloaked, mirror-faced figure appears in John Coney's 1974 [[Sun Ra]] vehicle, ''[[Space Is the Place]],'' [[Yeasayer]]'s video for \"[[Odd Blood|Ambling Alp]]\", and [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]]'s video for \"[[Tightrope (Janelle Mon\u00e1e song)|Tightrope]]\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Claes |first=Colleen |title=Janelle Monae: Avant-Garde Film Geek ('Tightrope' Video) |url=http://open.salon.com/blog/colleenclaes/2010/04/04/janelle_monae_avant-garde_film_geek_tightrope_video |publisher=Open Salon |access-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706044921/http://open.salon.com/blog/colleenclaes/2010/04/04/janelle_monae_avant-garde_film_geek_tightrope_video |archive-date=6 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe dreamlike (or nightmarish) atmosphere of ''Meshes'' has influenced many subsequent films, notably [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997). Wendy Haslem of the University of Melbourne's Cinema Studies department wrote about the parallels between the two:\n\n<blockquote>Maya Deren was a key figure in the development of the New American Cinema. Her influence extends to contemporary filmmakers like David Lynch, whose film ''Lost Highway'' (1997) pays homage to ''Meshes of the Afternoon'' in his experimentation with narration. Lynch adopts a similar spiraling narrative pattern, sets his film within an analogous location and establishes a mood of dread and paranoia, the result of constant surveillance. Both films focus on the nightmare as it is expressed in the elusive doubling of characters and in the incorporation of the \u201cpsychogenic fugue,\u201d the evacuation and replacement of identities, something that was also central to the [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] ritual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/deren-2/ |title=Maya Deren |first=Wendy |last=Haslem |website=[[Senses of Cinema]] |date=December 2002 |access-date=15 December 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJim Emerson, the editor of [[RogerEbert.com]], has also noted the influence of ''Meshes'' within David Lynch's film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Emerson |first=Jim |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070125/REVIEWS/701250301 |title=Inland Empire Movie Review & Film Summary (2007) &#124; Roger Ebert |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=2007-01-25 |access-date=2015-08-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) opened an exhibition that dealt with Deren's influence on three experimental filmmakers, [[Barbara Hammer]], [[Su Friedrich]] and [[Carolee Schneemann]], as part of a year-long retrospective there on representation of women. Su Friedrich conceived her short film ''[[Cool Hands, Warm Heart]]'' (1979) in direct homage to ''Meshes of the Afternoon'', and used the flower and knife motifs similarly in that film.\n\n[[Kristin Hersh]]'s song \"[[Your Ghost]]\" is inspired by the film, and the song's music video uses several motifs from the film, including a spinning record, a telephone, and a key on a woman's tongue. Likewise, [[Milla Jovovich]]'s video for \"[[Gentleman Who Fell]]\" reproduces other motifs such as the mirror-faced figure, the reappearing key, the knife, and the shifting staircase effect.\n\n[[Industrial metal]] pioneers [[Godflesh]] used a still from the film for the cover of their 1994 EP ''[[Merciless (EP)|Merciless]]'', as did [[alternative rock]] band [[Primal Scream]] for their 1986 single \"Crystal Crescent\".\n\nExperimental electronic artist [[Sd Laika]] used samples from the film's soundtrack for the track \"Meshes\" on his debut album.<ref>[http://www.whosampled.com/Sd-Laika/Meshes/ \"Meshes\"].
