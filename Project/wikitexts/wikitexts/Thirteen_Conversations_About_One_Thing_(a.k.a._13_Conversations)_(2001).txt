The screenplay by Sprecher and her sister Karen focuses on five seemingly disparate individuals in search of happiness whose paths intersect in ways that unexpectedly affect their lives.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is divided into 13 vignettes, each prefaced by an [[aphorism]]. Set in [[New York City]], the story revolves around ambitious [[district attorney]] Troy, who is stricken with guilt following a [[hit and run]] accident in which he injures Beatrice, an idealistic cleaning woman who, forced to reassess her life during her recuperation, finds herself thinking more like her cynical co-worker Dorrie. Mid-level insurance claims manager Gene, unable to cope with his son's downward spiral into drug addiction, is rankled by an unrelentingly cheerful staff member and suffers pangs of regret after firing him without just cause. College physics professor Walker, trying to cope with a [[midlife crisis]], becomes romantically involved with a colleague, an infidelity his wife Patricia is forced to face when his wallet, stolen in a mugging, is mailed to their home and she discovers incriminating evidence inside it.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Matthew McConaughey]] as Troy\n*[[John Turturro]] as Walker\n*[[Clea DuVall]] as Beatrice\n*[[Alan Arkin]] as Gene\n*[[Amy Irving]] as Patricia\n*[[Tia Texada]] as Dorrie\n*[[Richard E. Council]] as Del\n\n==Production==\nThe Sprecher sisters scripted ''Thirteen Conversations About One Thing'' over the course of eight weeks. The script was completed before Jill's directorial debut ''[[Clockwatchers]]'' was released in 1997, but due to a lack of funding the film took over three years to make.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/notes/jsprecherinterview.htm |title = One conversation with Jill Sprecher |last = Chaw |first = Walter |publisher = Film Freak Central |access-date = 2006-10-03 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927044213/http://filmfreakcentral.net/notes/jsprecherinterview.htm |archive-date = 2006-09-27 }}</ref> The plot was inspired in part by events in Jill Sprecher's life, including two muggings and a subway assault.<ref name=\"austin\">{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A96019|title=Happy Trails to You|last=Levy|first=Piet|publisher=Austin Chronicle|date=July 5, 2002|access-date=2006-10-03}}</ref> The character of Beatrice is based on Sprecher's experiences when she moved to [[Manhattan]] following college graduation:<ref name=\"austin\" /> \"[[Clea DuVall|Clea Duvall]]'s character is very autobiographical ...

O. Scott]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' called the film \"both straightforward and enigmatic\" and said that \"the quiet naturalism of the acting balances the artifice of the script and the almost finicky precision of Ms. Sprecher's frames\". For Scott, the film is \"thrillingly smart, but not, like so many other pictures in this vein, merely an elaborate excuse for its own cleverness. As you puzzle over the intricacies of its shape, which reveal themselves only in retrospect, you may also find yourself surprised by the depth of its insights.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/24/movies/24CONV.html ''New York Times'' review]</ref> ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' reviewer Eric Harrison called the film an \"intricately devised and thoughtful comedy\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2002_3554645|title=Thirteen Conversations About One Thing|last=Harrison|first=Eric|publisher=Houston Chronicle|date=November 12, 2004|access-date=25 October 2010}}</ref> while ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reviewer [[Mick LaSalle]] said it \"makes a case for cinema as a vehicle for conveying moods and ideas and, hardest of all, the internal movements of a soul.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/11/22/DD12827.DTL|title=The pursuit of happiness|first=Mick|last=LaSalle|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 22, 2002|access-date=2006-10-03}}</ref>\n\nNegative reviewers wrote that the film had problems of tone and a lack of depth to its philosophical underpinnings.
