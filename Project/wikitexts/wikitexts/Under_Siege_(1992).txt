W. Bush]] announces that the ship will be decommissioned in [[California]]. [[Casey Ryback]], a [[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] assigned as a culinary specialist, prepares meals in celebration of the birthday of [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]] [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Adams, against the orders of [[Executive officer|Executive Officer]] [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Krill, who is having food and entertainment brought by helicopter. Krill provokes a brawl with Ryback. Unable to imprison Ryback in the brig without clearance from the captain, Krill detains Ryback in a freezer and places Marine Private Nash on guard. A helicopter lands on the ship's deck with a musical band and a group of caterers (who are in fact a band of mercenaries led by disillusioned former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative William \"Bill\" Strannix), and also with [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy'' Playmate]] Jordan Tate.\n\nStrannix's forces seize control of the ship with Krill's help. Several officers are killed, including Captain Adams. The surviving ship's company are imprisoned in the forecastle, except for some stragglers in unsecured areas. Ryback hears the gunshots and persuades Nash to call the bridge, inadvertently alerting Strannix of this loose end. Strannix sends two mercenaries to eliminate Ryback and Nash. Nash is killed, but Ryback slays the assassins, runs into Tate, who was sedated during the takeover, and reluctantly allows her to tag along.\n\nStrannix and his men seize control of the ship's weapon systems, shooting down a jet sent to investigate, and plan on covering their escape by using missiles to obliterate tracking systems in Pearl Harbor. Strannix intends to sell the ship's [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawks]] by unloading them onto a submarine he previously stole from [[North Korea]], as revenge for the CIA trying to assassinate him prior to the events of the film.\n\nStrannix contacts Admiral Bates at the Pentagon to make demands, but then learns that Ryback has escaped. Krill discovers that Ryback is a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] with extensive training in counterterrorism tactics; Captain Adams kept him on as a cook after Ryback was demoted for striking a superior officer because a [[United States invasion of Panama|mission in Panama]] went wrong due to inadequate intel, and Krill was unaware of this beforehand as Ryback's file was kept in the captain's personal safe. Ryback contacts Bates and is told that the Navy plans to send a SEAL team to retake the ship. Ryback moves throughout the ship, eliminating any hijackers he comes across. To keep the missile-theft plan in place, Krill activates the fire suppression system in the forecastle, leaving the crew members to drown. The terrorists correctly assume this will force Ryback to refocus his efforts to rescue his crew mates, and set up an ambush in anticipation.\n\nRyback and Tate come upon six imprisoned sailors. Together, they overcome the ambush and shut off the water in the forecastle. Ryback shuts down ''Missouri''{{'}}s weapon systems to allow the incoming Navy SEALs to land, but the submarine crew shoots down the helicopter carrying the Navy SEALs with shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. The Pentagon responds by ordering an air strike that will sink ''Missouri''. Strannix regains control of the ship's weapon systems and loads the Tomahawks onto the submarine. With the aid of a retired World War II gunner's mate among the rescued sailors, Ryback uses the battleship's 16&nbsp;inch guns to attack the submarine, killing Krill and everyone on board.\n\nHis plan foiled, Strannix launches two retaliatory nuclear-tipped Tomahawks towards [[Honolulu]]. As the sailors recapture the ship, Ryback finds his way into the control room, where he encounters Strannix; Ryback recognizes Strannix as his former superior officer from multiple operations they participated in while deployed abroad and the two engage in a knife fight. Ryback gains the upper hand and kills Strannix, then uses the launch code disk needed to destroy the Tomahawk missiles. A jet destroys one of the missiles, and the other is deactivated just in time; the Navy calls off its airstrike.\n\nThe remaining crew members are freed as the ship sails towards [[San Francisco]] harbor. A funeral ceremony for Captain Adams is held on the deck of ''Missouri'', showing Ryback saluting the captain's casket in his formal dress uniform with full decorations.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Missouri post refit.JPG|thumb|right|150px|USS ''Missouri'']]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Chief Petty Officer [[Casey Ryback]], a former Navy SEAL who currently serves as the culinary specialist of ''Missouri''.\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as William Strannix, a renegade, embittered former CIA operative who leads the team of terrorists.\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Commander Peter Krill, ''Missouri'''s sociopathic, corrupt executive officer who serves as an inside man and second in-command of Strannix.\n* [[Erika Eleniak]] as Jordan Tate, a [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy ''Playmate]] model \"Miss July '89\" (the same as Eleniak was in real life) who came on board to entertain the ship's personnel and becomes Ryback's [[sidekick]].\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Daumer, Strannix's lead commando.\n* [[Patrick O'Neal (actor)|Patrick O'Neal]] as Captain J.T.
