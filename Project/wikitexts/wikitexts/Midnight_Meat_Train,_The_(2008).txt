The film follows a photographer who attempts to track down a [[serial killer]] dubbed the \"Subway Butcher\", and discovers more than he bargained for under the city streets.\n\nThe film was directed by [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], and stars [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Leslie Bibb]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Roger Bart]], [[Ted Raimi]] and [[Vinnie Jones]]. Its script was adapted by Jeff Buhler, the producer was [[Tom Rosenberg]] of [[Lakeshore Entertainment]], and it was released on August 1, 2008. Producer Joe Daley, a long-time friend of Buhler's, brought the two writers together and helped develop the script, along with producers Anthony DiBlasi and Jorge Saralegui, for their and Clive Barker's production company Midnight Picture Show, which was responsible for ''[[Book of Blood]]'', the next film adaptation from the anthology of short stories that spawned ''The Midnight Meat Train''.\n\n==Plot==\nLeon is a photographer who wants to capture unique gritty shots of the city. He is crushed when, instead of giving him his big break, gallery owner Susan criticizes him for not taking enough risks. Emboldened, he heads into the city's subway system at night, where he takes pictures of an impending sexual assault before saving the woman. The next day, he discovers she has gone missing. Intrigued, he investigates reports of similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany, whom he suspects has been killing subway passengers for the past three years.\n\nLeon presents his photos to the police, but Detective Hadley disbelieves him. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his girlfriend Maya, who is also disbelieving of his story. Leon follows Mahogany onto the last subway train of the night, only to witness a bloodbath. The butcher kills several passengers and hangs their bodies on meat hooks. After a brief scuffle with Mahogany, Leon passes out on the train. He awakes the next morning in a slaughterhouse with strange markings carved into his chest.\n\nA concerned Maya and her friend Jurgis examine Leon's photos of Mahogany, leading them to the killer's apartment. After breaking in, Jurgis is captured, though Maya escapes with timetables that record over a hundred years of murders on the subway. She goes to the police but finds Hadley still skeptical. When Hadley presses Maya to return the timetables, she demands answers. At gunpoint, Hadley directs her to take the midnight train to find Jurgis. Leon heads to a hidden subway entrance in the slaughterhouse, arming himself with several knives.\n\nHe boards the train as Mahogany completes his nightly massacre and corners Maya. Leon attacks the murderer with a knife, and the two fight in between the swinging human flesh. Human body parts are ripped, thrown, and used as weapons. Jurgis, hung from a meat hook, dies when he is gutted. The train reaches its final stop, a cavernous abandoned station filled with skulls and decomposing bodies. The conductor appears, advising Leon and Maya to \"step away from the meat.\" The true purpose of the abandoned station is revealed, as reptilian creatures enter the car and consume the bodies of the murdered passengers. Leon and Maya flee into the cavern. Mahogany, battered, fights to the death with Leon. After Leon stabs a broken femur through his throat, Mahogany only grins in his dying throes, saying, \"Welcome!\"\n\nThe conductor tells Leon the creatures have lived beneath the city long before the subway was constructed, and the butcher's job is to feed them each night to keep them from attacking subway riders during the day. He picks up Leon and, with the same supernatural strength as the deceased butcher, rips out Leon's tongue and eats it. The conductor brings Leon's attention to Maya, who has been knocked unconscious and is lying on a pile of bones. The conductor forces Leon to watch as he cuts Maya's chest open to remove her heart. He says that, having killed the butcher, Leon must take his place.\n\nDetective Hadley hands the train schedule to the new butcher, who wears a ring with the symbol of the group that feeds the creatures. The killer walks onto the midnight train and reveals himself as Leon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Leon Kaufman\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Maya Jones\n* [[Brooke Shields]] as Susan Hoff\n* [[Roger Bart]] as Jurgis\n* [[Ted Raimi]] as Randle Cooper\n* [[Vinnie Jones]] as Mahogany\n* [[Peter Jacobson]] as Otto\n* [[Barbara Eve Harris]] as Detective Lynn Hadley\n* [[Tony Curran]] as Driver\n* Stephanie Mace as Leigh Cooper\n* NorA as Erika Sakaki\n* Dan Callahan as Troy Taleveski\n* [[Quinton Jackson]] as Guardian Angel\n* [[Allen Maldonado]] as Lead Gangbanger\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MidnightMeatTrainCCJuly07.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Vinnie Jones, Leslie Bibb, and Bradley Cooper at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] promoting the film in July 2007]]\nThe film's original director, [[Patrick Tatopoulos]], originally planned to shoot the film in 2005 in [[New York City]] and [[Montreal]].

There's an energy to the film's final 10 minutes that's unmatched in recent horror films, and Kitamura's penchant for hard-hitting action, while suitably controlled, is always just below the surface. ...

The gore factor is selling point to the genre crowd, and they don't have to worry. No punches are pulled. If this is the kind of quality material that Kitamura's going to deliver in Hollywood, I hope he stays there.\"<ref>[http://twitchfilm.net/site/view/midnight-meat-train-review/ Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021044052/http://twitchfilm.net/site/view/midnight-meat-train-review/ |date=2008-10-21 }} Twitch Film, July 28, 2008</ref>\n\nCinematical called the film \"easily the best Clive Barker adaptation since the first ''[[Hellraiser]]'' film,\" saying that \"screenwriter Jeff Buhler manages to maintain the sly sense of dread that permeates the best of Barker's horror tales.\"<ref>[http://www.cinematical.com/2008/07/26/sdcc-review-the-midnight-meat-train/ Review] Cinematical, July 26, 2008</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]] said that \"Clive Barker fans will rejoice in what director Ryuhei Kitamura has given them.
