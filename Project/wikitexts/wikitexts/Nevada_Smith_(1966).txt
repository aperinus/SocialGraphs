The film was made by [[Embassy Pictures]] and Solar Productions, in association with and released by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The movie was a [[prequel]] to the 1961 [[Harold Robbins]] novel ''[[The Carpetbaggers]]'', which had been made into a [[The Carpetbaggers (film)|highly successful film]] two years earlier, with [[Alan Ladd]] playing McQueen's part as an older man. ''Nevada Smith'' depicts Smith's first meeting with another \"Carpetbaggers\" character, Jonas Cord Sr., and delves into Nevada Smith's background as summarized in a scene from the original film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1890s American West, outlaws Bill Bowdre, Jesse Coe, and Tom Fitch seek to rob Max's father of gold which they believe he has. When it becomes evident that there is none, they torture and brutally kill the white father and [[Kiowa]] mother of young Max Sand. Max sets out to avenge their deaths.\n\nWhile traveling in the desert, Max uncovers a rusty old gun. Coming upon Jonas Cord, a traveling gunsmith, Max tries to rob him. Cord, recognizing that Max's revolver is non-functional, convinces Max he has failed. Max tells Cord about his vengeful journey. Cord, empathetic, shelters him and teaches him to shoot. Max hunts the killers, who have since separated. He tracks down Jesse Coe to [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], [[Texas]]. With help from Neesa, a Kiowa dance hall girl, he identifies and confronts Coe in a saloon. A knife fight ensues in a nearby corral. Coe is killed but Max is severely wounded. Neesa takes him to her tribe's camp and nurses him back to health. Soon after, they become lovers.\n\nOnce recovered, Max continues his pursuit. He learns that Bowdre is in a prison camp located deep within Louisiana's swamps. Max deliberately commits a bank robbery to be sent to the same prison as Bowdre. Max persuades Bowdre to escape with him, planning to kill him in the swamp. Pilar, a local [[Cajun]] girl working in the rice fields near the convicts\u2019 camp agrees to help Max. Unaware of Max's plan to kill Bowdre, she obtains a boat and navigates the trio through the swamp. The boat capsizes early on and Pilar is bitten by a poisonous snake. Max kills Bowdre, but Pilar eventually succumbs to the venom of the snakebite.\n\nMax has escaped and is now hunting Fitch, the last murderer. Still blinded by revenge, Max infiltrates Fitch's gang, calling himself, \"Nevada Smith\". Fitch knows Max Sand has killed Coe and Bowdre and is coming for him. Though he accepts \"Nevada\" into the gang, Fitch is wary. As the gang rides out to commit a gold-transport robbery, Max is spotted by Cord, who calls out his name. Max ignores him and the gang rides on. Fitch now suspects one of his men is Max. As the gang greedily scoops up the stolen gold, Max watches from a hill. Fitch, realizing \"Smith\" is Sand, grabs his share and flees. Max pursues him and corners him at a creek. Fitch tries shooting Sand while pretending to surrender, but Sand, faster, shoots Fitch's hand.\n\nFitch gives up and wants Max to quickly kill him. Max shoots Fitch several more times, inflicting painful but non-fatal wounds. As Fitch lies in the creek, bleeding profusely, Max demands Fitch beg for his life. Fitch calls Max a coward for refusing to kill him. Max decides Fitch is not worth killing and rides away as Fitch continues shouting at Max to kill him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as Max Sand, a.k.a.
