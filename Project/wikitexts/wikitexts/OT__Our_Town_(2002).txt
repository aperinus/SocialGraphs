It is set at [[Manuel Dominguez High School|Dominguez High School]] in [[Compton, California]]. The school has not produced a play in twenty years and has no budget, nor a stage. The film documents the efforts by two teachers and twenty-four students to adapt and update [[Thornton Wilder]]'s American classic ''[[Our Town]]'', set in an all-white small town between the years 1901 and 1913, to better reflect the ethic background of Dominguez High School and Compton in the year 2000. The film documents rehearsals and the [[self-doubt]]s experienced leading up to the performance on June 8\u201310, 2000 in the school's cafeteria.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press kit for OT: Our Town| url=http://www.filmmovement.com/downloads/press/otpresskit.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media|title=OT: Our Town|year=2002}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[A.
