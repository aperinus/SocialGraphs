Thirty-five people who had become disillusioned by what they experienced at the time are interviewed. In particular, many of those interviewed claim that the inexperience of the core members of the Bush administration \u2014 and their refusal to seek, acknowledge or accept input from more experienced outsiders \u2014 was at the root of the disastrous occupation effort. Other interviewees include former soldiers who had been stationed in Iraq and authors and journalists who were critical of the war planning.\n\nThose interviewed are:\n*[[Jay Garner|General Jay Garner]], who briefly ran the reconstruction of Iraq before being replaced by [[L. Paul Bremer]]\n*[[Barbara Bodine|Ambassador Barbara Bodine]], who was briefly in charge of the Baghdad embassy in spring 2003\n*[[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]], [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]] from 2001-5\n*[[Robert Hutchings]], former chairman of the [[National Intelligence Council]]\n*[[Lawrence Wilkerson|Col.

Ferguson chose to include those three in the film because they provided \"the most interesting, the most representative, and the most poignant\" interviews.<ref name=\"Cineaste\">{{cite journal |last1=Crowdus |first1=Gary Alan |last2=Ferguson |first2=Charles |date=Fall 2007 |title=No End in Sight: An Interview with Charles Ferguson |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41690553 |journal=Cin\u00e9aste |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=18\u201319 |jstor=41690553 |access-date=23 August 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\n''No End in Sight'' focuses primarily on period immediately following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|American invasion of Iraq in March 2003]]. It asserts that serious mistakes made by the administration of President [[George W. Bush]] during that time were the cause of subsequent problems in Iraq, such as the rise of the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgency]], a lack of security and basic services for many Iraqis, sectarian violence, and, at one point, the risk of complete civil war.\n\nThe film notes the lack of advance planning for the post invasion governance of Iraq. It criticizes [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for not providing enough troops to maintain order or declaring [[martial law]] after the country was conquered. The [[Coalition Provisional Authority|ORHA]] had identified at least twenty crucial government buildings and cultural sites in Baghdad, but none of the locations were protected during the invasion; only the oil ministry was guarded. With no police force or national army to maintain order, ministries and buildings were looted for their desks, tables, chairs, phones, computers, and even large machinery and [[rebar]], though Rumsfeld initially dismissed the widespread looting as no worse than that which takes place during riots in American cities. Among the pillaged sites were Iraqi museums containing priceless artifacts from some of the earliest human civilizations, which, it is suggested, sent chilling signals to the average Iraqi that the American forces did not intend to maintain law and order. Eventually, the looting turned into an organized destruction of Baghdad. The destruction of libraries and records, in combination with \"[[de-Ba'athification]]\", ruined the bureaucracy that existed prior to the U.S. invasion, and ORHA staff reported that they had to start from scratch to rebuild the government infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the film, there were three especially grave early mistakes made by [[L. Paul Bremer]], the head of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority|CPA]]:\n\n*His stopping of preparations for the formation of an interim Iraqi government.\n*His [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 1|first official executive order]], which implemented \"de-Ba'athification\". [[Saddam Hussein]]'s ruling [[Ba'ath Party]] counted as its members a huge majority of Iraq's governmental employees, including educational officials and some teachers, as it was not possible to attain such positions unless one was a member. By order of the CPA, these skilled, and often apolitical, individuals were fired and banned from holding any positions in Iraq's new government.\n*His [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2|second official executive order]], which, against the advice of the U.S. military, disbanded all of Iraq's military entities. The U.S. military had wanted the Iraqi troops retained to help maintain order, but Bremer decided to build a new Iraqi military force instead. This order caused 500,000 young Iraqi men to become unemployed, many of whom had extended families to support, and many of whom then joined a militia force. In the chaos after the invasion, Iraq's huge arms depots were available for pillaging by anyone who wanted weapons and explosives, and the former soldiers converged on the stockpiles. The U.S. forces knew the locations of the weapon caches, but said they lacked the troops to secure them, and these arms would later be used against the Americans and new Iraqi government forces.\n \nThese three mistakes are cited as the primary causes of the rapid deterioration of occupied Iraq into chaos, as the collapse of the government bureaucracy and military resulted in a lack of authority and order. When Islamic fundamentalist groups moved to fill this void, their ranks swelled with disillusioned Iraqis.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 96%, based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 8.15/10; the website's critical consensus states: \"Charles Ferguson's documentary provides a good summary of the decisions that led to the mess in post-war Iraq, and offers politically interested audiences something they'd been looking for: a lowdown on the decision making\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/no_end_in_sight|title=No End in Sight|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it has a score of 89 out of 100, based on 28 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/noendinsight |title=No End in Sight (2007): Reviews |access-date=2008-03-13 |website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 4 stars out of 4 and said: \"This is not a documentary filled with anti-war activists or sitting ducks for [[Michael Moore]]. Most of the people in the film were important to the Bush administration.\" Ebert concluded by stating that \"I am distinctly not comparing anyone to Hitler, but I cannot help being reminded of the stories of him in his Berlin bunker, moving nonexistent troops on a map, and issuing orders to dead generals.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070809/REVIEWS/708090301/1023 |title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: No End in Sight |access-date=2007-09-12 |author=Roger Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=2007-08-10 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' praised the film, saying it \"stands out for its comprehensive take on how we got there, why we can't get out\", and opined that everyone should see it, calling it \"the perfect stocking-stuffer for holiday enlightenment.\"<ref>[[Corliss, Richard]]; \u201cThe 10 Best Movies\u201d; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine; December 24, 2007; Page 40.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212160644/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1692015,00.html Corliss, Richard; \u201cThe 10 Best Movies\u201d; time.com]</ref>\n\n[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"exacting, enraging\" and said that \"[Charles Ferguson] presents familiar material with impressive concision and impact, offering a clear, temperate and devastating account of high-level arrogance and incompetence.\" Scott explained that \"most of the movie deals with a period of a few months in the spring and summer of 2003, when a series of decisions were made that did much to determine the terrible course of subsequent events\" and \"the knowledge and expertise of military, diplomatic and technical professionals was overridden by the ideological certainty of political loyalists.\" He remarked: \"It might be argued that since [[L. Paul Bremer|Mr. Bremer]], [[Donald Rumsfeld|Mr. Rumsfeld]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz|Mr. Wolfowitz]] declined to appear in the film, Mr. Ferguson was able to present only one side of the story. But the accumulated professional standing of the people he did interview, and their calm, detailed insistence on the facts, makes such an objection implausible.\" In conclusion, Scott called the film \"sober, revelatory and absolutely vital\".<ref name=aoscott>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/movies/27sigh.html |title=In the Beginning: Focusing on the Iraq War Enablers |access-date=2007-09-12 |author=A.O. Scott |date=2007-07-27 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nRob Nelson of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' said: \"Masterfully edited and cumulatively walloping, Charles Ferguson's ''No End in Sight'' turns the well-known details of our monstrously bungled [[Iraq War|Iraq war]] into an enraging, apocalyptic litany of fuck-ups.\" Nelson said the film \"is certainly a film about failure, perhaps the ultimate film about failure. Or maybe a film about the ultimate failure?\", and \"is less a work of investigation (or activism) than history.\" In his view, \"Focusing on the war itself, Ferguson is chiefly interested in compiling a filmed dossier of incompetence\u2014not so much to argue that the war could have been won and won early, but to suggest that the magnitude of arrogant irresponsibility will carry aftershocks as far into the future as the mind can imagine\", and \"Ferguson's approach is at once relentless and, with the help of [[Campbell Scott]]'s flat narration, chillingly calm and composed\". He remarked that \"The evidence speaks for itself, and ''No End in Sight''\u2014addressed to those who'll be swayed against the war by ineptitude more than immorality\u2014is the rare American documentary that doesn't appear to preach to the converted, or at least not only to the converted\", and \"For those of us who've opposed the war for years, the movie is at once intensely frightening and, it must be admitted, disturbingly reassuring.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0730,nelson,77309,20.html |title=Surge This |access-date=2007-09-12 |author=Rob Nelson |date=2007-07-24 |newspaper=[[Village Voice]]}}</ref>\n\n===Top ten lists===\n''No End in Sight'' appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2007/toptens.shtml |title=Metacritic: 2007 Film Critic Top Ten Lists |access-date=2008-01-05 |website=[[Metacritic]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080102102034/http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2007/toptens.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-01-02}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n*1st - [[Stephen Hunter]], ''[[The Washington Post]]''\n*3rd - Ty Burr, ''[[The Boston Globe]]''\n*5th - [[A.
