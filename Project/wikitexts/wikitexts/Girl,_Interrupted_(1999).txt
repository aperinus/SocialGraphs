Based on [[Susanna Kaysen]]'s [[Girl, Interrupted|memoir of the same name]], the film follows a young woman who, after a suicide attempt, spends 18 months at a [[psychiatric hospital]] between 1967 and 1968.\n\n''Girl, Interrupted'' began as a limited release on December 21, 1999, with a wide expansion on January 14, 2000. The film received mixed reviews from critics, though the performances of Ryder and Jolie received widespread critical acclaim and it has received more positive appreciation in subsequent years. Jolie won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture]], and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1967 New England, aimless 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen ([[Winona Ryder]]) has a [[Mental disorder|nervous breakdown]] and overdoses on [[aspirin]] and [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]]. Against her wishes, she is checked into Claymoore, a local [[psychiatric hospital]]. In the psychiatric ward, Susanna befriends Polly Clark ([[Elisabeth Moss]]), a childlike girl with schizophrenia, Cynthia ([[Jillian Armenante]]), a lesbian; Georgina Tuskin ([[Clea DuVall]]), a [[Pathological lying|pathological liar]] and Susanna\u2019s roommate; Daisy Randone ([[Brittany Murphy]]), who [[self-harm]]s and has [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]], as well as being implied to be [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimic]];<ref>{{cite web|date=2014-08-06|title=7 Wonders: Girl, Interrupted|url=https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2014/08/06/7-wonders-girl-interrupted/|access-date=2021-06-03|website=Wonderland|language=en-US}}</ref> and Janet ([[Angela Bettis]]), a [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] woman with [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]. Susanna is particularly drawn to the [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] Lisa Rowe ([[Angelina Jolie]]), who is rebellious but charismatic and encourages Susanna to stop taking her medication and resist therapy.\n\nLisa helps the girls sneak around at night in the hospital's underground tunnels and continuously provokes them and the staff, including the stern head nurse, Valerie Owens ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]). Through regular therapy sessions with Dr. Melvin Potts ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]), Susanna comes to learn she has [[borderline personality disorder]], a fact Dr. Potts initially conceals from her. On a rare supervised group outing celebrating Daisy's impending release, the women visit an ice cream parlor in town. There, Susanna is confronted by Barbara Gilcrest ([[Mary Kay Place]]), the wife of an English instructor with whom she had an affair, and their daughter, Bonnie ([[KaDee Strickland]]). Barbara publicly chastises Susanna for sleeping with her husband; coming to Susanna's defense, Lisa insultingly berates Barbara and the other girls mock her and Bonnie before they both leave, humiliated. This endears Lisa to Susanna even more, though Valerie reprimands Lisa.\n\nIn addition to her affair with Dr. Gilchrist, Susanna has had a casual relationship with Toby ([[Jared Leto]]), a young man who has been drafted to serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. He visits Susanna, and begs her to run away with him to [[Canada]]. Susanna tells him she has become friends with the other girls and would like to leave someday but not with him. The same night, Polly has a breakdown and is placed in isolation. Susanna and Lisa drug the night watch nurse with a sedative and attempt to comfort Polly by singing to her. Susanna also makes out with John ([[Travis Fine]]), one of the hospital orderlies who has a crush on her. When Valerie finds the group sleeping in the hallway in the morning, she punishes the two women, particularly Lisa, who is forced to endure [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] followed by solitary confinement.\n\nLater that night, Lisa manages to break out of confinement and convinces Susanna to escape with her. The women hitchhike to Daisy's newly-rented apartment, supplied by her doting father, and bribe her with [[diazepam|valium]] to spend the night. Daisy, insistent she has been cured of her illness, is confronted by Lisa when she discovers Daisy has been cutting herself. Lisa taunts and mocks Daisy, accusing her of enjoying the [[incest]]uous [[sexual abuse]] she has long suffered from her father. The next morning, Susanna finds Daisy dead in her bathroom, having slashed her wrists and hanged herself. Susanna is appalled when Lisa searches Daisy's room and body for cash. Realizing she does not want to become like Lisa, Susanna phones for an ambulance and returns to Claymoore while Lisa flees to Florida.\n\nUpon returning to the hospital, Susanna occupies herself with painting and writing, and co-operates with her therapy, including regular sessions with the hospital's head psychologist, Dr. Sonia Wick ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]). Before Susanna is released, Lisa is apprehended and returned to Claymoore. She steals Susanna's diary one night and reads it for the amusement of the patients in the tunnels, turning them against Susanna. After reading an entry in which Susanna feels sympathy for Lisa being a cold, dark person, Lisa attacks Susanna and chases her through the tunnels. Cornered, Susanna confronts Lisa, accusing her of being dead inside, emotionally dependent on Claymoore, and afraid of the world. This confrontation profoundly affects Lisa, who breaks down and contemplates suicide, though the others manage to dissuade her. Before Susanna is released the next day, she goes to visit Lisa, who is restrained to a bed. The two reconcile, and Lisa insists she is not actually heartless. They part ways on good terms and Susanna says her goodbyes to everyone and officially leaves Claymoore.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per closing tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as [[Susanna Kaysen|Susanna]], the protagonist.

However, on the flip side for people like Susanna and Lisa, who claim to have no secrets, the option of release seems oblique. \"Although the construct of the asylum represented an immeasurable tool in the pursuit to expiate mental illness, the respect for patient autonomy appeared to have been relegated to those without mental illness\".<ref>{{Citation |last1=Fariba |first1=Kamron A. |title=Involuntary Commitment |date=2022 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557377/ |work=StatPearls |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=32491309 |access-date=2022-06-05 |last2=Gupta |first2=Vikas}}</ref> In 1973, the infamous phrase \"dying with one's rights on\" was coined by [[Darold Treffert]], referring to the ultimate prioritization of patient autonomy over beneficence.\n\n===Representations of being a woman with mental illness===\nThe emergence of women's liberation movements in the sixties is of significance to the period Kaysen's memoir is set. The rights as well as standards were set much differently for women than they were men. Doctor Melvin originally doesn't inform Susanna of her diagnosis, deeming it was unnecessary for her to know.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chouinard |first=Vera |date=November 2009 |title=Placing the 'mad woman': troubling cultural representations of being a woman with mental illness in Girl Interrupted |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649360903205108 |journal=Social & Cultural Geography |language=en |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013804 |doi=10.1080/14649360903205108 |s2cid=143814497 |issn=1464-9365}}</ref> Eventually, when he informs her of the diagnosis, he cites the disorder being more common in women than in men. Subsequent studies on the understandings of the linkages between [[Mental disorders and gender|gender and mental health]] since the 1960s and 1970s have identified a more even gender balance in overall levels of mental health as they have incorporated a wider range of disorders.<ref>Busfield, J.

With bar-covered windows and regular room inspections to make sure the girls are not causing harm to themselves as well as not trying to escape, the girls are subject to the mercy of the ever watchful staff. The theme of [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] is exhibited in Susanna's life as neither her parents nor her boyfriend (who quits after a few attempts) come to visit her in the institution. The theme of isolation also serves as a protective shield from the dangers of the outside world as even Lisa complains that \"there's nobody to take care of you out there\", and people like Torrey are safe from an abusive home and drug-pushing environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yoo |first=Hyun-Joo |date=December 2019 |title=Depathologising the Traumatised Self in Susanna Kaysen's ''Girl, Interrupted'' |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ircl.2019.0310 |journal=International Research in Children's Literature |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=195\u2013207 |doi=10.3366/ircl.2019.0310 |s2cid=214142395 |issn=1755-6198}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
