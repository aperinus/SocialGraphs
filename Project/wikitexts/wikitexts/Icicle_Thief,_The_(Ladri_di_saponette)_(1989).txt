Some feel ''The Icicle Thief'' was created as a spoof of neorealism, which predominated Italian cinema after [[World War II]]. However, it is generally understood that the film is critical of the impact of [[consumerism]] on art, as suggested by the contrast between the [[#Nested film plot|nested film]] and commercials, and the apathy of Italian television viewers in recognising the difference between the two.<ref name=\"tribune-19891029\">{{cite web|last=Caro|first=Mark|title=Wry Reality|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-10-29-8901260555-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=1 April 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401001132/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-10-29-8901260555-story.html|archivedate=1 April 2020|location=Chicago|date=29 October 1989|url-status=live}}</ref> The film won the Golden St. George at the [[16th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Moscow1989\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |title=16th Moscow International Film Festival (1989) |accessdate=2013-02-24 |work=MIFF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316085017/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |archivedate=2013-03-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins with a film director, played by director Maurizo Nichetti himself, discussing his latest film on an intellectual Italian TV channel which is about to broadcast it at short notice in place of a more highly regarded competitor\u2019s. His \"masterpiece\" follows the bleak travails of a poverty-stricken unemployed man (again played by Nichetti) who finds work in a chandelier factory, but cannot resist stealing one of the gleaming lights for his wife. The pompous director is initially pleased with the seriousness with which his work is analysed, but he then becomes distraught when his [[black-and-white]] opus is repeatedly interrupted by full-colour commercials. The TV audience, watching in their homes, are completely oblivious of the interruptions and the \"outrages\" perpetrated on the director\u2019s artistic intentions.<ref>James, Caryn (1990) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140912045624/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/24265/The-Icicle-Thief/overview \"The Icicle Thief (1989)\"], ''New York Times'', August 24, 1990.

The director\u2019s original plot followed the travails of Antonio Piermattei (Maurizo Nichetti) and his impoverished family: Antonio finds work in a [[chandelier]] factory, where he tries to steal one of the lights for his wife, Maria ([[:it:Caterina Sylos Labini|Caterina Sylos Labini]]).\n\nWhen Antonio manages to smuggle a chandelier out of the factory, he is supposed to be paralysed by a traffic accident with a truck while riding home with the chandelier (just after the plot diverges due to a power failure). The accident would have forced Maria into prostitution, with their two sons, Bruno ([[:it:Federico Rizzo|Federico Rizzo]]) and Paolo (Matteo Auguardi), ending up in an [[orphanage]] in the final scene.<ref name=\"moria-20030523\">{{cite web|last=Scheib|first=Richard|title=The Icicle Thief (1989)|url=https://www.moriareviews.com/fantasy/icicle-thief-1989.htm|website=Moria Reviews|publisher=Richard Scheib|accessdate=31 March 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331225122/https://www.moriareviews.com/fantasy/icicle-thief-1989.htm|archivedate=31 March 2020|date=23 May 2003|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Plot divergence ===\n\nA power failure in the studio causes a model (Heidi Komarek) from one of the commercials to end up in the nested film's universe and disrupt the plot. Maria, thinking that Antonio is having an affair with the model, enters the commercial universe by faking her death, causing the police in the film to accuse Antonio of murdering her.<ref name=\"moria-20030523\"/>\n\nNichetti is forced to enter the film universe to restore the original plot, but Bruno convinces Don Italo ([[Renato Scarpa]]) to shift the blame from Antonio to Nichetti for Maria's murder, after learning of Nichetti\u2019s orphanage plot: this causes Nichetti to chase Bruno through the commercial universe before ending up in the commercial for [[floor cleaning|floor wax]], where Maria had been realising her aspiration as a singer.<ref name=\"la-19900907\">{{cite web|last=Benson|first=Shelia|title=Movie Review: 'Icicle Thief' an Ingenious Parody|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-07-ca-523-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=31 March 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331234322/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-07-ca-523-story.html|archivedate=31 March 2020|location=El Segundo|date=7 September 1990|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Actual ending ===\n\nBack in the film universe, Antonio laments the apparent loss of Maria and Bruno, and the possibility of the model leaving him due to the grim nature of the film. However, Nichetti manages to convince Maria and Bruno to return to the film universe with shopping carts of modern-day goods, with the Piermattei family reunited the satisfaction of the viewer (Carlina Torta). Nichetti then attempts to return to the real world, only to be trapped in the film universe after the viewer switches off the television set before going to bed.<ref name=\"tribune-19891029\"/>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Maurizio Nichetti]] as himself, and Antonio Piermattei\n* [[:it:Caterina Sylos Labini|Caterina Sylos Labini]] as Maria Piermattei, Antonio\u2019s wife\n* [[:it:Federico Rizzo|Federico Rizzo]] as Bruno Piermattei, Antonio\u2019s son\n* Matteo Auguardi as Paolo Piermattei, Antonio\u2019s baby son\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Don Italo\n* Heidi Komarek as the model\n* Claudio G.

For English-speaking audiences, the title was changed to ''The Icicle Thief'', playing on the English title of De Sica's film.  This title was justified by changing the wording of the English subtitles when the characters talk about some chandeliers and one is stolen.  In the original Italian dialogue they are said to sparkle like pearls (''p\u00e8rle'') and drops of water (''gocce''), but in the English subtitles, they look \"like icicles\" (which in Italian would be ''ghiaccioli'').\n\n==Critical reception==\nReviewing the film for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Sheila Benson wrote, \"Bless the Italians and their obsession with movies. Having created a permanent niche in the hearts of the world's movie sentimentalists with ''Cinema Paradiso'', they now let loose their secret weapon, writer-director-actor and comic extraordinaire, Maurizio Nichetti\". She found ''The Icicle Thief'' to be an \"ingenious comedy\", adding, \"Pirandello rarely did it better and in ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' Woody Allen didn't get this nuttily complex\", before concluding that the film is \"a lot like its creator--slight, ingenious and sneakily irresistible\".<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times 7 September 1990\">{{cite news |last= Benson |first= Sheila |title= MOVIE REVIEW: 'Icicle Thief' an Ingenious Parody| url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-07/entertainment/ca-523_1_icicle-thief| date= 7 September 1990|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |location=Los Angeles| accessdate=15 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Desson Howe was less impressed, beginning by noting, \"The TV thing, right? It slices our sense of reality into 15-minute chunks. Its commercials ruin the dramatic integrity of the programs they interrupt. It turns us into dumb couch potatoes. It gives us limited attention spans. I said it gives us limited attention spans. These and other TV-loathing observations, as most of us have asserted in everything from organized junior-high class discussions to alcohol-induced dorm-room rantings, are inarguably true. But in ''The Icicle Thief'', a satirical fantasy about the way television butchers the movies it puts on, Italian film director Maurizio Nichetti 'discovers' these insights as though for the first time\". Howe goes on, \"The parts of ''Icicle'' [\u2026] that bash the boob tube comprise the film's least enlightening elements; they're facile, almost sophomoric. [\u2026] But the parts which reveal, without self-conscious underlinings, the trashy TV culture in which we live, as well as the TV commercial switcheroos, are where it's worth watching\". Overall, however, Howe concluded that: \"things become a little too convoluted and ''Icicle'' joins that crowded group of Italian movies with an apparent inability to understand the concept of excess. But, as with many such films, the inner spirit frequently carries you over, and although Nichetti tells us practically nothing new about the global village, he certainly has fun with the possibilities\".<ref name=\"Washington Post 7 September 1990\">{{cite news |last= Howe |first= Desson |title= 'The Icicle Thief' (NR)|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/theiciclethiefnrhowe_a0b299.htm| date= 7 September 1990|newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |location=Washington D.C.| accessdate= 15 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0097702|name=The Icicle Thief}}\n*{{mojo title|id=iciclethief|title=The Icicle Thief}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|the_icicle_thief}} \n*[http://www.moria.co.nz/fantasy/iciclethief.htm The Icicle Thief on moria.co.nz]\n\n{{MIFF Main Award|state=autocollapse}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Icicle Thief, The}}\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1989 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Maurizio Nichetti]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Manuel De Sica]]\n[[Category:Films set in Milan]]\n[[Category:Films partially in color]]\n[[Category:1980s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
