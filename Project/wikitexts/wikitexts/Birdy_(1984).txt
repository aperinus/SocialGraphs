Directed by [[Alan Parker]], it stars [[Matthew Modine]] and [[Nicolas Cage]]. Set in 1960s [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], the film focuses on the friendship between two teenage boys, Birdy (Modine) and Al Columbato (Cage). The story is presented in [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], with a [[frame story|frame narrative]] depicting their traumatic experiences upon serving in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nParker initially turned down an opportunity to direct, believing that the complex book could not be successfully adapted for a feature film. The project resurfaced in 1982 when A&M Films, a subsidiary of [[A&M Records]], acquired the film rights and commissioned Sandy Kroopf and Jack Behr to write the screenplay. Upon reading the script, Parker returned as director, and the film continued development at [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]]. [[Principal photography]] began in May 1984 and concluded in August of that year. Filming took place on locations in Philadelphia and [[Santa Clara, California]]. The film is notable for being the first to be partially shot with the [[Skycam]], a computer-controlled camera system created by [[Steadicam]] inventor [[Garrett Brown]]. The [[film score|score]] was composed by [[Peter Gabriel]].\n\n''Birdy'' opened in [[limited release]] on December 12, 1984. It underperformed at the North American box office, grossing only $1.4 million against a budget of $12 million. The film received mostly positive reviews, and has an approval rating of 83% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. ''Birdy'' was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review: Top Ten Films|Top Ten Films]] of 1984, and won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury]] prize at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn a 1960s working-class neighborhood in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], a teenage boy nicknamed \"Birdy\" befriends his next-door neighbor Al Columbato, and relates to him his fascination with birds and their ability to fly. The two begin pursuing Birdy's hobby of catching pigeons and caging them in a large, wooden aviary that he has built outside his parents' home. One night, they climb atop a refinery building, where Birdy hangs on the ledge to catch the pigeons roosting on it. Birdy loses his grip and falls several stories, but lands on a pile of sand. Slightly dazed, he tells Al that during the fall, he flew. After Birdy is hospitalized for minor injuries, his parents dismantle the aviary.\n\nBirdy concedes to Al's wishes of pursuing another venture. After they purchase a 1953 Ford and restore it, Al's father registers the vehicle. Al drives Birdy to an [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City boardwalk]], but they are arrested the next day after Mr. Columbato reports the car stolen. After bailing the boys out of jail, Mr. Columbato sells the vehicle. Birdy later confronts him, claiming that the car was not his to sell, and refuses a sum of money offered to him on principle.\n\nBirdy builds a new aviary in his bedroom and purchases two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso after his friend. Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses that he wants to die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.\n\nUpon graduation, Al enlists and Birdy is drafted into the [[United States Army]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Birdy is placed in a mental hospital after being [[missing in action]] for a month. A [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals that he was the sole survivor of a helicopter crash. Al is hospitalized in the same facility, his face heavily bandaged for injuries that he sustained from an exploding bomb. Major Weiss, a military doctor, informs him that, although Birdy's injuries are relatively minor, he has not spoken since he was found. Al speaks to Birdy at length, but grows increasingly frustrated by his lack of response. He is then elated when Birdy smiles at a joke he makes. Weiss dismisses the response as [[Dissociative disorder|dissociative behavior]].\n\nAl suspects Birdy of feigning insanity to hide from the world, and expresses to him that he too wishes to hide due to his own injuries. Birdy unexpectedly responds by telling Al that he is \"full of shit\". Al alerts Weiss to Birdy's response, but when the doctor arrives, Birdy remains silent. Not seeing any progress, Weiss orders Al to leave, but Al pushes the doctor aside. After Weiss flees, two orderlies are sent in to subdue Al, who fights them off and takes Birdy to the roof of the hospital. Birdy rushes to the ledge, raises his arms and jumps off the side of the roof as if he were about to fly. Al runs over to the ledge and finds Birdy on another level of the roof perfectly fine.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as \"Birdy\"\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Alfonso \"Al\" Columbato\n* [[John Harkins (actor)|John Harkins]] as Dr. / Major Weiss\n* [[Sandy Baron]] as Mr. Columbato\n* [[Karen Young (actress)|Karen Young]] as Hannah Rourke\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Phil Renaldi\n* Nancy Fish as Mrs. Prevost\n* George Buck as Birdy's Father\n* Dolores Sage as Birdy's Mother\n* Robert L.
