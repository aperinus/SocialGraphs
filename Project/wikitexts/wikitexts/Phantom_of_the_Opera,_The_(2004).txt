Produced and co-written by Lloyd Webber and directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], it stars [[Gerard Butler]] in the title role, with [[Emmy Rossum]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Minnie Driver]], and [[Jennifer Ellison]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was announced in 1989, although production did not start until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was shot entirely at [[Pinewood Studios]], with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and was provided with music lessons prior to filming. ''The Phantom of the Opera'' grossed $154.6&nbsp;million worldwide, and received neutral reviews from critics, but was well-received by audiences. Critics praised the visuals and acting, particularly the performances of Butler and Rossum, but criticized the writing, directing and unnecessary deviations from the stage version.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1919, in Paris, a [[public auction]] is held to clear a dilapidated [[opera house]]'s vaults. The elderly [[Viscount Raoul de Chagny]] bids against [[Madame Giry]], the retired ballet instructor of the theatre, for a [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] music box shaped like a [[barrel organ]] with the figure of a cymbal-playing [[monkey]] attached to it. The auctioneer presents a repaired [[chandelier]], relating it to \"the strange affair of the [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Phantom of the Opera]]\". As it is hoisted up to the roof, the story moves back to 1870.\n\nThe theatre prepares for the performance of the grand opera, ''Hannibal'', headed by soprano [[Carlotta (The Phantom of the Opera)|Carlotta Giudicelli]]. Theatre manager Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre plans to retire, leaving the theatre under the ownership of Richard Firmin and Gilles Andr\u00e9, who introduce their patron, the young Raoul. One of the dancers, [[Christine Daa\u00e9]], recognizes Raoul as a childhood sweetheart, and wonders if he will also recognize her, but he leaves without seeing her.\n\nCarlotta refuses to perform after being tormented for three years by the theatre's resident \"Opera Ghost\", a mysterious figure said to live in the [[catacombs]] below. Facing the performance's cancellation, Madame Giry suggests that Christine stands in as the lead actress. Christine displays her singing talent and is a huge success on opening night.\n\nChristine tells her best friend [[Meg Giry|Meg]], Giry's daughter, that she is being coached by a tutor she calls the \"Angel of Music\". Christine reunites with Raoul, in whom she confides that she has been visited by the Angel of Music her deceased father promised he would send her after his death. Raoul, however, dismisses Christine's story. That night, the masked Opera Ghost, known as the \"Phantom\", appears before Christine from her dressing room mirror, spiriting her away to his underground lair. After the Phantom shows Christine a mannequin of her dressed in a [[wedding dress]] he made for her, Christine faints and sleeps in the Phantom's lair. It is presumed by this point that Christine has been missing.\n\nOnce Christine awakes and sees the Phantom, she removes his mask out of curiosity. The Phantom reacts violently and covers his face with his hand. After the duo have a moment of understanding, Christine returns the mask to the Phantom and the latter then returns her to the theatre unharmed but orders the managers to make her the lead in ''Il Muto''. However, the managers choose Carlotta instead. During the performance, the Phantom switches Carlotta's throat spray, causing her to sing out of tune, and she is replaced by Christine. The Phantom encounters [[stagehand]] [[Joseph Buquet]] and hangs him above the stage. Christine and Raoul flee to the roof, where they declare their love for each other. The Phantom, now heartbroken after witnessing the whole scene, vows revenge.\n\nThree months later, in 1871, at a New Year [[masquerade ball]], Christine and Raoul announce their engagement. The Phantom crashes the ball and orders his own opera, ''Don Juan Triumphant'', to be performed. Upon seeing Christine's engagement ring, the Phantom steals it and flees, pursued by Raoul, but Giry stops him. Giry explains that when she was younger, she met the Phantom, a deformed young boy, billed in a [[freak show]] and abused by the owner. When the Phantom rebelled and strangled the owner to death, Giry helped him evade the resulting mob and hid him within the opera house. The next day, Christine pays a visit to her father's tomb with the Phantom posing as his spirit to win her back, but Raoul intervenes. The Phantom and Raoul engage in a duel with each other before Raoul eventually knocks the Phantom down and flees with Christine.\n\nRaoul and the managers formulate a plan to capture the Phantom during his opera. The Phantom murders the lead tenor, Ubaldo Piangi, and takes his place to sing with Christine. During their passionate duet, Christine unmasks the Phantom, revealing his deformity to the horrified audience. The Phantom then abducts Christine and retreats as he causes the chandelier to crash and set the opera house on fire to cover his tracks, but a [[mobbing|mob]] forms to hunt him down. Giry leads Raoul down to the Phantom's lair to rescue Christine, while Meg leads the mob there as well.\n\nThe Phantom has Christine wear the wedding dress and proposes marriage. Christine tries to reason with him by admitting that she only fears his malicious acts, not his appearance. When Raoul arrives, the Phantom threatens to kill him unless Christine weds him. Pitying the Phantom, Christine kisses him. Moved by her kindness, the Phantom allows the lovers to leave. Comforted by the music box, the Phantom weeps alone and Christine lets him keep her engagement ring as a memento. He then escapes before the mob arrives, with Meg finding only his discarded mask.\n\nBack in the present, Raoul visits the recently deceased Christine's grave and places the Phantom's music box before it. Before leaving, he notices a freshly laid rose with Christine's ring attached to its stem, implying that the Phantom is still alive and will always love her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]]\n* [[Emmy Rossum]] as [[Christine Daa\u00e9]] \n* [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] as [[Viscount Raoul de Chagny|Raoul de Chagny]]\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as [[Madame Giry]]\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Carlotta (The Phantom of the Opera)|Carlotta Giudicelli]]\n** [[Margaret Preece]] as Carlotta's singing voice except for \"[[Learn to Be Lonely]]\"\n* [[Simon Callow]] as Gilles Andr\u00e9\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Richard Firmin\n* [[Victor McGuire]] as Ubaldo Piangi\n* [[Jennifer Ellison]] as [[Meg Giry]]\n* [[Murray Melvin]] as [[Ernest Reyer|Monsieur Reyer]]\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as [[Joseph Buquet]]\n* [[James Fleet]] as Monsieur Lef\u00e8vre\n* [[Ramin Karimloo]] as Gustave Daa\u00e9\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Warner Bros.]] purchased the [[film rights]] to ''The Phantom of the Opera'' in early 1989, granting Andrew Lloyd Webber total [[artistic control]].<ref name=preview/> Despite interest from [[A-list]] directors, Lloyd Webber and Warner Bros. instantly hired Joel Schumacher to direct; Lloyd Webber had been impressed with Schumacher's use of music in ''[[The Lost Boys]]''.<ref name=DVD/> The duo wrote the screenplay that same year,<ref name=pro/> while [[Michael Crawford]] and [[Sarah Brightman]] were cast to reprise their roles from the original stage production.
