The picture was directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Johanna Harwood]], based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[From Russia, with Love (novel)| 1957 novel ''From Russia, with Love'']]. In the film, Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet [[consulate]] clerk [[Tatiana Romanova]] in [[Turkey]], where [[SPECTRE]] plans to avenge Bond's killing of [[Julius No|Dr. No]]. The film followed ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) and was followed by ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964).\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', [[United Artists]] greenlit a sequel and doubled the budget available for the producers. In addition to filming on location in Turkey, the action scenes were shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and in [[Scotland]]. Production ran over budget and schedule, and was rushed to finish by its scheduled October 1963 release date.\n\n''From Russia with Love'' was a critical and commercial success. It took in more than $78 million in worldwide box-office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor ''Dr. No'', thereby becoming a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] in 1960s cinema. The film is considered one of the best entries in the series, both by critics and general audience.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Runner Up: From Russia with Love|url=https://preview.reelviews.net/top100/103.html|access-date=2022-01-12|website=preview.reelviews.net}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2022}} In 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time, making it the only James Bond film to appear on the list.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2004-10-03|title=Get Carter tops British film poll|language=en-GB|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3711460.stm|access-date=2022-01-12}}</ref> It was also the first film in the series to win a [[BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Film in 1964 {{!}} BAFTA Awards|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1964/film|access-date=2022-01-12|website=awards.bafta.org}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nSeeking revenge against [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond]] for the death of their agent [[Julius No|Dr. No]] in [[Jamaica]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=Notes|As depicted in the 1962 film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.}} international criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]] begins training agents to kill him, before assigning the task to Irish assassin Donald \"Red\" Grant. To lure Bond into a trap, SPECTRE's chief planner, [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak]] chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Kronsteen, devises a plan to have Bond attempt to procure a Lektor [[cryptography]] device from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s from the Soviet consulate in [[Istanbul]]. SPECTRE operative [[Rosa Klebb]], a former [[SMERSH]] (Soviet counter-intelligence) colonel, is assigned to oversee the mission and to ensure Grant can carry out Bond's assassination at the right moment. To set the trap, Klebb recruits a cipher clerk at the consulate, [[Tatiana Romanova]], to unwittingly assist in the plan, tricking Romanova into believing Klebb is still working for SMERSH.\n\nIn [[London]], Bond is called to a meeting with [[M (James Bond)|M]] and informed that Romanova has requested Bond's help to defect to the West, in exchange for providing British intelligence a Lektor. Exactly as Kronsteen predicted, M suspects a trap but decides to honour Romanova's request. Before departing, Bond is given a special [[Briefcase|attach\u00e9 case]] by [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], containing several defensive gadgets and an [[ArmaLite AR-7]] sniper rifle, to help on his assignment. Upon arriving in Istanbul, Bond works alongside the head of MI6's branch in the city, [[List of James Bond allies#Film allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], while he awaits word from Romanova. During this time, Kerim is attacked by Soviet agent Krilencu, who causes problems for the men, unaware that Grant is shadowing Bond to protect him until he steals the Lektor. After an attack on the men while they hide out at a [[Romani people|gypsy]] settlement, Kerim assassinates Krilencu with Bond's help before he can flee the city.\n\nEventually, Romanova meets Bond at his hotel suite, where she agrees to provide plans to the consulate for him to help him steal the Lektor. The pair spend the night together, unaware SPECTRE is filming them as part of Kronsteen's plan. Upon receiving the consulate's floor plans from Romanova, Bond and Kerim make a plan to steal the Lektor, before all three make haste to escape the city aboard the ''[[Orient Express]]''. Once aboard, Kerim discovers a Soviet security officer tailed them, forcing Bond to help him subdue the officer. While Kerim remains with the officer to prevent him escaping, Bond returns to Romanova to wait for their rendezvous with one of Kerim's men. However, Grant kills Kerim and the officer, forcing Bond to remain on the train and question Romanova's motive.\n\nWhen the train arrives in [[Belgrade]], Bond passes on news of Kerim's death to one of his sons waiting for them and receives instructions to travel to [[Zagreb]] and rendezvous with a British agent named Nash. However, the man he meets is actually Grant, who has already killed Nash and assumed his identity. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond. He quickly reveals that Romanova was a pawn in SPECTRE's plan and that Grant intends to kill both and stage it as a murder-suicide, leaving behind faked blackmail evidence that will scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond tricks Grant into setting off a booby trap in his attach\u00e9 case before killing him. Taking the Lektor and the film of their night together, Bond and Romanova leave the train in [[Istria]], Yugoslavia and use Grant's escape plan. They evade helicopter and boat attacks by SPECTRE agents before reaching safety.\n\nLearning of Grant's death and Bond's survival, SPECTRE's enigmatic chairman (Number 1) has Kronsteen executed for his plan's disastrous failure. As the organisation promised to sell back the Lektor to the Russians, Klebb is ordered to recover it and kill Bond. Klebb reaches the pair, while they are resting in a hotel in [[Venice]], and sneaks into their room disguised as a maid. Klebb orders Romanova to leave the room while holding Bond at gunpoint. Romanova then re-enters, tackling Klebb and knocking the pistol to the ground. Klebb and Bond struggle, and Romanova picks up the pistol and kills Klebb. With their mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova spend some time on a romantic boat ride and Bond throws the film into the canal.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent 007.\n* [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]] as [[List of James Bond allies#Film allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], head of MI6 Station T in Istanbul.

Hunt and Young came up with the idea of moving the Red Grant training sequence to the beginning of the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since.

The craft sank into 40\u201350 feet (12\u201315&nbsp;m) of water<!-- John Stears -->, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work.

One of the most significant changes to the story is the replacement of the organisation [[SPECTRE]] to OCTOPUS because the name SPECTRE constituted a long-running [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|legal dispute]] over the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' between United Artists/MGM and writer [[Kevin McClory]]. Most of the cast from the film returned in likeness. Connery not only allowed his 1960s likeness as Bond to be used, but the actor, in his 70s, also recorded the character's dialogue, marking a return to the role 22 years after he last played Bond in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. Featuring a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[deathmatch]] mode, the game depicts several elements of later Bond films, such as the [[Aston Martin DB5]] from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and the rocket belt from ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/james-bond-007-from-russia-with-love/654415p1.html|title=Interview with David Carson|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=29 September 2005|access-date=8 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/fromrussiawithlove/review.html|title=From Russia With Love Review|last=Navarro|first=Alex|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1 November 2005|access-date=8 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324041325/http://www.gamespot.com/from-russia-with-love/reviews/from-russia-with-love-review-6137026/|archive-date=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe game was written by [[Bruce Feirstein]], who had previously worked on the film scripts for ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', and the 2004 video game, ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]''.
