Omori portrays the title character, a psychologically damaged man who is manipulated into assaulting or killing rival faction members of feuding ''[[yakuza]]'' gangs while being pursued by a sadomasochistic enforcer (Asano).\n\nThe film has garnered controversy due to its graphic depictions of violence and cruelty, and has been banned in several countries.<ref name=bloody>{{Cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3517878/butcher-block-takashi-miikes-extreme-gorefest-ichi-killer/#:~:text=It%20was%20banned%20in%20Norway,might%20actually%20use%20when%20watching.|title=&#91;Butcher Block&#93; Takashi Miike's Extreme Gorefest 'Ichi the Killer'|date=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nIchi is on a balcony, masturbating while spying on a [[pimp]] raping and assaulting a [[prostitute]]. When the pimp discovers him, he flees.\n\nA sadistic ''[[yakuza]]'' boss named Anjo has been massacred. A cleaning crew run by Jijii removes all traces of Anjo's blood and entrails, and credits Ichi for the slaughter. Later, Kakihara, Anjo's [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] high-ranking enforcer, and other crime lords visit the spotless apartment, concluding that Anjo fled town with the prostitute and [[yen|\u00a5]]3 million of the gang's money. Kakihara visits an underworld night club with other gang members. He tells Anjo's girlfriend, an English-speaking Chinese prostitute named Karen, that Anjo must still be alive, perhaps kidnapped by a rival gang. Jijii feeds Kakihara rumors that Suzuki, a member of the rival Funaki clan, has kidnapped Anjo. Kakihara captures Suzuki and tortures him, but when Suzuki turns out to be innocent, Kakihara slices off the end of his own tongue and offers it to Suzuki's boss as penance.\n\nKakihara and other gang members capture Kano, a drug-addled member of the cleaning crew. He reveals that although he helped clean up the murder scene, it was Ichi who killed Anjo, and that Kakihara has now been targeted. Later, Ichi returns to the pimp's balcony to again watch him brutalize Sailor, a prostitute whom Ichi is a regular patron of. A crying Ichi intervenes, killing the pimp and telling Sailor that he will now be the one to assault her. When Sailor tries to defend herself, Ichi reflexively kills her.\n\nAt Suzuki's prompting, Kakihara is kicked out of the [[organized crime|syndicate]], but the entire Anjo gang defects with him. Suzuki then promises Jijii a million yen to \"squash\" Kakihara. Jijii, it is revealed, is secretly orchestrating events in order to pit ''yakuza'' clans against one another, with the help of Ichi. Though normally unassuming and cowardly, Ichi becomes [[homicide|homicidal]] and sexually aroused when enraged. Jijii is able to manipulate Ichi by implanting several [[false memories]]\u2014a [[Secondary education in Japan|high school]] rape in particular\u2014and uses Ichi as a killing machine.\n\nOne evening, Ichi kicks one of three bullies attacking a boy named Takeshi. Takeshi is the son of Kaneko, one of Kakihara's henchmen. Jijii incites Ichi to enter an apartment containing several members of the old Anjo gang, and slaughter them all. Afterward, Ichi sees Takeshi, who thanks him for the earlier protection. Kaneko finds a brothel-keeper assaulting Ichi in an alley and, remembering his own long-ago rescue by a member of the Anjo gang, helps Ichi out.\n\nKakihara enlists the help of [[Police corruption|corrupt]] twin police [[detective]]s, Jir\u014d and Sabur\u014d, to find Myu-Myu, a prostitute connected with Ryu Long, a member of Jijii's gang. When Jir\u014d fails to get information from her through torture, Sabur\u014d tracks Long down. Though Long outruns the brothers, Kakihara captures him so the twins can torture him for leads to Jijii. Meanwhile, Jijii has Karen seduce Ichi by pretending to be the raped woman from his false memory. When Ichi becomes confused by Karen's claims that she desired for him to rape and assault her, he kills her. Jijii informs Kakihara that Ichi is coming to kill him but is spotted by Takayama, one of Kakihara's men. After a pursuit, Jijii, who is surprisingly muscular, disarms Takayama and kills him. Ichi then arrives at Kakihara's base, where he kills Jir\u014d and Sabur\u014d.\n\nKaneko, Kakihara and Ichi chase each other to a rooftop. Due to Jijii's [[psychological manipulation]], Ichi believes that Kaneko is his brother and confronts him. Kaneko shoots Ichi's leg, and Ichi slits Kaneko's throat in front of Takeshi. Takeshi attacks Ichi as he lies on the roof crying. Believing Ichi to be too unstable to hurt him, Kakihara inserts his skewers into his ears to drown out Ichi's cries. He suddenly sees that Ichi has decapitated Takeshi. Ichi charges Kakihara, embedding a bladed boot into his forehead. Kakihara falls from the roof to his death. However, when Jijii finds him, Kakihara has no wound in his head; he hallucinated both Takeshi's murder and Ichi's attack as he jumped to his death while Ichi cried.\n\nYears later, Jijii's corpse hangs from a tree in a park. A young man resembling an older Takeshi leaves the park with a group of schoolchildren.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as Kakihara, a ''[[yakuza]]'' [[Mob enforcer|enforcer]] who worked for Anjo.\n* [[Nao Omori]] as Ichi, a [[psychotic]] and [[sexually repressed]] man who becomes reflexively murderous when aroused.\n* [[Shinya Tsukamoto]] as Jijii, Ichi's mysterious handler responsible for the murders he commits\n* [[Alien Sun]] as Karen, an English-speaking [[Zainichi Chinese]] [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who is a friend of Jijii's and ex-girlfriend of the sadistic ''yakuza'' boss, Anjo.\n* [[Sabu (director)|Sabu]] as Kaneko, one of Kakihara's [[henchmen]]\n* [[Susumu Terajima]] as Suzuki, a ''yakuza'' gangster who is a member of the notorious Funaki clan\n* [[Shun Sugata]] as Takayama\n* Toru Tezuka as Fujiwara\n* Yoshiki Arizono as Nakazawa\n* [[Kiyohiko Shibukawa]] as Ryu Long, a Zainichi Chinese gangster and member of Jijii's expert cleaning crew and gang\n* Satoshi Niizuma as Inoue\n* [[Suzuki Matsuo]] as Jir\u014d & Sabur\u014d, a pair of [[twin brother]]s and corrupt detectives from [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]] \n* [[Jun Kunimura]] as Funaki, the head of the powerful Funaki clan, a notorious ''yakuza'' syndicate\n* Moro Morooka as Coffee Shop Manager\n* Houka Kinoshita as Sailor's lover\n* Hiroshi Kobayashi as Takeshi, Kaneko's young son\n* Mai Goto as Sailor, a prostitute who is object of desire of Ichi\n* Rio Aoki as Miyuki (\"Myu-Myu\"), a prostitute connected with Ryu Long\n* Noko Morishita as Pub patron\n* Setchin Kawaya as Pub proprietor\n* Yuki Kazamatsuri as Yakuza Girl\n* [[Sakichi Sat\u014d]] as Man kicking Ichi\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe soundtrack was written and produced by Karera Musication, a side project of the Japanese band [[Boredoms]], under the direction of ex-guitarist [[Seiichi Yamamoto]] and percussionist/band leader [[Yoshimi P-We]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leone|first1=Dominique|title=Karera Musication: Koroshiya Ichi|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4389-koroshiya-ichi/|website=Pitchfork|access-date=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nFilm journalist [[Tom Mes]] has suggested that the film is in fact a very sophisticated assessment of violence and its relation to the media and implicating the audience. He writes that \"It's a paradox, but ''Ichi the Killer'', a film that sets new boundaries in the portrayal of violence and bloodshed, takes a strongly critical stance towards the portrayal and the consumption of the violent image. However, it does so without ever taking a moral stance towards either the portrayal or the consumption, thus circumventing any accusations of hypocrisy on the part of the director. Miike does not moralise or chastise, but provokes the audience into questioning their own attitudes towards viewing images of violence. He steers them into a direction but leaves it up to them to draw their own conclusion\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mes|first1=Tom|editor1-last= Mathijs|editor1-first= Ernest |editor2-last=Mendik|editor2-first=Xavier|title=The Cult Film Reader|date=2008|publisher=Maidenhead : McGraw Hill/Open University Press|isbn=978-0335219230|page=361}}</ref>\n\nMes is also very critical of the edits made to the film. He argues that \"The film as a whole is a completely cohesive unity, in that all of its parts are absolutely crucial to the functioning of the whole. Any attempt at censorship or toning down the violence will have the opposite effect and will in fact make the film ''more'' exploitative and thereby undermine its critical stance. Excising scenes of violence, particularly the 'painful' scenes, will harm the symbiosis between the 'playful' and the 'painful' violence, which forms the basis for Miike's critical approach\".<ref>Mes, p. 367</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere in the Midnight Madness section at the [[2001 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 14 September 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/markets-festivals/killer-stalks-toronto-1117851591/|title='Killer' stalks Toronto|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=22 August 2001|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/features/tiff-mini-reviews-friday-september-14/|title=TIFF Mini Reviews: Friday, September 14|work=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]|date=30 August 2001|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref> It was released in Japan on 22 December 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://report.cinematopics.com/archives/23514|title=\u300c\u5c11\u5e74\u30fb\u5c11\u5973\u3088\u3001\u7a81\u7834\u305b\u3088\uff01\u300d\uff08\u4e09\u6c60\u76e3\u7763\uff09 \u300e\u6bba\u3057\u5c4b\uff11\u300f\u521d\u65e5\u821e\u53f0\u6328\u62f6\u958b\u50ac\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002|work=Cinema Topics|language=ja|date=23 January 2001|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs a publicity gimmick, barf bags were received by viewers out at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) to those attending the midnight screening of this movie.
