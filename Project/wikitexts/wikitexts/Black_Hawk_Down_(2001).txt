It is based on the 1999 [[non-fiction]] [[Black Hawk Down (book)|book of the same name]] by journalist [[Mark Bowden]], about the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|U.S. military's 1993 raid in Mogadishu]]. The film features a large [[ensemble cast]], including [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Eric Bana]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Jason Isaacs]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Jeremy Piven]], [[Ioan Gruffudd]], [[Ewen Bremner]], [[Hugh Dancy]], and [[Tom Hardy]] in his first film role. [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Ty Burrell]], and [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] also have minor roles.\n\n''Black Hawk Down'' had a limited release on December 28, 2001, and went into the public on January 18, 2002. The film received positive reviews from film critics, although it was criticized for inaccuracies, and sparked controversy for its portrayal of Somalis. The film performed modestly well at the box office, grossing $172 million worldwide against a production budget of $92 to $110 million. ''Black Hawk Down'' won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]].<ref name=\"Oscars2002\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/74th-winners.html |title=The 74th Academy Awards (2002) Nominees and Winners |access-date=November 19, 2011 |website=Oscars.org}}</ref> In 2006, an extended cut of the film was released on DVD.

After the bulk of the peacekeepers withdraw, the Mogadishu-based militia loyal to [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]] declares war on the remaining UN personnel. In response, U.S. President [[William Clinton|Clinton]] deploys Task Force Ranger - consisting of [[3rd Ranger Battalion|3rd Battalion]]/[[75th Ranger Regiment]], [[Delta Force]] operators, and flight crew of the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th SOAR]] &ndash; to Mogadishu to capture Aidid, who has proclaimed himself president.\n\nTo consolidate his power and subdue the population in the south, Aidid and his militia seize Red Cross food shipments. The UN forces are powerless to intervene directly. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force capture [[Osman Atto|Osman Ali Atto]], a faction leader selling arms to Aidid's militia. The US then plans a mission to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers.\n\nThe U.S. forces include experienced men as well as new recruits, including 18-year-old [[Private First Class#United States Army|Private First Class]] Todd Blackburn and [[Specialist (rank)#United States|Specialist]] John Grimes, a desk clerk. [[Staff Sergeant#U.S. Army|Staff Sergeant]] Matthew Eversmann receives his first command, of Ranger [[Chalk (military)|Chalk]] Four, after his lieutenant has a seizure. Eversmann responds to mocking remarks about Somalis from fellow soldiers by saying he respects the Somalis and has compassion for the terrible conditions of civil war for the Somali people, saying there are two things they can do, \"We can help, or we can sit back and watch a country destroy itself on CNN.\"\n\nThe operation begins, and Delta Force operators capture Aidid's advisers inside the target building, while the Rangers and helicopters escorting the ground-extraction convoy take heavy fire. Blackburn is severely injured when he falls from one of the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters, so three Humvees led by [[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] [[Jeff Struecker]] are detached from the convoy to return Blackburn to the UN-held [[Mogadishu Airport]]. During the ensuing battle, Grimes was separated from the rest of Eversmann's chalk after surviving a RPG explosion.\n\n[[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] Dominick Pilla is shot and killed just as Struecker's column departs, and shortly thereafter Black Hawk ''Super Six-One'', piloted by [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Chief Warrant Officer]] Clifton \"Elvis\" Wolcott, is shot down by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]]. Wolcott and his co-pilot are killed, the two crew chiefs are wounded, and two Delta Force snipers on board, escape in an [[MH-6 Little Bird]] helicopter but Busch dies later from his wounds.\n\nThe ground forces are rerouted to converge on the crash site. The Somali militia erects roadblocks, and [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Danny McKnight's Humvee column is unable to reach the crash area and sustains heavy casualties. Meanwhile, two Ranger chalks, including Eversmann's unit, reach ''Super-Six One''{{'}}s crash site and set up a defensive perimeter to await evacuation with the two wounded men and the fallen pilots. In the interim, ''Super Six-Four'', piloted by Chief Warrant Officer [[Michael Durant]], is also shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade and crashes several blocks away.\n\nWith [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Michael D. Steele|Mike Steele]]'s Rangers pinned down and sustaining heavy casualties, no ground forces can reach ''Super Six-Four''{{'}}s crash site or reinforce the Rangers defending ''Super Six-One''. Two Delta Force snipers, [[Sergeant First Class#United States Army|Sergeant First Class]] [[Randy Shughart]] and [[Master Sergeant#United States|Master Sergeant]] [[Gary Gordon]], are inserted by helicopter to ''Super Six-Four''{{'}}s crash site, where they find Durant still alive. The site is eventually overrun, Gordon and Shughart are killed, and Durant is captured by Aidid's militia.\n\nMcKnight's column relinquishes their attempt to reach ''Six-One''{{'}}s crash site, and returns to base with their prisoners and the casualties. The men prepare to go back to extract the Rangers and the fallen pilots, and Major General Garrison sends Lieutenant Colonel Joe Cribbs to ask for reinforcements from the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], including Malaysian and Pakistani armored units from the UN coalition.\n\nAs night falls, Aidid's militia launches a sustained assault on the trapped Americans at ''Super Six-One''{{'}}s crash site. The militants are held off throughout the night by strafing runs and rocket attacks from [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|AH-6J Little Bird]] helicopter gunships until the 10th Mountain Division's relief column is able to reach the American soldiers. The wounded and casualties are evacuated in the vehicles, but a few Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are [[Mogadishu Mile|forced to run on foot]] from the crash site to reach the Safe Zone at the stadium.\n\n;End titles\nThe end titles recount the immediate aftermath of the mission and end of US military operations in Somalia: Michael Durant was released after 11 days of captivity, after which [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] withdrew all US forces from Somalia. During the raid, 19 American soldiers and more than 1,000 Somalis died. The names of the 19 soldiers who died, including Delta Sgts. Gordon and Shughart, the first soldiers to receive [[Medal of Honor|the Medal of Honor]] posthumously since the [[Vietnam War]], are listed by name. Mohamed Farah Aidid was killed in 1996; General Garrison retired the following day.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col |colwidth=22em}}\n\n; [[75th Ranger Regiment]]\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as [[Staff Sergeant|SSG]] Matt Eversmann\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Specialist (rank)|SPC]] John \"Grimesey\" Grimes (based on SPC John Stebbins)\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|LTC]] [[Danny McKnight]]\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as SPC Shawn Nelson\n* [[Gabriel Casseus]] as SPC Mike Kurth\n* [[Hugh Dancy]] as [[Sergeant First Class|SFC]] Kurt \"Doc\" Schmid\n* [[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Lieutenant|LT]] John Beales\n* [[Tom Guiry]] as [[Sergeant (rank)|SGT]] Ed Yurek\n* [[Charlie Hofheimer]] as [[Corporal|CPL]] Jamie Smith\n* [[Danny Hoch]] as SGT Dominick Pilla\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Captain (United States O-3)|CPT]] [[Michael D.

''[[Newsweek]]'' writer Evan Thomas considered the movie one of the most culturally significant films of the [[George W. Bush presidency]]. He suggested that although the film was presented as being anti-war, it was at its core pro-war. He further wrote that \"though it depicted a shameful defeat, the soldiers were heroes willing to die for their brothers in arms ... The movie showed brutal scenes of killing, but also courage, stoicism and honor ...

The bravery of the U.S. troops notwithstanding, we deserved equal, if not more, credit; but the filmmakers depicted the incident as involving only Americans.<ref>{{cite book|author=Musharraf, Pervez |title=In the Line of Fire: A Memoir|url=https://archive.org/details/inlineoffirememo00mush |url-access=registration |publisher=Free Press|date= 2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/inlineoffirememo00mush/page/76 76]|isbn=9780743283441 }}</ref>}}Somalis attending a screening of a pirated copy of the film at a theater in Mogadishu claimed the film ignored the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of civilian adults and children caused by the Americans.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=January 25, 2002 |title=Somalis Watch Black Hawk Down {{!}} On the Media |url=https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/131792-somalis-watch-black-hawk-down |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125105128/https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/131792-somalis-watch-black-hawk-down |archive-date=November 25, 2020 |access-date=January 24, 2021 |website=WNYC Studios |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Mogadishu Mile===\nIt is often believed that the soldiers involved in the [[Mogadishu Mile]] had to run all the way to the [[Mogadiscio Stadium]], as shown in the film. However, in that scene the filmmakers took artistic license and dramatized the event, departing from the book. In the film, the Mogadishu Mile ends with about a dozen soldiers entering the Mogadiscio Stadium having run all the way through the city. In the book, it ends with soldiers reaching a rendezvous point on National Street (in the opposite direction from the stadium):\n\n{{blockquote|\n\"As he approached the intersection of Hawlwadig Road and National Street, about five blocks south of the Olympic Hotel, he saw a tank and the line of APCs and Humvees and a mass of men in desert battle dress.
