A sequel to the 1991 film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', the plot follows  disgraced [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agent [[Clarice Starling]] as she attempts to apprehend cannibalistic serial killer [[Hannibal Lecter]] before his surviving victim, [[Mason Verger]], captures him. [[Anthony Hopkins]] reprises his role as Lecter, while [[Julianne Moore]] replaces [[Jodie Foster]] as Starling and [[Gary Oldman]] plays Verger. [[Ray Liotta]], [[Frankie R. Faison]], [[Giancarlo Giannini]], and [[Francesca Neri]] also star.\n\nFollowing the release of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', Harris spent several years writing a sequel novel. Foster and ''Silence of the Lambs'' director [[Jonathan Demme]] initially planned to return for the sequel, but they and screenwriter [[Ted Tally]] declined because they found it too lurid. Scott became attached while directing ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000), and signed on after reading the script pitched by [[Dino De Laurentiis]], who had produced ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (1986), the first Lecter film. [[David Mamet]] and [[Steven Zaillian]] wrote the screenplay, and principal photography commenced in May 2000, lasting sixteen weeks.\n\n''Hannibal'' was released on 9 February 2001, ten years after ''The Silence of the Lambs''. It was highly anticipated and broke box office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"indeptaste\">{{cite news|title=Taste of success |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article253462.ece |work=The Independent |location=London |date=20 February 2001 |access-date=9 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171355/http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article253462.ece |archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref> and grossed $351.6 million during its theatrical run.

It was followed by a prequel, ''[[Red Dragon (2002 film)|Red Dragon]]'', in 2002, with Hopkins reprising his role as Lecter.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nA decade after tracking down serial killer [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Jame Gumb]],{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).}} [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent [[Clarice Starling]] is blamed for a botched drug raid which resulted in the deaths of six people. Starling is contacted by [[Mason Verger]], the only surviving victim of the [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] serial killer [[Hannibal Lecter]], who has been missing since escaping custody during the Gumb investigation. A wealthy [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]], Verger was paralyzed and disfigured by Lecter during a therapy session. He has been pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture, and kill Lecter ever since. Using his wealth and political influence, Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter's case, hoping her involvement will draw Lecter out.\n\nAfter learning of Starling's disgrace, Lecter sends her a letter. A perfume expert identifies a fragrance on the letter: skin cream with ingredients only available to a few shops in the world. She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. In [[Florence]], Chief Inspector Rinaldo [[Pazzi family|Pazzi]] is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as Dr. Fell, the assistant curator and caretaker.\n\nRecognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape, Pazzi accesses the [[Violent Criminal Apprehension Program]] database of wanted fugitives. He learns of Verger's US$3 million personal bounty on Lecter. Seeking the bounty, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings and attempts to capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter's fingerprint to show Verger as proof. The pickpocket manages to get the print and gives it to Pazzi, but is fatally wounded in the process when Lecter severs his [[femoral artery]]. Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], ties him up, [[Disembowelment|disembowels]] him, and hangs him from the balcony.\n\nVerger bribes [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] official Paul Krendler to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter then gets Starling to come to [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] while speaking with her through mobile phones. Verger's men, having trailed Starling, capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of [[wild boar]]s bred for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard. Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break through the doors, devouring the two guards but ignoring Lecter. Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter.  At Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen with Lecter offering to take the blame. Lecter carries Starling away while Verger is eaten alive by his own boars.\n\nLecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake house and treats her wound. When Krendler arrives, Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by morphine and dressed in a cocktail dress, awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she watches in horror as Lecter opens Krendler's skull, removes part of his brain, saut\u00e9s it, and feeds it to him. Starling tries to attack Lecter, but he overpowers her and traps her hair in a refrigerator door. He kisses her; while he is distracted, she handcuffs his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter raises a cleaver over her hand. Afterwards, Starling surrenders to the FBI with her hands intact.\n\nOn a flight, Lecter prepares to eat a meal he has brought himself while wearing his bandaged arm in a sling. Lecter shares Krendler's cooked brain with a curious boy who was watching him eat, saying it is important \"always to try new things\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Hannibal Lecter|Dr. Hannibal Lecter / Dr. Fell]]\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as FBI Agent [[Clarice Starling]]\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Mason Verger]]{{efn|Oldman was uncredited in the original theatrical version of the film.

Production designer Norris Spencer had worked on ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'', ''[[Black Rain (1989 American film)|Black Rain]]'' and ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]''.

Ridley Scott had never filmed there before, but described it as \"quite an experience ... It was kind of organized chaos ... We were there at the height of tourist season.\"<ref name=\"prodnotes\" /> Within Florence, the production would visit various [[filming location|locations]] such as the Palazzo Capponi (as Dr. Fell's workplace), the [[Ponte Vecchio]], the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], the Pharmacy of Santa Maria Novella and the [[Florence Cathedral|Cathedral]].<ref name=\"prodnotes\" />\n* After leaving Italy on 5 June 2000, the production moved to Washington, D.C.

[[Julianne Moore]] underwent [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] training at the Bureau's headquarters before filming.<ref name=\"prodnotes\" />\n* A barn in Orange, Virginia, situated on the estate of President [[James Madison]], was used to house 15 \"performing hogs\".<ref name=\"prodnotes\" /> The 15 Russian boars used in the shoot were from a selection of around 6,000 that the animal wranglers observed.<ref name=\"prodnotes\" />\n* [[Biltmore Estate]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], the biggest privately owned estate in the U.S., was chosen to signify the huge personal wealth of [[Mason Verger]].<ref name=\"makingdvd\" />\n\n===Special make-up effects===\n[[Make-up artist]] Greg Cannom was pleased to be involved in ''Hannibal'' as it offered him the chance to produce \"incredible and original make-ups\".<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> For Mason Verger, the make-up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring, and not something from the \"House of Wax\".<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors in an effort to get the look of the character as realistic as possible.<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> Scott showed the make-up team pictures of foetal things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn't lost his sense of humour ... almost sympathetic.<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> Oldman would spend six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role.<ref name=\"makingdvd\" />\n\nFor one of the film's final and infamous scenes, an exact duplicate was created of the character Paul Krendler, played by [[Ray Liotta]], a scene which blended make-up, [[puppet]] work and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] in a way which Scott called \"seamless\".<ref name=\"makingdvd\" />\n\n===Title sequence===\nThe main titles were designed by Nick Livesey, a graduate of the [[Royal College of Art]] who worked for one of Scott's production companies in London. The [[Title Sequence|sequence]], shot in [[Florence]] by Livesey himself was intended as the film's second promotional trailer.<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> The studio thought it not \"quite right\", but it remained on Scott's mind and would eventually end up as the main [[title sequence]].<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> Livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence early one morning which, in the final cut, would [[Morphing|morph]] into the face of Hannibal Lecter.<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> Scott believed it a good idea, as it fundamentally asked the question: 'Where is Hannibal Lecter?' Scott explains: \"And of course this story tells it, with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere, where you wonder where that is ... and there he is... his face appears.\"<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> The titles are said to have been influenced by the film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''.<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite news | first= Elvis| last= Mitchell | title=FILM REVIEW; Whetting That Large Appetite for Second Helpings | date= 9 February 2001| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/09/movies/film-review-whetting-that-large-appetite-for-second-helpings.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | access-date =1 March 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nRidley Scott worked very closely with composer [[Hans Zimmer]], during [[post-production]] on ''Hannibal''.<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> Scott believes the music to a film is as important as [[dialogue]]\u2014\"It is the final adjustment to the screenplay, being able to also adjust the performance of the actors in fact.\"<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with [[Film editing|editor]] [[Pietro Scalia]] to discuss scenes in the film and \"not music\".<ref name=\"makingdvd\" /> Zimmer used a [[symphony]] [[orchestra]] for the opera sequence, but would mostly use what he described as a \"very odd orchestra ... only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range.\" This was done to emphasise the character of Lecter.

Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well.\"<ref name=\"cnnscott\" /> During the opera scene in [[Florence]], Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[sonnet]]s, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, \"Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?\" Lecter replies: \"Yes, I believe he could ... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for ''him''?\" This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people \"missed\" the meaning of.

That's how the movie was saved.\"<ref name=\"Theriddlerhashisday\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine in its review said \"''Hannibal'' is not as good as ''Lambs'' ... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, ''Hannibal'' is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling.\"<ref name=\"hannibalvariety\">{{cite news | date=5 February 2001 | first=Todd | last=McCarthy | title=Hannibal Review | url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117797220 | work=Variety | access-date=1 April 2021 }}</ref>\n\nA negative review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' claimed that what was wrong with the film was carried over from the book: \"The result is an inflated, good-looking bore of a movie.

It never quite gets there, but it tries with every fiber of its craft to redeem its pulp origins, and we must give it credit for the courage of its depravity\", and although he was \"left with admiration for Scott's craft in pulling [it] off at all, and making it watchable\", and praised the Mason Verger character as \"a superb joining of skill and diabolical imagination,\" as well as Hopkins' performance as Lecter, which he described as \"fascinating every second he is on the screen\", he concluded, \"I cannot approve of the movie, not because of its violence, which belongs to the [[Grand Guignol]] tradition, but because the underlying story lacks the fascination of ''Silence of the Lambs''.\"<ref>{{cite news | date=9 February 2001 | title=Hannibal | author=Roger Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert | url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hannibal-2001 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | access-date=1 October 2021 }}</ref>\n\n==Differences from the novel==\nAccording to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, the script for ''Hannibal'' was: \"quite faithful to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters, most notably Mason Verger's muscle-bound macho sister Margot, as well as the considerable fascinating academic detail, but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes, even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact, with the only surprise twists saved for its wake).\"<ref name=\"hannibalvariety\" /> ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' noted: \"The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Hannibal review |publisher=Time Out Film Guide |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/dvd/63664.html |access-date=16 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228083806/http://www.timeout.com/film/dvd/63664.html |archive-date=28 December 2004}}</ref> Producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: \"I think if you get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Mattram |author2=Al Kehoe | title=Interview: Dino De Laurentiis | year=2001 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/02/12/dino_de_laurentis_hannibal_120201_interview.shtml | work=BBC | access-date=7 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, from which he calls children to verbally abuse as a substitute for his no longer being able to [[child molestation|molest]] them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her [[sexual orientation]] to her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to [[steroid]] abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a [[semen]] sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then [[inheritance|inherit]] the Verger fortune. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted [[cattle prod]], and then kills him by ramming his pet [[moray eel]] down his throat.\n\nThe book's controversial ending has Lecter presenting Starling with the exhumed bones of her father, which he \"brings to life\" by [[Hypnosis|hypnotizing]] Starling, allowing her to say goodbye. This forges an odd alliance between Starling and Lecter, culminating in their becoming lovers and escaping to [[Argentina]]. At the novel's end, Barney sees them at the [[Teatro Col\u00f3n]] of [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nAlso gone from the film are the flashbacks to Lecter's childhood, in which he sees his younger sister, Mischa, eaten by German deserters in 1944. These flashbacks formed the basis for the 2007 film ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]'' (written concurrently with the [[Hannibal Rising|2006 novel of the same name]]) which portrays Lecter as a young man.\n\nHopkins was asked in an interview on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). \"Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. I think it would have been a very interesting thing though. I think it would have been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of ''SotL'', she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter ...
