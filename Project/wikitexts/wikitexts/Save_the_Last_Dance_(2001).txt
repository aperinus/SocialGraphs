The film stars [[Julia Stiles]] and [[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as a teenage [[interracial marriage|interracial couple]] in [[Chicago]] who work together to help Stiles' character train for a [[Juilliard School]] [[dance]] audition.\n\nReleased theatrically in the United States on January 12, 2001, the film received mixed reviews from critics but was a box-office success and grossed $131.7 million worldwide against a $13 million budget.\n\nA [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[Save the Last Dance 2]]'', was released in 2006.\n\n== Plot ==\nSeventeen-year-old Sara Johnson, a promising [[ballet]] dancer in suburban [[Chicago]], hopes to be admitted to [[Juilliard School]] and implores her mother to attend the audition. She fails the audition and soon learns that her mother was killed in a car accident in her haste to get to it.\n\nSara is wracked with guilt and gives up ballet. She moves to the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] to live with her estranged father Roy, a jazz musician who plays the trumpet at nightclubs. Sara also transfers to a majority-black high school, where she is one of a handful of white students, but quickly befriends Chenille Reynolds, a teenage single mother who is having relationship problems with her ex-boyfriend Kenny. Chenille invites Sara to a dance club called Stepps, where she has her first experience dancing to [[hip hop]] rhythms. At Stepps, Sara dances with Derek, Chenille's brother and a student with dreams of attending [[Georgetown University]] to become a [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]]. Derek decides to help Sara develop her dancing skills by incorporating more hip hop into her style. He takes a reluctant Sara to the [[Joffrey Ballet]] and, afterwards, she confides in him about her mother and her dreams. Later, they return to the club and amaze others with their dancing. While performing, Derek's ex-girlfriend Nikki interrupts the two and begins dancing with Derek, making Sara retreat to the bar. Afterward, Derek returns to Sara and apologizes for pairing up with Nikki; they subsequently make up and return to Roy's apartment. Having achieved his dream of being accepted into Georgetown, Derek convinces Sara to follow her dreams of Juilliard; they eventually begin a romantic relationship.\n\nAt school, Nikki picks a fight with Sara. Later, Chenille tells Sara that she did not approve of the fight, but can understand the bitterness since Sara, a white girl, is stealing one of the decent black boys at school. Because of this conversation, Sara and Chenille's friendship becomes strained, and Sara decides to break up with Derek. Meanwhile, Derek deals with his friend Malakai, who is heavily involved in the gang lifestyle that Derek is trying to leave. Derek agrees to help Malakai execute a [[Drive-by shooting|drive-by]] at the same time as Sara's audition. Roy has a heart-to-heart talk with Sara and encourages her to go through with the audition.\n\nAfter learning what Chenille said to Sara, Derek confronts her about it, as well as explains his true reasons for dumping Nikki. Remorseful for her actions, Chenille admits that what she did was wrong and apologizes. She also tells Derek that Sara did not want to dump him, but Chenille's words hurt her to the point of feeling forced to. Chenille also admits that she has been resentful for how Kenny has been treating her, including not helping her raise their son and not being a good boyfriend to her. She unintentionally took it out on Sara since she has been jealous of her and Derek's relationship. Chenille encourages Derek to be with Sara, admitting that she knows that Sara is in love with him. She also warns Derek not to follow Malakai, knowing that he may lose his chance to attend Georgetown and his future if he is arrested. Derek decides to bail on Malakai to attend Sara's audition, arriving at a crucial point in her performance to offer her encouragement and moral support. Afterward, Sara is accepted into Juilliard and she rekindles her relationship with Derek. Meanwhile, the drive-by is botched and Malakai is arrested. The film closes as Sara, Derek, Chenille, and their friends meet at Stepps to celebrate Sara's successful audition.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Julia Stiles]] as Sara Johnson\n*[[Sean Patrick Thomas]] as Derek Reynolds\n*[[Kerry Washington]] as Chenille Reynolds\n*[[Fredro Starr]] as Malakai\n*[[Terry Kinney]] as Roy Johnson\n*[[Bianca Lawson]] as Nikki\n*Elizabeth Oas as Diggy\n*Vince Green as Snookie\n*Garland Whitt as Kenny\n\n== Production ==\nJulia Stiles landed the role as Sara when director Thomas Carter saw her dance scene in the 1999 film ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |date=2021-01-27 |title=Julia Stiles shares best part of making 'Save the Last Dance' 20 years later |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/julia-stiles-looks-back-save-last-dance-20th-anniversary-t206138 |access-date=2022-08-15 |website=TODAY.com |language=en}}</ref> To prepare for her role, Stiles did two months of training for the ballet scenes while also rehearsing the choreography for the hip hop scenes.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Fatima Robinson]] was the film's hip hop choreographer.\n\n== Music ==\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Save the Last Dance\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = Various artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| caption      = \n| released     = December 19, 2000\n| recorded     = 2000\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n| length       = \n| label        = [[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]]\n| producer     = [[Battlecat (producer)|DJ Battlecat]], [[Raphael Saadiq]], [[Eddie F]], [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]], [[Stevie J]], [[Darryl Anthony]], The Whole 9,Jave & Sweet, Delite\n| misc         = {{Singles\n | name        = Save the Last Dance\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Murder She Wrote (song)|Murder She Wrote]]\n | single1date = 1993\n | single2     = [[Only You (112 song)|Only You]]\n | single2date = June 27, 1996\n | single3     = [[Get It On Tonite]]\n | single3date = October 12, 1999\n | single4     = [[U Know What's Up]]\n | single4date = November 2, 1999\n | single5     = [[You Make Me Sick]]\n | single5date = December 18, 2000\n | single6     = [[Crazy (K-Ci and JoJo song)|Crazy]]\n | single6date = March 2, 2001\n | single7     = You\n | single7date = July 17, 2001\n | single8     = All Or Nothing\n | single8date = 2001\n}}\n}}\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released on December 19, 2000, through [[Hollywood Records]] and consisted of hip hop and R&B music.
