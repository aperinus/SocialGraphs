Written, produced by and starring Tenacious D members [[Jack Black]] and [[Kyle Gass]], it is directed and co-written by musician and puppeteer [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]]. Despite being about an actual band, the film is a fictitious story set in the 1990s about the band's origins, and their journey to find a [[Guitar pick|pick]] belonging to [[Satan]] that allows its users to become rock legends.\n\nThe film was released on November 22, 2006, and was a [[box office bomb]]. The soundtrack, ''[[The Pick of Destiny]]'', was also released in 2006 as the band's second studio album. Despite the poor box office reception of the film at release, it has since been considered a \"[[cult classic]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/the-treatment/jack-black-kyle-gass-tenacious-d-post-apocalypto |title=Jack Black & Kyle Gass: \"Tenacious D: Post-Apocalypto'' {{!}} The Treatment|date=2018-12-06 |website=KCRW |language=en |access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/a-sequel-to-tenacious-ds-the-pick-of-destiny-is-officially-happening/|title=A Sequel To Tenacious D's 'The Pick Of Destiny' Is Officially Happening|date=2018-05-08|website=Music Feeds|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotpress.com/music/tenacious-d-announce-dublin-show-22793892|title=Tenacious D announce Dublin show|last=Molloy|first=Joey|website=Hotpress|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words. As of August 9, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 578 words. -->\nAs a young man, JB runs away from his religious family and oppressive Midwestern town for Hollywood after being graced by the word of [[Ronnie James Dio|Dio]] on a quest to form the world's \"most awesome\" [[Rock music|rock]] band. There he meets [[acoustic guitar]]ist KG, nicknamed Kage, who is performing on the street, and begins worshipping him as a rock god because of his perceived skills and attitude. JB attempts to ask KG to teach him rock and roll lessons, only to be refused. Later in the night, a crestfallen JB mopes on a park bench, seconds before being beaten up. KG takes pity on JB and agrees to teach him. KG feeds JB's fantasy by pretending to be famous with a self-named band (\"The Kyle Gass Project\") and exploits him to do work such as cleaning his apartment and buying him [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]] (under the promise that JB can audition for his fictitious band). After JB learns KG is actually unemployed and living off his parents, the two become equal, and KG apologizes to JB by giving him a brand-new guitar. They create their own band: Tenacious D, named after matching birthmarks found on their buttocks.\n\nSoon JB and KG learn the deepest secret of rock: all the rock legends used the same guitar pick, \"the Pick of Destiny\", which has supernatural powers. It was created by a dark wizard who'd summoned Satan for his own purposes, but was promptly attacked. A nearby blacksmith heard the commotion and distracted the demon by tossing a horseshoe at it, chipping its tooth in the process. As Satan was now \"incomplete\", the wizard was able to banish Satan back to Hell. To repay the blacksmith, who desired the heart of a fair maiden, the wizard fashioned the tooth into a pick that would give its holder unnatural prowess with stringed instruments. Infatuated by the prospect of becoming the next great rock star, JB immediately sets Tenacious D on a quest to steal the Pick of Destiny from a rock history museum. Along the way, the band briefly splits up, when KG decides that sex comes first in \"sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll\" after getting invited to a party by young women, while JB wants to stick to the mission at hand. They are eventually reunited after KG is kicked out of the party.\n\nLater, the two manage to steal the Pick of Destiny from the rock museum. Armed with this supernatural pick, they plan to use the winnings from a local bar's talent contest to pay their rent, but before they can go on stage, they argue over who gets to use the pick first, snapping it in half accidentally. The bar's owner persuades them to go onto the contest without the pick. The owner is revealed to be Satan in human form, who places the Pick of Destiny back on his broken tooth. Complete again, he obtains supernatural powers on earth and threatens to make Tenacious D his first victims.\n\nTo save their lives, Tenacious D challenge Satan to a rock-off, which under the terms of the \"demon code\" he cannot decline. The terms, suggested by JB, are that if Tenacious D win, Satan must return to hell and pay their rent, but if they lose, Satan can take KG back with him as a sex slave. After the duel, Satan deems his rock better and attempts to shoot KG with a bolt of energy. JB jumps in the way, and the bolt bounces off The \"JB KG\" drawn logo on the base of the guitar, blowing off a piece of Satan's horn. As Satan is now incomplete once again, JB sends him back to Hell with the wizard's magical incantation.\n\nThe two turn Satan's horn into the \"[[Bong]] of Destiny\", which the two smoke from as they write new songs.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jack Black]] as \"Jables\" or \"J.B.\"\n** [[Troy Gentile]] as young J.B.\n* [[Kyle Gass]] as \"Kage\" or \"K.G.\"\n* [[Ronnie James Dio]] as himself\n* [[Dave Grohl]] as Satan\n* [[Meat Loaf]] as Bud Black\n* [[JR Reed (actor)|JR Reed]] as Lee\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Guitar Center Guy\n* [[Paul F.

The script was based around many songs that would later be released on [[Tenacious D (album)|the duo's eponymous debut album]] that would be released the following year. There is little known about the script, other than it being based around the band playing coffee shops, Black becoming fascinated by [[Atlantis]] and Black and Gass both falling in love with a girl called Simmeon who has written books about the fictional island. They later meet Ronnie James Dio, and are sent on a road trip to Miami.
