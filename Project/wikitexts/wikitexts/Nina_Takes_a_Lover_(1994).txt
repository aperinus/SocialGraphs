In flashbacks, she provides detailed accounts of an affair she had with a British photographer. Nina, who is starved for romance in her marriage, meets the photographer at a park when she sits next to him on a bench one day. While Nina's husband is away on a business trip for three weeks, Nina enters into an affair with the photographer, who is himself married. The journalist is also shown interviewing the photographer, who admits to his affair with Nina.\n\nAt the same time of Nina's liaison, her best friend is having an affair with Paulie, the manager of a coffee shop. Nina allows the couple to rendezvous in her apartment, but she is accused of having an affair with Paulie after he steals a pair of Nina's underwear and leaves it on the seat of his car. \n\nJust as Nina's affair with the photographer blossoms into something more intense, she learns the photographer has been sleeping with other women. As she tells her story to the journalist, she reveals the photographer is actually her husband, and the \"affair\" was simply an attempt to spice up the marriage. The film ends with Nina and her husband's marriage on solid ground after their ruse. \n\n==Cast==      \n*[[Laura San Giacomo]] as Nina<ref>{{cite web |title=Nina Takes a Lover |url=http://history.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=3483 |website=[[San Francisco Film Festival]] |access-date=19 September 2022 |date=1994}}</ref><ref name=stanfordmag>{{cite news |last1=Klein |first1=Don |date=22 February 2012 |title=Independent Streak |language=en |work=Stanford magazine |url=https://stanfordmag.org/contents/independent-streak |url-status=live |access-date=19 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110212036/https://stanfordmag.org/contents/independent-streak |archive-date=November 10, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Paul Rhys]] as Photographer\n*[[Michael O'Keefe]] as Journalist\n*[[Cristi Conaway]] as Friend\n*[[Fisher Stevens]] as Paulie\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name=\"sfgate-3150993\">{{cite news |last1=Armstrong |first1=David |date=3 March 1995 |title=Acting and writing impressive in 'Nina' |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Acting-and-writing-impressive-in-Nina-3150993.php |access-date=19 September 2022}}</ref><ref name=\"sfgov/yitu-d5am\">{{cite book |url=https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/yitu-d5am/rows.pdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD |title=Film Locations in San Francisco |publisher=[[City and County of San Francisco]]}}</ref> Locations included the Vallejo and Chavez Streets<ref>{{cite web |title=409 Vallejo St, San Francisco, CA 94133 |url=https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/409-Vallejo-St-San-Francisco-CA-94133/2087866131_zpid/ |website=Zillow |access-date=19 September 2022 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=3996-3998 Cesar Chavez St, San Francisco, CA 94131 |url=https://www.trulia.com/p/ca/san-francisco/3996-3998-cesar-chavez-st-san-francisco-ca-94131--2189504029 |access-date=19 September 2022 |website=[[Trulia]] |language=en}}</ref> and the Music Concourse at the [[Golden Gate Park]].<ref name=\"goldengatepark/concourse\">{{cite web |date=20 January 2010 |title=Music Concourse (and Spreckels Temple of Music) |url=https://goldengatepark.com/music-concourse-and-spreckels-temple-of-music.html |access-date=20 September 2022 |website=[[Golden Gate Park]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Alamy/476558094\">{{cite web |author1= |title=Laura San Giacomo & Paul Rhys Film: Nina Takes A Lover (1994) Characters: Nina, Photographer Director: Alan Jacobs 11 September 1994 |url=https://www.alamy.com/laura-san-giacomo-paul-rhys-film-nina-takes-a-lover-1994-characters-nina-photographer-director-alan-jacobs-11-september-1994-warning-this-photograph-is-for-editorial-use-only-and-is-the-copyright-of-alan-jacobs-productions-andor-the-photographer-assigned-by-the-film-or-production-company-and-can-only-be-reproduced-by-publications-in-conjunction-with-the-promotion-of-the-above-film-a-mandatory-credit-to-alan-jacobs-productions-is-required-the-photographer-should-also-be-credited-when-known-no-commercial-use-can-be-granted-without-written-authority-from-the-film-company-image476558094.html |access-date=19 September 2022 |website=[[Alamy]] |language=en}}</ref> Scenes were also filmed at the [[Pergola]] at [[Lake Merritt]] in Oakland.<ref name=\"google/books=t-bwBQAAQBAJ\">{{cite book |last1=Pollock |first1=Christopher |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-bwBQAAQBAJ&dq=%22Nina+Takes+a+Lover%22&pg=PA144 |title=Reel San Francisco Stories: An Annotated Filmography of the Bay Area |date=2013 |isbn=978-0-578-13042-2 |page=144 |language=en |access-date=19 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Oakland Lake Merritt Pergola |url=http://www.mullercaulfield.com/mca/web_pages/proj_pages/Pergola.html |access-date=19 September 2022 |website=Muller & Caulfield Architects}}</ref> \n\n==Reception==\n''Nina Takes a Lover'' received mixed reviews.
