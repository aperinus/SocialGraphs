[[Cheech Marin]] and [[Tommy Chong]] star as the two twin brothers in a parody of various film adaptations of the 1844 [[Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re|Alexandre Dumas]] novella, ''[[The Corsican Brothers]]''.\n\nTo date, it is the last live-action film starring the duo, and the only one that does not heavily revolve around the normal elements of [[stoner comedy]] (being that there are very few references to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]). Instead the film elects to be a straightforward farce of [[swashbuckler]] films.\n\n==Plot==\n\nLos Guys, a [[rockabilly]] band, has developed a racket playing loud music on the streets of [[France]] and accepting payment for them to stop playing.  While at a nearby restaurant counting the proceeds from their latest \"gig,\" two lead band members meet a [[Romani people|gypsy]] storyteller. She tells them the story of ''[[The Corsican Brothers]]''.\n\nThe story begins with the birth of two superfecund twin brothers, Louis and Lucien (played by adult Cheech and Chong as babies, children and adults), each by a different aristocratic French father; the two fathers end up dead in a botched [[dueling|duel]] over their partner's infidelity, with the twins raised as orphans. At age nine, their trait of feeling pain from the other's injuries becomes apparent (it becomes the film's predominant [[running gag]]); they accidentally burn down their house while playing with this power, and they decide to split up.\n\nAt age 30, they reunite: Louis (now Lu\u00eds) wound up in [[Mexico]] working low-end jobs (though he claims to be a wealthy businessman) and Lucien, who stayed in France, has grown resentful of the royals' harsh treatment of peasants in the country, particularly that of the queen's [[regent]], the sadistic ([[BDSM|in more ways than one]]) Fuckaire, who usurped the king after his disappearance. The cowardly Lu\u00eds is reluctant to help his brother's revolutionary plans, but both find themselves drawn to two of the queen's daughters (played by Cheech and Chong's real-life wives). The crux of Lucien's scheme is to disguise themselves respectively as a gay Spaniard hairdresser and [[Nostradamus]], who are prepared to visit the queen with the Marquis du Hickey. Despite a setback in which they are temporarily imprisoned because Lucien would rather fight outnumbered than flee from danger as Lu\u00eds wanted, Lucien manages to escape. At Lu\u00eds's execution, Lucien and the peasants storm the festivities, Lu\u00eds is freed and Fuckaire is deposed. As Lu\u00eds prepares for the dual wedding between the brothers and princesses, he suddenly [[cold feet|fears for their future]], and Lucien sweeps in to rescue him as they both leave the princesses at the altar, resolved to cross the globe and start a [[American Revolutionary War|revolution]] in America.\n\nAfter their saga concludes, Los Guys resume playing in an outdoor cafe, covering [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Nadine (song)|Nadine]],\" to an indifferent audience.\n\nMuch of the film's humor comes from [[anachronism]]s: ''The Corsican Brothers'' is set in the 1840s (in the film it is portrayed closer to 18th-century, pre-[[French Revolution|revolution France]]), but Nostradamus, who lived and died three centuries prior, makes an appearance, and Lu\u00eds is said to have spent time in a modern-day Mexico.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Cheech Marin]] as Luis Corsican\n*[[Tommy Chong]] as Lucian Corsican\n*[[Roy Dotrice]] as The Evil Fuckaire/Ye Old Jailer\n*[[Shelby Chong]] as Princess I\n*[[Rikki Marin]] (Cheech's real-life wife) as Princess II\n*[[Edie McClurg]] as The Queen\n*[[Robbi Chong]] as Princess III\n*[[Jean-Claude Dreyfus]] as Marquis Du Hickey\n*[[Rae Dawn Chong]] as The Gypsy\n*[[Kay Dotrice]] as The Midwife\n*[[Jennie C.
