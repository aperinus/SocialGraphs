The plot follows two [[drag queen]]s, played by [[Hugo Weaving]] and [[Guy Pearce]], and a transgender woman, played by [[Terence Stamp]], as they journey across the [[Outback|Australian Outback]] from [[Sydney]] to [[Alice Springs]] in a tour bus that they have named \"Priscilla\", along the way encountering various groups and individuals. The film's title references the slang term \"queen\" for a drag queen or female impersonator.\n\nThe film was a surprise worldwide hit and its positive portrayal of [[LGBT]] individuals helped to introduce LGBT themes to a mainstream audience.<ref name=oregan/> It received predominantly positive reviews and won an [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] at the [[67th Academy Awards]]. Among other designers the film's costume department included many pieces of costume jewelry by Ziggy Attias of Ziggy Originals, NYC.

After persuading his friends and fellow performers, Bernadette Bassenger (Terence Stamp), a recently bereaved transgender woman, and Adam Whitely (Guy Pearce), a flamboyant and obnoxious younger drag queen who goes under the drag name Felicia Jollygoodfellow, to join him, the three set out for a four-week run at the casino in a large tour bus, which Adam christens \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"\n\nWhile on the long journey through remote lands bordering the [[Simpson Desert]], they meet a variety of characters, including a group of friendly [[Aboriginal Australians]] for whom they perform, the less accepting attitudes of rural Australia in such towns as [[Coober Pedy]], and are subjected to [[Homophobia|homophobic abuse]] and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]], including having their bus vandalized with homophobic graffiti.\n\nWhen the bus breaks down in the middle of the desert, Adam spends the whole day repainting it lavender to cover up the vandalism. The trio later meet Bob, a middle-aged mechanic from a small outback town who joins them on their journey after his wife leaves him. Before they arrive at Alice Springs, Tick reveals that Marion is actually his wife, as they never divorced, and that they are actually going there as a favour to her. Continuing their journey, Adam is almost mutilated by a homophobic gang before he is saved by Bob and Bernadette. Adam is shaken and Bernadette comforts him, allowing them to reach an understanding. Likewise, the others come to terms with the secret of Tick's marriage and resolve their differences. Together, they fulfill a long-held dream of Adam's, which, in the original plan, is to climb [[Kings Canyon (Northern Territory)|Kings Canyon]] in full drag regalia.\n\nUpon arrival at the hotel, it is revealed that Tick and Marion also have an eight-year-old son, Benjamin, whom Tick has not seen for many years. Tick is nervous about exposing his son to his drag profession and anxious about revealing his homosexuality, though he is surprised to discover that Benjamin already knows and is fully supportive of his father's sexuality and career. When their contract at the resort is over, Tick and Adam head back to Sydney, taking Benjamin back with them, so that Tick can get to know his son. However, Bernadette decides to remain at the resort for a while with Bob, who has decided to work at the hotel after the two of them had become close.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Terence Stamp]] as Bernadette Bassenger\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as Anthony \"Tick\" Belrose/Mitzi Del Bra\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Adam Whitely/Felicia Jollygoodfellow\n* [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] as Robert \"Bob\" Spart\n* [[Sarah Chadwick (actress)|Sarah Chadwick]] as Marion Barber\n* Mark Holmes as Benjamin Barber\n* Julia Cortez as Cynthia Campos\n* Ken Radley as Frank\n* Daniel Kellie as Young Bernadette\n* Leighton Picken as Young Adam\n* [[Margaret Pomeranz]] (''uncredited'') as Adam's mother\n* [[Stephan Elliott]] (''uncredited'') as Doorman\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'' had originally been conceived by filmmakers [[Stephan Elliott]] and Stuart Quin, who were at the time in production of a film called ''[[Frauds (film)|Frauds]]''. They and producer Andrena Finlay initially tried to pitch ''Priscilla'' to various financiers at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]], but were unsuccessful,<ref>[[#Cla94|Clark 1994]]. pp. 05\u201306.</ref> and so instead took the film's concept to PolyGram and, with the backing of the Australian [[Film Finance Corporation]], were able to begin production of the film on a relatively low budget of 2.7 million Australian dollars.\n\nElliott and the film's producers, Michael Hamlyn and Al Clark, agreed to work for $50,000 each, a relatively low fee for filmmakers at the time, while the lack of funding meant that the crew agreed to receive takings of the film's eventual profits in compensation for their low salaries.<ref>[[#Cla94|Clark 1994]]. pp. 06\u201307 and 10.</ref> Due to the involvement of the Australian FFC, only one non-Australian actor was allowed to appear in the film, and Clark initially considered [[David Bowie]], whom he had known back in the 1980s, and later briefly thought of [[John Hurt]], although neither was available.<ref>[[#Cla94|Clark 1994]]. pp. 14\u201316.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nIn May 1993, after travelling around the [[Outback|Australian Outback]] searching for appropriate sites to film in, ''Priscilla''{{'}}s creators attended the Cannes Film Festival and Marche to advertise their project, hoping to capitalise on the selection of Elliot's first film ''Frauds'', which was \"In Competition\" at the festival and despite the fact that they had not yet confirmed any actors for the roles. Their primary choice for the role of Bernadette was [[Tony Curtis]], who read and approved of the script, but eventually became unavailable. They then approached [[John Cleese]], who was not interested.\n\nFor the part of Tick, they had initially wanted [[Rupert Everett]] and for Adam they wanted [[Jason Donovan]].<ref>[[#Cla94|Clark 1994]]. pp. 38\u201341.</ref> However, at a pre-production casting meeting held at Cannes, Everett and Donovan did not get on well with one another and were found to be openly hostile toward the production staff. In light of this, it was readily agreed that they would not be suitable for the parts<ref>[[#Cla94|Clark 1994]] pp. 52\u201355.</ref> and the search for their three leading men would resume. However, Donovan would go on to play Tick in the West End [[Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (musical)|musical adaptation of the film]].\n\nAfter unsuccessfully lobbying [[Colin Firth]] to play the role, producers eventually awarded the part to [[Hugo Weaving]]. Initially considering [[Tim Curry]] for the part of Bernadette, they cast [[Terence Stamp]], who was initially anxious about the role because it was unlike anything that he had performed previously, although he eventually came on board with the concept.<ref>[[#Cla94|Clark 1994]]. pp. 58\u201364.</ref> Stamp himself suggested [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]] for the role of Bob, who accepted the role without even reading the script or being told anything about the greater concept of the film other than the basic character description, while Australian actor [[Guy Pearce]] (who had previously appeared with Donovan in the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours (TV series)|Neighbours]]'' in the late 1980s) was hired at the eleventh hour to portray the sassy but spirited Adam.<ref>[[#Cla94|Clark 1994]]. pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=It is striking what an effect the disguise of drag is having on [the actors'] personalities.

The worst stereotype of the Filipina.\" She argued that, by portraying Cynthia in this manner, the filmmakers were \"violently kill[ing]\" the dignity of Filipina women, something that she feared would lead to \"more violence against us.\"<ref name=\"Cafarella, 1994\">Cafarella, ''The Age'', 7 October 1994.</ref> An editor writing in ''The Age'' echoed these concerns, highlighting that \"It is perhaps a pity that a film with a message of tolerance and acceptance for homosexuals should feel the need of what looks very much to us like a racist and sexist stereotype.\"<ref name=\"Cafarella, 1994\"/> Similarly, in his study of bisexuality in cinema, Wayne M. Bryant argued that while it was \"an excellent film\", ''The Adventures of Priscilla'' was marred by \"instances of gratuitous sexism.\"<ref>[[#Bry97|Bryant 1997]]. p. 108.</ref>\n\nProducer Clark defended the film against these accusations, arguing that while Cynthia was a stereotype, it was not the purpose of filmmakers to avoid the portrayal of \"vulnerable characters\" from specific minority backgrounds. He stated that she was \"a misfit like the three protagonists are, and just about everybody else in the film is, and her presence is no more a statement about Filipino women than having three drag queens is a statement about Australian men.\"<ref name=\"Cafarella, 1994\"/> [[Thomas O'Regan|Tom O'Regan]] noted that as a result of this controversy, the film gained \"an ambiguous reputation.\"<ref>[[#O'R96|O'Regan 1996]]. p. 142.</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (soundtrack)}}\nThe film featured a soundtrack made up of pre-existing \"[[Camp (style)|camp]] classics\" ([[pop music]] songs that have a particular fanbase in the [[LGBT]] community). The original plan by the film's creators was to have a [[Kylie Minogue]] song in the finale, although it was later decided that an [[ABBA]] song would be more appropriate because its \"tacky qualities\" were \"more timeless\"<ref>[[#Cla94|Clark 1994]]. p. 34.</ref> (although in the musical adaptation, the character Adam performs a medley of Kylie Minogue songs atop Uluru). The film itself featured four main songs, which were performed by two or more of the drag queens as a part of their show within the film; \"[[I've Never Been to Me]]\" by [[Charlene (singer)|Charlene]], \"[[I Will Survive]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]], \"[[Finally (CeCe Peniston song)|Finally]]\" by [[CeCe Peniston]], and \"[[Mamma Mia (ABBA song)|Mamma Mia]]\" by ABBA. On 23 August 1994, [[Fontana Records|Fontana Island]] released the soundtrack on CD.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Adventures-Of-Priscilla-Queen-Of-The-Desert-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/master/97970 The Adventures Of Priscilla: Queen Of The Desert - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044130/https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Adventures-Of-Priscilla-Queen-Of-The-Desert-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/master/97970 |date=1 December 2017 }}.
