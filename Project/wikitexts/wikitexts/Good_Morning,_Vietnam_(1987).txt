Set in [[Saigon]] in 1965, during the [[Vietnam War]], the film stars [[Robin Williams]] as a radio DJ on [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio Service]], who proves hugely popular with the troops, but infuriates his superiors with what they call his \"irreverent tendency\". The story is loosely based on the experiences of AFRS radio DJ [[Adrian Cronauer]].<ref name=\"Urgent\">{{cite web | last= Barthold | first= Jim | title= The Real Life of Adrian Cronauer | url= http://urgentcomm.com/mag/radio_real_life_adrian/ | work= Urgent Communications | date= March 1, 2005 | access-date= December 5, 2016 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120509103859/http://urgentcomm.com/mag/radio_real_life_adrian/ | archive-date= May 9, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMost of Williams' performances that portrayed Cronauer's radio broadcasts were [[Improvisational theatre|improvisations]]. The film was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]] (under its [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner) to critical and commercial success; for his work in the film, Williams won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]]. The film is number 100 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s \"[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]\" list, containing 100 movies considered the funniest in American cinema.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1965, [[Airman Second Class]] Adrian Cronauer arrives in [[Saigon]] to work as a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] for [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio Service]]. [[Private (rank)|Private]] Edward Garlick takes him to the radio station, where his attitude and demeanor contrast sharply with those of many staff members. Cronauer's show starts with his signature \"Good morning, Vietnam!\", and consists of reading strictly censored news and irreverent humor segments mixed with rock and roll music, which is frowned upon by his superiors, Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson. Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor and the other DJs quickly grow to like Cronauer and his eccentric brand of comedy.\n\nCronauer follows Trinh, a Vietnamese girl, to an English class; after bribing the teacher to let him take over, Cronauer instructs the students in American slang and profanity. Once class is dismissed, he tries to talk to Trinh but is stopped by her brother Tuan; realizing the futility of pursuing her, Cronauer instead befriends Tuan and takes him to Jimmy Wah's, a local GI bar. Two racist soldiers, angered at Tuan's presence, initiate a confrontation that escalates into a brawl. Dickerson reprimands Cronauer for the incident, though his broadcasts continue as normal, gaining popularity from many listeners in spite of Dickerson and Hauk's dislike.\n\nWhile relaxing in Jimmy Wah's one afternoon, Cronauer is pulled outside by Tuan, saying that Trinh wants to see him. Moments later, the building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving Cronauer shaken. The cause of the explosion is determined to be a bomb; Dickerson declares the news censored, but Cronauer locks himself in the studio and reports it anyway, to Dickerson's outrage. Dickerson cuts off the broadcast and Cronauer is suspended, to the delight of Hauk and Dickerson. Hauk takes over the show, but his poor attempts at humor and polka music choices lead to a flood of letters and phone calls demanding that Cronauer be reinstated.\n\nDemoralized, Cronauer spends his time drinking and pursuing Trinh, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. At the radio station, Taylor intervenes, ordering Hauk to reinstate Cronauer, but he refuses to go back to work. Garlick and Cronauer's vehicle is stopped in a congested street amidst a convoy of soldiers from the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] heading for [[Nha Trang]], where Garlick persuades him to do an impromptu \"broadcast\" before they go off to fight. The soldiers' appreciation reminds Cronauer why his job is important, and he returns to work.\n\nDickerson seizes an opportunity to permanently rid himself of Cronauer by approving his request to interview soldiers in the field and routing him through the [[Viet Cong]]-controlled highway to [[An L\u1ed9c, B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc|An L\u1ed9c]]. Cronauer and Garlick's Jeep hits a mine, and they are forced to hide from VC patrols. In Saigon, Tuan learns of the trip after Cronauer fails to show up for English class and steals a van to go after them. After finding them, the van breaks down and they flag down a Marine helicopter to take them back to the city.\n\nBack at the base, Dickerson tells Cronauer that he is off the air for good after Tuan is revealed as a VC operative known as \"Phan Duc To\" and the one responsible for the bombing of Jimmy Wah's; Dickerson has arranged for Cronauer's honorable discharge. General Taylor informs Cronauer that, regrettably, he cannot help him since his friendship with Tuan would damage the reputation of the US Army. After Cronauer leaves, Taylor informs Dickerson that he is being transferred to [[Guam]], citing his vindictive attitude as the reason.\n\nCronauer chases down Tuan, decrying his actions against American soldiers. Emerging from the shadows, Tuan retorts that the US army devastated his family, thereby making the United States his enemy, but comments that he still chose to save Cronauer's life at An L\u1ed9c, implying that he valued their friendship, before disappearing again. On his way to the [[Tan Son Nhat Airport]] with Garlick, under MP escort, Cronauer sets up a quick softball game for the students from his English class and says goodbye to Trinh. He gives Garlick a taped farewell message and boards the plane; Garlick \u2013 taking Cronauer's place as DJ \u2013 plays the tape on the air the next morning, it begins with Cronauer saying \"Goodbye, Vietnam!\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- WARNING: Names are in order and as credited; please do not change them. -->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robin Williams]] as [[Adrian Cronauer]]\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Private Edward Garlick\n* Tung Thanh Tran as Phan Duc To / Tuan\n* [[Chintara Sukapatana]] as Trinh\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Lieutenant Steven Hauk\n* [[Robert Wuhl]] as Marty Lee Dreiwitz\n* [[J.
