McElroy]]. The film stars [[Desmond Harrington]], [[Eliza Dushku]], [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]], [[Jeremy Sisto]], [[Kevin Zegers]], and [[Lindy Booth]]. The film follows a group of six individuals being stalked by a cannibalist family in the woods.\n\nDevelopment for the film began in 2001 when it was announced [[Summit Entertainment]] and [[Newmarket Group]] teamed to produce ''Wrong Turn'', a 1970s-style horror pic to be directed by Schmidt, while McElroy wrote the script. The film was a co-production between Summit and [[Constantin Film]], with Stan Wilson designing the creature effects and serving as a producer.\n\n''Wrong Turn'' was theatrically released in the United States on May 30, 2003, by 20th Century Fox. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its premise, but criticized its script, underdeveloped characters and horror clich\u00e9s. It grossed over $28 million worldwide against a $12 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nCollege students Rich Stoker and Halley Smith are [[rock climbing]] in a remote forest of [[West Virginia]]. When Rich reaches the top of a cliff they are climbing, he is suddenly murdered before he can help Halley up. Someone begins to yank Halley up the cliff, forcing her to cut the rope and fall to the ground. She attempts to escape but is caught in a line of barbed wire and pulled back into the woods, screaming. She is killed [[Offscreen|off-screen]].\n\nSometime later, medical student Chris Flynn drives through the mountains of West Virginia on his way to a business meeting. He stops at a gas station to ask directions, and an elderly man named Maynard tells Chris to go down Bear Mountain Road. He collides with a stopped car whose tires have been punctured. The car belongs to a group of college students on a camping trip: Jessie, Carly, Scott, Evan and Francine. They soon discover their tire puncture was no accident and find barbed wire wrapped around it and realize someone did this intentionally.\n\nEvan and Francine stay to watch the cars while the others go to find help. Evan disappears after he hears something from the woods, and Francine finds his ear on the ground. As she backs away in horror, barbed wire is forced into her mouth by a mysterious figure, who garrotes her with it. The remaining group find an isolated cabin and go inside to use the phone, horrified to find human body parts in the house. They are forced to hide inside when the occupants return home. Three [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] inbred mountain men Three Finger, Saw Tooth and One Eye enter the cabin with Francine's corpse and the hiding group watch as her body is dismembered and eaten.\n\nAfter the cannibals fall asleep, the group attempts to escape but their captors awaken and chase them in the forest. The group find cars left from previous victims and try to make up an escape plan. Chris gets shot in the leg while trying to distract the cannibals, and the girls take him to a truck, where Evan's body spills out. Scott attempts another diversion for the other three to escape but gets killed with arrows instead. Jessie, Carly, and Chris stumble upon an old watchtower with an old radio and try to call for help. The cannibals arrive and are alerted when the radio starts responding to the group's call. Unable to get inside, the attackers set the tower on fire. The protagonists escape by jumping out and into the trees, triggering a chase in which Carly is decapitated by Three Finger.\n\nChris pulls a branch while Jessie lures the attacker for the former to release it, knocking him down. Jessie and Chris flee and hide in a cave until morning. The cannibals find them, pushing Chris down the hill, then kidnapping Jessie and taking her back to their cabin. Chris survives the fall and meets a police officer, but the officer is killed by Saw Tooth, who shoots him in the eye with an arrow. Chris hitches a ride by holding onto the underside of the truck as Saw Tooth drives it back to the cabin, where Jessie has been tied down to a bed in preparation to be eaten and watches fearfully as the cannibals chop up the dead policeman.\n\nBefore they can move on to Jessie, Chris sets the building on fire and drives the truck through the wall. He fights off the cannibals and frees Jessie and they escape as Chris kills the cannibals by blowing up the cabin. The pair then drive out of the forest in the cannibals' pickup truck and stumble upon Meynard's gas station nearby; Chris takes the map before he and Jessie leave.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, a deputy sheriff who had received the radio call earlier investigates the remains of the destroyed cabin. Laughing insanely, Three Finger, who survived the explosion, rises and kills the deputy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Desmond Harrington]] as Chris Flynn\n*[[Eliza Dushku]] as Jessie Burlingame\n*[[Emmanuelle Chriqui]] as Carly Numan\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Scott Korbee\n*[[Kevin Zegers]] as Evan Ross\n*[[Lindy Booth]] as Francine Childes\n*[[Julian Richings]] as Three Finger\n*[[Garry Robbins]] as Saw Tooth\n*Ted Clark as One Eye\n*Yvonne Gaudry as Halley Smith\n*Joel Harris as Richard (Rich) Stoker\n*David Huband as Trooper\n*[[Wayne Robson]] as Old Man\n*James Downing as Trucker\n\n==Production==\nDevelopment for the film began in 2001 when it was announced Summit Entertainment and Newmarket Group teamed to produce ''Wrong Turn'', a 1970s-style horror pic to be directed by Rob Schmidt.
