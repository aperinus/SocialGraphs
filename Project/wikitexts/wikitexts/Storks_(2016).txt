Pictures]]. It was directed by [[Nicholas Stoller]] and [[Doug Sweetland]] (the latter in his [[list of directorial debuts|feature debut]]), written by Stoller and stars the voices of [[Andy Samberg]], [[Katie Crown]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Ty Burrell]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Stephen Kramer Glickman]] and [[Danny Trejo]].\n\nThe film follows a hotshot package delivering [[stork]] (Junior) and his female human partner (Tulip), working at the distribution center of an enormous online store, Cornerstore.com, situated high in the mountains. After a boy sends a letter to the company, the two accidentally create a female baby using the defunct baby factory the storks had formerly used in their original business of making and delivering babies. In order to protect the baby from the company's manager and ensure Junior's promotion to succeed him, the two set off on a journey to deliver the baby to the boy's family.\n\nAfter the Warner Animation Group was founded in January 2013, the project was announced, with Sweetland attached to direct the film, while Stoller was hired by the studio to create and write the film. It was announced in April 2015 that Stoller and Sweetland would co-direct the film, while Stoller would produce the film alongside [[Brad Lewis]], with the main cast were added. [[Mychael Danna|Mychael]] and [[Jeff Danna]] composed the film's musical score. The animation was provided by [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]].\n\n''Storks'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on September 17, 2016, and was released six days later in 3D, [[IMAX]] and conventional formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/movies/storks|title=Storks|publisher=[[IMAX]]|access-date=19 October 2016}}</ref> The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation, humor and voice acting, but criticized the screenplay. It earned $183 million worldwide against a $70 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\nFor generations, the storks of Stork Mountain [[Delivery stork|delivered babies]] to families around the world, until one stork named Jasper attempted to keep an infant girl for himself. Jasper accidentally destroyed the infant's address beacon and went into exile. Unable to deliver the orphaned girl, the storks adopted her under the name Tulip. CEO stork Hunter discontinued baby delivery in favor of package delivery with Cornerstore.com.\n\nEighteen years later, Tulip, now a young adult, tries to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, which backfire and cause the company to lose stocks. Hunter declares her to be a severe burden and liability due to this incompetence (the charts also justify this, as every time she tries to help, their profits go down, and when they ''do'' make progress, it is when she's absent). Hunter explains to Junior, his top employee, that he's being promoted to chairman, and so he chooses him to take his place as boss, exciting Junior. He assigns him to fire Tulip so he may be promoted to boss. Junior cannot bring himself to do so and instead transfers Tulip to the mailroom.\n\nMeanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner, who lives with his workaholic parents Henry and Sarah, is feeling lonely and wants a younger sibling. He sends a letter to Cornerstore and it reaches Tulip, who enters the defunct baby factory and inserts the letter into the baby-making machine, causing it to create a pink-haired infant girl. Junior injures his wing trying to shut down the machine. Afraid Hunter will fire him, Junior agrees to accompany Tulip and secretly deliver the baby to her family using a makeshift flying craft that Tulip invented. They eventually crash, escape a pack of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] that fall in love with the baby, and reach civilization, during which Junior and Tulip bond with the baby and name her Diamond Destiny. In the meantime, Henry and Sarah open up to Nate's desire for a younger sibling and spend time with their son by building a landing platform for the storks.\n\nJunior and Tulip encounter Jasper, who had followed them from Stork Mountain. Jasper has nearly repaired Tulip's delivery beacon, but is missing one piece, which had been in Tulip's possession for years. Junior confesses to Tulip that he was supposed to fire her but couldn't bring himself to do it, and a saddened Tulip leaves with Jasper to meet her family while Junior continues alone to deliver Diamond Destiny. Cornerstore's pigeon employee Toady learns about Diamond Destiny and informs Hunter, who reroutes her address beacon and leads Junior into a trap. Hunter fires Junior and has Diamond Destiny taken away to live with penguins until she is an adult in order to silence the incident and prevent more plummeting stocks while Junior is tied up and gagged until his waiting attempt to death.\n\nTulip reunites with Junior from being coughed to demise and they return to Stork Mountain during the highly anticipated Storkcon event to save Diamond Destiny from the penguins. When they are cornered in the baby factory by Hunter and the other stork employees, Junior sends millions of archived letters from families into the baby-making machine, causing it to rapidly produce babies and distract the storks. Hunter seizes control of a giant crane and tries to destroy the factory, only to have Diamond destiny make the Cornerstore building collapse off Stork Mountain, causing Hunter, who is trapped inside the crane and unsuccessfully attempts to kill Junior and Tulip, to fall to his death.\n\nIn the aftermath of Cornerstore.com's destruction, Junior rallies the storks to deliver all the babies to their families. Junior, Tulip, and Jasper deliver Diamond Destiny to the Gardners, and Junior has a vision of her future, taking her first steps, learning to ride a bike, being in a ballet, training her ninja skills, graduating and getting married. Nate is at first not happy about not getting a little brother but quickly cheers up upon seeing his new sister's ninja skills. Tulip finally meets her family, and Junior and Tulip continue working as co-bosses at Stork Mountain.\n\n==Voice cast==\n\n<!--If you add voice actors, you must provide official sources or it will be removed.-->\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 3\n| total_width = 300\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Andy Samberg.png\n| width1 = 1534\n| caption1 = \n| height1 = 1917\n| image2 = Katie Crown (6775535406).jpg\n| width2 = 1953\n| caption2 = \n| height2 = 2394\n| image3 = Kelsey Grammer 2016.jpg\n| width3 = 297\n| height3 = 313\n| image4 = Keegan-Michael Key Peabody 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| width4 = 607\n| height4 = 770\n| image5 = Jordan Peele Peabody 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| width5 = 2358\n| height5 = 3096\n| image6 = Danny Trejo by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width6 = 320\n| height6 = 472\n| footer = [[Andy Samberg]], [[Katie Crown]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], and [[Danny Trejo]], are the respective voices of Junior, Tulip, Hunter, Alpha, Beta, and Jasper in the film.\n}}\n*[[Andy Samberg]] as Junior, a [[white stork]] working at Cornerstore as the company's top delivery stork, in hope of being promoted to becoming boss.<ref name=\"April2015TW\" /><ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" />\n*[[Katie Crown]] as Tulip, an 18-year-old orphan human worker at Cornerstore, who wishes to find her biological family.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\">{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Meet the cast and characters of 'Storks'|url=https://www.ew.com/gallery/storks-cast-characters|access-date=August 15, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 15, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Kelsey Grammer]] as Hunter, a cruel white stork who is the executive [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Cornerstore and has a hatred of baby delivery.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" /><ref name=\"Dec2015CS\" /><ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Jennifer Aniston completes cast of animated movie Storks \u2014 exclusive|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/15/jennifer-aniston-storks-nicholas-stoller|access-date=August 5, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 15, 2016}}</ref> Years ago, he closed the baby production and converted the company to a postal service.\n*[[Jennifer Aniston]] as Sarah Gardner, Nate's workaholic and overprotective mother who initially opposes the idea of having another child, but changes her mind after Henry convinces her.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" /><ref name=\"ew.com\"/>\n*[[Ty Burrell]] as Henry Gardner, Nate's workaholic father who rediscovers the joy of spending time with his son and warms to the idea of having a second child.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" />\n*Anton Starkman as Nathan \"Nate\" Gardner, a 10-year-old boy with [[workaholic]] parents, causing him to feel lonely.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" />\n*[[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Alpha, a greedy but caring [[wolf]] and the pack leader who wants to devour Junior and Tulip and adopt the baby.\n*[[Jordan Peele]] as Beta, a wolf and Alpha's deputy.
