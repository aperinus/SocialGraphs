It tells the story of small-time pool [[Hustling|hustler]] \"Fast Eddie\" Felson and his desire to break into the \"major league\" of professional hustling and high-stakes wagering that follows it. He throws his raw talent and ambition up against the best player in the country, seeking to best the legendary pool player \"[[Minnesota Fats]]\".\n\nThe film was shot on location in New York City and stars [[Paul Newman]] as Eddie; [[Jackie Gleason]] as Minnesota Fats; [[Piper Laurie]] as Sarah; and [[George C. Scott]] as Bert. It was followed by ''[[The Color of Money]]'' in 1986, with Newman reprising his role.\n\n''The Hustler'' was a major critical and popular success, gaining a reputation as a modern classic. Its exploration of winning, losing, and character garnered a number of major awards; it is also credited with helping to spark a resurgence in the popularity of pool.<ref name=Dyer119 /> In 1997, the [[Library of Congress]] selected ''The Hustler'' for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite news|date=December 1997|title=New to the National Film Registry|work=The Library of Congress Information Bulletin|publisher=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9712/nfr.html|access-date=2008-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=2020-11-02|website=Library of Congress}}</ref> The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''The Hustler'' in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=The+Hustler&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSmall-time pool hustler Fast Eddie Felson travels cross-country with his partner Charlie to challenge the legendary player Minnesota Fats. Arriving at Fats' home pool hall, Eddie declares he will win $10,000 that night. Fats arrives and he and Eddie agree to play [[straight pool]] for $200 a game. After initially falling behind, Eddie surges back to being $1,000 ahead and suggests raising the bet to $1,000 a game; Fats agrees. He sends out a runner, Preacher, to Johnny's Bar, ostensibly for whiskey, but really to get professional gambler Bert Gordon to the hall. Eddie gets ahead $11,000 and Charlie tries to convince him to quit, but Eddie insists the game will end only when Fats says it is over. Fats agrees to continue after Bert labels Eddie a \"loser\". After 25&nbsp;hours and an entire bottle of bourbon, Eddie is ahead over $18,000, but loses it all along with all but $200 of his original stake. At their hotel later, Eddie leaves half of the remaining stake with a sleeping Charlie and leaves.\n\nEddie stashes his belongings in locker at a bus terminal, where he meets Sarah Packard, an alcoholic woman who attends college part-time, and walks with a limp. He meets her again at a bar. They go back to her place but she hesitates at letting him in, saying he is \"too hungry\". She asks \"Why me?\", and he gives up, leaving her with the bottle he'd brought. Eddie moves into a rooming house and starts hustling for small stakes. He finds Sarah at the bus terminal again and this time she takes him in, but with reservations. Charlie finds Eddie at Sarah's and tries to persuade him to go back out on the road. Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge Fats again. Eddie learns that Charlie held out his (Charlie's) percentage and becomes enraged, believing that with that money he could have rebounded to beat Fats. Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to \"lay down and die by yourself\".\n\nAt Johnny's Bar, Eddie joins a poker game where Bert is playing and loses $20. Afterward, Bert tells Eddie that he has talent as a pool player but no character. He figures that Eddie will need at least $3,000 to challenge Fats again. Bert calls him a \"born loser\" but nevertheless offers to stake him in return for 75% of his winnings; Eddie refuses.\n\nEddie humiliates a local pool {{cuegloss|shark}}, exposing himself as a hustler, and the other players punish him by breaking his thumbs. As he heals, Sarah cares for him and tells him she loves him, but he cannot say the words in return. When Eddie is ready to play, he agrees to Bert's terms, deciding that a \"25% slice of something big is better than a 100% slice of nothing\".\n\nBert, Eddie, and Sarah travel to the [[Kentucky Derby]], where Bert arranges a match for Eddie against a wealthy local socialite named Findley. The game turns out to be [[three-cushion billiards]], not pool. When Eddie loses badly, Bert refuses to keep staking him. Sarah pleads with Eddie to leave with her, saying that the world he is living in and its inhabitants are \"perverted, twisted, and crippled\"; he refuses. Seeing Eddie's anger, Bert agrees to let the match continue at $1,000 a game. Eddie comes back to win $12,000. He collects his $3,000 share and decides to walk back to the hotel, where he discovers that Sarah has overdosed on heroin and then slit her wrists with a razor on the sink.\n\nEddie returns to challenge Fats again, putting up his entire $3,000 stake on a single game. He wins game after game, beating Fats so badly that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands half of Eddie's winnings and threatens to have him beaten unless he pays. Eddie says he'll come back to kill Bert if he survives, shaming Bert into giving up his claim by invoking Sarah's memory. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big-time pool hall again. Eddie and Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Eddie Felson\n* [[Jackie Gleason]] as [[Minnesota Fats]]\n* [[Piper Laurie]] as Sarah Packard\n* [[George C.

Director Rossen's daughter Carol Rossen speculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction. Rossen, who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool-themed play called ''Corner Pocket'', optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script.<ref>Rossen, Carol. DVD commentary, ''The Hustler'' Special Edition</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Bobby Darin]]'s agent, Martin Baum, Paul Newman's agent turned down the part of Fast Eddie.<ref name=\"Starr77\">Starr p. 77</ref> Newman was originally unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless, being committed to star opposite [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in the film ''[[Two for the Seesaw]]''.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> Rossen offered Darin the part after seeing him on ''[[The Mike Wallace Interview]]''.<ref name=\"Starr76\">Starr p. 76</ref> When Taylor was forced to drop out of ''Seesaw'' because of shooting overruns on ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', Newman was freed up to take the role, which he accepted after reading just half of the script.<ref name=\"Newman\">Newman, Paul. DVD commentary, ''The Hustler'' Special Edition</ref> No one associated with the production officially notified Darin or his representatives that he had been replaced; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race.<ref>Starr pp. 76\u20137</ref>\n\nRossen filmed ''The Hustler'' over six weeks, entirely in New York City. Much of the action was filmed at two now-defunct pool halls, McGirr's and Ames Billiard Academy.<ref name=\"dyer1\">Dyer pp. 117\u2013119</ref> Other shooting locations included a townhouse on East 82nd Street, which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton's character Findley, and the Manhattan [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal. The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = 'The Hustler,' at Martini, Filmed On Location In N.Y.\n  | work = The Galveston News\n  | date = 1961-10-05 }}</ref> [[Willie Mosconi]] served as technical advisor on the film<ref name=\"dyer1\" /> and shot a number of the [[trick shot]]s in place of the actors. All of Gleason's shots were his own; they were filmed in wide-angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames.<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news\n  | last = Ebert\n  | first = Roger\n  | title = The Hustler (1961)\n  | work = Chicago Sun-Times\n  | date = 2002-06-23\n  | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020623/REVIEWS08/206230301/1023\n  | access-date = 2008-03-31}}</ref> Rossen, in pursuit of the style he termed \"neo-neo-realistic\",<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Kilgallen\n  | first = Dorothy\n  | title = Voice of Broadway\n  | work = New Castle (PA) News\n  | date = 1961-05-29 }}</ref> hired actual street thugs, enrolled them in the [[Screen Actors Guild]] and used them as extras.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = Dream Street\n  | work = Uniontown (PA) Morning Herald\n  | date = 1961-09-08 }}</ref> Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way to town (originally slated to be the first scene of the film) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny's Bar which establishes Preacher is a [[Substance dependence|junkie]].<ref>Rossen p. 189-92</ref>\n\nEarly shooting put more focus on the pool playing, but during filming Rossen made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Kilgallen\n  | first =Dorothy\n  | title = Edith Piaf Worries Friends\n  | work = Lowell Sun\n  | date = 1961-04-21 }}</ref> Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a [[two shot]] but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two-shot while in a three-shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two-shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.<ref>Casty p. 43</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n''The Hustler'' is, fundamentally, a story of what it means to be a human being, couched within the context of winning and losing.<ref name=\"ebert\" /><ref name=\"casty\" /> Describing the film, Robert Rossen said: \"My protagonist, Fast Eddie, wants to become a great pool player, but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being. He attains self-awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused&nbsp;\u2014 and then he wins his pool game.\"<ref name=\"casty\">Casty p. 41</ref> Roger Ebert concurs with this assessment, citing ''The Hustler'' as \"one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering, by accepting reality instead of his dreams.\"<ref name=\"ebert\" />\n\nThe film was also somewhat autobiographical for Rossen, relating to his dealings with the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). A screenwriter during the 1930s and '40s, he had been involved with the Communist Party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his first HUAC appearance. Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members. Similarly, Felson sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a Faustian pact to gain character.<ref>French, Karl and French, Phillip, ''Cult Movies,'' {{ISBN|0-8230-7916-3}} (2000)</ref> Rossen also takes aim at capitalism, often showing money as a malign and corrupting influence. Eddie, Bert and Findley are all shown to be perverted by their pursuit of money. Of the pool hall inhabitants, only Minnesota Fats, who never handles money himself, focusing only on the game he is playing, is uncorrupted and undamaged by the end. He is beaten, but knows when to quit. Rossen often points out and exposes class divisions; for example, when Minnesota Fats asks Preacher, a junkie willing to run errands, to get him some \"White Tavern whiskey, a glass and some ice,\" Eddie counters by ordering cheap bourbon, without any of the niceties: \"J.T.S. Brown, no ice, no glass.\"\n\nFilm and theatre historian [[Ethan Mordden]] has identified ''The Hustler'' as one of a handful of films from the early 1960s that re-defined the relationship of films to their audiences. This new relationship, he writes, is \"one of challenge rather than flattery, of doubt rather than certainty.\"<ref name=\"M28\">Mordden p. 28</ref> No film of the 1950s, Mordden asserts, \"took such a brutal, clear look at the ego-affirmation of the one-on-one contest, at the inhumanity of the winner or the castrated vulnerability of the loser.\"<ref name=\"M29\" /> Although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic [[film noir]], Mordden rejects the comparison based on Rossen's ultra-realistic style, also noting that the film lacks noir's \"Treacherous Woman or its relish in discovering crime among the bourgeoisie, hungry bank clerks and lusty wives.\"<ref name = M29>Mordden p. 29</ref> Mordden does note that while Fast Eddie \"has a slight fifties ring\",<ref name=\"M30\">Mordden p. 30</ref> the character \"makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily ''feeling'' tough guys of the '[[Rebel Without a Cause|rebel]]' era&nbsp;... [b]ut he does end up seeking out his emotions\"<ref name=\"M30\" /> and telling Bert that he is a loser because he's dead inside.<ref name=\"M30\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''The Hustler'' had its world premiere in Washington, D.C. on September 25, 1961. Prior to the premiere, [[Richard Burton]] hosted a midnight screening of the film for the casts of the season's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows, which generated a great deal of positive [[word of mouth]].<ref>{{cite video\n  | people = Naylor, David (director)\n  | title = The Hustler: The Inside Story\n  | medium = film\n  |date = 2001}}</ref> Initially reluctant to publicize the film, 20th Century Fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities.<ref>Casty p. 40</ref>\n\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason give iconic performances in this dark, morally complex tale of redemption.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hustler |title=The Hustler (1961) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=August 31, 2022}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 90 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Hustler Reviews |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-hustler?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1c |work=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=August 21, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe film was well-received by critics, although with the occasional reservation. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the \"sordid aspects\" of the story prevented the film from achieving the \"goal of being pure entertainment.\"<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite news\n  | last = Variety staff\n  | title = The Hustler\n  | work = Variety\n  | publisher = variety.com\n  | date = 1961-01-01\n  | url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791850.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0\n  | access-date = 2008-04-24}}</ref> ''Variety'' also felt the film was far too long. [[Stanley Kauffmann]], writing for ''[[The New Republic]]'', concurred in part with this assessment. Kauffmann strongly praised the principal cast, calling Newman \"first-rate\" and writing that Scott's was \"his most credible performance to date.\" Laurie, he writes, gives her part \"movingly anguished touches\" (although he also mildly criticizes her for over-reliance on [[Method acting]]). While he found that the script \"strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality to the pool hall\" and also declares it \"full of pseudo-meaning\", Kauffmann lauds Rossen's \"sure, economical\" direction, especially in regard to Gleason who, he says, does not so much act as \"[pose] for a number of pictures which are well arranged by Rossen.
