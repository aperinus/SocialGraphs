It marks Paxton's [[directorial debut]]. The plot focuses on the strange relationship between two young brothers and their father, who believes that he has been commanded by [[God]] to kill demons disguised as people.\n\n==Plot==\nFenton Meiks visits [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Wesley Doyle claiming that his brother Adam is the culprit in the \"God's Hand\" [[serial killer|serial killings]]. Fenton says Adam has committed suicide, prompting Fenton to fulfill a promise to bury his brother in a public rose garden in their hometown of Thurman. He begins to tell Doyle about the boys' childhood and suggests that the bodies of the God's Hand victims are buried in the rose garden.\n\nIn the summer of 1979, when the brothers were children, their father told them that he had been visited by an angel and tasked by God with \"destroying\" demons disguised as human beings; a mission which must be kept secret. Their father \"is led\" to 3 tools: an axe, gloves and a pipe; he receives a list of names from the angel as well. He incapacitates a woman with the pipe and brings her home to kill with the axe. When he lays his hand on her, he claims to see a vision of her evil, then kills her and makes the boys help him bury her in the rose garden. Fenton is horrified and believes his father insane; Adam claims he sees the visions and supports their father.\n\nAfter telling Doyle about the first killing, Doyle drives them to Thurman. On the way, Doyle tells Fenton that his mother had been murdered by someone that was never caught. Fenton then tells Doyle how they took the second victim in broad daylight, with his father insisting God would blind any witnesses. One night, Fenton's father tells him that after praying for the angel to visit Fenton (for his lack of faith) the angel instead visited him, and told him something bad about Fenton. He makes Fenton dig a hole and Fenton abandons all faith in God. Their father makes the hole into a cellar and moves the shed on top of it.\n\nDuring the third episode, Fenton escapes from the cellar and runs to the sheriff who takes him back home. To quiet Fenton's apparent ramblings, the sheriff looks in the cellar, but finds it empty. As he leaves, their father kills him and is angry with Fenton for making him murder an innocent man. After burying the body, Fenton's father tells him the angel told him Fenton was a demon. To save him and encourage him to have faith, he locks Fenton in the cellar for over a week. Fenton claims to have been enlightened and his father releases him to carry out the next killing.\n\nFenton cooperates with his father to take the next victim but alerts him just before his father hits the man with the pipe, nearly blowing the scheme. In the cellar, Fenton readies to kill the man with the axe, but kills his father instead. As he tries to release the man, Adam takes up the axe and kills him anyway. While burying the two men, Fenton makes Adam promise to bury him in the garden if he ever \"destroys\" him.\n\nDoyle is puzzled by his phrasing, since he said Adam killed himself. \"Fenton\" then reveals to Doyle that he is Adam. It is also revealed that Adam killed Fenton, who had grown up to become the actual God's Hand killer (a series of unrelated murders not committed by Adam \"destroying\" demons; Doyle is horrified to see the number of graves in the rose garden). Flashbacks reveal that Adam did in fact share his father's visions of the crimes of those they abducted, who were indeed demons. When Adam touches Doyle, a vision reveals that Doyle murdered his mother - he was on Adam's list. Adam kills him in a prepared grave as part of a long scheme to get him there.\n\nAfter Doyle's disappearance, Agent Griffin Hull, who saw Adam, can't remember his face. The security tapes are also inexplicably obscured by static whenever Adam is in view. The FBI raid Fenton's house, finding the God's Hand list and Doyle's badge, which corroborate his being the killer. Agent Hull visits Adam Meiks, a nearby county sheriff, to tell him Fenton was the killer. Upon shaking his hand, Adam declares the agent a good man.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bill Paxton]] - Dad Meiks, Fenton and Adam's widower father and a serial killer\n*[[Matthew McConaughey]] - Adam Meiks/Fenton Meiks\n*[[Powers Boothe]] - FBI Agent Wesley Doyle\n*[[Matt O'Leary]] - Young Fenton, Adam's brother\n*[[Jeremy Sumpter]] - Young Adam, Fenton's brother\n*[[Luke Askew]] - Sheriff Smalls\n*[[Levi Kreis]] - Fenton Meiks/Adam Meiks\n*[[Derk Cheetwood]] - Agent Griffin Hull\n*Missy Crider - Becky Meiks (as Melissa Crider)\n*Alan Davidson - Brad White\n*[[Cynthia Ettinger]] - Cynthia Harbridge\n*Vincent Chase - Edward March\n*Gwen McGee - Operator\n*Edmond Scott Ratliff - The Angel\n*Rebecca Tilney - Teacher\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2000, it was announced that Lions Gate Films would fully finance Bill Paxton's directorial debut,''Frailty''.<ref name=\"FrailtyLGF\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/lions-gate-strongly-backing-frailty-1117787825/|title= Lions Gate strongly backing \u2018Frailty\u2019  |publisher=Variety|access-date=October 5, 2022}}</ref> The film at one point had been slated to be produced by [[Atlantic Streamline]], but Atlantic's unwillingness to handle domestic rights in addition to foreign rights resulted in the deal never materializing.<ref name=\"FrailtyLGF\" /> At the time the ''Frailty'' marked Lions Gate's largest investment in an in-house production.<ref name=\"FrailtyLGF\" />\n==Reception==\n''Frailty'' received generally positive reviews, with a 75% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on movie [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 154 reviews.
