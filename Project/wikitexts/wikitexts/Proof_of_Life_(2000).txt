The title refers to a phrase commonly used to indicate proof that a [[kidnap]] victim is still alive.  The film's screenplay was written by [[Tony Gilroy]], who also was an executive producer, and was inspired by [[William Prochnau]]'s ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine article \"Adventures in the Ransom Trade\",<ref>Prochnau, William (May 1998).  \"Adventures in the Ransom Trade\". ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' (453): 134\u2013144. {{ISSN|0733-8899}}.</ref><ref>Prochnau, William.

While driving one morning through the city, Peter is caught in traffic and then ambushed and abducted by [[guerrilla]] rebels of the Liberation Army of Tecala (ELT). Believing that Peter is working on Quad Carbon's [[oil pipeline]], ELT soldiers lead him through the [[jungle]].\n\nTerry Thorne ([[Russell Crowe]]), a former member of the British [[Special Air Service]], arrives in Tecala fresh from a successful hostage rescue in [[Chechnya]]. As an expert negotiator in [[kidnapping]]-and-[[ransom]] cases, he is assigned by his company, Luthan Risk, to bargain for Peter's safe return. Unfortunately, it is learned that Quad Carbon is on the verge of [[bankruptcy]] and [[takeover]], and therefore has no [[insurance]] coverage for kidnapping, so they cannot afford Thorne's services. Despite Alice's pleas to stay, Thorne leaves the country. Alice is then assigned a corrupt local hostage negotiator, who immediately urges her to pay the ELT's first ransom demand: a $50,000 \"good faith\" payment. Not knowing what to do, Alice agrees, but the transaction is stopped by Thorne who (due to his conscience) has returned to help. He is aided by Dino ([[David Caruso]]), a competing negotiator and ex\u2013[[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]].\n\nOver the next few months, Thorne uses a [[radio]] to speak with an ELT contact, and the two argue over terms for Peter's release\u2014including a [[ransom]] payment that Alice can afford. Thorne and Alice bond through the ordeal, and become intimate. They eventually negotiate a sum of $650,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter has become a prisoner at the ELT's jungle base camp. There, he befriends another hostage named Kessler ([[Gottfried John]])\u2014a missionary and former member of the [[French Foreign Legion]]\u2014who has lived in the camp for nineteen months. The two concoct an escape plan, but during their attempt they are quickly tracked by the ELT. Kessler falls into a river after being shot in the shoulder and manages to escape, but Peter steps on a trap and is recaptured. Kessler is found and hospitalized. Thorne's ELT contact subsequently refuses to respond to his calls. Luckily, one of Alice's young maids recognizes his voice over the radio and reveals he is a government official. Thorne confronts the contact, who confirms that Peter is alive, but because of the ELT's escalating war with the government and Peter's knowledge of the terrain, the ELT will no longer negotiate.\n\nAt Thorne's urging, Alice and Kessler convince the Tecala government that the ELT is mounting an attack on the pipeline being built through their territory. This forces the government army to mobilize, thus forcing a bulk of the camp's ELT troops to mobilize for a counter-attack. Thorne, Dino, and several associates are then inserted by helicopter and raid the weakened ELT base. They overcome the camp's soldiers, free Peter and another hostage, and then fly back to the city, where Alice happily reunites with her husband. Thorne and Alice share a final intimate moment before the latter departs with Peter on an immediate flight to the U.S.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Alice Bowman\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Terry Thorne\n* [[David Morse]] as Peter Bowman\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Janis Goodman\n* [[David Caruso]] as Dino\n* [[Anthony Heald]] as Ted Fellner\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Lord Luthan\n* [[Stanley Anderson]] as Jerry\n* [[Gottfried John]] as Eric Kessler\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Wyatt\n* [[Michael Kitchen]] as Ian Havery\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Ivy\n* [[Mario Ernesto S\u00e1nchez]] as Arturo Fernandez\n* [[Pietro Sibille]] as Juaco\n* [[Vicky Hern\u00e1ndez]] as Maria\n* Norma Mart\u00ednez as Norma\n* Carlos Blanchard as Carlos <!--we only need to list this once, thanks-->\n* [[Rowena King]] as Pamela <!--same with this one-->\n* [[Diego Trujillo]] as Eliodoro\n* Roberto Frisone as Calitri\n* Gerard Naprous as Pierre LeNoir\n* Merlin Hanbury-Tenison as Henry Thorne\n* [[Aleksandr Baluev]] as Russian Colonel\n* Said K.

Tecala's geographic and urban appearance and its political characteristics were based loosely on a mix of several [[Andes|Andean]] countries.\n\nThe ELT's characterization appears to be primarily based on the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC).  Coincidentally, Colombia's second largest guerrilla group is the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional]] or ELN.\n\n[[Control Risks]], a risk consulting firm, was hired to provide security for the cast and crew while filming on location. The firm also provided contacts for character inspiration for the kidnap and ransom consulting seen in the film.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Prochnau |first=William |date=December 2000 |title=Jungle Fever |journal=Premiere Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe movie end credit and post-script says: \"Inspired by the VANITY FAIR article 'Adventures in the Ransom Trade' by William Prochnau and by the book ''Long March to Freedom'' by Thomas Hargrove.\n\n===Tecala===\nThe Republic of Tecala, where most of ''Proof of Life'' is set, is a [[fictional countries|fictional]] [[South America]]n country. Tecala has long been the scene of an internal conflict between its government forces and the Liberation Army of Tecala (ELT). The ELT was originally a [[Marxist]] [[guerrilla]] group supported by the [[Soviet Union]], but after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Soviet Union's dissolution]] in 1991, the ELT's primary source of funding fell through, and they began [[kidnapping]] people for ransom to fund their operations. A map seen in the film is that of [[Ecuador]]. The country's capital [[Quito]] was chosen along with the eastern jungle and the nearby city of [[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]] in the Ecuadorian [[Andes]].\n\n==Release ==\n{{Anchor|Distribution}}\nThe film opened in wide release in the United States on December 8, 2000 for 2,705 screens.

He wrote, \"[the film displays] a gaping lack of emotional connection among the characters in a romantic triangle that feels conspicuously unromantic ... what ultimately sinks this stylish but heartless film is a flat lead performance by the eternally snippy Meg Ryan ... Ms. Ryan expresses no inner conflict, nor much of anything else beyond a mounting tension. Even when her wide blue eyes well up with tears, the pain she conveys is more the frustration of a little girl who has misplaced her doll than any deep, empathetic suffering.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F02EFDE113CF93BA35751C1A9669C8B63 | last= Holden | first= Stephen | work = The New York Times | title = Where Cynicism Rules, Integrity Can Be Heroic | date = December 8, 2000 }}</ref>\n\nCritic [[David Ansen]] gave the film a mixed review, writing,\n\n<blockquote>Taylor Hackford's thriller ''Proof of Life'' leaves a lot to be desired, but it's got its hands on a fascinating subject ... To be fair, Tony Gilroy's screenplay keeps the romance on the back burner ... Thorne is the most compelling aspect of ''Proof of Life,'' thanks to Crowe's quiet, hard-bitten charisma. It's a part [[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]] once would have played\u2014the amoral tough guy who rises to the moral occasion\u2014and Crowe gives it just the right note of gravel-voiced masculinity. But neither Crowe, Ryan nor the topical subject keeps ''Proof of Life'' from feeling recycled. For all the up-to-the-minute research, the movie still gives off the musty scent of Hollywood contrivance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2000/12/10/hostage-heat.html |last=Ansen |first=David |work=[[Newsweek]] |title=Hostage Heat |date=December 11, 2000 |access-date=December 1, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 39% based on 117 reviews; the average rating is 5.3/10.
