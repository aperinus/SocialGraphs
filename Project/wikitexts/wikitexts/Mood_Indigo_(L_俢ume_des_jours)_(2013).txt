It is an adaptation of [[Boris Vian]]'s 1947 novel with the same French title, translated ''[[Froth on the Daydream]]'' in English.\n\nThe film received two nominations at the [[4th Magritte Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Magritte du cin\u00e9ma 2014|url=http://www.lesmagritteducinema.com/nominees.php?lang=fr&edition=2014|publisher=Acad\u00e9mie Andr\u00e9 Delvaux|accessdate=January 9, 2014|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109204752/http://www.lesmagritteducinema.com/nominees.php?lang=fr&edition=2014|archive-date=January 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It also received three nominations at the [[39th C\u00e9sar Awards]],<ref name=\"C\u00e9sarNoms\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/frances-cesar-awards-nominations-announced-675607 |title=Berenice Bejo, Lea Seydoux, Roman Polanski Among France's Cesar Awards Nominees |accessdate=1 February 2014 |work=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> winning in one category.<ref name=\"C\u00e9sarWinners\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cesar-awards-winners-list-684357 |title=France's Cesar Awards: 'Me, Myself and Mum' Wins Best Film |accessdate=1 March 2014 |work=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nColin has a very pleasant life: he is rich, he loves the food his cook makes (Nicolas), he loves his pianocktail (portmanteau of piano and cocktail, a word invented by Vian) and his friend Chick.\n\nOne day while having lunch with Chick, Chick tells him that he met a girl named Alise with whom he has a common passion: the writer Jean-Sol Partre (a [[spoonerism]] of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was Boris Vian's friend).  Colin meets Chloe at a party Chick invited him to. They fall in love, marry, but Chloe becomes ill during their honeymoon. As time passes, Chloe's condition deteriorates while the relationship between Chick and Alise turns sour.  Frustrated with their own deteriorating relationships, Colin and Alise sleep with each other, although they both come to regret it shortly after.\n\nThe aesthetic of the film changes from colorful and whimsical to monochromatic and tragic as the film progresses.  These effects are observed most acutely in Colin's home, which decays supernaturally, and his mouse, who reluctantly tolerates the house until he abandons Colin.\n\nColin spends his fortune on treating Chloe, which causes him to passionately fire his cook and sell his pianocktail, and he slips into poverty as Chloe passes away.  His friend Chick spends both his and Colin's money on anything that has to do with Partre, and Chick loses his job due to a Partre-related incident and is later killed when resisting law-enforcement officers.  Alise tracks down Partre himself and kills him. Afterwards, Alise disappears. Colin, Nicolas, and his fianc\u00e9, Isis, hold a funeral for Chloe. Unable to bear the grief, Colin jumps into a river, sinking into the darkness.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Romain Duris]] as Colin\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Chlo\u00e9\n* [[Gad Elmaleh]] as Chick\n* [[A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga]] as Alise\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Nicolas\n* [[Charlotte Le Bon]] as Isis\n* [[Sacha Bourdo]] as The mice\n* [[Natacha R\u00e9gnier]] as The remedy saleswoman\n* [[Philippe Torreton]] as [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Jean-Sol Partre]]\n* [[Alain Chabat]] as [[Jules Gouff\u00e9|Gouff\u00e9]]\n* [[Zinedine Soualem]] as The plant manager\n* [[Laurent Lafitte]] as The society's owner\n* [[August Darnell]] as [[Duke Ellington]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senscritique.com/film/L_Ecume_des_jours/470003/details,%20https://www.senscritique.com/film/L_Ecume_des_jours/470003/details|title=Casting de L'\u00c9cume des jours (2013) - SensCritique|website=www.senscritique.com}}</ref>\n* [[Michel Gondry]] as Docteur Mangemanche (uncredited)<ref>{{cite book |last=McQuiston |first=Kate |date=27 November 2020 |title=Music and Sound in the Worlds of Michel Gondry|url={{Google books|7Zr6DwAAQBAJ|keywords=Mangemanche|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=43 |isbn=9780367226961}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe screenplay was written by Luc Bossi and [[Michel Gondry]] and based on the 1947 novel ''[[Froth on the Daydream]]'' by [[Boris Vian]].<ref name=cestart>{{cite web|last=Lemercier|first=Fabien|date=2012-04-10|url=http://www.cineuropa.org/2011/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&documentID=218486|title=Cameras rolling on Michel Gondry's ''Mood Indigo''|work=cineuropa.org|publisher=Cineuropa|accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref> The novel had previously been adapted into a 1968 French film with the English title ''Spray of the Days'', and a 2001 Japanese film with the title ''Chloe''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/159241/L-Ecume-Des-Jours/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324063853/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/159241/L-Ecume-Des-Jours/overview|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-03-24|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Dan Pavlides|date=2013|title=L'Ecume Des Jours (1968)|accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stratton|first=David|date=2001-02-13|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117797299?refcatid=31|title=Chloe|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2012-05-03}}</ref> ''Mood Indigo'' was produced by Brio Films, with co-production support from [[France 2|France 2 Cin\u00e9ma]], [[StudioCanal]], and the Belgian company Scope Pictures.
