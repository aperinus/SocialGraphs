The film is a sequel to the 2003 film, ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'', and the second installment in the [[Underworld (film series)|''Underworld'' franchise]]. The plot follows [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] and Michael, again played by [[Kate Beckinsale]] and [[Scott Speedman]], respectively, as they fight to protect the Corvinus bloodline from its hidden past.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1202, an army led by the three vampire [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] ([[Markus Corvinus|Markus]], [[Viktor (Underworld)|Viktor]], and [[Amelia (Underworld)|Amelia]]) arrives at a village full of [[Werewolf|Werewolves]] and capture their target: Markus's twin brother, [[William Corvinus]], the first and most powerful werewolf. Despite Markus's defiance, Viktor orders that William be imprisoned in a secret location forever.\n\nIn the present day, Markus awakens and kills regent [[Kraven (Underworld)|Kraven]]. Alexander Corvinus, A.K.A ''Lorenz Macaro'', the forefather to both the vampire and Lycan races, sends in a team of \"cleaners\" to investigate the aftermath from the battle in the Lycans' lair. Macaro examines Viktor's corpse and finds a metal disc inside; it is the match to a pendant originally worn by [[Sonja (Underworld)|Sonja]]. Michael obtained the other half of the pendant after the death of Lucian.\n\nMeanwhile, vampiress [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] takes Michael to a safe house. Using the knowledge obtained from Kraven's blood, Markus tracks the pair down and attacks them, but they escape and hide in a warehouse. That night, Selene recalls seeing the pendant as a child, but does not know its significance. Wanting to know why Markus wants it, the two travel to the hideout of the exiled vampire historian [[List of Underworld characters#Andreas Tanis|Andreas Tanis]]\n\nTanis reveals that Markus was the first vampire, one of the three sons of [[Alexander Corvinus|Macaro]], the first immortal. Markus was bitten by a bat and metamorphosed into a vampire, while William was bitten by a wolf and became a werewolf. The third son remained human and gave rise to a line of mortal descendants including Michael, who turned into the first Lycan-Vampire [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]. The first werewolves created by William were entirely animal and unable to return to their human forms. Due to William's destructiveness, Markus approached Viktor, then a dying mortal warlord, and offered to turn him and his army into vampires in exchange for tracking down and stopping William, and in destroying those he had infected. Tanis further reveals that Selene's father was the architect who built William's prison and that the pendant is the key. Viktor killed Selene's family because they knew the prison's location, but made Selene into a vampiress with the location of the prison encoded in her blood. After Selene and Michael leave, Markus arrives and drinks Tanis' blood to learn Selene and Michael's location, killing Tanis.\n\nSelene and Michael visit Macaro, who refuses to assist Selene in killing his sons. Markus arrives, fights Michael and impales him. He learns the location of William's prison by drinking Selene's blood, mortally wounds his father and obtains the other half of the pendant. He intends, with William, to rule the world as the god-like master of a race of vampire-Lycan hybrids. On Macaro's bidding, Selene drinks his blood, enhancing her physical strength and healing abilities to a level equivalent to that of a hybrid. Afterwards, Macaro blows up his ship, killing himself.\n\nSelene, aboard Macaro's helicopter, leads his cleaners to the prison to kill Markus, who has already freed William. In the ensuing battle, William bites the cleaners, turning them into werewolves. Michael, presumed dead, awakens and joins the fight, killing William by ripping his head off. Selene battles Markus and kills him by pushing him into the rotor blades of the cleaners' crashed helicopter.\n\nAfter the battle, Selene realizes that Alexander's blood granted her hybrid abilities, including being immune to the effects of sunlight, which is lethal to vampires.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]]\n** Lily Mo Sheen as young Selene\n* [[Scott Speedman]] as Michael Corvin\n* [[Tony Curran]] as Markus Corvinus\n* [[Derek Jacobi]] as Alexander Corvinus/Lorenz Macaro\n* [[Steven Mackintosh]] as Andreas Tanis\n* [[Shane Brolly]] as Kraven\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Viktor\n* [[Zita G\u00f6r\u00f6g]] as Amelia\n* [[Brian Steele]] as William Corvinus\n* [[Andrew Kavadas]] as Selene's Father\n* Kayla Levins as Selene's Sister\n* [[John Mann (musician)|John Mann]] as Samuel\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at #1 on 3,207 screens with a weekend box office (January 20\u201322, 2006) of $26.9 million, for an average of $8,388 per theater.<ref name=\"Underworld: Evolution (2006)\">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=underworld2.htm Underworld: Evolution (2006)].
