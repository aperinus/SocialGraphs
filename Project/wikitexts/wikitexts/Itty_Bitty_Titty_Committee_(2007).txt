The film had its premiere at the international film festival [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] on February 9, 2007, where it was nominated for a [[Teddy Award]] for Best Feature.

She meets Sadie, who invites her to join Clits In Action, or C(i)A, a [[Far-left politics|radical]] [[Third-wave feminist]] group. Anna soon gets in touch with her political side.<ref name=\"AfterEllen.com\">{{Cite web |last=Kregloe |first=Karman |date=29 May 2007 |title=Review of \"Itty Bitty Titty Committee\" |url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/2007/5/ittybitty |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.ph/20120720012750/http://www.afterellen.com/movies/2007/5/ittybitty |archive-date=20 July 2012 |website=[[AfterEllen.com]]}}</ref> She takes part in illegal activism with the group and becomes more aggressive in her daily life.\n\nAnna starts falling for Sadie, who has been involved for years with an older woman named Courtney. Courtney works with a more mainstream feminist organization and disagrees with the C(i)A's method of creating awareness through public art, which usually involves vandalism.\n\nThe group travels to take part in a [[gay marriage]] protest \u2013 instead of being for or against it, they argue that marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism. Despite being warned by another member of the C(i)A, Meat, that Sadie uses people, Anna shares a night of passion with her while they stay in a hotel. At the rally the next day, the outspoken Shulamith ends up nearly coming to blows with a protester. The fight is caught by a local news crew and the group's message is misconstrued as violent and [[homophobia|homophobic]]. Meat also reveals that their website \u2013 which they considered the center of their activism \u2013 has not received hits from anyone besides themselves.\n\nC(i)A attempts to have a meeting at Courtney's home, but personal conflicts come to a head. Anna believes Sadie is going to leave Courtney to be with her, but Sadie remains dependent on her partner. Meat and Shulamith announce that they're giving up on the group, Sadie stays behind with Courtney, and Aggie (a [[transgender]] man who's part of the C(i)A) comforts Anna, who is heartbroken over Sadie's rejection and the loss of the C(i)A. They end up partying together and having a one-night stand. In the morning, Aggie has prepared breakfast and procured a flower for Anna, who only considers him a friend. Sadie arrives to talk about what happened the night before. Anna tries to explain that her night with Aggie meant nothing. He overhears and is deeply hurt. Sadie leaves and Anna finds herself truly alone.\n\nIn an attempt to fix things, Anna formulates a master plan to get C(i)A national attention. Meat and Shulamith like her idea, but insist she must make things right with Aggie. Anna apologizes, Aggie forgives her, and the four carry out the plan, without Sadie.\n\nAnna attends her sister's wedding, bringing joy to her family, but leaves early to execute her part of the plan \u2013 sneaking into the studio of a popular talk show with Aggie and Meat. Courtney is appearing on the show to argue about the appropriateness of a celebration over the (arbitrary) anniversary of the construction of the Washington Monument, which she feels is a distraction from real issues. When the host requests a live shot of the monument, the C(i)A feeds their footage in. With the expert help of one of Shulamith's lovers, Calvin (who was discharged from the military for being a lesbian under [[Don't Ask Don't Tell]]), and Meat's prowess with sculpture, a giant phallus has been erected atop the [[Washington Monument]] and is blown off with explosives. Back at the studio, Aggie pulls the fire alarm and the group escapes.\n\nIn the getaway car waiting for Anna, she is surprised to see Sadie, who has finally broken it off with Courtney. Sadie apologizes for her behavior, and the two agree to just be friends, but then kiss. Through text in the epilogue, it is revealed that Shulamith and Calvin volunteered to take the fall for the explosion, and received a reduced sentence because no one was hurt. Aggie started hormone therapy, started a new feminist group for men and got a girlfriend. Meat's sculpture appearing on TV launched her art career. Courtney took the talk show host, Marcy, out to dinner after fleeing the building together. Marcy subsequently left her husband to move in with Courtney. Anna and Sadie remain together, and Anna now attends college, where she has created a group focused on positive body image called the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Melonie Diaz]] as Anna, an 18-year-old [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]] office girl for a plastic surgeon's office who becomes a member of the Clits In Action. \n* Nicole Vicius as Sadie, leader of the Clits In Action group, dating Courtney\n* [[Deak Evgenikos]] as Meat, an artistic member of the C(i)A.\n* [[Carly Pope]] as Shulie, member of the Clits In Action\n* [[Lauren Mollica]] as Aggie, a [[trans man]]  \n* [[Melanie Mayron]] as Courtney, Sadie's older girlfriend who funds the Clits In Action. \n* [[Daniela Sea|Daniel Sea]] as Calvin, a [[butch dyke]] former military servicewoman\n* [[Mircea Monroe]] as Justine\n* [[Guinevere Turner]] as Marcy Maloney, a television reporter\n* [[Jenny Shimizu]] as Laurel\n* [[Leslie Grossman]] as Maude\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Chris\n* [[Joel Michaely]] as Peter, a member of a feminist action group\n* [[M.
