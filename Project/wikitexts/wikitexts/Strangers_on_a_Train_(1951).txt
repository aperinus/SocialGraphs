On a train, wealthy smooth-talking psychopath Bruno Antony recognizes Haines and reveals his idea for a murder scheme: two strangers meet and \"swap murders\" \u2014 Bruno suggests he kill Miriam and Guy kill Bruno's hated father. Each will murder a stranger, with no apparent motive, so neither will be suspected. Guy humors Bruno by pretending to find his idea amusing, but is so eager to get away from Bruno that he leaves behind his engraved cigarette lighter.\n\nGuy meets with Miriam, who is pregnant by someone else, at her workplace in Metcalf, their hometown. Miriam informs Guy that she no longer wants to end their marriage. She threatens to claim that he is the father, in order to thwart any divorce attempt. That evening, Bruno follows Miriam to an [[amusement park]] and strangles her while Guy is on the train to Washington. When Guy arrives home, Bruno informs him Miriam is dead and insists that he must now honor their deal.\n\nGuy goes to the Mortons' home, where Anne's father informs Guy that his wife has been murdered. Anne's sister Barbara says that the police will think that Guy is the murderer since he has a motive. The police question Guy, but cannot confirm his alibi: a professor Guy met on the train was so drunk that he cannot remember their encounter. The police assign an escort to watch him.\n\nBruno follows Guy around Washington, introduces himself to Anne, and appears at a party at Senator Morton's house. To amuse another guest, Bruno playfully demonstrates how to strangle a woman. His gaze falls upon Barbara, whose appearance resembles Miriam's. This triggers a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]; Bruno compulsively squeezes the woman's neck, and other guests intervene to stop him from strangling her to death. Barbara tells Anne that Bruno was looking at her while strangling the other woman, and Anne realizes Barbara's resemblance to Miriam. Her suspicions aroused, Anne confronts Guy, who tells her the truth about Bruno's scheme.\n\nBruno sends Guy a package containing a pistol, a house key, and a map showing the location of his father's bedroom. Guy creeps into Bruno's father's room to warn him of his son's murderous intentions, but instead finds Bruno there waiting for him. Guy tries to persuade Bruno to seek psychiatric help, but Bruno threatens to punish Guy for breaking their deal.\n\nAnne visits Bruno's home and tries explaining to his befuddled mother that her son is a murderer. Bruno mentions Guy's missing cigarette lighter to Anne and claims that Guy asked him to search the murder site for it. Guy infers that Bruno intends to plant it at the scene of the murder and incriminate him. After winning a tennis match, Guy evades the police escort and heads for the amusement park to stop Bruno.\n\nWhen Bruno arrives at the amusement park, a carnival worker recognizes him from the night of the murder; he informs the police, who think he has recognized Guy. After Guy arrives, he and Bruno fight on the park's carousel. Believing that Guy is trying to escape, a police officer shoots at him, but instead kills the carousel operator, causing the carousel to spin out of control. A carnival worker crawls underneath it and applies the brakes too abruptly, causing the carousel to spin off its support, trapping the mortally injured Bruno underneath. The worker who called the police tells them that Bruno, not Guy, is the one he remembers seeing the night of the murder. As Bruno dies, his fingers unclench to reveal Guy's lighter in his hand. Realizing that Guy is not the murderer, the police ask him to come to the station to tie up loose ends.\n\nSometime later, another stranger on a train attempts to strike up conversation with Guy in the same way as had Bruno. Guy and Anne coldly walk away from him.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:StrangersCameoPubReenact.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In one of his trademark [[Cameo appearance|cameos]], Hitchcock boards the train in Metcalf after Farley Granger's character exits.]]\n\n* [[Farley Granger]] as Guy Haines\n* [[Ruth Roman]] as Anne Morton\n* [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]] as Bruno Antony\n* [[Leo G.

He is seen carrying a [[double bass]] as he climbs onto a train.\n\nHitchcock said that correct casting saved him \"a reel of storytelling time\", since audiences would sense qualities in the actors that did not have to be spelled out.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=428}} Hitchcock said that he originally wanted [[William Holden]] for the Guy Haines role,<ref name=truff/><ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Strangers on a Train movie review|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-strangers-on-a-train-1951|website=rogerebert.com|date=January 1, 2004}}</ref> but Holden declined. \"Holden would have been all wrong\u2014too sturdy, too put off by Bruno\", writes critic [[Roger Ebert]].{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=428}} \"Granger is softer and more elusive, more convincing as he tries to slip out of Bruno's conversational web instead of flatly rejecting him.\"{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=428}}\n\nWarner Bros. wanted their own stars, already under contract, cast wherever possible. In the casting of Anne Morton, [[Jack L. Warner]] got what he wanted when he assigned Ruth Roman to the project, over Hitchcock's objections.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=345}} The director found her \"bristling\" and \"lacking in sex appeal\" and said that she had been \"foisted upon him.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=450}} Perhaps it was the circumstances of her forced casting, but Roman became the target of Hitchcock's scorn throughout the production.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=346}} Granger described Hitchcock's attitude toward Roman as \"disinterest\" in the actress, and said he saw Hitchcock treat Edith Evanson the same way on the set of ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948). \"He had to have one person in each film he could harass,\" Granger said.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=346}}\n\n[[Kasey Rogers]] (credited as Laura Elliott) noted that she had perfect vision at the time the movie was made, but Hitchcock insisted she wear the character's thick [[eyeglasses]], even in long shots when regular glass lenses would have been undetectable. Rogers was effectively blind with the glasses on and needed to be guided by the other actors.<ref>''Strangers on a Train: The Victim's P.O.V.'' (2004), DVD documentary</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nHitchcock secured the rights to the Patricia Highsmith novel for just $7,500 since it was her first novel. As usual, Hitchcock kept his name out of the negotiations to keep the purchase price low.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=341}} Highsmith was quite annoyed when she later discovered who bought the rights for such a small amount.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=342}}\n\nSecuring the rights to the novel was the least of the hurdles Hitchcock would have to vault to get the property from printed page to screen. He got a [[Film treatment|treatment]] that pleased him on the second attempt, from writer [[Whitfield Cook]], who wove a [[homoerotic]] subtext into the story.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=442}} With treatment in hand, Hitchcock shopped for a screenwriter; he wanted a \"name\" writer to lend some prestige to the screenplay, but was turned down by eight writers, including [[John Steinbeck]] and [[Thornton Wilder]], all of whom thought the story too tawdry and were put off by Highsmith's first-timer status.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=444}} Talks with [[Dashiell Hammett]] got further,{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=342}} but here too communications ultimately broke down, and Hammett never took the assignment.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=342}}\n\nHitchcock then tried [[Raymond Chandler]], who had earned an Oscar nomination for his first screenplay, ''[[Double Indemnity]]'', in collaboration with [[Billy Wilder]].{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=342}}<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krohn|first1=Bill|title=''I Confess'' \u2013 Historical Note|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2000/cteq/confessbk/|website=Senses of Cinema}}</ref> Chandler took the job despite his opinion that it was \"a silly little story.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=444}} But Chandler was a notoriously difficult collaborator and the two men could not have had more different meeting styles: Hitchcock enjoyed long, rambling off-topic meetings where often the film would not even be mentioned for hours, while Chandler was strictly business and wanted to get out and get writing. He called the meetings \"god-awful jabber sessions which seem to be an inevitable although painful part of the picture business.\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=342}} Chandler also felt that the original novel's plot was superior to Hitchcock's version, and argued that it should be restored. He complained privately that Hitchcock was too ready \u201cto sacrifice dramatic logic (insofar as it exists) for the sake of a camera effect.\u201d{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=445}} Interpersonal relations deteriorated rapidly until finally Chandler became openly combative; at one point, upon viewing Hitchcock struggling to exit from his limousine, Chandler remarked within earshot, \"Look at the fat bastard trying to get out of his car!\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=344}} This would be their last collaboration. Chandler completed a first draft, then wrote a second, without hearing a single word back from Hitchcock; when finally he did get a communication from the director in late September, it was his dismissal from the project.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=344}}\n\nNext, Hitchcock tried to hire [[Ben Hecht]], but learned he was unavailable. Hecht suggested his assistant, [[Czenzi Ormonde]], to write the screenplay.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=344}} Although Ormonde was without a formal screen credit, she did have two things in her favor: her recently published collection of short stories, ''Laughter From Downstairs'', was attracting good notices from critics, and she was \"a fair-haired beauty with long shimmering hair.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=447}}\u2014always a plus with Hitchcock. With his new writer, he wanted to start from square one:\n\n{{blockquote|At their first conference, Hitchcock made a show of pinching his nose, then holding up Chandler's draft with his thumb and forefinger and dropping it into a wastebasket. He told the obscure writer that the famous one hadn't written a solitary line he intended to use, and they would have to start all over on page one, using Cook's treatment as a guide. The director told Ormonde to forget all about the book, then told her the story of the film himself, from beginning to end.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=447}}}}\n\nThere was not much time though \u2014 less than three weeks until location shooting was scheduled to start in the East. Ormonde hunkered down with Hitchcock's associate producer Barbara Keon\u2014disparagingly called \"Hitchcock's factotum\" by Chandler{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=449}}\u2014and [[Alma Reville]], Hitchcock's wife. Together the three women, working under the boss's guidance and late into most nights,{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=344}} finished enough of the script in time to send the company East. The rest was complete by early November.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=449}} Three notable additions the trio had made were the runaway merry-go-round, the cigarette lighter, and the thick eyeglasses.{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=192}}\n\nThere was one point of agreement between Chandler and Hitchcock, although it would come only much later, near the release of the film: they both acknowledged that since virtually none of Chandler's work remained in the final script, his name should be removed from the credits.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=449}} Hitchcock preferred the writing credit of Whitfield Cook and Czenzi Ormonde, but Warner Bros. wanted the cachet of the Chandler name and insisted it stay on.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=449}}\n\nEven while the torturous writing stage was plodding its course, the director's excitement about the project was boundless. \"Hitchcock raced ahead of everyone: the script, the cast, the studio... pieces of the film were dancing like electrical charges in his brain.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=443}} The more the film resolved in his mind's eye, the more he knew his director of photography would play a critical role in the scenes' execution. He found exactly what he needed right on the Warners lot in the person of staff cameraman [[Robert Burks]], who would continue to work with Hitchcock, shooting every Hitchcock picture through to ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), with the exception of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=347}} \"Low-keyed, mild mannered\", Burks was \"a versatile risk-taker with a penchant for moody atmosphere. Burks was an exceptionally apt choice for what would prove to be Hitchcock's most Germanic film in years: the compositions dense, the lighting almost surreal, the optical effects demanding.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=450}} None was more demanding than Bruno's strangulation of Miriam, shown reflected in her eyeglass lens: \"It was the kind of shot Hitchcock had been tinkering with for twenty years\u2014and Robert Burks captured it magnificently.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=452}}\n\nBurks considered his fourteen years with Hitchcock the best of his career: \"You never have any trouble with him as long as you know your job and do it. Hitchcock insists on perfection. He has no patience with mediocrity on the set or at a dinner table. There can be no compromise in his work, his food or his wines.\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=347}} Robert Burks received the film's sole [[Academy Award]] nomination for its black and white photography.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=452}}\n\n===Production===\nWith cast nailed down, a script in hand, and a director of photography in tune with Hitchcock's vision on board, the company was ready to commence filming. Hitchcock had a crew shoot background footage of the [[1950 Davis Cup]] finals held August 25\u201327, 1950 at the [[West Side Tennis Club]] in [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills, New York]]. While there, the crew had done some other [[location scouting]].{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=343}} Exteriors would be shot on both coasts, and interiors on Warner Brothers' soundstages.\n\nHitchcock and his cast and crew decamped for the East Coast on October 17, 1950.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=345}} For six days, they shot at [[Penn Station (New York)|Penn Station]] in New York City, at the railroad station at [[Danbury, Connecticut]]\u2014which became Guy's hometown Metcalf\u2014and in spots around Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=345}}\n\nBy month's end, they were back in California. Hitchcock had written exacting specifications for an amusement park, which was constructed on the ranch of director [[Rowland V. Lee|Rowland Lee]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth, California]].{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=346}} The amusement park exteriors were shot there and at an actual [[Tunnel of love (ride)|Tunnel of Love]] at a fairground in [[Canoga Park, Los Angeles|Canoga Park, California]].{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=346}} Hitchcock had already shot the long shots for the tennis match at Forest Hills and would add closer shots with Granger and Jack Cushingham, Granger's tennis coach off-screen and Guy's tennis opponent Fred Reynolds on-screen at a tennis club in [[South Gate, California]].{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=347}} The rest of the shooting would take place on Warner soundstages, including many seemingly exterior and on-location shots that were actually done inside in front of rear-projection screens.\n\n''Strangers on a Train'' marked something of a renaissance for Hitchcock, after several years of low enthusiasm for his late-1940s output,{{sfn|Spoto|1983|pp= 339\u201340}} and he threw himself into the micromanagement of some of its production. Hitchcock himself designed Bruno's lobster necktie, revealed in a close-up to have strangling lobster claws,{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=353}} and \"he personally selected an orange peel, a chewing-gum wrapper, wet leaves, and a bit of crumpled paper that were used for sewer debris\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=347}} in the scene where Bruno inadvertently drops Guy's lighter down the storm drain.\n\nHe also showed intense interest in a seldom-considered detail of character delineation: food.\n\n{{blockquote|\"Preferences in food characterize people...\" Hitchcock said. \"I have always given it careful consideration, so that my characters never eat out of character. Bruno orders with gusto and with an interest in what he is going to eat \u2014 lamb chops, French fries, and chocolate ice cream. A very good choice for train food. And the chocolate ice cream is probably what he thought about first. Bruno is rather a child. He is also something of a hedonist. Guy, on the other hand, shows little interest in eating the lunch, apparently having given it no advance thought, in contrast to Bruno, and he merely orders what seems his routine choice, a hamburger and coffee.\"{{sfn|Chandler|2006|pp=201\u201302}}}}\n\n[[File:EyeglassLensStrangers1951.gif|thumb|Hitchcock and Burks collaborated on a double printing technique to create this iconic shot still studied in film schools today.]]\nOne of the most memorable single shots in the Hitchcock canon \u2014 it \"is studied by film classes\", says Laura Elliott, who played Miriam{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=197}} \u2013 is her character's strangulation by Bruno on the Magic Isle. \"[I]n one of the most unexpected, most aesthetically justified moments in film,\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=352}} the slow, almost graceful, murder is shown as a reflection in the victim's eyeglasses, which have been jarred loose from her head and dropped to the ground. The unusual angle was a more complex proposition than it seems. First Hitchcock got the exterior shots in Canoga Park, using both actors, then later he had Elliott alone report to a soundstage where there was a large concave reflector set on the floor. The camera was on one side of the reflector, Elliott was on the other, and Hitchcock directed Elliott to turn her back to the reflector and \"float backwards, all the way to the floor... like you were doing the limbo.\"{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=198}} The first six takes went badly\u2014Elliott thudded to the floor with several feet yet to go{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=452}}\u2014but on the seventh take, she floated smoothly all the way. Hitchcock's even-strained response: \"Cut. Next shot.\"{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=198}} Hitchcock then had the two elements \"ingenious[ly]\" double printed,{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=242}} yielding a shot of \"oddly appealing originality [with] a stark fusion of the grotesque and the beautiful.... The aestheticizing of the horror somehow enables the audience to contemplate more fully its reality.\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=352}}\n\nHitchcock was, above all, the master of great visual [[set piece (film)|setpieces]],{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=429}} and \"[p]erhaps the most memorable sequence in ''Strangers on a Train'' is the climactic fight on a berserk carousel.\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=347}} While Guy and Bruno fight, the ride runs out of control until it tears itself to pieces, flinging wooden horses into the crowd of screaming mothers and squealing children. \"The climactic carousel explosion was a marvel of miniatures and background projection, acting close-ups and other inserts, all of it seamlessly matched and blended under film editor [[William H. Ziegler]]'s eye.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=450}}\n\n{{blockquote|Hitchcock took a toy carousel and photographed it blown up by a small charge of explosives. This piece of film he then enlarged and projected onto a vast screen, positioning actors around and in front of it so that the effect is one of a mob of bystanders into which plaster horses and passengers are hurled in deadly chaos. It is one of the moments in Hitchcock's work that continues to bring gasps from every audience and applause from cinema students.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=348}}}}\n\nThe explosion is triggered by the attempts of a carnival man to stop the ride after crawling under the whirling carousel deck to get to the controls in the center. Although Hitchcock admitted to [[undercranking]] the shot (artificially accelerating the action),{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=66}} it was not a trick shot: the man actually had to crawl under the spinning ride, just inches from possible injury. \"Hitchcock told me that this scene was the most personally frightening moment for him in any of his films\", writes biographer [[Charlotte Chandler]]. \"The man who crawled under the out-of-control carousel was not an actor or a stuntman, but a carousel operator who volunteered for the job. 'If the man had raised his head even slightly\", Hitchcock said, \"it would have gone from being a suspense film into a horror film.\"{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=194}}\n\nThe final scene of the so-called American version of the film has Barbara and Anne Morton waiting for Guy to call on the telephone. Hitchcock wanted the phone in the foreground to dominate the shot, emphasizing the importance of the call, but the limited depth-of-field of contemporary motion picture lenses made it difficult to get both phone and women in focus. So Hitchcock had an oversized phone constructed and placed in the foreground.{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=197}} Anne reaches for the big phone, but actually answers a regular one: \"I did that on one take\", Hitchcock explained, \"by moving in on Anne so that the big phone went out of the frame as she reached for it. Then a grip put a normal-sized phone on the table, where she picked it up.\"{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=197}}\n\nPrincipal photography wrapped just before Christmas, and Hitchcock and Alma left for a vacation in Santa Cruz,{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=353}} then in late March 1951, on to St. Moritz, for a 25th anniversary European excursion.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=453}}\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[Dimitri Tiomkin]] was Jack Warner's choice to score ''Strangers on a Train''. While he had previous Hitchcock experience on ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and would go on to score two more consecutive Hitchcock films, the director and composer \"simply never developed much of a kinship\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=450}} and \"the Hitchcock films are not Tiomkin's best\".{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=450}}\n\nNevertheless\\, the score does pick up on the ubiquitous theme of ''doubles'' \u2014 often ''contrasting'' doubles \u2014 right from the opening title sequence: \"The first shot \u2014 two sets of male shoes, loud versus conservative, moving toward a train \u2014 carries a gruff bass motif set against Gershwin-like riffs, a two-part medley called \"Strangers\" and \"Walking\" that is never heard again.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=157}} The powerful music accurately underscores the visuals of that title sequence \u2014 the massive granite edifice of New York's Pennsylvania Station, standing in for Washington's Union Station\u2014because it was scored for an unusually large orchestra, including alto, tenor and baritone saxes, three clarinets, four horns, three pianos and a novachord.{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=156}}\n\nTiomkin's contrasting musical themes continued throughout the film, delineating two characters with substantial differences: \"For 'Guy's Theme', Tiomkin created a hesitant, passive idea, made-to-order music for Farley Granger's performance.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=157}} Bruno, who tells Guy on the train that he admires people \"who do things\", gets a more vigorous musical treatment from Tiomkin: \"Harmonic complexity defines the motifs associated with Bruno: rumbling bass, shocking clusters, and glassy string harmonics. These disturbing sounds, heard to superb effect in cues such as 'The Meeting,' 'Senator's Office,' and 'Jefferson Memorial,' are not just about Bruno, but about how he is perceived by those whose lives he crosses\u2014first Guy, then everyone in Guy's entourage.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=157}}\n\nBut perhaps the most memorable music in ''Strangers'' is the calliope music,{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=450}} heard first at the fairground and again, later, when Bruno is strangling Mrs. Cunningham at Senator Morton's soir\u00e9e, and experiences his unfortunate flashback and subsequent fainting spell. It was Hitchcock, not Tiomkin, whose idea brought the four evocative numbers{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=450}} \u2014 \"[[The Band Played On]]\", \"[[Carolina in the Morning]]\", \"[[Oh, You Beautiful Doll]]\", and \"[[Baby Face (1926 song)|Baby Face]]\" \u2014 to the soundtrack:<blockquote>In one of Hitchcock's most explicit operatic gestures, the characters at the fateful carnival sing the score, giving it full dimension as part of the drama. In a conventional movie, the tune would play in the background as a clever ironic backdrop. But Hitchcock takes music to another level. Miriam and the two boyfriends in her odd m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois bring \"The Band Played On\" to life by singing it on the merry-go-round, lustily and loudly... Grinning balefully on the horse behind them, Bruno then sings it himself, making it his motto. The band plays on through Bruno's stalking of his victim and during the murder itself, blaring from the front of the screen, then receding into the darkness as an eerie obbligato when the doomed Miriam enters the Tunnel of Love.{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=159}}</blockquote>\"The Band Played On\" makes its final reprise during Guy's and Bruno's fight on the merry-go-round, even itself shifting to a faster tempo and higher pitch when the policeman's bullet hits the ride operator and sends the carousel into its frenzied hyper-drive.\n\nCritic [[Jack Sullivan (literary scholar)|Jack Sullivan]] had kinder words for Tiomkin's score for ''Strangers'' than did [[Donald Spoto|biographer Spoto]]: \"[S]o seamlessly and inevitably does it fit the picture's design that it seems like an element of Hitchcock's storyboards\", he writes.{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=162}} It is a score that \"goes largely uncelebrated.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=162}}\n\n===Promotion and release===\nWith a release scheduled for early summer, the studio press agents swung into high gear early in 1951. Hitchcock, promotionally photographed many times over the years strangling various actresses and other women \u2014 some one-handed, others two \u2014 found himself in front of a camera with his fingers around the neck of a bust of daughter Patricia;{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=353}} the photo found its way into newspapers nationwide.{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=203}} He was also photographed adding the letter ''L'' to ''Strangers'' on the official studio poster for the film,{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=353}} thus changing the word to ''Stranglers''.\n\nOne studio press release gave rise to a myth that still lingers on today.<ref>Warner Bros. press release #HO9-1251, November 30, 1950</ref> Hitchcock and Patricia both were afraid of heights, and father offered daughter a hundred dollars to ride the [[Ferris wheel]] \u2014 only to order the power cut, leaving her in the dark at the very top of the ride. The press release embellished the tale, claiming he left her \"dangling in total darkness for an hour,\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=453}} only then allowing his \"trembling daughter\" to be lowered and released.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=453}} Although that account continues to be published in books to this day, \"it just wasn't true\", according to Patricia Hitchcock O'Connell.{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=202}} First of all, she was not up there alone: flanking her were the actors playing Miriam's two boyfriends \u2014 \"and I have a picture of us waving.\"{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=202}} \"This was good stuff for press agents paid to stir up thrills and it has been repeated in other books to bolster the idea of Hitchcock's sadism,\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=453}} but \"we were [only] up there two or three minutes at the outside.... My father wasn't ever sadistic. The only sadistic part was I never got the hundred dollars.\"{{sfn|Chandler|2006|p=202}}\n\n''Strangers on a Train'' previewed on March 5, 1951 at the [[Huntington Park, California|Huntington Park]] Theatre, with Alma, Jack Warner, Whitfield Cook and Barbara Keon in the Hitchcock party{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=353}} and it won a prize from the [[Screen Directors Guild]].{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=354}} It premiered in New York on July 3, marking the reopening of the extensively remodeled [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] as the Warner Theatre, and in a dozen cities around the country.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=354}} Hitchcock made personal appearances in most of them, and was often accompanied by his daughter.\n\nSome audience feedback arriving at Jack Warner's office condemned the film for its sordid story, while just as many others were favorable.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=354}} Of greater interest to Warner was the box office take, and the \"receipts soon told the true story: ''Strangers on a Train'' was a success, and Hitchcock was pronounced at the top of his form as master of the dark, melodramatic suspense thriller.\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=354}}\n\n==Themes and motifs==\nThe film includes a number of [[pun]]s and visual [[metaphor]]s that demonstrate a running motif of crisscross, double-crossing, and crossing one's double. Talking about the structure of the film, Hitchcock said to Truffaut, \"Isn't it a fascinating design? One could study it forever.\"<ref name=truff>[[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut|Truffaut, Fran\u00e7ois]] (1967). ''Hitchcock By Truffaut''. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|978-0-671-60429-5}}</ref>\n\nThe two characters, Guy and Bruno, can be viewed as [[doppelg\u00e4nger]]s. As with ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'', ''Strangers on a Train'' is one of many Hitchcock films to explore the [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] theme. The pair has what writer Peter Dellolio refers to as a \"dark symbiosis.\"<ref name=\"Dellolio\">{{cite journal| last=Dellolio | first=Peter | title=Hitchcock and Kafka: Expressionist Themes in Strangers on a Train | journal=Midwest Quarterly | number=3 | year=2004 | volume=45 | pages=240\u201355}}</ref> Bruno embodies Guy's dark desire to kill Miriam, a \"real-life incarnation of Guy's wish-fulfillment fantasy\".<ref name=\"Dellolio\"/>\n\n===Doubles===\nThe theme of ''doubles'' is \"the key element in the film's structure,\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=349}} and Hitchcock starts right off in his title sequence making this point: there are two taxicabs, two redcaps, two pairs of feet, two sets of train rails that cross twice. Once on the train, Bruno orders a pair of double drinks \u2014 \"The only kind of doubles I play\", he says charmingly. In Hitchcock's cameo he carries a [[double bass]].\n\n{{blockquote|There are two respectable and influential fathers, two women with eyeglasses, and two women at a party who delight in thinking up ways of committing the perfect crime. There are two sets of two detectives in two cities, two little boys at the two trips to the fairground, two old men at the carousel, two boyfriends accompanying the woman about to be murdered, and two Hitchcocks in the film.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=349}}}}\n\nHitchcock carries the theme into his editing, crosscutting between Guy and Bruno with words and gestures: one asks the time and the other, miles away, looks at his watch; one says in anger \"I could strangle her!\" and the other, far distant, makes a choking gesture.{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=349}}\n\nThis doubling has some precedent in the novel; but more of it was deliberately added by Hitchcock, \"dictated in rapid and inspired profusion to Czenzi Ormonde and Barbara Keon during the last days of script preparation.\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=349}} It undergirds the whole film because it finally serves to associate the world of light, order, and vitality with the world of darkness, chaos, lunacy and death.\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=350}}\n\nGuy and Bruno are in some ways doubles, but in many more ways, they are ''opposites''. The two sets of feet in the title sequence match each other in motion and in cutting, but they immediately establish the contrast between the two men: the first shoes \"showy, vulgar brown-and-white brogues; [the] second, plain, unadorned walking shoes.\"{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=172}} They also demonstrate Hitchcock's gift for deft visual storytelling: For most of the film, Bruno is the actor, Guy the reactor, and Hitchcock always shows Bruno's feet first, then Guy's. And since it is Guy's foot that taps Bruno's under the table, we know Bruno has not engineered the meeting.{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=172}}\n\nRoger Ebert wrote that \"it is this sense of two flawed characters \u2014 one evil, one weak, with an unstated sexual tension \u2014 that makes the movie intriguing and halfway plausible, and explains how Bruno could come so close to carrying out his plan.\"{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=428}}\n\n===Darkness\u2013light continuum===\nIt is those flaws that set up the real themes of ''Strangers.'' It was not enough for Hitchcock to construct merely a world of doubles \u2014 even contrasting doubles \u2014 in a strict polar-opposite structure; for Hitchcock, the good-and-evil, darkness-and-light poles \"didn't have to be mutually exclusive.\"{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=428}} Blurring the lines puts both Guy and Bruno on a good-evil continuum, and the infinite shades of gray in between, became Hitchcock's canvas for telling the story and painting his characters.\n\nAt first glance, Guy represents the ordered life where people stick to rules, while Bruno comes from the world of chaos,{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=}} where they get thrown out of multiple colleges for drinking and gambling. Yet both men, like so many of Hitchcock's protagonists, are insecure and uncertain of their identity. Guy is suspended between tennis and politics, between his tramp wife and his senator's daughter, and Bruno is seeking desperately to establish an identity through violent, ''outr\u00e9'' actions and flamboyance (shoes, lobster-patterned tie, name proclaimed to the world on his tiepin).\"{{sfn|Wood|2004|pp=172\u201373}}\n\nBruno tells Guy early on that he admires him: \"I certainly admire people who do things\", he says. \"Me, I never do anything important.\" Yet as Bruno describes his \"theories\" over lunch, \"Guy responds to Bruno \u2014 we see it in his face, at once amused and tense. To the man committed to a career in politics, Bruno represents a tempting overthrow of all responsibility.\"{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=172}} And at this point the blurring of good and evil accelerates: Guy fails to repudiate Bruno's suggestive statement about murdering Miriam (\"What's a life or two, Guy? Some people are better off dead.\") with any force or conviction. \"When Bruno openly suggests he would like to kill his wife, he merely grins and says 'That's a morbid thought,' but we sense the tension that underlies it.\"{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=172}} It ratchets up a notch when Guy leaves Bruno's compartment and \"forgets\" his cigarette lighter. \"He is leaving in Bruno's keeping his link with Anne, his possibility of climbing into the ordered existence to which he aspires.... Guy, then, in a sense connives at the murder of his wife, and the enigmatic link between him and Bruno becomes clear.{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=173}}\n\n===Light and dark onscreen===\nHaving given his characters overlapping qualities of good and evil, Hitchcock then rendered them on the screen according to a very strict template, with which he stuck to a remarkable degree. Ebert wrote:\n\n{{blockquote|Hitchcock was a classical technician in terms of controlling his visuals, and his use of screen space underlined the tension in ways the audience isn't always aware of. He always used the convention that the left side of the screen is for evil and/or weaker characters, while the right is for characters who are either good or temporarily dominant.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=430}}}}\n\nNowhere is this more evident than the scene where Guy arrives home at his D.C. apartment to find Bruno lurking across the street; Bruno killed Miriam that evening in Metcalf, and has her glasses to give to Guy almost as a \"receipt\" that he has executed ''his'' part of their \"deal\". \"On one side of the street, [are] stately respectable houses; towering in the background, on the right of the screen, the floodlit dome of the U.S. Capitol, the life to which Guy aspires, the world of light and order.\"{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=175}} Bruno tells Guy what he has done and gives him the glasses. \"You're a free man now\", he says, just as a police car drives up, looking for the husband of a certain recent murder victim. Guy nervously steps into the shadows with Bruno, literally behind the bars of an iron fence; \"You've got me acting like I'm a criminal\", he says. \"The scene gives a beautifully exact symbolic expression to Guy's relationship with Bruno and what he stands for.\"{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=175}}\n\nHitchcock continues the interplay of light and dark throughout the film: Guy's bright, light tennis attire, versus \"the gothic gloominess of [Bruno's] Arlington mansion\";{{sfn|Spoto|1983|p=349}} the crosscutting between his game in the sunshine at Forest Hills while Bruno's arm stretches into the dark and debris of the storm drain trying to fish out the cigarette lighter;{{sfn|Wood|2004|p=180}} even a single image where \"Walker is photographed in one visually stunning shot as a malignant stain on the purity of the white-marble Jefferson Memorial, as a blot on the order of things.\"{{sfn|Spoto|1983|pp=349\u201350}}\n\n===Political subtext===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{One source|date=June 2022}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=June 2022}}\n}}\nAlthough its first rumblings came in 1947 with the trial and conviction of the [[Hollywood blacklist|\"Hollywood Ten,\"]] the so-called [[McCarthyism|Red Scare]] was gathering steam in 1950, with the espionage-related arrests of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] and the trial of [[Alger Hiss]]. These events were the background to their work, while Hitchcock, Cook, Ormonde and Keon were preparing the script for ''Strangers'', and film scholar Robert L. Carringer has written of a political subtext to the film.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=442}} Treatment writer Cook used Guy to make the film \"a parable quietly defiant of the [[Cold War]] hysteria sweeping America.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=442}}\n\n{{blockquote|That hysteria was targeting homosexuals along with [[Communist]]s as enemies of the state.... The [[U.S. Senate]] was busy investigating the suspicion that 'moral perverts' in the government were also undermining national security \u2014 going so far as to commission a study, ''Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government''.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=443}}}}\n\nCarringer has argued that the film was crucially shaped by the Congressional inquiries, making Guy the stand-in for victims of the [[homophobia|homophobic]] climate.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=443}} \"To all appearances Guy is the all-American stereotype, an athlete, unassuming despite his fame, conservatively dressed,\" wrote Carringer; he is \"a man of indeterminate sexual identity found in circumstances making him vulnerable to being compromised.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=443}} Hitchcock, who had drawn gay characters so sharply yet subtly in ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' in 1948, \"drafted the left-leaning Cook... expressly because he was comfortable with sexually ambiguous characters.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=442}}\n\n===Differences from the novel===\nEven before sewing up the rights for the novel, Hitchcock's mind was whirling with ideas about how to adapt it for the screen. He narrowed the geographic scope to the [[Northeast corridor]], between Washington, D.C. and New York \u2014 the novel ranged through the southwest and Florida, among other locales.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=443}} The scripting team added the tennis match \u2014 and the crosscutting with Bruno's storm drain travails in Metcalf \u2014 added the cigarette lighter, the Tunnel of Love, Miriam's eyeglasses; in fact, the amusement park is only a brief setting in the novel.{{sfn|McGilligan|2004|p=443}}\n\nHitchcock's biggest changes were in his two lead characters:\n\nThe character called Bruno Antony in the film is called Charles Anthony Bruno in the book.<ref name=novel>[[Patricia Highsmith|Highsmith, Patricia]] (2001).

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised it, writing: \"Performance-wise, the cast comes through strongly. Granger is excellent as the harassed young man innocently involved in murder.

Perhaps there will be those in the audience who will likewise be terrified by the villain's darkly menacing warnings and by Mr. Hitchcock's sleekly melodramatic tricks. ...
