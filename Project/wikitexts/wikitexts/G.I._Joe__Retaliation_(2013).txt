Joe]]'' toy, comic, and media franchise. The second film in the [[G.I. Joe (film series)|''G.I. Joe'' film series]], it follows 2009's ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]''. Directed by [[Jon M. Chu]] and written by [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] with [[Lee Byung-hun]], [[Ray Park]], [[Jonathan Pryce]], [[Arnold Vosloo]], and [[Channing Tatum]] reprising their roles from the first film, while [[Luke Bracey]] and [[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]] take over the role of [[Cobra Commander]], replacing [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], and [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[D. J. Cotrona]], [[Adrianne Palicki]], [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] and [[\u00c9lodie Yung|Elodie Yung]] round out the principal cast.\n\nIn the film, with [[Cobra Command|Cobra]] operative [[Zartan]] still impersonating the [[President of the United States]], the terrorist organization is able to frame the Joes as traitors, and have them nearly annihilated in an airstrike. Cobra Commander places world leaders under Cobra's control, and gains access to their advanced warheads. Outnumbered and outgunned, the surviving Joes form a plan with original G.I. Joe, [[General Joseph Colton]], to overthrow Cobra Commander and his allies.\n\nOriginally slated for release in June 2012, the film was delayed in order to convert to [[3D film|3D]] and boost interest in international markets. It was released in North America on March 28, 2013. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $375 million worldwide against a budget of $130\u2013155 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\n[[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]] leads the [[G.I. Joe Team]] to the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] to find a North Korean defector. They assign another mission to steal nuclear warheads from Pakistan after the death of [[President of Pakistan|its President]] during a civil war. Deeming them as traitors, [[Zartan]], still impersonating the [[President of the United States]], calls an airstrike to kill Duke and the other Joes. Heavy machine gunner [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]], rookie sniper [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]], and counterintelligence officer [[Lady Jaye]] survive the attack by diving into a well, and they return to the United States to contact [[General Joseph Colton]], who provides them with weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Storm Shadow (G.I. Joe)|Storm Shadow]], who survived the Arctic base's destruction,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]'' (2009)}} and demolitions expert [[Firefly (G.I. Joe)|Firefly]] rescue [[Cobra Commander]] from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany, leaving [[Destro]] behind. Storm Shadow is injured and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. The Blind Master, leader of the [[Arashikage]] Clan, sends [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]] and his apprentice [[Jinx (G.I. Joe)|Jinx]], to capture Storm Shadow, allowing him to answer the murder of his uncle, the [[Hard Master]]. Before Storm Shadow was falsely-accused, he and Snake Eyes grew up together and were considered friends, but this relationship deteriorated when his \"friends\" did not trust him to not be a murderer, a detail that he never forgot, even after they cleared his name and somewhat uncomfortably called a truce in order to work together.\n\nAfter Zartan announces that Cobra will become the premier U.S. special forces team, replacing G.I. Joe, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President. At a presidential fundraiser, she steals a sample of the President's DNA, confirming that he is Zartan. They escape after a confrontation with Firefly and [[Zandar]], the head of the [[U.S. Secret Service]]'s Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra.\n\nSnake Eyes and Jinx locate and capture Storm Shadow after a battle with some ninjas loyal to Storm Shadow and take him back to [[Tokyo]], where Storm Shadow proclaims that he did not kill the Hard Master and proves it by fighting Snake Eyes with the weapon that killed the Hard Master, which breaks as it isn't Arashikage steel. The Blind Master deduces that Zartan was the one that murdered the Hard Master and framed Storm Shadow for it, who joined Cobra to bring it down from the inside. Exonerated, Storm Shadow accompanies Snake Eyes and Jinx, his cousin, as they join the Joes' efforts to stop Cobra and avenge the Hard Master.\n\nZartan invites the world leaders to a summit at [[Fort Sumter]], where he blackmails them into disabling their [[nuclear arsenal]]s, and reveals that he has created Project Zeus: seven orbital [[kinetic bombardment]] weapons of mass destruction at his command. To prove his superiority, he destroys Central London and activates the remaining weapons, offering to disarm them if the countries submit to Cobra. Storm Shadow betrays Cobra Commander and starts a fight, revealing Cobra's deception to the world leaders. Colton kills Zandar and rescues the real President with Lady Jaye, while Storm Shadow kills Zartan. While Snake Eyes, Jinx, and Flint fight Cobra's soldiers, Cobra Commander instructs Firefly to protect the launch device, and escapes by helicopter. Roadblock overpowers Firefly and destroys the orbital weapons. Storm Shadow leaves after avenging his uncle.\n\nAt the White House ceremony, the real President addresses the nation and commemorates the Joes, who were awarded by Colton: Roadblock, Snake Eyes, Jinx, Flint, and Lady Jaye. Colton presents Roadblock with an [[M1911 pistol]] that belonged to General [[George S. Patton]]; to use it to find Cobra Commander. Roadblock proudly raises the weapon and fires a single shot in honor of his fallen comrades, vowing to avenge them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Marvin F.
