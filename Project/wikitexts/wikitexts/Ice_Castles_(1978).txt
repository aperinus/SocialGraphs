It is the story of Lexie Winston, a young [[Figure skating|figure skater]], and her rise and fall from super stardom. Tragedy strikes when, following a freak accident, Lexie loses her [[Visual perception|sight]], leaving her to hide away in the privacy of her own despair. She eventually perseveres and begins competing in figure skating again.\n\nThe work was filmed on location in [[Colorado]] and [[Minnesota]]. Its theme song \"[[Through the Eyes of Love]]\", performed by [[Melissa Manchester]], was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[52nd Academy Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Arnold |first= Christine |title= This Year's Melissa Not the Same Old Song and Dance |work= [[The Miami Herald]] |date= November 15, 1987 |page= 1K |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=NewsBank&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB368609F1E04EF&p_docnum=24&p_queryname=1 |access-date= October 7, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Ice Castles (2010 film)|remake]], also directed by Wrye, was released direct to video in 2010.\n\n==Plot summary==\nAlexis \"Lexie\" Winston is a sixteen-year-old girl from [[Waverly, Iowa|Waverly]], [[Iowa]], who dreams of becoming a champion figure skater. Her boyfriend, Nick Peterson, dreams of being a hockey player.\n\nCoached by a family friend and former skater, Lexie enters a regional championship over her father's protests. There she is discovered by an elite coach, who sees her potential despite her lack of training and her relatively advanced age. Over her father's objections, Lexie moves from Waverly to [[Colorado Springs]] to train at the legendary [[Broadmoor World Arena (1938)|Broadmoor World Arena]]. She becomes unpopular among her fellow trainees because of the attention lavished on her natural talent and the publicity she receives.\n\nLexie qualifies for the senior championship level, her life changing drastically in the process. She becomes a star, alienates her boyfriend, and begins dating a grown man, television broadcaster Brian. Becoming uncomfortable with the direction her life is taking, she leaves a sponsorship party and heads to a nearby outdoor skating rink. Her coach and the partygoers watch through the windows as she skates. She attempts a difficult triple jump but lands off the ice onto a set of tables and chairs chained together near the edge of the rink. Lexie suffers a serious [[traumatic head injury|head injury]], a blood clot in her brain robbing her of her eyesight and leaving her able to see only light and blurry shapes. The doctor is uncertain if her injury will be permanent.\n\nLexie returns home and becomes a recluse. Nick, who still resents her affair with Brian, demands that she get out of the house and back onto the ice.  Despite their mutual resentment and Lexie's depression, they work through their estrangement and rediscover their love for each other. With help from Nick, her father Marcus, and original coach Beulah, Lexie begins to believe she can still fulfill her dreams.  Though virtually blind, she can still see the boards at the edge of the rink, and so learns how to compensate for her disability.\n\nShe enrolls in the sectional championship and presents a flawless program that provokes a [[standing ovation]] from the audience. Her disability, however, is revealed when she trips over roses thrown onto the ice by adoring fans. Nick rushes to her side and says, \"We forgot about the flowers,\" as the crowd realizes that Lexie  has not recovered from her injuries but rather risen above them.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Lynn-Holly Johnson]] as Alexis \"Lexie\" Winston\n* [[Robby Benson]] as Nick Peterson\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Beulah Smith\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Marcus Winston\n* [[Jennifer Warren]] as Deborah Mackland\n* [[David Huffman]] as Brian Dockett\n* Sydney Blake as Sandy\n* Craig T.

I don't deny the bravery of the characters being portrayed&nbsp;\u2013 I just object to the emotional bankruptcy of the people making the movies ... One of the melancholy aspects of ''Ice Castles'' is the quality of talent that's been brought to such an unhappy enterprise. Lynn-Holly Johnson, who plays the figure skater, is an appealing young woman who actually happens to be a good skater who can act. Robby Benson, as her boy friend, is always an engaging performer ... The supporting cast includes the irreplaceable Colleen Dewhurst ... There's also a brief role (as a hard-boiled coach) for the fascinating actress Jennifer Warren, who was electrifying in ''[[Night Moves (1975 film)|Night Moves]]'' and never seems to get the roles she deserves. They all act well together, and the direction by Donald Wrye tries to get beneath surfaces, to show plausible people in actual situations, to give some notion of the pressures on young athletes. The girl's small town is colorfully painted, the family's home life is drawn in a nice offbeat way, and the details of competitive ice-skating are worked in casually.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ice-castles-1979 |author= Ebert, Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |date= January 29, 1979 |title= Ice Castles |publisher= www.rogerebert.com |access-date= October 7, 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nReviewer Austin Kennedy also gave a lukewarm review, though praised the acting as \"the better part of this movie.
