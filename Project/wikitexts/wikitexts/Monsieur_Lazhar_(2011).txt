Bachir Lazhar, a recent Algerian immigrant, then offers his services to replace her, claiming to have taught in his home country. Desperate to fill the position, the principal, Mme Vaillancourt, takes him at his word and gives him the job. He gets to know his students despite both the evident [[culture gap]] and his difficulty adapting to the school system's constraints.\n\nAs the children try to move on from their former teacher's suicide, nobody at the school is aware of Bachir's painful past, or his precarious status as a [[Canadian immigration and refugee law|refugee]]. His wife, who was a teacher and writer, died along with the couple's daughter and son in an arson attack. The murderers were angered by her last book, in which she pointed a finger at those responsible for the country's reconciliation, which had led to the liberation of many perpetrators of serious crimes. The film goes on to explore Bachir's relationships with the students and faculty, and how the students come to grips with their former teacher's suicide. One student, Alice, writes an assignment on the death of their teacher, revealing the deep pain and confusion felt by each of the students.\n\nBachir eventually comes to be loved and respected by the students he is teaching, but the teacher's death still haunts the students. During a school dance, a student named Simon is found to have a photo of his former teacher. It is revealed that he tried to get her into trouble after she tried to help him through his family struggles. Bachir eventually gets the students to open up about the death, especially Simon, who is blamed and blames himself for causing the teacher's suicide. Eventually, some parents discover that Bachir has no [[Teaching qualification#Canada|teaching qualification]]; previously, he had run a restaurant. He is then fired from the school. He asks the principal to be able to teach one more day, convincing her by noting that the old teacher never got to say goodbye to her students.\n\nOn his last day, Bachir has his students correct a fable he wrote which is a metaphor of his tragic past life in Algeria and the loss of his family in a fire. Before he leaves, one of his students, Alice (whom he professed to be his favourite to her mother) gives him a tearful hug goodbye.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Fellag|Mohamed Sa\u00efd Fellag]] as Bachir Lazhar\n* [[Sophie N\u00e9lisse]] as Alice L'\u00c9cuyer\n* [[\u00c9milien N\u00e9ron]] as Simon Gagnon\n* [[Danielle Proulx]] as Mrs. Vaillancourt\n* [[Brigitte Poupart]] as Claire Lajoie\n* Jules Philip as Gaston\n* Daniel Gadouas as Mr. Gilbert Danis\n* Louis Champagne as Concierge\n* Seddik Benslimane as Abdelmalek\n* Marie-\u00c8ve Beauregard as Marie-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique\n* Andr\u00e9 Robitaille as Commissioner\n* Francine Ruel as Mrs. Dumas\n* Sophie Sanscartier as Audr\u00e9e\n* [[\u00c9velyne de la Cheneli\u00e8re]] as Alice's mother\n* Vincent Millard as Victor\n* Louis-David Leblanc as Boris\n* Nicole-Sylvie Lagrande as Psychologist\n* Gabriel Verdier as Jordan\n* Marie Charlebois as Prosecutor\n* Marianne Soucy-Lord as Shanel\n* [[St\u00e9phane Demers]] as Marie-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique's father\n* Nathalie Costa as Marie-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique's mother\n* H\u00e9l\u00e9na Lalibert\u00e9 as Martine Lachance\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mohamed Fellag (cropped).JPG|250px|thumb|[[Fellag]] at the Geneva premiere]] \nThe source material ''Bachir Lazhar'' is a one-character play,<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=[[The Edmonton Journal]] | url=https://edmontonjournal.com/health/Bashir+Lazhar+powerful+portrait+immigrant+experience/5513471/story.html | title=Bashir Lazhar a powerful portrait of immigrant experience | date=6 October 2011 | access-date=15 December 2011 | archive-date=11 January 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111125907/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/health/Bashir+Lazhar+powerful+portrait+immigrant+experience/5513471/story.html | url-status=live }}</ref> making it a challenge to adapt for the screen.
