Its title refers to the [[spacecraft]] central to the plot with ''A.E.'' meaning \"After Earth\". The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe film tells the story of a young man who receives a mission to save humanity and protect the giant ship that can create a new planet, after a hostile alien species destroyed Earth. Along the way, he joins up with a ship's crew and their captain, who help him find the ship before the aliens can destroy it.\n\nThe third and final project produced by [[Fox Animation Studios]], the film was theatrically released on June 16, 2000 by [[20th Century Fox]] in the United States. The film received mixed reviews from critics and made a loss at the box office.<ref name=\"BOM\" /><ref name=BloombergDM2Producer /><ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisinsider.com/movie-flops-over-the-years-2018-2#1978-sextette-1|title=The biggest box office flop from the year you were born|author=Gabbi Shaw|work=Insider |date=February 27, 2017 |access-date=June 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn the year 3028, a groundbreaking scientific project known as \"The Titan Project\" incurs the wrath of the Drej, a hostile race of aliens with bodies of pure [[energy]], who fear that it will allow humans to challenge them. Determined to wipe out humanity, the Drej destroy Earth in a massive attack, forcing the surviving humans to evacuate and flee into space. During the evacuation of Earth, Professor Sam Tucker\u2014head researcher on the Titan Project\u2014leaves his young son Cale in the care of his alien friend Tek as he flees Earth in the spaceship ''Titan''. Before he leaves, he gives Cale a gold ring, promising him that there will be hope for humanity as long as he wears it.\n\nFifteen years later, with humanity on the verge of extinction following the destruction of their planet, a jaded and cynical Cale works in the salvage yard of space station Tau 14. Ex-military officer Joseph Korso, a former friend and confidant of Cale's father, tracks Cale down and reveals that the location of the ''Titan'' is encoded in his ring, allowing him to find the long-missing ship by following a holographic map in the palm of his hand. Korso invites Cale to join the crew of his spaceship ''Valkyrie'' as they seek the ''Titan''. Accepting Korso's offer, Cale befriends Korso's pilot Akima Kunimoto and his three alien crew members: first mate Preed, weapons officer Stith, and scientist Gune.\n\t\nAfter Cale and Korso escape Tau 14 with the Drej in pursuit, Cale's map leads the crew of the ''Valkyrie'' to the planet Sesharrim, where the alien Gaoul help them interpret the map, revealing that the ''Titan'' is hidden in the Andali [[Nebula]]. On Sesharrim, Drej fighters abduct Cale and Akima and copy the map. Akima is rescued by the crew after being jettisoned by the Drej Queen, while Cale escapes the Drej mothership in a stolen fighter and makes his way back to the ''Valkyrie''. The map changes to reveal the ''Titan''{{'}}s hiding place within the Andali Nebula: the ice rings of Tigrin, a labyrinthine asteroid field.\n\nWhile resupplying at human [[space station]] New [[Bangkok]], Cale and Akima discover that Korso and Preed are planning to sell the ''Titan''{{'}}s location to the Drej. Cale and Akima manage to escape the ''Valkyrie'', but are left stranded on New Bangkok when Korso and the remaining crew leave for the ''Titan''. Determined to beat Korso to the ''Titan'', they fix up the dilapidated spaceship ''Phoenix''.\n\nCale and Akima navigate the ice rings of Tigrin and dock with the ''Titan'' before the ''Valkyrie'' arrives. They discover DNA of animals onboard and a pre-recorded holographic message left by Cale's father explaining that the ship was designed to create planets, but the ship's power cells were drained in the escape from Earth, and lack the energy necessary to create a planet. After Korso and Preed arrive, Preed reveals that he has betrayed Korso and made his own deal with the Drej. Korso kills Preed by snapping his neck, and Korso seemingly falls to his death in a fight with Cale.\n\nAs the Drej attack the ''Titan'', Cale and Akima fight them off with the help of Stith and Gune. During the battle, Cale realizes that he may be able to recharge the ''Titan'' by converting its systems to use the Drej's bodies of pure energy, but a circuit breaker stalls before he can complete the process. Korso, who survived his fall, has a change of heart after overhearing Cale's plan and sacrifices his life to repair the circuit breaker, while Cale triggers the ''Titan''{{'}}s systems, killing the Drej as the ''Titan'' absorbs their mothership.\n\nCale and Akima embrace in the rain on the newly created human homeworld, and ships filled with human colonists arrive to start a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Cale Tucker, a yard-salvager who carries the map to ''Titan'' in his ring.\n** [[Alex D.

Mechanic had no scripts for Fox Animation Studios to work on and was faced with the choice of laying off the animation staff unless they took ''Titan A.E.'' Despite their inexperience with the science fiction genre, Bluth and Goldman took the script regardless.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYExFX3X19g  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/HYExFX3X19g |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=DON BLUTH at AnimationNation.com Special Event 2010 |date=May 21, 2014 |publisher=AnimationNation |access-date=December 18, 2015 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nFox Animation Studios was given a production budget of $75 million and 19 months to make the film. Unlike Bluth and Goldman's previous films, the animation in ''Titan A.E.'' is predominantly computer-generated while the main characters and several backgrounds were traditionally animated. Many of the scenes were enacted by the animation staff using handbuilt props before being captured by a computer. Many scenes and backgrounds were painted by concept artist Paul Cheng, who had worked on ''Anastasia'' and its direct-to-video spin-off ''[[Bartok the Magnificent]]'' (1999).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paulcheng-pc.com/traditional/traditional-02b-TitanAe.html |title=Paul Cheng - Titan A.E. |publisher=Paul Cheng.com |access-date=December 18, 2015}}</ref> Much like ''Anastasia'', the storytelling and tone in ''Titan A.E.'' is much darker and edgier than Bluth and Goldman's previous films with the film being regularly compared to Japanese [[anime]]. Although Bluth and Goldman denied any influence by anime, they have acknowledged the comparison.<ref name=\"awn.com\"/>\n\nDuring production of ''Titan A.E.'', Fox Animation Studios suffered a number of cutbacks which ultimately led to its closure in 2000. Over 300 animation staff were laid off from the studio in 1999 and as a result, much of the film's animation was outsourced to a number of independent companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2000/06/27/fox-animation-studios-closes-its-doors |title=Fox Animation Studios Closes Its Doors |last=Linder |first=Brian |date=June 27, 2000 |publisher=IGN |access-date=December 18, 2015}}</ref> Several scenes were contracted to David Paul Dozoretz's POVDE group; the \"Wake Angels\" scene was animated by Reality Check Studios (their first feature film work)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalanimators.com/HTM/Features/RealityCheck_TitanAE.htm|title=Reality Check Studios Tapped for Tricky Titan AE Sequence}}</ref> while the film's \"Genesis\" scene was animated by [[Blue Sky Studios]], who would later go on to making 20th Century Fox's ''[[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]]'' and ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' film franchises as well as ''[[Horton Hears a Who!
