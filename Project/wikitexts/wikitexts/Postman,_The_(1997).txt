The screenplay was written by [[Eric Roth]] and [[Brian Helgeland]], based on [[David Brin]]'s 1985 [[The Postman|book of the same name]]. The film also features [[Will Patton]], [[Larenz Tate]], [[Olivia Williams]], [[James Russo]], and [[Tom Petty]].\n\nIt is set in a [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] and neo-Western version of the disestablished United States in the [[List of stories set in a future now past|then near-future]] year of 2013, sixteen-plus years after unspecified apocalyptic events, followed by plagues, left a huge impact on human civilization and erased most technology. Like the book, the film follows the story of a nomadic drifter (Costner) who stumbles across the uniform of an old [[United States Postal Service]] [[mail carrier]], and unwittingly inspires hope through an empty promise of a \"Restored United States of America\" and starts his path to become a national hero.\n\nReleased on [[Christmas]] of 1997 by [[Warner Bros.]], ''The Postman'' was panned by critics, who criticized the performances, screenplay, direction, and long runtime. Costner's decision to cast himself in the film was also criticized. The film was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing a total of $20 million worldwide against a budget of $80 million. It was nominated for three [[Saturn Awards]] but won all five of its [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nominations including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTE: The plot summary is currently 563 words long, which is within the maximum permitted length of 400 to 700 words. See \"Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary\" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines.-->\nIn 2013, an unnamed nomad wanders the scattered communities of the [[Utah]] flatlands, trading performances of long forgotten [[Shakespeare]]an plays for food and water. At one town, the nomad is forced at gunpoint into the ranks of the Holnists, a [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] militia, and is branded on his shoulder with their symbol, a figure 8. The Holnists, under their leader, General Bethlehem, are the de facto authority in the area, collecting tribute and recruits from local towns. When the nomad escapes, he takes refuge in a long-deceased postman's mail vehicle.\n\nWith the postman's uniform and mail bag, he arrives in the settlement of Pineview claiming to be from the newly restored U.S. government. He convinces Pineview's leader, Sheriff Briscoe, to let him in by showing a letter addressed to elderly villager Irene March. The Postman inspires a teenager named Ford Lincoln Mercury, who asks to be sworn in as a member of the postal service and even helps him set up a post office for the town. The Postman also meets spouses Abby and Michael, fulfilling their clinical request to impregnate her. When the Postman leaves for the town of Benning, he carries a pile of mail left at the post office door by the townspeople.\n\nDuring a raid of Pineview, General Bethlehem learns of the Postman\u2019s tales of a restored government in [[Minneapolis]] and becomes afraid of losing power if word spreads. He has the post office burned to the ground, kills Michael and Briscoe, abducts Abby, and raids Benning looking for the Postman. The Postman surrenders, but Abby saves him from execution, and the two escape into the surrounding mountains. A pregnant Abby and an injured Postman ride out the winter in an abandoned cabin. When spring arrives, they leave and run into a girl, who claims to be a postal carrier. She reveals that Mercury has kept the postal service alive by recruiting other carriers and building more post offices. They have established communications with other settlements, creating a quasi-society and inadvertently spreading hope.\n\nBethlehem continues to hunt and capture postal carriers, all of whom are executed and displayed publicly. Feeling responsible, the Postman orders the service to disband and writes a letter to the militia revealing the truth. However, Bethlehem learns to his dismay that the Postman's example has spread farther than he could have anticipated when his men capture a carrier from [[California]], and he redoubles his efforts to find the Postman. The Postman and Abby, closely followed by young carriers Eddie, Ponytail, and Billy, travel to Bridge City. When Bethlehem's scouts catch up, the mayor helps the Postman escape on a cable car and urges him to find others willing to resist Bethlehem. Before leaving, he and Abby reciprocate their feelings and fall in love.\n\nIn a recitation of [[King Henry V of England|King Henry V's]] speech prior to the [[Siege of Harfleur]], the Postman rallies himself and his followers to war. The mounted Carriers and Holnists meet across a field. Not wanting any more carnage, the Postman instead challenges Bethlehem to a personal hand-to-hand duel, with their troops as witnesses. The Postman wins the fight but spares Bethlehem's life to maintain morale. Bethlehem tries to shoot the Postman in the back with his [[revolver]], but is shot dead by his own second-in-command, Col. Getty. Getty then surrenders, and the rest of the Holnists follow his lead.\n\nThirty years later, the Postman's grown daughter, accompanied by other public figures and servicemen (including postal workers), speaks at a ceremony unveiling a bronze statue by territorial waters in St. Rose, Oregon in tribute to her father, who has recently died (1973\u20132043). Her speech, along with the fact that all the attendees are wearing modern clothing and using technology, reveal that the Postman and his mail carriers' actions have helped rebuild the United States.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as The Postman\n* [[Will Patton]] as General Bethlehem\n* [[Larenz Tate]] as Ford Lincoln Mercury\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Abby\n* [[James Russo]] as Captain Idaho\n* [[Tom Petty]] as Bridge City Mayor\n* [[Daniel von Bargen]] as Pineview Sheriff Briscoe\n* [[Scott Bairstow]] as Luke\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Bandit 20\n* [[Roberta Maxwell]] as Irene March\n* [[Joe Santos]] as Colonel Getty\n* [[Ron McLarty]] as Old George\n* [[Brian Anthony Wilson]] as Woody\n* [[Peggy Lipton]] as Ellen March\n* [[Rex Linn]] as Mercer\n* [[Shawn Hatosy]] as Billy\n* [[Ryan Hurst]] as Eddie March\n* [[Charles Esten]] as Michael\n* [[Ty O'Neal]] as Drew\n* [[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]] as Larry\n* [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] as Hope, Postman's Daughter (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nOn his personal website, author [[David Brin]] reveals that while [[Film studio|studios]] were bidding for ''The Postman'', his wife decided during a screening of ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' that [[Kevin Costner]] should portray ''The Postman''.<ref name=Brin-Postman>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbrin.com/postmanmovie.html |title=The Postman: the Movie | first = David | last = Brin | work = Worlds of David Brin | publisher=DavidBrin.com |date=December 1998 |access-date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> Brin agreed that the emotions evoked by ''Field of Dreams'' matched the message he intended to deliver with his novel.

Brin said that, unlike typical post-apocalyptic movies that satisfy \"little-boy wish fantasies about running amok in a world without rules\", the intended moral of ''The Postman'' is that \"if we lost our civilization, we'd all come to realize how much we missed it, and would realize what a miracle it is simply to get your mail every day.\"<ref name=Metro>{{Citation |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.06.97/cover/brin2-9706.html |title=Brin on science fiction, society and Kevin Costner |first=Zack |last=Stentz |magazine=Metro |date=June 12, 1997 |access-date=August 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\n''The Postman'' was filmed in [[Metaline Falls, Washington|Metaline Falls]] and [[Fidalgo Island]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]; [[Deschutes County, Oregon|central Oregon]]; and southern [[Arizona]] around [[Amado, Arizona|Tucson]] and [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]].
