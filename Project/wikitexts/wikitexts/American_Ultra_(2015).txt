The story is about a [[Drug culture|stoner]] who discovers he was part of a secret government program and is a [[sleeper agent]].\n\nIt was released on August 21, 2015, by [[Lionsgate]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the premise and cast, but criticism that it \"fails to live up to its potential\".<ref name=\"Brown\" />\nThe film underperformed at the box office, earning a worldwide total of $30.3 million against a production budget of $28 million.\n\n==Plot==\nMike Howell is a [[Drug culture|stoner]] who lives in the sleepy town of Liman, [[West Virginia]], where he works as a [[convenience store]] clerk. He is planning to [[marriage in the United States|propose]] to his longtime girlfriend, Phoebe Larson, on a trip to [[Hawaii]]. He is unable to board the plane, as he suffers from intense [[panic attack]]s anytime he tries to leave town. He does not understand why Phoebe puts up with him.\n\nIn [[Langley, Virginia]], CIA Agent Victoria Lasseter receives a coded warning that Mike, the sole survivor of her \"Wiseman\" [[Project MKUltra|Ultra program]], is to be eliminated by her rival, Adrian Yates, and his similar \"Toughguy\" agents. Feeling a duty to protect Mike, Lasseter travels to Liman and \"activates\" Mike through a series of code words. Mike fails to understand their significance, and she leaves in resigned frustration.\n\nMike finds two Toughguys interfering with his car and is attacked, but his training activates and he kills them using a spoon. He calls Phoebe, who reaches him just as Sheriff Watts arrives. Yates sends two Toughguy operatives, Laugher and Crane, to kill Mike and Phoebe at the sheriff station, but they evade Laugher and kill Crane before escaping to the home of Mike's drug dealer Rose. Mike becomes unnerved by an array of facts he suddenly knows regarding military strategy. He also realizes he has [[Memory erasure|very little memory]] prior to living in the town with Phoebe, wondering aloud why he never questioned this before.\n\nYates quarantines the town, and puts Lasseter and Mike's pictures on the local news. Lasseter convinces her former assistant, Petey Douglas, to air drop her a weapon using a drone. Yates finds out and threatens to charge Petey with treason. Yates then attacks Rose's house with two Toughguys using a lethal gas. The agents kill Rose and his two guards, Big Harold and Quinzin, before Mike and Phoebe kill the attackers and she rescues Mike from the gas, which she is familiar with. When pressed for answers on her knowledge of the gas, Phoebe reluctantly reveals she was a CIA agent assigned to be Mike's [[Handler (espionage)|handler]], leaving him heartbroken.\n\nLaugher ambushes the duo and captures Phoebe. Mike is rescued by Lasseter and insists on returning to his house. She tells him that he volunteered for Wiseman due to his criminal record and subsequently had his [[Mindwipe|memories erased]]. He also learns that Phoebe was to get him settled in Liman and then leave, but chose to stay because she genuinely fell in love. Lasseter explains that his panic attacks, including his fear of leaving town, were implanted to keep him safe.\n\nYates' army liaison, Otis, joins a Toughguy to attack Mike's house. Mike and Lasseter kill them, prompting Yates to order a drone strike on the entire block. Petey calls off the drone strike at the last minute and then secretly reports the situation to Yates' superior, Raymond Krueger.\n\nMike contacts Yates and arranges to exchange himself for Phoebe at a local grocery store. He attacks the store, killing or incapacitating multiple Toughguys before fighting and defeating Laugher, whom he spares when Mike learns that he is a mentally unbalanced man who was forcibly conscripted by Yates. Phoebe escapes from Yates when Lasseter attacks him, but Krueger arrives and stops her.\n\nPhoebe and Mike leave the store under gunpoint of multiple law enforcement officers, as he proposes to her.\n\nIn a forested area, Krueger has Yates and Lasseter bound and kneeling. Yates argues that what he was doing would have been okay with Krueger, despite the deaths of innocent people, if the results had been successful, and Krueger agrees. Yates, smugly smiles and stands, but is executed by Krueger for his failure. Krueger admits that he had informed Lasseter of Yates' plan as a courtesy, but he did not expect her to intervene. She points out that, by taking out seventeen Toughguys, Mike is proof of the success of the Wiseman program and a potentially valuable asset.\n\nSix months later, handled by Lasseter and Petey, Mike and Phoebe are in [[Manila]], confident and happy together as they carry out a CIA assignment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Mike Howell\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as Phoebe Larson \n* [[Topher Grace]] as Adrian Yates\n* [[Connie Britton]] as Victoria Lasseter\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Laugher\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Rose\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Raymond Krueger\n* [[Tony Hale]] as Petey Douglas\n* [[Lavell Crawford]] as Big Harold\n* [[Stuart Greer]] as Sheriff Watts\n* [[Monique Ganderton]] as Crane\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Kristen_Stewart_Cannes_2014.jpg|thumb|alt=Kristen Stewart with dyed hair.|Kristen Stewart in 2014, with her hair dyed \"orangey-red\" for the role.<ref name=\"mtv-first-look\" />]]\n{{Anchor|Background|Writing|Development}}\nWriter Max Landis was inspired by a top secret [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] program from the 1950s code named \"[[Project MKUltra|MKUltra]],\" which conducted experiments on humans to develop superior agents through various mind control techniques.

behind even Mission Impossible and Man From Uncle. American Ultra was also beaten by the critically reviled Hitman Agent 47 and Sinister, despite being a better reviewed film than either, which leads me to a bit of a conundrum: Why? American Ultra had good ads, big stars, a fun idea, and honestly, it's a good movie. Certainly better, in the internet's opinion, than other things released the same day. If you saw it, you probably didn't hate it. so I'm left with an odd thing here, which is that American Ultra lost to a sequel, a sequel reboot, a biopic, a sequel and a reboot. It seems the reviews didn't even matter, the MOVIE didn't matter. The argument that can/will be made is: big level original ideas don't $ [sic]. Am I wrong?
