A. L. Diamond]], based on the 1956 [[Irma La Douce (musical)|French stage musical of the same name]] by Marguerite Monnot and Alexandre Breffort.<ref name=\"Tibbetts p 168\">{{cite book |last=Tibbetts |first=John C. |title=Video Versions: Film Adaptations of Plays on Video |year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-30185-8 |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsJNknw8tx8C&pg=PA168}}</ref> The film stars [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]].\n\n==Plot==\nNestor Patou, an honest policeman, has been transferred from the [[Bois de Boulogne]] to [[Les Halles]], a more urban neighborhood in Paris. He finds a street full of prostitutes working at the Hotel Casanova and raids the place. The inspector fires Nestor, who is mistakenly framed for bribery.\n\nKicked off the force and humiliated, Nestor finds himself drawn to the very neighborhood that ended his career with the Paris police\u2014returning to Chez Moustache, a popular tavern for prostitutes and pimps. Down on his luck, Nestor befriends Irma la Douce, a popular prostitute. He reluctantly accepts, as a confidante, the proprietor of Chez Moustache, a man known only as Moustache. In a running joke, Moustache tells of a storied prior life, claiming to have been, among other things, an attorney, a colonel in the Foreign Legion, and a doctor who worked with [[Albert Schweitzer]] in Africa, ending with the repeated line, \"but that's another story\". After saving Irma from her abusive pimp, Hippolyte, Nestor moves in with her, and unwittingly becomes a new one.\n\nNestor becomes infatuated and devises a plan to derail Irma's life as a prostitute. With the help of Moustache, Nestor disguises himself as Lord X, a wealthy English lord, who becomes Irma's sole client. Lord X has supposedly been rendered impotent by his service in World War II but is eager to support her in exchange for two visits each week. To pay for Lord X's exclusive access, Nestor works in the marketplace. Away every night and too tired to make love, Irma thinks he is having an affair.\n\nIrma seduces Lord X and persuades him to take her to England. At that point, Nestor decides to end the charade and kill off his alter ego. Unaware he is being tailed by Hippolyte, he tosses his disguise into the [[Seine]]. Seeing Lord X's clothes floating in the water, Hippolyte concludes Nestor killed him.\n\nArrested and sent to prison, Nestor escapes when he discovers that Irma is pregnant. He narrowly avoids being recaptured when the police search for him at the apartment; donning his old uniform, Nestor blends in with the other police and eludes capture.\n\nWith the help of Hippolyte, Nestor arranges for the police to search for him along the Seine from which, dressed as Lord X, he emerges. Vindicated of the murder, Nestor and Irma agree to get married. At the church, Irma goes into labor and has their baby. Moustache identifies the real Lord X as a guest. As Lord X leaves, a clearly baffled Moustache looks at the audience.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Nestor Patou/Lord X\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Irma la Douce\n* [[Lou Jacobi]] as Moustache\n* [[Bruce Yarnell]] as Hippolyte\n* [[Herschel Bernardi]] as Inspector Lefevre\n* [[Hope Holiday]] as Lolita\n* [[Joan Shawlee]] as Amazon Annie\n* [[Grace Lee Whitney]] as Kiki the Cossack\n* [[Paul Dubov]] as Andr\u00e9\n* [[Howard McNear]] as concierge\n* [[Cliff Osmond]] as police sergeant\n* Ruth Earl and Jane Earl as the Zebra twins\n* [[Tura Satana]] as Suzette Wong\n* [[James Brown (actor)|James Brown]] as customer from Texas\n* [[Bill Bixby]] as the tattooed sailor\n* [[John Alvin (actor)|John Alvin]] as customer #2\n* Harriette Young as Mimi the MauMau\n* Sheryl Deauville as Carmen\n* [[Billy Beck]] as Officer Dupont\n* [[Edgar Barrier]] as General Lafayette (uncredited)\n* [[James Caan]] as the U.S. soldier with radio (uncredited)\n* [[Louis Jourdan]] as narrator (uncredited)\n* [[Paul Frees]] as trailer narrator (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was conceived in 1962 as a vehicle for [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref name=\"VultureHound Magazine\">{{cite web |last1=Hogan |first1=Katie |title=\"This is not just a job, it's a profession\" \u2013 'Irma La Douce' (Blu-Ray review) |url=https://vulturehound.co.uk/2019/03/this-is-not-just-a-job-its-a-profession-irma-la-douce-blu-ray-review/ |website=VultureHound Magazine |access-date=24 December 2019 |date=18 March 2019}}</ref> The project would have reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon, both of whom had worked with her on ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.
