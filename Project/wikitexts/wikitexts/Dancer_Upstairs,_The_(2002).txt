The film is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the 1995 novel ''[[The Dancer Upstairs]]'' by [[Nicholas Shakespeare]], who also wrote the screenplay.<ref>John C. Tibbetts, and James M. Welsh, eds. ''The Encyclopedia of Novels Into Film'' (2nd ed. 2005) pp 87\u201389.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn an unnamed Latin American republic, in a remote mountainous region of the country, police sergeant Agustin Rejas, a former lawyer who left a job with a prestigious firm to join the police, is in charge of a little used checkpoint.  When a pickup truck is stopped at the checkpoint, Rejas grows suspicious of the truck\u2019s occupants.  He questions a passenger, who claims to be a laborer but is obviously educated and well spoken. While Rejas is momentarily distracted, a corrupt subordinate solicits a bribe and allows the party to leave.\n\nSeveral years later, Rejas has been promoted to [[lieutenant]] and resides in the capital with his wife and teenage daughter. Struggling to make ends meet on a police salary, Rejas visits his daughter\u2019s [[ballet]] teacher, Yolanda, to pay a long-overdue bill. Rejas strikes up a friendship with Yolanda, who tells him that his daughter has a special gift for dance. He finds her a refreshing change from his flighty, self-centered wife, and he is captivated after seeing her dance alone in her studio.  The two stop short of beginning an affair - for now.\n\nWhile working a security detail at a diplomatic reception, Rejas is recognized by lawyer Tristan Calderon, a shadowy figure with ties to [[narcotics traffickers]] and the new presidential administration. Meanwhile, Rejas and his subordinate Sucre discover a series of dead dogs hanging from lampposts, all affixed with placards referencing Maoist ideology and a \u201cPresident Ezequiel.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the name Ezequiel is invoked during a suicide bombing in the capital.\n\nFearing that political instability will invite [[democratic backsliding]], the chief of police promotes Rejas to captain and tasks him with investigating Ezequiel within the bounds of judicial process. Rejas and his team determine that Ezequiel is the ''nom de guerre'' of a [[Maoist]] terrorist leader responsible for a series of atrocities committed in the country's mountains, which were overlooked due to a breakdown in central authority toward the end of military rule. Rejas quickly identifies a prime suspect: Edgardo Rivas, a former academic who considers himself the \u201cfourth flame of Communism.\u201d Rejas recognizes Rivas as the purported laborer he interrogated at the police checkpoint in the mountains. Ezequiel wages a terror campaign in the capital, and after two senior officials are assassinated, Calderon, now the president\u2019s chief adviser, imposes martial law. The Ezequiel investigation is transferred to a military death squad. When Rejas protests, Calderon allows his investigation to continue, but with military oversight.\n\nRejas and his investigators locate a videotape that confirms Ezequiel\u2019s identity as Rivas and suggests that his hideout is located on one of two residential streets in the capital. Rejas conceals this discovery from Calderon, allowing the police to bring the investigation to a close without military interference. After an exhaustive investigation, his team locates Rivas\u2019 hideout in an upper level of the building housing Yolanda\u2019s ballet studio. Rejas succeeds in apprehending Rivas and his associates without bloodshed, but learns, to his astonishment, that Yolanda is one of Rivas\u2019 operatives.\n\nRejas ensures that the Ezequiel suspects receive [[due process]], becoming a hero to the political opposition and a plausible contender for the presidency. Meanwhile, Rivas, Yolanda, and their associates are sentenced to life imprisonment under harsh conditions. Rejas meets with Calderon and offers to refrain from a presidential candidacy in exchange for the commutation of Yolanda\u2019s sentence. Calderon agrees to the deal and informs Rejas that, to save face, the president will soon appoint him to a judgeship. Before departing, he marvels at Rejas\u2019 willingness to turn down the presidency, revealing a letter from Yolanda in which she permanently rejects Rejas. The film concludes as  Rejas arrives at his daughter\u2019s ballet recital, catching his breath as he sees her dance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Detective Agustin Rejas\n* [[Juan Diego Botto]] as Sucre\n* [[Laura Morante]] as Yolanda\n* Elvira M\u00ednguez as Llosa\n* Wolframio Sinu\u00e9 as Santiago\n* [[:es:Abel Folk|Abel Folk]] as President Ezequiel\n* [[Alexandra Lencastre]] as Sylvina Rejas\n* [[Oliver Cotton]] as Merino\n* [[Lu\u00eds Miguel Cintra]] as Calder\u00f3n\n* [[Natalia Dicenta]] as Marina\n* [[John Malkovich]] (''uncredited'') as [[Abimael Guzm\u00e1n]]\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in [[Porto, Portugal]] and [[Quito, Ecuador]]. The original theatrical release included a quick scene (about 2\u20133 seconds) of a map of [[Lima, Peru]]. This scene is deleted from the DVD release.\n\nA lamppost sign reads: \"When I hear the word culture, I reach for my pistol.\" This is a [[q:List of misquotations|quotation]] usually mis-attributed to Nazi leader [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].\n\nThe seized videotape is labeled \"Estado de sitio\"; this happens to be the Spanish title for the film ''[[State of Siege]]'' by [[Costa Gavras]]. There turns out to be an execution on the tape. Later, portions of Gavras' film itself are also seen on the tape.\n\nThe wisecrack joke about \"pubes on a coke can\" is a reference to the [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination#Anita Hill testimony|Judge Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings]].\n\n===Historical basis===\nThe story is inspired by the [[Peru]]vian [[Maoist]] guerrilla organization [[Shining Path]]. Its leader [[Abimael Guzm\u00e1n]], who was known by the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' President Gonzalo, was captured in an apartment above a ballet studio in the capital [[Lima]] in 1992. The ballet teacher Yolanda was based on Maritza Garrido Lecca, the woman in whose apartment Guzm\u00e1n was found. Bardem's character was inspired by Benedicto Jim\u00e9nez and General Antonio Ketin Vidal, the leading figures responsible for Guzm\u00e1n's capture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.caretas.com.pe/2000/1627/articulos/abimael.phtml&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=3&ct=result&prev=/search?q=Maritza+Garrido+Lecca+yolanda&hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=jGU&sa=G|title=Google Translate : Dance of Terror |website=Translate.google.com|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref> Tristan Calderon is based on [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], the de facto head of the Peruvian [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|National Intelligence Service]], who had also been an attorney for drug dealers.\n\n==Awards and accolades==\n* 2002 - '''Venice International Film Festival'''\n** '''Won''' ''Rota Soundtrack Award'' for Alberto Iglesias\n* 2002 - '''Chicago International Film Festival'''\n** ''Nomination'' for the ''New Directors Competition'' at John Malkovich\n* 2004 - '''Political Film Society'''\n** ''Nomination'' for the ''PFS Award''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0118926}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|dancer_upstairs}}\n* {{allmovie|260298}}\n* {{mojo title|dancerupstairs}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* [http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=7508&s=Interviews Nicholas Shakespeare interview]\u2014Urban Cinefile editor, Andrew L.
