It was produced by Patrick Crowley and [[David Hoberman]], directed by [[Frank Marshall (filmmaker)|Frank Marshall]] with music by [[Mark Isham]] and written by David DiGilio. It stars [[Paul Walker]] in the leading role, [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Moon Bloodgood]], and [[Jason Biggs]]. It was released theatrically on February 17, 2006, by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in the United States. The film is set in [[Antarctica]], but was filmed in [[Svalbard]], Norway, [[Greenland]], and [[British Columbia]], Canada. It tells the story of a guide at an Antarctica research base who risks his life and the lives of his colleagues to save his dogs. The film received positive reviews from critics and it earned $120.4 million on a $40 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2022}}\nIn January 1993, Jerry Shepard, guide at an [[Antarctica]] research base of the [[National Science Foundation]], is asked to take UCLA professor, Dr. Davis McClaren to [[Mount Melbourne]] to find a rare [[Meteorite#Antarctica|meteorite]] from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. As the ice conditions are poor, the best way to the mountain is by [[dog sled]].\n\nShepard and McClaren make it, but are called back to [[base camp]] due to an approaching storm. McClaren begs for more time, and Shepard gives him half a day, enough time to find a fragment of the meteorite. En route back to base, McClaren slips down an embankment, breaking his leg and falling into freezing water. Shepard uses lead dog Maya to carry a rope to McClaren and pulls him out. They battle [[hypothermia]], [[frostbite]] and near [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions as the dogs lead them to base. Once there, the entire human crew is immediately evacuated, while the dogs are left behind. Promised that their pilot will return shortly for the dogs, Shepard tightens their collars to ensure they cannot get loose. But because of the harsh weather conditions, an immediate rescue cannot be attempted.\n\nBack in the [[United States]], Shepard tries to secure a plane to return and save the dogs, but no one is willing to finance the risky expedition. Five months later, Shepard makes one last attempt to get back. McClaren finally realizes the magnitude of his ingratitude and uses the remaining balance of his grant money to finance a rescue mission. They fear that there is little chance that any of the dogs could have survived this long, but they decide to try.\n\nThe eight sled dogs \u2013 lead dog Maya, Old Jack, Shorty, Dewey, Truman, Shadow, Buck, and the young Max, wait in the freezing conditions for Shepard to return. After two weeks without eating, a [[gull]] flies near, prompting the dogs into action, and they all begin to break free, one by one. Old Jack, too weak by now, remains attached, and Maya stays to try to free him while the others chase the flock of gulls that have landed nearby. Maya sees Old Jack has given up, and she reluctantly leaves him behind when he shows no sign of wanting to leave the base. Maya joins up with the other dogs, and they all work together to attack the gulls and manage to kill a few, getting their first food in weeks.\n\nAfter nearly two months on their own, having kept their strength up and still traveling, the dogs rest on a slope one night under the [[Aurora Australis|southern lights]]. Fascinated by the display, they run about and play until Dewey slips and falls down an incline, mortally wounded at the bottom. The team stays by his side, sleeping with him. Dewey dies the following morning and Max loyally stays by his side while the others move on; by the time Max heads in their direction, he has lost traces of the pack.\n\nMaya leads the team to the [[Russia]]n base, which is unsecured and full of food, while Max finds his way back to the American base, which is well locked up. Setting back out, Max recognizes the embankment the dogs traveled through on their way back from Mount Melbourne. Exploring, Max finds a dead [[orca]], but is driven off by a [[leopard seal]] nesting inside the body. Maya and the team are nearby, they hear Max and join him. Max lures the seal away so the dogs can eat. However, it doubles back and attacks Maya, who is badly injured when it bites her leg. In a rage, the other five dogs jump on the seal, tearing and slashing at it. The seal, overwhelmed, quickly drags itself into the water and away, and the dogs feast on the orca. After, the reunited team, continue traveling. Starving, freezing and exhausted, eventually the injured Maya collapses into the snow. The dogs lie down beside their leader as the snow piles up. They have been on their own for six months.\n\nShepard goes to [[New Zealand]] looking for a boat to take him to Antarctica.  At a bar he reunites with his friends and they make it back to base together. Upon arrival to base, they are dismayed to find the body of Old Jack, still attached to the chain, and no sign of the other dogs. They then hear barking and see Max, Shorty, Truman, Shadow and Buck come over the horizon. After a joyous reunion, Shepard loads the dogs to leave, but Max runs off, leading Shepard to Maya, lying in the snow \u2013 weak, but alive. With six of his eight sled dogs, Shepard and his crew head back to civilization, with the last scene showing a grave for the two fallen dogs, Old Jack and Dewey.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Jerry Shepard\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as Dr. Davis McClaren\n* [[Moon Bloodgood]] as Katie\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Charlie Cooper\n* Gerard Plunkett as Dr. Andy Harrison\n* [[August Schellenberg]] as Mindo\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Eve McClaren\n* [[Belinda Metz]] as Rosemary Paris\n* Connor Christopher Levins as Eric McClaren\n* Duncan Fraser as Captain Lovett\n* Michael David Simms as Armin Butler\n* Malcolm Stewart as Charles Buffett\n\n==Background==\nThe 1958 [[Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition]] ([[Showa Station (Antarctica)|Showa Station]]) inspired the 1983 hit film ''[[Antarctica (1983 film)|Antarctica]]'', of which ''Eight Below'' is a remake.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/23/philipfrench9 | title=Eight Below | author=French, Philip | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=April 23, 2006 | access-date=December 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/Eight-Below-warms-the-heart-despite-faux-paws-1196053.php | title='Eight Below' warms the heart despite faux paws | author=Arnold, William | date=February 16, 2006 | work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | access-date=December 12, 2014}}</ref> ''Eight Below'' adapts the events of the 1958 incident, moved forward to 1993.<ref name=\"reporter\">{{cite web | date = 2006-02-15 | last = Rechtshaffen | first = Michael | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001997238 | title = Eight Below | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807063056/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001997238 |archive-date = 2007-08-07 |url-status=dead | access-date = 2022-01-01 }}</ref>  In the 1958 event, 15 [[Sakhalin Husky]] [[sled dog]]s were abandoned when the expedition team was unable to return to the base. When the team returned a year later, two dogs, [[Taro and Jiro]], were still alive. Another seven were still chained up and dead, and six were unaccounted for. In ''Eight Below'', two of the dogs, Old Jack and Dewey died, while the remaining six, Max, Maya, Truman, Buck, Shadow and Shorty, survived.\n\nThe film was dedicated to the memory of [[Koreyoshi Kurahara]], the director of ''Antarctica'', in which the film was adapted from, who died four years prior to its release.\n\n===Sled dogs===\nIn ''Eight Below'' there are two [[Alaskan Malamute]]s (Buck and Shadow) and six [[Siberian Husky|Siberian Huskies]] (Max, Maya, Truman, Dewey, Shorty, and Old Jack). Each actor-dog had help from other dogs that performed stunts and pulled sleds. In all, over 30 dogs were used to portray the film's eight canine characters. Max, Maya, Dewey, and Buck (Old Jack's stunt double) were played by dogs seen in Disney's ''[[Snow Dogs]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title = A True 'Survivor' Story, Dog Version | pages = C12 | work =[[The Washington Post]] | date = 2006-02-16 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/15/AR2006021502206.html?nav=E8 | access-date = 2008-01-11}}</ref>  The animal filming was supervised by the [[American Humane Association]], and the film carries the standard \"No animals were harmed...\" disclaimer, despite an on-set incident in which a trainer used significant force to break up an animal fight.<ref>{{cite news | title = Animals were Harmed | pages = C12 | publisher = The Hollywood Reporter | date = 2013-11-25 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/feature/ | access-date = 2013-11-28 | archive-date = 2013-11-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131128103425/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/feature/ | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a rating of 72%, based on 152 reviews, with an average rating of 6.50/10.
