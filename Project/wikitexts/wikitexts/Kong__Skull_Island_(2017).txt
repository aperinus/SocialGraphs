He recruits a [[U.S. Army]] unit commanded by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Preston Packard, [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]] and former British [[Special Air Service]] [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] James Conrad, and [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] photographer Mason Weaver. Arriving at Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping [[Seismic bomb|seismic explosives]], developed by Randa's [[seismologist]] Houston Brooks, to [[Reflection seismology|map out]] the island and prove Brooks' [[Hollow Earth]] theory. The unit is then attacked by the giant ape, scattering the survivors across the island. Two groups form between the survivors, one with Conrad, Weaver, Nieves, the researchers, and one of the soldiers, the other with Randa and the rest. Packard searches for the transport helicopter piloted by Major Jack Chapman, intending to use the weapons on board to kill the ape.\n\nConrad's group encounters the local Iwi natives and an older Marlow. Marlow tells the group the giant ape, named [[King Kong|Kong]], protects the island from predators, including a race of subterranean reptilian creatures he dubs \"Skullcrawlers\" which were awakened from the bombing and responsible for killing Kong's entire species, leaving him the last of his kind. The Iwi believe when Kong dies, a giant Skullcrawler will awaken and ravage the island. Marlow reveals he and Ikari had become friends during their time on the island, but Ikari was killed by a Skullcrawler some time ago. As Chapman is ambushed and devoured by a Skullcrawler, Conrad's group helps Marlow finish a boat made from parts of Marlow's and Ikari's downed planes. They ride down the river, where Nieves is torn apart by carnivorous birds, and secure communication with Packard's group. When they regroup with Packard, he insists on searching for Chapman.\n\nMarlow leads them through a [[mass grave]] of dinosaurs and Kong's family members. The Skullcrawler that killed Chapman attacks them, killing Randa and others before Weaver triggers a flammable [[gas explosion]] that kills it. Learning of Chapman's death, Packard reveals his plan to kill Kong and avenge his fallen men. Marlow and Brooks attempt to explain that killing Kong would lead to the Skullcrawlers running rampant, but Packard refuses to listen. The groups part ways, with Packard's group retrieving the weapons from Chapman's chopper and laying a trap for Kong at a nearby lake, while the non-military personnel head back to the boat. Conrad and Weaver meet Kong up-close and, seeing his true peaceful nature, resolve to save him. Packard's group lures Kong with the remaining seismic charges and incapacitates him with ignited [[napalm]]. Conrad, Weaver, and Marlow arrive and, after a [[Mexican standoff|standoff]], persuade the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard refuses to yield. As the others retreat, the giant Skullcrawler emerges from the lake, and Kong crushes Packard. The Skullcrawler fights and overpowers Kong, but in the end, the ape is victorious with the humans' help. The survivors reach the rendezvous point and leave the island as Kong stoically watches.\n\nIn a pre-end credits scene, Marlow reunites with his wife and meets his son for the first time. In a post-credits scene, Monarch detains and recruits Conrad and Weaver, who are informed by San Lin and Brooks that Kong is not the only monster king and show archive footage of cave paintings depicting [[Godzilla (MonsterVerse)|Godzilla]], [[Mothra]], [[Rodan]], and [[King Ghidorah]].
