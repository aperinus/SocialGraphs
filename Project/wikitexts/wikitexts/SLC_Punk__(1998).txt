The film centers around Steven \"Stevo\" Levy, a college graduate and [[Punk subculture|punk]] living in [[Salt Lake City]] during the mid-1980s.\n\n''SLC{{nbsp}}Punk!'' was chosen as the opening-night feature at the 1999 [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/movies/summer-films-indies-festival-to-festival-a-movable-marketplace.html?pagewanted=all \"SUMMER FILMS: INDIES; Festival to Festival, a Movable Marketplace,\" New York Times, Sunday, May 2, 1999 ]</ref>\n \nMerendino created the film based on his experience growing up in Salt Lake City. Although the film is not autobiographical, Merendino has said that many characters were based on people he knew.<ref>{{cite news| title=S.L.-filmed 'Punk!' becomes a cult classic| first=Chris| last=Hicks | newspaper=[[Deseret News]]| date=2003-08-08 | page=W05}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film outlines the daily life of a punk named Stevo in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] in the fall of 1985. Stevo's best friend, \"Heroin\" Bob, is also a punk. The nickname \"Heroin\" is ironic, as Bob is [[Trypanophobia|afraid of needles]] and actually believes that any drug (with the notable exception of alcohol and cigarettes) is inherently dangerous.\n\nStevo and Bob go from party to party while living in a dilapidated apartment. They spend much of their time fighting with members of other subcultures, particularly [[rednecks]]. Stevo has a casual relationship with a girl named Sandy, while Bob is in love with Trish, the manager of a [[head shop]].\n\nThe two of them are shaped by their experiences with their parents. Stevo's parents, now divorced, are former hippies who are proud of their youthful endeavors; however, Stevo is revolted by what he perceives as their \"selling out\" by becoming affluent [[Reagan Republican]]s, which they lamely try to justify. Stevo's grades are excellent, and when his father sends an application to [[Harvard Law School]] and Stevo is accepted, he nevertheless rejects it because of his beliefs. By contrast, Bob's father is a mentally ill alcoholic who mistakes his son and his friend for [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operatives and chases them away with a shotgun when they visit him on his birthday.\n\nStevo begins to see the drawbacks of living the punk life. Sean, a fellow punk, was a drug dealer who once attempted to stab his mother while under the influence of an entire 100-dose sheet of acid; in the present, Stevo finds him [[Begging|panhandling]] on the street with some obvious mental issues.\n\nWhile Stevo understands that his relationship with Sandy is casual, he is still enraged when he discovers her having sex with another man and savagely beats him, later loathing himself because his action contradicts his own belief in [[anarchism]]. His social circle also begins to drift away, as his friend, Mike, leaves Salt Lake City to attend the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Soon after, Stevo attends a party and falls in love with a rich girl named Brandy, who points out that his clothing and hair are fashion as opposed to true rebellion. Rather than being offended, Stevo takes the criticism thoughtfully, and they passionately kiss.\n\nAt the same party, Bob complains of a headache (induced by [[Spandau Ballet]]'s \"[[She Loved Like Diamond]]\" playing on a stereo), and is given [[Percodan]], which he consumes with alcohol after being told the pills are simply \"vitamins\" that will help his headache. The accidental [[drug overdose]] kills him in his sleep. When Stevo discovers Bob's body, he breaks down completely. At the funeral, he appears with a shaved head and changed clothing, having decided he is done with being a punk. He plans to go to Harvard, and earlier narration suggests that he eventually marries Brandy. He notes in his closing narration that his youthful self would probably kick his future self's ass, wryly describing himself as having been ultimately just another [[poseur]].\n\n===The \"Tribes\"===\nThe film features several cliques presented as tribes. The film focuses primarily on the punk tribe, but includes several others as well:\n* [[Punk subculture|Punk]]s: Stevo, Bob, Sean, Megan, and Mike belong to this tribe, although Mike does not dress the part. The punks are rivals of the [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[Neo-Nazism|nazis]] and [[Redneck (stereotype)|rednecks]].\n* [[Mod revival|Mods]]: Mods wear suits and ties, and they ride scooters. They are generally the rivals of the punks, but the character John the Mod acts as a diplomat who freely moves between the tribes.\n* [[Redneck]]s: Rednecks are rural Utah folk who wear trucker caps and flannel, and drive around in big trucks. Punks hate them for their conservative views.\n* [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]]s: Neo-Nazis are [[white power skinhead]]s who wear pseudo-military fatigues and Nazi armbands. Punks and mods are shown to hate them.\n* The [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] Guys: They have long hair and flannel. Not much else is known about them, except that Stevo explains that they are predatory toward the new wavers.\n* [[New wave music|New wavers]]: They are people who dress like [[new romantic]]s and are said to be the least threatening of the tribes. They are described as being \"the new [[hippie]]s.\" Every tribe is predatory to the new wavers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Steven \"Stevo\" Levy\n** Christopher Ogden as young Stevo\n* [[Michael A.

Numerous scenes took place in locally well-known areas:\n* The high school, which Heroin Bob calls \"Southeast High\", is [[Salt Lake City School District#West High School|West High School]] near downtown Salt Lake City.\n* The scene where Heroin Bob chastises Stevo for using acid takes place at [[Presidents Circle]] at the [[University of Utah]].\n* Stevo introduces the \"poseurs\" and gives his \"Who Started Punk Rock?\" speech at the now-defunct Cottonwood [[shopping mall|Mall]] in Holladay, Utah.  Sean's \"women's clothing\" job interview takes place inside a Cottonwood Mall storefront.\n* Stevo and Sandy drop [[LSD|acid]] at [[Memory Grove (Salt Lake City)|Memory Grove Park]], a [[World War I]] memorial park.\n* Many exterior street scenes occur just north of the Frank E. Moss Federal Courthouse in the downtown area. The scene where Stevo and Sandy run into Sean begging was shot on Market Street. You can see The Felt and Boston Buildings in the background. Sean is standing in front of the old Odd Fellows Building which currently houses The Dennis Group Engineering consulting at 26 W Market Street. Trish\u2019s head shop was on the 200 block of E 300 S. The Broadway Plaza at 250 E 300 S is visible when Mark walks in. \n* The ECP concert was shot at the old Deseret News Paper Mill at the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon, posing as The SLC Indian Center.\n* The scenes depicting Heroin Bob's funeral were shot inside and outside The [[Cathedral of the Madeleine]]. The cathedral is located just east of downtown Salt Lake City.\n* The apartment where Stevo and Heroin Bob live was the Big D Construction building, across from Pioneer Park.\n* The store where they bought the \"Wyoming Beer\" is 'Porter's Fireworks and Liquor' on the outskirts of Evanston.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = SLC Punk!\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = March 16, 1999\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Punk rock]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Hollywood Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\n# \"[[Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song)|I Never Promised You a Rose Garden]]\" - [[The Suicide Machines]] (originally performed by [[Lynn Anderson]])\n# \"Sex and Violence\" - [[The Exploited]]\n# \"[[I Love Livin' in the City]]\" - [[Fear (band)|Fear]]\n# \"1969\" - [[The Stooges]]\n# \"Too Hot\" - [[The Specials]]\n# \"Cretin Hop\" - [[Ramones]]\n# \"[[Dreaming (Blondie song)|Dreaming]]\" - [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]\n# \"Gangsters\" - The Specials\n# \"Kiss Me Deadly\" - [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]]\n# \"[[Rock & Roll (The Velvet Underground song)|Rock N' Roll]]\" - [[The Velvet Underground]]\n# \"Gasoline Rain\" - Moondogg\n# \"[[Mirror in the Bathroom (song)|Mirror in the Bathroom]]\" - Fifi (originally performed by [[The English Beat]])\n# \"Amoeba\" - [[The Adolescents]]\n# \"[[Kill the Poor]]\" - [[Dead Kennedys]]\n# \"Look Back and Laugh\" - [[Minor Threat]]\n\nEight Bucks Experiment, the band portraying fictional English band ECP, were featured on a European release of the soundtrack.<ref>[http://bluemoonrecordings.com/8discography.html 8discography.html<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The three songs they recorded live for the punk concert scene were sent back to the band after filming.

The film was successfully funded by an Indiegogo campaign launched on October 27, 2013, and completed on January 15, 2014. Merendino said of the sequel, \u201cI made ''SLC Punk!'' when I was a kid, and accordingly, the story is naive, and, as just a coming of age story, not finished. The characters are facing big questions, 18 years later, as outsiders, punk rockers\u2026 What relevance do they have in a world where all statements have already been made? In the years since I made ''SLC Punk!'', it has found a rather large and supportive following who have been very kind to me. So in making a sequel, I feel I owe it to those people to really do it right.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Giroux|first1=Jesse|title=Exclusive interview with director James Merendino!
