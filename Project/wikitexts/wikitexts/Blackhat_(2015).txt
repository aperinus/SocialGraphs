The film premiered at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] on January 8, 2015, and was released in theaters on January 16. ''Blackhat'' was a [[box-office bomb]], earning only $19.7 million at the box office against a budget of $70 million. The film received generally mixed reviews, with criticisms focused on casting and pace, though the film appeared on some critics' year-end lists.\n\n==Plot==\nA nuclear plant in [[Chai Wan]], [[Hong Kong]], goes into meltdown when a hacker causes the coolant pumps to overheat and explode. Soon after, the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] gets hacked, causing soy futures to rise. The Chinese government and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] determine that the hack was performed using a [[remote access tool]]. Captain Chen Dawai of the [[People's Liberation Army]] [[Cyberwarfare|cyber warfare]] unit is tasked with finding the hacker, and enlists the aid of his sister Lien, a networking engineer. He meets with FBI Special Agent Carol Barrett in [[Los Angeles]] and reveals the code in the tool was written by himself and Nicholas Hathaway, his college roommate, during their time at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. Dawai requests that Hathaway, who is in prison for hacking banks, be offered a temporary release in exchange for his services. Hathaway, knowing how necessary he is to the investigation, demands new terms: his prison sentence commuted if his assistance leads to the hacker's identification and capture. He is required to wear an [[ankle bracelet monitor]] and be accompanied by deputy [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Mark Jessup.\n\nHathaway manipulates the update system on Jessup's phone GPS that tracks his location, allowing him to follow his own lead and arrange a meeting with the hacker's partner at a restaurant. While they wait, he tells Lien about his past, but the partner does not arrive. Hathaway discovers a camera watching them and, following it to the connected computer, messages the hacker that he is now on his trail.\n\nClues uncovered by Dawai and Barrett lead the team to Hong Kong, where they work with Police Inspector Alex Trang. The team traces the stock trade money to a paramilitary operative named Elias Kassar. Hathaway, Jessup, Chen, and Trang, along with a [[Special Duties Unit]] team, raid Kassar's hideout, and a shootout ensues in a drainage tunnel, resulting in the deaths of Trang and several officers as Kassar and his men escape.\n\nThe nuclear plant has stabilized enough to have a data drive recovered from the control room, but it is corrupted by radiation. The [[National Security Agency]]'s Black Widow software has the ability to repair the data, but they refuse to allow the Chinese access. Reluctantly sanctioned by Barret, Hathaway hacks into the NSA and uses Black Widow, discovering that the hacker's server is based in [[Jakarta]]. Lien finds out the hacker has been buying high-resolution satellite photos of a site near [[Seri Manjung]], [[Malaysia]].\n\nFor his illegal hack, the NSA and FBI demand Hathaway's return to prison. Dawai's superiors advise him to turn Hathaway over to the U.S. government, but he instead alerts Hathaway to their plans. Meanwhile, one of Kassar's men secretly plants a tracking device on Dawai's car. As Hathaway and Lien, who have become romantically involved, argue about his fleeing alone, Dawai is blown up by a rocket launched by Kassar; Barret and Jessup, arriving on the scene, manage to shoot several of Kassar's men before they are both killed. Lien and Hathaway escape on a subway train, and she uses her connections to charter a plane to Malaysia.\n\nHathaway deduces that the hacker's attack at the nuclear plant was merely a test for a later plan: to sabotage a large dam and destroy several major tin mines in Malaysia, allowing the hacker to make a profit buying tin [[option (finance)|options]]. In Jakarta, he hacks into a bank's computer to drain the hacker's bank accounts, forcing the hacker, Sadak, to contact him. Sadak and Hathaway agree to meet and discuss a partnership; Hathaway anticipates a double-cross and arms himself with makeshift weapons and body armor which he conceals under his clothes.\n\nThough Hathaway insists Sadak and Kassar come alone, they bring their henchmen. Lien spots them and alerts Hathaway, who orders them to a new location in a park during a large religious procession. Hathaway trails them, but is caught at gunpoint by Kassar. As he is being frisked, Hathaway blindsides and stabs Kassar to death with a sharpened screwdriver. Sadak's men catch up and a firefight ensues; Hathaway is shot several times, but manages to kill the reinforcements. Sadak stabs Hathaway with a knife before Hathaway kills him. He reunites with Lien, who treats his wounds, before they leave Indonesia with Sadak's money.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Nicholas Hathaway, a convicted computer hacker\n* [[Tang Wei]] as Chen Lien\n* [[Wang Leehom|Leehom Wang]] as P.L.A.

According to critic Nick Pinkerton, Mann's concern with surveillance follows in the footsteps of earlier films by [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Henry Hathaway]]. The emerging relationship between power and network technology in the mid\u201320th century was a major theme in those directors' respective works, particularly Lang's ''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]]''{{nbsp}}(1960) and Hathaway's ''[[The House on 92nd Street]]''{{nbsp}}(1945) and ''[[Call Northside 777]]''{{nbsp}}(1948). Pinkerton suggested that ''Blackhat''{{'}}s protagonist was named \"Hathaway\" in an intentional allusion to the latter director.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pinkerton |first=Nick |date=July\u2013August 2018 |title=A Thousand Unblinking Eyes: A History \u2013 Cinema and Surveillance from Fritz Lang to Michael Mann |journal=[[The Baffler]] |issue=40 |jstor=26477362 |pages=36\u201343}}</ref>\n\nIn an early scene, several books seen on Hathaway's prison-cell bookshelf serve as an \"ideological gate key\" to the film, according to critic Niles Schwartz. These include books of philosophy and [[critical theory]] like [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]]'s ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'', [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ''[[The Animal That Therefore I Am]]'', [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s ''America''; a biography of nuclear physicists [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[J.
