Produced by [[Syncopy Inc.|Syncopy]], and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it is the first installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU)<ref name=\"DCEU\" /><ref name=\"DCMarvelForbes\" /> and a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' film series]] that portrays the character's [[Origin of Superman|origin story]]. The film is directed by [[Zack Snyder]], written by [[David S. Goyer]] from a story by him and [[Christopher Nolan]], who also produces, and stars [[Henry Cavill]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], and [[Russell Crowe]]. In the film, [[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Clark Kent]] learns that he is a superpowered alien from the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. He assumes the role of mankind's protector as Superman, making the choice to face [[General Zod (DC Extended Universe)|General Zod]] and prevent him from destroying humanity.\n\nDevelopment began in 2008 when Warner Bros. took pitches from [[comic book]] writers, [[screenwriter]]s, and [[film director|directors]], opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling resulted in [[Jerry Siegel]]'s family recapturing the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer [[Christopher Nolan]] pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2011 in [[West Chicago, Illinois]], before moving to [[Vancouver]] and [[Plano, Illinois]].\n\n''Man of Steel'' premiered in the [[Alice Tully Hall]] on June 10, 2013, and was released in the United States on June 14, 2013 in 2D, 3D, and [[IMAX]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film's action sequences, cinematography, visual effects, Snyder's direction and Hans Zimmer's score, as well as Shannon's performance as Zod, although they were divided on Cavill's performance as Superman, while its pacing, lack of character development and serious tonal approach to Superman was criticized. The film grossed over $668{{nbsp}}million worldwide, it made a net profit of approximately $42 million, and is [[2013 in film|the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2013]]. It is the final DC film co-financed by [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Pictures]]. A [[Sequel|follow-up]] entitled ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' was released on March 25, 2016, while a proper sequel is currently in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words only. As of 5/6/21, word count is 491 words. -->\nThe planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] is destabilized from the mining of the [[planetary core]]. Just before the planet explodes, Krypton's supreme council chief advisor [[Jor-El]] infuses the genetics codex into his infant son, [[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Kal-El]], the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Jor-El manages to send Kal-El in a spacecraft toward Earth before being killed by [[General Zod (DC Extended Universe)|General Zod]] during an uprising. Kal-El lands in [[Kansas]], where he is adopted by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]] and named [[Clark Kent|Clark]]. As he grows older, he develops superhuman powers that Jonathan urges him to keep hidden, even refusing Clark's help years later during a tornado incident where he loses his life. Burdened with guilt over Jonathan's death, Clark travels the globe hiding under various aliases seeking a purpose in life.\n\n''[[Daily Planet]]'' reporter [[Lois Lane (DC Extended Universe)|Lois Lane]] receives an assignment to investigate the discovery of a Kryptonian scout ship in the Canadian Arctic. Clark enters the ship disguised as a worker and learns from its artificial intelligence (AI), modeled after his father Jor-El, that Clark was sent to Earth to guide its people. While following Clark, Lois inadvertently triggers the ship's security system, and he uses his powers to rescue Lois from its defenses. He wears a uniform provided by the ship's AI and begins testing his flying abilities. Unable to convince supervisor [[Perry White]] to publish an article on the incident, Lois tracks down Clark in Smallville, with the intent of exposing him. However, Lois drops the story upon hearing of Jonathan Kent's sacrifice, keeping Clark's identity safe, which fuels Perry's suspicions.\n\nZod and his crew escape the [[Phantom Zone]], where they were imprisoned for treason for their actions against Krypton. They travel to Earth to turn it into a new Krypton, possessing several [[terraforming]] devices salvaged from Kryptonian outposts. Following Clark and Lois' capture, Zod's science officer, [[Jax-Ur]], extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will build a society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity. Using the Jor-El AI to take over the ship, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military of Zod's plan, resulting in an explosive confrontation between Clark and Zod's troops.\n\nZod deploys his most powerful terraforming device, the World Engine, which severely damages [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and puts humanity's existence at risk. Clark destroys the terraforming platform while the military launches a suicide attack, sending Zod's troops back to the Phantom Zone. With the ship destroyed and Krypton's only hope of revival gone, Zod vows to destroy Earth and its inhabitants out of revenge. The two Kryptonians engage in a lengthy battle across Metropolis, which concludes when Clark is forced to kill Zod as he attacks a family in a train station. Sometime later, Clark adopts the moniker \"[[Superman]]\" and persuades the government to let him act independently, under the condition he does not turn against humanity. To gain covert access to dangerous situations, he takes a job under his civilian identity, Clark Kent, as a freelance reporter for the ''Daily Planet''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of DC Extended Universe cast members|Characters of the DC Extended Universe}}\n[[File:Zack Snyder, Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe (3).jpg|thumb|Left to right: director [[Zack Snyder]] with actors [[Henry Cavill]] and [[Russell Crowe]], at the world premiere of ''Man of Steel'' in Sydney, Australia, 2013]]\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as [[Clark Kent (DC Extended Universe)|Kal-El / Clark Kent]]:<!--STOP!

Cavill also stated that, \"He's alone and there's no one like him,\" referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. \"That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, and trying to find out what makes sense.

We did a lot of auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it.\"<ref name=\"AdamsCast3\"/> Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced ''Superman: Flyby'', and the second time for ''Superman Returns'' before landing the current role.<ref name=\"AdamsFlyby\"/> Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, \"We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful.\"<ref name=\"AdamsCast4\"/> On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an \"independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world.\" Adams said that \"She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on.

You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate [[antagonist]] for that.

Waid said: \"''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' has proven the audience will forgive you and let you redo the franchise\".<ref name=\"RebootMTV\"/> Morrison's idea was similar to their work on ''[[All-Star Superman]]'', while Waid's was akin to ''[[Superman: Birthright]]''.<ref name=\"RebootMTV\"/> [[Mark Millar]], teaming with director [[Matthew Vaughn]], also planned an epic eight-hour ''Superman'' trilogy, each installment released a year apart, similar to ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"MillarDoG\"/><ref name=\"VaughnMTV\"/> Millar compared it to [[The Godfather (film series)|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], in which it would chronicle the entire life of Superman, from the early days of Krypton, where little Kal-El witnesses his father's tireless struggle to save the planet, to the finale where Superman loses his powers as the Sun starts to go [[supernova]].<ref name=\"MillarEmpire\"/> According to Millar, Vaughn suggested his ''[[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]]'' actor [[Charlie Cox]] as a Golden-Age inspired Superman \"when he was a bit more of a regular person\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bleedingcool.com/movies/daredevils-charlie-cox-once-considered-for-superman/|title=Daredevil's Charlie Cox Once Considered for Superman|last=Chang|first=Tom|date=May 14, 2020|website=Bleeding Cool|access-date=April 5, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2008, Warner Bros. suggested a reboot of the film series. Studio executive Jeff Robinov planned to have the film released either by 2010 or 2011, explaining that \"''Superman Returns'' didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a [[Batman]] and Superman movie at all.\"<ref name=\"RobinovWSJ\"/> Paul Levitz stated in an interview that Batman holds the key to the Superman reboot. He elaborated: \"Everyone is waiting for Nolan to sign on for another Batman, once that happens, the release date for Superman and all other future projects will follow.\"<ref name=\"LevitzMovieWeb\"/> In February 2009, [[McG]], who previously planned to direct ''Superman: Flyby'', expressed interest in returning to the Superman franchise.<ref name=\"LevitzMovieWeb\"/><ref name=\"McGio9\"/> August 2009 saw a court ruling in which [[Jerry Siegel]]'s family recaptured 50% of the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's share of the copyright in [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]].<ref name=\"SiegelVariety\"/> In addition, a judge ruled that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films.

During story discussions for ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' in 2008, [[David S. Goyer]] told [[Christopher Nolan]] his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context.<ref name=\"GoyerStory\"/> Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio,<ref name=\"GoyerStory\"/> who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name=\"NolanDeadline\"/><ref name=\"RobinovWSJ\"/> Nolan admired [[Bryan Singer]]'s work on ''Superman Returns'' for its connection to [[Richard Donner]]'s version, stating that \"a lot of people have approached Superman in a lot of different ways. I only know the way that has worked for us that's what I know how to do\", emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the ''Man of Steel'' would assure the integrity needed for the film. Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series, in which he commented: \"Each serves to the internal logic of the story.

Filming took place in the [[Chicago Loop]] from September 7 to 17.<ref name=\"ChicagoBusiness2\"/> The Chicago shoot was a unit project, meaning that filming would partake numerous establishing shots as well as [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]] and might not necessarily include principal cast members.<ref name=\"ChicagoSR\"/>\n\n===Design===\n''Man of Steel'' features a redesigned Superman costume by [[James Acheson]] and [[Michael Wilkinson (costume designer)|Michael Wilkinson]]. The costume preserves the color scheme and \"S\" logo, but adopts darker tones, and notably does not feature the red [[Swim trunks|trunks]] usually worn by Superman. Zack Snyder said the costume is \"a modern aesthetic\". He and the producers attempted to devise a suit featuring the red trunks, but could not design one that fit into the tone of the film, leading to their removal from the suit.<ref name=\"DesignNYDaily\"/> Because of Wilkinson's unavailability, Snyder chose Acheson to design the suit; however, he only started developing it, and Wilkinson finished the development when he returned, and designed the other character's costumes as well.<ref name=\"DesignEsquire\"/> Due to the substantial weight a practical suit would yield, the [[Kryptonian]] armor for General Zod was constructed through CGI to allow Shannon \"freedom of movement\".<ref name=\"DesignTotalFilm\"/> In a March 2014 interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Wilkinson explained the reason for the look of Superman's redesigned suit:\n{{blockquote|A lot of the efforts we took in the film were to explain why the suit looks the way it does. We didn't want it to be a random, ornamental decision. We start the film on the planet of Krypton, which is where the suit comes from, and we go to great pains to show the suit fitting into the culture. All of the people you see on Krypton are wearing this chainmail-like suit, with the same detailing as the Superman suit. Everyone has their family crests on their chests. The cuff and the boot details are shared through all of the different characters we meet on Krypton. So by the time we see Superman in his suit we understand why it looks the way it looks.<ref name=\"DesignEsquire\"/>}}\n\n===Effects===\nJohn \"DJ\" Desjardin served as the visual supervisor for ''Man of Steel'', with [[Weta Digital]], [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]] and [[DNEG|Double Negative]] providing the [[visual effects]] for the film.<ref name=\"LetteriIndieWire\"/><ref name=\"DNeg\"/> Zack Snyder wanted the film to \"appear very natural because there's some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team had to make it as easy as possible for them to do so.\" Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a \"[[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9|documentary-style]]\" film. Desjardin said: \"We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action. So for a lot of the [[Previsualization|previs]] we did, we'd start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the ''Battlestar Galactica'' rules for the space cams that [[Gary Hutzel|Gary Hurtzel]]{{sic}} developed for that [[miniseries]], where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod\u2014we had to break it a bit.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\n[[File:KryptonMOS.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Alien-like planet landscapes, creatures, and architecture were created by Weta Digital to further enhance the worldbuilding process of planet Krypton.]]\nFor the first act of the film taking place on the planet Krypton, Weta Digital placed alien-like planet environments, creatures and the principal means of display\u2014a technology the filmmakers called \"liquid geometry\". Weta Digital visual effects supervisor [[Dan Lemmon]] explained that \"it's a bunch of silver beads that are suspended through a magnetic field, and the machine is able to control that magnetic field so that the collection of beads behave almost like three-dimensional [[pixel]]s, and they can create a surface that floats in the air and describes whatever the thing is you're supposed to be seeing.\" The beads of the display, which up close would appear to be pyramids with a slight [[bevel]], were designed to create a surface of the object to depict inside a \"console-like\" figure.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\nIn the [[3D modeling|modeling]] and [[animation]] aspect of the liquid geometry, Goodwin explained: \"We had to develop a pipeline to bring in assets, so instead of going through the route of reducing the [[polygon]] count to something usable what we would then do\u2014you would take the model in whatever way it was made and just scatter discrete points onto it, and extract the matrix onto the animation and copy these points onto the matrix and have these sparse points behaving in a way that the model would.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/> After the animation, artists duplicated the beads onto the animated geometry for a pre-simulated lighting version to get approval on how the object would read. [[Simulation|Sims]] were then run \"on all the targets which would be discrete beads floating around on top of the surface which would have its own set of parameters\", in which Goodwin further explained: \"The bead size or the turbulence that would crawl along the surface constantly updating the orientation was based on the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] provided by the surface. That was then saved to disk and we would use that sim as the final target for the simulation.\" After the simulation process, Weta Digital ran every bead through a temporal filter to remove jitter to control the noise. Lighting solutions directly worked on the set. Weta utilized [[Pixar RenderMan|RenderMan]] to take advantage of improved [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[Geometry instancing|instancing]] objects.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\nThe sequences where Superman utilizes close-combat fight scenes with the other Kryptonians proved to be a major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/> Desjardin explained: \"When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don't want to do the traditional, 'OK I'm a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that's not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters\u2014grappling, punching or flying away\u2014and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of [[Image resolution|high-res]] stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\nMPC handled the visual effects for the \"Smallville encounter\" sequence. Before providing the visual effects, the shots were previsualized for the fight choreography. After the previsualizations, live action portions of the scene would be filmed in small pieces: \"If say Superman was being punched and would land 50 meters away, we would shoot our start position and end position, and then bridge that gap with the CG takeovers\", says [[Guillaume Rocheron]], the MPC visual effects supervisor. A camera rig would then obtain [[key frame]]s of the choreographed actor; Desjardin said \"it's a six-still camera rig that's built on a pipe rig so that you can run it in at the end of a setup and get stills of key frames of a performance or an expression, and then we could use those hi-res stills to project onto the CG double and get really accurate transition lighting and color\u2014right from the set.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\nOn set, a camera rig was used to capture the environment of the sequence. Dubbed \"enviro-cam\", the visual effects crew would mount a [[Canon EOS 5D]] and a motorized nodal head, allowing the crew to capture the environment at a 360-degree angle with 55K resolution for every shot, the process would take approximately two to four minutes. The set capture resulted in lighting and textures that could be reprojected onto geometry.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/> Full-screen digital doubles were a major component for the fighting sequences. Digital armor was also added, along with the energy-based Kryptonian helmets. Cyberscan and FACS were conducted with the actors, and [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] and non-polarized reference photos were taken. Superman's cape and costume were scanned in high detail\u2014the cape in particular became a direct extension of Superman's actions.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\nFor the sequences involving the terraforming of the city Metropolis, Double Negative handled the visual effects for the sequence. In order to construct a Metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic, Double Negative utilized [[Esri]]'s [[CityEngine]] to help procedurally deliver the city. According to [[Ged Wright]], a Double Negative visual effects supervisor, it was a much more sci-fi based role, \"so we took what they had done and extended it a great deal. The work we were doing was based around the Downtowns for New York, L.A. and Chicago and that gave us the building volumes for heights. We'd skin those volumes with kit parts, but most of it then had to fall down! So we had to rig it for destruction and use it for other aspects of the work as well.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\nFor the destruction of the buildings, the studio rewrote its own asset system to focus towards its dynamic events. The [[Bullet (software)|Bullet]] physics software was a heavily impacted component for the utilization of the destruction. Wright said that \"we wanted to be able to run an RBD event and trigger all these secondary events, whether it was glass or dust simulations\u2014all of those things needed to be chained up and handled in a procedural way. One of the advantages of this was that, because it was all based around a limited number of input components, you can make sure they're modeled in a way they're usable in effects\u2014you can model something but they'll be another stage to rig it for destruction.\" Fire, smoke, and water stimulation tools were developed at the Double Negative studio. The studio transitioned between the existing proprietary volume [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] software to rendering in Mantra for elements such as fireball sims. Double Negative also used the in-house fluids tool \"Squirt\" to handle larger-scale sims and interaction for more tightly coupled volumes and particles. Regarding the battle between Superman and Zod, Double Negative implemented real photography onto its digital doubles.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Man of Steel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Hans Zimmer]] initially denied popular rumors that he would be composing the [[Film score|film's score]],<ref name=\"ZimmerRumor\"/> but in June 2012, it was confirmed that Zimmer would, in fact, be doing so after all.<ref name=\"ZimmerConfirm\"/> To completely distinguish ''Man of Steel'' from the previous films, the iconic \"[[Superman music|Superman March]]\" by [[John Williams]] was not used.<ref name=\"WilliamsMarch\"/> Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for ''Man of Steel'' was released publicly on June 11, 2013.<ref name=\"SoundtrackRelease\"/> An unofficial rip of the musical score from the third [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]], entitled \"An Ideal of Hope\", confirmed to be a cut-down version of the track \"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\", was released on April 19.<ref name=\"IdealOfHope\"/> In late April, the official track listing of the two-[[CD]] deluxe edition was revealed.<ref name=\"SoundtrackRelease2\"/>\n\n==Themes==\nMany reviewers interpreted ''Man of Steel'' as a religious [[allegory]], especially since Warner Bros. set up a website that contains \"a nine-page pamphlet entitled ''Jesus: The Original Superhero''\".<ref name=\"SupermanJesusGuardian\"/><ref name=\"SupermanJesusCNN\"/> Justin Craig compares Kal-El's struggle to the [[Passion of Christ]], stating that \"Kal-El is more than willing to sacrifice himself to save the people of Earth.

On the other hand, barring Lois Lane's own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction's greatest reveals), the hero we see in the final moments of ''Man of Steel'' is nothing if not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created ... with just a bit more in the 'imperfections' column.\"<ref name=\"PopMattersReview\"/> Steve Persall of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' stated that, \"''Man of Steel'' is more than just ''Avengers''-sized [[escapism]]; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew.\"<ref name=\"TampaBayReview\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Richard Corliss]] said, \"The movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El's extraordinary powers, but when it dramatizes Clark Kent's roiling humanity. The super part of ''Man of Steel'' is just okay, but the man part is super.\"<ref name=\"TimeReview\"/> In a review on [[Roger Ebert]]'s website, [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it an \"astonishing movie\" and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod. But he criticized the film for not having more personal and intimate moments between Clark and Lois.<ref name=\"EbertReview\"/> In 2014, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' ranked ''Man of Steel'' the 286th-greatest film ever made on their list of \"The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time\" as voted by the magazine's readers.<ref name=\"EmpireRank\"/>\n\nSpeaking to [[Fox Business Channel]], [[Grae Drake]], senior editor of Rotten Tomatoes, expressed dismay over the critical reception, stating, \"As much as I love and respect our critics at Rotten Tomatoes, I've got to say I am shocked. Listen, the movie's not perfect but ... I just cannot fathom it. It was a good movie, you guys.\"<ref name=\"GraeDrake\"/>\n\nReaction to the film among comics creators was mixed.<ref name=\"ComicsDivideMTV\"/> Those who enjoyed it include [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]], [[Heidi MacDonald]], [[Ethan Van Sciver]], [[Christos Gage]] and former Superman writer [[Dan Jurgens]]. Among its detractors were [[Joe Keatinge]], [[Sean McKeever]], Gabriel Hardman and [[Mark Waid]]. MacDonald praised the film's action, drama and leads Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Van Sciver singled out Cavill in particular for praise. Gage called it the best ''Superman'' film since 1980's ''[[Superman II]]''. Hardman said that he liked a lot of the mechanics but did not connect with the characters, which robbed the story of tension. Waid, who wrote the origin miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', criticized the film for its overall \"joyless\" tone, and for Superman's decision to kill Zod,<ref name=\"ComicsDivideMTV\"/><ref name=\"WaidReview\"/> a criticism echoed by other creators. Writer [[Grant Morrison]], who wrote the critically acclaimed miniseries ''[[All-Star Superman]]'', expressed mixed reaction to the film, saying that while they \"kinda liked it and kinda didn't\", it did not present anything new, as they would have preferred a \"second act\" type story with Lex Luthor instead of re-establishing the character by presenting information Morrison is already familiar with. Morrison also questioned the need for a superhero to kill,<ref name=\"MorrisonUSAToday\"/> as did artist [[Neal Adams]]. Adams suggested that other alternatives were open to Superman when Zod threatened innocent people with his heat vision, such as covering his eyes. He also criticized Superman for not moving the battle away from [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] as the character did at the end of ''Superman II''.<ref name=\"AdamsCBN\"/> [[Jim Lee]] had a positive opinion: \"It\u2019s epic. It\u2019s got a lot of heart, but one of the things that was kind of missing from the last Superman movie I think was the action, and this movie has it in spades. I mean it is a visual thrill ride. It is amazing. You get to see all the powers of Superman, and in all its glory, and I think people are going to be blown away.\"<ref name=\"JimLeeComicBook\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:22%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref.|References}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Annie Awards]]\n| [[41st Annie Awards|February 1, 2014]]\n| Outstanding Animated Effects - Live Action\n| Jonathan Paquin, Brian Goodwin, Gray Horsfield, Mathieu Chardonnet, Adrien Toupet\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref name=\"AnnieAwards\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[British Academy Children's Awards]]\n| November 25, 2013\n| BAFTA Kids' Vote \u2013 Feature Film\n| ''Man of Steel''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref name=\"BAFTAKids\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Critics' Choice Awards]]\n| [[19th Critics' Choice Awards|January 16, 2014]]\n| [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor in an Action Movie|Best Actor in an Action Movie]]\n| [[Henry Cavill]]\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref name=\"CriticsChoice\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Golden Trailer Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"3\"| June 17, 2013\n| Summer 2013 Blockbuster Trailer\n| rowspan=\"3\"| ''Man of Steel''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| <ref name=\"GoldenTrailer\"/>\n|-\n| Best Summer 2013 Blockbuster Poster\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| Best Teaser Poster\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Houston Film Critics Society]]\n| [[Houston Film Critics Society Awards 2013|December 15, 2013]]\n| Best Original Score\n| [[Hans Zimmer]]\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref name=\"HoustonFCS\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[NewNowNext Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| June 17, 2013\n| Cause You're Hot\n| Henry Cavill\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| <ref name=\"NewNowNextNom\"/><br /><ref name=\"NewNowNextWon\"/>\n|-\n| Next Must-See Movie\n| ''Man of Steel''\n| {{won}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[MTV Movie Awards]]\n| [[2014 MTV Movie Awards|April 13, 2014]]\n| [[MTV Movie Award for Best Hero|Best Hero]]\n| Henry Cavill\n| {{won}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref name=\"MTVMovieAwards\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[People's Choice Awards]]\n| [[40th People's Choice Awards|January 8, 2014]]\n| Favorite Dramatic Actress\n| [[Amy Adams]]\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref name=\"PeoplesChoice\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Saturn Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"3\"| [[40th Saturn Awards|June 26, 2014]]\n| [[Saturn Award for Best Comic-to-Film Motion Picture|Best Comic-to-Film Motion Picture]]\n| ''Man of Steel''\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| <ref name=\"SaturnAwards\"/>\n|-\n| [[Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor|Best Performance by a Younger Actor]]\n| [[Dylan Sprayberry]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Saturn Award for Best Special Effects|Best Special Effects]]\n| [[Joe Letteri]], John \"DJ\" Desjardin, [[Dan Lemmon]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Teen Choice Awards]]\n| rowspan=\"4\"| [[2013 Teen Choice Awards|August 13, 2013]]\n| Choice Movie: Liplock\n| Henry Cavill and Amy Adams\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| <ref name=\"TeenChoice\"/>\n|-\n| Choice Summer Movie: Action\n| ''Man of Steel''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Choice Summer Movie Star: Male\n| Henry Cavill\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Choice Summer Movie Star: Female\n| Amy Adams\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Visual Effects Society]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[12th Visual Effects Society Awards|February 12, 2014]]\n| Outstanding Virtual Cinematography in a Live Action Feature Motion Picture\n| Daniel Paulsson, Edmund Kolloen, Joel Prager, David Stripinis\n| {{nom}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"| <ref name=\"VESAwards\"/>\n|-\n| Outstanding FX and Simulation Animation in a Live Action Feature Motion Picture\n| Brian Goodwin, Gray Horsfield, Mathieu Chardonnet, Adrien Toupet\n| {{nom}}\n|}\n\n==Future==\n===DC Extended Universe===\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\nThe success of ''Man of Steel'' started Warner Bros. plans of a cinematic universe featuring other DC Comics characters.
