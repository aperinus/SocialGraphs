The script was written by Knightley's mother, [[Sharman Macdonald]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCartney|first1=Jenny|title=Film reviews: The Edge of Love and Adulthood|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/3554717/Film-reviews-The-Edge-of-Love-and-Adulthood.html|website=The Telegraph|access-date=5 October 2017|date=19 June 2008}}</ref> Originally titled ''The Best Time of Our Lives'', the fictional story concerns Welsh poet [[Dylan Thomas]] (played by Rhys), his wife [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]] (played by Miller) and their married friends, the Killicks (played by Knightley and Murphy). The film premiered at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]].\n\nThe story is loosely based on real events and people, drawing on Rebekah Gilbertson's idea and [[David N. Thomas]]' 2000 book ''Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and a Bungalow''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Matthew Rhys, Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller as Dylan Thomas's Circle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/movies/20edge1.html|website=The New York Times|access-date=5 October 2017|date=19 March 2009}}</ref> He has since written further about Dylan and Vera, highlighting the several deceits in the film that trivialised their friendship. He has described how Dylan and Vera were related as cousins, and the extent to which their families inter-married, farming together as neighbours on the [[Llansteffan]] peninsula in Carmarthenshire.<ref>''Thomas, D.

Although Dylan is now married to Caitlin Macnamara, with whom he has a son, he and Vera rekindle feelings for one another. The two women, initially rivals, become best friends. Drinking heavily in wartime London, the three come to get along.\n\nWilliam Killick, a British Army officer, begins to pursue Vera. Both Vera and Caitlin are intrigued by his steadfast, gallant personality despite its contrasts with Vera's rebelliousness. William notices Vera's closeness to Dylan, but doesn't appear concerned; he and Vera even lend the struggling poet some of their savings. William and Vera fall in love and marry. Soon afterwards, William is called up to fight against the [[German invasion of Greece]] after the Italians [[Greco-Italian War|failed]].\n\nShortly after William's departure, Vera discovers she is pregnant. Upset that motherhood will take away her independence, she contemplates aborting the child but cannot bring herself to do so. She gives birth to a son and moves to the Welsh seashore with Dylan and Caitlin to raise their children in two small neighbouring cottages. Vera and Caitlin's friendship grows stronger while Dylan and Caitlin's marriage becomes distorted by multiple infidelities. Dylan draws Vera into an affair with him.\n\nWilliam returns a captain, scarred by the horrors of the war. Vera notices his emotional distance and instability. William suspects his wife of infidelity and confronts her. Vera confesses to both William and Caitlin, who are furious with her. One evening, while severely inebriated and angry with Dylan's friends for their ignorant remarks on the war, William wanders outside and fires multiple shots into Dylan and Caitlin's home. He does not hit anyone, and Vera calms him down. The next morning, William seems to have returned to his former self. However, he is arrested and taken to trial.\n\nDuring the trial, Dylan testifies against William and distorts the facts, claiming that William was sober and intended to kill Dylan, Caitlin, and their child. The jury finds William innocent of intent to murder. After returning home, William accepts his new role as a father, and he and Vera forgive each other. Their relationship improves. Soon afterwards, Dylan and Caitlin move out of their cottage. During the farewell, Vera restores her friendship with Caitlin, but she never speaks to Dylan again, unable to forgive him for testifying against her husband.\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast included:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theedgeoflove.co.uk|title=The Edge of Love - The Official Movie Website [archived site]|date=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114072142/http://www.theedgeoflove.co.uk/|archive-date=2010-01-14|access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref>\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Vera \n* [[Sienna Miller]] as [[Caitlin Thomas]]\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as William Killick\n* [[Matthew Rhys]] as [[Dylan Thomas]]\n* [[Lisa Stansfield]] as Ruth Williams\n* [[Graham McPherson]] as [[Al Bowlly]]\n* [[Camilla Rutherford]] as Nicolette\n* [[Alastair Mackenzie]] as [[Anthony Devas]]\n* [[Richard Dillane]] as Lt Col David Talbot Rice\n* [[Huw Ceredig]] as John Patrick\n* [[Simon Armstrong]] as Wilfred Hosgood\n* [[Rachel Essex]] as Mel\n* [[Geoffrey Beevers]] as Registrar\n* [[Ben Batt]] as Sergeant\n* [[Paul Brooke]] as Mr. Justice Singleton\n* [[Nick Stringer]] as PC Williams\n* [[Anthony O'Donnell (actor)|Anthony O'Donnell]] as Jack Lloyd\n* [[Rachel Bell]] as Midwife\n* [[Anne Lambton]] as Anita Shenkin\n* [[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]] as Dai Fred\n* [[Richard Clifford (actor)|Richard Clifford]] as Alastair Graham\n* [[Rick Cord]] as ARP warden\n}}\n\n==Distribution==\nThe film made its world premiere opening at the [[Edinburgh Film Festival]] on 18&nbsp;June 2008.
