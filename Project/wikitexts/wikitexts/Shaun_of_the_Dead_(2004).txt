Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden salesman in London who is caught in a [[zombie apocalypse]] with his friend Ed ([[Nick Frost]]). The film co-stars [[Kate Ashfield]], [[Lucy Davis]], [[Dylan Moran]], [[Bill Nighy]], and [[Penelope Wilton]]. It is the first installment in the [[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy|''Three Flavours Cornetto'' trilogy]], followed by ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007) and ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'' (2013).\n\n''Shaun of the Dead'' developed from ideas Pegg and Wright used for their television series ''[[Spaced]]'', particularly an episode where Pegg's slacker character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|''Dead'' films]] directed by [[George A. Romero]]. [[Principal photography]] took place across [[London]] and at [[Ealing Studios]] between May and June 2003.\n\nThe film premiered in London on 29 March 2004 and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with acclaim and commercial success, grossing $30 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the [[British Academy Film Awards]]. It was ranked third on the [[Channel 4]] list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|50 Greatest Comedy Films]] and quickly acquired a [[cult following]]. In [[film studies]], the film is seen as a product of post-[[9/11]] anxiety, as well as a model for transnational comedy. The spread of [[wikt:zombiism|zombiism]] in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Please keep plot summary between 400-700 words per WP:FILMPLOT-->\nIn [[Crouch End]], London, 29-year-old electronics salesman Shaun has no direction in his life. He is disrespected by his colleagues, does not get along with his stepfather, Philip, and is dumped by his girlfriend, Liz, after he fails to make decent plans for a date to celebrate their three-year anniversary. Heartbroken, Shaun gets drunk with Ed, his slacker best friend, at their favourite pub, the Winchester. At home, Shaun and Ed's flatmate, Pete, complains of a bite wound from a mugger and berates Shaun into getting his life together.\n\nBy morning, a [[zombie apocalypse]] has overwhelmed London. Shaun and Ed are slow to notice until they encounter two zombies in their garden, whom they beat to death with a shovel and cricket bat (after several failed attempts using household implements and Shaun's record collection). They devise a plan to rescue Liz and Barbara, Shaun's mother, and then wait out the crisis in the Winchester. They escape in Pete's car and pick up Philip, who has been bitten, and Barbara. After Ed deliberately crashes Pete's car, they use Philip's [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] to pick up Liz and her flatmates, David and Dianne. Philip reconciles with Shaun before Philip becomes a zombie.\n\nForced to abandon the car and their weapons, the group sneak through their London neighbourhood, running into a group led by Shaun's friend, Yvonne. Shaun singlehandedly defends Barbara from a zombie, which he is forced to impale with a [[swingball]] pole. After imitating zombies to get to the Winchester through a horde, a fight between Shaun and Ed attracts the zombies' attention, prompting David to break a window to gain access to the Winchester, thus forcing Shaun to lure them away using himself as bait. After the group takes refuge inside the Winchester, Shaun discovers that the zombies followed him, and Ed unwittingly attracts them by playing on the pub's fruit machine. Whilst fighting the zombified landlord, Shaun discovers that the [[Winchester rifle]] above the bar is functional. Barbara reveals she was bitten, and dies after giving Liz and Shaun's relationship her approval. David attempts to shoot Barbara, but Shaun stops him, causing the group to argue. Shaun accuses David of hating him and being in love with Liz, which Dianne admits. Shaun, distraught, is forced to shoot Barbara when she becomes a zombie. Further fighting ensues after David states that it was right that Shaun shot Barbara.\n\nZombies break into the pub and devour David. Dianne rushes into the horde brandishing David's severed leg. The zombified Pete appears and bites Ed, and Shaun shoots and kills Pete. Shaun, Liz, and Ed take cover behind the bar, which Shaun sets ablaze. The three take refuge in the cellar. Realising they only have two bullets left, Shaun and Liz contemplate suicide while Ed elects to be devoured by the zombies. Shaun discovers a keg lift that opens out onto the street, and Ed volunteers to stay with the rifle as the zombies break in. The [[British Army]] arrive, with Yvonne in tow, gun down the horde and take Shaun and Liz to safety.\n\nSix months later, civilisation has returned to normal, and surviving zombies are used as cheap labour and entertainment. Liz has moved in with Shaun, and Shaun keeps the zombified Ed tethered in his shed, where they play video games together.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Shaun\n* [[Nick Frost]] as Ed\n* [[Kate Ashfield]] as Liz\n* [[Lucy Davis]] as Dianne\n* [[Dylan Moran]] as David\n* [[Penelope Wilton]] as Barbara\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Philip\n* [[Jessica Hynes|Jessica Stevenson]] as Yvonne\n* [[Peter Serafinowicz]] as Pete\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as Noel\n* [[Martin Freeman]] as Declan\n* [[Reece Shearsmith]] as Mark\n* [[Tamsin Greig]] as Maggie\n* [[Julia Deakin]] as Yvonne's mum\n* [[Matt Lucas]] as Cousin Tom\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception and writing===\n[[File:Edgar Wright &amp; Simon Pegg.jpg|thumb|right|Screenwriters Edgar Wright (left) and Simon Pegg in 2013.]]\n{{quote box|One evening, I was round at Simon [Pegg] and his pal Nick Frost's flat for drinks when I said we should make our own zombie movie, a horror comedy.

He considered the lack of firearms typical of American zombie movies, and his experience of the dazed early-morning walk to the shop turned into a scene in the film where Shaun does the same thing.<ref name=\"guardian2020\" /> Another influence from Wright's life came from how he missed the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic]] by simply not having paid attention to the news for a fortnight, turning his television on one day to see cattle being burnt, leaving him confused. Because of this, he said \"it's plausible that the world could be ending and these two guys could be the last to know\" as they also skip over the news on television in the film.<ref name=\":8\" /> The gag about Shaun and Ed spending all their time at the Winchester also comes from the actors' lives, as Pegg and Frost \"always used to go to the same bar all the time\", according to Wright, who had been trying to convince them not to.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe [[screenplay]] was written by Wright and Pegg in eight weeks.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kerry L|title='Shaun Of The Dead': The World's First Rom-Zom-Com (Romantic Zombie Comedy)?|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1491298/shaun-of-the-dead-the-worlds-first-rom-zom-com-romantic-zombie-comedy/|access-date=2020-06-25|website=MTV News|archive-date=26 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200626105939/http://www.mtv.com/news/1491298/shaun-of-the-dead-the-worlds-first-rom-zom-com-romantic-zombie-comedy/|url-status=live}}</ref> They were inspired by films including ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968) and ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978), as well as ''[[Raising Arizona]]'' (1987), ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985), ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/movies/19kehr.html|title=The British Zombie Buddy Flick|website=[[The New York Times]]|last=Kehr|first=Dave|date=19 September 2004|access-date=12 February 2008|archive-date=16 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616155039/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/movies/19kehr.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ugo\">{{cite web|title=Simon Pegg of Shaun of the Dead (Rogue Pictures) Interview|url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/shaunofthedead/simonpegg.asp|last=Epstein|first=Daniel Robert|website=Under Ground Online|access-date=12 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216181040/http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/shaunofthedead/simonpegg.asp|archive-date=16 February 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"blackfilm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blackfilm.com/20040917/features/simonpegg.shtml|title=Shaun of the Dead: An Interview with Simon Pegg|website=Blackfilm.com|date=September 2004|access-date=12 February 2008|archive-date=11 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211110805/http://www.blackfilm.com/20040917/features/simonpegg.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Pegg |first=Simon |title=Nerd Do Well: A Small Boy's Journey to Becoming a Big Kid |date=5 June 2012 |publisher=[[Avery Publishing]] |isbn=9781592407194}}</ref> The actors met three weeks before filming began for read-throughs, where they also made changes to the script.<ref name=\"blackfilm\" /> According to Pegg, the script has a set structure, with certain lines and actions being repeated throughout the film, making improvisation harder.

Romero from the [[De Wolfe Music|De Wolfe]] [[production music]] library.<ref>Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg commentary, Shaun of the Dead (DVD). Universal Pictures</ref> A friend of the assistant editor on the film had been compiling music library tracks from zombie films, making finding some music for the film much easier.<ref name=\":9\" /> Before production began on the film, Wright and Pegg had created a mixtape of songs they wanted to use.<ref name=\":8\" /> The Goblin music, though, was used as a [[temp track]] by Wright in editing; he liked the feel of it so much they decided to get the clearance to use it.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nBobby Olivier of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' attributes the initial rebirth of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\" to its appearance in the film, which \"introduced it to a new generation of listeners\", saying: \"Perhaps the most famous scene from ''Shaun of the Dead'' features \"Don't Stop Me Now\" which blares from a pub jukebox while stars Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield bash a zombie with pool cues to the song's hurtling beat\".<ref name=\"Billboard 2019\">{{cite news|title=The Evolution of Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now': How a Minor Hit Became One of The Band's Most Beloved (And Inescapable) Songs|magazine=Billboard|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8501348/queen-dont-stop-me-now-biggest-hits|url-status=live|access-date=22 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528073855/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8501348/queen-dont-stop-me-now-biggest-hits|archive-date=28 May 2019}}</ref> The moment had been Wright's idea, as he loves Queen and \"had the idea of playing Don't Stop Me Now \u2013 one of the most positive, exciting, happy tunes ever \u2013 over a scene of extreme violence\".<ref name=guardian2020/> Pegg explained that the fight in the pub was choreographed to the song even before it had been cleared to be used in the film, so they wrote to [[Brian May]] and begged to use it.<ref name=guardian2020/>\n\nThe other choreographed sequence, near the start of the film, used different music to that which it had been set to. The original was a [[Cornelius (musician)|Cornelius]] song, and had been the track written in for the scene from the screenplay. Wright then heard the song used in the film, by [[I Monster]], when editing, and felt that it worked better.
