The screenplay by Carol Doyle is based on the [[Washington Square (novel)|1880 novel of the same name]] by [[Henry James]], which was filmed as ''[[The Heiress]]'' in 1949. The film was a critical success but a commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Austin Sloper is a doctor and resident of a large house on New York's [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]]. His wife dies in childbirth, leaving a daughter, Catherine, to be raised by her father. As a child, Catherine is overweight, clumsy, and untalented; however, she is also a sweet, affectionate child. She adores her father and tries hard to please him, but he considers her a disappointment and treats her with ironic condescension. His thoughts are still much occupied with his beloved wife and with a promising son who died before Catherine was born, and he privately &ndash; but bitterly &ndash; resents his only surviving child for causing his wife's death.\n\nNow the 1850s, Sloper invites Catherine's widowed aunt, the incurably foolish Lavinia Penniman, to live at Washington Square as a chaperone for Catherine. Catherine becomes a plain young woman who is painfully shy and inept in the social graces expected of someone of her class, despite her aunt's best efforts to instill them. Apart from her sweet nature, Catherine possesses only one obvious attraction: wealth. She earns $10,000 annually from her mother's estate, and will inherit considerably more when her father dies.\n\nAt a party celebrating her cousin Marian Almond's engagement, Catherine is introduced to a handsome, charming young man named Morris Townsend. He is attentive, respectful, and &ndash; to Catherine's obvious astonishment &ndash; clearly interested in her. He begins paying regular calls at Washington Square. Before long, the susceptible Catherine falls headlong in love with him. Sloper, however, suspects Townsend of being a fortune hunter, with no intention of pursuing a career. Aunt Lavinia loves melodrama and gets a vicarious thrill from Townsend's attentions; and so, contrary to Sloper's wishes, she does all she can to encourage the relationship, even meeting Townsend secretly to collude with him.\n\nTownsend proposes marriage and Sloper refuses to give his consent, telling Catherine he will disinherit her if she marries without it. Catherine doesn't care about the money, but disobeying her father is another matter. She dutifully accompanies Sloper on a [[Grand Tour]] of Europe, during which he exhorts her to give Townsend up; she refuses, and a frustrated Sloper speaks to her with such contempt that she finally admits to herself that he despises her. The realization pains her deeply, but also strengthens her resolve to separate herself from him and bestow all her love and loyalty on Townsend.\n\nCatherine comes home, determined to marry. When she and Morris are reunited, she convinces him that her father will never relent. Shortly afterward, he backs out of the relationship. When Catherine tearfully confronts him, he admits his mercenary motives outright.\n\nYears pass and Catherine has refused at least one respectable offer of marriage. When her father's health fails, she nurses him through his last illness. During his final days, he asks her to promise never to marry Morris Townsend. With quiet dignity, she replies that while she seldom thinks of Townsend, she can't make such a promise. Sloper misunderstands her and alters his [[Will (law)|will]], adding a [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] deploring his daughter's ongoing interest in unscrupulous young men and leaving most of his $300,000 fortune to charity. Catherine is left with only the house and the income from her mother. She isn't offended by the codicil; in fact, at the reading of the will, she laughs.\n\nSome time later, Townsend reappears at her doorstep. Catherine, who is now running a daycare center in her house, talks to him briefly. She isn't angry, but she has no interest in renewing their relationship, and tells him so, quietly and firmly. He departs, leaving Catherine to reflect on the passion she once experienced.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Catherine Sloper\n** Sara Ruzicka as 11-year-old Catherine\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Dr. Austin Sloper\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as Morris Townsend\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as Aunt Lavinia\n* [[Judith Ivey]] as Aunt Elizabeth Almond\n* Arthur Laupus as Mr. Almond\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Marian Almond\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Arthur Townsend\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Mrs. Montgomery\n* Nancy Daly as Maureen\n* Marie Abate as Agnes\n* Sara Constance Marshall as Therese\n* Rachel Layne Sacrey as Sarah Almond\n* Rachel Osborne as Alice Almond\n* [[Scott Jaeck]] as John Ludlow\n* Peter Maloney as Jacob Webber\n* Lauren Hulsey as Edith\n* Loretto McNally as Midwife\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nBaltimore's historic [[Union Square (Baltimore)|Union Square]] served as the film's eponymous 19th-century New York City setting.

Quite faithful to the novel but imbued with something of a feminist twist, Agnieszka Holland's handsome picture captures the ambiguity of this 19th-century tale about a plain young woman's deception by a seductive fortune hunter, but misses the full measure of its acute psychological precision and bitter irony...Also problematic is Holland's cinematic approach, which in its less-than-graceful camera scheme and often arbitrary interaction of shots represents nothing close to the visual correlative of James' cool, refined, utterly precise literary style. The story is so good that it retains a reasonable amount of its force, but the rather scattershot and sometimes overheated treatment here is, in fact, not especially well suited to it.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/washington-square-1117329496/|title=Washington Square|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|author-link=Todd McCarthy|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=September 21, 1997|access-date=March 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\nEdward Guthmann of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' described the film as \"meticulous,\" Jennifer Jason Leigh as \"very good,\" and Albert Finney as \"specific and effective.\" Of Maggie Smith, he said, she \"indulges in blatant scene-stealing as Catherine's fussbudget Aunt Lavinia, but the merriment with which she commits her crimes makes it easy to forgive her.\" He added \"Even with its merits, ''Washington Square'' runs too long and ends with an ambiguous look from Leigh that feels like a bit of tagged-on feminism by Holland...Moreover, coming as it does on the heels of so many chaste [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant-Ivory]] costumers and all the other well-appointed adaptations of [[Jane Austen]], [[Edith Wharton]] and [[E.M.
