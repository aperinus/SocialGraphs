'''Yang Tianqing''' ([[Li Baotian]]) is returning from a trek to sell silk for his adoptive uncle, '''Yang Jinshan''' ([[Li Wei (actor)|Li Wei]]). Jinshan, whose trade is dyeing fabrics, is known for his cruelty. After Tianqing returns, another worker is fired by Jinshan. While going away this worker informs Tianqing that Jinshan has recently purchased a new wife, having beaten two previous wives to death after they failed to produce a son, the cruel irony being that Jinshan is in fact [[impotent]].\n\nUpon meeting the wife, '''Ju Dou''' ([[Gong Li]]), Tianqing is enamored with her. At night, Jinshan tortures Ju Dou. Tianqing discovers Ju Dou's bathing area and spies on her. He does not know that Ju Dou knows he is there. Although Tianqing watches luridly at first, Ju Dou transforms the meaning of his gaze by exposing her bruises and sobbing, forcing him to see her as a human being rather than just a sexual object.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zhang Yimou: Globalization and the Subject of Culture|last=Larson|first=Wendy|publisher=Cambria Press|year=2017|isbn=9781604979756|location=Amherst, New York|pages=77\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nSoon, the two are unable to control their passion any longer and engage in sex. When Ju Dou discovers she is pregnant with Tianqing's child, she and Tianqing pretend that the child is Jinshan's. Jinshan suffers a stroke that leaves him paralyzed from the waist down. After Ju Dou tells him the child is not his, he attempts to kill the child and burn down the house. Tianqing ties up Jinshan and hoists him in a barrel, leaving him dangling helplessly, a bitter bystander to his usurpation. Knowing that society would never accept her infidelity, Ju Dou goes to a nunnery to terminate another pregnancy. Jinshan continues to influence the life of the child he named Tianbai and when the child calls Jinshan \"Father,\" Jinshan accepts this as psychological revenge on his wife and nephew. One day, Jinshan falls into the dye vat and drowns and a funeral is held for him.\n\nSeven years later, Ju Dou and Tianqing still run the dye operation but Tianbai (Zheng Ji'an) is now a rage-filled teenager. Rumors of his parents' infidelities drive him to nearly kill a local gossiper. Ju Dou reveals the truth to her son in a fit of rage. She and Tianqing decide to have one last affair and grow weak after falling asleep in a cellar with little air. Upon discovering his parents resting in the cellar after their tryst, Tianbai drags them out - still weak and unable to awaken - and drowns Tianqing. Ju Dou then burns the mill down as the film ends.\n\n==Adaptation==\nIn the original novel Tianqing is the biological nephew of Jinshan and the story itself is about [[incest]] by affinity. The makers of the film version decided not to use the incest angle. In the film, Tianqing and Jinshan are not biologically related, and Ju Dou only begins her relationship with Tianqing after learning that he and Jinshan are not related.<ref name=Gatewardp159/>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gong Li]], as '''Ju Dou''' (S: \u83ca\u8c46, T: \u83ca\u8373, P: ''J\u00fa D\u00f2u'');\n*[[Li Baotian]], as '''Yang Tianqing''' (S: \u6768\u5929\u9752, T: \u694a\u5929\u9752, P: ''Y\u00e1ng Ti\u0101nq\u012bng''), Ju Dou's lover and Yang Jinshan's adopted nephew;\n*[[Li Wei (actor)|Li Wei]], as '''Yang Jinshan''' (S: \u6768\u91d1\u5c71, T: \u694a\u91d1\u5c71, P: ''Y\u00e1ng J\u012bnsh\u0101n''), the owner of the dye mill and Ju Dou's husband;\n*Yi Zhang, as '''Yang Tianbai''' (S: \u6768\u5929\u767d, T: \u694a\u5929\u767d, P: ''Y\u00e1ng Ti\u0101nb\u00e1i'') as a child; Ju Dou and Tianqing's son;\n*Zheng Ji'an, as '''Tianbai''' as a youth.\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Ju Dou'' was released by [[Miramax Films]] in March 1991.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1996|p=239}}\n\n===Awards===\n*[[1990 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], [[1990 in film|1990]]\n**Luis Bu\u00f1uel Special Award\n**[[Palme d'Or]] (nominated)<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/175/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Ju Dou |access-date=2009-08-05|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n*[[Valladolid International Film Festival]], [[1990 in film|1990]]\n**Golden Spike\n*[[Chicago International Film Festival]], [[1990 in film|1990]]\n**Gold Hugo\n*[[Norwegian International Film Festival]], [[1990 in film|1990]]\n**Best Foreign Feature Film (Amanda)\n*[[63rd Academy Awards]], [[1991 in film|1991]]\n**[[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] (nominated)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNLiOcFJBeQ \"Journey of Hope\" Wins Foreign Language Film: 1991 Oscars]</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n* ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' 100 Best Chinese Mainland Films \u2013 #21<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutbeijing.com/features/Books__Film-Interviews__Features/28696/100-best-Chinese-Mainland-Films-the-countdown/9/30-21.html|title=100 best Chinese Mainland Films|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n* Included in ''[[The New York Times]]'''s list of The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made in 2004<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html|title=The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==DVD release==\n''Ju Dou'' was initially released on DVD in the United States as an all-region disc on the [[Pioneer (company)|Pioneer]] label, [[Geneon|Geneon Entertainment]], on June 29, 1999.
