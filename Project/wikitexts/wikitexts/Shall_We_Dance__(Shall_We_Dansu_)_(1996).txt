Its title refers to the song \"[[Shall We Dance? (1951 song)|Shall We Dance?]]\" which comes from [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[The King and I]]''. It inspired the 2004 English-language [[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|remake of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a close-up of the inscription above the stage in the ballroom of the [[Blackpool Tower]]: \"Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear\", from the poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]]. As the camera pans around the ballroom giving a view of the dancers, a voice-over explains that in Japan, ballroom dancing is treated with suspicion.\n\nSuccessful ''[[salaryman]]'' Shohei Sugiyama ([[K\u014dji Yakusho]]) has a house in the suburbs, a devoted wife, Masako (Hideko Hara), and a teenage daughter, Chikage (Ayano Nakamura), and works as an accountant for a firm in [[Tokyo]]. Despite these external signs of success, however, Shohei begins to feel as if his life has lost direction and meaning and falls into [[Depression (mood)|depression]].\n\nOne night, while coming home on the [[Seibu Ikebukuro Line]], he spots a beautiful woman with a melancholic expression looking out from a window in a dance studio: Mai Kishikawa ([[Tamiyo Kusakari]]), a well-known figure on the Western [[ballroom dance]] circuit. Becoming infatuated with her, he decides to take lessons in order to get to know her better.\n\nShohei's life changes once his classes begin. Rather than Mai, his teacher is an older woman, Tamako Tamura ([[Reiko Kusamura]]), who becomes an important mentor to him. He meets his classmates: T\u014dkichi Hattori ([[Yu Tokui]]) who joined to impress his wife, and Masahiro Tanaka (Hiromasa Taguchi) who joined to lose weight. He also meets Toyoko Takahashi ([[Eri Watanabe|Eriko Watanabe]]), another student. He further discovers that one of his colleagues from work, Tomio Aoki ([[Takenaka Naoto|Naoto Takenaka]]), frequents the dance studio. Tomio, who is balding and mocked at work for his rigid ways, is revealed to be secretly a long-haired (via a wig) ballroom dancer. Though distant from her, the classes increase his infatuation for Mai. His secret thus becomes twofold: not only must he hide the lessons from his wife, he must also hide them from his friends and colleagues as it is considered embarrassing according to traditional [[Customs and etiquette of Japan|Japanese customs]] to participate in Western [[ballroom dance]].\n\nLater, after being rebuffed by Mai, Shohei discovers to his surprise that his passion for ballroom dance outweighs his infatuation with her. Indeed, dancing, rather than Mai, gives Shohei the meaning in life that he was looking for.\n\nMasako, noticing his odd behavior, believes he is having an affair, prompting her to hire a private detective to follow him. Meanwhile, along with his classmates, Shohei enters an amateur competition, only to find out that his wife, having finally learned the truth from the detective (who has now become a devoted fan of ballroom dancing), is in the audience. Surprised by this, he stumbles and nearly knocks his dance partner to the floor. Though he successfully catches her, he accidentally rips the skirt of her dress off. Both leave the contest, later learning that Tomio won. When Tomio is ridiculed at work after his colleagues read of his success in the newspaper, Shohei stands up and tells them not to mock something they don't understand.\n\nAt home, Shohei's wife tries to understand her husband's new passion by asking him to teach her to dance as well. He is invited to a farewell party for Mai, who is leaving for [[Blackpool]]. At the party, Mai joins him to dance, asking him \"Shall we dance?\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[K\u014dji Yakusho]] as Shohei Sugiyama\n* [[Tamiyo Kusakari]] as Mai Kishikawa\n* [[Naoto Takenaka]] as Tomio Aoki\n* [[Eri Watanabe|Eriko Watanabe]] as Toyoko Takahashi \n* [[Yu Tokui]] as Tokichi Hattori\n* Hiromasa Taguchi as Masahiro Tanaka\n* [[Reiko Kusamura]] as Tamako Tamura\n* Hideko Hara as Masako Sugiyama\n* Hiroshi Miyasaka as Macho\n* Kunihiko Ida as Teiji Kaneko\n* Amie Toujou as Hisako Honda\n* [[Ayano Nakamura]] as Chikage Sugiyama\n* Katsunari Mineno as Keiri-kacho\n* [[Tomiko Ishii]] as Haruko Haraguchi\n* [[Masahiro Motoki]] as Hiromasa Kimoto\n\n==Release==\n''Shall We Dance?'' was released on January 27, 1996 in Japan where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=393}} It was released in the United States by [[Miramax]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=393}} The Miramax version was cut to 118 minutes and released on July 4, 1997.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=393}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn Japan, it earned a distribution income ([[Gross rental|rentals]]) of {{JPY|1.6 billion}} in 1996, making it the second [[List of highest-grossing Japanese live-action films|top-grossing Japanese film]] of the year, after ''[[Godzilla vs. Destoroyah]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=1996\u5e74\uff081\u6708\uff5e12\u6708\uff09 |url=http://www.eiren.org/toukei/1996.html |website=Eiren |publisher=Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan |access-date=1 February 2019}}</ref> ''Shall We Dance?'' grossed a total Japanese box office revenue of {{JPY|2.72 billion}}<ref name=\"databank\">{{cite web |title=\u90a6\u753b\u8208\u884c\u53ce\u5165\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 |url=http://www.generalworks.com/databank/movie/rank04.html |website=SF MOVIE DataBank |publisher=General Works |access-date=19 February 2019}}</ref> ({{US$|{{#expr:2720/108.779 round 1}} million|long=no}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) - Japan |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1996&locations=JP&start=1995 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1996 |access-date=9 May 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film performed strongly in [[United States|American]] theaters, earning {{US$|9.7 million|long=no}} during its US release.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Balio |first1=Tino |title=The Foreign Film Renaissance on American Screens, 1946\u20131973 |date=2010 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]] |isbn=9780299247935 |page=304 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-EXBGEdjMIC&pg=PA304}}</ref> Outside of the United States, the film grossed $33,287,618 internationally in other territories (including Japan),<ref>{{cite web |title=Shall We Dansu?
