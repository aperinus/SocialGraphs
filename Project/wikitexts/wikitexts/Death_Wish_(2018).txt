It is a remake of the [[Death Wish (1974 film)|1974 film of the same name]] (which originated the [[Death Wish (film series)|''Death Wish'' franchise]]), based on [[Brian Garfield]]'s [[Death Wish (novel)|1972 novel]]. The film stars [[Bruce Willis]] as Paul Kersey, a [[Chicago]] doctor who sets out to get revenge on the men who attacked his family. [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Elisabeth Shue]], [[Dean Norris]], and [[Kimberly Elise]] also star.\n\nA remake of the 1974 film was first announced in 2006, with [[Sylvester Stallone]] set to direct and star, before dropping out. Carnahan was announced to write and direct after in 2012, but later dropped out too, although was given sole screenwriting credit despite his script being rewritten numerous times since. Roth joined as director in 2016, with filming taking place in Chicago that same year with director of photography [[Rogier Stoffers]]. [[Mark Goldblatt]] served as editor in post-production, while the score was composed by [[Ludwig G\u00f6ransson]].\n\n''Death Wish'' was released in the United States by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on March 2, 2018, and [[Box-office bomb|underperformed at the box office]], only grossing $49.6 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2018's Biggest Box Office Bombs, From 'Gotti' to 'Solo' |url=https://www.thewrap.com/10-biggest-box-office-bombs-of-2018-from-london-fields-to-solo-photos/ |access-date=July 21, 2022 |website=The Wrap|date=December 12, 2018 }}</ref> The film received generally negative reviews from critics; many criticizing its depiction of gun violence in comparison to then-recent mass shootings, claiming it as spreading \"right-wing\" and \"pro-gun\" messages, with Roth denying said claims.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Trauma surgery|Trauma surgeon]] Paul Kersey lives with his wife, Lucy, and daughter, Jordan, in [[Chicago]]. When the family visits a restaurant with Paul's brother Frank, Miguel the valet secretly copies their address after hearing that they plan to stay out. However, Paul is suddenly called to the hospital, and Jordan and Lucy return home just as three armed criminals break in, leading to Lucy being killed and Jordan left in a coma from being severely beaten.\n\nPaul becomes frustrated with the lack of police progress on the case, contemplating purchasing a firearm. When a gang member is brought to the hospital and his gun falls out, Paul secretly takes it and practices shooting. He later uses it to stop a carjacking, injuring his left hand in the process. A captured video of the carjacking goes viral, earning Paul the nickname \"Grim Reaper\". After treating a boy who was attacked for refusing to sell drugs for a dealer calling himself the \"Ice Cream Man\", Paul guns him down in broad daylight.\n\nNews reports consistently demonstrate divided opinions of support and condemnation of Paul's developing war against violent criminals. After realizing that one of his deceased patients is Miguel, Paul takes his phone, leading him to a liquor store which [[Fence (criminal)|fences]] stolen goods. The owner, Ponytail, recognizes Paul and messages another criminal, Fish. Fish sneaks in and accidentally kills Ponytail while trying to shoot Paul. Fish identifies the second member of the group, Joe, before Paul kills him. The cops visit Paul to discuss the case; afterwards, he destroys the phones to cover his tracks. Finding Joe at an auto body shop, he tortures him. Joe divulges that the third robber, Knox, murdered Lucy, before Paul kills him.\n\nKnox calls Paul, arranging to meet in a nightclub bathroom where they exchange fire and wound each other. Paul gets away while Knox goes to the police and gives them a physical description of Paul. Arriving home, Paul is confronted by Frank, who then answers the front door and is questioned by the detectives of his brother's whereabouts. During the intervention, the hospital calls to tell Paul that Jordan has regained consciousness.\n\nA week later, Paul leaves the hospital with Jordan as Knox cases his house for an ambush. Paul glimpses a man running across the lawn and orders Jordan to hide and call the police. After killing Knox's men, Paul is shot and wounded by Knox, but manages to pull out a hidden rifle he purchased earlier and kills him. The police arrive and accept Paul's story after he hints he is done with vigilantism.\n\nMonths later, Paul drops off Jordan at [[New York University]]. Spotting a man stealing a bag from a bellhop, he calls out and points a [[finger gun]] at him.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per closing tombstone credits, five more and all roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as Dr. Paul Kersey/the Chicago grim reaper a trauma surgeon turned vigilante\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Frank Kersey, Paul's brother\n* [[Elisabeth Shue]] as Lucy Kersey, Paul's wife\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Detective Kevin Raines\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Knox\n* [[Kimberly Elise]] as Detective Leonore Jackson\n* Stephanie Janusauskas as Sophie\n* [[Camila Morrone]] as Jordan Kersey, Paul and Lucy's daughter\n* [[Jack Kesy]] as Tate \"The Fish\" Karp\n* [[Ronnie Gene Blevins]] as Joe\n* [[Len Cariou]] as Ben, Paul's father-in-law\n* [[Kirby Bliss Blanton]] as Bethany\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Dr. Jill Klavens\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Dr. Chris Salgado, Paul's coworker\n* [[Luis Oliva (Guatemalan actor)|Luis Oliva]] as Miguel\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment on the film began already back in 2006, when [[Sylvester Stallone]] announced that he would be directing and starring in a remake of ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'' (1974).
