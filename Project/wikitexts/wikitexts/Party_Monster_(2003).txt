It stars [[Macaulay Culkin]] as the drug-addled \"king of the [[Club Kids]]\". The film tells the story of the rise and fall of the infamous [[New York City]] party promoter [[Michael Alig]]. This was Macaulay Culkin's first film in nearly nine years since his starring role in the 1994 film ''[[Richie Rich (film)|Richie Rich]]''.\n\nBased on ''[[Disco Bloodbath]]'', the memoir of [[James St. James]] which details his friendship with Alig, that later fell apart as Alig's drug [[addiction]] worsened, and ended after he murdered [[Andre Melendez|Andre \"Angel\" Melendez]] and went to prison, it was followed by a 1998 [[Documentary film|documentary]] on the murder, also called ''[[Party Monster: The Shockumentary]]'', in which certain elements of the film were used.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with Michael Alig as a small-town outcast who lived with his mom before moving to New York. Michael learns the New York party scene from James St. James, who teaches him the \"rules of fabulousness\", which mostly revolve around attracting as much attention to oneself as possible.\n\nDespite James' warning, Alig hosts a party at [[The Limelight]], a local club owned by [[Peter Gatien]]. With Alig as its main attraction, The Limelight soon becomes the hottest club in New York. Alig is named \"King of the Club Kids\" and goes on a cross country journey in search of more club kids. Alig and James pick up Angel Melendez, Gitsie, and Brooke. Gitsie becomes Michael's latest sidekick although the movie implies the relationship was little more than platonic. However, after Michael descends further into [[substance abuse|drug abuse]], his life starts to spiral out of control, eventually culminating in his involvement in the murder of Angel. Gitsie and Michael decide to go to rehab but ultimately return to NY with the same drug problems as before, causing Michael to lose his job and end up in a motel in New Jersey where he is arrested and sent to prison after being ousted by James. James then begins to write his \"[[Great American Novel]]\", published first as ''Disco Bloodbath'' and later as ''Party Monster''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as [[Michael Alig]]\n** Brendan O'Malley as Young Michael Alig\n* [[Seth Green]] as [[James St. James|James Clark/James St. James]]\n** Dillon Woolley as Young James Clark\n* Justin Hagan as Robert \"Freez\" Riggs\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as Elke Alig\n* [[Dylan McDermott]] as [[Peter Gatien]]\n* [[Wilson Cruz]] as [[Andre Melendez|Andre \"Angel\" Melendez]]\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as [[DJ Keoki|Superstar DJ Keoki]]\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Gitsie\n* [[Marilyn Manson]] as Christina Superstar\n* [[Mia Kirshner]] as Natasha Gatien\n* [[Daniel Franzese]] as The Rat/Clara The Carefree Chicken/Icy The Polar Bear/Dallas MC\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Brooke\n* [[John Stamos]] as Talk Show Host\n* [[Amanda Lepore]] (''uncredited'') as herself\n* [[Richie Rich (designer)|Richie Rich]] (''uncredited'') as himself\n* [[Armen Ra]] musician as himself\n}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack peaked at number 21 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Dance/Electronic Albums]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Charts & Awards - Party Monster \u2013 Various Artists|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r656368/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2011-04-13|year=2003}}</ref>\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Kellman|first=Andy|title=Party Monster \u2013 Various Artists|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r656368|pure_url=yes}}|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2011-04-13|year=2003}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Artist\n| title1 = Take Me to the Club\n| extra1 = Mannequin\n| length1 = 3:36\n| title2 = [[Seventeen (Ladytron song)|Seventeen]]\n| extra2 = [[Ladytron]]\n| length2 = 3:31\n| title3 = [[Frank Sinatra (Miss Kittin & The Hacker song)|Frank Sinatra]]\n| extra3 = [[Miss Kittin]] & [[The Hacker]]\n| length3 = 3:53\n| title4 = [[Money, Success, Fame, Glamour]]\n| extra4 = [[Felix da Housecat]] vs. Pop Tarts\n| length4 = 3:23\n| title5 = You're My Disco\n| note5 = [[Fischerspooner]] Remix\n| extra5 = Waldorf\n| length5 = 4:26\n| title6 = [[Two of Hearts (song)|Two of Hearts]]\n| extra6 = [[Stacey Q]]\n| length6 = 3:36\n| title7 = Overdose\n| extra7 = [[Tomcraft]]\n| length7 = 2:57\n| title8 = Get Happy\n| extra8 = Happy Thought Hall\n| length8 = 3:28\n| title9 = La Rock 01\n| extra9 = [[Vitalic]]\n| length9 = 3:05\n| title10 = [[Go!
