Fox]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe opening introduces O.W. Grant, who carries a pipe in the shape of a monkey-head. He demonstrates his mysterious powers in an encounter with a businessman, when granting the man's wish results in the businessman being hit by a truck. O.W. Grant stands for One Wish Grant.\n\nNeal Oliver aspires to be an artist, despite the lack of support from his domineering father and analytical girlfriend. At a party for his 22nd birthday, O.W. Grant is the waiter who serves the cake. After Neal blows out the candles, he says he wished for an answer to his life. His father responds by handing him an admission letter to law school. As the family goes outside to look at the red convertible that Neal's dad bought him, a bucket falls onto Neal's head, knocking him out.\n\nNeal wakes up in the hospital, where a doctor named Ray comes in and does a quick sight test using playing cards. Neal has to name the suit on the cards. Neal asks if he got it right, and Ray points out that the cards actually had red spades and black hearts, emphasizing that things aren't always what they seem.\n\nAfter getting out of the hospital, Neal sees the mystery woman that he's been dreaming about in a billboard advertisement, but the billboard company insists that the billboard is blank. When Neal checks the billboard, he sees a new picture of the beautiful blonde, this time with a framed inscription \"Call 555-1300\". Neal calls the number, and a recorded message tells him that he has an appointment at 555 Olive Street, Suite 1300.\n\nAt the appointment, he again meets Ray, who gives him a package to deliver to a Robin Fields in a town called Danver in Colorado (not \"[[Denver]]\"). Ray tells him that he'll find Danver by taking Interstate 60.\n\nWith no Interstate 60 on the roadmap, Neal sets out west and encounters O.W. Grant on the roadside. Grant gives Neal directions to the unlisted Interstate 60, and on his journey, Neal meets various characters including a man who can consume unnatural quantities of food and drink; a promiscuous woman looking for perfect sex; a lonely mother looking for her son, who is living in a city where the population is addicted to a government-controlled drug; a dying ex-advertiser who is on a crusade to punish dishonesty; and Mrs. James, who runs the Museum of Art Fraud that actually contains real masterpieces posing as fakes.\n\nWhen Neal reaches the town of Morlaw, where all citizens are lawyers who spend their days suing each other, he finally finds Lynn, the imprisoned mystery woman he has been dreaming about and painting. Lynn explains that she met O.W. Grant and wished to find the right guy. They spend the night together at the \"Fork in the Road\" motel. Neal also makes a painting of the motel. Neal leaves to deliver the package in Danver, while Lynn stays behind.\n\nOn the radio, Neal hears a report of a reported murderer on the loose, and the description matches his car. He abandons his vehicle to hitchhike. Arriving in Danver, Neal meets \"Robin Fields\", who turns out to be O.W. Grant. After opening the package (which holds a replacement monkey-head pipe for O.W.'s broken one), Grant uses his magic powers to \"warp\" Neal back in time, where he wakes up in the hospital before he first encountered Ray.\n\nLeaving the hospital, Neal confronts his father and asserts his right to live his life without his father's interference. His sister takes him to an art gallery where Neal sees his painting of the \"Fork in the Road\". A girl who resembles Lynn talks to him about commissioning him to do a series of paintings on roadside motels and diners.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Marsden]] as Neal Oliver\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as O.W. Grant\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Lynn Linden\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Ray\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Bob Cody\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Captain Ives\n* [[Michael J. Fox]] as Mr. Baker\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Mrs. James\n* [[Amy Jo Johnson]] as Laura\n* [[Art Evans (actor)|Art Evans]] as Otis\n* John Bourgeois as Daniel Oliver, Neal's Father\n* Roz Michaels as Marlene Oliver, Neal's Mother\n* [[Wayne Robson]] as \"Deep Stomach\"\n* Amy Stewart as Nancy Oliver, Neal's Sister\n* [[Rebecca Jenkins]] as Susan Ross\n* [[Tyler Kyte]] as Philip Ross\n* [[Deborah Odell]] as Valerie McCabe\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\n====Deleted scenes====\nThe DVD includes several deleted scenes and the \"bridges\" where they would be placed in the film. They include:\n\n* Neal visits an AAA office where he seeks information about Interstate 60 that the service representative repeatedly tells him does not exist. The man explains the American [[Interstate Highway System]] to Neal. Neal discovers that if I-60 did exist, it would be oriented west to east and be north of [[Interstate 40]] and south of [[Interstate 70]].\n* When told by the man in the bar about O. W. Grant at the film's beginning, a waitress tells Neal that she had never seen the man before but he had won a large amount of bets by consuming large quantities of alcohol in a brief time without throwing up or urinating. This is the same man who appears later in a diner and makes similar bets that he can eat large amounts of food without releasing them through similar processes. The man admitted he acquired this quality through a wish from O.W. Grant but did not enjoy it, because in addition to being ''able'' to eat without stopping, he now ''must'' do so to avoid starving.\n* Neal meets his father in his office saying that he doesn't want to be in a pigeon hole. His father says that everyone in the world is in a pigeon hole, even starving artists; there are good pigeon holes and bad pigeon holes so it is better to be in a good one.\n* At the beginning of his road journey, Neal receives a call on his car phone but shuts it off narrating that the only freedom left in the 21st Century is to be incommunicado.\n* After leaving the hospital at the end of the film, Neal breaks up with his girlfriend who calls him a loser and that artists starving for their work only exist in the previous century.\n\n==Reception==\nRobert Koehler, writing in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]],'' criticized the film's \"juvenile obviousness\" and says the themes do not feel genuine.<ref>{{cite web | last=Koehler | first=Robert |  title=Interstate 60 | website=Variety | date=November 6, 2002 | url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/interstate-60-1200545004/ | access-date=2020-12-18}}</ref>\n\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] lists 4 reviews, <!-- no overall score unless 5 reviews -->and reports 3 positive and 1 negative review.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title = Interstate 60 (2002) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/interstate_60/ |website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date = November 18, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 2002]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0165832|Interstate 60}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|271052|Interstate 60}}\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s road comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American road comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Canadian sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:Canadian road comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Christophe Beck]]\n[[Category:Fireworks Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:2002 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2002 independent films]]\n[[Category:2002 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2002 drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Bob Gale]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Films set in St. Louis]]"}]}}}}
