It is set during the [[Battle of Berlin]] in [[World War II]], when [[Nazi Germany]] is on the verge of defeat, and depicts the final days of [[Adolf Hitler]] (portrayed by [[Bruno Ganz]]). The cast includes [[Alexandra Maria Lara]], [[Corinna Harfouch]], [[Ulrich Matthes]], [[Juliane K\u00f6hler]], [[Heino Ferch]], [[Christian Berkel]], [[Alexander Held]], [[Matthias Habich]], and [[Thomas Kretschmann]]. The film is a German-Austrian-Italian co-production.\n\nPrincipal photography took place from September to November 2003, on location in [[Berlin]], [[Munich]], and in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. As the film is set in and around the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'', Hirschbiegel used eyewitness accounts, survivors' memoirs, and other historical sources during production to reconstruct the look and atmosphere of 1940s Berlin. The screenplay was based on the books ''[[Inside Hitler's Bunker]]'' by historian [[Joachim Fest]] and ''[[Until the Final Hour]]'' by [[Traudl Junge]], one of Hitler's secretaries, among other accounts of the period.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Film Festival]] on 14 September 2004. It was controversial with audiences for showing a human side of Hitler, and for its portrayal of members of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. It later received a wide theatrical release in Germany under its production company [[Constantin Film]]. The film grossed over $92{{nbs}}million. Critics gave favourable reviews, particularly for Ganz's performance as Adolf Hitler and Eichinger's screenplay. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[77th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn November 1942, at the [[Wolf's Lair]] in [[East Prussia]], Fuhrer of [[Nazi Germany]] [[Adolf Hitler]] invites a number of young women to interview for the position of his personal secretary. [[Traudl Junge]] is overjoyed when he chooses her. Two and a half years later, the [[Red Army]] has pushed Germany's forces back and [[Battle of Berlin|surrounded Berlin]]. On Hitler's 56th birthday, the Red Army begins shelling Berlin's city centre. ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] tries to persuade Hitler to leave Berlin, but Hitler refuses. Himmler leaves to negotiate terms with the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] in secret. Later, ''[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Hermann Fegelein]], Himmler's adjutant, also attempts to persuade Hitler to flee, but Hitler insists that he will win or die in Berlin. SS doctor ''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ernst-G\u00fcnther Schenck]] is ordered to leave Berlin per [[Operation Clausewitz]], though he persuades an [[SS]] general to let him stay in Berlin to treat the injured. In the streets, [[Hitler Youth]] [[child soldier]] Peter Kranz's father approaches his son's unit and tries to persuade him to leave. Peter, who destroyed two enemy tanks and will soon be awarded a medal by Hitler, calls his father a coward and runs away.\n\nAt a meeting in the ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'', Hitler forbids the overwhelmed [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] from retreating, instead ordering ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Felix Steiner]]'s [[Army Detachment Steiner|units]] to mount a counter-attack. The generals find the orders impossible and irrational. Above ground, Hitler awards Peter his medal, hailing Peter as braver than his generals. In his office, Hitler talks to [[Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production|Minister of Armaments]] [[Albert Speer]] about his [[Nero Decree|scorched earth policy]]. Speer is concerned about the destruction of Germany's infrastructure, but Hitler believes the German people left behind are weak and thus deserve death. Meanwhile, Hitler's companion [[Eva Braun]] holds a party in the [[Reich Chancellery]]. However, her brother-in-law Fegelein tries to persuade Eva to leave Berlin with Hitler, but she dismisses him. Artillery fire eventually breaks up the party.\n\nOn the battlefield, General [[Helmuth Weidling]] is informed he will be executed for allegedly ordering a retreat. Weidling comes to the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' to clear himself of his charges. His action impresses Hitler, who promotes him to oversee all of Berlin's defences. At another meeting, Hitler learns Steiner did not attack because his unit lacked sufficient force. Hitler becomes enraged at what he sees as an act of betrayal and launches into a furious tirade, shouting that everyone has failed him and denouncing his generals as cowards and traitors. He finally acknowledges that the war is lost, but that he would rather commit suicide than leave Berlin.\n\nSchenck witnesses old men being executed by German [[military police]] for supposedly refusing to take part in the fighting. Hitler receives a message from ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|requesting state leadership]]. Hitler declares G\u00f6ring a traitor, ordering his dismissal from all posts and his arrest. Speer makes a final visit to the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'', and admits to Hitler that he has defied his orders to destroy Germany's infrastructure. Hitler, however, does not punish Speer, who decides to leave Berlin. Peter returns to find his unit dead and runs back to his parents. Hitler continues to imagine fantastic ways for Germany to turn the tide. At dinner, Hitler learns of Himmler's secret negotiations. Hearing that one of his most loyal followers has abandoned him sends him into another rage, and he quickly orders Himmler's execution. He also finds out that Fegelein has deserted his post, having him executed despite Eva's pleas. SS physician ''Obergruppenf\u00fchrer'' [[Ernst-Robert Grawitz]] asks Hitler's permission to evacuate for fear of Allied reprisal. Hitler refuses, leading Grawitz to kill himself and his family.\n\nThe Soviets continue their advance, Berlin's supplies run low, and German morale plummets. Hitler hopes that the [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|12th Army]], led by [[General der Panzertruppe|Lieutenant General]] [[Walther Wenck]], will save Berlin. After midnight, Hitler dictates his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]] to Junge, before officially marrying Eva. The following morning, Hitler learns that the 12th Army is unable to relieve Berlin. Refusing surrender, Hitler plans his death. He administers poison to his dog [[Blondi]], bids farewell to the bunker staff, and [[Death of Adolf Hitler|commits suicide]] with Eva. The two are crudely cremated with petrol in a ditch in the Chancellery garden.\n\nPropaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] assumes the Chancellorship. General [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] fails to negotiate a [[Surrender (military)#Process|conditional surrender]] with [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Soviet Marshal]] [[Vasily Chuikov]]. Goebbels declares that Germany will not surrender as long as he is alive. Goebbels' wife [[Magda Goebbels|Magda]] poisons [[Goebbels children|her six children]] with [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]], before committing suicide with Goebbels; Weidling announces unconditional surrender of German forces in Berlin afterwards. Many government and military officials including Krebs [[Mass suicides in 1945 Nazi Germany|commit suicide]] after learning of Germany's defeat. Peter discovers his parents were executed. Junge leaves the bunker and tries to flee the city; Peter joins her as she sneaks through a group of Soviet soldiers before the two find a bicycle and leave Berlin.\n\n==Cast==\n===Officials and civilians===\n\n{{castlist|*[[Bruno Ganz]] as [[Adolf Hitler]]\n*[[Alexandra Maria Lara]] as [[Traudl Junge]]\n*[[Ulrich Matthes]] as ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' [[Joseph Goebbels]]\n*[[Corinna Harfouch]] as [[Magda Goebbels]]\n*[[Juliane K\u00f6hler]] as [[Eva Braun]]\n*[[Birgit Minichmayr]] as [[Gerda Christian]]\n*[[Donevan Gunia]] as [[Peter Kranz]]\n*[[Karl Kranzkowski]] as [[Wilhelm Kranz]]\n*[[Ulrike Krumbiegel]] as [[Dorothee Kranz]]\n*[[Michael Brandner (actor)|Michael Brandner]] as [[Hans Fritzsche]]\n*[[Anna Thalbach]] as [[Hanna Reitsch]]\n*[[Bettina Redlich]] as [[Constanze Manziarly]]\n*[[Elizaveta Boyarskaya]] as [[Erna Flegel]]\n*[[Oliver Stritzel]] as [[Johannes Hentschel]]\n*[[Heino Ferch]] as ''[[Befehlsleiter|Oberbefehlsleiter]]'' [[Albert Speer]]}}\n\n===''Wehrmacht''===\n\n{{castlist|\n*[[Christian Redl]] as ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alfred Jodl]]\n*[[Rolf Kanies]] as ''[[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General der Infanterie]]'' [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]], Chief of the Army General Staff\n*[[Michael Mendl]] as ''[[General of the Artillery|General der Artillerie]]'' [[Helmuth Weidling]]\n*[[Dietrich Hollinderb\u00e4umer]] as ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Robert Ritter von Greim]]\n*[[Dieter Mann]] as ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Wilhelm Keitel]]\n*[[Justus von Dohn\u00e1nyi]] as ''[[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General der Infanterie]]'' [[Wilhelm Burgdorf]]\n*[[Hans H.

To accomplish this, the film explores Hitler's decisions and motives during his final days through the perspective of the individuals who lived in the F\u00fchrerbunker during those times.{{sfn|Mazierska|2011}} Eichinger chose not to include mention of the [[Holocaust]] because it was not the topic of the film.
