Altman]] and Burnett.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film deals with the mid-life crises of its two main protagonists, Mark ([[Eric McCormack]]) and Robert ([[Rafer Weigel]]), fictionalized versions of the film's director and producer/writer. The two friends struggle with adult career and relationship problems, all the while defiantly clinging to the geeky science fiction [[popular culture]] of their youth and seeking advice from their greatest hero, [[William Shatner]].\n\nShatner plays a campy caricature of himself as he works on a one-man musical version of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in hopes of finally being taken seriously as a dramatist and musical performer. Hip-hop artist \"The Rated R\", joined by Shatner, provides the concluding musical number \"No Tears for Caesar\", a pastiche of famous lines from the play set to a rap rhythm. The film's score was produced by [[Scott Spock]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eric McCormack]] as [[Mark A.

Altman and Robert Meyer Burnett, and a television writer on ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', felt that they could make a film out of their clique's obsession with ''Star Trek''. Burnett remembered that one day Altman called him and read a scene where he was beaten up in junior high school for wearing a ''Trek'' uniform. William Shatner appeared to him as a vision and told him to fight back. Altman wrote the first draft and then Burnett rewrote it.<ref name=\"Snider\">{{cite news | last= Snider | first= Mike |title=These are the voyages... | work=[[USA Today]] | date=March 6, 2006 | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-03-06-dvd-free-enterprise_x.htm |access-date=2011-03-07 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Altman and Burnett approached Shatner about being in ''Free Enterprise'', he was not interested: \"I had played my [Kirk] persona as far as I wanted to go and probably as far as anybody wants me to go.\"<ref name=\"Snider\"/> Undaunted, Altman and Burnett tweaked his character to be more like [[Peter O'Toole]]'s in ''[[My Favorite Year]]''. They also incorporated several anecdotes from Shatner's actual life.<ref name=\"Snider\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Free Enterprise'' had a tiny theatrical release in only nine [[Los Angeles]] theaters in 1998 with little promotion. Burnett said, \"Nobody went to see it. It was really disheartening\".<ref name=\"Snider\"/> In his review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Kevin Thomas said that the film brought \"new life into the Hollywood-set romantic comedy genre\" and was \"funny, sharp and engaging\".<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite news | last= Thomas | first= Kevin |title=Shatner Boards an Engaging ''Enterprise'' | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 4, 1999| url=http://www.calendarlive.com/cl-movie990603-1,0,1960616.story |access-date=2011-03-07 }}</ref> The ''[[L.A.

A new 2-disc [[DVD]] special edition ''Free Enterprise: Extended \"Five Year Mission\" Edition'' was released on March 7, 2006.\n\n==Popular culture references==\nThe film is laced with references to past and contemporary science-fiction films and television series, such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run (1976 film)|Logan's Run]]''. Most prominent is ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', which is treated by the protagonists as a source of inspiration and moral guidance. ''Free Enterprise'' explores the dating scene for late [[Generation X]] Hollywood singles from a decidedly sardonic perspective. The credits are laced with references and spoilers.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe original motion picture soundtrack for ''Free Enterprise'' was released on June 15, 1999 by Nettwerk Records under the Unforscene Music imprint.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/free-enterprise-love-long-and-profit-mw0000241072|title=Free Enterprise: Love Long and Profit - Original Soundtrack {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n# Jerry Van Rooyen \u2013 The Great Robbery\n# [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] \u2013 [[Welcome to the Pleasuredome (song)|Welcome to the Pleasuredome]]\n# [[Dav\u00edd Garza|David Garza]] \u2013 Glow in the Dark\n# [[Bertine Zetlitz]] \u2013 Apples and Diamonds\n# Sumack \u2013 Metaphysical\n# [[Duran Duran]] \u2013 Planet Earth\n# Weed \u2013 If Only U Could See\n# [[Shriekback]] \u2013 Underwaterboys\n# [[Madeleine Peyroux]] \u2013 (Getting Some) Fun Out of Life\n# Povi \u2013 Dragonflies\n# Manufacture feat.
