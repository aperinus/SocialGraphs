Based on the comic book series ''[[The Secret Service (comics)|The Secret Service]]'' (later retitled to ''Kingsman'') by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], the film serves as the second installment in the [[Kingsman (film series)|''Kingsman'' film series]] and the sequel to ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]'' (2014). The film features an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Colin Firth]], [[Taron Egerton]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Edward Holcroft]], [[Hanna Alstr\u00f6m]], and [[Sophie Cookson]], who reprise their roles from the first film, with [[Julianne Moore]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Pedro Pascal]], [[Elton John]], [[Channing Tatum]], and [[Jeff Bridges]] joining the cast. The film follows members of Kingsman needing to team up with their American counterpart, Statesman, after the world is held hostage by Poppy Adams and her [[drug cartel]], \"The Golden Circle\".\n\n''Kingsman: The Golden Circle'' premiered in [[London]] on 18 September 2017 and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2017 in [[3D film|3D]] and 2D and the United States on 22 September 2017 in [[IMAX]], by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $410 million worldwide against a budget of $104 million and received mixed reviews from critics, with the film's long running time targeted for criticism and its new characters and stylized action garnering polarized responses, though the acting and humor were praised.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/kingsman-the-golden-circle-reviews/|title='Kingsman: The Golden Circle' Review Round-Up: An Overlong But Entertaining Sequel|last=Pearson |first=Ben|work=[[/Film]]|date=19 September 2017|access-date=19 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nA prequel, ''[[The King's Man]]'', was theatrically released in the United States on 22 December 2021, while a sequel is scheduled for a 2023 release.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nOne year after the [[Kingsman: The Secret Service|defeat of Richmond Valentine]], Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin has officially joined the Kingsman intelligence service, taking his late mentor Harry Hart's title of \u201cGalahad\u201d, and begun a relationship with Tilde, Crown Princess of Sweden. He is ambushed by Charlie Hesketh, a former Kingsman trainee who lost his arm and vocal cords during the Valentine incident, replacing them with [[cybernetics]]. Eggsy evades Charlie and his henchmen in a car chase across London, but Charlie's severed cybernetic arm hacks into the Kingsman database through Eggsy's car. Charlie passes the information to Poppy Adams \u2014 leader of the world's largest drug cartel, the Golden Circle \u2014 who launches a volley of missiles that destroy the Kingsman headquarters and wipe out all its agents in Britain, aside from Eggsy and Merlin, Kingsman's tech support.\n\nKingsman\u2019s emergency protocol leads Eggsy and Merlin to Statesman, an American private intelligence service posing as a [[Bourbon whiskey]] distillery in [[Kentucky]], and Kingsman's American counterpart. There, they discover that Harry survived his shooting thanks to Statesman [[nanotechnology]], but is suffering from amnesia. They also learn about the Golden Circle from Statesman head Champagne, and the two agencies agree to work together to bring the cartel down. Statesman agent Tequila later develops a blue rash and shows signs of mania, and is replaced by agent Whiskey as Eggsy's partner. Eggsy plants a tracking device on Charlie's ex-girlfriend Clara Von Gluckfberg during a sexual encounter at [[Glastonbury Festival]], but his revelation of the mission to Tilde strains their relationship.\n\nEggsy cures Harry's amnesia by threatening to shoot a [[Cairn Terrier]] puppy that resembles Harry's late dog, shortly before Poppy broadcasts a message to the world about a toxin she has added to all her drugs, which causes users to develop symptoms like Tequila's before paralysis and, ultimately, death. She offers the antidote if the President of the United States ends his country's [[war on drugs]] and grants her cartel immunity from prosecution. The President decides to quarantine everyone affected, including Chief of Staff Fox, intending to let them all die to put Poppy out of business and rid the world of drug users he sees as criminals.\n\nEggsy, Harry, and Whiskey track Clara to the Golden Circle's antidote factory in the mountains of [[Italy]]. Eggsy steals an antidote sample, which is broken by Whiskey during an ambush by the Golden Circle's henchmen, leading Harry to suspect him of working against them. Harry shoots Whiskey in the head, but Eggsy, believing Harry to be delusional as a result of his recovery, saves him with nanotechnology as Charlie destroys the antidote factory, killing Clara for unwittingly betraying the Golden Circle. Tilde calls Eggsy in a manic state, revealing she has been affected by the blue rash after taking drugs due to her stress over Eggsy's infidelity. Eggsy, Harry, and Merlin discover the location of Poppy's hideout, \"Poppy Land\", in [[Cambodia]] and fly there to steal the laptop which can deploy the drones carrying the antidote.\n\nArriving at Poppy Land, Eggsy steps on a [[land mine]], but Merlin sacrifices himself instead. Storming the lair, Eggsy kills Charlie while Harry destroys Poppy's robotic attack dogs with the help of [[Elton John]], who had been kidnapped by Poppy. They secure the laptop and inject Poppy with a concentrated dose of her own toxin-infused heroin. Poppy gives them the laptop password in a drugged state, but dies from an overdose due to the heroin. Whiskey interrupts them before they can deploy the drones, revealing that he wants all drug users to die after his pregnant wife was killed in a robbery by [[meth]] addicts. Eggsy and Harry fight and kill Whiskey, then deploy the drones to release the antidote, saving the affected victims throughout the world.\n\nThe President is impeached for conspiring to commit genocide against drug victims, and Statesman purchases a distillery in Scotland to help rebuild Kingsman. Statesman tech support specialist Ginger Ale is appointed to Whiskey\u2019s position, Eggsy marries Princess Tilde, and Tequila takes an exchange assignment at Kingsman, which acquires a new tailor shop in London.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Kingsman characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Colin Firth]] as Harry Hart / Galahad<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.yibada.com/articles/161293/20160919/kingsman-golden-circle-brings-back-colin-firth-2-feature-channing.htm |title='Kingsman: The Golden Circle' brings back Colin Firth, Kingsman 2 to feature Channing Tatum |last=Marin |first=Lord |date=19 September 2016 |access-date=3 June 2018 |work=[[Yibada]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/kingsman-2-colin-firth-returning/ |title='Kingsman: The Golden Circle': New Set Pic Confirms a Fan Favorite's Return |last=Foutch |first=Haleigh |date=11 July 2016 |access-date=3 June 2018 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |publisher=[[Complex Media, Inc.]]}}</ref>\n* [[Taron Egerton]] as Gary \"Eggsy\" Unwin / Galahad\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Hamish Mycroft / Merlin\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Poppy Adams<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/09/julianne-moore-kingsman-the-golden-circle-spoilers-best-performance-1201879136/ |title=Julianne Moore Is the Real Reason 'Kingsman: The Golden Circle' Is Worth Seeing |last=Sharf |first=Zack |date=22 September 2017 |access-date=3 June 2018 |work=[[Indie Wire]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]}}</ref>\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Ginger Ale / Agent Whiskey<ref>{{cite journal |last=Griffiths |first=Kadeen |title=This 'Kingsman 2' Halle Berry Scene Expertly Nails What Being A WOC The Work Place Is Really Like |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/this-kingsman-2-halle-berry-scene-expertly-nails-what-being-a-woc-the-work-place-is-really-like-2414465 |date=22 September 2017 |access-date=3 June 2018 |journal=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]}}</ref>\n* [[Pedro Pascal]] as Jack Daniels / Agent Whiskey\n* [[Elton John]] as himself<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/19/kingsman-star-will-play-elton-john-in-biopic |title=Kingsman Star Will Play Elton John in Biopic |last=Gilyadov |first=Alex |date=19 April 2018 |access-date=3 June 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis, LLC]]}}</ref>\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Agent Tequila\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Champagne \"Champ\"\n* [[Edward Holcroft]] as Charles \"Charlie\" Hesketh\n* [[Hanna Alstr\u00f6m]] as Tilde, [[List of heirs to the Swedish throne|Crown Princess of Sweden]]\n* [[Bruce Greenwood]] as the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Emily Watson]] as [[Chief of Staff]] Fox\n* [[Sophie Cookson]] as Roxanne \"Roxy\" Morton / Lancelot<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sophie returns to role of Roxy for second Kingsman movie |url=https://eventsinsussex.uk/sophie-returns-role-roxy-second-kingsman-movie/ |access-date=3 June 2018 |editor-first=Katy |editor-last=Rice |journal=[[Pique Newsmagazine]] }}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Sir Giles / Arthur\n{{div col end}}\n\nFlashback footage from ''The Secret Service'' includes [[Samuel L.
