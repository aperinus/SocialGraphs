It stars [[Judi Dench]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Kelly Reilly]], and [[Will Young]] (in his acting debut). It tells the true story of [[Laura Henderson]], an eccentric British socialite who opened the [[Windmill Theatre]] in London in 1931.\n\n''Mrs Henderson Presents'' was theatrically released on 25 November 2005 by [[The Weinstein Company]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics and did moderately well, grossing $27.8 million against its $20 million budget. It received two nominations at the [[78th Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Dench) and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] (for [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]]).\n\n==Plot==\nEccentric 70-year-old widow Mrs [[Laura Henderson]] purchases a redundant cinema and remodels it to create the [[Windmill Theatre]] in [[London]], as a post-widowhood hobby and appoints autocratic manager [[Vivian Van Damm]]. In 1937, they start a continuous variety revue called \"Revudeville\", but after other theatres copy this innovation, they begin losing money. Mrs Henderson suggests they add female [[nudity]], similar to the [[Moulin Rouge]] in Paris, something unprecedented in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Lord Chamberlain]] ([[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer]]) reluctantly allows this under the condition that the nude female performers remain immobile, so the performances can be considered art, the equivalent of nude statues in museums.\n\nBecause the theatre's auditorium is below street level, it is relatively safe during [[The Blitz|the bombing of London]], and performances continue. The performers bravely go on with the show even during frightening bombing raids, and the posed nude girls resume their poses, after ducking, as the whole theatre is shaken and the scene [[Flats (theatre)|flats]] all round them sways when a bomb lands close by.\n\nMaureen, one of the cast, becomes involved at Mrs Henderson's instigation with a young soldier, Paul, one of the audience regulars. Maureen becomes pregnant and receives word that after Paul is [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilised]], he intends to return to his girlfriend. She becomes very upset, and hands in her notice. Before further developments, she is killed by a bomb while leaving the theatre.\n\nOther scenes depict life in the theatre during the period. Mrs Henderson and Mr Van Damm frequently clash, but also show great appreciation for each other.\n\nEventually, the authorities want the theatre to close because of the danger from bombs to crowds gathering outside the theatre. Mrs Henderson successfully argues that for soldiers going to die in the war, this is their last chance, and for many of the young soldiers their only chance, to see naked women. She reflects on the death of her son in the [[World War I|First World War]], and how he may never have even seen a naked woman except on a [[French postcard]] he had left at home, before going off to war and dying in a [[Chemical warfare|gas attack]].\n\nThe film's closing credits explain that, on her death in 1944, Mrs Henderson bequeathed the theatre to Mr Van Damm.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Laura Henderson]]\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Vivian Van Damm]]\n* [[Will Young]] as Bertie\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as [[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Maureen\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Gordon\n* [[Thelma Barlow]] as Lady Margot Conway\n* [[Anna Brewster]] as Doris\n* [[Rosalind Halstead]] as Frances\n* [[Sarah Solemani]] as Vera\n* [[Natalia Tena]] as Peggy\n* [[Melody Squire]] as Millerette\n* [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Sir Thomas Allen]] as Eric Woodburn\n* Richard Syms as Ambrose\n* [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] as Paul\n* [[Ralph Nossek]] as Leslie Pearkes\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mostly positive reviews. {{As of|June 2020}}, the film holds a 67% approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 144 reviews with an average rating 6.65 out of 10.
