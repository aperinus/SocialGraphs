This attitude defines him as a comic, and is even evident in the special\u2019s title. Make no mistake, Burr\u2019s concern for your feelings is anything but authentic.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/12/bill-burr-im-sorry-you-feel-that-way-review.html|title=Bill Burr: I'm Sorry You Feel That Way Review|last=McGlashan|first=Maren|publisher=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste Magazine]]|date=December 11, 2014|access-date=December 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nTripp Stelnicki of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox Magazine]]'' noted Burr kept the same energy of his previous routines, with a more grown-up theme. \"Burr has mentioned his fear of becoming the creepy old single dude who rants to strangers at the bar in previous specials. He seems to have reckoned with that and settled down some, and fortunately his material maintains its zealous vibe while reflecting a somewhat more-adult Bill Burr.\"<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.voxmagazine.com/review-i-m-sorry-you-feel-that-way/article_4e1cbb70-8480-50f9-919b-f53747fe0ed2.html |title = Review: \"I'm Sorry You Feel That Way\" |last = Stelnicki |first = Tripp |date = December 10, 2014 |publisher = [[Vox (website)|Vox Magazine]]|access-date = December 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=3823690}}\n\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:Netflix specials]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jay Karas]]"}]}}}}
