Due to the new laws, Joe Mondragon is unable to make a living farming because he is not allowed to divert water from an irrigation ditch that runs past his property.\n\nFrustrated, and unable to find work, Joe visits his father's field. He happens upon a tag that reads \"prohibited\" covering a valve on the irrigation ditch. He kicks the valve, unintentionally breaking it, allowing water to flood his fields. He decides against repairing the valve and instead decides to plant beans in the field. This leads to a confrontation with powerful state interests, including a hired gun brought in from out of town.\n\nAn escalation of events follows, leading to a final showdown between law enforcement and the citizens of Milagro.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] as Sheriff Bernabe Montoya\n* [[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]] as Ladd Devine\n* [[S\u00f4nia Braga]] as Ruby Archuleta\n* [[Julie Carmen]] as Nancy Mondragon\n* [[James Gammon]] as \"Horsethief Shorty\" Wilson\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Flossie Devine\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Charlie Bloom\n* [[Carlos Riquelme]] as Amarante Cordova\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Herbie Platt\n* [[Chick Vennera]] as Joe Mondragon\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Kyril Montana\n* [[Freddy Fender]] as Mayor Sammy Cant\u00fa\n* [[Tony Genaro]] as Nick Rael\n* [[Jerry Hardin]] as Emerson Capps\n* [[Robert Carricart]] as Coyote Angel\n\n==Production==\nAccording to an article by Patricia Rodriguez in the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', Robert Redford was interested in filming part of the movie in the Plaza del Cerro of [[Chimayo, New Mexico]], which is argued to be the last surviving fortified Spanish plaza in North America. Some locals responded favorably, but many objected to the idea of big business changing the small community, which forced Redford to film the movie in [[Truchas, New Mexico|Truchas]].\n\nIn his essay, \"Night of the Living Beanfield: How an Unsuccessful Cult Novel Became an Unsuccessful Cult Film in Only Fourteen Years, Eleven Nervous Breakdowns, and $20 Million,\" John Nichols gives an account of the film project as he saw it.<ref>{{cite book | last=Nichols | first=John | title=Dancing on the Stones: Selected Essays | edition=illustrated | publisher=University of New Mexico Press | location=Albuquerque | isbn=0-8263-2183-6 | pages=133\u2013153 | chapter=Night of the Living Beanfield: How an Unsuccessful Cult Novel Became an Unsuccessful Cult Film in Only Fourteen Years, Eleven Nervous Breakdowns, and $20 Million | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ph019Ib4QCwC&pg=PA133 | date=January 2001 | accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> Nichols also described the origin of the novel and the making of the film in the biographical documentary, ''The Milagro Man: The Irrepressible Multicultural Life and Literary Times of John Nichols'', which premiered at the 2012 Albuquerque Film Festival.<ref>{{cite web | author=News Staff | title=Milagro Man Find Himself in Spotlight | work=Albuquerque Journal | url=http://www.abqjournal.com/123366/entertainment/milagro-man-finds-himself-in-spotlight.html | date=August 10, 2012 | accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Truchas-NM-May05.jpg|right|thumb|Redford filmed in [[Truchas, New Mexico]].]]\n\n===Box office===\nThe film's premiere in three cities was called \"risky\" and \"disappointing\" by industry analysts.<ref>{{cite news | title=Weekend Box Office: New Blood Refreshes Top Five | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-22/entertainment/ca-1667_1_box-office | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=March 22, 1988|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:Redford Milagro Cannes 1988.jpg|thumb|[[Melanie Griffith]], [[Robert Redford]] and [[S\u00f4nia Braga]] promoting the film at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. [[Vincent Canby]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]],'' believes the film missed its mark, and wrote, \"The screenplay, by David Ward and John Nichols, based on Mr. Nichols's novel, is jammed with underdeveloped, would-be colorful characters, including a philosophical Chicano angel, who face a succession of fearful confrontations with the law that come to nothing. The narrative is a veritable fiesta of anticlimaxes, from the time the sun sets at the beginning of the film until it sets, yet again, behind the closing credits.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&title1=MILAGRO%20BEANFIELD%20WAR%2c%20THE%20%28MOVIE%29&title2=&reviewer=Vincent%20Canby&pdate=19880318&v_id=32652&oref=slogin | title=Canby, Vincent.

This causes an uncertainty that runs all through the film, making it hard to weigh some scenes against others. There are characters who seem to belong in an angry documentary\u2014like Devine, who wants to turn Milagro into a plush New Mexico resort town. And then there are characters who seem to come from a more fanciful time, like Mondragon, whose original rebellion is more impulsive than studied.\"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-milagro-beanfield-war-1988 Ebert, Roger]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' film review, April 1, 1988. Accessed: August 19, 2013.</ref>\n\nCritic Richard Scheib liked the film's direction and the characters portrayed. He wrote, \"Redford arrays a colorfully earthy ensemble of characters. The plot falls into place with lazy, deceptive ease. Redford places it up against a gently barbed level of social commentary, although this is something that comes surprisingly light-heartedly. There\u2019s an enchantment to the film \u2013 at times it is a more successful version of the folklore fable that [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Finian's Rainbow (1968 film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1968) tried to be but failed.\"\n\nScheib believes the film is \"one of the first American films to fall into the [[Latin American]] tradition of [[magical realism]]. This is a genre that usually involves an earthily naturalistic, often highly romanticized, blend of the supernatural and whimsical.\"<ref>[http://moria.co.nz/fantasy/milagrobeanfieldwar.htm Scheib, Richard].

The consensus states: \"Arguably Robert Redford's most inchoate work, ''The Milagro Beanfield War'' has plenty of beautiful moments, but they don't quite add up to a worthwhile whole.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/milagro_beanfield_war/ ''The Milagro Beanfield War''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].
