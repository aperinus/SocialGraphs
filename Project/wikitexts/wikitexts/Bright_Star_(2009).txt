It is based on the last three years of the life of poet [[John Keats]] (played by [[Ben Whishaw]]) and his romantic relationship with [[Fanny Brawne]] ([[Abbie Cornish]]). Campion's screenplay was inspired by a 1997 biography of Keats by [[Andrew Motion]], who served as a script consultant.\n\n''Bright Star'' was in the main competition at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], and was first shown to the public on 15 May 2009. The film's title is a reference to a sonnet by Keats titled \"[[Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art]]\", which he wrote while he was with Brawne.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1818 [[Hampstead]], the fashionable Fanny Brawne ([[Abbie Cornish]]) is introduced to poet John Keats ([[Ben Whishaw]]) through the [[Charles Wentworth Dilke|Dilke]] family.  The Dilkes occupy one half of a double house, with [[Charles Armitage Brown|Charles Brown]] ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]) occupying the other half. Brown is Keats' friend, roommate, and associate in writing.\n\nFanny's flirtatious personality contrasts with Keats' notably more aloof nature. She begins to pursue him after her siblings Samuel and Toots obtain his book of poetry, \"[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]\". Her efforts to interact with the poet are fruitless until he witnesses her grief for the loss of his brother, Tom. Keats begins to open up to her advances while spending Christmas with the Brawne family. He begins giving her poetry lessons, and it becomes apparent that their attraction is mutual. Fanny is nevertheless troubled by his reluctance to pursue her, on which her mother ([[Kerry Fox]]) surmises, \"Mr. Keats knows he cannot like you, he has no living and no income.\"\n\nIt is only after Fanny receives a valentine from Brown that Keats passionately confronts them and asks if they are lovers. Brown sent the valentine in jest, but warns Keats that Fanny is a mere flirt playing a game. Fanny is hurt by Brown's accusations and Keats' lack of faith in her; she ends their lessons and leaves. The Dilkes move to [[Westminster]] in the spring, leaving the Brawne family their half of the house and six months rent. Fanny and Keats then resume their interaction and fall deeply in love. The relationship comes to an abrupt end when Brown departs with Keats for his summer holiday, where Keats may earn some money. Fanny is heartbroken, though she is comforted by Keats' love letters. When the men return in the autumn, Fanny's mother voices her concern that Fanny's attachment to the poet will hinder her from being courted. Fanny and Keats secretly become engaged.\n\nKeats contracts [[tuberculosis]] the following winter. He spends several weeks recovering until spring. His friends collect funds so that he may spend the following winter in Italy, where the climate is warmer. After Brown impregnates a maid and is unable to accompany him, Keats finds accommodation in London for the summer, and is later taken in by the Brawne family following an attack of his illness. When his book sells with moderate success, Fanny's mother gives him her blessing to marry Fanny once he returns from Italy. The night before he leaves, he and Fanny say their tearful goodbyes in privacy. Keats dies in Italy the following February of complications from his illness, as his brother Tom did.\n\nIn the last moments of the film, Fanny cuts her hair in an act of mourning, dons black attire, and walks the snowy paths that Keats had walked many times. It is there that she recites the love sonnet that he had written for her, called \"Bright Star\", as she grieves the death of her lover.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Whishaw]] as [[John Keats]].<br />Keats was one of the key figures in the second generation of the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic movement]] despite the fact that his work had been in publication for only four years before his death. During his lifetime his poems were not generally well received by critics and at age 25 he died believing he was a failure. However, his reputation grew and he held significant posthumous influence on many later poets.\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as [[Fanny Brawne]].<br />Like the real life Fanny Brawne, Fanny in the film is a fiery and fashionable eighteen-year-old who spends her time creating dresses, hats, and various other garments. She is also something of a flirt and enjoys attending [[Ball (dance party)|balls]], inciting Keats' jealousy. Though the real life Fanny Brawne went on to marry and have children, she never sold Keats' love letters. They were sold after her death by her children.\n* [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] as [[Charles Armitage Brown]], Keats' best friend.\n* [[Kerry Fox]] as Fanny's mother, a widow.\n* [[Thomas Sangster]] as Samuel Brawne, Fanny's younger brother.\n* Edie Martin as Toots, Fanny's younger sister.\n* [[Antonia Campbell-Hughes]] as Abigail O'Donaghue Brown, housemaid and mother of Charles Brown's child.\n* [[Claudie Blakley]] as Mrs Dilke\n* [[Gerard Monaco]] as [[Charles Wentworth Dilke|Charles Dilke]]\n* [[Olly Alexander]] as Tom Keats, Keats' brother\n* [[Samuel Roukin]] as [[John Hamilton Reynolds]]\n* [[Amanda Hale]] as Reynolds' Sister\n* [[Jonathan Aris]] as [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]]\n* [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] as [[Joseph Severn]]\n\n==Production==\nIn addition to \"Bright Star\" several other poems are recited in the film, including \"[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]\" and \"[[Ode to a Nightingale]]\". Both Campion and Whishaw completed extensive research in preparation for the film. Many of the lines in the script are taken directly from Keats' letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepoetryplace.wordpress.com/2009/10/24/bright-star/|title=Bright Star|last=Beal|first=Jane|date=2009-10-24|website=The Poetry Place|language=en|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref> Whishaw, as well, learned how to write with a [[quill]] and ink during filming.
