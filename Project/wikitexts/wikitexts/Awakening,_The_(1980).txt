It is the third film version of [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Jewel of Seven Stars]]'', following 1970 television adaptation as ''The Curse of the Mummy'' for the TV series ''[[Mystery and Imagination]]'', and the 1971 theatrical film by Hammer, ''[[Blood from the Mummy's Tomb]]'' (in which Ahmed Osman also appeared). It was released by [[Warner Bros.]]\n\nAnother adaptation of Stoker's novel was released directly to video in 1997 under the title ''[[Bram Stoker's Legend of the Mummy|Bram Stoker's The Mummy]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on an Egyptian archaeological dig in 1961.<ref name = \"the mummy\">Cowie, Susan D. and Tom Johnson. ''The Mummy in Fact, Fiction and Film''. North Carolina: McFarland & Company Inc., 2002. Print.</ref> Three of the main characters are introduced: Matthew Corbeck (Heston), his wife Anne Corbeck (Jill Townsend), and Jane Turner (Susannah York). Matthew and Jane are discussing their efforts to uncover the tomb of an ancient Egyptian queen. Anne is distressed by the relationship between her husband and his assistant. It is later proved that her distress is justified.\n\nCorbeck and Turner discover a long hidden tomb that bears an inscription: \"Do Not Approach the Nameless One Lest Your Soul Be Withered.\"<ref name =\"The Awakening\">''The Awakening''. Dr. Mike Newell. Warner Brothers, 1980. VHS.</ref> They continue on to discover the burial chamber of Queen Kara. As Corbeck prepares to breach the entrance, Anne begins a painful premature labour. Corbeck and Jane return to the camp and find Anne lying on the floor in a trance-like state. Corbeck takes her to the hospital and leaves her there so that he can return to the dig. Anne's pregnancy ends in [[stillbirth]]. As Corbeck and Turner open the mummy's sarcophagus, the stillborn infant is restored to life.<ref name=\"Horror Films\">Muir, John Kenneth.

Web. 8 Mar. 2012.</ref> Corbeck neglects his wife and daughter Margaret, and Anne takes the baby and leaves him.\n\nEighteen years later, Corbeck is a professor at a British university and married to Jane. Corbeck learns that traces of bacteria have been found on the mummy that threaten to destroy it. Corbeck tries to have the mummy brought back to England because he disagrees with the methods used by Egyptian professionals to preserve it. One of the specialists opposing Corbeck is killed in a freak accident, allowing Matthew to transport the mummy to England.\n\nMargaret (Stephanie Zimbalist), now eighteen (the age of Queen Kara when she died), goes to England to meet her father against her mother's wishes. Corbeck and Jane tell Margaret all about Kara, the violent murders she committed, and the myth that she could [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]] herself.\n\nCorbeck's obsession with Kara grows and Margaret exhibits personality changes. People who resist Matthew and Margaret mysteriously and violently die. Margaret begins to notice the changes in herself and believes she is the one responsible for all the deaths. While visiting Kara's tomb, in Egypt, she and her father discover the [[Canopic jar]]s that contain Kara's organs. Corbeck secretly brings the Canopic jars back to England. Corbeck wants to try the ritual to resurrect the ancient Queen. He believes that the spirit of the queen possessed his daughter at the moment of her birth, and that she intends to resurrect herself through the girl's body. He proposes that the only way to save Margaret, who has fallen into a coma, is to perform the ritual over Kara's mummy in the British Museum. He realises too late that Kara tricked him, and that the ritual enabled her to completely take over Margaret's body. The reincarnated Queen kills Corbeck, her future intentions unknown.<ref name=\"Horror Films\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Matthew Corbeck: Corbeck is a fictional British archaeologist and the main character in the film. Corbeck is obsessive about his work<ref name=\"movie review\"/> which leads to the end of his marriage with Anne.<ref name = \"The Awakening\"/> Heston has been criticised for his inability to produce a convincing [[English accent]].<ref name=\"Horror Films\"/><ref name=\"movie review\"/> \n* [[Susannah York]] as Jane Turner: Corbeck's trained assistant. According to Anne, Jane \"worships\" Corbeck<ref name = \"The Awakening\"/> and has been referred to by critics as \"kittenish\".<ref name=\"movie review\"/> Later we find out that Jane and Corbeck get married after Matthew and Anne divorce. In the latter part of the film, Jane becomes concerned with Corbeck's obsession with Kara and the reincarnation ritual. She dies as the result of an accident which takes place as she tries to destroy the organs.  \n* [[Jill Townsend]] as Anne Corbeck: Corbeck's wife, who feels neglected by her husband and ends up leaving him because of this. She tries to convince Margaret to not visit her father by saying \"Your father has a wife. He deserted us for her\".<ref name = \"The Awakening\"/> \n* [[Stephanie Zimbalist]] as Margaret Corbeck: Matthew Corbeck's daughter is one of Zimbalist's first acting roles. Soon after her character's eighteenth birthday, she starts feeling an unexplainable urge to visit her father. As she becomes possessed by Kara she begins to do uncharacteristic things such as murdering people who get in the way of the ancient Queen.<ref name=\"Horror Films\"/>  Zimbalist has been critiqued for not being skilled enough to play both the roles of Margaret and Kara with subtlety<ref name = \"the mummy\"/> and her creepiness near the end of the film is created more by her makeup rather than her acting.<ref name=\"movie review\"/> She is however, praised at being much better at performing the lighter scenes as Margaret.<ref name=\"movie review\"/>\n* [[Patrick Drury]] as Paul Whittier: Corbeck's assistant in the latter part of the film and Margaret's love interest.\n* [[Bruce Myers (actor)|Bruce Myers]] as Dr. Khalid\n* [[Nadim Sawalha]] as Dr. El Sadek\n* [[Ian McDiarmid]] as Dr. Richter\n* Ahmed Osman as Yussef\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Dr. Kadira: Anne Corbeck's nurse during the birth of Margaret. \n* [[Michael Mellinger]] as Hamid\n* [[Leonard Maguire]] as John Matthews\n* [[Ishia Bennison]] as Nurse\n* [[Madhav Sharma]] as Doctor\n* Chris Fairbanks as Porter\n* Michael Halphie as Doctor\n\n==Production==\n{{cleanup rewrite|section=yes|date=September 2018}}\nThe film was announced in July 1979.<ref>The man who came to film\nThe Guardian 18 July 1979: 10.</ref> Filming took place in Egypt and England.\n\nDirector Mike Newell later said the production of the film was \"utterly terrible\" although he 'adored' working with Heston. Newell recalled about Heston, \"He's a great big [star]. 'He would come to all the rushes. He was at rushes every day.\" Newell would also remark that he found the final cut of the film to be \"miserable in the sense that it got recut by a very, very nice man, [[Monte Hellman]]...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dga.org/Craft/VisualHistory/Interviews/Mike-Newell.aspx?Filter=Full%20Interview|website=DGA|title=Interview with Mike Newell}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=September 2018}}\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] by [[Studio Canal]] on June 25, 2007.
