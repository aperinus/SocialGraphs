Her husband Antonino \"Nino\" is in the armed forces fighting the British in Africa and she lives alone. Because of her physical appearance and her solitary status, she is an object of lust for all the town's men and of hatred for its women. She keeps an eye on her father, who is the school teacher of Renato and his friends and also lives alone, until he receives an anonymous note slandering her, which causes him to reject her.\n\nRenato becomes obsessed with Mal\u00e8na, spying on her in her house, stalking her when she leaves it and thinking of her in all his erotic fantasies. He also steals some of her underwear from her clothesline; when his parents find it in his bedroom, they become upset and strictly punish him, trying to break his fixation.\n\nOne day, Mal\u00e8na is notified of her husband's death, adding grief to her isolation. She is said to have been with a lot of men; she unwisely fuels these rumours by allowing the young and handsome Cadei, a single air force officer, to visit her after dark. When she is denounced and put on trial by the wife of an elderly dentist, the officer sends testimony that he was nothing more than an occasional friend. The betrayal hurts, but Mal\u00e8na says nothing to condemn him. After her acquittal, her advocate pays her a visit and forces her to pay for his services with sex.\n\nRenato is very sad, because he wants to help Mal\u00e8na but doesn't know how, so he asks God and his saints to watch over her and performs small acts of vengeance against her detractors.\n\nMeanwhile, the war reaches Sicily and the town is bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], killing Mal\u00e8na's father. Now penniless and universally scorned, with nobody willing to give her work, the only thing she can do to survive is sink into [[prostitution]], cutting and coloring her hair and becoming compliant with all men. The townsfolk are happy to see her as a whore rather than a dangerous widow. When [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] forces occupy the town, Renato sees his idol with two German soldiers and faints. His mother, believing it is [[demonic possession]], takes him to a priest for [[exorcism]], but his more practical father takes Renato to the town brothel, where he fantasizes that the prostitute initiating him is Mal\u00e8na.\n\nThe Germans leave and American troops enter the town, welcomed by ecstatic cheers. The women accuse Mal\u00e8na of [[Wartime collaborationism|collaborationism]], storm the hotel and drag her out, ripping off her clothes, beating her and cutting off her hair. To escape further persecution, she leaves the hostile town and moves to [[Messina]]. A few days later Nino Scord\u00eca, who has actually survived as a prisoner of war but lost an arm, comes back looking for her. His house has been taken over by displaced people and nobody wants to tell him how to find his wife. Renato becomes sad when Nino is mocked by former fascists and leaves him an anonymous note, saying that Mal\u00e8na has always loved only him but has suffered misfortunes because of the war and has moved away, so Nino decides to reach her.\n\nA year later, Nino and Mal\u00e8na return and are seen strolling through the town. Women notice she now looks more matronly and plain, even if still beautiful. Since she is still married and living once again with her husband, people no longer consider her a threat and begin speaking of her and to her with more respect. While she walks home, some fruit falls from her bag and Renato rushes to pick it up. He wishes her good luck and she gives him an enigmatic half-smile: it's the only time Mal\u00e8na and Renato have an actual interaction in the whole movie.\n\nMany years later, an aged Renato reflects that he has known many women, many of whom asked him to remember them, without success; he admits that the only woman he can't forget is Mal\u00e8na.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as Maddalena \"Mal\u00e8na\" Bonsignore Scord\u00eca\n* [[\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Sulfaro\"|Giuseppe Sulfaro]] as Renato Amoroso\n* [[Luciano Federico]] as Renato's father\n* Matilde Piana as Renato's mother\n* Pietro Notarianni as Bonsignore, the teacher\n* [[Gaetano Aronica]] as Antonino \"Nino\" Scord\u00eca\n* Gilberto Idonea as Centorbi, the advocate\n* Angelo Pellegrino as the [[National Fascist Party|Fascist]] party boss\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Malena-poster-1.jpg|thumb|Italian film poster]]\n{{main|Mal\u00e8na (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe soundtrack was nominated for an [[73rd Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Original Score]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film has a 54% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on reviews by 78 critics, with an average of 5.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Malena ends up objectifying the character of the movie's title. Also, the young boy's emotional investment with Malena is never convincing, as she doesn't feel like a three-dimensional person.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1101561-1101561-malena/|title=Malena - Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=4 September 2018 |work=Flixter}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted score, the film is rated 54/100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Malena (2000) |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/malena |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen first released, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: \"Considerably scaled down in scope and size from his English-language existential epic, ''[[The Legend of 1900]]'', Giuseppe Tornatore's ''Malena'' is a beautifully crafted but slight [[period drama]] that chronicles a 13-year-old boy's obsession with a small-town siren in World War II [[Sicily]]. Combining a coming-of-age story with the sad odyssey of a woman punished for her beauty, the film ultimately has too little depth, subtlety, thematic consequence or contemporary relevance to make it a strong contender for [[arthouse]] crossover. But its erotic elements and nostalgic evocation of the same vanished Italy that made international hits of ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]'' and ''[[Il Postino]]'' could supply commercial leverage.\"<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788514.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 Rooney, David]. ''Variety,'' 30 October 2000. Retrieved: 1 March 2008.</ref>\n\nFilm critic [[Roger Ebert]] compared the film to [[Federico Fellini]]'s work, writing: \"Fellini's films often involve adolescents inflamed by women who embody their carnal desires (e.g. ''[[Amarcord]]'' and ''[[8\u00bd]]''). But Fellini sees the humor that underlies sexual obsession, except (usually but not always) in the eyes of the participants. ''Malena'' is a simpler story, in which a young man grows up transfixed by a woman and essentially marries himself to the idea of her. It doesn't help that the movie's action grows steadily gloomier, leading to a public humiliation that seems wildly out of scale with what has gone before and to an ending that is intended to move us much more deeply, alas, than it can.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=December 22,
