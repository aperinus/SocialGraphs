The film focuses on Casey Carlyle, a normal teenager who gives up a promising future academic life in order to pursue her new-found dream of being a professional [[Figure skating|figure skater]]. The film was released on March 18, 2005. ''Ice Princess'' had an unsuccessful performance at the box office, grossing $24 million in the United States during its theatrical run against a production budget of $25 million.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the fictional city of Millbrook, [[Connecticut]], Casey Carlyle ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]), a very smart and talented science student, pursues a scholarship to [[Harvard University]]. For the scholarship, she must present a personal summer project about physics. While watching a [[figure skating]] competition with her mathematically inclined best friend Ann, Casey realizes that her favorite childhood hobby, [[ice skating]], would make a perfect project. She decides to try to improve her own skating by applying physics and what she has discovered from watching other skaters.\n\nCasey becomes proficient and skips two levels to become a junior skater, following a recital. She helps junior skaters Gennifer \"Gen\" Harwood ([[Hayden Panettiere]]), Tiffany Lai (Jocelyn Lai), and Nikki Fletcher ([[Kirsten Olson]]) improve their skating by using [[algorithm]]s generated by her computer. Torn between her Harvard dream and her growing love of skating, Casey has difficulty juggling schoolwork, skating, and a part-time job. Joan Carlyle ([[Joan Cusack]]), Casey's mother, attempts to prevent her daughter from skating due to her declining academic performance. Meanwhile, tension arises between Casey's mother and her coach Tina Harwood ([[Kim Cattrall]]), a disgraced former skater.\n\nTina, who manages the rink where Casey trains, has Gen on a strict training program. During a competition where both Casey and Gen compete, Tina sees Casey may outrank Gen and sabotages Casey's performance by buying her new skates. Unaware of the danger of unbroken-in skates, Casey's resulting long program is riddled with poor jumps and several falls. Upon being informed of Tina's intent behind her seemingly kind gesture, Casey lashes out at her and mistakenly assumes her children were equally involved in the plot. She ranks fifth in the competition and can only qualify for sectionals if any of the top four back out. As a result, Casey loses interest in skating and returns to her studies and goal of attending Harvard.\n\nUpset at sabotage and frustrated by all the restrictions of training, Gen quits. While Casey and Gen reconcile, Casey can now qualify for sectionals as Gen quit. She declines the Harvard scholarship competition to devote herself to skating, to her mother's dismay. Casey asks Tina to be her personal coach and train for [[Figure skating competition#Qualifying competitions in the United States|sectionals]]. Her mother, upset at this change of direction in her life, refuses to watch her skate.\n\nAt Sectionals, Casey is not fully focused on the competition, and falls while attempting a triple [[salchow jump]]. To her surprise, she sees her mother in the audience. Inspired, she gives a highly rated artistic performance. Sectionals ends with Nikki earning gold and Casey placing silver, both qualifying to go to Nationals and potentially the 2006 Winter Olympics. Gen's brother, Teddy ([[Trevor Blumas]]), gives Casey flowers to congratulate her; and they kiss. Later, Joan and Tina bicker about how many college courses Casey should take, her and Teddy's budding love, her sponsors, and her future in figure skating.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- PER SCREEN CREDITS -->\n*[[Joan Cusack]] as Joan Carlyle\n*[[Kim Cattrall]] as Tina Harwood\n*[[Michelle Trachtenberg]] as Casey Carlyle\n*[[Hayden Panettiere]] as Gennifer \"Gen\" Harwood\n*[[Trevor Blumas]] as Teddy Harwood\n*[[Erik King]] as Dr. Chip Healey\n*[[Diego Klattenhoff]] as Kyle Dayton\n*[[Kirsten Olson]] as Nikki Fletcher\n*[[Signe Ronka]] as Emma Flanders\n*[[Juliana Cannarozzo]] as Zoey Bloch\n*[[Paul Sun-Hyung Lee]] as Mr. Lai\n*[[Martha MacIsaac]] as Mean Party Girl\n*[[Connie Ray]] as Mrs. Fletcher\n*[[Michelle Kwan]] as ESPN reporter\n*Jocelyn Lai as Tiffany Lai\n*Shanique Ollivierre-Lake as Chantal DeGroat\n*Amy Stewart as Ann\n*Kristina Whitcomb as Ms. Fisher Lee\n\n==Production==\nBlumas said that he was put on hold for two months during the audition process and that there had been \"a lot of switch-overs with the directors\".<ref name=Murray1>{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/iceprincess/a/princsstb031205.htm |title=Trevor Blumas Talks About \"Ice Princess\": On Playing Michelle Trachtenberg's Love Interest in the Disney Ice Skating Movie |access-date=2009-03-09 |last=Murray |first=Rebecca |publisher=About.com }}</ref> Blumas ended up playing Teddy as a sort of father figure.<ref name=Murray1/> He began training to drive a Zamboni soon after arriving in Toronto; according to him, he later ended up smoothing the ice on some mornings at the rink where they were shooting.<ref name=Murray1/> Panettiere did much of her own skating, including a fast spin seen at the end of the regionals short program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/iceprincess/a/princsshp031205_2.htm |title=Hayden Panettiere Discusses \"Ice Princess\": Hayden Panettiere on Ice Skating versus Riding Zebras|access-date=2009-03-09 |last=Murray |first=Rebecca|publisher=About.com}}</ref> Trachtenberg trained for eight months, including the time they were filming (during which time she says she worked twenty-hour days).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/t/trachtenberg_ice_princess_050311/|title=Putting A Brain On Ice|access-date=2009-03-09|year=2007|publisher=MTV Networks}}</ref> She had to be on the ice longer than most of the other actors as she was one of the few adults on the film.<ref name=Pryor>{{cite web|url=http://www.campuscircle.com/review.cfm?r=702 |title=Film: Interview [Michelle Trachtenberg: Ice Princess]: Michelle Trachtenberg: Trades Stakes for Skates in Ice Princess |access-date=2009-03-09|last=Pryor |first=Chris|publisher=Campus Circle, Inc}}</ref> She had stunt doubles to handle the falls and some of the complex moves,<ref name=Murray3/> although Trachtenberg did learn a specific move that could not be done by a stunt double as the differences in their build would be apparent.
