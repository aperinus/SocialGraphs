Lee Ermey]]. Its plot follows a group of young adults traveling through rural [[Texas]] who encounter [[Leatherface]] and his murderous family. It is a [[Film remake|remake]] of [[Tobe Hooper]]'s 1974 film [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|of the same name]], and the fifth installment in [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]]. Several crew members of the original film were involved with the project: Hooper and writer [[Kim Henkel]] served as co-producers, [[Daniel Pearl (cinematographer)|Daniel Pearl]] returned as cinematographer, and [[John Larroquette]] reprised his voice narration for the opening [[intertitle]]s.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 17, 2003, received mostly negative reviews from critics, and grossed $107 million at the box office on a budget of $9.5 million. A [[prequel]] was released in 2006, titled ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]''. ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' was the first film to be produced by [[Platinum Dunes]], who would go on to produce remakes of several other 20th-century horror films.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nOn August 18, 1973, five young adults \u2013 Erin, her boyfriend Kemper, and their friends Morgan, Andy, and Pepper \u2013 are on their way to a [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] concert after traveling to [[Mexico]] to purchase [[marijuana]]. While driving through [[Texas]], the group picks up a distraught and severely traumatized hitchhiker they see walking in the middle of the road. After they try to talk with the hitchhiker, who speaks incoherently about \"[[Leatherface|a bad man]],\" she pulls a loaded revolver from between her legs and shoots herself in the mouth.\n\nThe group goes to a nearby gas station to contact the police, where a woman named Luda Mae tells them to meet [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Sheriff Hoyt / Charlie Hewitt Jr.|Sheriff Hoyt]] at the Old Crawford Mill. Instead, they find a young boy named [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Jedidiah Hewitt|Jedidiah]], who tells them Hoyt is at home, [[binge drinking|getting drunk]]. Erin and Kemper go through the woods to find his house, leaving Morgan, Andy, and Pepper at the mill with Jedidiah. They come across a plantation house and Erin is allowed inside by an amputee named [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Monty Hewitt|Monty]] to call for help. Kemper goes inside to look for Erin and is killed by Thomas Hewitt, also known as \"[[Leatherface]]\", who hits him with a sledgehammer which sprays his blood on a nearby television; he then drags his body into the basement to make a new mask.\n\nMeanwhile, Sheriff Hoyt arrives at the mill, and disposes of the hitchhiker's body in his trunk. After Erin discovers that Kemper is missing, she and Andy go back to Monty's house, and Erin distracts him, while Andy searches for Kemper. When Monty realizes that Andy is inside, he summons Leatherface, who attacks him with a chainsaw. Erin escapes and heads towards the woods, but Leatherface hacks off Andy's left leg with his chainsaw, he then carries the horrified and begging Andy to the basement, where he impales him on a sharp meat hook before rubbing salt on his stump of a leg afterwards he wraps it with butcher paper and ties it with human hair. Erin makes it back to the mill, but before she and the others can leave, Sheriff Hoyt shows up. After finding marijuana on the dashboard, he orders Erin and Pepper to get out of the van, gives Morgan the gun he took from the hitchhiker, and tells him to reenact how she killed herself. Morgan, disturbed by his demands, attempts to shoot him, but the gun is unloaded. Hoyt then handcuffs Morgan and drives him back to the Hewitt house, taking the van's key with him. Back in the sinister house, Andy awakens after passing out from pain and desperately tries to lift himself off the meat hook, but Leatherface has boobytrapped it, causing him to impale himself further on the hook.\n\nErin and Pepper are tracked down by Leatherface, who is wearing Kemper's face as a mask, and when Pepper attempts to run, she is killed by Leatherface who cuts her in half. Erin runs and hides in a nearby trailer, belonging to an obese middle-aged woman known only as the Tea Lady, and a younger woman named Henrietta, who gives her tea that has been drugged. Erin discovers that they have kidnapped the hitchhiker's baby, but passes out before she can escape. Erin wakes up at the Hewitt house, surrounded by the entire family: Leatherface, his mother Luda Mae, Hoyt, Monty, and Jedidiah. Luda Mae explains to Erin that Leatherface was tormented his whole life, because of a skin disease that left his face disfigured, and she felt that no one cared for her family besides themselves.\n\nErin is taken to the basement, where she sees the remains of Leatherface's victims. She finds Andy and kills him to end his suffering after failing to help him off the meat hook. Afterwards, she finds Morgan handcuffed in a bathtub. Jedidiah, who does not agree with his family's actions, leads them out of the house, and distracts Leatherface long enough for them to escape. Erin and Morgan find an abandoned shack in the woods, and barricade themselves inside. Leatherface breaks in and discovers Erin, but Morgan attacks Leatherface, who hangs him from a chandelier by his handcuffs, and cuts through his groin with the chainsaw. Erin escapes into the woods with Leatherface in tow. She finds a slaughterhouse and attacks Leatherface with a meat cleaver, chopping off his right arm.\n\nErin runs outside and flags down a trucker, whom she tries to convince to drive away from the Hewitt house, but he stops to find help at the gas station. Luda Mae and Hoyt talk to the trucker while Henrietta watches the baby. But when Henrietta goes outside to join in their conversation, Erin sneaks the baby out of the eatery, and places her in the sheriff's car. Erin hot-wires the car and Hoyt tries to stop her, but she runs him over repeatedly until he is dead. Leatherface suddenly appears in the road and slashes the car with his chainsaw, but Erin manages to escape with the baby, and he watches in frustration as she drives away. Two days later, two investigating officers are killed by Leatherface while doing a crime scene investigation of the Hewitt house, and a narrator states that the case still remains open.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Erin \n* [[Jonathan Tucker]] as Morgan\n* [[Erica Leerhsen]] as Pepper \n* [[Mike Vogel]] as Andy\n* [[Eric Balfour]] as Kemper\n* [[Andrew Bryniarski]] as [[Leatherface|Thomas Hewitt]]\n* [[R.

Early announcements on the site indicated that the story would be told in flashback with actress [[Marilyn Burns]], who starred in the original film, reprising her role as an aged [[Sally Hardesty]] recounting the events in the film. It was later announced that the filmmakers had already purchased the rights to the original film.\n\nEarly in the film's production the original filmmakers [[Tobe Hooper]] and [[Kim Henkel]] would be writing a script for the film, but it was unknown at the time whether or not their script would be used. In June 2002, it was announced that [[Marcus Nispel]] would direct the film in his directorial debut.<ref name=\"Mania.com\">{{cite web|title=Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The - Mania.com|url=http://www.mania.com/texas-chainsaw-massacre_article_35579.html?action=add_comment|website=Mania.com|publisher=Mania.com|access-date=August 21, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114822/http://www.mania.com/texas-chainsaw-massacre_article_35579.html?action=add_comment|archive-date=August 26, 2014}}</ref>  Nispel said that he was initially against the idea of remaking the film, calling it \"blasphemy\" to his longtime director of photography, [[Daniel Pearl (cinematographer)|Daniel Pearl]], who had shot the original film.

Kosar also realized early on that he was dealing with \"one of the seminal works of the genre\" and one that could not be bettered. When discussing with the film's producers, Kosar felt that the new film shouldn't try to compete with the original film, as he felt that it was made under different circumstances.\nIn earlier drafts Erin, the film's main character, was revealed to be nine months pregnant throughout the film but was removed from later drafts at producer Michael Bay's insistence.<ref name=\"nispelinterview\">{{cite web|title=Mr. Beaks Interviews Marcus Nispel, TEXAS CHAINSAW Remake Director!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/16298|work=Ain't It Cool NEws|author=''Ain't It Cool News'' Staff|access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Jessica Biel]], who previously starred in the television series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', was cast as the main character Erin.<ref name=\"Mania.com\"/>\n\nActor [[Andrew Bryniarski]], who starred in Bay's ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and stayed friends with him afterwards, personally met with producer Bay and asked him for the role of Leatherface. Another actor, named Brett Wagner, was cast for the role before Bryniarski, but, on the first day, the actor was hospitalized and fired for lying about his physical abilities. Without an actor for the film's main antagonist, the filmmakers called and asked if Bryniarski still wanted the role, which he accepted. To prepare for the role, Bryniarski ate a diet of brisket and white bread in order to get his weight to nearly 300 pounds. Bryniarski would later reprise his role as Leatherface in the film's [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning|prequel]].<ref name=\"Interview with Andrew Bryniarski\">{{cite web|title=Interview with Andrew Bryniarski|url=http://www.texaschainsawmassacre.net/Interviews/ABryniarski/interview.htm|website=texaschainsawmassacre.net|publisher=texaschainsawmassacre.net|access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nNispel favored shooting the film in [[California]], but Bay suggested [[Texas]], where he had previously shot three times.<ref name=ign-bay>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/16/an-interview-with-michael-bay?page=3|title=An Interview with Michael Bay|last=Head|first=Steve|work=[[IGN]]|date=October 14, 2003|access-date=February 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began in [[Austin]] in July 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/news/nispel-to-direct-remake-of-chainsaw-massacre-1117866593/|title=Nispel to direct remake of 'Chainsaw Massacre'|last=Harris|first=Dana|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 7, 2002|access-date=February 24, 2016}}</ref> and lasted 40 days.<ref name=ign-bay/> Nispel intentionally shot the film in a different style, using more traditionally narrative elements, as he did not want to make a shot-for-shot remake replicating the original film's documentary-like style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/25/an-interview-with-marcus-nispel?page=2|title=An Interview with Marcus Nispel|last=Patrizio|first=Andy|work=[[IGN]]|date=March 25, 2004|access-date=February 24, 2016}}</ref> Cinematographer Pearl explained from an on-set interview: \"People ask me, 'Is it going to be as gritty and grainy as the last one I did?'

The suit also heated up quickly, so the actor had to ensure that he drank a lot of fluids before a shoot. Leatherface's mask was also a problem; the mask was made out of [[silicone]] and was difficult for the actor to breathe through.
