The film recounts the 1952 expedition, initially by motorcycle, across South America by Guevara and his friend [[Alberto Granado]]. As well as being a [[road movie]], the film is a [[coming-of-age film]]; as the adventure, initially centered on youthful [[hedonism]], unfolds, Guevara discovers himself transformed by his observations on the life of the impoverished [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peasantry. Through the characters they encounter on their continental trek, Guevara and Granado witness first hand the injustices that the destitute face and are exposed to people and [[social class]]es they would have never encountered otherwise. To their surprise, the road presents to them both a genuine and captivating picture of [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] identity. As a result, the trip also plants the initial seed of [[radicalization]] within Guevara, who would later challenge the continent's endemic [[economic inequality|economic inequalities]] and political repression.\n\nThe screenplay is based primarily on Guevara's [[Travel literature|trip diary]] [[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|of the same name]], with additional context supplied by ''Traveling with Che Guevara: The Making of a Revolutionary'' by Alberto Granado. Guevara is played by [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] (who previously played Che in the 2002 miniseries ''[[Fidel (2002 film)|Fidel]]''), and Granado by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] actor [[Rodrigo de la Serna]], who incidentally is a second cousin to the real-life Guevara on his maternal side.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DEFDB1F31F931A2575AC0A9629C8B63 Durbin, Karen].

Last accessed: 23 March 2008.</ref> Directed by Brazilian director [[Walter Salles]] and written by [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] playwright [[Jos\u00e9 Rivera (playwright)|Jos\u00e9 Rivera]], the film was an [[international co-production]] among [[production companies]] from [[Argentina]], the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and France. The film's [[executive producer]]s were [[Robert Redford]], [[Paul Webster (producer)|Paul Webster]], and Rebecca Yeldham; the [[Film producer|producer]]s were Edgard Tenenbaum, [[Michael Nozik]], and Karen Tenkhoff; and the [[Film producer|co-producer]]s were [[Daniel Burman]] and [[Diego Dubcovsky]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Blockquote|The Che of ''The Motorcycle Diaries'' is more akin to [[Jack Kerouac]] or [[Neal Cassady]] than [[Karl Marx|Marx]] or [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].\"| Paul Webster, [[executive producer]]<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/11/features.review | title=Just A Pretty Face? | first=Sean | last=O'Hagan | newspaper=The Observer | date=11 July 2004}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1952, a semester before Ernesto \"Fuser\" Guevara is due to complete his medical degree, he and his older friend Alberto Granado, a [[biochemist]], leave [[Buenos Aires]] to travel across South America. While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a [[leper colony]] in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than {{convert|14,000|km}} in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to bed as many women as will fall for his pickup lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated [[Norton 500 motorcycle]] christened ''La Poderosa'' (\"The Mighty One\").\n\nTheir planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the [[Andes]], along the coast of Chile, through the [[Atacama Desert]] and into the [[Peruvian Amazon]] in order to reach [[Venezuela]] just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to ''La Poderosa's'' breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, often walking, and don't make it to [[Caracas]] until July.\n\nDuring their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the \"haves\" (to which they belong) and the obviously exploited \"have-nots\" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by travelling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their [[communist]] beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well. The duo then accompanies the couple to the [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine, where Guevara becomes angry at the treatment of the workers.\n\nHowever, it is a visit to the ancient [[Inca Empire|Incan]] ruins of [[Machu Picchu]] in Peru that solidifies something in Guevara. His musings are then somberly refocused to how an indigenous civilization capable of building such beauty could be destroyed by the creators of the eventually polluted urban decay of nearby [[Lima]].<ref name = \"PicchuScene\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=aO4G2cRvUjQ&vq=medium Excerpted Clip of Machu Picchu from the film ''The Motorcycle Diaries''] directed by [[Walter Salles]], distributed by [[Focus Features]], 2004</ref>\n\nLater, in Peru, they volunteer for three weeks at the [[San Pablo, Peru|San Pablo]] [[leprosy|leper]] colony. There, Guevara observes both literally and metaphorically the division of society, as the staff live on the north side of a river, separated from the deprived lepers living across the river to the south. To demonstrate his solidarity, and his medical belief that leprosy is not contagious, Guevara refuses to wear rubber gloves during his visit as the head nun requires, choosing instead to shake bare hands and interact normally with the surprised leper patients.\n\n{{Quote box \n | quote  = Every generation needs a journey story; every generation needs a story about what it is to be transformed by geography, what it is to be transformed by encounters with cultures and people that are alien from yourself, and you know that age group 15 to 25, that's the perfect generation to get on a motorcycle, to hit the road, to put on your backpack and just go out.|source = \u2014[[Jos\u00e9 Rivera (playwright)|Jos\u00e9 Rivera]], screenwriter, ''[[NPR]]''<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4058889 Thirty Years After His Death, Che Guevara Still an Icon] by ''[[NPR]] Weekend Edition Sunday'', 3 October 2004</ref>\n | width = 35%\n | align = left \n}}\n\nAt the end of the film, after his sojourn at the leper colony, Guevara confirms his nascent [[egalitarian]], revolutionary impulses, while making a birthday toast, which is also his first political speech. In it, he invokes a pan-Latin American identity that transcends the arbitrary boundaries of both nation and race. These encounters with social injustice transform the way Guevara sees the world and his purposes in it, and by implication motivates his later political activities as a Marxist revolutionary.\n\nGuevara makes his symbolic \"final journey\" at night when, despite the danger and his [[asthma]], he swims across the river that separates the two societies of the leper colony, to spend the night in a leper shack, instead of in the doctors' cabins. Later, as they bid each other farewell at an airport, Granado reveals that his birthday was not 2 April, but rather 8 August, and that the aforementioned goal was simply a motivator: Guevara replies that he knew all along. The film closes with an appearance by the real 82-year-old Alberto Granado, along with pictures from the actual journey and a brief mention of Che Guevara's eventual 1967 [[CIA]]-assisted execution in the [[Bolivia]]n jungle.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as [[Che Guevara]]<ref>{{cite web|title=afrocrowd|url=http://www.afrocrowd.org|website=afrocrowd.org|access-date=14 April 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Rodrigo de la Serna]] as [[Alberto Granado]]\n* [[Mercedes Mor\u00e1n]] as Celia de la Serna\n* [[Jean Pierre Noher]] as Ernesto Guevara Lynch\n* [[Facundo Espinosa]] as Tom\u00e1s Granado\n* [[M\u00eda Maestro]] as Chichina\n* Lucas Oro as Roberto Guevara\n* Marina Glezer as Celita Guevara\n* Sofia Bertolotto as Ana Mar\u00eda Guevara\n* Franco Solazzi as Juan Mart\u00edn Guevara\n* Ricardo D\u00edaz Mourelle as Uncle Jorge\n* [[Sergio Boris]] as Young Traveler\n* Daniel Cargieman as Young Traveler\n* Diego Giorzi as Rodolfo\n* [[Brandon Cruz]] as Miner (Chile)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title = The Motorcycle Diaries (2004) - IMDb}}</ref>\n* Gustavo Bueno as Doctor [[Hugo Pesce]]\n* [[Alberto Granado]] as himself (cameo at the end of the film)\n* Mat\u00edas Strafe as Chichina's friend\n\n==Development==\n{{Blockquote |The film shows what we were, which was two young men - boys, really - who went looking for adventure and found the truth and tragedy of our homeland.| [[Alberto Granado]], 2004<ref name = \"WashPost11\" />\n}}\n[[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] agreed to reprise his role as young Che Guevara having previously portrayed him in the television film [[Fidel (2002 film)]].
