He becomes active in the gay community, finds love with Andy, a much younger man and becomes more honest with himself and with his son.\n\nOliver discovers that, although his parents were married for 44 years from 1955, theirs was not a romantic love. Good friends, and officially boyfriend and girlfriend in high school, as it was the custom to negate gayness, after the war she asked him to marry her. During Oliver's childhood, he had detected a lack of passion in his parents' marriage so, he says he has never settled for a passionless relationship.\n\nAs a result, Oliver and Hal become closer during the last years of his life. Oliver helps him during his treatment, observes as he refuses to face his diagnosis and to tell Andy that the cancer progresses to stage IV.\n\nTwo months after Hal's death, Oliver meets Anna, a French actress, at a party. They instantly connect and end up kissing, and he asks if he can just sleep at her place. The next day, she has to go away for a film shoot but wants to see him again. Inspired by his father's attitude towards the end of his life and their relationship, Oliver decides to pursue a romance with her.\n\nWhen Anna comes back, Oliver finally feels he can open up to her. Periodically as they interact, he get flashbacks to his mother as she reminds him of her. His dad's terrier Arthur, who he can rarely leave, takes very strongly to her. Talking, they both realize they find ways of running from relationships.\n\nOliver invites Anna to move in with him, she does but then he is unhappy when she doesn't embrace it. After a very short time she announces she's moving back to New York City. He soon misses her, as she doesn't return his calls, so Oliver leaves Arthur with Andy and flies to see her in New York City.\n\nAnna finally answers her phone, but she's still in Los Angeles. She gives Oliver a tour via mobile. He apologizes, then returns to Los Angeles, where they start over.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Oliver Fields\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Hal Fields, Oliver's father\n* [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] as Anna Wallace, a French actress with whom Oliver begins a love affair\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Andy, Hal's much-younger lover\n* [[Mary Page Keller]] as Georgia Fields, Oliver's mother\n* Kai Lennox as Elliot, Oliver's friend and co-worker\n* [[China Shavers]] as Shauna, Oliver's friend and co-worker\n* [[Cosmo (dog)|Cosmo]] as Arthur\n\n==Production==\nWith cinematography by Kasper Tuxen, ''Beginners'' was filmed using the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red One]] digital camera.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/movies/beginners-with-christopher-plummer-and-ewan-mcgregor-review.html | work=The New York Times | first=Manohla | last=Dargis | title=''Beginners'', With Christopher Plummer and Ewan McGregor \u2014 Review | date=2011-06-02}}</ref> Much of the film is autobiographical, and is based on director [[Mike Mills (director)|Mike Mills]]' experiences after his own father came out of the closet following his mother's death.<ref name = \"Ryll 2014\">{{cite web |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-beginners/ |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, Beginners |author=Alexander Ryll |publisher=Gay Essential |access-date=7 February 2015 |archive-date=13 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113041606/http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-beginners/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Siedem Razy Kobieta'' poster on the wall in Oliver's dining room is from the [[Polish language]] version of the 1967 [[Shirley MacLaine]] film ''[[Woman Times Seven]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{As of|2022|11}}, the film holds an 85% approval rating on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 162 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10.
