It is set during the [[Texas\u2013Indian wars|Texas-Native American wars]], and stars [[John Wayne]] as a middle-aged [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran who spends years looking for his abducted niece ([[Natalie Wood]]), accompanied by his adopted nephew Martin ([[Jeffrey Hunter]]).\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success.

Ethan fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] on the side of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and in the three years since that war ended, he apparently fought in the [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexican revolutionary war]], as well. He has a large quantity of gold coins of uncertain origin in his possession, and a medal from the Mexican campaign that he gives to his eight-year-old niece, Debbie. As a former Confederate soldier, he is asked to take an oath of allegiance to the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]; he refuses.\n\nShortly after Ethan's arrival, cattle belonging to his neighbor Lars Jorgensen are stolen, and Rev. Captain Samuel Clayton leads Ethan and a group of Rangers to recover them. After discovering that the theft was a [[Comanche]] ploy to draw the men away from their families, they return and find the Edwards [[Homestead Act|homestead]] in flames. Aaron, his wife Martha, and their son Ben are dead, and Debbie and her older sister Lucy have been abducted.\n\nAfter a brief funeral, the men set out in pursuit. They come upon a [[Comanche#Death|burial ground]] of Comanches who were killed during the raid. When they find the Comanche camp, Ethan recommends a frontal attack, but Clayton insists on a stealth approach to avoid killing the hostages. The camp is deserted, and further along the trail, the men ride into an ambush. Despite fending off the attack, the Rangers are left with too few men to fight the Native Americans effectively. They return home, leaving Ethan to continue his search for the girls with only Lucy's fianc\u00e9, Brad Jorgensen, and Debbie's adopted brother, Martin Pawley. Ethan finds Lucy brutally murdered and presumably raped in a canyon near the Comanche camp. In a blind rage, Brad rides directly into the camp and is killed.\n[[File:The searchers Ford Trailer screenshot (22).jpg|thumb|left|\"I figure on gettin' myself un-surrounded,\" insists Captain Clayton ([[Ward Bond]]) to Ethan ([[John Wayne]]) as they realize they are caught in a trap and must run for their lives.]]\nWhen winter arrives, Ethan and Martin lose the trail and return to the Jorgensen ranch. Martin is enthusiastically welcomed by the Jorgensens' daughter Laurie, and Ethan finds a letter waiting for him from a trader named Futterman, who claims to have information about Debbie. Ethan, who would rather travel alone, leaves without Martin the next morning, but Laurie reluctantly provides Martin with a horse to catch up. At Futterman's trading post, Ethan and Martin learn that Debbie has been taken by Scar, the chief of the [[Comanche#Bands|Nawyecka]] band of Comanches. A year or more later, Laurie receives a letter from Martin describing the ongoing search. In reading the letter aloud, Laurie narrates the next few scenes, in which Ethan kills Futterman for trying to steal his money, and Martin accidentally buys a Comanche wife who runs away when she hears Scar's name, later being among the dead when the two men find a portion of Scar's band killed by soldiers.\n[[File:The searchers Ford Trailer screenshot (20).jpg|right|thumb|Martin shields Ethan's niece to prevent Ethan from murdering her.]]\nThe search leads Ethan and Martin to a military fort, and then to [[New Mexico]], where a Mexican man leads them to Scar. They find Debbie after five years, now an adolescent, living as one of Scar's wives. She tells the men that she has become a Comanche and wishes to remain with them. Ethan would rather see her dead than living as a Native American, and tries to shoot her, but Martin shields her with his body and a Comanche wounds Ethan with an arrow as they escape. Although Martin tends to Ethan's wound, he is furious with him for attempting to kill Debbie, and wishes him dead. \"That'll be the day,\" Ethan replies, as they return home.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie McCorry has been courting Laurie in Martin's absence. Ethan and Martin arrive home just as Charlie and Laurie's wedding is about to begin. After a fistfight between Martin and Charlie, a nervous Yankee soldier, Lt. Greenhill, arrives with news that Ethan's half-crazy friend Mose Harper has located Scar. Clayton leads his men to the Comanche camp, this time for a direct attack, but Martin is allowed to sneak in ahead of the assault to find Debbie, who welcomes him. Martin kills Scar to save Debbie, and Ethan scalps him. Ethan then locates Debbie, and pursues her on horseback. Martin fears that he will shoot her as he has promised and chases them desperately, but instead, Ethan sweeps her up into his arms and says, \"Let\u2019s go home, Debbie.\" She is taken to the Jorgensen ranch, and Martin reunites with Laurie. While everyone else enters the house, Ethan departs the homestead as he arrived \u2013 alone, clutching his arm \u2013 and the cabin door slowly shuts on his receding silhouette.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[John Wayne]] as Ethan Edwards\n* [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Martin Pawley\n* [[Vera Miles]] as Laurie Jorgensen\n* [[Ward Bond]] as Rev.

V. Whitney; it was directed by [[John Ford]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] While the film was primarily set in the staked plains ([[Llano Estacado]]) of northwestern Texas, it was actually filmed in [[Monument Valley]], [[Arizona]]/[[Utah]]. Additional scenes were filmed in [[Mexican Hat, Utah]], in [[Bronson Canyon]] in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, and in [[Elk Island National Park]].<ref>''DGA Magazine'', November 2003, http://www.dga.org/news/v28_4/craft_bronson.php3</ref> The film was shot in the [[VistaVision]] widescreen process. Ford originally wanted to cast [[Fess Parker]], whose [[Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier|performance]] as [[Davy Crockett]] on television had helped spark a [[coonskin cap|national craze]], in the Jeffrey Hunter role, but [[Walt Disney]], to whom Parker was under contract, refused to allow it and did not tell Parker about the offer, according to Parker's videotaped interview for the [[Archive of American Television]].

Whitney Pictures; the second was ''[[The Missouri Traveler]]'' in 1958 with [[Brandon deWilde]] and [[Lee Marvin]], and the last was ''[[The Young Land]]'' in 1959 with Wayne's son [[Patrick Wayne]] and [[Dennis Hopper]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n\n[[File:The searchers Ford Trailer screenshot (4).jpg|left|thumb|Ethan leads an attack on the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village]]\nAuthor [[Alan Le May]]'s surviving research notes indicate that the two characters who go in search of a missing girl were inspired by [[Britton Johnson]], an African-American [[Teamster|teamster]], who ransomed his captured wife and children from the Comanches in 1865.<ref>\"Brit Johnson, The Real Searcher\", ''American History'' magazine, June 2007, p. 64; \"Search for The Searchers\", ''Wild West'' magazine, April 2009, p. 53.</ref> Afterward, Johnson made at least three trips to Native American Territory and Kansas relentlessly searching for another kidnapped girl, Millie Durgan (or Durkin), until [[Kiowa people|Kiowa]] raiders killed him in 1871.<ref name=\"Brit Johnson\">{{cite web|url= http://www.forttours.com/pages/brit.asp |title=\"Negro Brit Johnson, Dennis Cureton & Paint Crawford\" on |publisher= Fort Tour Systems, Inc. |access-date= 2009-05-28}}</ref>\n\nSeveral film critics have suggested that ''The Searchers'' was inspired by the [[Fort Parker massacre|1836 kidnapping]] of nine-year-old [[Cynthia Ann Parker]] by [[Comanche]] warriors, who raided her family's home at Fort Parker, Texas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eckstein|first=Arthur M.|author2=Peter Lehman |title=The Searchers: Essays and Reflections on John Ford's Classic Western|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8143-3056-8}}</ref><ref>John Milius also makes this point in a documentary about the production, although film historian Edward Buscombe observes in ''The Searchers'' (London: British Film Institute, 2000), p.71., that Milius \"gives no evidence for this assertion\".</ref> She spent 24 years with the Comanches, married a war chief, and had three children (one of whom was the famous Comanche Chief [[Quanah Parker]]), only to be rescued against her will by Texas Rangers. James W. Parker, Cynthia Ann's uncle, spent much of his life and fortune in what became an obsessive search for his niece, like Ethan Edwards in the film. In addition, the rescue of Cynthia Ann, during a Texas Ranger attack known as the [[Battle of Pease River]], resembles the rescue of Debbie Edwards when the Texas Rangers attack Scar's village. Parker's story was only one of 64 real-life cases of 19th-century [[captivity narrative|child abductions]] in Texas that author [[Alan Le May]] studied while researching the novel on which the film was based.\n\nThe ending of Le May's novel contrasts to the film's, with Debbie, called Dry-Grass-Hair by the Comanches, running from the white men and from the Native Americans.  Marty, in one final leg of his search, finds her days later, only after she has fainted from exhaustion.\n\nIn the film, Scar's Comanche group is referred to as the Nawyecka, correctly the ''Noy\u0289hka'' or ''Nokoni'',<ref>''Taa N\u0289m\u0289 Tekwap\u0289?ha T\u0289boop\u0289 (Our Comanche Dictionary)'', Comanche Language and Cultural Preservation Committee, 2010.</ref> the same band that kidnapped Cynthia Ann Parker.  Some film critics{{Specify|date=June 2011}} have speculated that the historical model for the cavalry attack on a Comanche village, resulting in Look's death and the taking of Comanche prisoners to a military post, was the well-known [[Battle of Washita River]], November 27, 1868, when Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's 7th U.S. Cavalry attacked Black Kettle's Cheyenne camp on the Washita River (near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma).<ref>Beulah Archuletta (1909-1969), who played Look, was [[Maricopa people|Pee-Posh (Maricopa)]] from the [[Gila River Indian Community]]. {{cite web |url=http://www.gricnews.org/index.php/grin-articles/2021-articles/august-20-2021-articles/in-the-golden-age-of-hollywood-a-local-pee-posh-woman-makes-her-mark-on-the-silverscreen |title=In the Golden Age of Hollywood, a Local Pee-Posh Woman Makes Her Mark on the Silver Screen |first1=Angela |last1=Aleiss |work=Gila River Indian News |date=August 20, 2021 |access-date=August 24, 2021}}</ref> The sequence also resembles the 1872 [[Battle of the North Fork of the Red River]], in which the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]] captured 124 Comanche women and children and imprisoned them at [[Fort Concho]].\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Contemporaneous reviews ===\n[[File:Monument Valley 10.jpg|thumb|upright 1.5|Although the film was set in the flat [[Llano Estacado]] of Texas, it was filmed in [[Monument Valley]].]]\n\nUpon the film's release, [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a \"ripsnorting Western\" (in spite of the \"excessive language in its ads\"); he credits Ford's \"familiar corps of actors, writers, etc., [who help] to give the gusto to this film.

Ebert writes: \"''The Searchers'' indeed seems to be two films. The Ethan Edwards story is stark and lonely, a portrait of obsession, and in it we can see [[Paul Schrader|Schrader]]'s inspiration for Travis Bickle of ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. [...] The film within this film involves the silly romantic subplot and characters hauled in for comic relief, including the Swedish neighbor Lars Jorgensen (John Qualen), who uses a vaudeville accent, and Mose Harper (Hank Worden), a half-wit treated like a mascot. [...] This second strand is without interest, and those who value ''The Searchers'' filter it out, patiently waiting for a return to the main story line.\"<ref name=\"Review of The Searchers\" />\n\n''The Searchers'' has been cited as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], such as in the BFI's decennial ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' polls. In 1972, ''The Searchers'' was ranked 18th; in 1992, 5th; in 2002, 11th; in 2012, 7th.

Early on, Martin earns a sour look from Ethan when he admits to being one-eighth Cherokee. Ethan says repeatedly that he will kill his niece rather than have her live \"with a buck\", that \"living with the Comanche ain't living\". Even one of the film's gentler characters, Vera Miles's Laurie, tells Martin when he explains he must protect his adoptive sister, \"Ethan will put a bullet in her brain. I tell you Martha would want him to.\"  This outburst makes it clear that even the supposedly gentler characters hold the same fear of miscegenation.<ref name=\"Race, Racism and the Fear of Miscegenation\" />\n\nThe rape of captive white women by the Comanche is an unspoken theme. No actual rape scene is depicted, but Alexandra Heller-Nicholas in her study of ''Rape-Revenge Films'' says, \"the abduction, captivity, and implied rape of Debbie (Natalie Wood)... drives the narrative\";<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexandra Heller-Nicholas|title=Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSbejiCmJ-UC&pg=PA71|date= 2011|publisher=McFarland|page=71|isbn=9780786486922}}</ref> and Edward Buscombe points out a scene in which\n\"[Ethan] turns off the trail to penetrate a narrow crevice in the rocks, and when he emerges, his savage stabbing with his knife seems to mimic a violent sexual act, drawing us 'a picture' of the act of rape which obsesses him.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward Buscombe|title=The \"Searchers\"|url=https://archive.org/details/searchers00busc|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=British Film Institute|page=[https://archive.org/details/searchers00busc/page/29 29]}}</ref> Glenn Frankel writes that in real life, \"Rape was a fact of life for many captives, although it was seldom discussed by those women who escaped or were ransomed back to the white world.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Glenn Frankel|title=The Searchers: The Making of an American Legend|url=https://archive.org/details/searchersmakingo0000fran|url-access=registration|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|page=[https://archive.org/details/searchersmakingo0000fran/page/41 41]}}</ref>\n\nRandy Roberts  and James Olson write that Ethan Edwards:\n:\"...is also an obsessed maniac.

Such a situation would add further layers of nuance to Ethan's obsessive search for Debbie, his revulsion at the thought that she might be living as a Native American, and his ultimate decision to bring her home\u2014and then walk away.  Beyond the ostensible motivations, it might depict a guilt-ridden father's need to save the daughter he made by cuckolding his brother, then abandoned.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2011/03/29/searchers-john-ford  | title= After 55 Years, 'The Searchers' Legacy Still Up For Debate |date= March 29, 2011 | work=[[Here and Now (Boston)|Here & Now]] | publisher= Trustees of [[Boston University]]| access-date=2011-06-25}}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n''The Searchers'' has influenced many films.
