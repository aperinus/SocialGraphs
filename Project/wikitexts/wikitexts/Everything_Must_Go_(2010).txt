The film was based on [[Raymond Carver]]'s 1978 [[short story]] \"[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love#\"Why Don.27t You Dance.3F\"|Why Don't You Dance?]]\" and was released in theaters on May 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn [[Arcadia (Phoenix)|Arcadia, Arizona]], salesman Nick Halsey is fired from his job of 16 years following an incident in [[Denver]] related to his [[alcoholism]]. After stabbing his supervisor Gary\u2019s tires with his farewell gift \u2013 a [[Swiss Army Knife]] with his name on it \u2013 but leaving it behind, Nick has a confrontation with teenagers outside a convenience store. He returns home to find his wife Catherine is gone, the locks have been changed, and his belongings are strewn all over his lawn; she has left a letter explaining that she is leaving him, also over the Denver incident, and not to contact her.\n\nAfter spending the night on the lawn, Nick meets his new pregnant neighbor, Samantha, and pays a neighborhood boy named Kenny to watch his things. He discovers that he has been cut off from his credit cards, joint bank account, and phone service, and his company car is taken back. Almost arrested when the police ask him to vacate the premises, Nick has them contact his [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] sponsor, Detective Frank Garcia, who provides him with a permit for a yard sale, allowing him three more days before he must move on.\n\nNick gets Kenny to help him sell his possessions, promising to pay him and teach him to play baseball, but is initially unwilling to let items go. He bonds with Samantha, who is still waiting for her husband to join her at their new house. Nick reveals that he had been sober for six months until a business trip to Denver, where he got [[blackout (drug-related amnesia)|blackout drunk]] with a female colleague; he awoke with no memory of the night before, but she lodged a complaint against him, leading to his firing.\n\nFinding a yearbook with a friendly message from an old classmate, Delilah, Nick tracks her down; their reunion is awkward, but Delilah tells Nick he still has a good heart. Out of money and alcohol, Nick experiences [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]]. Samantha brings him [[Valium]] and tells him to seek help, but Nick replies that she is no better than him for putting up with her husband\u2019s drinking and frequent absences, and she storms off.\n\nNick awakens to find Kenny has arranged his belongings with thoughtful price tags, and they sell almost everything. Nick apologizes to Samantha, who admits he was right, and has told her husband to either come home or get a divorce. She, Nick, and Kenny go out to dinner, where Nick runs into Gary, who reveals that the Denver incident probably did not happen: the female employee was fired for having a history of suing coworkers for sexual harassment, and Nick would likely have gotten his job back if he had not slashed Gary\u2019s tires. When Gary leaves his beer behind, Nick refrains from drinking and returns it to him.\n\nVisiting Frank at his office, Nick answers a call on Frank\u2019s phone from Catherine. He confronts Frank, who admits Catherine has been staying with him; they fight, and Frank declares that Catherine deserves better than Nick. Driving him home, Frank observes that Nick\u2019s marriage was bound to fail, and gives him Catherine\u2019s divorce papers to sign, along with some money and the keys to Nick\u2019s house. Asking Frank to tell his wife he is sorry, Nick walks home; he almost stops at the convenience store where he regularly bought beer, but moves on and spends the night in his old bed.\n\nThe next day, he pays Kenny \u2013 including what he skimmed for beer money \u2013 and receives an appreciative hug from Samantha, whose husband has come home. She hands him the picture she took of him a few days prior, with the message from the [[fortune cookie]] he gave her: \u201cEverything is not yet lost\u201d.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Halsey, the alcoholic protagonist\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as Samantha, who just moved in across the street\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Frank Garcia, Nick's sponsor.\n* [[Christopher Jordan Wallace|Christopher \"C.J.\" Wallace]] as Kenny, a neighborhood kid\n* [[Glenn Howerton]] as Gary, Nick's supervisor\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Elliot, Nick's neighbor\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Delilah, Nick's high school friend\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Arizona]].
