It is the sequel to ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' (2002) and the second installment in the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'' film series]]. The film was directed by [[Carlos Saldanha]] (in his feature directorial debut). [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Denis Leary]], and [[Chris Wedge]] reprise their roles from the first ''Ice Age'' film, with newcomers [[Seann William Scott]], [[Josh Peck]], and [[Queen Latifah]] joining the cast. In the film, Manny, Sid, and Diego attempt to escape an impending flood, during which Manny finds love.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Belgium]] on March 1, 2006, and in the [[United States]] on March 31. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it grossed $660.9 million worldwide, marking it the [[2006 in film#Highest-grossing films|third highest-grossing film of 2006]] and the highest-grossing animated film of 2006. Three more sequels were released: ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' in 2009, ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' in 2012, and ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nManny, Sid, and Diego are currently living in a large valley surrounded by an enormously high ice wall on all sides. However, the trio subsequently discovers that the ice wall is actually a dam that is barely holding a massive [[reservoir]] that could [[glacial lake outburst flood|flood the valley]] to nearly a mile underwater if it fails. A vulture tells them that there is a boat at the other end of the valley that may save them all, but they only have three days to reach it or die. Shortly after, a huge chunk of ice breaks off from the top of the dam, initiating their immediate evacuation. Meanwhile, Manny is struggling with the thought of possibly being the last mammoth alive and Diego is revealed to suffer from severe hydrophobia due to his inability to swim. \n\nDuring the evacuation, Cretaceous, a ''[[Cymbospondylus]]'' and Maelstrom, a ''[[Pliosauroidea]]'' who were frozen since the [[Mesozoic]] era free themselves thanks to the melting ice and seek to eat all the mammals they can get during the flood. Still missing his deceased wife and child and worried about being the last mammoth, Manny asks Sid and Diego for a bit of privacy. While Manny meets Ellie, a female woolly mammoth who believes she is an [[opossum]], Diego and Sid meet two mischievous actual [[opossums]] named Crash and Eddie who drive them nuts by playing [[Whac-A-Mole]] with them, whom Ellie believes to be her brothers. Thinking Manny and Ellie are the only two mammoths left on Earth, Sid invites her to tag along with them to escape the flood, and she brings her brothers. After a dangerous encounter with Cretaceous and Maelstrom while crossing a pond, Sid tries to teach Diego how to swim while Manny and Ellie discover an area which the latter recalls as the place where she was found and adopted by Crash and Eddie's mother after she got lost from her biological family and never found them again. She finally realizes she is a mammoth and also expresses her suspicions about how different she was from other opossums. Manny begins to fall in love with her, but denies his feelings at first because he feels like he is replacing his deceased wife and child, as spouses and children are not something somebody can easily move on from, especially if that someone lost them through death. Despite this bonding moment with Manny, she distances herself from him when he suggests \"saving their species\". Ellie and Manny ultimately reconcile when they must co-operate to save the group when the ground cracks under their feet. Ellie begins to reciprocate Manny's feelings afterwards. Sid is kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloths who believe Sid to be a god. Sid lights a fire for them, and believes that he has finally found respect, but they plan to sacrifice him by tossing him into a [[volcano]]; Sid narrowly escapes. The next morning, Sid tells the others about his experience but none are convinced. After being harassed by vultures, the group finds the boat behind a field of hot geysers, which separates Manny, Sid and Diego from Ellie, Crash and Eddie when they argue about which way's safest to go through. \n\nJust as Manny, Sid and Diego bypasses the geysers, the ice dam subsequently fails, unleashing a devastating flood upon the valley. Ellie, Crash and Eddie, who took the safer yet longer way, get trapped inside a cave due to failing rocks. Crash and Eddie escape through a small hole and warn Manny, who rushes back to save her. Crash and Eddie are taken by the current; Sid tries to save them, but hits his head on a ice block and gets knocked out, forcing Diego to overcome his fear to save him and the possums, using the tactics Sid thought him earlier. Cretaceous and Maelstorm ambushes Manny underwater but he manages to\nkill the two by tricking them to dislodge a boulder, allowing Manny to save Ellie from drowning at the same time. He and Ellie reunites with the others atop a boulder but their joy is short-lived as the water is still rising. Meanwhile, Scrat, after a series of misadventures to get back his acorn, climbs the adjacent glacial wall beside them and inadvertedly creates a long crack when he punctures the ice with his acorn. The crack then widens into a gigantic [[fissure]] which splits opens the wall and drains the floodwaters, saving everyone, but in the process, Scrat falls within the fissure and gets washed away.\n\nShortly after, Sid encounters the Mini-Sloth tribe once again. Their leader suggest that Sid joins them but Diego replies that he is a \"vital part\" in their herd, which makes Sid happy. A group of mammoths later appear from the fissure, proving to everyone that mammoths aren't really extinct. Manny initially lets Ellie go with the mammoth herd as he no longer has the excuse to saving their species to be with her and still thinks of his deceased family, but after some encouragement from his friends to let go of his past so he can have a future, he catches up to her, admits to her that he loves her, regardless if they are the last ones or not, and proposes to her while hanging on a tree like an opossum. Manny, Ellie, Sid, Diego, Crash and Eddie then proceed to venture out of the valley as one big happy family.\n\nAfter falling into the fissure and nearly drowning, Scrat has a [[near death experience]] where enters a [[heaven]] full of acorns. Suddenly, he finds himself being \"sucked back\" just as he is about to reach a gigantic acorn. Scrat then discovers that he has been resuscitated by Sid through CPR, which throws him into a fit of rage when he thinks Sid stole his acorn (which is nowhere to be found), and proceeds to viciously attack him with kung fu moves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Ice Age characters}}\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manny]], the [[woolly mammoth]].\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]], the [[Megalonyx|ground sloth]].\n* [[Denis Leary]] as [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]], the ''[[Smilodon]]''.\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Ellie, the [[woolly mammoth]], who is under the [[delusion]] that she is a possum.\n* [[Seann William Scott]] and [[Josh Peck]] as [[List of Ice Age characters#Crash and Eddie|Crash and Eddie]], the [[opossum]]s, respectively.\n* [[Will Arnett]] as [[List of characters in the Ice Age films#The Lone Gunslinger|Lone Gunslinger Vulture]]\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Fast Tony, a [[giant armadillo]].\n* [[Chris Wedge]] as [[Scrat]], the [[Saber-toothed squirrel|sabre-toothed squirrel]].<ref name=\"USATSquirrelMacy\">{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Exclusive: 'Ice Age' squirrel to make Macy's debut|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/22/exclusive-ice-age-scrat-balloon-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/74366580/|access-date=October 29, 2015|work=USA Today|date=October 22, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Tom Fahn]] as Stu, a ''[[Glyptodon]]''.\n* Alex Sullivan as James, the [[aardvark]].\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Cholly, the [[chalicothere]].\n* [[Clea Lewis]] as Female Mini Sloth / Dung Beetle Mom\n* [[Debi Derryberry]] as ''Gastornis'' Mom\n* Cindy Slattery as Aardvark Mom\n\n==Production==\nAfter the release of ''Ice Age'' in March 2002, executive producer [[Chris Meledandri]] commented on the potential ''Ice Age'' sequel: \"The success of ''Ice Age'' is something that gives us additional momentum.

The same was done for ''[[Brother Bear]]'', ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda (film)|Kung Fu Panda]]'', and ''[[Robots (2005 film)|Robots]]''.\n\nOn ''[[Family Guy]]'s'' episode \"[[Sibling Rivalry (Family Guy)|Sibling Rivalry]]\", Scrat is shown trying to take three nuts out of the side of a glacier; Peter shows up and tries to stop him, admonishing the squirrel for stealing, which drives Scrat to subsequently attack Peter. The scene was rendered in 3D (''Family Guy'' is normally drawn in 2D), and Scrat was voiced by [[Chris Wedge]] who voices him in the films.<ref>{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode \"Sibling Rivalry\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox]] aired promotions for the film throughout the evening. During the same evening of this cameo, Sid was hosting the entire FOX line-up, showing up in intermittent times between commercials.\n\nRe-edited scenes of ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' were shown in Airhead candy commercials on several kids' channels and programs, such as the [[Disney Channel]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[ABC Kids (TV programming block)|ABC Kids]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and more. It shows, in part, that after [[Scrat]] defeats a school of [[piranha]], he proudly displays an Airhead packet (replaced by an acorn in the actual film), when suddenly an [[eagle]] comes over and swipes it from him.\n\nOne of the posters for the film was a [[parody]] of an [[iPod]] advertisement, with \"iAge\" replacing \"iPod\" and an acorn replacing an iPod.\n\n===Home media===\n''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD]] were released in the North America on November 21, 2006 according to the official web store.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxstore.com/detail?item=2608 |title=Ice Age: The Meltdown DVD: Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Queen Latifah, Seann William Scott |website=Fox Store|access-date=October 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220055830/http://www.foxstore.com/detail?item=2608 |archive-date=December 20, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> They were released in the UK on October 23, 2006, and both include a new Scrat short, ''[[No Time for Nuts]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film exceeded expectations by opening with an $68,033,544 in its first weekend. This was the second biggest opening for a non-summer, non-holiday release, after the $83,848,082 of ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. The film set a record for the highest-grossing opening weekend in March, which lasted a year till it was surpassed by the $70,885,301 weekend of ''[[300 (film)|300]]''. The film grossed a total of $195,330,621 at [[United States]] and Canadian box offices, making it the first film in 2006 to pass the $100 million mark.
