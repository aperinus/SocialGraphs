The film is the [[directorial debut]] of [[Rupert Sanders]], with a screenplay by [[Evan Daugherty]], [[John Lee Hancock]] and [[Hossein Amini]], from a screen story by Daugherty. The cast includes [[Kristen Stewart]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Chris Hemsworth]], [[Sam Claflin]], and [[Bob Hoskins]] in his final film performance. In the film's retelling of the tale, Snow White grows up imprisoned by her evil stepmother, [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]], a powerful sorceress. After Snow White escapes into the forest, Ravenna enlists [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric the Huntsman]] to capture her, but he becomes her companion in a quest to overthrow Ravenna.\n\n''Snow White and the Huntsman'' was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on May 30, 2012 and in the United States on June 1, 2012, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It was a success at the box office, earning $396 million worldwide against a $170 million budget. Although critics praised the production design and visual effects, Theron and Hemsworth's performances, and the musical score and action sequences, Stewart and Claflin's performances received mixed reviews, and the screenplay was heavily criticized. The film received two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]].\n\nA [[prequel]]/[[sequel]], titled ''[[The Huntsman: Winter's War]]'', directed by the first film's visual effects supervisor [[Cedric Nicolas-Troyan]], was released on April 22, 2016. Hemsworth, Theron, Claflin and [[Nick Frost]] reprised their roles and new characters were played by [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Jessica Chastain]]. Stewart did not reprise her role, but appeared in [[archive footage]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile admiring a bright red rose blooming during a white winter, Queen Eleanor of the Kingdom of Tabor pricks her finger on its thorns. Drops of blood fall onto the snow, and she wishes for a daughter with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, hair as black as a raven's wings, and a heart as strong as the rose. She gives birth to [[Snow White]] but falls ill and dies many years later. After her death, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|King Magnus]], and his army battle an invading army of glass soldiers. King Magnus finds a prisoner called Ravenna, becomes enchanted with her beauty and marries her.\n\n[[Queen (Snow White)|Ravenna]] is in fact a powerful sorceress who used the false glass army to charm her way into the kingdom. On their wedding night, she confesses that there was a king much like Magnus that used her, hurt her, then discarded her. She kills Magnus before taking over the kingdom. Snow White's childhood friend William and his father, Duke Hammond, escape but are unable to rescue her, and she is locked away in a tower for years.\n\nTabor and its people deteriorate under Queen Ravenna\u2019s rule. She periodically drains the youth from the kingdom's young women in order to maintain a spell cast over her as a child by her mother, which allows her to keep her youthful beauty. When her stepdaughter Snow White comes of age, she learns from her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] that Snow White is destined to destroy her unless she consumes the girl's heart, which will make her immortal. Ravenna orders her brother Finn to bring her the princess but Snow White escapes into the Dark Forest, where Ravenna has no power. Ravenna makes a bargain with [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric the Huntsman]], a widower and drunkard, to capture Snow White, promising to bring his wife back to life in exchange. But when Finn reveals that Ravenna does not actually have the power to revive the dead, the Huntsman helps Snow White escape. The Duke and William learn that Snow White is alive and William leaves the castle to find her, joining Finn's group as a bowman.\n\nSnow White saves the Huntsman's life by charming a troll that attacks them. They make their way to a fishing village populated by women who have disfigured themselves to make themselves useless to Ravenna. The Huntsman learns Snow White's true identity, and leaves her in the care of the women. He returns when he sees the village being burned down by Finn's men. Snow White and the Huntsman evade them and meet a band of [[Seven Dwarfs|eight dwarfs]]. The blind dwarf Muir perceives that Snow White is the only person who can end Ravenna's reign.\n\nAs they travel through a fairy sanctuary, they are attacked by Finn and his men. A battle ensues during which Finn, his men, and one of the dwarfs are killed. William joins the group on their journey to Hammond's castle. Ravenna disguises herself as William and tempts Snow White into eating a poisoned apple before fleeing. William kisses Snow White; though nothing happens, a tear slips out of her eyes. Her body is taken to Hammond's castle. The Huntsman professes his regret for being unable to save her, as her heart and strength remind him of his wife, Sara. He kisses her and does not notice a second tear fall from her eyes, as two kisses of true love breaks the spell. Snow White awakens and rallies the Duke's army to mount a siege against Ravenna.\n\nThe dwarfs infiltrate the castle through the sewers and open the gates, allowing the army inside. Snow White and Ravenna fight; Ravenna is about to kill her when Snow White uses a move the Huntsman taught her and stabs Ravenna, defeating her. The kingdom once again enjoys peace as Snow White is crowned the new Queen of Tabor.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as [[Snow White]],<ref name=\"TwitterMainCast\">{{cite web|work=[[Twitter]]|url=https://www.twitter.com/universaluk/status/70136430101405697|title=We are pleased to confirm the Snow White and the Huntsman cast will be Kristen Stewart, Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth and Sam Claflin|access-date=July 25, 2011}}</ref> the daughter of King Magnus and Queen Eleanor and the step-daughter of the evil queen Ravenna.\n** [[Raffey Cassidy]] as young [[Snow White]]\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]], Snow White's evil stepmother\n** [[Izzy Meikle-Small]] as young [[Queen (Snow White)|Ravenna]]\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric the Huntsman]], a widower and drunkard, who helps Snow White escape Ravenna.\n* [[Sam Claflin]] as [[Prince Charming|William]], son of Duke Hammond\n** Xavier Atkins as young [[Prince Charming|William]]\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as Finn, Ravenna's brother and enforcer\n** Elliot Reeve as young Finn\n* [[Vincent Regan]] as Duke Hammond, William's father\n* [[Lily Cole]] as Greta, a young girl who befriends Snow White\n* [[Noah Huntley]] as [[King (Snow White)|King Magnus]], Snow White's father\n* [[Liberty Ross]] as Queen Eleanor, Snow White's mother\n* [[Chris Obi]] as the voice of [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Mirror Man]], the physical form of the Magic Mirror\n* [[Rachael Stirling]] as Anna\n* Hattie Gotobed as Lily\n* [[Greg Hicks]] as Black Knight General\n* [[Peter Ferdinando]] as Black Knight\n* [[Anastasia Hille]] as Ravenna's Mother\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Percy\n}}\n\n===[[Seven Dwarfs|The Dwarfs]]===\nThe Dwarfs were played by actors of average height who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies.
