The film stars [[Jane Fonda]] as the title character, a space-traveller and representative of the United Earth government sent to find scientist Durand Durand, who has created a weapon that could destroy humanity. The supporting cast includes [[John Phillip Law]], [[Anita Pallenberg]], [[Milo O'Shea]], [[Marcel Marceau]], [[David Hemmings]], [[Ugo Tognazzi]] and [[Claude Dauphin (actor)|Claude Dauphin]].\n\nHaving expressed an interest in comics and science fiction, Vadim was hired to direct ''Barbarella'' after producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] purchased the film rights to the comic series. Vadim attempted to cast several actresses&mdash;[[Brigitte Bardot]] and [[Sophia Loren]]&mdash;in the title role before choosing Fonda, his then-wife. A friend of Vadim's, [[Terry Southern]], wrote the initial screenplay, which changed considerably during filming and led to seven other writers credited in the final release, including Vadim and Forest, the latter of whom also worked on the film's production design. The film began shooting immediately following the completion of another De Laurentiis comic adaptation, ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'', with both films sharing several cast and crew members.\n\nThe film was particularly popular in the United Kingdom, where it was the year's second-highest-grossing film. Contemporary film critics praised ''Barbarella''{{'s}} visuals and cinematography, but found its storyline weak after the first few scenes. Although several attempts at sequels, remakes, and other adaptations have been planned, none of these have entered production.\n\n==Plot==\nIn an unspecified future,{{efn|Although not identified in the film itself, reviews and press materials have variously stated that the film takes place in either the [[41st century]]{{sfn|Conrad|2018|p=108}} or the year 40,000 [[Anno Domini|AD]].{{sfn|Parks|1999|p=260}}}}  space adventurer Barbarella is sent by the Earth's president to retrieve Durand Durand from the Tau Ceti planetary system. Durand is the inventor of a laser-powered weapon, the positronic ray, which Earth's leaders fear will cause mass destruction. Barbarella crash-lands on Tau Ceti's 16th planet{{efn|In some promotional materials, the planet is named Lythion.<ref name=\"QOTG\" />}} and is knocked unconscious by two children. They bring her to the wreckage of a spaceship, where they bind and attack her using mechanical dolls with razor-sharp teeth. Barbarella is rescued by Mark Hand, the Catchman who patrols the ice looking for errant children. Hand tells her that Durand is in the city of Sogo and offers her a ride to her ship in his ice boat. When Barbarella offers to repay him, Hand asks her to make love to him. Barbarella is confused, since Earthlings no longer have intimate physical contact; instead they take pills \"until full rapport is achieved.\" Hand suggests having sex in his bed instead. Barbarella relents and enjoys it but admits that she understands why sex is considered primitive and distracting on Earth.\n\nBarbarella leaves the planet and crashes into a labyrinth inhabited by outcasts exiled from Sogo. She is found by Pygar, a blind angel who has lost the will to fly. Pygar introduces her to Professor Ping, who offers to repair her ship. Pygar flies Barbarella to Sogo, a den of violence and debauchery, after she restores his will to fly by having sex with him. Pygar and Barbarella are captured by Sogo's Black Queen and her concierge. The concierge describes the Mathmos:{{sfn|Curti|2016|p=85}} living energy in liquid form, powered by evil thoughts and used as an energy source in Sogo, which sits atop it. Pygar endures a mock crucifixion and Barbarella is placed in a cage, where hundreds of birds prepare to attack her. She is rescued by Dildano, leader of the local underground, who joins in her pursuit of Durand. Dildano gives her an invisible key to the Black Queen's chamber of dreams, where she sleeps.\n\nAfter returning to Sogo, Barbarella is promptly recaptured by the concierge. He places her in the \"Exsexsive Machine\" which induces fatal sexual pleasure. She outlasts the machine and makes it go haywire. The concierge, shocked at its destruction, reveals himself as Durand Durand. Barbarella is surprised since he is only 25 years old but has aged tremendously&mdash;a side-effect of the Mathmos. Durand wants to overthrow the Black Queen and become Sogo's new leader, which requires using his positronic ray and gaining access to the Queen's chamber of dreams. Durand takes Barbarella to the chamber and locks her inside with the invisible key. She sees the Queen, who warns that if two people are in the chamber, the Mathmos will devour them. Durand seizes control of Sogo as Dildano and his rebels begin their attack on the city. The Black Queen retaliates by releasing the Mathmos to destroy Sogo. Because of Barbarella's innocence, the Mathmos forms a protective bubble around her and the Black Queen and safely expels them. They find Pygar, who clutches them in his arms and flies off. When Barbarella asks Pygar why he saved a tyrant, he tells her that an angel has no memory of the past.\n\n==Cast==\n* Jane Fonda as [[Barbarella (character)|Barbarella]]\n* [[John Phillip Law]] as Pygar\n* [[Anita Pallenberg]] and [[Joan Greenwood]] (voice) as The Black Queen, Great Tyrant of Sogo\n* [[Marcel Marceau]] as Professor Ping\n* [[Milo O'Shea]] as Durand-Durand\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Dildano\n* [[Ugo Tognazzi]] as Mark Hand\n* [[Claude Dauphin (actor)|Claude Dauphin]] as The President of Earth\n* [[V\u00e9ronique Vendell]] as Captain Moon\n* [[Serge Marquand]] as Captain Sun\n* [[Giancarlo Cobelli]] as The Revolutionary\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\nHaving bought the film rights to [[Jean-Claude Forest]]'s ''[[Barbarella (comics)|Barbarella]]'' comics, producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] secured a distribution deal in the United States between France's Marianne Productions and [[Paramount Pictures]]. He planned to film ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'', a less-expensive feature, to help cover production costs.{{sfn|Curti|2016|p=85}} In 1966 [[Roger Vadim]] expressed an admiration for comics (particularly [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]''), saying that he liked \"the wild humor and impossible exaggeration of comic strips\" and wanted to \"do something in that style myself in my next film, ''Barbarella''.\"<ref name=\"CurtissNYT\">{{cite news|title=And Vadim 'Created' Jane Fonda|last=Curtiss|first=Thomas Quinn|page=X15|date=16 January 1966|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Vadim saw the film as a chance to \"depict a new futuristic morality ...

Southern, who had known Vadim in Paris during the early 1950s, saw writing a science-fiction comedy based on a comic book as a new challenge.{{sfn|Gerber|Lisanti|2014|p=53}} He enjoyed writing the script, particularly the opening striptease and the scenes with tiny robotic toys pursuing Barbarella to bite her. Southern enjoyed working with Vadim and Fonda, but he felt that De Laurentiis was intent only on making a cheap film that was not necessarily good.{{sfn|Gerber|Lisanti|2014|p=70}} Southern said later, \"Vadim wasn't particularly interested in the script, but he was a lot of fun, with a discerning eye for the erotic, grotesque, and the absurd. And Jane Fonda was super in all regards.\"{{sfn|McGilligan|1997|p=385}} Southern was surprised to see his screenplay credited to Vadim and several Italian screenwriters in addition to himself.{{sfn|Gerber|Lisanti|2014|p=70}} Credited screenwriters included Claude Brul\u00e9, Vittorio Bonicelli, Clement Biddle Wood, [[Brian Degas]], [[Tudor Gates]], and Forest;<ref name=\"mfb-review\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Barbarella|volume=38|issue=408|pages=167\u2013168|year=1968|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref> Degas and Gates were hired by De Laurentiis after he was impressed with their work on ''Danger: Diabolik''.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=724}} [[Charles B. Griffith]] later said that he had done uncredited work on the script; the production team \"hired fourteen other writers\" after Southern \"before they got to me. I didn't get credit because I was the last one.\" According to Griffith, he \"rewrote about a quarter of the film that was shot, then re-shot, and I added the concept that there had been thousands of years since violence existed, so that Barbarella was very clumsy all through the picture.

[[Brigitte Bardot]], who was not interested in a sexualized role.  [[Sophia Loren]], who was pregnant and felt that she would not fit the role.{{sfn|Parks|1999|p=259}} Fonda was uncertain about the film, but Vadim convinced her by saying that science fiction was a rapidly-evolving genre. Before filming ''Barbarella'', she was the subject of two sex scandals: the first when her nude body was displayed across an eight-story billboard promoting the premiere of ''[[Circle of Love (film)|Circle of Love]]'' in 1965, and the second when several candid nude photos from Vadim's closed set for ''[[The Game Is Over]]'' were sold to ''[[Playboy]]'' the following year. According to biographer [[Thomas Kiernan (biographer)|Thomas Kiernan]], the billboard incident made her a sex symbol in the United States.{{sfn|Parks|1999|p=259}} Vadim said he did not want the actress to play Barbarella \"tongue in cheek\", and he saw the character as \"just a lovely, average girl with a terrific space record and a lovely body. I am not going to intellectualise her. Although there is going to be a bit of satire about our morals and our ethics, the picture is going to be more of a spectacle than a cerebral exercise for a few way-out intellectuals.\"<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news|title=What Kind of Supergirl Will Jane Fonda Be as Barbarella?|last=Aba|first=Marika|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=10 September 1967|page=C12}}</ref> Fonda felt her priority for Barbarella was to \"keep her innocent\"; the character \"is not a vamp and her sexuality is not measured by the rules of our society. She is not being promiscuous but she follows the natural reaction of another type of upbringing. She is not a so-called 'sexually liberated woman' either. That would mean rebellion against something. She is different. She was born free\".<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nFonda personally recommended [[John Phillip Law]] as Pygar to Vadim following their work on ''[[Hurry Sundown (film)|Hurry Sundown]]''; for the duration of his stay in Rome, the actor lived with Fonda, Vadim and Forest in their rented villa on [[Appian Way]]. Law, an avid comic book reader since childhood, read the Forest comics and studied the [[DC Comics]] character [[Hawkman]] for inspiration. The delayed pre-production of ''Barbarella'' allowed Law to film two roles before committing to the film: as Bill Meceita in the [[Spaghetti Western]] ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]'', and as the [[Diabolik|title character]] in ''Danger: Diabolik''.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=727}} For the role of the Black Queen, Southern recommended model [[Anita Pallenberg]], the then-girlfriend of [[The Rolling Stones]] member [[Brian Jones]]; Southern had befriended her while working with the band on an [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|adaptation]] of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.<ref name=\"TCM\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17963/barbarella#articles-reviews?articleId=181205|title=In the Know - Barbarella (TRIVIA)|work=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]]|access-date=6 November 2020|archive-date=27 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027141759/https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/17963/barbarella/#articles-reviews?articleId=181205|url-status=live}}</ref> On the English-language prints of the film, Pallenberg's voice was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by English actress [[Joan Greenwood]].{{sfn|Hughes|2014|p=102}}\n\nFrench mime [[Marcel Marceau]] had his first speaking role in the film as Professor Ping.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Marcel Marceau to Speak|page=54|date=22 September 1967}}</ref> Comparing Ping to his stage persona Bip the Clown and [[Harpo Marx]], he said that he did not \"forget the lines, but I have trouble organising them.

For the scenes involving the Excessive Pleasure Machine, Fonda and Milo O'Shea were not told of explosions that would happen on set since the prop was rigged with flares and smoke bombs. Fonda explained that \"Vadim wanted us to look natural, so he didn't tell us what a big explosion there would be. When the machine blew up, flames and smoke were everywhere, and sparks were running up and down the wires. I was frightened to death, and poor Milo was convinced something had really gone wrong and I was being electrocuted.\"<ref name=\"ebertInt\" />\n\nFor the scene involving Barbarella being attacked by hummingbirds, wrens and lovebirds were used as it was illegal to ship hummingbirds overseas. The birds were not behaving as Vadim had expected, which led to him employing a large fan to blow them at Fonda, who had birdseed in her costume. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], after visiting the set, wrote that the fan led to birds \"losing control over natural body functions, so it was all a little messy\".
