Starring [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Kelly Preston]], it follows the [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] performance of an aging star baseball pitcher, Billy Chapel as he deals with the pressures of pitching in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in the [[Bronx]] in his final outing by calming himself with memories about a long-term relationship with Jane Aubrey.\n\nThe play-by-play of the game is announced by longtime [[History of the Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball broadcaster [[Vin Scully]], who himself called four perfect games in his career, and [[Steve Lyons (baseball)|Steve Lyons]].\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office disappointment, grossing $46.1 million against a $50 million production budget. Costner received a nomination for the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Detroit Tigers]] travel to New York to play a [[Major League Baseball schedule|season]]-ending series against the [[New York Yankees]]. At 63\u201397, the team has long since been eliminated from playoff contention and are playing for nothing but pride against the Yankees, who have a chance to clinch the [[American League East]] with a win.\n\nIn his [[Manhattan]] hotel suite, 40-year-old pitcher Billy Chapel awaits his girlfriend Jane Aubrey, but she doesn't show. Jane is a single mother with a teenage daughter Heather whom Billy got to know. The next morning, Billy is told by Tigers' owner Gary Wheeler that the team has been sold and that the new owners' first move will be to end Billy's 19-year tenure with the Tigers by trading him to the [[San Francisco Giants]]. Billy learns from Jane that she is leaving that same day to accept a job offer in [[London]].\n\nBilly is a famous, accomplished pitcher, but has a losing record this season, is near the end of his career, and is recovering from a hand injury. Wheeler hints that Billy should consider retiring rather than join another team. As he goes to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] to make his last start of the year, Billy reflects about Jane, detailing how they met five years prior. These flashbacks are interspersed within the game, along with glimpses of Jane watching the game on a television at the airport.\n\nAs the game progresses, Billy dominates the Yankees' batters, often talking to himself on how to pitch each one. While in the dugout resting between innings, Billy reflects how he shut Jane out of his life after he suffered a career-threatening injury in the off-season. The pain of pitching gets worse as the game goes on.\n\nBilly is so caught up in his thoughts that he does not realize he is pitching a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] until he looks at the scoreboard in the bottom of the eighth inning. Friend and catcher Gus Sinski confirms that no one has reached base, and that the whole team is rallying behind Billy to do whatever it takes to keep the perfect game bid alive. Billy's shoulder pain has become intense, and after he throws his first two pitches of the inning well out of the [[strike zone]], Tigers [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] Frank Perry makes the call to warm up two [[relief pitcher]]s in the [[bullpen]]. The count goes to 3\u20130 before Billy recalls pitching to his father (now deceased) in the back yard. He rallies and throws a strike, then gets the batter out on the next pitch.\n\nBefore the Tigers take the field for the bottom of the ninth inning, Billy has final ruminations about his career and his love for Jane. He autographs a baseball for Wheeler, who has been like a father to him for many years. Along with a signature, Billy inscribes the ball with \"Tell them I'm through. For love of the game.\" Ken Strout comes up representing the last chance for New York. Strout chops up the middle just out of the reach of Chapel, heading towards center field. The Tigers' shortstop dives and throws to first in time to retire Strout, giving Chapel his perfect game.\n\nBilly sits alone in his hotel room as the realization sinks in that everything he has been and done for the past 19 years is over. Despite his amazing accomplishment, Billy weeps not only for the loss of baseball, but for the other love of his life, Jane.\n\nThe next morning, Billy goes to the airport to inquire about a flight for London. Jane had missed her flight the night before so she could watch the end of his perfect game. He finds her there waiting for her plane and they embrace and reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Billy Chapel\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Jane Aubrey\n* [[John C.

It was moving and simple and I love baseball. I love baseball and I thought it hadn't really been put on film and I wanted to see it on the wide screen format. I thought that would be exciting for the audience, like being at a game. I get so excited by some baseball games I wanted to see if I could put some of that into the picture.

Costner objected to the edits but was overruled by [[Universal Pictures]], and his contract specified that he only had final cut privilege so long as the film was rated \"PG-13\" and had a running time of less than 2 hours, 10 minutes. A week before the film was to hit theatres, he voiced his complaints in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' interview, a breach of professional etiquette when speaking about a current film that one appears in.<ref name=\"Costnless\" /> Universal Pictures co-chairman Stacey Snider, while agreeing with Costner that the cuts the Motion Picture Association demanded were unjust, stated, \"Kevin's not the director and it's not fair for him to hijack a $50-million asset. I realize this is very much about principle for Kevin, but principle doesn\u2019t mean that you never compromise. Our feeling is that we have backed the filmmaker and his name is Sam Raimi, not Kevin Costner.\"<ref name=\"Costnless\" /> Raimi, while supporting Universal's decision and agreeing that a \"PG-13\" rating was a necessity, said he sympathized with Costner's feelings and wished the lines could have been kept in without losing the \"PG-13\" rating.<ref name=\"Costnless\" /> Universal compromised with Costner on the length, allowing a final cut of 2 hours, 17 minutes.
