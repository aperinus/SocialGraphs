The film stars [[Julianne Moore]], [[Michael Angarano]], [[Greg Kinnear]], [[Lily Collins]], and [[Nathan Lane]], and was written by [[Dan and Stacy Chariton]]. It received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=November 2015}}\nLinda Sinclair ([[Julianne Moore]]) is a high school English teacher in the small town of [[Kingston, Pennsylvania]]. She is passionate about her subject and popular with her students, but lives alone in simple circumstances. Cursed with a hopeless romantic soul, she lives in a world of men unable to match her impossible standards.\n\nWhen her former star pupil Jason Sherwood ([[Michael Angarano]]) returns after graduating from [[New York University|NYU]]'s playwriting program, crushed and insecure after failing to succeed, Linda and drama teacher Carl Kapinas ([[Nathan Lane]]) convince him to produce his play at the school. Jason's father, Dr. Tom Sherwood ([[Greg Kinnear]]), pressures him to attend law school instead, which he finally relents to with no other prospects in sight.\n\nComplications arise after Linda and Jason, in a moment of impulsive creative madness, have a sexual encounter on her classroom desk. Various jealousies and rumors ensue, affecting her and everyone around her including the production of Jason's play. When the school heads are confronted with proof of her indiscretion with a former student, Linda is fired on the spot.\n\nEmbarrassed, Linda hurries off, gets into a minor car collision, and ends up at a hospital where she's attended to by Dr. Sherwood. She is moved by his gracious manner after having been mean to him on a previous occasion. She guiltily admits to having had sex with his son.\n\nWith news of advance-ticket sales of beyond $18,000 for Jason's play, the principal backtracks, persuading Linda to return and resume directing duties so the play may go on. However, the school heads require a new ending for the play as the current one is considered overly violent and fear parents will be outraged by its dark themes of murder and suicide. Jason feels betrayed and refuses to rewrite the play's ending, so Linda is forced to come up with a suitable replacement herself. She manages to write an improved ending which appeases the school and Jason (when he sees the play is a success).\n\nJason moves on to write further plays as Linda eases back into teaching and regaining her reputation. Sometime later, Linda runs into Jason's father at her favorite bookshop. Catching up over coffee, both realize they'd totally misread each other previously. Grateful for all she has done for his son, and pleasantly surprised they have much more in common than previously thought, Tom invites Linda on a further proper date, and she, somewhat hesitantly, accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Linda Sinclair \n* [[Michael Angarano]] as Jason Sherwood\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Dr. Tom Sherwood\n* [[Lily Collins]] as Halle Anderson\n* [[Nathan Lane]] as Carl Kapinas\n* [[Jessica Hecht]] as Principal Trudie Slocum\n* [[Norbert Leo Butz]] as Vice-Principal Phil Pelaski\n* [[Nikki Blonsky]] as Sheila Nussbaum\n* [[Erin Wilhelmi]] as Joni Gerber\n* [[Alan Aisenberg]] as Benjamin Meyer\n* [[Charlie Saxton]] as Will\n* Sophie Curtis as Fallon Hughes\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] (voice only) as Narrator\n\n==Production==\n''The English Teacher'' was first announced in September 2011.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web|title=Julianne Moore, Greg Kinnear To Star In 'The English Teacher'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/julianne_moore_greg_kinnear_to_star_in_the_english_teacher|publisher=IndieWire|date=9 September 2011|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> It was Zisk's feature film directorial debut, following his work on several television shows, including ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', ''[[The Big C (TV series)|The Big C]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', and ''[[The United States of Tara]]''.<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite web|title=Tribeca Film Festival announces new Richard Linklater, David Gordon Green films for line-up|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/03/06/tribeca-film-festival-2013-features/|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 15, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|title=Cinedigm & Tribeca Film Team Up To Distribute Julianne Moore and Nathan Lane Starring 'The English Teacher'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/cinedigm-and-tribeca-film-team-up-to-distribute-julianne-moore-and-nathan-lane-starring-the-english-teacher|work=IndieWire|date=12 February 2013|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 26, 2013, followed by a US theatrical release on May 17.<ref>{{cite web|title=Julianne Moore, Michael Angarano in 'The English Teacher' - trailer |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a470403/julianne-moore-michael-angarano-in-the-english-teacher-trailer.html?rss |publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=April 5, 2013|date=April 4, 2013}}</ref> It was released in 7 theaters, and earned $104,810 domestically at the box office, and $215,203 in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $320,013.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> The film also had a [[video on demand]] release.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 41% based on reviews from 37 critics, with an average rating of 5.39/10.<ref>{{cite web |title= The English Teacher |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_english_teacher/ |work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= August 20, 2013 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 42 out of 100, based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title= The English Teacher |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-english-teacher |website= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://englishteachermovie.com/}}\n* [http://besttefl.com/ielts-toeic-toefl-preparation-online Online English Teacher]\n* {{IMDb title|2055765|The English Teacher}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:English Teacher, The}}\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:2013 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Rob Simonsen]]\n[[Category:Films set in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:2013 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2013 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2013 drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]"}]}}}}
