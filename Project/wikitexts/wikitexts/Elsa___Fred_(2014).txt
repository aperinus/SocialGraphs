It is produced by Matthias Ehrenberg, Ed Saxon, Jose Levy, Nicolas Veinberg and Rob Weston. The film stars [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Christopher Plummer]]. The film, set and filmed in [[New Orleans]], is an English-language remake of the 2005 [[Spain|Spanish]]-[[Argentinian]] [[Elsa & Fred (2005 film)|film of the same name]]. It was the final film appearance of [[George Segal]] before he died on March 23, 2021.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe recently widowed, 80-year-old Fred Barcroft is moved by his daughter, against his will, into an apartment in [[New Orleans]], next door to 74-year-old Elsa Hayes. Fred has become embittered, considers himself a realist, but spends most of his time lying down. Elsa is a flighty, vivacious romanticist who dreams of \"the sweet life in Rome,\" as lived by [[Anita Ekberg]] in the 1961 film ''[[La Dolce Vita]]''. Despite their opposite temperaments and outlooks on life, they fall in love.\n\nElsa coaxes Fred out of his shell, but tries his patience by telling him several lies about herself. She claims to be a widow and hides her severe kidney disease, which requires [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]].  Fred doesn't know whether or not to believe Elsa's claim that [[Pablo Picasso]] made a painting of her. She says that she has it in a safe, for which she has misplaced the key.\n\n[[Erika Alexander]] plays the aide Laverne, who regularly cares for Fred. As she sees him daily, she provides a lively counterpoint and commentary on his developing relationship with Elsa.\n\nWhen Fred learns from his doctor friend John that Elsa is probably dying, he takes her to Rome to fulfill her dream of wading (like Ekberg) in the [[Trevi Fountain]]. He chooses this rather than investing in his son-in-law's dubious business venture. After Elsa dies, her son opens her safe and gives Fred the painting by Picasso, which Elsa bequeathed to him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Elsa Hayes\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Fred Barcroft\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Lydia Barcroft, Fred's Daughter\n* [[Chris Noth]] as Jack, Lydia's Husband\n* [[Jared Gilman]] as Michael, Fred's Grandson\n* [[Scott Bakula]] as Raymond Hayes, Elsa's Eldest Son\n* Deanna Meske as Laura Hayes, Raymond's Wife\n* McCartney Bisgard as Carla Hayes\n* [[Erika Alexander]] as Laverne\n* [[Reg Rogers]] as Alec Hayes, Elsa's Youngest Son \n* [[George Segal]] as John, Fred's Doctor and Friend\n* [[James Brolin]] as Max Hayes, Elsa's Estranged Husband\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Armande, The Building Superintendent\n* [[Osvaldo R\u00edos]] as Doctor\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[New Orleans]] because of tax incentives, according to MacLaine.<ref name=iw/> Plummer declared he does not consider it a remake of the 2005 film, as \"Shirley and I, and Michael totally rewrote it. So I prefer to think of it as the English-language version.\"<ref name=iw/>\n\nThe scene in Rome where MacLaine and Plummer wade into the [[Trevi Fountain]] is shot in black and white, to mimic the corresponding scene in ''[[La Dolce Vita]]''.\n\n==Release and reception==\n[[File:Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer.jpg|thumb|MacLaine and Plummer at the [[Miami International Film Festival]] premiere of the film.]]\nDuring the 2014 [[Miami International Film Festival]] in March, ''Elsa & Fred'' received a \"roaring response\", according to John Anderson of [[IndieWire]].<ref name=iw>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/miami-film-fest-plummer-maclaine-star-in-elsa-fred | title=Miami Film Fest: Plummer & MacLaine Star in 'Elsa & Fred' | author=Anderson, John | date=March 8, 2014 | publisher=[[IndieWire]] | accessdate=October 30, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030200019/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/miami-film-fest-plummer-maclaine-star-in-elsa-fred | archive-date=October 30, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In September, at the 2014 [[Cin\u00e9fest Sudbury International Film Festival]], it was awarded the Audience Choice Award.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2014/09/24-cinefest-awards-sudbury.aspx | title=Cin\u00e9fest Sudbury hands out hardware | date=September 24, 2014 | work=[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]] | publisher=[[Laurentian Media Group]] | accessdate=October 30, 2014}}</ref> However, Rich Heldenfels said the film \"was not well received\" and pointed out that reviews \"are mostly negative\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ohio.com/entertainment/mailbag-maclaine-movie-dallas-ends-where-is-david-gregory-1.570488 | title=Mailbag: MacLaine movie; 'Dallas' ends; where is David Gregory? | author=Heldenfels, Rich | work=[[Akron Beacon-Journal]] | date=February 7, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526003345/http://www.ohio.com/entertainment/mailbag-maclaine-movie-dallas-ends-where-is-david-gregory-1.570488 | archive-date=May 26, 2015 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released by [[Millennium Entertainment]] in the United States on November 7, 2014 in select theaters.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pcmworldnews.com/news/2014/10/elsa-fred-starts-limited-run-november-7/ | title='Elsa & Fred' Starts Limited Run November 7 | date=October 2014 | author=Jones, Stephanie | publisher=[[PCM, Inc.|PCM]] | accessdate=October 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2113659|Elsa & Fred}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|elsa_and_fred_2014}}\n\n{{Michael Radford}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elsa and Fred (2014 film)}}\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2014 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2014 drama films]]\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:2014 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of Argentine films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of Spanish films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Fictional couples]]\n[[Category:Films about old age]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Radford]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Orleans]]"}]}}}}
