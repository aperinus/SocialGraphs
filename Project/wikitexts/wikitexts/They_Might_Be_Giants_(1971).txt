Scott]] and [[Joanne Woodward]]. Sometimes mistakenly described as a Broadway play, it never in fact opened in the United States. It was directed in [[London]] by [[Joan Littlewood]] in 1961, but Goldman believed that he \"never got the play right\" and forbade further productions or publication of the script. To coincide with the film's release, he authorized an illustrated paperback tie-in edition of the screenplay, published by [[Lancer Books]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe film's title was later adopted as the name of [[They Might Be Giants|a popular music group]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:They Might Be Giants trailer.jpg|220px|left|thumb|Joanne Woodward and George C. Scott in ''They Might Be Giants''.]]\nJustin Playfair (Scott) is a [[judge]] who retreats into [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] after his wife's death, imagining himself to be [[Sherlock Holmes]], the legendary fictional detective. Complete with [[deerstalker]] hat, pipe and violin, he spends his days in a homemade criminal laboratory obsessing over plots hatched by his (Holmes's) archenemy, [[Professor Moriarty]].\n\nWhen his brother ([[Lester Rawlins]]) tries to place Justin under observation in a mental institution so he can get [[power of attorney]], Justin attracts the attention of Dr. Mildred Watson (Woodward), a psychiatrist who becomes fascinated by his case. Justin demonstrates to her a knack for [[Sherlock Holmes#Holmesian deduction|what Holmes describes as \"deduction\"]] (technically better categorized as [[abductive reasoning]]) and walks out of the institution during the ensuing confusion. Intrigued, Watson comes to his home to attempt treatment. Playfair is initially dismissive of Watson's attempts to [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyze]] him and he analyzes her instead, but when he hears her name, he enthusiastically incorporates her into his life as [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Doctor Watson]], the sidekick to his Holmes.\n\nThe duo begin an enigmatic quest for Moriarty, with Playfair/Holmes following all manner of bizarre and (to Watson) unintelligible clues, and encountering a rich tapestry of individualistic persons in assorted urban situations, the two growing closer to each other in the process.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[George C.

Despite the protest of his aide Sancho Panza and being soundly defeated at the hands of the \"giants\" (that is, being tossed away by a mill's sail after getting his lance caught in it), Quixote maintains his belief that the mills are not buildings but giants. In reference to this, the character Playfair argues:\n\n<blockquote>Of course, he carried it a bit too far. He thought that every windmill was a giant. That's insane. But, thinking that they might be... Well, all the best minds used to think [[Flat Earth|the world was flat]]. But, what if it isn't? It might be round. And [[penicillin|bread mold might be medicine]]. If we never looked at things and thought of what they might be, why, we'd all still be out there in the tall grass with the apes.</blockquote>\n\n==Critical views==\nThe film opened to mixed reviews. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"a mushy movie with occasional, isolated moments of legitimate comedy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E7D71E3BE73ABC4852DFB066838A669EDE/|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=They Might Be Giants|author-link=Vincent Canby|last=Canby |first=Vincent|date=June 10, 1971}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating 73% based on reviews from 11 critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/they_might_be_giants/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=They Might be Giants}}</ref>\n\n==Releases==\nThe original release length was 98 minutes. Netflix's streaming version, the Kino Blu-ray, and the Anchor Bay DVD released in 2000 are just over 91 minutes. A version edited for television in 1986 was 96:29. The currently available made-on-demand DVD runs slightly over 87 minutes. None of the home video releases include the full film. The largest missing material is a long sequence near the end that takes place in a grocery store.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067848/alternateversions |website=[[IMDb]]|title=Alternate Versions of ''They Might Be Giants''}}</ref> Powerhouse Films will release the film on Blu-ray under their ''Indicator'' label in January 2023, which will include all three cuts of the film.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0067848|They Might Be Giants}}\n* {{TCMDb title|92840|They Might Be Giants}}\n* {{Letterboxd film|they-might-be-giants}}\n* {{Allmovie title|49419|They Might Be Giants}}\n\n{{HolmesFilms}}\n{{Anthony Harvey}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:They Might Be Giants}}\n[[Category:1971 films]]\n[[Category:1970s comedy mystery films]]\n[[Category:American comedy mystery films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Anthony Harvey]]\n[[Category:Films produced by John Foreman (producer)]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Barry (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by James Goldman]]\n[[Category:Sherlock Holmes films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
