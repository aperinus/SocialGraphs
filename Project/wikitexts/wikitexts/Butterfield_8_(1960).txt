Insulted, she finds her dress was torn, and takes  Liggett's wife Emily's mink coat to cover herself, scrawling \"No Sale\" in lipstick on the mirror. She orders her telephone answering service, [[Telephone exchange names#United States and Canada|BUtterfield&nbsp;8]], to put Liggett through if he calls.\n\nGloria visits a childhood friend, pianist Steve Carpenter, who chastises her for wasting her life on [[one-night stand]]s, but agrees to ask his girlfriend Norma to lend her a dress. Gloria leaves, and Norma tells Steve he must choose between  Gloria and her. As Norma leaves, he calls, \"Gloria, don't go like this.\" \"My name is Norma,\" she corrects.\n\nLiggett takes a train to the countryside, where his wife Emily is caring for her mother. His friend, Bingham Smith, advises him to end his [[Adultery|adulterous relationships]] and return to Bing's law firm, instead of working for his father-in-law's chemical business. Meanwhile, Gloria lies to her mother Annie, claiming to have spent the night at Norma's.\n\nLiggett returns home. Finding the lipstick and money, he phones Gloria to explain the money was meant for her to buy a new dress, to replace the one that he had torn. While drinking later that night, Liggett advises her to ask a high price for her lovemaking talents. She insists she does not take payment from her dates, and claims she has been hired as a model to advertise the dress she is wearing at three bistros that night. Liggett follows Gloria, watching her flirt with dozens of men at several clubs. He drives her to a run-down motel. After sleeping together, Liggett and Gloria decide to explore their relationship further. They spend five days together, growing closer and falling genuinely in love with one another. They part only after Liggett's wife Emily returns.\n\nWhen Gloria returns home, she confesses to her mother about having been the \"slut of all time\", but declares that that is all over now, since she is truly in love. Gloria visits her psychiatrist, Dr. Tredman, to insist that her relationship with Liggett has cured her of promiscuity.\n\nFor his part, Liggett also plans to change his life, taking up Bing's offer of a job at the law firm. When he returns home, Emily has noticed that her mink is gone. Liggett makes excuses and rushes out to search for Gloria at her regular clubs. He is unable to locate her, but in his search, he is repeatedly confronted with the reality of Gloria's promiscuous past. When Gloria finds Liggett at a bistro the following evening, he drunkenly launches into insults. Gloria drives Liggett to his apartment building where Emily, spotting them from a window above, watches as her husband throws the coat at Gloria, saying he would never give the tainted object back to his wife.\n\nHeartbroken, Gloria goes to Steve, saying that she feels she has \"earned\" the mink coat she is wearing. Having never before taken payment from the men she slept with, she now has, and she laments \"what that makes me\". She recounts that when she was 13, a friend of her widowed mother, Major Hartley, [[Child sexual abuse|taught her about \"evil\"]]. She hates herself because she loved it and thus went on to make her life out of it. Steve insists that Gloria stay the night, since both Gloria and he have to decide what to do next. Norma arrives the next morning, finding Gloria asleep on Steve's couch; having at last made up his mind, he asks Norma to marry him.\n\nThe next day, a now-sober Liggett admits to himself that he still loves Gloria and asks Emily for a divorce. Meanwhile, Gloria tells her mother she is moving to Boston to begin a new life.\n\nUpon discovering Gloria's destination, Liggett drives until he spots her car at a roadside caf\u00e9. He tries to apologize to Gloria by asking her to marry him, but Gloria insists that his insults have \"branded\" her and that her past is a sore spot that no husband would ever truly be able to accept. They profess their love for each other, and though Gloria initially agrees to go with Liggett to the motel, she ultimately changes her mind and flees in her car. Pursuing Gloria's car, Liggett sees her miss a sign for road construction and accidentally hurtle over an embankment to her death. When he returns to the city, Liggett tells his wife about Gloria's death, announces that he is leaving to \"find my pride\", and says that if Emily is still home when he returns, they will see if it has any value to them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Gloria Wandrous\n* [[Laurence Harvey]] as Weston Liggett\n* [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] as Steve Carpenter\n* [[Dina Merrill]] as Emily Liggett\n* [[Mildred Dunnock]] as Mrs. Wandrous\n* [[Betty Field]] as Mrs. Francis Thurber\n* [[Jeffrey Lynn]] as Bingham Smith\n* [[Kay Medford]] as Happy\n* [[Susan Oliver]] as Norma\n* [[George Voskovec]] as Dr. Tredman\n\n==Production==\nThe screenplay was adapted by [[John Michael Hayes]] and [[Charles Schnee]] from O'Hara's 1935 novel, which in turn was based on the mysterious [[death of Starr Faithfull]] in [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]], New York in 1931.<ref name=sutherland /><ref name=ohara /> Faithfull was found dead of drowning on a beach after having apparently been beaten.<ref name=nehs>{{cite web |url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/the-mysterious-death-of-starr-faithfull-reveals-a-boston-mayors-sordid-secret/ |title=The Mysterious Death of Starr Faithfull Reveals a Boston Mayor's Sordid Secret |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |date=2014 |website=newenglandhistoricalsociety.com |publisher=New England Historical Society |access-date=February 22, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611014059/http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/the-mysterious-death-of-starr-faithfull-reveals-a-boston-mayors-sordid-secret |archive-date=June 11, 2015}}</ref> In O'Hara's novel, Gloria Wandrous, the character based on Faithfull, is killed by falling under the paddle wheel of a steamboat.<ref name=ohara /> Aside from optioning the rights to his story, O'Hara was not involved in writing the screenplay for the film, and the film's plot bears only a slight resemblance to his novel.<ref name=sutherland />\n\nLocation filming was done on [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] in the Bronx; and [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]] and [[West Nyack, New York|West Nyack]] in [[Rockland County, New York]].

Until the early 1970s, telephone exchanges were commonly referred to by name instead of by number. BUtterfield&nbsp;8 was an exchange that provided service to upper-class neighborhoods of Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]]. Dialing the letters \"BU\" equates to 28 on the lettered telephone dial, so \"BUtterfield&nbsp;8\" would equate to 288 as the first three digits of a seven-digit phone number.\n\nThe preface to the novel is a notice by the telephone company that an extra digit will be added to all exchanges, \"for instance, the exchange BUtterfield will become BUtterfield 8.\"\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to MGM records, the film made $6.8 million in the US and Canada and $3.2 million in other countries, resulting in a profit to the studio of $1,857,000 - making it MGM's biggest hit of the year.<ref name=\"Mannix\"/>\n\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"we have the ancient, hackneyed story of the tinseled but tarnished prostitute who thinks she has finally discovered the silver lining for her life in Mr. Right ...
