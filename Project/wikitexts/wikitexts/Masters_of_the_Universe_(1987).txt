The film stars [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Frank Langella]], [[Jon Cypher]], [[Chelsea Field]], [[Billy Barty]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Robert Duncan McNeill]], and [[Meg Foster]]. It is based on the [[Mattel]] [[Masters of the Universe|toy line of the same name]] and tells the story of two teenagers who meet [[He-Man]], the most powerful man in the universe, and his friends, who arrive on Earth by chance from their home planet [[Eternia]] and go on a mission to save the universe from He-Man\u2019s [[archenemy]], the evil [[Skeletor]].\n\n''Masters of the Universe'' was released theatrically in the United States on August 7, 1987. It was a critical and [[Box-office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing $17 million worldwide against a budget of $22 million, but is now regarded as a classic [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/he-man-masters-of-the-universe-christopher-yost-writer-1201573946/|title='Thor: Ragnarok' Scribe to Pen 'Masters of the Universe' for Sony |last=Kroll|first=Justin|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2015-08-19|access-date=2016-04-01|quote=spawned a movie... that subsequently became a cult hit}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Masters Of The Universe: 15 Shocking Things You Didn't Know About The Movie |first= Leon |last=Miller |date=2017-09-03 |url=https://screenrant.com/masters-of-the-universe-movie-shocking-trivia-facts-worst/ |quote=it\u2019s since gone on to become a cult classic |work= [[Screen Rant]] |access-date=2017-09-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/04/believe-it-or-not-a-masters-of-the-universe-reboot-is-slated-for-a-2019-release/ |title=Believe it or not, a Masters of the Universe reboot is slated for a 2019 release |first=Randall |last=Colburnon |date=2017-04-28 |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |quote=the colossal flop turned campy cult classic that was 1987\u2019s ''Masters of the Universe'' |access-date=2017-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the planet [[Eternia]], [[Skeletor]]'s army seizes [[Castle Grayskull]], scatters the remaining Eternian defenders, and captures the [[Sorceress of Castle Grayskull|Sorceress of Grayskull]], planning to seize power over the entire universe by the next moonrise. Skeletor's archenemy, the warrior [[He-Man]], veteran soldier Man-At-Arms and his daughter [[Teela]] rescue Gwildor from Skeletor's forces. Gwildor, a Thenorian locksmith, reveals that Skeletor has acquired his invention: a \"Cosmic Key\" that can open a portal to anywhere by utilizing musical notes. The device was stolen by Skeletor's second-in-command, [[Evil-Lyn]], allowing Skeletor to breach Castle Grayskull.\n\nWith Gwildor's remaining prototype of the Key in hand, He-Man and his friends travel to the Castle. They attempt to free the Sorceress but are overwhelmed by Skeletor's army and forced to flee through Gwildor's hastily opened portal, transporting them to [[Earth]]. The Key is misplaced on their arrival and discovered by two [[California]] teenagers, orphaned high school girl [[List of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe characters#Movie characters|Julie Winston]] and her boyfriend [[List of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe characters#Movie characters|Kevin Corrigan]]. While experimenting with the device, they accidentally send a signal that allows Evil-Lyn to track it. She then sends her henchmen Saurod, Blade, [[Beast Man]] and Karg to recover it.\n\nKevin, an aspiring musician, mistakes the Key for a synthesizer and takes it to a music store run by his friend Charlie. Karg's team arrives and chases Julie until He-Man rescues her. Karg's team returns to Grayskull where, incensed by their failure, Skeletor kills Saurod and sends the others back to Earth, with a larger force under Evil-Lyn's command. Unable to find Julie, Kevin is taken to Julie's house by [[List of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe characters#Movie characters|Lubic]], a detective investigating the disturbance created by Karg's team. Suspecting the Key is stolen, Lubic confiscates it from Kevin and leaves. Immediately afterward, Evil-Lyn captures and interrogates Kevin for the Key's location with a mind-control collar, before pursuing Lubic.\n\nJulie and the Eternians release Kevin from the collar before they go after Lubic and the Key. They arrive at Charlie's store, but Skeletor's forces catch up with them and a pitched battle ensues. Evil-Lyn recovers the Key and summons Skeletor to Earth. Skeletor's forces capture the Eternians, and Julie is mortally wounded by Skeletor's lightning blast, which simultaneously erases the memory storage of Gwildor's Key. He-Man surrenders to save his comrades and is returned to Eternia as Skeletor's slave. Skeletor attempts to torture He-Man into submission, to make his victory complete, but He-Man refuses to yield. The moment arrives for Skeletor to receive the power of the cosmos, and declaring himself the Master of the Universe, Skeletor uses his new powers to attempt to force He-Man to kneel.\n\nBack on Earth, Gwildor repairs the Cosmic Key and Kevin re-creates the tones necessary to create a gateway to Eternia. The group, including Lubic who attempts to arrest them, are transported to Castle Grayskull, where they begin battling Skeletor's forces. Resenting that Skeletor absorbed the power of the Universe without sharing it with her, Evil-Lyn deserts him along with the other henchmen. Skeletor accidentally frees He-Man, who reclaims the Sword of Grayskull, and they battle until He-Man shatters Skeletor's staff, removing his new powers and restoring him to his normal state. He-Man offers mercy, but Skeletor draws a concealed sword and attempts to kill He-Man; He-Man knocks Skeletor into a vast pit below. The freed Sorceress heals Julie and a portal is opened to send the Earthlings home. Hailed as a hero for his bravery, Lubic decides to remain on Eternia.\n\nJulie awakens on the morning of her parents' deaths by plane crash. She prevents them from taking the ill-fated flight by taking their keys, and runs outside to find Kevin. Kevin confirms that their experiences were real, producing a souvenir from Eternia: a small blue sphere containing a scene of He-Man in front of Castle Grayskull with his sword raised above his head.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Skeletor's head emerges from the water at the bottom of the pit, saying \"I'll be back!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Frank Langella Deauville 2012.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Frank Langella]] in 2012.

The original draft included more time spent on Eternia and Snake Mountain, had Beast Man in a speaking role, and even revealed that He-Man's mother was originally from Earth, as per the character [[List of Masters of the Universe characters#Queen Marlena|Queen Marlena]] from the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'', thus linking the two planets.<ref>{{cite news|title= Masters Cast \u2013 Episode 3 |publisher= Masters Cast|url= http://masterscast.com/podcasts/masterscast_ep003.mp3|access-date=2012-07-23}}</ref> Describing her character, Foster said that Evil-Lyn is not villainous, \"she is just doing her job and she knows how to get results, even if it means being harsh.\" Langella agreed, calling Evil-Lyn a female more dedicated to Skeletor's cause than any man; she is obsessive around Skeletor because she is slightly lovelorn.{{Sfn|SFX|2013|p=84}} The filmmakers considered having Foster wear contact lenses to mask her naturally pale-blue eyes, but decided that her natural eyes fit the character better. However, they did augment Foster's chest, fitting cleavage into the character's costume.

A member of staff was forced to put lens caps on cameras during several days to prevent any more filming from taking place. Due to the production running out of budget, Goddard had to finance the filming of the battle scene between He-Man and Skeletor himself. Only Lundgren and Langella were present along with a skeleton crew with the set's lighting made dark to emphasize the actors' presence.\n\nMattel was also initially very controlling over how He-Man was depicted in the film, insisting that the character could not appear doing anything morally wrong (such as swearing or killing). Sales of He-Man toys dipped in the middle of production, after which Goddard noted that Mattel allowed the director to have more liberties with the character.\n\nDuring filming, Mattel held a contest for children for a chance to appear in the film.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.motumovie.com/2010/06/q-with-richard-szponder-pigboy.html | title=Q & A with Richard Szponder (Pigboy)! }}</ref> Richard Szponder won the competition, but his victory was announced as filming was nearing completion. All the scenes taking place on Earth had been shot, so Goddard cast him as the minion character Pigboy who holds Skeletor's staff as he returns to Grayskull. \n\nTwo sound stages needed to be connected to film the interior of Castle Grayskull, with matte paintings filling in the pits of the central walk-way. Goddard initially planned to have Lundgren's dialogue dubbed over by another actor but eventually Ludgren learned his lines well enough that he decided against it.\n\n===Jack Kirby inspiration===\nComic book writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] compared the film to [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[comic book]] [[metaseries]] ''[[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]]'', stating in ''[[Comic Shop News]]'' #497:\n\n{{bquote|The '''best''' [[New Gods]] movie, IMHO, is ''Masters of the Universe''. I even corresponded with the director, who told me this was his intent, and that he had tried to get [Jack] Kirby to do the production designs, but the studio nixed it.\n\nCheck it out. It requires some bending and an occasional sex change ([[Metron (comics)|Metron]] becomes an ugly dwarf, The [[Highfather]] becomes the Sorceress), but it's an amazingly close analog, otherwise. And [[Frank Langella]]'s Skeletor is a '''dandy''' Darkseid!}}\n\nDirector Gary Goddard clarified this in a letter appearing in ''[[John Byrne's Next Men]]'' #26, in which he stated:\n\n{{bquote|As the director of ''Masters of the Universe'', it was a pleasure to see that someone got it. Your comparison of the film to Kirby\u2019s ''[[New Gods]]'' was not far off. In fact, the storyline was greatly inspired by the classic ''[[Fantastic Four]]''/''[[Doctor Doom]]'' epics, ''The New Gods'' and a bit of ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' thrown in here and there. I intended the film to be a \"motion picture comic book,\" though it was a tough proposition to sell to the studio at the time. 'Comics are just for kids,' they thought. They would not allow me to hire Jack Kirby who I desperately wanted to be the conceptual artist for the picture\u2026\n\nI grew up with Kirby's comics (I've still got all my Marvels from the first issue of ''Fantastic Four'' and ''[[Spider-Man]]'' through the time Kirby left) and I had great pleasure meeting him when he first moved to California. Since that time I enjoyed the friendship of Jack and Roz and was lucky enough to spend many hours with Jack, hearing how he created this character and that one, why a villain has to be even more powerful than a hero, and on and on. Jack was a great communicator, and listening to him was always an education. You might be interested to know that I tried to dedicate ''Masters of Universe'' to Jack Kirby in the closing credits, but the studio took the credit out.}}\n\nBrian Cronin, author of the \"Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed\" column, concludes that \"the film itself was not intended to be literally a reworked Fourth World, although the intent WAS to make the film a tribute to Jack Kirby\u2014just a tribute to ALL of his work, not just the Fourth World.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-75/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #75 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2006-11-02|access-date=2020-06-09}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] of ''Masters of the Universe'' was composed by [[Bill Conti]]. It was recorded by several European orchestras, chiefly the Graunke Orchestra of Munich (the only one to be credited on the soundtrack album) and conducted by a number of conductors, chiefly Bruce Miller and [[Harry Rabinowitz]] (Rabinowitz received sole credit). Conti did not conduct his score because it could not be recorded in the United States as \"there was a musicians strike or something like that\u2026So it went to various places.\" He and the score mixer Dan Wallin assembled the score from the various recorded takes, because there were problems with the orchestral performances (\"We didn't have anything that went from beginning to end without a problem\").<ref>\"Bill Conti's Music of the Universe,\" pg. 8, liner notes, ''Masters of the Universe: Complete Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,'' La-La Land Records LLLCD 1071.</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack album was released on record, cassette, and compact disc by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] in 1987; it was subsequently issued in an expanded version by Edel.

Pro surfer [[Laird Hamilton]] was originally to replace Dolph Lundgren as He-Man and the only aspect known about the sequel's screenplay was that He-Man would have returned to Earth disguised as a professional quarterback.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/cyborg/32532/how-a-he-man-sequel-and-a-spider-man-movie-became-cyborg|title=How a He-Man sequel and a Spider-Man movie became Cyborg|publisher=Den of Geek|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|date=July 6, 2016}}</ref> With a low budget of $4.5 million, the sequel was to be directed by [[Albert Pyun]], consecutively with the aborted ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'' movie.
