However, after he brings his family along to support him, they uncover the tragic truth of the facility's location.\n\nThe film was released on July 6, 1990.

It was also the final ''Jetsons'' production for 27 years until the release of ''[[The Jetsons & WWE: Robo-WrestleMania!]]'' in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 21st century, Spacely Sprockets and Spindles has opened a new mining colony on an asteroid. The proposed project is meant to increase productivity at 1/10 the cost of making the items on Earth. However, the factory continues to be sabotaged by someone or something. As Cosmo Spacely ([[Mel Blanc]]) checks up on the \"Orbiting-Ore Asteroid\" again, he learns from the plant engineer Rudy-2 ([[Ronnie Schell]]) that the latest head of the factory Alexander Throttlebottom has run off, making four [[Vice_president#In_business|vice president]]s of the new plant that Spacely has lost so far.\n\nFearing for his company (and profits), Spacely names George Jetson ([[George O'Hanlon]]) as Throttlebottom's successor and sends George and his family to the plant. While the family is thoroughly upset at being thrown from their normal lifestyle (and the plans that they had coming up that week), they set up apartments on the adjoining apartment community to the asteroid and its neighboring shopping complex, while it takes the family time to adjust.\n\nRudy-2 shows George around the plant as they prepare for the grand re-opening of the plant. Meanwhile, Jane ([[Penny Singleton]]) and Rosie ([[Jean Vander Pyl]]) befriend Rudy-2's wife Lucy-2 ([[Patti Deutsch]]). Judy Jetson ([[Tiffany Darwish|Tiffany]]) is having a hard time adjusting, and accepting the fact that she lost her chance at a date with rock star Cosmic Cosmo ([[Steve McClintock]]) which a friend of hers later takes, but soon feels better after meeting a teenaged boy named Apollo Blue ([[Paul Kreppel]]). Elroy Jetson ([[Patric Zimmerman]]) meets Rudy-2's son Teddy-2 ([[Dana Hill]]) with whom he first is at odds, but eventually befriends. George soon figures that he is ready to set the plant running again, and Mr. Spacely is all set to see the plant working full-throttle, and soon to churn out the one millionth Spacely sprocket. However, the opening-day festivities give way to panic as the factory is sabotaged once again. Over the next several days, George and Rudy-2 try to fix things, but the problems persist to the point that, fed up with the problems and thinking George is responsible, Mr. Spacely heads on up to check on things personally. Thinking he has to take charge, George stays overnight hoping to catch the saboteurs in the act, only to fall asleep and be taken off by the mysterious creatures. Elroy, Teddy-2, and their neighbor Fergie Furbelow ([[Russi Taylor]]) sneak into the plant and meet Squeep ([[Frank Welker]]), a member of a furry alien race known as Grungees (Frank Welker).\n\nSqueep tells them (with Teddy-2 translating) that the factory is actually drilling into his people's community, which is based inside the asteroid. Soon, Jane, Judy, Apollo, Rudy-2, and Astro show up and realize what is happening as well. George is found hog-tied in the Grungees' colony, and although he soon realizes just what the factory is doing, Spacely does not. Seeing his factory at a stand-still, he starts it up (despite that it is the night and after disconnecting Rudy-2, who tries to stop him), nearly burying Elroy and Squeep alive under rubble, and prompting everyone in the asteroid to get top-side, where George manages to shut down the factory and show his boss exactly what he is doing. After some talk, when George finally stands up to his boss, telling him that all he cares about is money, they come to an agreement: the Grungees will run the plant, and create new Spacely sprockets through recycling old ones (thus stopping the further destruction of the Grungees' homes inside the asteroid).\n\nSpacely Sprockets reaches the millionth sprocket at long last, and when George asks about being vice president, Spacely retorts, stating, \"he's lucky that he'll be getting his old job back\". Only when pressured by everyone else does he reluctantly promote him to vice president (without a raise). However, George knows that with the Grungees now running the plant, he is no longer needed as head of the asteroid. With heavy hearts, the Jetsons then bid their new friends goodbye, including Fergie, who attempted to stow away aboard the Jetsons' car. They then return home to Earth. As the family passes over the factory, the Grungees arrange themselves to form the words \"THANKS GEORGE\", as a friendly goodbye to him for saving their home.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of The Jetsons characters}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[George O'Hanlon]] as [[George Jetson]]\n* [[Mel Blanc]] as Mr. Cosmo Spacely \n* [[Penny Singleton]] as Jane Jetson\n* [[Tiffany Darwish|Tiffany]] as Judy Jetson<ref>{{cite news|title=For Some Readers, Tiffany Is No Jetson |work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 15, 1990|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-15-me-353-story.html|access-date=2011-04-08}}</ref>\n* [[Patric Zimmerman]] as Elroy Jetson\n* [[Don Messick]] as Astro the Space Mutt\n* [[Jean Vander Pyl]] as Rosie the Robot\n* [[Ronnie Schell]] as Rudy-2\n* [[Patti Deutsch]] as Lucy-2\n* [[Dana Hill]] as Teddy-2\n* [[Paul Kreppel]] as Apollo Blue\n* [[Russi Taylor]] as Fergie Furbelow\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as Bertie Furbelow\n* [[B.
