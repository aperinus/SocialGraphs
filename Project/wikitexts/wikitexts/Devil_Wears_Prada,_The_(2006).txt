The screenplay, written by [[Aline Brosh McKenna]], is based on [[Lauren Weisberger]]'s 2003 [[The Devil Wears Prada (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The [[film adaptation]] stars [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Miranda Priestly]], a powerful [[Fashion journalism|fashion magazine editor]], and [[Anne Hathaway]] as Andrea \"Andy\" Sachs, a college graduate who goes to New York City and lands a job as Priestly's co-assistant. [[Emily Blunt]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] co-star as co-assistant Emily Charlton and art director Nigel Kipling, respectively. [[Adrian Grenier]] and [[Simon Baker]] play key supporting roles.\n\nIn 2003, [[20th Century Fox]] bought the rights to a film adaptation of Weisberger's novel before it was completed for publication; the project was not [[green-light|greenlit]] until Streep was cast in the lead role. [[Principal photography]] lasted 57 days, primarily taking place in New York City from October to December 2005. Additional filming was done in Paris.\n\nAfter premiering at the [[LA Film Festival]] on June 22, 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title='Devil Wears Prada' will open L.A. Film Festival |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-may-31-et-festival31-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |date=31 May 2006}}</ref> the film was theatrically released in the United States on June 30. The film received positive reviews from critics, with Streep's performance being singled out for praise. This earned her many award nominations, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], as well as a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical]]. Hathaway and Blunt also drew favorable reviews and nominations for their performances. The film grossed over $326&nbsp;million worldwide, against its $41 million budget, and was the 12th highest-grossing film worldwide in 2006.\n\nAlthough the film is set in the fashion world, and references well-known establishments and people within that industry,<ref>Aline Brosh McKenna. [https://johnaugust.com/Assets/DEVIL_WEARS_PRADA_Full_Script.pdf The Devil Wears Prada]. Twentieth Century Fox. 2005. p 18.</ref> most designers and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing US ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editor [[Anna Wintour]], who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories to be used in the film, making it one of the most expensively costumed films in history.<ref name=\"NYPost wardrobe story\">{{cite news|last=French|first=Serena|title=The $1 Million Wardrobe|url=https://nypost.com/2006/06/21/the-1-million-wardrobe-of-the-devil-wears-prada/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=June 21, 2006}}</ref> Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.<ref name=\"Barbara Walters\">{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2716887&page=3 |title=The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006 |last=Walters |first=Barbara |date=December 12, 2006 |work=[[ABC News]] |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nAndy Sachs is an aspiring journalist newly graduated from [[Northwestern University]]. Despite her ridicule of the fashion industry, she lands a job as junior personal assistant to [[Miranda Priestly]], the editor-in-chief of ''Runway'' magazine, a job that \"millions of girls would kill for\". Andy plans to put up with Miranda's excessive demands and humiliating treatment for one year in the hopes of getting a job as a reporter or writer somewhere else.\n\nAt first, Andy fumbles with her job and fits in poorly with her gossipy, fashion-forward co-workers, especially Miranda's senior assistant, Emily Charlton. After a dress trial meeting in which Miranda berates her in front of the entire team, she approaches art director Nigel to help her learn the ropes in the world of fashion. She begins to dress stylishly and makes an effort to accommodate all of Miranda's whims and fancies, which creates problems in her relationship with her boyfriend Nate, who is frustrated that she is always at her new boss's beck and call.\n\nMiranda notices Andy's changed appearance and commitment and begins to give her more responsibility and complicated tasks to handle. Slowly but surely, Andy becomes more glamorous and absorbs the ''Runway'' philosophy. She gradually outperforms Emily at her job. Emily, meanwhile, is consumed with the thought of attending [[Paris Fashion Week]] as Miranda's assistant, which motivates her to attempt extreme diets which damage her health. When Emily is feeling too unwell to remember important details about the guests at a charity benefit, Andy steps in to save Miranda from embarrassment and is rewarded by being asked to replace Emily as Miranda's assistant at the Paris Fashion Week. Miranda tells Andy to inform Emily that she will not be going to Paris, but when Andy calls Emily, Emily is hit by a car and ends up in the hospital. Andy then tells the recovering Emily the news and Emily is furious. When Andy tells Nate the news, he is angered that she has become what she once ridiculed and they break up.\n\nIn Paris, Andy learns from Miranda about her impending divorce. Later that night, Nigel tells Andy that he has accepted a job as creative director with rising designer James Holt. Andy spends the night with an attractive young writer, Christian Thompson, who tells her that Miranda is to be replaced by Jacqueline Follet as editor of ''Runway''. Feeling bad for Miranda, Andy attempts to warn her but Miranda sends her away.\n\nAt a luncheon later that day, Miranda announces Jacqueline as the new creative director to Holt, leaving Andy and Nigel stunned. Later in the car, Miranda explains to Andy that she already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. When Andy is repulsed, Miranda points out that Andy did the same with Emily by stepping over her and agreeing to go to Paris. When they arrive at their destination, Andy walks away from Miranda and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the [[Place de la Concorde]] and returns to New York.\n\nSometime later, Andy meets up with Nate and apologizes. Nate tells Andy he has a new job as a [[sous-chef]] in Boston, and they reconcile. The same day, Andy is interviewed and accepted to work at a major New York publication company. The editor recounts how he called ''Runway'' for a reference, and was informed by Miranda that while Andy was one of the biggest disappointments she ever had as an assistant, he would be an idiot not to hire her. Andy then calls Emily and reconciles with her by offering her the dresses she obtained in Paris. While passing the ''Runway'' office building in the afternoon, Andy makes eye contact with Miranda as she gets into a car. Although Andy waves, Miranda does not acknowledge her but smiles to herself once she is seated in the car.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Miranda Priestly]]\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Andrea \"Andy\" Sachs\n* [[Emily Blunt]] as Emily Charlton\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Nigel Kipling\n* [[Simon Baker]] as Christian Thompson\n* [[Adrian Grenier]] as Nate Cooper\n* [[Gisele B\u00fcndchen]] as Serena\n* [[Tracie Thoms]] as Lily\n* [[Rich Sommer]] as Doug\n* [[Daniel Sunjata]] as James Holt\n* [[James Naughton]] as Stephen\n* Colleen Dengel as Caroline Priestly\n* Suzanne Dengel as Cassidy Priestly\n* [[David Marshall Grant]] as Richard Sachs\n* [[Tibor Feldman]] as Irv Ravitz\n* [[Rebecca Mader]] as Jocelyn\n* [[Alyssa Sutherland]] as Clacker\n* [[Ines Rivero]] as Clacker at elevator\n* [[St\u00e9phanie Szostak]] as Jacqueline Follet\n* David Callegati as Massimo\n* Paul Keany as St. Regis Doorman\n\n=== Cameos ===\n* [[Valentino Garavani]]\n* [[Giancarlo Giammetti]]\n* Carlos de Souza\n* [[Bridget Hall]]\n* [[Lauren Weisberger]] as the twins' nanny\n* [[Robert Verdi]] as a fashion journalist in Paris who interviews Miranda\n* [[Heidi Klum]]\n* [[Jen Taylor]] as Lou\n* [[Nigel Barker (photographer)|Nigel Barker]]\n\n== Production ==\n{{blockquote|When we made it I was naive.

He, cinematographer [[Florian Ballhaus]] and costume designer [[Patricia Field]], drew heavily on their experience in making ''[[Sex and the City]]''.\n\nFrankel recalls the whole experience as having high stakes for those involved, since for himself and the others behind the camera it was the biggest project they had yet attempted, with barely adequate resources. \"We knew we were on very thin ice,\" he told ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' for a 2016 article on the film's 10th anniversary. \"It was possible this could be the end of the road for us.\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\">{{cite news|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title='The Devil Wears Prada' Turns 10: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt Tell All|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/features/the-devil-wears-prada-turns-10-meryl-streep-anne-hathaway-and-emily-blunt-tell-all-1201802311/#respond|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 23, 2016|access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWeisberger is widely believed to have based Miranda on [[Anna Wintour]], the powerful editor of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', for whom she herself had once worked as a personal assistant.

Carla Hacken, then the studio's executive vice president, had only seen the first hundred pages of manuscript and an outline for how the rest of the plot was to go. But for her that was enough. \"I thought Miranda Priestly was one of the greatest villains ever,\" she recalled in 2016. \"I remember we aggressively went in and scooped it up.\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\n==== Writing ====\nWork on a screenplay started promptly, before Weisberger had even finished her work. When it became a bestseller upon publication, elements of the plot were incorporated into the screenplay in progress. Most took their inspiration from the 2001 [[Ben Stiller]] film ''[[Zoolander]]'' and primarily satirized the fashion industry. But it was still not ready to film. Elizabeth Gabler, later head of production at Fox, noted that the finished novel did not have a complete narrative. \"Since there wasn't a strong third act in the book,\" she said later, \"we needed to invent that.\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\nIn the meantime, the studio and producer [[Wendy Finerman]] sought a director. Out of many candidates with experience in comedy, [[David Frankel]] was hired despite his limited experience, having only made one feature, ''[[Miami Rhapsody]]'', along with some episodes of ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''. He was unsure about the property, calling it \"undirectable ... a satire rather than a love story\".<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 1\" /> Later, he cited ''[[Unzipped (film)|Unzipped]]'', the 1995 documentary about designer [[Isaac Mizrahi]], as his model for the film's attitude towards fashion: \"[It] revels in some of the silliness of the fashion world, but is also very serious.\"<ref name=\"NY Press interview\">{{cite news|last=Merin|first=Jennifer|title=Jennifer Merin interviews David Frankel re 'The Devil Wears Prada'|url=http://awfj.org/blog/2006/12/13/jennifer-merin-interviews-david-frankel-re-the-devil-wears-prada/|newspaper=[[New York Press]]|via=[[Alliance of Women Film Journalists]]|date=December 13, 2006|access-date=July 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt a meeting with Finerman, Frankel told her that he thought the story unnecessarily punished Miranda. \"My view was that we should be grateful for excellence. Why do the excellent people have to be nice?\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" /> He prepared to move on and consider more scripts. Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and look for something he liked that he could shape the film into. He took the job, giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film.<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 1\" />\n\nFour [[screenwriter]]s worked on the property. [[Peter Hedges]] wrote the first draft, but did not think he could do more; another writer passed. [[Paul Rudnick]] did some work on Miranda's scenes, followed by a [[Don Roos]] rewrite.<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/devil-wears-prada-10-year-meryl-streep-oral-history-anne-hathaway-emily-blunt-1201701683/ |title='The Devil Wears Prada' At 10: Meryl Streep and More on How Their Risky Project Became a Massive Hit |last=Thompson |first=Anne |date=July 1, 2016 |website=[[IndieWire]] |page=1 |access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref> After that, [[Aline Brosh McKenna]], who was able to relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story,<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 1\" /><ref name=\"McKenna WGA interview\">{{cite web|last=Callaghan|first=Dylan|title=Clothes Encounters|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage.aspx?id=2064|publisher=[[Writers Guild of America]], West|date=2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527190713/http://www.wga.org/subpage.aspx?id=2064|archive-date=May 27, 2008|access-date=July 13, 2016}}</ref> produced a draft after a month's work that struck the right balance for Finerman and Frankel, whose notes were incorporated into a final version,<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" /> rearranging the plot significantly, following the book less closely<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" /> and focusing the story on the conflict between Andy and Miranda.<ref name=\"Trip to the Big Screen\">{{cite video | people = Finerman, Wendy | title=\"Trip to the Big Screen\" on The Devil Wears Prada | medium = DVD | publisher = [[20th Century Fox]] | location = USA  | date = 2006 }}</ref> She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship \"very liberating ...

It slowly grew from a few lines where the editor disparaged her assistant's fashion sense to a speech about \"why she thought fashion was important ... She is so aware that she is affecting billions of people, and what they pick off the floor and what they are putting on their bodies in the morning.\"<ref name=\"Vanity Fair McKenna anniversary piece\" /> Streep said in 2016 she was interested in \"the responsibility lying on the shoulders of a woman who was the head of a global brand ...

Carla Hacken recalled she was seen as so perfect for the part that no one had discussed any alternatives (although McKenna recalls writing provisional dialogue should the producers have had to settle for another actress).<ref name=\"NY Post cerulean story\" /> Weisberger, who initially could not imagine Streep playing the part, recalled that after seeing her on set it was \"crystal clear\" that she was perfect for the role.<ref name=\"Weisberger anniversary piece\">{{cite news|last=Young|first=Sage|title=What Meryl Streep Was Like On 'The Devil Wears Prada' Set, According To Author Lauren Weisberger|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/169842-what-meryl-streep-was-like-on-the-devil-wears-prada-set-according-to-author-lauren-weisberger|newspaper=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]|date=June 30, 2016|access-date=July 7, 2016}}</ref> Her casting helped offset some of the difficulties Wintour's resistance to the film had created.<ref name=\"2021 EW story\" />\n\nThe news that Streep would meet with Frankel was celebrated at Fox. But while Streep, for her part, knew the film could be very successful, she felt the pay she was being offered for playing Miranda was \"slightly, if not insulting, not perhaps reflective of my actual value to the project\". The producers doubled it to around $4&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 2\" /> and she signed on, allowing Fox to [[greenlight]] the film.<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" /> According to Frankel, Streep saw the film as a chance to \"skewer the doyennes of the fashion world\". She has three daughters and, as an ardent [[Feminism|feminist]], felt that fashion magazines \"twisted the minds of young women around the world and their priorities. This was an interesting way to get back at them.\" Also, she said, the film passed the [[Bechdel test]].<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 2\" />\n\nShe insisted on the cerulean sweater speech,<ref name=\"NY Post cerulean story\" /> and the scene where Miranda briefly opens up to Andy, without makeup, about her divorce. \"I wanted\", she explained, \"to see that face without its protective glaze, to glimpse the woman in the businesswoman.\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\nCasting Andy was more difficult. Fox wanted a young [[A-list]] actress, and felt [[Rachel McAdams]], then coming off successes in ''[[Mean Girls]]'' and ''[[The Notebook]]'', would help the film's commercial prospects. McAdams turned down several offers to play Andy, telling the studio she was trying to avoid mainstream Hollywood projects for a while.<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" /> [[Claire Danes]] and [[Juliette Lewis]] were among seven other actresses also considered.<ref name=\"2021 People story\">{{cite magazine|last=Ushe|first=Naledi|title=Anne Hathaway Says She Was the Ninth Choice for Devil Wears Prada Role: 'Never Give Up'|url=https://people.com/movies/anne-hathaway-ninth-choice-devil-wears-prada-role/|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=February 19, 2021|access-date=February 21, 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Anne Hathaway]], by contrast, actively sought the part, tracing \"Hire me\" in the sand of the [[Japanese rock garden|zen garden]] on Hacken's desk when she talked about the project with the executive.

While the studio did not use those notes, \"her sensibilities were completely aligned with what we ended up doing.\"<ref name=\"2021 EW story\" /> Hathaway took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects.<ref name=\"Ledger07\">Whitty, Stephen; July 29, 2007; \"Growing up in public\"; ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', Section 4, page 2. \"I wanted to illustrate how dangerous it was to not make your own choices ...

The co-op boards at many apartment buildings also refused to let the production use them for Miranda's, which Frankel also believes was because of Wintour's influence.<ref name=\"2021 EW story\" />\n\nBallhaus, at Finerman and Frankel's suggestion, composed as many shots as possible, whether interiors or exteriors, to at least partially take in busy New York street scenes in the background, to convey the excitement of working in a glamorous industry in New York. He also used a handheld [[movie camera|camera]] during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda's office, to better convey the flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover. A few [[process shot]]s were necessary, mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andy are having their climactic conversation.<ref name=\"DVD commentary Frankel\" />\n\nFox originally refused permission to let Frankel shoot some scenes from the third act in [[Paris]], where it is set, due to the low budget. After six \"nightmarish\"<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 2\" /> weeks of shooting, he had an editor cut a \"[[trailer (promotion)|sizzle reel]]\" of highlights. That convinced the studio to increase the budget to allow for limited shooting overseas.<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 2\" /> Streep did not go as Fox believed it would be too expensive; green screen shots and her body double were used instead.<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" /><ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 2\" />\n\n==== Acting ====\nSeveral weeks after all the major parts had been cast, the actors gathered in New York for a [[Read-through|table read]]. Hathaway was nervous and goofy, she recalls, since she still had not developed her idea of the part; she described her performance at that point as \"[nothing] particularly impressive\". Blunt, by contrast, found Streep's laugh relaxed her enough to keep her focused on playing a nervous, distracted Emily. The highlight of the session was Streep's first line as Miranda. Instead of the \"strident, bossy, barking voice\" everyone expected, Hathaway says, Streep silenced the room by speaking in a near whisper. \"It was so unexpected and brilliant.\" At the reading Streep also changed Miranda's last line to \"everybody wants to be ''us''\" from the original \"me\".<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\nStreep made a conscious decision not to play the part as a direct impression of Wintour,<ref name=\"Who interview\">{{cite magazine|last=Streep|first=Meryl|subject-link=Meryl Streep|title=Exclusive Interview: Meryl Streep|url=http://www.who.com/who/magazine/article/0%2C19636%2C7401070219-1583696%2C00.html|publisher=[[Pacific Magazines]]|date=January 31, 2007|magazine=[[Who (magazine)|Who]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830012928/http://www.who.com/who/magazine/article/0%2C19636%2C7401070219-1583696%2C00.html|archive-date=August 30, 2007|access-date=April 30, 2017|quote=I wanted the freedom to make this person up}}</ref> right down to not using an accent and making the character American rather than English (\"I felt it was too restricting\").<ref name=\"Hugh Davies in Telegraph\" /> \"I think she wanted people not to confuse the character of Miranda Priestly with Anna Wintour at all,\" said Frankel. \"And that's why early on in the process she decided on a very different look for her and a different approach to the character.\"<ref name=\"Hollywood Reporter\" /> The \"that's all,\"{{sfn|Weisberger|2003|p=80}} \"please bore someone else {{nbsp}}...\"{{sfn|Weisberger|2003|p=204}} [[catchphrase]]s; her coat-tossing on Andrea's desk{{sfn|Weisberger|2003|p=201}} and discarded [[steak]] lunch{{sfn|Weisberger|2003|p=150\u201351}} are retained from the novel.

She lost so much weight during shooting that the clothes had to be taken in.<ref name=\"Who interview\" />\n\nDuring the movie's press tour she also said her performance as Miranda was inspired by different men she knew, but did not say which ones. In 2016 she disclosed to ''Variety'' that she took Miranda's soft speaking style from [[Clint Eastwood]]: \"He never, ever, ever raises his voice and everyone has to lean in to listen, and he is automatically the most powerful person in the room.\" However, she said, Eastwood does not make jokes, so instead she modeled that aspect of the character on theatrical and film director [[Mike Nichols]], whose delivery of a cutting remark, she said, made everyone laugh, including the target. \"The walk, I'm afraid, is mine,\" Streep added.<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n{{Multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| total_width = 300\n<!-- Layout parameters -->| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| background color = \n| caption_align = center\n| image_gap = 5\n| header_align = center\n| header = Inspirations for Miranda's hair\n| image1 = Carmen Dell'Orefice September 2012 (cropped).jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]]\n| image2 = Lagarde.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Christine Lagarde]]\n}}\nFor Miranda's actual look, Streep looked to two women.

Accordingly, he cut a number of primarily transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the ''Runway'' staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he had not even seen them before, since Livolsi did not include them in any prints he sent to the director.<ref name=\"DVD commentary on deleted scenes\" />\n\nFrankel praised Livolsi for making the film's four key [[Montage (film)|montages]]\u2014the opening credits, Miranda's coat-tossing, Andrea's makeover and the Paris introduction\u2014work. The third was particularly challenging as it uses passing cars and other obstructions to cover Hathaway's changes of outfit. Some scenes were also created in the editing room, such as the reception at the museum, where Livolsi wove [[B-roll]] footage in to keep the action flowing.<ref name=\"DVD commentary Frankel\" />\n\nIn 2021 McKenna estimated that she had signed off on $10 million in cut scenes. An opening scene in which Andy goes to the wrong building on her way to her interview was taken out to get the story started more quickly. The scene where she misses Nate's birthday was originally more elaborate, with the couple supposed to meet up with their friends at a concert, but that proved to be too expensive, and so the scene with the cupcake was written instead. \"We had many versions of that.\" And an alternate ending for the couple's arc, where they have the same conversation about the future of their relationship while running through the park, was filmed but replaced with the less optimistic scene in the restaurant.<ref name=\"2021 EW story\" />\n\nMcKenna had also been willing to cut Miranda's \"Florals... for spring.

It moved the release date from February to summer, scheduling it as a lighter alternative audiences could consider to ''[[Superman Returns]]'' at the end of June 2006, and began to position it as an event movie in and of itself.<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\nTwo decisions by the studio's marketing department that were meant to be preliminary wound up being integral to promoting the film. The first was the creation of the red [[stiletto heel]] ending in a [[pitchfork]] as the film's teaser [[movie poster|poster]]. It was so successful and effective, becoming almost \"iconic\" (in Finerman's words), that it was used for the actual release poster as well. It became a brand, and was eventually used on every medium related to the film\u2014the tie-in reprinting of the novel and the [[soundtrack album|soundtrack]] and DVD covers as well.<ref name=\"Hollywood Reporter\" />\n\nThe studio also put together a [[trailer (film)|trailer]] of scenes and images strictly from the first three minutes of the film, in which Andy meets Miranda for the first time, to be used at previews and [[film festival]]s until they could create a more standard trailer drawing from the whole film. But, again, this proved so effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer, since it created anticipation for the rest of the film without giving anything away.<ref name=\"Hollywood Reporter\" />\n\nGabler credits the studio's marketing team for being \"really creative\". Fox saw the film as \"counter-programming\" on the weekend ''[[Superman Returns]]'' was released. While they knew that the material and Hathaway would help draw a younger female audience that would not be as interested in seeing that film, \"[w]e didn't want it to just seem like a [[chick flick]] coming out.\"<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 3\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:The devil wears Prada mod.jpg|thumb|The stars of ''The Devil Wears Prada'' at the Venice premiere, front row: (left to right) [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Stanley Tucci]], Lisa Tucci and [[Meryl Streep]].

Their responses varied widely. Booth Moore at ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' chided Field for creating a \"fine fashion fantasy with little to do with reality,\" a world that reflects what outsiders think fashion is like rather than what the industry actually is.

{{nom}}\n|}\n\n== In other media ==\nThe success of the film led to a proposed, but unrealized, American [[dramedy]] series that was in contention to air for the 2007\u201308 television season on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It was to be produced by [[Fox Television Studios]], with the premise adjusted for the confines of a traditional half-hour or one-hour [[dramedy]] with a [[single camera]] set-up. However, it never reached the point of even producing a [[Television pilot|pilot episode]].<ref name=\"TV series proposal\">{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=upsell_article&articleID=VR1117951748&categoryID=14&cs=1 |title=(October 11, 2006); subscrpition req |work=Variety |date=October 11, 2006|access-date=July 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the video release came renewed interest in Weisberger's novel.

It was released in the UK on February 5, 2007.\n\nA [[Blu-ray Disc]] of the film was released simultaneously with the DVD. The Blu-ray maintains the same features as the DVD; however, the featurettes were dropped and replaced with a [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]] pop-up trivia track that can be watched by itself or along with the audio commentary.<ref name=\"Blu-Ray review\">{{cite web |url=https://bluray.highdefdigest.com/475/devilwearsprada.html |title=The Devil Wears Prada Blu-ray Review |last=Bracke |first=Peter |date=December 11, 2006 |website=Highdef Digest |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Reception ===\nImmediately upon its December 12 release, it became the top rental in the United States. It held that spot through the end of the year, adding another $26.5&nbsp;million to the film's grosses; it dropped out of the top 50 at the end of March, with its grosses almost doubling.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo DVD rentals\">{{cite web|title=The Devil Wears Prada (2006) \u2013 DVD/Home Video rentals|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&id=devilwearsprada.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=July 13, 2016}}</ref> The following week it made its debut on the DVD sales charts in third position.

Most were deleted by Livolsi in favor of keeping the plot focused on the conflict between Miranda and Andrea, often without consulting Frankel.<ref name=\"DVD commentary on deleted scenes\" />\n\nFrankel generally approved of his editor's choices, but differed on one scene, showing more of Andy on her errand to the [[Calvin Klein]] showroom. He felt that scene showed Andrea's job was about more than running personal errands for Miranda.<ref name=\"DVD commentary on deleted scenes\" />\n\nA different version of the scene at the gala was the subject of a 2017 discussion on [[Twitter]] when it was rediscovered by Spencer Althouse, ''[[BuzzFeed]]''{{'}}s community manager. In it, instead of Andy reminding Miranda of a guest's name after the sickened Emily cannot, Miranda's husband shows up and makes rude comments to not only his wife but Ravitz, the head of Elias-Clark. Andy earns a silent \"thank you\" from Miranda when she helps prevent the confrontation from escalating by diverting Ravitz with a question of her own.<ref name=\"2017 Glamour deleted scene article\">{{cite news|last=Weiner|first=Zoe|title=This 'Devil Wears Prada' Deleted Scene Tells a Completely Different Story|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/devil-wears-prada-deleted-scene|newspaper=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]|date=August 30, 2017|access-date=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthouse and many of the other participants on the thread disagreed as to whether it should have been used; those who said it was properly cut believed that it would have been out of character for Miranda at that point in the film. All agreed, as ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' wrote, that \"[t]his one, brief exchange would have completely changed the movie.\"<ref name=\"2017 Glamour deleted scene article\" />\n\n== Cultural impact and legacy ==\n\nIn 2016, around the 10th anniversary of the film's release, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' did a rundown of some [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend movie box results from the previous 15 years, noting how some better-remembered films had been bested by films that have not stood the test of time. It called ''[[Superman Returns]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> win over ''The Devil Wears Prada'' the \"most ironic\" of these victories. \"[T]he degree to which ''The Devil Wears Prada'' has penetrated pop culture needs no explanation\u2013as does the degree to which ''Superman Returns'' didn't.\"<ref name=\"VF Independence Day weekends\">{{cite news|last=Bradley|first=Laura|title=Independence Day Weekend Is for Blockbusters, Except When It Isn't|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/07/july-4-weekend-box-office-flops-and-surprises|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=July 1, 2016|access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe cast's opinions on why the movie has endured differ. Hathaway told ''Variety'' that she thinks many people relate to Andy's predicament of working for someone who seems impossible to please. \"Everybody has had an experience like this.\" Tucci did not believe specific explanations were necessary. \"It's a fucking brilliant movie ... The brilliant movies become influential, no matter what they are about.\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\n=== Cast ===\n\nThe cast members bonded tightly on the set, and remained close afterwards. Blunt invited them to her wedding to [[John Krasinski]] in 2010. There, Tucci met her sister Felicity, whom he later married. \"Ten years after ''The Devil Wears Prada'', Stanley is in my actual family,\" she told ''Variety''. \"How frightening is that?\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\nIn its anniversary story, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' argued that it had benefited all three of its lead actresses. In addition to Streep's record-setting Oscar nomination, the magazine observed, it had proven that she could be a box-office draw by herself, opening doors up for her to be cast as a lead in later summer movies such as ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' (2008) and ''[[Julie & Julia]]'' (2009). For Hathaway, it was her first leading role in a film intended for an adult audience. Subsequent producers were impressed that she had held her own playing opposite Streep, which led eventually to her being cast in more serious roles like ''[[Rachel Getting Married]]'' (2008) and ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012 film)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' (2012), for which she won an Oscar. \"I think what people saw was promising\u2014it made people want to see more.\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\nHathaway believes that Blunt's career took off because of her role. \"I've never witnessed a star being born before,\" Hathaway says. \"That's the first time I watched it happen.\" Blunt agrees that it was \"a night and day change\" for her\u2014the day after the film was released, she told ''Variety'', the staff at the coffee shop she had been going to for breakfast every morning in Los Angeles suddenly recognized her. Even ten years later, people still quote her lines from the film back to her at least once a week, she says.<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\n=== Audience demographics ===\n\n\"[The film] definitely paved the way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was really strong out there\", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as ''Mamma Mia!'', ''[[27 Dresses]]'' (2008) (written by McKenna) and ''[[Me Before You (film)|Me Before You]]'' (2016), that appeared to her to be trying to replicate ''The Devil Wears Prada''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. \"''Prada'' reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now\u2014it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film.\"<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 3\" />\n\nFor Streep, the most significant thing about the film was that \"[t]his was the first time, on any movie I have ever made, where men came up to me and said, 'I know what you felt like, this is kind of like my life.' That was for me the most ground-breaking thing about ''Devil Wears Prada''\u2014it engaged men on a visceral level,\" she told ''[[Indiewire]]''.<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 3\" />\n\n=== Popular culture and society ===\n\nThe film has made a lasting impact on [[popular culture]].

Like them, she observes, Miranda competently assumes a position of authority often held by male characters, despite her moral failings, that she must defend against attempts to use her personal life to remove her from it, to \"prov[e], as a creature of sentiment, that she never belonged there in the first place.\" In doing so, however successfully to herself and others, \"she has zipped herself into a life as regimented and limited as a skintight [[pencil skirt]].\"<ref name=\"Washington Post antiheroines\">{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|title=How 'The Devil Wears Prada' foreshadowed an age of antiheroines|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/06/30/how-the-devil-wears-prada-foreshadowed-an-age-of-antiheroines/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 30, 2016|access-date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFive years later, ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', took a different perspective. Mekia Rivas faulted the film's portrayal of Miranda and Andy's relationship as reinforcing a false belief that since a young woman may only get one career break, she should take it no matter what she has to put up with from her boss. At the time of the film's release, \"[[Girlboss (term)|girlbosses]]\" epitomized by Miranda had been seen as potentially revolutionizing the workplace, she noted. But the idea had since been discredited by real-life examples of women like [[Elizabeth Holmes]] and [[Away (company)#Toxic workplace allegations|Steph Korey]] who ran companies where workers lived in fear of their bosses' tempers and whims. Rivas described Miranda as \"a totally toxic superior who, in the end, was more interested in upholding the status quo than in reinventing it, despite having all the power and authority to do so. She wanted Andy to believe that saying no to her would be the end of her career, even though she knew Andy had all the potential in the world to make it without her or her connections.\"<ref name=\"Harper's Bazaar piece\">{{cite magazine|last=Rivas|first=Mekita|title=''The Devil Wears Prada'' and the Myth of the One and Only 'Big Break'|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a36893136/the-devil-wears-prada-anniversary-big-break-myth/|magazine=[[Harper's Bazaar]]|date=July 1, 2021|access-date=July 14, 2021}}</ref>\n\n\"Like many instant classics, ''Prada'' benefited from perfect timing\", ''Variety''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2016 article observed, attempting to explain the film's enduring appeal. \"It marked the beginning of the democratization of the fashion industry\u2014when the masses started to pay attention to the business of what they wore.\" It credited the movie with helping stir interest in the American adaptation of the Colombian television series ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', which debuted months after its release.<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\nThe film also has been credited with increasing interest in [[R.J. Cutler]]'s [[documentary]] ''[[The September Issue]]'', which followed [[Anna Wintour|Wintour]] and other ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' editors as they prepared the issue for that month of 2007.<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" /> Writing in ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' on the tenth anniversary, Alison Herman observed that \"''The Devil Wears Prada'' transformed Wintour's image from that of a mere public figure into that of a cultural icon.\" Once known primarily as a fashion editor, she was now \"every overlord you'd ever bitched about three drinks deep at [[happy hour]], only to dutifully fetch her coffee the next day.\" Ultimately, the film had effected a positive change in Wintour's image, Herman argued, \"from a tyrant in [[chinchilla]] to an idol for the post-[[Sheryl Sandberg|Sandberg]] age\".<ref name=\"Ringer 2016 article\" />\n\nAs the film turned 10, ''Variety''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 2016 article stated, '[The characterization] showed Hollywood that it was never wise to underestimate a strong woman's worth.'<ref>{{cite news|title='The Devil Wears Prada' Turns 10: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt Tell All|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/features/the-devil-wears-prada-turns-10-meryl-streep-anne-hathaway-and-emily-blunt-tell-all-1201802311/#respond|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Antipathy to Nate ====\n\nMiranda has not been the only character in the film to provoke a negative reaction from viewers over time; Nate has been called the film's \"real villain\" by some.<ref name=\"2021 EW story\" /> \"He mocks her for her new interest in fashion, he trivializes the magazine she works at, and dismisses her hard work\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote in 2017, collecting some tweets and other posts from social media critical of the character. Many, like the writer of that piece, found it particularly upsetting that he berated Andy for missing his birthday party even though she had a good work-related reason for her absence.<ref name=\"EW McKenna story\" />\n\nMcKenna defended the character. \"[W]hat people focus on is that he's trying to restrict her ambition,\" she told ''EW''. \"But her ambition is going towards something that she doesn't really believe in, so he has a point.\" While she admitted he seemed \"whiney\" about his birthday, McKenna also pointed out that he tells Andy later that that really was not what he was upset about. She gave Grenier credit for what she admitted was a \"thankless\" role, saying he captured \"that actual college boyfriend, that guy who's a drummer in a cool band, and plays intramural rugby, and plays guitar, and maybe took a ceramics class\".<ref name=\"EW McKenna story\" />\n[[File:Adrian Grenier by David Shankbone cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Grenier (shown in 2007) has come to terms with the negative reaction his character has gotten|237x237px]]\nOn the film's 15th anniversary, Grenier weighed in. \"When that whole thing ... first came out, I couldn't get my head around it.\" He ultimately came to realize that he had more in the common with the character at the time and, like Nate, had not completely matured. \"[Now], after taking time to reflect and much deliberation online, I can realize the truth in that perspective ...

However, it does not seem likely that a film version of it, or any sequel, will be made, as two of the film's stars are not eager to do so. Streep has reportedly said that she is not interested in making a sequel for this film in particular. And while Hathaway admits she'd be interested in working with the same people, it would have to be \"something totally different\". ''The Devil Wears Prada'', she told ''Variety'' \"might have just hit the right note. It's good to leave it as it is.\"<ref name=\"2016 Variety anniversary story\" />\n\nEight years later, Frankel said that while the studio did not ask them to consider a sequel, a meeting was held to discuss possible ideas. As they felt the movie's story had been told, and there were no good ideas, the idea was dropped. Weisberger said it was \"[not] out of the realm of possibility\" and discussions have been held since then, but McKenna notes that the technology involved in producing print magazines has changed considerably since 2006, such that it would no longer be necessary for an assistant in Andrea's position to bring a physical copy of the magazine in progress to the editor's residence. \"It had its moment!\" the screenwriter said.<ref name=\"2021 EW story\" />\n\n== Musical adaptation ==\n{{main|The Devil Wears Prada (musical)}}\nIn 2015, it was reported that [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Theatrical producer|producer]] [[Kevin McCollum]] had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the films from its back catalog into [[Musical theatre|musicals]] for the stage.

Early in 2017, McCollum announced that in partnership with Fox Stage Productions, he was developing a musical version of ''The Devil Wears Prada'' (based on both the film and the book). [[Elton John|Sir Elton John]] and [[Shaina Taub]] will be writing the score and lyrics for the project with playwright [[Paul Rudnick]], who had written some early scenes for the screenplay,<ref name=\"Indiewire anniversary piece 1\" /> writing the [[book (musical theatre)|book]] and lyrics.
