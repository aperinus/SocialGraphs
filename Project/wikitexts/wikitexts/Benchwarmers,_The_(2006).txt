It tells the story of three nerds and a billionaire forming the titular baseball team to take on the little league baseball teams. The film has developed a [[cult following]] over the years since its release, especially amongst baseball fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nA [[direct-to-video]] sequel titled ''Benchwarmers 2: Breaking Balls'' was released in January 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nGus Matthews, Richie Goodman, and Clark Reedy are adult \"nerds\" who spent their childhoods longing to play baseball, but never got the chance.\n\nWhen a nerdy, unathletic boy named Nelson Carmichael and his friends are bullied and kicked off a baseball diamond by a local [[little league]] team, Gus and Clark chase the bullies away. When Gus and Clark go with Richie to the field, the bullies return and demand that they leave. Gus challenges the bullies to play them for the field. They win the game due to Gus' surprising aptitude. A man named Brad, one of Clark and Richie's childhood bullies, challenges them to another game, but the three friends win again.\n\nAfter an encounter with Richie and Clark's childhood bully Jerry, they and Gus are approached by Nelson's billionaire father Mel who tells the trio about his plan to hold a round-robin with all the little league teams in the state, plus their team. The winners will be given access to a new multimillion-dollar baseball park. The three name themselves the Benchwarmers and join the tournament. Mel and his robot Number 7 cover up Gus' involvement with his wife Liz.\n\nJerry and the coaches of the little league teams start meeting to think of plans to defeat the Benchwarmers. The Benchwarmers win every single game, with Clark and Richie's abilities gradually improving, Richie's brother Howie facing his fears, and the team becomes popular among many nerds, children with poor athletic abilities, and the general public.\n\nAt the semi-final game, the competing team's coach Wayne enters a 30-year-old Dominican professional baseball player named Carlos into the league claiming going with Jerry's claim that he is 12 years old. The Benchwarmers eventually defeat Carlos by getting him too drunk to pitch properly.\n\nAfter multiple unsuccessful attempts to derail the trio, the Benchwarmers' adversaries finally find a weakness that they can exploit. Brad finds evidence that Gus was a bully himself as a child from his poker buddy Steven, known for using name calling over physical force and had bullied one boy named Marcus so intensely that he had to be sent to a [[mental institution]]. Seizing this opportunity, Jerry and Steven expose Gus' secret to the public, shaming Gus into resigning from the team. After a talk with Liz, Gus sincerely apologizes to Marcus just before the final game.\n\nMel enlists ''Ultimate Home Remodel'' to build his stadium. On the day of the big game against Jerry's baseball team, Marcus forgives Gus in front of everyone at the beginning of the final game. Gus re-joins the team, announcing that Marcus is the Benchwarmers' new third-base coach.\n\nIn the final game, Gus, Clark, and Richie let a team consisting of Nelson and other non-athletic children play, to give them a chance to play. In the final inning, the Benchwarmers are losing, but Jerry's team sees that the Benchwarmers are having fun playing the game anyway. Seeing how abusive and uncaring Jerry is and realizing the true spirit of the game, they decide to let Nelson score a run, saying that Jerry is \"the loser\". The Benchwarmers storm the field, celebrating the fact that they were not shut out.\n\nThe entire Benchwarmers team, along with the kids from Jerry's team, Marcus, and even Carlos and Wayne, celebrate at [[Pizza Hut]]. Richie and Clark get girlfriends, Howie informs Wayne that he's not a big fan of the Moon, and Gus announces that he is going to become a father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as Gus Matthews, a nerd and reformed childhood bully who works as a groundskeeper.\n* [[David Spade]] as Richie Goodman, a nerd and video rental store worker.\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Clark Reedy, a nerd and paperboy.\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Mel Carmichael, a billionaire who funds the Benchwarmers.\n* [[Craig Kilborn]] as Jerry McDowell, a mean-spirited little league coach that picked on Richie and Clark.\n* [[Molly Sims]] as Liz Matthews, the wife of Gus.\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as Wayne, a little league coach who is one of Jerry's friends.\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Howie Goodman, Richie's [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] and [[Heliophobia|heliophobic]] brother.\n* [[Erinn Bartlett]] as Sarah, the Pizza and Salad Girl\n* [[Amaury Nolasco]] as Carlos, a Dominican man whoM Wayne recruits to his little league team.\n* [[Bill Romanowski]] as Karl, a little league coach who is one of Jerry's friends.\n* [[Reggie Jackson]] as himself\n* [[Sean Salisbury]] as Brad, a little league coach who picks on Richie and Clark.\n* [[Patrick Schwarzenegger]] as Jock Kid Game #3<ref>Cindy Adams, [https://pagesix.com/2018/03/26/patrick-schwarzenegger-acting-is-how-i-bonded-with-arnold/ Patrick Schwarzenegger: Acting is how I bonded with Arnold], ''Pagesix.com'', 26 March 2018</ref>\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Steven\n* [[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]] as O'Malley\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Number 7, Mel's robot servant.\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as a [[Darth Vader]] Gatekeeper System that is positioned outside of Mel's house.\n* [[William Daniels]] as [[KITT]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n''The Benchwarmers'' was shot at various locations in [[California]], mostly in [[Agoura Hills]], in Chumash Park and at a [[Pizza Hut]].
