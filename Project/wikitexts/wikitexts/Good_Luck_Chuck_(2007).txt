In the film, women find their \"one true love\" after [[having sex]] with a dentist named Chuck (Cook).  Chuck meets a girl named Cam (Alba) and tries to become her true love. The film opened in theaters on September 21, 2007, and was panned by [[film critics|critics]]. One of ''Good Luck Chuck''{{'}}s theatrical posters parodied the well-known ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover photographed by [[Annie Leibovitz]] featuring [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] in similar poses.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile playing [[spin the bottle]] / [[seven minutes in heaven]] at a party in 1985, 10-year-old Charlie \"Chuck\" Logan refuses the sexual advances of a [[Goth subculture|goth]] girl named Anisha Carpenter. In retaliation, Anisha places a [[curse|hex]] on Chuck, saying that once a girl has been with him, \"to the next she will be true\".\n\nIn the present, Chuck is a successful [[dentist]], running a practice in the office opposite his best friend Stu's plastic surgery business. While being sexually intimate with his girlfriend Carol, Chuck cannot reply that he loves her too, prompting her to immediately break up with him. Stu and Chuck attend the wedding of one of Chuck's ex-girlfriends, Katie. During the reception, Katie toasts Chuck for being her lucky charm, which gains the interest of his female tablemates. Chuck becomes enamored with Cam Wexler, an unusually clumsy, yet attractive and friendly penguin scientist working at a [[marine mammal park]].\n\nThe next day, Chuck's office is full of women. He asks Stu if anything's different about him; they also find that Carol is engaged thanks to Chuck being a lucky charm. His date that evening wants to have sex with him because of the charm, but he gets an emergency call from Cam, who chipped her tooth in a work accident at the penguin exhibit. He fixes her tooth, but instead of accepting monetary payment, he asks her out for dinner, but Cam declines as she is not emotionally ready. He returns home to find his receptionist Reba coming onto him hoping he will be her lucky charm.\n\nStu encourages Chuck to indulge in more \"guilt-free sex\", and Chuck does so. However, he still has feelings for Cam, and asks her out. Chuck and Cam's relationship deepens, but when Stu calls Chuck and tells him that every single woman Chuck had slept with has gotten married, Chuck gets cold feet and leaves.\n\nStu and Chuck test the curse on an ugly, obese woman named Eleanor. Meanwhile, Chuck pretends to be sick and maintains a distance relationship with Cam by phone and by computer video. Observing that Eleanor has not seen anyone, Chuck makes Stu ask her out. After Stu confirms he did that and that Eleanor hasn't fallen for him, Chuck rushes to Cam's place and they have sex. The next morning, when Chuck sees Eleanor on TV happily kissing another man, he angrily calls Stu, who admits he only pretended to ask her out. Worried that Cam will now find her true love, Chuck smothers her in increasingly annoying ways, until Cam eventually dumps him. While talking with Reba, Chuck sees a bottle spinning on the ground; he and Stu locate Anisha's home. Chuck asks Anisha to dismiss the curse, but Anisha reveals to Chuck that the curse was not truly real, and that her love back then was just a childhood crush. She encourages him to let go of the girl he is interested in, if he truly loves her.\n\nChuck arranges for Cam to meet Howard Blaine, the penguin expert author that Cam admires. Later, Stu and his new [[Accessory breast|three-breasted]] fianc\u00e9e Lara tell Chuck that Cam is heading to [[Antarctica]] with Howard. Chuck catches her on the plane and pleads her not to go, but Cam explains that she will be back on Wednesday and she is going with both Howard and his wife. He leaves her with a ring box with a pebble, a reference to a previous discussion about what a penguin would do to court a lifetime mate. Cam calls back for Chuck and they kiss. Meanwhile, Anisha pulls out her old childhood [[occult]] [[keepsake box]], and removes a pin from a [[voodoo doll]] of Chuck. A year later, Chuck and Cam are in Antarctica together looking at the [[southern lights]] while surrounded by penguins.\n\nDuring the closing credits, the [[housesitting]] Stu and Lara find a [[sex tape]] involving Chuck, Cam, and a stuffed penguin.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- closing title cards for primary bullets -->\n* [[Dane Cook]] as Dr. Charlie Logan\n** [[Connor Price]] as Young Charlie\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Cam Wexler\n* [[Dan Fogler]] as Dr. Stuart Klaminsky\n** [[Troy Gentile]] as Young Stu\n* [[Ellia English]] as Reba\n* [[Sasha Pieterse]] as Young Anisha Carpenter (credited as Goth Girl)\n** [[Michelle Harrison (actress)|Michelle Harrison]] as Anisha Carpenter\n* [[Lonny Ross]] as Joe Wexler, Cam's stoner brother who works with her at the marine mammal park\n* [[Chelan Simmons]] as Carol\n<!-- end closing title cards -->\n<!-- listed in detailed cast in closing credits, but not all actors/roles\n* [[Annie Wood]] as Lara\n* Jodie Stewart as Eleanor Skepple\n* [[Jodelle Ferland|Jodelle Micah Ferland]] as Lila Carpenter\n* Lindsay Maxwell as McTitty\n* [[Crystal Lowe]] as Cam's Wedding friend\n* [[Steve Bacic]] as Howard Blaine\n-->\n\n==Reception==\n''Good Luck Chuck'' was panned by critics. According to [[Rotten Tomatoes]], only 5% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 114 reviews.
