Other notable past collaborators include ''Speed Racer'' composer [[Michael Giacchino]], ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'' [[Cinematographer|director of photography]] [[John Toll]] along with its editor Alexander Berner and hair and make-up designer Jeremy Woodhead, who worked on both.\n\n''Jupiter Ascending'' was released in the United States on February 6, 2015, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received generally negative reviews from critics; while the visual effects, plot and themes were praised, it was criticized for the writing, lack of character development, some of the performances, and excessive dialogue. It grossed $183 million against a $176\u2013210 million budget during its theatrical release, making it a [[box-office bomb]].\n\n==Plot==\nEarth and countless other planets were established by families of [[transhuman]] and alien royalty for the purpose of harvesting the resulting organisms to produce a [[youth serum]] for the elites on other planets. After the death of the [[matriarch]] of the House of [[Abraxas|Abrasax]], the most powerful of the alien dynasties, her children\u2014Balem, Kalique, and Titus\u2014quarrel over the inheritance; Balem inherits an enormous refinery on Jupiter, and Titus spends his on a lavish spaceship. Jupiter Jones narrates that her father, Maximilian, met her mother Aleksa in Saint Petersburg, Russia. After Maximilian is killed in a robbery, Aleksa names their daughter Jupiter, after his favorite planet, and they move to Chicago to live with Aleksa's family.\n\nYears later, Jupiter makes a modest living as a housekeeper to her wealthy neighbors. Wanting to buy a telescope, Jupiter agrees to sell her [[egg cell]]s, and uses her friend Katharine's name as a pseudonym. At Katharine's house, Jupiter and Katharine are attacked by extraterrestrial \"Keepers\". Jupiter photographs them, but they erase both women's memories of the incident. Jupiter finds the strange photograph on her phone while waiting at an egg donation clinic, but cannot recall anything about it. During the procedure, the doctors and nurses are revealed to be Keepers sent to kill her, but she is saved by Caine Wise, a former soldier sent by Titus to bring her to him. As Caine and Jupiter flee, their spaceship is destroyed by a squad of Keepers. Caine fends off the attack, kills the Keepers, and hijacks one of their vehicles while protecting Jupiter. Caine realizes that Jupiter must be of great significance to Titus and Balem, who are revealed to have sent the Keepers to Earth to capture her. Caine takes Jupiter to the hideout of Stinger Apini, another former soldier living in exile on Earth. After learning she can control the bees in Stinger's residence, Jupiter discovers that she is galactic royalty.\n\nStinger agrees to help Jupiter, but she is captured by Balem's hunters, bribed by Kalique to bring Jupiter to her palace on a distant planet. There, Kalique explains that Jupiter is genetically identical to the dead matriarch, and therefore is the Earth's rightful owner. Supported by Captain Diomika Tsing of the intergalactic police force Aegis, Caine retrieves her from Kalique and takes her to the intergalactic capital planet Ores to claim her inheritance.\n\nIn another attempt to lure Jupiter to him, Balem sends Greeghan to kidnap her family. On the way back to Earth, Titus's henchmen capture Jupiter, and detain Caine as punishment for not bringing Jupiter to him. Titus reveals to Caine his plan to marry Jupiter, kill her, and claim Earth. Titus then throws Caine into the void of space and attempts to seduce Jupiter, declaring his intention to dismantle the youth serum trade, of which Earth is the next intended source. Caine survives being spaced and returns with Stinger to save Jupiter at the altar before she gets married. Jupiter asks to return home, but learns that her family has been taken hostage by Balem.\n\nAt his refinery inside the [[Great Red Spot]], Balem demands Earth in exchange for Jupiter's family. Realizing that Balem cannot \"harvest\" Earth without her permission, Jupiter refuses. Caine infiltrates the refinery and damages its gravity hull, causing the refinery to begin collapsing. While the occupants evacuate the refinery, Tsing's ship moves in and rescues Jupiter's family.\n\nJupiter survives the collapsing structures, only to land at the feet of Balem, who tries to kill her. She fights him off before Balem falls to his death; Caine saves her as the refinery is in its final stages of collapse. Tsing opens a portal to Earth and prepares to evacuate, potentially leaving Caine and Jupiter behind. However, she is relieved to find that they have survived and crossed the portal, along with Tsing's ship.\n\nJupiter's family is returned home with no memory of their disappearance, while Jupiter secretly retains ownership of the Earth. Caine's rank in the Legion is restored, and he and Jupiter begin a relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Caine Wise, a genetically engineered soldier: half human and half canine, though this is not immediately visible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/jupiter-ascending-channing-tatum-spider-man-2-jamie-foxx/|title=Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx Talk JUPITER ASCENDING & SPIDER-MAN 2; Tatum Says He Plays a \"Hybrid Wolf and Human\"|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|date=June 22, 2013|access-date=June 23, 2013}}</ref> He has a tremendously powerful sense of smell that allows him to track a gene through the universe.<ref name=\"GQ\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Heath|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201406/channing-tatum-kanye-west |title=Channing Tatum on How Kanye West Influenced Jupiter Ascending |magazine=[[GQ]] |date=January 4, 2014 |access-date=June 9, 2014}}</ref> To perform the role, Tatum wore a mouthpiece to change the shape of his lower jaw, which prevented him from closing his mouth and made it difficult to speak.\n* [[Mila Kunis]] as Jupiter Jones.

Instead, they tried to create a new form of female sci-fi hero in the space-opera genre. \"We were, like, 'Can we bring a different kind of female character like Dorothy or [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]?
