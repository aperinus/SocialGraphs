The film stars [[Saoirse Ronan]] as the [[Hanna (character)|title character]], a girl raised in the wilderness of northern Finland by her father, an ex-[[CIA]] operative ([[Eric Bana]]), who trains her as an assassin. [[Cate Blanchett]] portrays a senior CIA agent who tries to track down and eliminate the girl and her father. The soundtrack was written by [[The Chemical Brothers]].\n\n''Hanna'' was released in North America in April 2011 and in Europe in May 2011. It received generally positive reviews. Reviewers praised the performances of Ronan and Blanchett as well as the action sequences and themes.\n\n==Plot==\nHanna Heller is a fifteen-year-old girl who lives with her father, Erik, in [[Lapland (Finland)|rural northern Finland]]. Since the age of two, Hanna has been trained by him, an ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative from [[Germany]], to be a skilled assassin. He teaches her [[hand-to-hand combat]] and drills her in [[target shooting]]. Erik knows a secret that cannot become public and Marissa Wiegler, a senior CIA officer, seeks to eliminate him.\n\nErik has trained Hanna with the intent to kill Marissa. One night, she tells him she is \"ready\" to face their enemies. Erik digs up a [[Distress radio beacon|radio beacon]] that will alert the CIA to their presence. Although he warns Hanna that a confrontation with Marissa will be fatal for either her or Marissa, he leaves the final decision to her and she activates the beacon. Erik leaves, instructing her to meet him in Berlin.\n\nHanna is seized by special forces and taken to an underground CIA complex where a suspicious Marissa sends a [[Political decoy|decoy]] to interrogate Hanna when she asks for her by name. While talking to the double, Hanna starts to cry and embraces her tightly, which makes her captors uneasy. They send guards to sedate her.\n\nAs they enter the cell, Hanna kills the double along with some guards and escapes, discovering that she is in [[Morocco]]. Hanna meets Sebastian and Rachel, who are on a camper-van holiday with their children, Sophie and Miles, and stows away in the vehicle on a ferry to Spain, seeking to reach Berlin. The family is kind to her, and she and Sophie become friends: Hanna even tells her about the Berlin rendezvous and they kiss.\n\nMarissa hires Isaacs, a sadistic former agent, to capture Hanna while other agents are searching for Erik. She kills Hanna's maternal grandmother after failing to learn anything useful from her. Isaacs and two skinheads have discovered from the Moroccan hotelier with whom Hanna escaped and trail them. Cornering her and the family sometime down the road, Isaacs attacks but Hanna manages to escape after a vicious fight.\n\nMarissa interrogates the family and discovers from Miles that Hanna is heading to Berlin. The family is never seen again. Meanwhile, in Berlin, Erik fights off an attempted assassination and tries but fails to kill Marissa.\n\nArriving at the rendezvous in an abandoned Berlin amusement park, Hanna meets Knepfler, an eccentric magician and friend of Erik's who lives there. Before Erik arrives, Marissa and Isaacs appear. Hanna escapes, but overhears comments that suggest Erik is not her biological father.\n\nHanna then goes to her grandmother's empty apartment where she finds Erik, who admits he is not her biological father but loves her as his own. He explains that he once recruited pregnant women into a CIA program where their children's [[DNA]] was enhanced to create [[super-soldier]]s. After the project was shut down, its subjects \u2013 all except Hanna \u2013 were eliminated.\n\nMarissa and Isaacs arrive; Erik acts as a distraction to allow Hanna to escape. He kills Isaacs, but is shot dead by Marissa, who then flees to Knepfler's house in the abandoned amusement park and finds Hanna, who has just discovered Knepfler hanging dead upside-down, having been tortured to death by Isaacs.\n\nAfter Hanna flees, she is cornered by Marissa. In a final confrontation, Hanna turns her back to Marissa who shoots at her; but Hanna wounds Marissa by shooting an arrow at her. A now-staggering Marissa, pursued by Hanna, trips, leaving her badly injured. Hanna picks up Marissa's gun and uses it to kill her with two shots &mdash; a method she had previously used while hunting a deer at the film's beginning.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Saoirse Ronan]] as [[Hanna (character)|Hanna]]\n* [[Eric Bana]] as Erik Heller\n* [[Vicky Krieps]] as Johanna Zadek\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Marissa Wiegler\n* Paris Arrowsmith as CIA Tech #1\n* [[John Macmillan (actor)|John Macmillan]] as Lewis\n* Tim Beckmann as Walt\n* Paul Birchard as Bob\n* Christian Malcolm as Head of Ops\n* Jamie Beamish as Burton\n* Tom Hodgkins as Monitor\n* Vincent Montuel as Camp G Doctor #1\n* Nathan Nolan as Camp G Doctor #2\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as False Marissa\n* [[Jessica Barden]] as Sophie\n* Aldo Maland as Miles\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Rachel\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Sebastian\n* Mohamed Majd as Moroccan Hotel Owner\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Isaacs\n* Sebastian H\u00fclk as Titch\n* [[Joel Basman]] as Razor\n* Mathias Harrebye-Brandt as Danish Policeman (as Mathias Harrebye Brandt)\n* [[\u00c1lvaro Cervantes]] as Feliciano\n* Marc Soto as Feliciano's Brother\n* Gudrun Ritter as Katrin Zadek\n* [[Martin Wuttke]] as Knepfler\n* Rose Wakesho as Linda\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was co-produced by the American Holleran Company and German [[Studio Babelsberg]], with financial support from various German film funds and the main distributor, [[Focus Features]], which holds the copyright to the film.<ref name=BFI/>\n\n===Development===\nThe film's story and script were written by [[Seth Lochhead]] while a student at [[Vancouver Film School]].<ref>[https://vancouversun.com/Vancouver+Film+School+helped+Seth+Lochhead+realize+ambition+thriller+Hanna/4578471/story.html The Vancouver Sun, 7 April 2011: ''Vancouver Film School helped Seth Lochhead realize his ambition for big thriller Hanna''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528061812/https://vancouversun.com/Vancouver+Film+School+helped+Seth+Lochhead+realize+ambition+thriller+Hanna/4578471/story.html |date=28 May 2018 }} Re-linked 25 March 2014</ref> He wrote the original story and script [[spec script|on spec]],<ref>[http://www.vfs.com/blog/2007/08/27/year-of-living-famously Vancouver Film School, 27 August 2007, Seth Lochhead blog: ''The Year of Living Famously''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411141120/http://www.vfs.com/blog/2007/08/27/year-of-living-famously/ |date=11 April 2011 }} Re-linked 25 March 2014</ref> and finalized the script in 2006, with [[David Farr (theatre director)|David Farr]] providing later changes.<ref name=\"Focus\">[http://www.focusfeatures.com/hanna Foucus Features: ''Hanna''] Re-linked 25 March 2014</ref>\n\n[[Danny Boyle]] and [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] were previously attached to direct the film, before it was confirmed that Joe Wright would direct,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blog.moviefone.com/2009/11/17/joe-wright-to-tackle-action-with-hanna |title= Joe Wright to Tackle Action With 'Hanna' |first= Scott |last= Weinberg |work= blog.moviefone.com |date= 17 November 2009 |access-date= 17 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120612024526/http://blog.moviefone.com/2009/11/17/joe-wright-to-tackle-action-with-hanna/ |archive-date= 12 June 2012 |url-status= dead }}</ref> after Ronan prompted the producers to consider him.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cineplex.com/News/Saoirse-Ronan-and-Eric-Bana-talk-Hanna.aspx|title= Cineplex Movie Blog \u2013 Saoirse Ronan and Eric Bana talk Hanna|first= Mark|last= Pilkington|publisher= cineplex.com|date= 6 April 2011|access-date= 17 April 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160120114657/http://www.cineplex.com/News/Saoirse-Ronan-and-Eric-Bana-talk-Hanna.aspx|archive-date= 20 January 2016|url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nMost of the filming was done at Studio Babelsberg in [[Potsdam]], but locations also included Lake [[Kitkaj\u00e4rvi]] in [[Kuusamo|Kuusamo, Finland]], several German locations (including [[Bad T\u00f6lz]], the [[Magdeburg Water Bridge|water bridge at Magdeburg]], [[K\u00f6hlbrandbr\u00fccke]] and [[Reeperbahn]] in [[Hamburg]], and various sites in Berlin, such as [[Kottbusser Tor]], [[G\u00f6rlitzer Bahnhof (Berlin U-Bahn)|G\u00f6rlitzer Bahnhof]] and [[Spreepark]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/hanna/a/joe-wright-interview.htm |title=Joe Wright Interview -
