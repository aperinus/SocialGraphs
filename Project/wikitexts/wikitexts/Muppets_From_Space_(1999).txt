The sixth theatrical film in [[The Muppets (franchise)|''The Muppets'' franchise]], it is the first Muppets film to not be a musical and the first film since the death of Muppets creator [[Jim Henson]] to have an original Muppets-focused plot. In addition to the Muppet performers, the film stars [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[F. Murray Abraham]], [[David Arquette]], [[Josh Charles]], [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hogan]], [[Ray Liotta]], and [[Andie MacDowell]]. In the film, [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] attempts to discover his origins. After he and [[Rizzo the Rat]] are captured by government officials during his search, [[Kermit the Frog]] and the rest of the Muppet gang set out to rescue them.\n\nThe film was shot in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] in 1998, and was released in the United States on July 14, 1999 by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] under its [[Columbia Pictures]] label. It grossed $22.3 million and had a budget of $24 million. Alongside ''[[The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland]]'', it is the last Muppets feature film to have the involvement of [[Frank Oz]] prior to his retirement from Muppet performing the following year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title=How Kermit and the Muppets Got Their Mojo Back|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/the-muppets-talk-about-comebacks-and-their-relationship-with-disney-1201128921/|access-date=12 March 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=11 March 2014}}</ref> It is also the last Muppet film written by Juhl prior to his death in 2005, the last Muppets film to be released theatrically until ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' in 2011, and the last theatrically released Muppet film to be produced by [[The Jim Henson Company]] before the franchise was acquired by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 2004.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] has always been identified as a \"whatever\"; but, after having dreams of abandonment and rejection, including him being denied entry to [[Noah's Ark]], he begins to realize just how alone he is in the world.\n\nGonzo tells [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] that he is getting tired of being referred to as a \"whatever\". After an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien species]] appears to be trying to send a message through his bowl of cereal, Gonzo realizes that he may not be alone after all and that evening, he climbs to the rooftop of the Muppet boarding house to watch the sky. Suddenly, he is struck by a [[Lightning strike|bolt of lightning]], which allows him to communicate with a pair of cosmic knowledge fish, who reveal his origins as an alien from outer space.\n\nHoping to contact the aliens, Gonzo makes an impromptu appearance at the television studio for ''UFO Mania'', where [[Miss Piggy]] works. Unable to convince Kermit and his friends of the aliens' existence, Gonzo is lured by Agent Barker to K. Edgar Singer of C.O.V.N.E.T., a top secret national security facility disguised as a cement factory, whose mission is to investigate threats of extraterrestrial attacks. Singer is aware of the aliens' attempts to communicate with Earth and, having seen Gonzo on television, believes that he is the key to convincing his superior General Luft that aliens exist.\n\nGonzo and [[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]] are taken to C.O.V.N.E.T., where [[Hulk Hogan]], who is working there as an agent, flushes Rizzo down a tube to the facility's [[rat]] medical research held by Dr. Tucker, alongside other Muppet rats. Unable to get answers from Gonzo about the aliens, Singer decides to have Gonzo's brain surgically removed, and has him taken to a holding cell. Meanwhile, after Miss Piggy interrogates Barker, she, Kermit, [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]], [[Pepe the King Prawn|Pepe]], and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] go to rescue Gonzo and Rizzo from C.O.V.N.E.T., using various inventions from [[Bunsen Honeydew|Bunsen]] and [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]].\n\nWhile Gonzo is in his cell, an alien [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeling]] his voice through a sandwich asks him where the alien ship can land, and Gonzo suggests a beach known by the name of Cape Doom, unaware that Singer's assistant Agent Rentro (Bobo the Bear) is listening. Gonzo is then taken to the surgery room, and the Muppets arrive to rescue Gonzo and Rizzo.\n\nMeanwhile, Rizzo escapes from medical research and frees Gonzo from the dissection table, while Singer and Luft witness the other rats attack the surgeon Dr. Phil Van Neuter. Luft feels that his time has been wasted and angrily leaves. Upon discovering from Rentro that Gonzo is heading for Cape Doom, Singer prepares the Subatomic Neutro-Destabilizer weapon to use on the aliens. Singer and Rentro then head to Cape Doom.\n\nThe Muppets rescue Gonzo from the facility, then arrive at Cape Doom where a crowd of alien believers await their arrival. After an hour-long wait, the ship comes to Earth and the aliens, who all resemble Gonzo, explain that many years ago they lost him, but now welcome him back. Singer shows up and tries to kill the aliens, ultimately failing to do so (Rentro having removed the weapon's battery) and is laughed at. Gonzo considers going with his long-lost family to their home planet, but chooses to stay on Earth with the Muppets with his family's blessing. Singer is invited by the aliens to go with them and leaves as Earth's ambassador.\n\nLater that night, Gonzo and the other Muppets watch the stars from the boarding house roof.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as K.

As a result, his characters were performed on set by other Muppet performers, with Oz later [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|looping]] his voice in post-production. For most of the filming, [[Peter Linz]], [[John Kennedy (puppeteer)|John Kennedy]], and Rickey Boyd performed his characters, with Linz performing [[Miss Piggy]], Boyd performing [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] and Kennedy performing [[Sam Eagle]] and [[Fozzie Bear]]. Kennedy and Linz's voices can be heard in the film's theatrical trailer.\n\nThe film would mark the first appearance of [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] since the theme park attraction ''[[Muppet*Vision 3D]]'' (1991). His voice was performed in ''Muppets from Space'' by Adam Hunt, the brother of Scooter's initial performer [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]].\n\nThe film's visual effects were provided by Illusion Arts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kenneth Nakada VFX|url=http://www.nakadavfx.com/work-history/work-history-feature-films/|website=nakadavfx.com|access-date=August 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nAn earlier draft of the story was written by [[Kirk Thatcher]] called ''Muppets in Space''. In the screenplay, aliens abducted [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] because they believed him to be their leader, leading the other Muppets to attempt to save him. A set of [[Welch's]] Jelly Glasses were produced based around this theme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.henson.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |website=www.henson.com |access-date=1 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980702051611/http://www.henson.com/index.html |archive-date=2 July 1998 |url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the production notes featured on the DVD, the film was inspired by [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]]'s song in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979), \"[[I'm Going to Go Back There Someday]]\".<ref>(2003) ''Muppets From Space'' [[DVD]] \"Production Notes\" bonus feature.</ref>\n\nIn a 2009 interview, co-writer [[Joey Mazzarino|Joseph Mazzarino]] revealed that he left the project before shooting started, due to changes made to his draft of the screenplay. Mazzarino stated that his draft included parodies of ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'', ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' (1997) and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), and that [[Randal Kleiser]] had been selected to direct the film. However, shortly before shooting began, [[The Jim Henson Company]] fired Kleiser, as they felt he was not \"bringing enough vision\", with Mazzarino subsequently hiring [[Tim Hill (director)|Timothy Hill]] as the new director, and the parodies were removed, as Hill wanted the film to be \"more real\".<ref name=\"Hennes\">{{cite web|last=Hennes|first=Joe|title=A Chat with Joey Mazzarino, part 2|url=http://www.toughpigs.com/a-chat-with-joey-mazzarino-part-2/|website=toughpigs.com|access-date=March 18, 2017|date=February 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Mazzarino disliked the revised ending of the film, and stated in his draft Gonzo did not turn out to be an alien. Instead, the aliens were getting signals from episodes of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and made themselves look like Gonzo, as they considered him to be the \"ultimate being\". In the end, they would reveal their true forms, and Gonzo would remain a \"whatever\", with his family being the Muppets.<ref name=\"Hennes\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Muppets from Space: The Ultimate Muppet Trip\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = [[1999 in music|July 13, 1999]]<ref name=\"BillboardMFS\" />\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack album|Soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = {{ubl|[[Sony Wonder]]|[[Epic Records|Epic]]}}<ref name=\"BillboardMFS\">{{cite magazine |last1=McCormick |first1=Moira |title=\"Muppets From Space\" Soundtrack Ready To Touch Down |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 |access-date=April 8, 2019 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=July 3, 1999 |pages=68|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[The Muppets]]\n| prev_title = [[Muppet Treasure Island#Music|Muppet Treasure Island: Original Soundtrack]]\n| prev_year  = 1996\n| next_title = [[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz#Music|Best of the Muppets featuring The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]\n| next_year  = 2005\n}}\n''Muppets from Space'' was the first Muppet film to not feature original music, opting instead for a soundtrack consisting primarily of classic soul and funk tracks.\n\nSome tracks were remade by contemporary artists, such as \"[[Shining Star (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Shining Star]]\" by the [[Dust Brothers]] featuring Jeymes, and \"Dazz\" by [[G. Love and Special Sauce]], recorded at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Sheffield, Alabama]]. The band was in the studio recording with Little Milton on the \"Welcome To Little Milton\" record. The band got a call from Jason Brown, their manager, while in the studio, to record a song for the movie. Will McFarlane, who was a Shoals/Malaco studio regular, and former Bonnie Raitt guitarist, played with the band on the song. [[Parliament (band)|Parliament's]] \"[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]\" was updated by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] as a duet with [[Pepe the King Prawn]] named \"Flash Light (Spaceflight)\".\n\nTwo soundtracks were released featuring music from the film. The first album, '''''Muppets from Space: The Ultimate Muppet Trip''''', consisted of the classic soul and funk tracks featured in the film and was jointly released by [[Sony Wonder]], [[Epic Records]], and [[Epic Soundtrax|Sony Music Soundtrax]] a day before the film's premiere,<ref name=\"BillboardMFS\" /> while the other was an album containing the film's score, which was composed by [[Jamshied Sharifi]] with additional work by [[Rupert Gregson-Williams]].

This song was intended to be sung by Gonzo. Gonzo's performer [[Dave Goelz]] had also recorded a new rendition of \"I'm Going to Go Back There Someday\" for this film, a song which had originally appeared in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979).
