It is an adaptation of [[Dick King-Smith]]'s 1983 novel ''[[The Sheep-Pig]]'', which tells the story of a farm pig who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The film is narrated by [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] and the main animal characters are played by both real animals and [[animatronic]] puppets.\n\n''Babe'' was filmed in [[Robertson, New South Wales|Robertson]], [[New South Wales]] in 1994 and released theatrically on 4 August 1995, going on to become a critical and commercial success, with several [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations. A sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'', was released on 25 November 1998 and failed to achieve the same success as the original film.<ref>[http://www.decentfilms.com/reviews/babepiginthecity Review of Babe: Pig in the City (1998)] at Decent Films</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->\nAfter being used in \"guess the weight\" contest at a [[county fair]], orphaned piglet Babe is brought home to the farm of the contest winner, Arthur Hoggett. There he is taken in by [[Border Collie]] Fly, her irascible mate Rex and their puppies and befriends a duck named Ferdinand, who wakes people by crowing like a rooster every morning so he will be considered useful and be spared from being eaten. \n\nDismayed when the Hoggetts buy an alarm clock, Ferdinand persuades Babe to help him destroy it. In doing so they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts' cat, and wreck the house in the ensuing chaos. Rex sternly instructs Babe to stay away from Ferdinand and the house. Seeing Fly saddened when her puppies are put up for sale, Babe lets her adopt him. With the Hoggett's relatives visiting for Christmas, Hoggett decides against choosing Babe for [[Christmas dinner]], remarking a pretext to his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize for ham at the next county fair. Ferdinand's friend Rosanna is served instead, prompting Ferdinand to escape the farm.\n\nImpressed after seeing Babe sort hens, separating the brown from the white ones, Hoggett takes him to try and herd the sheep. Encouraged by an elder ewe named Maa, the sheep cooperate, but Rex perceives Babe's actions as an insult to sheepdogs. After Fly stands up for Babe, Rex attacks and injures her and bites Hoggett's hand when he tries to intervene; Rex is subsequently chained to the dog house, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe. One morning, Babe scares off a trio of [[feral dogs]] attacking the sheep, but Maa is mortally injured, and dies as a result. Hoggett, thinking Babe killed Maa, prepares to shoot him but Fly finds out the truth from the sheep and distracts Hoggett for long enough until Esme informs him about the dogs' attacks on neighboring farms.\n\t\t\nWhen Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheepherding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house, where he is scratched by Duchess, who in turn is temporarily confined outside as punishment. When she is let back in later, she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans consume pigs. After learning from Fly that this is true, Babe runs away and Rex finds him the next morning in a cemetery. Hoggett brings a horrified and demoralized Babe home, where he refuses to eat. Hoggett feeds him from a baby bottle, sings \"[[If I Had Words]]\" and dances a [[jig]] for him, restoring Babe's faith in Hoggett's affection.\n\t\nAt the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. After promising he will treat them better from now on, the sheep disclose to him a secret password. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's acclamation, Babe is unanimously given the highest score. While he sits down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him with the standard command to sheep dogs that their job is done, \"That'll do, Pig. That'll do.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christine Cavanaugh]] as Babe\n* Danny Mann as Ferdinand\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Arthur Hoggett\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Fly\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as Rex\n* [[Magda Szubanski]] as Esme Hoggett\n* [[Miriam Flynn]] as Maa\n* [[Russi Taylor]] as Duchess\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as the Narrator\n* [[Brittany Byrnes]] as the Hoggetts' granddaughter\n* Wade Hayward as the Hoggetts' grandson\n* [[Paul Goddard (actor)|Paul Goddard]] as the Hoggetts' son-in-law\n* Zoe Burton as the Hoggetts' daughter\n* Michael Edward-Stevens as The Horse\n* Charles Bartlett as The Cow\n* Evelyn Krape as an unnamed Ewe\n* [[Paul Livingston]] as Rooster\n* Mary Acres as Valda\n* Janet Foye, Pamela Hawkins and Karen Gough as Country Women\n* [[John Erwin]] as Voice of TV Commentator\n* [[Doris Grau]] as Voice of Country Woman\n* [[Marshall Napier]] as Chairman of Judges\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe puppies were voiced by [[Ross Bagley]], Gemini Barnett, Rachel Davey, [[Debi Derryberry]], [[Jazz Raycole|Jazzmine Dillingham]], [[Courtland Mead]], and Kevin Woods.\n\nThe sheep were voiced by Jane Alden, Kimberly Bailey, [[Patrika Darbo]], Michelle Davison, Julie Forsyth, Maeve Germaine, Rosanna Huffman, Carlyle King, [[Tina Lifford]], Genni Nevinson, Linda Phillips, Paige Pollack, and [[Kerry Walker]].\n\nThe other character voices were provided by Barbara Harris, [[Jacqueline Brennan]], Doug Burch, Tony Hughes, Linda Janssen, Daamen Krall, Charlie MacLean, Justin Monjo, Antonia Murphy, [[Neil Ross]] and [[Scott Vernon]].\n\n==Production==\n''Babe'' is an adaptation of [[Dick King-Smith]]'s 1983 novel ''[[The Sheep-Pig]]'', also known as ''Babe: The Gallant Pig'' in the US, which tells the story of a pig raised as livestock who wants to do the work of a [[Herding dog|sheepdog]].

He was persuaded by his friend [[Charles Keating (actor)|Charles Keating]] to take it anyway. Keating told him: \"it's a free ticket to Australia, and if the movie tanks, it's not your fault, it's the pig's fault.\" Cromwell said Noonan wanted him for the part, and won out over Miller, who had wanted to cast an Australian actor. Cromwell's fee was around $50,000. He asked for an increase when he realised the movie was making millions of dollars, but was turned down. Nevertheless, he said \"I got a lot out of that film, and it turned my whole life around. I didn't have to audition anymore.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2020/12/18/james-cromwell-talks-babe-at-25-and-how-he-almost-turned-it-down/|title=James Cromwell Talks 'Babe' At 25 And How He Almost Turned It Down|work=[[Forbes]]|date=18 December 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, a sequel directed by Miller, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'', was released.

Classical orchestral music by 19th-century French composers is used throughout the film, but is disguised in a variety of ways and often integrated by Westlake into his score. The theme song \"[[If I Had Words]]\" (lyrics by Jonathan Hodge), sung by Hoggett near the film's conclusion, is an adaptation of the ''Maestoso'' final movement of the [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|''Organ Symphony'']] by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], and was originally performed in 1977 by [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Yvonne Keeley]].
