Michener]]'s 1947 [[short story|short-story]] collection ''[[Tales of the South Pacific]]''. The film, directed by [[Joshua Logan]], stars [[Rossano Brazzi]], [[Mitzi Gaynor]], [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] and [[Ray Walston]] in the leading roles with [[Juanita Hall]] as Bloody Mary, the part that she had played in the original stage production. The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], winning the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Academy Award for Best Sound]] for [[Fred Hynes]]. It is set in 1943, during World War II, on an island in the South Pacific.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Emile de Becque\n** [[Giorgio Tozzi]] as Emile's singing voice\n* [[Mitzi Gaynor]] as Ensign Nellie Forbush\n* [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] as Lieutenant Joseph Cable, USMC\n** [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]] as Cable's singing voice (uncredited)\n* [[Ray Walston]] as Luther Billis\n* [[Juanita Hall]] as Bloody Mary\n** [[Muriel Smith (singer)|Muriel Smith]] as Bloody Mary's singing voice (uncredited)\n* [[France Nuyen]] as Liat\n* [[Russ Brown (actor)|Russ Brown]] as Captain George Brackett\n* [[Jack Mullaney]] as  The Professor\n* [[Ken Clark (actor)|Ken Clark]] as Stewpot\n** [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as Stewpot's singing voice (uncredited)\n* [[Floyd Simmons]] as Commander Bill Harbison\n* Candace Lee as Ngana\n* Warren Hsieh as Jerome\n** [[Betty Wand]] as Jerome's singing voice (uncredited)\n* [[Tom Laughlin]] as Lieutenant Buzz Adams\n* Francis Kahele as Henry, Emile's servant\n* Robert Jacobs and [[John Gabriel (actor)|John Gabriel]] as Communications men\n* [[Richard Harrison (actor)|Richard Harrison]] as Co-Pilot\n* [[Ron Ely]] as Navigator\n* Richard H.

(1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'' (1955) and ''[[Carousel (1956 film)|Carousel]]'', the producers decided to tackle a big-screen adaptation of ''South Pacific'' as their next project.\n\nThe film was produced by \"South Pacific Enterprises\", a company created specifically for the production, owned by Rodgers, Hammerstein, Logan, Magna Theatre Corporation (owners of the [[Todd-AO]] widescreen process the film would be photographed in), and [[Leland Hayward]], producer of the original stage production.<ref name=\"dame\">{{cite web|title=Notes for South Pacific|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/90961/south-pacific#notes|url-status=live|access-date=December 7, 2021|website=TCM.com}}</ref> [[20th Century Fox]] partially invested in the production in exchange for some distribution rights. Additionally, all the departments and department heads were Fox's, and Fox's research department re-engineered the Todd-AO process, changing its frame rate from 30 fps (for 70mm presentations) to 24 fps, thereby eliminating \"simufilming\" in 65mm and 35mm (as in ''Oklahoma!'') or in 65mm 30 fps and 65mm 24 fps (as in ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]])'', and for the most part eliminating the American Optical lenses, replacing these with Bausch & Lomb's then new Super Baltars, and for the most part replacing the Fearless Superfilm cameras with a new family of Mitchell cameras commissioned by Fox (BFC, \"Blimped Fox Camera\", a 65mm version of Mitchell's BNC, and FC, \"Fox Camera\", a 65mm version of Mitchell's NC). The original Todd-AO cameras continued to be employed, occasionally, as a B or C camera.\n\nThe producers' original plan was to have [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]], the two leads of the original Broadway cast, reprise their roles for the film, but Pinza died suddenly in May 1957. Had he lived to perform in the film, the producers would have cast Martin.<ref name=\"liz\">{{cite web|title=Articles for South Pacific|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/90961/south-pacific#articles-reviews?articleId=18551|url-status=live|access-date=December 7, 2021|website=TCM.com}}</ref> Instead, [[Doris Day]] was offered the part of Nellie, but passed; [[Elizabeth Taylor]] tested for the same role, but was rejected by Rodgers after she suffered stage fright in her audition. Logan later heard her sing but was unable to persuade Rodgers to change his mind.<ref name= \"liz\" /> Ultimately, [[Mitzi Gaynor]], who had prior work in musical films, and had tested twice for Nellie, was cast in the role.<ref name= \"liz\" /> [[Rossano Brazzi]] was cast as Emile, a role that was first offered to such established stars as [[Charles Boyer]], [[Howard Keel]], [[Vittorio De Sica]] and [[Fernando Lamas]].<ref name= \"dame\" /> [[Ray Walston]], a noted Broadway musical actor, played the part of Seabee Luther Billis, which he'd previously played on stage in London.<ref name= \"liz\" />\n\n[[Hanalei Bay]], on the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian island]] of [[Kauai]], served as the filming location, with [[Emil Kosa Jr.]]'s matte paintings providing distant views of the fantastic island Bali Ha'i. A second unit filmed aerial views of [[Fiji]]an islands while some sources claim footage of [[Tioman]] Island, off [[Malaysia]]'s south east coast, were also featured, though this seems unlikely given the logistics involved. Location filming provided sweeping shots of tropical island scenes, as well as a new sequence  not in the stage version, in which Billis, having parachuted from a damaged plane, has a boat dropped on him, then comes under a series of attacks, following his fatalistic \"Oh, it's going to be one of ''those'' days, huh?\"{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe film includes the use of [[Photographic filter|colored filters]] during many of the song sequences,<ref name=\"Wide Screen Movies Magazine\">{{cite web|url=http://widescreenmovies.org/WSM10/southpacific.htm|title=Wide Screen Movies Magazine}}</ref> which has been a source of criticism for the film. Director [[Joshua Logan]] wanted these filters to produce subtle changes, but [[20th Century Fox]], the company that would distribute the 35mm version, made them extreme changes; since tickets to the film were pre-sold (it was a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] attraction), there was no time to correct this.<ref name= \"liz\" />\n\nAll of the songs from the stage production were retained for the film. A song entitled \"My Girl Back Home\", sung by Lt. Cable and Nellie, cut from the Broadway show, was added.<ref name=\"Wide Screen Movies Magazine\"/>\n\nOne of the differences between the film version and the Broadway version of the musical is that the first and second scenes of the play are switched around, together with all the songs contained in those two scenes. The original European cut of the film shown in the United Kingdom and Europe does not switch those scenes and it plays out as on the stage. The stage version begins with Nellie and Emile's first scene together on the plantation, then proceeds to show Bloody Mary, Lieutenant Joe Cable, and the Seabees on the beach, while in the film version Lieutenant Cable is shown at the very beginning being flown by plane to the island, where the Seabees and Bloody Mary have their first musical numbers. (The first musical number in the film is \"Bloody Mary\", sung by the Seabees, while in the stage version it is \"Dites-moi\", sung by Emile's children, again the only version of this song in the final release print of the film is a reprise sung with their father Emile. It is only on the soundtrack recording that it is first heard as a duet by just the children Ngana and Jerome themselves.) Emile is not shown in the film until about thirty minutes into it; in the film, Nellie first appears during the scene with the Seabees. Because of the switch, the show's most famous song, \"[[Some Enchanted Evening (song)|Some Enchanted Evening]]\", is not heard until nearly forty-five minutes into the film, while in the show it is heard about fifteen minutes after Act I starts.\n\nJuanita Hall sang in the stage production and took part in the recording of the stage production cast album. However, she had her singing dubbed for the film version by [[Muriel Smith (singer)|Muriel Smith]], who played Bloody Mary in the London stage production.<ref name= \"liz\" /> Metropolitan Opera star [[Giorgio Tozzi]] provided the singing voice for the role of Emile de Becque in the film.<ref name= \"liz\" /> [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] starred as 2nd Lt.
