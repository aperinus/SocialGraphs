The film tells the story of Cleve (Woods), a career [[hitman]], who wants to turn his life story into a [[book]] written by Dennis Meechum (Dennehy), a veteran police officer and best-selling author\n\nThe words and lyrics to the final score, entitled \"Perfect Ending\", were written by Lamont Dozier.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens in 1972 as a group of gunmen wearing [[Richard Nixon]] Halloween masks steal evidence from a police evidence storage unit, killing several officers in the process. Officer Dennis Meechum ([[Brian Dennehy]]) is seriously wounded after stabbing one of the robbers. He survives and publishes a book titled ''Inside Job'' based on his experience. Years later, Meechum, who by now has become an acclaimed author and a much decorated detective, is working on his next novel. He now suffers from [[writer's block]], and is a widowed father raising his daughter, Holly ([[Allison Balson]]).\n\nOn a case at the docks, a suspect runs as Meechum gives chase. A man named Cleve ([[James Woods]]) joins the chase. The suspect hides in an overhead crane and attempts to shoot Meechum, but Cleve kills the man, then mysteriously disappears.\n \nCleve arranges a meeting with Meechum, and tries to convince him to write a book about his history as a paid assassin for a corporate empire, Kappa International. Cleve intimidates Kappa's founder, David Madlock ([[Paul Shenar]]) about Meechum's next book, and promises Meechum to show evidence to back up his claims. They proceed to take trips to New York and Texas where Cleve tries to convince Meechum of his history of hits. While they are in Texas, it is revealed that Cleve was the injured masked gunman that Meechum had stabbed years earlier. Madlock, through his legal representatives, tries to bribe Meechum but fails.\n\nWhen an enforcer tries to steal a manuscript of Meechum's novel and attempts to kill Holly, Cleve intervenes by killing him. Cleve attempts to keep Holly safe by sending her to Meechum's agent, Roberta Gillian ([[Victoria Tennant]]). Madlock, however, manages to kidnap Holly. Meechum decides to have a meeting with Madlock at the latter's oceanfront estate. Cleve storms into the house, and guns down all of Madlock's bodyguards. Cleve then sacrifices his own life to save Holly from Madlock.  Meechum arrests Madlock, before comforting a dying Cleve. Cleve reminds Meechum about the book and says \"Remember I'm the hero\". At the end of the film, it is revealed that Meechum has published the book titled ''Retribution: The Fall of David Madlock and Kappa International'' and it has had 28 weeks on the bestseller list.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Woods]] as Cleve\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Dennis Meechum\n* [[Victoria Tennant]] as Roberta Gillian\n* [[Allison Balson]] as Holly Meechum\n* [[Paul Shenar]] as David Madlock\n* [[George Coe]] as Graham\n* [[Anne Pitoniak]] as Mrs. Foster\n* [[Mary Carver]] as Cleve's Mother\n* [[Sully Boyar]] as Monks\n* [[Kathleen Lloyd]] as Annie\n* [[Charles Tyner|Harold Tyner]] as Cleve's Father\n* [[Jay Ingram]] as Turner\n* Jeffrey Josephson as Pearlman\n* Edward Blackoff as Thorn\n* J.P. Bumstead as Rothman\n* Daniel Trent as Jarvis\n* [[William Bronder]] as Foley\n\n==Production==\n[[Larry Cohen]] wrote the original script. He was inspired by the film ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) and wrote it with [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Kirk Douglas]] in mind for the lead roles. The project was in development at a number of studios for years before Orion decided to make it.<ref>Doyle p 346</ref>\n\nJohn Flynn says he substantially rewrote the script which was originally called ''Hard Cover''.<ref name=\"john\">[http://www.focorevistadecinema.com.br/FOCO2/chartrand-johneng.htm Harvey Chartand, \"Interview with John Flynn\", ''Shock Cinema'' 2005]</ref>\n\nCohen was happy with the casting of Dennehy and Woods. He later said, \"The picture itself turned out to be pretty good with one glaring exception: the ending. Everything was going along great but then, in the last five minutes, they fucked up the whole movie. That is what I mean when I say it [the film] was only partially successful.\"<ref>Cohen p 347</ref>\n\nCohen's problem was that the climax had Dennehy's daughter running towards the killer instead of away from him. He recommended the scene be re-cut without shooting extra footage but says he was ignored.<ref>Doyle p 348</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nCohen says the film \" didn\u2019t do that well\" financially \"even though\u2014 as I keep saying\u2014 it was a good picture all the way up to the climax. I don\u2019t want to go on about it, but they killed the movie with that conclusion and it\u2019s amazing how you can do that. If they had made that one little cut I suggested, maybe the word of mouth would have been a little better and ''Best Seller'' could have made some money.\"<ref>Doyle p 349</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 1 star out of 4 stars, but [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] called it \"first-class action storytelling stripped to its essentials,\" with Dennehy making \"a wonderful straight man for Woods's fascinatingly creepy yet sensitive killer.\"<ref name=\"Jonathan Rosenbaum\">{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/best-seller/Film?oid=1060212|title=Best Seller|newspaper=[[The Chicago Reader]]|location=Chicago|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n*Doyle, Michael, ''Larry Cohen: The Stuff of Gods and Monsters'' Bear Manor Media, 2015\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0092641|title=Best Seller}}\n* {{Amg movie|4941|Best Seller}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=best_seller|title=Best Seller}}\n* {{mojo title|id=bestseller|title=Best Seller}}\n*{{AFI film|id=57553|title=Best Seller}}\n\n{{John Flynn}}\n\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:1980s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by John Flynn]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Larry Cohen]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
