The film was a box office success, grossing $165 million worldwide on a $40 million budget, and received six [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and won [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Rylance.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1957 [[New York City]], [[Rudolf Abel]] is arrested and charged with spying for the [[Soviet Union]], and insurance lawyer [[James B. Donovan]] is appointed to be Abel's legal counsel. Committed to the principle that the accused deserves a vigorous defense, he mounts the best defense of Abel he can, declining along the way to cooperate in the [[CIA]]'s attempts to induce him to violate the confidentiality of his communications with his client.\n\nAbel is convicted, but Donovan convinces the judge to spare Abel the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] because Abel had been serving his country honorably, and he might prove useful for a future prisoner exchange; Abel is sentenced to 30 years. Donovan [[Abel v. United States|appeals the conviction]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] based on the lack of a search warrant for the seizure of Abel's ciphers and photography equipment. For his principled stand Donovan and his family are harassed, including shots being fired at their home. The conviction is upheld.\n\nIn 1960, [[Francis Gary Powers|Gary Powers]], a pilot in the CIA's top secret [[U-2 spy plane]] program, is [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down over the USSR]]. He is captured and sentenced in a [[show trial]] to ten years' confinement, including three years in prison.\n\nDonovan receives a letter from [[East Germany]], purportedly sent by Abel's wife, thanking him and urging him to get in contact with their lawyer, whose name is Vogel. The CIA thinks this is a [[Track II diplomacy|back-channel message]] hinting that the USSR is willing to swap Powers for Abel. They unofficially ask Donovan to go to [[Berlin]] to negotiate the exchange; he arrives just as the [[Berlin Wall]] is going up. Crossing in to [[East Berlin]], he meets with a [[KGB]] officer in the Soviet Embassy and is then directed to Vogel, who represents the Attorney General of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany). The Attorney General seeks to swap Abel for an American graduate student named [[Frederic Pryor]], who had been arrested in East Germany; in the process the GDR hopes to gain official recognition by the United States.\n\nThe CIA wants Donovan to disregard Pryor but he insists that both Pryor and Powers be swapped for Abel. In a message to the Attorney General, he bluffs that they will either release Pryor with Powers or there will be no deal. The exchange of Powers and Abel is to take place at the [[Glienicke Bridge]], with Pryor to be released simultaneously at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. Tension builds as Pryor fails to arrive. The CIA, still primarily concerned with Powers, tell Abel he can go, but he refuses to move. It is confirmed that Pryor has been released, and the exchange takes place.\n\nThe next day, back in the United States, the government publicly acknowledges Donovan for negotiating the deal that rehabilitates his public image.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[James B.
