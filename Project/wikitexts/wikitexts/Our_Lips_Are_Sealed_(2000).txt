Unfortunately, Maddie and Abby have a problem of being blabbermouths; as a result, everywhere the Parkers are sent to live, the girls inadvertently end up revealing their witness status. The gang is led by a crime lord with the rather unfortunate [[surname]] of Hatchew (\"Bless you!\"), who will do anything to get his hands on the [[diamond]], which the thieves slipped into Abby's shoulder-bag during their escape from the [[crime scene]]; the gem ultimately ends up being set into her [[necklace]].\n\nThe family travels everywhere in the [[United States]], from [[Texas]] to a [[prairie]] [[town]], and eventually has been moved to every [[geographic location]] around the [[world]] possible, with the single exception of [[Australia]] &ndash; thus the FBI (who by this time are getting absolutely fed up of having to ''constantly'' relocate the Parkers, and all because Maddie and Abby can't keep their mouths shut) send them to live in [[Sydney]]. The girls at first have much trouble, especially fitting in with [[peer group|peers]]. Two assassins named Mac and Sidney are sent after them after having discovered their location by breaking into the FBI office.  Maddie and Abby defeat Mac and Sidney by knocking them out, tying them to surf boards and putting clips in Sidney's hair, painting Mac's toenails and threatening to put pink and blue [[bikinis]] on them. After the twins manage to convince them to change sides; they leave after the girls lure Hatchew to Australia. He comes after them, manages to get the diamond and sets his thug on them. It looks like they are about to die, until Mac and Sidney return and defeat the thug, saving the girls. Hatchew nearly gets away on a seaplane, but Maddie and Abby stop him using a boomerang and he is arrested by Katie, an undercover FBI agent posing as a lifeguard. The Parkers are finally able to return home to the United States with half the reward money for capturing the thieves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ashley Olsen]] as Abby Parker\n* [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] as  Maddie Parker\n* [[Jim Meskimen]] as Rick Parker\n* Tamara Clatterbuck as Teri Parker\n* [[Robert Miano]] as Hatchew\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as Mac\n* [[Richard Carter (actor)|Richard Carter]] as Sidney\n* Jo Phillips as Katie\n* [[Harold Hopkins (actor)|Harold Hopkins]] as Shelby Shaw (Oakland resident)\n* [[Ernie Hudson Jr.]] as Agent Bruce Banner / Hulk \n* [[Willie Garson]] as Agent Norm\n* Jade Bronneberg as Victoria\n* [[Ryan Clark (actor)|Ryan Clark]] as Pete\n* Scott Swalwell as Avery\n* Nina Schultz, Prudie Quigley as Sheila\n* [[Chris Foy (actor)|Chris Foy]] as Donny\n* [[Daniel Wakefield]] as Ray\n* [[Pete Callan]] as News reporter Milo\n* Chris Stapley as Leonard\n* Katie Fountain as Vanessa\n* Randall Rapstine as Principal\n* [[Marguerite MacIntyre]] as Teacher\n* [[J.
