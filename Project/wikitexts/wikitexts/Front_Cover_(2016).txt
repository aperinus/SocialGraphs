Through talent and hard work he attains his dream job as an assistant to Francesca, a celebrity fashion stylist. One day Francesca assigns Ryan to style Ning, an actor who has just arrived from Beijing, for a top magazine photo shoot. Ning dismisses Ryan's initial Western styling and demands Ryan create an image for him that represents the power of the new China. Their opinions clash, resulting in a strained working relationship.\n\nOver the following days, they socialize while working together and discover not only do they have a lot in common, a mutual attraction begins to develop. As they get closer, Ryan reveals that he detests his Chinese heritage because he is ashamed of his impoverished upbringing. Ning also opens up and confesses that he is closeted. As they fall in love, a Chinese tabloid magazine exposes Ning as gay. Terrified of the impact it will have on his career, Ning begs Ryan to lie for him at a press conference. Ryan must now decide whether to help Ning or stay true to himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/front-cover-2016|title=Front Cover movie review & film summary (2016) |last=Cheshire |first=Godfrey |website=RogerEbert.com |language=en |access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jake Choi]] as Ryan Fu\n*[[James Chen (actor)|James Chen]] as Qi Xiao Ning\n* [[Elizabeth Sung]] as Yen Fu\n*Jennifer Neala Page as Janet\n* Sonia Villani as Francesca\n*[[Li Jun Li]] as Miao\n*Ming Lee as Ba\n*Benjamin Thys as James\n*[[Tom Ligon]] as Gus LaMar\n\n== Release ==\n''Front Cover'' premiered in 2015 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]].\n\n[[Strand Releasing]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-2015-ray-yeungs-front-822582|title=TIFF: Ray Yeung's 'Front Cover' Goes to Strand Releasing|website=The Hollywood Reporter|date=12 September 2015 |language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> and Edko Films Ltd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/busan-edko-films-snags-cover-rights-1201609019/|title=Busan: Edko Films Snags 'Cover' Rights|last=Frater|first=Patrick|date=2015-10-03|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> acquired USA and Hong Kong distribution rights.
