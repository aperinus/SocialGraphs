Schaffner]]. The screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]] and [[Lorenzo Semple Jr.]] was based on the [[Papillon (book)|1969 autobiography]] by the French convict [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]]. The film stars [[Steve McQueen]] as Charri\u00e8re (\"Papillon\") and [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Louis Dega]]. Because it was filmed at remote locations, the film was quite expensive for the time ($12 million), but it earned more than twice that in its first year of release.<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/papillon/review/108790 \"Movie location and cost information\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108121959/http://movies.tvguide.com/papillon/review/108790 |date=2014-11-08 }}, ''TV Guide''</ref> The film's title is [[French language|French]] for \"Butterfly,\" referring to Charri\u00e8re's tattoo and nickname.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Henri Charri\u00e8re]] ([[Steve McQueen]]), is a [[safecracker]] nicknamed \"Papillon\" because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest. In 1933 France, he is \"wrongly\" convicted of murdering a [[pimp]] and is sentenced to life imprisonment within the penal system in [[French Guiana]]. En route, he meets a fellow convict, [[Louis Dega]] ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), an infamous forger and embezzler who is convinced that his wife will secure his release. Papillon offers to protect Dega if he will fund the former's escape once they reach Guiana. Enduring the horrors of life in a jungle [[labor camp]], the two eventually become friends.\n\nOne day, Papillon defends Dega from a sadistic guard and escapes into the jungle, but is captured and sentenced to two years in [[solitary confinement]]. In gratitude, Dega has extra food smuggled to Papillon. When the smuggling is discovered, the warden screens Papillon's cell in darkness for six months and halves his rations, believing that it will force him to reveal his benefactor. Half-insane and reduced to eating insects to survive, Papillon refuses to give up Dega's name. He is eventually released and sent to the infirmary in [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni|St-Laurent-du-Maroni]] to recover.\n\nPapillon sees Dega again and asks him to arrange for another escape attempt. Dega helps him meet an inmate doctor, who offers to secure him a boat on the outside with the help of a man named Pascal. Fellow prisoner Clusiot ([[Woodrow Parfrey]]) and a gay orderly named [[Andr\u00e9 Maturette]] ([[Robert Deman]]) join the escape plot. During the escape, Clusiot is knocked unconscious by a guard; Dega is forced to subdue the guard and reluctantly joins Papillon and Maturette, climbing the walls to the outside. Dega fractures his ankle in the fall. The trio meet Pascal and they escape into the night. In the jungle the next day, Pascal delivers the prisoners to their boat, but after he leaves the convicts discover that it is fake. They encounter a local trapper ([[John Quade]]) who has killed the bounty hunters that were waiting for them; he guides the three to a nearby [[leper colony]], where they obtain supplies and a seaworthy boat.\n\nThe trio eventually land in [[Honduras]] and are accosted by a group of soldiers, who open fire and wound Maturette. He is captured along with Dega, while Papillon is forced to flee. Papillon evades the soldiers and lives for a long period with a native tribe; he awakens one morning to find them gone, leaving him with a small sack of pearls. Papillon pays a nun to take him to her [[convent]] where he asks the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]] for refuge, but she instead turns him over to the authorities.\n\nPapillon is brought back to French Guiana and sentenced to another five years of solitary confinement. He emerges a graying old man along with Maturette, whom he sees just before the latter dies. Papillon is then moved to the remote [[Devil's Island]] where he reunites with Dega, who has long given up all hope of being released. From a high cliff, Papillon observes a small cove where he discovers that the waves are powerful enough to carry a man out to sea and to the nearby mainland. Papillon urges Dega to join him in another escape, and the men make two floats out of bagged up coconuts. As they stand on the cliff side, Dega decides not to escape and begs Papillon not to either. Papillon embraces Dega a final time, and then leaps from the cliff. Grasping his float, he is successfully carried out to sea.\n\nA narrator states that Papillon made it to freedom, and lived the rest of his life a free man, while the prison was eventually closed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]] aka Papillon\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Louis Dega]]\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Indian chief\n* [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]] as Julot\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as [[Toussaint (leper chief)|Toussaint]], leper colony chief\n* [[Robert Deman]] as [[Andr\u00e9 Maturette]]\n* [[Woodrow Parfrey]] as Clusiot\n* [[Bill Mumy]] as Lariot\n* [[George Coulouris]] as Dr. Chatal\n* Ratna Assan as Zoraima\n* [[William Smithers]] as Warden Barrot\n* [[Val Avery]] as Pascal\n* [[Gregory Sierra]] as Antonio\n* [[Ron Soble]] as Santini\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Condemened men's block, St. Laurent..jpg|thumb|The prison as it appeared in 1954, not long before it was closed and abandoned]]\nAfter the publication of ''Papillon'' in 1969, a bidding war started between [[Avco-Embassy|Avco-Embassy Pictures]], [[Continental Distributing]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and numerous French film companies for the film rights. Continental Distributing won the rights for $500,000 with the intent to hire [[Roman Polanski]] as director and [[Warren Beatty]] as lead actor, but the studio's funding fell through. It sold the rights to producer [[Robert Dorfmann]], who initially intended to hire [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] as director and [[Charles Bronson]] as star before turning to [[Franklin J. Schaffner]] and [[Steve McQueen]]. The film's first screenplay by [[William Goldman]], which was more faithful to the book than the final film, was rewritten by [[Lorenzo Semple Jr.]] to expand the role of Louis Dega in order to convince Dustin Hoffman to join the cast and eliminate depictions of [[Prison sexuality|homosexuality among prisoners]]. After Hoffman's casting [[Dalton Trumbo]] further rewrote the screenplay.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Papillon|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/55041-PAPILLON?cxt=filmography|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-03|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\n''Papillon'' was filmed at various locations in [[Spain]] and [[Jamaica]], with the cave scenes filmed beneath what is now the [[Xtabi]] hotel on the cliffs of [[Negril]].

It was recorded in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] at the Ortophonic Recording Studio by the \"Unione Musicisti Roma Orchestra\". The film marked Goldsmith's fourth of seven collaborations with director [[Franklin J. Schaffner]], following his [[Academy Award]]-nominated scores to ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) and ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970).  Both the director and composer shared the belief that film music should be used economically; they wanted the music as commentary only in sequences where it can emphasize the psychological aspects of the film. In ''Papillon,'' the film is two and a half hours long, but has 40 minutes with music.\n\nGoldsmith's compositions, characterized by a late romantic symphonic and impressionistic style suffused with a metered, exotic timbre (using instruments from [[Caribbean]] folk music), are distributed mainly in the second half of the film. They generally accompany scenes outside the prison, during the various escape attempts by the protagonist. He used a delicate melodic approach, dominated by a very catchy theme expressed as a [[waltz]], which was often played by an [[accordion]]. This instrument was associated with the French origin of the protagonists. The theme became famous with the popularity of the film, and it was released in many performance variations by different record companies.\n\nThe score was partially produced on vinyl in 1973 and reissued over the years. In the 21st century, an edition was produced on CD by Universal Records France. For the first time, this has the complete version of music from the film (it includes about five minutes of previously unreleased tracks). The DVD version of the English-language version of the film includes an option to listen to Goldsmith's music as an isolated audio track.\n\nGoldsmith had his sixth [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for this soundtrack. It was one of the [[American Film Institute]]'s 250 nominated soundtracks for the [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores|top 25 American film scores]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/scores250.pdf?docID=221|title=''AFI's 100 Years Of Film Scores''|access-date=2011-01-29|archive-date=2011-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071543/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/scores250.pdf?docID=221|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film was a commercial success and grossed $3,126,574 in its opening week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Papillon 1st Week $3,126,574|date=January 2, 1974|page=8}}</ref> It earned theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada of $21.3 million.<ref>\"All-time Film Rental Champs\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p 20</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]]'s review at the time of the film's original release was two-out-of-four stars; he said that the main flaw was a failure to gain audience interest in McQueen's and Hoffman's characters: \"You know something has gone wrong when you want the hero to escape simply so that the movie can be over.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19731216/REVIEWS/301010324/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Papillon Movie Review & Film Summary (1973) | date=16 December 1973 | access-date=28 April 2021 | archive-date=12 October 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012013723/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19731216%2FREVIEWS%2F301010324%2F1023 | url-status=live }}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a big, brave, stouthearted, sometimes romantic, sometimes silly melodrama with the kind of visual sweep you don't often find in movies anymore.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (December 17, 1973). \"The Screen: 'Papillon'\".
