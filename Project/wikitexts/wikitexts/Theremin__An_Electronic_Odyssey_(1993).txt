Martin]] about the life of [[Leon Theremin]] and his invention, the [[theremin]], a pioneering [[electronic musical instrument]]. It follows his life, including being imprisoned in a Soviet [[Gulag]], and the influence of his instrument, which came to define the sound of eerie in 20th-century movies, and influenced popular music as it searched for and celebrated electronic music in the 1960s.\n\n==Reception==\n''Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey'' won the [[List of Sundance Film Festival award winners#1994|Documentary Filmmakers Trophy]] at the 1994 [[Sundance Film Festival]].  It was also nominated for an International Emmy as well as a BAFTA, the Huw Wheldon Award for the Best Arts Programme, one of the [[British Academy Television Awards]].  ''Theremin'' was named to the Top Ten Films of the Year lists in Los Angeles, Boston, and Washington DC, and was invited to almost every important film festival in the world, including The New York Film Festival, set a record for the longest question and answer period at the National Gallery in Washington, and was shown by invitation of the Russian Ministry of Culture to top scientists in St. Petersburg.\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'' called the film a \"fascinating, offbeat documentary that stands as a fine job of detective work\".<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE4DA1439F932A35753C1A962958260 Film Festival Review: The Strangest Instrument and Its Even Stranger Inventor], an October 1994 review from ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\nIn a December 1995 review, [[Roger Ebert]] wrote:<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19951215/REVIEWS/512150305/1023 December 1995 review of ''Theremin''] from [[Roger Ebert]].</ref>\n:Watching ''Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey'' is a curious experience. You begin with interest, and then you pass through the stages of curiosity, fascination and disbelief, until in the last 20 minutes, you arrive at a state of dumbfounded wonder.  It is the kind of movie that requires a musical score only the Theremin possibly could supply.\n\n==Home Media==\n''Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey'' was released on DVD by MGM Home Video on April 1, 2003.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Moog (film)|Moog]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0108323}}\n*[http://www.mrqe.com/lookup?Theremin List of reviews of ''Theremin''] from the [[Movie Review Query Engine]]\n\n[[Category:Biographical documentary films]]\n[[Category:1993 films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about electronic music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about musical instruments]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Theremins]]\n[[Category:L\u00e9on Theremin]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
