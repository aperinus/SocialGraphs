Set on board a train traveling through the [[Rocky Mountains]] from [[Denver]] to [[Los Angeles]], it is the sequel to the 1992 film ''[[Under Siege]]'' also starring Seagal.<ref>{{cite news|title= FILM REVIEW; All Aboard for Cataclysm And Just Forget the Bar Car|newspaper= The New York Times|date=1995-07-15|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/15/movies/film-review-all-aboard-for-cataclysm-and-just-forget-the-bar-car.html|access-date=2010-09-10|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref>  The title refers to the [[railroading]] term that the subject train was travelling through [[dark territory]], a section of railroad track that has no [[block signals|train signals]] and in which communications between [[train dispatcher]]s and the [[railroad engineer]]s were impossible.\n\nThe film was produced by Seagal along with [[Arnon Milchan]] and Steve Perry.<ref>{{cite news|title= Steven Seagal, Please Call Your Accountant |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-09-25|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-25/entertainment/ca-42934_1_steven-seagal|access-date=2010-11-25|first=Judy|last=Brennan}}</ref> The film's cast also included [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Everett McGill]], [[Morris Chestnut]], [[Peter Greene]], [[Kurtwood Smith]] and [[Katherine Heigl]]. In addition to Seagal, [[Nick Mancuso]], [[Andy Romano]], and [[Dale Dye]] also reprised their roles from the first film.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing his retirement from the United States Navy, Casey Ryback settles in [[Denver, Colorado]], where he starts and runs a restaurant business. When her receives news of the death of his estranged brother, James Ryback, in a plane crash, Casey meets James's daughter, Sarah, whom he will accompany to Los Angeles to attend his funeral. The two board the Grand Continental, a train traveling through the Rocky Mountains from Denver to Los Angeles. On board, they befriend a steward/porter named Bobby Zachs and the train's chefs.\n\nAs the train reaches the Rocky Mountains, a group of terrorists flag it down and murder the engineer and brakeman. The group, led by former U.S. government employee and computer genius Travis Dane and his second-in-command Marcus Penn, cuts the train phone lines and takes passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one terrorist, then slips away. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top secret military satellite [[tectonic weapon]] for underground targets. The military fired Dane, who later faked his suicide.\n\nDane threatens two former [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] colleagues with burning needles in their eyes unless they reveal codes to take over Grazer. Despite their disclosures, after the codes are confirmed to work, they are thrown from the train over a deep valley.\n\nMiddle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane $1 billion to destroy the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese biological weapons facility that was passing itself off as a fertilizer production plant. After one investor offers an additional $100 million, despite the weapon's primary intention for subterranean targets, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife.\n\nThe U.S. government has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's best intelligence satellite was destroyed. As long as the train keeps moving, his location cannot be determined.\n\nWith Zachs' help, Casey takes matters into his own hands. He faxes a message to the owner of the Mile High Cafe, who relays the word to Admiral Bates. Bates quickly understands that Dane and the terrorists are on the train, and reluctantly approves a mission by two [[F-117]] stealth bombers to destroy the train.\n\nZachs discovers that they are on the wrong tracks and are on a collision course with a [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] bulk freight train carrying gasoline tank cars. Casey kills the mercenaries one by one and releases the hostages, but Dane uses his computer skills to find the Stealth bombers and re-target Grazer to knock them out before they complete their mission. Aware of Casey's past, Penn uses Sarah as a bait to lure him to a fight, but Casey gains the upper hand and fatally breaks his neck.\n\nCasey finds Dane about to depart in a chopper hovering over the train. When Dane informs Casey that there is no way to stop the satellite from destroying Washington, Casey shoots him. The bullet destroys his computer and injures Dane, who falls out of a window of the train. Control of the satellite is restored at the Pentagon and it is destroyed by remote control one second before it would have fired on the Pentagon, just before the two trains collide.\n\nThe crash happens on a trestle, resulting in an explosion that destroys the bridge and kills Scotty, the mercenary driving the train. Casey races through the exploding train, and grabs a rope ladder hanging from the chopper. Dane, who survived the gunshot and the crash, also catches onto the ladder. He attempts to climb onto the helicopter, screaming that he and Casey should join forces. Casey shuts the door, severing Dane's fingers and the latter falls to his death.\n\nCasey informs the Pentagon that the passengers are safe, having previously detached the last two cars from the rest of the train. Later on, Sarah and Casey pay their final respects at James' gravestone.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Lieutenant [[Casey Ryback]], a former [[Navy SEAL]] who now heads and manages a restaurant in Denver\n* [[Eric Bogosian]] as Travis Dane, a crazed computer genius, cyberterrorist leader who designed the Grazer One satellite weapon for the US government before being dismissed for his mental instability\n* [[Everett McGill]] as Marcus Penn, the mercenary commander & Dane's second-in-command who leads a team of mercenaries to hijack the Grand Continental train to set up the satellite equipment\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as  Sarah Ryback, Casey's estranged niece whom he accompanies on the journey to her father's funeral\n* [[Morris Chestnut]] as Bobby Zachs, an eager porter of the train who reluctantly helps Ryback with the hijacked train\n* [[Nick Mancuso]] as Tom Breaker, the shady CIA director who assists ATAC on Grazer One\n* [[Brenda Bakke]] as Captain Linda Gilder, a member of ATAC and one of Dane's former colleagues\n* [[Peter Greene]] as Mercenary #1, Penn's lieutenant who was once instructed by Ryback at [[Fort Bragg]]\n* [[Patrick Kilpatrick]] as Mercenary #2, One of Penn's mercenaries \n* [[Scott Sowers]] as Mercenary #3, One of Penn's mercenaries \n* Afifi Alaouie as Fatima, the sole female of Penn's mercenaries\n* [[Andy Romano]] as Admiral Bates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n* [[Dale Dye]] as Captain Nick Garza, Admiral Bates' right-hand man\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Major General Stanley Cooper, an Air Force general who commands ATAC and Dane's former boss\n* David Gianopoulos as Captain David Trilling, a member of ATAC and one of Dane's former colleagues\n* Sandra Taylor as Kelly, a barmaid on board the train\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Scotty, the mercenary driver under the orders of Penn to drive the locomotive of the Grand Continental train\n* [[Royce D.

Reeves later said, \"There was a big action spec market, a lot of movies that were selling, and so we wrote this movie with my thought being, \u2018And then I will be able to finance my student film and that way I can become a director\u2019.\"<ref name=\"matt\"/>\n\nThe script was called ''Dark Territory'' at one stage and ''End of the Line'' at another. When they finished writing it \"the spec market crashed and it didn't sell.\" But the script was optioned by Warner Brothers, who decided to turn the film into a sequel to ''Under Siege''.<ref name=\"matt\">{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/matt-reeves-dawn-planet-apes/|website=Empire|title=Director Matt Reeves Spills Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes Secrets|date=21 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nReeves said the film was originally \"meant to be very much like a ''[[Die Hard]]'' movie, which I guess ''Under Siege'' really was too, except the difference was that in the ''Under Siege'' movies that tension is how soon before Seagal will rip out someone's larynx. And what I love about ''Die Hard'' was this idea of the underdog, that here's this guy, especially in that first movie, who's a cop from New York who doesn't even have shoes. And somehow he has got to save this building, save the day. That was what that movie was supposed to be, but it didn't end up being that.\"<ref name=\"matt\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nAccording to [[Morris Chestnut]] Seagal rewrote many of the scenes he was in. \"The only time they really stuck to the script or had ad libs was the stuff when he really wasn't there. It was a lot of stuff, because at that time I think he was flying a helicopter, he was doing something... He would come to set, \"Okay, you're gonna say this. I'm gonna say this and this is gonna happen and then you do that.\" That's how we did a lot of that movie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/site/750069-exclusive-interview-morris-chestnut-legends-siege-2#9BOZeTCMp4EYbzwK.99|website=Craveonline|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: MORRIS CHESTNUT ON 'LEGENDS' AND UNDER SIEGE 2|first=Fred|last= Topel|date=August 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPart of the film was shot in Chatsworth's Stony Point Park.
