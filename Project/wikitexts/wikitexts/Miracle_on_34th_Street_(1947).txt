It stars [[Maureen O'Hara]], [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], [[Natalie Wood]], and [[Edmund Gwenn]]. The story takes place between [[Thanksgiving Day]] and [[Christmas Day]] in [[New York City]], and focuses on the effect of a department store [[Santa Claus]] who claims to be the real Santa. The film has become a perennial Christmas favorite.\n\n''Miracle on 34th Street'' won three [[Academy Awards]]: Gwenn for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], Valentine Davies for [[Academy Award for Best Story|Best Writing, Original Story]], and George Seaton for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay]]. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], losing to ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]''. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". The [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''Miracle on 34th Street'' in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| title=Preserved Projects| url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=miracle+on+34th+street&filmmaker=&category=All&collection=All| website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\nDavies also wrote a [[Miracle on 34th Street (novella)|short novelization]] of the tale, which was published by [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt Brace]] simultaneously with the film's release.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]] is indignant to find that the man assigned to play Santa in the annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] is intoxicated. When he complains to event director Doris Walker, she persuades Kris to take his place. He does so well that he is hired to play Santa at [[Macy's Herald Square|Macy's New York City store]] on [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]].\n\nIgnoring instructions from the toy department head, Mr. Shellhammer, to recommend overstocked items to undecided shoppers, Kris directs one woman to another store to fulfill her son's Christmas request. Impressed by Kris's honesty and helpfulness, she informs Shellhammer that she will now become a loyal Macy's customer.\n\nAttorney Fred Gailey, Doris's neighbor, takes the young divorc\u00e9e's daughter Susan to see Santa. Doris has raised her to not believe in fairy tales, but Susan is shaken after seeing Kris speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] with a girl who does not know English. Doris asks Kringle to tell Susan that he is not Santa, but he insists that he is.\n\nWorried, Doris decides to fire him, but Kris has generated so much positive publicity and goodwill that [[Rowland Hussey Macy|the store\u2019s owner]] promises bonuses. To alleviate Doris's misgivings, Granville Sawyer is asked to administer a \"psychological evaluation\" and recommends Kris\u2019 dismissal. Meanwhile Susan shows Kris a magazine photo of her dream house and tells him she wants it for Christmas; reluctantly he promises to do his best.\n\nIn the company cafeteria, young employee Alfred tells Kris that Sawyer convinced him that he is unstable simply because he is kind-hearted. Kris immediately goes to confront Sawyer, eventually striking him on the head with an umbrella. Sawyer exaggerates his pain to have Kris confined to [[Bellevue Hospital]]. Tricked into cooperating, and believing Doris to be in on the deception, Kris deliberately fails his examination and is recommended for permanent commitment. However, Fred persuades Kris not to give up.\n\nAt a hearing before Judge Henry X. Harper, [[District attorney|District Attorney]] Thomas Mara gets Kris to assert that he is Santa Claus and rests his case, asking Harper to rule that Santa does not exist. In private, Harper's political adviser, Charlie Halloran, warns him that doing so would be disastrous for his upcoming reelection bid. Harper buys time by hearing further evidence.\n\nFred calls Macy as a witness and persuades him to admit that he does believe in Santa. On leaving the stand, Macy fires Sawyer. Next, Fred calls Mara's own young son, who testifies that his father told him that Santa was real. Mara has to concede the point, but goes on to demand that Fred prove that Kris is \"the one and only\" Santa Claus on the basis of some [[competent authority]] by the following day.\n\nMeanwhile, Susan writes Kris a letter to cheer him up, which Doris also signs. When a New York Post Office mail sorter sees Susan's letter, which is addressed to Kris at the New York courthouse, he suggests delivering all of the [[Dead letter mail|dead letters]] addressed to Santa Claus to Kris. As court resumes, Fred is told of the delivery of mailbags to the courthouse; he argues that the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]]\u2014a branch of the U.S. federal government\u2014has acknowledged that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus by delivering the letters. When the judge insists on seeing them, Fred has them dump bag after bag on Harper's desk. Half concealed behind them, Harper dismisses the case.\n\nOn Christmas morning, Susan loses faith in Kris when he admits he was not able to get her the house she wanted. However, after Kris offers Fred and Doris a route home that avoids traffic, Susan sees her dream house with a \"For Sale\" sign in front. Demanding that Fred stop the car, she joyfully runs into the house, exclaiming \"Mr. Kringle IS Santa Claus!\" Fred learns that Doris had encouraged Susan to have faith and suggests they purchase the house. He then boasts that he must be a great lawyer since he proved an eccentric old man was Santa. However, when he and Doris spot a cane in the house that looks just like Kris's, he is not so sure.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Maureen O'Hara]] as Doris Walker\n* [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]] as Fred Gailey\n* [[Edmund Gwenn]] as [[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]]\n* [[Gene Lockhart]] as the Hon.

The 1994 film also added a subtext which described concerns about religious faith.\n\n==In other media==\nThere are numerous remakes of the movie, as well as a Broadway musical.\n\n===Radio===\n''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'' aired a one-hour adaptation of the movie on three occasions: on December 22, 1947, which starred the original cast including Natalie Wood;<ref name=\"Vindicator1\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=II1IAAAAIBAJ&pg=6274%2C2781954&q=Miracle+34th+Street+Payne+Natalie+Wood+Edmund+Gwenn+Theater |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Arion Chorus Sings at 10; Yule Music Dominates Air |page=15 |newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator (Ohio) |date=1947-12-22 |access-date=2021-06-01}}</ref> on December 20, 1948, without Natalie Wood's participation;<ref name=Deseret>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PaVTAAAAIBAJ&pg=4429%2C5302203&q=Miracle+34th+st+Lux+Theater+Edmund+Gwenn+Owen |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=MIRACLE ON 34TH ST. on Lux Theatre Tonite (KSL advertisement) |page=F-2 |newspaper=The Deseret News |date=1948-12-20 |access-date=2021-06-01 }}</ref> and on December 21, 1954.<ref name=\"Vindicator2\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h4E_AAAAIBAJ&pg=1018%2C2031914&q=Edmund+stars+Miracle+34th+story+department+store+Santa+Theatre |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Radio Tonight |page=39 |newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator (Ohio) |date=1954-12-21 |access-date=2021-06-01}}</ref> There were also two broadcasts on ''[[Screen Directors Playhouse]]'': as a half-hour play on December 23, 1949;<ref name=\"Toledo1\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=muROAAAAIBAJ&pg=3807%2C3429504&q=Screen+Directors+Playhouse+Miracle+31th+St. |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Friday Selections |page=4 (Peach Section) |newspaper=Toledo Blade (Ohio) |date=1949-12-23 |access-date=2021-06-01 }}</ref> and then as a one-hour play on December 21, 1950.<ref name=\"Toledo2\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mmFOAAAAIBAJ&pg=2741%2C3103718&q=Screen+Direc+Directors+Play+Playhouse+Miracle+34th+Street |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Thursday Selections |page=4 (Peach Section) |newspaper=Toledo Blade (Ohio) |date=1950-12-21 |access-date=2021-06-01 }}</ref> All of these adaptations had Edmund Gwenn reprising his screen role.\n\n===Theatre===\nA 1963 Broadway musical version, entitled ''[[Here's Love]]'', was written by [[Meredith Willson]].\n\nThe novella was adapted into a stage play by Will Severin, Patricia Di Benedetto Snyder and John Vreeke in 2000.

This version did not show the drunken Santa at all. Titled ''[[The Miracle on 34th Street (The 20th Century Fox Hour)|The Miracle on 34th Street]]'', it originally aired as an episode of ''[[The 20th Century Fox Hour]]''. It was later re-run as \"Meet Mr. Kringle\".\n\n[[Ed Wynn]] played Kris in a [[Miracle on 34th Street (NBC Friday Night Special Presentation)|1959 television adaptation]] of the movie. Also featured was [[Orson Bean]]. It was broadcast live and in color on [[NBC]] the day after Thanksgiving. NBC made a [[kinescope]] of the program, probably for broadcasting opening night on the West Coast. The copy was in a large collection of kinescopes donated by NBC to the [[Library of Congress]] and later unearthed by Richard Finegan, who reported his experiences in the December 2005 issue of ''Classic Images''.\n\nA [[Miracle on 34th Street (1973 film)|1973 television version]] featured [[Jane Alexander]], [[David Hartman (TV personality)|David Hartman]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]] as Kris (without his natural beard; he was forced to shave and wear a false beard for the role), Suzanne Davidson, [[Jim Backus]], [[David Doyle (actor)|David Doyle]] and [[Tom Bosley]]. It was adapted by Jeb Rosebrook from the George Seaton screenplay, and directed by [[Fielder Cook]]. Mrs. Walker's first name is changed to Karen in this version. This would prove to be the final version in which the department store was actually Macy's. David Doyle, who played R. H. Macy in this version, had played Mr. Sawyer in the original Broadway cast of ''Here's Love'' 10 years earlier.\n\n===Puppets===\nIn 2012, the flagship [[Macy's Herald Square|Macy's Department Store at Herald Square]] in New York City featured a 30-minute puppet version of the story within its Santaland display, featuring the voice talents of Broadway stars [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]] and [[Victoria Clark]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Miracle on 34th Street at Macy's Puppet Theatre |url=https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/miracle-on-34th-street-at-macys-puppet-theatre |website=TimeOut |publisher=TimeOut |access-date=25 December 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Appearances===\nA short clip of the film was seen on the kitchen television screen in ''[[Home Alone]]'' (a 1990 Christmas film released by Fox) and also the ending was seen in the den television screen in the 1996 film ''[[The Preacher's Wife]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Trial film]]\n* [[List of Christmas films]]\n* [[Santa Claus in film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category|Miracle on 34th Street (film)}}\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|En-Miracle_on_34th_Street-article.ogg|date=2017-03-26}}\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/MiracleOn34thSt/ Backstage and deleted scenes]\n* {{IMDb title}}\n* {{AllMovie title}}\n* {{TCMDb title}}\n* {{AFI film}}\n\n'''Streaming audio'''\n* [https://archive.org/7/items/Lux_Fills_and_Upgrades/Lux-471222-correct-596td-Miracleon34ThStreet-MOHaraEGwennJPNW.mp3 ''Miracle on 34th Street'']{{cbignore}} on [[Lux Radio Theater]]: December 22, 1947\n* [https://archive.org/31/items/ScreenDirectorsPlayhouse/SDP_49-12-23_ep048-Miracle_on_34th_Street.mp3 ''Miracle on 34th Street'']{{cbignore}} on [[Screen Directors Playhouse]]: December 23, 1949\n* [https://archive.org/31/items/ScreenDirectorsPlayhouse/SDP_50-12-21_ep082-Miracle_on_34th_Street.mp3 ''Miracle on 34th Street'']{{cbignore}} on [[Screen Directors Playhouse]]: December 21, 1950\n* [https://archive.org/6/items/Lux19/Lux-541221-correct-47m52s-903hrt-Miracleon34thStreet-EGwennVGregg.mp3 ''Miracle on 34th Street'']{{cbignore}} on [[Lux Radio Theater]]: December 21, 1954\n\n{{Miracle on 34th Street}}\n{{George Seaton}}\n{{MacysInc}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miracle On 34th Street}}\n[[Category:Miracle on 34th Street| ]]\n[[Category:1947 films]]\n[[Category:1940s Christmas comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1940s fantasy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American Christmas comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American courtroom films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about lawyers]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Seaton]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Cyril J.
