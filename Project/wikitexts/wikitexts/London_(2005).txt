It stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Joy Bryant]], [[Kelli Garner]], and [[Isla Fisher]].\n\n==Plot==\nSyd ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]) receives a phone call from a friend informing him that his ex-girlfriend London ([[Jessica Biel]]) is having a going-away party before she moves to [[California]] with her new boyfriend in a few days. Syd, who has been deeply depressed since London dumped him, flies into a rage upon hearing the news, and wrecks his apartment. He decides to go to the party uninvited, bringing along Bateman ([[Jason Statham]]), a banker who delivers [[cocaine]] to Syd as a favor to their mutual dealer.\n\nAfter arriving at the party at the condominium belonging to the parents of club girl Rebecca ([[Isla Fisher]]), Bateman and Syd install themselves in the bathroom, where they snort line after line of [[cocaine]], guzzle [[tequila]] and discuss love, sex, God, women and pain. Over the course of the night and a massive pile of blow, Bateman tells Syd to get on with his life.\n\nThe private party-within-a-party is soon joined by Maya ([[Kelli Garner]]) and Mallory ([[Joy Bryant]]), who feign sympathy for Syd to grab some free cocaine. When Syd learns that London has arrived, Bateman challenges him to go out and talk to her.\n\nAfter a heated confrontation in the middle of the party, Syd and London decide to leave to talk somewhere more private. As they are leaving, a fight ensues in which Syd and Bateman fight the other male guests, barely making it out of the party. London and Syd make up in Syd's car, and later they have sex in London's apartment. In the last scene, at the airport, Syd tells London he loves her. Although this impresses London, she still leaves him.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jessica Biel]] as London\n*[[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Syd\n*[[Jason Statham]] as Bateman\n*[[Joy Bryant]] as Mallory\n*[[Kelli Garner]] as Maya\n*[[Isla Fisher]] as Rebecca\n*[[Dane Cook]] as George\n*[[Louis C.K.]] as Therapist\n*[[Casey LaBow]] as Dominatrix\n*[[Kat Dennings]] as Lilly\n*[[Antonio Mu\u00f1oz (actor)|Antonio Mu\u00f1oz]] as Killer in a Dream\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = London (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = [[The Crystal Method]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 24, 2006\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Big beat]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Reincarnate Music]]\n| producer   = The Crystal Method\n| prev_title = [[Community Service II]]\n| prev_year  = 2005\n| next_title = [[Drive: Nike + Original Run]]\n| next_year  = 2006\n}}\nAmerican [[electronica]] group [[The Crystal Method]] performed the score for the film.\n\nThe song \"Roboslut\" appears in the North American PlayStation 2 release of ''[[Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova]]'', but is retitled \"Robogirl\" due to censorship.\n\n===Track listing===\nAll songs written and performed by [[The Crystal Method]] except where noted.\n\n# \"London\"\n# \"Restless\" by [[Evil Nine]] featuring Toastie Taylor\n# \"Smoked\" (Vocals by Troy Bonnes)\n# \"Fire to Me\" (vs. Hyper)\n# \"Roboslut\"\n# \"Defective\"\n# \"Vice\"\n# \"Crime\" by Troy Bonnes\n# \"C'mon Children\" by [[The Out Crowd]]\n# \"Onesixteen\"\n# \"Sucker Punch\" by [[Connie Price and the Keystones]]\n# \"Glass Breaker\" (Vocals by [[Charlotte Martin]])\n# \"I Luv U\"\n# \"Nothing Like You and I\" by [[The Perishers (band)|The Perishers]]\n\n==Critical reception==\n''London'' received negative reviews from critics. On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 14% approval rating, based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7 out of 10. The website's consensus reads, \"Hampered by pretension and undermined by unlikable characters, ''London'' proves that the novelty of seeing actors play against type isn't enough to rescue a deeply flawed film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1157247-london|title=London|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=November 3, 2022}}</ref> \n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film one out of four stars, writing, \"Chris Evans and Jason Statham have verbal facility and energy, which enables them to propel this dreck from one end of 92 minutes to the other, and the women in the movie are all perfectly adequate at playing bimbo cokeheads. I have seen all of these actors on better days in better movies, and I may have a novena said for them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/london-2006|title='London' leaves little room for kind words|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=February 9, 2006|access-date=November 3, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0449061|London}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1157247-london|London}}\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:London (2005 film)}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2005 independent films]]\n[[Category:2005 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Destination Films films]]\n[[Category:Films about cocaine]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:2005 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
