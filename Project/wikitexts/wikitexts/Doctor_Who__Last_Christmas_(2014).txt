It is the tenth [[List of Doctor Who Christmas specials|Christmas special]] since the show\u2019s revival in 2005. It was written by [[Steven Moffat]] and directed by [[Paul Wilmshurst]].\n\nIn the special, alien time traveller the [[Twelfth Doctor|Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) is reunited with his companion [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) as they must save a [[North Pole]] science base from creatures called dream crabs that induce dream states whilst killing their victims, with the help of [[Santa Claus]] ([[Nick Frost]]).\n\n\"Last Christmas\" was viewed by 8.28 million in the United Kingdom and received positive reviews from critics, praising its story, acting and film influences.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Doctor Who Symphonic Spectacular (Leeds 2015) (17603045053).jpg|thumb|left|The Dream Crabs, shown here at the Doctor Who Symphonic Spectacular.]]\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] finds [[Santa Claus]] stranded on her roof. [[Twelfth Doctor|The Doctor]] arrives to take Clara away. Santa tells the Doctor that he will need his help before the night is over. The Doctor and Clara arrive at a [[North Pole]] base where four of the crew in the infirmary are being devoured by Dream Crabs \u2013 blind aliens which induce dreams on their intended victims as a distraction whilst devouring the victims' brains and which use telepathy to see the surroundings of people thinking about a crab. More crabs attack the Doctor, Clara, and the unaffected crew, only for Santa to rescue them. Clara reveals that during their last meeting,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the previous episode \"[[Death in Heaven]]\" (2014).}} she lied to the Doctor about Clara's boyfriend [[Danny Pink]] coming back from the dead. The Doctor says that he lied about finding [[Gallifrey]]. The Doctor sends Clara to recover Santa's crab specimen, but Clara, thinking about the crab, makes it come alive and attack her.\n\nClara reunites with Danny in a dream. The Doctor willingly falls victim to another crab to enter the dream. Clara still resists willing herself to wake up, until Danny tells her that she can miss him while also moving on with her life. Clara and the Doctor wake up, which kills the crabs devouring them. The Doctor deduces that they are not awake, but in a different layer of a multi-faceted dream and have been since the initial crab attack. He explains that Santa is the manifestation of their [[subconscious]] minds fighting back. Santa wakes the group up.\n\nClara reminds the Doctor that they met Santa before arriving, proving that everything else has also been a dream and that none of the scientists are scientists. The affected personnel \u2013 manifestations of the Doctor, Clara, and the \"scientists'\" minds \u2013 attack and kill Professor Albert. The Doctor, Clara, and the \"scientists\" dream of Santa, who wakes them up to their real lives, one by one, until only Clara is left.\n\nUpon waking, the Doctor traces the psychic signal linking their dreams back to Clara. He pulls the crab off, and learns that Clara is now an elderly woman. The Doctor regrets not coming back sooner, when Santa appears. Realising that he is still dreaming, the Doctor wakes up again. He frees Clara, now a young adult, from the crab. Offering her all of time and space, the Doctor implores Clara to join him. Clara accepts.\n\n=== Continuity ===\nWhen the Doctor visits the elderly Clara, he helps her open a [[Christmas cracker]], returning the favour she did for the [[Eleventh Doctor]] in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013) when he was too weak to pull a cracker open by himself.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5Q9mCTM7YMLnNttm5p6nykp/last-christmas-fact-file|title=BBC One - Doctor Who, Last Christmas - Last Christmas: Fact File|work=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nIn September 2014 announcements were made for a number of the guest cast, including [[Michael Troughton]], [[Nick Frost]], Nathan McMullen, [[Natalie Gumede]] and [[Faye Marsay]].
