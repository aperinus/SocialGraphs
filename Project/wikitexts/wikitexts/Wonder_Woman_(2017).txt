The project floundered in [[development hell]] for many years; [[Jon Cohen (writer)|Jon Cohen]], [[Todd Alcott]] and [[Joss Whedon]], among others, were also attached to the project at various points. Warner Bros. announced the film in 2010 and Jenkins signed on to direct in 2015. Inspiration for ''Wonder Woman'' was drawn from Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]]'s 1940s stories and [[George P\u00e9rez]]'s 1980s stories about Wonder Woman, as well as [[the New 52]] incarnation of the character. Principal photography began on November 21, 2015, with filming taking place in the United Kingdom, France and Italy before finishing on May 6, 2016, the 123rd anniversary of Marston's birth. Additional filming took place in November 2016.\n\n''Wonder Woman'' had its world premiere in at [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]] in Hollywood on May 26, 2017, and was theatrically released worldwide on June 2, 2017, by [[Warner Bros.

A plot summary for a film article should be 400\u2013700 words and should not go below or exceed the required limit. -->\nIn present-day [[Paris]], [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana Prince]] receives a [[photographic plate]] from [[Wayne Enterprises]] of herself and four men taken during [[World War I]], prompting her to recall her past. The daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], Diana is raised on the hidden island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], home to the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], women warriors created by the Olympian gods to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains their history to Diana, including how [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon, the \"god-killer\", to prepare them for Ares' return. Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let her sister, General [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]], train Diana as a warrior.\n\nIn 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues US pilot Captain [[Steve Trevor]] when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by [[Imperial German Navy|German]] soldiers, who had been pursuing Steve. The Amazons wipe out the German landing force at the expense of heavy losses, with Antiope sacrificing herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the [[Lasso of Truth|Lasso of Hestia]] and reveals that a [[World War I|great war]] is consuming the outside world and that he is an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] spy. He has stolen a notebook from the [[German Empire|Germans']] chief chemist, [[Doctor Poison|Dr. Isabel Maru]], who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of [[mustard gas]] under the orders of General [[Erich Ludendorff]]. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"god-killer\" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.\n\nIn [[London]], they deliver Maru's notebook to the [[Supreme War Council]], where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an [[armistice]] with Germany. Diana translates Maru's notes, revealing that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in [[Belgium in World War I|Belgium]]. Diana goes alone through [[No Man's Land]] and captures the enemy trench, liberating the nearby village of Veld with the aid of the Allied forces. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, where Diana and Steve fall in love.\n\nThe team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German High Command]]. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party; Steve intends to locate the gas and destroy it and Diana hopes to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.\n\nSir Patrick appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence, as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"god-killer\" sword, he destroys it, telling Diana that, as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, she is the \"god-killer\". He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane and himself. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|end of the war]].\n\nIn the present day, Diana sends an email to [[Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)|Bruce Wayne]] thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve. She continues to fight on the world's behalf as Wonder Woman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of DC Extended Universe cast members|Characters of the DC Extended Universe}}\n\n* [[Gal Gadot]] as [[Diana Prince (DC Extended Universe)|Diana Prince / Wonder Woman]]: <br />An immortal [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]] warrior [[demigod]]dess who is the [[crown princess]] of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] and the daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] and [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] given to the Amazons to raise.<ref name=\"WW demigod\"/> Describing Wonder Woman and her appeal, Gadot said \"She's relatable.
