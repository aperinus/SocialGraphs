It was written by [[Shauna Cross]] and [[Heather Hach]] and is based on [[Heidi Murkoff]]'s [[What to Expect When You're Expecting|1984 pregnancy guide of the same name]]. Its story follows the lives of five couples as their lives are turned upside down by the difficulties and surprises of parenthood. It stars [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Chace Crawford]], [[Brooklyn Decker]], [[Ben Falcone]], [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Matthew Morrison]], [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Chris Rock]] and [[Rodrigo Santoro]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Alcon Entertainment]], [[Phoenix Pictures]], What to Expect Productions, and [[Georgia Public Broadcasting|Georgia Public]] and was released on May 18, 2012. It grossed $84 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n\n'''Prologue'''\n\nSet in [[Atlanta]],<ref name=\"Diaz\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cameron-diaz-star-what-expect-185851|title=Cameron Diaz to Star in 'What to Expect When You're Expecting'|last=Kit|first=Borys|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 5, 2011|access-date=July 23, 2011}}</ref> the film opens with TV fitness trainer Jules Baxter and her dance partner Evan Webber performing on the TV show ''Celebrity Dance Factor''. They are crowned the winners of the show, but Jules vomits in their trophy, discovering that she is pregnant.\n\n'''Jules and Evan '''\n\nJules struggles when trying to balance her pregnancy with her normal active life. After being told during the [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]] that she is having a son, she has an ongoing argument with Evan over whether or not to have their son [[circumcision|circumcised]]. During labor, she chooses not to have an [[epidural]]. She gives birth to a daughter they name Emerson, ending their debate. After giving birth, Jules and Evan get engaged.\n\n'''Holly and Alex'''\n\nPhotographer Holly Castillo can't conceive children and decides to adopt one from [[Ethiopia]] with her husband, Alex. They decide to buy a new house for the baby. Holly sends Alex to hang out with the \"dudes group\", a group of fathers who walk around the park and support one another, which was founded by Vic Mac. Alex feels even more nervous to become a father. Holly loses her job and becomes hurt when she realizes how much Alex is unprepared for a child. However, they eventually go to Ethiopia and adopt a baby boy named Kaleb.\n\n'''Wendy and Gary'''\n\nWendy Cooper runs a [[breast feeding]] boutique called The Breast Choice and has been trying to have a baby with her husband Gary for two years. She eventually does conceive and shares the news with Gary after taking five pregnancy tests.  Having planned a magical and happy pregnancy, Wendy feels awful throughout it and, during a convention she was chosen to speak at about the miracle of childbirth, she begins to break down and begins to rant about the problematic process of pregnancy. Her outburst is filmed and becomes a viral hit on [[YouTube]], after which her boutique is flooded with customers. After many labor-inducing activities, she goes to the hospital only to find out she has to have a [[cesarean section]], which is against her birth plan. She suffers severe blood loss, but survives and delivers a son named Theo.\n\n'''Skyler and Ramsey'''\n\nRamsey Cooper, a famous race car driver, and Gary's father, is married to a much younger woman named Skyler, making her Gary's stepmother. She treats Gary as her own son despite her obviously not being his mother, much to Gary's annoyance. During a brunch where Wendy and Gary announce her pregnancy, Ramsey and Skyler also announce they are expecting. Unlike Wendy, Skyler cruises through her pregnancy without issues. Wendy envies her and detests her ease; however, soon after Skyler gives birth to twin girls, she and Ramsey are shown struggling with the fussy babies.\n\n'''Rosie and Marco'''\n\nRosie Brennan, a food-truck chef, meets an old high school friend, Marco, also a food-truck chef, during a turf war between their food trucks. She believes he is a player and initially blows him off, but the reunion leads to an unexpected pregnancy after sex that night. Worried at first, they eventually adjust to the idea of becoming parents and move in together. However, one night Rosie discovers she is bleeding and they drive to the hospital where they discover she has [[Miscarriage|miscarried]]. Devastated, Rosie tells Marco to leave, which he does, but he makes several attempts to get back with her. Eventually, they get back together and decide to take things slowly and their story ends with them joining forces to create a food truck together.\n\n'''Epilogue'''\n\nAt different points in the film, certain characters meet others. Many of the characters are fans of one or both of Jules' two TV series. Gary was on Jules' weight loss program and is a regular customer of Marco's food truck, Skyler is Rosie's cousin, and Holly is Wendy and Skyler's photographer.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Jules Baxter, a contestant on a celebrity dance show and a host to a weight-loss fitness show, who becomes pregnant with her dance partner's baby girl named Emerson<ref name=\"Diaz\"/>\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Holly Castillo, a woman who adopts a baby boy named Kaleb from abroad with her unwilling husband after difficulty conceiving<ref name=\"Lopez\">{{cite news|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/06/24/jennifer-lopez-what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting/|title=Jennifer Lopez signs on for 'What to Expect When You're Expecting'|last=Labrecque|first=Jeff|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 24, 2011|access-date=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Elizabeth Banks]] as Wendy Cooper, Gary's wife and Theo's mother who becomes pregnant after trying for 2 years.
