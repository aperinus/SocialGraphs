The two don't get along with each other\u2014Arlo only agrees to transport the substance in his ice cream truck because Mason held a gun on him\u2014but they find a common bond in trying to avoid Brynner and his team.\n\nWith the help of Colonel Leo Vitelli, Arlo and Mason try to survive Brynner's attacks, avoid the local deputy, Pappas, who's also hot on their trail, and keep \"Elvis\" below fifty degrees.\n\nArlo and Mason finally reach the base, but get ambushed by Brynner and his team who plan on detonating the device in an abandoned weapons test facility. Brynner does not want to leave witnesses, and decides to kill both of them. The military arrives and rescues Arlo and Mason before the device explodes, killing Brynner and his men. Colonel Vitelli arrives and congratulates them on a job well done, but Arlo and Mason threaten to expose the U.S. government for using unstable nuclear weapons for the past decade. Vitelli decides to pay them both to keep them silent, but also threatens to have them killed if they say a word about what had happened. All three of them leave the area in a helicopter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Arlo\n* [[Skeet Ulrich]] as Tim Mason\n* [[Peter Firth]] as Colonel Andrew Brynner\n* [[David Paymer]] as Dr. Richard Long\n* [[Hudson Leick]] as Vaughn\n* [[Daniel Hugh Kelly]] as Colonel Leo Vitelli\n* [[Kevin J.
