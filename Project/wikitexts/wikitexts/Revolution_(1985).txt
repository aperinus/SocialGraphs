The film stars Pacino as a [[Province of New York|New York]] fur trapper who involuntarily gets enrolled in the Revolutionary forces during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n''Revolution'' received a great deal of negative reviews upon release, and was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]]; its release was delayed in Pacino's native [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/BG73K54WN8S1/Worst-of-1986-1987|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412051950/http://siskelandebert.org/video/BG73K54WN8S1/Worst-of-1986-1987|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 April 2013|title=Siskelandebert.org|website=siskelandebert.org|access-date=27 January 2018}}</ref> Due to the disappointment, Pacino took a four-year hiatus from films until 1989's ''[[Sea of Love (film)|Sea of Love]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nFur trapper Tom Dobb reluctantly participates in the American Revolutionary War after his young son Ned joins the Army as a [[Drummer boy (military)|drummer boy]], against his father's wishes. Later, his son is captured by the British, and taken by the strict Sergeant Major Peasy to replace some dead British drummer boys. Dobb attempts to find him, and along the way, becomes convinced that he must help fight for the freedom of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], alongside the disgraced and idealistic aristocrat Daisy McConnahay.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Tom Dobb\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Sgt.

After having just made ''The Right Stuff'' Winkler did not want to tell a story about real people so decided to focus on a fictional father and son. Winkler had a development deal at Warner Bros and they agreed to finance a script by Robert Dillon. Warners did not like the script enough to agree to finance it, so Winkler bought it back, attached [[Hugh Hudson]] as director and took the project to other studios to see if they were interested. He showed the script to [[Sandy Lieberson]] of Goldcrest, who was enthusiastic.<ref>Eberts and Ilott p 346-348</ref>\n\nGoldcrest agreed to finance provided a US studio could be brought in to co produce. Warner Bros agreed.<ref>Eberts and Ilott p 348-350</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by the British company [[Goldcrest Films|Goldcrest]], and was filmed largely in the old dock area of the English port town of [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The main battles scenes were filmed at [[Burrator Reservoir]] on [[Dartmoor]] in [[Devon]] and on the coastal cliff top near [[Challaborough|Challaborough Bay]], South Devon where a wooden fort was built. Military extras were recruited from ex-servicemen mainly from the [[Plymouth]] area. Many other scenes were filmed in the battle training area near [[Thetford]], Norfolk, with extras being recruited from around the King's Lynn area. [[Melton Constable Hall]] in Norfolk was also used for some scenes.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Revolution'' cost $28 million to make, and proved to be a box-office disaster, only grossing $346,761 in the United States.\n\nGoldcrest Films invested \u00a315,603,000 in the film and received \u00a35,987,000, causing them to lose \u00a39,616,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My indecision is final|first1=Jake|last1= Eberts |first2=Terry|last2=Illott|year=1990 |publisher=Faber and Faber|page=657}}</ref>\n\n===Critical===\nThe film was also a critical letdown, with many criticizing the performances (especially the accents), writing, and choice to shoot a story of American history in England. [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s staff commented, \"Watching ''Revolution'' is a little like visiting a museum \u2013 it looks good without really being alive. The film doesn\u2019t tell a story so much as it uses characters to illustrate what the American Revolution has come to mean.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://variety.com/1985/film/reviews/revolution-3-1200426822/ | title=Review: 'Revolution' | date= 31 December 1985 | work=Variety | access-date=6 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nA reviewer for the UK-based ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called it \"an almost inconceivable disaster which tries for a worm's eye view of the American Revolution [...] maybe the original script had a shape and a grasp of events. If so, it has gone. There has clearly been drastic cutting, and nothing is left but a cortege of fragments and mismatched cuts. It's also the first [[70mm|70 mm]] movie that looks as if it was shot hand-held on [[16mm|16 mm]] and blown up for the big screen. Director? I didn't catch the credit. Was there one?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/revolution|title=Revolution|access-date=27 January 2018}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"a mess, but one that's so giddily misguided that it's sometimes a good deal of fun for all of the wrong reasons. Characters who have met briefly early in the film later stage hugely emotional, tearful reconciliations.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990DEED7123BF936A15751C1A963948260&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes | work=The New York Times | first=Vincent | last=Canby | title=The Screen: 1770s Epic, 'Revolution' | date=25 December 1985}}</ref> [[Pauline Kael]] commented that \"everything in this picture, which goes from the beginning of the American War of Independence in 1776 to the end of combat in 1783, seems dissociated. The director, Hugh Hudson, plunges us into gritty, muddy restagings of famous campaigns, but we don't find out what's going on in these campaigns, or what their importance is in the course of the war. [...] Hudson and the scriptwriter, Robert Dillon, present the war as a primal Oedipal revolt of the Colonies against the parent country, and the relationships of the characters are designed in Oedipal pairs; Hudson also stages torture orgies to indicate how sadistic the redcoats are, and scenes are devised to set up echoes of [[Rocky (film series)|the ''Rocky'' series]] and ''[[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]]''. This is a certifiably loony picture; it's so bad it puts you in a state of shock.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/r3.html|title = Pauline Kael}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 10% based on 20 reviews with the consensus: \"Unlikely to inspire any fervor with its miscast ensemble and ponderous script, ''Revolution'' is a star-spangled bummer.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1028715-revolution|title = Revolution}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n''Revolution'' was nominated for four [[Golden Raspberry Awards]]:\n* [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] (lost to ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'')\n* [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] - [[Hugh Hudson]] (lost to [[George Cosmatos]])\n* [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] - [[Al Pacino]] (lost to [[Sylvester Stallone]])\n* [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Musical Score|Worst Musical Score]] - [[John Corigliano]] (lost to [[Vince DiCola]])\n\nThe film won the [[1985 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards|Stinkers Bad Movie Award]] for Worst Picture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1985/1985st.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017164515/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1985/1985st.htm|archive-date=17 October 2006|title=1985 8th Hastings Bad Cinema Society Stinkers Awards|access-date=2 April 2013|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000413191419/http://www.thestinkers.com/1985.html The Stinkers 1985 Ballot]</ref>\n\n==Director's cut==\n''Revolution'' was rush-released in December 1985 for the Christmas market and for [[Academy Award]] consideration. Dissatisfied with the version of the film released to theatres, Hugh Hudson released a new cut, ''Revolution: Revisited'', on [[DVD]] in 2009. This has an added narration by Pacino (recorded for this release) and numerous scenes have been trimmed or deleted outright (running at 115 minutes, the Director's Cut is approximately 10 minutes shorter than the theatrical version). Also included is a conversation with Pacino and Hudson discussing the film being rushed for a U.S. Christmas release, being trashed by the critics, and other issues relating to making and releasing the film.<ref>[http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/43540 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916202014/http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/43540 |date=16 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/22/revolution-al-pacino-hugh-hudson | work=The Guardian | first=Jason | last=Solomons | title=Director Hugh Hudson on the shooting of Revolution with Al Pacino | date=22 March 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe film was also re-released in the UK in 2012 by the [[British Film Institute]] in a [[Blu-ray Disc]]/DVD combo pack.
