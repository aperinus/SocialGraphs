So they set up a stakeout in the Robbersons' home. Hard-nosed, tough-as-nails Jake Stone and his young partner Tony Moore are assigned to the stakeout, but now it's a question of whether Jake can last long enough to capture the bad guys. The Robbersons want to help, and by doing so they drive Jake crazy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Norman Robberson \n* [[Jack Palance]] as Detective Jake Stone \n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Helen Robberson \n* [[Robert Davi]] as Horace Osborn \n* David Barry Gray as Detective Tony Moore \n* [[Jason James Richter]] as Kevin Robberson \n* [[Fay Masterson]] as Cindy Robberson \n* [[Miko Hughes]] as Billy Robberson \n* [[Richard Romanus]] as Fred Lutz \n* Sal Landi as Jerry Callahan\n* Jack Kehler as Caniff\n* [[M. Emmet Walsh]] as Captain Ted Corbett (uncredited)\n\n==Reception==\n''Cops & Robbersons'' received generally negative reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has an approval rating of 14% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 3.4/10.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|cops_and_robbersons|Cops and Robbersons}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, referring to it as \"one more variation on the FOW movie, so called because the plot involves a Fish Out of the Water\". He singled out a scene in which Chase's character smuggles police officers into his home and snatches a cat from his wife, commenting: {{cquote|Funny? Yes? No? [[Lucille Ball]] could pull off moments like that, because you could almost believe she was that desperate, and scatter-brained. [[Desi Arnaz]] could almost be fooled by such a moment, because Lucy always had him confused anyway. But Norman and Helen Robberson? Watching the movie, I knew I was supposed to laugh, but all I could think of was: what did the people making the movie think about this scene while they were filming it? Anything?<ref>{{cite news  |date= 1994-04-15 |author= Roger Ebert |author-link= Roger Ebert |title= Cops And Robbersons |publisher= [[Chicago Sun Times]] |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cops-and-robbersons-1994 |access-date= 2020-06-04 }}</ref>}}\n\nCommented Richard Harrington of ''[[The Washington Post]]'': {{cquote|Chevy Chase is lucky \"Cops and Robbersons\" isn't a sitcom. If it were, it would be canceled as pronto as [[The Chevy Chase Show|his talk show]] was. The fault is not just Chase's\u2014the plot in this \"[[Stakeout (1987 film)|Stakeout]]\" clone is a sack of woe\u2014but much of the responsibility is. Someone wrongly advised Chase that it's enough to be the lovably klutzy Chevy, that no acting or effort is necessary. As a result, Norman Robberson is another in a too-long list of overly sedated Chase characters that are nothing to laugh about, or at. That's a serious problem for a comedy.<ref>{{cite news |date= 1994-04-15 |title= Cops And Robbersons |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/copsandrobbersonspgharrington_a0abc2.htm |access-date= 2012-06-04 }}</ref>}}\n\nChris Hicks of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' opined that \"Norman is the most ridiculous sitcom husband and father to grace the big screen since . . . well, since [[Clark Griswold]], of the \"[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]\" [[Vacation film series|pictures]]. And since both Norman and Clark are played by Chevy Chase, why not? They're both dumb and clumsy and have dysfunctional families, and they both pretend that everything's OK. But where the \"Vacation\" pictures had some satiric bite to offset the silliness\u2014well, the first one did\u2014\"Cops and Robbersons\" is just stupid. Loaded with ill-timed pratfalls and dopey physical shtick, it's movies like this that give slapstick a bad name.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Cops And Robbersons |publisher= [[Deseret News]] |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000369/Cops-and-Robbersons.html |access-date= 2012-06-04 }}</ref>\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' lamented that the film was \"even more unfunny than his disastrous talk show\", calling it \"a Chase vehicle with four flat tires\"<ref>{{cite news |date= 1994-04-15 |first= Janet |last= Maslin |author-link= Janet Maslin |title= Reviews/ Film; Chevy Chase, Wishing for Danger |work= [[The New York Times]] |url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9405E7DE1F3EF936A25757C0A962958260&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes |access-date=2012-06-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Year-end lists===\n* Top 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked)&nbsp;\u2013 Mike Mayo, ''[[The Roanoke Times]]''<ref>{{cite news|last=Mayo|first=Mike|date=December 30, 1994|title=The Hits and Misses at the Movies in '94|newspaper=The Roanoke Times|page=1|edition=Metro}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted poorly at the box office, earning $3.7 million and coming in second place behind ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : Hey, Chevy, the British Are Coming|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-04-19|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-19/entertainment/ca-47830_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=2012-06-03|first=Terry|last=Pristin}}</ref> The film grossed just $11,391,093 in the domestic box office from an unknown budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{mojo title|copsandrobbersons|Cops and Robbersons}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0109480|Cops & Robbersons}}\n* {{allrovi movie|131151|Cops & Robbersons}}\n* {{mojo title|copsandrobbersons|Cops & Robbersons}}\n\n{{Michael Ritchie}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cops And Robbersons}}\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American buddy cop films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Ritchie]]\n[[Category:1990s police comedy films]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by William Ross]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy cop films]]\n[[Category:1994 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-comedy-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
