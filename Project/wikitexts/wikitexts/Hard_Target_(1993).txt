The film stars [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Chance Boudreaux, an out-of-work homeless [[Cajun]] merchant seaman and former [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|United States Force Recon Marine]] who saves a young woman named Natasha Binder ([[Yancy Butler]]) from a gang of thugs in [[New Orleans]]. Chance learns that Binder is searching for her missing father ([[Chuck Pfarrer]]), and agrees to aid Binder in her search. They soon learn that Binder's father has died at the hands of hunt organisers Emil Fouchon ([[Lance Henriksen]]) and Pik van Cleef ([[Arnold Vosloo]]), a pair of a ruthless businessman and his right-hand mercenary, who arrange the hunting of homeless men as a form of recreational sport. The screenplay was written by Pfarrer and is based on the [[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|1932 film adaptation]] of [[Richard Connell]]'s 1924 short story \"[[The Most Dangerous Game]]\".\n\n''Hard Target'' was Woo's first U.S. film and was also the first major Hollywood film made by a Chinese director. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] was nervous about having Woo direct a feature and sent in director [[Sam Raimi]] to look over the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly [[martial arts film]]s with which he was not interested. After deciding on Pfarrer's script for ''Hard Target'', Woo wanted to have actor [[Kurt Russell]] in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Van Damme star. Woo got along with Van Damme during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that the actor was up for it.\n\nAfter 65 days of filming in New Orleans, Woo had trouble with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] to secure the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]] that Universal wanted. Woo made dozens of cuts to the film until the MPAA allowed it an R rating. On its initial release, ''Hard Target'' received mixed reviews from film critics<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\">{{cite web|title=Hard Target (1993)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hard_target/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref> but was a financial success. The film is considered a cult film among fans and critics especially for the action scenes. It is seen by many as one of Van Damme's best.<ref name=\"Keeley\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/hard-target-john-woo-clashing-jean-claude-van-damme-1137208 |title='Hard Target' at 25: John Woo on Fighting for Respect in Hollywood |first=Pete |last=Keeley |date=August 24, 2018 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/08/the-must-see-action-movies-from-the-stars-of-the-expendables-2/dolph-lundgren |title=The must-see action movies from the stars of \"The Expendables 2\" Dolph Lundgren |website=Complex}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/06/hard-target-jean-claude-van-damme-issues-a-roundhouse-kick-to-class-privilege|title=Hard Target: Jean-Claude van Damme issues a roundhouse kick to class privilege|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=6 April 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://collider.com/best-jean-claude-van-damme-movies-bloodsport-expendables-2/ | title=From 'Bloodsport' to 'Expendables 2': The Best of Jean-Claude van Damme | website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] | date=27 June 2022 }}</ref>\n\nA sequel, ''[[Hard Target 2]]'', was released 23 years later on September 6, 2016.<ref name=\"KCEN TV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kcentv.com/story/32229546/scott-adkins-stars-as-a-disgraced-martial-arts-champion-fighting-for-survival-in-this-thrilling-sequel-hard-target-2 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20160625171359/http://www.kcentv.com/story/32229546/scott-adkins-stars-as-a-disgraced-martial-arts-champion-fighting-for-survival-in-this-thrilling-sequel-hard-target-2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 25, 2016 |title=Scott Adkins Stars As A Disgraced Martial Arts Champion Fighting For Survival In This Thrilling Sequel: Hard Target 2 |publisher=KCEN TV |date=June 15, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn New Orleans, a homeless United States Force Recon Marine and a Vietnam War veteran named Douglas Binder is the target of a hunt. He is given a belt containing $10,000 and told that he must reach the other side of the town to win the money and his life. Pursuing him is the hunt organizer and wealthy sportsman, Emil Fouchon, his lead right-hand mercenary Pik van Cleef, a businessman named Mr. Lopacki - Fouchon's client who has paid $500,000 for the opportunity to hunt a human, and assassins including Stephan and Peterson. Binder fails to reach his destination and is killed by three [[crossbow]] bolts. Van Cleef retrieves the money belt.\n\nWhile searching for her father, Binder's estranged daughter Natasha is attacked by a group of muggers are punks who saw that she had a lot of cash earlier and attempt rape her. She is saved by a homeless man with exceptional martial arts skills named Chance Boudreaux, a former [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Marine and a sailor, now currently out-of-work. Boudreaux is initially hesitant to involve himself in her mission, but as his merchant seaman union dues are in arrears, he reluctantly allows Natasha to hire him as her guide and bodyguard during her search.\n\nNatasha discovers that her father distributed fliers for a seedy recruiter named Randal Poe who has been secretly supplying Fouchon with homeless men with war experience and no family ties. Natasha questions Randal about her father's death, but they are discovered by an eavesdropping Van Cleef. Fouchon and Van Cleef beat Poe and cut his ear as a punishment for sending them a man with a daughter. New Orleans police detective Marie \"May\" Mitchell is reluctant to investigate Binder's disappearance until his charred body is discovered in the ashes of a derelict building. The death is deemed an accident, but Boudreaux searches the ruins and finds Binder's dog tag, which was pierced by one of the crossbow bolts. Van Cleef's henchmen suddenly ambush Boudreaux and beat him unconscious to scare him and Natasha out of town. When he recovers, he offers Mitchell the dog tag as evidence that Binder was murdered. With the investigation getting closer, Van Cleef and Fouchon decide to relocate their hunting business and begin eliminating \"loose ends\". The medical examiner who had been hiding the evidence of the hunt is executed along with Poe. Meanwhile, Boudreaux's friend, Elijah Roper, who is also homeless and a former United States Force Recon Marine is the next to participate in Fouchon's hunt and also ends up dead. Mitchell, Natasha and Boudreaux arrive moments later at Randal's car and are ambushed by Van Cleef and several of his men. During the shootout, Mitchell is shot in the chest and dies. Boudreaux kills a handful of the mercenaries and escapes with Natasha. Fouchon and Van Cleef assemble their mercenary team and five hired hunters to continue the chase.\n\nBoudreaux leads Natasha to his uncle Clarence Douvee's house deep in the bayou and enlists his help to defeat the men. Boudreaux, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to the \"Mardi Gras graveyard\" (a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues) and kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Boudreaux in a shootout. In the end, only Fouchon is left, but he holds Boudreaux at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with his arrow. Boudreaux charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts in vain to dismantle the grenade but gets incinerated in the explosion.\n\nIt turns out that Douvee is still alive as the arrow Fouchon used only hit Douvee's wine flask. Boudreaux, Natasha, and Douvee make their way out of the warehouse.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Lance Henriksen cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Lance Henriksen]] received a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Emil Fouchon in ''Hard Target''.<ref name=\"saturn\" />]]\n* [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Chance Boudreaux, an out-of-work Cajun [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Force Reconnaissance]] veteran, a merchant seaman, a homeless sailor, and a talented martial artist.

They hired American director [[Sam Raimi]] to oversee the film's production and to have him on standby if Woo was not able to fulfill his role as a director.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=125}} Raimi was very excited to work with Woo as he was a fan of his Hong Kong films. Raimi was also confident in Woo's directorial skills, stating that \"Woo at 70% is still going to blow away most American action directors working at 100%.\"{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=125}}\n\nOn his arrival in the [[United States]], Woo went through several scripts before deciding on ''Hard Target''.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=110}} Describing the scripts he received, Woo stated that \"Some of them were good\u2014some of them were very good\u2014but the rest were simply martial-arts movies and I told producers that I had no interest in doing those kinds of films anymore. I'd done a lot of them already.\"{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=112}} One of the scripts offered to Woo at this period was for ''[[Face/Off]]'', which he turned down at the time, turned off by the [[science fiction film|science fiction]] aspect of the story.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=112}}{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=113}} The script for ''Hard Target'' was written by [[Chuck Pfarrer]].

For a good action film you need a solid structure.

After the script did not turn out Pfarrer worked on a script influenced by the film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' that became the basis for his comic ''[[Virus (comics)|Virus]]''.

''Hard Target'' had 74 days of production time and was shot on location in [[New Orleans]], including sequences shot in the [[French Quarter]].{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=121}}{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=122}}<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> ''Hard Target'' was put on a tight schedule by Universal that allowed only 65&nbsp;days of shooting time. This put a lot of pressure on Woo.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=124}} \nWoo was also pressured by Universal to tone-down the violence and body count that they had seen in his Hong Kong films.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=115}} As Woo had not mastered the English language yet, it took time for the cast and crew to get used to working with him. When Woo could not explain what he wanted with a shot to cinematographer [[Russell Carpenter]], he would resort to simple statements such as \"this will be the [[Sam Peckinpah]] shot\" to get his message across to Carpenter.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=119}} Actor [[Lance Henriksen]] recalled that it was a gradual process that led everyone involved to start seeing the film as a John Woo film rather than a Jean-Claude Van Damme film.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=118}} Producer James Jacks recalled that Woo was not \"the most powerful person on the set but as far as I was concerned, he was certainly the most respected\".{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=118}}\n\nThe weapon fire on the set was considered dangerous, which led the crew to build a new bulletproof plexiglas shield that could be bolted to the camera. This shield was useful particularly for one sequence in ''Hard Target'' where Van Damme empties a magazine of ammo into the camera.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=121}} These [[Camera dolly|camera dollies]] were nicknamed by the crew as \"the Woo-Woo Choo-Choo\".{{sfn|Elder|2005|p=103}} Russell Carpenter found difficulty in filming the huge gunfight scenes. Carpenter specifically noted the [[Mardi Gras]] parade warehouse by recollecting that \"just the lighting for a space like that, with all those strange shapes and shadows was difficult enough, but John then added the further complication of wanting the scene shot from several angles at once\u2014often with more than one of the cameras moving\".{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=122}} Producer James Jacks supported this style of filming finding it the most economical way to shoot these types of action scenes.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=123}}\n\n===Post-production===\nThe film was edited by Bob Murawski on the set using a then state-of-the-art computerized editing unit that allows the user to edit the film as the movie was being shot.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=123}} The film was then scored by [[Graeme Revell]] who employed [[Kodo (taiko group)|Kodo drummers]] from [[Japan]].{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=126}} Woo was contractually obligated to release a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R]] rating by Universal Pictures. When submitting the film to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), it was judged as too violent and intense for an R rating and received an NC-17 rating.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=126}} Woo re-edited the film six times for the MPAA as they never indicated what specific scenes they found objectionable.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=128}}<ref name=\"Harmetz\" /> During this editing period, Van Damme commissioned his own edit of the film. Van Damme's version excises whole characters to insert more scenes and close-ups of his character Chance.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=127}} When asked about this edit, Van Damme replied that \"People pay their money to see me, not to see Lance Henriksen\".{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=128}} The MPAA accepted the film after Woo had made 20 cuts to the film. Scenes cut include the opening chase sequence and the Mardi Gras warehouse sequence.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=128}}{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=129}} A non-action scene cut from the film was a romantic scene between Chance and Natasha.{{sfn|Heard|1999|p=130}}\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Hard Target'' was tentatively scheduled to open in July 1993.{{sfn|Elder|2005|p=109}} ''Hard Target'' was released August 20, 1993 in the United States making it the first film by an Asian director to be released by a Hollywood studio.<ref name=\"Harmetz\">{{cite news |title=Toning Down, John Woo Earns His Hollywood R |first=AlJean |last=Harmetz |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 15, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/movies/film-toning-down-john-woo-earns-his-hollywood-r.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125030319/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/movies/film-toning-down-john-woo-earns-his-hollywood-r.html |archive-date=2014-01-25 |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref name=\"mojoMain\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hardtarget.htm |title=Hard Target (1993)  |access-date=27 July 2009 |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Sandell |first=Jillian |title=Interview with John Woo |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/31/hk_johnwoo.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731122334/http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/31/hk_johnwoo.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 July 2012 |work=[[Bright Lights Film Journal]] |access-date=27 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n''Hard Target'' was the second highest-grossing film release of the week at the American box office on its initial release.
