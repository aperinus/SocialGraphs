The film premiered in New York City on June 10, 2008, and was theatrically released in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]] on June 13. It was panned by critics and grossed $163 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nIn [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], people begin committing [[mass suicide]]. The event is believed to be caused by a [[Bioterrorism|bio-terrorist]] attack using an airborne [[neurotoxin]]. The behavior quickly spreads across the [[Northeastern United States]]. High school science teacher Elliot Moore and his wife Alma are convinced by Elliot's [[mathematician]] colleague Julian to accompany him and his daughter Jess on a train out of [[Philadelphia]]. During the trip, the group learns that [[Boston]] and Philadelphia have been affected. The train loses all radio contact and stops at a small town. When Julian learns that his wife has left Boston for [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], he decides to go look for her and entrusts Jess to the Moores. However, Julian arrives to find Princeton has been affected, causing the driver in the car he is riding in to ram into a tree. He survives but commits suicide by slitting his wrist.\n\nElliot, Alma, and Jess hitch a ride with a [[Plant nursery|nurseryman]] and his wife. The nurseryman theorizes that plant life has developed a defense mechanism against humans consisting of an airborne toxin that stimulates neurotransmitters and causes humans to kill themselves. The group is later joined by other survivors coming from various directions, and the small crowd chooses to avoid roads and populated areas. When the larger part of the group is affected by the toxin, Elliot suggests the nurseryman was right and that the plants are targeting only large groups of people. He splits their group into smaller pockets and they walk along. The trio ends up with a pair of teenage boys, Josh and Jared, who are later shot and killed by the armed residents of a barricaded house.\n\nElliot, Alma and Jess wander the countryside and come upon the home of Mrs. Jones, an eccentric and paranoid elder. Jones initially agrees to house the group for the night but is suspicious of them having bad intentions; the next morning, she decides to expel them. In a fury, she leaves the house alone and is affected by the toxin. The shaken Elliot realizes that the plants are now targeting individuals. Left with no option when Mrs. Jones strikes her head into several windows, the trio chooses to die and embraces in the yard only to find themselves unaffected by the toxin. The outbreak has abated as quickly as it began.\n\nThree months later, Elliot and Alma have adjusted to their new life with Jess as their adopted daughter. Alma learns she is pregnant and surprises Elliot with the news. On television, an expert compares the natural event to a [[red tide]] and warns that the epidemic may have only been a harbinger of an impending global disaster. In [[Paris]]'s [[Tuileries Garden]]s, people begin committing mass suicide.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Elliot Moore\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Alma Moore, Elliot's wife\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Julian\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Mrs. Jones\n* [[Ashlyn Sanchez]] as Jess, Julian's daughter later Elliot & Alma's adoptive daughter\n* [[Frank Collison]] as nursery owner\n* [[Victoria Clark]] as nursery owner\n* [[Spencer Breslin]] as Josh\n* [[Robert Bailey, Jr.]] as Jared\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Private Auster\n* [[M.

Joseph J. Foy, professor of politics and popular culture, describes Shyamalan's film as an expression of \"post-environmentalism\" in which traditional paradigmatic politics are replaced with a call for the world to \"embrace a revolutionary reevaluation of wealth and prosperity not in terms of monetary net worth or material possessions, but in terms of overall well-being\". Foy praises the highly complex narrative in which Shyamalan weaves contemporary environmental challenges with hard science and social theory to create a \"nightmarish future that... may advance the type of dialogue that can truly change the cultural conversation\".<ref>{{cite book | first= Joseph J. | last= Foy | chapter= It Came From Planet Earth: Eco-Horror and the Politics of Postenvironmentalism in M.

Club]]'' said that it was \"Patterned on the B movies of the early atomic age, the best of which could be sophisticated in everything except premise and acting, the movie swaps out radiation for climate change, but otherwise keeps to the template, complete with an ending in which a man in a suit explains everything that happened, but not really.\" He further stated \"Sometimes, it mimics the goofiness of authentic \u201950s B movies; this is one of those cases where the miscasting\u2014namely, Mark Wahlberg as a Philadelphia science teacher who looks and talks like a football coach who\u2019s been forced to sub sex ed\u2014seems at least partly intentional. And yet, even with its non sequitur references to food (tiramisu, hot dogs, \u201clemon drink,\u201d etc.) and its winks of self-parody (e.g., Wahlberg talking to a plastic plant), ''The Happening'' is a movie that a lot of people presume is trying and failing to be taken seriously. And maybe it is.\" He further summarized that \"... in ''The Happening'', everything is premised on the assumption that life is meaningless\u2014a deep anxiety that informs the movie\u2019s abstracted scare scenarios, but is also hidden behind camp. It\u2019s not incoherent, but it\u2019s often hard to read. It\u2019s a genuine curio, not entirely successful, and if you subscribe to the old auteurist line of movies being both expressions and entertainment objects, it\u2019s both too self-consciously silly and too personal to dismiss.\"  <ref>{{cite web |title=Was The Happening supposed to be taken seriously? |first=Ignatiy |last=Vishnevetsky |date=January 1, 2016 |website=The A.V.

Night Shyamalan's ''The Happening'' is a better B movie 10 years later. He summarized that \"''The Happening'' contains some genuinely moving sequences, gruesome slaughter, a few intimate moments that truly resonate, and some laugh-out-loud scenes that defy explanation (see: a confused man is being eaten by hungry lions). While it's overacted in many spots and completely bonkers in others, it's a fascinating mix of eco-didacticism, post 9/11 trauma, spaced-out Zooey Deschanel, Cabbage Patch doll jokes, mood rings, math riddles, hot dog love, and silly, unsophisticated screenwriting based on shaky pseudo-science.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/rewatch-m-night-shyamalans-the-happening-is-a-better-b-movie-10-years-later|title=Rewatch: M.

It uses the tropes of classic disaster/survival B-Movies (Shyamalan clearly knows his classics) but inverts them. The pacing of the film, for example, moves in reverse. It starts off quite fraught and slows down further and further as it goes on. By the time it reaches its (anti)climax, it\u2019s become almost motionless with fewer words, longer takes, extended periods of stillness and silence; a vastness you can almost feel.\" He summarized that \"The script here is so carefully constructed, so multi-layered and so rhythmic it\u2019s almost poetry.

At its core, the Mark Wahlberg/Zooey Deschanel sci-fi chiller is essentially 'What if one of our more genuinely talented directors made a big-budget, R-rated Ed Wood movie?' Shyamalan is nothing if not sincere, and while he\u2019s attempting a modern-day version of a 1950\u2019s sci-fi warning movie, the film is absolutely invested in its mother nature is tired of humanity\u2019s bullshit premise.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/20/emily-blunt-john-krasinski-a-quiet-place-part-2-6-terrifying-films-to-stream-instead/?sh=7fe8e87716b4|title=6 Terrifying Films to Stream Instead of 'A Quiet Place Part II'|website=[[Forbes]] |access-date=December 24, 2020|archive-date=October 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211018115526/https://buy.tinypass.com/checkout/template/cacheableShow?aid=Yj2fRrCPpu&templateId=OTMNB56G6EFU&templateVariantId=OTV23R7HJV5O3&offerId=fakeOfferId&experienceId=EX57PP5AWTFD&iframeId=offer_7c3cc2aa75864be609b6-0&displayMode=inline&pianoIdUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.forbes.com%2Fid%2F&widget=template&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nAs of August 2020, the DVD units sold have generated over US$22.4 million in revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Happening-The |title=The Happening (2008): Video 'Sales |work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] |access-date=August 7, 2020 |archive-date=October 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006204019/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/HAPPN-DVD.php |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0949731|The Happening}}\n* {{Allmovie title|94273|The Happening}}\n\n{{M.
