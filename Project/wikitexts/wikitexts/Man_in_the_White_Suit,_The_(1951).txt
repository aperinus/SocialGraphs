It stars [[Alec Guinness]], [[Joan Greenwood]] and [[Cecil Parker]] and was directed by [[Alexander Mackendrick]]. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing (Screenplay)]] for [[Roger MacDougall]], [[John Dighton]] and [[Alexander Mackendrick]].\n\nIt followed a common [[Ealing Studios]] theme of the \"common man\" against [[the Establishment]]. In this instance the hero falls foul of both [[trade union]]s and the wealthy mill owners who attempt to suppress his invention.<ref>{{cite book |title=British national cinema |last=Street |first=Sarah |year=2008 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-38422-3 |page=81}}</ref>\n\n[[Mandy Miller]] (aged only 6) made her first film appearance in this film.\n\n==Plot==\nSidney (\"Sid\") Stratton, a brilliant young research [[chemist]] and former [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] scholarship recipient, has been dismissed from jobs at several [[textile mill]]s in the [[Northern England|north of England]] because of his demands for expensive facilities and his obsession with inventing an everlasting [[fibre]]. Whilst working as a labourer at the Birnley Mills, he accidentally becomes an unpaid researcher and invents an incredibly strong fibre which repels dirt and never wears out. From this fabric, a suit is made\u2014which is brilliant white because it cannot absorb dye and slightly luminous because it includes [[radioactive]] elements.\n\nStratton is lauded as a genius until both management and the trade unions realise the consequence of his invention; once consumers have purchased enough cloth, demand will drop precipitously and put the textile industry out of business. The managers try to trick and bribe Stratton into signing away the rights to his invention but he refuses. Managers and workers each try to shut him away, but he escapes.\n\nThe bosses negotiate with Daphne, the daughter of the owner of Birnley Mills, that she will trick Stratton into giving it all up and she asks \u00a35000 for this, but when she meets Stratton she has a change of heart and encourages him to announce his invention to the press. Going back to his rooms he is confronted by a woman who he thought was on his side, but suddenly realises that no-one wants his invention.\n\nThe climax sees Stratton running through the streets at night in his glowing white suit, pursued by both the managers and the employees. As the crowd advances, his suit begins to fall apart as the chemical structure of the fibre breaks down with time. The mob, realising the flaw in the process, rip pieces off his suit in triumph, until he is left standing in his shirt and underwear. Only Daphne Birnley, the mill-owner's daughter, and Bertha, a works labourer, have sympathy for his disappointment.\n\nThe next day, Stratton is dismissed from his job. Departing, he consults his chemistry notes. A realisation hits and he exclaims, \"I see!\" With that he strides off, perhaps to try again elsewhere.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Alec Guinness]] as Sidney Stratton\n*[[Joan Greenwood]] as Daphne Birnley\n*[[Cecil Parker]] as Alan Birnley\n*[[Michael Gough]] as Michael Corland\n*[[Ernest Thesiger]] as Sir John Kierlaw\n*[[Howard Marion-Crawford]] as Cranford\n*[[Henry Mollison]] as Hoskins\n*[[Vida Hope]] as Bertha\n*[[Patric Doonan]] as Frank\n*[[Duncan Lamont]] as Harry\n*[[Harold Goodwin (English actor)|Harold Goodwin]] as Wilkins\n*[[Colin Gordon]] as Hill\n*Joan Harben as Miss Johnson\n*[[Arthur Howard]] as Roberts\n*[[Roddy Hughes]] as Green\n*[[Stuart Latham]] as Harrison\n*[[Miles Malleson]] as the Tailor\n*[[Edie Martin]] as Mrs. Watson\n*[[Mandy Miller]] as Gladdie, little girl who sends a message for Stratton\n*[[Charlotte Mitchell]] as Mill Girl\n*Olaf Olsen as Knudsen\n*[[Desmond Roberts]] as Mannering\n*[[Ewan Roberts]] as Fotheringay\n*[[John Rudling]] as Wilson\n*Charles Saynor as Pete\n*[[Russell Waters]] as Davidson\n*[[Brian Worth (actor)|Brian Worth]] as King\n*[[George Benson (actor)|George Benson]] as the Lodger\n*[[Frank Atkinson (actor)|Frank Atkinson]] as the Baker\n*[[Charles Cullum]] as 1st Company Director\n*F.B.J.
