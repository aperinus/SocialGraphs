To avoid confusion with the first film, Cukor's version was originally titled ''The Murder in Thornton Square'' in the UK.<ref>[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/murder-thornton-square BBFC: ''The Murder in Thornton Square''] Linked 2014-03-08</ref> The film features numerous deviations from the original stage play, though the central drama remains that of a husband trying to drive his wife insane in order to distract her from his criminal activities.\n\n''Gaslight'' was released theatrically on May 4, 1944, by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to critical acclaim and box-office success, grossing $4.6 million on a $2 million budget, and received seven nominations for the [[17th Academy Awards]], including for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning two: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Bergman), and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]].

As an adult, Paula marries her accompanist Gregory Anton, after a two-week whirlwind romance. At his suggestion, they settle in London and occupy her late aunt's long-vacant townhouse.<ref name=\"Plot\">{{cite web |title=Gaslight (1944) |url=https://www.filmsite.org/gasl.html |website=Filmsite LLC |access-date=19 November 2021}}</ref>\n\nPaula grapples with the memory of her aunt's murder, and Gregory suggests storing Alice's furnishings in the attic. When Paula finds a letter to her aunt from a man named Sergis Bauer, Gregory reacts violently but apologizes. He hires a young maid, Nancy, and insists that she never bother his \"high-strung\" wife.\n\nPaula is surprised when Gregory chides her supposed forgetfulness, but on a visit to the [[Tower of London]], she cannot find an heirloom [[brooch]] he gave her, although it was stored safely in her handbag. She is plagued by noises coming from the boarded-up attic, and notices the [[gas lighting|gaslights]] dim for no apparent reason when Gregory is not home, which he assures her is only her imagination.\n\n[[File:Gaslight 1944 trailer.jpg|thumb|left|With Gregory looking on, Paula has discovered the letter from Sergis Bauer.]]\nGregory flirts with Nancy, whose disdain for his wife only worsens Paula's nerves. Her anxious behavior is noticed by Inspector Brian Cameron of [[Scotland Yard]], a childhood admirer of Alice. Struck by Paula's resemblance to her aunt, Cameron attempts to reopen the [[cold case]], discovering that a gift of royal jewels was not recovered after Alice's murder.\n\nIsolating his wife from the world, Gregory convinces her that she is a [[kleptomaniac]], responsible for hiding a painting, and is too unwell to be in public. Unable to prevent her from attending a party hosted by her old family friend, Gregory accuses Paula of stealing his watch. When he finds it in her handbag, Paula becomes hysterical in front of the guests. Taking Paula home, Gregory angrily claims that her mother died in an asylum, and that the letter she discovered from Sergis Bauer never existed. Doubting her own sanity, Paula breaks down.\n\nA suspicious Cameron recruits a patrolman to watch Gregory, whom they learn often visits an abandoned house nearby, and is planning to institutionalize Paula. When Gregory leaves, Cameron offers Paula his assistance, confirming that the attic noises and flickering gaslights are indeed real. He deduces that Gregory goes to the neighboring vacant house to enter his own attic through a skylight. Paula has heard him searching through Alice's belongings, and the gaslights flicker when he turns on the attic lights, reducing the gas to the downstairs lamps.\n\nCameron pries open Gregory's desk, and Paula finds the letter from Bauer that her husband insisted was a delusion. They realize \"Gregory\" is actually Sergis Bauer, who murdered Alice but was interrupted before he could find her jewels. His marriage to Paula was a scheme to gain access to her aunt's home, employing a cunning strategy to drive his wife mad and have her institutionalized, leaving him Alice's estate and allowing him to search unabated for the jewels.\n\nIn the attic, Sergis discovers the jewels hidden in plain sight, sewn into one of Alice's famous costumes. He returns downstairs to find his desk unlocked, and a mentally exhausted Paula admits that she was visited by a man. To protect Paula, the kindly cook Elizabeth assures Sergis that this was merely a figment of her imagination, driving Paula to despair. Cameron appears and confronts Sergis, chasing him into the attic and tying him to a chair.\n\nFinally convinced of her own sanity, Paula is left alone with Sergis, who urges her to cut him free. Instead, Paula taunts him, musing that the knife in her hand might not be real and finding the \"missing\" brooch. As the police drive Sergis away, Cameron expresses interest in seeing Paula again.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Gaslight 1944 trailer(2).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Gregory and Paula in their final confrontation]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Charles Boyer]] as Gregory Anton/Sergis Bauer\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Paula Alquist Anton\n** [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] as 14-year-old Paula (uncredited)\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Brian Cameron\n* [[Dame May Whitty]] as Miss Bessie Thwaites\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Nancy Oliver\n* [[Barbara Everest]] as Elizabeth Tompkins\n* [[Emil Rameau]] as Maestro Guardi\n* [[Edmund Breon]] as General Huddleston, Brian's supervisor\n* [[Halliwell Hobbes]] as Mr. Mufflin, Paula's lawyer\n* Tom Stevenson as PC Williams\n* [[Heather Thatcher]] as Lady Mildred Dalroy\n* [[Lawrence Grossmith]] as Lord Freddie Dalroy.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 89% based on reviews from 35 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gaslight (1944) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1008138_gaslight |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2022-10-11}}</ref>\n\nWhen ''Gaslight'' was released, ''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] praised the actors. He wrote, \"And with Mr. Boyer doing the driving in his best dead-pan hypnotic style, while the flames flicker strangely in the gas-jets and the mood music bongs with heavy threats, it is no wonder that Miss Bergman goes to pieces in a most distressing way. Both of these popular performers play their roles right to the hilt. Nice little personality vignettes are interestingly contributed, too, by Joseph Cotten as a stubborn detective, Dame May Whitty and Angela Lansbury as a maid.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9907E6DE173DE03ABC4D53DFB366838F659EDE| title='Gaslight,' Adapted From Play 'Angel Street,' at Capitol -'Hardy's Blonde 'Trouble' Is Shown at Loew's State| last=Crowther| first=Bosley| author-link=Bosley Crowther| newspaper=The New York Times| date=May 5, 1944| access-date=July 24, 2013| url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n===Noir analysis===\nIn 2006, film critic [[Emanuel Levy]] discussed the [[film noir]] aspects of the film:\n\n<blockquote>A thriller soaked in paranoia, ''Gaslight'' is a period films {{sic}} noir that, like [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|The Lodger]]'' and ''[[Hangover Square (film)|Hangover Square]]'', is set in the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian age]]. It's interesting to speculate about the prominence of a film cycle in the 1940s that can be described as 'Don't Trust Your Husband'. It began with three Hitchcock films: ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), and ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and continued with ''Gaslight'' and ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (both in 1944), ''[[Dragonwyck (film)|Dragonwyck]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' and ''[[The Spiral Staircase (1946 film)|The Spiral Staircase]]'' (both 1946), ''[[The Two Mrs. Carrolls]]'' (1947), and ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' and ''[[Sleep, My Love]]'' (both 1948). All of these films use the noir visual vocabulary and share the same premise and narrative structure: The life of a rich, sheltered woman is threatened by an older, deranged man, often her husband. In all of them, the house, usually a symbol of sheltered security in Hollywood movies, becomes a trap of terror.<ref name=\"levy\">{{cite web| url=http://emanuellevy.com/review/gaslight-6/| title=Gaslight: Cukor's Masterpiece Starring Ingrid Bergman in Oscar-Winning Performance | first=Emanuel| last=Levy| website=Emanuel Levy Cinema 24/7| date=2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
