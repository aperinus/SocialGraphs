Plot summaries for films should be 400-700 words.-->\nBrothers Marcus Anthony II and Kevin Copeland are FBI agents who try to collar a drug dealer by selling their product disguised as ice cream. However, their bust fails when a genuine ice-cream salesman shows up first. The two agents are offered a reprieve if they chauffeur the  sisters Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, the rich but shallow socialite daughters of Wilson Cruiseliners CEO Andrew Wilson, safely to a weekend-long fashion event in [[The Hamptons]], so they won't become the next victims in a string of high-profile kidnappings. However, the Wilson sisters\u2019 dog leaps out of the vehicle\u2019s window, causing Kevin to reach for its leash to save it. In the process, Kevin loses control of the vehicle, causing an accident where the sisters suffer minor facial scars and refuse to be seen in public in such imperfect condition. Fearing for their jobs, Kevin scares the girls into staying at a hotel while he and Marcus disguise themselves as the sisters and attend the event.\n\nKevin, as Brittany, and Marcus, as Tiffany, acquaint themselves with the sisters' three best friends \u2013 Lisa Anderson, Karen Googlestein, and Tori Wilson (no relation to Brittany and Tiffany) \u2013 and encounter their rivals: the Vandergeld sisters, Heather and Megan. Unbeknownst to Kevin and Marcus, the sisters are being monitored by their colleagues, Vincent Gomez and Jake Harper, and their boss, Chief Elliott Gordon, who are undercover posing as hotel staff. At the hotel, pro basketball player Latrell Spencer, who has an assistant named Tony, takes a shine to Marcus/Tiffany, and Kevin takes a shine to [[New York One News]] reporter, Denise Porter.\n\nAt one of the Vandergelds' annual charity auction party that night, Latrell wins a dinner date with Marcus/Tiffany, while Kevin pretends to be Latrell to attract Denise, after hearing that she likes rich men. While the real Latrell takes Marcus/Tiffany to the [[La Bella]] restaurant, Kevin uses Latrell's car to drive Denise to Latrell's house, where he begins to solicit information about Ted Burton turning the tables on Warren Vandergeld, Heather and Megan's father. With Kevin becoming romantically involved with Denise and Marcus/Tiffany trying to reject Latrell to no avail, their combined antics put them under Gomez and Harper's suspicion.\n\nAt a [[nightclub]], after winning a [[dance-off]] against the Vandergelds, Kevin and Marcus learn from a drunken and heartbroken Karen that Warren Vandergeld is actually penniless and has been taking loans from her father, causing them both to realize that Warren is the mastermind behind the kidnappings. The next day, the real Brittany and Tiffany arrive at the hotel and find out that they are being impersonated. As they arrive in the Hamptons to reveal their \"clones\", so do Marcus' wife, Gina, and her friend, Shaunice, having assumed that Marcus is cheating on Gina. Gomez and Harper also conclude that the Wilsons are being impersonated by two men and aim to expose them, only to inappropriately strip down the real Brittany and Tiffany in front of Gordon by accident where Tiffany punches Harper in the face. They are subsequently suspended, and a furious Gordon fires Kevin and Marcus after he discovers the truth. Having lost both his job and possibly Gina, Marcus snaps at Kevin for his renegade ways, always dragging him into trouble.\n\nLater, Kevin and Marcus discover that Warren had funneled large sums of money through his modest charity. Marcus stops Kevin from notifying Gordon, convincing him that they should personally intervene to redeem themselves, and they contact Gomez and Harper to help resolve the case. Under disguise as the Wilson sisters, \"they\" are chosen to appear in the event's final fashion show, and the Vandergelds are furious that they were kicked off the catwalk by the boss, Aubrey, in favor of the Copelands/Wilsons, but the real Brittany and Tiffany also perform in the event. Karen rejects Heath who callously snubbed her which makes Marcus punch him in the face. During the show, the Vandergeld sisters try to sabotage their \"rivals\", but end up being humiliated by Karen, Lisa and Tori, who discovered them on the scaffolding above the catwalk.\n\nHowever, the real Brittany and Tiffany unmask Kevin and Marcus as imposters, thus causing mass confusion between the group and the audience. Warren uses the opportunity to begin the kidnapping. However, Warren incorrectly captures Marcus/Tiffany and Brittany, which begins a fight between the Copeland brothers and Heath and Russ, a pair of friends Warren hired to get involved with the girls and aid in the kidnappings. Warren soon captures the real sisters and explains his financial troubles to his wife, Elaine, and daughters (who are dismayed to find out that they are broke) not knowing that Denise and her cameraman are recording his confession. In the ensuing fight, Kevin is nearly shot trying to protect Denise, Latrell is shot trying to protect Marcus/Tiffany, and Warren is shot in the shoulder by Kevin.\n\nMarcus and Kevin successfully capture Warren while Gomez and Harper apprehend Heath and Russ. Afterward, their true identities are revealed to all, and Latrell is dismayed that Marcus is not actually white but he does not seem to care that Marcus is actually a man. While Warren, Heath and Russ are arrested, Gordon reinstates the Copeland brothers, Gomez, and Harper. Marcus clears things with Gina, Kevin and Denise begin a relationship, and Latrell wins over the real Brittany and Tiffany. Tori, Lisa, and Karen admit they liked Brittany and Tiffany a lot more when Marcus and Kevin were them. The five agree to remain friends and go shopping on the next day together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing}}\n* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Kevin Copeland / Brittany Wilson\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Marcus Anthony Copeland II / Tiffany Wilson\n* [[Jaime King]] as Heather Vandergeld\n* [[Busy Philipps]] as Karen Googlestein\n* [[Jennifer Carpenter]] as Lisa Anderson\n* [[Jessica Cauffiel]] as Tori Wilson\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Warren Vandergeld\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Megan Vandergeld\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Latrell Spencer\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as Chief Elliott Gordon\n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Agent Jake Harper\n* [[Eddie Velez]] as Agent Vincent Gomez\n* [[Rochelle Aytes]] as Denise Porter\n* [[Maitland Ward]] as Brittany Wilson\n* [[Anne Dudek]] as Tiffany Wilson\n* [[Faune A.
