Every detail does not need to be added here. -->\nFormer [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] secretary Erin Grant loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell, a criminal who cost Erin her job. To afford an appeal to get her daughter back, Erin becomes a [[stripper]] at the Eager Beaver, a [[strip club]] in [[Miami]].\n\nA [[United States Congress|Congressman]] named David Dilbeck visits the club and becomes infatuated with Erin. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the congressman to settle the custody battle and help her get Angela back. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from Darrell's negligent care.\n\nDilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer, Al Garcia, begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing on tape, and he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, quits stripping, and gets back her job in the FBI. Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Erin Grant, a former [[FBI]] secretary-turned-[[stripper]] who is the most popular stripper of the Eager Beaver, a well-attended strip club in [[Miami, Florida]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Lieutenant Al Garcia\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as \"Shad\", the Eager Beaver's head security\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Darrell Grant\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Congressman David Dilbeck, a powerful and corrupt [[United States Congress|congressman]] with an obsession with Erin\n* [[Paul Guilfoyle]] as Malcolm Moldowsky\n* Jerry Grayson as Orly\n* [[Rumer Willis]] as Angela Grant, Erin's daughter.\n* [[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]] as Erb Crandal\n* William Hill as Jerry Killian\n* [[Stuart Pankin]] as Alan Mordecai\n* [[Dina Spybey]] as Monique Jr., a sexy and popular foreign stripper who comes from [[Paris, France]]\n* PaSean Wilson as Sabrina Hepburn\n* [[Pandora Peaks]] as Urbana Sprawl, a popular stripper from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]\n* [[Barbara Alyn Woods]] as Lorelei\n* Kimberly Flynn as Ariel Sharon\n* [[Rena Riffel]] as Tiffany\n* [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan|Siobhan Fallon]] as Rita Grant\n* [[Gary Basaraba]] as Alberto\n[[Gianni Russo]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]] play father-and-son politicians Willie & Chris Rojo, while [[Eduardo Y\u00e1\u00f1ez]] and [[Antoni Corone]] appear as bodyguards Chico & Nico. [[Frances Fisher]] also makes a small appearance as Lieutenant Garcia's wife, Donna Garcia.\n\n==Production==\n[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] produced ''Striptease''. The film is based on the novel ''[[Strip Tease (novel)|Strip Tease]]'' by [[Florida|Floridian]] [[crime writer]] [[Carl Hiaasen]]. It was published in 1993 and was a bestseller.\n\nThe [[screenplay]] itself was written by Andrew Bergman, who also directed. According to one critic, the novel's plot is \"quite faithfully followed\" by the screenplay, but in bringing the complicated story to the screen, \"Bergman forgets to explain persuasively what a nice girl like Erin \u2013 smart, spunky and a former FBI employee \u2013 is doing in a dump called the Eager Beaver.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Richard|last=Schickel|author-link=Richard Schickel|title=Only the bare essentials|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=July 8, 1996|volume=148|issue=3|pages=66\u20138}}</ref>\n\nBergman says, \"I loved the book, and the funny thing was, [author Carl] Hiaasen loved the movie.

I was treated like a freakin\u2019 child molester for making that movie, but so be it.\"<ref name=\"andrew\"/>\n\n\"''Striptease'' was hard because the tone was so crazy,\" said Bergman. \"How do you stay true to the tone? You have to be true to those strip clubs. There's always some woman with like 50 triple-Ds, they always advertise, and you have to have someone like that.

When Hackman turned the role down, Reynolds contacted Castle Rock head [[Rob Reiner]], and traveled to Miami to audition. \"To be honest,\" said producer Lobell, \"we were not enthusiastic at first.
