He is revered as a legend in the police force and at the same time feared among the mafia for his brutality in cracking down on crime. Yet, beneath his cool, macho appearance lies a secret that he must hide from the world he lives in. Ji-wook was born male, and he has wanted to live his life as a woman since his teenage years. He tries to suppress this inner desire, but in vain. Ji-wook finally reaches the point where he can no longer hide who he truly is, and decides to take the plunge and get a gender affirmation operation. However, before he has a chance to do so, unexpected crises arise and interfere with his plans. A gang that suffered from the cold, hard steel of Ji-wook's handcuffs is dead set on getting their revenge against him. Ji-wook resigns and tries to go about making his dream a reality, but people close to him gets sucked into the revenge plot he finds himself at the center of. When some of those people get killed and a girl named Jang-mi falls into danger, he realizes that he can't stand idly by any longer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ji|first=Yong-jin|title=Charming and Addictive Korean Films: Action drama in a unique style - ''High Heel'' (working title)|url=http://koreanfilm.or.kr/webzine/sub/feature.jsp?mode=A_VIEW&wbSeq=100|work=Korean Cinema Today|accessdate=2014-05-29|date=25 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Conran|first=Pierce|title=Man on High Heels|url=http://koreanfilm.or.kr/webzine/sub/newfilms.jsp?mode=A_VIEW&wbSeq=158|work=Korean Cinema Today|accessdate=2014-05-29|date=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Cha Seung-won]] as Yoon Ji-wook\n* [[Oh Jung-se]] as Heo Gon\n* [[Esom]] as Jang-mi\n* Song Young-chang as Heo Bul\n* [[Kim Eung-soo]] as Squad leader Park\n* [[Ahn Gil-kang]] as Master Park \n* [[Go Kyung-pyo]] as Kim Jin-woo\n* Lee Yong-nyeo as Bada\n* [[Lee El]] as Do Do\n* [[Kim Min-kyo]] as Man 1\n* Min Jun-ho as accountant\n* Kim Ye-won as Jung Yoo-ri\n* [[Lee Sa-bi|Lee Eon-jeong]] as Joo-yeon \n* [[Oh Ji-ho]] as Lee Seok\n* [[Park Sung-woong]] as Prosecutor Hong\n* [[Yoon Son-ha]] as Jung Yoo-jung\n* Lee Moon-soo as taxi driver\n* [[Kim Byeong-ok]] as Dr. Jin\n* Lee Hae-young as immigration staff member\n* [[Kim Won-hae]] as elevator resident\n* Lee Dong Gil as young Jiwook\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Box office==\n''Man on High Heels'' was released in South Korea on June 4, 2014.
