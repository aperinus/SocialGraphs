It follows interlocking storylines among the [[working class]] underbelly of the [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] neighborhood, including [[Trade union|unionized]] workers, [[sex worker]]s, and [[drag queen]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1952 Brooklyn, workers have entered the sixth month of a [[Strike action|strike]] against the local factory. [[Union representative|Shop steward]] Harry Black relishes his new role as the strike secretary as it allows him to get out of the house, away from his wife who does not realize that Harry is [[gay]]. Boyce, the union leader, tries to negotiate between the factory and union representatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Tralala is a prostitute who lures unsuspecting sailors out to a vacant lot to be robbed by Vinnie, an ex-convict and Tralala's [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]]. Georgette is a young [[transgender]] woman who harbors a crush on Vinnie. Big Joe, one of the striking workers, struggles with accepting his daughter's out of wedlock pregnancy and embracing his future son-in-law.\n\nHarry meets Regina, another transgender woman, and falls in love with her. Tralala also meets a kindly sailor in Manhattan who appears to truly love her and lets her move in with him. Both romances end on a tragic note for Harry and Tralala.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Stephen Lang]] as Harry Black\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Tralala\n* [[Burt Young]] as Big Joe\n* [[Peter Dobson]] as Vinnie\n* [[Jerry Orbach]] as Boyce\n* [[Stephen Baldwin]] as Sal\n* Jason Andrews as Tony\n* James Lorinz as Freddy\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Al\n* Maia Danziger as Mary Black\n* [[Camille Saviola]] as Ella\n* [[Ricki Lake]] as Donna\n* Cameron Johann as Spook\n* [[John Costelloe (actor)|John Costelloe]] as Tommy\n* [[Christopher Murney]] as Paulie\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as Georgette\n* Zette as Regina\n* [[Mark Boone Junior]] as Willie\n* [[Rutanya Alda]] as Georgette's mother\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nThere had been several attempts to adapt ''Last Exit to Brooklyn'' into a film since the controversial book's 1964 publication.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=May 11, 1990 |title=Last Exit to Brooklyn |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/last-exit-to-brooklyn-1990 |access-date=2022-09-20 |website=RogerEbert.com}}</ref> One of the earliest attempts was made by producer [[Steve Krantz]] and animator [[Ralph Bakshi]], who wanted to direct a live-action film based on the novel.

Selby agreed to the adaptation, and actor [[Robert De Niro]] accepted the role of Harry in ''Strike''. According to Bakshi, \"the whole thing fell apart when Krantz and I had a falling out over past business. It was a disappointment to me and Selby.
