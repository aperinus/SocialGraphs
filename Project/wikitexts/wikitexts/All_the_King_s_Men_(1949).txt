It is based on the 1946 [[Robert Penn Warren]] [[All the King's Men|novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Broderick Crawford]], [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]], [[Mercedes McCambridge]], and [[Joanne Dru]]. The plot focuses on the rise and fall of the ambitious and ruthless politician Willie Stark (Crawford) in the [[Southern United States|American South]].<ref>{{AFI film|id=26205|title=All the King's Men}}.</ref> Though a fictional character, Stark strongly resembles Louisiana governor [[Huey Long]].\n\nThe film won three [[Academy Awards]], including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], the award for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], which went to Broderick Crawford, and the award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], won by Mercedes McCambridge.\n\nIn 2001, ''All the King's Men'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story of the rise of politician Willie Stark from a rural county seat to the governor's mansion is depicted in the film. He goes into politics, railing against the corruptly run county government, but loses his race for county treasurer, in the face of unfair obstacles placed by the local machine. Stark teaches himself law, and as a lawyer, continues to fight the local establishment, championing the local people and gaining popularity. He eventually rises to become a candidate for governor, narrowly losing his first race, then winning on his second attempt. Along the way he loses his innocence and becomes as corrupt as the politicians he once fought against.  As he rises, Stark philanders and gets involved with many women, taking his PR man/journalist Jack Burden's own girlfriend, Anne Stanton, as his mistress.\n\nStark's son Tommy drinks to deal with his feelings about his father, eventually crashes his car, injuring himself and killing his female passenger. When Stark bullies Tommy into playing a football game, Tommy becomes paralyzed after a brutal hit.\n\nStark, who had always dealt with those who got in his way by any means, begins to see  his world start to unravel and he discovers that not everyone can be bought off.\n\nThe story has a complex series of relationships. All is seen through the eyes of the journalist, Jack Burden, who admires Stark and even when disillusioned still sticks by him. Stark's campaign assistant, Sadie  is clearly in love with Stark  and wants him to leave his wife, Lucy. When Stark's reputation is brought into disrepute by Judge Stanton (Anne's uncle), he seeks to blacken the judge's name. When Jack finds evidence of the judge's possible wrongdoing, a quarter century earlier, he hides it from Stark. Anne gives the evidence to Stark, who uses it against her uncle, who immediately commits suicide. Anne seems to forgive Stark, but her brother, Adam, the surgeon who helped save Tommy's life after the car crash, cannot. After Stark wins an impeachment investigation, Adam assassinates Stark. The doctor in turn is shot down by Sugar Boy, Stark's fawning assistant. Having lost his respect for him, Jack tries to get Anne's agreement to find a way to destroy Stark's reputation just as he dies.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:All-the-King's-Men-Willie-Stark.jpg|thumb|[[Broderick Crawford]] as Willie Stark in ''All the King's Men'']]\n* [[Broderick Crawford]] as Willie Stark\n* [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]] as Jack Burden\n* [[Joanne Dru]] as Anne Stanton\n* [[John Derek]] as Tom Stark\n* [[Mercedes McCambridge]] as Sadie Burke\n* [[Shepperd Strudwick]] as Adam Stanton\n* [[Ralph Dumke]] as Tiny Duffy\n* [[Anne Seymour (actress)|Anne Seymour]] as Mrs. Lucy Stark\n* [[Katherine Warren|Katharine Warren]] as Mrs. Burden\n* [[Raymond Greenleaf]] as Judge Monte Stanton\n* [[Walter Burke]] as Sugar Boy\n* [[Will Wright (actor)|Will Wright]] as Dolph Pillsbury\n* [[Grandon Rhodes]] as Floyd McEvoy\n* [[Larry Steers]] as Man at Impeachment Hearing (uncredited)\n* [[Houseley Stevenson]] as Madison the newspaper editor <ref>{{cite web |title=All the King's Men |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/26205 |website=AFI{{!}}Catalog |publisher=American Film Institute |access-date=July 18, 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Paul Ford]] as State Senator and impeachment prosecutor\n\n==Production==\nRossen originally offered the starring role to [[John Wayne]], who found the proposed film script unpatriotic and indignantly refused the part. Crawford, who eventually took the role, won the 1949 [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for his role in ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''.\n\nThe film was shot at various locations in California using local residents, something that was fairly unknown for Hollywood at the time.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Higham | first1 =Charles | last2=Greenberg | first2=Joel | year = 1968 | title=Hollywood in the Forties | page=79 | publisher=A.

Al Clark did the original cut but had trouble putting all the footage that [[Robert Rossen]] had shot into a coherent narrative. [[Robert Parrish]] was brought on board by Rossen and Columbia Studios head, [[Harry Cohn]], to see what he could do. Since Rossen had a hard time cutting anything he shot, after several weeks of tinkering and cutting, the movie was still over 250 minutes long. Cohn was prepared to release it in this version after one more preview, but this threw Rossen into a panic, so Rossen came up with a novel solution. Rossen told Parrish to \"[s]elect what you consider to be the center of each scene, put the film in the synch machine and wind down a hundred feet [around 50 seconds] before and a hundred feet after, and chop it off, regardless of what's going on. Cut through dialogue, music, anything. Then, when you're finished, we'll run the picture and see what we've got\". When Parrish was done with what Rossen had suggested, they were left with a 109-minute movie that was more compelling to watch. After ''All the King's Men'' won its [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], Harry Cohn repeatedly gave Parrish credit for saving the film, even though Parrish only did what Rossen told him to do. The editing gambit gives the film a memorably jagged urgency that's unique for a studio-era film.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/157035%7C0/All-the-King-s-Men.html |title= All the King's Men|last1= Tatara |first1= Paul|website= [[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=18 February 2014}}</ref> Although Clark is credited as the \"Film Editor\" (with Parrish being credited as \"Editorial Advisor\"), both Clark and Parrish received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received wide acclaim upon its release. Film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] lauded the film and its direction in his review, writing, \"Robert Rossen has written and directed, as well as personally produced, a rip-roaring film of the same title ... We have carefully used that descriptive as the tag for this new Columbia film because a quality of turbulence and vitality is the one that it most fully demonstrates ... In short, Mr. Rossen has assembled in this starkly unprettified film a piece of pictorial journalism that is remarkable for its brilliant parts.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9405EFDB1E3BE23BBC4153DFB7678382659EDE Crowther, Bosley].

Accessed: July 22, 2013.</ref> Critic William Brogdon, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, was also complimentary and praised Broderick Crawford's work, \"As the rural Abe Lincoln, springing up from the soil to make himself a great man by using the opinionless, follow-the-leader instinct of the more common voter, Broderick Crawford does a standout performance. Given a meaty part, his histrionic bent wraps it up for a great personal success adding much to the many worthwhile aspects of the drama.\"<ref>[https://variety.com/1949/film/reviews/all-the-king-s-men-2-1200416458/ Brogdon, William].

It deals with graft, corruption, love, drink and betrayal, and the subversion of idealism by power, and it might even make someone angry... The story moves toward its conclusion with the dark inevitability of film noir.\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115895225271271526 Goldberg, Joe].
