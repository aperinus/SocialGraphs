The film co-stars [[Kerry Washington]], [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Lochlyn Munro]], [[Chazz Palminteri]] and [[Molly Shannon]]. A very short jewel thief hides the proceeds of his latest robbery, and then pretends to be a very large baby in order to retrieve it.\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on July 14, 2006 to commercial success but largely negative reviews, including three [[Golden Raspberry Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Chicago]], Calvin \"Babyface\" Simms is a [[Dwarfism|very short]] convicted jewel thief. He is seen getting released from prison and meeting up with his goofball cohort Percy. Percy tells Calvin of a job involving stealing a valuable diamond, ordered by a mobster named Mr. Walken . After the successful robbery, the duo are almost arrested by the police, but not before Calvin manages to stash the diamond in the purse of a nearby woman. The thieves follow the handbag's owner to her home where they discover a couple, Darryl and Vanessa Edwards, the former of whom is eager to have a child.\n\nCalvin and Percy hatch a plot to pass Calvin off as a baby left on the couple's doorstep in order to get the diamond back. After learning that Child Services is closed for the weekend, Darryl and Vanessa decide to look after Calvin in the meantime. However, Vanessa's dad Francis \"Pops\" has a bad feeling about Calvin. Friends of the couple find Calvin strange as well. Despite this, Calvin eventually takes a liking to having a family and starts to feel remorse for using them, especially when they throw him a birthday party (coincidentally on his actual birthday) as Calvin never had parents who\u2019d throw him a party. Walken grows impatient and demands the diamond from Percy. Percy attempts to recover Calvin by posing as his father, but is thrown out by Darryl. Walken's men witness this and as a result believe that Darryl is Calvin.\n\nDarryl and Vanessa decide to adopt Calvin but upon coming home from a date, they find Pops and Calvin having a fight as the former has discovered Calvin's secret. Pops is sent to a [[retirement home]], but before leaving he tells Darryl to \"check the teddy bear\", referring to a gift he gave to Calvin earlier at his party. Darryl discovers the bear is actually a nanny cam and witnesses Calvin admit to his deception. Walken and his henchmen come by the house after Percy lies to get out of trouble; claiming that Darryl is his partner who has the diamond. In a series of comedic maneuvers, Calvin manages to rescue Darryl and have Walken and his men arrested. Darryl is given a substantial reward for the recovery of the diamond, and since Calvin saved his life, he doesn't turn him over to the police.\n\nBefore he leaves, Calvin thanks Darryl for taking care of him even though he wasn't really a baby and admits that he thinks Darryl would make a great father for a real child someday. As Calvin walks away, he begins to cry hysterically knowing he will miss the family very much. Darryl then decides to let Calvin stay and the two men become the best of friends. The film ends at some point in the future with Calvin and Pops playing with Darryl and Vanessa's real baby, who looks exactly like Darryl.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Calvin \"Babyface\" Simms\n* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Darryl Edwards\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Vanessa Edwards\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Pops\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Percy \"P Unit\" Pryor\n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Greg Ault\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Mr. Walken\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Soccer Mom  \n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Jimmy Murphy\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Rosco Key\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Brittany Ault\n* [[Linden Porco]] as Calvin Body\n* Gabriel Pimentel as Calvin Body\n* [[John DeSantis]] as Bruno (credited as John De Santis)\n* [[Fred Stoller]] as Richard Sellens\n* [[Alex Borstein]] as Janet Sellens\n* [[Kelly Coffield Park]] as The Jeweler\n* [[Damien Dante Wayans]] as Officer Wilson\n* [[Gary Owen (comedian)|Gary Owen]] as Officer Jankowski \n* [[Rob Schneider]] as D-Rex (uncredited cameo)\n* Reece Knight as Nicholas \n* Chloe Matthews as Chrissy\n* Matthew Ast as Tommy\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe story premise was lifted from a 1954 [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon called ''[[Baby Buggy Bunny]]'', in which Bugs takes in a foundling unaware that he is actually a wanted dwarf bank robber.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://ew.com/article/2006/07/20/little-man-how-digital-cut-and-paste-made-mini-marlon/ |title= EW: ''Little Man'' - How digital cut-and-paste made a mini-Marlon |magazine= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date= 2020-01-19 }}</ref>\n\nFilming began in the [[Vancouver]] area on September 17, 2005, and finished on January 21, 2006.\n\nThe scenes with Calvin Simms were played twice: once by nine year old 75&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;ft 6 in) tall [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] actor [[Linden Porco]] together with the other actors, and once by [[Marlon Wayans]] alone, using a \"[[Chroma key|bluescreen]]\" technique with a green background and green clothes.
