Smith's son [[Jaden Smith]] co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by [[Steven Conrad]] is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with [[Quincy Troupe]]. It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pfeiffer |first=Antonia |title=\"The Pursuit of Happyness\"&nbsp;\u2013 A Hollywood Interpretation Of How To Achieve The American Dream |year=2018 |pages=7}}</ref> The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attended. The movie is set in San Francisco in 1981.\n\nThe film was released on December 15, 2006, by [[Columbia Pictures]], and received moderately positive reviews, with Smith\u2019s performance and the emotional weight of the story garnering universal acclaim. Smith was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Actor.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |date=2016-01-21 |title=Will Smith Says He Won't Attend Oscars |work=Variety |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/will-smith-oscars-diversity-protest-nominations-1201684878/ |url-status=live |access-date=2018-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830174430/https://variety.com/2016/film/news/will-smith-oscars-diversity-protest-nominations-1201684878/ |archive-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn 1981, [[San Francisco]] salesman [[Chris Gardner]] invests his entire life savings in portable bone-density scanners, which he demonstrates to doctors and pitches as a handy improvement over standard X-rays. The scanners play a vital role in Chris's life. While he is able to sell most of them, the time lag between the sales and his growing financial demands enrage his wife, Linda, who works as a hotel maid. The economic instability increasingly erodes their marriage, despite caring for Christopher Jr., their soon-to-be five-year-old son.\n\nWhile Chris is trying to sell one of the scanners, he meets Jay Twistle, a lead manager and partner for Dean Witter Reynolds, and impresses him by solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] during a taxi ride. After Jay leaves, Chris lacks the money to pay the fare and chooses to run instead, causing the driver to angrily chase him into a [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station. Chris boards a train but loses one of his scanners in the process. His new relationship with Jay earns him the chance to become an intern stockbroker. \n\nThe day before the interview, Chris grudgingly agrees to paint his apartment to postpone being evicted due to his difficulty in paying the rent. While painting, Chris is greeted by two policemen at his doorstep, who take him to the station, stating he has to pay for the numerous parking tickets he has accumulated. As part of the sanction, Chris is ordered to spend the night in jail instead, complicating his schedule for the interview the following day. Chris arrives at Dean Witter's office on time, albeit still in his shabby clothes. Despite his appearance, he impresses the interviewers and lands a six-month unpaid internship. He would be amongst 20 interns competing for a paid position as a stockbroker.\n\nChris's unpaid internship does not please Linda, who eventually leaves for [[New York City|New York]], because she might earn a job at her sister's boyfriend's new restaurant. After Chris bluntly tells her that she is incapable of being a single parent, she agrees that Christopher will remain with Chris. Chris is further set back when the IRS garnishes his bank account for unpaid income taxes, and he and Chris Jr. are evicted. \n\nChris ends up with less than $25, resulting in them being homeless, and they are forced at one point to stay in a restroom at a BART station. Other days, he and Christopher spend nights at a homeless shelter, in BART, or, if he manages to procure sufficient cash, at a hotel. Later, Gardner finds the bone scanner that he lost in the BART station earlier and, after repairing it, sells it to a physician, thus completing all sales of his scanners.\n\nDisadvantaged by his limited work hours and knowing that maximizing his client contacts and profits is the only way to earn the broker position, Chris develops several ways to make phone sales calls more efficiently, including reaching out to potential high-value customers and defying protocol. One sympathetic prospect, Walter Ribbon, a top-level pension fund manager, even takes Chris, Christopher, and his son to a [[San Francisco 49ers]] game where he befriends some of Walter's friends who are also potential clients. Regardless of his challenges, he never reveals his lowly circumstances to his colleagues, even going so far as to lend one of his bosses, Mr. Frohm, five dollars for cab fare, a sum he cannot afford. Chris also studies for and aces the stockbroker license exam.\n\nAs Chris concludes his last day of internship, he is summoned to a meeting with the partners. Mr. Frohm notes he is wearing a new shirt, to which Chris explains he thought it appropriate to dress for the occasion on his last day. Mr. Frohm smiles and says he should wear another one tomorrow, letting him know he has won the coveted full-time position and reimburses him for the previous cab ride. Fighting back tears, Chris shakes hands with the partners, then rushes to his son's daycare to embrace Christopher. They walk down a street, joking with each other (and are passed by the real Chris Gardner, in a business suit). \n\nAn epilogue reveals that Gardner went on to form his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Chris Gardner]]\n* [[Jaden Smith]] (credited as Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) as Christopher Gardner, Jr.\n* [[Thandiwe Newton]] (credited as Thandie Newton) as Linda Gardner\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Jay Twistle\n* [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Alan Frakesh\n* [[James Karen]] as Martin Frohm\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Walter Ribbon\n* [[Takayo Fischer]] as Mrs. Chu\n* [[Mark Christopher Lawrence]] as Wayne\n* [[Chris Gardner]] as Walking Man in Business Suit (uncredited)\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Chrisgardner.jpg|thumb|The film is based on the story of [[Chris Gardner]]'s struggle with homelessness.]]\n\n=== Development ===\n[[Chris Gardner]] realized his story had Hollywood potential after an overwhelming national response to an interview he did with ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'' in January 2003.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Zwecker |first=Bill |date=July 17, 2003 |title=There's a Way\u2014and Maybe a Will\u2014for Gardner Story |page=36 |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> He published his autobiography on May 23, 2006, and later became an associate producer for the film. \n\nThe film took some liberties with Gardner's true-life story. Certain details and events that actually took place over the span of several years were compressed into a relatively short time and although eight-year-old Jaden portrayed Chris as a five-year-old, Gardner's son was just a toddler at the time. Towards the end, Chris Gardner has a brief uncredited cameo appearance before the credits.\n\n=== Casting ===\nChris Gardner initially thought Smith, an actor best known for his performances in blockbuster films, was miscast to play him. However, he claimed his daughter Jacintha said, \"If [Smith] can play [[Muhammad Ali]], he can play you!\", referring to Smith's role in the biopic ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' (2001).<ref>{{Cite news|date=December 14, 2006|title=Smith&#039;s Real Life Role Model Unimpressed With His Stardom|work=[[Contactmusic.com]]|url=http://www.contactmusic.net/will-smith/news/smiths-real-life-role-model-unimpressed-with-his-stardom_1016502|url-status=dead|access-date=May 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514213903/http://www.contactmusic.net/will-smith/news/smiths-real-life-role-model-unimpressed-with-his-stardom_1016502|archive-date=May 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n[[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released a soundtrack album with the score composed by [[Andrea Guerra (composer)|Andrea Guerra]] on January 9, 2007.\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = No\n| total_length    = 40:00\n| title1          = Opening\n| length1         = 3:09\n| title2          = Being Stupid\n| length2         = 1:39\n| title3          = Running\n| length3         = 1:30\n| title4          = Trouble at Home\n| length4         = 1:30\n| title5          = Rubiks Cube Taxi\n| length5         = 1:53\n| title6          = Park Chase\n| length6         = 2:29\n| title7          = Linda Leaves\n| length7         = 4:02\n| title8          = Night at Police Station\n| length8         = 1:36\n| title9          = Possibly\n| length9         = 1:45\n| title10         = Where's My Shoe\n| length10        = 4:20\n| title11         = To the Game/Touchdown\n| length11        = 1:37\n| title12         = Locked Out\n| length12        = 2:20\n| title13         = Dinosaurs\n| length13        = 2:40\n| title14         = Homeless\n| length14        = 1:55\n| title15         = Happyness\n| length15        = 3:50\n| title16         = Welcome Chris\n| length16        = 3:45\n}}\n\nAlso in the film are brief portions of \"[[Higher Ground (Stevie Wonder song)|Higher Ground]]\" and \"Jesus Children of America\", both sung by [[Stevie Wonder]], and \"Lord, Don't Move the Mountain\" by [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Doris Akers]], sung by the [[Glide Memorial Church|Glide Ensemble]].\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film debuted first at the North American box office, earning $27 million during its opening weekend and beating out heavily promoted films such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'' and ''[[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''.

Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life\u2014it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something.

Neither Conrad's script nor Muccino's redundant direction shows [what] lifted the real-life Chris above better educated and more experienced candidates, but it comes through in the earnest performances of the two Smiths.
