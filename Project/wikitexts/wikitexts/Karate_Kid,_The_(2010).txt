It stars [[Jaden Smith]] and [[Jackie Chan]] in lead roles, and it was produced by [[Jerry Weintraub]], [[James Lassiter]], Ken Stovitz, [[Will Smith]] and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]]. This film does not take place in the same fictional universe as the four previous ''Karate Kid'' films, but is instead a [[remake]] of the original [[The Karate Kid|1984 film]] with the setting moved to [[China]], and the martial art changed (despite the film's title) from [[karate]] to [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]].\n\nThe plot concerns 12-year-old Dre Parker ([[Jaden Smith]]), from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], who moves to [[Beijing]], China with his mother ([[Taraji P. Henson]]) and runs afoul of the neighborhood bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). He makes an unlikely ally in the form of an aging maintenance man, Mr. Han ([[Jackie Chan]]), a [[kung fu (term)|kung fu]] [[Elderly martial arts master|master]] who teaches him the secrets of self-defense. The screenplay was written by [[Christopher Murphey]]. The film's music was composed by [[James Horner]]. It is an international co-production between [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], and the [[United States]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in Beijing, China, and filming began in July 2009 and ended on October 16. ''The Karate Kid'' was released theatrically worldwide on June 11, 2010, by [[Sony Pictures]]. The film received generally favorable reviews and earned $359 million on a $40 million [[budget]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries are set between 400-700 words, so please do not add every single detail and keep the plot summary concise. -->\n12-year-old Dre Parker and his widowed mother Sherry, are leaving [[Detroit]] travelling to [[Beijing]] after Sherry gets a job transfer at a car factory. Dre goes to a nearby park where he eyes a young violinist, Meiying, who reciprocates his attention, but a 14-year-old boy named Cheng, a rebellious [[Chinese martial arts|Kung Fu]] prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, holds a grudge against Dre and keeps them apart by attacking, teasing and bullying Dre every chance he gets. After a school field trip to the [[Forbidden City]], Dre throws a bucket of dirty water over Cheng and his gang as revenge, enraging them. They chase and eventually corner him at a backstreet alley, and brutally beat Dre until he is saved by the maintenance man, Mr. Han, who intervenes and fends off the boys and reveals himself to be a Kung Fu master.\n\nMr. Han heals Dre's injuries using Ancient Chinese medicine methods of [[Cupping therapy|fire cupping]] while explaining that Cheng and his friends are not inherently bad, but made so by their teacher Master Li, who teaches his students to be merciless towards their enemies. Intrigued, Dre asks if Han could teach him Kung Fu. Han refuses and instead brings him to meet Li at the Fighting Dragon studio to make peace. Li harshly rebuffs the peace offer and challenges Han or Dre to a fight with Cheng. Mr. Han instead counters that Dre compete against Li's students one-on-one at the upcoming open Kung Fu tournament, requesting that his students leave Dre alone to train for the tournament. Li begrudgingly agrees to the terms as long as Dre shows up at the tournament, warning them that if they don't show up, he will personally hurt them.\n\nMr. Han promises to teach Dre Kung Fu and begins to train him by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general. He conveys that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art. He teaches this by having Dre perform repetitive motions using his jacket, through which Dre develops [[muscle memory]]. Han takes Dre to a Taoist temple in the [[Wudang Mountains]]. There, Dre witnesses a woman making a cobra reflect her movements and later drinks the water from an ancient Taoist well. After many weeks of grueling and laborious training, Mr. Han soon gives Dre a day off. Dre goes to see Meiying, persuading her to [[Truancy|cut school]] for a day of fun. She is nearly late for a violin audition that was pushed up a day without her knowledge. Her parents thus deem Dre a bad influence and forbid her from ever seeing him again.\n\nDre heads to see Mr. Han, but finds him apparently drunk and depressed, smashing the [[Volkswagen Scirocco#Second generation (1981\u20131992)|car]] he was working on. A devastated Mr. Han tearfully explains to Dre that he crashed the same car years ago, and that his wife and 10-year-old son were killed in the crash. He fixes the car every year but smashes it to remind himself of what happened; this inspires Dre to train harder to help his teacher overcome his trauma and get past the incident. Mr. Han assists Dre in writing and reciting a note of apology in Mandarin to Meiying's father, who accepts Dre's gift and apology, promising that Meiying will attend the tournament to support Dre.\n\nAt the tournament, the under-confident Dre is slow to achieve parity with his competition but soon begins beating them and advances to the semi-finals. Cheng does the same by violently finishing off his opponents. Dre then beats Master Li's students, causing Li to order one of his students named Liang, Dre's semi-final opponent, to injure Dre. Liang reluctantly does so by delivering a series of crippling blows to Dre's leg, getting himself disqualified as a result. Dre advances to the final against Cheng but has limited time to return to the ring, or Cheng will claim the trophy by default. Dre pleads with Mr. Han to heal his leg via the fire cupping method. Mr. Han reluctantly does so when Dre tells him that he just wants to overcome his fear. Thus, Dre is set to face Cheng in the final.\n\nThe match goes back and forth with Dre gaining a 2-to-1 lead. On Li's orders, Cheng attacks Dre's injured leg with a powerful kick, thus causing Dre to lose balance. Tied at two points apiece, with the next point to determine the champion, Dre struggles but manages to get up and uses the snake stance used by the woman at the temple. The move is successful, and Cheng changes his technique and charges at Dre, who does a [[backflip]] and catches Cheng in mid-air with a kick to his head defeating Cheng and Dre winning the tournament along with the respect of Cheng and his classmates. Cheng presents Dre with the trophy and all of the Fighting Dragon students bow down to Mr. Han in respect, accepting him as their new master, leaving Li defeated. Ending the movie, Dre and Mr. Han walk off happily.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nIn this alternate ending, Master Li raises his hand to slap Cheng for not beating Dre in the tournament (he uses this method to punish his disciples), but he is stopped and reprimanded by Mr. Han, who thought that Master Li's students had already suffered too much at his hands. This eventually leads to a Kung Fu battle between Mr. Han and Master Li, who end up facing off in front of a surprised audience, the frightened Fighting Dragons and a shocked, confused, and injured Dre, who even with a [[limp]], tries to go where Mr. Han is fighting, without understanding what happened.\n\nThe fight ends as Mr. Han kicks Master Li off the stage where the old master was sitting and furious, leaps from the stage towards Master Li, pinning him down and with his fist raised says against Master Li in Mandarin with a menacing tone: \"[[John Kreese|Do not stop when our enemy is down. No mercy. No mercy in studio. No mercy in competition. No mercy in life. Our enemy deserves pain]]\".\n\nDre and the Fighting Dragons watch from afar. One of the members of the Fighting Dragons tells Mr. Han to knock out Master Li. However, he is stopped by Dre, who says that Master Li has had enough of a beating. Dre and Mr. Han are congratulated by Cheng and the Fighting Dragons as they leave. In the end, Sherry (Dre's mom), along with Meiying, leave with the tournament trophy won by Dre, but not before punching Master Li for his students\u2019 actions against Dre.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters}}<!--Add Chinese names for Western characters too because this is a coproduction-->\n* [[Jaden Smith]] as [[List of The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai characters#Dre Parker|Dre Parker]] ({{zh|c=\u5fb7\u745e\u2219\u5e15\u514b|p=D\u00e9ru\u00ec P\u00e0k\u00e8|labels=no}}).
