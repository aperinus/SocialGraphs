It is a modernized [[remake]] of the 1933 [[King Kong (1933 film)|film of the same name]] about a giant [[ape]] that is captured and taken to [[New York City]] for exhibition. Featuring [[special effects]] by [[Carlo Rambaldi]], it stars [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Charles Grodin]], and [[Jessica Lange]] in her first film role. It's the 5th entry in the [[King Kong (franchise)|King Kong franchise]].\n\nThe idea to remake ''King Kong'' was conceived by [[Michael Eisner]], who was then an ABC executive, in 1974. He separately proposed the idea to [[Universal Pictures]] CEO [[Sidney Sheinberg]] and Paramount Pictures CEO [[Barry Diller]]. Dino De Laurentiis quickly acquired the film rights from [[RKO-General]] and subsequently hired television writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] to write the script. John Guillermin was hired as director and filming lasted from January to August 1976. Before the film's release, Universal Pictures sued De Laurentiis and RKO-General alleging breach of contract, and attempted to develop their own remake of ''King Kong''. In response, De Laurentiis and RKO-General filed separate countersuits against Universal Pictures, all of which were withdrawn by January 1976.\n\nThe film was released on December 17, 1976, to mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. It won a noncompetitive [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for Best Visual Effects, and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. Of the three ''King Kong'' main films, it is the only one to feature the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] instead of the [[Empire State Building]]. A sequel titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]'' was released in 1986.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn the 1970s, Fred Wilson, an executive of the Petrox Oil Company, forms an expedition based on infrared imagery which reveals a previously undiscovered [[Indian Ocean]] island hidden by a permanent cloud bank. Wilson believes the island has a huge deposit of oil. Jack Prescott, a primate [[paleontologist]], sneaks onto the expedition's vessel and attempts to warn the team against traveling to the island, citing an ominous final message about \"the roar of the greatest beast\" from previous doomed explorers. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, assuming that he is a spy from a rival corporation. Wilson eventually makes Prescott the expedition\u2019s photographer. The ship happens upon a life raft which carries the beautiful and unconscious Dwan. Upon waking, Dwan tells Prescott that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director's yacht which suddenly exploded. During the rest of the ship's voyage, Prescott and Dwan become attracted to each other.\n\nUpon arriving at the island, the team discovers a primitive tribe of [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] who live within the confines of a gigantic wall, built to protect them from a mysterious god known as Kong. The team finds that while there is a large deposit of oil, it is of such low quality that it is unusable. The natives kidnap Dwan, drug her, and offer her as a [[sacrifice]] to Kong. A monumental ape grabs Dwan from the altar and departs back into the jungle.\n\nAlthough an awesome and terrifying sight, the soft-hearted Kong quickly becomes tamed by Dwan, whose rambling monologue calms and fascinates the monstrous beast. After she falls in the mud, Kong takes Dwan back to a waterfall to wash herself, and then uses great gusts of his warm breath to dry her.\n\nIn the meantime, Prescott and First Mate Carnahan lead a rescue mission to save Dwan. The rescue party encounters Kong while crossing a log bridge over a ravine, and Kong rolls the huge log, sending Carnahan and the rest of the sailors falling to their deaths. Prescott and Boan are the only ones to survive. Kong takes Dwan to his lair. A giant snake appears and attacks the pair, and while Kong dispatches the snake, Prescott escapes with Dwan. Kong chases the pair back to the native village, only to fall into a [[Trapping pit|pit trap]] and be smothered with [[chloroform]].\n\nWithout any of the promised new oil, Wilson decides to transport Kong to America as a promotional gimmick for his company. When they finally reach New York City, Kong is put on display in a [[beauty and the beast]] farce, bound in chains with a large crown on his head. When Kong sees a group of reporters crowding around Dwan, hoping for interviews, the ape breaks free of his bonds and goes on a rampage throughout the city. In the commotion, Wilson is killed when Kong steps on him. The ape also destroys an elevated train in his search for Dwan. Prescott and Dwan flee across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] to Manhattan while Kong pursues them. Prescott calls the military and in return for a promise that Kong will be captured unharmed, he tells them that Kong will climb the World Trade Center, which resembles a mountain on his native island. Kong locates Dwan and takes her; he begins to make his way to the World Trade Center, with Jack and the military in hot pursuit.\n\nIn the climax, Kong climbs the South Tower of the World Trade Center.<ref>Kong climbed the [[Empire State Building]] in the 1933 film. The World Trade Center, completed in 1972, had replaced the Empire State Building as New York's tallest building.</ref> After being attacked by men with [[flamethrower]]s while standing on the roof, Kong leaps across to the North Tower. Then he is attacked by military helicopters while Dwan is trying to stop them. The fatally injured Kong falls from the roof to the World Trade Center plaza, where he dies from his injuries. Dwan is bombarded by a sea of [[photographer]]s. The crowd is so big, though, that Dwan can't even get close to Jack. She stands still and is photographed relentlessly by reporters while Kong lies dead in a pool of blood and broken concrete.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Jack Prescott\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Fred S.

In December 1974, [[Michael Eisner]], then an executive for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], watched the original film on television and struck on the idea for a remake. He pitched the idea to [[Barry Diller]], the chairman and CEO of [[Paramount Pictures]], who then enlisted veteran producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] to work on the project. However, De Laurentiis claimed the idea to remake ''King Kong'' was solely his own when he saw a ''Kong'' poster in his daughter's bedroom as he woke her up every morning. When Diller suggested doing a monster film with him, De Laurentiis proposed the idea to remake ''King Kong''.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\">{{cite magazine |last=Tobias |first=Andrew |title=The Battle for King Kong |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-MCAAAAMBAJ&q=the+battle+for+king+kong+new+york+magazine&pg=PA38 |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=February 23, 1976 |access-date=July 30, 2018 |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=38\u201344 |issn=0028-7369 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> Diller and De Laurentiis provisionally agreed that Paramount would pay half of the film's proposed $12 million budget in return for the distribution rights in the United States and Canada if the former could purchase the film rights of the original film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=150}}\n\nDe Laurentiis later contacted his friend [[Thomas F. O'Neil]], president of [[General Tire and Rubber Company|General Tire]] and [[RKO General|RKO-General]], who informed him that the film rights were indeed available. Later, De Laurentiis and company executive Frederic Sidewater entered formal negotiations with Daniel O'Shea, a semi-retired attorney for RKO-General, who requested a percentage of the film's gross. On May 6, 1975, De Laurentiis paid RKO-General $200,000 plus a percentage of the film's gross.<ref name=\"KingKongBattle\">{{cite news|last=Champlin|first=Charles|author-link=Charles Champlin|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/382721599/|title=A Ding-Dong King Kong Battle|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=Part IV, p. 1|date=November 5, 1975|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-access=subscription|access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> After finalizing the agreement with Paramount, De Laurentiis and Sidewater began meeting with foreign distributors and set the film's release for Christmas 1976.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=151}}\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=45%|quote=We made a very deliberate attempt not to be anything like the original movie in tone or mood.

Impressed with his work on the film, De Laurentiis contacted Semple about writing ''King Kong'', to which Semple immediately signed on. During their collaboration on the project, De Laurentiis already had two ideas in mind\u2014that the film would set in present-day and the climax would set on top of the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=152}}\n\nBecause of the risen sophistication in audiences' tastes since the original film, Semple sought to maintain a realistic tone, but infuse the script with a sly, ironic sense of humor that the audiences could laugh at. Having settled on the mood, Semple retained the basic plotline and set pieces from the original film, but updated and reworked other elements of the story. Inspired by the [[1970s energy crisis|then-ongoing energy crisis]] and a suggestion from his friend Jerry Brick, Semple changed the expedition to being mounted by Petrox Corporation, a giant petroleum conglomerate which suspected that Kong's island has unrefined oil reserves. In its original story outline, Petrox would discover Kong's island from a map hidden in the secret archives at the [[Vatican Library]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nIn a notable departure from the original film, Semple dropped the dinosaurs that are present with Kong on the island. The reasons for the dropped subplot was due to the increased attention on Kong and Dwan's love story and financial reasons as De Laurentiis did not want to use [[stop-motion animation]] in the film. Nevertheless, a giant [[boa constrictor]] was incorporated into the film.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=153}}\n\nA fast writer, Semple completed a forty-page outline within a few days and delivered it in August 1975. While De Laurentiis was pleased with Semple's outline, he expressed displeasure with the Vatican Library subplot, which was immediately dropped. It would later be replaced with Petrox discovering the island through obtained classified photos taken by a United States [[Reconnaissance satellite|spy satellite]].{{sfn|Morton|2005|pp=154\u20135}} Within a month, the 140-page first draft incorporated the character of Dwan (who according to the script was originally named Dawn until she switched the two middle letters to make it more memorable), the updated rendition of Ann Darrow from the 1933 film. For its second draft, the script was reduced to 110 pages.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=155\u20136}} The final draft was completed by December 1975.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=160}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[Meryl Streep]] has said that she was considered for the role of Dwan, but was deemed too unattractive by producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]].<ref>{{Cite episode |series=The Graham Norton Show|series-link=The Graham Norton Show  |network= [[BBC]]|series-no=16|number=13|title=Meryl Streep's worst audition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvWF20AfNS4|date=January 9, 2015}}</ref> Dwan was also proposed to [[Barbra Streisand]] but she turned it down.<ref>Medved, Michael, and Harry Medved.

Kline]]. The only time that the collaboration of Baker and Rambaldi went smoothly was during the design of the mechanical Kong mask.

However, the film makers had already got the shot they wanted of the large crowd rushing toward Kong's body.

This new ''Kong'' isn't a horror movie\u2014it's an absurdist love story.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Kael |first=Pauline |author-link=Pauline Kael |title=The Current Cinema |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1977/01/03/heres-to-the-big-one |magazine=The New Yorker |page=70 |date=January 3, 1977 |access-date=May 19, 2021}}</ref> [[Richard Schickel]] from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrote that \"The special effects are marvelous, the good-humored script is comic-bookish without being excessively campy, and there are two excellent performances\" from Charles Grodin and Kong.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Schickel |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Schickel |title=The Greening of Old Kong |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,947771,00.html |magazine=Time |date=December 27, 1976 |access-date=May 24, 2007}}</ref> Arthur D.

A short time later, Universal decided to purchase the property as an opportunity to showcase its new sound system technology, [[Sensurround]], which had debuted with the [[disaster film]] ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'', for Kong's roars. On April 5, 1975, Daniel O'Shea, a semi-retired attorney for RKO-General, had arranged meetings with Arnold Stane, attorney for MCA/Universal, and De Laurentiis and Sidewater for the film rights to ''King Kong''. Neither side knew that a rival studio was also negotiating with RKO-General. Stane had negotiated for Universal an offer of $200,000 plus 5 percent of the film's net profit. In contrast, De Laurentiis offered $200,000 plus 3 percent of the film's gross\u2014and 10 percent if the film recouped two and a half its negative cost. In May 1975, the film rights were granted to De Laurentiis.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nIn the wake of the agreement, Shane claimed that O'Shea had verbally accepted Universal's offer, although no official paperwork was signed. O'Shea contested, \"I did not make any agreement written or oral ... never told him we had an agreement, nor words to that effect ... never told him that I had the authority ... I am not an employee, agent, or officer at RKO.\"<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" /> A few days later, Universal filed suit against De Laurentiis and RKO-General in [[Los Angeles Superior Court]] for $25 million on charges of breach of contract, fraud, and intentional interference with advantageous business relations. In October 1975, Universal, which was in pre-production with its own remake with [[Hunt Stromberg, Jr.]] as producer and [[Joseph Sargent]] as director, filed suit in a federal district court arguing that the story's \"basic ingredients\" were [[public domain]].<ref name=\"KingKongBattle\" /> Universal had claimed that its remake was based on the two-part serialization by [[Edgar Wallace]] and a novelization by [[Delos W. Lovelace]] adapted from the screenplay that had been published shortly before the film's release in 1933.<ref name=\"BattleforKingKong\" />\n\nUniversal started production on ''The Legend of King Kong'' on January 5, 1976, with [[Bo Goldman]] writing the screenplay based on the novelization by Lovelace.<ref>{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Mary |title=Anjelica's Visage Wins Role |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/166074278/ |url-access=subscription |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=Part IV, p. 11 |date=November 12, 1975 |access-date=July 31, 2018 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> On November 20, RKO-General countersued Universal for $5 million alleging that ''The Legend of King Kong'' was an infringement on their copyright, and asked the court to prevent any \"announcements, representations, and statements\" on their proposed film. On December 4, De Laurentiis countersued for $90 million with charges of copyright infringement and \"unfair competition\".{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=162}} In January 1976, both studios agreed to withdraw their legal suits filed against each other.
