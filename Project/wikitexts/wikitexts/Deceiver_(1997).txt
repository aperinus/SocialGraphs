It won Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay at the 1997 [[Stockholm Film Festival]], and the Special Jury Prize at the 1998 [[Festival du Film Policier de Cognac|Cognac Police Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nTextile company heir James Wayland ([[Tim Roth]]) is accused of murdering a prostitute named Elizabeth ([[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]]), whose body was found cut in two. The murder is investigated by tough detective Kennesaw ([[Michael Rooker]]) and his less experienced partner Braxton ([[Chris Penn]]).\n\nWayland is a heavy drinker and compulsive liar, prone to memory losses and periods of violence. He is rich enough to access necessary information, however, and he soon learns his interrogators' own dark secrets - Kennesaw had an affair with Elizabeth to get back at his wife ([[Rosanna Arquette]]) for cheating on him, while Braxton has gambling debts with a bookie known as \"Mook\" ([[Ellen Burstyn]]), who is demanding $20,000 payment.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tim Roth]] as James Walter Wayland \n*[[Chris Penn]] as Detective Phillip Braxton  \n*[[Ellen Burstyn]] as \"Mook\"   \n*[[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Elizabeth  \n*[[Michael Rooker]] as Detective Edward Kennesaw  \n*[[Rosanna Arquette]] as Mrs. Kennesaw    \n*[[Michael Parks]] as Dr. Banyard\n*[[Mark Damon]] as Wayland's father\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0119527|Deceiver}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|deceiver}}\n* {{Mojo title|deceiver}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s mystery films]]\n[[Category:1990s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American mystery films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American nonlinear narrative films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Harry Gregson-Williams]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jonas Pate]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{crime-thriller-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
