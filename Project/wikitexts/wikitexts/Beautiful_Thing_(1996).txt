The atmosphere of the film is heavily influenced by a soundtrack consisting almost entirely of the music of [[The Mamas & the Papas]] and [[Cass Elliot|\"Mama\" Cass Elliot]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is set and filmed on [[Thamesmead]], a working class area of South East London dominated by post-war [[council estates]].<ref>{{cite news|work=The Times|date=3 August 1993|title=If only things were so simple|author=Benedict Nightingale|quote=Into the Bush we go and what strikes our eager eyes? Concrete paving, grey stucco walls, drab doors with 368, 369 and 370 embossed on them, and, as a feeble protest against the gloom, a few flowerpots and plaster dwarfs. This is the third floor of a council estate in Thamesmead, and as unlikely a setting for a play called Beautiful Thing as Buckingham Palace's gardens would be for Les Miserables.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=Evening Standard|date=24 November 1994|title=The council cries foul play|page=43|quote=Jonathan Harvey's West End hit Beautiful Thing is 'sickening' \u2013 that's official \u2013 as far as Bexley Borough Council is concerned. Harvey's play, about gay love is, of course, set in Thamesmead, part of which falls under the council's aegis. You might think fame for the borough would fill the breast of Bexley Tory councillor Graham R Holland, but no. The Duke of York's Theatre last week received a very severe letter from him on the council's headed paper. It criticises the billing of Harvey's gay love story as a comedy, and says the Holland family were 'intimidated' by gays in the bar and that they found 'the sight of older men with young lads was sickening, if legal'. He goes on to complain about the play's 'sordid' language: 'It was gratuitous, foul and offensive and was neither relevant nor, with my experience of Thamesmead ... in any way typical of the young people with whom I am in contact.' The shocked family group left after 20 minutes.}}</ref>\n\nThe main character, Jamie ([[Glen Berry]]), is a teenager who is in love with his classmate, Ste. Jamie's single mother, Sandra ([[Linda Henry]]), is pre-occupied with ambitious plans to run her own [[pub]] and has an ever-changing string of lovers; the latest of these is Tony ([[Ben Daniels]]), a neo-[[hippie]].\n\nSandra finds herself at odds with Leah ([[Tameka Empson]]), a sassy and rude neighbour who has been expelled from school, takes a variety of drugs, and constantly listens and sings along to her mother's [[Cass Elliot]] records. While Jamie's [[homosexuality]] remains concealed, his introverted nature and dislike of football are reason enough for his classmates to bully him at every opportunity.\n\nSte ([[Scott Neal]]), who is living together with his drug-dealing brother and abusive, alcoholic father in the flat next door to Sandra and Jamie's, is beaten by his brother so badly that Sandra takes pity and lets him sleep over one night. In the absence of a third bed, Ste has to make do with sleeping 'top-to-toe' with Jamie. On the second night they share a bed, the boys change sleeping arrangements and Jamie kisses Ste for the first time.\n\nThe next morning, Ste panics, leaves the flat before Jamie has awakened, and avoids him for days. Jamie works up the nerve to steal a ''[[Gay Times]]'' from a newsagent, apparently starting to accept his sexuality and affection for Ste. Jamie finally spots Ste at a nearby party and confronts him about his sexuality; they prepare to leave together. The party ends badly, with Sandra taking vengeance on Leah for gossiping. Leah then threatens to 'spill the beans' about Ste and Jamie and confesses to having covered up for Ste in front of his father and brother. Ste reacts by angrily rejecting Jamie and running away.\n\nSlowly, Ste accepts Jamie's love. Their relationship develops as they visit a [[Gay bar|gay pub]] together. Sandra follows them and discovers their secret. The film reaches its climax as a [[bad trip]] by Leah (on an unnamed drug) precipitates Sandra's breakup with Tony, the news of Sandra's new job comes out, and Sandra confronts Ste and Jamie about their relationship. Sandra comes to accept her son's sexuality.\n\nThe film ends with the two boys slow-dancing in the courtyard of their council flats to the [[Cass Elliot]] song \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\" while a protective Sandra dances defiantly at their side with Leah as the local residents look on. Some onlookers are shocked, some strongly disapprove and some enjoy the moment.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Actor\n!
