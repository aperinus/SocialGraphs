The film features human characters animated using [[live-action]] and [[motion-capture]] CGI animation. It tells the story of a young boy who, on [[Christmas Eve]], sees a mysterious train bound for the [[North Pole]] stop outside his window and is invited aboard by its conductor. The boy joins several other children as they embark on a journey to visit Santa Claus preparing for Christmas. The film stars [[Tom Hanks]], also one of the film's executive producers, in multiple distinct roles, with [[Daryl Sabara]], [[Nona Gaye]], [[Jimmy Bennett]] and [[Eddie Deezen]] in supporting roles.\n\n[[Castle Rock Entertainment]] produced the film in association with [[Shangri-La Entertainment]], [[ImageMovers]], [[Playtone]], and Golden Mean Productions for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], as Castle Rock's first CGI-animated film. Its CGI visual effects and CGI performance capture were done at [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]. The film was made with a production budget of $165\u2013170 million, a record-breaking sum for an animated feature at the time.\n\n''The Polar Express'' was released in the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] on October 13, 2004 and the United States on November 10, 2004. The film was originally a [[Box-office bomb|box office disappointment]] upon release, grossing $286 million against a $165\u2013170 million budget.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why is the $170-million 'Polar Express' getting derailed? |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-nov-17-et-polar17-story.html |access-date=July 20, 2022 |website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> However, later re-releases helped propel the film's gross to $314 million worldwide. The film was later listed in the 2006 ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the first all-digital capture film. The film also marks [[Michael Jeter]]'s last acting role before his death, and the film was thus dedicated to his memory.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rooney|first1=David|title=Review: 'The Polar Express'|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|access-date=December 10, 2014|work=Variety|date=October 24, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226224253/http://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/the-polar-express-3-1200530031/|archive-date=December 26, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nOn the night of [[Christmas Eve]], a steam locomotive passenger train known as the Polar Express stops at the house of a boy who is growing skeptical about the existence of [[Santa Claus]]. The conductor says the train is traveling to the [[North Pole]], and the boy, although reluctant at first, climbs aboard and meets a spirited girl and a know-it-all called Garrison. The train then stops to pick up a boy named Billy. At first, Billy refuses to board, but he changes his mind just as the train starts to leave, prompting the boy to apply the emergency brake. Billy is allowed on, but decides to sit alone in the [[observation car]]. The children are then served [[hot chocolate]] by a team of singing and dancing waiters, and the girl saves a cup for Billy. The conductor and the girl go to give Billy his cup, but the boy notices that the girl's ticket has not yet been validated. When he tries to take it to the girl, the wind takes the ticket to the wilderness, but it soon finds its way back into the train; after the girl discovers that her ticket is missing, the conductor leaves with her. Presuming that she will be thrown off the train, the boy finds the ticket and traverses the rooftops of the train to find the girl.\n\nThe boy encounters a mysterious [[ghost]]ly [[hobo]] that takes him to the engine, where the girl has been put in charge since the driver and fireman are busy replacing the headlight. As the train continues on, it moves at an extreme speed due to the [[split pin|cotter pin]] shearing off, and the train starts rocketing down Glacier Gulch. Once they reach a frozen lake, the fireman uses his hair pin to replace the new cotter pin and the driver narrowly gets the train onto the tracks on the other side of the lake after the ice breaks.\n\nOnce the boy and the girl are safe, the conductor takes them back to their seats. They soon find Billy singing to himself at the end of the caboose. The train arrives at the North Pole, where the conductor announces that one of the children will be chosen to receive the first gift of Christmas from Santa himself. Seeing Billy still alone in the observation car, the girl and boy persuade him to join them. However, the boy accidentally uncouples the car, sending it hurtling along a route towards a [[railway turntable]] inside Santa's workshop. The children make their way through an [[Christmas elf|elf]] command center and a gift-sorting office facility, where Billy finds a present in his name, before being dumped into a giant sack of presents, where they also find Garrison. After the sack is loaded onto Santa's sleigh, the elves escort them out before Santa and his reindeer arrive.\n\nA bell flies loose from the galloping reindeer's reins; the boy initially cannot hear it ring, until he finds it within himself to believe. He returns the bell to Santa, who selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas. Santa agrees to let him keep the bell, and the boy places it in his robe pocket. As the children board to go home, the boy discovers that he lost the bell through a hole in his pocket. The boy arrives home, and the conductor wishes him a Merry Christmas. He awakens on Christmas morning to find a present containing his lost bell with a note from Santa. He and his younger sister Sarah joyfully ring the bell, but their parents do not hear it because they do not believe in Santa. The boy reflects on his friends and sister eventually growing deaf to the bell over the years as their belief faded. However, despite the fact he is now an adult, the bell still rings for him, as it does \"for all who truly believe\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Michael Jeter at the 44th Emmy Awards cropped.jpg|175px|right|thumb|The film marks the last performance of actor [[Michael Jeter]]; Jeter died the year before the film's release and is dedicated in his memory.]]\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Hero Boy (adult voice), Hero Boy's father, Conductor, Hobo, Santa Claus and [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] puppet\n** [[Josh Hutcherson]] as Hero Boy (additional motion-capture)\n**  [[Daryl Sabara]] as Hero Boy (child voice)\n* [[Nona Gaye]] as Hero Girl\n** Darrian O Driscoll as Hero Girl (additional motion-capture)\n** Meagan Moore as Hero Girl (singing voice)\n** [[Tinashe]] as Hero Girl (motion-capture model)\n* [[Peter Scolari]] as Billy the Lonely Boy (motion-capture)\n** Hayden McFarland as Billy the Lonely Boy (additional motion-capture)\n** [[Jimmy Bennett]] as Billy the Lonely Boy (voice)\n** [[Matthew Hall (actor)|Matthew Hall]] as Billy the Lonely Boy (singing voice)\n* [[Eddie Deezen]] as Know-it-all (Garrison)\n** [[Jimmy Pinchak]] as Garrison (additional motion-capture)\n* [[Michael Jeter]] as Smokey and Steamer\n** [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] as Smokey and Steamer (additional voice)<ref>Schaub, David (November 15, 2005). \"[https://www.awn.com/vfxworld/polar-express-diary-part-4-keyframe-animation 'The Polar Express Diary': Part 4 -- Keyframe Animation]\".
