The film was inspired by Jones's children's book ''[[The Saga of Erik the Viking]]'' (1983), but the plot is completely different. Jones also appears in the film as King Arnulf.<ref name=\"latimes\" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Jones |first=Terry |author-link=Terry Jones |title=Erik the Viking: the Screenplay |publisher=Applause Theatre Book Publishers |year=1989 |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZonRXUdAEzkC  |isbn =1-55783-054-1}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nErik, a young Viking, discovers that he has no taste for rape and pillage, and suffers guilt over the death of an innocent woman, Helga.\n\nErik learns from the wise woman [[Freya]] that [[Fenrisulfr|Fenrir]] the wolf has swallowed the sun, plunging the world into the age of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Erik resolves to travel to [[Asgard]] to petition the gods to end Ragnar\u00f6k. Freya informs him that to do so he must seek the [[Gjallarhorn|Horn Resounding]] in the land of [[Brazil (mythical island)|Hy-Brasil]]. The first note blown upon the Horn will take Erik and his crew to Asgard, the second will awaken the gods, and the third will bring the crew home. Erik sets out with a crew of all ages and professions from his village, including Harald, a Christian missionary who does not believe the myths.\n\nKeitel Blacksmith is persuaded by his apprentice [[Loki]] into secretly opposing Erik's plan, and joins Erik's crew in order to sabotage Erik's plans. Loki sneaks out to inform [[Halfdan the Black]], a local warlord afraid that peace will mean the end of his reign. Halfdan's crew sets sail in pursuit of Erik.\n\nArriving at Hy-Brasil, Erik and crew are astonished to find it a sunlit land where the people, who dress like ancient Greeks, are exceedingly friendly and hospitable (if musically untalented). Erik promptly falls in love with Princess Aud, daughter of King Arnulf. During one of their romantic encounters, Erik hides from Arnulf using Aud's magic cloak of invisibility.\n\nAud has warned the Vikings that should blood ever be shed upon Hy-Brasil, the entire island would sink beneath the waves. Erik and his crew defend Hy-Brasil against Halfdan's ship. Loki is found aboard the ship, and pretends to have sneaked aboard to sabotage it. In gratitude for Erik's having saved Hy-Brasil, King Arnulf presents him with the Horn Resounding, which is much larger than Erik had imagined. Loki steals the Horn's mouthpiece in the night, without which it cannot be sounded, and persuades Keitel to throw it in the sea. Snorri, one of Erik's men, catches them in the act and Loki kills him. A single drop of the man's blood falls from Loki's dagger and triggers an earthquake that causes the island to sink.\n\nErik's crew prepare to escape in their ship with Aud and the Horn safely aboard. Arnulf refuses to join them, denying that the island is sinking, up to the very moment he and the other islanders are swallowed by the waves. Aud, who witnessed Snorri's murder and was able to recover the mouthpiece, sounds the first note on the Horn. The ship is propelled over the edge of the flat Earth and into space, where it comes to rest upon the plane of Asgard. Erik sounds the second note to awaken the gods, and he and his crew climb a path made of stars to approach the great Hall of [[Valhalla]].\n\nErik and the crew encounter old friends and enemies slain in battle. The gods are revealed to be petulant children who have no interest in answering mortal prayers.  Harald the missionary sees neither hall, nor ghosts or gods, and passes intangibly through its walls due to his Christianity. [[Odin]] persuades Fenrir to spit out the sun, but tells Erik that the end of Ragnar\u00f6k will not bring peace to the world. Odin then informs Erik that he and his crew cannot return home. Nor may they remain in Valhalla, since they were not slain in battle; instead they are to be cast into the fiery Pit of [[Hel (realm)|Hel]]. Some of the crew who died earlier in the adventure attempt to save them, but even as they are drawn into the Pit, they hear the Horn Resounding's third note, blown by Harald, who had returned to the ship, which flings them clear.\n\nErik's crew, including the formerly dead men, immediately find themselves back in their home village. They are dismayed to find that Halfdan and his soldiers have arrived before them and are holding the villagers captive. Halfdan and his men are suddenly crushed to death by Erik's ship as it falls out of the sky, with Harald aboard. As the villagers celebrate Erik's return and Halfdan's defeat, the sun rises, ending the age of Ragnar\u00f6k.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Erik\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Erik's grandfather\n* [[Eartha Kitt]] as [[Freya]]\n* [[Terry Jones]] as King Arnulf\n* [[Imogen Stubbs]] as Princess Aud\n* [[John Cleese]] as Halfdan the Black\n* [[Antony Sher]] as [[Loki]]\n* [[Charles McKeown]] as Sven's Dad\n* [[Tim McInnerny]] as Sven the Berserk\n* [[John Gordon Sinclair]] as Ivar the Boneless\n* [[Richard Ridings]] as Thorfinn Skullsplitter\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as Harald the Missionary\n* [[Samantha Bond]] as Helga\n* Danny Schiller as Snorri the Miserable\n* Gary Cady as Keitel Blacksmith\n* Matyelok Gibbs as Erik's Mum\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Ernest the Viking\n* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] as Jennifer the Viking\n*[[Graham McTavish]] as Thangbrand \n* [[Neil Innes]] as Hy-Brasilian\n* [[Allan Surtees]] as Thorfinn's Dad\n* Simon Evans as [[Odin]]\n* Matthew Baker as [[Thor]]\n* [[Tsutomu Sekine]] as Slavemaster\n* [[John Scott Martin]] as Ingemund The Old\n}}\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography took place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England.

The music score was composed by [[Neil Innes]].\n\n''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' star [[Tom Hulce]] was originally going to star as Erik, but he decided instead to pursue his stage career.\n\nThe production by the [[Monty Python]] company Prominent Features received financial backing from Swedish [[Svensk Filmindustri]], which contributed to the film having its premiere in Sweden on 1 September 1989, followed by the US on 22 September, and the UK on 29 September.
