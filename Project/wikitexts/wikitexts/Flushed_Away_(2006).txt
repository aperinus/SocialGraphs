In the film, a pampered pet mouse named Roddy St. James is flushed down the [[toilet]] in his Kensington apartment by a sewer rat named Sid, and befriends a scavenger named Rita Malone in order to get back home while evading a sinister toad and his hench-rats.\n\nThe film was released in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] on 3 November 2006, and in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2006. Despite receiving positive reviews, ''Flushed Away'' [[Box-office bomb|underperformed at the box office]], prompting DreamWorks to end their partnership with Aardman. The film received nominations for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film|BAFTA Award]] and [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature|Critics' Choice Award]] for Best Animated Feature. It also got 8 nominations at the [[34th Annie Awards]], winning a leading 5, including [[Annie Award for Writing in a Feature Production|Writing in a Feature Production]], and [[Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production|Voice Acting in a Feature Production]] award for Ian McKellen. The film would serve as Aardman's biggest box office bomb until 2018, as ''[[Early Man (film)|Early Man]]'' earned less money that year.\n\n== Plot ==\nRoddy St. James is a pampered pet mouse who lives in a large [[Kensington]] apartment. While his owners are gone away on holiday, a sewer rat named Sid spews out of the sink's drain and decides to stay and watch the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]]. Roddy attempts to get rid of Sid by flushing down the [[toilet]], but instead gets flushed down the sewers by Sid.\n\nRoddy finds himself in Ratropolis, a sewer city made out of various bits of junk that resembles [[London]]. He is told to seek out Rita Malone, an enterprising scavenger mouse who works the drains in her faithful boat, the ''[[Jammie Dodgers|Jammy Dodger]]'' who can possibly help him get home. Roddy and Rita are abducted by rats Spike and Whitey and brought before their boss, the Toad, as Rita stole back a prized [[ruby]] originally scavenged by her father. The Toad plans to have Roddy and Rita frozen with [[liquid nitrogen]], but the pair escape. Rita takes the ruby, and a unique electric master cable required to control Ratropolis' sewer floodgates.\n\nRoddy deduces that the ruby is a fake and easily shatters it, enraging Rita. Roddy offers Rita a real ruby if she takes him back to Kensington, to which she agrees. The pair first stop to visit her family before setting off. During Roddy's stay, he overhears a conversation that causes him to assume that Rita is selling him out to the Toad, so he reneges on the deal and steals the ''Jammy Dodger''. When Rita catches up to him, she is able to clear up the misunderstanding. The pair evade pursuit from Spike, Whitey, and their accomplices.\n\nIncensed at his minions' repeated failures, the Toad sends for his French cousin, Le Frog. It is revealed that the Toad was [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]]' favorite childhood pet until he was abruptly replaced by a rat and flushed down a toilet, resulting in his hatred of rodents. Le Frog and his subordinates intercept Roddy and Rita to retrieve the cable, but the duo manages to escape out of the sewer drain and back to Roddy's apartment, though the ''Jammy Dodger'' is destroyed.\n\nRoddy pays Rita the promised ruby and an emerald, then shows her around his apartment. She at first believes he has family, but notices his cage and realizes he is a pet and alone. Rita tries to persuade Roddy to come with her, but he is too proud to admit his loneliness and rebuffs her. Rita leaves the apartment via the toilet only for her to be captured, with the Toad taking back the master cable. Roddy joins Sid to watch the game. When Sid mentions half-time, Roddy pieces together the Toad's plan: to open the floodgates during half-time of the World Cup, when all the humans will most likely be using their toilets, allowing the ensuing, enormous wave of drainage to destroy Ratropolis, allowing the Toad to use the depopulated city as a home for his tadpole children. Roddy entrusts Sid with his home and cushy position, and has Sid flush him back down the sewers again. He frees Rita, and together they defeat the Toad and his henchman by getting Toad and Le Frog\u2019s tongues stuck to moving gears and freeze the wave of drainage with liquid nitrogen. Hailed as a hero, Roddy agrees to stay in Ratropolis with Rita. Soon after, the two, as well as Rita's family, set off on the ''Jammy Dodger II''.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as Roddy St. James, a pampered but lonely pet [[mouse]] with a British accent who lives in a Kensington luxury apartment with a [[wealthy]] British family. He is flushed down the toilet by Sid the sewer rat into the sewer drains.\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Rita Malone, a street-wise and rather mean-spirited scavenger [[mouse]] and the oldest child of a large family. She is the captain of The Jammy Dodger and Roddy's love interest later girlfriend.\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as the Toad, the main antagonist of the film and a proud/tyrannical [[amphibian]] wanting the entire population of Ratropolis to be killed off so he can make room for his hundreds of off-spring. For his performance, Ian McKellen won the [[Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production]].\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Le Frog, the Toad's French cousin. He refers to the Toad as \"my warty English cousin\". He masters martial arts and is the leader of a team of hench-frogs.\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as Spike, one of the Toad's two top hench-rats. He is the quicker-witted and more aggressive of the two.\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Whitey, another of the Toad's two top hench-rats. Whitey is an [[albino]] rat, and Spike's partner. Unlike Spike, Whitey is sympathetic and less vicious but is also ignorant and gullible.\n* [[Shane Richie]] as Sid, an [[Obesity|over-weight]] and [[Slacker|lazy]] [[Fancy rat|pet rat]] from the sewer drain. He is an acquaintance of Rita and her family, and the one who flushes Roddy down the toilet into the sewer drains.\n* [[Kathy Burke]] and [[David Suchet]] as Mr. and Mrs. Malone, Rita's parents\n* [[Miriam Margolyes]] as Rita's grandmother, who has a crush on Roddy mistaking him for [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]].\n* Rachel Rawlinson as Tabitha, Roddy's former human owner.\n* [[Christopher Fairbank]] as Thimblenose Ted, another henchman that serves as the Toad's third-best enforcer after Spike and Whitey. Fairbank also voiced the cockroach living in the Malone household.\n\n== Production ==\nThe idea for a film about rats that fall in love in sewers was proposed by animator [[Sam Fell]] during the production of Aardman Animation's ''[[Chicken Run]]'' (2000).<ref name=AWNAdventuresInCG /> At the time, Aardman encouraged everyone at the company to come up with ideas for features for the DreamWorks partnership.<ref name=AWNAdventuresInCG /> In 2001, Fell, development executive Mike Cooper, and producer [[Peter Lord]] then developed the concept into a story before pitching it to DreamWorks.<ref name=AWNAdventuresInCG /> The film was first announced in July 2002, and in what was then a surprise move, it was revealed as being Aardman's very first CGI feature project. Lord described the pitch as \"''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' with the gender roles reversed\".<ref name=AWNAdventuresInCG /> After the film was announced, Comic writing duo [[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian La Frenais]] were contracted to write the script,<ref name=AWNAdventuresInCG>{{cite web|last1=Pennington|first1=Adrian|title=Peter Lord's Aardman Adventures in CGI|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/peter-lord-s-aardman-adventures-cg|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|access-date=13 June 2015|date=1 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331233108/https://www.awn.com/animationworld/peter-lord-s-aardman-adventures-cg|archive-date=31 March 2014}}</ref> which had the working title ''Ratropolis''.
