Despite negative reviews, ''Encino Man'' was a box-office success, grossing $40.7 million worldwide on a $7 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> It was followed by a [[Television film|made-for-television]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], ''Encino Woman'', in 1996.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Film summaries must be less than 700 words. -->\nDuring the first [[ice age]], a [[caveman]] attempts to make fire with his cavewoman partner. An earthquake causes a [[cave-in]] that buries the two of them.\n\nIn a present-day [[Los Angeles]], an earthquake awakens average teenager Dave Morgan. He, along with his best friend Stoney, strives to attain popularity in [[high school]], but comes off more like a reject or an outcast. Dave is in love with Robyn Sweeney, a sweet and attractive girl who had been his best friend during grade school, and until she reached adolescence, had been rejected by Dave on several occasions. Her boyfriend, Matt Wilson, is a jock and a bully, who constantly humiliates Dave and Stoney, usually directly due to Dave's affections toward Robyn.\n\nOne day, while digging a pool in his backyard, Dave comes across a chunk of ice that has the body of a man in it. He leaves the ice block unattended in the garage and space heaters left on cause the ice to melt, releasing the caveman.\n\nWhen the boys return home, they find hand paint covering the walls and the house in disarray. Investigating a beeping smoke alarm, they discover the caveman in Dave's bedroom, attempting to start a fire. At first, he panics at the sight of them and the sound of a telephone, but Stoney uses the flame of a lighter to mesmerize and calm him. After bathing him and trimming him to look like an average teenager, Dave names him \"Link\" as in the [[Missing link (human evolution)|missing link]].\n\nThey manage to get him some clothes and fool Dave's parents and sister into thinking he is actually an [[Estonia]]n exchange student sent to live with them. They enroll him in school, where Link's bizarre behavior and supreme athletic skills shoot Dave and Stoney to popularity by association. This allows Dave to get closer to Robyn, causing Matt's anger and frustration.\n\nSoon, Stoney's bizarre attitude apparently is having an effect on Link's actions and speech, which causes a rift between Dave and Stoney. Matt's anger and frustration leads to a fight with Link at a skating rink and increases due to Robyn's growing attraction towards Link.\n\nDuring a school field trip to a [[natural history]] museum, Link gets upset realizing that the cavepeople he knew are all dead. Stoney and Dave console Link that he is not without friends in this time, causing the trio to make a pact. During [[Driver's ed]], Link drives away in a car with Dave, Stoney, and Robyn in it, they stop at a dance club and Dave and Link are arrested. Dave, who has had enough of Link's shenanigans and upset that Robyn chooses to go to the prom with Link, tries to abandon him, and a fight between Dave and Stoney causes Link to come running back and separate the friends. Stoney and Dave reconcile.\n\nOn [[Prom|prom night]], Link is a hit at the party with Robyn as his date, while Dave stays in for the evening. Matt breaks into Dave's bedroom and steals photographic evidence that Link is a caveman. As Dave and Stoney go after Matt and his friends, another earthquake happens. Matt uncovers the \"freak\" at the prom, but his plan backfires, as the information makes Link even more popular. Dave and Robyn make up, and the three boys lead the entire prom in an impromptu caveman-like dance.\n\nAfter the prom, some of the students attend Dave's house for a pool party, where Dave and Robyn kiss. Meanwhile, Stoney and Link follow clues similar to when they found him ranging from breast prints on the slider and paint covering the walls. They follow the muddy footprints to the bathroom and discover a beautiful cavewoman in the bathtub, who turns out to be Link's partner from the beginning of the film. He joins her in the bathtub as Stoney cheers them on and embraces her happily. She is also made to look like a modern human.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sean Astin]] as David \"Dave\" Morgan\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Linkavitch \"Link\" Chomofsky\n* [[Megan Ward]] as Robyn Sweeney\n* [[Mariette Hartley]] as Betty Morgan\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Larry Morgan\n* [[Pauly Shore]] as Stanley \"Stoney\" Brown\n* [[Michael DeLuise]] as Matt Wilson\n* [[Robin Tunney]] as Ella\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Mr. Brush\n* [[Patrick Van Horn]] as Phil\n* [[Dalton James]] as Will\n* [[Esther Scott]] as Mrs. Evelyn Mackey\n* [[Ke Huy Quan|Jonathan Ke Quan]] as Kim\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Nora\n* [[Michole White]] as Kathleen\n* Ellen Blain as Tenna Morgan\n* [[Sandra Hess]] as Cave Nug\n* Mike Diamente as Steve Morgan\n* [[Erick Avari]] as Raji\n* [[Gerry Bednob]] as Kashmir\n* [[Infectious Grooves]] (cameo appearance)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Encino Man'' was directed by [[Les Mayfield]], a veteran of behind-the-scenes promotional documentaries, making his feature-film debut.

The film tested well with teen audiences, and Mayfield thanked ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'', which was released three months before ''Encino Man'', for showing a comedy aimed at this demographic could do well.<ref name=\"latimes-inside\">{{cite news |title=A look inside Hollywood and the movies : SUMMERTIME BRUISE : Who Dares Intrude During the Season of the Giants?
