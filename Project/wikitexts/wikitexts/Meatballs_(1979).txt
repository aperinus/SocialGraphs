It is noted for [[Bill Murray]]'s first film appearance in a starring role and for launching the directing career of Reitman, whose later comedies include ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981) and ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), both starring Murray.\n\nThe film was the highest-grossing Canadian film of all time in the United States and Canada, winning the [[Golden Screen Award (Canada)|Golden Reel Award]]. It is the first of six film collaborations between Murray and [[Harold Ramis]] and several [[sequel]]s, of which only ''[[Meatballs III: Summer Job]]'' (1986) had any connection to the original.\n\n==Plot==\nTripper Harrison leads a group of new counsellors-in-training (CITs) at Camp North Star, a cut-rate [[summer camp]] located in [[Ontario]], and leads practical jokes on camp director Morty Melnick, mainly by taking Melnick from his cabin late at night so that he awakens in unusual places.\n\nRudy Gerner, a lonely boy whose mother died about a year earlier, is sent to summer camp by his [[workaholic]] father, but decides to run away. Noticing Rudy is lacking self-confidence, Tripper tracks him to a nearby bus station and takes him under his wing. They rapidly bond as friends after many morning jogs. Tripper helps Rudy gain confidence while Rudy encourages the reluctant Tripper to start a romance with Roxanne, the girls' head counsellor. Many of the CITs also find romance: Candace \"kidnaps\" Crockett in a speedboat and confesses her feelings for him, while Wheels, who had broken up with A.L. the year before, successfully rekindles their relationship during a dance, and the nerdy Spaz falls for the [[tomboy]] Jackie.\n\nA subplot deals with North Star's rivalry with Camp Mohawk, a wealthy summer camp located across the lake. During a basketball game, North Star is being beaten by Mohawk when they attempt their own perverse form of victory. This sets the stage for the yearly [[Olympiad]] between the camps, which Mohawk has won 12 consecutive times.\n\nDuring the first day of competition, Mohawk dominates North Star, often winning by cheating. Crockett fails to clear the high jump bar, Hardware gets pummelled in boxing, and Jackie suffers a broken ankle in [[field hockey]], thanks to the dirty work of two Mohawk girls. The score at the end of Day One is: Mohawk 170, North Star 63. That evening at the North Star Lodge, Tripper rouses the demoralized campers by explaining that victory or defeat is unimportant. In unison, Camp North Star begins to chant, \"It just doesn't matter!\" Day Two of the Olympiad belongs to newly inspired North Star as they win every event. Wheels outwrestles his opponent, Spaz defeats Rhino in a stacking contest with inspiration from Jackie and a thwarted Mohawk cheating attempt, and, after 12 years of North Star defeats, Fink finally beats \"The Stomach\" in the Frankfurter/Wiener-eating contest. North Star now trails by only 10 points with one event left, a four-mile [[cross country running|cross country run]] for 20 points. Tripper offers to select a surprised Rudy to compete against Horse, Mohawk's star runner. Rudy's many mornings spent jogging and training with Tripper pay off as he wins the race, giving North Star its first Olympiad victory by a score of 230\u2013220.\n\nLater that evening, Morty, Tripper, Roxanne, and the CITs sing around a campfire and say their final goodbyes as the camp prepares to close at the end of summer. Rudy has already decided to return to camp next year and Roxanne agrees to live with Tripper. The two ride off on Tripper's motorcycle, leading the buses out of camp and leaving Morty behind, in bed, on a raft in the middle of the lake.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits and order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Bill Murray]] as \"Tripper\" Harrison\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Morty \"Mickey\" Melnick\n* [[Kate Lynch]] as Roxanne\n* [[Russ Banham]] as Bobby Crockett\n* [[Kristine DeBell]] as A.L.\n* [[Sarah Torgov]] as Candace\n* [[Jack Blum]] as \"Spaz\"\n* [[Keith Knight (actor)|Keith Knight]] as Larry \"Fink\" Finkelstein\n* Cindy Girling as Wendy\n* Todd Hoffman as \"Wheels\"\n* Margot Pinvidic as Jackie\n* [[Matt Craven]] as \"Hardware\" Renzetti (billed as Matt Cravenn)\n* Norma Dell\u2019Agnese as Brenda\n* [[Chris Makepeace]] as Rudy Gerner\n* Ruth Rennie as Jody\n* [[Hadley Kay]] as Bradley\n\n==Production==\n[[Harold Ramis]] said that Reitman did not know for certain whether Murray would be in the film until he showed up for the third day of filming.<ref name=\"GQ\">{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Brett |date=July 2009 |title=Harold Ramis Gets the Last Laugh |journal=[[GQ]] |pages=64\u201367, 124\u201325 |url=http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_9558&pageNum=3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701134926/http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_9558&pageNum=3 |archive-date=2009-07-01 |access-date=2009-06-22 |quote= Bill left Ivan hanging, though.
