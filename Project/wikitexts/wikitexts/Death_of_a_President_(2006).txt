Bush]], the 43rd and at the time, incumbent [[President of the United States|U.S. President]], on 19 October 2007 in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. The film is presented as a [[future history]] [[docudrama]] and uses actors, archival video footage as well as computer-generated special effects to present the hypothetical aftermath the event had on [[Civil liberties in the United States|civil liberties]], [[racial profiling]], journalistic [[sensationalism]] and [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]].\n\n==Plot==\nBroadcast in the year 2008, the film is presented in a TV documentary style format, combining [[pundit (expert)|talking head]] interviews, news coverage clips and [[video surveillance]] footage surrounding the assassination of U.S. President George W. Bush in [[Chicago]] around a year earlier on 19 October 2007. The president is fatally shot by a [[sniper]] after he addresses an economic forum at the Chicago [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton Hotel]], before which an [[Opposition to the Iraq War|anti-war]] rally had taken place. News outlets immediately begin reporting on the incident along with its political ramifications. After authorities earlier arrest and interrogate war-protesting detainees, Jamal Abu Zikri (Malik Bader), an [[Information technology|IT]] professional of [[Syrian people|Syrian]] origin,  becomes the prime suspect.\n\nVice President [[Dick Cheney]], now president, uses the possible [[al-Qaeda]] relationship in connection with the suspected assassin, Zikri, to push his own domestic political security agenda. He calls for the legislation of [[Patriot Act|PATRIOT Act]] III, trying to increase the investigative powers of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[Law enforcement in the United States|police]], and other government agencies over American citizens and foreign residents as he contemplates attacking [[Syria]].\n\nAs his wife Zahra (Hend Ayoub) listens to the verdict with family attorney Dawn Norton (Patricia Buckley) in a packed courtroom, Zikri is convicted of killing the U.S. President and sentenced to death based upon dubious [[Forensics|forensic]] evidence. Meanwhile, a new report which surfaces, substantiated by interviews with Marianne Claybon (Chavez Ravine), indicates that the perpetrator is most likely her husband Al Claybon (Tony Dale), a veteran of the [[Gulf War|1991 Persian Gulf War]], who lived in [[Rock Island, Illinois]], and who also was the father of David Claybon, a U.S. soldier recently killed in the [[Iraq War]]. The assassin, who blames President Bush for the death of his son, killed himself after Bush's assassination. Claybon's suicide note, addressed to a second son, Casey Claybon (Neko Parham), an Iraq War veteran living in Chicago who was previously considered as a suspect, reads:\n\n{{blockquote|Everything I stood for and raised you to stand for has turned bad. There's no honor in dying for an immoral cause. For lies. I love my country, but I love God, and the sons He gave me even more. I must do the right thing by you and by David. George Bush killed our David, and I cannot forgive him for that.}}\n\nTen months after President Bush's assassination, Zikri remains on [[death row]] at the [[Stateville Correctional Center]], because government officials are deliberately delaying his legal appeal. Moreover, in his dead father's Rock Island house, Casey Claybon finds evidence of his father's planning of the shooting. The most incriminating piece of evidence is a copy of a [[classified information|top secret]] presidential itinerary outlining, to the minute, President Bush's Chicago whereabouts on 19 October 2007. The news report ends while the U.S. Government continues investigating how presidential assassin Al Claybon obtained that top secret document.\n\nThe final closing titles of the film inform the viewer that President Cheney's USA PATRIOT Act III was signed into permanent law in the U.S., stating the following: ''\"It has granted investigators unprecedented powers of detention and surveillance, and further expanded the powers of the executive branch\"''.\n\n==Cast==\n*Hend Ayoub as Zahra Abu Zikri, the wife of convicted assassin Jamal Abu Zikri. She comes to believe her family has been targeted by authorities due to their Middle-Eastern heritage.\n*Brian Boland as Larry Stafford, lead [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent assigned to the president. He ultimately failed in preventing the president from being assassinated, as he discusses the day's events and security precautions leading up to the tragedy.\n*[[Becky Ann Baker]] as Eleanor Drake, personal advisor to the president. She dutifully assisted in preparing his speeches and was one of the first few people to learn of his death at the hospital.\n*Robert Mangiardi as Greg Turner, First Deputy of the Chicago police department, in charge of coordinating security arrangements for the war protest as well as handling the blocking off of city streets for the presidential motorcade. He expresses his displeasure with the violent tone of the protesting public.\n*[[Jay Patterson]] as Sam McCarthy, [[White House]] correspondent for ''[[The Washington Post]]''. From time to time, he expresses his disapproval with the government's basis for holding Zikri. He believes they have no definitive evidence linking him to the assassination other than the fact that he might have flirted with the thought of terrorism by visiting an enemy country.\n*Jay Whittaker as Frank Molini, a war protester caught and arrested by police in the ensuing chaos after the initial shots were fired at the president. In his possession was a banner depicting a gun being fired at Bush. However, he was later found not to be the assassin.\n*[[Michael Reilly Burke]] as Robert H. Maguire, special agent in charge at the [[FBI]], involved with reporting directly to new president [[Dick Cheney]] on his investigation surrounding evidence related to the assassination.\n*[[James Urbaniak]] as Dr. James Pearn, an FBI forensic examiner assigned to the case to collect and catalogue evidence against any possible suspects. He obtains a partial [[fingerprint]] of Jamal Abu Zikri from traces of gunshot residue at the crime scene, but notes that it is only associative evidence and not necessarily enough evidence for a conviction in a court of law.\n*Neko Parham as Casey Claybon, son of possible suspected assassin Al Claybon. A war veteran who did not particularly support Bush, but who also claimed to have no knowledge of the assassination. He was initially arrested in the melee following the killing, as he walked through the streets of downtown Chicago looking for employment.\n*Seena Jon as Samir Masri, a [[Yemeni American]] protesting at the war rally outside where the President was speaking. Members of his family were deported back to Yemen after overstaying their travel visas following the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]]. Masri was at the rally to protest Bush's policies and was arrested as a suspect.\n*[[Christian Stolte]] as John Rucinski, FBI investigator with the joint terrorism task force, assigned with interviewing detainees including Jamal Abu Zikri. Skeptical, he stresses his suspicions about Zikri's whereabouts on the day of the assassination as well as his military history after analysing his statements.\n*Chavez Ravine as Marianne Claybon, wife of suspected possible assassin Al Claybon. She finds it hard to comprehend her patriotic husband could have had any connection with the killing.\n*Patricia Buckley as Dawn Norton, Jamal Abu Zikry's defence attorney. She immediately expresses her challenging task of defending her client who the FBI believes has connections with terrorist organisations. She relates her difficulty by conveying that any person ''suspected'' of involvement with [[Al-Qaeda]] unfortunately equates to a guilty verdict in American society.\n*Malik Bader as Jamal Abu Zikri, the suspected assassin, a Syrian national working at an IT firm in a building neighbouring the Chicago Sheraton. He was convicted of the crime, but appealed the verdict while being held on death row due to minor forensic evidence implicating him in the assassination.\n*Tony Dale as Al Claybon, the figure cited as a strong likely suspect of the assassination who ended up committing suicide after he supposedly killed the president. He was a [[Gulf War]] veteran distraught over a second son's death from the Iraq War, blaming Bush for his misery.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe funeral scenes in the film include footage taken from archival coverage of [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's funeral]], and President Cheney's eulogy for President Bush is a news clip of Cheney's eulogy for Reagan.<ref name=\"hoberman\"/> [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] special effects and existing footage of President Bush helped to re-create the filming of his assassination. The [[rifle]] used by the perpetrator in the film was actually an airsoft replica of an [[AR-15]]. Image editing software was used to add the actors' images to photographs with President Bush.\n\nAlthough all imagery related to Bush's assassination was created using digital special effects, an apparent actual death, captured on tape, is included in the film during a piece of war footage in which an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] insurgent prepares to launch a rocket, but is shot in the head first.<ref>[http://www.screenit.com/movies/2006/death_of_a_president.html Violence section] Screen It!</ref> Except for specific scenes, most of the actors portrayed in the film were not told of the premise surrounding the story.\n\nDuring a post emergency surgery news conference, the chief physician's comment that he had \"never seen such a strong heart in a man of the president's age\", is a reference to President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Reagan assassination attempt|own attempted assassination]]. In addition, the interview of a middle-aged [[African American]] outside the hospital recalls an interview of a witness on the streets of [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1981 following that assassination attempt. Filming was done entirely on location in Chicago, Illinois.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed and conducted by [[Richard Harvey]]. Sound effects and music elements were mixed by Alex Riordan.\n\n===Director's notes===\nThe film's director, Gabriel Range, noted that the film is not \"a leftist jeremiad\"<ref name=WaPo/> and further said:\n\n<blockquote>The purpose of the film was not to imagine how the world stage would reset with the assassination of George Bush. The intent of the film is really to use the assassination of President Bush as a [[dramatic device]]&mdash;using the future as an [[allegory]] to comment on the past. [....] If people go to the cinema expecting to have some great moment of [[catharsis]] watching the president being shot, I suspect they're in for a pretty big surprise. I think that anyone who's expecting this to be a liberal wet dream is in for quite a shock ... It was very important that the film was not a political rant. It was not just a condemnation or [[polemic]] because I think that polemics are easy to dismiss.<ref name=WaPo>[[Justin Moyer|Moyer, Justin]] (December 17, 2014).
