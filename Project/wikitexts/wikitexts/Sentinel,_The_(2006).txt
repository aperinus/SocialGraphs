It is based on the 2003 novel of the same name by former Secret Service Agent [[Gerald Petievich]]. It was filmed in [[Washington, D.C.]] and in the [[Canada|Canadian]] cities of [[Toronto]] and [[Kleinburg]], [[Ontario]].\n\n==Plot==\nPete Garrison is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and one of the personal bodyguards for [[First Lady of the United States]] Sarah Ballentine, with whom he is having an affair. He is one of the oldest and most experienced agents, having been involved in [[Reagan assassination attempt|saving Ronald Reagan's life]]. His close friend and fellow agent, Charlie Merriweather is murdered. Garrison is told by a reliable [[informant]] that the killing of Merriweather is linked to an assassination plot against the President. The intelligence given by the informant reveals the existence of a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] with access to the President's security detail.\n\nThe Secret Service Protective Intelligence Division, led by Garrison's estranged friend and former [[Mentoring|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] David Breckinridge with [[rookie]] partner Jill Marin, is tasked with investigating the plot. Breckinridge orders every agent to be subjected to a [[polygraph]] test. Meanwhile, the mole discovers the discussion with the informant and Garrison's affair with the first lady, and attempts to blackmail Garrison by luring him to a coffee shop known to be a meeting point for a Colombian cartel. After delaying for some time, Garrison is subjected to a polygraph. The agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Division, William Montrose decides to randomly select the means of transporting the president using a coin toss. As the President and first lady visit [[Camp David]], Garrison's informant calls, demanding that his payment be made at a shopping mall food court. Garrison goes to meet him, but he disappears in the crowd, and an assassin tries to kill Garrison. The agents pursue the assassin, but he escapes. Simultaneously, the [[Marine One|presidential helicopter]] is shot down by a surface-to-air missile outside of Camp David, though neither the President nor his wife were aboard (due to Montrose's coin \"deciding\" to use the [[motorcade]] instead).\n\nGarrison failed the polygraph test due to concealing his affair with the First Lady. Breckinridge confronts him at his home and interrogates him, pinning him as the prime suspect. The source of rancor between them comes to light: Breckinridge believes Garrison had an affair with his wife and caused the breakup of their marriage, which Garrison denies. Garrison escapes capture and conducts his own investigation of the assassination plot. He tries to contact the informant who gave him the tip, but finds that he has been killed. In pursuit, Breckinridge gets the drop on Garrison but is unable to kill him, despite having given other agents \"shoot to kill\" orders. Using his contacts with sympathetic agents and family members, Garrison tracks down the location of one of the assassins, whom he kills in a firefight. He searches his apartment, finding evidence that shows the perpetrators are headed to [[Toronto]] to attack the president at a [[G8]] summit. He leaves it in the apartment and tells Marin about it, but the Secret Service find that the evidence and body of the assassin were removed before they arrived.\n\nThe President's wife discloses her affair with Garrison to Breckinridge, who now understands why Garrison failed his polygraph test. Together in Toronto, Garrison and Breckinridge learn that the assassins are former [[KGB]] operatives hired to kill the president by a Colombian [[drug cartel|cartel]] and the mole, William Montrose, who was never polygraphed. Montrose is in charge of directing security at the summit. The leader of the assassins blackmails Montrose into helping him, threatening the agent's family. Emotionally torn, Montrose is instructed to jam Secret Service's radios, and leave the summit with the President via a specific route; the assassins will handle the remainder of the work.\n\nOn the night of the President's speech, Breckinridge and Garrison race to the summit. The assassins, posing as [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] [[Emergency Response Team (RCMP)|Emergency Response Team]] officers, kill several agents and corner Montrose and the President in a tunnel. Montrose reveals his treason to the President and purposely steps in front of one of the assassins, who kills him. Garrison, Breckinridge and Marin arrive, rescuing the President and the First Lady and killing the assassins. As they reach the ground level, Montrose's handler comes forward dressed as an RCMP officer to personally perform the killings. He takes Sarah hostage and aims his pistol at the President, but Garrison shoots him dead. In spite of these events, Garrison is forced to take an early retirement due to the disclosure of his affair with the first lady, who looks on sadly from her window as Garrison leaves the [[White House]]. He does, however, make peace with Breckinridge, who finally realizes that Garrison did not sleep with his wife. Breckinridge tells Garrison that he has a date with her that evening.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agent Pete Garrison\n* [[Kiefer Sutherland]] as Secret Service Agent David Breckinridge\n* [[Eva Longoria]] as Secret Service Agent Jill Marin\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as [[First Lady]] Sarah Ballentine\n* [[David Rasche]] as [[President of the United States|President]] John Ballentine\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Secret Service Agent Bill Montrose\n* [[Ritchie Coster]] as The Handler\n* [[Blair Brown]] as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]]\n* [[Nancy Ajram]] as Herself\n* [[Kristin Lehman]] as Cindy Breckinridge\n* [[Raynor Scheine]] as Walter Xavier\n* [[Chuck Shamata]] as [[Director of the United States Secret Service|Director]] Overbrook\n* [[Paul Calder\u00f3n]] as Deputy Director Cortes\n* [[Clark Johnson]] as Secret Service Agent Charlie Merriweather\n* [[Raoul Bhaneja]] as Secret Service Agent Aziz Hassad\n* [[Yanna McIntosh]] as Secret Service Agent Teddy Vargas\n* Joshua Peace as Secret Service Agent Davies\n* Simon Reynolds as Secret Service Agent Tom DiPaola\n* Geza Kovacs as Secret Service Agent Turzanski\n* [[Jasmin Geljo]] as Assassin\n* Danny A.
