The film centers on a recent high school graduate (Plaza) who feels she needs to have more sexual experiences before she starts college.<ref name=\"Deadline\"/>\n\nThe film was released in the United States on July 26, 2013, by [[CBS Films]].<ref name=\"Deadline\">{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/05/the-to-do-list-release-date-aubrey-plaza-parks-and-recreation/ |title=CBS Films Moves Up Aubrey Plaza Comedy 'The To-Do List' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=2013-05-09 |access-date=2013-05-23}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nBrandy Klark ([[Aubrey Plaza]]), from [[Boise, Idaho]], is an overachieving but socially awkward teenager who graduates as the valedictorian of her high school in 1993. After the ceremony, Brandy's two best friends, Wendy ([[Sarah Steele]]) and Fiona ([[Alia Shawkat]]), take Brandy to a party, where she gets drunk for the first time. Brandy makes out with a muscular college boy she has a crush on named Rusty Waters ([[Scott Porter]]). Since the room is dark, he mistakes Brandy for someone else and when he realizes who she is, he rejects her. Brandy blames her lack of sexual experience and resolves to learn all about sex over the summer to prepare for college. She decides that her end-of-summer goal will be to have sex with Rusty to complete her \"To Do List\".\n\nBrandy gets a job at the pool as a lifeguard to be close to Rusty and her study-buddy Cameron Mitchell ([[Johnny Simmons]]). As the newbie, she is hazed by her slacker boss, Willy ([[Bill Hader]]) and her other co-workers by being given the most unpleasant jobs. Brandy is told to clean waste from the pool that appears to be feces. She assumes her co-workers are playing a prank on her, based on the [[Baby Ruth]] joke from the film ''[[Caddyshack]]'', so she takes a bite only to find out it is actual feces. As revenge, she pushes Willy, who does not know how to swim, into the pool. She agrees to teach him how to swim in exchange for ending the hazing.\n\nBrandy gets advice from her sister, Amber ([[Rachel Bilson]]), her mother, and her two best friends, while her father, a [[conservative]] judge, is uncomfortable with the talk of sex. Using this information, she makes a \"to do list\" of sexual acts to learn and perform. As the summer progresses, Brandy has several sexual encounters with Cameron and other boys, all while trying to catch Rusty's eye. Cameron begins to fall in love with her but is crushed after discovering her list and realizing he was just part of her \"mission\". Willy catches Brandy, Wendy, Fiona, and adult members of a male [[grunge]] band in the pool after hours. Brandy is sent home where she is confronted by Cameron over the list. Cameron leaves in a huff and Brandy cries. Duffy ([[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]]), whom Wendy has a crush on, comes over to comfort Brandy and the two [[hookup culture|hook up]].\n\nWhen Wendy and Fiona come over to watch the film ''[[Beaches (1988 film)|Beaches]]'' with Brandy, they discover her list and see the list of boys with whom she had experimented. They get upset after finding out that Brandy hooked up with one of their crushes and leave angrily. They declare that Brandy has failed to put \"Bros before hoes\" and call her a slut.\n\nBrandy finally gets close to Rusty when they vandalize a rival pool, but they get caught because Brandy leaves her bra, which has her name on it, and Willy fires her. Brandy asks out Rusty, and he takes her to a popular make-out spot to have sex, but the sex is brief and disappointing. She sees her father and mother in the [[Dodge Caravan]] next to them having sex, causing her to freak out and demand that Rusty take her home immediately.\n\nWilly goes to the Klark house to stop Brandy from having sex with Rusty, but is met at the door by Amber, who seduces him. When Rusty and Brandy arrive home, a jealous Cameron is there to meet him with a [[sucker-punch]], and they fight until Brandy breaks it up. She compliments them on their good qualities, apologizes sincerely to Cameron for using him, and offers her own view of sex.\n\nAfterward, she seeks out Wendy and Fiona to apologize to them. She sings \"[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]\" at Wendy's door, and the two girls eventually join in, forgiving her. Brandy meets  with Willy at the pool, and he offers her his job if she comes back next summer\u2014as he has quit to follow the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nIn the fall, Brandy and Cameron meet again at [[Georgetown University]]. Brandy apologizes to Cameron. They have various forms of sex, and Brandy finally achieves [[orgasm]], the last thing on her list, through anal sex, just as her father walks in on them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Brandy Klark\n* [[Johnny Simmons]]<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> as Cameron Mitchell\n* [[Bill Hader]]<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> as Willy McLean\n* [[Scott Porter]] as Rusty Waters\n* [[Alia Shawkat]]<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> as Fiona Forster\n* [[Sarah Steele]] as Wendy Summers\n* [[Rachel Bilson]]<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> as Amber Klark\n* [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]]<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> as Duffy\n* [[Andy Samberg]]<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> as Van King\n* [[Connie Britton]]<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> as Jean Klark\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Judge George Klark\n* [[Donald Glover]] as Derrick Murphy\n* [[Adam Pally]] as Chip\n* [[Jack McBrayer]] as Oakcrest Pool Manager\n* [[Nolan Gould]] as Max\n* Bryce Clyde Jenkins as Benji\n* Kevin M.
