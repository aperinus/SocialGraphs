Pistone|Joseph Pistone]], who successfully infiltrated the Mafia, as portrayed in the [[Donnie Brasco (film)|movie of the same name]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Al Pacino]].\n\nWhile the film is set in [[Philadelphia]], it was filmed in [[Pittsburgh]], with scenes at Tom's Diner and Bloom Cigar Company in the [[South Side (Pittsburgh)|South Side]] and [[Hartwood Acres Park|Hartwood Mansion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.county.allegheny.pa.us/parks/10th-wolf.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224241/http://www.county.allegheny.pa.us/parks/10th-wolf.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-30 |title=Hartwood and the Movie: 10th & Wolf |work=Allegheny County Parks Department |accessdate=2007-07-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nTommy is the son of a Mafia hitman, who, after his father is killed by a rival, moves with his younger brother to live with his aunt, uncle and cousin in Philadelphia. The sole member of his family who is not involved in crime, Tommy joins the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and fights in [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]. Becoming disillusioned when the conflict ended with [[Saddam Hussein]] still in power.  and disenchanted with military service, Tommy assaults an [[military police|MP]], and steals a colonel's [[Jeep]]. Arrested when the jeep runs out of gas, the movie opens with Tommy in the brig at a [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] base.\n\nAn [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent (played by Dennehy) coerces Tommy into infiltrating the family business. The agent tells Tommy that he can protect his brother and cousin in return for evidence against the Sicilian mob trying to take over the heroin trade in the US. Tommy is instructed to wear a [[covert listening device|wire]] to record negotiations between his cousin and gang leader, Joey Marcucci and Mafia boss Luciano Reggio.\n\nTommy tries to get incriminating evidence against Reggio, while protecting his cousin and younger brother in their fledgling attempts to become \"goodfellas\". His efforts to strike a balance between his family loyalties, and the FBI's need for evidence, take up most of the film's bulk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[James Marsden]] as Tommy\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as Joey - [[Joey Merlino]]\n* [[Brad Renfro]] as Vincent\n* [[Piper Perabo]] as Brandy\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Matty Matello\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Agent Horvath\n* [[Lesley Ann Warren]] as Tina\n* [[Leo Rossi]] as Agent Thornton\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as Junior\n* [[Tommy Lee]] as Jimmy Tattoo\n* [[Francesco Salvi]] as Luciano Reggio \n[[John Stanfa]]\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as Murtha\n* [[John Capodice]] as Sipio\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was panned by critics.
