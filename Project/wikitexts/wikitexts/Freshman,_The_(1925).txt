It stars [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Jobyna Ralston]], Brooks Benedict, and [[James Anderson (director)|James Anderson]].  It remains one of Lloyd's most successful and enduring films.\n\nThe film was written by [[John Grey (screenwriter)|John Grey]], [[Sam Taylor (director)|Sam Taylor]], [[Tim Whelan]], and [[Ted Wilde]].  It was directed by Taylor and [[Fred C. Newmeyer]].\n\nIn 1990, ''The Freshman'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", added in the second year of voting and one of the first 50 films to receive the honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |website=Library of Congress|access-date=April 29, 2020}}</ref>\n<!--spacing, please do not remove-->\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The Freshman lobby card 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Freshman and Peggy]]\nHarold Lamb (Harold Lloyd), a bright-eyed but naive young man, enrolls at Tate University. On the train there, he meets Peggy (Jobyna Ralston). They are attracted to each other.\n\nHarold decides that the best way to ensure his popularity at school is to emulate his movie idol, The College Hero, down to mimicking a little jig he does before greeting anyone, and taking his nickname, \"Speedy\". However, the College Cad (Brooks Benedict) quickly makes him the butt of an ongoing joke, of which the freshman remains blissfully unaware. Harold thinks he is popular, when in fact he is the laughingstock of the whole school. His only real friend is Peggy, who turns out to be his landlady's daughter.  She is described in one of the film's [[Intertitle|title cards]] as \"the kind of girl your mother must have been\".\n\nHe tries out for the [[college football|football]] team. The coach ([[Pat Harmon]]) is unimpressed, but as Harold has damaged their only practice tackle dummy, the coach uses him in its place. At the end of practice, though, he approves of Harold's enthusiasm (undiminished after repeated tackling). The coach is about to dismiss the freshman when Chet Trask (James Anderson), the captain and star of the team, suggests making him their water boy, while letting him think he has made the squad.\n\n[[File:The Freshman lobby card.jpg|thumb|left|Lloyd as Harold Lamb]]\nHarold is persuaded to host the annual \"Fall Frolic\" dance. His tailor is late making his suit; with the dance well underway, it is barely being held together by [[Tack (sewing)|basting stitches]], but Harold puts it on and hopes for the best. During the party, his clothes start to fall apart, despite the efforts of the tailor (hiding in a side room) to effect repairs. When Harold sees the College Cad being too forward with Peggy, working as a hatcheck girl, Harold knocks him down. The incensed Cad then tells him just what everyone really thinks of him. Peggy advises him to stop putting on an act and be himself.\n\nHarold is determined to prove himself by getting into the big football game.  His chance comes when the other team proves too tough, injuring so many of Tate College's players that the coach runs out of substitutes. Hounded by Harold and warned by the [[Referee (American football)|referee]] that he will forfeit if he cannot come up with another player, the coach reluctantly lets Harold go in. The first few plays are disastrous. Finally, he breaks free and is on his way to winning the game, but, mindful of a referee's prior instruction that he is to stop playing when he hears the whistle, he drops the football just outside the [[end zone]] when a non-football whistle sounds. The other team recovers the ball with only a minute left to play. His teammates are disheartened, but Harold rouses them to make a final effort. He chases down the opposing ball carrier, knocks the football loose, scoops it up and runs it all the way back for the winning [[touchdown]] as time runs out, which at last earns him the respect and popularity he was after. To top it off, Peggy passes him a note proclaiming her love for him.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Speedy.jpg|thumb|Harold Lloyd as Harold Lamb]]\n*[[Harold Lloyd]] as The Freshman\n*[[Jobyna Ralston]] as Peggy\n*[[Brooks Benedict]] as The College Cad\n*[[James Anderson (director)|James Anderson]] as The College Hero\n*[[Hazel Keener]] as The College Belle\n*Joseph Harrington as The College Tailor\n*[[Pat Harmon]] as The Football Coach\n\n[[Pete the Pup]] has a cameo in the movie.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Poster - Freshman, The (1925) 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Film poster]]]]\n\nTrain station scenes were filmed on November 12\u201313, 1924 at the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] depot at [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], California, with a four-car train set and locomotive provided by the railroad and standing on a siding adjacent to the station.
