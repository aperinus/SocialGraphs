Impressed with Burton's work on the short films ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'' and ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'', the producers and Reubens hired him to direct. Filming took place in [[California]] and [[Texas]].\n\nThe film was released on August 9, 1985, grossing over $40 million in North America. It became a [[cult film]] and continued to accumulate positive feedback. It was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] and spawned two [[sequel]]s, ''[[Big Top Pee-wee]]'' (1988) and ''[[Pee-wee's Big Holiday]]'' (2016). Its financial success, followed by the equally successful ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' in 1988, prompted Warner Bros. to hire Burton to direct the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. -->\nPee-wee Herman has a heavily accessorized bicycle that he treasures and that his neighbor and enemy, Francis Buxton, covets. Dottie, an employee at a bike shop, has a crush on Pee-wee, but he does not reciprocate.\n\nPee-wee's bike is stolen while he is shopping at a mall, but the police tell Pee-wee they cannot help him find it. Pee-wee assumes Francis took it, and confronts him, but Francis' father convinces Pee-wee that Francis was at home when the bike was stolen. Pee-wee offers a $10,000 reward for the bike. Francis, who did indeed pay to have someone steal the bike, is disturbed by Pee-wee's relentlessness and pays to have the bike sent away. That evening, Pee-wee holds an unsuccessful evidentiary meeting of friends and neighbors to find the bike, then rejects offers of help. He then visits a psychic who, spying a bargain basement across the street, tells Pee-wee that his bike is in the basement of the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio]].\n\nPee-wee hitchhikes to Texas, getting rides from a fugitive convict named Mickey, and from Large Marge, the ghost of a truck driver. At a truck stop, Pee-wee finds his wallet is missing, and pays for his meal by washing dishes. He befriends Simone, a waitress who dreams of visiting [[Paris]]. As they watch the sun rise from within a [[Cabazon Dinosaurs|roadside dinosaur statue]], he encourages her to follow her dreams, but Simone tells him about her boyfriend, Andy, who disapproves. Andy himself appears and tries to attack Pee-wee, who escapes onto a moving train. Pee-wee arrives at the Alamo, but learns at the end of a guided tour that the building does not have a basement.\n\nAt a bus station, Pee-wee encounters Simone, who tells him she broke up with Andy and is on her way to Paris. She tells Pee-wee not to give up searching for his bike. Pee-wee calls Dottie at the bike shop and apologizes for his behavior. Andy spots Pee-wee and resumes chasing him. Pee-wee evades Andy at a rodeo by disguising himself as a bull rider. Forced to ride a bull, Pee-wee nearly sets a world record but receives a concussion. He visits a biker bar to make a phone call, and a [[outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]] threatens to kill him after he accidentally knocks over their motorcycles. He wins them over by dancing to the song \"[[Tequila (Champs song)|Tequila]]\" in a pair of [[platform shoe]]s, and they give him a motorcycle for his journey, which he crashes immediately.\n\nHe awakens in a hospital and sees a television news report in which his bike is being used as a [[Theatrical property|prop]] in a film. Pee-wee sneaks into [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. Studios]] with [[Milton Berle]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and grabs the bike. Security guards chase him across the studio lot and through several active sets before he escapes.\n\nHaving escaped the lot, Pee-wee discovers a burning pet shop and rescues the animals. The firefighters declare Pee-wee a hero, but the police arrest Pee-wee for his intrusion at the studio. They return Pee-wee to the studio to face Warner Bros. president Terry Hawthorne. After Pee-wee pleads his case that the bike belongs to him, Hawthorne decides to drop the charges and return Pee-wee's bike in exchange for the rights to adapt his story into a film starring [[James Brolin]] as \"P.W. Herman\" and [[Morgan Fairchild]] as Dottie. In the film, the characters must retrieve their stolen motorbike \u2013 which contains an important [[microfilm]] \u2013 from the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]. Pee-wee has a bit role as a hotel [[bellhop]], though his voice has been dubbed.\n\nSeeing the film at a [[drive-in theater]], Pee-wee gives refreshments to the different people he met along his journey, then joins Dottie at their bikes. He also encounters Francis, who tells reporters he is Pee-wee's best friend and that he taught Pee-wee how to ride. Francis claims to be knowledgeable about Pee-wee's bike, but sets off one of the bicycle's gadgets, catapulting himself into the air.\n\nPee-wee wants to leave the drive-in, and Dottie asks why he is not staying to watch the rest of the film. Pee-wee answers \"I don't have to see it, Dottie. I lived it.\" He and Dottie then ride off together [[silhouette]]d against the screen.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as [[Pee-wee Herman]], a childish man whose bike is stolen.\n* [[E.

His original concept was a remake of ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960), Reubens' favorite film, with Pee-wee Herman in the [[Hayley Mills]] role. While writing the script, Reubens noticed that many at Warner Bros. rode bicycles around the [[backlot]] and requested one of his own.
