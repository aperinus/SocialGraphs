In response to the recent fuel shortage in the wake of global warfare, the German company Treer designs a generator of inexhaustible energy, which is propelled by the [[perpetual motion]] of ocean currents, called \"Fluid Karma\". However, its inventor Baron von Westphalen and his associates are hiding the fact that the generators alter the ocean's currents and cause the Earth to slow its rotation, and that the transmission of Fluid Karma to portable receivers (via [[quantum entanglement]]) is ripping holes in the fabric of [[Spacetime|space and time]].\n\nIn near-future 2008, Los Angeles (referred to as \"The Southland\" by locals) is a [[dystopian]]<ref>[https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/southland-tales/ This Maligned 2006 Movie About Dystopian L.A.
