She is addicted to mystery novels (graphic and otherwise), film noir and detective magazines (hence the movie's title). All of this has inspired her to become a police officer, like her father who was slain in the line of duty years ago. Mary's ambition to this end amuses her siblings John and Vicky, as well as their widowed mother Celia.\n\nMary gets wind of a case involving the serial killer of several teenage girls, including a handful of her classmates. She launches her own investigation, which gets her in trouble with her late dad's partner, Detective Jerry Guinn. Guinn wants Mary as far away from the field as possible...ostensibly because she just doesn't have what it takes to be a cop, but also out of concern for her well-being. Undaunted, Mary enlists the aid of police cadet Tony Campbell to sniff out the murderer; gradually, the two fall in love.\n\nUltimately, the name \"Tony Campbell\" is revealed to be an alias; his real name is Daniel Henry Moffat, and he proves to be the killer both Mary and Guinn are looking for. Moffat outwits and kills Guinn, only to be outwitted by Mary and left hanging for his life. Despite Moffat\u2019s pleads for help, a tearful Mary chooses not to save him, allowing Moffat to fall to his death. Just weeks after graduation from the 12th grade, she is seen in a police uniform - having succeeded in her aspiration of following in her father\u2019s footsteps and joining the police department.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Mary Giordano\n* [[Kevin Dillon]] as Cadet Tony Campbell / Daniel Henry Moffat\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as Detective Jerry Guinn\n* [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] as Earl Parkins\n* [[Marla Sokoloff]] as Vicki Giordano\n* Ann Devaney as Sherry Tarnley\n* Joshua Shaefer as John Giordano\n* [[Jennifer Savidge]] as Celia Giordano\n* [[Tara Subkoff]] as Liz McConnell\n* [[David Packer (actor)|David Packer]] as Sergeant Collins\n* Alissa Dowdy as Kathleen Donlevy\n* [[Aimee Brooks]] as Margie Donlevy\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on location at [[John Marshall High School (Los Angeles, California)|John Marshall High School]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nThough not released until 1996, the film was actually shot a few years earlier when Alicia was under the age of 18.\n\nOther titles for the film are ''Dangerous Kiss'' and ''True Detective.''
