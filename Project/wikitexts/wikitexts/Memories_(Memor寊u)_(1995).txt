The film is composed of three shorts: {{nihongo|''Magnetic Rose''|\u5f7c\u5973\u306e\u60f3\u3044\u3067|Kanojo no Omoide}}, directed by [[Studio 4\u00b0C]] co-founder [[K\u014dji Morimoto]] and written by [[Satoshi Kon]]; {{nihongo|''Stink Bomb''|\u6700\u81ed\u5175\u5668|Saish\u016b-heiki}}, directed by [[Tensai Okamura]] of ''[[Darker than Black]]'' fame and written by Otomo, and {{nihongo|''Cannon Fodder''|\u5927\u7832\u306e\u8857|Taih\u014d no Machi}}, written and directed by Otomo himself.\n\nOriginally released on home video in North America by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]], [[Discotek Media]] acquired the rights in 2020 along with Mill Creek Entertainment. Their 2021 [[Blu-ray]] release includes English subtitles and a new English dub produced by [[NYAV Post]] (for ''Magnetic Rose'') and Sound Cadence Studios (for ''Stink Bomb'' and ''Cannon Fodder'').<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sherman|first=Jennifer|date=2021-02-04|title=Memories Anthology's English Dub Streams on February 6|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-02-04/memories-anthology-english-dub-streams-on-february-6/.169120|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-16|website=Anime News Network|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Chapman |first=Paul |url= https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/05/03-1/discotek-announces-memories-urusei-yatsura-movies-and-more|title= Discotek Announces Memories, Urusei Yatsura Movies, and More|work=[[Crunchyroll]]|access-date= November 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n===''Magnetic Rose''===\nThe ''Corona'', a deep space salvage freighter, is out on a mission when it encounters a distress signal and responds to it. They come upon a spaceship graveyard orbiting a giant space station. The crew's two engineers, Heintz and Miguel, enter it to get a closer look.\nOnce inside, they discover an opulent European interior and several furnished rooms (in varying states of decay) but find no signs of life. They discover that the station belongs to a once-famous opera diva named Eva Friedel who disappeared after the murder of her fianc\u00e9, Carlo Rambaldi, a fellow singer. Continuing the search for the source of the signal, the engineers split up, with each experiencing paranormal encounters, including strange noises and visions of Eva. Miguel enters the dilapidated underbelly of the station, and in a cavernous chamber, he finds a broken piano playing the distress signal. He begins to hallucinate and Eva suddenly runs up to kiss him.\nHeintz finds a theater stage and sees Eva, who stabs him when he approaches. Suddenly paralyzed, Heintz relives a memory of his family, with his wife and daughter Emily. The illusion disappears when Eva takes his wife's form and tells him that he \"will never leave\". Heintz rushes to save Miguel, only to find that he had been seduced by Eva into thinking he is Carlo. Eva reveals to Heintz that she murdered the real Carlo for refusing to marry her and has forced others to look like him. She makes Heintz relive his daughter's death and nearly convinces him to join her. He resists and shoots the massive computer embedded in the ceiling causing the AI hologram of Eva to malfunction.\n\nThe ''Corona'' has been struggling against a powerful magnetic field coming from the station, pulling the ship towards it. In desperation, they fire a powerful [[Directed-energy weapon|energy cannon]], gouging the structure deep enough to reach the cavern. Heintz is ejected into space (along with Eva's past victims), as Eva hauntingly sings to a conjured audience. The ''Corona'' is crushed and becomes part of the rose-like shape around the station. The episode ends with the whereabouts of the real (and deceased) Eva being shown, and a representation of Eva talking romantically with Miguel as the two now exist only in Eva's lingering memories. Heintz is last seen drifting in space, still alive.\n\n===''Stink Bomb''===\nThis story is based in part on the [[Gloria Ramirez]] incident. In it, lab technician Nobuo Tanaka, battling the [[flu]], mistakes some experimental pills for cold pills and swallows one. The pills are part of a [[Biological agent|biological weapon]] program, reacting to the flu shot already in his body. Tanaka soon develops a deadly body odor and becomes a walking weapon of mass destruction. While taking a nap, the odor he emits kills everyone in the laboratory. Horrified, he reports the incident to headquarters, as they instruct him to deliver the experimental drug to [[Tokyo]]. Meanwhile, the odor he emits grows stronger to where it affects several miles of the surrounding area, killing every living thing that smells his odor, except flowers and plants. The Odor is so potent that [[gas mask]]s nor [[NBC suit]]s offer no protection against its effects. His odor kills everything in the [[Yamanashi, Yamanashi|Yamanashi Prefecture]], including all 200,000 inhabitants of [[K\u014dfu]] city. Nobuo continues on to [[Tokyo]] unaware of the death his smell is causing, but the rest of the country is in a complete panic. The head of the research company and the Japanese military deduce that Tanaka is causing the poisonous gas and order him to be killed. The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japan Self Defense Forces]] try in vain to stop Nobuo, causing immense collateral damage to the Japanese countryside, but to no avail, as the chemicals on Nobuo smell cause interference on the targeting systems of its heat-seeking missiles.\n\nThe [[United States Forces Japan|U.S. military]], who have been observing the situation to that point, utilizes [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|Japanese policy]] to take over the operation, and calls in a [[NASA]] unit with space suits to try and capture Nobuo alive. Unaware of this operation, the Japanese army collapses part of the bridge to prevent Nobuo from escaping, trapping him in a tunnel. They turn on wind generators loaded with [[liquid nitrogen]] in an attempt to freeze him. Nobuo becomes scared, disabling the machines while leaving the three astronauts unscathed. The soldiers force Nobuo into an exosuit and bring him back to military headquarters in Tokyo. Nobuo makes his way through the headquarters building, unaware that he is the source of the biological contamination. He then opens his exosuit, killing everyone.\n\n===''Cannon Fodder''===\nIn a walled city perpetually at war, everyone's livelihood depends upon maintaining and firing the enormous cannons that make up most of the city. Nearly every building in the city is equipped with a cannon of varying size, able to fire huge artillery shells over the city walls. The story is centered on a young boy and his father, who works as a lowly cannon-loader.\n\nThe city is surrounded by clouds of smoke and dust provoked by the shots fired by the cannons. Despite news of successful bombardment of the \"enemy moving city\" by the local media, there is not any visual confirmation that it is true, or even if there is an enemy at all.\n\nIn the end, the boy comes home from school and hears a television news reporter talking about the near-destruction of the enemy city. The boy hops into his bed, saying that someday he wants to be the exalted officer who fires the cannons, and not be a simple worker like his father. As he sleeps, a [[civil defense siren]] sounds and [[Nuclear weapon|a blue light sweeps across the window]].\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Cast\n!Character\n!Japanese\n!English<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sevakis|first=Justin|date=|title=Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/worldofcrap/status/1353179416063406080|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 27, 2021|website=Twitter}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Sound Cadence|url=https://twitter.com/SoundCadence/status/1338669733412032513|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Twitter}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Magnetic Rose\n|-\n!Heinz Beckner\n|[[Tsutomu Isobe]]\n|Marc Swint\n|-\n!Ivanov\n|[[Sh\u014dz\u014d Iizuka|Shouzou Iizuka]]\n|Frank Todaro\n|-\n!Miguel Costrela\n|[[K\u014dichi Yamadera|Kouichi Yamadera]]\n|[[Robbie Daymond]]\n|-\n!Aoshima\n|[[Shigeru Chiba]]\n|[[Derek Stephen Prince]]\n|-\n!Emily\n|Ami Hasegawa\n|Alexa Careccia\n|-\n!Eva Friedel\n|[[Gara Takashima]]\n|[[Laura Post]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Stink Bomb\n|-\n!Nobuo Tanaka\n|[[Hideyuki Hori]]\n|Stephen Fu\n|-\n!Oomaeda\n|[[Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)|Ken'ichi Ogata]]\n|Chris Guerrero\n|-\n!Kamata\n|[[Osamu Saka]]\n|Gianni Matragrano\n|-\n!Grandma\n|[[Hisako Ky\u014dda|Hisako Kyouda]]\n|[[Karen Kahler]]\n|-\n!Nirasaki\n|[[Michio Hazama]]\n|Steven Kelly\n|-\n!Sakiko\n|[[Kayoko Fujii]]\n|[[Kira Buckland]]\n|-\n!General Officer\n|[[Ry\u014dichi Tanaka|Ryouichi Tanaka]]\n|[[Mike Pollock (voice actor)|Mike Pollock]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Cannon Fodder\n|-\n!Boy\n|[[Y\u016b Hayashi|Yuu Hayashi]]\n|Jack Britton\n|-\n!Father\n|[[Keaton Yamada]]\n|[[Mike Pollock (voice actor)|Mike Pollock]]\n|-\n!Mother\n|[[Keiko Yamamoto]]\n|Ellen-Ray Hennessey (''as Elley Ray'')\n|-\n!Teacher\n|Ryuuji Nakagi\n|[[Michael Sorich]]\n|-\n!Loading Operator\n|Nobuaki Fukuda\n|Phillip Sacramento\n|-\n!Commander\n|[[Hidetoshi Nakamura]]\n|Ray Hurd\n|}\n\n==Production details==\n===''Magnetic Rose''===\nDirected by [[K\u014dji Morimoto]] and animated by [[Studio 4\u00b0C]]. Script by noted anime director [[Satoshi Kon]], based on a story by [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]. This episode featured music from Puccini's ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' and ''[[Tosca]]''. Specifically sampled in the episode was ''Un Bel Di Vedremo'' and ''Con Onor Muore... Tu, tu? Piccolo iddio'' from ''Madama Butterfly'' and ''Non la Sospiri, la Nostra Casetta'' from Act I of ''Tosca''.\n\nMusic was composed by [[Yoko Kanno]] and largely influenced by [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''Madama Butterfly''. It is primarily operatic and highly involved, reflecting the serious, intense nature the film takes on as it progresses.\n\n===''Stink Bomb''===\nDirected by [[Tensai Okamura]] and animated by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]]. Script by Katsuhiro Otomo. Music is by [[Jun Miyake]] and uses jazz and funk as its main influence, adding to the film's chaotic, comedic nature.\n\nIt is mentioned in the interview featurette that the story for ''Stink Bomb'' is based on an actual event.<ref name=GloriaRamirez>{{cite web| url= http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/999/whats-the-story-on-the-toxic-lady| title= What's the story on the \"toxic lady\"?|access-date=2013-06-27 |publisher=The Straight Dope|first=Cecil|last=Adams| date= 22 March 1996}}</ref>\n\n===''Cannon Fodder''===\nWritten and directed by Katsuhiro Otomo and animated by Studio 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. Music by Hiroyuki Nagashima. The score of ''Cannon Fodder'' is difficult to categorize; blending [[brass band]], [[orchestra]]l and avant-garde compositional techniques.\n\nThrough unusual animation techniques, the illusion is created that the film consists of one continuous shot or [[long take]].\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2001, [[Animage|''Animage'' magazine]] ranked ''Memories'' 68th in their list of the 100 greatest anime productions.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2001-01-15/animage-top-100-anime-listing| title=Animage Top-100 Anime Listing |access-date=2009-03-15 |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2001-01-15}}</ref> The film was met with positive reviews, although reception for each of the three stories varied.
