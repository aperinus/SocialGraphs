It co-stars [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Oliver Platt]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], and [[Dustin Hoffman]], along with [[Robert Downey Jr.]] in a cameo role.\n\nFavreau wrote the script after directing several big-budget films, wanting to go \"back to basics\" and to create a film about cooking.<ref name=oregon /> Food truck owner and chef [[Roy Choi]] served as a co-producer and oversaw the menus and food prepared for the film. [[Principal photography]] took place in July 2013 in Los Angeles, Miami, Austin and New Orleans.\n\n''Chef'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 7, 2014, and was released theatrically on May 9, 2014, by [[Open Road Films]]. It was well received by critics, who praised the direction, music, writing, story, and performances, and grossed $46 million against a production budget of $11 million.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Miami]]-born Carl Casper is the head chef of Gauloises in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles]]. While popular with his kitchen staff and hostess Molly, Carl clashes with the restaurant's owner, Riva, who wants him to stick to classical cuisine rather than innovative dishes. Carl also has a strained relationship with his tech-savvy preteen son, Percy, and his rich ex-wife, Inez.\n\nWhen Carl has the chance to serve prestigious food critic and blogger Ramsey Michel, Riva demands he prepare old favorites at the last minute; Carl concedes, leading to a scathing review. Carl insults Ramsey on [[Twitter]], not realizing that his reply is public, and gains a large online following. Carl comes up with a new menu that his staff loves and invites Ramsey to a \"rematch\", but leaves after confronting Riva, who wants the old menu again.\n\nAt home, Carl prepares the menu he wanted, while his [[sous-chef]] Tony serves Ramsey the same dishes from his prior visit. Ramsey tweets negatively about Carl, provoking Carl into confronting him at the restaurant. Videos of Carl's meltdown go [[viral video|viral]], leaving him humiliated and unemployable.\n\nCarl reluctantly accepts Inez's invitation to accompany her and Percy to Miami, where he rediscovers his love for [[Cuban cuisine]]. At Inez's encouragement, her ex-husband Marvin offers Carl a dilapidated [[food truck]]. Carl and Percy bond while restoring the truck and buying groceries, and Carl gives him a [[chef's knife]]. Martin, Carl's friend and former line cook, turns down his promotion at Gauloise to join Carl, who has reignited his passion as a chef.\n\nCarl, Martin, and Percy drive the truck across the country to Los Angeles, serving [[Cuban sandwich]]es and [[Cassava|yuca]] fries. Percy promotes them on [[social media]], and they find success in [[New Orleans]] and [[Austin]], where their daily specials include [[po' boy]]s, [[beignet]]s and barbecued [[brisket]], made with local ingredients.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, having strengthened his relationship with Percy, Carl accepts his son's offer to help with the food truck, with Inez also joining them. Ramsey visits the truck to explain his bad review: though an early fan of Carl, he was disappointed by a meal he felt was beneath Carl's skills. Impressed with the chef's return to form, Ramsey offers to bankroll a new restaurant where Carl will have full creative control.\n\nSix months later, the successful new restaurant is closed for a private event: Carl and Inez's remarriage ceremony.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Carl Casper\n* [[Emjay Anthony]] as Percy Casper\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Martin\n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as Inez Casper\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Tony\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Molly\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Ramsey Michel\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Riva\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as Jen\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Marvin\n* [[Russell Peters]] as Miami cop\n\nMusician [[Gary Clark Jr]], [[Franklin Barbecue]] owner Aaron Franklin and general manager Benji Jacob cameo as themselves.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Jon Favreau 2016.jpeg|thumb|upright|Jon Favreau wrote, directed and starred in ''Chef''.]]\n\n===Development===\n[[Jon Favreau]], the writer, director and star of ''Chef'', wrote the film's script in about two weeks.<ref name=thr>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sxsw-jon-favreau-says-chef-686667|title=SXSW: Jon Favreau Says 'Chef' Marks Return to 'Swingers'-Style Filmmaking (Q&A)|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 7, 2014|access-date=July 15, 2014}}</ref> He had long wanted to make a film about food and chefs, and felt that the subject was suited to a small-scale [[independent film]] rather than a big-budget production.<ref name=thr/><ref name=vulture>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/04/jon-favreau-on-chef-going-indie-getting-older.html|title= Talking to Jon Favreau About Chef, Returning to Indies, and Maintaining a Vision Inside Blockbusters|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=May 10, 2014|first=Jesse David|last=Fox|access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> He cited ''[[Jiro Dreams of Sushi]]'', ''[[Eat Drink Man Woman]]'' and ''[[Big Night]]'' as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.<ref name=vulture/>\n\nThe script was semi-autobiographical, incorporating parts of Favreau's life into the main character, such as being a father while having a busy career and coming from a \"broken home\".<ref name=thr/> Favreau also drew a comparison between his career as a director and Carl's career as a chef; he stepped down from directing major studio films to go \"back to basics\" and create ''Chef'' on a smaller budget, much like Carl's resignation from a popular restaurant to work in a food truck.<ref name=oregon>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2014/05/jon_favreaus_wild_hollywood_ri.html|work=[[The Oregonian]]|first=Jeff|last=Baker|title=Jon Favreau's wild Hollywood ride from 'Swingers' to 'Iron Man' and 'Chef': interview|date=May 26, 2014|access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFavreau contacted [[Roy Choi]], a restaurateur who created the [[Kogi Korean BBQ]] food truck, to serve as a consultant on the film; Choi was eventually promoted to co-producer.
