After they collect a bone sample, the ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' devours their [[submersible]]. The ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' attacks their [[helicopter]], but they manage to escape with the sample, also allowing the ''Mosasaurus'' to escape into the open ocean.\n\nThree years later, a [[United States Senate]] committee debates whether Isla Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved from an impending [[volcanic eruption]]. Mathematician [[Ian Malcolm (character)|Dr. Ian Malcolm]] testifies that the dinosaurs should perish naturally to correct the wrongful [[cloning]] done by [[List of Jurassic Park characters#John Hammond|John Hammond]]. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire Dearing, has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate rules against rescuing the animals, Hammond's former partner, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Sir Benjamin Lockwood|Sir Benjamin Lockwood]], summons Claire to his [[Northern California]] estate. Lockwood and his aide, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Eli Mills|Eli Mills]], reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to reactivate the park's [[GPS wildlife tracking|tracking system]] to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last surviving ''[[Velociraptor]]''. Claire recruits Owen Grady, former ''Velociraptor'' trainer, to help capture her.\n\nOn Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician [[Franklin Webb]] reactivate the online tracking system. Owen, paleo-veterinarian [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Dr. Zia Rodriguez|Zia Rodriguez]], and a mercenary team led by [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Ken Wheatley|Ken Wheatley]], track and find Blue. The encounter escalates, resulting in Blue being shot and Wheatley [[Sedative|tranquilizing]] Owen. Wheatley then abandons Owen, Claire, and Franklin on the island while forcibly taking Zia hostage to treat Blue. The ship, loaded with captured dinosaurs, departs as the remaining dinosaurs are left behind to die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak aboard the ship and help Zia transfuse Blue with ''Tyrannosaurus'' blood to save her life.\n\nRather than being relocated to a new island, the captured dinosaurs are transported to the Lockwood estate, where Lockwood's orphaned granddaughter, [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Maisie Lockwood|Maisie]], overhears Mills and auctioneer [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Mr. Eversoll|Mr. Eversoll]] secretly planning to sell the dinosaurs on the [[black market]]. They will also preview the ''[[Indoraptor]]'', a [[Military animal|weaponized]], [[Transgene|transgenic]] dinosaur created by geneticist [[Henry Wu (character)|Dr. Henry Wu]] using ''Indominus rex'' and ''Velociraptor'' DNA. Wu needs Blue's DNA to create an enhanced ''Indoraptor'' that is obedient to commands, unaware that Blue's blood is no longer pure. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts Mills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been [[human cloning|cloned]] from Lockwood's deceased daughter and the reason why John Hammond ended their association.\n\nThe auctioned dinosaurs are being immediately shipped out. Franklin evades capture and frees Zia, but Owen and Claire have been apprehended. Owen incites a ''[[Stygimoloch]]'' into breaking open their cell. The two encounter Maisie, and they learn the ''Indoraptor'' is being sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the auction by luring the ''Stygimoloch'' into the room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the ''Indoraptor'' to extract a tooth as a trophy, but the hybrid, having merely feigned unconsciousness, kills Wheatley, Eversoll, and others as it escapes. It chases Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion until Blue, released by Zia, confronts the ''Indoraptor''. Atop a high glass roof, both animals crash through it, killing the ''Indoraptor'' and leaving Blue unharmed.\n\nWhen a [[hydrogen cyanide]] gas leak threatens the caged dinosaurs, Maisie frees them, ignoring Owen's objections. As Mills attempts to leave with the ''Indominus rex'' bone, the ''Tyrannosaurus'' devours him and tramples the bone. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin escape, while Blue and the other released dinosaurs flee the estate grounds. In a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a neo-Jurassic Age, where humans and dinosaurs must coexist. The closing scenes depict the freed dinosaurs roaming the wilderness and outer urban areas.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast arranged according to official press kit: https://jurassicoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-Production-Information.pdf -->\n{{main|List of Jurassic Park characters}}\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as [[Owen Grady]]: A [[United States Navy|Navy]] veteran and [[Ethology|ethologist]], and former ''Velociraptor'' handler for Jurassic World.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as [[Claire Dearing]]: Jurassic World's former [[Operations management|operations manager]], now a dinosaur-rights [[Activism|activist]], who has founded the Dinosaur Protection Group to save Isla Nublar's surviving dinosaurs.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Plot>{{cite news|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|title='Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' Plot Details Emerge \u2026 and They're Bonkers|url=https://collider.com/jurassic-world-2-fallen-kingdom-story/|access-date=December 5, 2017|work=Collider|date=December 5, 2017|archive-date=January 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109221515/https://collider.com/jurassic-world-2-fallen-kingdom-story/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as [[List of Jurassic Park characters#Eli Mills|Eli Mills]]: Lockwood's ambitious assistant who recruits Owen and Claire to rescue the dinosaurs.

They chose instead to use [[key frame]] animation done for the previous films. However, some motion capture was done as a form of [[previsualization]] to aid Bayona.<ref name=AWN/> ILM used key framing to create scenes involving a large number of dinosaurs and referred to [[high-speed photography]] of horses racing for aid in creating such scenes.<ref name=AWN>{{cite web |last=Robertson |first=Barbara |date=July 3, 2018 |title=How ILM Blended Practical and Digital Effects for 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' |url=https://www.awn.com/vfxworld/how-ilm-blended-practical-and-digital-effects-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom |work=[[Animation World Network]] |access-date=July 5, 2018 |archive-date=June 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611150421/https://www.awn.com/vfxworld/how-ilm-blended-practical-and-digital-effects-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom |url-status=live}}</ref> The fight scene between Blue and the ''Indoraptor'', set in Maisie's bedroom, was designed in London and key framed by ILM. Jance Rubinchik, animation supervisor for ILM, said the fight was the \"trickiest sequence\" because of the lack of previsualization.<ref name=AWN/>\n\nAccording to Bayona, a ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' shown dying in the volcanic eruption is meant to be the same individual that is first seen in the original ''Jurassic Park''. The ''Brachiosaurus'' in the new film was created using the same animations from the 1993 film.<ref name=EmpireSecrets/> The dinosaur's death was the last shot on the entire film to be finished; Bayona and the post-production team struggled to perfect the CGI of the scene with only several days left to complete it. They worked through the final night to perfect the scene's colors and composition, shortly before the film's release.<ref name=EmpireSecrets/><ref name=Interview2/>\n\nFor advice on veterinary procedures and animatronic movements, the filmmakers sought a veterinary surgeon who had experience with [[Fauna of Africa|African wildlife]]. Jonathan Cranston, a [[Gloucestershire]] veterinary surgeon, was recommended for the position because of his experience with wildlife in [[South Africa]]. He advised Bayona and the producers on how to choreograph several scenes to accurately depict complex veterinarian procedures that involved the dinosaurs. Cranston also worked closely with Pratt, Howard, Pineda and Smith to teach them how to perform such procedures. He also advised the puppeteers on creating subtle and authentic animal movements and worked with Bayona on two scenes.
