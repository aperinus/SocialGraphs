The film centers on a dance teacher who comes to the United States from India to pursue a normal career but incidentally stumbles into a brief but high-profile career as a sex guru, a career based on a philosophy he learns from a [[Pornographic actor|pornographic actress]].\n\nThe film stars [[Jimi Mistry]] as the eponymous character, [[Heather Graham]] as the actress he learns from, and [[Marisa Tomei]], who helps him reach his guru status among her [[socialite]] [[New York City]] friends.  The film was a commercial success, grossing $24 million in worldwide box office against its budget of $11 million.\n\n==Plot==\nRamu Gupta ([[Jimi Mistry]]), a dance teacher, leaves his native city [[Delhi]], [[India]], to seek his fortune in the [[United States]]. He is lured by the exaggerations of his cousin, Vijay, who [[Indian American|has already moved]] to NYC.\n\nSeeking work as an actor, the na\u00efve Ramu unknowingly lands a role in a [[pornographic film]]. That evening he accompanies Vijay and his roommates on a [[catering]] job at a society birthday party. When the Indian [[swami]] hired to address the party falls into drunken oblivion, Ramu takes his place. Lacking a real philosophy, he improvises by repeating advice he had been given by Sharonna ([[Heather Graham]]), an adult film actress he met earlier. Lexi ([[Marisa Tomei]]), the birthday girl, is so impressed that she promotes him as a [[New Age]] sex guru to her friends.\n\nRamu hires Sharonna, ostensibly for advice on how to be an actor in adult films, though what he really wants is more ideas he could use in his new role as the guru of sex. A personal relationship develops between them, though Sharonna is engaged to a firefighter who thinks she's a substitute school teacher.\n\nRamu becomes an overnight celebrity, widely known as a spiritual leader - the Guru of Sex. The fame comes at a price, however, and he must choose between his newfound fame and his feelings for Sharonna.\n\nRamu has a national television appearance where he admits to being a fraud, but passes the torch to Lexi, then hurries across town to stop Sharonna's wedding. At the door to the church Ramu coincides with her fianc\u00e9's secret gay lover Randy ([[Bobby Cannavale]]). They both object to the wedding, being in love with the bride and groom. The film ends with a Bollywood dance number.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jimi Mistry]] as Ramu Gupta\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Sharonna\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Alexandra \"Lexi\" Hamilton\n* [[Dash Mihok]] as Rusty McGee, Sharonna's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Dwain, a director of adult films\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Chantal Hamilton, Lexi's mother\n* [[Ronald Guttman]] as Edwin Hamilton, Lexi's father\n* [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Thomas McCarthy]] as Lars Hamilton, Lexi's brother\n* [[Emil Marwa]] as Vijay Rao, Ramu's cousin\n* [[Ajay Naidu]] as Sanjiv, Vijay's roommate\n* Charles Singh as Amit, Vijay's roommate\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Randy, Rusty's gay lover\n* [[Malachy McCourt]] as Father Flannigan\n* [[Sanjeev Bhaskar]] as Chef\n* [[Anita Gillette]] as Mrs. McGee, Rusty's mother\n* Pat McNamara as Mr. McGee, Rusty's father\n* Sinia Jane as Mrs. Gupta, Rumu's mother\n* Anoop Puri as Mr. Gupta, Rumu's father\n* [[Rizwan Manji]] as Party Waiter\n* [[Damian Young]] as Hank, the camera man\n* [[Dwight Ewell]] as Peaches, Sharonna's friend\n* Alex Khan as Young Ramu Gupta\n* [[Sakina Jaffery]] as a young woman in Dance class\n\n==Production==\n''The Guru'' was filmed in 2001, mostly on location in [[New York City]], though a few scenes were filmed in [[Delhi]].<ref name=\"prodnotes\">[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/guruproductionx19x08x02 Production Notes for ''The Guru''] from contactmusic.com</ref>\n\nLocations in New York City included [[Times Square]], [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Manhattan's Chinatown]], [[Central Park]], [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]], [[Queens]], [[Brooklyn]], the [[George Washington Bridge]], and close to the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] (the shot was not removed after the [[September 11 attacks]]).
