The screenplay was written by [[Carl Reiner]] from a story by [[Larry Gelbart]].\n\nReiner had originally conceived the project for [[Judy Holliday]], who developed cancer and had to bow out of the project, according to Reiner's reminiscence during his videotaped \"[[Archive of American Television]]\" interview.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story centers around suburban housewife Beverly Boyer and her husband, a successful [[obstetrician]] and devoted family man, Gerald. Beverly is offered the opportunity to star in a [[television]] commercial advertising Happy Soap. After a shaky start, she gets a contract for nearly $80,000 per year (about ${{Inflation|US|80000|1963|r=-4|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to appear in weekly TV commercials.\n\nSoon the soap company places greater and greater demands on the unlikely TV star. Gerald resents the fact that the appearances are taking up an increasing amount of her time, and becomes jealous of the level of attention that her new-found stardom has brought her. Their relationship slowly deteriorates, and Gerald leaves her after unintentionally driving his 1958 Chevrolet convertible into the surprise swimming pool the soap company built where their garage used to be.  Gerald later returns, employing psychological warfare to make Beverly jealous by pretending that he is drinking and carousing with multiple women.  After a harrowing, bonding experience involving an expectant couple with whom they have become friendly, Beverly decides to give up her lucrative career and return to her \"philandering\" husband and her life as a housewife and mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Doris Day]] as Beverly Boyer\n* [[James Garner]] as Dr. Gerald Boyer\n* [[Arlene Francis]] as Mrs. Fraleigh\n* [[Edward Andrews]] as Gardiner Fraleigh\n* [[Reginald Owen]] as Old Tom Fraleigh\n* [[ZaSu Pitts]] as Olivia\n* [[Elliott Reid]] as Mike Palmer\n* [[Alice Pearce]] as Irving's Wife\n* [[Kym Karath]] as Maggie Boyer\n* Brian Nash as Andy Boyer\n* Lucy Landau as Mrs. Goethe\n* [[Paul Hartman]] as Dr. Taylor\n* [[Burt Mustin]] as the Fraleighs' butler\n\n[[Carl Reiner]], one of the two screenwriters of the film, makes brief appearances as a character actor appearing on TV in various nasty roles (World War II German Officer / Cad / Western Gunslinger).\n\n==Production==\nThe film was announced in 1962. Hunter wanted to reunite Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald by having them play support parts.<ref name=\"fonda\">FILMMAKER TALKS ABOUT 5 PROJECTS: Hunter, Here in Visit, Tells of MacDonald-Eddy Plan 'Tammy Takes Over' Is Next Joanne Woodward to Star British Film Opens Today 7 Vie for Golden Laurel Albert Lamorisse Visits\nBy HOWARD THOMPSON.

''The Thrill of It All'' and ''Move Over, Darling'' were almost equally huge box office hits, with the first film released in July and the second opening on [[Christmas Day]].\n\n==Reception==\n''The Thrill of It All'' was the [[1963 in film|16th biggest hit of the year]], grossing $11,779,093 domestically.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> It earned $6 million in US [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]].<ref>\"All-Time Top Grossers\", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 8 January 1964 p 69</ref>\n\nGarner wrote the film was \"better than it should have been... because of Doris.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Garner Files: A Memoir|first1=James|last1=Garner|first2=Jon|last2=Winokur|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2011|page=254}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1963]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0057581|The Thrill of It All (1963)}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the_thrill_of_it_all}}\n* {{AllMovie title|49785|The Thrill of It All!
