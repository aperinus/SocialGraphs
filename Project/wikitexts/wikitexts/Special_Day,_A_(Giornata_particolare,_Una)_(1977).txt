Set in [[Rome]] in 1938, its narrative follows a woman and her neighbor who stay home the day [[Adolf Hitler]] visits [[Benito Mussolini]]. It is an [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]]-Canadian co-production.\n\nThemes addressed in the film include [[gender roles]], [[fascism]], and the persecution of [[homosexuals]] under the Mussolini regime. It received several nominations and awards, including a [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film]], a [[35th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for Best Foreign Language Film, and two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations in 1978. It is featured on the list of the [[100 film italiani da salvare|100 Italian films to be saved]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Una giornata particolare2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Gabriele ([[Marcello Mastroianni|Mastroianni]]) and Antonietta ([[Sophia Loren|Loren]]) in her living room]]\nOn May 4, 1938, the day Hitler visits Mussolini in Rome, Antonietta, a na\u00efve, sentimental and overworked homemaker, stays home doing her usual domestic tasks, while her [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] husband, Emanuele, and their six spoiled children take to the streets to follow a parade. The building is empty, except for the caretaker and a neighbor across the complex, a charming man named Gabriele. He is a radio broadcaster who has been dismissed from his job and is about to be deported to [[Sardinia]] because of his homosexuality and alleged [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] stance. After the family's [[myna]] escapes from their apartment and flies outside Gabriele's window, Antonietta shows up at his door, asking to be let in to reach the bird. Gabriele has been interrupted from [[attempted suicide|attempting suicide]], but helps rescue the myna by offering it food, and is amused by the episode. Antonietta is surprised by his demeanor and, unaware of his sexual orientation, flirts and dances the [[rhumba|rumba]] with him.\n\nDespite their differences, they warm to each other. The caretaker warns Antonietta that Gabriele is an [[anti-fascist]], which Antonietta finds despicable. Gabriele eventually opens up, confessing he was fired because he is a homosexual. Antonietta confides in him her troubles with her arrogant and unfaithful husband; who, she says, has shown a preference for an educated woman. Throughout their interaction and conversation, each realize that the other is oppressed by social and governmental conditioning and come to form a new impression than the one they first drew from one another. As a result, they have sex, but for different reasons. Gabriele explains that this changes nothing; as does Antonietta. (However, later, when her son reminds his mother of all the newspaper clippings she will have from the parade for her album collection, Antonietta's face reveals a look of slight indifference.)  Soon after their intimate encounter, Antonietta's family comes back home and Gabriele is arrested. At the end, Antonietta sits near the window and starts reading a book Gabriele has given to her (''[[The Three Musketeers]]''). She watches as her lover leaves the complex, escorted by fascist policemen, before turning off the light and retiring to bed: Her husband is waiting there for her in order to beget their seventh child, whom he wants to name Adolfo.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sophia Loren]] \u2013 Antonietta\n* [[Marcello Mastroianni]] \u2013 Gabriele\n* [[John Vernon]] \u2013 Emanuele, Antonietta's husband\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Berd]] \u2013 Caretaker (Pauletta)\n* Patrizia Basso \u2013 Romana\n* Tiziano De Persio \u2013 Arnaldo\n* Maurizio Di Paolantonio \u2013 Fabio\n* Antonio Garibaldi \u2013 Littorio\n* [[Vittorio Guerrieri]] \u2013 Umberto\n* [[Alessandra Mussolini]] \u2013 Maria Luisa\n* Nicole Magny \u2013 Officer's Daughter\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nMuch of the film's themes revolve around [[gender role]]s and the [[model of masculinity under fascist Italy]]. Antonietta is the ''donna madre'', a mother figure who meets her feminine responsibilities in the regime by having six children, boasting one more will secure her the government bonus established for large families in 1933.{{sfn|Reich|2004|p=133}} The Fascist regime equates homosexuality with depopulation, and thus, Gabriele is suspected of treason.{{sfn|Reich|2004|pp=133-134}} The [[bachelor tax]] of 1926 was a measure against this, and Gabriele has to pay it.{{sfn|Reich|2004|p=134}} While the stay-at-home mother and homosexual neighbor would seem to be an improbable pairing, both are minimized by the regime, and find comfort and some sympathy in each other.{{sfn|Ponzanesi|2014}} At the end of the film, domestic life will continue as usual, but \"inner resistance\" to Fascism has been awakened.<ref name=\"Young\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3745-a-special-day-small-victories |title=A Special Day: Small Victories |last=Young |first=Deborah  |date=15 October 2015 |access-date=30 January 2017 |work=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Nunzio Filogamo.jpg|150px|thumb|Italian broadcaster [[Nunzio Filogamo]] was an inspiration for the film.]]\n[[Maurizio Costanzo]], [[Ruggero Maccari]] and [[Ettore Scola]] wrote the screenplay, after Maccari had learned about an incident in [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] in which homosexuals were arrested and taken to [[Sardinia]].
