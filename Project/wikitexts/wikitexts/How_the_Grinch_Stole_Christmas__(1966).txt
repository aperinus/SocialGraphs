(also known as '''''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!''''') is a 1966 American animated [[television special]], directed and co-produced by [[Chuck Jones]]. It is based on the 1957 children's book [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|of the same name]] by [[Dr. Seuss]], and tells the story of the [[Grinch]], who tries to ruin Christmas for the townsfolk of [[Whoville]] below his mountain hideaway.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Animated TV Specials: The Complete Directory to the First Twenty-Five Years, 1962\u20131987 |date=1989 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-2198-2 |access-date=27 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool/page/120/mode/2up |pages=121\u2013122}}</ref> Originally telecast in the United States on [[CBS]] on December 18, 1966, it went on to become a perennial holiday special. The special features the voice of [[Boris Karloff]] as the Grinch and the narrator.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Grinch is a surly asocial green creature with a heart \"two sizes too small\" who lives alone in a cave atop Mt. Crumpit, located above the village of Whoville. He especially hates Christmas and has always been annoyed by the town's Christmas celebrations. One [[Christmas Eve]], he finally decides to stop [[Christmas Day]] from coming to Whoville by disguising himself as [[Santa Claus]], his dog Max as a [[reindeer]] and, in a reversal of Santa's visit, steal all presents, decorations and symbols of Christmas. Once loaded, he plans on dumping the bags of stolen goods. His is noticed by a girl named Cindy Lou Who, but is otherwise undetected.\n\nAs the Grinch reaches the summit of Mt. Crumpit, ready to dump the bags, he discovers that the citizens of Whoville, despite having no gifts or decorations, have gathered in the middle of town to sing as Christmas Day dawns. Realizing that Christmas means more than just material possessions, the Grinch's heart grows three sizes. He saves the sleigh, returns the presents and the other belongings to the Whos, and joins in the town's Christmas celebration, by carving the roast beast, and Max gets the first slice.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as the [[Grinch]] / Narrator\n* [[June Foray]] as Cindy Lou Who\n* [[Dallas McKennon]] as Max\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as Singer\n\n== Credits ==\n* Produced by [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Dr. Seuss|Ted Geisel]]\n* Directed by [[Chuck Jones]]\n* The Songs: \n** Lyrics by [[Dr. Seuss]] \n** Music by [[Albert Hague]]\n* Additional Music and Orchestra by Eugene Poddany\n* Production Design: [[Maurice Noble]]\n* Animation: [[Ben Washam]], [[Ken Harris]], [[Lloyd Vaughan]], [[Richard Thompson (animator)|Richard Thompson]], [[Don Towsley (animator)|Don Towsley]], [[Tom Ray]] and [[Phil Roman|Philip Roman]]\n* Layouts: Oscar Dufau and Don Morgan\n* Backgrounds: Philip DeGuard, [[Robert Inman|Bob Inman]] and Hal Ashmead\n* Graphics: Don Foster\n* Additional Story: Irv Spector and [[Bob Ogle]]\n* Co-Director: [[Ben Washam]]\n* Editors: Lovell Norman and John Young\n* Production Manager: Earl Jonas\n* Production Executive: Les Goldman\n\n== Production ==\nDirector [[Chuck Jones]] and children's-book author Ted Geisel ([[Dr. Seuss]]) had worked together on the ''[[Private Snafu]]'' training cartoons at [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] during World War II.<ref name=toonopedia /><ref>Jones. pg. 263</ref> Jones was interested in adapting one of Geisel's books into a television special and approached him to turn ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' into one in time for the holiday season. Although Geisel was initially reluctant due to his unpleasant experiences making the film ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.]]'', he eventually agreed. ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' was produced by The Cat in the Hat Productions in association with the [[MGM Television|television]] and [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|animation]] divisions of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Studios, where Jones was under contract at the time. CBS, coming off the surprise success of ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' a year before, allotted Jones and MGM a $315,000 budget (around $2,465,000 in 2018), more than four times what [[Bill Melendez]] was offered to produce ''A Charlie Brown Christmas''.<ref name=karloff/>\n\nJones questioned how to make a Christmas special without the typical elements (orthodox religion, Santa, etc.). He came up with an answer, which Jones said \"Write our new carols in [[Dog Latin|Seussian Latin]]. After all, 'Fahoofores, Dahoodores' seems to have much authenticity as 'Adeste fideles' to those unauthored in Latin.\". The song \"Trim Up the Tree\" was written in a square-dance type form by [[Albert Hague]].<ref>Jones. pg. 270</ref> Due to Cindy Lou Who's appealing cute design, Jones redesigned her as seeming to be the great-granddaughter of the Grinch in appearance, reluctantly having her role parted down, which broke Jones' heart.<ref>Jones. pg. 272</ref> The character Max was set up as an observer and victim, and, according to the animation director, in the same way as [[Porky Pig]] and [[Daffy Duck]] in ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24\u00bdth Century|Duck Dodgers]]'' or ''[[Robin Hood Daffy]]''.<ref>Jones. pg. 271</ref> The special required eleven to fourteen months of production time, 15,000 drawings and cels, 250 background layout drawings, 1,200 character layout drawings, 60 musicians working for 8 hours to finish the special.<ref>Jones. pg. 278</ref>\n\nThe original broadcast was sponsored by the Foundation for Full Service Banks, whose sponsor plugs within the original airing were later edited out for subsequent broadcasts.<ref>Jones, pg. 276</ref> The entirety of the book's text, with some slight embellishment, was adapted into the special; to pad the special to a full 30-minute time slot, songs and animated sequences without words (the longest being an extended scene in which the Grinch and Max comically descend into Whoville) were added. As all the [[Big Three television networks|major networks]] had flipped to full [[color television|color]] schedules by 1966, the special was likewise produced in color, establishing the Grinch's color (white in the two-tone illustrations of the original book) as green, a convention used in later television specials featuring the character as well as the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|2000]] live-action and [[The Grinch (film)|2018]] 3D animated film adaptations.\n\n== Broadcast ==\nThe half-hour (with commercials) short was originally telecast in the United States on [[CBS]] on December 18, 1966.<ref name=toonopedia>[http://www.toonopedia.com/grinch.htm Grinch] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

MGM had earlier released it on DVD in 1997. The 1997 DVD release featured another Seuss-based special, ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'', while the 2000 DVD also added an audio commentary by lead animator [[Phil Roman]] and June Foray, interviews with Albert Hague and Thurl Ravenscroft, and the \"Special Edition\" documentary which aired alongside the special on TNT in 1994. The DVD was well-received for these bonus features, but also criticized for its sub-par picture quality; many critics pointed out that the Grinch looked yellow, not green, in this release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/grinchhorton.shtml |title=DVD Movie Guide: Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas/Horton Hears A Who!: Special Edition (1966) review |publisher=Dvdmg.com |access-date=December 15, 2011 |archive-date=January 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103220052/http://dvdmg.com/grinchhorton.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe special was re-released on DVD in 2006 and labeled as a \"50th Birthday Deluxe Edition\".

CD releases include albums produced by Island (1995) and Mercury Records. In the recorded version, Boris Karloff does all voices including Cindy Lou Who. The song \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\", which comically describes the level of the Grinch's despicable nature, includes all verses with their original rhyming lyrics and the isolated song tracks have different durations due to being re-recorded.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOn October 5, 1999, [[Rhino Entertainment]] released a new CD soundtrack (which included the soundtrack for another Dr. Seuss cartoon, ''[[Horton Hears a Who!
