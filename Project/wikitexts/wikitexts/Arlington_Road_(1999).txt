The film tells the story of a widowed [[George Washington University]] professor who suspects his new neighbors are involved in [[terrorism]] and becomes obsessed with foiling their terrorist plot. The film was heavily inspired by the paranoid culture of the 1990s concerning the [[militia organizations in the United States|right-wing militia movement]], [[Ruby Ridge]], the [[Waco siege]] and [[Oklahoma City Bombing]].\n\n[[Ehren Kruger]] wrote the script, which won the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]' (AMPAS) [[Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting|Nicholl Fellowship]] in 1996. The film was to have been originally released by [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]], but the film's United States distribution rights were sold to [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] for $6 million.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/15/business/fi-10419|title = Archives| website=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref> The eventual release was the second title for [[Screen Gems]] (and its first wide theatrical release) while PolyGram (now part of [[Universal Studios]]) handled foreign rights.\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Faraday (Bridges) is a widower and college history professor at [[George Washington University]] with a 10-year-old son named Grant. One day, Michael encounters a boy, Brady, stumbling in the middle of a road in his neighborhood with horrific injuries to his hands. Michael takes him to the hospital and meets the boy's parents Oliver (Robbins) and Cheryl (Cusack) Lang, discovering they are his neighbors. They soon become friends, and their sons join the Discoverers, a Boy Scouts-style group.\n\nActions of the Langs arouse suspicion in Michael, who sees blueprints in the Langs' house which are not for the building project that Oliver, a structural engineer, claims, and a misdirected letter suggesting he lied about where he attended college. When Michael laments the FBI's lack of contrition after his wife Leah, an FBI agent, was killed in the line of duty, Oliver states that the government should be punished for its mistakes. Michael's girlfriend, Brooke, and Leah's former FBI partner, Whit Carver dismiss Michael's concerns as paranoia.\n\nMichael takes his college class on a field trip to the site of the standoff in which his wife was killed, where he passionately excoriates the FBI for failing to sufficiently investigate the besieged family and for provoking the standoff. Michael's students appear uneasy.\n\nOliver tells Michael that Grant wishes someone could be punished for his mother's death, which again rouses Michael's suspicion. He discovers in archives that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he tried to blow up a post office in Kansas at age 16. He is seen by Oliver, who later confronts and berates him. Oliver states that he sought revenge on the government for causing his father's suicide, that he was imprisoned, and admits to changing his identity to hide his past from his children.\n\nMichael appears to let the matter drop. However, a few days later, Brooke sees Oliver swap cars with a stranger in a parking lot, and follows him to a delivery depot where a number of metal boxes are exchanged. From a pay phone, she leaves Michael a message that his suspicions may have been correct, but is discovered by Cheryl.\n\nMichael learns of Brooke's (off-screen) death on the news, where it appears she died in a car crash. The next day, Michael inadvertently discovers that messages left on his answering machine had been erased. Again suspecting foul play, Michael phones Whit about Oliver/William and asks him to check FBI records and records of calls to his home.\n\nMichael visits the father of the late Dean Scobee, accused of blowing up a federal building in St. Louis, from where the Langs had moved. The elder Scobee is certain his son was innocent since 10 children died in the bombing. Michael becomes convinced Dean was set up when he sees him in a photo with Brady, with whom Grant is on a Discoverer field trip, and rushes in a panic to retrieve him. Troop leaders tell him that Grant was taken home with Brady. Michael confronts Oliver at his home, where he confirms that his group killed Brooke.\n\nThe next day Whit accosts Michael, stating the FBI discovered nothing suspicious about Oliver/William or his acquaintances, and says that Michael's 'missing' telephone message was from a pay phone. The following morning, Michael slips out of his house, rents a car under a false name, drives to the pay phone where Brooke made the phone call, and sees a passing delivery vehicle. He follows it to its depot, where he sees some men he recognizes from Oliver's house, and from Discoverer photographs, loading metal boxes into the van.\n\nMichael follows the van and is shocked to see Grant at the window. Oliver intercepts Michael's car and beats him, promising to kill Grant. Oliver expounds on his group's anti-government mission, and their current target: the [[J. Edgar Hoover Building]], the FBI's headquarters. Michael overpowers Oliver and drives to the FBI headquarters, calling Whit to warn him.\n\nMichael sees a delivery van at the gate to the FBI building and illegally pursues it into the secure parking garage, but discovers that it is a different van and is empty. Whit tells Michael that he is the only unauthorized person in the building. Michael rushes back to his own car, discovering a bomb in the trunk seconds before it detonates. The blast partially collapses the FBI headquarters, as Oliver watches from a distance.\n\nA montage of news clips, which portray Michael as a [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lonewolf]] terrorist seeking revenge on the FBI for Leah's death, show that the Langs have successfully framed him. Statements from Michael's students (one of whom is a conspirator) support the official story, giving accounts of his erratic and paranoid behavior and implying that he held a dangerous grudge against the FBI. Grant, now orphaned, moves in with relatives, unaware of his father's innocence.\n\nIn the final scene, Oliver and Cheryl have put their house up for sale and prepare to move to another suburban neighborhood where they will plan their next terrorist attack, as well as look for another fall guy to take the blame for their group's actions as they did with Michael and others before him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Michael Faraday\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Oliver Lang/William Fenimore\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Cheryl Lang/Fenimore\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Brooke Wolfe\n* [[Robert Gossett]] as FBI Agent Whit Carver\n* [[Spencer Treat Clark]] as Grant Faraday\n* [[Mason Gamble]] as Brady Lang/Fenimore\n* [[Stanley Anderson]] as Dr. Archer Scobee\n* Laura Poe as FBI Agent Leah Faraday\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nSony paid $6 million to acquire the film's United States distribution rights.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\"/> It opened at #6 in its opening weekend with $7,515,145 behind ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', ''[[Wild Wild West]]''{{'}}s second, ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]''{{'}}s third, and ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' and ''[[The General's Daughter (film)|The General's Daughter]]''{{'}}s fourth weekends.<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1999&wknd=28&p=.htm Weekend Box Office Results for July 9-11, 1999 - Box Office Mojo<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The film eventually grossed $24,756,177 in the United States theatrically.<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=arlingtonroad.htm Arlington Road (1999) - Box Office Mojo<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe film made a worldwide gross of $41 million on a budget of $31 million.<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=arlingtonroad.htm Arlington Road (1999) - Box Office Mojo<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film holds a 63% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 91 reviews. with the site's consensus stating; \"A suspenseful thriller led by strong cast performances built around a somewhat implausible story.\"<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/arlington_road/ Arlington Road \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a 2/4 rating by [[Roger Ebert]],<ref name=Ebert>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/arlington-road-1999|title=Arlington Road|author=Ebert, Roger|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|website=RogerEbert.com|date=July 9, 1999}}</ref> who wrote of the film:<blockquote>''Arlington Road'' is a thriller that contains ideas.
