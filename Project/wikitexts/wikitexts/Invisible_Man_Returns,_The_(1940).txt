The film stars [[Cedric Hardwicke]], [[Vincent Price]], [[Nan Grey]] and [[John Sutton (actor)|John Sutton]]. The film is a sequel to the 1933 film ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'', and the second film in the [[The Invisible Man (film series)|''Invisible Man'' film series]]. The film is about Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe (Price) who is condemned for a murder he did not commit, which leads to him begging Dr. Frank Griffin (Sutton) to inject him with the invisibility serum despite Griffin's warning that the serum will drive him mad.\n\nFollowing the commercial success of ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', Universal Studios announced the development of ''The Invisible Man Returns'' in March 1939. The film went through a few screenwriters and directors before choosing [[Joe May]] to direct and Lester K. Cole and [[Curt Siodmak]] to write the script. Production went behind schedule early into the production and led to late night filming and production ending in November. The film was released on January 12, 1940. The [[special effects]] by [[John P. Fulton]], [[Bernard B. Brown]] and [[William Hedgcock]] received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar nomination]] in the category [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Special Effects]].\n\n==Plot==\nSir Geoffrey Radcliffe ([[Vincent Price]]) is sentenced to death for the murder of his brother Michael, a crime he did not commit. Dr. Frank Griffin, the brother of the original invisible man injects the prisoner with an invisibility drug. As Radcliffe's execution nears, he suddenly vanishes from his cell. Detective Sampson ([[Cecil Kellaway]]) from Scotland Yard guesses the truth while Radcliffe searches for the real murderer before the drug causes him to go insane.\n\nThe Radcliffe family owns a mining operation. The recently hired employee Willie Spears ([[Alan Napier]]) is suddenly promoted within the company, stirring Radcliffe's suspicions. After forcing Spears' car off the road, Spears is frightened into revealing that Richard Cobb (Sir [[Cedric Hardwicke]]), Radcliffe's cousin, is the murderer. After a confrontation, a chase scene ensues during which Radcliffe is struck by a bullet from Sampson. Cobb is fatally injured by falling from a coal wagon but confesses to the murder before he dies.\n\nNow cleared of all wrongdoing, Radcliffe, dying from blood loss and exposure, makes his way to Dr. Griffin. A number of Radcliffe's employees volunteer to donate blood to Radcliffe. The transfusion succeeds, making Radcliffe visible again, allowing the doctor to operate and save his life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Sir Cedric Hardwicke]] as Richard Cobb, Geoffrey's Cousin \n* [[Vincent Price]] as Geoffrey Radcliffe Aka The Invisible Man \n* [[Nan Grey]] as Helen Manson, Geoffrey's Fianc\u00e9 \n* [[John Sutton (actor)|John Sutton]] as Dr. Frank Griffin, Helen and Geoffrey's Friend \n* [[Cecil Kellaway]] as Inspector Sampson\n* [[Alan Napier]] as Willie Spears, The Superintendent and Former Night Watchman of the coal factory \n* [[Forrester Harvey]] as Ben Jenkins, One of Geoffrey's Friends \n* [[Paul England (actor)|Paul England]] as Detective\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Pre-production===\n[[Universal Pictures]] first announced the development of ''The Invisible Man Returns'' in March 1939, around the time ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' had found itself doing decently in the box office.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=208}} In May, [[Joe May]] was announced as the director of the film with either [[Boris Karloff]] or [[Bela Lugosi]] hinted at playing the lead.{{sfn|Weaver|Brunas|Brunas|2007|p=208}} Days after this announcement, [[Rowland V.
