It was directed by [[Kenneth Johnson (producer)|Kenneth Johnson]] and starred [[Fisher Stevens]] as Ben Jahveri, [[Michael McKean]] as Fred Ritter, [[Cynthia Gibb]] as Sandy Banatoni, and [[Tim Blaney]] as the voice of Johnny 5 (the main character &ndash; a friendly, naive, [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] [[robot]]).\n\n==Plot==\nAfter being fired from Nova Robotics over the events of the first movie, Benjamin Jahveri (nee Jabituya) starts up his own business, \"Titanic Toy Corporation\", which specializes in making [[Entertainment robot|sophisticated toy robots]] that he builds by hand from the back of his truck. For two days, Ben has been in a big city implied to be [[New York City]] peddling his toy robots on the street corners. One robot wanders away from his stand and makes its way into the office of Sandy Banatoni, an assistant buyer for [[Simpsons (department store)|Simpsons]]' toy department. Sandy tracks Ben down and orders 1,000 of his toys. Overhearing this offer is [[con artist]] Fred Ritter, who smooth-talks his way into brokering the transaction between Ben and Sandy, becoming Ben's business partner in the deal, and later acquires the funding Ben needs from a loan shark.\n\nBen and Fred, with some new workers, move into a derelict warehouse which, unknown to them, is the base of operations for thieves who are tunneling into a bank vault across the street to steal a set of jewels known as the Vanderveer Collection. The thieves (Saunders and Jones) get angry at Ben and Fred, attack them and destroy their equipment, causing the new workers to run away and preventing them from completing Sandy's order. However, Ben's friends Stephanie Speck and Newton Crosby have sent Johnny 5, a robot who became sentient after being struck by lightning whom Ben helped to create. When Saunders and Jones return, Johnny fends them off, then sets up self-defense mechanisms should they try to break in again. Johnny sets to work mass-producing the toys to meet Sandy's deadline but later leaves to explore the city. He runs afoul of many people, who are rude and unfriendly. He befriends one man, Oscar Baldwin, who works at the bank across the street from Ben and Fred's warehouse.\n\nFred, having learned that Johnny is worth $11 million, tries to sell the robot. Discovering this, Johnny escapes into the city, is taken into police custody, and is placed in the stolen goods warehouse, where he is claimed by Ben. Johnny uses his robotic abilities to help Ben court Sandy.\n\nWith time running out before the Vanderveer Collection is moved from the bank, Saunders and Jones angrily lock Ben and Fred in the freezer of Doo Wah's Chinese Restaurant and Deli to keep them out of the way. It is revealed that Oscar is the mastermind of the heist, and he tricks Johnny into finishing the tunnel leading to the vault. Ben and Fred get Sandy to save them, using [[Polyphony|polyphonic renditions]] of songs that Ben learned on his date with her as clues to their location. Having discovered the Vanderveer Collection, Johnny deduces Oscar's true intentions and is severely attacked by Saunders and Jones per Oscar\u2019s orders. As Ben, Fred and Sandy return to the warehouse, the police arrest Ben and Sandy as suspects in the bank vault break-in just as Fred goes outside and searches the city for Johnny. Fred finds Johnny in an alley, is horrified at Johnny\u2019s damages, and tells Johnny of Ben\u2019s arrest. \n\nFred attempts to repair Johnny by breaking into a [[Radio Shack]] and follows Johnny's guidance, but with limited success. Ben and Sandy are cleared of any charges for the break-in and persuade the police to help locate Johnny. An enraged Johnny vows revenge for Oscar\u2019s betrayal, and with Fred\u2019s help, tracks down Oscar and his accomplices. Saunders and Jones are caught by Fred and Johnny and later arrested by the police. However, Oscar attacks Fred, escapes, steals a boat, and flees. With not much time left on his backup battery, Johnny ensues a dockside chase, finds and uses a crane, and swings down Tarzan-style to capture Oscar, who is then apprehended by the police. Ben, Fred, and Sandy also arrive and tend to an exhausted Johnny while the last of his power supply depletes. Ben revives Johnny with a [[defibrillator]].\n\nJohnny is fully repaired and becomes a celebrity, while Sandy, Ben, and Fred start a new company called \"Input Inc.\" with Johnny as its mascot. He and Ben later take the [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|Oath of Allegiance]] to [[naturalization|become]] [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizens]]. After the ceremony, when questioned by reporters about his thoughts on becoming the country's first robotic citizen, a gold-plated Johnny leaps into the air and exclaims to the press, \"I feel alive!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tim Blaney]] as the voice of Johnny 5\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Benjamin Jabituya Jahveri\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Fred Ritter\n* [[Cynthia Gibb]] as Sandy Banatoni\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Oscar Baldwin\n* [[David Hemblen]] as Jones\n* Dee McCafferty as Saunders\n* [[Don Lake]] as Manic Mike\n* [[Ally Sheedy]], as Stephanie Speck (voice only, uncredited)\n* [[Gerry Parkes]] as the Priest\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] of the film took place between September 13 and December 1987 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]<ref name=\"catalog.afi.com\"/> Despite the film taking place in an American [[metropolis]], much of the shots throughout the film featured prominent [[downtown Toronto]] landmarks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://torontoist.com/2008/03/_in_our_very_fi/|title=Reel Toronto: Short Circuit 2|date=March 25, 2008|website=Torontoist}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096101/locations|title=Short Circuit 2 (1988) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> Five robots were used for filming the \"Johnny 5\" character.
