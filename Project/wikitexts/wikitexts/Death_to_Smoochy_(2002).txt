Despite appearing friendly and playful on-screen, he is actually an alcoholic and criminal.  The FBI arrest him for accepting bribes and he is fired, his show is canceled, and he is thrown out of his penthouse and left homeless.  Kidnet orders executive Marion Stokes to hire a new host who is \"squeaky clean\", Stokes selects the naive Sheldon Mopes and his character Smoochy the Rhino.  Mopes is uniquely sincere and dedicated to providing quality children's entertainment, which puts him at odds with his new producer Nora Wells.  The Smoochy Show quickly becomes tremendously popular, causing Rainbow Randolph to fixate his anger on Mopes.  Randolph turns to Stokes and pleads for help to get his job back, but Stokes refuses.  The deranged Randolph then hatches several poorly planned attempts to get Mopes fired, all of which fail.  Finally hitting rock bottom, Randolph turns to his former partner Angelo Pike for help.  Angelo feeds Randolph and allows him to stay at his apartment.\n\nMopes finds himself losing creative control over his show and hires corrupt talent agent Burke Bennett to renegotiate his contract.  Bennett introduces Mopes to the dark side of the entertainment business by giving him a gun and trying to convince him to work with a corrupt charity.  While having dinner with Burke, Mopes is introduced to mobster Tommy Cotter.  Tommy pressures Mopes into giving her cousin Spinner a role on his show, and Mopes casts him as Smoochy's cousin Moochy.  Tommy tells Mopes that in return for casting Spinner, she will make sure he is protected.\n\nBurke becomes impatient with Mopes and books him to star in a Smoochy ice show, run by Merv Green and his corrupt charity Parade Of Hope.  Mopes refuses to do the show despite Burke's warnings, in response Green personally threatens Mopes to do the show.  In the meantime, Randolph manages to trick Mopes into performing his Smoochy act at a Neo-Nazi rally.  Mopes is branded a racist and loses his job and show, and Nora refuses to help him. Randolph visits Nora to ask for his job back but accidentally reveals that he set Mopes up.  Nora tells Tommy, who tracks down Randolph with her crew and force him to confess that he tricked Mopes.  Sheldon's reputation and show are restored and the media dubs Randolph the most hated man in America.  Angelo kicks Randolph out of his apartment after Randolph angrily destroys the TV.  Nora and Mopes reconnect and begin a romantic relationship.\n\nMopes decides to host his own ice show, without the corrupt charities involved.  Burke and Stokes, under pressure from Green, plot to kill Mopes and hire a new host who will accommodate their corruption.  Their plan backfires when Green's men mistake Spinner in his Moochy costume for Mopes and murder him.  An enraged Tommy retaliates by killing Green and his men. Randolph confronts Mopes and Nora in their apartment at gunpoint and reveals that Nora had affairs with several kid show hosts, including Randolph himself.  Mopes manages to calm Randolph down and disarm him, allowing Randolph to remain in the apartment until Mopes could explain everything to the police.\n\nBurke and Stokes decide to hire former Kidnet host Buggy Ding Dong to kill Sheldon during the ice show. Randolph intervenes and saves Mopes by killing Buggy.  Mopes realizes that Burke and Stokes set him up and threatens Burke with a gun.  Tommy and her crew arrive in time to stop Mopes and Tommy decides to handle the matter herself (murdering them offscreen, in a deleted scene).  Mopes and Nora kiss in Times Square, and Smoochy and Randolph launch a new show together alongside Nora, who becomes an ice skater.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robin Williams]] as \"Rainbow\" Randolph Smiley, a former kid show host who fell from grace after being arrested for accepting bribes.  The loss of his job and home cause Randolph to become emotionally disturbed, and he becomes fixated on getting Mopes fired so that he can return to his old life.  \n* [[Edward Norton]] as Sheldon Mopes/Smoochy the Rhino, a struggling entertainer whom Kidnet taps as Rainbow Randolph's replacement.  He is considered \"squeaky clean\" as he lives a scandal-free life and teaches positivity and healthy living with his act.  He is also very naive, and struggles to adapt to the dark world of television.  \n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Burke Bennett, a corrupt [[talent agent]] who represents Mopes in his contract negotiations with Kidnet.  Burke is involved in embezzling money from charity events that his clients host, and he pressures Mopes to cooperate with the scheme.\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Nora Wells, a [[television producer]] who coordinates the filming of Kidnet's shows.  She and Mopes clash at first, but develop a romantic relationship.  \n* [[Jon Stewart]] as Marion Frank Stokes, a Kidnet executive who oversees the network programming.  He is also involved in embezzling money and is torn between the network's orders and the pressure he receives to get skimmed money flowing again.  \n* [[Pam Ferris]] as Tommy Cotter, a boss in the [[Irish mob]].  She convinces Mopes to give her cousin Spinner a part on TV, and to show her gratitude she vows to protect Mopes from harm.\n* [[Michael Rispoli]] as Spinner Dunn/Moochy the Rhino, a retired boxer with [[brain damage]] who becomes obsessed with the Smoochy Show.  Mopes gives Spinner the role of Moochy at the urging of Tommy Cotter.\n* [[Harvey Fierstein]] as Merv Green, the morally corrupt organizer of the Parade of Hope charity.  Green uses Kidnet talent to host fundraising [[ice show]]s, with the proceeds syphoned off for personal gain.  \n* [[Danny Woodburn]] as Angelo Pike, a former cast member on Rainbow Randolph's show who goes to work for the Smoochy show.  He is the only person willing to help the deranged Randolph, giving him a place to stay and taking care of him.  \n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Buggy Ding Dong, another former Kidnet show host who ends up a homeless [[heroin]] addict.  In desperation, Burke and Stokes hire him to murder Mopes with the promise of getting his old show back if he succeeds.\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as the Chairman of Kidnet.  He orders Stokes to find a new show host that won't generate any controversy.\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Ben Franks\n\n== Production ==\n===Preproduction===\nIn November or December 2000, screenwriter [[Adam Resnick]] wrote the screenplay for the film, while art designers sketched designs for the characters for the film. In the original screenplay, the Smoochy costume was orange. The final film used a pink costume instead.\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began in January 2001. Sequences were filmed in several locations in [[New York City]] such as [[Times Square]], [[Coney Island]], [[Upper West Side]] and Duane Street in [[Lower Manhattan]]. A brief shot of the [[1 World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] can be seen where Rainbow Randolph is dancing on the small bench in Duane Park. In the DVD commentary, Danny DeVito says it was the only shot in the movie that the towers were in. No changes were made after the [[September 11th attacks|September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks]]. Filming production moved to Canada on spring 2001. The KidNet studios scenes were shot in several areas in [[Toronto]]. In the ice show scene with Smoochy and Rainbow, Robin's stuntdouble [[Elvis Stojko]] choreographed some of the skating moves for Rainbow Randolph. Robin was off stage. Filming ended in May 2001.\n\n== Home media ==\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on September 17, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Arnold|url=http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?sec_id=2&article_ID=3526|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020819023307/http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?sec_id=2&article_ID=3526|title=Warner Out for More Booty on Smoochy|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archive-date=August 19, 2002|date=August 1, 2002|access-date=September 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Death to Smoochy'' holds an approval rating of 42% based on 119 reviews with an average rating of 5.3/10.
