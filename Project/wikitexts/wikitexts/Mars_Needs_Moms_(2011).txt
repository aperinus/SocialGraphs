Based on the [[Berkeley Breathed]] book of the same title, the film is centered on Milo, a nine-year-old boy who, after having an outburst with his mother, finally comes to understand the needs of family, and has to save his mother after she is taken by Martians. It was co-written and directed by [[Simon Wells]]. The film stars both [[Seth Green]] ([[motion capture]]) and new-comer Seth Dusky (voice) as Milo. The voice cast also includes [[Dan Fogler]], [[Elisabeth Harnois]], [[Mindy Sterling]] and [[Joan Cusack]]. This was the second and last film by [[ImageMovers#Disney/ImageMovers Digital (2007\u20132011)|ImageMovers Digital]] before it was re-absorbed into [[ImageMovers]].<ref name=\"deadline\">{{cite news | first=Nikki | last=Finke | url=https://deadline.com/2010/03/disney-closing-zemeckis-digital-studio-in-2011-28214/ | title=Disney Closing Zemeckis' Digital Studio | website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=March 12, 2010 | access-date=June 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Mars Needs Moms'' was released in theaters on March 11, 2011, in the [[Disney Digital 3D]], [[RealD Cinema|RealD 3D]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] formats.<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Stewart | date=March 9, 2010 | title=Disney sets date for 'Mars' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118016278 | access-date=March 10, 2010 }}</ref> The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting, score, and set design but criticized its story, drama, and characters. Opinions of the motion capture animation were mixed. Some praised it for looking realistic and others criticized it for falling into the [[uncanny valley]] and looking [[Creepiness|creepy]]. It grossed $39 million worldwide on a $150 million budget, making it a [[box-office bomb]], with a loss of $100\u2013144 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400-700 words -->\nUnbeknownst to humans, there is a thriving, technologically sophisticated society of [[Martians]] living below the surface of Mars. The Martians' Supervisor, while observing Earth, sees a mother persuading her son, Milo, to do his chores. The Martians decide to bring her to Mars, where her \"mom-ness\" will be extracted and implanted into the next-generation of nanny-bots. Meanwhile, Milo, who doesn't like to follow house rules and do chores and has been sent to his room for feeding broccoli to his cat, Cujo, sarcastically tells his mother that his life would be better without her, which hurts her deeply.\n\nLater that night, Milo goes to apologize, but discovers his mom is taken away. He runs after her, but they end up in separate parts of the Martian spaceship. On Mars, Milo is taken to an underground prison cell. He escapes and is chased by the Supervisor's henchmen, but he follows a voice that tells him to jump down a chute, and lands in a lower subterranean level. There, he sees a trash-covered landscape that is inhabited by furry creatures.\n\nMilo is whisked away by the creatures to meet Gribble, also known as George Ribble, the childlike adult human who had told him to jump down the chute. Gribble explains to Milo that the Martians plan to extract Milo's mom's memories at sunrise, using a process that will kill her. Gribble, who is lonely and does not want Milo to leave, pretends to help Milo find his mother. His plan goes awry, leading to Gribble being captured and Milo being chased by the Supervisor's henchmen. Milo is rescued by Ki, one of the supervisors who raise Martian babies. Milo tells her about his search for his Mom and what a human relationship with a mom is like, as Ki and her kin were mentored by only nanny-bots and supervisors and do not know of love.\n\nMilo returns to Gribble's home but finds him missing. Gribble's robotic spider, Two-Cat, takes Milo to the Martian compound where Gribble is being prepared for execution. Milo is captured by his henchmen, but Ki tosses him a laser gun, allowing him to escape. Milo and Gribble retreat to an even lower uninhabited level, where Gribble describes his own mom's abduction and murder by the Martians 20 years ago. Gribble blames himself for her being chosen and regrets that he had not been able to save her. Milo convinces Gribble to actually help him just as Ki finds them. They discover an ancient mural of a Martian family and realize that Martian children were not always raised by machines. Gribble explains that Martian female babies are currently raised by nanny-bots in the technologically advanced society, while the male babies are sent down below to be raised by adult male Martians, which are the furry creatures he encountered earlier.\n\nMilo, Gribble, and Ki save Milo's mom just before sunrise, causing the energy of the extraction device to short out the electronic locks to the control room. This lets the adult males and babies enter, where they run amok, attacking the guards and robots. Milo and his mom steal oxygen helmets and try to escape across the Martian surface, but the Supervisor, while attempting to kill them, causes Milo to trip and his helmet shatters. His mom gives him her own helmet, saving Milo but causing herself to suffocate in the planet's air. The Martians are awed, as this is the first time they have seen love. Gribble finds his own mother's helmet and gives it to Milo's mom, saving her. Milo apologizes to his mom for his earlier words and the two reconcile. Ki brings a ship for them to escape in, but the Supervisor intervenes. Ki argues that Martians were meant to be raised in families, with love, but the Supervisor insists that the current situation is better because, to her, it is more efficient. The henchmen realizes the Supervisor's cruel nature and arrest her, deciding that they now prefer the loving vision of family life, and the other Martians celebrate.\n\nMilo, his mom, Gribble, Ki, and Two-Cat travel back to Earth. Gribble decides not to stay because he wants to pursue a relationship with Ki on Mars. Milo and his mom return home just before Milo's dad arrives.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Seth Green]] as Milo (motion capture), a 9-year-old boy who has a strained relationship with his mother\n** Seth Dusky as Milo (voice)\n* [[Dan Fogler]] as Gribble, a childish human living in Mars that Milo befriends\n* [[Elisabeth Harnois]] as Ki, an English language knowing martian who defects from the Supervisor and teams up with Milo and Gribble\n* [[Mindy Sterling]] as The Supervisor, the owner and the ruler of the Martians who seek to capture children's moms and extract their momness to nannybots\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Milo's mom\n* [[Kevin Cahoon]] as Wingnut, a male martian and one of Gribble's friends\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Two-Cat (voice), Gribble's bug-like robot assistant\n* [[Tom Everett Scott]] as Milo's dad\n* [[Raymond Ochoa|Raymond]], Robert, and [[Ryan Ochoa]] as Martian Hatchlings\n* Matthew Henerson, Adam Jennings, Stephen Kearin, Amber Gainey Meade, Aaron Rapke, Julene Renee, Kirsten Severson, and Matthew Wolf as Martians\n\n==Production==\nSimon Wells had known Zemeckis since the mid-1980s when he was supervising animator and [[storyboard artist]] for ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.
