The entire male cast reprised their roles from the previous installments, with [[Al Pacino]] and [[Ellen Barkin]] joining the cast, but [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] did not return.\n\nFilming began in July 2006 in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles]], based on a script by [[Brian Koppelman]] and [[David Levien]].<ref name=ComingSoon>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13812\n | title =  Ocean's 13 to Start on July 21\n| website = ComingSoon.net\n | date = March 27, 2006\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060330100303/http://comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=13812\n | archive-date = March 30, 2006\n}}</ref> The film was screened as an Out of Competition presentation at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4402485/year/2007.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Ocean's Thirteen |access-date=2009-12-20|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> and was released on June 8, 2007 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.themovieinsider.com/m3254/oceans-thirteen/\n | title =  Movie Insider: Ocean's Thirteen (2007)\n | access-date = July 14, 2006\n}}</ref> The film was well-received and grossed $311 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nReuben Tishkoff builds a hotel-casino on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]; against advice from his friend and erstwhile criminal partner, [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]], he involves himself with investor and casino mogul Willy Bank, whose thugs strongarm Reuben into signing over his ownership stake. Tishkoff suffers a [[heart attack]] and becomes bedridden. Ocean offers Bank a chance to set things right, given his long history in Las Vegas and the fact that he \"shook [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]]'s hand\", but Bank refuses and completes construction of the hotel, renamed \"The Bank\". To avenge Tishkoff, Ocean gathers his crew and plans to ruin Bank on the opening night of the hotel.\n\nThe crew develops a plan with two objectives:\n\n* Prevent The Bank from winning the prestigious Five Diamond Award, which all of Bank's previous hotels have won. Saul Bloom will stand in as the anonymous Diamond reviewer, while Ocean and his associates treat the real reviewer horribly.\n* Rig all of the casino's games to pay out millions in winnings; Bank's casino has to make $500 million in the first quarter in order to stay open, otherwise he would have to cede control of the casino to the [[Nevada Gaming Commission|gaming board]]. While they can implement various rigging mechanisms into the casino, Danny and his crew would be stopped by the Greco, a state-of-the-art computer system that monitors the gamblers' biometric responses and detects cheating.\n\nTo disrupt the Greco, they plan to use a [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]] disguised as a cell phone as a gift to Bank. They also obtain the [[Tunnel boring machine|drilling machine]] used to bore the [[Channel Tunnel]] to simulate an earthquake under the casino, ensuring that Bank will evacuate the premises. Their plan on opening night is to have Bank inadvertently disrupt the Greco by using his new phone, initiate their rigged machines as well as dealers on their payroll, and then simulate the earthquake to force the evacuation, and have players leave with their winnings.\n\nShortly before opening night, the drill breaks down. The team is forced to ask Terry Benedict, their [[Ocean's Eleven|previous target]], for funds to buy a replacement. Benedict offers the funds for a portion of his share of the take since he dislikes Bank, and demands that Ocean steal Bank's private diamond collection in celebration of his Five Diamond Awards. The jewels are secured in a case at the top of the casino. Ocean has Linus Caldwell get romantically close to Bank's assistant, Abigail Sponder, to gain access to the case. Secretly, Benedict contracts master thief [[Ocean's Twelve|Fran\u00e7ois \"The Night Fox\" Toulour]] to intercept the diamonds.\n\nOcean institutes the final part of the plan by having [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents on his payroll arrive at the hotel and arrest Livingston Dell on suspicion of rigging the card-shuffling machines, allowing them to be replaced with actual rigged ones. Another FBI agent arrests Linus for switching the diamonds with fakes. The agent takes Linus away and he turns out to be Linus' father Robert, whom Ocean enlisted. They try to evacuate from the roof but are intercepted by Toulour, who takes the diamonds and parachutes off the roof after tricking Linus with an unloaded pistol. However, Ocean anticipated this and never had Linus make the switch. Linus and his father escape in a helicopter piloted by Basher, tearing the case of diamonds from the roof.\n\nThe earthquake is triggered and the players evacuate with millions of dollars in winnings. Ocean tells Bank he is the mastermind behind everything and that they did it for Reuben. Ocean also reminds Bank that he cannot get revenge, since Danny knows all of Bank's associates and they prefer him over Bank. Also, Bank cannot go to the police due to Bank's illegal activities. With their share of the winnings, Ocean's crew buy property on the Strip for Reuben to build his own casino. Ocean donates Benedict's $72 million portion of the take to charity in Benedict's name, forcing him to admit his philanthropy on broadcast television.\n\nAs Ocean, Rusty, and Linus depart from the airport, Rusty rigs one of the slot machines to allow the real Diamond reviewer to win $11 million as compensation for how they treated him.\n\n== Cast ==\n===The Thirteen===\n* [[George Clooney]] as [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]], an ex-con that comes up with a new heist involving The Bank.\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Rusty Ryan (character)|Rusty Ryan]]\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Linus Caldwell|Linus Caldwell]]\n* [[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Terry Benedict|Terry Benedict]]\n* [[Don Cheadle]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Basher Tarr|Basher Tarr]]\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Frank Catton|Frank Catton]]\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Reuben Tishkoff|Reuben Tishkoff]], Danny's friend who plans to make a new casino until he gets swindled by Willy.\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#The Malloy Brothers|Virgil Malloy]]\n* [[Scott Caan]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#The Malloy Brothers|Turk Malloy]]\n* [[Eddie Jemison]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Livingston Dell|Livingston Dell]]\n* [[Shaobo Qin]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#The Amazing Yen|\"The Amazing\" Yen]]\n* [[Carl Reiner]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Saul Bloom|Saul Bloom]]\n* [[Eddie Izzard]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Roman Nagel|Roman Nagel]], a master thief and friend of Danny who is brought in as a consultant.\n\n===Others===\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Willy Bank|Willy Bank]], a casino mogul who swindles Reuben of his money to further his hotel called The Bank.\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Abigail Sponder|Abigail Sponder]], Willy's [[personal assistant]].\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Fran\u00e7ois Toulour|Fran\u00e7ois Toulour]], a master thief who Benedict hires to beat Danny to Bank's diamonds.\n* [[Bob Einstein]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Bobby Caldwell|Robert \"Bobby\" Caldwell]], a legendary con artist and the father of Linus that was mentioned a lot in the first two movies who poses as an FBI agent.\n* [[Olga Sosnovska]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Debbie|Debbie]], the [[concierge]] at The Bank.\n* [[David Paymer]] as the \"[[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#V.U.P.|V.U.P.]]\", a Five Diamond reviewer who falls victim to the shenanigans of Danny's group.\n* [[Angel Oquendo]] as Guard Ortega\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Greco Montgomery\n* [[Jerry Weintraub]] as [[List of Ocean's Trilogy characters#Denny Shields|Denny Shields]]\n\n== Production ==\nIn January 2006, it was reported that producers were in discussions about setting and shooting most of the film at the [[Wynn Las Vegas]].
