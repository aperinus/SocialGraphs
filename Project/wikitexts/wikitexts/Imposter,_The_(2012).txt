The film was directed by [[Bart Layton]]. It mainly includes interviews with Bourdin but also with members of Barclay's family, as well as archive television news footage and reenacted dramatic sequences.\n\n== Summary ==\n\nThe story begins in a phone box in Spain where Bourdin phones the police saying he is a tourist who has found a young boy in a phone box and the police should collect him. He is taken to a children's home and says he is American. He asks to be left in an office overnight to call his family. There he uses records in the office to contact various sheriff's offices in the USA asking about missing children. Through one lead he gets the name Nicholas Barclay. He then calls to another US agency claiming to be a Spanish official and asking to fax info on Nicholas. This is done and begins a task of Bourdin trying to look like Nicholas, including getting matching tattoos and dying his hair blond.\n\nNicholas's family is told of the discovery and the sister flies to Spain to collect him. A court decides it is Nicholas and he is declared a US citizen. She takes him back to [[San Antonio]] in Texas where most of the family accept him. The mother is especially keen to welcome him and recognize him as her son.\n\nBourdin, who turned out to have a long record of impersonating various children, real or imaginary, embellished his claim to be Nicholas Barclay by alleging that he had been kidnapped for purposes of sexual abuse by Mexican, European and U.S. military personnel and transported from the US to Spain. His impersonation fooled several officials in Spain and the U.S., and he was apparently accepted by many of Barclay's family members, even though he was seven years older than Barclay, spoke with a French accent, and had brown eyes and dark hair rather than Barclay's blue eyes and blonde hair. The impersonation was eventually discovered as a result of the suspicions of a private investigator, Charles (Charlie) Parker, and an FBI agent, Nancy Fisher. Bourdin was arrested and [[Interpol]] confirmed he was Bourdin, was 23 years old and had a long criminal record. In custody Bourdin tells the police that the family killed the real Nicholas and that is why they accepted him - as it hid the crime. The main suspect is his brother Jason who is already dead and so is a ready [[scapegoat]].\n\nLayton said of Bourdin: \"He invites sympathy. He has this childlike quality about him, and he can be very charming. And at other times he can be quite repellent, because he can be remorseless and you're reminded about what he did. So as a filmmaker, I was asking: how can I find a way of getting the audience to experience a bit of that?\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Hogan|first=Mike|date=13 July 2012 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/13/the-imposter-documentary_n_1669745.html |title='The Imposter': Documentary Reveals Stranger-Than-Fiction Story Of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin's Mind-Blowing Deceptions |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Credits ==\n;Interviews\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin]]\n* Carey Gibson\n* Beverly Dollarhide\n* Bryan Gibson\n* Codey Gibson\n* Nancy Fisher\n* Charlie Parker\n* Bruce Perry\n* Philip French\n\n;Drama sequences\n* [[Adam O'Brian]] as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin\n* Anna Ruben as Carey Gibson\n* Cathy Dresbach as Nancy Fisher\n* Alan Teichman as Charlie Parker\n* Ivan Villanueva as Social Worker\n* Maria Jesus Hoyos as Judge\n* Ant\u00f3n Mart\u00ed as Male Police Officer\n* Amparo Fontanet as Female Police Officer\n* Ken Appledorn as U.S. Embassy Official\n\n==Production==\nRAW Production produced the film with Red Box Films and Passion Pictures.
