His presidency faces enormous challenges in the [[History of South Africa (1994\u2013present)|post-Apartheid era]], including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and [[white South Africans]], which would lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black [[African National Congress|ANC]] additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust.\n\nWhile attending a game between the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]], the country's [[rugby union]] team, and [[England national rugby union team|England]], Mandela recognises that some black people in the stadium are cheering for England, and not their own country, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on [[Robben Island]]. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, [[Fran\u00e7ois Pienaar]] ([[Matt Damon]]), and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with Fran\u00e7ois a British poem, \"[[Invictus]]\", that had inspired him during his time in prison.\n\nFran\u00e7ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of [[Racism in South Africa|racial tensions]], as for many black people, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise [[Baasskap|white supremacy]]. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.\n\nThings begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks begins to grow among the black population. By the second game, the whole country comes together to support the Springboks and Mandela's efforts. Mandela's security team also grows closer as the racially diverse officers come to respect their comrades' professionalism and dedication.\n\nAs Mandela watches, the Springboks defeat one of their [[History of rugby union matches between Australia and South Africa|arch-rivals]]\u2014[[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], the defending champions and known as the Wallabies\u2014in their opening match. They then continue to defy all expectations and, as Mandela conducts trade negotiations in [[Taiwan]], defeat [[France national rugby union team|France]] in heavy rain to advance to [[1995 Rugby World Cup Final|the final]] against their other [[History of rugby union matches between New Zealand and South Africa|arch-rival]]: [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], known as the All Blacks. New Zealand and South Africa were universally regarded as the two greatest rugby nations, with the Springboks then the only side to have a winning record (20\u201319\u20132) against the All Blacks, since their first meeting in 1921.\n\nMeanwhile one day during the tournament, the Springbok team visited [[Robben Island]], where Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail. There, Pienaar is inspired by Mandela's will and his idea of self-mastery in \"Invictus\". Fran\u00e7ois mentions his amazement that Mandela \"could spend thirty years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put him there\".\n\nSupported by a large home crowd of all races at [[Ellis Park Stadium]] in [[Johannesburg]], Pienaar motivates his teammates for the final. Mandela's security detail receives a scare when, just before the match, a [[South African Airways]] [[Boeing 747-200]] jetliner flies in low over the stadium. However, it is not an assassination attempt, but a demonstration of [[patriotism]], with the message \"Good Luck, Bokke\"\u2014the Springboks' [[Afrikaans]] nickname\u2014painted on the undersides of the plane's wings. Mandela also famously arrives onto the field before the match wearing a Springbok cap and a replica of Pienaar's #6 jersey.\n\nThe Springboks complete their run by beating the All Blacks 15\u201312 in [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], thanks to a [[drop goal]] from [[Rugby union positions#Fly-half|fly-half]] [[Joel Stransky]]. Mandela and Pienaar meet on the field together to celebrate the improbable and unexpected victory, and Mandela hands Pienaar the [[Webb Ellis Cup|William Webb Ellis Cup]], as the Springboks are now indeed rugby union's world champions. Mandela's car then drives away in the traffic-jammed streets leaving the stadium. He insists that there is no hurry as his security team wanted to change the route due to the cheering crowd. As Mandela watches South Africans celebrating together in the street from his car, his voice is heard reciting \"Invictus\" again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as [[Nelson Mandela]], the head of the [[African National Congress]], who has become the first black [[President of South Africa]]\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Francois Pienaar]], the Springboks' captain and [[Flanker (rugby union)|openside flanker]]\n* [[Tony Kgoroge]] as Jason Tshabalala\n* [[Adjoa Andoh]] as Brenda Mazibuko\n* [[Julian Lewis Jones]] as Etienne Feyder<ref>Turner, Rob (March 22, 2009).

My wife, [[Chaz Ebert|Chaz]], and I were taken to the island early one morning by Ahmed Kathrada, one of Mandela's fellow prisoners, and yes, the movie shows his very cell, with the thin blankets on the floor.
