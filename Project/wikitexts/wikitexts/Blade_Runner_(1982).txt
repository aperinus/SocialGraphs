Dick]]'s 1968 novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' The film is set in a [[dystopia]]n future [[Los Angeles]] of 2019, in which [[android (robot)|synthetic humans]] known as ''[[replicant]]s'' are [[bio-engineered]] by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on [[space colonization|space colonies]]. When a fugitive group of advanced replicants led by [[Roy Batty]] (Hauer) escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop [[Rick Deckard]] (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.\n\n''Blade Runner'' initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others critiqued its slow pacing and lack of action. It later became a [[cult film]], and has since come to be regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|all-time best science fiction films]]. Hailed for its production design depicting a high-tech but decaying future, ''Blade Runner'' is often regarded as both a leading example of [[neo-noir]] cinema as well as a foundational work of the [[cyberpunk]] genre. The [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]], composed by [[Vangelis]], was nominated in 1982 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and a [[Golden Globe]] as best original [[film score|score]].\n\nThe film has influenced many science fiction films, [[Blade_Runner_(franchise)#Video_games|video game]]s, [[anime]], and television series. It brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood, and [[List of adaptations of works by Philip K. Dick|several of his works]] later became films such as ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (2002), and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (2006). In 1993, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nSeven different [[versions of Blade Runner|versions of ''Blade Runner'']] exist as a result of controversial changes requested by studio executives. A [[director's cut]] was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a [[workprint]]. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the earliest movies to be released on [[DVD]]. In 2007, [[Warner Bros.]]&nbsp;released ''[[Versions of Blade Runner#The Final Cut (2007)|The Final Cut]]'', a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version. This is the only version over which Scott retained artistic control.\n\nThe film is the first of [[Blade Runner (franchise)|the franchise of the same name]]. A sequel, directed by [[Denis Villeneuve]] and titled ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'', was released in October 2017 alongside a trilogy of short films covering the thirty-year span between the two films' settings. The anime series ''[[Blade Runner: Black Lotus]]'' was released in 2021.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Hatnote|Note: Since there are several versions of ''Blade Runner'', this summary excludes version-specific events.

Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\n\nIn 2019 Los Angeles, former police officer [[Rick Deckard]] is detained by Officer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Gaff|Gaff]], who likes to make [[origami]] figures, and is brought to his former supervisor, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Harry Bryant|Bryant]]. Deckard, whose job as a \"blade runner\" was to track down bioengineered humanoids known as [[replicant]]s and terminally \"retire\" them, is informed that four replicants are on Earth illegally. Deckard begins to leave, but Bryant ambiguously threatens him and Deckard stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dave Holden|Holden]] administering the Voight-Kampff test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional responses to questions. The test subject, [[Leon Kowalski|Leon]], shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and three other Nexus-6 replicants: [[List of Blade Runner characters#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], [[Characters in Blade Runner#Zhora Salome|Zhora]], and [[List of Blade Runner characters#Pris Stratton|Pris]].\n\nBryant has Deckard meet with the CEO of the company that creates the replicants, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Eldon Tyrell]], so he can administer the test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]]. After a much longer than standard test, Deckard concludes privately to Tyrell that Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains that she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an \"emotional cushion,\" and that she has no knowledge of her true nature.\n\nIn searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a scale from the skin of an animal, which is later identified as a synthetic snake scale. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of [[List of Blade Runner characters#J.F. Sebastian|J. F. Sebastian]], a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Deckard returns to his apartment where Rachael is waiting. She tries to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, and she leaves in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.\n\nA photograph from Leon's apartment and the snake scale lead Deckard to a strip club, where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant also orders him to retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is ambushed by Leon, who knocks the gun out of Deckard's hand and beats him. As Leon is about to kill Deckard, Rachael saves him by using Deckard's gun to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment and, during a discussion, he promises not to track her down. As Rachael abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her and forces her to kiss him, and she ultimately relents.\n\nDeckard leaves Rachael at his apartment and departs to search for the remaining replicants. Roy arrives at Sebastian's apartment and tells Pris that the other replicants are dead. Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic [[premature aging]] disorder, his life will be cut short, like the replicants that were built with a four-year lifespan. Roy uses Sebastian to gain entrance to Tyrell's penthouse. He demands more life from his maker, which Tyrell says is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done \"questionable things\" but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell and then kills him by gouging out his eyes. Sebastian tries to flee and is later reported dead.{{#tag:ref|Sebastian's death was never shot because of concerns over too much violence in the film.{{sfn|Sammon|p=175}}|group=nb}}\n\nAt Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he kills her as Roy returns. Roy's body begins to fail as the end of his lifespan nears. He chases Deckard through the building and onto the roof. Deckard tries to jump onto another roof but is left hanging on the edge. Roy makes the jump with ease and, as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof to save him. Before Roy dies, he laments that his memories \"[[Tears in rain monologue|will be lost in time, like tears in rain]]\". Gaff arrives and compliments Deckard, also reminding him that Rachael will not live. Deckard returns to his apartment to retrieve Rachael. While escorting her to the elevator, he notices a small origami [[unicorn]] on the floor. He recalls Gaff's words, but leaves with Rachael anyway.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as [[Rick Deckard]]\n*[[Rutger Hauer]] as Roy Batty\n*[[Sean Young]] as Rachael\n*[[Edward James Olmos]] as Gaff\n*[[M.

And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?{{' \"}}<ref>Dick quoted in {{harvnb|Sammon|p=23}}</ref>\n\nThe screenplay by [[Hampton Fancher]]<!-- Not titled \"Android\" initially&nbsp;\u2013 See Sammon, pp. 32 and 38 for explanation --> was optioned in 1977.{{sfn|Sammon|p=23\u201330}} Producer [[Michael Deeley]] became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'', wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death.{{sfn|Sammon|p=43\u201349}} He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised [[Filmways]] financing from US$13&nbsp;million to $15&nbsp;million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel, and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by [[William S. Burroughs]] for [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s novel ''[[The Bladerunner]]'' (1974), titled ''[[Blade Runner (a movie)]]''.{{refn|Some editions of Nourse's novel use the two-word spacing ''Blade Runner'', as does the Burroughs book.|group=nb}} Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles.<ref>Abraham Riesman,\n[https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/why-is-blade-runner-the-title-of-blade-runner.html \"Digging Into the Odd History of Blade Runner's Title\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010170059/http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/why-is-blade-runner-the-title-of-blade-runner.html |date=October 10, 2017 }}, Vulture, October 4, 2017.

In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5&nbsp;million in financing through a three-way deal between [[the Ladd Company]] (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer [[Run Run Shaw|Sir Run Run Shaw]] and [[Tandem Productions]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Bukatman|1p=18\u201319|2a1=Sammon|2p=64\u201367}}\n\nDick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood.{{sfn|Sammon|p=63\u201364}} After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles ''Select TV Guide'', the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite.{{sfn|Sammon|p=67\u201369}} Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it.{{sfn|Sammon|p=284}} He said, \"I saw a segment of [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s special effects for ''Blade Runner'' on the [[KNBC]] news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world.

The Voight-Kampff is a [[polygraph]]-like machine used by blade runners to determine whether an individual is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement in response to questions dealing with empathy.{{sfn|Sammon|p=106\u2013107}} (Tyrell states: \"Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?

Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes six or seven questions to make a determination.

There are two official releases of the music from ''Blade Runner''. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the [[New American Orchestra]] recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation ''Vangelis: Themes'', but not until the 1992 release of the ''Director's Cut'' version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.{{sfn|Sammon|p=419\u2013423}}\n\nThese delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many [[bootleg recording]]s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 \"Off World Music, Ltd\" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.{{sfn|Sammon|p=419\u2013423}} A set with three CDs of ''Blade Runner''-related Vangelis music was released in 2007.

This tension between past, present, and future is represented in the \"retrofitted\" future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as \"extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel\". He also said that he \"liked the idea of exploring pain\" in the wake of his brother's death: \"When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.\"<ref name=\"scottobserver\">{{citation |last=Barber |first=Lynn |title=Scott's Corner |date=January 6, 2002 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,628186,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054223/http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0%2C%2C628186%2C00.html |url-status=dead |work=[[The Observer]] |location=London |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-date=July 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\nA sense of foreboding and paranoia pervades the world of the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored&nbsp;\u2013\nespecially regarding replicants' implanted memories. Control over the environment is exercised on a vast scale, and goes hand in hand with the absence of any natural life; for example, artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors.
