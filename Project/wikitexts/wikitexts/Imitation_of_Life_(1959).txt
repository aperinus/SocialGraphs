It was Sirk's final Hollywood film and dealt with issues of race, class and gender. ''Imitation of Life'' is the second film adaptation of [[Fannie Hurst]]'s 1933 [[Imitation of Life (novel)|novel of the same name]]; [[Imitation of Life (1934 film)|the first]], directed by [[John M. Stahl]], was released in 1934.\n\nThe film's top-billed stars are [[Lana Turner]] and [[John Gavin]], and the cast also features [[Sandra Dee]], [[Dan O'Herlihy]], [[Susan Kohner]], [[Robert Alda]] and [[Juanita Moore]]. Kohner and Moore received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for their performances. [[Gospel music]] star [[Mahalia Jackson]] appears as a church choir soloist.\n\nIn 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected ''Imitation of Life'' for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" The original 1934 version of ''Imitation of Life'' was added to the National Film Registry in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ghostbusters-top-gun-enter-national-849092|title='Ghostbusters,' 'Top Gun,' 'Shawshank' Enter National Film Registry|author=Mike Barnes|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 16, 2015|access-date=December 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Imitation of Life 1959 film still.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right: Sarah Jane (Karin Dicker), Annie ([[Juanita Moore]]), Susie (Terry Burnham) and Lora ([[Lana Turner]]) in an early scene of the film.]]\nIn 1947, single mother Lora Meredith dreams of becoming a famous Broadway actress. Losing track of her young daughter Susie at a crowded Coney Island beach, she asks a stranger, Steve Archer, to help her find the girl. Meanwhile, Susie has been found and looked after by Annie Johnson, who is also a single mother with a daughter, Sarah Jane, who is about Susie's age. With the help of Steve and a police officer, Lora is reunited with Susie. The Merediths are white and the Johnsons are black, but Lora initially assumes Sarah Jane is white and not Annie's daughter. Sarah Jane's fair skin allows her to [[Passing (racial identity)|pass]] as white and she fervently rejects being identified as black.\n\nIn return for Annie's kindness, Lora temporarily takes in Annie and her daughter. Annie persuades Lora to let her stay and look after the household so that she can pursue an acting career. Lora becomes a star of stage comedies, with Allen Loomis as her agent and David Edwards as her chief playwright (and lover). Although Lora had begun a relationship with Steve, their courtship falls apart because he does not want her to be a star. Lora's concentration on her career prevents her from spending time with Susie, who sees more of Annie. Annie and Sarah Jane have their own problems, as Sarah Jane is struggling with her identity.\n\nEleven years later, Lora is a highly regarded Broadway star living in a luxurious home near New York City. Annie continues to live with her, serving as nanny, housekeeper, confidante, and best friend. After rejecting David's latest script (and his marriage proposal), Lora takes a role in a dramatic play. At the show's after-party, she encounters Steve, whom she has not seen in a decade. The two slowly begin rekindling their relationship, and Steve is reintroduced to Annie, and the now-teenaged Susie and Sarah Jane. When Lora is signed to star in an Italian movie she leaves Steve to watch after Susie. The teenager develops an unrequited crush on her mother's boyfriend.\n\n[[File:Susan Kohner and Juanita Moore.jpeg|thumb|Sarah Jane ([[Susan Kohner]]) and Annie.]]\nSarah Jane begins dating a white teenager, but he beats her in an alleyway after learning she is black. Some time later, she again passes for white to get a job performing at a seedy nightclub, but tells her mother she is working at the library. When Annie learns the truth, she goes to the club to claim her daughter; Sarah Jane is subsequently fired. Sarah Jane's rejection of her mother takes a physical and mental toll on Annie. When Lora returns from Italy, Sarah Jane has run away from home, leaving Annie a note that says if she truly does care about her, she will leave her alone and let her live her life.\n\nLora asks Steve to hire a private detective to find Sarah Jane. The detective finds her living and working in California as a white woman under an assumed name. Annie, becoming weaker and more depressed by the day, flies out to see her daughter one last time and say goodbye. Upon meeting with Sarah Jane, Annie apologizes for being selfish by loving her too much and wishes her the best. Annie pleads to Sarah Jane that if she ever needs help, she will reach out to her, and the two share an embrace. Sarah Jane's roommate interrupts them and presumes Annie is a maid. Annie tells the roommate that she is a former nanny of \"Miss Linda,\" Sarah Jane's new name.\n\nAnnie is bedridden upon her return to New York and Lora and Susie look after her. The issue of Susie's crush on Steve becomes serious when Susie learns that Steve and Lora are to be married. Annie tells Lora of the girl's crush. After a confrontation with her mother, Susie decides to go away to school in Denver to forget about Steve. Soon after their argument, Annie dies with Lora crying hysterically by her side. As she wished, Annie is given a lavish funeral in a large church, complete with a gospel choir, followed by an elaborate traditional funeral procession with a band and four white horses drawing the hearse. Just before the procession sets off, a bereaved and guilt-ridden Sarah Jane pushes through the crowd of mourners to throw herself upon her mother's casket apologizing and begging for her mother's forgiveness, proclaiming \"I killed my own mother!\" Lora takes Sarah Jane to their limousine to join her, Susie, and Steve as the procession slowly travels through a city street. A large African American crowd silently watch.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Lana Turner]] as Lora Meredith\n* [[John Gavin]] as Steve Archer\n* [[Sandra Dee]] as Susie, age 16\n* [[Susan Kohner]] as Sarah Jane, age 18 (singing voice dubbed by [[Jo Ann Greer]])\n* [[Robert Alda]] as Allen Loomis\n* [[Dan O'Herlihy]] as David Edwards \n* Karin Dicker as Sarah Jane, age 8\n* [[Terry Burnham]] as Susie, age 6\n* [[Sandra Gould]] as Annette\n* [[Juanita Moore]] as Annie Johnson\n* [[Mahalia Jackson]] as choir soloist\n* [[Than Wyenn]] as Romano\n* [[Ann Robinson]] as Showgirl\n* [[Troy Donahue]] as Frankie\n* [[Jack Weston]] as Tom\n}}\n\n==History and production==\nThe plot of the 1959 version of ''Imitation of Life'' has numerous major changes from those of the original book and the 1934 film version.<ref name=Hirop94>{{cite journal|author=Hiro, Molly|title='Tain't no tragedy unless you make it one': ''Imitation of Life'', Melodrama, and the Mulatta |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/406967/summary|journal=Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|volume=66|issue=4|date=Winter 2010|pages=94}}</ref> In the original story, the \"Lora\" character, Bea Pullman, became successful by commercial production of her maid Delilah's family waffle recipe (a pancake recipe in the 1934 film version). As a result, Bea, the white businesswoman, becomes rich. Delilah is offered 20% of the profits, but declines and chooses to remain Bea's dutiful assistant. Like the previous film, in this one the Peola (Sarah Jane) character returns, going to her mother's funeral and showing remorse, a scene described by Molly Hiro as \"virtually identical\" to the previous one, while in the novel she leaves the area for good.<ref name=Hirop94/>\n\nDirector Douglas Sirk and screenwriters Eleanore Griffin and [[Allan Scott (American screenwriter)|Allan Scott]] felt that such a story would not be accepted during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] amid milestones, such as the ''[[Brown v.

It has been considered a masterpiece of Sirk's American career. [[Emanuel Levy]] has written \"One of the four masterpieces directed in the 1950s, the visually lush, meticulously designed and powerfully acted ''Imitation of Life'' was the jewel in Sirk's crown, ending his Hollywood's career before he returned to his native Germany.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Levy |first=Emanuel |title=Imitation of Life (1959) |date=August 15, 2009 |url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/review/imitation-of-life-1959-6/}}</ref> Sirk provided the Annie\u2013Sarah Jane relationship in his version with more screen time and more intensity than the original versions of the story. Critics later commented that Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner stole the film from Turner.<ref name = \"Handzo\"/> Sirk said that he had deliberately and subversively undercut Turner to draw focus toward the problems of the two black characters.\n\nSirk's treatment of racial and class issues is also admired for what he caught of the times. Writing in 1997, Rob Nelson said,\n\n<blockquote>Basically, we're left to intuit that the black characters (and the movie) are themselves products of '50s-era racism&nbsp;\u2013 which explains the film's perspective, but hardly makes it less dizzying.
