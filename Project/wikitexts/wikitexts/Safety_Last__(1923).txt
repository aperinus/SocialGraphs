It includes one of the most famous images from the [[silent film|silent-film]] era: Lloyd clutching the hands of a large clock as he dangles from the outside of a skyscraper above moving traffic. The film was highly successful and critically hailed, and it cemented Lloyd's status as a major figure in early motion pictures. It is still popular at revivals, and it is viewed today as one of the great film comedies.<ref>Ebert, Roger.

June 21, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe film's title is a play on the common expression \"safety first\", which prioritizes safety as a means to avoid accidents, especially in workplaces. Lloyd performed some of the climbing stunts himself, despite having lost a thumb and forefinger four years earlier in a [[film accident]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/safety_last.pdf|title=Safety Last|last=Bann|first=Richard W.|website=Library Of Congress}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, ''Safety Last!'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It is one of many works from 1923 that notably entered the [[public domain in the United States]] in 2019, the first time any works have done so in 20 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lifehacker.com/these-1923-copyrighted-works-enter-the-public-domain-in-1825241296 |title=These 1923 Copyrighted Works Enter the Public Domain in 2019 |author=Douglas, Nick |website=Life Hacker |date=April 13, 2018 |access-date=September 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in 1922, with Harold Lloyd (the character has the same name as the actor) behind bars. His mother and his girlfriend, Mildred, are consoling him as a somber official and priest show up. The three of them walk toward what looks like a [[noose]]. It then becomes obvious they are at a train station and the \"noose\" is actually a [[Mail hook|trackside pickup hoop]] used by train crews to receive orders without stopping, and the bars are merely the ticket barrier. He promises to send for his girlfriend so they can get married once he has \"made good\" in the big city. Then he is off.\n\nHe gets a job as a salesclerk at the De Vore Department Store, where he has to pull various stunts to get out of trouble with the picky and arrogantly self-important head [[floorwalker]], Mr. Stubbs. He shares a rented room with his pal \"Limpy\" Bill, a construction worker.\n\nWhen Harold finishes his shift, he sees an old friend from his hometown who is now a policeman walking the beat. After he leaves, Bill shows up. Bragging to Bill about his supposed influence with the police department, he persuades Bill to knock the policeman backwards over him while the man is using a [[callbox]]. When Bill does so, he knocks over the wrong policeman. To escape, he climbs up the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of a building. The policeman tries to follow, but cannot get past the first floor; in frustration, he shouts at Bill, \"You'll do time for this! The first time I lay eyes on you again, I'll [[arrest|pinch]] you!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harold has been hiding his lack of success by sending his girlfriend expensive presents he cannot really afford. She mistakenly thinks he is successful enough to support a family and, with his mother's encouragement, takes a train to join him. In his embarrassment, he has to pretend to be the general manager, even succeeding in impersonating him to get back at Stubbs. While going to retrieve her purse (which Mildred left in the manager's office), he overhears the real general manager say he would give $1,000 to anyone who could attract people to the store. He remembers Bill's talent and pitches the idea of having a man climb the \"[[International Savings & Exchange Bank Building|12-story Bolton building]]\", which De Vore's occupies. He gets Bill to agree to do it by offering him $500. The stunt is highly publicized and a large crowd gathers the next day.\n\nWhen a drunkard shows \"The Law\" (the policeman who was pushed over) a newspaper story about the event, the lawman suspects Bill is going to be the climber. He waits at the starting point despite Harold's frantic efforts to get him to leave. Finally, unable to wait any longer, Bill suggests Harold climb the first story himself and then switch his hat and coat with Bill, who will continue on from there. After Harold starts up, the policeman spots Bill and chases him into the building. Every time Harold tries to switch places with Bill, the policeman appears and chases Bill away. Each time, Bill tells his friend he will meet him on the next floor up. Eventually, Harold reaches the top, despite his troubles with a clock and some hungry pigeons, and kisses his girl.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harold Lloyd]] as The Boy\n* [[Mildred Davis]] as The Girl\n* Bill Strother as The Pal, \"Limpy\" Bill\n* [[Noah Young]] as The Law\n* Westcott Clarke as Mr. Stubbs, The Floorwalker \n* [[Earl Mohan]] as The Drunk ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Mickey Daniels]] as The Kid ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Anna Townsend]] as The Grandma ''(uncredited)''\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Safetylast-1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The iconic shot of Lloyd hanging from the clock]]\nLloyd hanging from a giant clock on the corner of a building was seen as an iconic image for him, though it was achieved through a certain degree of improvisation.<ref name=\"westerncostumeresearch\">{{cite web |title=Filming Safety Last (1923) |url=http://www.westerncostumeresearch.com/western-costume-research-blog/filming-safety-last-1923/ |website=Western Costume Research Library |access-date=12 January 2022 |language=en |date=21 August 2015 |quote=One of the most iconic scenes in silent cinema was filmed on the roof of Western Costume Company.}}</ref><ref name=\"silentlocations-safety-last\">{{cite web |last1=Bengtson |first1=John |title=How Harold Lloyd Filmed Safety Last! |url=https://silentlocations.com/2012/02/29/how-harold-lloyd-filmed-safety-last/ |website=silent locations |access-date=12 January 2022 |language=en |date=29 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The thrilling Harold Lloyd |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/the-thrilling-harold-lloyd/ |website=cbsnews.com |access-date=12 January 2022 |date=March 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Harold Lloyd Safety Last! |url=https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/harold-lloyd-safety-last |website=Getty Images |access-date=12 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Harold Lloyd Safety Last! |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/harold-lloyd-safety-last!.html |website=Alamy |access-date=12 January 2022}}</ref> Lloyd performed most of his own stuntwork, but a circus performer was used when The Boy hangs by a rope, and a stunt double &ndash; sometimes Bill Strother, who played \"Limpy\" Bill<ref name=\"iu.edu-Allison-Safety\">{{cite web |last1=Allison |first1=Caleb |title=Safety Last! and the Spectacle of the Human Fly |url=https://blogs.iu.edu/aplaceforfilm/2019/02/25/safety-last-and-the-spectacle-of-the-human-fly/ |website=[[Indiana University]] Cinema |date=25 February 2019}}</ref> and was a [[steeplejack]] who inspired the sequence when Lloyd saw him climbing &ndash; was used in long shots.
