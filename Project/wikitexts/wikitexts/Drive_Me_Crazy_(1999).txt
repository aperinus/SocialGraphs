During their senior year, Nicole devotes much of her time and energy into planning their high school's centennial dance, which she expects to go to with a basketball player named Brad but he falls in love with a cheerleader from a rival school and asks her to the dance instead of Nicole.  Chase is dating Dulcie, though she ultimately leaves him for a socially conscious college student.  One night, Nicole calls Chase and asks him to the dance, suggesting that they pretend to date to make Brad and Dulcie jealous, he agrees to her scheme and they both agree to have an easy out clause in the relationship, so it can end at any time with no hard feelings.\n\nNicole gives Chase a makeover so that he fits in better with her friend group and takes him to events where he becomes friends with the popular kids, all while insisting to his old friends, Dave and Ray, that the whole thing is just a scam and that he hasn't really changed, though it's clear to them that he has.  While Chase does all the activities Nicole asks him to with little resistance, he eventually points out that everything they've done is for her benefit.  Nicole agrees to do whatever he wants and they go to a club he used to frequent with Dulcie, where Nicole has a good time and begins bonding with his friends. Chase has a run in with Dulcie and her new boyfriend, Nicole comes to his aid and kisses him, which makes Dulcie jealous. Nicole and Chase begin to fall in love but don't admit their feelings, to each other or themselves, and continue their ruse.  Nicole's vindictive best friend, Alicia, seduces Chase at a party, making sure Nicole would see them together, leaving Nicole heartbroken. Chase calls Dave to pick him up, since he is too drunk to drive, and angers Dave when he says that \"everyone\" was at the party, which Dave says is not true because he and Ray were not there, reminding him they used to be his friends.  Meanwhile, Brad and his girlfriend break up and Dulcie also ends things with her new boyfriend.  Chase attempts to talk to Nicole about what happened with Alicia but she rebuffs him, reminding him of the easy out clause, she also ignores his calls. Chase eventually makes up with his friends and gets back together with Dulcie.  Brad finally asks Nicole to the dance.  Despite getting what they both wanted from the beginning, Chase is unhappy with Dulcie and Nicole rejects Brad.\n\nThe night of the dance, with no date, Nicole calls Ray, who had offered to take her earlier, and goes to the dance with him.  While Chase is out with Dulcie, she realizes he doesn't want to be there, or be with her.  Ray and Nicole have fun together at the dance, but he leaves when Chase arrives, knowing that despite their claims that their relationship was never real, Chase is the one she wants to be with.  Chase asks Nicole to dance, she asks who they're trying to make jealous now, he tells her everyone.\n\nIn the final scene, Chase and Nicole come home early the next morning and Nicole walks Chase to his door, they kiss then find her mother with his father.  Their parents tell them that they're also in a relationship and are going to move in together. Nicole suggests she and Chase discuss the new living arrangements in the treehouse they used to play in as children.  They hold hands as they walk into Nicole's backyard, then hug and kiss under the treehouse.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Melissa Joan Hart]] as Nicole Maris\n* [[Adrian Grenier]] as Chase Hammond\n* [[Stephen Collins (actor)|Stephen Collins]] as Mr. Maris\n* [[Susan May Pratt]] as Alicia\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Dave\n* Kris Park as Ray Neeley\n* Gabriel Carpenter as Brad Seldon\n* [[Ali Larter]] as Dulcie\n* [[Lourdes Benedicto]] as Chloe Frost\n* [[Keri Lynn Pratt]] as Dee Vine\n* Natasha Pearce as Sue\n* [[Jordan Bridges]] as Eddie Lampell\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Rupert\n* [[Mark Metcalf]] as Mr. Rope\n* [[William Converse-Roberts]] as Mr. Hammond\n* [[Faye Grant]] as Mrs. Maris\n}}\n\n==Filming locations==\n''Drive Me Crazy'' was filmed in and around [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], including  [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]] and [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]].
