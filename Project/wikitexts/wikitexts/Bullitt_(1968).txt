The next morning [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] detective Lieutenant Frank Bullitt and his team, Delgetti and Stanton, are tasked by Walter Chalmers with [[protective custody|guarding]] Ross over the weekend, until he can be presented as a witness to a [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[subcommittee]] hearing on [[organized crime]] on Monday morning. The detectives are told he is in a cheap hotel on [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]. Delgetti will take the first shift, then Stanton and then Bullitt. At 1am Sunday, while Stanton is phoning Bullitt to say Chalmers and a friend want to come up, Ross unchains the room door. Two [[Contract killing|hitmen]] burst in shooting Stanton in the leg and Ross in the neck.\n\nChalmers holds Bullitt responsible for the injuries to Ross. Bullitt thwarts a second assassination attempt at the hospital, but Ross dies from his wounds. Bullitt sends the body to the morgue as a [[John Doe]] in order to conceal the death and keep his investigation open. An informant says that Ross was in town because he stole millions of dollars from the mob. Bullitt also finds out he made a long distance phone call to a hotel in [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]].\n\nWhile driving his [[Ford Mustang (first generation)#1967\u20131968|Ford Mustang]], Bullitt becomes aware he is being followed by a [[Dodge Charger (B-body)#Second generation|Dodge Charger]] driven by the two hitmen. An extended chase ensues through the streets of San Francisco and on to [[Brisbane, California|Brisbane]], where the Dodge crashes off the road, killing its occupants in a fiery explosion.\n\nBullitt and Delgetti are confronted by their boss, Captain Sam Bennett, and Chalmers (who is being assisted by SFPD Captain Baker). After being served a writ of [[habeas corpus]], Bullitt reveals that Ross has died. Bennett ignores the writ because it's the weekend, and lets Bullitt investigate the long distance phone call to San Mateo. With no car, Bullitt gets a ride from his girlfriend Cathy. At the hotel, Bullitt finds a woman garrotted in her room. Cathy, who has followed him, is left horrified by the scene. On the way back to San Francisco she confronts Bullitt about his work saying \"Frank, you live in a sewer\" and wonders \"What will happen to us?\"\n\nWhile examining the victim's luggage, Bullitt and Delgetti discover a travel brochure for [[Rome]] and [[traveler's check]]s made out to an Albert and Dorothy Renick. Bullitt requests their passport applications from Chicago. Bullitt, Captain Bennett, Chalmers and Captain Baker gather around the [[Fax|telecopier]] as the applications arrive. It turns out Chalmers sent Bullitt to guard an Albert Renick, a used car salesman from Chicago, while his wife Dorothy was staying in San Mateo. Bullitt realizes that Ross was playing Chalmers by using Renick as a [[Doppelg\u00e4nger|double]] to escape the country Sunday night.\n\nAt [[San Francisco International Airport]], Delgetti and Bullitt watch the Rome gate. However, Ross (now using Renick's passport) has switched to an earlier London flight. Bullitt boards the plane after it is ordered to return to the terminal but the mobster escapes through the rear cabin door and runs across the runway. In the crowded passenger terminal, Ross kills a deputy sheriff before being shot dead by Bullitt. Chalmers arrives to view the scene but leaves saying nothing.\n\nEarly Monday morning, Bullitt comes home to find Cathy asleep in his bed having chosen to stay.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- in opening credits order --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as Lt.

Pictures]], with [[Josh Singer]] writing the screenplay; the film will not be a remake, but instead an original story centred on the character, and will be executive produced by McQueen's son, [[Chad McQueen|Chad]], and granddaughter Molly McQueen.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 25, 2022|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Steven Spielberg Developing New Movie Based On Classic Steve McQueen Character Frank Bullitt|url=https://deadline.com/2022/02/steven-spielbert-bullitt-at-warner-bros-and-amblin-1234960542/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 28, 2022|archive-date=February 27, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220227163824/https://deadline.com/2022/02/steven-spielbert-bullitt-at-warner-bros-and-amblin-1234960542/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Mustangs ====\n[[File:Bullitt Mustang.jpg|thumb|Bullitt Mustang '559 on display at the LeMay Car Museum in Tacoma, Washington, 2019]]\nWarner Bros. ordered two identical 1968 Mustangs for filming. Both were painted Highland Green and had the GT package with 390 CID engines. These cars had the sequential vehicle identification numbers 8R02S125558 and 8R02S125559. Prior to filming, the cars were modified by Max Balchowsky. Car '558 was used for the harsher driving (including the skid at the end of the chase), while '559 was used for lighter driving.\n\nAfter the filming was complete, '559 was sold to Robert Ross,<ref name=\"machines\">{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Matt|title=McQueen's Machines: The Cars and Bikes of a Hollywood Icon|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7603-38957|location=Minneapolis, MN|page=90|quote=One of the Mustangs was so badly damaged during filming it was judged unrepairable and scrapped.

On January 10, 2020, the car was sold by Mecum Auctions for $3.7 million to an unidentified buyer.<ref name=\"cnn2020\" /> The sale made it the most expensive Ford in the world.\n\nCar '558 had been damaged severely during filming and was subsequently sent to a scrapyard. In the ensuing decades,  the car was assumed to be lost. In 2016, though,  Hugo Sanchez purchased a pair of Mustang coup\u00e9s from the backyard of a house near [[Los Cabos Municipality|Los Cabos]], Mexico. He then sent the cars to Ralph Garcia to start work on turning one into an \"Eleanor\" clone. Realizing one of the two Mustangs was an S-code, Garcia had the car authenticated by Kevin Marti. The authentication revealed this to be the lost Bullitt car. Sanchez and Garcia are now in the process of giving the car a full restoration.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gastelu|first=Gary|date=March 6, 2017|title=Ford Mustang found in Mexican junkyard is from 'Bullitt,' expert confirms|publisher=[[Fox News]]|url=https://www.foxnews.com/auto/ford-mustang-found-in-mexican-junkyard-is-from-bullitt-expert-confirms|access-date=March 7, 2017|archive-date=October 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002040742/https://www.foxnews.com/auto/ford-mustang-found-in-mexican-junkyard-is-from-bullitt-expert-confirms|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1968]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Eagan |first=Daniel |title=America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry |url=https://archive.org/details/americasfilmlega0000eaga |url-access=registration |quote=Bullitt was based on the 1963 novel, Mute Witness, by Robert L.
