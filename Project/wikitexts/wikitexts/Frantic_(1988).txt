(1992). ''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style'' (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Roman Polanski]] and starring [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Emmanuelle Seigner]]. The film score is by [[Ennio Morricone]].\n\n== Plot ==\nDr. Richard Walker ([[Harrison Ford]]) is a surgeon visiting [[Paris]] with his wife Sondra ([[Betty Buckley]]) for a medical conference. At their hotel, she is unable to unlock her suitcase, and Walker determines that she picked up the wrong one at the airport. While Walker is taking a shower, Sondra receives a phone call that Walker can't hear and she mysteriously disappears from their hotel room.\n\nStill [[jet-lag]]ged, Walker searches for his wife in the hotel with the help of a polite but mostly indifferent staff and then wanders outside to look for her himself. A wino overhears him in a caf\u00e9 and says he saw Sondra being forced into a car in a nearby alley. Walker is skeptical, until he finds his wife's ID bracelet on the cobblestones. He contacts the Paris police and the U.S. [[Embassy]], but their responses are [[bureaucratic]], and there is little hope anyone will bother looking for her.  As Walker carries on the search himself he stumbles onto a murder site where he encounters the streetwise young Michelle, who mistook Sondra's suitcase for her own at the airport. He realises that Michelle is a career drug smuggler, but does not care or know for which shady dealers she is hired.  Michelle reluctantly helps Walker in his  attempt to learn what was packed in her switched suitcase, and how to trade the contents for the return of his kidnapped wife.\n\nFollowing their visit to Michelle's apartment, Walker's hotel room and shabby cabarets, it turns out that the smuggled contents are not drugs, but a [[krytron]], an electronic switch used as a detonator for nuclear weapons, stolen and smuggled inside a souvenir replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]], on orders of some Arab country's agents.  The American embassy, working with Israeli agents, wants to get hold of the precious device, and they have no problem letting Sondra die for it. In order to save his wife, Walker joins forces with Michelle, who is only interested in getting her paycheck.\n\nThe film ends with a confrontation on the [[\u00cele aux Cygnes]], in the middle of the [[Seine]], next to the Paris Statue of Liberty replica there, where Sondra is to be released in exchange for the krytron. However, a gunfight ensues between the Arab agents who were to get the precious device, and the Israeli Mossad secret agents who traced them to get hold of it. The Arabs are killed in the crossfire but Michelle is hit too, dying soon after having slipped the krytron into Walker's pocket, with Sondra at their side.  Furious, Walker shows the krytron device to the Israeli agents, just to throw it into the Seine.  He carries Michelle's body away, ready to leave Paris with his wife.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Dr. Richard Walker\n* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as Michelle\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Sondra Walker\n* G\u00e9rard Klein as Gaillard\n* Jacques Ciron as The Hotel Manager\n* [[Dominique Pinon]] as Wino\n* [[Yves R\u00e9nier]] as The French Inspector\n* Robert M.
