The gangsters wipe out the military team, but they in turn are wiped by another party of masked men headed by a ''[[luchador]]''-masked leader who kills Sartana. Machete is arrested and hanged by corrupt Sheriff Doakes and Deputy Clebourne. However, he survives the hanging and the officers receive a call from the US President Rathcock. At the [[White House]], Rathcock offers to wipe Machete's criminal record and grant him citizenship if he can confirm a threat from Marcos Mendez, a psychopath who wants to fire a nuclear missile at [[Washington, D.C.]] if the American government does not stop the cartels and the corrupt Mexican government.\n\nMachete travels to [[San Antonio]], where he meets [[Agent handling|handler]] and [[beauty contestant]] Blanca Vasquez. At [[Acapulco]] he looks for Cereza, who can lead him to Mendez, but is attacked by brothel madam Desdemona, who is Cereza's mother. As Mendez's beloved virgin, Cereza warns Machete's about Mendez's [[split personality]]. As they travel to Mendez's headquarters, Mendez's enforcer Zaror receives a call from Mendez, and shoots Cereza.\n\nMachete learns that Mendez has wired the missile's launch device to his own heart so that if he dies, the missile fires. Mendez kills the device's designer and activates its 24-hour timer. Killing Zaror along the way, Machete intends to escort Mendez to the US and find a way to disarm the missile. Mendez shares that he is a self-proclaimed secret agent who tried to expose his corrupt superiors, only to be betrayed and forced to watch his wife and family being tortured and killed, causing him to develop the split personality.\n\nAs they head to the border, a [[contract killing|hit]] is put on Machete, and the two are targeted by multiple assailants including: Desdemona and her prostitute assassins; a [[shapeshifting]] hitman called El/La Camale\u00f3n; Doakes and Clebourne; and various locals. Machete and Mendez evade the assailants, only to be caught by a reborn Zaror and the masked  mercenaries who killed Sartana. Zaror decapitates Mendez, and Machete is riddled with bullets.\n\nMachete wakes up to find himself in a healing tank. He meets businessman and weapons inventor Luther Voz, who has kept Mendez's beating heart preserved in a jar. Voz shares his plan to manipulate extremists throughout the world to fire nuclear weapons at each other, to escape to an orbiting space station to rebuild society in space, and to have Machete succeed Zaror as a prototype for his army of cloned enforcers. Machete escapes the facility, meeting up with his old comrade Luz, who then refers him to Osiris, a former enemy who has since joined Luz's network and could possibly disarm the device.\n\nMachete contacts Vasquez to update her on progress, but is betrayed and ambushed at their meeting since Vasquez has sided with Voz. Machete follows her to the desert by jumping on her vehicle's rooftop, but is thrown off. Machete gets a ride from El Camale\u00f3n, who tries to kill him one last time, but he escapes, leaving El Camale\u00f3n to be killed by a racist group of [[rednecks]] on [[Border control|border patrol]]. Machete and Luz's Network infiltrate a fundraiser at Voz's base of operations, but Voz shoots the jar and kills Osiris. Machete realizes Voz was the masked man who killed Sartana and fights him. He severely burns Voz's face, forcing him to retreat and don a metallic silver mask. Meanwhile, Vasquez shoots Luz in her good eye, completely blinding her. Luz fights and kills Vasquez, but she in turn is [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|frozen in carbonite]] and captured by Voz.\n\nWhile Voz and his group depart to space, Machete jumps on Mendez's missile as it launches, disarming it in mid-air, and sending it into the [[Rio Grande]]. Rathcock's forces retrieve Machete; he tells him that the other missiles have been disarmed. Learning that Voz is in space, Rathcock then asks Machete to follow them there on a [[SpaceX]] rocket.\n\nFraming the beginning and end of the film are [[Trailer (film)|trailers]] that promote ''Machete Kills Again...In Space''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em | \n* [[Danny Trejo]]{{efn|name=\"faux trailer\"|Danny Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, Alexa Vega, and Lady Gaga are also mentioned by name in the in-film trailer for ''Machete Kills Again in Space''}} as [[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]], an ex-[[Federales|Federale]] agent who is recruited by the President of the United States to investigate Mendez\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]]{{efn|name=\"faux trailer\"}} as Luz, aka Sh\u00e9, the leader of an illegal immigrant aid movement known as the Network; which is investigating the mysterious disappearances of migrant workers.
