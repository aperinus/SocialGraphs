[[Brian Donlevy]] and [[Akim Tamiroff]] reprise their roles from Sturges' 1940 film ''[[The Great McGinty]]''.\n\n''The Miracle of Morgan's Creek'', which was filmed in 1942 and early 1943, but not released until 1944, was nominated for a 1945 [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and in 2001, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" The film ranks #54 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|100 Years... 100 Laughs]] list of the top 100 funniest films in movie history.\n\n==Plot==\nTrudy Kockenlocker is the daughter of the police chief of the small town of Morgan's Creek. Against her father's orders, she attends a wild farewell party for a group of soldiers at which she hits her head on a chandelier while dancing. The next morning, Trudy is in a daze and slowly begins to recall the previous night's events. She had married a soldier but cannot remember his name, except that \"it had a ''z'' in it. Like Ratzkywatzky...or was it Zitzkywitzky?\" She believes that she and the groom had used fake names, so she doesn't know how to get in touch with him and cannot remember what he looks like. She also does not have the marriage license.\n\nTrudy learns that she became pregnant that night as well. Norval Jones, a local [[Selective Service System#Classifications|4-F]] boy who has been in love with Trudy for years, steps in to help out, but Trudy's overprotective father becomes involved and complicates matters. Norval and Trudy devise a plan: they will get married secretly under false names, which will provide her a marriage certificate with the fake name of Ratzkywatzky and help her avoid a scandal. Later, Trudy will get a divorce, and she and Norval will get married legitimately.\n\nAt the rushed wedding ceremony, in which Norval wears an antique WW1 \u201cdoughboy\u201d uniform, a frazzled Norval mistakenly signs his real name and the minister calls the police. Norval is brought to the Kockenlocker house where military, state and federal officers fight with Constable Kockenlocker over jurisdiction. Norval is accused of abducting Trudy, impersonating a soldier, impairing the morals of a minor, resisting arrest and perjury. Trudy's father arrests Norval and locks him in the town jail after the justice of the peace rips up the fake marriage certificate. Trudy then tells her father the truth about the marriage, her pregnancy and Norval's attempt to pose as her groom. Her father agrees to let Norval escape so that he can find Trudy's real husband.\n\nNeeding money to begin his quest but with the bank where he works closed for the night, Norval sneaks into the bank with the constable's assistance to take $900 while leaving his bonds there that are worth the same amount. Trying to open a safe, Norval trips the burglar alarm, so Trudy and her sister Emmy tie up their father at the police station to make it look as if he had been incapacitated by a burglar. After months in hiding, Norval appears at his attorney's office, where he learns that the constable was fired after his ruse was not believed and that the Kockenlockers have moved out of town. Norval's attorney urges him to disappear, but Norval is determined to find Trudy. However, he is spotted in town by the bank manager, who alerts the police.\n\nNear the end of her pregnancy at Christmas time, the constable approaches the city council to tell them that Trudy wants to tell the real story and exonerate Norval. But before she can do so, Trudy goes into labor and is rushed to the hospital, where she gives birth to sextuplets, all boys. After receiving the news, Governor McGinty and The Boss demand that Norval be set free, with the charges dropped. Trudy's first marriage is annulled and Trudy and Norval are declared to be married after all. The governor even gives Norval a retroactive commission in the state guard, entitling him to legally wear a uniform, and Trudy\u2019s father is named police chief.\n\nWhen Norval discovers that Trudy has given birth to six boys, he is overwhelmed, and the film ends with this epilogue on a [[title card]]:{{blockquote|But Norval recovered and<br />became increasingly happy<br />for, as Shakespeare said:<br />\"Some are ''born'' great, some<br />''achieve'' greatness, and some<br />have greatness ''thrust upon<br />them''.\"<ref>The quote is said by the character [[Malvolio]] in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', Act II, Scene IV</ref>{{indent|8}}THE END|author=|title=|source=}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Miracle morgan creek.jpg|thumb|260px|1944 poster]]\n{{castlist|\n*[[Eddie Bracken]] as Norval Jones\n*[[Betty Hutton]] as Trudy Kockenlocker\n*[[Diana Lynn]] as Emmy Kockenlocker\n*[[William Demarest]] as Constable Kockenlocker\n*[[Porter Hall]] as Justice of the Peace\n*[[Emory Parnell]] as Mr. Tuerck\n*[[Al Bridge]] as Mr. Johnson\n*[[Julius Tannen]] as Mr. Rafferty\n*[[Victor Potel]] as Newspaper editor\n*[[Brian Donlevy]] as Gov.

In September 1942, Paramount sold a number of films, such as ''[[I Married a Witch]]'', to [[United Artists]], which needed to keep its distribution pipeline filled,<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=78841&category=Notes \"I Married a Witch\" Notes]</ref> but Paramount held on to ''The Miracle of Morgan's Creek'' because it was directed by Sturges, waiting for an opportunity to release it.<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=83564&category=Notes Notes]</ref>\n\nProblems arose with [[Hays Office]] censors because of the film's subject matter. In October 1942, after a story conference, the office sent Paramount a seven-page letter outlining their concerns, including those about lines spoken by the 14-year-old character Emmy and the Trudy character having been drunk and then pregnant. The office wanted the filmmakers to be \"extremely careful in handling a subject of this kind because of the delicate nature of the high point of the story,\" and to refrain from reiterating the basic facts of the story after they have been presented. In December 1942, they also warned about making any comparisons between Trudy's situation and the [[virgin birth of Jesus]].<ref name=tcmnotes /> There were so many objections from the censors that Sturges began production with only 10 approved script pages.<ref>Nixon, Rob & Tatara, Paul [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=83564&category=Articles \"The Miracle of Morgan's Creek\" (TCM article)]</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Department of War|War Department]] had concerns with the film's portrayal of the departing soldiers, demanding that the film \"should result in giving the audience the feeling that these boys are normal, thoroughly fit American soldiers who have had an evening of clean fun.\"<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nSturges' intent was to \"show what happens to young girls who disregard their parents' advice and who confuse patriotism with promiscuity,\" and had included in his script a sermon for the pastor to deliver, expressing Sturges' opinions, but the scene was cut by the studio because the pastor was depicted in too comic a manner.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\n''The Miracle of Morgan's Creek'' was in production from October 21 to December 23, 1942, with additional scenes shot on February 25, 1943.<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=83564&category=Overview Overview]</ref> Outdoor scenes were shot at the Paramount Ranch in Agoura, California.<ref>IMDb [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037077/locations Filming locations]</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at New York's [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount Theatre]] on January 19, 1944.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=1944-01-20|title='Miracle of Morgan's Creek' With Betty Hutton at Paramount\u2014'Lodger' at Roxy|page=15|work=The New York Times}}</ref> To promote the film, Paramount aired a 20-minute preview on the some 400 television sets then in use in New York City on March 21, 1944, with stills from the film, narration by Eddie Bracken and an interview with Diana Lynn.<ref name=tcmnotes /> Paramount asked reviewers not to reveal the ending to avoid spoiling it for those who had not yet seen the film.

[[Bosley Crowther]] wrote in ''The New York Times'': \"a more audacious picture&mdash;a more delightfully irreverent one&mdash;than this new lot of nonsense at the Paramount has never come slithering madly down the path. Mr. Sturges ... has hauled off this time and tossed a satire which is more cheeky than all the rest...It's hard to imagine how he ever got away with such a thing, how he ever persuaded the Hays boys that he wasn't trying to undermine all morals...Maybe the humor is forced a little, and it may be slightly difficult at times to understand precisely what in heck is going on. But that doesn't make any difference. At those times, you can catch your breath.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWriting in the ''Los Angeles Times'', reviewer Edwin Schallert wrote: \"It is a feature that is intensely, even stridently, a departure from the normal Hollywood output...you can have all the fun you wish out of this picture if you won't try to take it too seriously at any time. It belongs essentially to the screwball comedy school, and goes to most outlandish lengths in its climax, which has the misfortune to show up the whole thing.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Schallert|first=Edwin|date=1944-03-24|title=Sturges Sponsors Hectic Saga of Small Town Girl|page=22|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\nCritic [[James Agee]] noted that \"the Hays office has either been hypnotized into a liberality for which it should be thanked, or has been raped in its sleep\" to allow the film to be released.<ref name=\"amg\">Erickson, Hal [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:32822 Plot synopsis (Allmovie)]</ref> In a second review, Agee described the film as \"a little like taking a nun on a roller coaster.\"\n\nAlthough the Hays Office received many letters of protest because of its subject matter, the film was Paramount's highest-grossing film of 1944, taking in $9 million in box-office receipts while playing to standing-room-only audiences in some theaters.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
