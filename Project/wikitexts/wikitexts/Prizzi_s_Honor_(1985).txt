The screenplay co-written by [[Richard Condon]] is based on his [[Prizzi's Honor (novel)|1982 novel of the same name]]. The film's supporting cast includes [[Anjelica Huston]] (the director's daughter and Nicholson's then-girlfriend), [[Robert Loggia]], [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]], [[CCH Pounder]], [[Lawrence Tierney]], and [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]]. [[Stanley Tucci]] appears in a minor role in his film debut. It was the last of John Huston's films to be released during his lifetime.\n\n''Prizzi's Honor'' was theatrically released on June 14, 1985, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances of its cast (most notably Huston). It grossed $26 million against its $16 million budget.\n\nThe film received eight nominations at the [[58th Academy Awards]] (including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]) with Huston winning for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. The film also won four [[Golden Globe Awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for Nicholson and Turner, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nCharley Partanna is a [[hit man|hitman]] for a [[New York Mafia]] family headed by the elderly Don Corrado Prizzi, whose business is generally handled by his sons Dominic and Eduardo and by his longtime right-hand man, Angelo, who is Charley's father.\n\nAt a family wedding, Charley is quickly infatuated with a beautiful woman he doesn't recognize. He asks Maerose Prizzi, estranged daughter of Dominic, if she recognizes the woman, oblivious to the fact that Maerose still has feelings for Charley, having once been his lover. Maerose is in disfavor with her father for running off with another man before the end of her romance with Charley.\n\nCharley flies to California to carry out a contract to kill a man named Marxie Heller for robbing a [[Nevada]] casino. He is surprised to learn that Marxie is the estranged husband of Irene, the woman from the wedding. She repays some of the money Marxie stole as Charley naively (or willfully) believes that Irene was not involved with the casino scam. By this point they have fallen in love and eventually travel to [[Mexico]] to marry. A jealous Maerose travels west on her own to establish for a fact that Irene has double-crossed the organization. The information restores Maerose to good graces somewhat with her father and the don. Charley's father later reveals that Irene (who had claimed to be a tax consultant) is a \"contractor\" who, like Charley, performs assassinations for the mob.\n\nDominic, acting on his own, wants Charley out of the way and hires someone to do the hit, not knowing that he has just given the job to Charley's own wife. Angelo sides with his son, and Eduardo is so appalled by his brother's actions that he helps set up Dominic's permanent removal from the family.\n\nIrene and Charley team up on a kidnapping that will enrich the family, but she shoots a police captain's wife in the process, endangering the organization's business relationship with the cops. The don is also still demanding a large sum of money from Irene for her unauthorized activities in Nevada, which she doesn't want to pay. In time, the don tells Charley that his wife's \"gotta go.\"\n\nThings come to a head in California when, acting as if everything were alright, Charley comes home to his wife. Each pulls a weapon simultaneously in the bedroom. Irene ends up dead, and Charley ends up back in New York, missing her, but consoled by Maerose.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Charley Partanna\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Irene Walkervisks / Irene Walker\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Maerose Prizzi\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Eduardo Prizzi\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as Angelo \"Pop\" Partanna\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Don Corrado Prizzi\n* [[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]] as Dominic Prizzi\n* [[Michael Lombard]] as Rosario Filangi / Robert Finlay\n* [[C.

When her agent called up the movie's producer to request if she could be paid more, she was told \"Go to hell. Be my guest \u2014 ask for more money. We don't even want her in this movie.\" Huston, who was not only John Huston's daughter but also Jack Nicholson's girlfriend at the time, wrote in her 2014 memoir ''Watch Me'' that she later overheard a production worker saying, \"Her father is the director, her boyfriend's the star, and she has no talent.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Andrew Goldman |date=2019-04-29 |title=Anjelica Huston, In Conversation |publisher=Vulture |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/anjelica-huston-in-conversation.html |access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> She would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.\n\nA 25-year old [[Stanley Tucci]] made his film debut in ''Prizzi's Honor'', playing the minor role of a mafia goon.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Prizzi's Honor'' holds an approval rating of 85% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critics consensus states: \"Disturbing and sardonic, ''Prizzi's Honor'' excels at black comedy because director John Huston and his game ensemble take the farce deadly seriously.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prizzis_honor/|title = Prizzi's Honor|website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> {{Metacritic film prose|<!--score-->84|<!--number of reviews-->16|ref=y|access-date=September 4, 2022}} \n\n[[Pauline Kael]] wrote: \"This John Huston picture has a ripe and daring comic tone. It revels voluptuously in the murderous finagling of the members of a Brooklyn Mafia family, and rejoices in their scams. It's like ''[[The Godfather]]'' acted out by ''[[The Munsters]]''. Jack Nicholson's average-guyness as Charley, the clan's enforcer, is the film's touchstone: this is a baroque comedy about people who behave in ordinary ways in grotesque circumstances, and it has the juice of everyday family craziness in it.\"<ref>[http://geocities.com/paulinekaelreviews/p5.html]{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and half stars out of four and wrote: \"This is the most bizarre comedy in many a month, a movie so dark, so cynical and so funny that perhaps only Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner could have kept straight faces during the love scenes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/prizzis-honor-1985|title = Prizzi's Honor movie review & film summary (1985) &#124; Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
