It stars [[Simon Bird]], [[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]], [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] and [[Blake Harrison]]. ''The Inbetweeners Movie'' was released on 17 August 2011 in the UK and Ireland by [[Entertainment Film Distributors]], to favourable reviews, although its later release in the United States received mixed reviews from American critics. It was a considerable commercial success, setting the record for the biggest opening weekend for a comedy film in the UK. A sequel, ''[[The Inbetweeners 2]]'', was released on 6 August 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenage friends [[Will McKenzie]], [[Simon Cooper (fictional character)|Simon Cooper]], [[Jay Cartwright]], and [[Neil Sutherland (The Inbetweeners)|Neil Sutherland]] finish their [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] and prepare to leave Rudge Park Comprehensive. To celebrate, the boys decide to go on a \"lads holiday\" together to [[Malia, Crete]]. Arriving in the country, the boys find their accommodation to be a rundown hostel, and venture out later to experience the country's [[nightlife]]. In the town centre, the boys are tricked by a [[Seasonworker|rep]] into visiting a deserted bar, and there meet a group of four girls who are holidaying: Alison, Lucy, Lisa, and Jane. While their initial meeting and conversations do not go smoothly\u2014and Alison is already in a relationship with a local Greek waiter called Nicos\u2014the girls arrange to meet the boys again at the girl's hotel the following day. Simon sees his former girlfriend Carli across the street, but is introduced to her new love interest, James, a cocky, arrogant club rep. Carli reveals that she is going to an all-day boat party later in the week before she returns to England, and Simon promises to meet her there.\n\nThe next day, the boys meet the girls at their hotel, but after several mishaps involving Jay and Will, they are kicked out. Jay and Simon get into an argument over Simon's obsession with Carli and they briefly grapple in the street. Desperate to buy a ticket for the boat party to try to reconcile with Carli, Simon na\u00efvely \"sells\" all of his clothes to James without receiving payment. It is revealed Jay had bought four boat party tickets, but had torn up Simon's after the fight. Jay and Neil go to a club where they encounter James and his friends and try to befriend them, but James verbally abuses the pair, forcing them to leave. That evening, the four boys meet up and reconcile. The girls appear and Will and Alison, Simon and Lucy, and Jay and Jane all grow closer to each other, while Neil disappears with an older woman. The girls suggest that they all go [[Nude swimming|skinny dipping]] at the local beach. Jay becomes embarrassed when two men laugh at Jane for being overweight, and an upset Jane leaves him. Alison removes Will's glasses as they strip naked. While trying to find them, Will stumbles upon her boyfriend, Nicos, having sex with another woman and Alison leaves, distraught. In the sea, Lucy and Simon prepare to kiss, but Simon sees Carli on the beach and leaves Lucy alone, angering her. With the girls having left, the boys decide to visit various bars and clubs to get drunk.\n\nOn the day of the boat party, the group meet the girls again at the beach, where Alison reconciles with Will and gives him Nicos' ticket to join her on the boat. Elsewhere, Simon apologises to Lucy and she offers him her boat party ticket so that he can be with Carli. On board, Simon witnesses an argument between Carli and James. Carli kisses Simon passionately, but he realises that she is just using him to make James jealous; finally seeing Carli for her true colours, he leaves her. Will and Alison admit their feelings toward each other and Jay apologises to Jane and both start a relationship, while Neil and Lisa do the same. Jay and Jane encounter James who mocks Jane's weight and demands a banknote from Jay so that he can snort [[cocaine]]. Jay gets revenge on him by giving James a \u20ac20 note that was concealed in his anus, leaving James to unknowingly have [[faeces]] on his nose. Simon realises that Lucy is more worthy of his attention than Carli, and decides to swim back to shore to her as a romantic gesture; however, he nearly drowns on the way there. As he is taken back to the beach via air ambulance, Lucy kisses him and they reconcile.\n\nDuring the credits, the four boys and the girls spend the rest of their holiday together as couples. When the holiday ends, upon their return to England, the group say goodbye at Gatwick Airport and the girls are introduced to the boy's parents.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:The Inbetweeners Cast.jpg|thumb|From left to right: [[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]], [[Simon Bird]], [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] and [[Blake Harrison]]]]\nList of cast members:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Inbetweeners Movie (2011)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1716772/fullcredits#cast|work=Full list of Cast and Crew|access-date=20 August 2011}}</ref>\n{{div col |colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Simon Bird]] as [[Will McKenzie]]\n* [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Jay Cartwright|Jay Cartwright]]\n* [[Blake Harrison]] as [[Neil Sutherland (The Inbetweeners)|Neil Sutherland]] \n* [[Joe Thomas (actor)|Joe Thomas]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Simon Cooper|Simon Cooper]]\n* [[Emily Head]] as [[Carli D'Amato]]\n* [[Laura Haddock]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Alison|Alison]]\n* [[Tamla Kari]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Lucy|Lucy]]\n* [[Jessica Knappett]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Lisa|Lisa]]\n* [[Lydia Rose Bewley]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Jane|Jane]]\n* [[Theo James]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#James|James]]\n* [[Theo Barklem-Biggs]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Richard|Richard]]\n* [[Anthony Head]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Will's Dad|Mr. McKenzie]]\n* [[Belinda Stewart-Wilson]] as [[Polly McKenzie]]\n* [[Martin Trenaman]] as [[Alan Cooper (The Inbetweeners)|Alan Cooper]]\n* [[Robin Weaver]] as [[Pamela Cooper (The Inbetweeners)|Pamela Cooper]]\n* [[David Schaal (actor)|David Schaal]] as [[Terry Cartwright]]\n* Victoria Willing as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Mrs Cartwright|Mrs Cartwright]]\n* [[Alex Macqueen]] as [[Kevin Sutherland (The Inbetweeners)|Kevin Sutherland]]\n* [[Greg Davies]] as [[Mr Gilbert]]\n* [[Henry Lloyd-Hughes]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Mark Donovan|Mark Donovan]]\n* [[Lauren O'Rourke]] as [[List of The Inbetweeners characters#Nicole|Nicole]]\n* [[David Avery]] as Nicos\n* [[Cush Jumbo]] as Jaime\n* [[Storme Toolis]] as Wheelchair Girl\n* [[Aimee Kelly]] as Party Girl (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe official soundtrack consists of:<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/film/871385-the-inbetweeners-movie-soundtrack-to-feature-ten-songs-from-mike-skinner Metro.co.uk]</ref>\n{{div col |colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Miles Kane]] \u2013 \"Quicksand\"\n* [[Mike Skinner (musician)|Mike Skinner]] \u2013 \"No Problemo\"\n* \"Mental Holiday\" (from ''The Inbetweeners'') \n* [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]] \u2013 \"Gimme Love'\"\n* [[Kesha|Ke$ha]] \u2013 \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]] <small>(Cirkut Remix)</small>\"\n* \"Introduce Yourself\" (from ''The Inbetweeners'') \n* [[Yolanda Be Cool]] \u2013 \"[[We No Speak Americano]] <small>(Radio Edit)</small>\"\n* [[Axwell]] \u2013 \"Nothing but Love <small>(Radio Edit)</small>\"\n* Mike Skinner \u2013 \"Fernando's Theme\"\n* \"You're a Virgin\" (from ''The Inbetweeners'') \n* Mike Skinner \u2013 \"Twenty Euros\"\n* Mike Skinner \u2013 \"Waving Not Drowning\"\n* \"He Shoots He Scores\" (from ''The Inbetweeners'') \n* Mike Skinner \u2013 \"Clunge in a Barrel\"\n* [[Deer Tick (band)|Deer Tick]] \u2013 \"Twenty Miles\"\n* [[Calvin Harris]] \u2013 \"[[Feel So Close]] <small>([[Benny Benassi]] Remix)</small>\"\n* \"Smack in the Balls\" (from ''The Inbetweeners'')\n* Mike Skinner \u2013 \"We Are Go\"\n* [[Everything Everything]] \u2013 \"MY KZ, YR BF <small>(Grum Remix)</small>\"\n* Mike Skinner \u2013 \"Moanatronic 5000\"\n* The D.O.T \u2013 \"Whatever It Takes\" \n* \"Two Man Job\" (from ''The Inbetweeners'') \n* Mike Skinner \u2013 \"Do It\"\n* [[Sean Kingston]] \u2013 \"[[Party All Night (Sleep All Day)]]\"\n* [[Morning Runner]] \u2013 \"[[Gone up in Flames]]\" (''The Inbetweeners'' theme tune) \n* Mike Skinner \u2013 \"Pussay Patrol\"\n* \"To The Pussay\" (from ''The Inbetweeners'')\n{{div col end}}\nSongs not on the official soundtrack but featured in the film:\n* Demetrios Kousathanas - \"Pes to Mou to Nai\"\n* [[Pixie Lott]] \u2013 \"[[All About Tonight (Pixie Lott song)|All About Tonight]]\"\n* [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]] \u2013 \"[[Stay Too Long]]\"\n* [[Funky G]] \u2013 \"Kafana na Balkanu\"\n* [[Edward Maya]] & [[Mia Martina]] \u2013 \"Stereo Love\"\n* [[Diana Vickers]] \u2013 \"[[The Boy Who Murdered Love]]\"\n\n==Production==\n\nA first draft for The Inbetweeners Movie was completed before the third series was even written. The story remained mostly similar besides small changes such as a scene in which Jay hires a motorbike, pretending he knows how to ride it, but failing by crashing into a wall. This scene was removed during the writing process for the third series as the pair needed a humorous way to open the episode and thought the motor bike scene would be better suited to the episode than the movie.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in the United Kingdom ([[London]], [[West Sussex]]), [[Magaluf]], and [[Malia, Crete]].<ref>{{cite web|author=metrowebukmetro |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/film/857629-the-inbetweeners-movie-simon-bird-reveals-filming-abroad-was-carnage |title=The Inbetweeners movie: Simon Bird reveals filming abroad was carnage |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=9 March 2011 |access-date=20 January 2014}}</ref> A [[YouTube]] video shows the lads walking down the Malia Strip, walking past popular clubs 'Corkers', the strip club 'GoGo Lap Dancing Club' and 'Candy Club'.
