The film is directed by [[Brad Furman]], with a screenplay written by John Romano, and stars [[Matthew McConaughey]] as the titular lawyer, [[Mickey Haller]]. The film also stars [[Ryan Phillippe]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[William H. Macy]], and [[Bryan Cranston]].\n\nThe story is adapted from the first of several novels featuring the character of [[Mickey Haller]], who works out of a chauffeur-driven [[Lincoln Town Car]] rather than an office. Haller is hired to defend the son of a wealthy Los Angeles businesswoman in an assault case. Details of the crime bring up uncomfortable parallels with a former case, and Haller discovers the two cases are intertwined.\n\nThe film was released on March 18, 2011. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $87 million.\n\n==Plot==\nCriminal defense attorney [[Mickey Haller]] works in [[Los Angeles County, California|LA County, California]], mostly from the back of his black [[Lincoln Town Car]], chauffeured by Earl Briggs. Most of his career has been defending low-end criminals, such as a [[Motorcycling|biker]] club led by Eddie Vogel.\n\nHaller goes to meet Gloria Dayton, one of his former clients arrested for cocaine possession. Haller learned that she had a client, Hector Arrande Moya, who had paid her in cocaine for her services. He arranged an agreement with the prosecutor to trade this information for putting Dayton in the rehabilitation clinic at USC Med.\n\nHaller is hired for a high-profile case, representing wealthy Louis Roulet, a [[Beverly Hills]] playboy and son of real estate mogul Mary Windsor. He is accused of brutally beating prostitute Regina Campo, but insists he is the innocent victim of a setup. Haller and his investigator, Frank Levin, analyze photos and evidence and find the case similar to a past case where the client, Jesus Martinez, was tried for murdering a woman. Despite his repeated proclamations of innocence, Haller explains the overwhelming evidence and persuades Martinez to plead guilty to receive 15 years but avoid the death penalty.\n\nHaller's ex-wife, DA Maggie McPherson, has always disliked him representing guilty clients, though they remain close. Haller wonders if he was wrong for persuading Martinez to plead guilty to avoid the [[death penalty]]. Haller visits Martinez, who becomes agitated when Haller shows him Roulet's photo. Now believing Roulet is the killer in the Martinez case, he is bound by [[Attorney\u2013client privilege|attorney\u2013client confidentiality]] rules, and unable to reveal what he knows; it now becomes obvious why Roulet had chosen to hire Haller as his lawyer against the advice of his family lawyer.\n\nRoulet breaks into Haller's house and nonchalantly admits to committing the murder for which Martinez was convicted; through his sources, Roulet knew that Haller had been looking back into the previous case. Roulet makes veiled threats towards Haller's ex-wife and their daughter. Levin is found shot to death after leaving Haller a [[voicemail]] message claiming he found Martinez's \"ticket out of jail.\" Haller discovers that his late father's rare .22 [[Colt Woodsman]] is missing from its box, the same caliber gun that killed Levin.\n\nDetective Lankford, who dislikes Haller, discovers the gun's registration and suspects his involvement in Levin's murder. Haller is certain that Roulet stole the weapon when he broke into his home.\n\nLegally obliged to defend his client, guilty or not, Haller ruthlessly [[cross-examination|cross-examines]] Campo and discredits her in the jury's eyes. He then sets up a known prison informant, Dwayne Jeffrey \"DJ\" Corliss, with information on the previous murder, with the help of Dayton who is in the same USC Med facility as DJ. When the informant testifies, Haller discredits him, and the district attorney can only move to dismiss all charges. Roulet is set free, but the police arrest him immediately after for the previous murder, based upon testimony Haller coaxed from the informant.\n\nHaller acquires a pistol from Earl for protection. Roulet is released due to lack of evidence and intends to kill Haller's ex-wife and daughter. Haller is waiting at Maggie's when Roulet arrives. Haller vows that he will not stop until Martinez is freed and Roulet is convicted for his crime; Roulet mockingly tells him he cannot guard his family all the time. The bikers whom Haller previously represented suddenly arrive and brutally beat Roulet.\n\nMaggie discovers Levin had found a parking ticket issued to Roulet near the previous murder victim's house. It is strong evidence against Roulet in his pending murder trial and will support Martinez's innocence. Upon arriving home, Haller discovers Roulet's mother, Mary Windsor, waiting inside. She shoots him with the Colt Woodsman, confessing that she murdered Levin to protect her son. When Mary moves to shoot Haller again, he draws the pistol obtained from Earl and fatally shoots her.\n\nMartinez is released, and the DA will seek the [[death penalty]] for Roulet. As Haller rides off to his next case, he is pulled over by Vogel and the biker gang, whose case he takes [[pro bono]] in gratitude for their help.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Mickey Haller\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Margaret \"Maggie\" McPherson\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Louis Ross Roulet\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Ted Minton\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Val Valenzuela\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Jesus Martinez\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Cecil Dobbs\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Mary Windsor\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Detective Lankford\n* [[William H.

I thought it was very loyal to the story and the character of Mickey Haller. Matthew McConaughey nails him. Those who loved the book will love the movie, I think. Those who don't know the book will love it just the same. The casting and acting is really superb. Like I said, I could not be happier. I'm very excited and can't wait to see what fans of the book think.}}\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 stars out of a possible 4, saying, \"The plotting seems like half-realized stabs in various directions made familiar by other crime stories.
