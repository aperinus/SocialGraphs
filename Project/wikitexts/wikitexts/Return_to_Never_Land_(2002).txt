A [[sequel]] to [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s 1953 film ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (in turn based on [[J. M. Barrie]]'s 1904 stage play ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]''), the film follows Wendy's daughter who refuses to believe in her mother's story during [[the Blitz]] in [[London]], only to be mistakenly brought to [[Neverland]] by the pirates. In order for her to get home, she meets [[Peter Pan]], [[Tinker Bell]] and the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]] who encourage her to fly and make her believe. The film stars the voices of [[Harriet Owen]], Blayne Weaver, [[Corey Burton]], [[Jeff Bennett]], [[Kath Soucie]], [[Spencer Breslin]], and [[Bradley Pierce]].\n\nThe film was released on February 15, 2002, by [[Walt Disney Pictures]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=2009 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8160-6600-1 |edition=3rd |page=219}}</ref> and grossed $115 million against $20 million.\n\n==Plot==\nMany decades after the events of the [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|first film]], [[Wendy Darling]] is now grown up, married to a man named Edward, and has two children, Jane and Danny. With [[World War II]] raging, Edward leaves his family to fight, leaving Wendy to take care of the children. Jane becomes a very serious girl and, unlike her younger brother, refuses to believe in stories about Peter Pan and Neverland, referring to them as \"poppycock\". This ultimately leads to a furious argument with her mother and brother.\n\nOne evening, Wendy tells Jane and Danny that all the children in [[London]] will soon be [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to the [[countryside]] for their safety due to [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[The Blitz|bombing of the city]] by the [[Luftwaffe]]. Later that evening, Peter's arch-nemesis, [[Captain Hook]], and his pirate crew arrive on his pixie-dust enchanted ship and kidnaps Jane, mistaking her for Wendy, and takes her to Neverland, where they plan to feed Jane to an [[Cephalopod|octopus]] in order to lure Peter into a trap. However, Peter rescues Jane, and Hook escapes from the disgruntled octopus, returning to the ship. After Peter learns that Jane is Wendy's daughter, he takes her to his hideout to be the mother of the Lost Boys as Wendy once was, but Jane refuses. The following day, as the boys fail to teach Jane about flying, she angrily snaps at them and proclaims her disbelief in fairies, causing Tinker Bell to not fly and her light starts to fade. This gives Hook an idea to lure Jane to him, and then kidnap Peter.\n\nThat evening, Hook finds Jane and promises her that he \"wouldn't harm a single hair on [Peter's] head\" if she helps him find the treasure that Peter and the Lost Boys stole. Hook gives Jane a whistle to signal him when she finds it and leaves. Jane asks Peter and the boys to play a game of \"treasure hunt\", and they teach Jane how to act like a Lost Boy, hoping to get her to believe in fairies and save Tinker Bell's life. Jane finds the treasure and changes her mind, discarding the whistle. The boys make her a \"Lost Girl\", before Tootles finds and blows the whistle, inadvertently alerting the pirates, who capture the boys and expose Jane as their accomplice. Jane tries to convince Peter that it was a misunderstanding, but he berates her for her deception and reveals that her disbelief in fairies is causing Tinker Bell's light to fade.\n\nHorrified, Jane runs back to the hideout to find Tinker Bell's body. Jane is devastated, thinking the fairy is dead forever, but with Jane's new belief, Tinker Bell is revived. They head to the ship and see Hook forcing Peter to walk the plank. With Tinker Bell's help, Jane learns to fly. As Peter uses the anchor to sink the ship, the pirates, riding on a rowboat, are pursued by the octopus. After saying goodbye to the boys, Peter escorts Jane back home, where she reconciles with Wendy and Danny. Peter and Tinker Bell meet with Wendy again, then fly back to Neverland as Edward returns home and reunites with his family.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Harriet Owen as Jane, Wendy and Edward's daughter, and Danny's older sister who refuses to believe in stories, but changes her mind with Peter\u2019s help.
