The main departure from the 1943 film is the changing of the setting from wartime to a modern [[aerial firefighting]] operation.<ref>Evans 2000, p. 97.</ref> The film, however, follows the same basic plot line: the spirit of a recently dead expert pilot mentors a newer pilot, while watching him fall in love with the girlfriend he left behind.<ref name=\"Poltergeist\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096794/ \" 'Always' (1989).\"] ''imdb.com.'' Retrieved: December 27, 2010.</ref> The names of the four principal characters of the earlier film are all the same, with the exception of the Ted Randall character, who is called Ted Baker in the remake, and Pete's last name is Sandich instead of Sandidge.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Plot ==\nPete Sandich is an [[aerial firefighting|aerial firefighter]] whose excessive risk taking in the air deeply troubles his girlfriend, Dorinda Durston, a pilot who doubles as an air traffic controller for the fire fighters. It also concerns Pete's best friend, Al Yackey, a fellow firefighter pilot.\n\nAfter yet another risky and nearly fatal flight that Pete casually shrugs off, Al suggests he accept a safer job training firefighting pilots in Flat Rock, Colorado. Pete refuses until Dorinda tearfully confronts him, confessing her perpetual fear and anguish that he will be killed. Pete relents and tells Dorinda he will take the training job.\n\nPete flies one last mission, despite Dorinda's gloomy premonition. During the fire bombing run, Al's engine catches fire and is about to explode. Pete makes a dangerously steep dive and skillfully douses Al's engine with a fire-retardant [[Phos-Chek|slurry]], saving Al. As Pete struggles to regain control from the dive, he flies directly through the forest fire, igniting his own engine and causing the aircraft to explode.\n\nPete strolls through a burnt-out forest. Coming to a small clearing, he meets Hap, who explains Pete died in the explosion and now has a new purpose: As spirits did for him during his lifetime, he will provide ''Spiritus'' (\"the divine breath\") to guide others who will interpret his words as their own thoughts.\n\nAlthough time is non-linear from Pete's perspective, six months have elapsed in the real world  and Al wants a grieving Dorinda to move past Pete's death. He takes her with him to Colorado to work at the flight school where Pete was to command pilots who will be training to fight fires, one of which is Ted Baker. More months pass and, to Pete's anguish, Ted falls in love with Dorinda as she begins emerging from her year-long mourning. Pete attempts to sabotage the budding romance, but Hap reminds him that his life ended; he was sent to inspire Ted, but also to bid Dorinda farewell.\n\nTed, with Pete's inspiration, plans a dangerous rescue mission of trapped firefighters. Unable to bear another loss, Dorinda takes Ted's aircraft to do the job herself. Pete, unseen by Dorinda, fails to dissuade her. However, with Pete's guidance, Dorinda is able to save the firefighters who are trapped on the ground. On the return flight, Pete tells her everything he wanted to say in life.\n\nDorinda makes an emergency [[water landing]] in a lake. As the sinking plane's cockpit floods, Dorinda seems reluctant to escape. Pete appears before her and, offering his hand, leads her to the surface. As Dorinda, now alone, wades ashore, Pete releases her heart to allow Ted to replace him.\n\nDorinda walks back to the airbase and embraces Ted. Pete smiles and heads in the opposite direction to assume his place in the hereafter.\n\n== Cast ==\nAs appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):<ref name=\"credits\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096794/fullcredits \"Always (1989) Full credits.\"] ''IMDb.''</ref>\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Pete Sandich\n* [[Holly Hunter]] as Dorinda Durston\n* [[John Goodman]] as Al Yackey\n* [[Brad Johnson (actor, born 1959)|Brad Johnson]] as Ted Baker\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as \"Hap\"\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Dave\n* [[Keith David]] as \"Powerhouse\"\n* Ed Van Nuys as \"Nails\"\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as Rachel\n* [[Dale Dye]] as Don\n* Brian Haley as Alex\n* James Lashly as Charlie\n* Michael Steve Jones as Grey\n* [[Doug McGrath]] as Bus Driver\n\n===Casting===\n\n[[Dustin Hoffman]] was offered a role but turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/14/dustin-hoffman-interview-simon-hattenstone|title=Dustin Hoffman: Facing down my demons|website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=14 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nSpielberg confided that while making ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' in 1974, he and Dreyfuss had traded quips from ''A Guy Named Joe'', considered a \"classic\" war film, that they both wanted to remake.<ref name=\"Ebert\" />{{#tag:ref|Originally intended to be an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] project, the film underwent a protracted 10-year gestation, with [[Tom Cruise]] reputedly being considered for the Ted Baker role.<ref>Freer 2001, p. 183.</ref>|group=Note}} As an \"inside joke,\" a clip from ''A Guy Named Joe'' is included in a scene in ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'',<ref name=\"Poltergeist\" /> which Spielberg had produced.
