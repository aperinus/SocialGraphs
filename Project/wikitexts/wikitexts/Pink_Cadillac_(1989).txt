The film stars [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Bernadette Peters]] and also has small cameo appearances by [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Bryan Adams]]. ''Pink Cadillac'' marks the third and final collaboration between Eastwood and director [[Buddy Van Horn]], following ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' (1988), as well as Van Horn's final film as a director.\n\n== Plot ==\nA white supremacist group is chasing Lou Ann ([[Bernadette Peters]]), whose husband Roy ([[Timothy Carhart]]) is a member. She has inadvertently taken counterfeit money from them by running away with his car (the pink Cadillac), which held the supremacists' stash.\n\nTommy Nowak ([[Clint Eastwood]]) is a [[Skiptrace|skip-tracer]] whose speciality is dressing up in disguises, such as a rodeo clown, to fool whomever he is after. Tommy takes on the job of finding Lou Ann because she skipped bail.\n\nWhen he finally finds her in [[Reno, Nevada]], Tommy slowly becomes enamored. Roy and his gang kidnap her baby, whom Lou Ann has left with her sister ([[Frances Fisher]]), so Tommy decides to help Lou Ann get the baby back instead of turning her in. While driving through the West, seeking the baby, romance blossoms. They eventually fight the white supremacists and retrieve the baby.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Tommy Nowak\n* [[Bernadette Peters]] as Lou Ann McGuinn\n* [[Timothy Carhart]] as Roy McGuinn\n* [[John Dennis Johnston]] as Waycross\n* [[Michael Des Barres]] as Alex\n* [[Jimmie F.

Caryn James wrote: \"When it's time to look back on the strange sweep of Clint Eastwood's career, from his ambitious direction of ''Bird'' to his coarse, classic [[Dirty Harry]] character, ''Pink Cadillac'' will probably settle comfortably near the bottom of the list. It is the laziest sort of action comedy, with lumbering chase scenes, a dull-witted script and the charmless pairing of Mr. Eastwood and Bernadette Peters.\" (''[[New York Times]]'', May 26, 1989.)\n\nHal Hinson praised the performers: Peters \"...plays her comic scenes with a vivacious abandon...\" She \"loosens him (Eastwood) up... and humanizes him. These two make a nifty comic team.\"<ref>Hinson, Hal.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/pinkcadillacpg13hinson_a0a93c.htm \u2018Pink Cadillac\u2019 (PG-13)\"].''Washington Post'', May 26, 1989</ref>\n\n''Pink Cadillac'' was released in May 1989, opening against ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. The film eventually grossed $12,143,484. In contrast, the movie Eastwood made just prior to ''Pink Cadillac'', the fifth Dirty Harry movie, ''[[The Dead Pool]]'', grossed $37,903,295.<ref>[https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pinkcadillac.htm \"Eastwood boxoffice\"].[[Box Office Mojo]], retrieved March 22, 2010</ref> Perhaps due to the poor reviews and meager box office, the film is, as of 2021, Eastwood's last action comedy.\n\nIt has a 24% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 21 reviews.<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|pink_cadillac}}</ref> It also went direct to video in the United Kingdom, without a cinema release.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Howard|title=Aim for the Heart|publisher=[[I.B.
