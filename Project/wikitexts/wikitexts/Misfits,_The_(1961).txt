Adapted by Miller from his own short story of the same name published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in October 1957,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://classic.esquire.com/article/1957/10/1/the-misfits|title=The Misfits|last=Miller|first=Arthur|author-link=Arthur Miller|magazine=Esquire|date=October 1957|accessdate=January 3, 2022}}</ref> ''The Misfits'' was the last completed film for both Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. For Gable, the film was posthumously released, and Marilyn Monroe died in August 1962. The plot centers on a newly divorced woman, Roslyn Tabor, (Monroe) and her time in Reno and Northern Nevada, spent with her friendly Reno landlady Isabelle Steers ([[Thelma Ritter]]), an old-school [[cowboy]] (Gable), the cowboy's tow truck-driving and plane-flying best friend (Wallach) and their rodeo-riding, bronc-busting friend (Clift) in [[Dayton, Nevada]], and in the western Nevada desert, in 1960. Roslyn has been in Reno for her six-week Nevada residency, living with Isabelle Steers, for her divorce from her husband, Raymond Tabor. ([[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]])\n\n''The Misfits'' was a commercial failure at the time of its initial release, but received critical acclaim for its script and performances. Its reputation has shifted over the following years, and many critics now consider the film to be a masterpiece and one of the best films of the 1960s.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Reno, Nevada]], 30-year-old Roslyn Tabor files for a quickie six-week residency divorce from her inattentive husband, Raymond. Afterward, Roslyn's landlady Isabelle takes her to a cocktail lounge at Harrah's for drinks. At Harrah's they meet an aging cowboy named Gaylord Langland, and his tow truck driver best friend, Guido. The friendly Guido tells Roslyn and Isabelle about his unfinished house in the country by Pyramid Lake. Later that day, the group drives out to the unfinished house Guido has built for his late wife. After drinking and dancing, Roslyn has had too much to drink, so Gaylord drives her home to Reno.\n\nEventually, Roslyn and Gaylord move into Guido's half-finished house and work on finishing it. One day, Gaylord tells Roslyn how he wishes he were more of a father to his children, whom he has not seen for years. Later, he discovers rabbits have been eating the lettuce in the garden they have planted. Gay wants to kill the rabbits with his shotgun, an idea that Roslyn opposes.\n\nWhen Guido and Isabelle show up, Guido suggests that they round up wild [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]] to sell. They go to a local [[rodeo]] to hire a third man. They run into Perce Howland, a cowboy friend of Gaylord's, who wants to compete in the rodeo. Gaylord offers to pay the broke Perce's $10 entry fee if he will help round up mustangs the next day.  \n\nAt the rodeo, Roslyn becomes somewhat upset when Guido tells her how the [[Saddle bronc and bareback bronc riding#Flank strap controversy|horses are made to buck with an irritating flank strap]]. Perce is thrown by a bucking horse, and Roslyn begs him to go to a hospital, and offers him money if he won't ride again, but he insists on [[Bull riding|riding a bull]] he had already signed up and paid to ride. He gets thrown again, sustaining a head injury.\n[[File:The Misfits (1961) trailer 2.jpg|thumb|right|262px|[[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Rex Bell]], [[Eli Wallach]], and [[Montgomery Clift]]]]\nLater, he passes out in a back alley. When he regains consciousness, he sees Roslyn crying over him. He says that he never had anyone cry for him before and that he wished he had a friend to talk to. He tells her how his mother changed after his father died, giving his stepfather the ranch Perce's father wanted to leave to Perce. A drunken Gaylord then fetches Roslyn, telling her that he wants her to meet his kids, claiming he unexpectedly ran into them. When Gaylord discovers his children have already left the bar, he causes a public scene.\n\nDuring the drive home, a drunken Guido recalls his wartime service as a [[bomber]] pilot and asks if Roslyn has left Gaylord and offers to take his place. Back at Guido's house, Guido attempts to finish the patio he started. Later, Gaylord asks Roslyn if a woman like her would ever want to have a child with him. She avoids the issue.\n\nThe next day, Gaylord, Guido and Perce go after the mustangs, with Roslyn reluctantly tagging along. Guido uses his [[biplane]] to flush out the horses from the mountains, and it turns out that there are only five of them, a stallion and four mares. Pierce says that it is barely worth it to pursue so few horses.\n\nRoslyn becomes upset when she learns that they will be slaughtered for dog food. Gaylord tells Roslyn that he has always caught mustangs and that they used to be in immense herds, and that they made fine riding horses. But over time, he says, \"they changed it all around\" and now what was good is considered bad. He says that he catches the mustangs to preserve his freedom and prevent him from having to take a job for wages.\n\nAfter they catch the mustangs, Roslyn begs Gaylord to release the horses. He considers it, but when she offers to pay him $200, it angers him. Guido tells Roslyn that he would release them if she would leave Gaylord for him. She rebuffs him. Perce asks her if she wants him to set the horses free, but she declines because she thinks it would only start a fight. Perce frees the stallion anyway. After Gaylord chases down and subdues it by himself, he lets it go and says he just did not want anybody making up his mind for him. He pledges never to catch mustangs again, and says that what used to be good is now \"smeared in blood,\" and that roping mustangs is now like \"roping a dream.\" He says he has to \"find another way to be alive, if there is one.\"\n\nAs they are driving away in Gaylord's truck, Roslyn tells Gaylord that she will leave the next day. He stops the truck to pick up his dog and watches her joyfully untethering it. They snuggle together as he drives home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columnslist|\n* [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Roslyn Tabor\n* [[Clark Gable]] as Gaylord Langland\n* [[Montgomery Clift]] as Perce Howland\n* [[Thelma Ritter]] as Isabelle Steers\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as Guido\n* [[James Barton (actor)|James Barton]] as Fletcher's grandfather\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Raymond Tabor\n* [[Estelle Winwood]] as Church lady collecting money in bar\n* [[Rex Bell]] (uncredited) as Old cowboy\n* [[Philip Mitchell]] (uncredited) as Charles Steers\n* [[Marietta Tree]] (uncredited) as Susan\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Marilyn Monroe Misfits.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Estelle Winwood]], [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Clark Gable]] in foreground, [[Eli Wallach]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] in background at left]]\nThe making of ''The Misfits'' was troublesome on several accounts, not the least of which was the sometimes 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) heat<ref>{{cite book | author=Arthur Miller | author-link=Arthur Miller | title=Timebends: A Life | page=[https://archive.org/details/timebendslife00mill/page/470 470] | year=1995 | publisher=Penguin | isbn=978-0-14-024917-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/timebendslife00mill/page/470 }}</ref> of the northern Nevada desert and the breakdown of Monroe's marriage to writer [[Arthur Miller]].

Primary sources such as ''The Making of the Misfits'' by James Goode, ''Conversations with Marilyn'' by W.J. Weatherby, and Miller's account, particularly his assertion that ''The Misfits'' script was a \"valentine\" for Monroe, inspired the docu-drama play ''Misfits'' by [[Alex Finlayson]], which was commissioned by director [[Greg Hersov]].
