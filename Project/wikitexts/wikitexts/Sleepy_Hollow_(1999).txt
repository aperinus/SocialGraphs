It is a [[film adaptation]] loosely based on [[Washington Irving]]'s 1820 short story \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\", and stars [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Christina Ricci]], with [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Michael Gambon]], [[Casper Van Dien]], [[Christopher Lee]] and [[Jeffrey Jones]] in supporting roles. The plot follows police constable [[Ichabod Crane]] (Depp) sent from New York City to investigate a series of murders in the village of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] by a mysterious [[Headless Horseman]].\n\nDevelopment began in 1993 at [[Paramount Pictures]], with [[Kevin Yagher]] originally set to direct [[Andrew Kevin Walker]]'s script as a low-budget [[slasher film]]. Disagreements with Paramount resulted in Yagher being demoted to [[prosthetic makeup]] designer, and Burton was hired to direct in June 1998. Filming took place from November 1998 to May 1999. The film was an international co-production between Germany and the United States.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]] on November 17, 1999, and was released in the United States on November 19, 1999, by Paramount Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances, direction, screenplay and musical score, as well as its dark humor, visual effects and atmosphere. It grossed approximately $207&nbsp;million worldwide. ''Sleepy Hollow'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1799, Ichabod Crane, a New York City police constable criticized for his favoritism of scientific methods, is dispatched to the [[Hudson Highlands|upstate]] [[Dutch people|Dutch]] hamlet of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], which has been plagued by a series of brutal [[decapitation]]s: a wealthy father and son, Peter and Dirk Van Garrett, and a widow, Emily Winship. Received by the insular town elders\u2014wealthy businessman Baltus Van Tassel, town doctor Thomas Lancaster, the Reverend Steenwyck, [[notary]] James Hardenbrook, and [[magistrate]] Samuel Philipse\u2014Ichabod learns that locals believe the [[Headless Horseman|killer]] is the undead apparition of a headless [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] mercenary from the [[American Revolutionary War]] who rides a black steed in search of his missing head.\n\nIchabod, however, is skeptical of the paranormal due to his family's past which involves his kind and free spirited mother's murder at the hand of his zealot father. Boarding at the home of Baltus Van Tassel and his second wife, Lady Van Tassel, he is taken with Baltus' spiritual daughter, Katrina, from his first marriage. When a fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath, a servant in the Van Garrett household, is killed, Ichabod takes the victim's son, Young Masbath, under his wing. Ichabod and Masbath [[Exhumation|exhume]] the victims on a tip from Philipse, learning that the widow died pregnant. The horseman decapitates Philipse next. Ichabod, Young Masbath, and Katrina venture into the Western Woods, where the Horseman is said to have been executed by his own swords, to look for the Horseman's grave. They find a crone [[witch]] living in a cave, who reveals that the Horseman's grave is at the \"Tree of the Dead\", where heads of all the Horseman's victims are kept. Ichabod digs up the Horseman's grave and discovers the skull has been taken, deducing that it has been stolen by someone who now controls him. The tree is his portal into the living world and the Horseman will continue to take people's heads until his skull is restored to him.\n\nThat night, the Horseman kills village midwife Beth Killian and her family, as well as Katrina's suitor Brom Van Brunt when he attempts to intervene; Ichabod is wounded by the Horseman, but survives. Ichabod hypothesizes that the Horseman is attacking targets linked by a conspiracy. Hardenbrook reveals that the first victim, Peter Van Garrett, who had secretly married the widow, wrote a new [[Will and testament|will]] that left his estate to her and her unborn child. Ichabod deduces that all the victims (except Brom) were either beneficiaries, witnesses for this new will, and that the Horseman's master is the person who would have otherwise [[Inheritance|inherited]] the estate: Baltus, a Van Garrett relative.\n\nUpon discovering the accusation, Katrina angrily burns the evidence. Hardenbrook commits suicide, and Steenwyck convenes a town meeting at the church to discredit Ichabod, but Baltus bursts in, announcing that the Horseman has killed Lady Van Tassel. The Horseman attacks the church, but is unable to enter. In the chaos, the remaining elders turn on each other. Steenwyck kills Lancaster and is in turn killed by Baltus, who is [[harpoon]]ed and decapitated by the Horseman.\n\nInitially concluding that Katrina controls the Horseman, Ichabod discovers that the diagram she drew beneath his bed and in the church, which he believed summoned the Horseman, is really one of protection. He finds that a wound on one hand of the \"Lady Van Tassel's\" decapitated body (that was caused during her affair with Steenwyck which Ichabod witnessed) was caused post-mortem. Lady Van Tassel, alive and well, reveals herself as the master of the Horseman. She faked her death and killed the Van Tassel's servant girl, Sarah, to plant her body as hers. She takes Katrina to the windmill and summons the Horseman to behead Katrina, the last person remaining in the way of the will. She explains her true heritage. She and her twin sister were members of the impoverished Archer family who were evicted years ago by Peter Van Garrett, when he favored Baltus and his family instead. She swore vengeance against Garrett and all who had wronged her family, [[Deal with the Devil|pledging herself to Satan]] if he would raise the Horseman to avenge her by killing them, which would allow her to claim the Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates uncontested. Manipulating her way into the Van Tassel household, she used fear, blackmail, and lust to manipulate the other elders into her plot. Having eliminated all other heirs, witnesses or, in case of the midwife Beth, anyone aware of the existence of widow Winship's child and its father, as well as her sister \u2013 the crone witch \u2013 for aiding Ichabod, she summons the Horseman to finish Katrina.\n\nIchabod and Masbath rush to the windmill as the Horseman arrives. After an escape that destroys the windmill and a subsequent chase to the Tree of the Dead, Ichabod retrieves the Horseman's skull from Lady Van Tassel and returns it to him, breaking the curse, and setting the Horseman free from Lady Van Tassel's control. With his head restored, the Horseman spares Katrina and instead takes Lady Van Tassel, giving her a bloody kiss and returning to [[Hell]] via the Tree of the Dead with her in tow, fulfilling her end of the 'deal'. With the case solved, Ichabod returns to New York City with Katrina and Young Masbath, just in time for the new century.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Ichabod Crane]]: Crane is a quirky, yet sympathetic [[constable]] infatuated with integrating modern science into police procedures (early [[forensic science]]), but is very squeamish at the sight of blood and bugs.\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Katrina Van Tassel: Ichabod's love interest and the only heir to one of the town's richest farmers.
