J. Hogan|P.{{nbsp}}J. Hogan]] from a screenplay by [[Ronald Bass]]. The film stars [[Julia Roberts]], [[Dermot Mulroney]], [[Cameron Diaz]], and [[Rupert Everett]].\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics and was a [[1997 in film|global box-office hit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=1997&p=.htm|title= 1997 Worldwide Grosses|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> The soundtrack song \"[[I Say a Little Prayer]]\" was covered by singer [[Diana King]] and featured heavily in the film, making it a U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] hit. The [[soundtrack]] featured a number of [[Burt Bacharach]]/[[Hal David]] songs.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nThree weeks before her 28th birthday, New York City food critic Julianne \"Jules\" Potter receives a call from her lifelong friend Michael O'Neal, a Chicago sportswriter. Years earlier, the two agreed that if they were both unmarried by age 28, they would marry each other. Michael tells her that in four days, he will marry beautiful Kimmy Wallace, a college student eight years his junior whose father owns the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Realizing that Michael is the love of her life, Jules resolves to sabotage his wedding. Arriving in Chicago, she reunites with Michael and meets Kimmy, who asks her to be the [[maid of honor]]. Jules schemes to break up the couple, but her attempt to humiliate Kimmy at a karaoke bar backfires. She manipulates Kimmy into asking her father to offer Michael a job, which Jules knows will anger Michael, but this fails as well.\n\nFrustrated, Jules begs her friend George Downes for help, and he flies to Chicago. On George's advice, Jules prepares to tell Michael how much she loves him, but instead tells him that she is engaged to George, hoping to make Michael jealous. George, who is gay, plays along but embarrasses Jules at lunch with the wedding party, singing \"[[I Say a Little Prayer]]\" as the whole restaurant joins in. George flies home, and Jules tells Michael that her \"relationship\" with George is over. Michael admits to feeling jealous and gives her the chance to confess her own feelings, but she lets the moment pass. They share a dance as Michael sings their song, \"[[The Way You Look Tonight]]\".\n\nThe day before the wedding, at Kimmy's father's office, Jules uses his email account to forge a message from him to Michael's boss, asking that Michael be fired to allow Kimmy's father to hire him at Kimmy's insistence. She saves the message rather than send it, but later realizes that Kimmy's father has unknowingly sent the email. Jules lies to enlist Michael's help, but they find the office locked. Returning to Jules' hotel, Michael receives a message from his boss notifying him of the email. Furious, he calls Kimmy, calling off the wedding.\n\nThe next morning, Jules discovers that neither Michael nor Kimmy have told anyone else that the wedding is off. She tries to manipulate the couple into breaking up for good, but Michael and Kimmy decide to get married after all. Jules finally confesses her love to Michael and passionately kisses him. Kimmy witnesses this and drives away, pursued by Michael, who is followed by Jules in a caterer's truck. Jules calls George, who assures her that Michael loves Kimmy. Finding Michael at [[Chicago Union Station]], Jules confesses to everything. He forgives her and tells her that here at the station is where he proposed to Kimmy and she accepted, and they split up to look for Kimmy.\n\nJules finds Kimmy in the bathroom of [[U.S. Cellular Field|Comiskey Park]]. Amid a crowd of onlookers, Kimmy confronts Jules for interfering with Michael. Jules apologizes, assuring Kimmy that Michael truly loves her, and they reconcile. The wedding proceeds, and at the reception, Jules gives a heartfelt speech as Kimmy's maid of honor. Jules allows the newlyweds to temporarily have \"The Way You Look Tonight\" as their song until they find their own song. Jules and Michael share their goodbyes, both finally moving on. On the phone with George, Jules is surprised to see him at the reception, and they dance together.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Julianne Potter, a 27-year-old food critic who realizes she's in love with her best friend Michael and tries to win him back after he decides to marry someone else.\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Michael O'Neal, Julianne's best friend and a sportswriter who is engaged to Kimmy Wallace.\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Kimmy Wallace, Michael's bubbly and lovable fianc\u00e9e who comes from an affluent family.\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as George Downes, Julianne's gay friend and editor who pretends to be engaged to Julianne to make Michael jealous.\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Walter Wallace, husband of Isabelle, father of Kimmy, and future father-in-law of Michael.
