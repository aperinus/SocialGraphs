The girl, however, becomes distracted by her elderly retired aviator neighbor, who tells her the story of the \"Little Prince\", claiming that he encountered him in the [[Sahara]] after crash-landing there. The aviator recounts the Little Prince asking him to draw a sheep. He drew two sheep (including a ram) before the Little Prince complained he needed a sheep that would live forever. The aviator drew a box with three holes saying that the sheep that he desired was inside it, which satisfied the Little Prince, much to the aviator's surprise.\n\nThe girl and the aviator continue to read and play together without the mother's knowledge. The aviator tells the girl about the Little Prince's home, \"[[Asteroid]] B-612\", covered in [[Adansonia|baobab sprouts]]. He states that after clearing away the sprouts, the Little Prince discovered and found and nurtured a [[Rose]] into maturity. Despite becoming his friend, she was rather selfish and both too young to know how to love each other, which caused the Little Prince to travel to elsewhere with a flock of birds. During his journey, he meets adults that live on other asteroids, such as a king, a conceited man, and a wealthy businessman. The Little Prince eventually landed on Earth, meeting a snake who tells him where he is. The little Prince then meets and befriends a [[red fox]]. After a while, the fox bade goodbye to the Little Prince, advising him to always see with his heart. The aviator gives the girl a [[Stuffed toy|stuffed]] fox as a gift, telling her that he will leave soon to go find the Little Prince.\n\nThe two decide to go out for her \"birthday\", but when they are pulled over by a police officer, the aviator is revealed to have no [[Driver's licence|licence]] and the officer takes the girl home. Realising that she has not been following the plan, her infuriated mother redoubles her daughter's assignments. Nevertheless, the girl continues to read the story of the Little Prince, secretly visiting the aviator to find out the story's ending. The aviator tells her that the Little Prince had succumbed to a [[venomous snake]] bite to be reunited with his beloved Rose. Although the aviator assures her that he firmly believes the Little Prince succeeded, the girl, upset by the dark twist to the story, wishes that she had never met the aviator or heard the story. The girl tries to forget about the Little Prince, and focuses on her assignments.\n\nTowards the summer's end, the aviator is hospitalised. Deciding to put things right, the girl sets off in search of the Little Prince. Escaping out through her bedroom window to go to the aviator's yard, the girl, accompanied by her now-conscious stuffed fox and The Little Prince's story pages, flies the aviator's now-fixed plane into space. They find all the stars mysteriously gone, all the while landing on an asteroid populated by workaholic adults owned by the Businessman from the Little Prince's story, who captures and holds all the stars to power his asteroid and belongings (including his employees). After encountering a police officer and an [[elevator operator]] who were the Conceited man and the King from the story, they finally find the Little Prince, who has become an anxious, incompetent adult renamed \"Mr. Prince\" and works as a janitor for the Businessman, having no recollection or memory \nof his past.\n\nMr. Prince accordingly takes the girl to an \"academy\" where she is to be \"reconditioned\" as an adult via a machine controlled by a tall, sinister Teacher. Recognising the drawing of his sheep's box from the aviator's pages, which he still keeps the original despite his amnesia, believing it could be important, Mr. Prince begins to regain his memories and saves the girl from the same fate that he had by putting the Teacher in the machine instead.\n\nThey escape from the Businessman together and liberate all of the stars from his glass vault, which return to their rightful place in the sky. The girl and the fox then take Mr. Prince back to B-612, which is overgrown with dead, withered baobabs. They find the Rose dead, but seeing her image in the sunrise, the baobabs disappear and Mr. Prince turns back to his younger self, giving him renewed hope.\n\nThe girl and the fox (once again an inanimate toy) return home, accompanied by another flock of birds. The next morning, the girl and her mother visit the aviator in the hospital. The girl apologises and presents him with the formerly loose pages bound together as [[The Little Prince|a book]], along with all the formerly missing parts filled in. The girl subsequently begins her studies at Werth Academy and reconciles with her mother. Both of them happily [[Amateur astronomy|stargaze]] one night, while the Little Prince and the aviator are heard laughing joyfully together on Asteroid B-612.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015 47.jpg|thumb|The film's crew at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]: (from bottom right) [[Mackenzie Foy]], Riley Osborne, [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]], [[Marion Cotillard]] and other actors who provided the French and Japanese voices.]]\n* Riley Osborne as the Little Prince,<ref name=\"NewsweekTrailer\">{{cite news |last1=Mejia |first1=Paula |title=Big-Budget ''The Little Prince'' Film Unveils Official Trailer |url=http://www.newsweek.com/big-budget-little-prince-film-unveils-official-trailer-323895 |access-date=8 May 2015 |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=21 April 2015 }}</ref> an eternally young boy and resident of \"[[Asteroid]] B612\", a small asteroid roughly the same size as him.\n** [[Paul Rudd]] as Mr. Prince,<ref name=\"Variety Review\">{{cite news |last1=Foundas |first1=Scott |title=Film Review: ''The Little Prince'' |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/the-little-prince-cannes-review-1201503230/ |access-date=21 June 2015 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=22 May 2015}}</ref> the adult Little Prince who has forgotten his own childhood and becomes an anxious, incompetent [[janitor]] for the Businessman.\n* [[Mackenzie Foy]] as the Little Girl, a smart, feisty and precocious girl with a kind heart.

Model maker Joe Schmidt (the modeller of ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'') created this suitcase, which held the art book, and told the story of the movie visually.<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/> Schmidt had created a snapshot of Osborne's vision for the film. A constellation of tiny planets and stars lit up on one side, a giant art book of illustrations filled the other. From somewhere deep inside the case, Osborne pulled out two large white circles that held slides that when placed up to each eye displayed 3-D images of stop-motion puppets. Then Osborne started flipping switches. In no time, a one-way mirror slid away to reveal a hidden chamber holding a collection of yellowed pages below. It was a mock-up of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original manuscript, a key plot point in Osborne's film.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> In four years, Osborne pitched the movie close to 400 times.<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nOn 5 June 2013, it was announced that [[James Franco]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Mackenzie Foy]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Rachel McAdams]] and [[Jeff Bridges]] joined the film.<ref>{{cite news |title=James Franco, Rachel McAdams, Jeff Bridges Among Voice Stars for ''The Little Prince'' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-franco-rachel-mcadams-jeff-563612 |access-date=15 September 2013 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=5 June 2013 }}</ref> [[Albert Brooks]] joined the cast on 12 September to voice The Businessman, a villain.<ref>{{cite news |title=Albert Brooks lends voice to ''The Little Prince'' |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/09/albert-brooks-lends-voice-to-the-little-prince |access-date=15 September 2013 |newspaper=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=12 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThanks to Osborne's emotionally engaging pitch and the global popularity of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's book, a group of A-list actors were able to be recruited to lend their voices to the film's characters. As Osborne explained, \"It began with [[Jeff Bridges]]. He was our first and only choice to play the Aviator, so after a great deal of time trying to get to him, I finally got the chance to go to his home in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to talk to him directly. He was blown away by the pitch, and it really put us on the road to assembling the perfect cast.\" As Bridges recalls, he was instantly drawn to the role of the Aviator. \"Mark gave me this incredible pitch, brought this suitcase with him which showed me what the movie was going to be about. We shared the same concern, which was if you simply just move around these iconic characters like the book, it might not do justice to the work. He had this great other story, which treated the book as almost another character in the movie. It\u2019s a great way to pay tribute to this classic book, so I was excited and thrilled to be part of it.\"<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n\nIn the early stages of production, Mark Osborne's daughter Maddie and his son Riley, helped by providing the temporary scratch voices for the roles of the Little Girl and the Little Prince. His daughter got older and her voice began to change, so she had to be replaced by the 12-year-old [[Mackenzie Foy]]. Osborne's son Riley was kept as the voice of The Little Prince because they never found anyone who did a better job than him. \"He was 11 at the time, and was very  natural in the part so we kept him as the Prince!\", Osborne told.<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n  \nTo voice the complex role of the Little Girl's Mother, the film-makers approached [[Rachel McAdams]]. ''The Little Prince'' marks the first time McAdams has lent her voice to an animated project. \"I was so excited to be part of this movie, and I loved ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', so I knew our director Mark (Osborne) was going to do a wonderful job with the adaptation. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better introduction to animation.\" McAdams says it was important for her to connect with the material. \"I play the Little Girl's Mother, who is a working single mum. She has this massive, intricate life-plan for her daughter and wants her to follow the rules to a tee. The Mother is a little highly-strung, but she means well. She and her daughter are a real team until the Little Girl drifts away.\"<ref name=\"Production Notes\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe film's score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] (who had previously worked with Osborne on ''[[Kung Fu Panda (film)|Kung Fu Panda]]'') and [[Richard Harvey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/12/10/hans-zimmer-to-score-the-little-prince |title=Hans Zimmer to score ''The Little Prince'' |work=Film Music Reporter |date=10 December 2014 |access-date=10 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/the-little-prince-2015 |title=''The Little Prince'' Movie Information |work=soundtrack.net |access-date=17 August 2015 }}</ref> [[Camille (French singer)|Camille]] was featured in the film's soundtrack.\n[[Lily Allen]]\u2019s cover version of [[Keane (band)|Keane]]\u2019s \"[[Somewhere Only We Know]]\" appeared in the French trailer, but not featured in the soundtrack.\n\n==Release==\n===Premiere===\nThe film was chosen in 'Official Selection' for the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]] on 22 May 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=\"The Little Prince\" Cannes 2015 |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/c9482928-89ef-481d-a761-78d87cbc1347/year/2015.html |access-date=14 May 2015 |publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]] |date=14 May 2015 }}</ref> ''The Little Prince'' made its U.S. premiere at the [[Santa Barbara Film Festival]] on 3 February 2016.
