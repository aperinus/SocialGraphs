It is the third Musketeers film directed by [[Richard Lester]], following 1973's ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 live-action film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and 1974's ''[[The Four Musketeers (1974 film)|The Four Musketeers]]''. Like the other two films, the screenplay was written by [[George MacDonald Fraser]].\n\nThe character of Mordaunt, [[Milady de Winter]]'s son in the original novel, is replaced by Milady's daughter, called Justine de Winter.\n\nSeveral cast members from the first two reprised their roles in this one. [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]], who played [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] in the original films, has a cameo appearance as [[Cyrano de Bergerac]].\n\nWhile filming in September 1988, character actor [[Roy Kinnear]] died following an on-camera accident in which he fell off a horse. His role was completed by using a stand-in, filmed from the rear, and dubbed-in lines from a voice artist.\n\n==Plot==\nTwenty years after the events of ''The Four Musketeers'', [[Cardinal Mazarin]] has imprisoned the Duke of Beaufort. Mazarin hires d'Artagnan to bring together Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, to work for him. Porthos accepts, but Athos and Aramis decline. By this time, Athos has a son named Raoul.\n\nMilady de Winter's daughter, Justine, captures and questions the executioner that the musketeers hired to kill her mother. After finding out that \"Comte de la Fere\" hired him, she kills him. Raoul happens upon the aftermath of this event and chases after Justine, who is disguised as a priest. After a swordfight, when he discovers who she really is and her plan, Raoul leaves and tells d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Athos that Justine wants to kill them.\n\nComte de Rochefort is unable to prevent Beaufort from escaping from his prison, and he is subsequently arrested by Mazarin. Mazarin sends d'Artagnan and Porthos after Beaufort, but Beaufort escapes them due to interference from Athos and Aramis, who are working for Beaufort. This starts a fight amongst the Musketeers, in which d'Artagnan slices Aramis' hand. Aramis breaks his sword and rides away. d'Artagnan and Porthos are fired by Mazarin for not catching Beaufort.\n\nRochefort, who has survived his near-fatal clash with d'Artagnan in the previous film and has gone into hiding, finds Justine and tells her the names of d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis, revealing to her that the Comte de la Fere is Athos. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I of England]] is to be executed, so Queen Anne of Austria sends d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Raoul to rescue him. They attempt a rescue by knocking out the executioner, but Justine takes his place and beheads Charles.\n\nThe Musketeers have several encounters with Justine: in one, Raoul's true allegiance is revealed to her; in another, Justine and Rochefort attempt to kill the Musketeers by blowing up their ship. The Musketeers notice their trap, set their own bomb and escape. Rochefort is killed when the ship explodes, but Justine escapes.\n\nJustine attempts to kill King Louis XIV, but is stopped by the Musketeers, and their battle concludes with Justine jumping out of the window into the water. Aramis rejoins the Musketeers, and they force Mazarin to sign several forms in favour of them, including making Porthos a baron, Aramis a bishop, and Raoul being commissioned into the Guards. The film ends with the Musketeers riding together again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael York]] as [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|d'Artagnan]]\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as [[Athos (character)|Athos]]\n* [[Frank Finlay]] as [[Porthos]]\n* [[Richard Chamberlain]] as [[Aramis]]\n* [[C.

It reunited him with the main cast of the first two films.\n\nAuthor [[George MacDonald Fraser]] said that in the film \"Charles I is seen playing golf, which is, incidentally, true. He was playing golf just before he was captured.\"\n\nLester said the two main problems with the film were a lack of money, and a refusal of the Salkinds to let him use footage from the first two films. \"The whole concept of making Dumas' ''Twenty Years After'' was destroyed,\" said Lester. \"It was the hole beneath the water line.\"<ref>\n{{cite book|title=Getting Away With It: Or: The Further Adventures of the Luckiest Bastard You Ever Saw|url=https://archive.org/details/gettingawaywithi00sode|url-access=registration|last1=Soderbergh|first1= Steven|last2= Lester|first2= Richard|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/gettingawaywithi00sode/page/134 134]|publisher=Faber and Faber |isbn=0-571-19025-1}}</ref> However Lester did admit even that may not have worked as the target audience were unlikely to have been familiar with the original films.<ref>Soderberg p. 135.</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in Spain.\n\n[[Charlton Heston]] was hoping to be asked to reprise his role as [[Cardinal Richelieu]] from the original films but the cardinal had died several years before the events of the new movie. Heston did give the filmmakers permission to use a painting of Richelieu that featured his likeness\u2014provided he was given the painting once filming ending. \"It's a good portrait,\" wrote Heston. \"I'm very fond of it. It's very much in the style of the period.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Heston|first1= Charlton|last2= Isbouts|first2= Jean-Pierre|author-link2=Jean-Pierre Isbouts|title=Charlton Heston's Hollywood: 50 Years in American Film|year=1998 |publisher=GT Publ|page=175|isbn=1-57719-357-1}}</ref>\n\n===Death of Roy Kinnear===\n[[Roy Kinnear]] was accidentally killed during production in [[Toledo, Spain]]. The Spanish crew misunderstood the instructions of director Lester and washed down the cobblestone street prior to filming, making the stones wet. Kinnear and other cast members had to travel on horses across the [[Alc\u00e1ntara Bridge]] above the river [[Tagus]]. Kinnear was given one fifteen-minute practice ride before the take.\n\nWhen Kinnear and other cast members rode into the shot on horses and stopped, Kinnear's horse slipped, and Kinnear (not a confident horseman) fell off, [[pelvic fracture|breaking his pelvis]]. He was treated at the Ruber Internacional Hospital in Madrid and on 20 September was transferred to a nearby clinic but died soon after from a heart attack brought on by his injuries.<ref>{{cite news| last=Heller Anderson|first=Susan | title=Roy Kinnear Is Dead At 54 After Falling From Horse in Film | work=The New York Times | date=1988-09-23 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/23/obituaries/roy-kinnear-is-dead-at-54-after-falling-from-horse-in-film.html | access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a six-year legal battle Kinnear's widow was awarded \u00a3650,000 in damages from the production company, Falconfilms\u2014consisting of producer Pierre Spengler and director [[Richard Lester]].<ref name=\"Teleg\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3670797/Rory-Kinnear-becoming-an-actor-was-a-way-of-getting-to-know-my-father-better.html|title=Rory Kinnear: becoming an actor was a way of getting to know my father better|work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=21 May 2008 | first=John | last=Preston | date=27 January 2008}}</ref> A court later ruled that the hospital was 60% liable for his death and ordered them to pay 60% of the payout figure.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/remembering-roy-kinnear-charming-screen-presence-100821031.html | title=Remembering Roy Kinnear: A charming screen presence whose life was cut tragically short }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nCompleted in 1988, ''The Return of the Musketeers'' was released for cinemas in the European market in April 1989, and while it was given positive reviews by the critics, it was not well received at the box office. It was released on video in the spring of 1990. The film was acquired by Universal for U.S. theatrical release, but given its lackluster European box office, the studio chose instead to give the film its U.S. debut on cable television's [[USA Network]] (which was part owned by the studio) two years later, on 3 April 1991.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zCgxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MwcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1483,1798900&dq=return+of+the+musketeers&hl=en|last=Burlingame|first=Jon|title=Tune in Tonight: It's CBS's turn to honor the troops|date=3 April 1991|access-date=2 April 2011|work=[[Star-Banner|Ocala Star-Banner]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|page=9C}}</ref>\n\nYears later in a career interview Lester said, \"I really won't talk about ''The Return of the Musketeers''...I never have and I won't now.
