The film stars [[Owen Wilson]], [[Adrien Brody]], and Schwartzman as three estranged brothers who agree to meet in [[India]] a year after their father's funeral for a \"spiritual journey\" aboard a [[luxury train]]. The cast also includes [[Waris Ahluwalia]], [[Amara Karan]], [[Barbet Schroeder]], and [[Anjelica Huston]], with [[Natalie Portman]], [[Camilla Rutherford]], [[Irrfan Khan]], and [[Bill Murray]] in [[cameo roles]].\n\nThe film was released on October 26, 2007 by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics and earned $35 million on a $17.5 million budget.<ref name=rose/> The film premiered at the [[64th Venice International Film Festival]] in competition for the [[Golden Lion]] and was named among the Top Films of the Year at the 2007 [[New York Film Critics Online|NYFCO Award]]s.\n\nAnderson's ''[[Hotel Chevalier]]'', starring Schwartzman and Portman, acts as a [[prologue]] to the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[India]], a businessman fails to catch his train, \"The [[Darjeeling]] [[limited express|Limited]]\", as it pulls out of a station; he is beaten to it by a younger man, Peter Whitman. Peter reunites with his brothers Francis and Jack on board, the three having not seen each other since their father's funeral a year earlier.\n\nFrancis, the oldest, has recently survived a near-fatal [[motorcycle]] accident, leaving his face and head covered in bandages; he thus wishes to reconcile with his brothers on a journey of spiritual self-discovery. He is also covertly searching for their mother Patricia, whom the brothers have not seen in many years. With the help of his assistant Brendan, Francis draws up a strict itinerary for the trip and confiscates his brothers' passports to prevent them from getting off the train too early. The brothers also continue to grieve over their father's death: all three carry many items of luggage marked with his initials, along with other personal items that belonged to him.\n\nThe train takes the brothers through the countryside and to various [[Hindu]] temples, though tension builds as Peter, and Jack, the youngest, become infuriated with Francis' controlling behavior. Francis eventually reveals that they will be meeting with their mother, who has become a [[nun]] living at a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[convent]] in the [[Himalayas]]. Peter and Jack are angry; Peter knows they would not have come if they had been told this earlier. The atmosphere finally comes to a head, and the brothers have a physical altercation on the train, distressing the other passengers. The Chief Steward, whom the brothers have repeatedly wronged, has them thrown off with all their luggage. Brendan subsequently quits and returns to the train after giving the boys a letter from their mother; its contents imply that she does not want to see them. The brothers thus decide to leave India, go their separate ways, and never return.\n\nAfter hiking through the wilderness, the brothers see three young boys fall into a [[river]] while attempting to pull a raft across it. Jack and Francis rescue two of the boys, but Peter fails to save the third, who dies. They carry the body back to the boys' village, where they spend the night and are treated kindly. They attend the funeral the next day and experience a repressed [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]: accompanied by Alice, Peter's wife, the brothers are shown heading to their father's funeral, and then stopping to pick up his [[Porsche]] from the repair shop, even though the car is not ready. It is revealed that their father's death was a result of his being hit by a taxi, and that their mother did not attend the funeral.\n\nBack in the present, the brothers arrive at the airport, but they suddenly decide to rip up their tickets and go visit their mother. They reach the convent, where their mother Patricia is surprised but overjoyed to see them, and Francis coyly admits that his accident was actually a [[suicide attempt]]. That night, after the brothers confront Patricia for abandoning them, the family gathers together in silence, and reconnects in love. The brothers awake the next morning to find their mother gone, leaving them their breakfast. They decide not to wait for her to return.\n\nAt the train station, the brothers run for another train, the \"[[Bengal]] [[Lancer]]\", and gleefully discard all their father's suitcases and bags to catch it. On board, Francis offers to return Peter and Jack their passports, but is told instead to hold onto them. Francis says, \"Let's go get a drink, and smoke a cigarette\", and the brothers leave their compartment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Francis\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Peter\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Jack\n* [[Amara Karan]] as Rita\n* [[Wallace Wolodarsky]] as Brendan \n* [[Waris Ahluwalia]] as The Chief Steward\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as The Father\n* [[Barbet Schroeder]] as The Mechanic\n* [[Camilla Rutherford]] as Alice\n* [[Bill Murray]] as The Businessman\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Patricia\n* [[Kumar Pallana]] as Old Man\n* Gurdeep Singh as Chief Steward - Bengal Lancer\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Rhett\n}}\n\n==Locations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2022}}\nMuch of the film was shot in [[Jodhpur]], [[Rajasthan]].
