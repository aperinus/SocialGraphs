Feldman]], [[Sigurj\u00f3n Sighvatsson|Sigurjon Sighvatsson]], Christine Whitaker and Matthias Deyle with screenplay by Christopher Kyle. An international production of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, the film takes place in 1961 and focuses its story on the Soviet [[Hotel-class submarine]] ''[[Soviet submarine K-19|K-19]]''.\n\nThe film stars [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Liam Neeson]] alongside [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Donald Sumpter]], [[Christian Camargo]], [[Michael Gladis]] and [[John Shrapnel]] in supporting roles.\n\n''K-19: The Widowmaker'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on July 19, 2002 in the United States while on September 5, 2002 in Germany and October 25, 2002 in the United Kingdom. Upon release, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics, which particularly praised the performances and the dramatic atmosphere but criticized the screenwriting. The film became a [[box-office bomb]] grossing $65 million against a production budget of $90 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1961, the [[Soviet Union]] launches its first ballistic missile [[nuclear submarine]], the [[Soviet submarine K-19|''K-19'']], commanded by Captain Alexei Vostrikov, with [[executive officer]] Mikhail Polenin, the crew's original captain. Vostrikov is alleged to have been appointed through his wife's political connections, as well as Polenin's tendency to put crew morale and safety before Soviet pride. Discovering the reactor officer drunk and asleep on duty, Vostrikov fires him, receiving a replacement, Vadim Radtchenko, fresh from the academy. The launch is plagued by misfortune; the medical officer is killed by a truck and the inaugural bottle of champagne fails to break on the bow.\n\nThe ''K-19''{{'}}s first mission is to surface in the Arctic, test-fire an unarmed [[intercontinental ballistic missile]], and patrol the Atlantic within striking range of [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] Vostrikov orders ''K-19'' to submerge past its maximum operational depth, then surface at full-speed to break through the Arctic pack-ice. Protesting the dangerous maneuver, Polenin storms off the bridge. The test missile launches successfully.\n\nA [[Nuclear reactor#Cooling|reactor coolant]] pipe bursts. Control rods are inserted into the reactor, but the temperature rises; back-up coolant systems were not installed. ''K-19'' surfaces to contact fleet command but the long-range transmitter antenna cable is damaged. Engineers rig a makeshift coolant system, working in shifts to limit radiation exposure. The first team emerges vomiting and blistered. The second and third teams cool the reactor, but all suffer [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]]. With radiation levels rising, the submarine surfaces and most of the crew are ordered topside. Radtchenko balks after seeing the first team's injuries, and the [[Glavny starshina|crew chief]] takes his place on the third team.\n\nA [[Sikorsky H-34]] helicopter from a nearby [[United States Navy]] [[destroyer]] offers assistance, which Vostrikov rejects. The Soviet government grows concerned when the ''K-19'' ceases contact but is spotted near the destroyer. Hoping diesel submarines will be sent to tow the ''K-19'', Vostrikov orders a return to port. The repaired pipework leaks causing the reactor temperature to raise. Torpedo fuel ignites a fire. Initially ordering the fire suppression system activated \u2013 which would suffocate anyone in the area \u2013 Vostrikov is talked down by Polenin, who personally assists the fire crew. Two officers mutiny against Vostrikov and Radtchenko enters the reactor alone to attempt repairs.\n\nPolenin deceives the mutineers into handing over their weapons, arrests them, and frees Vostrikov. Unaware of Radtchenko, Vostrikov, at Polenin's behest, announces his plan to dive and attempt another repair, fearing an overheating reactor could set off their warheads and incite nuclear war. The crew responds positively, and ''K-19'' dives. Radtchenko's repairs are successful. Blinded and weakened by the radiation, he is dragged to safety by Vostrikov. A meltdown is prevented, but irradiated steam leaks throughout the submarine.\n\nA Soviet diesel submarine reaches ''K-19'', with orders to confine the crew aboard until a freighter can pick them up. Vostrikov instead orders an evacuation. Returning to the Soviet Union, Vostrikov is tried for endangering the mission and disobeying a direct order, but Polenin comes to his defense. In all, twenty seven men died from radiation sickness.\n\nIn 1989, an aged Vostrikov meets Polenin and other survivors at a cemetery on the anniversary of their rescue. Vostrikov reveals that he nominated the deceased crewmen for the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] award, but was told the honor was reserved for combat veterans. Remarking \"what good are honors from such people,\" Vostrikov toasts the survivors and those who sacrificed their lives.\n\nAn epilogue reveals Vostrikov was acquitted, but the ''K-19'' crew was sworn to secrecy and Vostrikov was never again given a command.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Nikolai Vladimirovich Zateyev|Captain 2nd Rank Alexei Vostrikov]], Commanding Officer\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Vasily Arkhipov (vice admiral)|Captain 3rd Rank Mikhail \"Misha\" Polenin]], Executive Officer\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as Lieutenant Vadim Radtchenko, Reactor Officer\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as Marshal Zolentsov, [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Defence Minister]]\n* [[John Shrapnel]] as Admiral Bratyeev\n* [[Donald Sumpter]] as Captain 3rd Rank Gennadi Savran, Medical Officer\n* [[Tim Woodward]] as Vice-Admiral Konstantin Partonov\n* Steve Nicolson as Captain 3rd Rank Yuri Demichev, Torpedo Officer\n* [[Ravil Isyanov]] as Captain 3rd Rank Igor Suslov, Political Officer\n* [[Christian Camargo]] as Petty Officer Pavel Loktev, Senior Reactor Technician\n* George Anton as Captain-Lieutenant Konstantin Poliansky, Missile Officer\n* [[James Francis Ginty]] as Seaman Anatoly Subachev, Reactor Technician\n* [[Lex Shrapnel]] as Captain-Lieutenant Mikhail Kornilov, Communications Officer\n* [[Ingvar Eggert Sigur\u00f0sson]] as Captain 3rd Rank Viktor Gorelov, Chief Engineer\n* [[Sam Spruell]] as Senior Seaman Dmitri Nevsky\n* Sam Redford as Petty Officer 2nd Class Vasily Mishin\n* [[Peter Stebbings]] as Kuryshev\n* [[Shaun Benson]] as Chief Petty Officer Leonid Pashinski\n* [[Kristen Holden-Ried]] as Captain-Lieutenant Anton Malahov\n* [[Dmitry Chepovetsky]] as Sergei Maximov\n* [[Tygh Runyan]] as Petty Officer 1st Class Maxim Portenko, Sonar Operator\n* [[Jacob Pitts]] as Grigori\n* [[Michael Gladis]] as Senior Seaman Yevgeny Borzenkov\n* [[JJ Feild]] as Andrei Pritoola\n* [[Peter Oldring]] as Vanya Belov\n* [[Joshua Close]] as Viktor\n* [[Jeremy Akerman]] as Fyodor Tsetkov, Captain of the ''S-270''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''K-19: The Widowmaker'' cost $100 million to produce,<ref name = \"dvdmg\">[http://www.dvdmg.com/k19.shtml \"K-19: The Widowmaker (2002).\"] ''DVDmg.com'', March 14, 2009.
