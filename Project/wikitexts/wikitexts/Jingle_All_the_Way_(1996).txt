It stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]] as two rival fathers, mattress salesman Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) and postal worker Myron Larabee (Sinbad), both desperately trying to purchase a Turbo-Man action figure for their respective sons on a last-minute shopping spree on [[Christmas Eve]]. The film's title is borrowed from the lyrics of the popular Christmas song \"[[Jingle Bells]]\".\n\nInspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for such items as [[Cabbage Patch Kids]], the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the [[Economics of Christmas|commercialization of Christmas]], and the project was picked up by [[20th Century Fox]]. Delays to Fox's reboot of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad instead of [[Joe Pesci]] as Myron. ''Jingle All the Way'' was set and filmed in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] of [[Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] at a variety of locations, including the [[Mall of America]]. After five weeks filming, production moved to [[California]] where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.\n\nUpon release, ''Jingle All the Way'' grossed $129&nbsp;million worldwide and received generally negative reviews from critics. In 2001, Fox was ordered to pay $19&nbsp;million to Murray Hill Publishing for stealing the idea for the film; the verdict was overturned three years later. ''Jingle All the Way'' is the third and final collaboration between Sinbad and [[Phil Hartman]] after ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' (1993) and ''[[Houseguest]]'' (1995), and the last film featuring Hartman to be released during his lifetime before his death in 1998. In 2014, the film was followed by a sequel in name only, ''[[Jingle All the Way 2]]'', starring [[Larry the Cable Guy]].\n\n==Plot==\nWorkaholic [[Minneapolis]] mattress salesman Howard Langston loves his wife, Liz, and nine-year-old son, Jamie, but is unable to find time for his family and often put in a bad light by his neighbor, divorc\u00e9 Ted Maltin, who harbors unrequited feelings for Liz. After missing Jamie's [[Karate|karate]] class graduation, Howard resolves to redeem himself by fulfilling Jamie's Christmas wish of an action figure of Turbo-Man, a popular television superhero, despite Liz actually having asked him to buy one two weeks earlier, which Howard forgot about. On Christmas Eve, Howard sets out to buy the toy, but finds that every store has sold out, and in the process develops a rivalry with Myron Larabee, a postal worker father with the same ambition.\n\nIn desperation, Howard attempts to buy a figure from a counterfeit toy brand run by con men dressed in Santa suits, which results in a massive fight in the warehouse that is broken up when the police arrive. Howard narrowly escapes arrest by posing as an undercover officer. Exhausted at his failure and out of fuel, Howard goes to [[Mickey's Diner]] and calls home, intending to tell his wife the truth. Jamie answers the phone but keeps reminding Howard of his promise to be home in time for the annual Holiday Wintertainment Parade. Losing his patience, Howard yells at Jamie, after which he feels guilty and depressed after Jamie scolds him for not keeping his promises. Howard finds Myron at the diner and they share their experiences over coffee, where Myron tells Howard of his resentment towards his own father for failing to get him a [[Johnny Seven OMA]] for Christmas. A radio station advertises a competition for a Turbo-Man doll. The ensuing fight between Howard and Myron results in the diner's phone getting damaged, forcing Howard and Myron to race to the radio station on foot, where the DJ tells them that the competition was actually for a Turbo-Man gift certificate. The police are alerted, but Howard and Myron escape after Myron threatens the officers with a seemingly phony letter bomb. Officer Alexander Hummell, whom Howard has run into twice already, investigates the package only to have it detonate much to the men's shock.\n\nUpon returning to his [[GMC Suburban|Suburban]], Howard finds it stripped by car thieves, with \"Meri xmAS\" spray-painted on the windshield.  He returns home in a tow truck only to find Ted putting the star on his Christmas tree. In retaliation, Howard attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll Ted bought for his son, Johnny, but can't bring himself to steal from a child. Unfortunately, he is caught in the act and left alone while his family goes to the Christmas parade with Ted. After letting Jamie and Johnny out of the car, Ted attempts to seduce Liz, but she violently rejects him by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog that Ted offered to her. Meanwhile, remembering his promise to Jamie to go to the parade, Howard decides to attend as well, but runs into Hummell again. The ensuing chase leads to Howard hiding inside a storage room, where he is mistaken for the actor portraying Turbo-Man and dressed in the highly technological costume. As Turbo-Man, Howard uses his chance to present a limited-edition action figure to Jamie, but they are confronted by Myron, dressed as Turbo-Man's enemy, Dementor having bound and gagged the original actor. Despite Howard's pleas for Myron to stop, a long chase ensues, involving a [[jetpack]] flight. Myron acquires the toy from Jamie but is cornered by police officers, while Howard saves his son. Howard reveals himself to his family and apologizes for his shortcomings. The police return the toy to Jamie as Myron is arrested, but Jamie decides to give the toy to Myron for his son, proclaiming his father as his true hero. The crowd carries Howard away in celebration, while Myron, Liz and Jamie look on happily.\n\nLater that night, Howard finishes decorating their Christmas tree by putting the star on top. However, when Liz asks Howard what he got for her, he shockingly realizes that he forgot to get her a gift.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Howard Langston / Turbo-Man\n* [[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]] as Myron Larabee\n* [[Phil Hartman]] as Ted Maltin\n* [[Rita Wilson]] as Liz Langston\n* [[Jake Lloyd]] as Jamie Langston\n* [[Robert Conrad]] as Officer Alexander Hummell\n* [[Martin Mull]] as  a [[KQRS-FM|KQRS]] D.J.

only six and a half months were available for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5-inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured.<ref name=toys/><ref name=colum/> Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as ''[[Space Jam]]'' and ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]''.<ref name=satire/> The film's release coincided with the [[Tickle Me Elmo]] craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.\nThe world premiere was held on November 16, 1996, at the [[Mall of America]] in Bloomington where parts of the film were shot. A day of events was held to celebrate the film's release and Schwarzenegger donated memorabilia from the film to the Mall's [[Planet Hollywood]].<ref name=prem>{{cite news|title=Arnold Plans Visit With 'Jingle' On Nov. 16| last= Hewitt |first= Chris|date=November 7, 1996|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|page=1D}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[VHS]] in October 1997,<ref>{{cite news|title=What's New|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=September 5, 1997|page=11}}</ref> and in November 1998 it was released on [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Paramount, Fox Entering DVD Market|work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|date=August 27, 1998| last= Kelley |first= Bill|page=E3}}</ref> It was rereleased on DVD in December 2004,<ref name=ign/> followed by an extended director's cut in October 2007, known as the \"Family Fun Edition\".
