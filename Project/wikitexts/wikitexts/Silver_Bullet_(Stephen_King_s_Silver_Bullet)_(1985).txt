It stars [[Gary Busey]], [[Everett McGill]], and [[Corey Haim]], with [[Megan Follows]], [[Terry O'Quinn]], [[Lawrence Tierney]], [[Bill Smitrovich]], [[Kent Broadhurst]], [[David Hart (actor)|David Hart]], and [[James Gammon]] in supporting roles. The film is directed by [[Dan Attias]], written by King and produced by [[Martha De Laurentiis]]. The film is now considered a cult classic.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe rocky relationship between Jane Coslaw, the film's narrator, and her paraplegic younger brother Marty changes after a series of murders in their small rural town of Tarker's Mills, Maine, starting in the spring of 1976.\n\nRailroad worker Arnie Westrum is decapitated by an unseen attacker, pregnant Stella Randolph prepares to kill herself but is brutally murdered in her own bedroom, an abusive father is killed in his greenhouse, and Marty's best friend, Brady Kincaid, is also killed. After Brady's death, citizens form a vigilante justice group.  Although local Sheriff Joe Haller attempts to stop the citizens, he relents after Brady's father Herb berates him. Reverend Lester Lowe fails to dissuade the townsfolk from causing further bloodshed.\n\nWhile the vigilantes hunt for the killer in the nearby woods, three are attacked and killed. The survivors - especially Andy Fairton - later deny seeing anything unusual. Afterwards, Reverend Lowe dreams that he is presiding over a mass funeral when his congregation{{snd}}including the bodies in the caskets{{snd}}begins to transform into werewolves before his eyes and attack him. He awakens screaming and asks God to \"let it end.\"\n\nBecause of the mounting unsolved murders, curfews are put in place, canceling the town\u2019s Fourth of July celebration. The Coslaws decide to have their own backyard party and invite their mother Nan's alcoholic brother, Red. Red gives Marty a custom-built wheelchair/motorcycle, which he nicknames the \"Silver Bullet,\" as well as a pile of fireworks so he can have his own celebration. Marty uses the Silver Bullet to go out in the middle of the night to a bridge where he lights the fireworks. The fireworks get the werewolf's attention, and it confronts him, but he escapes after launching a rocket into the creature's eye.\n\nMarty enlists Jane's help to look for someone with a newly injured or missing eye. She discovers that Reverend Lowe is missing his left eye. Realizing that no adult would believe his story, Marty begins sending anonymous notes to Reverend Lowe telling him that he knows who he is, what he is, and that he should commit suicide in order to stop the killings. Lowe tries to run Marty off the road with his car. When Marty is trapped under a closed covered bridge, Lowe, whose condition has fractured his sanity, tries to rationalize the murders he has committed as doing God's work. Lowe apologizes and moves in for the kill until Marty calls for help from a passerby.\n\nThe siblings manage to convince Red that Lowe is connected to the murders and attempted to kill Marty. Red persuades Sheriff Haller to investigate. That night, Haller, still skeptical but desperate to find the killer, goes to Lowe's house and finds Lowe has locked himself in his garage to restrain himself from further killings. Before Haller can arrest him, Lowe transforms and bludgeons Haller to death with a baseball bat.\n\nKnowing the werewolf is coming for them next, Marty and Jane convince Red to take Jane's silver cross and Marty's silver medallion to the gunsmith, who melts them down into a silver bullet.\n\nOn the night of the full moon, they wait for the werewolf, who cuts the power to the house and smashes its way inside, attacking Red. The bullet is nearly lost in the melee, but Marty is able to retrieve it and shoots the werewolf in the right eye. The corpse turns back into Lowe before dying. As the trio recover, Marty and Jane say they love each other and embrace, and Jane narrates that although she hadn't always been able to say it, she was able to say it from then on.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Gary Busey]] as Uncle Red\n*[[Everett McGill]] as Reverend Lowe\n*[[Corey Haim]] as [[Cycle of the Werewolf#The Coslaw family|Marty Coslaw]]\n*[[Megan Follows]] as Jane Coslaw\n*[[Terry O'Quinn]] as Sheriff Joe Haller\n*[[Bill Smitrovich]] as Andy Fairton\n*Robin Groves as Nan Coslaw\n*[[Lawrence Tierney]] as Owen Knopfler\n*[[Kent Broadhurst]] as Herb Kincaid\n}}\n\nIn addition, Joe Wright plays Brady Kincaid, Marty's best friend, while [[Tovah Feldshuh]] provides the narration as the voice of the adult Jane.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot around [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].<ref name=\"Corey\">{{cite news |last1=Corey |first1=Joe |title=Blu-ray Review: Stephen King's Silver Bullet {{!}} Inside Pulse |url=https://insidepulse.com/2019/12/19/blu-ray-review-stephen-kings-silver-bullet/ |access-date=19 June 2021 |date=19 December 2019}}</ref> Filming began in October 1984 and took about {{frac|2|1|2}} months to complete, finishing shortly before Christmas. In the novella, the werewolf was said to snarl in nearly human words and the werewolf was supposed to speak in the original screenplay, although this was eliminated after a rewrite. [[Gary Busey]] felt a certain kinship with the Uncle Red character and was allowed to ad lib all of his lines in certain takes of each scene in which he appeared.  Although he read the lines as scripted in most of the takes, [[Stephen King]] and [[Daniel Attias]] liked the ad lib scenes better and decided to include most of Busey's ad lib scenes in the final cut of the film.<ref name=\"Corey\"/>\n\nKing asked for the werewolf to be plain, and hard to see, in contrast to the hulking monsters seen in other werewolf films and books in the early to mid-1980s, with the end result being a creature which looked more like a [[American black bear|black bear]] than anything else and did not really have any identifying characteristics.  After seeing [[Carlo Rambaldi]]'s design, per King's request, producer [[Dino de Laurentiis]] was very unhappy and demanded a change, which both King and Rambaldi refused.  Eventually pre-production fell behind schedule and director [[Don Coscarelli]] opted to start filming the non-werewolf scenes without knowing what would happen with the werewolf suit.  After completing the non-werewolf scenes and not having any clear picture about what would happen with the film Coscarelli resigned as director and was replaced with Attias.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Michael |title=Stephen King: Why Silver Bullet's Original Director Quit The Movie |url=https://screenrant.com/sillver-bullet-movie-director-don-coscarelli-quit-stephen-king/ |access-date=19 June 2021 |work=ScreenRant |date=2020-12-14}}</ref> When pressured to either cancel the film or accept the design de Laurentiis relented and allowed filming to continue with Rambaldi's werewolf suit. A modern dance actor was hired to perform the stunts inside the suit but de Laurentiis was also unhappy with his performance and demanded a change. As a result, [[Everett McGill]], who played Reverend Lester Lowe in human form, wound up acting out most of the scenes in the werewolf suit and was credited with a dual role.<ref name=\"Corey\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Silver Bullet'' was released theatrically in the [[United States]] by [[Paramount Pictures]] in October 1985.
