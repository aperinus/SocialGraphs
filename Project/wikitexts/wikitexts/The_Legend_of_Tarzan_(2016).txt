The film premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] on June 29, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 1, 2016 in 2D, [[3D movie|3D]], and [[IMAX]], by [[Warner Bros.

Five years later, Leopold has accrued massive debts in exploiting the resources of the [[Congo Free State]], and sends his envoy [[L\u00e9on Rom]] to secure the fabled diamonds of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]]. Rom's expedition is massacred by warriors led by Chief Mbonga, who offers Rom diamonds in exchange for [[Tarzan]].\n\nThe man once called \"Tarzan\", [[The Right Honourable|The Rt Hon.]] [[Tarzan|John Clayton]], [[Earl]] of Greystoke, has left Africa for his ancestral estate in Britain with his American wife, [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and embraced life as a wealthy [[nobleman]]. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] offers Lord Greystoke an invitation from Leopold to visit [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]]. The Prime Minister and an American envoy, [[George Washington Williams]], explain that Leopold is defaulting on his loans, and a visit from Greystoke \u2013 whose exploits as Tarzan have made him a celebrity \u2013 would secure Britain's influence in [[Congo Free State|the Congo]], but Greystoke refuses. George reveals to John, Lord Greystoke, his suspicions that Leopold is enslaving the Congolese population, and persuades John to go to the Congo to discover the truth. When he arrives back to at Greystoke Manor, a flashback reveals the deaths of John's parents after their shipwreck in Africa, and his adoption by the great apes called the [[Mangani]]. In Greystoke [[country house]], Jane is telling visiting children a story. After a fight with Jane that evening, John has a flashback to when he was 5 years old playing in the treehouse with his ape foster mother, [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] and foster brother, Akut, and then is chased by Alpha Male [[Kerchak]].\n\nJohn, Jane, and George journey to the Congo, circumventing Rom and his corrupt financier Mr. Frum, and are welcomed by the [[Waziri (fictional tribe)|Kuba]] village of John and Jane's youth. Jane tells George of John's life with the Mangani, and how she first met him. Rom and his men capture the villagers, killing Chief Muviro, and taking Wasimbu along with other able young men to serve as porters. George rescues John, but Jane and the captive villagers are taken aboard Rom's steamship. Rom reveals to Jane that he arranged John's invitation from Leopold to deliver him to Mbonga. Pursuing the steamship, John, George, and the village's remaining warriors seize a train carrying Belgian soldiers and enslaved Congolese. An engineer informs them of Rom's plan to take over the Congo, sanctioned by Leopold: using slave labor, Rom has built forts across the region, linked by railway and river travel, for an army of 20,000 mercenaries soon to arrive. With Leopold bankrupt, Rom needs the diamonds of Opar to pay for the army.\n\nFinding documents that will expose Leopold, John and George leave the proof with the Kuba warriors and rescued slaves to deliver to Boma, and the pair continue on through Mangani territory. Confronted by the apes, John is forced to fight their leader, his foster brother Akut. John loses, but he and George are permitted to travel on. Jane and Wasimbu escape the steamship and flee into the jungle. Jane sends Wasimbu off to rally the other tribes, knowing Rom's men will follow her. Jane encounters the Mangani, and Rom's men open fire on the apes. John arrives, saving the surviving Mangani, and pursues Rom, who takes Jane to Mbonga's tribe. It is revealed that years ago, Mbonga's son was killed by John for killing John's foster mother, [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]]. Mbonga attacks John, who gains the upper hand but spares the chief. George and the Mangani arrive, and he and John convince Mbonga that Rom is their common enemy.\n\nRom takes Jane (who is about to be sold as a slave) and the diamonds to Boma, where the mercenary army approaches shore. John and George send a massive stampede of wildebeest through the town, overrunning Rom's men, as the Kuba warriors arrive by train and free their families. John rescues Jane and pursues Rom, who prepares to deliver the diamonds to Frum and the mercenaries. Williams sinks Rom's steamship, but Rom strangles John with his [[rosary]]. Using a mating call to summon crocodiles, John breaks free and leaves Rom to be devoured by the crocodiles, escaping as the vessel's boiler explodes. Frum and the fleet of mercenaries depart. George returns to London and presents the prime minister with an open letter to Leopold exposing the slavery and abuses of the Congolese people. One year later, John and Jane have relocated to Africa, in Jane's father's old house. They celebrate the birth of their son, and John returns to the great apes as Tarzan.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Tarzan|John Clayton III, 5th Earl of Greystoke/Tarzan]].<ref name=\"Alexander\" /> On his character Tarzan, Skarsg\u00e5rd said, \"This is about a man who\u2019s holding back; and slowly, as you peel off the layers, he reverts back to a more animalistic state and lets that side of his personality out.\"<ref name=\"USAT\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/12/08/legend-of-tarzan-movie-sneak-peek-exclusive/76932268/|title=Sneak peek: 'Tarzan' puts a twist on a legend|first=Brian|last=Truitt|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 5, 2015|access-date=December 9, 2015}}</ref> To get in Tarzan shape, Skarsg\u00e5rd spent 4 months in a training regimen before filming started and gained 24 pounds.<ref name=\"USAT\"/><ref name=\"NYTimess\"/> Part of his training was for movement work with [[choreographer]] Wayne McGregor.<ref name=\"NYTimess\">{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/movies/alexander-skarsgard-of-sound-mind-and-body-to-play-tarzan.html|title=Alexander Skarsgard, of Sound Mind and Body to Play Tarzan|first=Kurt|last=Iswarienko|work=[[New York Times]]|date=June 23, 2016|access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/articles/how-alexander-skarsgard-got-tarzan-fit-w210732|title=How Alexander Skarsgard Got 'Tarzan' Fit|date=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n** [[Rory J.
