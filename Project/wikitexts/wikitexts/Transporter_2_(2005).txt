Written by [[Robert Mark Kamen]] and co-producer [[Luc Besson]], it is the [[sequel]] to ''[[The Transporter]]'' (2002), as well as the second installment of ''[[Transporter (film series)|Transporter]]'' trilogy. The film stars [[Jason Statham]], [[Alessandro Gassman]], [[Amber Valletta]], [[Kate Nauta]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]], [[Matthew Modine]], and [[Jason Flemyng]]. Both Statham and Berl\u00e9and reprise their roles as [[Frank Martin (Transporter)|Frank Martin]] and Inspector Tarconi, respectively. In the story, Frank [[chauffeur]]s a young boy from [[Miami, Florida]], who is soon kidnapped and tries to rescue him. The film was followed by ''[[Transporter 3]]'' which was released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nFrank Martin has relocated from southern France to [[Miami, Florida]]. As a favor to a friend, he becomes a temporary chauffeur for the wealthy Billings family. Frank bonds with their son, Jack, whom he drives to and from elementary school in his new [[Audi A8#Innovations|Audi A8 W12]]. The marriage of Jefferson and Audrey Billings is under great strain due to the demands of his high-profile government job. This leads Audrey to seek solace in Frank, one time getting somewhat drunk and attempting to seduce him, but he tactfully sends her home.\n\nFrank prepares for the arrival of Inspector Tarconi, his detective friend from France, who has come to spend his holiday in Florida with Frank. When Frank takes Jack for a medical checkup, he realizes barely in time that impostors have killed, and masqueraded as, the doctor and receptionist. A lengthy fight erupts between thugs, led by Lola, and the unarmed Frank; Frank manages to escape with Jack. Just as they arrive at Jack's house, he receives a phone call, informing him that he and Jack are in the sights of a sniper capable of penetrating the car's bulletproof glass. Forced at gunpoint to let Lola into the car, Frank speeds away with Jack, evading many pursuing police cars.\n\nThey arrive at a warehouse, where Frank meets Gianni Chellini, the ringleader of the operation. Frank is ordered to leave without Jack. He discovers an explosive attached to the car and succeeds in removing it a split-second prior to detonation. Jack is returned to his family after the payment of a ransom, but unknown to them and Frank, Jack has been injected with a deadly virus that will eventually kill anyone whom the child breathes on.\n\nSuspected by everyone except Audrey of being one of the kidnappers, Frank tracks down the remaining fake doctor, Dimitri, with Tarconi's assistance. Frank infects Dimitri with the same virus, then lets him escape. Dimitri panics and hurries to a lab to get the cure, with Frank following behind. In his panic, Dimitri kills Tipov, another of Gianni's men, in his attempt to force the scientist in charge of the lab to give him the cure. Frank arrives and kills first another henchman, then Dimitri (after revealing that Dimitri was not infected after all); but when Frank refuses to bargain with him, the scientist hurls the only two vials containing the antidote out of the window into traffic. Frank manages to retrieve only one vial intact.\n\nFrank sneaks back into the Billings home and tells an already ailing Audrey what is happening. He uses the antidote on Jack. Meanwhile, a coughing Jefferson, the director of National Drug Control Policy, addresses the heads of many anti-drug organizations from around the world at a conference; infecting all of them in the process.\n\nFrank drives to Gianni's home, and finds that Gianni has decided to inject himself with the remaining supply of antidote as a precaution. After dispatching Gianni's many henchmen, Frank has the archvillain at gunpoint. Gianni explains that a Colombian drug cartel is paying him to get rid of its enemies; and that Frank cannot risk killing him, for his death would render the antidote unusable. An armed Lola shows up, leading to a standoff. Gianni leaves Lola to deal with Frank; which results in Frank killing her by impaling her on a [[wine rack]] with sharp metal points.\n\nFrank tracks Gianni, who is making an escape in his helicopter to a waiting jet. Using a [[Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster]] from Gianni's garage, Frank speeds to the airport and boards Gianni's jet by driving onto the runway and climbing onto the jet's nose gear. After killing the co-pilot Frank gets into the interior of the plane and confronts Gianni, who pulls a gun on him. When they wrestle for it, a wild shot kills the pilot and the plane crash-lands in the ocean. Frank incapacitates Gianni, rendering him immobile while preserving the antidote in his system, then pushes his captive and himself out of the sinking plane. Boats converge to pick them up.\n\nThe Billings are given the antidote. When Frank visits them in the hospital, before entering their room, he sees them with Jack, who is joking with them. He silently walks back to his car, where Tarconi is waiting. He drops his friend at the airport. Alone, Frank receives a call from a man who needs a transporter, to which he replies: \"I'm listening.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n<!-- opening title credits -->\n* [[Jason Statham]] as [[Frank Martin (Transporter)|Frank Martin]]\n* [[Alessandro Gassman]] as Gianni Chellini\n* [[Amber Valletta]] as Audrey Billings\n* [[Kate Nauta]] as Lola\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Senator Jefferson Billings\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Dimitri\n<!-- end first opening title cards before title  -->\n* [[Keith David]] as Stappleton\n* Hunter Clary as Jack Billings\n* [[Shannon Briggs]] as Max\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]] as Tarconi\n<!-- end second opening title cards -->\n<!-- not listed in the opening title -->\n* [[Jeff Chase]] as Vasily\t\n* [[AnnaLynne McCord]] as Car Jacker Girl\n* [[Tim Ware]] as U.S. Marshal Hoffman\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as U.S. Marshal Brown\n* [[Marty Wright]] as SWAT Commander\n* [[Raymond Tong]] as Rastaman\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Transporter 2'' opened in the United States on 2 September 2005.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a score of 52% based on reviews from 122 critics and reports a rating average of 5.41/10, with the reported consensus: \"A stylish and more focused sequel to ''The Transporter'', the movie is over-the-top fun for fans of the first movie.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/transporter_2/|title=Transporter 2|access-date=25 March 2020|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 56 based on 29 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Transporter 2|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/transporter-2|publisher=Metacritic|access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=2022-02-27 |website=[[CinemaScore]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film 3 stars out of 4 and called it better than the original. In a special to ''The [[Los Angeles Times]]'' on the same day as the film's US release, director Louis Leterrier stated that Frank Martin was \"the first gay action movie hero\", suggesting that the character comes out when he refuses a woman's advances by saying, \"It's because of who I am.\"<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{cite news|author=Lee, Chris|title=An action hero angle|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/02/entertainment/et-leterrier2|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2 September 2005|access-date=28 April 2012}}</ref> This is contradicted by the plot of ''[[Transporter 3]]'' where Frank Martin has sex with the female character he is transporting, and they end up together in what seems a permanent relationship.

The uncensored release is roughly 25 seconds longer than the theatrical cut, and contains improved CGI, particularly during the car chase from the hospital as well as the private jet scene.  This release also contains more violent footage and blood during the fight scenes, and contains more nudity in certain scenes with Lola. It is available in Japan (R2 NTSC), France and the UK (both R2 PAL), as well as Thailand (R3 NTSC). It is also available on Blu-ray Disc in France and Japan (both releases are region-free). The Blu-ray was temporarily banned in North America for legal reasons, but has since been re-released. The uncensored fight footage as well as a longer car chase scene was only featured as deleted scenes on the US DVD release. Also the deleted footage included the killing of the doctor.\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Transporter 3}}\nA 2008 sequel, entitled ''Transporter 3'', was released in the U.S. on 26 November 2008. The film follows Frank Martin as he returns to France.  It is the only film in the ''Transporter'' [[trilogy]] to be distributed by [[Lionsgate]] in the US.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0388482}}\n* {{Amg movie|307520}}\n* {{tcmdb title|615402}}\n* {{AFI film|id=63638|title=Transporter 2}}\n\n{{Transporter series}}\n{{Louis Leterrier}}\n{{Luc Besson}}\n\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2005 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:French action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s chase films]]\n[[Category:EuropaCorp films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Miami-Dade Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films about automobiles]]\n[[Category:Films about infectious diseases]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Louis Leterrier]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Luc Besson]]\n[[Category:Films set in Miami]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Miami]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Luc Besson]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Mark Kamen]]\n[[Category:French sequel films]]\n[[Category:Transporter (franchise)]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
