R. R. Tolkien]]. The [[sequel]] to 2002's '' [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', the film is the final<!-- Please do not add \"third and final\"; only ONE term is needed for a trilogy --> installment in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]]. It features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Liv Tyler]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Sean Astin]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Bernard Hill]], [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]], [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Orlando Bloom]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Miranda Otto]], [[David Wenham]], [[Karl Urban]], [[John Noble]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Ian Holm]], and [[Sean Bean]].\n\nContinuing the plot of the previous film, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Gollum]] are making their final way toward Mount Doom in Mordor in order to destroy the [[One Ring]], unaware of Gollum's true intentions, while [[Merry Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Pippin Took|Pippin]], [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]] and the rest are joining forces together against [[Sauron]] and his legions in [[Minas Tirith]].\n\n''The Return of the King'' was financed and distributed by American studio [[New Line Cinema]], but [[Production of The Lord of the Rings film series|filmed and edited]] entirely in Jackson's native [[New Zealand]], [[Back-to-back film production|concurrently]] with the other two parts of the trilogy. It premiered on 1 December 2003 at the [[Embassy Theatre, Wellington|Embassy Theatre]] in [[Wellington]], and was then released on 17 December 2003 in the United States and on 18 December 2003 in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by both critics and audiences, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and the fantasy film genre, with praise for the visual effects, performances, action sequences, direction, screenplay, musical score, costume design and emotional depth. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the [[2003 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2003]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|second<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, do NOT adjust!--> highest-grossing film of all time]] at the time of its release, as well as the highest-grossing film released by New Line Cinema.<ref>{{cite web |title=All Time Worldwide Box Office |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605104640/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/ |archive-date=5 June 2004}}</ref>\n\nLike the other films in the trilogy, ''The Return of the King'' is widely recognized as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest and most influential films ever made]].

Please check the word count before making any additions. Please go to the talk page before making any major changes. -->\n<section begin=Plot/>The [[hobbit]], [[Gollum|Sm\u00e9agol]], is fishing with his cousin D\u00e9agol, who discovers the [[One Ring]] in the river. Sm\u00e9agol's mind is ensnared by the Ring, and he kills his cousin for it. Increasingly corrupted physically and mentally, he retreats into the [[Misty Mountains]] and becomes known as Gollum.\n\nCenturies later, during the [[War of the Ring]], [[Gandalf]] leads [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], and King [[Th\u00e9oden]] of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] to [[Isengard]], where they reunite with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Gandalf retrieves Saruman's ''[[palant\u00edr]]'', and the group returns to Edoras to celebrate [[Battle of Helm's Deep|their victory at Helm's Deep]].{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' (2002)}} Pippin looks into the palant\u00edr, seeing [[Sauron]] and [[White Tree|a burning tree]]. Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack [[Gondor]]'s capital [[Minas Tirith]]; he rides there to warn Gondor's steward [[Denethor]]. Pippin, who accompanies him, swears fealty to Denethor, whose now-dead heir [[Boromir]] had saved his life;{{efn|As depicted in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001)}} on Gandalf's instruction, he triggers the lighting of [[Warning beacons of Gondor|the beacons]], which call for help from Rohan.\n\n[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], who carries the Ring, and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] continue their journey towards [[Mordor]], unaware that Gollum, now their guide, plans to betray them and take the Ring for himself. The trio witness the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], lord of the nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], setting off towards Gondor with his army of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]. Gollum conspires to frame Sam for eating food supplies and desiring the Ring; influenced by the growing power of the Ring, Frodo is taken in by the deception, and orders Sam to go home. Gollum then tricks Frodo into venturing into the lair of the giant spider [[Shelob]]. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, who falls down a chasm after a scuffle. Shelob discovers, paralyzes, and binds Frodo, but is wounded and driven away by a returning Sam, who, mourning Frodo's apparent death, takes the Ring. Sam realizes his mistake when a group of Orcs takes Frodo captive, but manages to rescue Frodo as the Orcs fight among themselves. Now inside Mordor, the hobbits continue towards [[Mount Doom]], their destination.\n\nAs King Th\u00e9oden gathers his army, [[Elrond]] tells Aragorn that [[Arwen]] is dying, having refused to leave Middle-earth. Elrond gives Aragorn [[And\u00faril]], reforged from the shards of King [[Elendil]]'s sword [[Narsil]], and urges him to commit to claiming Gondor's throne, to which he is heir. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels the [[Paths of the Dead]], and pledges to release the ghosts there from their curse should they come to Gondor's aid. Meanwhile, [[Faramir]], who was earlier overwhelmed and driven back to Minas Tirith by the Witch-king, is gravely wounded in a suicide charge; believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf marshals the defenders, but the huge Orc army breaks into the city. Denethor attempts to burn himself and Faramir on a [[pyre]], but Pippin alerts Gandalf and they rescue Faramir. Denethor, set ablaze and in agony, jumps to his death.\n\nTh\u00e9oden arrives and leads his army against the Orcs. Despite initial success against Orcs in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|ensuing battle]], they are decimated by the Oliphaunt-riding [[Haradrim]] and the Witch-king mortally wounds Th\u00e9oden; however, his niece [[\u00c9owyn]] slays the Witch-king with Merry's help. Th\u00e9oden dies in his niece's arms. Aragorn then arrives with his Army of the Dead, who overcome Sauron's forces and win the battle. Their oath fulfilled, the Dead are released from their curse. Aragorn decides to march on Mordor to distract Sauron from Frodo, now extremely weak, and Sam; all of Sauron's remaining forces march [[Battle of the Morannon|to meet Aragorn's diversion]], allowing the hobbits to reach Mount Doom. Gollum, who survived his earlier fall, attacks them, but Frodo still manages to enter the mountain. There, he succumbs to the Ring's power, putting it on his finger, but Gollum manages to bite off his finger and reclaim it. They struggle together and both fall off the ledge. Frodo clings to it with one hand as remorse and guilt flood his mind in the wake of his succumbing to the ring, when Sam's unwavering faith and belief in his friend convinces him to make one final reach for Sam's hand, saving Frodo's life. Gollum falls and dies; the Ring, which fell with him, disintegrates in the lava, causing Barad-d\u00fbr to crumble as The Eye of Sauron explodes, destroying the dark lord once and for all. Aragorn's army emerges victorious as its enemies and the lands of Mordor collapse into the earth, and Mount Doom erupts, with Frodo and Sam narrowly escaping the lava.\n\nGandalf rescues the hobbits with the help of [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]], and the surviving Fellowship is happily reunited in Minas Tirith. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and marries Arwen. The Hobbits return home to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], where Sam marries Rosie Cotton. A few years later, Frodo who is still [[Psychological trauma|traumatised]], departs Middle-earth for the [[Undying Lands]] with his uncle [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], Gandalf, and the Elves. He leaves Sam the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], which details their adventures. Sam returns to the Shire, where he embraces Rosie and their children.<section end=Plot/>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further-text|[[Cast of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]]}}\nLike the preceding films in the trilogy, ''The Return of the King'' has an [[ensemble cast]],<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=With Tolkien's Help, a Holiday Record for Films |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/29/movies/29BOFF.html?ex=1220932800&en=93d0c927a497bfec&ei=5070 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615050856/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/29/movies/29BOFF.html?ex=1220932800&en=93d0c927a497bfec&ei=5070 |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 June 2013 |work=The New York Times |date=29 December 2003 |access-date=7 September 2008}}</ref> and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as [[Frodo Baggins]]: A young [[hobbit]] who continues his quest to destroy the Ring, which continues to torture him.\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]]: An [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Istari wizard]] who travels to aid the Men of [[Gondor]], acting as a general at the Siege of Gondor.\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]]: A [[D\u00fanedain]] ranger who must finally face his destiny as King of Gondor.\n* [[Sean Astin]] as [[Samwise Gamgee]]: Better known as Sam, Frodo's loyal hobbit gardener and companion.\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Gollum|Sm\u00e9agol Trahald / Gollum]]: A wretched and treacherous creature who was once one of the river-folk (an extinct race of hobbits) and now guides Frodo and Sam into Mordor.

Most major events from the books are included, leaving only a few events from the novel omitted from the film; there are, however, some events in the film significantly altered from the novels. There are some events seen only in the film and there are certain details in the film not found in the books.\n\nThe film version of ''The Return of the King'' contains major scenes that occurred in the middle portion of the novel ''The Two Towers'' but were not included in the film version, such as the attack by Shelob and the ''palant\u00edr'' subplot, owing to Jackson's realigning events of the film to fit the timeline as described in the book's Appendices, rather than the main prose.<ref name=\"Story\">{{cite video |title=Finding the Story: Forging the Final Chapter (Special Extended Edition documentary) |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> However, the plot of the second half of [[The Treason of Isengard (1954 book)|Book III]] is either completely omitted (chapter \"The Road to Isengard\") or only shown in one scene (chapter \"The Voice of Saruman\"). [[Saruman]]'s murder by [[Gr\u00edma Wormtongue|Gr\u00edma]] (seen only in the Extended Edition) is moved into the Isengard visit because of the cutting of the [[The Scouring of the Shire|Scouring of the Shire]]. In the film, Grima is killed by Legolas, while in the book, he is killed by Hobbits. In the film, Saruman drops the ''palant\u00edr'' when he is fatally attacked, whereas in the book Gr\u00edma throws it at the Fellowship, unaware of its value.\n\nIn the film, all journeys of the companions from [[Isengard]] to [[Minas Tirith]] are compressed and simplified, as the entire company travels from Isengard to [[Edoras]] and arrives there simultaneously to recuperate after the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]]. Pippin's looking into the palant\u00edr happens in Edoras, and he and Gandalf leave for Minas Tirith from there, but in the book, this takes place at [[Minor places in Middle-earth#Dol Baran|Dol Baran]] with the appearance of a [[Nazg\u00fbl]] on a winged steed, and they stay at Edoras only one night. In contrast to the film, Aragorn and Th\u00e9oden march from Dol Baran to [[Helm's Deep]] to take a night's rest. It is in the [[Hornburg]] where Aragorn looks into the ''palant\u00edr'' (as opposed to the film's Extended Edition, in which he does so much later in Minas Tirith after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]) and decides to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. In the film, Aragorn and The\u00f3den depart not before their encampment at [[Dunharrow]], but in the book, Aragorn and the D\u00fanedain (which are absent in the film) ride from Helm's Deep over the fields to Edoras and then to Dunharrow and the Dimholt, whereas in the book, Th\u00e9oden takes slower mountain paths and arrives in Dunharrow after Aragorn and his companions have already left. Th\u00e9oden is seen to set out directly from Dunharrow to Minas Tirith, omitting his brief return to Edoras from Dunharrow to muster all remaining forces there, as told in the book.\n\nThe sequence of the Paths of the Dead adds a conversation between Aragorn and the King of the Dead (in the book the Dead don't speak at all) and a scene where the companions must flee an avalanche of skulls, but leaves out the encounter with Baldor's skeleton. In contrast to the book, the viewer doesn't get told what happened in [[Lebennin]] between Aragorn and the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. The film version (Extended Edition) doesn't correspond with the map of Gondor, as the company sees a near river with Corsair ships immediately after leaving the Haunted Mountain. In the book, the River [[Anduin]] lies several hundred miles farther east, requiring a much longer journey with the Army of the Dead following behind, bringing terror to the towns they pass along the way.\n\nThe basis of [[Elrond]] and [[Arwen]]'s subplot arguing about Arwen's fate is derived from the Appendices, but it is largely extended in the film, as is Arwen and Elrond's relevance to the story.\n\n[[Denethor]], the [[Steward of Gondor]], was a more tragic character in the book. In the film, overwhelming grief over the death of [[Boromir]] has driven him to despair, and he has given up any hope of defeating Sauron before Gandalf arrives in Minas Tirith. Thus, the muster of Gondor is absent from the film, and major captains and generals (including [[Imrahil]] of the Tower Guard and the Knights of [[Dol Amroth]]) are not present. In the book, he has already ordered the lighting of the beacons before Gandalf's arrival, while he refuses to light them in the film, and the sequence where Pippin secretly lights them himself was invented for the movie. The film only hints at Denethor's use of the ''palant\u00edr'' which drives him mad, information revealed in the Pyre scene, which includes Shadowfax and is more violent than the book. Aware of the very long distance between Rath D\u00ednen and the front of the out-thrust battlement, Jackson has Denethor jump off the Citadel in addition to burning himself on the Pyre, one of the earliest changes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |author-link=Brian Sibley |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey |publisher=Harpercollins |year=2006 |location=London |page=345 |isbn=0-00-717558-2}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Minas Tirith#Rammas Echor|Rammas Echor]] which encircles the [[Minas Tirith#Pelennor Fields|Pelennor Fields]] isn't shown in the film, and the fields themselves are empty grassland in the films, instead of being rich farmland dotted with small villages in the book.\n\nThe [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] is also altered: though Faramir goes on a suicide mission, the conflict is a simplification of the siege of [[List of minor places in Middle-earth#O|Osgiliath]]. With generals such as [[Lossarnach|Forlong]] and [[Imrahil]] absent, Gandalf commands the defence of Minas Tirith owing to Denethor's despair. While Denethor gives command to Gandalf in the book, in this film Gandalf forcibly takes control after Denethor tells his men to flee rather than fight. The Orcs and Trolls also never get into the city in the book. The Witch-king enters and stands off against Gandalf before the Rohirrim arrive, but in the film Orcs invade the city after [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Grond|Grond]] breaks the Gate. The confrontation takes place while Gandalf journeys to save Faramir, during which Gandalf has his staff broken in the film (but not in the book).\n\nA subplot in which the Rohirrim are aided by the primitive [[Dr\u00faedain]] during their journey to the besieged Gondor is excised from the film. The [[Red Arrow (Middle-earth)|Red Arrow]] brought by a messenger from Gondor to ask for aid is absent. \u00c9owyn's presence on the battlefield is unknown to the reader until she takes off her helmet, but in the film the audience is aware, as it would have been difficult to have [[Miranda Otto]] playing a man.<ref name=\"Director's commentary\">{{cite video |people=Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens |title=Director/Writers' Special Extended Edition commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> When hope seems lost, Gandalf comforts Pippin with a description of the Undying Lands, which is a descriptive passage in the book's final chapter.<ref name=\"Story\" /> The film depicts the Army of the Dead fighting in the Battle, whereas in the book they are released from service prior to this, after helping Aragorn defeat the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] at the port city of [[Pelargir]] in [[Lebennin]]; Aragorn's reinforcements are merely more Gondorians, and the [[D\u00fanedain]], Aragorn's people (the [[rangers of the North]]). An unstoppable and invulnerable force, the Dead wipe out Sauron's forces. The film also cuts out several supporting characters, such as [[Halbarad]], a friend of Aragorn's, who helps lead the D\u00fanedain, Beregond, a member of the Citadel Guard of Gondor, whom Pippin befriends, and [[Elladan and Elrohir]], the twin sons of Elrond who deliver Aragorn's banner and accompany him to the Pelennor Fields. Elladan and Elrohir are replaced by Elrond in the film, instead delivering [[And\u00faril]] in Dunharrow, and then returning to Rivendell. In the books Aragorn isn't doubtful about his destiny, but had already decided to claim the throne of Gondor from the beginning of the Quest; thus, it was he who had the shards of Narsil forged to And\u00faril in Rivendell, carrying it from there on the whole journey.\n\nThe film also altered the circumstances of Th\u00e9oden's death; his death speech, in which he names \u00c9omer the new king in the book, is trimmed and delivered to \u00c9owyn instead of Merry, with an earlier scene in the Extended Edition even implying that \u00c9owyn is next in line for the throne. Th\u00e9oden's rallying speech (\"To death!\") before the initial charge in the film are spoken by \u00c9omer in the book when he believes that both Th\u00e9oden and \u00c9owyn have been killed in combat with the Witch King.<ref name=\"Story\"/>\n\nThe Extended Edition presents shortened scenes from the book's chapters in the [[Minas Tirith#Houses of Healing|Houses of Healing]]: The Warden, the talk of [[Athelas]], the comical conversation with the herb-master, the woman [[Women in The Lord of the Rings#Other female characters|Ioreth]] and her saying about a King's healing hands and the subsequent realizing of Aragorn's true identity are left out altogether.\n\nIn the film, Aragorn leads the entire remaining force of Rohan and Gondor's men to the Black Gate without incident. In the book, tactics are discussed, forces divide and fight smaller skirmishes in [[Gondor#An\u00f3rien|An\u00f3rien]] and [[Ithilien]] before the army (only a fraction of the full remaining strength of the nations of men) reach the Morannon. The romance that develops between \u00c9owyn and Faramir during their recoveries in the Houses of Healing is also largely cut, presumably to keep the focus on Aragorn and Arwen; the subplot is only briefly referenced in the Extended Edition with a scene where the two hold hands.<ref name=\"Story\"/>\n\nSam and Frodo's major rift in their friendship, due to Gollum's machinations, never takes place in the book, but was added by the writers in believing that it added drama and more complexity to the character of Frodo. Frodo enters Shelob's lair alone in the film, whereas in the book he and Sam entered together. This was done to make the scene more horrific with Frodo being alone, and Sam's rescue at the last minute more dramatic. Frodo's ordeal in [[Tower of Cirith Ungol|the Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and subsequent rescue by Sam are also changed; in [[The Return of the King|the book]], Frodo is stripped, beaten, and cruelly interrogated by the Orcs, while in the film, he is tied up but only briefly threatened by an Orc moments before Sam's arrival. The reunion of Frodo and Sam in the film is also shorter and less emotional than in the book; rather than comforting the physically injured and severely traumatized Frodo as in the book, Sam, after killing the Orc that was threatening Frodo but had not struck him, briefly accepts his apology for having doubted him and returns the Ring to him before suggesting that they find some Orc clothing for Frodo to wear. In the film, Sam also does not experience \"delusions of grandeur\" about what he could do if he took the Ring for himself, like he does in the book. Sam instead overcomes a very brief moment of temptation which, instead of stemming from thoughts of how he could use the Ring for himself, seems to come from his concern for Frodo and wish to reduce the Ring's harm to his friend by sharing the burden. Also, in the film viewers do not know that Sam has the Ring until he gives it back to Frodo, whereas in the book the reader knows that Sam has the Ring. When Sam and Frodo are diverted into the Orc march in [[Mordor]] and are about to collapse, in the film's Extended Edition they start a fake combat between each other and thus provoke some chaos during which they manage to escape, instead of slipping off during a congestion caused by several armies trying to get through the narrow Isenmouthe, as told in the novel.\n\nGollum's fall into the lava of Mount Doom was also rewritten for the film, as the writers felt Tolkien's original idea (Gollum simply slips and falls off) was anti-climactic. Originally, an even greater deviation was planned: Frodo would heroically push Gollum over the ledge to destroy him and the Ring, but the production team eventually realized that it looked more like Frodo murdering Gollum. As a result, they had Frodo and Gollum struggle for possession of the Ring and both slip over the edge by accident.<ref name=\"Story\"/>\n\n[[File:Dark Lord Sauron.jpg|thumb|upright=0.81|Statue of Sauron from ''The Lord of the Rings'' movies.]]\n\nIn addition to the absent footage from the film are the other major attacks by Sauron on various regions of Middle-earth, referenced only briefly in the main text of ''The Return of the King'',<ref name=\"Story\"/> and expanded upon in the Appendices; the invasion of Rohan by the Orcs of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], the attacks on Lothl\u00f3rien and the [[Mirkwood|Woodland Realm]] of [[Thranduil]] by the forces of [[Dol Guldur]], and the attack on Dale and the [[Lonely Mountain]] by a force of [[Easterling (Middle-earth)|Easterlings]].<ref name=\"Story\"/> These events are hinted at in a comment by Legolas (also in the book) that the other peoples of Middle Earth are unlikely to ride to war in Gondor because war has already arrived in their own lands.\n\nThere are several changes in the Battle of the Black Gate: Merry is not present there in the book, Pippin does not kill a troll as he does in the novel (instead, Aragorn fights one), the eagles fight and defeat some of the mounted Nazg\u00fbl (while Frodo putting on the One Ring distracted the Nazg\u00fbl, who raced away to Mount Doom in the book before a confrontation could occur), and Aragorn kills the [[Mouth of Sauron]] in the extended edition of the film but not in the book.<ref name=\"Story\"/> There was an even larger change planned: Sauron himself would come out in physical form to battle Aragorn, who would only be saved by the destruction of the Ring. Jackson eventually realized it ignored the point of Aragorn's true bravery in distracting Sauron's army against overwhelming odds, and a computer generated Troll was placed over footage of Sauron in the finished film. In the book, after the destruction of the Ring the spirit of Sauron rises like a black cloud from the ruin of Barad-d\u00fbr before being blown away by the wind, but in the film the Eye of Sauron erupts in flame and then explodes as Barad-d\u00fbr collapses. As in all of Jackson's Middle-earth adaptions, the eagles do not speak.\n\nDuring the Battle for Minas Tirith, the [[White Tree of Gondor]] is shown to bear one white blossom, thus blooming by itself at Aragorn's coronation. Thereby the film ignores the book's story where Gandalf and Aragorn find a seedling of the White Tree up in the mountains and plant it in the courtyard in place of the still-dead tree.\n\nAlthough the film runs for another approximately 20 minutes after the climactic Downfall of Barad-d\u00fbr, many following events from the book are omitted or significantly altered in the film. Aragorn's coronation takes place in form of a great ceremony in the Citadel of Minas Tirith, opposed to the book, where Aragorn is crowned in his tent on the Pelennor Fields before entering the city. Omitted entirely are the camp at the [[Field of Cormallen]], Aragorn's business in Minas Tirith, Aragorn and Arwen's wedding, [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] being present at the ceremonies and their subsequent travelling along with the company, Th\u00e9oden's funeral at Edoras, the complete journey back to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] with stops at Rivendell and Bree, and the [[The Scouring of the Shire|Scouring of the Shire]], which was always seen by the screenwriters as anticlimactic.<ref name=\"Story\"/>\n\nSince Saruman is killed long before, after the battle at Helm's Deep in the film, he is unable to exact revenge on Frodo and the hobbits by ruining the Shire as depicted in the books. In the film, the Shire is virtually unchanged when they return, and their friends and neighbours seem unaware of the climactic events that have taken place outside of their borders. Thus, the esteem earned by Merry and Pippin at the Battle of Bywater and the work to restore the Shire using Galadriel's gift don't appear in the film.\n\nAt the end of the book, Frodo and Sam leave the Shire alone, meet Galadriel, Elrond and Bilbo along the way at the [[Eastfarthing|Woody End]], and meet Gandalf at the Grey Havens, with Merry and Pippin arriving just in time to say their farewells and accompany Sam back to [[Bag End]]. In the film, however, all of the Hobbits travel with Gandalf to the Havens to find the Elves waiting there, including Celeborn, who remains in Middle-earth in the book. When Sam returns to the Shire, he isn't shown to live in [[Bag End]] (where he dwells with Rose in the book), but in a different Hobbit-hole of his own.\n\n==Production==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series|l1=Production of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series}}\n''The Lord of the Rings'' series was the first time whose three separate entries were written and shot simultaneously (excluding [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick up shoots]]).

Richard Taylor headed Weta, while [[Grant Major]] and [[Dan Hennah]] organized the planning and building respectively.\n\nThe city of Minas Tirith, glimpsed briefly in both the previous two films, is seen fully in this film, and with it the Gondorian civilization. The enormous soundstage was built at Dry Creek Quarry, outside [[Wellington]], from the [[Helm's Deep]] set. That set's gate became Minas Tirith's second, while the Hornburg exterior became that of the Extended Edition's scene where Gandalf confronts the Witch-king. New structures included the 8m tall Gate, with broken and unbroken versions, with a working opening and closing mechanism, with its engravings inspired by the [[Florence Baptistery#Baptistry doors|Baptistry of San Giovanni]]. There were also four levels of streets with heraldic motifs for every house, as inspired by [[Siena]].<ref name=\"Design\">{{cite video |title=Designing and Building Middle-earth (Special Extended Edition documentary) |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nThere was also the Citadel, the exterior of which was in the Stone Street Studios backlot, using [[forced perspective]]. It contains the withered [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]], built from polystyrene by Brian Massey and the Greens Department with real branches, influenced by ancient and gnarled Lebanese olive trees. The interior was within a three-story former factory in Wellington, and colourwise is influenced by [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Charlemagne's Chapel]], with a throne for Denethor carved from stone and polystyrene statues of past kings. The Gondorian armour is designed to represent an evolution from the [[N\u00famenor|N\u00famen\u00f3reans]] of the first film's prologue, with a simplified sea bird motif. 16th-century Italian and German armour served as inspiration,<ref name=\"Weta Workshop\">{{cite video |title=Weta Workshop (Special Extended Edition documentary) |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> while civilians wear silver and blacks as designed by Ngila Dickson, continuing an ancient/medieval [[Mediterranean Basin]] look.<ref>{{cite video |people=Ngila Dickson |title=Costume Design (Special Extended Edition documentary) |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref>\n\nMinas Morgul, the Staircase and Tower of Cirith Ungol as well as Shelob's Lair were designed by Howe, with the Morgul road using forced perspective into a bluescreened miniature. Howe's design of Minas Morgul was inspired from the experience of having a [[wisdom tooth]] pulled out: in the same way, the Orcs have put their twisted designs on to a former Gondorian city.<ref name=\"Big-atures\">{{cite video |title=Big-atures (Special Extended Edition documentary) |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> Cirith Ungol was based on Tolkien's design, but when Richard Taylor felt it as \"boring\", it was redesigned with more tipping angles.<ref name=\"Art book\">{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |author-link=Gary Russell |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Art of the Return of the King |publisher=Harpercollins |year=2004 |isbn=0-00-713565-3}}</ref> The interior set, like Minas Tirith, was built as a few multiple levels that numerous camera takes would suggest a larger structure.<ref name=\"Design\" />\n\nThe third film introduces the enormous spider [[Shelob]]. Shelob was designed in 1999,<ref name=\"Art book\" /> with the body based on a [[Porrhothele antipodiana|tunnelweb spider]] and the head with numerous growths selected by Peter Jackson's children from one of many sculpts. Jackson himself took great joy in planning the sequence, being an [[Arachnophobia|arachnophobe]] himself.<ref name=\"Weta Workshop\" /> Shelob's Lair was inspired by sandstone and sculpted from the existing Caverns of Isengard set.<ref name=\"Design\" />\n\n''The Return of the King'' also brings into focus the Dead Men of Dunharrow and the evil Haradrim from the south of Middle-earth, men who ride the ''m\u00fbmakil''. The Dead Men have a Celtic influence, as well as lines and symmetry to reflect their morbid state,<ref name=\"Design\" /> while their underground city is influenced by [[Petra]].<ref name=\"Big-atures\" /> The Haradrim were highly influenced by African culture, until Philippa Boyens expressed concern over the possibility of offensiveness, so the finished characters instead bear influence from [[Kiribati]], in terms of weaving armour from bamboo, and the Aztecs, in use of jewellery. Also built was a single dead ''m\u00fbmak''.<ref name=\"Weta Workshop\" /> Other minor cultures include the Corsairs, with an exotic, swarthy look, and the Grey Havens, Elven structures adapted to stone, with influence from [[J. M. W. Turner]] paintings.<ref name=\"Art book\" />\n\n===Principal photography===\n''The Return of the King'' was shot during 2000, though Astin's coverage from Gollum's attempt to separate Frodo and Sam was filmed on 24 November 1999, when floods in [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] interrupted the focus on ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.<ref name=\"Cameras in Middle-earth\" /> Some of the earliest scenes shot for the film were in fact shot last. [[Shire (Middle-earth)#Westfarthing|Hobbiton]], home of the Hobbits, was shot in January 2000 with early scenes from ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', with the exterior shot at a [[Matamata]] farm, while interior scenes were shot at Stone Street Studios in [[Wellington]],<ref>{{cite video |title=Cameras in Middle-earth: Filming the Fellowship of the Ring |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2002}}</ref> shared with the Grey Havens sequence.

Also a cause for concern were Monaghan and Boyd's scale doubles during a charge sequence. In the meantime, Wood, Astin and Serkis filmed at [[Mount Ruapehu]] for the Mount Doom exteriors. In particular, they spent two hours shooting Sam lifting Frodo on to his back with cross-[[camera coverage]].<ref name=\"Cameras in Middle-earth\" />\n\nScenes shot in June were the Paths of the Dead across various locations, including [[Putangirua Pinnacles]].<ref name=\"Year of Filming\" /> In July the crew shot some Shelob scenes, and in August and September time was spent on the scenes in Isengard. Monaghan and Boyd tried numerous takes of their entrance, stressing the word \"weed\" as they smoked [[List of Middle-earth plants#Pipe-weed|pipe-weed]]. Christopher Lee spent his part of his scene mostly alone, though McKellen and Hill arrived on the first day for a few lines to help.<ref name=\"Cameras in Middle-earth\" />\n\nEdoras exteriors were shot in October. The Ride of the Rohirrim, where [[Th\u00e9oden]] leads the charge into the Orc army, was filmed in [[Twizel]] with 150 extras on horseback. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields has more extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], in contrast to the more extensive use of live action in the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]] in the second film. Also filmed were the attempts by Faramir to recapture [[List of minor places in Middle-earth#O|Osgiliath]],<ref>{{cite video |title=Home of the Horse Lords |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> as were scenes in the city itself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Davidson |first=Paul |title=A Slew of The Lord of the Rings news |website=IGN |date=14 November 2000 |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034276p1.html |access-date=24 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831202506/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034276p1.html |archive-date=31 August 2011}}</ref> At this point production was very hectic, with Jackson moving around ten units per day, and production finally wrapped on the Minas Tirith sets, as well as second units shooting parts of the siege. Just as the Hobbit actors' first scene was hiding from a Ringwraith under a tree, their last scene was the [[Chroma key|bluescreened]] reaction shot of the inhabitants of Minas Tirith bowing to them.<ref name=\"Cameras in Middle-earth\" />\n\n===Pick-ups===\nThe 2003 [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] were filmed in the [[Wellington]] studio car park, with many parts of sets and blue-screens used to finish off scenes, which the design team had to work 24 hours to get the right sets ready for a particular day.<ref name=\"Design\" /> The shoot continued for two months, and became an emotional time of farewells for the cast and crew. The film has the most extensive list of re-shoots given for the trilogy. Jackson took his time to re-shoot Aragorn's coronation, rushed into a single day under second unit director Geoff Murphy on 21 December 2000. Jackson also re-shot scenes in and around Mount Doom,<ref name=\"Cameras in Middle-earth\" /> and Th\u00e9oden's death, right after Bernard Hill was meant to wrap.<ref name=\"Director's commentary\" />\n\nThere was also the new character of Gothmog. This was a major new design addition for the film, as Jackson felt the Mordor Orcs were \"pathetic\" compared to the [[Uruk-hai]] of the second film after watching assembly cuts, and thus [[Weta Workshop]] created grotesque new \"\u00fcber Orcs\" as antagonists for the audience to focus on. [[Christian Rivers]] also redesigned the Witch-king and all of his scenes were re-shot, because of confusion from non-readers over whether or not Sauron was on the battlefield.<ref name=\"Weta Workshop\" />\n\nWith the positive response to Bloom, Legolas was given a fight with a ''m\u00fbmak'',<ref name=\"Pick-up end\">{{cite web |last=Davidson |first=Paul |title=A new ''Return of the King'' poster |website=IGN |date=27 June 2003 |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/426/426327p1.html |access-date=21 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118234017/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/426/426327p1.html |archive-date=18 January 2012}}</ref> and [[Howard Shore]] also appeared in a cameo during Legolas and Gimli's drinking game at Edoras.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite video |title=Music for Middle-earth |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> The final scenes shot were Aragorn escaping the Skull avalanche, and Frodo finishing his book.

Like ''The Two Towers'', they would have to deal with multiple storylines, and Jackson paid attention to each storyline at a time before deciding where to intercut. Most importantly they spent three weeks working on the last 45 minutes of the film,<ref name=\"Edit\" /> for appropriate intercutting and leaving out scenes such as the Mouth of Sauron, and the fates of characters like Legolas, Gimli, \u00c9owyn and Faramir.<ref name=\"Story\" /> The film inherited scenes originally planned to go into the second film, including the reforging of [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil|Narsil]], Gollum's backstory, and Saruman's exit. But the Saruman scene posed a structural problem: killing off the second film's villain when the plot has Sauron as the main villain.<ref name=\"Edit\" /> Despite pick-ups and dubs, the scene was cut, causing controversy with fans and Saruman actor Christopher Lee, as well as a petition to restore the scene.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rings director cuts wizard scenes |publisher=BBC News online |date=12 November 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3265475.stm |access-date=17 October 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317114116/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3265475.stm |archive-date=17 March 2006}}</ref> Lee nonetheless contributed to the DVDs and was at the [[Copenhagen]] premiere, although he said he would never understand the reason for the cut and his relationship with Jackson was chilly.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wootton|first=Dan|date=30 April 2006|title=I will never forgive Jackson, says LOTR actor|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=594&ObjectID=10379594|url-status=dead|access-date=17 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930012208/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=594&ObjectID=10379594|archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref> They would, however, later reconcile upon Lee's casting in Jackson's ''Hobbit'' films. Jackson only had a lock on 5 out of 10 reels, and had to churn out 3 reels in 3 weeks to help finish the film. It was finally completed on 12 November 2003.<ref name=\"End of all Things\">{{cite video |title=The End of All Things (Special Extended Edition documentary) |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> Jackson never had a chance to view the film in full due to the hectic schedule, and only saw the film from beginning to end on 1 December at the [[Wellington]] premiere; according to [[Elijah Wood]], his response was \"yup, it's good, pretty good\".<ref name=\"Passing of an Age\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\n{{Main|Special effects of The Lord of the Rings film series|l1=Special effects of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series}}\n''The Return of the King'' contains 1,489 visual effect shots, nearly three times the number from the first film and almost twice that of the second. As with the two previous films, [[Jim Rygiel]] served as the visual effects supervisor. Visual effects work began with [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]] and Mark Lewis compositing various photographs of New Zealand landscape to create the digital arena of the [[Minas Tirith#Pelennor Fields|Pelennor Fields]] in November 2002. Jackson and [[Christian Rivers]] used computers to plan the enormous battle up until February 2003, when the shots were shown to Weta Digital. To their astonishment, 60 planned shots had gone up to 250, and 50,000 characters were now 200,000.<ref name=\"Weta Digital\">{{cite video |title=Weta Digital (Special Extended Edition documentary) |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> Nevertheless, they pressed on, soon delivering 100 shots a week, 20 a day, and as the deadline neared within the last two months, often working until 2&nbsp;am.<ref name=\"End of all Things\" />\n\nFor the battle, they recorded 450 motions for the [[MASSIVE (software)|MASSIVE]] digital horses (though deaths were animated), and also had to deal with late additions in the film, such as Trolls bursting through Minas Tirith's gates as well as the creatures that pull Grond to the gate,<ref name=\"Weta Workshop\" /> and redoing a shot of two ''m\u00fbmakil'' \u00c9omer takes down that had originally taken six months in two days. On a similar note of digital creatures, Shelob's head sculpture was scanned by a Canadian company for 10 times more detail than Weta had previously been able to capture.<ref name=\"Weta Digital\" />\n\nLike the previous films, there are also extensive morphs between digital doubles for the actors. This time, there was Sam falling off Shelob, where the morph takes place as Astin hits the ground. Legolas attacking a ''m\u00fbmak'' required numerous transitions to and fro, and Gollum's shots of him having recovered the One Ring and falling into the Crack of Doom were fully animated.<ref name=\"Weta Digital\" /> For the latter scene, as well as the scene in which [[Mount Doom]] erupts and Frodo and Sam escape from the volcano, the help of the company [[Next Limit Technologies]] and their software [[RealFlow]] was required to simulate the [[lava]]. The King of the Dead is played by an actor in prosthetics, and his head occasionally morphs to a more skull-like digital version, depending on the character's mood. The Mouth of Sauron also had his mouth enlarged 200% for unsettling effect.<ref name=\"Design\" />\n\n''The Return of the King'' also has practical effects. In the Pyre of Denethor sequence, as the Steward of Gondor throws Pippin out of the Tomb, [[John Noble]] threw a [[Special effects of The Lord of the Rings film series#Size Doubles|size double]] named Fon onto a prostrate [[Billy Boyd (actor)|Billy Boyd]], who immediately pushed his head into camera to complete the illusion. A few burning torches were also reflected off a plate of glass and into the camera for when Gandalf's horse Shadowfax kicks Denethor onto the pyre. Because of Jackson's requirement for complete representation of his fantasy world, numerous miniatures were built, such as 1:72 scale miniature of Minas Tirith, which rises 7m high and is 6.5m in [[diameter]]. 1:14 scale sections of the city were also required, and the Extended Edition scene of the collapsing City of the Dead has 80,000 small skulls, amounting in total to a single cubic meter.<ref name=\"Big-atures\" /> The miniatures team concluded in November with the Black Gate, after 1000 days of shooting, and the final digital effects shot done was the Ring's destruction, on 25 November.<ref name=\"End of all Things\" />\n\n===Sound effects===\nThe Sound department spent the early part of the year searching for the right sounds. A [[Tasmanian devil]] was used to create Shelob's shriek, which in turn gave inspiration for Weta's animators, while the ''m\u00fbmakil'' is the beginning and end of a lion roar. Human screams and a donkey screech were mixed into Sauron's fall and broken glass was used for the collapsing sounds. For missile trading during Minas Tirith's siege, construction workers dropped actual 2 ton stone blocks previously lifted by a construction crane. Mixing began at a new studio on 15 August, although unfinished building work caused some annoyances.<ref>{{cite video |title=The Soundscapes of Middle-earth |medium=DVD |publisher=New Line Cinema |year=2004}}</ref> The mixers finished on 15 November, after three months of non-stop work.<ref name=\"End of all Things\" />\n\n===Score===\n{{Main|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (soundtrack)|l1=''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (soundtrack)}}\n{{Broader|Music of The Lord of the Rings film series{{!}}Music of ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series}}\n{{listen\n|filename=IntoTheWestROTK.ogg\n|title=\"Into the West\" (performed by Annie Lennox)\n|description=Written by Fran Walsh, Howard Shore, and Annie Lennox, this selected song won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[76th Academy Awards]].

Shore also used the Gondor theme with the new ascending coda (which is unique to this film) in his score for the trailer of the film.\n\nThe score features the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[London Voices]], the [[London Oratory School Schola]] and featured vocal soloists.

Boyd sings on screen as Faramir charges towards Osgiliath, Mortensen sings on screen as he is crowned King, and in the Extended Edition Tyler sings as Aragorn heals \u00c9owyn.\n\n[[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]], Ben Del Maestro, [[Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8]] and [[James Galway]] also contribute to the soundtrack as featured soloists. Fleming sings as Arwen has a vision of her son and when Gollum recovers the One Ring. Del Maestro sings when Gandalf lights his staff to save fleeing Gondorian soldiers from Osgiliath as the Nazg\u00fbl attack and as the eagles arrive at the Black Gates. Galway plays the flute and whistle as Frodo and Sam climb Mount Doom and as they return to the shire. Sissel sings \"Asea Aranion\", which was originally meant to score the Houses of Healing scene. The end title song, \"[[Into the West (song)|Into the West]]\", was composed by Shore with lyrics by Fran Walsh. [[Annie Lennox]] (formerly of [[Eurythmics]]) performed it and also received songwriting credit. The song was partially inspired by the premature death from cancer of a young New Zealand filmmaker named [[Cameron Duncan]] who had befriended Peter Jackson.<ref name=\"Music\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\nAfter two years of attention and acclaim since the release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', audience and critical anticipation for the final entry was extremely high. The world premiere was held in [[Wellington]]'s [[Embassy Theatre, Wellington|Embassy Theatre]], on 1 December 2003, and was attended by the director and many of the stars.

The DVD was a 2-disc set with extras on the second disc. The theatrical DVD sets for the two previous films were released eight months after the films were released, but ''Return of the King'''s set was completed in five because it did not have to market a sequel (the previous films had to wait for footage of their sequels to become available for a ten-minute preview). However, it contained a seven-minute trailer of the entire trilogy.\n\n''The Return of the King'' followed the precedent set by its predecessors by releasing an Extended Edition (251 minutes) with new editing and added special effects and music, along with four commentaries and six hours of supplementary material, plus 10 minutes of fan-club credits. However, this set took longer to produce than the others because the cast and crew, no longer based in New Zealand for the trilogy, were spread all over the world working on other projects.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Susman|first=Gary|date=9 June 2004|title=Hobbits for the Holidays|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,649118,00.html|url-status=dead|access-date=17 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616014640/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C649118%2C00.html|archive-date=16 June 2007}}</ref> The set was finally released on 14 December 2004 in the UK and US.

The DVD has a [[DTS (sound system)|DTS-ES]] soundtrack. The DVD also features two humorous [[Easter egg (media)|Easter Eggs]], one where Dominic Monaghan plays a German interviewer with Elijah Wood via satellite and another where [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Ben Stiller]] attempt to convince Jackson to make a sequel, originally shown at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards.
