The film revolves around the premise of an aspiring teenage writer entering the lives of a dysfunctional family living on the [[south coast of England]]. \"[[Albatross (metaphor)|Albatross]]\" is a metaphor used to describe a constant and inescapable burden.<ref>{{cite web |title=albatross |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/albatross |publisher=The Free Dictionary |accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot entirely on the [[Isle of Man]] with the support of the island's government. It is MacCormick's feature film debut, he having previously made his name in television. Also making her debut was screenwriter Tamzin Rafn. Rafn based the script on her own experiences as a rebellious teenager.\n\n''Albatross'' premiered at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in June 2011. It was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on 14 October 2011 garnering mixed reviews, although Brown Findlay has received praise for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\nThe rebellious teenage dropout, Emelia Conan Doyle, believes herself to be a descendant of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. She takes on a job as a cleaner in a seaside hotel owned by Jonathan Fischer. Jonathan is a writer from Germany who has struggled with writer's block since his successful first novel, ''The Cliff House'', was published 21 years before. He lives in the hotel with his wife Joa and two daughters, Beth, 17, and Posy, 6. Jonathan is constantly sequestered in the attic working ineffectually on his writing, leaving the hotel to be run by Joa. Their marriage is stormy, as Joa is unhappy about Jonathan's lack of success in his profession and his disconnected parenting. Meanwhile, Emelia has lived with her grandparents since her mother committed suicide.\n\nOn her first day of work, Emelia catches Jonathan masturbating in the attic. She meets Beth, who is applying to study medicine at the [[University of Oxford]]. Beth invites Emilia to dinner with the family, during which Emelia reveals that she is writing a novel but is struggling to live up to the Conan Doyle name. Later, Jonathan offers Emilia creative writing lessons. They conduct their lessons secretly in the attic. One day, Jonathan drives Emelia to the grave of Arthur Conan Doyle. The two eventually begin a sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Emelia teaches Beth to explore her rebellious side and the two become best friends.\n\nEmelia accompanies Beth to Oxford for her entrance interview. On the first night they go out for a drink and end up partying with other students. Beth has casual sex with one of the men. They return to her accommodation the next morning to find out that the interview has been moved up to that day. Beth exits the interview feeling nervous, but receives encouragement from Emelia.\n\nAfter returning from Oxford, Emelia begins feeling guilty about her affair with Jonathan and starts distancing herself from him. She also deals with the death of her grandmother. Days after the funeral, Beth falls ill, which Emelia suspects to be morning sickness. Emelia gets her a pregnancy test kit. As she drops off the test kit in Beth's room, Jonathan calls her to the attic. Emelia tells Jonathan she has given up trying to write a novel and admonishes him for not living a single day since writing ''The Cliff House''. Meanwhile, Joa catches Beth with the completed pregnancy test, which indicates she is not pregnant. Emelia returns to Beth's room while Joa angrily informs Jonathan about Beth's sexual activity, and chastises his parenting again. A disheartened Jonathan admits his affair with Emelia. Enraged, Joa yells \"... you have been fucking our daughter's best friend?\", which is overheard by Beth. Joa kicks Jonathan out of the house.\n\nThe following day at school, Emelia tries to reconcile with Beth, but Beth rejects her overtures, and tells her she is not a Conan Doyle. That night, Emelia questions her grandfather about this, and he reveals that her mother lied to her about being a descendant of Arthur Conan Doyle. However, he encourages her to pursue her dream of writing, explaining that the Conan Doyle name was an [[albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] around her neck which has now been lifted.\n\nJonathan gives Emelia his laptop and encourages her to continue writing. She begins writing her novel using the laptop. One day, while having her work printed at a copy shop, she sees Beth (who is being driven to Oxford by Jonathan) wearing Emelia's \"I Put Out\" top. Emelia smiles and waves, but Beth only looks back coldly and quickly gets back into the car. In the car, Beth looks at her shirt and smiles. Emelia rides off on her bicycle with the printed draft of her novel titled \"Albatross\".\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast includes:\n\n*[[Jessica Brown Findlay]] as Emelia\n*[[Sebastian Koch]] as Jonathan Fischer\n*[[Julia Ormond]] as Joa Fischer\n*[[Felicity Jones]] as Beth Fischer\n*[[Peter Vaughan]] as Grandpa\n\n==Production==\n''Albatross'' is [[BAFTA]]-nominated director [[Niall MacCormick]]'s debut feature film and the first screenplay by Tamzin Rafn.<ref name=\"raunchy\">{{cite web |title='Albatross' Trailer Starring 'Downton Abbey's' Lady Sybil In Raunchy Role |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/08/03/albatross-trailer_n_917176.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=3 August 2011 |first=Sarah |last=Dean |accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news |title=Albatross: Watch the world exclusive trailer - video |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2011/aug/02/albatross-trailer-video |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=2 August 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"whatculture\">{{cite web|title=Edinburgh Film Festival 2011 Review: Albatross |url=http://whatculture.com/film/edinburgh-film-festival-2011-review-albatross.php |publisher=What Culture! |date=20 June 2011 |first=Adam |last=Whyte |accessdate=3 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010193921/http://whatculture.com/film/edinburgh-film-festival-2011-review-albatross.php |archivedate=10 October 2011 }}</ref> According to Rafn, the script was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by producer [[Marc Samuelson]] and CinemaNX about three weeks after her agent sent it out.<ref name=\"rafn\">{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview \u2013 Writer Tamzin Rafn Talks Albatross |url=http://www.heyuguys.co.uk/2011/10/11/exclusive-interview-writer-tamzin-rafn-talks-albatross/ |publisher=HeyUGuys.co.uk |date=11 October 2011 |first=Jamie |last=Nelsh |accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> It was then sent out to directors, some of whom Rafn met.
