The film is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men|superhero team of the same name]], created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and features an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[James Marsden]], [[Bruce Davison]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Ray Park]], [[Tyler Mane]], and [[Anna Paquin]]. The film depicts a world where an unknown proportion of people are [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], whose possession of [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman powers]] makes them distrusted by normal humans. It focuses on mutants [[Logan (film character)|Wolverine]] and [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]] as they are brought into a conflict between two groups that have radically different approaches to bringing about the acceptance of mutant-kind: [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Charles Xavier]]'s X-Men, and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], led by [[Magneto (film character)|Magneto]].\n\nDevelopment of ''X-Men'' began as far back as 1984 with [[Orion Pictures]], with [[James Cameron]] and [[Kathryn Bigelow]] in discussions at one point. The film rights were bought by [[20th Century Fox]] in 1994, and various scripts and [[film treatment]]s were commissioned from [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], [[Joss Whedon]], and [[Michael Chabon]]. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by [[Ed Solomon]], Singer, [[Tom DeSanto]], [[Christopher McQuarrie]], and Hayter, in which [[Beast (Marvel Comics)|Beast]] and [[Nightcrawler (character)|Nightcrawler]] were deleted over budget concerns from Fox. ''X-Men'' marked the Hollywood debut for Jackman, a last-second choice for Wolverine, cast three weeks into filming. Filming took place from September 22, 1999, to March 3, 2000, primarily in [[Toronto]].\n\n''X-Men'' premiered at [[Ellis Island]] on July 12, 2000, and was released in the United States on July 14. It was a box office success, grossing over $296.3{{nbsp}}million worldwide, and received generally positive reviews from critics, citing its performances, story, and thematic depth. The film's success led to a [[X-Men (film series)|series of sequels, prequels, reboots, and spin-offs]], with the overall success of the series helping spawn a reemergence of superhero films.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are between 400 and 700 words only-->\nIn 1944 [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]], 13-year-old [[Magneto (film character)|Erik Lehnsherr]] is separated from his parents upon entering the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. While attempting to reach them, he causes a set of metal gates to bend toward him because of his mutant ability to generate [[electromagnetism|magnetic]] fields, but is knocked out by the [[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde|guards]]. In the not-too-distant future, [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] attempts to pass a \"[[Discrimination against superheroes|Mutant Registration Act]]\" in [[United States Congress|Congress]], which would force mutants to reveal their identities and abilities. Present are Lehnsherr, now going by the name \"Magneto\", and his [[telepathy|telepathic]] colleague [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Professor Charles Xavier]]. Xavier sees Lehnsherr in attendance and is concerned with how he will respond to the Registration Act.\n\nIn [[Meridian, Mississippi]], 17-year-old [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Marie]] accidentally puts her boyfriend into a [[coma]] after she kisses him, because of her mutant ability to absorb the power and life force of others. Adopting the name \"Rogue\", she runs away to [[Alberta]], where she meets [[Logan (film character)|Logan]], also known as \"Wolverine\", a mutant who possesses superhuman healing abilities and metal claws that protrude from between his knuckles. They are attacked on the road by [[Sabretooth (character)|Sabretooth]], a member of Magneto's [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], but two members of Xavier's [[X-Men]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], arrive and save them. Wolverine and Rogue are brought to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's school]] for mutants in [[Westchester County, New York]], where Xavier tells Logan that Magneto appears to have taken an interest in him and asks him to stay while he investigates the matter. Rogue enrolls in the school.\n\nSenator Kelly is abducted by Brotherhood members [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]] and [[Mystique (character)|Mystique]] and brought to their hideout on the uncharted island of [[Genosha]]. Magneto uses Kelly as a [[Human subject research|test subject]] for a machine powered by his magnetic abilities that generates a field of [[radiation]], which induces mutations in normal humans. Kelly later escapes by taking advantage of his newfound mutation. Rogue visits Wolverine during the night while he is having a nightmare. Startled, he accidentally stabs her, but she is able to absorb his healing ability to recover. This is observed by fellow students who arrived to help. She is later convinced by Mystique, disguised as Rogue's crush [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Bobby Drake]], that Xavier is angry with her and she should leave the school. Xavier uses his mutant-locating machine [[Cerebro]] to find Rogue at a train station, and the X-Men go to retrieve her. Meanwhile, Mystique enters Cerebro and sabotages it.\n\nHaving left ahead of Storm and Cyclops, Wolverine finds Rogue on a train and convinces her to return to the school. Before they can leave, Magneto arrives, knocks out Wolverine and subdues Rogue, revealing it was her who he wants rather than Wolverine. Although Xavier attempts to stop him by mentally controlling Sabretooth, he is forced to release his hold when Magneto threatens the police who have converged on the train station, allowing the Brotherhood to escape with Rogue. Kelly arrives at the school, and Xavier reads his mind to learn about Magneto's machine. Realizing the strain of powering it nearly killed him, the X-Men deduce he intends to transfer his powers to Rogue and use her to power it at the cost of her life. Kelly's body rejects his mutation, and his body dissolves into liquid. Xavier attempts to locate Rogue using Cerebro, but Mystique's sabotage incapacitates him, and he falls into a coma. Fellow [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] and telepath [[Jean Grey (film character)|Jean Grey]] fixes Cerebro and uses it, learning that the Brotherhood plans to place their mutation-inducing machine on [[Liberty Island]] and use it to \"mutate\" the world leaders meeting at a summit on nearby [[Ellis Island]]. The X-Men scale the [[Statue of Liberty]], battling and overpowering the Brotherhood while Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue and activates the mutation machine. As Wolverine confronts and distracts Magneto, Cyclops blasts him away, allowing Wolverine to destroy the machine. He transfers his powers to Rogue, rejuvenating her while incapacitating himself.\n\nProfessor Xavier and Wolverine recover from their comas. The group also learns that Mystique escaped the island battle and is impersonating Senator Kelly, despite being seriously injured by Wolverine. Xavier gives Wolverine a lead to his past at an abandoned military installation in Canada. Magneto is imprisoned in a complex constructed of plastic and is visited by Xavier, and Magneto warns him that he intends to escape one day and continue the fight; Xavier replies that he will always be there.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Charles Xavier (film character)|Professor Charles Xavier]]: The founder of the [[X-Men]] and the [[X-Mansion|Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters]], who hopes for peaceful coexistence between mutantkind and mankind and is regarded as an authority on [[mutation|genetic mutation]]. Although restricted to a wheelchair, his mutant powers include vast [[telepathy]], which is amplified by the [[Cerebro]] [[supercomputer]] that he invented with Magneto's help.\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Logan (film character)|Logan / Wolverine]]: A Canadian roughhouser who has lived for fifteen years without any memory of his past, apart from his dog tags and an [[adamantium]]-encased skeleton. His powers include enhanced animal-like senses, an accelerated healing factor granting him virtual immortality (which makes his age impossible to determine), and three claws extending past the bridge of each knuckle.\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Magneto (film character)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: An [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] survivor who was friends with Xavier until his belief that humans and mutants could never co-exist led to their separation. His powers include the ability to generate powerful magnetic fields and a sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation, which he uses to attempt to mutate the world leaders to allow mutant prosperity. \n** Brett Morris plays young Erik Lehnsherr\n* [[Halle Berry]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: A [[Maasai people|Maasai]] woman who teaches calmly and caringly at Xavier's school but has become bitter with other people's hatred for mutants, sometimes making her hate humans in return simply because she is afraid of them. Her powers include the ability to manipulate the weather and create lightning storms.\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as [[Jean Grey (film character)|Dr. Jean Grey]]: The medical doctor of the X-Mansion and romantically involved with Cyclops. Her powers include [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]] and telepathy.\n* [[James Marsden]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: Xavier's second-in-command and an instructor at the institute who serves as the X-Men's field leader. He is seeing Jean Grey. His powers include a strong, uncontrollable red beam of optic energy produced from his eyes, which is only held in check by [[sunglasses]] or a specialized ruby-quartz [[visor]] enabling him to control the strength of the beam to fire when in combat.\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]]: An anti-mutant politician who is in support of using a Mutant Registration Act.\n* [[Rebecca Romijn]] as [[Mystique (character)|Mystique]]: Magneto's loyal second-in-command, who seems completely facile with respect to modern technology. Her powers include [[Shapeshifting|altering her shape]] and voice to mimmick any human being, and high agility.\n* [[Ray Park]] as [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]]: A very agile member of the Brotherhood. His powers include a prehensile tongue, a slimy substance that he spits onto others, and enhanced agility.\n* [[Tyler Mane]] as [[Sabretooth (character)|Sabretooth]]: A brutal and sadistic member of the Brotherhood. His powers include a ferocious, feline-like nature, enhanced animal-like senses, fangs and healing abilities similar to Wolverine's, and claws extending past the tip of each finger.\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Marie / Rogue]]: A seventeen-year-old girl forced to leave her home in [[Mississippi]] when she puts her boyfriend into a coma by kissing him. Her powers include absorbing anyone's memories, life force, and \u2013 in the case of mutants \u2013 powers through physical touch.\n\nAdditionally, [[Shawn Ashmore]] appeared in a minor role as [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Bobby Drake / Iceman]], a mutant student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters who takes a liking to Rogue. His powers include generating ice.\n\n[[David Hayter]], [[Stan Lee]], and [[Tom DeSanto]] make [[cameo appearance]]s. [[George Buza]], the voice of [[Beast (Marvel Comics)|Beast]] in ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'', appeared as the truck driver who drops Rogue off at the bar at which Wolverine fights.<ref name=\"hughes\">{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=David |title=Comic Book Movies |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |year=2003 |pages=177\u2013188 |isbn=0-7535-0767-6}}</ref> Other [[cameo appearance]]s include Sumela Kay as [[Kitty Pryde]], Katrina Florece as [[Jubilee (Marvel Comics)|Jubilee]], Donald MacKinnon as a young [[Colossus (character)|Piotr Rasputin / Colossus]] sketching a picture in one scene,<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comics2film.com/XMen.shtml |title=X-Men Archive |work=Comics2Film |access-date=August 9, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816035541/http://www.comics2film.com/XMen.shtml |archive-date=August 16, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Official Colossus/Daniel Cudmore thread |url=https://forums.superherohype.com/threads/the-official-colossus-daniel-cudmore-thread.192224/page-11#post-6663113 |access-date=December 27, 2020 |work=The SuperHeroHype Forums}}</ref> and Alexander Burton as [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|John Allerdyce / Pyro]].
