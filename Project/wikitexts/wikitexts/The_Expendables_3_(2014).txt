It is the third installment in [[The Expendables (franchise)|''The Expendables'' franchise]] and the sequel to ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' (2012). The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of stars including [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Jet Li]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Randy Couture]], [[Kellan Lutz]], [[Ronda Rousey]], [[Glen Powell]], [[Victor Ortiz]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].\n\nThe story follows the mercenary group known as ''The Expendables'' as they come into conflict with ruthless arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks, the Expendables' co-founder, who is determined to destroy the team. The film premiered in London on August 4, 2014<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/the-expendables-3-world-premiere-london/ | title= Ikon London Magazine World Premiere of Expendables 3 | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | date= August 5, 2014 | access-date= March 8, 2018}}</ref> and was released theatrically on August 15, 2014, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. Unlike the first two films in the franchise, ''The Expendables 3'' received a PG-13 rating instead of an R rating, which upset many fans of the franchise.<ref name=\"PG-13 2\" /> Partly due to negative critical reviews and being [[internet leak|leaked]] three weeks before its scheduled release, the film grossed $214 million worldwide on an estimated $90\u2013100 million budget, becoming the lowest-grossing film of the trilogy. A sequel, ''[[The Expendables 4]]'', is scheduled to be released in 2023.\n\n==Plot==\nThe Expendables\u2014led by Barney Ross and formed by Lee Christmas, Gunner Jensen, and Toll Road\u2014extract former member Doctor Death, a knives specialist, and team medic, from a military prison during his transfer on a train. They recruit Doctor Death to assist them in intercepting a shipment of bombs meant to be delivered to a warlord in [[Somalia]]. Arriving there, they reunite with Hale Caesar, who directs them to the drop point, where Ross is surprised to find out that the arms trader providing the bombs is Conrad Stonebanks, a former co-founder of the Expendables who went rogue and was presumed dead. In the ensuing firefight, The Expendables kill all but Stonebanks, who shoots Caesar. They are forced to retreat when Stonebanks drops a [[glide bomb]] on them from his helicopter, and Caesar is severely injured.\n\nBack in the United States, [[CIA]] operative Max Drummer, the Expendables' new missions manager, gives Ross a mission to capture Stonebanks to bring him to [[International Criminal Court|the International Criminal Court]] to be tried for war crimes. Blaming himself for Caesar's injuries, Ross disbands the Expendables and leaves for [[Las Vegas]], where he enlists retired mercenary-turned-recruiter Bonaparte to help him find a new team of younger mercenaries. The recruits include former U.S. Marine John Smilee, nightclub bouncer Luna, computer expert Thorn, and weapons expert Mars. Skilled sharpshooter Galgo asks to be included in the team, but Ross turns him down.\n\nThe four new team members rendezvous with Ross's rival Trench Mauser, returning a favor for Ross. Drummer has traced Stonebanks to [[Bucharest]], where he is set to make an arms deal. Ross and the new recruits infiltrate an office building Stonebanks is using and, having to kill a few men in the process including arms buyer Goran Vata, capture Stonebanks. In transit, Stonebanks taunts Ross and explains why he betrayed The Expendables.  Ross nearly kills him to shut him up but, despite Stonebanks egging him on, he stands down. Stonebanks' men catch up to them, with the aid of his [[GPS Tracker]], and fire a missile at the team's van. Ross is thrown into a river, while Smilee, Luna, Thorn, and Mars are captured by Stonebanks' crew. Ross kills Stonebanks' retrieval team and escapes.\n\nStonebanks sends Ross a video, challenging Ross to come after him and giving him his location in Azmenistan. While preparing to leave and mount a rescue alone, Ross is found by Galgo, who offers his services again. Ross accepts, later accompanied by the veteran Expendables. They rescue the young mercenaries, only to learn from Stonebanks that he has rigged the place with explosives with only 45 seconds left for them to explode. As both the young and veteran Expendables fight one another, Ross convinces them to work together to take down Stonebanks. As the final battle begins, Thorn uses a jammer device to delay the countdown, giving them just under half an hour before detonation. Stonebanks orders the Azmenistan army to attack the building with full force, including tanks and attack helicopters. Drummer and Trench arrive in a helicopter to help, alongside returning Expendables member Yin Yang.\n\nThe new and veteran members of the Expendables work together to kill Stonebanks' men. When a second wave moves in, Drummer lands on the building to evacuate the team. As everyone makes it to Drummer's chopper, Stonebanks personally attacks Ross after shooting him down. Having been forced to remove the armor and his weapon, Ross and Stonebanks engage in hand-to-hand combat. Both are evenly matched, but Ross knocks down Stonebanks before they both reach for their guns. Stonebanks shoots, but Ross gets the better of him. At his mercy, Stonebanks questions Ross about delivering him to the International Criminal Court. Ross coldly shoots Stonebanks in response. Seconds after Stonebanks' death, the batteries of Thorn's device run out, causing the building to explode and collapse. The team makes it to Drummer's helicopter and flies away to safety, as Ross clings to it from the outside. In the aftermath, Caesar recovers from his wounds, and Ross officially accepts Galgo, Smilee, Luna, Thorn, and Mars into the team. They all celebrate at a bar together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of The Expendables characters}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[List of The Expendables characters#Barney Ross|Barney Ross]] <br /> The leader of the Expendables.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=9}}\n* [[Jason Statham]] as [[List of The Expendables characters#Lee Christmas|Lee Christmas]] <br /> The team's knife expert, hand-to-hand fighter, and Second-In-Command.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=9}}{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=12}}\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Galgo <br /> A former member of the [[Spanish Armed Forces]], Croatian war veteran, and an expert sharpshooter.<ref name=\"CastBanderas\" />\n* [[Jet Li]] as Yin Yang <br /> The team's hand-to-hand combat expert, now working for Trench.{{Sfn|Production|2012|p=11}}\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Doctor \"Doc\" Death <br /> Doc, aka.

At the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], [[Sylvester Stallone]] announced that he was aiming for a [[PG-13 (Motion Picture Association)|PG-13]] rating for the film. Stating that albeit it was close to being rated R, he wanted to reach a younger and broader audience with the new film.<ref name=\"PG-13\" /> However, when Stallone first submitted the film to the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], they assigned it with the usual R rating and had to be trimmed down to be rated PG-13. On July 1, the MPAA granted ''The Expendables 3'' a PG-13 rating; the given description being \"violence including intense sustained gun battles and fight scenes and for language.\"\n\nSince its release, Stallone regrets the PG-13 rating, saying that it was \"a horrible miscalculation on everyone's part in trying to reach a wider audience but in doing such, diminish the violence that the audience expects. I'm quite certain it won't happen again.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/792031-interview-sylvester-stallone-promises-r-rated-expendables-4 |title=Interview: Sylvester Stallone Promises R-Rated 'Expendables 4\u2032 |website=[[CraveOnline]] |date=November 23, 2014 |first=Fred |last=Topel |access-date=January 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219054148/http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/792031-interview-sylvester-stallone-promises-r-rated-expendables-4 |archive-date=February 19, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Unauthorized duplication and distribution===\nOn July 25, 2014, three weeks ahead of the film's premiere, a [[DVD]]-quality [[Internet leak|illegal leak]] was downloaded, via [[Copyright infringement|file sharing]] sites, more than 189,000 times over a 24-hour period.<ref name=\"VarietyLeak\" /> After one week, it was estimated that the leak had been downloaded over 2 million times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/will-expendables-3-pre-release-piracy-hurt-box-office-revenue-1201271888/|title=Will 'Expendables 3' Pre-Release Piracy Hurt Box-Office Revenue?|first=Todd|last=Spangler|date=July 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 2014, the film's studio, [[Lionsgate]], filed a lawsuit in California federal court against ten anonymous individuals for copyright infringement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/lionsgate-sues-pirates-over-expendables-3-leaked-internet-copy-1201273600/|title=Lionsgate Sues Pirates Over 'Expendables 3' Leaked Internet Copy|first=Todd|last=Spangler|date=August 1, 2014}}</ref> The studio reported that one digital copy of the film was stolen and uploaded to the Internet.
