The team found the location, and started doing the 3D reconstruction using satellite imaging and their holographic technology.\n\nIn [[northwest China]], [[48 BC]] ([[50 BC]] on screen in the English version), a security, customs and peacekeeping company under [[Han China]]'s current government called [[The Silk Road]] Protection Squad is committed to stopping battles, customs clearing and peacekeeping on the Silk Road. Huo An (Jackie Chan), the captain, successfully averts a battle between Indians (Indo-Greeks) and Huns (Xiongnu), unwittingly disgracing the woman warrior. The squad returns to their unnamed home city with their pay and rewards, where Huo An's gentle [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] wife Xiuqing (Mika Wang) serves as a schoolteacher who teaches Chinese for orphans of multiple ethnicities. However, the government uncovers evidence that someone in the Squad is corrupt and accepting bribes, after Han soldiers found bribes among the corpses of enemies they neutralised, causing the entire squad to be sentenced to construction work at Wild Geese Gate, a ruined fortress situated on the fringe of the Western Protectorate, run by a Turkic auxiliary commander, and housing workers, peasants and prisoners of various ethnic groups busy rebuilding the fort. Once they arrive, the group pays respects at the shrine of a fallen Chinese general who was once commander of the Gate. They originally were child-slaves of Han descent and this general had later rescued them, especially Huo An, who were taken care of after rescuing him from the slavers, but not his younger sister. He stabbed the general, but the latter promised him that he can make peace with the ethnic groups in the Silk Road.\n\nNot long after, Wild Geese Gate is threatened by a [[Roman legion|legion]] from the [[Roman Empire]] in need of water and supplies and on the run, among which is a blind boy named Publius (Jozef Waite), youngest son of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], one of the triumvirs of Rome. The Wild Geese Gate commander tried to fight the Romans, but was defeated, and Huo An had an idea to stop the Romans. After a stalemated duel between Huo An and Lucius (Cusack) and Publius collapsing due to thirst, the Roman general agrees not to assault the city in return for his men being let inside, and be given ample supplies, despite the Wild Geese commander's protests. The legion uses its superior [[Roman engineering|engineering]] skills to speed up the construction work, an act which boosts the morale and happiness of the inhabitants, who are divided among several different ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Uyghurs, Indians, Xiongnu, Kangju, Huns, Parthians, Indo-Greeks, Sogdians, Scythians, Persians, Medes,  and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], overall 36 ethnic groups. Huo An returns the favor by sending men to assist Lucius's envoys in reaching the [[Parthian Empire]], giving them a pair of the Protection Squad as guards. A celebration is later held and Huo An is made an honorary centurion by Publius himself.\n\nLucius reveals that he and Publius are fleeing from Publius's brother Tiberius (Brody), a corrupt soldier who had murdered their father [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] in the midst of the [[Battle of Carrhae]], and blinded Publius so Tiberius could become consul, and also derailing the peace treaty Crassus tried to settle with the Parthians. As Tiberius approaches with 100,000 soldiers, Huo An insists on helping Lucius, pointing out that Tiberius is a threat to the Silk Road in its entirety, after receiving grave news that the messengers were captured and executed, including 2 of the Protection Squad members sent to guard them. Shortly after Huo An leaves to find reinforcements, the corrupt group member from earlier, revealed to be his second-in-command, sends Chinese soldiers to murder Xiuqing and attack Wild Geese Gate, the Roman general Lucius was betrayed by the traitor in his legion, the Roman legion routed, while the rest were spared. Huo An saved the kids with the help of the Huns, but his wife was mortally wounded when she tried rescuing one of her pupils in her class. At her dying breath, she made her husband promise that he will protect the orphans. The legion is imprisoned in the non-Chinese trading city of [[Kroran]], where Tiberius has chosen to camp. Captured, Publius and his tutor was forced to commit suicide by Tiberius.\n\nHuo An and the few loyal Chinese soldiers travel to Kroran, pretending to surrender, but once they are inside, they destroy the Roman legion's cages, while the traitor inside the Protection Squad tries to deal with Tiberius. Huo An is able to break into Lucius's special solitary cell, finding him tortured and bound, but is unable to free him. A fire breaks out, whereupon Lucius calls out to Huo An to 'take me home'. Huo An shoots Lucius with an arrow, [[mercy kill|killing him]] so that he doesn't have to suffer a slow [[death by burning]]. As Huo An's and Lucius's soldiers are surrounded, the armies of several other nations arrive and fight against Tiberius, including the Indians, Han, Uyghurs, and Turkics, all of whom are determined to preserve the Silk Road's safety. However, even their combined forces are unable to gain the upper hand, killing other members of the Protection Squad, the Wild Geese fortress commander and his translator, the tribal warriors and their chieftains until Tiberius saw another group coming towards them. The Parthian and the Roman emissary sent from earlier return with a massive host of Parthians, who had signed a special treaty with Publius's father Crassus, and who intend to avenge his memory. Tiberius's soldiers ceased attacking at once. The envoy asked the consul the reason why he did such a thing, while his tutor and right-hand man tried to entice him to surrender, but he killed him. Huo An challenges Tiberius to a duel and kills him.\n\nUpon hearing about the bravery of Lucius's legion, the [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Chinese emperor]] grants the Romans the right to establish their own city, which they choose to name Regum, Li Gan in Chinese, the Emperor too accepted the request of the inhabitants of the Wild Geese to join Huo An's Protection Squad. They accept Huo An as their commander, and Huo An, in turn, honors the deceased Roman general by relocating the shrine to that city. As the centuries go on, the city fades from [[collective memory]]. However, in the modern day, a team of Asian American archaeologists stumble upon the site and uncover the dual Chinese and Latin inscriptions, but the duo called nothing of the sort exists.\n\nHuo An, the Romans, and new members of the Protection Squad traverse the Silk Road for their peacekeeping mission once again.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Jackie Chan]] as Huo An (\u970d\u5b89),<ref name=\"\u5949\u65e8\u51fa\u5f81\"/> the captain of [[The Silk Road]] Protection Squad, a security company for the [[Han Dynasty]]\n*[[John Cusack]] as Lucius, a rogue [[Roman general]] who allies with Huo An against the [[Roman Empire]] and their emperor, Emperor Tiberius\n*[[Adrien Brody]] as Emperor Tiberius, the powerful, ruthless and bloodthirsty [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Roman Empire]] and the main antagonist of the movie\n*[[Lin Peng]]<ref name=\"actress\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jaynestars.com/movies/john-cusack-adrien-brody-join-jackie-chans-dragon-blade|title= John Cusack, Adrien Brody Join Jackie Chan's \"Dragon Blade\"| date=2014-06-18}}</ref> as Cold Moon\n*Mika Wang<ref name=\"actress\"/> as Xiu Qing (Huo An's Wife)\n*[[Choi Siwon]] as Yin Po\n*[[Xiao Yang (film director)|Xiao Yang]] as Captain\n*[[Wang Taili]] as Rat\n*Sammy Hung as Red Sun\n*[[Yoo Seung-jun]] as Cougar\n*[[Lorie (singer)|Lorie Pester]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themovieplanet.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/exclusive-french-singer-to-star-in-jackie-chans-next/|title=EXCLUSIVE: French singer to star in Jackie Chan's next|work=The Movie Planet|date=2014-06-30}}</ref> as a [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] Queen\n*[[Vanness Wu]]<ref>{{cite web|title=instagram|url = http://instagram.com/p/rBxsuxCXtC/?modal=true}}</ref> as Christian\n*[[Karena Lam]] as Karena\n*[[Feng Shaofeng]] as General [[Huo Qubing]] (Han Chinese General)\n*[[Sharni Vinson]] as Lady Crassus \n*Jozef Waite as Publius (The Roman Prince)\n*[[Philippe Joly]] as Decimus\n*[[James Lee Guy]] (''uncredited'') as Eugene\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Dragon Blade'' started on 15 April 2014 in [[Hengdian World Studios|Hengdian]], China with some battle scenes.
