He is a [[commodity broker|commodities broker]] whose shipment of cocoa beans is tied up by a Third World country's revolution. She is a woman with extravagant tastes who is still technically married to Larry, her first husband.\n\nThe two of them are so broke that when it comes time to pay for a dinner at the hotel, Jake hands a credit card to the waiter and prays that it won't be canceled. A pair of hotel executives, Mercer and Swayle, repeatedly make attempts to confront Jake and Tina about their growing unpaid bill.\n\nOnly one object stands between the couple and total insolvency. That is a tiny sculpture by Henry Moore that was given to Tina by her husband as a gift. But just as she and Jake hatch a scheme to pretend the object is stolen and collect the insurance on it, a deaf housekeeper, Jenny, decides to steal it for herself.\n\nAfter she steals it Tina and Jake get upset. Then Jenny's brother decides to take it and sell it, but nobody will buy it and he ends up losing it. Jake and Tina argues, he goes to Joan (Tina's best friend) and they end up sleeping together. Next day Jenny searches with her brother and find the statue in a heap of rubble. Jenny returns it then steals it again and when the insurance company comes she hands it over. Jake and Tina auction it off later and are able to resolve their debt with the hotel and continue to go on vacation.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Jake Bartholemew\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Tina Lesley Bartholemew\n* [[Lolita Davidovich]] as Joan\n* [[Rudi Davies]] as Jenny\n* [[Joss Ackland]] as Mr. Mercer\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Victor Swayle\n* [[Ricci Harnett]] as Steve\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Lawrence \u2033Larry\u2033 Oates\n* [[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]] as Mr. Slaughter\n* [[Rosemary Martin]] as Mrs. Doughty\n* [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] as Frankie\n* Andrew Hawkins as Gordon\n* [[Pip Torrens]] as Art evaluator\n* [[Stephen Churchett]] as Mr. Mundy\n* [[Annie Hayes]] as Housekeeper\n* Richard Ireson as Night porter\n* [[Barry J.
