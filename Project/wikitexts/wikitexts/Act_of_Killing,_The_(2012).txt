The genocide led to the killing of almost a million people, ostensibly for belonging to the local communist community. When [[Suharto]] overthrew [[Sukarno]], the President of Indonesia, following the failed coup of the [[30 September Movement]] in 1965, the [[Preman (Indonesian gangsters)|gangsters]] [[Anwar Congo]] and Adi Zulkadry in [[Medan]] ([[North Sumatra]]) were promoted from selling [[black market]] movie theatre tickets to leading the most powerful [[death squad]] in North Sumatra. They also extorted money from the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] as the price for keeping their lives. Anwar is said to have personally killed 1000 people.\n\nToday, Anwar is revered by the [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] of a paramilitary organization, [[Pemuda Pancasila]], that grew out of the death squads. The organization is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers who are openly involved in corruption, election rigging and clearing people from their land for developers.\n\nInvited by Oppenheimer, Anwar recounts his experiences killing for the cameras, and makes scenes depicting their memories and feelings about the killings. The scenes are produced in the style of their favorite films: gangster, [[Western (genre)|Western]], and [[musical film|musical]]. Various aspects of Anwar and his friends' filmmaking process are shown, but as they dig into Anwar's personal experiences, the reenacted scenes begin to take over the narrative. Oppenheimer has called the result \"a documentary of the imagination\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theactofkilling.com/statements/|title=STATEMENTS {{!}} The Act of Killing|website=theactofkilling.com|access-date=16 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome of Anwar's friends state that the killings were wrong, while others worry about the consequences of the story on their public image.\n\nAfter Anwar plays a victim, he cannot continue. Oppenheimer, from behind the camera, states that it was worse for the victims because they knew they were going to be killed, whereas Anwar was only acting. Anwar then expresses doubts over whether or not he has [[sin]]ned, tearfully saying he does not want to think about it. He revisits the rooftop where he claims many of his killings took place, and [[retching|retches]] repeatedly while describing how he had killed people during the genocide. The dancers from the film's theatrical poster are seen before the credits begin to roll.\n\n== Production ==\nIn 2001, while conducting interviews for their 2003 film ''The Globalisation Tapes'', Oppenheimer and Cynn began delving into the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966]]. After moving up the ranks of those involved with the killings, Oppenheimer's interviews led him to meet Anwar Congo in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|title=Making a 'Killing': Joshua Oppenheimer on the half-decade he spent filming for ''The Act of Killing''|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2013-08-09/making-a-killing/|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|access-date=19 December 2013|date=9 August 2013}}</ref> The film was shot mostly in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], between 2005 and 2011.
