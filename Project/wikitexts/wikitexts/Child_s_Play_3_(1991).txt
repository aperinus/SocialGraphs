The film is written by [[Don Mancini]] and directed by [[Jack Bender]]. [[Brad Dourif]] once again reprised his role as Chucky from the previous films while new cast members include [[Justin Whalin]], [[Perrey Reeves]] and Jeremy Sylvers. Although released only nine months after ''[[Child's Play 2]]'', the story takes place eight years following the events of that film, and one month before the events of ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' (which was made seven years later). It was executive-produced by [[David Kirschner]], who produced the first two ''Child's Play'' films.\n\nReleased on August 30, 1991, in the United States by [[Universal Pictures]], ''Child's Play 3'' received generally negative reviews from critics and [[Box-office bomb|disappointed at the box office]], grossing only $20.5 million worldwide against a budget of $13 million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How Much Did Child's Play Cost to Make? |url=https://screenrant.com/childs-play-movie-2019-budget-cost/ |access-date=October 25, 2022 |website=Screen Rant}}</ref>\n\nThe film became notorious in the United Kingdom when it was suggested it might have inspired the real-life murders of British children [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] and [[murder of Suzanne Capper|Suzanne Capper]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Panics|last=Thompson|first=Kenneth|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2005|isbn=9781134811625|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DOY92ztYG8C&pg=PA100}}</ref> suggestions rejected by officers investigating both cases.<ref>{{cite news|title= No conclusive link between videos and violence |work= [[BBC]]|date=1998-01-07|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/45302.stm|access-date=2011-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Video link to Bulger murder disputed |work= [[The Independent]]|date=1993-11-26|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/video-link-to-bulger-murder-disputed-1506766.html|access-date=2011-04-21|location=London|first1=Terry|last1=Kirby|first2=Jonathan|last2=Foster}}</ref><ref name=\"elstein\">{{Cite news|title=Demonising a decoy|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=22 December 1993|first=David|last=Elstein}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|title=U.K. Proposes Rules, Penalties On Rental Of Violent Videos|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|location=New York|date=23 April 1994}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nEight years after Chucky's [[Child's Play 2|second demise]], the Play Pals company resumes manufacturing Good Guy dolls and re-opens the abandoned factory.  A splash of blood from Chucky's [[corpse]] is inadvertently mixed in with the [[plastic]] being used to produce the dolls, [[Resurrection|reviving]] him in a new body. Chucky is given to Play Pals [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Mr. Sullivan. Chucky [[Asphyxia|strangles him to death]], then uses computer records to locate [[Andy Barclay]].\n\nNow 16, Andy has been sent to Kent Military School after he failed to cope in several [[foster homes]]. Colonel Cochrane, the school's [[commandant]], advises Andy to forget his \"fantasies\" about the doll. Andy befriends cadets Harold Aubrey Whitehurst; Ronald Tyler, an 8-year-old cadet; and Kristin da Silva, for whom he develops romantic feelings. He also meets Brett C. Shelton, a [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] [[lieutenant colonel]] who routinely [[Bullying|bullies]] the cadets.\n\nTyler is asked to deliver a package to Andy's room. Tyler realizes that the package contains a Good Guy doll and takes it to the cellar to open it. Chucky bursts from the package and is incensed to find Tyler instead of Andy, but remembering he can possess the first person who learns his true identity, tells Tyler his secret. Before Chucky can enact the ritual, Cochrane interrupts them and confiscates the doll, throwing it into a garbage truck. Chucky escapes by luring the driver into the truck's [[compactor]] and crushing him.\n\nThat night, Chucky attacks Andy and tells him his plans for taking over Tyler's body. Before Andy can fight back, Shelton comes in and takes the doll from him. Andy then sneaks into Shelton's room to recover it but Shelton awakens to confront him, only to find that Chucky has vanished. Suspecting the doll was stolen, Shelton forces all the cadets to do exercises as punishment. Chucky attempts to possess Tyler again, but they are interrupted by da Silva and fellow cadet Ivers. Later, a knife-wielding Chucky surprises Cochrane, unintentionally shocking him into a fatal [[heart attack]]. The next morning, Andy tries to convince Tyler that Chucky is evil, but Tyler refuses to believe him. Meanwhile, Chucky kills the camp barber Sergeant Botnick by slashing his throat with a straight [[razor]]. Whitehurst witnesses this and flees.\n\nDespite Cochrane's death, the school's annual [[Military simulation|war games]] are ordered to proceed as planned, with cadets divided between a \"Red Team\" and \"Blue Team\". Andy and Shelton are both on the Blue Team. Chucky secretly replaces the paint bullets of the Red team with live ammunition. When the simulation begins, Chucky gets Tyler away from his team. Finally realizing that Chucky is evil, Tyler stabs him with a pocket knife and flees to find Andy. Chucky then attacks da Silva and holds her hostage. Chucky forces Andy to exchange Tyler for da Silva. The Blue team and Red team arrive on the scene and open fire; Shelton is killed by one of the bullets fired by the Red Team. Tyler escapes in the chaos. Chucky tosses a [[grenade]] at the quarrelling cadets.  Whitehurst leaps on top of the grenade, sacrificing himself to save the others.\n\nChucky kills a security guard and kidnaps Tyler. Andy and da Silva pursue Chucky and Tyler into a [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted house themed]] [[roller-coaster]] at a nearby [[carnival]] called \"The Devil's Lair\". Chucky shoots da Silva in the leg, she tells Andy to go and face him alone. Andy manages to shoot off Chucky's left arm and in the chest which stops him from finishing the voodoo chant to possess Tyler. Before Tyler and Andy can leave, Chucky attacks Andy, but Tyler gives Andy his pocket knife, which he uses to cut off Chucky's right hand. Andy then throws Chucky down into a massive [[Fan (machine)|metal fan]] that is part of the attraction, shredding him to pieces and finally killing him, as Tyler and Andy watch from above. Later, Andy is taken away by the police for questioning while da Silva is rushed to the hospital as the carnival closes down while being unknown as to whatever happened to Tyler.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Justin Whalin at WonderCon 2009.JPG|thumb|upright|Justin Whalin portrays a 16-year-old Andy Barclay in ''Child's Play 3'']]\n* [[Justin Whalin]] as [[Andy Barclay]]\n* [[Perrey Reeves]] as Kristin da Silva\n*Jeremy Sylvers as Ronald Tyler\n*[[Travis Fine]] as Cadet Lieutenant Colonel Brett C.

It also was intended to open with a scene of a [[security guard]] portrayed by [[John Ritter]] frightening off a group of [[trespass]]ing children at the Good Guys factory by telling them scary stories about Chucky. After Mancini decided to make Andy Barclay 16 years old, he considered recasting the role with [[Jonathan Brandis]] before hiring Justin Whalin.

Costello. Just like ''Child's Play 2'', this novel had some of the author's own parts. In the beginning (unlike the film's), in the Play Pals factory, a rat scours for food and chews on Chucky's remains. Blood then leaks out of the remains and somehow leaks into another doll. Chucky's death in this book is also different. In the novel, Andy shoots Chucky in the chest and causes his body to fall to the floor, and watches his head shatter to blood, metal and plastic.\n\n==Release==\n''Child's Play 3'' opened in second place behind ''[[Dead Again]]'' to $5.7 million over the 4-day 1991 Labor Day weekend,  which the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called \"slow numbers\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Weekend Box Office : 'Dead' Enlivens Labor Day Business |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1991-09-04 |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-04/entertainment/ca-1695_1_weekend-box-office |access-date=2011-04-21 |first=David J. |last=Fox |archive-date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120091911/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-04/entertainment/ca-1695_1_weekend-box-office |url-status=dead }}</ref> It finished its theatrical run with $15 million in the US, and a total of $20.5 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=childsplay3.htm |title=Child's Play 3 |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=2020-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 23% based on reviews from 13 critics, and an average rating is 4.50/10, making it the poorest reviewed film in the series on the site.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/childs_play_3/ |title=Child's Play 3 (1991) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2021-09-11 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 27% based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Child's Play 3 |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/childs-play-3 |website=[[Metacritic]] |access-date=2021-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nChris Hicks of the ''Deseret News'' called it \"perverse\" and criticized the film's plot.<ref>{{cite news|title= Child's Play 3 |work= [[Deseret News]]|url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000308/Childs-Play-3.html|access-date=2011-04-21}}</ref>  Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the Chucky doll \"an impressive technological achievement\" but said the film \"misses the sharpness and dark humor\" of the [[Child's Play (1988 film)|original film]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Child's Play 3 |work= [[The New York Times]]|date=1991-08-30 |url =https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/30/movies/review-film-how-a-cute-little-killer-doll-turns-bad.html |access-date=2011-04-21 |first=Caryn |last=James }}</ref>  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it a \"noisy, mindless sequel\" with good acting.<ref>{{cite news |title= Child's Play 3  |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=1990-12-31 |url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789874 |access-date=2020-04-02 }}</ref> Richard Harrington of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"Chucky himself is an animatronic delight, but one suspects the film's energies and budget have all been devoted to what is essentially a one-trick pony.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/childsplay3rharrington_a0ab14.htm |title='Child's Play 3'|last=Harrington|first=Richard|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1991-08-30|access-date=2015-08-23}}</ref>  Stephen Wigle of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' called it \"fun for any fan of the slasher genre\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-08-30/entertainment/1991242112_1_chucky-justin-whalin-brad-dourif|title='Child's Play 3': Chucky's back--more amusing and disturbing than ever|last=Wigle|first=Stephen|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=1991-08-30|access-date=2016-03-03|archive-date=2016-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307205535/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-08-30/entertainment/1991242112_1_chucky-justin-whalin-brad-dourif|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSeries creator [[Don Mancini]] said that this was his least favorite entry in the series, adding that he ran out of ideas after the second film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/61803/chucky-the-complete-collection/|title=Chucky: The Complete Collection (Blu-ray)|last=Zupan|first=Michael|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=2013-10-11|access-date=2015-08-23}}</ref> He elaborated further in 2013 stating that he was not pleased with the casting, feeling Jeremy Sylvers was too old for the role of Tyler and Dakin Matthews was not the \"[[R.
