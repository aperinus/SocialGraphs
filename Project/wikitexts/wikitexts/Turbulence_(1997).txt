It was distributed by [[MGM Distribution Co.]]\n\n==Plot==\nRyan Weaver, also known as the Lonely Hearts Strangler, an accused serial killer and rapist, is arrested in [[New York City]] despite his claims of innocence. Even though police lieutenant Aldo Hines at one point broke protocol during the arrest (which later enraged Weaver), the authorities have enough hard evidence to have Weaver transported to [[Los Angeles]] to face trial. He and another prisoner, a bank robber named Stubbs, are escorted by four [[US marshals]] on a [[Boeing 747]]-200 on a commercial flight. Even though it is Christmas Eve, the 747 is nearly empty, with only eleven people on board.\n\nDuring the flight, Stubbs breaks free while using the bathroom and begins a shootout with the marshals. A stray bullet fired from one of the marshals' sidearms punches a hole in the fuselage, instantly triggering an [[explosive decompression]] before the hole is sealed with a [[briefcase]]. Amidst the chaos, the captain is fatally shot and the first officer dies when his head slams into the yoke, disengaging the [[autopilot]] in the process. Weaver frees himself and attempts to save the last remaining marshal, but fails when both Stubbs shoots the marshal dead, after being shot himself.\n\nWeaver appears to be horrified by the ordeal, increasing the passengers' trust in him. With the pilots dead, Teri Halloran, a flight attendant, makes her way into the cockpit and learns she is the only one left capable of keeping the 747 from crashing. To make matters worse, the plane is heading into a storm which threatens severe turbulence.\n\nWeaver's behavior becomes increasingly erratic since he is paranoid of being sentenced to death upon landing and occasionally suffers nervous breakdowns. He then locks the passengers in the crew's cabin then attacks and strangles Maggie, one of the other flight attendants, to death. Ryan reveals that he did in fact commit the murders that he's accused of, although he continues to insist that the evidence against him was planted by Hines. He then calls the [[FBI]] control center at [[LAX]] and threatens to crash the 747 into their facility since he is now willing to do anything to avoid being arrested. His motives had become clear to Teri after she speaks, via the aircraft's radio, with Hines.\n\nTeri must be instructed by radio from Captain Bowen how to reprogram the autopilot to land at LAX, but her task is complicated by Weaver's obscene and constant interruptions. After the plane barely survives turbulence during the storm, Weaver breaks into the avionics bay and smashes the [[Server (computing)|server]] running the primary autopilot software, rendering the first landing attempt unsuccessful, and forcing a last second [[go-around]]. It skims a rooftop Japanese restaurant and a multi-story parking garage, but regains the air. The plane's landing gear picks up a [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ford Ranger]] pickup, which hinders the next landing at LAX. The backup autopilot has now engaged, and Teri makes efforts to turn the plane around. The LAX airport chief sends an [[F-14 Tomcat]] to intercept the 747.\n\nTeri begs LAX not to have her shot down, insisting she can land the plane. Weaver breaks into the cockpit with an axe and tries to kill her, but the F-14 destroys the truck instead, shaking the 747 and giving Teri a chance to attack. Teri retrieves a .38 revolver that one of the marshals was forced to unload and turn over to the captain upon boarding, and, in the midst of Weaver's assault, manages to load a bullet that fell out of the marshal's pocket. She finally shoots Weaver through the head and kills him. Teri returns to the pilot's seat and with Bowen's radio assistance, safely lands the 747 using the autopilot. Despite Weaver's claims that he killed them all, the other crew and passengers are found alive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ray Liotta]] as Ryan Weaver\n* [[Lauren Holly]] as Teri Halloran\n* [[Catherine Hicks]] as Maggie\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Lieutenant Aldo Hines\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Rachel Taper\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Stubbs\n* [[Ben Cross]] as Captain Samuel Bowen\n* [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] as Brooks\n* [[John Finn]] as FBI Special Agent Frank Sinclair \n* Heidi Kling as Betty\n* Gordy Owens as Carl\n* [[Michael Harney]] as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Marty Douglas\n* [[Grand Bush]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal Al Arquette \n* Richard Hoyt-Miller as Deputy U.S. Marshal Riordan \n* Michael Francis Kelly as Deputy U.S. Marshal Green\n* [[J.
