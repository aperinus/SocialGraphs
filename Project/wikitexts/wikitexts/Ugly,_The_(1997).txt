He specifically asks for Dr. Karen Schumaker (Rebecca Hobbs), who has recently gained some notoriety from winning a case involving another serial killer. Simon is abused by Philip and Robert (Paul Glover and Christopher Graham), two orderlies at the asylum. When Karen arrives, she argues with the head of the asylum, Dr. Marlowe (Roy Ward), who believes she is getting involved in Simon's case for the publicity. As she is led to her first session with Simon, another patient named Marge (Darien Takle) warns Karen to watch out for \"The Ugly.\"\n\nSimon's backstory is explored through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. As a youth, Simon was the target of abuse by his mother ([[Jennifer Ward-Lealand]]). She drove away the only person Simon had ever cared about, Julie ([[Vanessa Byrnes]]), and had prevented his wealthy father from taking custody and giving him a better life. In response to this, Simon murdered his mother and, after an attempt to cover up the crime, was locked in an asylum for five years. Upon his release Simon killed over a dozen random people, including Julie. However, Simon spared the life of a teenaged deaf girl, recognizing that she was like him. Simon explains that it is \"the ugly\" that makes him kill; it will not leave him alone until he has satisfied its voice. Karen discovers that \"The Ugly\" is Simon's [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate persona]], and that he has psychic powers.\n\nAt the end, Simon kills Philip and Robert, escapes the insane asylum, and kills Karen.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paolo Rotondo]] as Simon Cartwright\n** Caelem Pope as Simon, aged 4\n** Sam Wallace as Simon, aged 13\n* Rebecca Hobbs as Dr. Karen Shumaker\n* Roy Ward as Dr. Marlowe\n* [[Paul Glover (actor)|Paul Glover]] as Philip\n* Cristopher Graham as Robert\n* Darien Takle as Marge\n* [[Jennifer Ward-Lealand]] as Evelyn Cartwright\n* Cath McWhirter as Helen Ann Miller\n* Vanessa Byrnes as Julie\n** Beth Allen as Julie, aged 13\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\nThe film received mixed reviews.
