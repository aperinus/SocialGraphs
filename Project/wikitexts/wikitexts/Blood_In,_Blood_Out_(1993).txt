They start out as members of a [[street gang]] in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]], and as dramatic incidents occur, their lives and friendships are forever changed. ''Blood In Blood Out'' was filmed in 1991 throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of Los Angeles and inside California's [[San Quentin State Prison]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1972, Miklo Velka is the 17-year-old son of a Mexican mother and a white father. After a violent confrontation with his abusive racist father, Miklo leaves Las Vegas for East Los Angeles, where he stays with his cousins, Paco and Cruz. His cousins are in the local Vatos Locos gang, and Miklo earns his membership during an attack on their rivals, the Tres Puntos. Tres Puntos retaliates by attacking Cruz, permanently damaging his back. When Vatos Locos counterattack the next day, Miklo shoots and kills Spider, leader of Tres Puntos. Fleeing the scene, Paco crashes their car and they are both arrested.\n\nThe cousins' paths now diverge: Miklo is imprisoned in [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] for murder, Paco volunteers for military service in the Marine Corps in lieu of prison, and Cruz continues his passion for art. Due to his back pain, Cruz develops a heroin addiction, leading to the accidental overdose of his 12-year-old brother, Juanito. After the Marines, Paco joins the [[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D]].\n\nMiklo finds San Quentin is run by three racially defined [[prison gang]]s. The Black Guerrilla Army (B.G.A.) is led by Bonafide, the Aryan Vanguard is led by Red Ryder, and La Onda is led by Montana Segura. Popeye, a high-ranking member of La Onda, tries to rape Miklo at knife-point, but is stopped by Montana, who finds Popeye's intentions dishonorable. Miklo learns that the only way into La Onda is by killing an enemy inmate. Miklo forms a rapport with Aryan Vanguard associate Big Al, then stabs him to death in the prison kitchen. Now initiated, Miklo rises through the La Onda ranks, eventually joining its Ruling Council.\n\nAfter serving nine years, Miklo is granted parole. On the outside, disgusted by his menial job (as well as theft and blackmail at the hands of his boss), Miklo joins in an armed robbery. The heist goes poorly and Miklo is intercepted by Paco, who tries to appeal to Miklo to surrender his weapon, so that he can help him out of the situation. Miklo instead starts to flee, and Paco then shoots him in the leg. The leg has to be amputated, and Miklo is sent back to prison.\n\nMiklo notices that cocaine use is now rampant, driven by competing supplies from the B.G.A. and Onda council member Carlos. The Aryan Vanguard want to partner with Carlos as his supplier, offering to help Carlos take B.G.A. out of the cocaine business. Montana, fiercely against La Onda being in the drug trade, warns that the Aryan Vanguard want to start a war between the Black and Chicano inmates. The Council votes in agreement with Montana, so Carlos and a few others leave La Onda to work with Aryan Vanguard.\n\nCarlos has his non-inmate brother, Smokey, bomb the B.G.A.'s drug supply hangout in the city. Carlos also kills \"Pockets\", who is running the B.G.A.'s operation in San Quentin. As Montana warned, the Aryan Vanguard then lets the B.G.A. murder Carlos.\n\nWith hostility high between the Blacks and Chicanos, Montana and Bonafide meet in the prison yard. Montana convinces Bonafide to agree to a truce if Montana reaches out to La Onda leaders in other prisons to end the violence. The warden grants Montana special permission to visit the prisons and Miklo is left in charge.\n\nMontana is granted a special request to have his daughter visit him at one of the prisons. Before she arrives, Montana is stabbed to death by a member of the B.G.A. Believing the Aryan Vanguard sent forged orders to the hitman, Paco arranges a peace conference between La Onda and B.G.A., but Miklo uses the talks to build an alliance with B.G.A. and plan the joint killing of Aryan Vanguard leaders. After the Aryan Vanguard are dead, Miklo's men promptly exterminate the B.G.A. leaders as well. A furious Paco confronts Miklo, disowning him forever.\n\nThe warden vows to split La Onda's ruling council by sending them to the prisons in other states. Miklo uses this to expand La Onda across the South West. It is later revealed that Magic, not the Aryan Vanguard, sent the forged orders to have B.G.A. kill Montana. This was set up by a reluctant Miklo, who clashed with Montana on the direction that La Onda should take for the gang's future. As Miklo destroys the evidence of their betrayal, Magic swears his life to Miklo as his jefe.\n\nBack in East Los Angeles, Paco visits one of Cruz' murals, showing a portrait of his former life. In a pep talk with Cruz, Paco realizes that by ordering Miklo to go after Spider, Paco is responsible for what Miklo has become. He ultimately forgives Miklo.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Damian Chapa]] as Miklo Velka\n* [[Jesse Borrego]] as Cruz Candelaria\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Paco Aguilar\n* [[Enrique Castillo]] as Montana Segura\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Bonafide\n* [[:de:Victor Rivers|Victor Rivers]] as Magic\n* [[Tom Towles]] as Red Ryder\n* [[Carlos Carrasco (actor)|Carlos Carrasco]] as Popeye\n* [[Theodore Wilson]] as Wallace\n* [[Raymond Cruz]] as Chuy\n* Geoffrey Rivas as Carlos\n* [[Valente Rodriguez]] as Frankie\n* [[Lanny Flaherty]] as Big Al\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Lightning\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Geronimo\n* [[Victor Mohica]] as Mano\n* [[Luis Contreras (actor)|Luis Contreras]] as Realthing\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Ivan\n* [[Richard Masur]] (''uncredited'') as Prison librarian\n* [[Thomas F.

Blood Out\u201d had its genesis in the early 1980s when producer [[Jerry Gershwin]] hired novelist [[Ross Thomas (author)|Ross Thomas]] to write the first script, which initially went into development at New Visions Pictures under director [[Harold Becker]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OpZBAAAQBAJ&q=blood+in+blood+in+ross+thomas&pg=PA218|title=Latino Image Makers in Hollywood: Performers, Filmmakers and Films Since the 1960s|last=Garcia Berumen|first=Frank Javier|date=April 14, 2016|publisher=McFarland Books|isbn=9780786474325|language=en|access-date=July 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nActor [[Edward James Olmos]] was offered to both direct and star in the film, but due to creative differences, Olmos turned down the project.

However, they were all loosely based on actual prison gangs, with the Aryan Vanguard, Black Guerrilla Army and La Onda representing the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], [[Black Guerrilla Family]], and the [[Mexican Mafia]], respectively.\n\nActor [[Theodore Wilson]] died shortly after filming his scenes in the film.\n\nArtist Adan Hernandez was hired to create the paintings the character of Cruz Candelaria was supposed to have painted. All of the paintings that were used in the film were created by him. A rumor circulated over the mural in the reservoir seen in the film's climax. Some believed that the mural has since been painted over. The truth, however, is the producers did not have permission to paint the mural on the reservoir wall. What the producers did was ask a local artist to paint the mural on plywood which they placed in front of the wall, giving the illusion that the mural was painted on the wall. The producers got the ok to leave the mural up for a few months after the movie release. The artist who painted the mural was allowed to take the painting down. The painting was disassembled into four parts. Adan Hernandez passed away on May 17, 2021, his family has the original painting. Hernandez made a cameo appearance in the film as the drug dealer Gilbert in the art gallery scene.\n\nThe film was shot in and around Los Angeles and [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] and inside the walls of [[San Quentin State Prison]]. The main character Miklo is sent to San Quentin, where much of the film's plot takes place. Several of the then-inmates appear in the film as extras. In addition, several of the prison staff members also appear as others and some facilitated the production of the film by serving as technical advisors. Many members of the staff were given small lines in the film, with the warden giving an extended cameo in a part that is somewhat integral to the plot. In addition, actor [[Danny Trejo]], who appears in the film as Geronimo, had served time in San Quentin before deciding to become an actor.\n\nIn addition to prison inmates and staff and artist Hernandez, screenwriter and barrio poet [[Jimmy Santiago Baca]] cameos as a prison inmate and member of the La Onda council.\n\nThe film was initially entitled ''Blood in Blood Out'', but was retitled ''Bound by Honor'' before the film's release. 'Blood in blood out' refers to the initiation ritual of having to kill someone to enter a gang and, on the reverse end, not being able to leave the gang unless killed. This is a common initiation in many gangs, including prison gangs, and is also the motto of La Onda in the film. [[Hollywood Pictures]] insisted on the name change as the studio felt that the original title might incite violence in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. In addition, executives at Hollywood Pictures, a division of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]], were concerned about the potential effect the 1993 film could have on Los Angeles following the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992|1992 LA Riots]], especially after the attribution that was given to ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' as a partial cause of or inspiration for the civil unrest. Director [[Taylor Hackford]] has stated that he was very unhappy with this decision, as the film's message was the exact opposite of the one that the studio feared could be transmitted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/03/taylor-hackford-hollywood-interview.html?m=1|title=Taylor Hackford: The Hollywood Interview|website=thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com|access-date=July 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Release ===\nIn early 1993, the film and its marketing campaign were given a week-long test run in three cities: [[Rochester, New York]], [[Tucson, Arizona]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], playing at two or three theaters in each city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-02-06-ca-969-story.html |title=Blood In, Blood In' Gets Mixed Results in Test Run : Movies: The marketing strategy with Taylor Hackford's new film, set in East Los Angeles, is a first for Hollywood Pictures, Buena Vista|date=February 6, 1993|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=July 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe picture was released nationally on thirty screens on April 30, 1993, but delayed in the Los Angeles markets until May 21, 1993, when the Rodney King civil rights trial verdict was to be handed down, the city feared a repeat of the 1992 riots following the acquittal of four Los Angeles Police Department officers charged with beating King.
