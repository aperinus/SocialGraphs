It is the second [[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man film]] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 16th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Jon Watts]], from a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]] and [[John Francis Daley]], Watts and [[Christopher Ford (screenwriter)|Christopher Ford]], and [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and [[Erik Sommers]]. [[Tom Holland]] stars as  [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]], alongside [[Michael Keaton]], [[Jon Favreau]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Zendaya]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Jacob Batalon]], [[Laura Harrier]], [[Tony Revolori]], [[Bokeem Woodbine]], [[Tyne Daly]], [[Marisa Tomei]], and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] In ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the [[Adrian Toomes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vulture]] (Keaton).\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the film rights for Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]. Principal photography began in June 2016 at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]], and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.\n\n''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' premiered in Hollywood on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] of the MCU. ''Homecoming'' grossed over $880{{nbsp}}million worldwide, becoming the second-most-successful Spider-Man film and the [[2017 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017]]. It received praise for the light tone, its focus on Parker's high school life, and the performances, particularly of Holland and Keaton. Two sequels have been released: ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019) and ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021). A new trilogy of live-action films from Sony and Marvel Studios is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nFollowing the [[Battle of New York (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Battle of New York]] in 2012,{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012).<ref name=\"AvengersTimeline\" />}} [[Adrian Toomes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Adrian Toomes]] and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the [[Damage Control (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Department of Damage Control]] (DODC), a partnership between [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons, including a flying [[Vulture (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vulture]] suit Toomes uses to steal Chitauri power cells.\n\nEight years later,{{refn|group=N|In November 2018, the ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' sourcebook adjusted the film's placement in the MCU timeline, ignoring the \"eight years later\" title card which was perceived to be a continuity error.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" /> See [[Marvel Cinematic Universe#Timeline|Marvel Cinematic Universe \u00a7 Timeline]] for more.}} [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] is drafted into the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] by Stark to help with an internal dispute in [[Berlin]],{{refn|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"CharacterGF\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantApril2017\" />}} but resumes his studies at the [[Midtown School of Science and Technology]] when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Parker quits his school's [[academic decathlon]] team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. His best friend, [[Ned Leeds (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ned]], eventually discovers his secret identity.\n\nParker comes across Toomes' associates [[Jackson Brice (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jackson Brice / Shocker]] and [[Herman Schultz (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Herman Schultz]] selling weapons to local criminal [[Aaron Davis (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Aaron Davis]]. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes in the Vulture suit and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.\n\nParker and Ned study a weapon Brice left behind, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to [[Maryland]], Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a DODC truck but is trapped inside, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, he races to the [[Washington Monument]], where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator. Parker saves them, including his classmate and crush [[Liz (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Liz]]. Days later, in New York City, aboard the [[Staten Island Ferry]], Parker captures Toomes' new buyer [[Mac Gargan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mac Gargan]] but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers and confiscates his suit as punishment for his recklessness.\n\nParker returns to his high school life, and asks Liz to go to the [[homecoming]] dance with him. On the night of the dance, he discovers that Toomes is Liz's father. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens him. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a DODC plane transporting weapons from [[Avengers Tower (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers Tower]] to the team's new headquarters. He leaves the dance, dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit, and races to Toomes' lair. Though he is ambushed outside by Schultz, he defeats him with Ned's help. Inside, Toomes attacks Parker, destroying the building's support columns, and leaves Parker to die, trapped in the rubble of the collapsed building. Parker escapes and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach near [[Coney Island]]. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes. Parker leaves Toomes for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away. Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time, and Stark proposes to [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]]. Stark also returns the Spider-Man suit to Parker, who puts it on just as his aunt [[May Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|May]] walks in.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison, saying he has heard that the latter knows Spider-Man's real identity, though Toomes denies this.<!-- Please do NOT add the Captain America PSA post-credit scene here per consensus on the talk page.

However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal that gave Marvel full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for a one-time payment of $175{{nbsp}}million to Sony and paying up to $35{{nbsp}}million for each future Spider-Man film rather than receiving their previous five percent of a Spider-Man film's revenue\u2014Marvel could now reduce their $35{{nbsp}}million payment if the co-produced film grossed more than $750{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"WSJDealNumbers\" /> Marvel Studios still received five percent of first dollar gross for the film.<ref name=\"FirstDollarGross\" /> [[Lone Star Funds]] also co-financed the film with Sony, via its [[LStar Capital|LSC Film Corporation]] deal,<ref name=\"SonyLSC\" /> covering 25 percent of the $175{{nbsp}}million budget,<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" /> while [[Columbia Pictures]] officially served as co-producer with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"ColumbiaPictures\" /> Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee.<ref name=\"ProducerFee\" />\n\nMarvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe since at least October 2014, when they announced their slate of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] films, with Feige saying, \"Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone. So we went forward with that Plan A in October, with the Plan B being, if [the deal] were to happen with Sony, how it would all shift. We've been thinking about [the Spider-Man film] as long as we've been thinking about Phase Three.\"<ref name=\"FeigeCraveApril2015\" /> [[Avi Arad]] and [[Matt Tolmach]], producers for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' series, were set to serve as executive producers,<ref name=\"THRFeb2015\" /> with neither director [[Marc Webb]] nor actor [[Andrew Garfield]] returning for the new film.<ref name=\"WebbGarfield\" /> Sony was reportedly looking for an actor younger than Garfield to play Spider-Man,<ref name=\"THRFeb2015\" /> with [[Logan Lerman]] and [[Dylan O'Brien]] considered front-runners.<ref name=\"LermanO'BrienFrontRunners\" /> In March 2015, [[Drew Goddard]] was being considered to write and direct the film,<ref name=\"GoddardDeadline\" /><ref name=\"GoddardTHR\" /> while O'Brien said he had not been approached for the role.<ref name=\"O'BrienDeny\" /> Goddard, who was previously attached to a Sony film based on the [[Sinister Six]], later said he declined to work on the new film as he thought he \"didn't really have an idea\" for it and struggled with the idea of working on a new film after spending a year working on the Sinister Six film and being in that mindset.<ref name=\"GoddardReason\" /> The following month, while promoting ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), Feige said the character of [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] would be around 15 to 16 years old in the film,<ref name=\"FeigeColliderApril2015\" /> which would not be an [[origin story]], since \"there have been two retellings of that origin in the last [thirteen years, so] we are going to take it for granted that people know that, and the specifics\".<ref name=\"FeigeCraveApril2015\" /> Parker's [[Uncle Ben]] is still referenced in the film,<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg1\" /> but not by name.<ref name=\"WattsScreenCrush\" /> There was some discussion to include a direct reference to Ben when Peter is getting ready for his [[homecoming]] by the revelation that his wardrobe consisted of Ben's clothes, but the writers desisted because they felt that the moment veered away from Parker's [[character arc]] and made Ben's death feel like a \"throwaway line\".<ref name=\"WritersAnswers\" /> Later in April, [[Nat Wolff]], [[Asa Butterfield]], [[Tom Holland]], [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]], and [[Liam James]] were under consideration by Sony and Marvel to play Spider-Man,<ref name=\"SpideyActors\" /> with Holland and Butterfield as the front-runners.<ref name=\"SpideyFinalists\" />\n\nIn May 2015, [[Jonathan Levine]], [[Ted Melfi]], [[Jason Moore (director)|Jason Moore]], the writing team of [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (filmmaker)|Jonathan Goldstein]], and [[Jared Hess]] were being considered to direct the film.<ref name=\"May2015Directors\" /> Butterfield, Holland, [[Judah Lewis]], [[Matt Lintz]], [[Charlie Plummer]], and [[Charlie Rowe]] [[screen test]]ed for the lead role against [[Robert Downey Jr.]], who portrays [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] in the MCU, for \"chemistry\".<ref name=\"THRCastingSecrets\" /><ref name=\"SpideyCastingCall\" /> The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the [[Russo brothers]]\u2014the directors of ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name=\"SpideyCastingCall\" /> Lintz would later be cast as [[Bruno Carrelli]] in the Marvel Studios [[Disney+]] series ''[[Ms. Marvel (TV series)|Ms. Marvel]]'' (2022).<ref name=\"LintzMsMarvel\" /> By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and [[Jon Watts]] also in consideration,<ref name=\"June2015Directors\" /> while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], who portrays [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]] in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite.<ref name=\"THRCastingSecrets\" /> On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man and that Watts would direct the film.<ref name=\"HollandWatts\" /> The Russos \"were pretty vocal about {{sic|who}} [they] wanted for the part\", pushing to cast an actor close to the age of Peter Parker to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background.<ref name=\"SpideyCivilWar\" /> Watts was able to read the ''Civil War'' script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film.<ref name=\"WattsScreenCrush\" /> He was able to \"see what they were doing with it\" and provide \"ideas about this and that\",<ref name=\"WattsJun2016\" /> including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like \"so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs\".<ref name=\"WattsScreenCrush\" /> On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said he was excited to explore the \"ground level\" of the MCU, a world where characters like the Avengers exist but have only been depicted in previous films at \"the Penthouse level of the Marvel world\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg2\" />\n\nBefore getting the job of director, Watts created images of [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] as Parker's mentor in the story in early \"mood reels\" saying, \"I don't know what the situation would be, but that would be a person he'd want to get in trouble with.\"<ref name=\"Fury\" /> Feige said the films of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that \"at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death\". He also said that the film hoped to use one of [[List of Spider-Man enemies|Spider-Man's rogues]] that have not [[List of Spider-Man enemies in other media#Film|been seen in film yet]],<ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> and that filming would begin in June 2016.<ref name=\"Filming\" /> In July 2015, it was reported that [[Marisa Tomei]] had been offered the role of [[Aunt May|May Parker]], Peter's aunt.<ref name=\"Tomei\" /> It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay,<ref name=\"DaleyGoldsteinScreenplay\" /> and were given three days to present Marvel with their [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]];<ref name=\"DaleyGoldsteinTHR\" /> both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay.<ref name=\"DaleyGoldsteinConfirm\" /> The pair had proposed a take on the character that was \"diametrically opposed\" to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a [[Wikt:laundry list|laundry list]] of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character rather than the \"drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man\". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well.<ref name=\"GoldsteinDaleyCS\" /> Daley said the film was about Parker \"finding his place\" in the MCU, with the writing team wanting the film to focus on him \"coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses\", such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the [[Washington Monument]]. Daley noted, \"Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie.\"<ref name=\"DaleyGoldsteinTHR2\" /> The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of [[Manhattan]] because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as \"the suburbs, on a golf course, the [[Staten Island Ferry]], [[Coney Island]], and even [[Washington, D.C.]]\" One of the first sequences they pitched was \"seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. ... you're familiar with the sort of areas he's been in, [so] why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven't seen before?\"<ref name=\"GoldsteinDaleyCS\" /> The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, \"low-stakes\" approach than previous films, which avoided having to explain why the Avengers were not helping, since a world-threatening problem would logically require the \"big guys\".<ref name=\"DaleyGoldsteinTHR2\" />\n\nMarvel encouraged Daley and Goldstein to express their own sense of humor in the script, with Daley saying, \"When you're seeing the world through the eyes of a fun, funny kid, you can really embrace that voice, and not give him the cookie-cutter one-liners that you're so accustomed to hearing from Peter Parker.\" Inspired by their experiences working on [[sitcom]]s, the writers also looked to create \"a network of strong characters\" to surround Parker with in the film.<ref name=\"GoldsteinDaleyCS\" /> In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a [[coming-of-age story]] to see the growth of Parker, citing ''[[Can't Buy Me Love (film)|Can't Buy Me Love]]'' (1987), ''[[Say Anything...]]'' (1989), and ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000) as some of his favorite films in that genre.<ref name=\"WattsOct2015\" /> It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations.<ref name=\"WattsJun2017\" /> Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and \"came to a new realization\" about the character's original popularity, feeling that he introduced a new perspective to the comics that had already established \"a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person's perspective on it\". He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU.<ref name=\"WattsScreenCrush\" /> Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane]]''.<ref name=\"WattsJun2017\" /> In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.<ref name=\"Scholl\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Jon Watts by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Watts promoting ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nWatts wanted to heavily pre-visualize the film, especially its action sequences, as he does on all his films. For ''Homecoming'', Watts worked with a team to \"figure out the visual language for the action sequences and ... try stuff out before\" filming began to help Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale films. For the \"web-slinging\" sequences, Watts wanted to avoid the big \"swoopy\" camera moves that had been previously used and instead \"keep it all as grounded as possible. So, whether it was shooting with a drone camera or a helicopter or a cable-cam, or even just handheld, up on a roof chasing after him, I wanted it to feel like we were there with him.\"<ref name=\"WattsJun2017\" />\n\nIn January 2016, Sony shifted the film's release date from July 28, 2017 to July 7, 2017,<ref name=\"NewReleaseDate\" /> and said the film would be digitally remastered for [[IMAX 3D]] in post-production.<ref name=\"IMAX3D\" /> [[J. K. Simmons]] expressed interest in reprising his role as [[J. Jonah Jameson (film character)|J. Jonah Jameson]] from [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' films]].<ref name=\"SimmonsInterest\" /> In early March, [[Zendaya]] was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker.<ref name=\"Zendaya2\" /><ref name=\"Zendaya\" /> The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear,<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016Collider\" /> He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with \"good faith\" in order \"to have more toys to play with as we put together a story\",<ref name=\"CharacterGF\" /> and that \"the agreement was that it is very much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. We are the ones hiring the actor, introducing him in [''Civil War''], and then working right now on the script and soon to be shooting.\"<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016Collider\" /> Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel.<ref name=\"RothmanJune2016\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] 2016, Sony announced the title of the film to be ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'',<ref name=\"VarietyTitle\" /><ref name=\"Homecoming\" /> a reference to the common high school tradition [[homecoming]] as well as the character \"coming home\" to Marvel and the MCU.<ref name=\"Homecoming\" /> [[Tony Revolori]] \u2013 who had auditioned for Peter Parker<ref name=\"RevoloriAudition\" /> \u2013 and [[Laura Harrier]] joined the cast as classmates of Parker's,<ref name=\"Harrier2\" /><ref name=\"Harrier\" /> and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark.<ref name=\"Downey\" /><ref name=\"DowneyConfirmed\" /> Watts noted that Stark \"was always a part of\" the film's story because of his interactions with Parker in ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"WattsJun2017\" />\n\nAlso in April, [[Michael Keaton]] entered talks to play a villain,<ref name=\"Keaton\" /> but dropped out of discussions shortly thereafter due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[The Founder]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"Keaton2\" /><ref name=\"KeatonNerdist\" /> He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film,<ref name=\"KeatonNerdist\" /><ref name=\"Keaton3\" /> and closed the deal in late May.<ref name=\"Keaton3\" /> [[Mark Hamill]] was interested in playing the film's villain in case Keaton turned down the offer, but Keaton reconsidered the offer in time.<ref name=\"MarkHamillVulture\"/> In June, [[Michael Barbieri (actor)|Michael Barbieri]] was cast as a friend of Parker's,<ref name=\"Barbieri\" /><ref name=\"BarbieriConfirm\" /> [[Kenneth Choi]] was cast as Parker's high school principal,<ref name=\"Choi\" /> and [[Logan Marshall-Green]] was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character,<ref name=\"MarshallGreen\" /><ref name=\"Mando\" /> while [[Donald Glover]] and [[Martin Starr]] joined the cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"Glover\" /><ref name=\"Starr\" /> Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as \"one of [the] most diverse places in the world\",<ref name=\"WattsJun2016\" /> with Feige adding that \"we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [With this cast] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue.\"<ref name=\"USATodaySDCC2016\" /> This is also different from the previous films, which were \"set in a lily-white Queens high school\".<ref name=\"FeigeDiversity\" /> Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous ''Spider-Man'' films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and [[Flash Thompson]]. This included the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', with co-producer [[Eric Hauserman Carroll]] saying, \"We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn't want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a ''Daily Bugle'', we want to do it in a way that feels contemporary\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg1\" /> This also included the character [[Mary Jane Watson]], but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials \"MJ\" as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is \"to have fun with [references] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic\".<ref name=\"FeigeDenOfGeek\" />\n\nSpider-Man's costume in the film has more technical improvements than the previous suits, including the logo on the chest being a remote drone, an [[artificial intelligence|AI]] system similar to Stark's [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]], a holographic interface, a parachute, a tracking device for Stark to track Parker, a heater, an airbag, the ability to light up, and the ability to augment reality with the eyepieces. Stark also builds in a \"training wheels\" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and \"pull[ed] out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did\" to include in the ''Homecoming'' suit.<ref name=\"IGNSpideySuit\" /> Spider-Man's web-shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of ''Civil War'', which Carroll explained allowed him to \"adjust the spray\" to different settings like the spinning web, web ball, or ricochet web. He compared this to a [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR]] camera.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg1\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 20, 2016,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Summer of George''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Salvatore Totino]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"SalvatoreTotino\" /> Filming also took place in [[Atlanta]], with locations including [[Henry W. Grady High School|Grady High School]],<ref name=\"Grady\" /> [[Downtown Atlanta]],<ref name=\"Downtown\" /> the [[Atlanta Marriott Marquis]],<ref name=\"MarriottMarquis\" /> [[Piedmont Park]], the [[Georgia World Congress Center]],<ref name=\"AJCJuly2017\" /> and the [[West End, Atlanta|West End]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg3\" /> Holland said building New York sets in Atlanta was cheaper than actually filming in New York, a location closely associated with the character, though the production may \"end up [in New York] for one week or two\".<ref name=\"HollandSuperHeroHype\" /> A replica of the Staten Island Ferry was built in Atlanta, with the ability to open and close in half in 10 to 12 seconds and be flooded with 40,000 gallons of water in 8 seconds.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Additional filming also occurred at two [[magnet schools]] in the [[Van Nuys]] and [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]] neighborhoods of Los Angeles.<ref name=\"LASchools\" />\n\nCasting continued after the start of production, with the inclusion of [[Isabella Amara]], [[Jorge Lendeborg Jr.]], [[J. J. Totah]],<ref name=\"Trio\" /> [[Hannibal Buress]],<ref name=\"Buress\" /> [[Selenis Leyva]],<ref name=\"Leyva\" /> [[Abraham Attah]],<ref name=\"Attah\" /> [[Michael Mando]],<ref name=\"Mando\" /> [[Tyne Daly]],<ref name=\"Daly\" /> [[Garcelle Beauvais]], [[Tiffany Espensen]],<ref name=\"BeauvaisEspensen\" /> and [[Angourie Rice]] in unspecified roles,<ref name=\"Rice\" /> with [[Bokeem Woodbine]] joining as an additional villain.<ref name=\"Woodbine\" /> At [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2016, Marvel confirmed the castings of Keaton, Zendaya, Glover, Harrier, Revolori, Daly, and Woodbine, while revealing Zendaya, Harrier, and Revolori's roles as Michelle, [[Liz Allan]], and Flash Thompson, respectively,<ref name=\"EWCastnames\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"USATodaySDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> and announcing the casting of Jacob Batalon as Ned.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"IGNNedLeeds\" /> It was also revealed that the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] would be the film's villain, while the writing teams of Watts and [[Christopher Ford (screenwriter)|Christopher Ford]], and [[Chris McKenna (writer)|Chris McKenna]] and [[Erik Sommers]], joined Goldstein and Daley in writing the screenplay,<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> from Goldstein and Daley's story.<!-- This is sourced by the billing block of the poster. A third party source should be added if found. --> Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the [[Marvel One-Shot]] films, did uncredited work on the film as well.<ref name=\"Pearson\" /> Watts praised Goldstein and Daley's drafts as \"really fun and funny\", and said that they \"sort of established the broad strokes of the movie\", with him and Ford, close friends since childhood, then re-writing the script based on specific ideas that Watts had and things that he wanted to film, which he said was a \"pretty substantial structural pass, rearranging things and building it into the sort of story arc we wanted it to be.\" McKenna and Sommers then joined the film to deal with changes to the script during filming, as \"it's all a little bit flexible when you get to set. You try things out, and you just need someone to be writing while you're shooting.\"<ref name=\"WattsJun2017\" />\n\nHarrier noted that the young actors in the film \"constantly refer to ourselves as ''The Breakfast Club''\".<ref name=\"EWCastnames\" /> Shortly after, [[Martha Kelly]] joined the cast in an unspecified role.<ref name=\"Kelly\" /> In August, [[Michael Chernus]] was cast as [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Phineas Mason / Tinkerer]],<ref name=\"Chernus\" /> while [[Jona Xiao]] joined the cast in an unspecified role,<ref name=\"Xiao\" /> and Buress said he was playing a gym teacher.<ref name=\"Buress2\" /> By September 2016, [[Jon Favreau]] was reprising his role as [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] from the ''Iron Man'' series,<ref name=\"Favreau\" /> and filming concluded in Atlanta and moved to New York City. Locations in the latter area included [[Astoria, Queens]], [[St. George, Staten Island]], [[Manhattan]],<ref name=\"NewYorkFilming\" /><ref name=\"NewYorkFilming2\" /><ref name=\"NewYorkFilming3\" /> and [[Franklin K. Lane High School]] in [[Brooklyn]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg1\" /> Additionally, [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter [[Tyron Woodley]] said he had been considered for a villain role in the film, but had to drop out due to a prior commitment with [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]].<ref name=\"Woodley\" /> Principal photography [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on October 2, 2016, in New York City,<ref name=\"FilmingWrap\" /> with some additional filming taking place later in the month in Berlin, Germany, near the [[Brandenburg Gate]].<ref name=\"Berlin\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn November 2016, Feige confirmed that Keaton would play Adrian Toomes / Vulture,<ref name=\"USATodayDec2016\" /><ref name=\"KeatonIsVulture\" /> while Woodbine was revealed as [[Shocker (comics)|Herman Schultz / Shocker]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitPg2\" /><ref name=\"Shocker\" /> In March 2017, Harrier said the film was undergoing re-shoots,<ref name=\"Reshoots\" /> and Evans was set to appear as Steve Rogers / Captain America in an instructional fitness video.<ref name=\"EvansCameo\" /> Watts was inspired by [[The President's Challenge|The President's Fitness Challenge]] for this, feeling that Captain America would be the obvious version of that for the MCU. He then started brainstorming other [[public service announcement]]s (PSA) starring Captain America, about \"just anything you could think of, we had poor Captain America do it\". Watts said that many of the additional PSA videos would be featured on the home media of the film.<ref name=\"CapVideos\" /> According to Goldstein, additional videos featuring other [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]] were planned at some point.<ref name=\"AdditionalEducationalVideos\" /> Watts confirmed that the company Stark creates that leads Toomes on his villainous path in the film is [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]], which Watts felt \"just fit in with our overall philosophy with the kind of story we wanted to tell\" and created a lot of practical questions Watts wanted to use \"to drive the story\".<ref name=\"DamageControl\" />\n\nThe film features multiple [[post-credit scene]]s.<ref name=\"DamageControl\" /><ref name=\"PostCreditScenes\" /> The first gives the Vulture a chance at redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this \"was a really interesting thing in the development of the story. You couldn't just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family.\" The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience\u2014a [[Meta-reference|meta-referential]] joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes2\" /> This was a \"last-minute addition\" to the film.<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes3\" /> Watts completed work on ''Homecoming'' at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, \"You assume you'll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn't really ever run into that. I got to do kind of everything I wanted to.\"<ref name=\"WattsJun2017\" /> That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school,<ref name=\"StarrRole\" /> and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.<ref name=\"MarshallGreenShocker\" />\n\nIn July, Feige discussed specific moments in the film, including an homage to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' [[If This Be My Destiny...!|issue 33]] where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige \"wanted to see in a movie for a long, long time\".<ref name=\"FeigeFandangoJul2017\" /> Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, \"We have [Parker] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem.\"<ref name=\"DaleyGoldsteinTHR2\" /> Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, \"What does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique.\"<ref name=\"FeigeCBJul2017\" /> Goldstein added that it \"diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [and] lets her become part of what's really his life.\"<ref name=\"DaleyGoldsteinTHR2\" /> Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, feeling that if it did not work, the film would not work. The team \"worked backwards and forwards from that moment ... You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [and it] doesn't seem like something out of left field\".<ref name=\"FeigeFandangoJul2017\" /> Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, \"more than anything else, [what] I was looking forward to, and I got to have a lot of fun shooting that stuff\".<ref name=\"PostCreditScenes2\" /> Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were \"giddy when we first came up with [that twist], because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time.\"<ref name=\"DaleyGoldsteinTHR2\" />\n\n==== Visual effects ====\n[[File:Grand Central Terminal VFX in Spider-Man Homecoming.jpg|thumb|right|Trixter used a [[LIDAR]] scan of [[Grand Central Terminal]] from ''The Avengers'' to help create their CGI version (bottom), adding to the elements filmed on set (top).<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" />]]\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v7wmDpszJw Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Homecoming End Credits Final Main on End Title Sequence] presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, [[YouTube]] video from [[Perception (visual effects company)|Perception]]'s channel}}\nVisual effects for the film were completed by [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]], [[Luma Pictures]], [[Digital Domain]], [[Cantina Creative]], Iloura, Trixter,<ref name=\"VFXVendors\" /> and [[Method Studios]].<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Executive producer [[Victoria Alonso]] initially did not want Imageworks, which worked on all previous Spider-Man films, to work on ''Homecoming'', in order to give it a different look than those earlier films.

They also worked on both Spider-Man suits and the spider tracer. Trixter created additional salvage workers to populate the Grand Central scene, whose clothes and proportions were able to be altered to create variation. For the battle between Parker and Schultz, Trixter used an all-digital Spider-Man in his homemade suit, which came from Imageworks, with Trixter applying a rigging, muscle, and cloth system to it \"to mimic the appearance of the rather loose training suit\". They also created the effects for Schultz's gauntlets and had to change the setting from the Atlanta set to Queens, by using a CGI school and adding 360 degrees of matte paintings for the mid to far-distance elements. Trixter received concept art and basic geometry that was used previously for the Avengers compound, but ended up remodeling it for the way it appears in ''Homecoming''. Models and textures for Spider-Man's Avengers costume were created by [[Framestore]] for use in a future MCU film, with Trixter creating the vault that it appears in. Trixter VFX supervisor Dominik Zimmerle said the idea was \"to have a clean, high tech, presentation Vault for the new suit. It should appear distinctively 'Stark' originated\".<ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" />\n\nDigital Domain worked on the Staten Island Ferry battle, creating the CGI versions of Spider-Man, the Vulture suit, Iron Man, and Spider-Man's drone. Digital Domain was able to [[LIDAR]] an actual Staten Island Ferry, as well as the version created on set, to help with creating their digital version.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Lou Pecora, visual effects supervisor at Digital Domain, called that sequence \"brutal\" because \"the way they were shot, it was lit to be a certain time of day, and afterwards it was decided to change that time of day.\"<ref name=\"CNETVFX\" /> Sony Pictures Imageworks created much of the third act of the film when Parker confronts Toomes on the plane and beach in his homemade suit, and Toomes is in an upgraded Vulture suit. Some elements of Vulture's first suit were shared with Imageworks, but the remainder were created by them \"based on a maquette\". For the plane's cloaking ability, Imageworks was inspired by [[Adaptiv]] IR Camouflage tank cloaking system by [[BAE Systems]], which \"uses a series of titles to cloak against infrared\". For their web design, which was based on the one created for ''Civil War'', Digital Domain referenced polar bear hair because of its translucent nature. Imageworks also looked to the ''Civil War'' webs, as well as to those they had created for previous Spider-Man films, in which \"the web[s] had [...] tiny barbs that aided in hooking on to things.\" For this film, they \"dialed back the barbs\" to line up more closely with the other web designs created for this film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Method Studios worked on the Washington Monument sequence.<ref name=\"THRVFXAug2017\" /> Iron Man's armor in the film, the Mark XLVII, is a recolored version of the MK XLVI armor introduced in ''Civil War''; this was done because Sony did not have the budget to create a new Iron Man suit. Feige requested the color scheme resemble the [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Ultimate Iron Man]] armor from the comics.<ref name=\"IronManArmor\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Spider-Man: Homecoming (soundtrack)}}\nWhile promoting ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' in early November 2016, Feige accidentally revealed that [[Michael Giacchino]], who composed the music for that film, would compose the score for ''Homecoming'' as well. Giacchino soon confirmed this himself.<ref name=\"Giacchino\" /> Recording for the soundtrack began on April 11, 2017.<ref name=\"SoundtrackRecording\" /> The score includes the [[Spider-Man (theme song)|theme]] from the [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|1960s animated series]].<ref name=\"1960sThemeSong\" /> The soundtrack was released by [[Sony Masterworks]] on July 7, 2017.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nWatts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya appeared at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film,<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\" /> which also had a panel at [[Comic Con Experience]] 2016.<ref name=\"CCXPPanel\" /> The first trailer for ''Homecoming'' premiered on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on December 8, 2016,<ref name=\"Kimmel\" /> and was released online alongside an international version, which Feige thought was different enough that \"it would be fun for people to see both.\"<ref name=\"USATodayDec2016\" /> The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con and \"was never meant to be in the movie\", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together, and existing shots \"just didn't look that great\" then. The trailer shot used a background plate taken when filming the subway in Queens.<ref name=\"WattsScreenCrush\" /> The two trailers were viewed over 266 million times globally within a week.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" />\n\nOn March 28, 2017, a second trailer debuted after screening at CinemaCon 2017 the night before.<ref name=\"CinemaCon2017Trailer\" /> Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice.com]]'', noted that the new ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' trailer had received more [[Twitter]] mentions in that week but there was \"clearer enthusiasm for ''Spider-Man''\". The ''Homecoming'' trailer was second for the week of March 20\u201326 in new conversations (85,859) behind ''Justice League'' (201,267), according to [[comScore]]'s PreAct service, which is \"a tracking service utilizing social data to create context of the ever-evolving role of digital communication on feature films\".<ref name=\"TrailerSocialMedia\" /> An exclusive clip from the film was seen during the [[2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards]].<ref name=\"MTVAwardsClip\" /> On May 24, Sony and Marvel released a third domestic and international trailer.<ref name=\"ThirdTrailersAndPosters\" /> Ethan Anderton of [[/Film]] enjoyed both trailers, stating ''Homecoming'' \"has the potential to be the best Spider-Man movie yet. Having the webslinger as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe just feels right\".<ref name=\"/FilmThirdTrailers\" /> [[TechCrunch]]'s Darrell Etherington agreed, saying, \"You may have feelings about a tech-heavy Spider-Man suit or other aspects of this interpretation of the character, but it's still shaping up to be better than any Spider-Man depicted in movies in recent memory.\"<ref name=\"TechCrunchThirdTrailers\" /> Ana Dumaraog for ScreenRant said the second trailer \"arguably showed too much of the movie's overarching narrative\", but the third \"perfectly shows the right amount of new and old footage\". She also appreciated the attention to detail that Watts and the writers put into the film, as highlighted by the trailers.<ref name=\"ScreenRantThirdTrailers\" /> Siddhant Adlakha of Birth.Movies.Death also felt the trailers were giving away too many details,<ref name=\"BMDPosters\" /> but enjoyed them overall, especially the \"[[Video blog|vlogging]]\" aspect.<ref name=\"BMDThirdTrailers\" /> [[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Dave Trombore expressed similar sentiments to Adlakha.<ref name=\"ColliderThirdTrailers\" /> After the trailers' release, comScore and its PreAct service noted ''Homecoming'' was the top film for new social media conversations, that week and the week of May 29.<ref name=\"comScoreThirdTrailers\" /><ref name=\"comScoreMay29\" />\n\nAlongside the release of the third trailers were domestic and international release posters.<ref name=\"ThirdTrailersAndPosters\" /> The domestic poster was criticized for its \"floating head\" style,<ref name=\"BMDPosters\" /><ref name=\"GameSpotDomesticPoster\" /> which offers \"a chaotic mess of people looking in different directions, with little sense of what the film will deliver\".<ref name=\"GameSpotDomesticPoster\" /> Dan Auty for [[GameSpot]] called it a \"star studded hot mess\",<ref name=\"GameSpotDomesticPoster\" /> while ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}}s Katey Rich felt the poster was \"too bogged down by the many different threads of the Marvel universe to highlight anything that's made ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' seem special so far\".<ref name=\"VanityFairDomesticPoster\" /> Adlakha felt the posters released for the film \"have been alright thus far, but these ones probably tell general audiences to expect a very bloated movie\". Adlakha was more positive of the international poster, which he felt was more \"comicbook-y\" and \"looks like it could be an actual scene from the film\".<ref name=\"BMDPosters\" /> Both Rich and Adlakha criticized the fact that Holland, Keaton, and Downey appeared twice on the domestic poster, both in and out of costume.<ref name=\"BMDPosters\" /><ref name=\"VanityFairDomesticPoster\" /> Sony partnered with [[ESPN]] CreativeWorks to create cross-promotional television ads for ''Homecoming'' and the [[2017 NBA Finals]], which were filmed by Watts. The ads were made to \"weave in a highlight from the game just moments\" after it occurred.<ref name=\"NBAFinalsSpot4EW\" /> The promos see Holland, Downey Jr., and Favreau reprise their roles from the film, with cameo appearances from [[Stan Lee]], [[DJ Khaled]], [[Tim Duncan]], [[Magic Johnson]], and [[Cari Champion]].<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" /> Through June and July 2017, a ''Homecoming''-inspired cafe opened in the [[Roppongi Hills]] complex in [[Tokyo]], offering \"arachnid-themed foods and drinks, including a Spider Curry, Spider-Sense Latte and a sweet and refreshing Strawberry Spider Squash drink\", as well as a free, limited-edition sticker with any purchase.<ref name=\"TokyoCafe\" />\n\nFor the week ending on June 11, comScore and its PreAct service noted that new social media conversations for the film were second only to ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' and its new trailer;<ref name=\"comScoreJune11\" /> ''Homecoming'' was then the number one film in the next two weeks.<ref name=\"comScoreJune18\" /><ref name=\"comScoreJune25\" /> That month, Sony released a [[mobile app]] allowing users to \"access\" Parker's phone and \"view his photos, videos, text messages, and hear voicemails from his friends\". The app also provided an \"AR Suit Explorer\" to learn more about the technology in the Spider-Man suit, and use photo filters, [[GIF]]s, and stickers of the character.<ref name=\"MobileApp\" /> Sony and [[Dave & Buster's]] also announced an arcade game based on the film, playable exclusively at Dave & Buster's locations.<ref name=\"Dave&Busters\" /> A tie-in comic, ''Spider-Man: Homecoming Prelude'', was released on June 20, collecting two prelude issues.<ref name=\"TieInComic\" /> On June 28, in partnership with Thinkmodo, a promotional prank was released in which Spider-Man (stuntman Chris Silcox) dropped from the ceiling in a coffee shop to scare customers; the video also featured a cameo appearance from Lee.<ref name=\"CoffeeShopPrank\" /> Sony also partnered with the mobile app Holo to let users add 3D holograms of Spider-Man, with Holland's voice and lines from the film, to real-world photos and videos.<ref name=\"HoloApp\" /> Before the end of June, ''Spider-Man: Homecoming\u2014Virtual Reality Experience'' was released on the [[PlayStation VR]], [[Oculus Rift]], and [[HTC Vive]] for free, produced by Sony Pictures VR and developed by CreateVR. It allows users to experience how it feels to be Spider-Man, with the ability to hit targets with his web-shooters and face off against the Vulture. It was also available at select [[Cinemark Theatres]] in the United States and at the [[CineEurope]] [[trade show]] in Barcelona.<ref name=\"VRExperience\" />\n\nAhead of the film's release, for the week ending on July 2, the film was the top film for the third consecutive week for new social media conversations, according to comScore, which also noted that ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' had produced a total of 2.67 million conversations to date.<ref name=\"comScoreJuly2\" /> Other promotions included [[Audi]] and [[Dell]] (both also had product placement in the film), [[Pizza Hut]], [[General Mills]], [[Synchrony Bank]], [[Movietickets.com]], [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]], [[Baskin Robbins]], [[Dunkin' Donuts]], [[Danone#Waters|Danone Waters]], [[Panasonic|Panasonic Batteries]], [[M&M's]], [[Mondelez]], [[Asus]], Bimbo, [[Jetstar]], [[KEF (manufacturer)|KEF]], [[Kellogg's]], Lieferheld, [[PepsiCo]], Plus, [[Roady (Mousquetaires)|Roady]], [[Snickers]], [[Sony Mobile]], [[OPPO Electronics|Oppo]], [[Optus]], and [[Doritos]]. Watts directed a commercial for Dell's marketing efforts as well, which earned 2.8 million views online. Goodwill hosted a build-your-own Spider-Man suit contest, with the winner attending the film's premiere. Overall, the campaign generated over $140 million in media value, greater than those for all previous Spider-Man films and Marvel Studios' first 2017 release, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''. This does not include merchandising for the film, which is controlled by Marvel and Disney.<ref name=\"DeadlineMarketingValue\" /> Marketing of the film in China included partnering with [[Momo (software)|Momo]], [[iQiyi]], [[Tencent QQ]], [[Baidu]], Mizone, [[CapitaLand]], [[Xiaomi]], [[HTC]], and corporate parent [[Sony]].<ref name=\"DeadlineChinaOpening\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineChinaOpening2\" /> To help target the teenage audience, Holland \"recorded a high school entrance exam greeting\" while ''[[The Rap of China]]'' contestant PG One recorded a theme song.<ref name=\"DeadlineChinaOpening\" />\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical ===\n[[File:World premiere of Spider-Man Homecoming at TCL Chinese Theatre.jpg|thumb|The world premiere of ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' at [[TCL Chinese Theatre]]]]\n''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' held its world premiere at the [[TCL Chinese Theater]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] on June 28, 2017,<ref name=\"LAPremiere\" /> and was released in the United Kingdom on July 5.<ref name=\"UKRelease\" /> It opened in additional international markets on July 6,<ref name=\"InternationalRelease\" /> with 23,400 screens (277 of which were [[IMAX]]) in 56 markets for its opening weekend.<ref name=\"DeadlineIntWknd1\" /> The film was released in the United States on July 7,<ref name=\"NewReleaseDate\" /> in 4,348 theaters (392 were IMAX and IMAX 3D, and 601 were premium large-format),<ref name=\"HollandWatts\" /><ref name=\"IMAX3D\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1Preview\" /> including [[3D film|3D]] screenings.<ref name=\"HollandWatts\" /> It was originally slated for release on July 28.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDate\" /> ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' is part of Phase Three of the MCU.<ref name=\"PhaseThree\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' was released on [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] on September 26, 2017, and on [[Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray 3D]], [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], and [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on October 17, 2017.
