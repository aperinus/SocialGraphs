The film was directed by [[Peter Berg]] from a script by brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber and stars [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Taylor Kitsch]], [[Brooklyn Decker]], [[Rihanna]] in her feature film debut, [[Tadanobu Asano]], [[Hamish Linklater]] and [[Liam Neeson]]. Filming took place in [[Hawaii]] and on {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}. In the film, the crews of a small group of warships are forced to battle against a naval fleet of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial origin]] in order to thwart their destructive goals.\n\n''Battleship'' premiered in Tokyo on April 3, 2012 and was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States on May 18, 2012. The film was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $303 million worldwide against a production budget of $209\u2013220 million, losing both Universal and Hasbro $150 million. It was nominated for six awards at the [[33rd Golden Raspberry Awards]], including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], \"winning\" one for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress|Worst Supporting Actress]] for Rihanna.\n\nIn contrast, however, it was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for Outstanding Achievement in Animated Effects in a Live Action Production at the [[40th Annie Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2005, [[Circumstellar habitable zone|potentially habitable]] \"Planet G\" is discovered, and a communications array to reach any [[extraterrestrial life]] is built in [[Oahu]]. There, Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress Sam Shane, daughter of [[Admiral]] Terrance Shane. Alex\u2019s brother, [[Commander]] Stone Hopper, forces Alex to join the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. Seven years later, Alex is a [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] aboard the {{USS|John Paul Jones|DDG-53|6}} and in a relationship with Sam, a physical therapist working with wounded veterans. While Stone is a model officer commanding the {{USS|Sampson|DDG-102|6}}, the rebellious Alex is facing a disciplinary [[military discharge|discharge]].\n\nDuring the [[Exercise RIMPAC#RIMPAC 2012|2012 RIMPAC exercise]], five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship hits a satellite and crashes through the [[Bank of China Tower (Hong Kong)|Bank of China Tower]] in [[Hong Kong]], while the others plunge into the waters off [[Hawaii]]. ''Sampson'', ''John Paul Jones'', and Japanese destroyer [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JDS]] {{ship|JDS|My\u014dk\u014d||2}} discover a floating structure that generates a [[Force field (technology)|force shield]] isolating the Hawaiian Islands and the three destroyers, from the rest of the world, and jamming all radar and communications inside. Three alien warships surface and open fire; ''My\u014dk\u014d'' is destroyed, ''Sampson'' is lost with all hands including Stone, and ''John Paul Jones''\u2019 command crew are killed, with Alex reluctantly assuming command. ''John Paul Jones'' disengages to recover ''My\u014dk\u014d''\u2019s survivors including Captain Yugi Nagata, while alien drones destroy Oahu\u2019s military installations and roads, ignoring all targets that do not pose a threat.\n\nHiking near the communications array, Sam and retired [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[lieutenant colonel]] and double amputee Mick Canales discover the aliens' presence. They encounter scientist Cal Zapata, realizing the aliens have taken over the array to re-establish communications with their home planet. ''John Paul Jones''\u2019 crew captures an alien which telepathically links with Alex, revealing their history of destroying worlds. Other aliens retrieve their comrade while another sabotages the ship. Its armored suit proves impervious to small-arms fire but is obliterated by the destroyer\u2019s [[5\"/54 caliber Mark 45 gun|5-inch gun]], and the captured alien's helmet reveals their eyes are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam, Nick, and Zapata recover his [[spectrum analyzer]], using it to radio ''John Paul Jones'' that the aliens will contact their planet when the facility\u2019s satellite is in position in four hours.\n\nAs night falls, Captain Nagata suggests using the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warning buoys]] around Hawaii to track the warships without radar, allowing ''John Paul Jones'' to destroy two of them. The third proves too elusive, so they lure it into facing east as the sun rises. Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows, blinding its crew with sunlight as ''John Paul Jones'' destroys the ship. The destroyer attempts to target the communications array, but is sunk by drones; Alex, Nagata, and several other sailors barely escape.\n\nThe survivors commandeer the decommissioned World War II [[battleship]] {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} with the aid of retired veterans. The floating structure is revealed to be a giant mothership, but ''Missouri'' disables the force field while Admiral Shane summons fighter jets from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Ronald Reagan}}. The battleship\u2019s turret carrying the ship\u2019s last shell is disabled, forcing the sailors to carry it to another weapon system. Sam, Mick and Cal stall the aliens at the array, where Mick kills an alien soldier. Alex uses the final shell to destroy the array, rendering the ''Missouri'' defenseless, but the mothership\u2019s drones are destroyed by [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Boeing F/A-18]] fighter jets which [[carpet bomb]] the mothership, eliminating the alien threat.\n\nAlex is promoted to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] and presented with a [[Silver Star]] and his brother's posthumous [[Navy Cross]]. Admiral Shane promises Alex will soon have a ship of his own, while he is also invited to become a Navy SEAL. Alex asks him for Sam\u2019s hand in marriage, and the admiral initially refuses, but invites Alex to lunch.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as [[Lieutenant (United States)|Lieutenant]] Alex Hopper, an undisciplined U.S. Navy Weapons Officer assigned to {{USS|John Paul Jones|DDG-53|6}}.\n* [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Commander Stone Hopper, Alex's older brother, Commanding Officer of {{USS|Sampson|DDG-102|6}}.\n* [[Rihanna]] as [[Gunner's mate|Gunner's Mate]] Second Class Cora Raikes, on {{USS|John Paul Jones|DDG-53|6}}.\n* [[Brooklyn Decker]] as Samantha Shane, a [[Physical therapy|physical therapist]] and Alex's girlfriend.\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as Captain Yugi Nagata, [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]], [[Commanding officer|Commanding Officer]] of {{Ship|JDS|My\u014dk\u014d|DDG-175|6}}.\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Admiral]] Terrance Shane, Commander of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]] and father of Samantha Shane.\n* [[Hamish Linklater]] as Cal Zapata, a scientist working on O'ahu.\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Boatswain's mate Seaman Jimmy \"Ordy\" Ord, on {{USS|John Paul Jones|DDG-53|6}}.\n* [[John Tui]] as Chief Petty Officer Walter \"Beast\" Lynch, a crew mate of {{USS|John Paul Jones|DDG-53|6}}.\n* [[Gregory D.

Director Peter Berg stated:\n\n{{Blockquote|Working with composers often is a really frustrating experience because you speak a different language and, oftentimes, they take two or three jobs, at the same time. They're difficult and pretentious and they're tormented artists. I'm not going to name names, but most of them are. One guy who isn't is [[Hans Zimmer]], who taught Steve Jablonsky. We had a couple of meetings, and I came up with this idea. The day I met with him, I had had an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] for my neck, and they make that really scary sound. I was like, 'I just had this MRI, and when I was in there, I was thinking about the aliens, and it was really scary.' And he was like, 'Oh, that's awesome!' He went and recorded MRIs and made music out of MRIs, and that's the theme of the aliens in our film. He is no drama, and just goes and gets it done. The score is big and awesome and scary and driving. At times, it's very simple and acoustic and touching and emotional.
