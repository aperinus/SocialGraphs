It was originally released in Japan on July 15 at the \"Toei Manga Matsuri\" film festival along with the 1989 film version of ''[[Himitsu no Akko-chan]]'', the first ''[[Akuma-kun]]'' film, and the film version of ''[[Kidou Keiji Jiban]]''.\n\nDespite [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] inconsistencies, ''Dead Zone'' acts as a prelude to the ''Dragon Ball Z'' television series and is the only film to get a follow-up within the series, that being the [[Garlic Jr.]] arc which takes place between the main [[Frieza]] and [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Android]] arcs. The [[canonicity]] of this arc is debated as it does not appear in the original [[manga]] and is largely considered to be [[Filler (media)|filler]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nFollowing his defeat by [[Goku]] at the [[Dragon Ball (TV series)|23rd World Martial Arts Tournament]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] trains alone when he is caught in an ambush by a group of mysterious warriors. [[Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball)|Chi-Chi]], along with her father and son, [[Gohan]], are attacked by the same group while Goku is away fishing. He senses the danger his family faces and returns to find that his son has been abducted.\n\nThe [[imp]]ish [[Garlic Jr.]] is responsible for the attack so that he could retrieve the four-star Dragon Ball that was attached to Gohan's hat. Garlic Jr. senses an immense [[qi|power]] within Gohan, and decides to make him his pupil rather than kill him. After gathering the remaining six [[magic (supernatural)|magical]] Dragon Balls, Garlic Jr. summons the eternal dragon [[Shenlong (Dragon Ball)|Shenron]] and he [[wishes]] for [[immortality]]. Goku prepares to rescue his son when [[Kami (Dragon Ball)|Kami]], Earth's guardian, arrives and explains that centuries prior, he and Garlic Jr.'s father, Garlic, competed for the position of Guardian of the Earth and Kami was victorious. In revenge, Garlic unleashed a demonic horde onto the Earth until Kami defeated him and ended the invasion. Goku proceeds to search for Gohan when he is attacked by the villain's [[henchmen]] while Kami faces Garlic Jr.\n\n[[Krillin]] and Piccolo arrive with the latter defeating henchman Sansho while Goku manages to defeat the other two henchmen, Ginger and Nicky. Meanwhile, Kami is bested by Garlic Jr. until Goku and Piccolo rescue him. With Garlic Jr.'s newly obtained immortality and a new, muscular form, the rivals Goku and Piccolo are forced to work together and are able to eventually defeat him. Still possessing disdain for one another and mistakenly believing Garlic Jr. to be dead, Goku and Piccolo prepare to fight when Garlic Jr. opens up a portal into another dimension; a void of darkness known as the ''Dead Zone''. Gohan becomes enraged as he witnesses his father and friends in danger and releases his latent power, hurdling Garlic Jr. into his own vortex to be trapped for all eternity. Unable to recall the events, Gohan believes that his father defeated Garlic Jr. while Goku realizes his son has amazing hidden potential. Piccolo vows to defeat Goku while watching him and his friends depart.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese\n! colspan=\"3\" |English\n|-\n!<small>[[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer]]/[[Funimation]]/<br>[[Ocean Studios]] (1997)</small>\n!<small>Chinkel Post-Production/[[Mediawan Thematics|AB Groupe]] ({{circa|2003}})<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614|title=Dragon Ball Z: Big Green Dub Cast|website=Behind The Voice Actors|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref></small>\n!<small>[[Funimation]] (2005)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Goku]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Masako Nozawa]]\n| [[Peter Kelamis]]\n| [[David Gasman]]\n| [[Sean Schemmel|Se\u00e1n Schemmel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gohan]]\n| [[Saffron Henderson]]\n| Jodi Forrest\n| [[Stephanie Nadolny]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Toshio Furukawa]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Scott McNeil]]\n!<small>Big Green</small>\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Christopher Sabat|Christopher R.
