The film follows five entrants in a prestigious [[conformation show|dog show]] as they travel to the show and compete once there. Much of the dialogue was improvised. Many of the comic actors were also involved in Guest's other films, including ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'', ''[[For Your Consideration (film)|For Your Consideration]]'', and ''[[Mascots (2016 film)|Mascots]]''. The film's score was composed by [[C. J. Vanston]].\n\n==Plot==\nFive dogs and their owners, trainers and handlers travel to [[Philadelphia]] to compete in the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show.\n\nGerry and Cookie Fleck are a middle-class couple from [[Florida]] who arrive at the Taft Hotel with their [[Norwich Terrier]] Winky. After having forgotten to pay their credit card bill and short of cash, they are forced to sleep in the hotel's storage room. While traveling to the show, they encounter several of Cookie\u2019s former lovers who kiss her passionately and try to seduce her, making Gerry jealous. To Gerry's chagrin, they continue to cross paths with Cookie's paramours after the show ends.\n\nMeg and Hamilton Swan, a stereotypical [[yuppie]] couple from a [[Chicago]] suburb, arrive with their [[Weimaraner]] Beatrice. Their constant doting and neurotic behavior toward Beatrice\u2014for example, taking their dog to a psychotherapist after she sees them having sex in a position they learned from the ''[[Kama Sutra]]''\u2014confuses and upsets Beatrice. The Swans lose Beatrice's favorite toy and frantically search for a replacement before the show starts, but are unable to find one. When Beatrice performs poorly and is removed by a judge for unruly behavior, they blame it on the lost toy.\n\nHarlan Pepper, the [[Southern United States|Southern]] owner of a fishing goods store and an aspiring [[ventriloquist]], arrives with his [[Bloodhound]] Hubert. Harlan is an affable, good-natured man who prides himself on being able to name every type of nut. The Pepper family has raised a variety of hounds for generations; Harlan continues the tradition by raising Bloodhounds.\n\nSherri Ann Cabot is the buxom, overly-made-up [[trophy wife]] of the elderly Leslie Ward Cabot, her [[age disparity in sexual relationships|sugar daddy]]. A former two-time winner of the show, Sherri Ann receives help with her [[Standard Poodle]] Rhapsody in White, also known as Butch, from her taskmaster trainer Christy Cummings.  Christy is an extremely competitive handler who makes sure the dog is prepared for the show. A no-nonsense, short-haired lesbian, she resists Sherri Ann's attempts at giving her a beauty [[makeover]]. Leslie is oblivious to Christy and Sherri Ann's romantic involvement &mdash; as well as everything else happening around him.\n\nScott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof are a [[camp (style)|campy]] [[gay]] couple who take great pride in their [[Shih Tzu]] Miss Agnes. They are confident that she will win the competition. They share a love of old movies and enjoy making fun of Christy Cummings, but are friendly to the other competitors, especially the Flecks.\n\nThe dog show is hosted by dog expert Trevor Beckwith and oblivious \"color\" commentator Buck Laughlin, whose inane banter annoys Beckwith. During the first round, Beatrice is disqualified when she becomes aggressive and Hamilton cannot control her. The other four dogs advance to the final round. Just before the finals, Cookie dislocates her knee and insists that Gerry take over for her despite his two left feet (the result of a birth defect). Though Gerry is nervous, Winky ultimately takes Best in Show.\n\nAfter the competition, Gerry and Cookie return home to Florida and enjoy brief fame there. While in a studio recording [[novelty song]]s about terriers, they discover that the recording engineer is yet another of Cookie's ex-lovers, to Gerry's unending frustration. Christy and Sherri Ann, now openly in a relationship (Leslie's fate is unclear), publish ''American Bitch'', a magazine for lesbian owners of purebred dogs. After spending weeks on a [[kibbutz]], Harlan fulfills his dream of being a ventriloquist, entertaining sparse crowds with a [[honky tonk]] song-and-dance number. Stefan and Scott design a calendar featuring Shih Tzu dogs in costume appearing in scenes from classic films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Meg and Hamilton Swan are visibly happier together after replacing Beatrice with a [[pug]] named Kipper, which they claim enjoys watching them make love.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Actors===\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Gerry Fleck\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Cookie Fleck\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Scott Donlan\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Stefan Vanderhoof\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Hamilton Swan\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Meg Swan\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Sherri Ann Cabot\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Christy Cummings\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Harlan Pepper\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Max Berman\n* [[Jim Piddock]] as Trevor Beckwith\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Buck Laughlin\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Mark Schafer\n* [[Lynda Boyd]] as Cabot Party Guest\n* [[Teryl Rothery]] as Philly AM Host\n* [[Patrick Cranshaw]] as Leslie Ward Cabot\n* [[Will Sasso]] as Dale the Fishin' Hole Guy\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Theodore W.

All have earned the title ''Ch.'', indicating they have qualified for a championship at conformation shows, with most qualifying for the [[Canadian Kennel Club]] Championship\u2014hence the prefix ''Can''. The ''kennel prefix'' of one or more breeders precedes each dog's registered name; e. g. in \"Arokat Echobar Take Me Dancing\", the first breeder is \"Arokat\" and the second is \"Echobar\" while the name is \"Take Me Dancing\". The registered name differs from the dog's ''call name'', which is used to talk to the animal. For example, Arokat Echobar Take Me Dancing's call name is \"Peach\".<ref>{{cite web|title=CANCH, USCH Arokat Echobar Take Me Dancing NRD, NSD, V|url=http://www.weimaranerpedigrees.com/details.php?id=108479|website=weimaranerpedigrees.com|access-date=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n* Can Ch.
