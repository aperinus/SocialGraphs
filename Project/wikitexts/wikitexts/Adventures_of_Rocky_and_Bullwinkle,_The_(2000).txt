Animated characters [[Rocket J. Squirrel|Rocky]] and [[Bullwinkle J. Moose|Bullwinkle]] share the screen with live actors portraying [[Fearless Leader]] ([[Robert De Niro]], who also co-produced the film), [[Boris Badenov]] ([[Jason Alexander]]) and [[Natasha Fatale]] ([[Rene Russo]]) along with [[Randy Quaid]], [[Piper Perabo]], [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]]. [[June Foray]] reprised her role as Rocky, while [[Keith Scott (voice actor)|Keith Scott]] (no relation to original voice actor [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]) voiced Bullwinkle and the film's narrator. It also features [[cameo appearances]] by performers including [[James Rebhorn]],  [[Paget Brewster]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[John Goodman]], [[David Alan Grier]], [[Don Novello]], [[Jon Polito]], [[Carl Reiner]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Max Grodenchik]], [[Norman Lloyd]], [[Jonathan Winters]] and [[Billy Crystal]]. The film follows a young rookie FBI agent named Karen Sympathy enlisting the help of Rocky and Bullwinkle to stop Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader from taking over the United States.\n\nReleased on June 30, 2000, the film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing $35.1 million worldwide against its $76 million budget<ref name=\"mojo\" /> and received generally mixed reviews with criticisms toward its writing, plot, and humor while praising the performances, visual effects, and faithfulness to its source material.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Rocky the Squirrel]] and [[Bullwinkle J. Moose]] live a melancholic life ever since their [[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends|television series]] was cancelled in 1964. Their animated home, Frostbite Falls, is [[deforestation|deforested]], Rocky can no longer fly, and their show's [[unseen character|unseen]] [[Narrator]] lives with his mother. Meanwhile, their archenemies, [[Fearless Leader]], [[Boris Badenov]], and Natasha Fatale, have all lost power in [[Pottsylvania]] following the end of the [[Cold War]]. They escape by tunneling to a [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] film studio, where they trick executive Minnie Mogul into signing a rights contract to their series and green-lighting a potential movie, dragging the villains out of the animated world and transforming them into live action characters.\n \nSix months later, Fearless Leader and his minions have founded RBTV (\"Really Bad Television\"), a cable television network in [[New York City]] that is programmed to control the population by [[brainwashing]] American audiences into voting Fearless Leader in as the next [[President of the United States]]. [[FBI]] Director, Cappy von Trapment, deploys agent Karen Sympathy to recruit Rocky and Bullwinkle to stop RBTV's intended broadcast. Karen travels to a movie-generating [[lighthouse]] in [[Los Angeles]], summoning Rocky, Bullwinkle, and the Narrator into the real world. \n \nUpon learning of Rocky and Bullwinkle's return, Fearless Leader deploys Boris and Natasha to destroy them. They are given the CDI (\"Computer-Degenerating Imagery\"), a [[laptop]]-like weapon that can trap cartoon characters within the [[Internet]]. The villains' truck is stolen by Karen, who is swiftly arrested by [[Oklahoma State Police]] troopers when Natasha poses as her. Boris and Natasha later steal a [[helicopter]] to continue their pursuit. Karen is sent to prison, but manipulates a love-struck Swedish guard named Ole to help her escape. Rocky and Bullwinkle are picked up by students Martin and Lewis, who attend Bullwinkle's [[alma mater]] Wossamotta U. Boris and Natasha launch an elaborate plan to assassinate Bullwinkle, donating a cheque to the university in his name, inspiring the academic board to award Bullwinkle with an honorary \"Mooster's Degree\". As Bullwinkle addresses the students, Rocky regains his ability to fly, stopping Boris from killing Bullwinkle with the CDI.\n \nBoris and Natasha chase Rocky and Bullwinkle through [[Chicago]], but disintegrate their own helicopter. Karen reunites with Rocky and Bullwinkle, but the trio are arrested again by numerous [[State police (United States)|state troopers]]. They are trialed for numerous misdemeanors in ten states, but the presiding Judge Cameo has the charges dropped upon recognizing Rocky and Bullwinkle, informing the district attorney that celebrities are above the law. The trio buys a rickety [[biplane]] and escape Boris and Natasha once again. The two villains consider retiring, lying to Fearless Leader that they had defeated Rocky and Bullwinkle, confident that they have already won. Meanwhile, the heroes' plane begins to lose altitude due to the combined weight. Rocky flies Karen to New York to stop the broadcast, but they are captured by Boris and Natasha. Fearless Leader initiates his plan and broadcasts programs to brainwash most of the country.\n \nBullwinkle crash-lands the plane outside the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and finds the President to be [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] by the RBTV programs, which Bullwinkle is immune to due to his natural stupidity. Cappy finds Bullwinkle and scans him into the [[NICE (computer system)|White House's computer system]], then e-mails him to the studio just as Fearless Leader addresses the nation, disrupting the broadcast, and a chaotic fight breaks out, leading to the capture of the villains. Karen, Rocky, and Bullwinkle then ask the American public to replant Frostbite Falls, and Bullwinkle accidentally activates the CDI, transforming the villains back to their animated forms and banishing them to the Internet once and for all.\n \nIn the aftermath, Rocky and Bullwinkle's careers are renewed in RBTV, renamed to \"Rocky and Bullwinkle Television\", and Karen goes on a date with Ole as Rocky, Bullwinkle, and the Narrator return home to a rejuvenated Frostbite Falls.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[June Foray]] as the voice of [[Rocket J.
