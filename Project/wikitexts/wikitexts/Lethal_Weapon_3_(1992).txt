The sequel to ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'' (1989), it is the third installment in the [[Lethal Weapon (franchise)|''Lethal Weapon'' film series]] and stars [[Mel Gibson]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]].<ref name=\"fabrikant1992\">{{cite news|title=The Media Business: Advertising; Warner's Sequel Weapon Cuts Down Promotion Costs|work= The New York Times|date=1992-05-12|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/12/business/the-media-business-advertising-warner-s-sequel-weapon-cuts-down-promotion-costs.html|access-date=2010-11-08|first=Geraldine|last=Fabrikant}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Lethal Weapon 3'', [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Sergeants [[Martin Riggs]] (Gibson) and [[Roger Murtaugh]] (Glover) pursue Jack Travis (Wilson), a former LAPD lieutenant turned ruthless arms dealer, during the six days prior to Murtaugh's retirement. Riggs and Murtaugh are joined by Leo Getz (Pesci) as well as [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] Sergeant Lorna Cole ([[Rene Russo|Russo]]).\n\nThe film was a box office success, grossing over $320&nbsp;million worldwide. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and the highest-grossing installment in the series overall. The film was followed by ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' in 1998.\n\n==Plot==\nA week before his retirement, [[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D.]] Sergeant [[Roger Murtaugh]] and his partner [[Martin Riggs]] are demoted to uniform duties after failing to defuse an office building bomb. While on street patrol they witness the theft of an [[armored car (valuables)|armored car]], and help to thwart the crime assisted by armored car driver Delores. One of the two thieves gets away, but the other is taken into police custody. The suspect is found to be a known associate of Jack Travis, a former LAPD lieutenant who is running an arms smuggling ring in Los Angeles. The department is further concerned that the thieves were using [[Armor-piercing shell|armor-piercing bullets]]. Riggs and Murtaugh are re-promoted and assigned to work with Sergeant Lorna Cole from internal affairs to track down Travis.\n\nTravis is currently negotiating with mobster Tyrone regarding his arms deal. The armored car thief that escaped is brought to Travis, who subsequently kills him in front of Tyrone for putting the police on his trail. Travis then uses his old police credentials to enter the interrogation room and kill the suspect in custody before he can be interviewed. Travis is unaware that closed-circuit cameras have been installed in the station, and Cole is able to confirm Travis' identity. While the three are reviewing the footage, their good friend Leo Getz, who has been helping Murtaugh sell his house, arrives and immediately recognizes Travis from several prior business deals and his love of ice hockey. Murtaugh, Riggs, and Getz narrowly miss capturing Travis at a hockey match, and Getz is wounded. However, Getz manages to provide them with information of a warehouse Travis owns, which they suspect is where he has stored his arms shipments.\n\nRiggs and Murtaugh contact Cole for backup before they raid the warehouse, and stop at a food truck to wait for her. As they wait for their food, they witness a drug deal and attempt to stop it. Murtaugh kills a gunman who fired at them, while the rest escape. Murtaugh recognizes the gunman, Darryl, a close friend of his son Nick. With Murtaugh emotionally distraught, Riggs and Cole head to the warehouse, where they successfully secure his next arms shipment delivery. That night, Riggs and Cole find they have feelings for each other and sleep together. Riggs later finds a guilt-ridden Murtaugh drunk in his boat and consoles him in time for Darryl's funeral. There, Darryl's father passionately insists that Murtaugh find the person responsible for giving Darryl the gun.\n\nCole finds that Darryl's gun, the armor-piercing bullets, and the arms they recovered were originally in police custody, meant to be destroyed, and were stolen by Travis; they revoke his credentials from the system. They further tie the guns to Tyrone and interrogate him. Tyrone directs them to an auto garage where many of his henchmen work from. Riggs, Murtaugh, and Cole are able to arrest several of the men. Meanwhile, Travis has one of his men hack into the computer system to find another arms storage area. He then forces Captain Murphy under gunpoint to take him to this new facility so he can steal the guns using Murphy's credentials. Cole finds the evidence of hacking and Murphy's absence, and the three, along with a rookie cop, Edwards, who looks up to Riggs and Murtaugh, intercept Travis. They are able to rescue Murphy and stop Travis and his men before he can take the weapons, but Edwards is killed during their pursuit.\n\nGetz provides information on a housing development owned by Travis's shell company. Riggs, Murtaugh, and Cole infiltrate the site at night and enter a large-scale gunfight. Riggs sets the construction site on fire and most of Travis' men are killed, while Travis wounds Cole. When Travis uses a bulldozer to chase down Riggs, using its blade as a bullet shield, Murtaugh tosses Daryl's gun, now loaded with the armor-piercing bullets, to Riggs, who then shoots and kills Travis through the blade. After finding out Cole wore two layers of kevlar vests, Riggs admits his love for her as she is taken away in a chopper.\n\nThe next day, Murtaugh's family is celebrating his retirement, when Murtaugh reveals to Getz that he has decided to not sell the house and stay with the force, preserving his partnership with Riggs. As the film ends, Riggs announces his relationship with Cole to Murtaugh.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Mel Gibson]] as [[Martin Riggs]]\n*[[Danny Glover]] as [[Roger Murtaugh]]\n*[[Joe Pesci]] as Leo Getz\n*[[Rene Russo]] as Lorna Cole<ref>{{cite news|title= Lethal Weapon 3 Role Brings Stardom To Rene Russo|work= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1992-05-24|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-05-24/features/9202160443_1_freejack-with-mick-jagger-throaty-laugh-role|access-date=2010-10-03}}</ref>\n*[[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]] as Jack Travis\n*[[Steve Kahan]] as Captain Ed Murphy\n*[[Darlene Love]] as Trish Murtaugh\n*Ebonie Smith as Carrie Murtaugh\n*[[Nick Chinlund]] as Hatchett\n*[[Alan Scarfe]] as Herman Walters\n*[[Mary Ellen Trainor]] as Dr. Stephanie Woods \n*[[Delores Hall]] as Delores Jackson, the armoured car driver\n*Gregory Millar as Tyrone\n*Andrew Hill Newman as the jaywalker\n*[[Traci Wolfe]] as Rianne Murtaugh\n*Damon Hines as Nick Murtaugh\n*Jason Rainwater as Officer Edwards (credited as Jason Meshover-Iorg)\n* [[Mark Pellegrino]] as Billy Phelps\n*[[Jack McGee (actor)|Jack McGee]] as Mickey McGee\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was filmed from October 1991 to January 1992.\n\nRichard Donner, an animal-rights and pro-choice activist, placed many posters and stickers for these causes in the film. Of note are the [[T-shirt]] worn by one of Murtaugh's daughters (the actress's idea), an 18-wheeler with an anti-fur slogan on the side, and a sticker on a locker in the police station.<ref name=\"fabrikant1992\"/>\n\n===Demolition scenes===\nIn the film's first scene, Riggs accidentally sets off a bomb that destroys the ICSI Building. The ICSI Building was actually the former City Hall building of [[Orlando, Florida]], located at the intersection of Orange Avenue and South Street in [[Downtown Orlando]]. Warner Bros. decided to use the destruction of the building in the film, and as a result paid $500,000 for the demolition.<ref name=AFI>{{AFI film|59301}}</ref> From August to October 1991, the production crew fitted the old Orlando City Hall building featured in the opening scene with carefully placed explosives to create the visual effect of a bomb explosion. [[Bill Frederick]], then mayor of Orlando, Florida, was the policeman who sarcastically claps and said \"Bravo!\" to Murtaugh and Riggs after the explosion.\n\nThe building was demolished so that it would collapse slightly forward (toward Orange Avenue), minimizing the chances of it damaging the [[Orlando City Hall|new City Hall]] building, built directly behind it. The space was cleared out and became a plaza for the new City Hall, with a fountain and a monument.\n\nThe film's climax scene, where an under-construction housing development is set ablaze, was filmed at an unfinished housing development in [[Lancaster, California]]. The unfinished houses, which had been sitting abandoned and slated to be torn down, were coated in flame retardant and propane gas lines to ensure that the houses could withstand re-shoots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-10/local/me-368_1_lethal-weapon-iii |title=Tract May End in Blaze of Film Glory : Lancaster: The city is talking to filmmakers who may want to burn down an abandoned development as part of 'Lethal Weapon III.' |author=John Chandler |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1991-12-10 |access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref> The original homes were eventually demolished and was eventually redeveloped into another housing development.\n\nDuring the closing credits, Riggs and Murtaugh drive up to an old hotel where another bomb has been placed. Before they (their doubles) can exit the car, the bomb explodes and destroys the building. The hotel was actually the former Soreno Hotel in downtown [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].<ref name=TBTimes>{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/talk/content/history-implosions-tampa-bay |title=A history of implosions in Tampa Bay |author=Times Editor |newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |date=2012-02-27 |access-date=2016-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223211158/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/talk/content/history-implosions-tampa-bay |archive-date=2016-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The film's producers agreed to help with the cost of the 68-year-old building's implosion for the purposes of their film.<ref name=TBTimes/>\n\n===Writing===\n[[Jeffrey Boam]]'s first two drafts of the script were different from the final film. The character of Lorna for example was not a woman in original drafts, but the original character still had the same personality and was just as lethal and crazy as Riggs, making him his match. Riggs also had an affair with Roger's daughter Rianne, and a few parts in the final film where Roger suspects that Riggs and Rianne are interested in each other are only parts left from the original drafts.\n\nDirector [[Richard Donner]] demanded some big changes on the script which included changing the original character of Lorna (who had a different name in earlier drafts) into a woman and turning her into Riggs's girlfriend. He also re-worked the script to be less story-oriented and not focus on the main villains but instead on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh. He also toned down action scenes from the script and brought back Leo Getz into the story. All of his scenes were written in afterwards. In the original script Leo had left L.A. for New York. Boam had some disagreements with changes that Donner made, but he was not against them. Boam was fired after he wrote his first two drafts of the script. One of the reasons for this was because Donner wasn't interested in the script and he disagreed with some parts of Boam's original draft. After another writer, [[Robert Mark Kamen]], was hired to re-write the script, Boam was called to return to work on it again. The filmmakers realized that Kamen's re-writes were not working. Boam asked to work alone on the script and ended up constantly changing it from October 1991 until January 1992 while filming was taking place. These types of changes also occurred during the filming of ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theoccasionalcritic.blogspot.mx/2009/09/jeffrey-boam-interview-1992.html | title=The Jeffrey Boam interview, 1992 | date=September 24, 2009 | website=The Occasional Critic}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kamen in a 2012 interview, many of his writing contributions ended up in the final film. Kamen also wrote many parts of the previous film in the series, with the most significant portions being the South African villains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/site/197469-not-a-sequel-robert-mark-kamen-on-taken-2-bloodsport-and-karate-kid|title=Not a Sequel: Robert Mark Kamen on Taken 2, Bloodsport and Karate Kid - CraveOnline|date=8 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nScreenwriter [[Jeffrey Boam]] is credited twice in the 'screenplay by' credits. This is because he did one draft by himself (granting him the first credit) and a second draft collaborating with [[Robert Mark Kamen]] (granting him the second credit). In this rare scenario, Boam was hired to rewrite his own script with a second writer. After receiving the unusual writing credits, the advertising department assumed it was a misprint and produced posters with the credits \"Story by Jeffrey Boam, Screenplay by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen\". After a few of the posters had been sent out, the WGA contacted the department, telling them that the initial credits were the correct ones, and ordering the posters to be recalled and destroyed.\n\n[[Carrie Fisher]] was an uncredited [[script doctor]] on the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/carriefisher/filmography/p89886|title=Carrie Fisher Filmography and Movies}}</ref>\n\n===Martial arts===\nRusso received martial arts training for a month before shooting from [[Cheryl Wheeler-Dixon]], who had a karate background and was a former kickboxing champion, and Wheeler-Dixon was also her stunt double.<ref name=\"Blackbelt1992\">{{cite magazine|last=Wheeler-Dixon|first=Cheryl|title=Lethal Wheeler Still Using Her Weapons|url={{Google books|-M8DAAAAMBAJ|page=11|plainurl=yes}}|page=11|magazine=Black Belt|issn=0277-3066|publisher=Rainbow Publications|volume=30|issue=6|id=June 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Baker|first=Tim|title=Holy Stuntfighting, Batman!|url={{Google books|LtkDAAAAMBAJ|page=35|plainurl=yes}}|pages=35\u201338|magazine=Black Belt|issn=0277-3066|publisher=Rainbow Publications|volume=35|issue=7|id=July 1997}}</ref> [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] instructor [[Rorion Gracie]], who had taught Gibson and Gary Busey in the first movie of the series in 1987, also provided training to Russo and acted as stuntman for a fight scene.<ref name=\"Blackbelt1992\" /><ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Williams |first1=James |last2=Pranin|first2=Stanley|title=Interview with Rorion Gracie|url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleid=90|magazine=Aikido Journal|issn=1340-5624|date=1994|issue=101|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122024735/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleid=90|archive-date=22 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nTo promote the film, theater lobbies featured a 3-D cutout of the film poster of Riggs and Murtaugh posing with their guns and Leo Getz peeking from the background.
