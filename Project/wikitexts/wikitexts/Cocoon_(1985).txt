When Atlantis sank, twenty aliens were left behind, kept alive in large rock-like cocoons at the bottom of the ocean. Now, a group of Antareans have returned to collect them. Disguising themselves as humans, they rent a house with a swimming pool and charge the water with \"life force\" to give the cocooned Antareans energy to survive the trip home. They charter a boat from a local captain named Jack, who helps them retrieve the cocoons. Jack spies on Kitty, a beautiful woman from the team who chartered his boat, while she undresses in her cabin, and discovers that she is an alien. After the aliens reveal themselves to him and explain what's going on, he decides to help them.\n\nNext door to the house the Antareans are renting is a [[retirement home]]. Three of its residents, Ben, Arthur, and Joe, often trespass to swim in the pool next door. They absorb some of the life force, making them feel younger and stronger. Eventually caught in the act, they are given permission to use the pool by the Antarean leader, Walter, on the condition that they do not touch the cocoons or tell anybody else about it. Rejuvenated with youthful energy, the three men begin to let the advantages of the pool take hold as they are relieved of their ailments.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitty and Jack grow closer and decide to make love in the pool. Since she cannot do so in the human manner, she introduces him to the Antarean equivalent, in which she shares her lifeforce energy with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/therush/character-study-kitty|title=Character study: Kitty|work=The Rush|publisher=UGO Film and TV|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222115314/http://www.ugo.com/therush/character-study-kitty|archive-date=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe other retirement home residents become suspicious after witnessing Ben's wife Mary climb a tree. Their friend Bernie reveals the secret of the pool to the other residents, who rush to the pool to swim in its waters. When Walter finds them damaging one of the cocoons, he ejects them from the property. The Antereans open the damaged cocoon, and the creature inside shares his last moments with Walter, who begins to cry as he dies. Later that evening, Bernie finds his wife Rose has stopped breathing and carries her body to the pool in an attempt to heal her, only to be informed by Walter that the pool no longer works due to the other residents draining the force in the rush to make themselves young.\n\nWalter explains that the cocoons can't survive the trip back to Antarea, but will be able to survive on Earth. With the help of Jack, Ben, Arthur and Joe, the Antareans return the cocoons to the sea. The Antareans offer to take residents of the retirement home with them to Antarea, where they will never grow older and never die. Most of them accept the offer, but Bernie chooses to remain on Earth.\n\nUpon leaving, Ben tells his grandson David that he and Mary are leaving for good. As the residents are leaving, David's mother Susan finds out about their destination and quickly drives to the retirement home, where they find the majority of the rooms vacant and contact local authorities.\n\nWhile the police are searching for the residents, David notices Jack's boat, with the Antareans and the retirement residents aboard, starting and jumps onto the side as it pulls away. The boat is being chased by the Coast Guard, so with little time left, David says a tearful goodbye to Ben and Mary before jumping off into the water. The Coast Guard boats stop to pick him up, giving the others a chance to get away. Out of nowhere, a thick fog appears and strands the remaining Coast Guard boats, and they call off the chase.\n\nAs the Antarean ship appears, Walter pays Jack for his services and the boat. Jack embraces Kitty for the last time and they share a kiss. He then says farewell to everyone before jumping into an inflatable raft as the boat starts rising up into the Antarean vessel. Jack watches as the boat disappears inside the ship and departs.\n\nBack on earth, a funeral is held for the missing residents. During the sermon, David looks toward the sky and smiles. The film ends with the Antarean vessel going towards a bright-looking object, assumed to be a hyperspace entrance or portal, leading to Antarea.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Don Ameche]] as Art Selwyn\n* [[Wilford Brimley]] as Ben Luckett\n* [[Hume Cronyn]] as Joe Finley\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Walter\n* [[Jack Gilford]] as Bernie Lefkowitz\n* [[Steve Guttenberg]] as Jack Bonner\n* [[Maureen Stapleton]] as Mary Luckett\n* [[Jessica Tandy]] as Alma Finley\n* [[Gwen Verdon]] as Bess McCarthy\n* [[Herta Ware]] as Rose Lefkowitz\n* [[Tahnee Welch]] as Kitty\n* [[Barret Oliver]] as David\n* [[Linda Harrison (actress)|Linda Harrison]] as Susan\n* [[Tyrone Power Jr.]] as Pillsbury\n* [[Clint Howard]] as John Dexter\n* [[Charles Lampkin]] as Pops\n* [[Paul Arlen Talbert]] as Coroner\n* Mike Nomad as Doc\n* Jorge Gil as Lou Pine\n* [[Rance Howard]] as St. Petersburg detective\n* James Ritz as DMV clerk\n* Peter Cody as boy in nursing home lobby\n* [[Jim Fitzpatrick (actor)|Jim Fitzpatrick]] as Dock Worker (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\nCasting for the film and its sequel was overseen by casting director [[Beverly McDermott]].<ref name=sunsen>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Jicha |title=Beverly McDermott, top casting director and Hollywood resident, dies |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/hollywood/fl-obit-beverly-mcdermott-20120120,0,1215353.story |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |date=2012-01-20 |access-date=2012-01-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211224043/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/hollywood/fl-obit-beverly-mcdermott-20120120%2C0%2C1215353.story |archive-date=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Robert Zemeckis]] was originally hired as director, and spent a year working on it in [[Filmmaking#Development|development]].
