An incompetent New York City police officer is banned from driving and comes to rely on a talented taxi driver to help him solve a series of bank robberies. The film is a remake of the [[Taxi (1998 film)|1998 French film of the same name]] and was panned by critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\n[[Bicycle courier]] Belle Williams earns her taxi license and  installs a [[supercharger]] in her custom-built [[Ford Crown Victoria#Second generation (1998\u20132012)|1999 Ford Crown Victoria]] taxicab. Her first customer offers her a $100 tip if she can make it to the Airport in fifteen minutes. She does.\n\nBumbling detective Andy Washburn crashes his partner's car and is demoted to foot patrol duty. Hearing of a bank robbery, Washburn flags down Belle's taxicab. They arrive at the bank just as a quartet of female Brazilian robbers leave in a [[BMW E65]]. Belle recognizes them as models she saw earlier at the airport. Their leader is Vanessa. Police arrive and mistakenly apprehend Belle and Washburn. Belle's cab is impounded, and she is questioned. Washburn promises to get her cab back if she helps him solve the bank robberies.\n\nWashburn takes Belle to his home after her boyfriend kicks her out for missing a dinner date. Washburn's constantly drunk  mother brings up embarrassing moments of Washburn's past and talks about why he's such a bad driver. Washburn convinces the impound cop to return Belle's cab. They realize the gang robs banks just before the garbage collection is due. They put the money in the trash which the garbage man then collects. Washburn is fired for disobeying orders and Belle is given a final warning for reckless driving. Belle teaches Washburn to drive and they discover the garbage collector is acting for the gang because they have kidnapped his wife. They recover the garbage collector's wife and all the loot.\n\nThe police learn which bank is next to be hit and ambush the robbers, who take Lt. Robbins hostage and escape, followed by Washburn and Belle in her cab. Belle calls on the help of her bicycle courier friends to pinpoint the car. They negotiate a trade of the cash from the garbage truck for Robbins, and try to swap the hostage for the money while driving down the highway. Washburn forces the robbers down a long bridge under construction.\n\nVanessa fires her gun at them and wounds Belle. While the police arrest Vanessa, Washburn drives Belle to the hospital singing \"[[This Will Be|This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)]]\". He crashes into the hospital so Belle can be quickly recovered. \n\nBelle achieves her dream of driving NASCAR, sponsored by New York banks. Washburn is reinstated for foiling the robberies. Washburn's mother and Robbins attend Belle's first race to cheer her on. Jesse proposes to Belle. As Belle begins the race, [[Jeff Gordon]] pulls up as a challenger.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Isabelle \"Belle\" Precious Williams, a bicycle messenger turned taxi driver who dreams of being at NASCAR\n* [[Jimmy Fallon]] as Detective Andrew Washburn, an undercover detective of NYPD\n* [[Gisele B\u00fcndchen]] as Vanessa, a Brazilian bank robber\n* [[Henry Simmons]] as Jesse\n* [[Jennifer Esposito]] as Lieutenant Marta Robbins, Andrew Washburn's boss and former girlfriend.\n* [[Ana Cristina Oliveira|Ana Cristina de Oliveira]] as Redhead, Vanessa's Portuguese second robber\n* [[Ingrid Vandebosch]] as Third Robber\n* [[Magali Amadei]] as Fourth Robber\n* [[Ann-Margret]] as Mrs. Washburn\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Big Cop\n* [[Christian Kane]] as Agent Mullins, a self-centered FBI Agent\n* [[Boris McGiver]] as Franklin\n* [[Adrian Martinez (actor)|Adrian Martinez]] as Brazilian Man\n* [[Joe Lisi]] as Mr. Anthony Scalia\n* [[GQ (actor)|GQ]] as Mario, the Stopwatch Messenger\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Clerk at Inpound Office\n* [[John Rothman]] as Business Man\n* Bryna Weiss as Mrs. Scalia\n* [[Jeff Gordon]] as himself\n}}\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Taxi'' was released on October 6, 2004 in 3,001 theaters and opened at #4 at the box office with $12 million in the opening weekend.
