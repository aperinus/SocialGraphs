The scenario was adapted from the 1956 novel of the same name by No\u00ebl Calef.\n\nAssociated by some critics with [[film noir]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud - synopsis|author=Rasmussen, Linda|publisher=AllMovie|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v18507|access-date=5 October 2013}}</ref> and introducing new narrative, cinematographic, and editing techniques, the film is considered an important work in establishing the [[French New Wave]] and the [[European art cinema|New Modern Cinema]].<ref name=\"romina\"/> The [[Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (soundtrack)|improvised soundtrack]] by [[Miles Davis]] and the relationship the film establishes among music, image, and emotion were considered ground-breaking.\n\n==Plot==\nLovers Florence Carala and Julien Tavernier make a plan to kill Florence's husband Simon, a wealthy French industrialist who is also Julien's boss. Staying late at the office one Saturday, Julien, an ex-[[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] parachutist and veteran of the [[First Indochina War|Indochinese]] and [[Algerian War|Algerian]] wars, uses a rope to climb up the outside of the building to Simon's office and shoots Simon with Simon's own gun, afterward arranging the room to make it look like a suicide. He then makes his way back to his office and leaves the building with a secretary and security guard, who are to be his alibis. When he gets into his [[Chevrolet Styleline|convertible]], he glances up and sees he left the rope hanging from the building. Leaving the engine running, he rushes back into the building and boards the elevator. As it ascends, the security guard switches off the power and locks up for the weekend, trapping Julien between floors.\n\nMoments later, Julien's car is stolen by Louis, a young small-time crook, and his girlfriend V\u00e9ronique, a flower shop assistant. Waiting for Julien at a nearby caf\u00e9, Florence sees the car go by, with V\u00e9ronique leaning out the window. Assuming Julien could not go through with their plan and has picked up V\u00e9ronique, she wanders the [[Paris]] streets despondently all night, searching for him in local bars and clubs.\n\nLouis puts on Julien's coat and pockets Julien's [[revolver]], which V\u00e9ronique finds in the glovebox. They drive back and forth on the highway for hours, until some Germans in a [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SL|sporty Mercedes]] challenge Louis to a race. He follows them to a motel just off the highway, and the German driver, the jovial Horst Bencker, invites Louis and V\u00e9ronique to have a drink with him and his wife Frieda. Both couples check in and, while they chat, Frieda takes a few pictures of Louis and her husband with Julien's camera. She finishes the roll, so V\u00e9ronique drops the film off at the motel's photo lab.\n\nAfter the Benckers go to bed, Louis, worried because Horst had figured out he is not Julien Tavernier and annoyed because Horst had not taken him more seriously, attempts to steal the Mercedes, but Horst catches him and threatens him with a [[Cigar Tube]] held like a gun. Louis impulsively shoots and kills both Horst and Frieda with Julien's gun, firing until it is empty. He and V\u00e9ronique return to Paris in the Mercedes and hide in V\u00e9ronique's apartment. Convinced they will be caught and separated, V\u00e9ronique persuades Louis they should commit suicide, so they both swallow [[phenobarbital]] pills and go to sleep.\n\nBecause V\u00e9ronique registered at the motel using the names \"Mr. and Mrs. Julien Tavernier\" to avoid problems for Louis, who is wanted for petty crimes, and Julien's car, gun, and raincoat are found next to the Benckers' corpses, the police name Julien as the prime suspect. Officers go to search his office, escorted by the security guard, who eventually discovers Simon's body. Meanwhile, with the building's power back on, Julien finally escapes from the elevator. Unaware his picture is in the morning newspapers in connection to the Bencker case, he goes to the caf\u00e9 for some breakfast, but is quickly recognized, arrested, and charged with killing the Benckers, the police refusing to believe his alibi of being stuck in an elevator.\n\nFlorence, determined to clear Julien, gets V\u00e9ronique's address from the florist. She finds V\u00e9ronique and Louis drowsy, but alive, and calls the police with an anonymous tip. Louis reads the newspaper and thinks he has gotten away with murder, until V\u00e9ronique reminds him of the roll of film. He rushes to the motel's photo lab, tailed by Florence, but finds the pictures have already been developed, and he is arrested. Florence enters the lab, and the police show her the photographs of her and Julien that were on the roll, which make it clear they were secret lovers and give them a motive for killing her husband. Commissaire Cherrier says Florence will probably get a harsher sentence than Julien, but she, almost in a trance, replies that she did what she did for love and she and Julien will one day be reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jeanne Moreau]] as Florence Carala\n* [[Maurice Ronet]] as Julien Tavernier\n* [[Georges Poujouly]] as Louis\n* [[Yori Bertin]] as V\u00e9ronique\n* [[Jean Wall]] as Simon Carala\n* [[Lino Ventura]] as Police Commissaire Cherrier\n* [[F\u00e9lix Marten]] as Christian Subervie\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Petrovich]] as Horst Bencker\n* [[Elga Andersen]] as Frieda Bencker\n* Micheline Bona as Genevi\u00e8ve, the secretary\n* [[G\u00e9rard Darrieu]] as Maurice, the daytime security guard\n* [[Charles Denner]] as Commissaire Cherrier's Deputy\n* [[Hubert Deschamps]] as Deputy Prosecutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Jean-Claude Brialy]] makes an uncredited appearance as a motel guest.\n\n==Production==\nThis low-budget black-and-white production was 24-year-old [[Louis Malle]]'s first feature film. He had previously worked with [[Jacques Cousteau]] for several years, and was credited as co-director of the documentary ''[[The Silent World]]'' (1956).\n\nMalle cast [[Jeanne Moreau|Moreau]] after seeing her in the Paris stage production of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]''. She had already been in a number of films, but her role in this film is often considered her breakthrough. Malle filmed her without the heavy makeup and extreme lighting that previous directors had demanded. Scenes of Moreau wandering down the [[Champs Elysees]] at night were shot on fast film from a baby carriage using only available light from the street and shop windows.\n\n[[Miles Davis]]'s [[Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (soundtrack)|score for the film]] is considered by many to be groundbreaking,<ref name=\"romina\">{{cite book|quote=A detailed analysis on the movie and on this relationship from a critical, linguistic and aesthetical point of view, can be found in this book.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol0P0uHrn7AC|last=Daniele|first=Romina|title=Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud, Il luogo della musica nell'audiovisione|year=2011|publisher=RDM|location=Milan, Italy|isbn=9788890490590}}</ref> with jazz critic Phil Johnson describing it as \"The loneliest trumpet sound you will ever hear, and the model for sad-core music ever since. Hear it and weep.\"<ref>{{citation|author=Johnson, Phil|title=Discs: Jazz\u2014Miles Davis/''Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud'' (Fontana)|work=Independent on Sunday|date=14 March 2004}}</ref> Recorded in one night, it was improvised by Davis and four other musicians while they watched the relevant scenes from the film. The music influenced the later development of Davis's music and jazz in general, as well as soundtracks in later movies.\n\n==Critical response==\nFor ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the journalist Barry Farrell wrote:\n{{Blockquote|Moreau had 20 forgettable films behind her...Malle put Moreau under an honest light and wisely let his camera linger. The film was nothing special, but it did accomplish one thing: it proposed a new ideal of cinematic realism, a new way to look at a woman. All the drama in the story was in Moreau's face &ndash; the face that had been hidden behind cosmetics and flattering lights in all her earlier films. When Malle [made] ''[[The Lovers (1958 film)|The Lovers]]'' the following year, it was obvious who his woman would be. For one thing, he had discovered her, and for another, they were in love.<ref name=\"T01\">[[Barry Farrell (journalist)|Farrell, Barry]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20121106154431/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839333-4,00.html#ixzz18tO2nf1J \"Actresses: Making the Most of Love\" (subscription access only)], ''Time'' cover story pp. 4-5, 5 March 1965. Retrieved 21 March 2015.</ref>}}\n\nIn a review written for the film's 2005 theatrical re-release, [[Roger Ebert]] observed that Moreau's face when Florence is pondering Julien's whereabouts \"is often illuminated only by the lights of the cafes and shops that she passes; at a time when actresses were lit and photographed with care, these scenes had a shock value, and influenced many films to come.\" He further argued that Louis and Veronique were a precursor to the young couple in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' (1960).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/elevator-to-the-gallows-2005 |title=Elevator to the Gallows Movie Review (2005) |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=15 September 2005 |access-date=26 July 2016}}</ref>  In a 2016 article, ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' film critic [[Richard Brody]] claimed the film is more important for its place in French film history than for its own artistic merits, with the exception of Miles Davis' score, which he said \"is worth hearing entirely on its own. It\u2019s better than the film itself, by far, and there are better ways to hear it than in the movie\u2014namely, by listening to a CD that features the entire studio sessions from which the score was edited.\" Brody then went on to discuss the music in some detail.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Brody|first=Richard|date=August 3, 2016|title=Lous Malle's 'Elevator to the Gallows' and Its Historic Miles Davis Soundtrack|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/louis-malles-elevator-to-the-gallows-and-its-historic-miles-davis-soundtrack|access-date=November 17, 2020|magazine=The New Yorker}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 93% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 56 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.08/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elevator_to_the_gallows/|title=Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (Elevator to the Gallows) (Lift to the Scaffold) (Frantic)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=7 July 2019}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it holds a rating of 94/100, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/frantic-re-release|title=Frantic [re-release]|publisher=Metacritic}}</ref>\n\n==Remakes==\nThere have been two film adaptations of Calef's novel since Malle's version: ''Shikeidai No Ereb\u00eat\u00e2'' (2010), by Japanese filmmaker [[Akira Ogata (film director)|Akira Ogata]], and ''Weekend'' (2013), by Russian filmmaker [[Stanislav Govorukhin]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0051378}}\n* {{Amg movie|18507}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=75606}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|elevator_to_the_gallows}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2642-chef-du-cinema-elevator-to-the-gallows ''Chef du Cinema: Elevator to the Gallows''] an essay by [[Terrence Rafferty]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Louis Malle}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elevator To The Gallows}}\n[[Category:1958 films]]\n[[Category:1958 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1950s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1950s psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:French black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:French psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:1950s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Film noir]]\n[[Category:Louis Delluc Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Films based on French novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on crime novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Louis Malle]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Miles Davis]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Roger Nimier]]\n[[Category:1950s French films]]"}]}}}}
