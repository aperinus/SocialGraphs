Lee Thompson]] from a screenplay by [[Carl Foreman]], based on [[Alistair MacLean]]'s 1957 novel [[The Guns of Navarone (novel)|of the same name]]. Foreman also produced the film. The film stars [[Gregory Peck]], [[David Niven]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], along with [[Stanley Baker]], [[Anthony Quayle]], [[Irene Papas]], [[Gia Scala]], [[James Darren]] and [[Richard Harris]]. The book and the film share a plot: the efforts of an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[commando]] unit to destroy a seemingly impregnable German [[fortress]] that threatens Allied naval ships in the [[Aegean Sea]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Marble caves on Palmaria island (Liguria, Italy).jpg|thumb|262px|Cliffs of Navarone showing openings to gun positions were portrayed in the film by marble quarries on the island of [[Palmaria (island)|Palmaria]].<ref>ViaggiArt, 2022: [https://viaggiart.com/en/portovenere/point-of-interest/140711/isola-di-palmaria-sito-unesco-cinque-terre.html Isola di Palmaria].</ref>]]\nIn 1943, the [[Axis powers]] plan an assault on the island of [[Leros]], where [[Battle of Leros|2,000 British soldiers are marooned]], to display their military strength and convince neutral Turkey to join them. Rescue by the [[Royal Navy]] is prevented by two massive [[radar]]-directed [[large-calibre artillery|large-calibre gun]]s on (fictional) nearby [[Navarone Island]]. When aerial bombing efforts fail, Allied Intelligence gathers a [[commando]] unit to infiltrate Navarone and destroy the guns. Led by Major Roy Franklin, the team is composed of Captain Keith Mallory, a renowned spy and an officer with the [[Long Range Desert Group]] (LRDG); Colonel Andrea Stavros from the defeated [[Hellenic Army|Greek Army]]; Franklin's best friend Corporal Miller, an explosives expert and former chemistry teacher; [[Greek Americans|Greco-American]] Spyros Pappadimos, a native of Navarone; and \"The Butcher of Barcelona\" Brown, an engineer and expert knife fighter.\n\nDisguised as Greek fishermen on a decrepit fishing vessel, they sail across the [[Aegean Sea]], where they successfully overwhelm the crew of a German patrol boat intercepting them. Later in the voyage, Mallory confides to Franklin that Stavros had sworn to kill him after the war because Mallory was inadvertently responsible for the deaths of Stavros's wife and children. After being shipwrecked on the coast of Navarone during a storm, the experienced [[Mountaineering|mountaineer]] Mallory leads the team in a climb up the cliff, during which Franklin badly injures his leg. While taking shelter in the mountains, Mallory stops Franklin from killing himself and lies to him that their mission is only a diversion and that a major naval attack will be mounted on the coast instead. They rendezvous with two local resistance fighters, Spyros' sister Maria and her friend Anna, who was once captured and tortured by the Germans before escaping.\n\nGerman soldiers continually dog the mission. The group is eventually captured in the town of Mandrakos by [[Oberleutnant]] Muesel while trying to find a doctor for Franklin (whose leg is infected with [[gangrene]]). While being interrogated by SS [[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] Sessler, Stavros distracts the Germans and the team overpower their captors. They escape in German uniforms, leaving Franklin behind to receive medical attention. In due course, Franklin is injected with [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] and gives up Mallory's misinformation. As Mallory had hoped, most forces leave the fortress to counter the expected coastal attack. Upon infiltrating the village of Navarone, however, Miller discovers most of his explosives have been sabotaged and deduces that Anna is the culprit. She confesses that she did not escape but that the Germans recruited her as an informer in exchange for her release. Mallory reluctantly prepares to execute Anna as a precaution against detection, but Maria shoots her instead.\n\nThe team splits up: Mallory and Miller go for the guns, Stavros and Spyros create distractions in town (assisted by local residents), and Maria and Brown steal a boat for their escape. Spyros dies in a stand-off with a German officer, and Brown is stabbed during the boat theft due to his reluctance to kill the German. Meanwhile, Mallory and Miller infiltrate the gun emplacement but set off an alarm when they seal the doors behind them. Miller plants explosives on the guns and prepares a large booby trap below an [[ammunition hoist]], with a trigger device set into the track of the hoist. The Germans eventually gain entry into the gun emplacement and defuse the explosives planted on the guns; meanwhile, Mallory and Miller make their escape down the cliff and are picked up from the sea by the stolen boat. A wounded Stavros is also able to reach the sea and is helped aboard by Mallory, thus resolving the blood feud between them.\n\nAs the Allied destroyers trying to rescue the trapped British troops appear, the Germans open fire at them. When the hoist eventually reaches Miller's trigger, the hidden explosives set off the surrounding shells in a massive explosion, which destroys the guns and the entire fortress. Mallory's team safely reaches the British convoy. However, Stavros shakes Mallory's hand and decides to return to Navarone with Maria, with whom he has fallen in love. Mallory and Miller, returning home, observe the aftermath of their success from a destroyer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Captain Keith Mallory\n* [[David Niven]] as Cpl John Anthony Miller\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as Colonel Andrea Stavros\n* [[Stanley Baker]] as CPO Butcher Brown\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as Major Roy Franklin\n* [[James Darren]] as Spyros Pappadimos\n* [[Irene Papas]] as Maria Pappadimos\n* [[Gia Scala]] as Anna\n* [[James Robertson Justice]] as Jensen (also opening narration)\n* [[Richard Harris]] as Squadron Leader Barnsby\n* [[Bryan Forbes]] as Cohn\n* [[Allan Cuthbertson]] as Major Baker\n* [[Michael Trubshawe]] as Weaver\n* [[Percy Herbert (actor)|Percy Herbert]] as Grogan\n* [[George Mikell]] as Sessler\n* [[Walter Gotell]] as Muesel\n* [[Tutte Lemkow]] as Nicolai\n* [[Albert Lieven]] as Commandant\n* [[Norman Wooland]] as Group Captain\n* Cleo Scouloudi as Bride\n* Nicholas Papakonstantinou as Patrol Boat Captain\n* [[Christopher Rhodes]] as German Gunnery Officer\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], who had a brief (three films) career as an uncredited [[Extra (acting)|extra]] before becoming [[music manager]] of such popular British bands as [[the Yardbirds]], [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Bad Company]], played an uncredited British commando.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was part of a cycle of big-budget World War II adventures that included ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957), ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962) and ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963). MacLean's novel had been a [[bestseller]] and was read by [[Mike Frankovich]], head of Columbia Pictures, who became excited as to its cinematic possibilities. He showed it to Carl Foreman, who had written ''Bridge on the River Kwai'' and had a producing deal with Columbia, who was not as enthusiastic at first, in part because he knew how difficult making a movie version would be. Foreman eventually changed his mind and agreed to make the movie.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jack|last=Webster|title=Alistair MacLean: A Life|year=1991|publisher=Chapmans|pages=101\u2013103}}</ref> The novel had been inspired by the [[Battle of Leros]] during the [[Dodecanese Campaign]] of [[World War II]] but the guns on Leros were {{cvt|152|mm|in|0}}, not the huge guns described in the book and the film.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2u5ZDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT280|title=Churchill's Folly: The Battles for Kos and Leros, 1943|isbn=9780750969581|access-date=20 February 2021|last1=Rogers|first1=Anthony|last2=Jellicoe|first2=Lord|date=2 February 2017}}</ref> The screenplay, adapted by producer [[Carl Foreman]], made significant changes from the novel; these included changing the gender of the local resistance fighters and inventing a conflict between Mallory and Andrea.\n\nForeman wanted to direct as well, but Columbia refused, insisting on a British director.

Quinn was so taken with the area that he bought land there in an area still called Anthony Quinn Bay. Some further scenes were shot on the islands of [[Gozo]], near [[Malta]], and [[Tino (island)|Tino]], in the [[Ligurian Sea]]. One of the warships in the film, the [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Slater|DE-766|6}}, then a training ship in the [[Hellenic Navy]] known as ''Aetos'' (D-01), is preserved as a [[museum ship]] in [[Albany, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Aboard the U.S.S.

Since key scenes with Niven remained incomplete, and it was doubtful whether he would return to finish the film, the entire production was in jeopardy. Reshooting key scenes throughout the film with another actor and abandoning the project to collect the insurance were contemplated. Against medical advice, Niven felt obligated to complete his work and agreed to shoot and complete his scenes. However, he relapsed and did not recover for another seven weeks.\n\nA complication arose when it was found that Gregory Peck, whose character was supposed to be fluent in German, could not speak the language convincingly. Voice actor [[Robert Rietty]] dubbed all of Peck's German dialogue for the film.<ref>''A Forehead Pressed Against a Window'' by [[Robert Rietty]], pp. 318\u2013319</ref> The film's maps were created by [[Halas and Batchelor]], a British team best known for their animated films. Although the island of Navarone is fictional, a map depicted in the film purporting to show the island of Navarone shows it as the real island of [[Antikythera]]. Several members of the [[Greek Royal Family|Greek royal family]] visited the set the day the Mandrakos cafe scene was filmed and appear in the background as extras.<ref>{{cite news |last=Perry |first=Vern |date=June 8, 2000 |title='Guns of Navarone' high-caliber |work=[[The Orange County Register]] |page=31}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's score was composed by [[Dimitri Tiomkin]] and featured arrangements of several traditional songs.\n* \"The Guns of Navarone\" (music by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by [[Paul Francis Webster]])\n* \"Karagouna\" (traditional, arranged by Andreas Markides)\n* \"Ena Karavi Apo Ti Chio\" (traditional, arranged by Andreas Markides)\n* \"Yalo Yalo\" (traditional, arranged by Andreas Markides)\n* \"Treu Sein\" (music by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Alfred Perry)\n* \"Das Sundenlied\" (music by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Alfred Perry)\n\nTiomkin's theme song featured on the soundtrack album with lyrics recounting the film's plot. His theme became a popular instrumental with several [[cover version]]s including [[Guns of Navarone (song)|a 1965 version]] by [[The Skatalites]].

After RCA Columbia Pictures Home Video was formed in 1982, the movie was released on [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]] and [[Laserdisc]]. The Laserdisc version is 157 minutes in 4:3 format. In 1985, the movie was released on reprints on VHS and Betamax, maintaining the 145-minute runtime.\n\nAfter two more reprints on VHS and Betamax under RCA Columbia Pictures Home Video, the company became Columbia TriStar Home Video.  The movie was featured on VHS in 1993 as part of the Columbia Classics Studio Heritage Collection, changing the posted running time to 157 minutes. There was also a Laserdisc reprint at the same time. In 1998, the company re-released the movie in widescreen as a Widescreen Presentation. With this release, the running time was changed to 167 minutes. In 2000, the movie was re-released on VHS as a Remastered Special Edition, featuring a new featurette 'Great Guns' and a brand-new master. Once again, the running time was dropped down to 157 minutes.\n\nOver the next several years, the movie was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], sometimes as part of a package with other classics of the genre and era \u2014 such as ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and '' [[Force 10 from Navarone (film)|Force 10 From Navarone]]''.
