When one of the four, Big Al ([[Louis Lombardi]]) is found shot to death, the other three learn that the latest money they stole actually belonged to a local L.A. [[crime]] lord called The King ([[Dustin Hoffman]]). Jake proposes that the grifters work for the King and steal money from Morgan Price ([[Robert Forster]]), a rival who owns a bank.\n\nJake enlists the aid of his remaining partners, Gordo ([[Paul Giamatti]]) and Miles ([[Brian Van Holt]]), and also convinces an independent con artist named Lily ([[Rachel Weisz]]) to round out their foursome. The King, a ruthless killer who has [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], demands that one of his men, Lupus ([[Franky G]]), also come along.\n\nThe con involves bribing a bank vice president into wiring money offshore.  The plan hits a snag when Special Agent Gunther Butan ([[Andy Garc\u00eda]]) shows up in L.A., looking to finally bust Jake, whom he has followed for years.  Butan forces corrupt LAPD detectives Omar Manzano ([[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]]) and Lloyd Whitworth ([[Donal Logue]]) to switch their allegiance from Jake to him.\n\nAfter hearing about Butan's arrival, a nervous Jake pulls the plug on the whole con. He screams at Lily, making her walk out. Lupus gets Jake to reconsider nixing the con, hinting that The King will torture and kill the grifters if the plan falls short. The con is back on, though now without Lily's help.\n\nThe bribed bank VP wires the money to Gordo in Belize. Gordo brings it to Ontario Airport, where he is met by both Butan and The King's men, both sides after the $5 million in a duffel bag. Butan arrests The King and confiscates the money.\n\nGordo disappears. Lupus, thinking the King has the money, reveals he was the one who killed Jake's grifter friend. Lupus holds Jake at gunpoint, but is shot by Travis ([[Morris Chestnut]]), a henchman for Morgan Price. It turns out that when Lily walked out, she went straight to Price himself and revealed the entire con, which was taking place that minute. Price told Travis to locate Jake and find out exactly how the con was engineered, to stop such a thing from ever happening again.\n\nTravis takes Jake to an abandoned lot and forces him to explain the entire story. A furious Lily takes out a gun and shoots Jake. Travis demands that he and Lily both disappear immediately.  Minutes later, Butan arrives in a car and Jake sits up from a pool of blood, unharmed.\n\nThe final parts of the con are revealed. Lily's \"quitting\" was faked\u2014a set-up to confuse Lupus. Butan is actually an old confidant of Jake's. He managed to \"confiscate\" the money and arrest The King at the same time. Butan has the money and it's split five ways. Jake was wearing [[bullet hit squib|squibs]] to fake his own death in the lot.\n\nIn the end, everyone was in on everything except for The King and Lupus (the first marks), Price and Travis (the second, bigger marks), and the two corrupt LAPD detectives, who have been arrested. The four grifters reunite and celebrate by driving off into the night.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Edward Burns]] as Jake Vig<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Screen Hustles, Grifts and Stings: Stings, Grifts, Hustles and the Long Con|last=Sargeant|first=Amy|year=2016|pages=63}}</ref>\n*[[Rachel Weisz]] as Lily<ref name=\":0\" />\n*[[Andy Garc\u00eda]] as Special Agent Gunther Butan<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andy-garcias-confidence/|title=Andy Garcia's 'Confidence'|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>\n*[[Dustin Hoffman]] as Winston \"The King\" King<ref name=\":1\" />\n*[[Paul Giamatti]] as Gordo<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2003/02/06/confidence/|title=Confidence|website=EW.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>\n*[[Brian Van Holt]] as Miles\n*[[Franky G]] as Lupus\n*[[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] as Officer Omar Manzano\n*[[Donal Logue]] as Officer Lloyd Whitworth\n*[[Morris Chestnut]] as Travis\n*[[Louis Lombardi]] as Alphonse \"Big Al\" Moorley\n*[[John Carroll Lynch]] as Leon Ashby\n*[[Robert Forster]] as Morgan Price\n*[[Leland Orser]] as Lionel Dolby\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was filmed on location at the Deep Nightclub in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], in [[Los Angeles]] and in [[Ontario, California]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Confidence'' received good reviews from critics, as the film holds a 70% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] said, \"''Confidence'' is a flawless exercise about con games, and that is precisely its failing: It is an exercise. It fails to make us care, even a little, about the characters and what happens to them. There is nothing at stake. The screenplay gives away the game by having the entire story narrated in flashback by the hero, who treats it not as an adventure but as a series of devious deceptions which he can patiently explain to the man holding a gun on him--and to us. At the end, we can see how smart he is and how everybody was fooled, but we don't care. ... That's not to say the movie, directed by James Foley, is badly made. It's great-looking, with its [[film noir]] reds and greens and blues, its neon Bud Ice signs, its shadows and mean streets, its sleazy strip clubs and its use of wipes and swish-pans (sideways, up, down, sometimes two at a time). You know this is a crime movie, which is nice to be reminded of, except that every reminder also tells us it's only a movie, so that there is no possibility that we can commit to the characters, worry about them, want them to succeed or fail.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/confidence-2003 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Confidence |date=April 25, 2003 |website=RogerEbert.com |access-date=2015-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Remake ==\nThe film was remade in [[Bollywood]] titled ''[[Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena (film)|Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0310910|title=Confidence}}\n*{{Mojo title|confidence|Confidence}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|confidence|Confidence}}\n\n{{James Foley}}\n\n[[Category:2003 films]]\n[[Category:2003 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by James Foley]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate films]]\n[[Category:Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Christophe Beck]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
