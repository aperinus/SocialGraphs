Pictures]], based on {{nowrap|[[J. K. Rowling]]'s}} [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|1997 novel of the same name]]. Produced by [[David Heyman]] and written by [[Steve Kloves]], it is the first instal<!-- British English \"instalment\", not US \"installment\"-->ment of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]]. The film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], with [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]]. Its story follows Harry's first year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as he discovers that he is a famous [[magician (fantasy)|wizard]] and begins his formal wizarding education.\n\nWarner Bros. bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported \u00a31 million ($1.65 million). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Chris Columbus being chosen to create the film from a short list of directors that included [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Rob Reiner]]. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, with the three leads chosen in August 2000 following open casting calls. The film was shot at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]] and historic buildings around the United Kingdom, from September 2000 to March 2001.\n\nThe film was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 10 and 11 November 2001 for two days of previews. It opened on 16 November in the United States, Canada, and Taiwan as well as officially in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $974 million at the box office worldwide during its initial run, and over $1 billion with subsequent re-releases. It became the [[2001 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2001]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film]] at the time. The film was nominated for many awards, including [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. It was followed by seven sequels, beginning with ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' in 2002 and ending with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]'' in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- IMPORTANT NOTICE: Plot summaries for films should be between 400-700 words.

When the abusive Dursleys refuse to allow Harry to open any and flee to an island hut, Hagrid arrives to personally deliver Harry's letter of acceptance to  Hogwarts. Hagrid also reveals that Harry's parents, [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter|Lily]], were killed by a dark wizard named [[Lord Voldemort]]. The killing curse that Voldemort had cast rebounded, destroying Voldemort's body and giving Harry his lightning-bolt scar. Hagrid then takes Harry to [[Diagon Alley]] for school supplies and gives him a pet [[snowy owl]] whom he names [[Hedwig (Harry Potter)|Hedwig]]. Harry buys a wand that is connected to Voldemort's own wand.\n\nAt [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]], Harry boards the [[Hogwarts Express]] train. He meets [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], a [[Muggle-born]] witch. Arriving at Hogwarts, Harry also meets [[Draco Malfoy]], who is from a wealthy, pure-blood wizard family. The two immediately form a rivalry. The students assemble in the Great Hall where the [[Sorting Hat]] sorts the first-years in four respective houses: [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], [[Ravenclaw]], and [[Slytherin]]. Harry is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin, a house noted for dark wizards.\n\nAs Harry studies magic, he learns more about his parents and Voldemort. Harry's natural talent for [[Broomsticks in Harry Potter|broomstick]] flying gets him recruited as the youngest-ever Seeker for Gryffindor's [[Quidditch]] team in a century. While returning to the Gryffindor common room, the staircases change paths, leading Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the third floor, which is restricted. There they discover a giant three-headed dog named [[Fluffy (Harry Potter)|Fluffy]]. On Halloween, Ron insults Hermione after she shows off in [[Magic in Harry Potter#Charms|Charms]] class. Upset, Hermione spends the afternoon crying in the girls' bathroom. That night, a giant marauding [[Troll (Harry Potter)|troll]] enters it, but Harry and Ron save Hermione, and the three make up and become close friends after Hermione takes the blame by claiming she went looking for the troll.\n\nThe trio discover that Fluffy is guarding the [[Philosopher's stone (Harry Potter)|philosopher's stone]], a magical object that can turn metal into gold and produce an immortality elixir. Harry suspects that [[Potions (Harry Potter)|Potions]] teacher and head of Slytherin House, [[Severus Snape]], wants the stone to return Voldemort to physical form. When Hagrid accidentally reveals that music puts Fluffy asleep, Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide to find the stone before Snape. Fluffy is already asleep, but the trio face other barriers, including a deadly plant called Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys, and a giant chess game that knocks out Ron.\n\nAfter overcoming the barriers, Harry discovers that [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Quirinus Quirrell]] wants the stone; Snape had figured it out and had been protecting Harry. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weakened Voldemort living on the back of his head. Dumbledore's protective enchantment places the stone in Harry's possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for resurrecting his parents, but Harry sees through his trick and refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry. When Harry touches Quirrell's skin, it burns Quirrell, reducing him to ashes. Voldemort's soul rises from the pile and escapes, knocking out Harry as it passes through him.\n\nHarry recovers in the school infirmary. Dumbledore says the stone has been destroyed to prevent misuse, and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore reveals how Harry defeated Quirrell: When Lily died to save Harry, a love-based protection against Voldemort was placed on him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroism, tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to their housemate [[Neville Longbottom]] for having had the courage to stand up to the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, happy to finally have a real home at Hogwarts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]:<br /> An 11-year-old orphan living with his unwelcoming aunt, uncle, and cousin, who learns of his own fame as a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] known to have survived his parents' murder at the hands of the dark wizard Lord Voldemort as an infant when he is accepted to [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Columbus had wanted Radcliffe for the role since he saw him in the [[BBC]]'s production of ''[[David Copperfield (1999 film)|David Copperfield]]'', before the open casting sessions had taken place, but had been told by casting director Susan Figgis that Radcliffe's protective parents would not allow their son to take the part.<ref name=\"JensenEW2001p5\" /> Columbus explained that his persistence in giving Radcliffe the role was responsible for Figgis' resignation.<ref name=\"JensenEW2001p5\" /> Radcliffe was asked to audition in 2000, when Heyman and Kloves met him and his parents at a production of ''[[Stones in His Pockets]]'' in London.<ref name=\"KoltnowEVT2007\" /> Heyman and Columbus successfully managed to convince Radcliffe's parents that their son would be protected from media intrusion, and they agreed to let him play Harry.<ref name=\"JensenEW2001p5\" /> Rowling approved of Radcliffe's casting, stating that \"having seen [his] screen test I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\"<ref name=\"SussmanCNN2000p2\" /> Radcliffe was reportedly paid \u00a31 million for the film, although he felt the fee was \"not that important\" to him.<ref name=\"TheTimes2001\" /> [[William Moseley (actor)|William Moseley]], who was later cast as [[Peter Pevensie]] in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series, also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"CarrollMTV2008\" /> The Saunders triplets appear as Harry as a baby.<ref name=\"SaundersBuzzFeed\" />\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]]:<br /> Harry's best friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family.

Night Shyamalan]] and [[Peter Weir]].<ref name=\"JensenEW2001p3\" /><ref name=\"SchmitzYahoo\" /><ref name=\"DouglasComingSoon2006\" /> Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000,<ref name=\"LinderIGNJul2000\" /> and the choice was narrowed down to Silberling, Columbus, Parker and Gilliam.<ref name=\"DavidsonIGN2000\" /> Rowling's first choice director was Terry Gilliam,<ref name=\"BeyondHogwarts2005\" /> but Warner Bros. chose Columbus, citing his work on other family films such as ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990) and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993) as influences for their decision.<ref name=\"LinderIGNJun2000\" /> Columbus had become a fan of the book series after his daughter persuaded him to read the first three books, leading him to call his agent to arrange a meeting at Warner Bros. to direct the film. When his agent told him that at least 25 other directors were eager to helm the project, Columbus requested his agent to secure his meeting to be the last one so he could give a \"lasting impression\" and be the studio's \"freshest person in their memory\". During two weeks of waiting, Columbus wrote a 130-page director's version of the screenplay to explain his vision for the film's tone. The day of his meeting with Warner executives including [[Alan F. Horn]], Columbus delivered an \"impassioned 45-minute talk\" and showed them his annotated script. Weeks later, the studio notified Columbus that he had gotten the job and sent him to Scotland to meet with Rowling and Heyman.<ref name=\"PerezTHRNov2021\" /> Columbus pitched his vision of the film for two hours, stating that he wanted the Muggle scenes \"to be bleak and dreary\" but those set in the wizarding world \"to be steeped in color, mood, and detail.\" He took inspiration from [[David Lean]]'s adaptations of ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946) and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1948), wishing to use \"that sort of darkness, that sort of edge, that quality to the cinematography,\" while being further inspired by the colour designs from ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972).<ref name=\"JensenEW2001p3\" />\n\n[[Steve Kloves]] was selected to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as \"tough\", as it did not \"lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books.\"<ref name=\"SragowSalon2000\" /> Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he \"almost never read\", but ''Harry Potter'' jumped out at him.<ref name=\"JensenEW2001p2\" /> He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series.<ref name=\"SragowSalon2000\" /> When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters.<ref name=\"SragowSalon2000\" /> Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to \"[destroy] her baby.\"<ref name=\"JensenEW2001p2\" /> Rowling admitted that she \"was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves,\" but recalled her initial meeting with him: \"The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.'

Upon consultation with Rowling, it was agreed that Harry could have blue eyes.<ref name=\"ConversationJK&Radcliffe\" />\n\n===Design and special effects===\n[[Judianna Makovsky]] served as the costume designer. She re-designed the Quidditch robes, having initially planned to use those shown on the cover of the American book, but deemed them \"a mess.\" Instead, she dressed the Quidditch players in \"preppie sweaters, 19th-century fencing breeches and arm guards.\"<ref name=\"CagleTime2001\" /> Production designer [[Stuart Craig]] built the sets at Leavesden Studios, including Hogwarts Great Hall, basing it on many English cathedrals. Although originally asked to use an existing old street to film the [[Diagon Alley]] scenes, Craig decided to build his own set, comprising [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] architecture.<ref name=\"CagleTime2001\" />\n\nColumbus originally planned to use both animatronics and CGI animation to create the magical creatures, including Fluffy.<ref name=\"LinderIGNMar2000\" /> Nick Dudman, who worked on ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', was given the task of creating the needed prosthetics, with [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] providing creature effects.<ref name=\"LinderIGNJan2001\" /> John Coppinger stated that the magical creatures that needed to be created had to be designed multiple times.<ref name=\"LinderIGNJan2001-2\" /> The film features nearly 600 special effects shots, involving numerous companies. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] created [[Lord Voldemort]]'s face on the back of Quirrell, [[Rhythm & Hues]] animated [[Norbert (Harry Potter)|Norbert]] (Hagrid's baby dragon); and [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] produced the [[Quidditch]] scenes.<ref name=\"JensenEW2001p6\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[File:John Williams tux.jpg|thumb|upright|right|John Williams composed the film's score.]]\n{{Main|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (soundtrack)}}\n[[John Williams]] was selected to compose the score, having previously collaborated with Chris Columbus for ''[[Home Alone]]'' and ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]''.<ref name=\"OliverIGN2000\" /> Williams composed the score at his homes in Los Angeles and [[Tanglewood]] before recording it in London in September 2001.

He added dialogue, of which Rowling approved. One of the lines originally included had to be removed after Rowling told him that it would directly contradict an event in the then-unreleased fifth ''Harry Potter'' novel ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''.<ref name=\"LinderIGNFeb2001-2\" />\n\nSeveral minor characters have been removed from the film version, most prominently [[Peeves]] the poltergeist. Actor [[Rik Mayall]] was cast in the role, but his scenes were ultimately cut from the film and never released. The book's first chapter, told from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley, is absent from the film. Harry and Draco's first encounter in [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions|Madam Malkin's robe shop]] and the midnight duel are not in the film. In the film, the responsibility of taking [[Rubeus Hagrid#Norbert|Norbert]] away is given to Dumbledore, while in the book, Harry and Hermione have to bring him by hand to [[Charlie Weasley]]'s friends.<ref name=\"DaddsDigitalSpy\" /> This necessitated a change in the detention plotline: in the book, Filch catches Harry and Hermione leaving the Astronomy Tower and puts them in detention with Neville and Malfoy, while in the film, all three protagonists receive detention after Malfoy finds them in Hagrid's hut after hours.<ref name=\"DaddsDigitalSpy\" /> According to Kloves, this was \"the one part of the book that [Rowling] felt easily could be changed\".<ref name=\"CagleTime2001\" /> The [[Quidditch]] pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers.<ref name=\"CagleTime2001\" />\n\nThe book's timeline is not enforced in the film.

name=\"TelegraphReview\" /><ref name=\"EmpireReview\" /> Brian Linder of ''[[IGN]]'' also gave the film a positive review, but concluded that it \"isn't perfect, but for me it's a nice supplement to a book series that I love\".<ref name=\"LinderIGNReview\" /> Although criticising the final half-hour, Jeanne Aufmuth of ''[[Palo Alto Online]]'' stated that the film would \"enchant even the most cynical of moviegoers.\"<ref name=\"PaloAltoReview\" /> ''[[USA Today]]'' reviewer Claudia Puig gave the film three out of four stars, especially praising the set design and [[Robbie Coltrane]]'s portrayal of Hagrid, but criticised [[John Williams]]' score and concluded \"ultimately many of the book's readers may wish for a more magical incarnation.\"<ref name=\"USATodayReview\" /> The sets, design, cinematography, effects and principal cast were all given praise from Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', although he deemed John Williams' score \"a great clanging, banging music box that simply will not shut up.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' compared the film positively with ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and put \"The script is faithful, the actors are just right, the sets, costumes, makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> [[Jonathan Foreman (journalist)|Jonathan Foreman]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' recalled that the film was \"remarkably faithful,\" to its literary counterpart as well as a \"consistently entertaining if overlong adaptation.\"<ref name=\"NYPostReview\" />\n\n[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, considered the film a \"by the numbers adaptation,\" criticising the pace and the \"charisma-free\" lead actors.<ref name=\"TimeReview\" /> [[CNN]]'s Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves \"are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative is more like a jamboree inside Rowling's head.\"<ref name=\"CNNReview\" /> Ed Gonzalez of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' wished that the film had been directed by [[Tim Burton]], finding the cinematography \"bland and muggy,\" and the majority of the film a \"solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo.\"<ref name=\"SlantReview\" /> [[Elvis Mitchell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was highly negative about the film, saying \"[the film] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve.\" He also said it suffered from \"a lack of imagination\" and wooden characters, adding, \"The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie.\"<ref name=\"NYTimesReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''Philosopher's Stone'' received three [[Academy Award]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume
