As of September 21, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 685 words. -->\nJames flees from a farmhouse and escapes into the woods. A screaming woman tries to follow, but is wounded by a gunshot. Lying on the ground, she is doused with gasoline and set on fire by Vincent and Simon. Deputy Sheriff Daniel Carter is on duty, sitting in his patrol car when he finds James crawling along the road and rushes him to the local hospital, which has been largely abandoned following a fire, where his estranged wife Allison Fraser works as a nurse. At the hospital are Dr. Richard Powell, nurse Beverly, intern Kim, pregnant patient Maggie, her grandfather Ben, and patient Cliff; with the staff at the hospital working as a skeleton crew. Daniel discovers an entranced Beverly murdering Cliff, her face flayed of skin. Beverly moves toward Daniel who shoots her dead. Daniel collapses due to a seizure and experiences a strange vision.\n\n[[State trooper]] Mitchell enters the hospital to collect James after discovering the bloody scene at the farmhouse. Daniel goes outside to call in Beverly's death from his patrol car, but is confronted by a robed cultist who wounds him. He manages to return to the hospital as cultists surround the building. James, Daniel and Mitchell find Beverly's corpse has transformed into a tentacled creature. Vincent and Simon enter the lobby and hold the group at gunpoint, demanding to get to James. James takes Maggie hostage to protect himself and stabs Powell, who falls to the floor. The Beverly-Creature appears and takes Mitchell, its tentacles penetrating his body. Vincent and Simon kill the Beverly-Creature and regroup with the others in the lobby, setting Mitchell's body on fire. Vincent and Simon accompany Daniel to retrieve a shotgun from a patrol car, while Allison ventures into the basement to collect medical supplies for delivering Maggie's baby. Powell manages to capture Allison. Daniel and Vincent go to search for her and find photographs and files indicating Powell was the cult's leader. Powell phones Daniel, taunting him and mentioning the vision Daniel experienced while unconscious.\n\nKim and Ben stay with Maggie while Daniel, Vincent, and Simon interrogate James. James explains that Powell has the power to transform people. The three men force James to come with them downstairs. Allison regains consciousness on an operating table where Powell explains he has found a way to defy death after the loss of his daughter Sarah. Having flayed off his face, Powell shows Allison that something now grows inside her. Daniel, Vincent, Simon, and James find a hidden area in the basement and end up surrounded by deformed corpses brought back to life. One of the creatures kills James as the other three men get separated.\n\nAs Maggie enters labor, Kim hesitates to perform a [[Caesarean section|C-section]]. As Ben pleads with Kim, Maggie stands and slits his throat, revealing she is carrying Dr. Powell's child. Kim hides as cultists enter the building and Maggie leaves. Daniel finds Allison in the operating room pregnant. He sees a tentacled creature extending from her body. Powell's voice speaks to Daniel, who attacks his wife's mutated remains with an axe. Daniel is transported to a morgue room with a glowing triangle on the wall. Powell's voice tells Daniel that he found the ability to conquer life and death. Powell promises that Daniel can have his child back if he is willing to die first.\n\nMaggie appears and stabs Daniel. Powell appears skinless and partly mutated in front of the triangle as Maggie kneels before him. Powell recites an incantation before the triangle as a now frightened Maggie's torso explodes, birthing the Sarah-Creature. Vincent and Simon arrive and battle it. The Sarah-Creature overcomes Vincent, but he covers it in [[isopropyl alcohol]], allowing Simon to set them both on fire with a flare. Powell tells Daniel he can be with Allison if he stops resisting and \"lets go\". Daniel refuses and tackles him, leading both men to tumble into the void. Meanwhile, the Sarah-Creature pursues Simon, who escapes and is teleported back to the hospital to reunite safely with Kim. Daniel and Allison are shown holding hands in another world beneath a black pyramid.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Aaron Poole]] as Daniel Carter\n* [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Dr. Richard Powell\n* [[Daniel Fathers]] as The Father / Vincent\n* [[Kathleen Munroe]] as Allison Fraser\n* [[Ellen Wong]] as Kim\n* Mik Byskov as The Son / Simon\n* Grace Munro as Maggie\n* Evan Stern as James\n* James Millington as Ben\n* [[Art Hindle]] as Mitchell\n* Stephanie Belding as Beverly\n* Matt Kennedy as Cliff Robertson\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nSince 2000, the Canadian film groups referring to themselves as Astron-6 began creating comedic horror films.<ref name=\"exclaim-interview\">{{cite web|url=https://exclaim.ca/film/article/the_void_jeremy_gillespie_steven_kostanski_suicide_squad_guillermo_del_toro|work=Exclaim!|title=Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski Explain How 'Suicide Squad' and Guillermo del Toro Helped Create 'The Void'|access-date=22 February 2018|date=31 March 2017|last=Lindsay|first=Cam}}</ref> Their films included ''[[Manborg]]'', ''[[Father's Day (2011 film)|Father's Day]]'' and ''[[The Editor (film)|The Editor]]''.<ref name=\"exclaim-interview\" /> ''The Void'' differed from the previous films being serious in tone, which led the group to not present it under the Astron-6 name.<ref name=\"exclaim-interview\" />\n\nJeremy Gillespie was initially working at Pinewood on a floor below where [[Guillermo del Toro]] was working on the unfinished film ''At the Mountains of Madness'', recalling hearing him state that he wanted to do a [[HP Lovecraft]] film in a way that hadn't been done before.<ref name=\"exclaim-interview\" /> After hearing this, Gillespie felt that this \"sort of got the wheels in my mind working, trying to think of what that might be.
