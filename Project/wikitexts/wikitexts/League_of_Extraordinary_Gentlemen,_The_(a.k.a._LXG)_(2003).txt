Distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], it was released on 11 July 2003 in the United States, and 17 October in the United Kingdom. It was directed by [[Stephen Norrington]] and starred [[Sean Connery]], [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Peta Wilson]], [[Tony Curran]], [[Stuart Townsend]], [[Shane West]], [[Jason Flemyng]], and [[Richard Roxburgh]]. It was Connery's final role in a theatrically released live-action film before his retirement in 2006 and death in 2020.\n\nAs with the comic book source material, the film features prominent [[pastiche]] and [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] themes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-v281053|work=Allmovie|title=The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|author=Tobey, Matthew|access-date=November 10, 2012}}</ref> set in the late 19th century. It features an assortment of fictional literary characters appropriate to the period who act as [[Victorian era]] [[superhero]]es. It draws on the works of [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Bram Stoker]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Ian Fleming]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Gaston Leroux]], and [[Mark Twain]], albeit all adapted for the film.\n\nIt received generally unfavorable reviews but was financially successful, grossing over $179&nbsp;million worldwide in theaters, and earning rental revenue of $48.6&nbsp;million and DVD sales (as of 2003) of $36.4&nbsp;million, against its $78 million budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/TLOEG.php|title=The Numbers: Box Office Data|access-date=October 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1899, a terrorist group led by the [[Fant\u00f4mas|Fantom]] breaks into the [[Bank of England]] to steal [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s blueprints of [[Venice]]'s foundations. They then kidnap several [[German Empire|German]] scientists while blowing up a zeppelin factory.\n\nThe [[British Empire]] sends Sanderson Reed to [[Kenya Colony]] to recruit adventurer and hunter [[Allan Quatermain]], who had retired following the death of his son. Quatermain at first refuses until a group of assassins is sent to kill him, resulting in the death of his longtime friend, Nigel. In [[London]], Quatermain meets \"[[M (James Bond)|M]]\", who explains that the Fantom plans to start a world war by bombing a secret meeting of world leaders in Venice. To prevent this, M is forming the latest generation of the [[History of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen|League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]], consisting of Quatermain, [[Captain Nemo]], [[vampire]] chemist [[Mina Harker]], and [[The Invisible Man in popular culture#In other media|invisible thief Rodney Skinner]].\n\nThe League travels to the [[London Docklands]] to recruit [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]], Mina's former lover who is immortal due to a missing cursed portrait. The Fantom and his assassins attack but the League, aided by [[U.S. Secret Service]] Agent [[Tom Sawyer]], fends them off. Gray and Sawyer join the League. They then capture [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Edward Hyde]] in [[Paris]], who transforms back into his alter ego, [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll]], and joins the League after being offered amnesty. The League travels to Venice in Nemo's submarine, the ''[[Nautilus (fictional submarine)|Nautilus]]'', but they soon deduce there may be a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] on board when a camera's [[flash powder]] residue is found in the wheelhouse and one of Jekyll's transformation formulas disappears. Suspicion falls on the missing Skinner.\n\nThe ''Nautilus'' arrives in Venice just as the bombs detonate, causing the [[Piazza San Marco]] and the rest of the city to start collapsing. Sawyer uses Nemo's automobile to stop the destruction, while Quatermain confronts the Fantom, who is unmasked as M. Dorian, the traitor, murders Nemo's [[Chief mate|first mate]] [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]] and steals the ''Nautilus''{{'s}} exploration pod. M and Dorian leave a [[phonograph]] recording for the League declaring that their true goal is to ignite the world war, and that Dorian has been collecting physical elements of the League to create a heavily armed version of the ''Nautilus'', invisible spies, vampire assassins, and Hyde-like soldiers, and to sell the superhuman formulas off to the highest bidder. The ''Nautilus'' is damaged by bombs hidden on board, but Hyde saves it by draining the flooded engine rooms. Skinner secretly messages the League, informing them that he has sneaked aboard the exploration pod and telling them to follow his heading.\n\nThe League reaches northern [[Mongolia]] where it reunites with Skinner and plots to destroy M's factory with explosives. Nemo and Hyde rescue the scientists and their families while fighting Dante who overdoses on the Hyde formula. Skinner sets the explosive charges, and Mina battles and eventually kills Dorian by exposing him to his portrait. Quatermain and Sawyer confront M and identify him as [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]], longtime archenemy of genius detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] who had changed identities following his [[The Final Problem|alleged death]] at the [[Reichenbach Falls]]. Sawyer is taken hostage by an invisible Reed; Quatermain shoots the latter, only to be fatally stabbed by Moriarty. Moriarty flees but Sawyer shoots and kills him and the formulas sink into the icy water. Quatermain then dies.\n\nQuatermain is buried beside his son in Kenya. The League recall how a [[witch doctor]] had blessed Quatermain for saving his village, promising that Africa would never let him die. The remaining League members\u2014Nemo, Mina, Skinner, Jekyll, and Sawyer\u2014depart, agreeing to keep using their powers for good in the coming 20th century. The witch doctor arrives and performs a ritual that summons an unnatural storm, with a bolt of lightning striking a rifle Sawyer left on Quatermain's grave.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Allan Quatermain]], an adventurer and hunter.\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as [[Captain Nemo]], the captain of the ''[[Nautilus (fictional submarine)|Nautilus]]''.\n* [[Peta Wilson]] as Dr. [[Mina Harker]], a chemist with vampire abilities following an encounter with [[Count Dracula]].\n* [[Tony Curran]] as [[Rodney Skinner]], a [[gentleman thief]] who got his hands on [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Griffin]]'s invisibility serum.\n* [[Stuart Townsend]] as [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]], a man who is immortal due to his aging picture and is Fantom's double agent.\n* [[Shane West]] as [[Tom Sawyer]], an agent from the United States that aids the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Edward Hyde]]\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Fantom]] / \"[[M (James Bond)|M\"]] / [[Professor Moriarty|Professor James Moriarty]], an old enemy of Sherlock Holmes. As \"Fantom\", he leads a terrorist organization. As \"M\", he claims to be working for the British Empire.\n* [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Sanderson Reed, the henchman of Professor Moriarty.\n* [[David Hemmings]] as Nigel, a friend of Allan Quatermain.\n* [[Terry O'Neill (martial artist)|Terry O'Neill]] as [[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)|Ishmael]], Captain Nemo's first mate.\n* [[Max Ryan]] as Dante, Fantom's second-in-command.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nBecause 20th Century Fox was unable to secure the rights to the eponymous character of [[H. G. Wells]]' [[The Invisible Man|1897 novel]], the script referred to \"The Invisible Man\" as \"An Invisible Man\", and his name was changed from Hawley Griffin to Rodney Skinner. The [[Fu Manchu]] character was dropped. At the request of the studio, the character of [[Tom Sawyer]] was added to increase the film's appeal to [[United States|American]] audiences and the youth demographic, a move that producer [[Don Murphy]] initially dismissed as a \"stupid studio note\" but later described as \"brilliant\".<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nAfter previously turning down the roles of the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]] in ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' trilogy and [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy, the latter of which would reportedly have earned him $450 million, Connery agreed to appear as Quatermain for $17&nbsp;million, a sum that left the filmmakers with little flexibility to attract other high-profile stars for the [[ensemble cast]].<ref>Norrington, Stephen (Director) (December 16, 2003).
