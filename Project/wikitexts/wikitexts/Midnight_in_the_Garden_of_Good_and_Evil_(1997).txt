The screenplay by [[John Lee Hancock]] was based on [[John Berendt]]'s 1994 [[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil|book of the same name]] and follows the story of an antiques dealer, [[James Arthur Williams|Jim Williams]], on trial for the murder of a male prostitute. The multiple trials depicted in Berendt's book are combined into one trial for the film.\n\nSeveral real-life locals appear in the movie, notably in the party scene at [[Mercer House (Savannah, Georgia)|Mercer House]],<ref name=sp>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1XRcS1lcCc \"Savananh Presents: 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'\"] \u2013 ''[[Savannah Morning News]]'', [[YouTube]], December 6, 2012</ref> including Williams' sister, Dorothy, and nieces Susan and Amanda, as well as Georgia senator John R. \"Jack\" Riley (his wife was played by Mary Alice Hendrix).<ref name=sp/> Filming was permitted inside Mercer House, but action scenes were filmed later on a soundstage at Warner Bros.<ref name=\"Hughes149\" />\n\nThree people \u2014 [[The Lady Chablis]], [[Emma Kelly]] and Jerry Spence \u2014 play themselves, while [[Sonny Seiler]], one of Williams' lawyers in the book, plays Judge Samuel L. White. Danny Hansford, the shooting victim in the book, is renamed Billy Hanson in the film and is portrayed by a 24-year-old [[Jude Law]], in one of his early film roles.\n\nThe film was shot entirely in [[Savannah, Georgia]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Mercer House 2017.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mercer House (Savannah, Georgia)|Mercer House]]. The alleged murder of [[Shooting of Danny Hansford|Billy Hanson]] occurred in Williams' study \u2013 the bottom left room in this photograph. The house is now known as the Mercer Williams House Museum]]\n\nThe panoramic tale of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]'s eccentricities focuses on a murder and the subsequent trial of [[James Arthur Williams|Jim Williams]], a [[self-made man]], art collector, antiques dealer, bon vivant, and semi-[[closeted]] homosexual. John Kelso, a magazine reporter with one book \u2014 ''Before the Fall'' \u2014 to his name, arrives in Savannah, amid beautiful architecture and odd doings, to write a feature for ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]]'' on one of Williams' famous Christmas parties. After being unable to find a [[taxi]], Kelso gets a ride from a [[tour bus|tour-bus]] driver to [[Jones Street (Savannah, Georgia)|Jones Street]].\n\nAfter a tour of Savannah's tourist hotspots, Kelso alights at [[Forsyth Park]]. Making his way to his lodging in [[Monterey Square]], he has a brief interaction with Billy Hanson in front of Mercer House.\n\nKelso visits the [[Armstrong Mansion]] offices of [[Sonny Seiler]], lawyer to Williams. Seiler introduces Kelso to Williams, and they take Seiler's dog, [[Uga (dog)|Uga IV]], for a walk through Forsyth Park.\n\nThe following night, at Williams' annual Mercer House Christmas party, Kelso is guest of honor. Long after the guests have all left, [[Shooting of Danny Hansford|Hanson is shot dead]] by Williams in his office after an argument between the two. Kelso stays on to cover the murder trial. Along the way, he meets some characters: the irrepressible [[The Lady Chablis]], a [[transgender]] entertainer; Luther, a man who keeps flies attached to strings on his [[lapel]]s and threatens daily to poison the water supply; [[Serena Dawes]], a former silent-film actress; the Married Women's Card Club; and Minerva, a spiritualist and [[Hoodoo (spirituality)|root doctor]], based on real-life [[Valerie Boles]].<ref name=smn>[https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2009/05/09/reclusive-voodoo-priestess-midnight-fame/13737460007/ \"Reclusive voodoo priestess of 'Midnight' fame dies\"] \u2013 ''[[Savannah Morning News]]'', May 8, 2009</ref>\n\nBetween becoming Williams' friend, cuddling-up to [[Torch song#Torch singers|torch singer]] Mandy Nichols \u2014 also a love interest of [[Joe Odom (attorney)|Joe Odom]] \u2014 meeting every eccentric in Savannah, participating in midnight graveyard rituals, and helping solve the mysteries surrounding Hanson's murder, Kelso has his hands full. The judge and jury later find Williams not guilty. Williams congratulates Kelso on proving his innocence.\n\nAs Kelso is leaving town, when saying goodbye to Williams, he asks one last question for the book: Does he want to tell him what really happened? Williams replies, \"Truth, like art, is in the eye of the beholder. You believe what you choose, and I'll believe what I know.\" He watches from the window as Kelso walks away. Minutes later, Williams is stricken by a sudden heart attack and falls face down on the carpet. His heartbeat slows. He imagines Hanson lying alongside him, as he was in death. Their eyes meet, Hanson raises his head, smiles, then resumes his position, lifeless. The heartbeat has stopped. An overhead shot shows the two dead men lying like mirror images, then Hanson fades away.\n\nAfter the funeral, Minerva tells Kelso he knows all he needs to know and warns him not to waste too much time on the dead.  \u201cI love you, boy, but I ain\u2019t the only one. You know that, don't you?\u201d Later, Kelso signs a six-month lease on an apartment. To celebrate, he, Mandy and Lady Chablis, who is walking Uga, stroll off together for a picnic. Minerva, who is feeding squirrels in the park, laughs as they pass. Cut to the cemetery and shots of the two graves.
