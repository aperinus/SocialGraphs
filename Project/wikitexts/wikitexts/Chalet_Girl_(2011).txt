The film stars [[Felicity Jones]], [[Ed Westwick]], [[Tamsin Egerton]], [[Ken Duken]], [[Sophia Bush]], [[Bill Bailey]], [[Brooke Shields]] and [[Bill Nighy]]. The film was produced by [[Pippa Cross]], Harriet Rees, Dietmar Guentsche and Wolfgang Behr, and written by Tom Williams. It was filmed on location in [[Sankt Anton am Arlberg]], Austria and in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], Germany. Critical reaction to the film was mixed, while Jones' performance was praised. The film earned $4,811,510 on an \u00a38,000,000 budget.\n\n==Plot==\nKim Mathews ([[Felicity Jones]]) is introduced by a television presenter ([[Miquita Oliver]]) as a former skateboarding champion whose mother was killed in a car accident. Kim gives up skateboarding and begins working in a fast food burger bar to pay household bills to help her father ([[Bill Bailey]]).\n\nWhen she and her father need more money to pay the bills, Kim goes looking for a job with better pay. Her friend recommends a job called a \"chalet girl\", working in the Alps for rich clients. She is initially turned down, but Kim is accepted for the job at the last minute as the current chalet girl broke her leg. Another chalet girl, Georgie ([[Tamsin Egerton]]), is sent to help Kim out. The two initially don't like each other, as Kim is anything but posh or glamorous. She can't ski or snowboard as she has never been to the Alps. Kim is instantly attracted to Jonny ([[Ed Westwick]]) the rich son of Richard ([[Bill Nighy]]) and Caroline ([[Brooke Shields]]), although Jonny is in a relationship with another woman, Chloe ([[Sophia Bush]]).\n\nSince Kim is living next to the mountains she tries to teach herself to snowboard, but finds this difficult. Mikki ([[Ken Duken]]), seeing her struggle, helps her out and teaches her to snowboard, noticing that she has a natural talent. He persuades her to try out for a snowboarding competition to win \u20ac25,000.\n\nGeorgie and Kim begin to warm to each other, and the former finds out it is Kim's birthday. She takes Kim to a club where they get drunk. She persuades Kim to take the party back to where they are staying, as the family are out. The group of Georgie, Kim, Mikki and Georgie's friend Jules ([[Georgia King]]), return to the Chalet and relax nude in the hot tub. Georgie and Mikki begin to hook up.\n\nWhen Kim gets out of the tub to shovel snow on herself, the family returns home and sees her naked. Georgie and Kim clean the house thoroughly and attempt to pay the family back for any damage that was done to the house. Meanwhile, Kim continues to work on her snowboarding skills and tries to conquer her fear of the high jumps as it brings back the memory of the car crash.\n\nKim and Jonny become closer and after a business trip to the chalet he decides to stay behind, presumably to spend more time with Kim. Jonny offser to pay her to teach him how to snowboard, which brings them closer and after a day in the snow they kiss briefly and end up having sex. An onlooker, Bernhard ([[Gregor Blo\u00e9b]]), had spotted them earlier and had alerted Jonny's mother, Caroline. The morning after their one-night stand, Caroline catches them and mentions that Jonny is engaged to Chloe. Kim packs her things, leaving the house upset and angry that Jonny lied to her.\n\nBefore she departs for home, her father persuades her to stay and try to win the competition, saying it would have been what her mother wanted. Meanwhile, Jonny breaks up with Chloe at their engagement party in London. Chloe asks if he is in love with Kim, which he confirms. After hearing the news of their break up, Kim seems to not care about Jonny anymore.\n\nMikki and Kim both begin the snowboard competition. Mikki fails to make the high jump and ends up breaking his arm, which takes him out of the running. Kim does well on all obstacles until she gets to the high jump; she stops as she remembers the car accident again. She places 21st in the competition, not placing high enough to make the top 20 finalists. However, she is the first reserve if any finalists drop out. Just then, world champion Tara ([[Tara Dakides]], as herself), pulls out and gives her spot to Kim.\n\nKim makes all obstacles and jumps, and visualizing her mother cheering her on from the crowd, she lands the high jump perfectly and wins. Jonny, having come back after breaking up with Chloe, appears behind Kim and apologizes. The two banter for a moment before they kiss. We then see Richard and Caroline watching the competition on TV, where the camera captures Jonny and Kim kissing. Caroline, seeing how happy her son is, gives in and agrees to accept Kim.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ed Westwick 2010.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ed Westwick took the role of Jonny as he liked the idea of portraying a \"nice guy\".]]\n[[Felicity Jones]] was cast in the lead role of Kim.

Williams had previously worked at [[Working Title Films]] as a script reader, and described himself as sharing their \"commercial sensibility\". Rees described ''Chalet Girl'' as the pitch that stood out, and Williams began to work on a script. The first draft of the script was delivered on Christmas Eve 2007, with a further 123 versions created before shooting would finish. Rees went on to meet [[Phil Traill]] in Los Angeles regarding a different project which he decided against but following a phone call from Williams, who Traill knew from their time at [[Newcastle University]], the director was attracted to the ''Chalet Girl'' script. First time feature producer Rees teamed up with Pippa Cross, who she described as her \"mentor\".<ref name=\"onsetinterviews\">{{cite web|title=Interviews {{!}} Cast & Crew|date=18 October 2010 |url=http://chaletgirlfilm.wordpress.com/interviews-cast-crew/|publisher=Chalet Girl on Set|accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nA few changes were made to the script during development, including removing a younger brother of the character Kim. Due to budgetary restraints, a number of scenes were dropped or the locations moved. Costume designers had to fly around to meet the actors' availability, including to New York City to meet with Ed Westwick and [[Soho]], London with Bill Nighy. Both Nighy and Shields wore some of their own items on screen to save the film's budget, including Shields' engagement ring.<ref name=\"onsetinterviews\" />\n\nReconnaissance trips were made to the resort of [[M\u00e9ribel]] and to snowboarding championships in [[Laax]].
