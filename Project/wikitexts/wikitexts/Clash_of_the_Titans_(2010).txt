The film's success led to a sequel, ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', released in March 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter defeating the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], the [[Twelve Olympians|gods]] divided the world among themselves; [[Zeus]] took the skies, [[Poseidon]] the seas, and [[Hades]], deceived by Zeus, was left to rule the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. Zeus created the mortals, whose worship maintained the gods' immortality. Over time, however (shortly after both the [[Trojan War]] & [[Odysseus|Odysseus']] 10-year journey back to [[Homer's Ithaca|Ithaca]]), some mortals began to defy their creators. The [[demigod]] [[Perseus]] was conceived by Zeus and the human queen [[Danae]] during the siege of her husband [[Acrisius|King Acrisius]] at [[Mount Olympus]]. Upon discovering the conception, an enraged Acrisius orders the queen's execution and locks the newborn child in a chest with her corpse. In Zeus' retaliation, a lightning bolt strikes the king and severely deforms him. The king then throws the chest into the sea. Thereafter, Perseus is found and raised by the fisherman Spyros and his wife Marmara.\n\n18 years later, Perseus and his family watch as soldiers from the city of [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]] destroy the statue of Zeus, declaring war on the gods. The [[Erinyes|Furies]] are then unleashed and slaughter the soldiers. Hades appears and destroys the family's fishing vessel; Spyros and his family drown; Perseus is the only survivor. Found by another group of soldiers, Perseus is brought before King [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and Queen [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]]. They are celebrating their campaign against the gods, while their daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Princess Andromeda]] disapproves of her parents leading the city's rebellion. When Cassiopeia begins boasting of her daughter to the gods, the revelry is interrupted by Hades, who exposes Perseus' lineage to Zeus and rapidly ages Cassiopeia. He then threatens to unleash the [[Kraken]] - a sea monster that was borne from his flesh - against Argos in ten days, unless Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice. Perseus meets Io, a mysterious woman cursed with immortality, who confirms his origin.\n\nPerseus, Io, and the King's Guard led by Draco journey to the [[Graeae|Stygian Witches]], seeking a way to defeat the Kraken. To help his son, Zeus tries to give Perseus a sword forged on Olympus, which he refuses. Soon after, they are attacked by a decrepit Acrisius, now known as Calibos, who was corrupted by Hades, and sent to kill Perseus. During the fight, Draco severs Calibos' hand, forcing him to retreat to a desert where his blood from the hand stump conjures giant [[scorpion]]s which attack the group.  They are rescued by a band of [[Jinn|Djinn]], desert sorcerers who tame the remaining scorpions and lend their aid to Perseus and his group. They arrive at the lair of the Stygian Witches who are forced to reveal a weapon to defeat the Kraken: the head of the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]], who resides in the Underworld. Upon arrival, Perseus and his remaining companions enter Medusa's temple lair, while Io remains outside. Medusa kills everyone except Perseus, who finally manages to behead her by using the underside of his shield to see her with his back turned. As he leaves the temple, Calibos appears and fatally stabs Io. Perseus and Calibos fight, ending the battle after Perseus picks up the Olympian sword and kills Calibos, restoring his human form at the last moment.  As Io lies dying, she urges Perseus to save Andromeda and Argos.\n\nThe winged horse [[Pegasus]] arrives and takes Perseus back to Argos as Hades, having manipulated Zeus and the gods into earning their trust, releases the Kraken. Perseus arrives and exposes Medusa's head to the Kraken, which gradually petrifies and crumbles. Prokopion, a cult leader who worships Hades, attempts to kill Perseus, but Cepheus intervenes and both of them are then crushed by the Kraken's falling claw. Hades confronts Perseus, but the latter, invoking Zeus, hurls his sword at Hades, forcing him back to the Underworld. Perseus rescues Andromeda, who asks Perseus to rule Argos by her side as King, but he declines. Perseus later refuses another offer of godhood from Zeus; instead, Zeus revives Io, reuniting her and Perseus.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Worthington]] as [[Perseus]]<br />A fisherman who finds out he is a demigod, as the son of Zeus, king of the gods, and the mortal [[Danae]]. Perseus goes on a quest for the head of Medusa in order to stop the gods from destroying [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]]. The Ancient Greeks regarded Perseus as one their greatest heroes, as well as the founder of [[Mycenae]]. The film adapts elements of the classical Greek myths around Perseus, but does so loosely. The mythological Perseus was sent to collect the head of Medusa by King [[Polydectes]] so Polydectes could force Danae into marriage during Perseus' absence. Perseus went on this quest unaided by companions, but with help from the gods [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]]. \n** [[Otto Farrant]] as young Perseus\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Zeus]]<br />King of the gods, as well as the god of the sky, lightning and thunder. Zeus created man but has become disappointed with their lack of respect.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Hades]]<br />God of the underworld and the dead, a brother of Zeus. Hades resents his brother for him (Hades) being appointed lord of the underworld, and plots to destroy his brother.\n* [[Gemma Arterton]] as [[Io (mythology)|Io]]<br />A mortal woman who once refused the advances of a god and was cursed with agelessness. She has watched over Perseus and acts as his guide. The character is loosely inspired by the mythological figure of [[Io (mythology)|Io]], whom Zeus coveted. In order to keep Io safe from the wrath of his wife, Zeus turned Io into a cow. The mythological Io and Perseus never met as they lived hundreds of years apart, with Io actually a distant ancestor of Perseus.\n* [[Alexa Davalos]] as [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]<br />A princess of [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]], who is sacrificed to the [[Kraken]] after her mother foolishly boasts about Andromeda's beauty; in classical Greek mythology, Andromeda was a princess of [[Aethiopia]] who was sacrificed to the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]].\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as King [[Acrisius]]<br />A mortal king who led a revolt against the gods. As punishment, Zeus impregnated Acrisius' wife, Queen Danae, and turned Acrisius into the deformed creature Calibos. The character is based on the mythological King Acrisius who was Danae's father and thus Perseus' maternal grandfather. The mythological Acrisius attempted to murder his daughter because an [[oracle]] had foretold that Acrisius would one day be killed by his own grandson. Acrisius' transformation into Calibos is not based on mythological sources, but is instead inspired by the character from the [[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|original film]].\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as Draco, captain of the royal guard of Argos who accompanies Perseus.\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as Solon, an experienced soldier from Argos who accompanies Perseus.\n* [[Hans Matheson]] as Ixas, a soldier from Argos who accompanies Perseus.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as Eusebios, a young and devout soldier from Argos who accompanies Perseus.\n* [[Ashraf Barhom]] as Ozal, a hunter who joins Perseus' journey, brother to Kucuk.\n* Mouloud Achour as Kucuk, Ozal's brother and a hunter who joins Perseus' journey.\n* [[Ian Whyte (actor)|Ian Whyte]] as Sheikh Suleiman, leader of the [[Djinn]] humanoid sorcerers who live in the desert and use black magic to extend their lifespan. The Djinn do not appear in Ancient Greek mythology, but are creatures from Arabic myths instead.\n* [[Luke Treadaway]] as Prokopion, a doomsday prophet who urges the Argives to worship the gods.\n\n[[Pete Postlethwaite]] and [[Elizabeth McGovern]] appear in the opening scenes of the film as Spyro and Marmara, who find the infant Perseus and become his adoptive parents. Both characters do not appear in classical Greek mythology, where Perseus was instead raised by his mother [[Danae]], who did not die during their voyage in the coffin. [[Vincent Regan]] and [[Polly Walker]] play King [[Cepheus (father of Andromeda)|Kepheus]] and Queen [[Cassiopeia (mother of Andromeda)|Cassiopeia]], the arrogant rulers of Argos and parents of Andromeda. In the original myths Cepheus and Cassiopeia were king and queen of [[Aethiopia]] instead.\n\n[[Rory McCann]] and [[Martin McCann (actor)|Martin McCann]] make appearances as Belo and Phaedrus, two soldiers from Argos who initially accompany Perseus on his journey. [[Kaya Scodelario]] plays Peshet, handmaiden to Princess Andromeda.\n\n[[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] plays [[Apollo]], god of music, the sun, dance and archery and a son of Zeus. [[Danny Huston]] and [[Alexander Siddig]] appear briefly as [[Poseidon]], god of the sea, and [[Hermes]], god of roads and travelers. [[Ross Mullan]], Robin Berry and Graham Hughes play the three Stygian Witches, who are based on the [[Graeae]] Pemphredo, Enyo and Deino. Supermodels [[Agyness Deyn]] and [[Natalia Vodianova]] make brief appearances as [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love and beauty, and the monstrous [[Medusa]], one of the fearsome [[Gorgons]], respectively. [[Izabella Miko]] has a non-speaking role as Athena, the goddess of wisdom and knowledge.\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:Teide 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Teide National Park]] ([[Tenerife]]) is the most visited national park in Europe<ref>[http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2010/diariodeavisos/content/21463/ El Teide, el parque m\u00e1s visitado de Europa y el segundo del mundo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926114624/http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2010/diariodeavisos/content/21463/ |date=September 26, 2010 }}</ref> and one of the most visited in the world, and place of filming of some scenes from the movie.]]\nThe ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' remake project started in 2002 under producer [[Adam Schroeder]] and writers [[John Glenn (screenwriter)|John Glenn]] and Travis Wright.
