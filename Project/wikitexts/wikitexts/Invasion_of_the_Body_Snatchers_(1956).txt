The [[black-and-white]] film was shot in [[Super 35|Superscope]] and in the [[film noir]] style.

Alien plant spores have fallen from space and grown into large seed pods, each one capable of producing a visually identical copy of a human. As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical traits, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it until only the replacement is left; these duplicates, however, are devoid of all human emotion. Little by little, a local doctor uncovers this \"quiet\" invasion and attempts to stop it.\n\nThe slang expression \"[[Pod People (Invasion of the Body Snatchers)|pod people]]\" that arose in late 20th-century U.S. culture refers to the emotionless duplicates seen in the film.<ref name=\"Warren\"/> ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=1994-11-15|title=25 Films Added to National Registry|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/movies/25-films-added-to-national-registry.html|access-date=2020-06-30|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nA [[psychiatrist]], Dr. Hill, is called to the emergency room of a [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] hospital, where a highly agitated man is being [[5150 (involuntary psychiatric hold)|held in custody]]. The man identifies himself as a doctor, and recounts, in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]], the events leading up to his arrest and arrival at the hospital.\n\nIn the nearby town of Santa Mira, Dr. Miles Bennell sees a number of patients apparently suffering from [[Capgras delusion]], the belief that their relatives have been replaced with identical-looking impostors. Returning from a trip, he meets his former girlfriend, Becky Driscoll, who has recently come back to town after a divorce. Becky's cousin Wilma expresses the same fear about her Uncle Ira, with whom she lives.\n\nThat evening, Miles and Becky are urgently called to the home of Bennell's friend, Jack Belicec, who has found what appears to be a dead body in his home. Inexplicably, it has no discernible facial features or fingerprints. To their horror, within a short period of time it begins to take on the exact physical features of Belicec. Later, another body is found in Becky's basement that is her exact duplicate. When Bennell calls psychiatrist Dr. Dan Kauffman to the scene, the bodies have mysteriously disappeared.\n\nThe following night, Bennell, Becky, Jack, and Jack's wife Teddy again find duplicates of themselves, emerging from giant seed pods in Bennell's greenhouse. They conclude that the townspeople are being replaced while asleep with exact physical copies. Bennell tries to make a long-distance call to federal authorities, but the phone operator claims that the lines are all busy and he cannot be put through, so Jack and Teddy drive off to seek help in the next town. Bennell and Becky soon realize that all of the town's inhabitants have been replaced and are devoid of any sort of humanity. They hide at Bennell's office for the night, vowing to stay awake so as not to be replaced by their duplicates.\n\nThe next morning, truckloads of the giant pods arrive in the town center. They listen as police chief Nick Grivett directs the others to take them to neighboring towns to be planted and used to replace their populations. Kauffman and Belicec, both of whom are now also \"pod people\", arrive at Bennell's office with new pods for Becky and Bennell. They reveal that an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial life form]] is responsible for the invasion. After their takeover, humanity will lose all emotions and sense of individuality, creating a simplistic, stress-free world.\n\nAfter scuffling with and knocking out the aliens (Kauffman, Belicec, and Grivett), Bennell and Becky escape from the office. Outside, they pretend to be emotionless pod people. After seeing a dog dart out into traffic, Becky screams and her reaction exposes their humanity. A town alarm is sounded and the couple flee on foot, pursued by the pod people.\n\nExhausted, they manage to escape and hide in an abandoned mine outside town, struggling to stay awake. Later, they hear music, and Bennell leaves Becky briefly to investigate. Over a hill, he sees a large greenhouse farm with hundreds of giant seed pods being loaded onto trucks. Bennell returns to tell Becky. Upon kissing her, Bennell realizes, to his horror, that she fell asleep before he returned and is now one of ''them''. Becky sounds the alarm as Bennell runs away. He is again chased, and eventually finds himself on a crowded highway. After seeing a transport truck bound for San Francisco and Los Angeles filled with the pods, he frantically screams at the passing motorists, \"They're here already! You're next! You're next!\"\n\nBack at the hospital, Bennell finishes his story. Dr. Hill and the on-duty doctor step outside the room, the latter expressing his certainty that Bennell is psychotic. Just then, a truck driver is wheeled into the hall on a gurney after having been badly injured in an accident. It turns out that the man had to be dug out from under a load of giant pods coming from Santa Mira. Finally believing Bennell's story, Dr. Hill alerts the police to block the roads in and out of Santa Mira; the film ends with Bennell relieved as Hill calls the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:InvasionOfTheBodySnatchers1956Crop.jpg|right|thumb|300px| In this colorized still from the film; the principal cast (''clockwise from top center''), [[Carolyn Jones]] as Teddy, [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Dr. Miles Bennell, [[King Donovan]] as Jack Belicec, and [[Dana Wynter]] as Becky Driscoll, discover the pods growing.]]\n;Starring\n* [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] as Dr. Miles Bennell\n* [[Dana Wynter]] as Becky Driscoll\n* [[King Donovan]] as Jack Belicec\n* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Theodora \"Teddy\" Belicec\n\n;Featuring\n* [[Larry Gates]] as Dr. Dan Kauffman\n* [[Virginia Christine]] as Wilma Lentz\n* [[Ralph Dumke]] as Police Chief Nick Grivett\n* Kenneth Patterson as Stanley Driscoll\n* Guy Way as Officer Sam Janzek\n* [[Jean Willes]] as Nurse Sally Withers\n* Eileen Stevens as Anne Grimaldi\n* [[Beatrice Maude]] as Grandma Grimaldi\n* [[Whit Bissell]] (uncredited) as Dr. Hill\n* [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] (uncredited) as Dr. Bassett\n\n;With\n* [[Bobby Clark (juvenile actor)|Bobby Clark]] as Jimmy Grimaldi\n* [[Tom Fadden]] as Uncle Ira Lentz\n* [[Everett Glass]] as Dr. Ed Pursey\n* [[Dabbs Greer]] as Mac Lomax\n* [[Pat O'Malley (actor born 1890)|Pat O'Malley]] as Baggage Man\n* [[Sam Peckinpah]] as Charlie, the Gas Meter Reader\n\n==Production==\n===Novel and screenplay===\nJack Finney's novel ends with the extraterrestrials, who have a life span of no more than five years, leaving Earth after they realize that humans are offering strong resistance, despite having little reasonable chance against the alien invasion.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n===Budgeting and casting===\n''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' was originally scheduled for a 24-day shoot and a budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]454,864. The studio later asked Wanger to cut the budget significantly. The producer proposed a shooting schedule of 20 days and a budget of $350,000.<ref name=\"LaValley\"/>\n\nInitially, Wanger considered [[Gig Young]], [[Dick Powell]], [[Joseph Cotten]], and several others for the role of Miles. For Becky, he considered casting [[Anne Bancroft]], [[Donna Reed]], [[Kim Hunter]], [[Vera Miles]], and others. With the lower budget, however, he abandoned these choices and cast [[Richard Kiley]], who had just starred in ''[[The Phenix City Story]]'' for Allied Artists.<ref name=\"LaValley\"/> Kiley turned the role down and Wanger cast [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], an Academy Award nominee five years earlier for ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', and relative newcomer [[Dana Wynter]], who had done several major dramatic roles on television.<ref name=\"LaValley2\">LaValley 1989, pp. 25-26.</ref>\n\nFuture director [[Sam Peckinpah]] had a small part as Charlie, a meter reader. Peckinpah was a dialogue coach on five Siegel films in the mid-1950s, including this one.<ref>Weddle 1994, pp. 116\u2013119.</ref>\n\n===Principal photography===\nOriginally, producer Wanger and Siegel wanted to film ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' on location in [[Mill Valley, California]], the town just north of [[San Francisco]], that Jack Finney described in his novel.<ref name= \"LaValley\">LaValley 1989, p. 25.</ref> In the first week of January 1955, Siegel, Wanger, and screenwriter [[Daniel Mainwaring]] visited Finney to talk about the film version and to look at Mill Valley. The location proved too expensive, and Siegel with Allied Artist executives, found locations resembling Mill Valley in the [[Los Angeles]] area, including [[Sierra Madre, California|Sierra Madre]], [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth]], [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]], [[Bronson Canyon|Bronson]], and [[Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles|Beachwood Canyon]]s, all of which went on to make up the fictional town of \"Santa Mira\" for the film.<ref name=\"LaValley\"/> In addition to these outdoor locations, much of the film was shot in the Allied Artists studio on the east side of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]].<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' was shot by cinematographer Ellsworth Fredericks in 23 days between March 23 and April 27, 1955. The cast and crew worked a six-day week with Sundays off.<ref name=\"LaValley\"/> The production went over schedule by three days because of the [[night-for-night]] shooting that Siegel wanted. Additional photography took place in September 1955, filming a frame story on which the studio had insisted (see [[#ending|Original intended ending]]). The final budget was $382,190.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nThe project was originally named ''The Body Snatchers'' after the Finney serial.<ref name=\"LaValley3\"/> However, Wanger wanted to avoid confusion with the 1945 [[Val Lewton]] film ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]''. The producer was unable to come up with a title and accepted the studio's choice, ''They Come from Another World'' and that was assigned in summer 1955. Siegel objected to this title and suggested two alternatives, ''Better Off Dead'' and ''Sleep No More'', while Wanger offered ''Evil in the Night'' and ''World in Danger''. None of these were chosen, and the studio settled on ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' in late 1955.<ref name=\"LaValley3\"/> The film was released at the time in France under the mistranslated title \"''L'invasion des profanateurs de s\u00e9pultures''\" (literally: ''Invasion of the defilers of tombs''), which remains unchanged today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Badmington|first=Neil|date=November 2010|title=Pod almighty!; or, humanism, posthumanism, and the strange case of Invasion of the Body Snatchers|journal=Textual Practice|volume=15|issue=1|pages=5\u201322|doi=10.1080/09502360010013848|s2cid=170827979}}</ref>\n\nWanger wanted to add a variety of speeches and prefaces.<ref name=\"LaValley4\"/> He suggested a voice-over introduction for Miles.<ref name=\"LaValley5\">LaValley 1989, p. 126.</ref> While the film was being shot, Wanger tried to get permission in England to use a [[Winston Churchill]] quotation as a preface to the film. The producer sought out [[Orson Welles]] to voice the preface and a trailer for the film. He wrote speeches for Welles' opening on June 15, 1955, and worked to persuade Welles to do it, but was unsuccessful. Wanger considered science fiction author [[Ray Bradbury]] instead, but this did not happen, either.<ref name=\"LaValley5\"/> Mainwaring eventually wrote the voice-over narration himself.<ref name=\"LaValley3\"/>\n\nThe studio scheduled three film previews on the last days of June and the first day of July 1955.<ref name=\"LaValley5\"/> According to Wanger's memos at the time, the previews were successful. Later reports by Mainwaring and Siegel, however, contradict this, claiming that audiences could not follow the film and laughed in the wrong places. In response the studio removed much of the film's humor, \"humanity\" and \"quality,\" according to Wanger.<ref name=\"LaValley5\"/> He scheduled another preview in mid-August that also did not go well. In later interviews Siegel pointed out that it was studio policy not to mix humor with horror.<ref name=\"LaValley5\"/>\n\nWanger saw the final cut in December 1955 and protested the use of the [[Widescreen|Superscope]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].<ref name=\"LaValley3\"/> Its use had been included in early plans for the film, but the first print was not made until December. Wanger felt that the film lost sharpness and detail. Siegel originally shot ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' in the 1.85:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. Superscope was a post-production laboratory process designed to create an [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] print from non-anamorphic source material that would be projected at an aspect ratio of 2.00:1.<ref name=\"LaValley3\"/><ref>Hart, Martin.

Retrieved: January 13, 2015.</ref>\n\n===Original intended ending {{Anchor|ending}}===\nBoth Siegel and Mainwaring were satisfied with the film as shot. The original ending did not include the flashback framing, and ended with Miles screaming as truckloads of pods pass him on the road.<ref name=\"LaValley4\">LaValley 1989, p. 125.</ref> The studio, wary of a pessimistic conclusion, insisted on adding a [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]] suggesting a more optimistic outcome to the story, leading to the flashback framing. In this version, the film begins with Bennell in custody in a hospital emergency ward, telling a consulting psychiatrist ([[Whit Bissell]]) his story. In the closing scenes, pods are discovered at a highway accident, confirming Bennell's warning, and the authorities are alerted, likely stopping the pod distribution and resolving the extraterrestrial threat.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nMainwaring scripted this framing story and Siegel shot it on September 16, 1955, at the Allied Artists studio.<ref name=\"LaValley3\"/> In a later interview Siegel complained, \"The film was nearly ruined by those in charge at Allied Artists who added a preface and ending that I don't like\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Don Siegel: American Cinema|url=https://archive.org/details/donsiegelamerica0000love|url-access=registration|first=Alan|last=Lovell|publisher=British Film Institute|year=1975|isbn=978-0-85170-047-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/donsiegelamerica0000love/page/54 54]}}</ref> In his autobiography Siegel added that \"Wanger was very much against this, as was I.

Heinlein]] had previously developed this subject in his 1951 novel ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'', written in 1950. ''The Puppet Masters'' was later plagiarized as the 1958 film ''[[The Brain Eaters]]'', and adapted under contract in the 1994 film ''[[The Puppet Masters (film)|The Puppet Masters]]''.\n\nThere are several thematically related works that followed Finney's 1955 novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'', including [[Val Guest]]'s ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' and [[Gene Fowler, Jr.|Gene Fowler's]] ''[[I Married a Monster from Outer Space]]''.\n\nA [[Looney Tunes]] parody of the film was released, entitled ''[[Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers]]'' (1992). The adaptation was directed by [[Greg Ford]] and places [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Yosemite Sam]], and [[Porky Pig]] in the various roles of the story.\n\nIn 2018 theater company [[Team Starkid]] created the musical parody ''[[The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals]]'', the story of a Midwestern town that is overtaken by a singing alien hivemind. The musical parodies numerous horror and musical tropes, while the main character also wears within the show a suit reminiscent of Bennell's wardrobe.\n\nThe May 1981 issue of ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' featured a parody titled \"Invasion of the Money Snatchers\"; the [[gentile]] population of Whiteville is taken over by [[pastrami]] sandwiches from outer space and turned into [[Jews]].<ref name=NatLamp>[https://www.comics.org/issue/977128/ ''National Lampoon'' (May 1981)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013172453/https://www.comics.org/issue/977128/ |date=2017-10-13 }} at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nThe film was also parodied in the 2012 ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode \"Planet of the Jellyfish\" (referencing ''[[Planet of the Vampires]]'' and ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'') featuring [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters|characters from Bikini Bottom]] being replaced by alien clones in their sleep.<ref>{{Citation|title=Are You Happy Now?/Planet of the Jellyfish|date=2012-03-31|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2337387/|type=Animation, Comedy, Family, Fantasy|others=Tom Kenny, Rodger Bumpass, Dee Bradley Baker, Bill Fagerbakke|publisher=United Plankton Pictures|access-date=2021-02-08}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n*Grant, Barry Keith. 2010.
