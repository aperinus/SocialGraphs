Based on the 2002 novel ''Asking for Trouble'' by [[Elizabeth Young (author)|Elizabeth Young]], the film is about a single woman who hires a male escort to pose as her boyfriend at her sister's wedding in order to dupe her ex-fianc\u00e9, who dumped her a few years prior. Despite the film receiving negative reviews from critics, it was commercially successful, achieving $47 million worldwide at the box office against a budget of $15 million.\n\n==Plot==\nKat Ellis is a single New Yorker who returns to her parents' house in London to be the [[maid of honor]] at her younger half-sister Amy's wedding. The [[best man]] is her former [[fianc\u00e9]], who unexpectedly dumped her two years ago.  Anxious about confronting and eager to impress him, she hires suave escort Nick Mercer to pose as her boyfriend.\n\nKat intends to make her former flame, Jeffrey, jealous, but her plan backfires when Nick convinces everyone, including her, that they are madly in love. Kat then feels herself, too, falling for Nick as he slowly falls for her.\n\nThe night before the wedding, Kat discovers Amy slept with Jeffrey when they were still together, and he dumped Kat because he believed he was in love with Amy. Nick had discovered this a day earlier, and when Kat finds that out, she feels betrayed from all sides, and puts Nick off. He decides to return to America, and leaves Kat the money she had paid him.\n\nOn the wedding day, seeing Kat distressed, her step-father asks her if Nick 'is the guy for you'. Kat realizes he is, so she sets off to find him. Meanwhile, just before the wedding ceremony, Amy confesses her betrayal to her fianc\u00e9, Ed, but professes her love for him. Upset, Ed chases Jeffrey out of the church and down the road. Jeffrey says he gave up on Amy and believes he's done nothing wrong. To which Ed, calls him a \"back-stabbing weasel\", though Jeffrey believes he's still not in the wrong as he slept with Amy before they dated. Ed shouts out that he was engaged to Kat, proving he was still in the wrong for what he did to Kat.\n\nNick picks up Ed in a car as Jeffrey disappears into the woods. They talk about love, and Ed decides he loves Amy more than he is angry. To make it clearer he should go back, Nick tells Ed if he went back the couple would end up having great [[makeup sex]]. They return to the church, with Nick as 'new' best man. Just before the ceremony, Nick tells Kat he realized he'd \"... rather fight with you than make love with anyone else\", and they kiss passionately.\n\nKat and Nick begin a real relationship. Amy and Kat now reconcile, Kat lets go of her anger and forgives Amy as she confessed the truth to Ed. TJ, Kat's cousin also apparently enjoys a moment with Woody after the wedding. Jeffrey learns absolutely nothing, at the end he is seen trying to get the attention of a female neighbor.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Debra Messing]] as Kat Ellis\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Nick Mercer\n* [[Amy Adams]] as Amy Ellis\n* [[Jeremy Sheffield]] as Jeffrey\n* [[Jack Davenport]] as Edward Fletcher-Wooten\n* [[Sarah Parish]] as TJ, Kat's cousin\n* [[Peter Egan]] as Victor Ellis, Kat's step-father\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Bunny Ellis, Kat's mother\n* [[Jolyon James]] as Woody\n* [[George Asprey]] as Pat \n* C.
