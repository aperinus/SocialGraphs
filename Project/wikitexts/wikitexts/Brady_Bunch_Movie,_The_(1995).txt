The film was directed by [[Betty Thomas]], with a screenplay by Laurice Elehwany, [[Rick Copp]], and [[Bonnie and Terry Turner]], and stars [[Shelley Long]], [[Gary Cole]], and [[Michael McKean]]. It also features cameos from [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]], [[Micky Dolenz]], [[Peter Tork]], and [[RuPaul]], along with some of the original cast of ''The Brady Bunch'' in small roles. The film places the original sitcom characters, with their 1970s [[fashion]] sense and [[sitcom]] family morality, in a contemporary 1990s setting, drawing humor from the resulting [[Cultural conflict|culture clash]].\n\n''The Brady Bunch Movie'' was released in the United States on February 17, 1995, and grossed $54 million. A sequel titled ''[[A Very Brady Sequel]]'' was released on August 23, 1996, and a [[television film]] titled ''[[The Brady Bunch in the White House]]'' was aired on November 29, 2002.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nLarry Dittmeyer, an unscrupulous real estate developer, explains to his supervisor that almost all the families in his neighborhood &mdash; except for the Brady family &mdash; have agreed to sell their property as part of a plan to turn the area into a shopping mall.\n\nAt the Bradys' house, Mike and Carol are having breakfast prepared by their housekeeper, Alice, while the six children prepare for school. Jan is jealous of her elder, popular sister Marcia. Cindy is tattling about everything she's hearing. Greg is dreaming of becoming a singer (but sings folk songs more appropriate to the seventies). Peter is beginning puberty with his voice starting to break and the numerous titillations he is exposed to, notably sex education and his very attractive teacher Miss Linley. He is also trying to win the affection of the girl he loves, Holly, but his shy and awkward personality prevents him from doing so, or so he thinks. Bobby is excited about his new role as hall monitor at school.\n\nCindy gives Mike and Carol a tax delinquency notice (which was earlier mistakenly delivered to the Dittmeyers) stating that they face foreclosure on their house if they do not pay $20,000 in back taxes. The two initially ignore the crisis, but when Mike's architectural design (which is exactly the same as their house) is turned down by two potential clients, he tells Carol that they may have to sell the house.\n\nCindy overhears this and tells her siblings and they look for work to raise money to save the house, but their earnings are nowhere near enough to reach the required sum. Mike manages to sell a [[Japan]]ese company on one of his dated designs, thereby securing the money, only for Larry to sabotage it by claiming that Mike's last building collapsed.\n\nOn the night before the Bradys have to move out, Marcia suggests that they enter a \"Search for the Stars\" contest, the prize of which is exactly $20,000. Jan, having originally suggested this and been rejected, runs away from home. Cindy sees her leave and tattles, and the whole family goes on a search for her. They use their car's [[citizens' band radio]], and their transmission is heard by Schultzy ([[Ann B. Davis]]), a long-haul trucker who picks up Jan and convinces her to return home.\n\nThe next day, the children join the \"Search for the Stars\" contest. Peter finally builds the confidence to stand up to Eric Dittmeyer, Peter's tormentor and Holly's boyfriend. This earns him a kiss from Holly, which gives him a deep masculine voice. The children's dated performance receives a poor audience response compared to the more modern performances of other bands. However, the judges \u2014 [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]], [[Micky Dolenz]], and [[Peter Tork]] of [[The Monkees]] \u2014 vote for them, and they win the contest as a result. The tax bill is paid, and their neighbors withdraw their homes from the market, foiling Larry's plan and securing the neighborhood.\n\nLater, Carol's mother arrives and finally convinces Jan to stop being jealous of Marcia, only for Cindy to start feeling jealous of Jan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Cole]] as [[Mike Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Mike Brady]]\n* [[Shelley Long]] as [[Carol Brady]]\n* [[Henriette Mantel]] as [[Alice Nelson]]\n* [[Christopher Daniel Barnes]] as [[Greg Brady (Brady Bunch)|Greg Brady]]\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as [[Marcia Brady]]\n* Paul Sutera as [[Peter Brady (The Brady Bunch)|Peter Brady]]\n* [[Jennifer Elise Cox]] as [[Jan Brady]]\n* [[Jesse Lee Soffer]] as [[Bobby Brady]]\n* [[Olivia Hack]] as [[Cindy Brady]]\n* [[David Graf]] as Sam Franklin\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Larry Dittmeyer\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Dina Dittmeyer\n* [[Jack Noseworthy]] as Eric Dittmeyer\n* Moriah Snyder as Missy Dittmeyer\n* [[James Avery]] as Steve Yeager \n* [[R.
