Pictures]], based on [[J. K. Rowling|J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|1999 novel of the same name]]. The film was written by [[Steve Kloves]], and produced by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] and [[David Heyman]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' (2002) and the third instalment<!--British English spells this word with one \"l\", not two --> in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]]. It stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], alongside [[Rupert Grint]] and [[Emma Watson]] as Harry's best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] respectively. The film follows Harry's third year at [[Hogwarts]] and his quest to uncover the truth about his past, including the connection recently-escaped [[Places in Harry Potter|Azkaban]] prisoner [[Sirius Black]] has to Harry and his late parents.\n\nWith ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', production of the ''Harry Potter'' films switched to an eighteen-month cycle. Cuar\u00f3n was selected as director from a list that included [[Callie Khouri]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]]. The cast of previous instalments returned for the film, with the additions of [[Gary Oldman]], [[David Thewlis]], and [[Emma Thompson]], among others. It was the first appearance of [[Michael Gambon]] as Professor [[Albus Dumbledore]], due to [[Richard Harris]]'s death in 2002. Principal photography began in February 2003 at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]]. It was the first in the series to extensively use real-life locations, with sets built in Scotland and scenes shot in London. Filming concluded in November 2003.\n\nThe film was released on 31 May 2004 in the United Kingdom, and on 4 June 2004 in North America. It was the first ''Harry Potter'' film using IMAX Technology and released into [[IMAX]] theatres. ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' grossed a total of $797.5 million worldwide, making it the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2004]]. The film received praise for Cuar\u00f3n's direction and the lead actors' performances. It is credited for marking a notable change in the franchise's tone and directorial style, and is often considered by critics and fans alike to be the best ''Harry Potter'' film. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Music Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], at the [[77th Academy Awards]] in 2004. It was followed by ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' in 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. This article also uses British English, so be sure to see WP:ENGVAR before inverting certain grammar, like \"realise\" for example. --> \nAfter his [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|second year]] at [[Hogwarts]], [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] spends another dissatisfying summer with the Dursleys. On his thirteenth birthday, Vernon's visiting sister [[Marge Dursley|Marge]] viciously insults Harry and his parents, and an angry Harry causes her to inflate and float away. Expecting to be expelled for using magic outside school, Harry flees with his belongings.\n\nThe [[Knight Bus]] takes Harry to the [[Places in Harry Potter#The Leaky Cauldron|Leaky Cauldron]], where Minister for Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] assures Harry that he will not be punished. Reuniting with his best friends [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], Harry learns that [[Sirius Black]], a convicted supporter of [[Lord Voldemort]], has escaped [[Azkaban Prison]] and intends to kill him. During the journey to Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express is boarded by [[Dementors]], ghostly prison guards searching for Black. One enters Harry's compartment, causing him to faint, but new [[Defense Against the Dark Arts]] teacher [[Remus Lupin]] repels it with a [[Patronus Charm]]. At Hogwarts, Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] announces that Dementors will patrol the school until Black is captured.\n\n[[Rubeus Hagrid]] is appointed [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher, but his first class goes awry when [[Draco Malfoy]] provokes a [[Hippogriff]] named [[Buckbeak]] into attacking him, and his father, [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]], has Buckbeak sentenced to death. Returning to Gryffindor Tower, the students find the Fat Lady's portrait has been attacked, and the terrified Fat Lady warns Dumbledore that Black entered the castle. During a stormy Quidditch match, Dementors cause Harry to fall off his broomstick, which is destroyed by the Whomping Willow. He is caught trying to visit [[Hogsmeade]] by [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]], who give him [[The Marauder's Map]].\n\nUsing the map, Harry sneaks into Hogsmeade and learns that Black is his godfather, but divulged the Potters' whereabouts to Voldemort and murdered their mutual friend [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]]. Determined to ward off the Dementors, Harry convinces Lupin to teach him the Patronus Charm. After [[Divination]] class, he witnesses [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] enter a trance and prophesise that the Dark Lord will return. Watching Buckbeak's execution, Ron's pet rat Scabbers bites him and escapes, but a large black dog drags them both into a hole at the base of the Whomping Willow. This leads the trio through an underground passage into the [[Shrieking Shack]], where the dog is revealed to be Black, an Animagus who can transform into an animal.\n\nLupin appears, embracing Black as an old friend before revealing himself to be a [[werewolf]]. Snape arrives to apprehend Black, but is knocked out by Harry\u2019s Disarming spell. Lupin and Black reveal that Scabbers is actually the Animagus form of Pettigrew, who faked his death and framed Black for his own crimes. Turning Pettigrew back into human form, the group heads back to the castle, but the full moon causes Lupin to transform and Pettigrew escapes. As Black fights off Lupin in their animal forms, Dementors attack Black and Harry, but an unseen figure casts a powerful Patronus. Harry falls unconscious, awakening in the infirmary with Dumbledore and Hermione.\n\nLearning that Black has been captured and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss, Harry and Hermione act on Dumbledore's advice and use Hermione\u2019s [[Time-Turner]], which she was given to attend several classes at once, to go three hours back in time. They see themselves reliving the night's events, and set Buckbeak free from execution. Spotting the past Harry and Black being attacked by Dementors, Harry rescues them using a Patronus charm and realizes he was the unseen figure who saved them earlier. He and Hermione free Black, who flies away on Buckbeak, still a fugitive without proof of his innocence. Harry and Hermione return to the infirmary, rejoining their own timeline.\n\nExposed as a werewolf, Lupin resigns from teaching and returns the Marauder's Map to Harry. Black sends Harry a [[Firebolt (Harry Potter)|Firebolt]] broomstick, which he happily takes on a ride.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]: A 13-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] famous for surviving his parents' murder at the hands of the evil dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]] as an infant, who now enters his third year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name=\"ThompsonEW\" />\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]]: Harry's best friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family.<ref name=\"ThompsonEW\" />\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]]: Harry's other best friend and the trio's brains.<ref name=\"ThompsonEW\" />\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]]: The [[gamekeeper]] and new [[Care of Magical Creatures]] teacher at Hogwarts.<ref name=\"ColtraneIGN\" />\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]]:<br />The [[head master|headmaster]] of Hogwarts and one of the greatest wizards of all time.<ref name=\"GambonCBS\" /> Gambon assumed the role after [[Richard Harris]], who played Dumbledore in the previous two films, died of [[Hodgkin's disease]] on 25 October 2002, three weeks before the second film's release.<ref name=\"HarrisBBC\" /> Despite his illness, Harris was determined to film his part, telling a visiting David Heyman not to recast the role.<ref name=\"HeymanEW\" /> Four months after Harris's death, Cuar\u00f3n chose Gambon as his replacement.<ref name=\"GambonCBS\" /> Gambon was unconcerned with bettering or copying Harris, giving his own interpretation instead, but putting on a slight Irish accent for the role as an homage to him.<ref name=\"CastInterviews\" /><ref name=\"TodayAP\" /> He completed his scenes in three weeks.<ref name=\"GambonScotsman\" /> The producers originally offered the role to [[Christopher Lee]] and [[Ian McKellen]], but scheduling conflicts forced Lee to decline whilst McKellen turned it down as he had played a similar character [[Gandalf]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]].

K. Rowling]], who loved his film ''[[Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) and was impressed with his adaptation of ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"RowlingUSAToday\" /> Heyman found that \"tonally and stylistically, [Cuar\u00f3n] was the perfect fit.\"<ref name=\"HeymanEW\" /> As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuar\u00f3n assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Cuar\u00f3n recalls, \"Emma's essay was 10 pages long. Daniel's was exactly two. Rupert didn't deliver the essay.

He explained, \"What I really wanted to do was to make Hogwarts more contemporary and a little more naturalistic.\" He studied English schools and noted, \"Each teenager's individuality was reflected in the way they wore their uniform. So I asked all the kids in the film to wear their uniforms as they would if their parents weren't around.\"<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Columbus considered the costumes changes as \"a reflection of the character development within the books themselves\" and their transition to teenagers.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Whereas in the first two films the characters are constantly in their uniforms, in ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' the characters often wear modern street clothes.<ref name=\"TodayAP\" /> Rowling, who was consulted for this change, stated, \"for me the cloaks and everything makes sense for the academic time but in personal time they would be wearing their own clothes.\"<ref name=\"TodayAP\" /> [[Jany Temime]] joined the film as [[costume designer]], eventually working on all of the following instalments in the series.<ref name=\"Temime\" />\n\nFor [[Remus Lupin]], Temime opted for \"tweeds typical of England.\" Cuar\u00f3n stated that the character should look like \"an uncle who parties hard on the weekends\", so Temime preserved his gown \"unkempt and more shabby than the other teachers\u2019 robes.\"<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> For Trelawney, Thompson made sketches of the costumes and sent them to Temime and Cuar\u00f3n. Thompson saw the character as \"a person who hasn't looked in the mirror for a long time\". In order to highlight the character's short-sightedness, Temime used material filled with mirrors and eyes, as well as oversized glasses with magnifying lenses.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Cuar\u00f3n wanted Dumbledore to look like \"an old hippie, but still very chic and with a lot of class\". Temime used [[tie-dye]]d silk that would float behind him while walking, which she considered \"a much lighter look\" that gave the character more energy, in contrast with the \"heavy and majestic\" costumes designed for Harris' portrayal of Dumbledore.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\n[[File:Hogwarts model studio tour.jpg|thumb|Hogwarts model at the [[Warner Bros. Studio Tour London \u2013 The Making of Harry Potter|Making of Harry Potter]] tour in London.]]\nCuar\u00f3n's main concern was for Hogwarts to have a larger scope and be grounded in the real world.<ref name=\"SetVisitTLCp2\" /> The scale model of the Hogwarts exterior designed for the first film was expanded by around 40% for ''Prisoner of Azkaban''. Production designer [[Stuart Craig]] and art director Gary Tomkins added constructions including a clock tower and a courtyard,<ref name=\"Cinesite\" /> and the hospital wing was redesigned and rebuilt.<ref name=\"SetVisitTLCp2\" /> Other sets constructed for the film included the [[Hogsmeade]] village and [[The Three Broomsticks]] public house.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nThe use of real-life locations significantly changed the look of Hagrid's hut. For ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', the landscape around the set changed from being completely flat to the side of a hill.<ref name=\"YoungBuildingFiction\" /> The hut doubled in size, with a separate bedroom built on the back and the addition of a large pumpkin patch and a chimney.<ref name=\"YoungBuildingFiction\" /><ref name=\"ScotlandBuzzFeed\" /> Craig cited the [[Shrieking Shack]] as a particularly challenging set to create. It was built on a large hydraulic platform with the help of the special effects department, \"creaking and moving as if being continually buffeted by the wind\" in order to appear almost alive.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nSome sets were either reused from earlier films or used for more than one space. The [[Defence against the dark arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and [[Divination (Harry Potter)|Divination]] classrooms were filmed in the same set.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> The [[Honeydukes]] set was a [[Set redress|redress]] of the set of [[Flourish & Blotts]] that was seen in ''Chamber of Secrets'', which, in turn, had been redressed from the [[Ollivanders]] set from the first film.<ref name=\"SetVisitTLCp1\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Loch Shiel - Glenfinnan bay (Scotland).jpg|thumb|left|[[Loch Shiel]], where scenes from ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' were filmed.]]\nPrincipal photography began on 24 February 2003,<ref name=\"WBPressRelease\" /> at [[Warner Bros.

Three sets for the film were built in [[Glen Coe]], Scotland, near the [[Clachaig Inn]].<ref name=\"GlencoeScotland\" /> Harry's ride on [[Buckbeak]] over Hogwarts' Lake was filmed at the [[Virginia Water Lake]] in Surrey.<ref name=\"HogwartsLakeWeek\" /> The Black Lake was also filmed from [[Loch Shiel]], [[Loch Eilt]] and [[Loch Morar]] in the Scottish Highlands.<ref name=\"HogwartsLakeScotsman\" /> Incidentally, the [[Glenfinnan Viaduct]] railway, which was also featured in ''Chamber of Secrets'', is opposite Loch Shiel and was used to film the sequences when the Dementor boarded the train.<ref name=\"ScotlandBuzzFeed\" /> A small section of the [[Knight Bus]] scene, where it weaves in between traffic, was filmed in North London's [[Palmers Green]].<ref name=\"KnightBusEnfield\" /> Some parts were also filmed in and around [[Borough Market]] and [[Lambeth Bridge]] in London.<ref name=\"KnightBusStandard\" />\n\nDirector of photography [[Michael Seresin]] considered the story much darker compared to its two predecessors, so he employed \"moody [lighting], with more shadows\". He used a variety of [[wide-angle lens]]es to amplify Hogwarts prominence in the story, and only used close-ups sparingly. \"We prefer to observe the kids from further away, as I find body language to be very interesting\", Cuar\u00f3n explained.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nRowling allowed Cuar\u00f3n to make minor changes to the book, on the condition that he stuck to the book's spirit.<ref name=\"CuaronNewsround\" /> She allowed him to place a [[sundial]] on Hogwarts' grounds, but rejected a graveyard, as that would play an important part in the then-unreleased [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|sixth book]].<ref name=\"CuaronNewsround\" /> Rowling said she \"got goosebumps\" when she saw several moments in the film, as they inadvertently referred to events in the final two books, she stated, \"people are going to look back on the film and think that those were put in deliberately as clues.\"<ref name=\"RowlingUSAToday\" /> When filming concluded, Cuar\u00f3n found that it had \"been the two sweetest years of my life,\" and expressed his interest in directing one of the sequels.<ref name=\"CuaronNewsround\" />\n\nThe Knight Bus sequence was shot over several weeks at various locations in London. In order to give the impression of the vehicle moving at {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0}}, stunt coordinator [[Greg Powell]] explained, \"We drove the bus at about {{convert|30|mph|km/h|0|disp=sqbr}} and the other cars were going only about {{convert|8|mph|km/h|0|abbr=values|disp=sqbr}}. It took weeks of planning with stunt drivers, and even the people you see on the street are stunt men and women, who were trained to walk incredibly slow just to make the bus look faster.\"<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\n===Special and visual effects===\n[[File:Dementor (8514403186).jpg|left|thumb|150px|A dementor at the [[Warner Bros.

The water test footage provided creative direction for the visual effects team, adding the intangible metaphysical quality Cuar\u00f3n was seeking.

Cuar\u00f3n said, \"Once we worked out the physiology, the way his bones would actually move, we had to capture his personality, which is a mixture of regal elegance, particularly when he is flying, and the clumsy and greedy creature he becomes back on land.\" Creature effects supervisor [[Nick Dudman]] created several practical hippogriffs for the production, while Burke and Guyett oversaw the creation of the computer-generated version. Guyett cited the complex movement of the feathers as an achievement that had \"never been done before.\"<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nThe inflation of Aunt Marge was achieved practically. Ferris said, \"I wore various prosthetic bodies, which inflated at different rates, and at my largest I was about four and a half feet wide.\" The {{convert|50|lb|kg|0}} costume prevented Ferris from walking and eating. Thirty-eight tweed suits of increasing size were used for the sequence.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nCinesite was in charge of the time travel shot featured in the film, which was over a minute long. The main action was filmed on a [[steadicam]] against [[chroma key|bluescreen]], and four minutes of background footage was shot separately. The background was then sped up and composited behind the main action. Two other plates of background footage were tiled together as the camera turned.<ref name=\"Cinesite\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (soundtrack)}}\n\nWhen it was announced that Cuar\u00f3n would direct ''Prisoner of Azkaban'', there was initial speculation that his collaborative composer [[Patrick Doyle]] (who would score the following film) would do the music. Cuar\u00f3n, however, retained [[John Williams]], for whom it would be the third and final movie he scored in the series. The soundtrack was a significant departure from the previous two, as Cuar\u00f3n wanted the score to take a different approach.<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" /> One of the new themes, \"Double Trouble\", was written during production for a children's choir to perform in Hogwarts's Great Hall in one of the film's earlier scenes.<ref name=\"SoundtrackTLC\" /> The lyrics of the song were taken from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]''.<ref name=\"SoundtrackTLC\" />  The soundtrack album was released by [[Atlantic Records]] on 25 May 2004.<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" />\n\n==Differences from the book==\n<!-- This section should be integrated into the rest of the article -->\n''Prisoner of Azkaban'' was, at the time of publication, the series' longest book. The increasing plot complexity necessitated a looser adaptation of the book's finer plot lines and back-story. The connection between Harry's parents and the Marauder's Map is only briefly mentioned,<ref name=\"DiffsDigitalSpy\" /> as is [[Remus Lupin]]'s association to the map.<ref name=\"DiffsSR\" /> Additionally, it was never mentioned who the Marauders were or who the nicknames Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs referred to. Some [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] was removed for dramatic effect: both the Shrieking Shack and Scabbers the rat are mentioned only very briefly in the film, while they receive a more thorough coverage in the novel.<ref name=\"DiffsDigitalSpy\" /> Most of [[Sirius Black]]'s back story is also cut, with no mention of how he escaped from [[Azkaban]].<ref name=\"DiffsSR\" />\n\nOn account of pace and time considerations, the film glosses over detailed descriptions of magical education. Only one Hippogriff, Buckbeak, is seen, and only Malfoy and Harry are seen interacting with the Hippogriff during [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lessons,<ref name=\"DiffsBustle\" /> and most other lessons, including all of [[Severus Snape|Snape]]'s [[Potions Class|Potions]] classes, were cut from the film.<ref name=\"DiffsDigitalSpy\" /> The Fidelius Charm's complicated description is removed entirely from the film, with no explanation given of exactly how Sirius is supposed to have betrayed the Potters to [[Lord Voldemort]].<ref name=\"DiffsSR2\" /> Many of this scene's lines are redistributed amongst [[Cornelius Fudge]] and [[Minerva McGonagall]]; in compensation, McGonagall's exposition of the Animagus transformation is instead given by Snape.<ref name=\"DiffsDigitalSpy\" />\n\nThe romantic connection between Ron and Hermione is more prominent in the film than the book; in response to criticism of the first two films for sacrificing character development for mystery and adventure, the emotional development of all three lead characters is given more attention in the third film.<ref name=\"DiffsDigitalSpy\" /> However, any mention of Harry's crush on [[Cho Chang]] is removed,<ref name=\"DiffsEW\" /> and she first appears in the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|fourth film]].<ref name=\"DiffsSR3\" /> ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' shows a darker tone and more of Harry's emotions. For instance, after learning of Black's \"betrayal\" of Harry's parents, he shouts in anger \"I'm gonna kill him\",<ref>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (DVD),  [1:07:05 - 1:07:10].</ref> whereas in the book he's \"too stunned to move\".<ref name=\"DiffsDigitalSpy\" />\n\n==Distribution==\n===Marketing===\nAs with the series' previous instalments, ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' was a large merchandising opportunity.<ref name=\"MarketingForbes\" /> The [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|video game version]], designed by [[EA UK]], was released on 25 May 2004.<ref name=\"GameSpot\" /> [[Mattel]] released film tie-ins that included the ''Harry Potter Championship Quidditch'' board game and character action figures.<ref name=\"MarketingCNN\" /> [[Lego]] also expanded on its previous merchandising for the first two films with the release of sets that included the Knight Bus, Shrieking Shack and a new Hogwarts castle.<ref name=\"LegoWarnerBros\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' was released on [[DVD]] and on [[VHS]] on 23 November 2004.<ref name=\"VHSRelease\" /> The 2-disc Special Editions later came out on DVD and [[Blu-ray]] on 4 October 2016.<ref name=\"DVDSpecialEdition\" /><ref name=\"BlurayRelease\" /> The film was also released on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on 7 November 2017.<ref name=\"UHDBlurayRelease\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' held its New York premiere at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on 23 May 2004,<ref name=\"NYPremiereBBC\" /> followed by its London premiere at [[Leicester Square]] on 30 May 2004.<ref name=\"LondonPremiereCBS\" /> The film then opened in the United Kingdom on 31 May 2004,<ref name=\"UKReleaseTelegraph\" /> and on 4 June 2004 in the United States.<ref name=\"USReleaseIMAXBBC\" /> It was the first film in the series to be released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theatres.<ref name=\"USReleaseIMAXBBC\" /> Upon release, the film broke the record for a biggest single day in the United Kingdom's box office history making \u00a35.3{{nbsp}}million on a Monday.<ref name=\"1stDayNewsround\" /> It went on to break records both with and without previews, making \u00a323.9 million including previews<ref name=\"RecordPreviews\" /> and \u00a39.3 million excluding them.<ref name=\"RecordNoPreviews\" /> ''The Prisoner of Azkaban'' had the highest-opening weekend at the UK's box office, until ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' beat the record in 2015.
