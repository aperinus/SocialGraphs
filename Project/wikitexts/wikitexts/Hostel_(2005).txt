It stars [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Derek Richardson (actor)|Derek Richardson]], [[Ey\u00fe\u00f3r Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson]], and [[Barbara Nedelj\u00e1kov\u00e1]]. It was produced by Mike Fleiss, Roth, and Chris Briggs, and executive produced by [[Boaz Yakin]], [[Scott Spiegel]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]]. The film follows a group of American tourists, as they end up in [[Slovakia]] where they are eventually taken one-by-one by an organization that allows people to torture and kill others.\n\n''Hostel'' was released theatrically in the United States by [[Lions Gate Films]] and [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]'s [[Screen Gems]] on January 6, 2006, and in the Czech Republic by Falcon. The film received divisive reviews from critics, but grossed $82 million worldwide on a $4.8 million budget. It is the first installment of the ''Hostel'' trilogy, followed by ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'' (2007) and ''[[Hostel: Part III]]'' (2011).\n\n==Plot==\nTwo college students, Paxton Rodriguez and Josh Brooks, travel across [[Europe]] with their [[Icelandic people|Icelandic]] friend \u00d3li Eriksson. In the [[Netherlands]], they visit an [[Amsterdam]] nightclub, followed by a [[brothel]]. Unable to get back into their hostel because of a curfew, they accept the offer of a man named Alexei to stay at his apartment. He convinces them that, instead of going to [[Barcelona]], they should visit a [[hostel]] in [[Slovakia]] filled with beautiful women.\n\nThe three board a train to Slovakia, where they encounter a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] businessman, who touches Josh's leg. Josh yells at him, causing him to leave. Arriving in Slovakia, they find that their roommates in the hostel are two women, Natalya and Svetlana. The women invite them to a spa, and later to a disco. Josh has a run in with a gang of local criminal kids. The Dutch businessman intervenes to defend him. Josh apologizes for his reaction on the train.\n\nPaxton and Josh have sex with Natalya and Svetlana, while \u00d3li leaves with the desk girl, Vala. The next morning, \u00d3li does not return. The two are approached by a Japanese woman named Kana, who shows them a photo of \u00d3li and her friend Yuki, who is also missing. Elsewhere, \u00d3li has been decapitated, while Yuki is being tortured. Josh is anxious to leave, but Paxton convinces him to stay one more night with Natalya and Svetlana. Both women slip the men [[tranquilizer]]s. Josh faints on his bed. The ill Paxton ends up locked in the pantry.\n\nJosh wakes up in a dungeon-like room, where the Dutch businessman begins maiming him with a drill, making holes in Josh's body, slicing his [[achilles tendon]]s, then slitting his throat. Paxton wakes up in the disco and returns to the hostel, where he learns that he had supposedly checked out. He is greeted by two women who invite him to the spa. Suspicious, he locates Natalya and Svetlana; Natalya takes Paxton to an old factory, where he sees Josh's mutilated corpse being stitched together by the Dutch businessman. Two men drag Paxton down a hallway, passing by several rooms where other people are being tortured. Paxton is restrained and prepped to be tortured by a German client named Johann.\n\nWhile cutting off a few of Paxton's fingers with a chainsaw, Johann unintentionally severs his hand restraints. Johann falls over, accidentally severing his own leg with the chainsaw. Paxton shoots Johann in the head with a gun. He then kills a guard, changes into business clothes, and finds a business card for the Elite Hunting Club, an organization that allows its clientele to pay to kill and mutilate tourists. Paxton also discovers Kana, whose face is being disfigured with a blowtorch by an American client. Paxton kills the man and rescues Kana and they flee in a stolen car, pursued by guards. Paxton runs over Natalya, Svetlana, and Alexei, killing two of them while the pursuing car finishes off the third. He also encounters the delinquents from earlier and gives them a big pack of candy and gum. They then attack and kill the men pursuing Paxton with concrete blocks.\n\nThe two make it to the train station. Kana, seeing her disfigured face, kills herself by leaping in front of an oncoming train, which attracts attention and allows Paxton to board another train unnoticed. Aboard, Paxton hears the voice of the Dutch businessman. When the train stops in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], Paxton follows the Dutch businessman into a public restroom and makes him suffer and kills him in revenge for his friends\u2019 deaths and suffering he caused him before boarding another train.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nIn the director's cut of the film, Paxton follows the Dutch businessman being accompanied by his young daughter into a public restroom of a train station. After finding her teddy bear in the women's restroom, the Dutch businessman frantically searches the crowd for his missing daughter. Paxton is then seen aboard the moving train with the Dutch businessman's daughter, whom he has kidnapped.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as Paxton Rodriguez\n* [[Derek Richardson (actor)|Derek Richardson]] as Josh Brooks\n* [[Ey\u00fe\u00f3r Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson]] as \u00d3li Eriksson\n* [[Jennifer Lim (British actress)|Jennifer Lim]] as Kana\n* [[Barbara Nedelj\u00e1kov\u00e1]] as Natalya \n* Jana Kaderabkova as Svetlana\n* Jan Vlas\u00e1k as The Dutch Businessman\n* [[Rick Hoffman]] as The American Client\n* Keiko Seiko as Yuki\n* Lubomir Bukovy as Alexei\n* Jana Havlickova as Vala\n* Petr Jani\u0161 as Johann, the German Surgeon\n* [[Takashi Miike]] as The Japanese Sadist\n* Patrik Zigo as The Bubblegum Gang Leader\n* Milda \"Jedi\" Havlas as Desk Clerk Jedi\n* [[Miroslav T\u00e1borsk\u00fd]] as Police officer\n* Josef Bradna as The Butcher\n* [[Eli Roth]] as American Stoner\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter the release of ''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'' (2002), Eli Roth was met with praise from several industry figures, including [[Quentin Tarantino]], who placed the film in his 'Top 10' of the year and immediately reached out to Roth in hopes of working with him on a [[Inglourious Basterds|future project]]. Roth was offered many studio directing jobs, mostly in the form of horror remakes such as ''[[The Last House on the Left (2009 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'', ''[[The Fog (2005 film)|The Fog]]'', and a film in the [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]], among several others, but Tarantino advised him to turn down those offers to instead create an original horror story. While swimming in Tarantino's pool, Roth brainstormed an idea for a low-budget horror film based on a Thai \"murder vacation\" website he came across on the [[dark web]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/78372/11-intense-facts-about-hostel |title=11 Intense Facts About Hostel |last=Pirnia |first=Garin |work=[[Mental Floss]] |date=April 9, 2016 |access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref> Tarantino loved the idea and encouraged Roth to immediately start writing a draft that day, which later formed the basis for ''Hostel''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/15436/ |title=Scream Kings: Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino |last=Hill |first=Logan |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=December 29, 2005 |access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRoth had originally debated creating the film in the style of a fake documentary that would incorporate real people and locations from supposed real underground \"murder vacation\" spots. When hardly any credible information could be found on the topic, the idea was scrapped in favor of a traditionally flowing narrative using fictional locations and characters. [[Principal photography]] took place in the [[Czech Republic]], and many scenes were shot in [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/eli-roth-plans-czech-shoot-for-hostel-2/4027885.article|title=Eli Roth plans Czech shoot for Hostel 2|last=Schwinke|first=Theodore|work=[[Screen International]]|date=2006-07-05|access-date=2015-06-08}}</ref> The torture chamber scenes were filmed in the wing of a [[Prague]] hospital that had been abandoned since 1918.\n\nThe original music score was composed by [[Nathan Barr]], who previously scored ''Cabin Fever'', and commissioned The Prague FILMharmonic Orchestra to perform the score over a four-day period in October 2005.\n\nAnother one of Roth's ideas was that it would have an [[NC-17]] rating, which he hoped would help boost the film's notoriety and marketing. When finished, the first cut of the film successfully received an NC-17 rating from the [[MPAA]] board mostly for its nudity and sexual content; the film originally had a real sex scene between two actors, including a real orgasm, which violated MPAA regulations. Over 20 minutes of footage had to be cut in order for the film to receive an R-rating. The film is rated [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18]] by the [[British Board of Film Classification]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/release/hostel-film-qxnzzxq6vlgtoda3mje2 | title=Hostel }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Hostel'' opened theatrically on January 6, 2006, in the United States and earned $19.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number one at the box office.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2006&wknd=01&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for January 6-8, 2006 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=January 9, 2006 | access-date=September 26, 2015}}</ref> By the end of its run, six weeks later, the film grossed $47.3 million in the US box office and $33.3 million internationally for a worldwide total of $80.6 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hostel.htm | title=Hostel (2006) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=February 17, 2006 | access-date=September 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nReview aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 59% based on 110 reviews and an average rating of 6.1/10.

The torture scenes in ''Hostel'' (snipped toes, sliced ankles, pulled eyeballs) are not, in essence, much different from the surgical terrors in the ''Saw'' films, only Roth, by presenting his characters as victims of the same world of flesh-for-fantasy they were grooving on in the first place, digs deep into the nightmare of a society ruled by the profit of illicit desire.\"<ref>{{cite magazine| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1145742,00.html | magazine=Entertainment Weekly | title=Movie Review: Hostel}}</ref>\n\nGerman film historian Florian Evers pointed out [[the Holocaust]] imagery behind ''Hostel''{{'}}s horror iconography, connecting Roth's film to the [[Nazi exploitation]] genre.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrnmeU9HQoAC&q=vexierbilder+des+Holocaust| work=Vexierbilder des Holocaust, LIT, Munster, 2011 | title= Florian Evers | isbn=9783643111906 | last1=Evers | first1=Florian | year=2011 }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Guardian]]'' film critic [[Peter Bradshaw]] wrote that ''Hostel'' was \"actually silly, crass and queasy.
