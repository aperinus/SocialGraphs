He is hospitalized after managing to painfully unzip it, which causes him to miss their date. Ted subsequently loses contact with her.\n\nThirteen years later in 1998, 29-year-old Ted is still in love with Mary. On the advice of his best friend Dom Woganowski, Ted hires [[private investigator]] Pat Healy to track her down. Healy discovers that she is an [[orthopedic surgeon]] living in [[Miami]]. After observing her for a few days, Healy becomes fixated on her. He returns to Providence and lies to Ted about Mary, telling him she is overweight and has four kids by three different men. Healy quits his job and returns to Miami to pursue her. He resorts to lying, manipulation, and stalking to win Mary over.\n\nHealy and Mary spend several weeks dating before her architect friend Tucker exposes Healy as a fraud. Tucker tells her that Healy is a suspected [[serial murderer]]. An enraged Healy follows him and discovers Tucker actually is a pizza delivery boy named Norm Phipps who also is infatuated with Mary. Years earlier, Norm intentionally injured himself in order to get close to her, hoping she would take him on as a patient. He pretends to still be disabled in order to gain Mary's sympathy and uses his friendship with her to drive away other suitors.\n\nMeanwhile, Ted finds out that Healy was lying about Mary and drives to Florida to see her. During the drive, Ted picks up a hitchhiker who leaves a dead body in Ted's car.  Ted is mistakenly arrested for the murder and bailed out by Dom after the police catch the real killer. Ted finds Mary and they begin dating. Things go well until an anonymous letter reveals that Ted hired Healy to find her, causing Mary to get upset and dump Ted. Enraged, Ted then confronts Healy and Norm, who deny sending the letter. Things come to a head when Dom, who is Mary's ex-boyfriend \"Woogie\", shows up in her apartment and admits to writing the letter. Mary previously had a [[restraining order]] against Dom after he became obsessed with her, which started again when Ted found her.\n\nNorm and Healy intervene and save Mary from Dom, shortly before Ted arrives. Ted realizes that the only one who did not resort to lying or manipulation to win her over was her ex-boyfriend [[Brett Favre]], whom Norm had lied to Mary about to get rid of him. After reuniting Brett with Mary, Ted leaves in tears and Mary chases him down outside. She confesses that she loves Ted and wants to be with him, and they kiss. Magda's boyfriend sees them and attempts to shoot Ted with a sniper's rifle (as he is also infatuated with Mary), but misses and hits Jonathan, the singing narrator instead.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Mary Jensen, an orthopedic surgeon who becomes the obsession of several men.  She previously lived in Rhode Island but was forced to change her name and move to Florida to avoid a stalker.\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as Pat Healy, a private investigator who becomes obsessed with Mary and quits his job to pursue her.\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Ted Stroehmann, a sports writer who is still infatuated with Mary after missing his chance with her as a teenager.\n* [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] as Tucker/Norm Phipps, a pizza delivery man who meets Mary while delivering her a pizza and becomes obsessed with her. He adopts the persona of \"Tucker\", a British architect, and got his back injured to become one of Mary's patients and get closer to her. Norm hides how his injury has healed.\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Dom \"Woogie\" Woganowski, a lawyer who became obsessed with Mary to the point where she took out a restraining order against him.\n* [[Lin Shaye]] as Magda, Mary's neighbor and friend.\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Sully, Healy's friend and contact in Miami.\n* [[Markie Post]] as Sheila Jensen, Mary's mother.\n* [[W. Earl Brown]] as Warren Jensen, Mary's intellectually disabled brother who is very protective of his ears.\n* [[Keith David]] as Charlie, Mary's stepfather.\n* [[Sarah Silverman]] as Brenda, Mary's sarcastic best friend.\n* [[Khandi Alexander]] as Joanie, another of Mary's friends.\n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Detective Krevoy\n* [[Rob Moran]] as Detective Stabler\n* [[Willie Garson]] as Dr. Bob \"Zit Face\", Ted's chiropractor and friend from high-school\n* [[Harland Williams]] as The Hitchhiker, an escaped mental patient and murderer (uncredited).\n* [[Brett Favre]] as Himself, Mary's former boyfriend whom she broke up with after Tucker lied to her about him.\n* [[Steve Sweeney (comedian)|Steve Sweeney]] as Police Officer\n* [[Jonathan Richman]] as Jonathan, the singing narrator.\n* [[Lenny Clarke]] as Fireman.\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Psychiatrist (uncredited).\n\n==Production==\n''There's Something About Mary'' was directed by [[Peter Farrelly|Peter]] amd [[Bobby Farrelly]], who had previously made ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' in 1994 and ''[[Kingpin (1996 film)|Kingpin]]'' in 1996.<ref name=\"20 years\"/> According to Bobby, the scene where Ted accidentally gets his scrotum stuck in his pants fly was inspired by a real incident, when their sister was listening to some records with some [[eighth grade]] students in the basement of their house: \"One of the kids went up [to the bathroom] and he zipped himself up. He was in there for a long time. My dad, who was a doctor, actually had to go in and say, 'Hey, kid. You alright?'\"<ref name=\"20 years\"/> Most of the film was shot in [[Miami]], Florida. The Big Pink Restaurant is where Healy meets with Sully and the Miami-Dade Cultural Center was the location for the architecture exhibit Mary and Healy attended together. The hair gel scene was filmed at the Cardozo Hotel, while Churchill's Pub was used as a [[strip club]] for a scene with Healy.<ref name=\"Big Pink\"/> The makeup effects were the handiwork of makeup effects designer [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]].<ref name=\"Tony Gardner\"/>\n\nBesides [[Ben Stiller]], actors [[Owen Wilson]] and [[Jon Stewart]] were considered potential candidates for the role of Ted Stroehmann.<ref name=\"Telegraph Interview\"/> [[Bill Murray]] was considered for the role of Pat Healy, but the Farrelly brothers thought he was too old for it.<ref name=\"Bill Murray\"/> [[Vince Vaughn]] and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] were also considered for the role of Pat Healy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2012/07/the-lost-roles-of-vince-vaughn.html|title=The Lost Roles of Vince Vaughn|first=Bradford|last=Evans|date=July 26, 2012|website=Vulture}}</ref> Because the Farrelly brothers were fans of the [[New England Patriots]], they originally wanted to cast quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]] as Mary's football-playing boyfriend, but he could not do it due to a [[mosh]] incident he had in a club. The Farrelly brothers later offered the role to [[Steve Young]], but he turned it down due to the film's coarse nature. Ultimately, the role was given to [[Brett Favre]].<ref name=\"Patriots\"/> [[Chris Farley]] was considered for the role of Mary\u2019s brother Warren, however his health was in a rapid decline due to his drug addictions and he was forced to turn down the role. He died in December 1997 in the middle of the film's production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66199/15-fun-facts-about-theres-something-about-mary|title=15 Fun Facts About There's Something About Mary|date=July 21, 2015|website=www.mentalfloss.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/w-earl-brown-1798223471|title=W.
