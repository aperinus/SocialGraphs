It stars [[Bill Murray]], Aykroyd, and Ramis as [[Peter Venkman]], [[Ray Stantz]], and [[Egon Spengler]], three eccentric [[parapsychologists]] who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. It also stars [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Rick Moranis]], and features [[Annie Potts]], [[William Atherton]], and [[Ernie Hudson]] in supporting roles.\n\nBased on his own fascination with spirituality, Aykroyd conceived ''Ghostbusters'' as a project starring himself and [[John Belushi]], in which they would venture through time and space battling supernatural threats. Following Belushi's death in 1982, and with Aykroyd's concept deemed financially impractical, Ramis was hired to help rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic. It was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects, and [[Columbia Pictures]], concerned about its relatively high $25\u201330&nbsp;million budget, had little faith in its box office potential. Filming took place from October 1983 to January 1984, in New York City and Los Angeles. Due to competition for special effects studios among various films in development at the time, [[Richard Edlund]] used part of the budget to found [[Boss Film Studios]], which employed a combination of [[practical effects]], miniatures, and puppets to deliver the ghoulish visuals.\n\n''Ghostbusters'' was released on June 8, 1984, to critical acclaim and became a cultural phenomenon. It was well received for its blend of comedy, action, and horror, and Murray's performance was often singled out for praise. It earned $282.2&nbsp;million during its initial theatrical run, making it the [[1984 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 1984]] in the United States and Canada, and the then-highest-grossing comedy ever. It was the number-one film in theaters for seven consecutive weeks and one of only four films to gross more than $100&nbsp;million that year. Further theatrical releases have increased the total gross to around $295.2&nbsp;million, making it one of the most successful comedy films of the 1980s. In 2015, the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. Its theme song, \"[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]\" by [[Ray Parker Jr.]], was also a number-one hit.\n\nWith its effect on popular culture, and a dedicated fan following, the success of ''Ghostbusters'' launched a multi-billion dollar [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|multimedia franchise]]. This included the popular animated television series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' (1986), its sequel ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'' (1997), [[List of Ghostbusters video games|video games]], board games, [[Ghostbusters (comics)|comic books]], clothing, music, and [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attractions]]. ''Ghostbusters'' was followed in 1989 by ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', which fared less well financially and critically, and attempts to develop a second sequel paused in 2014 following Ramis's death. After [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|a 2016 reboot]] received mixed reviews and underperformed financially, a second sequel to the 1984 film, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', was released in November 2021.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400\u2013700 words. Word count as of 01/19/2022 is 531 words.-->\nAfter [[Columbia University]] [[parapsychology]] professors [[Peter Venkman]], [[Ray Stantz]], and [[Egon Spengler]] experience their first encounter with a ghost at the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]], the university [[Dean (education)|dean]] dismisses the credibility of their [[paranormal]]-focused research and fires them. The trio responds by establishing \"Ghostbusters\", a paranormal investigation and [[Pest control|elimination]] service operating out of a disused firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.\n\nAfter a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett calls the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: \"Zuul\". Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Dana's building while Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost, [[Slimer]], from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly test their equipment, Egon warns the group that crossing the energy streams of their [[proton pack]] weapons could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture the ghost and deposit it in an ecto-containment unit under the firehouse. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous; they hire a fourth member, [[Winston Zeddemore]], to cope with the growing demand.\n\nSuspicious of the Ghostbusters, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment but Peter rebuffs him. Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a [[demigod]] worshipped as a servant to \"Gozer the Gozerian\", a [[shapeshifting]] god of destruction. Upon returning home, she is possessed by Zuul; a similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Peter arrives and finds the possessed Dana/Zuul claiming to be \"the Gatekeeper\". Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims he is \"Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster\". The Ghostbusters agree to keep the pair separated.\n\nPeck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. Louis/Vinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment building to join Dana/Zuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult in the early 20th century, designed Dana's building to function as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about the apocalypse. Faced with supernatural chaos across the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them.\n\nThe Ghostbusters travel to the apartment building roof as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears as a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters then disappears when they attempt to retaliate. Her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters \"choose the form of the destructor\". Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears as a gigantic [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]] that begins destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozer's avatar, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway. The Ghostbusters rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage and are welcomed on the street as heroes.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Ghostbusters characters}}\n[[File:Ghostbusters 1984 cast.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Portrait photos of the stars of the film: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Harold Ramis, and Annie Potts|Stars of the film include (l-r) [[Bill Murray]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Harold Ramis]], and [[Annie Potts]]]]\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[Peter Venkman]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as [[Ray Stantz]]\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Dana Barrett]]\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as [[Egon Spengler]]\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as [[Louis Tully]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Janine Melnitz]]\n* [[William Atherton]] as Walter Peck\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as [[Winston Zeddemore]]\n\nAs well as the main cast, ''Ghostbusters'' features [[David Margulies]] as Lenny Clotch, Mayor of New York, [[Michael Ensign]] as the Sedgewick Hotel manager, and Slavitza Jovan as Gozer (voiced by [[Paddi Edwards]]).

In 1981, Aykroyd read an article on [[quantum physics]] and parapsychology in ''[[The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]]'', which gave him the idea of trapping ghosts. He was also drawn to the idea of modernizing the comedic ghost films of the mid-20th century by comics such as [[Abbott and Costello]] (''[[Hold That Ghost]]'', 1941), [[Bob Hope]] (''[[The Ghost Breakers]]'', 1940) and [[the Bowery Boys]] (''[[Ghost Chasers]]'', 1951).<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" />\n\nAykroyd wrote the script, intending to star alongside [[Eddie Murphy]] and his close friend and fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') alumnus [[John Belushi]], before Belushi's accidental death in March 1982.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> Aykroyd recalled writing one of Belushi's lines when producer and talent agent [[Bernie Brillstein]] called to inform him of Belushi's death.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> He turned to another former ''SNL'' castmate, Bill Murray, who agreed to join without an explicit agreement, which is how he often worked.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> Aykroyd pitched his concept to Brillstein as three men who chase ghosts and included a sketch of the Marshmallow Man character he had imagined. He likened the Ghostbusters to pest-control workers, saying that \"calling a Ghostbuster was just like getting rats removed\".<ref name=\"Esquire\" /> Aykroyd believed Ivan Reitman was the logical choice to direct, based on his successes with films such as ''[[Animal House]]'' (1978) and ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> Reitman was aware of the film's outline while Belushi was still a prospective cast member; this version took place in the future with many groups of intergalactic ghostbusters, and felt it \"would have cost something like $200{{nbsp}}million to make\".<ref name=\"Esquire\" />{{efn|The estimated $200{{nbsp}}million required to realize Dan Aykroyd's original vision for ''Ghostbusters'' is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|200000000|1983}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} Aykroyd's original 70- to 80-page [[film treatment|script treatment]] was more serious in tone and intended to be scary.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" />\n\nReitman met with Aykroyd at Art's Delicatessen in [[Studio City, Los Angeles]], and explained that his concept would be impossible to make. He suggested that setting it entirely on Earth would make the extraordinary elements funnier, and that focusing on realism from the beginning would make the Marshmallow Man more believable by the end. He also wanted to portray the Ghostbusters' origins before starting their business: \"This was beginning of the 1980s\u2014everyone was going into business\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" /> After the meeting, they met Harold Ramis at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Burbank Studios]]. Reitman had worked with Ramis on previous films and believed he could better execute the tone he intended for the script than Aykroyd.<ref name=\"Esquire\" /> He also felt Ramis should play a Ghostbuster. After reading the script, Ramis joined the project immediately.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" />\n\nAlthough the script required considerable changes, Reitman pitched the film to [[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[Frank Price]] in March 1983. Price found the concept funny, but was unsure of the project, as comedies were seen to have limited profitability. He said the film would take a big budget due to its special effects and popular cast.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" /> Reitman reportedly said they could work with $25\u201330&nbsp;million;{{efn|The 1984 budget of $25\u201330&nbsp;million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|25000000|1983}}}}\u2013${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|30000000|1983}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} varying figures have been cited. Price agreed, as long as the film could be released by June 1984.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"THR2016\" /> Reitman later admitted he made up the figure, basing it on three times the budget for ''Stripes'', which seemed \"reasonable\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> This left 13 months to complete the film, with no finished script, effects studio, or filming start date.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /> Reitman hired his previous collaborators [[Joe Medjuck]] and [[Michael C. Gross]] as [[Film producer|associate producers]].{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=18}} Columbia's CEO [[Fay Vincent]] sent his lawyer Dick Gallop to Los Angeles to convince Price not to pursue the film, but Price disagreed. Gallop returned to the head office to report that Price was \"out of control\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" />\n\nAs the title \"Ghostbusters\" was legally restricted by the 1970s children's show ''[[The Ghost Busters]]'', owned by [[Universal Studios]], several alternatives titles were considered, including \"Ghoststoppers\", \"Ghostbreakers\", and \"Ghostsmashers\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"Collider2013\" /><ref name=\"TelegraphJun16\" /> Price parted ways with Columbia early in ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} production and became head of [[Universal Pictures]], at which point he sold Columbia the title for $500,000 plus 1% of the film's profits. Given [[Hollywood accounting|Hollywood's accounting]] practices\u2014a method used by studios to artificially inflate a film's production costs to limit royalty or tax payouts\u2014the film technically never made a profit for Universal to be owed a payment.<ref name=\"Esquire\" /><ref name=\"Collider2013\" /><ref name=\"AtlanticAccounting\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nAykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman began reworking the script, first at Reitman's office, then sequestering themselves and their families on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]]. Aykroyd had a home there, and they worked day and night in his basement for about two weeks.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /> Aykroyd was willing to rework his script; he considered himself a \"[[Scope creep|kitchen sink]]\" writer who created the funny situations and paranormal jargon, while Ramis refined the jokes and dialogue. They wrote separately, then rewrote each other's drafts. Many scenes had to be cut, including an asylum haunted by celebrities, and an illegal ghost-storage facility in a [[New Jersey]] gas station.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> Their initial draft was completed when they left the Vineyard in mid-July 1983, and a third and near-final draft was ready by early August.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" /> When Murray flew to New York after filming ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' (1984) to meet Aykroyd and Ramis, he offered little input on the script or his character. Having written for Murray multiple times, Ramis said he knew \"how to handle his character's voice\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" />\n\nIt was decided early on that Ramis's character would be the brains of the Ghostbusters, Aykroyd's the heart, and Murray's the mouth.<ref name=\"Esquire\" /> Aykroyd drew inspiration from fiction [[archetypes]]: \"Put Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler together, and you have the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], [[Cowardly Lion|the Lion]], and the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]]\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> His concept called for the Ghostbusters to have a boss and to be directed into situations, but Ramis preferred they be in control \"of their own destiny\" and make their own choices. This led to the development of more distinct identities for the characters: Peter as the cool, modern salesman; Ray as the honest, enthusiastic technician; and Egon as the factual, stoic intellectual.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=18}}\n\nReitman thought the most difficult parts of the writing were determining the story's goal, who the villain was and their goal, why ghosts were manifesting, and how a towering Marshmallow Man would appear. The creature was one of many elaborate supernatural entities in Aykroyd's initial treatment, originally intended to emerge from the [[East River]] only 20 minutes into the film. It stood out to Reitman but concerned him because of the relatively realistic tone they were taking. Meanwhile, Reitman searched for a special effects studio, eventually recruiting [[Richard Edlund]] in the same two-week span.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" />\n\n=== Cast and characters ===\n[[File:2009 CUN Award Party William Atherton 008.JPG|thumb|upright|left|alt=Photograph of William Atherton looking slightly to his left|[[William Atherton]] (in 2009) portrays [[Environmental Protection Agency]] inspector Walter Peck.]]\nMurray was considered essential to ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} potential success, but he was known for not committing to projects until late. Price agreed to fund Murray's passion project ''The Razor's Edge'', believing if it failed it would lose little money, and hoping the gesture would secure Murray's commitment to ''Ghostbusters''.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> [[Michael Keaton]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Steve Guttenberg]], and [[Richard Pryor]] were also considered for the role.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"SROtherCast\" /><ref name=\"TelegraphCast\" /> [[Christopher Walken]], [[John Lithgow]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], and Keaton were considered to portray Egon.<ref name=\"TelegraphCast\" /><ref name=\"ShortListEgon\" /> Ramis was inspired by the cover of a journal on abstract architecture for Egon's appearance, featuring a man wearing a three-piece tweed suit and wire-rim glasses, his hair standing straight up. He took the character's first name from a Hungarian refugee with whom he attended school, and the surname from German historian [[Oswald Spengler]].<ref name=\"Esquire\" /> Apart from the three main stars, Medjuck was largely responsible for casting the roles.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=19}}\n\nHudson auditioned five times for the role of Winston Zeddemore.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> According to him, an earlier version of the script gave Winston a larger role as an Air Force demolitions expert with an elaborate backstory. Excited by the part, he agreed to the job for half his usual salary. The night before shooting began, he received a new script with a greatly reduced role; Reitman told him the studio wanted to expand Murray's part.<ref name=\"EWNov2014\" /> Aykroyd said Winston was the role intended for Eddie Murphy, although Reitman refuted this.<ref name=\"PeopleJun2014\" /><ref name=\"VultureApr2011\" /> [[Gregory Hines]] and Reginald VelJohnson were also considered for the part.<ref name=\"CBRJul16\" /><ref name=\"THRVelJohnson\" />\n\n[[Daryl Hannah]], [[Denise Crosby]], [[Julia Roberts]], and [[Kelly LeBrock]] auditioned for the role of Dana Barrett, but Sigourney Weaver attracted the filmmakers' attention. There was resistance to casting her because of the generally serious roles she had played in ''[[Alien (1979 film)|Alien]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' (1982). She revealed her comedic background, developed at the [[Yale School of Drama]], and began walking on all fours and howling like a dog during her audition.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" /><ref name=\"CrosbyHannah\" /><ref name=\"HomeMedia2022\" /> It was her suggestion for Dana to become possessed by Zuul; Reitman said this solved problems with the last act by giving the characters personal stakes in the events.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /> Weaver also changed Dana's occupation from a model to a musician, saying that Dana can be somewhat strict, but has a soul because she plays the cello.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" />\n\n[[John Candy]] was offered the role of Louis Tully. He told Reitman he did not understand the character and suggested portraying Tully with a German accent and multiple [[German Shepherd]]s, but the filmmakers felt there were already enough dogs in the film. Candy chose not to pursue the role. Reitman had previously worked with Rick Moranis and sent him the script. He accepted the role an hour later.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" /><ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" /> Moranis developed many aspects of his character, including making him an accountant, and ad-libbed the lengthy speech at Tully's party.<ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" /> [[Sandra Bernhard]] turned down the role of the Ghostbusters' secretary Janine Melnitz, which went to Annie Potts. When she arrived for her first day of filming, Reitman rushed Potts into the current scene. She quickly changed out of her street clothes and borrowed a pair of glasses worn by the [[set dresser]] which her character subsequently wore throughout the film.<ref name=\"HuffPoSep2014\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" />\n\nWilliam Atherton was chosen for the role of Walter Peck after he had appeared in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Broadway (play)|Broadway]]''. Peck was described as akin to [[Margaret Dumont]]'s role as a [[Foil (literature)|comedic foil]] to the [[Marx Brothers]]. Atherton said: \"It can't be funny, and I don't find [the Ghostbusters] in the least bit charming. I have to be outraged\".<ref name=\"AVClubApr2010\" /> The role of the [[Sumer]]ian god Gozer the Gozerian, envisioned as a business-suited architect, was originally intended for [[Paul Reubens]]. When he passed on the idea, Yugoslavian actress Slavitza Jovan was cast and the character changed to one inspired by the [[androgynous]] looks of [[Grace Jones]] and [[David Bowie]].<ref name=\"HuffPoSep2014\" /><ref name=\"DreadCenFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"VultureMay2011\" /> Paddi Edwards was uncredited as the voice of Gozer, dubbing over Jovan's strong Slavic accent.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"PeopleNov2014\" /> Reitman's wife and their children, [[Jason Reitman|Jason]] and [[Catherine Reitman|Catherine]], filmed a cameo appearance as a family fleeing Dana's building, but the scene was cut because Jason was too scared by the setup to perform a second take.{{sfn|Inguanzo|2021|p=11}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:55 Central Park West (Ghostbusters Building) by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Photograph of 55 Central Park West which served as the home of Dana and Louis and the setting for the climactic battle | [[55 Central Park West]] (in 2007), which served as the setting for the climactic battle.]]\n[[Principal photography]] began in New York City on October 28, 1983.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"BTMSep14\" /> On the first day, Reitman brought Murray to the set, still unsure if he had read the script.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> Filming in New York lasted for approximately six weeks, finishing just before Christmas.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /> Reitman was conscious they had to complete the New York phase before they encountered inhospitable December weather.<ref name=\"LAWeeklyJul2016\" /> At the time, choosing to shoot in New York City was considered risky. In the early 1980s, many saw the city as synonymous with [[History of New York City (1978\u2013present)#Koch and Dinkins (1978\u20131993)|fiscal disaster and violence]], and Los Angeles was seen as the center of the entertainment industry. In a 2014 interview, Reitman said he chose New York because \"I wanted the film to be{{nbsp}}... my New York movie\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> As Reitman was working with comedians, he encouraged [[Improvisational theatre|improvisation]], adapting multiple takes and keeping the cast creations that worked, but directing them back to the script.<ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" />\n\nSome [[guerrilla filmmaking]] took place, capturing spontaneous scenes at iconic locations around the city, including one shot at [[Rockefeller Center]] where the actors were chased off by a real security guard.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> A scene was shot on [[Central Park West]] with extras chanting \"Ghostbusters\" before the name had been cleared. Medjuck contacted the studio, urging them to secure permission to use the word as the title.<ref name=\"Esquire\" />\n\nThe building at [[55 Central Park West]] served as the home of Weaver's character and the setting of the Ghostbusters' climactic battle with Gozer. The art department added extra floors and embellishments using [[matte painting]]s, models, and digital effects to create the focal point of ghostly activity.<ref name=\"FSR\" /><ref name=\"NYMag2005\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyMay2015\" /> During shooting of the final scene at the building, city officials allowed the closure of the adjacent streets during [[rush hour]], affecting traffic across a large swath of the city. Gross commented that, from the top of the building, they could see traffic queuing all the way to [[Brooklyn]]. At various points, a police officer drew his gun on a taxi driver who refused orders; in a similar incident, another officer pulled a driver through his limo window.

Location scouts searched for buildings that could replicate the interiors of buildings being filmed in New York.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"LAWeeklyJul2016\" /> Reitman tried using the interior of Hook & Ladder 8, but was unable to take it over long enough because it was an active fire station. Interior firehouse shots were taken instead at the decommissioned [[Fire Station No. 23 (Los Angeles, California)|Fire House No. 23]] in downtown Los Angeles. The building design, while common in New York, was a rarity in Los Angeles. An archival photograph of an active crew in Fire House No. 23 from 1915 was hung in the background of the Ghostbusters' office.<ref name=\"LAWeeklyJul2016\" />\n\nFilming in the main reading room of the New York Public Library was only allowed in the early morning and had to be concluded by 10:00&nbsp;am.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /> The basement library stacks were represented by the [[Los Angeles Central Library]] as Reitman said they were interchangeable.<ref name=\"LAWeeklyJul2016\" /> The [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel]] stood in for the scenes set at the fictional Sedgewick Hotel.{{sfn|Wallace|2015|pp=47\u201348}} Principal photography concluded at the end of January 1984, after between 55 and 62 days of filming.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"TestedMay15\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nThe short production schedule and looming release date meant Reitman edited the film while it was being shot. There was often only time for a few takes.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /> Reitman sometimes found making an effects-laden movie frustrating, as the special effects had to be [[storyboard]]ed and filmed in advance; there was no option to go back and produce new scenes. As Gross described it: {{nowrap|\"[Y]ou}} storyboard in advance, that's like editing in advance. You've got a scene, they're going to approve that scene, and we're going to spend nine months doing that cut. There's no second takes, no outtakes, there's no coverage. You can cut stuff, but you can't add stuff. It made [Reitman] so confined that it really bothered him\".<ref name=\"TestedMay15\" />\n\nA deleted scene involved a segment at \"Fort Detmerring\" where Ray has a sexual encounter with a female ghost. The scene was intended to introduce a love interest for Aykroyd. Ramis believed it was extraneous to the fast-moving plot, however, so Reitman used the footage as a dream sequence during the mid-film montage instead.<ref name=\"SlashFeb17\" /> Editor [[Sheldon Kahn]] sent Reitman black-and-white reels of sequences during filming. They not only allowed him to make changes, but he considered they also helped him understand how to better pace the film. Kahn completed the first full cut three weeks after filming concluded.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /> The final cut runs for 105{{nbsp}}minutes.<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{See also|Ghostbusters (1984 soundtrack)|Ghostbusters (song)|l1=Ghostbusters ''soundtrack''}}\n{{Listen|filename=Ghostbusters 1984 Elmer Bernstein Score Sample.ogg|pos=right|title=''Elmer Bernstein&nbsp;\u2013 Main Theme''|description=Bernstein scored an \"antic\" theme for the Ghostbusters, balancing the film's comedic and serious tones{{sfn|Larson|1985|pp=9\u201410}}|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nThe ''Ghostbusters'' [[film score|score]] was composed by [[Elmer Bernstein]] and performed by the 72-person [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] orchestra at [[The Village (studio)|The Village]] in [[West Los Angeles, California]]. It was orchestrated by David Spear and Bernstein's son [[Peter Bernstein (composer)|Peter]].{{sfn|Larson|1985|pp=9\u201410}}<ref name=\"TheVillage\" /> Elmer Bernstein had previously scored several of Reitman's films and joined the project early on, before all the cast had been signed.{{sfn|Larson|1985|pp=9\u201410}} Reitman wanted a grounded, realistic score and did not want the music to tell the audience when something was funny.<ref name=\"TestedMay15\" /> Bernstein used the [[ondes Martenot]] (effectively a keyboard equivalent of a [[theremin]]) to produce the \"eerie\" effect. Bernstein had to bring a musician from England to play the instrument because there were so few trained ondists. He also used three [[Yamaha DX7]] synthesizers.{{sfn|Larson|1985|pp=9\u201410}}<ref name=\"TheVillage\" /> In a 1985 interview Bernstein described ''Ghostbusters'' as the most difficult score he had written, finding it challenging to balance the varying comedic and serious tones. He created an \"antic\" theme for the Ghostbusters he described as \"cute, without being really way out\". He found the latter parts of the film easier to score, aiming to make it sound \"awesome and mystical\".{{sfn|Larson|1985|pp=9\u201410}}\n\nEarly on Reitman and Bernstein discussed the idea that ''Ghostbusters'' would feature popular music at specific points to complement Bernstein's original score. This includes \"Magic\" by Mick Smiley, which plays during the scene when the ghosts are released from the Ghostbusters headquarters. Bernstein's main theme for the Ghostbusters was later replaced by [[Ray Parker Jr.]]'s \"[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]\".{{sfn|Larson|1985|pp=9\u201410}}<ref name=\"TheVillage\" /> Bernstein personally disliked the use of these songs, particularly \"Magic\", but said, \"it's very hard to argue with something like [\"Ghostbusters\"], when it is up in the top ten on the charts\".{{sfn|Larson|1985|pp=9\u201410}}\n\nMusic was required for a montage in the middle of the film, and \"[[I Want a New Drug]]\" by [[Huey Lewis and the News]] was used as a temporary placeholder because of its appropriate tempo. Reitman was later introduced to Parker Jr. who developed \"Ghostbusters\" with a similar riff to match the montage.<ref name=\"Esquire\" /> There were approximately 50 to 60 different theme songs developed for ''Ghostbusters'' by different artists before Parker Jr.'s involvement, though none was deemed suitable.<ref name=\"CBCJul16\" /><ref name=\"MediumJul16\" /> [[Huey Lewis]] was approached to compose the film's theme, but was already committed to work on ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985).<ref name=\"AFI\" />\n\n== Design ==\nDuring the thirteen-month production, all the major special effects studios were working on other films. Those that remained were too small to work on the approximately 630 individual effects shots needed for ''Ghostbusters''. At the same time, special effects cinematographer Richard Edlund planned to leave [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) and start his own business. Reitman convinced Columbia to collaborate with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), which also needed an effects studio, to advance Edlund $5&nbsp;million to establish his own company, [[Boss Film Studios]].<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"THR2016\" /> According to Edlund, lawyers used much of the setup time finalizing the contract, leaving only ten months remaining to build the effects studio, shoot the scenes, and [[Compositing|composite]] the images.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> The Boss Film Studios' team was split to complete work on ''Ghostbusters'' and MGM's science-fiction film ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]''.<ref name=\"AFI\" /> The $5&nbsp;million effects came in at $700,000 over budget.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /> The strict filming schedule meant most of the effects shots were captured in one take.<ref name=\"TestedMay15\" /> Gross oversaw both the creation of Boss Film Studios, and the hiring of many conceptual designers including comic book artists [[Tanino Liberatore]] (whose work went unused) and [[Bernie Wrightson]] (who helped conceive several ghost designs), and [[Storyboard#Film|storyboarder]] Thom Enriquez, whose designs contributed to the \"Onion Head ghost\".{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=19}}\n\n=== Creature effects ===\n{{See also|Slimer|Stay Puft Marshmallow Man}}\n[[File:Steve Johnson, convention appearance, Texas October 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A photograph of Steve Johnson|[[Steve Johnson (special effects artist)|Steve Johnson]] created the final design for the \"Onion Head ghost\", later named \"Slimer\".]]\n\nEdlund's previous work on the supernatural horror film ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982) served as a reference for the ghost designs in ''Ghostbusters''. Gross said it was difficult to balance making the ghosts a genuine threat while fitting the film's more comedic tone.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=22}}{{sfn|McCabeB|2016|p=29}} Special effects artist [[Steve Johnson (special effects artist)|Steve Johnson]] sculpted the gluttonous, slimy, green ghost then known as the \"Onion Head ghost\" on set due to the puppet's unpleasant smell.<ref name=\"TelegraphJun16\" /><ref name=\"BDJun2018\" /> The creature was given the name \"Slimer\" in the 1986 animated television series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]''.<ref name=\"AFI\" /> The Slimer design took six months and cost approximately $300,000. After struggling to complete a design due to executive interference, Johnson took at least three grams of cocaine and completed the final design in one night, based in part on Aykroyd's and Ramis's wish for the creature to homage Belushi.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"Esquire\" /><ref name=\"BDJun2018\" />{{sfn|Waddell|2016|p=42}} The full-size [[foam rubber]] puppet was worn by Mark Wilson and filmed against a black background. Puppeteers manipulated the model's movements with cables.<ref name=\"AFI\" />{{sfn|Waddell|2016|p=42}}{{sfn|McCabeC|2016|pp=80, 82}}\n\nAykroyd tasked his friend, referred to as the Viking, with designing the Marshmallow Man, asking for a combination of the [[Michelin Man]] and the [[Pillsbury Doughboy]] in a sailor hat.<ref name=\"Esquire\" /> The Marshmallow Man outfit was built and portrayed by actor and special effects artist Bill Bryan, who modeled his walk on [[Godzilla]]. There were eighteen foam suits, each costing between $25,000 and $30,000; seventeen of them, worn by stuntman Tommy Cesar, were burned as part of filming.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" />{{sfn|McCabeC|2016|p=82}} Bryan used a separate air supply due to the foam's toxicity. There were three different heads for the suit, built from foam and fiberglass, with different expressions and movements controlled by cable mechanisms. The costume was filmed against scale models to finish the effect. The effects team was able to find only one model of a police car at the correct scale and bought several, modifying them to represent different vehicles. The water from a burst hydrant hit by a remote-controlled car was actually sand as the water did not scale down.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /><ref name=\"AMC\" /><ref name=\"StanWinston\" /> The \"marshmallow\" raining down on the crowd after it is destroyed was shaving cream. After seeing the intended {{convert|150|lb|kg}} of shaving cream to be used, Atherton insisted on testing it. The weight knocked a stuntman down, and they ended up using only {{convert|75|lb|kg}}. The cream acted as a skin irritant after hours of filming, giving some of the cast rashes.<ref name=\"Esquire\" />\n\nJohnson also sculpted the Zombie Cab Driver puppet.{{sfn|McCabeC|2016|p=80}} It was the only puppet shot on location in New York City. Johnson based it on a reanimated corpse puppet he had made for ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981).{{sfn|McCabeC|2016|p=80}} Johnson and Wilson collaborated on the Library Ghost, creating a puppet operated by up to 20 cables running through the torso that controlled aspects such as moving the head, arms, and pulling rubber skin away from the torso to transform it from a humanoid into a monstrous ghoul.{{sfn|McCabeC|2016|p=81}} The original Library Ghost puppet was considered too scary for younger audiences and was repurposed for use in ''[[Fright Night]]'' (1985).<ref name=\"IndieWireJun2012\" /> The [[library catalog]] scene was accomplished live in three takes, with the crew blowing air through copper pipes to force the cards into the air. These had to be collected and reassembled for each take. Reitman used a multi-camera setup to focus on the librarian and the cards flying around her and a wider overall shot.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /> The floating books were hung on strings.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" />\n\n[[Randall William Cook|Randy Cook]] was responsible for creating the quarter-scale [[stop-motion]] puppets of Gozer's minions Zuul and Vinz, the Terror Dogs, when in motion. The model was heavy and unwieldy, and it took nearly thirty hours to film it moving across a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} stage for the scene where it pursues Louis Tully across a street.{{sfn|McCabeC|2016|p=81}} For the scene where Dana is pinned to her chair by demonic hands before a doorway beaming with light, Reitman said he was influenced by ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). A rubber door was used to allow distortion as if something was trying to come through it, while [[grip (job)|grips]] concealed in a trapdoor beneath the chair, burst through it while wearing demonic dog-leg gloves.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /> Made before the advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), any non-puppet ghosts had to be animated. It took up to three weeks to create one second of footage.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /> For Gozer, Slavitza Jovan wore red contact lenses that caused her a great deal of pain, and she wore a harness to move around the set.<ref name=\"FSR\" />\n\n=== Technology and equipment ===\n{{See also|Ectomobile|Proton pack}}\nHardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for designing most of the Ghostbusters' iconic equipment, including the \"proton packs\" used to wrangle ghosts, ghost traps, and their vehicle, the [[Ectomobile]]. The equipment had to be designed and built in the six weeks before filming began in September 1983.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\" /><ref name=\"GizmodoSep14\" /> Inspired by a military issue [[flamethrower]], the \"proton packs\" consisted of a handheld proton stream firing \"neutrino wand\" connected by a hose to a backpack said to contain a nuclear accelerator.<ref name=\"Collider2013\" /><ref name=\"WiredJul17\" /> Dane said he \"went home and got foam pieces and just threw a bunch of stuff together to get the look. It was highly machined but it had to look off-the-shelf and military surplus\".{{sfn|Wallace|2015|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nFollowing Reitman's tweaks to the design, on-screen models of the \"proton packs\" were made from a fiberglass shell with an aluminum backplate bolted to a [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment|United States Army backpack frame]].<ref name=\"WiredJul17\" /> Each pack weighed approximately {{convert|30|lb|kg}} with the batteries for lighting installed, and strained the actors' backs during the long shoots.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" />{{sfn|Wallace|2015|pp=55\u201356}} Two lighter versions were made; a hollow one with surface details for wide shots, and a foam rubber version for action scenes.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /><ref name=\"WiredJul17\" /> The fiberglass props were created by special effects supervisor [[Chuck Gaspar]], based on Dane's design. Gaspar used rubber molds to create identical fiberglass shells.{{sfn|Wallace|2015|pp=55\u201356}} The \"neutrino wand\" had a [[flash (photography)|flashbulb]] at the tip, giving animators an origin point for the proton streams.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /> Fake walls laced with pyrotechnics were used to practically create the damage of the proton streams.<ref name=\"LAWeeklyJul2016\" /> The \"Psychokinetic Energy meter\" (\"PKE meter\") prop was built using an Iona SP-1 handheld shoe polisher as a base, to which lights and electronics were affixed.{{sfn|Wallace|2015|p=59}} The technology was designed to not be overly fancy or sleek, emphasizing the characters' scientific backgrounds combined with the homemade nature of their equipment.<ref name=\"LAWeeklyJul2016\" />\n\nThe Ectomobile was in the first draft of Aykroyd's script, and he and John Daveikis developed some early concepts for the car. Dane developed fully detailed drawings for the interior and exterior and supervised the transformation of the 1959 [[Cadillac Miller-Meteor]] ambulance conversion into the Ectomobile.<ref name=\"DriveJul16\" /> According to Aykroyd, the actual vehicle was \"an ambulance that we converted to a hearse and then converted to an ambulance\".<ref name=\"THREctomobile\" /> Early concepts featured a black car with purple and white strobe lights giving it a supernatural glow, but this idea was scrapped after cinematographer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs (cinematographer)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs]] noted that dark paint would not film well at night. The concept also had fantastic features such as the ability to dematerialize and travel inter-dimensionally. Two vehicles were purchased, one for the pre-modification scenes.<ref name=\"DriveJul16\" /> Dane designed its high-tech roof array with objects including a directional antenna, an air-conditioning unit, storage boxes and a [[radome]].{{sfn|Wallace|2015|pp=41\u201342}} Because of its size, the roof rack was shipped to Manhattan on an airplane, while the car was transported to the East Coast by train.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\" /> Sound designer [[Richard Beggs]] created the siren from a recording of a leopard snarl, cut and played backward.{{sfn|Wallace|2015|pp=41\u201342}}\n\n=== Logo and sets ===\n[[File:ProhibitionSign2.svg|thumb|upright|alt= The design of the \"no ghosts\" logo features a diagonal bar that runs through a red circle from top-left to bottom-right.|The alternative \"correct\" design of the \"no ghosts\" logo features a diagonal bar that runs top-left to bottom-right.<ref name=\"CreativeReview\" />]]\nIn the script, Aykroyd described the Ghostbusters clothing and vehicle as bearing a [[no symbol]] with a ghost trapped in it, crediting the Viking with the original concept.<ref name=\"CreativeReview\" /><ref name=\"NationalPostJun1414\" /> The final design fell to Gross, who had volunteered to serve as [[art director]]. As the logo would be required for props and sets, it needed to be finalized quickly, and Gross worked with Boss Film artist and creature design consultant [[Brent Boates]] who drew the final concept, and [[R/GA]] animated the logo for the film's opening. According to Gross, two versions of the logo exist, with one having \"ghostbusters\" written across the diagonal part of the sign. Gross did not like how it looked and flipped the diagonal bar to read top left to bottom right instead, but they later removed the wording. According to Gross, this is the correct version of the sign that was used throughout Europe. The bottom left to top right version was used in the United States as that was the design of the No symbol there.<ref name=\"CreativeReview\" />\n\nMedjuck also hired [[John DeCuir]] as [[production designer]].<ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" /> The script did not specify where Gozer would appear, and DeCuir painted the top of Dana's building with large, crystal doors that opened as written in the script.<ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" /> The fictional rooftop of 55 Central Park West was constructed at Stage 12 on the Burbank Studios lot. It was one of the largest constructed sets in film history and was surrounded by a 360-degree [[cyclorama]] painting. The lighting used throughout the painting consumed so much power that the rest of the studio had to be shut down, and an additional four generators added, when it was in use.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"LAWeeklyJul2016\" /><ref name=\"USAAug14\" /> Small models such as planes were hung on string to animate the backdrop.<ref name=\"THR2016\" /> The set was built three stories off the ground to allow for filming from low angles.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" />\n\nThe first three floors and street-front of Dana's building were recreated as sets for filming, including the climactic earthquake scene where hydraulics were used to raise broken parts of the street.<ref name=\"FSR\" />{{sfn|Wallace|2015|pp=38\u201339}} Broken pieces of pavement and the road were positioned outside the real location to create a seamless transition between the two shots.<ref name=\"LAWeeklyJul2016\" /> DeCuir said: \"They had one night to dress the street. When people went home early in the evening everything was normal, and when the little old ladies came out to walk their dogs in the morning, the whole street had erupted. Apparently, people complained to the New York Police Department and their switchboard lit up\".{{sfn|Wallace|2015|p=39}} For the scene where Dana's apartment explodes outwards, Weaver stood on set as the stunt happened.<ref name=\"DOGMay2016\" /> Similarly, the scene of Weaver [[Levitation (illusion)|rotating in the air]] was performed on set using a body-cast and mechanical arm concealed in the curtains, a trick Reitman learned working with magician [[Doug Henning]].<ref name=\"FSR\" />\n\n== Release ==\n=== Test screening and marketing ===\n''Ghostbusters'' was screened for [[test audience]]s on February 3, 1984, with unfinished effects shots to determine if the comedy worked. Reitman was still concerned audiences would not react well to the Marshmallow Man because of its deviation from the realism of the rest of the film.<ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" /> Reitman recalled that approximately 200 people were recruited off the streets to view the film in a theater on the Burbank lot. It was during the opening library scene Reitman knew the film worked. Audiences reacted with fear, laughs, and applause as the Librarian Ghost transformed into a monster.<ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" /> The fateful Marshmallow scene was met with a similar reaction, and Reitman knew he would not have to perform any [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|re-shoots]].<ref name=\"THR2016\" /><ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" /> The screening for fellow industry members fared less well. Price recalled laughing as the rest of the audience sat deadpan; he rationalized an industry audience wants failure. Murray and Aykroyd's agent [[Michael Ovitz]] recalled an executive telling him, \"Don't worry: we all make mistakes\", while [[Roberto Goizueta]], [[Chairperson|chairman]] of Columbia's parent, [[The Coca-Cola Company]], said: \"Gee, we're going to lose our shirts\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"EWJun2000\" />\n\n{{external media|video1=[http://youtube.com/watch?v=OqpumEZmxa0 Ghostbusters promotional film for Showest 1984 Bill Murray & Dan Aykroyd]}}\nIn the months before its debut, a teaser trailer focused on the \"No ghosts\" logo, helping it become recognizable far in advance, and generating interest in the film without mentioning its title or its stars.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"EWanniverinterview\" /> A separate theatrical trailer contained a [[toll-free telephone number]] with a message by Murray and Aykroyd waiting for the 1,000 callers per hour it received over a six-week period.<ref name=\"TelegraphJun16\" /> They also appeared in a video for [[ShoWest]], a theater-owner convention, to promote the film.<ref name=\"EWApr519\" /> Columbia spent approximately $10{{nbsp}}million on marketing, including $2.25{{nbsp}}million on prints, $1{{nbsp}}million on promotional materials, and $7{{nbsp}}million on advertising and miscellaneous costs including a $150,000 premiere for a hospital and the hotel costs for the press.<ref name=\"NYTimesJan87\" /> Including the budget and marketing costs, it was estimated the film would have to make at least $80{{nbsp}}million to turn a profit.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=22}}\n\n=== Box office ===\n{{See also|1984 in film}}\nThe [[premiere]] of ''Ghostbusters'' took place on June 7, 1984, at the Avco Cinema in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]], before its wide release the following day across 1,339 theaters in the United States (U.S.) and Canada.<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"BOMMain\" /> During its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, the film earned $13.6{{nbsp}}million\u2014an average of $10,040 per theater.{{efn|The opening weekend gross of $13.6{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|13600000|1984}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} It finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of premiering horror-comedy ''[[Gremlins]]'' ($12.5{{nbsp}}million), and the adventure film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' ($12&nbsp;million), in its third week of release.<ref name=\"BOMMain\" /><ref name=\"BOMOpeningWKND\" /> The gross increased to $23.1&nbsp;million during its first week,{{efn|The opening week gross of $23.1{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|23100000|1984}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} becoming the first major success for the studio since ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"EWJun2000\" /><ref name=\"BOMWeekly\" /><ref name=\"EW1993\" /> The film remained number one for seven consecutive weeks, grossing $146.5{{nbsp}}million, before being ousted by ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' in early August.<ref name=\"NYTimesAug84\" /><ref name=\"NYTimesJul1284\" /><ref name=\"BOMWeek7\" />\n\n''Ghostbusters'' regained the number one spot the following week before spending the next five weeks at number two, behind the action film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' and then the thriller ''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]''.<ref name=\"NYTAug884\" /><ref name=\"BOMWeek10\" /><ref name=\"BOMWeek11\" /> ''Ghostbusters'' remained among the top-three grossing films for sixteen straight weeks before beginning a gradual decline and falling from the top-ten by late October.

The ghosts, which were once human, are not acknowledged as such and are treated as a nuisance that the Ghostbusters transport to less desirable areas, similar to real-world gentrification. The Ghostbusters charge a substantial fee for their services and so generally serve the affluent such as the Sedgewick hotel and Dana Barrett, while poorer Chinese citizens pay for their services in meat.{{sfn|Clare|2014|pp=96\u201398}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=36\u201337}} In this way, Clare argues, ''Ghostbusters'' promotes the regeneration of New York City but ignores the cost to the poor and disenfranchised to achieve it.{{sfn|Clare|2014|pp=101\u2013102}} Author Zoila Clark noted that concept art of an unused Chinatown ghost bore similarities to a stereotypical Chinese immigrant including long, braided hair and a triangular agricultural hat.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n=== Immaturity ===\nAuthor Nicole Matthews argued the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=110}} Critic [[Vincent Canby]] said a film's profitability was dependent on addressing children who \"can identify with a 40-year-old-man with a mid-life crisis and 40-year-old-men in midlife crises who long to fight pirates with cardboard cutlasses\".{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=111}} ''Ghostbusters'' presents Venkman's immature comedic sarcasm as a means of disarming situations and furthering the narrative. Author Jim Whalley wrote that this presents a clear tonal shift in the sequel; in ''Ghostbusters'', the characters are hired workers just doing their job, whereas in ''Ghostbusters II'' they are noble heroes saving the city. In doing so, ''Ghostbusters II'' reimagines Venkman's persona as comedic relief instead of a practical tool.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=102}} The primarily male audience also results in female characters that are either absent or not important to the overall story.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=105}} Author Jane Crisp wrote that Dana encountering Zuul in her fridge presents a stereotypical view of women being associated with the home and kitchen.{{sfn|Crisp|1987}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Ghostbusters'' is considered one of the first blockbusters and is credited with refining the term to effectively create a new genre that mixed comedy, science fiction, horror, and thrills. ''Ghostbusters'' also confirmed the merchandising success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) was not a fluke. A successful, recognizable brand could be used to launch spin-offs, helping establish a business model in the film industry that has since become the status quo. Once ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} popularity was clear, the studio aggressively cultivated its profile, translating it into merchandising and other media such as television, extending its profitable lifetime long after the film had left theaters.<ref name=\"rs 2016\" />\n\nEntertainment industry observers credit ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Saturday Night Live'' with reversing the negative perception of New York City in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"VultureJul16\" /> Weaver said: \"I think it was a love letter to New York and New Yorkers{{nbsp}}... the doorman saying, 'Someone brought a cougar to a party'\u2014that's so New York. When we come down covered with marshmallow, and there are these crowds of New Yorkers of all types and descriptions cheering for us{{nbsp}}... it was one of the most moving things I can remember\".{{sfn|Wallace|2015|p=39}}<ref name=\"EWanniverinterview\" /> It is similarly credited with helping diminish the divide between television and film actors. Talent agent Michael Ovitz said that before ''Ghostbusters'', television actors were only considered for minor roles in film.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"VultureJul16\" /> Describing ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} enduring popularity, Reitman said \"kids are all worried about death and... ghost-like things. By watching ''Ghostbusters'', there's a sense that you can control this, that you can mitigate it somehow and it doesn't have to be that frightening. It became this movie that parents liked to bring their kids to\u2014they could appreciate it on different levels but still watch it together\".<ref name=\"RollingJuly2016\" />\n\n=== Cultural influence ===\n''Ghostbusters'' was considered a phenomenon and highly influential.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"EWanniverinterview\" /><ref name=\"rs 2016\" /><ref name=\"ForbesJul19\" /> The ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} theme song was a hit, and Halloween of 1984 was dominated by children dressed as the titular protagonists.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"rs 2016\" /><ref name=\"CosmoSep17\" /> It had a significant effect on popular culture and is credited with inventing the special-effects driven comedy.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /><ref name=\"EWanniverinterview\" /><ref name=\"rs 2016\" /><ref name=\"ForbesJul19\" /> Its basic premise of a particular genre mixed with comedy, and a team combating an otherworldly threat has been replicated with varying degrees of success in films like ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' (1997), ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'' (2001), ''[[The Watch (2012 film)|The Watch]]'' (2012), ''[[R.I.P.D.]]'' (2013), and ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"NationalPostJun1414\" /><ref name=\"NewYorkerApr14\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyAug15\" /> In 2015, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected ''Ghostbusters'' for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]], finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Reitman responded: \"It's an honor to know that a movie that begins with a ghost in a library now has a spot on the shelves of the Library of Congress\".<ref name=\"THRDec2015\" />\n\nIn 1984, the ''Ghostbusters'' phenomenon was referred to across dozens of advertisements for everything from airlines to dentistry and real estate. The \"-busters\" suffix became a common term used at both local and national stages, being applied to topics like the United States national budget (\"budgetbusters\"), agriculture (\"cropbusters\"), B-52s (\"nukebusters\"), sanitation (\"litterbusters\"), or [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airlines]] (\"pricebusters\"). Similarly, the \"no ghosts\" logo was modified to protest political candidates like Ronald Reagan and [[Walter Mondale]] to [[Mickey Mouse]] by striking [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] workers.{{sfn|TheDay|1984|p=18}} Other contributions to the cultural lexicon included \"Who ya gonna call?\" from Parker Jr's \"Ghostbusters\",<ref name=\"MediumJul16\" /> and Murray's adlib of \"this chick is toast\" against Gozer to imply she was finished or doomed over the scripted line of \"I'm gonna turn this guy into toast\". This is thought to be the first historic usage of \"toast\" as a slang term.<ref name=\"BusinessInsideSep18\" />\n\n''Ghostbusters'' quickly developed a dedicated fan following that has continued to thrive in the years since.<ref name=\"ScreeNRantJul16\" /> Despite its mainstream success, it is considered an example of a [[Cult film#cult blockbuster|cult blockbuster]]\u2014a popular film with a dedicated fanbase.<ref name=\"THREctomobile\" /><ref name=\"SpikedJul16\" /><ref name=\"PopMattersJun11\" /> It is popular globally, inspiring fan clubs, fan-made films,<ref name=\"SyFyFeb19\" /> art,<ref name=\"TheVergeApr14\" /> and conventions.<ref name=\"WizardJun18\" /> Fans dressed as Ghostbusters occasionally burst into the main reading room of the New York Public Library.<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\" /> The 2016 [[Crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] documentary ''[[Ghostheads]]'' follows various fans of the series and details the effect it has had on their lives, interspersed with interviews from crew, including Aykroyd, Reitman, and Weaver.<ref name=philly /><ref name=\"GizmodoFeb16\" /> A separate 2020 documentary, ''Cleanin' Up the Town: Remembering Ghostbusters'', details the film production.<ref name=\"CLeaninUp\" /> Memorabilia from the film is popular, with a screen-used proton pack selling for $169,000 at a 2012 auction.<ref name=\"THRJul12\" /> In 2017, a newly discovered [[ankylosaur]] fossil was named [[Zuul|''Zuul crurivastator'']] after Gozer's minion.<ref name=\"CBCMay17\" /><ref name=\"LATimesMay17\" />\n\n''Ghostbusters'' was turned into a special-effects laden stage show at [[Universal Studios Florida]], which ran from 1990 to 1996, based mainly on the final battle with Gozer.

It ran for 140 episodes over seven seasons across six years, and itself spawned a spin-off Slimer-centric sub-series, [[The Real Ghostbusters (comics)|comic books]], and merchandise. It was followed by a sequel series, 1997's ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]''.<ref name=\"CBRJan18\" /><ref name=\"DOGJul16\" /> A film sequel, ''Ghostbusters II'', was released in 1989. Despite breaking box office records and attracting an estimated two million more people to its opening than ''Ghostbusters'', the sequel earned less than the original and received a less enthusiastic response.<ref name=\"LATimesJun89\" /><ref name=\"VultureAug14\" /> Even so, the popularity of the actors and characters led to discussion of a third film.<ref name=\"VultureAug14\" /> The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate. In a 2009 interview, he said: <blockquote>We did [''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''] and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was&nbsp;... the real thing. And the sequel&nbsp;... They\u2019d written a whole different movie than the one [initially discussed]{{nbsp}}... so there's never been an interest in a third ''Ghostbusters'', because the second one was disappointing&nbsp;... for me, anyway.<ref name=\"FSROCt2008\" /></blockquote> Aykroyd pursued a sequel through to the early 2010s.<ref name=\"VultureAug14\" /> ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' was released in 2009, featuring narrative contributions from Ramis and Aykroyd, and voice acting by Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton. Set two years after ''Ghostbusters II'', the story follows the Ghostbusters training a recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd has referred to the game as being \"essentially the third movie\".<ref name=\"VultureAug14\" /><ref name=\"DOGJun14\" /> ''Ghostbusters: The Return'' (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher went out of business. Several [[Ghostbusters (comics)|''Ghostbusters'' comic books]] have continued the original group's adventures across the globe and other dimensions.<ref name=\"ScreeNRantJul16\" /><ref name=\"THRApr16\" />\n\nFollowing Ramis's death in 2014, Reitman determined the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal to sell the rights to Columbia; he spent two weeks convincing Murray. Reitman refused to detail the deal but said \"the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children's lives\". He and Aykroyd founded [[Ghost Corps]], a production company dedicated to expanding the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot ''Ghostbusters'' (later retitled ''Ghostbusters: Answer the Call'').<ref name=\"EWOCt14\" /><ref name=\"THRFeb14\" /><ref name=\"VultureControl\" /><ref name=\"BBCJan15\" /> Before its release, ''Ghostbusters'' was beset by controversies.
