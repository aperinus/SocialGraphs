The screenplay by Tom Musca, [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez]] and Vera Blasi is based on the film ''[[Eat Drink Man Woman]]'', which was written by [[Hui-Ling Wang]], [[Ang Lee]], and [[James Schamus]].\n\n==Plot==\nSemi-retired [[Mexican-American]] chef Martin Naranjo shares a suburban [[Los Angeles]] home with his three adult daughters. Although he has lost the senses of smell and taste since his wife's death, he still cooks elaborate, multi-course meals for his family and friends. The women humor their father's old-fashioned ways, but each is searching for fulfillment outside the family circle.\n \nLeticia, the oldest and most conservative of the three, is a repressed [[high school]] [[chemistry]] teacher who abandoned [[Catholicism]] to become a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]]. Middle daughter Carmen (Obradors) shares her father's passion for food but has stifled her dream of owning a restaurant in favor of pursuing a more stable career as a business analyst. Maribel, the youngest, is hip and slightly rebellious.\n\nFrequently present in the Naranjo home are newly divorced family friend Yolanda, her young daughter April, and her visiting mother Hortensia, who has set her sights on Martin and is determined to make him her next husband, unaware his attention is focused on someone else.\n\nMaribel is drawn to handsome [[Brazil]]ian student, Andy, after her co-worker rejects him and, after they briefly date, she invites him home for dinner, during which she blithely announces she is moving in with him, much to her father's consternation and Andy's shock, since they never had discussed elevating their somewhat casual relationship to this next level. Before long, she is rearranging his small apartment and unintentionally making him increasingly uncomfortable as she imposes herself in his life.\n\nMeanwhile, Leticia finds herself attracted to Orlando Castillo, who coaches baseball at her school, when she begins to receive passionate love letters she believes are from him, unaware they actually were written by her students. Carmen is offered a high-profile job in [[Barcelona]], and half-heartedly agrees to accept it, although soon after her father drives her to the airport she returns home, determined to follow in her father's footsteps and open a restaurant of her own.\n\nLeticia and Orlando elope, Maribel and Andy break up and reunite, Martin marries Yolanda, and everyone gathers for a family meal at Carmen's new restaurant. It is, however, apparent that this family bonds over their love of food.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Martin Naranjo\n* [[Jacqueline Obradors]] as Carmen Naranjo\n* [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Leticia Naranjo\n* [[Tamara Mello]] as Maribel Naranjo\n* [[Raquel Welch]] as Hortensia\n* [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] as Orlando Castillo\n* [[Constance Marie]] as Yolanda\n* Marisabel Garc\u00eda as April\n* [[Nikolai Kinski]] as Andy\n* [[Julio Oscar Mechoso]] as Gomez\n* [[Jude Herrera]] as Eden\n* [[Ken Marino]] as Jeff\n* Troy Ruptash as Hairdresser\n* Louis Crugnali as Catering Assistant\n* [[Joel Joan]] as Antonio Urgell\n* [[Ulysses Cuadra|Ulises Cuadra]] as Snide Student (as Ulysses Cuadra) \n* Mark de la Cruz as April's Classmate\n* Eli Russell Linnetz as April's Classmate\n* Stoney Westmoreland as Baseball Umpire\n* [[Karen Dyer]] as Rachel\n* Anthony C Sena as Chef/Wait Staff\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in El Segundo, California, USA and Los Angeles, California, USA. \n \nThe meals featured in the film were prepared by celebrity chefs [[Mary Sue Milliken]] and [[Susan Feniger]] who, as hosts of the [[Food Network]] program ''Too Hot Tamales'', introduced viewers to their contemporary take on traditional Mexican cuisine.

But the movie is cast so well that the actors bring life to their predictable destinies, and Elizondo casts a kind of magical warm spell over them all.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=August 24, 2001 |last= Ebert |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |title= Tortilla Soup Movie Review & Film Summary (2001) |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tortilla-soup-2001 |website=RogerEbert.com |publisher= Chicago-Sun Times }}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nElizabeth Pe\u00f1a tied with [[Elpidia Carrillo]] in ''[[Bread and Roses (2000 film)|Bread and Roses]]'' for the [[ALMA Award]] for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture, and the film tied with ''Bread and Roses'' for the [[Imagen Foundation]] Award for Best Feature Film.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Home media==\nThe film was released on DVD on January 15, 2002.
