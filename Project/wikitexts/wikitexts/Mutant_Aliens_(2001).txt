Years later, he returns to Earth. To gain the people's trust, he tells a touching story of the time he has spent on a planet of [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s. Most of the aliens in this story are oversized human body parts. It is later revealed that Jensen has really spent his time in space crossbreeding animals to create an army of mutants, in order to exact his revenge on the corrupt Department of Space head.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|0277909}}\n\n{{Bill Plympton}}\n\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:American adult animated films]]\n[[Category:American animated science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:Films about astronauts]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bill Plympton]]\n[[Category:American animated feature films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:Annecy Cristal for a Feature Film winners]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n\n\n{{animation-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
