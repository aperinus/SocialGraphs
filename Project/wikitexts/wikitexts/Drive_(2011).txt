The screenplay, written by [[Hossein Amini]], is based on [[James Sallis]]'s [[Drive (novel)|2005 novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Ryan Gosling]] as an unnamed [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[stunt performer|stunt driver]] who moonlights as a [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]]. He quickly grows fond of his neighbor, Irene ([[Carey Mulligan]]), and her young son, Benicio. When her debt-ridden husband, Standard ([[Oscar Isaac]]), is released from prison, the two men take part in what turns out to be a botched million-dollar heist that endangers the lives of everyone involved. The film co-stars [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Christina Hendricks]], [[Ron Perlman]], and [[Albert Brooks]].\n\nProducers [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]] and Adam Siegel [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the source novel after Siegel read a review from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. Adapting the book proved to be challenging for Amini, as it had a [[nonlinear narrative]]. Gosling, one of Platt's top casting choices, eventually signed on for the lead, as he wanted to star in an [[action film|action-oriented]] project. Gosling played a pivotal role in the film's production, which included hiring Refn as director and Beth Mickle as [[production designer]]. [[Newton Thomas Sigel]] oversaw the [[principal photography]], which started on September 25, 2010, was shot on location in various parts of [[Los Angeles]], and ended on November 12.\n\nBefore its September 2011 release, ''Drive'' had been shown at a number of film festivals, including the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]], where it received a [[standing ovation]]. Refn won the festival's [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]]. The film was praised for its direction, cinematography, performances (particularly Gosling and Brooks'), visuals, action sequences, and musical score; however, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence and found that potentially detrimental to the film's box office success. Nonetheless, the film was still a commercial success, grossing $81 million against a production budget of $15 million. Several critics listed ''Drive'' as one of the best films of 2011, including the [[National Board of Review Awards 2011|National Board of Review]]. Its [[list of accolades received by Drive (2011 film)|honors]] include a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]]. In the years following its release, it has gained notoriety in the internet film community and became known as a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAn unnamed man, known as \"Driver\", works as a mechanic, a stunt double, a stunt driver, and a criminal-for-hire getaway car driver in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. His jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish mobster]] Bernie Rose and his half-Italian partner Nino \"Izzy\" Paolozzi to purchase a car for the Driver to race. The Driver meets his new neighbor, Irene, and grows close to her and her young son, Benicio. Their relationship is interrupted when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, arrives after his release from prison. Standard owes [[protection money]] from his time in prison and is assaulted by [[Albanian mafia|Albanian gangster]] Chris Cook, who demands that Standard rob a [[pawn shop]] for $40,000 to pay off the debt. Learning this, the Driver offers to act as the getaway driver for the pawn shop robbery.\n\nWhile the Driver is waiting outside the pawn shop with Blanche, Cook's accomplice, the store owner kills Standard. The Driver and Blanche are then pursued by another car. The Driver hides with Blanche in a [[motel]] where he learns that the pawn shop owner claims Standard was the sole perpetrator and no money was stolen. He threatens Blanche when she lies about being oblivious to the second car. She admits that the bag contains $1 million, and she and Cook planned to re-steal the money for themselves using the car that chased them. While Blanche is in the restroom, she is killed with a [[shotgun]] by one of Cook's henchmen. The Driver fatally stabs the gunman before killing another one with the shotgun.\n\nAt the auto shop, Shannon offers to hide the money, but the Driver declines. He tracks Cook to a [[strip club]] and threatens to kill him. Cook reveals that Nino was behind the robbery. The Driver calls him, and Nino dismisses his offer of the money, instead sending a [[hitman]] to the Driver and Irene's apartment building. The Driver tells an angry Irene about his involvement with her husband's death. When the pair enter an elevator, the Driver notices the hitman. He kisses Irene and then brutally stomps the hitman to death, horrifying Irene. Knowing that someone may have leaked the Driver's whereabouts for Nino to know his address, the Driver confronts Shannon, who reveals that he also unwittingly mentioned Irene. Driver tells Shannon to flee.\n\nAt his pizzeria, Nino reveals to Bernie that a low-level [[Philadelphia crime family|Philadelphia mobster]] from the Italian \"[[American Mafia|East Coast mob]]\" stashed the money at the pawn shop with plans to use the money to set up a new operation. Since anyone tied to the robbery could lead the East Coast Italian Mafia to them, they need to kill everyone involved. He convinces Bernie to follow his plan. Bernie murders Cook, as he is the sole witness to their agreement. After Shannon refuses to divulge the whereabouts of the Driver at the auto shop, Bernie slashes his forearm with a [[straight razor]], killing him.\n\nEnraged and agonized at finding Shannon's corpse at the auto shop, the Driver disguises himself with a rubber stuntman's mask, follows Nino from the pizzeria to the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]] and rams his car onto a beach. The Driver chases Nino towards the ocean and drowns him. He calls Irene and tells her that he will not return, also letting her know that she and Benicio were the best part of his life. The Driver meets Bernie, who promises that Irene will be safe in exchange for the money. Upon giving him the money, Bernie stabs him in the stomach before the Driver pulls out his own knife and stabs Bernie to death. The Driver manages to escape, while Bernie's corpse lies in the parking lot next to the cash. Irene knocks on the Driver's apartment door and walks away when no one answers. Although severely wounded, the Driver drives into the night.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as the Driver\n* [[Carey Mulligan]] as Irene Gabriel\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Shannon\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Bernie Rose\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as Standard Gabriel\n* [[Christina Hendricks]] as Blanche\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Nino 'Izzy' Paolozzi\n* Kaden Leos as Benicio Gabriel\n* [[James Biberi]] as Chris Cook\n* Jeff Wolfe as Assassin In The Tan Suit\n* [[Russ Tamblyn]] as Doc\n* Andy San Dimas as Dancer\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box\n| width = 25%\n| quote = I was very taken with this little crime story that James Sallis wrote.

He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the adaptation challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it \"a very tricky structure\" for a feature film.<ref name=\"DrivePresstKit8\">{{cite news|title=Drive Press Kit: The Adaption|work=[[FilmDistrict]]|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nA film adaptation of ''Drive'' was first announced in early 2008, with [[Neil Marshall]] set to direct what was being described as \"an L.A.-set action mystery\", planned as a starring vehicle for [[Hugh Jackman]].

Platt contacted actor [[Ryan Gosling]] about ''Drive'' early on. Platt explained: \"I have this list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me {{ndash}} writers, directors, actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life.\" Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like ''Drive''. He had always been interested in doing an [[Action film|action-oriented]] project. Gosling said that he had been put off by the many current action genre films that focused more on stunts instead of characters. But he responded to Platt about two days later, as he was strongly attracted to the plot and the leading role of the unnamed driver. He thought the story had a \"very strong character\" at its core, and a \"powerful\" romance.<ref name=\"DrivePresstKit\">{{cite news|title=Drive Press Kit: Ryan Gosling Climbs Aboard|work=[[FilmDistrict]]|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with [[Rotten Tomatoes]], Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the earlier script when Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He said:\n<blockquote>I think that might be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft {{ndash}} maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in trying to figure out who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film.

Knowing Cranston had other opportunities, Refn asked the actor how he would like to develop the role.

When Refn suggested him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor might not want to play a character who is violent and sullen, or appear in a film that he did not work on himself.<ref name=\"DrivePressKit4\" /> Brooks accepted the role to go against [[typecasting (acting)|type]], and because he loved that Bernie was not a clich\u00e9.\n\n<blockquote>There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box.

Refn said, \"The character of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am \u2013 a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me.\"<ref name=\"DrivePressKit4\" /> [[Oscar Isaac]] portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. Finding the role somewhat unappealing, he developed the [[archetypal]] character into something more.\n\nHe said of the role:\n<blockquote>As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.<ref name=\"DrivePressKit4\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Filming and cinematography===\nThe film was made on a [[production budget]] of about $15&nbsp;million and shot in various parts of Los Angeles, beginning on September 25, 2010.<ref name=\"NYInfo\" /><ref name=\"Deadline1\" /> Locations were picked by Refn while Gosling drove him around the city at night.

With two different set-ups prepared in the car, the director found it difficult to have mobility with the camera, so he would switch the camera to two additional set-ups nearby.

On ''Drive'', it was hard for me to wrap my head around it. I realized I needed to show in one situation that Driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence.
