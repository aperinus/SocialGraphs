[[Los Angeles Times]].</ref>  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Frank Lloyd]] and starring [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Clark Gable]], based on the 1932 [[Charles Nordhoff]] and [[James Norman Hall]] novel ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (novel)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''.\n\nDespite historical inaccuracies, the film was a huge box office success, becoming [[1935 in film|the highest-grossing film of 1935]] and one of MGM's biggest hits of the 1930s. The film received a leading eight nominations at the [[8th Academy Awards]], winning only [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nOne night in [[Portsmouth, England]], in 1787, a [[Impressment|press gang]] breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service.  One of the men enquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is {{HMS|Bounty}}. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another man is told the captain is [[William Bligh]] ([[Charles Laughton]]) and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or defy his authority in any manner.\n\nThe ''Bounty'' leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. [[Fletcher Christian]] ([[Clark Gable]]), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam ([[Franchot Tone]]) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian.\n\nDuring the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of [[Tahiti]], where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay.\n\nByam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island and lives with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani ([[Movita Castaneda]]), and he compiles an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees, but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti ([[Mamo Clark]]). Christian promises her he will be back someday.\n\nAfter leaving Tahiti, the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr.&nbsp;Bacchus ([[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]]), and Bligh severely cuts water rationing to the crew in favor of providing more water for the breadfruit plants.\n\nChristian, although initially opposing the idea, decides he can no longer tolerate Bligh's brutality when he witnesses crew members shackled in iron chains, and he approves the mutiny. The crew raids the weapons cabinet and seizes the ship. Bligh and his loyalists are cast into a boat and set adrift at sea with a map and rations to ensure their survival. Due to Bligh's steady leadership, they are able to find their way back to land.\n\nMeanwhile, Christian orders that ''Bounty'' return to Tahiti. Byam, who was in his cabin during the mutiny, disapproves of what Christian has done and decides the two can no longer be friends.\n\nMonths later, Byam is married to Tehani, and Christian has married Maimiti and has a child with her, while the rest of the crew are enjoying their freedom on the island. After a long estrangement, Byam and Christian reconcile their friendship. However, when the British ship [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']] is spotted approaching, Byam and Christian decide they must part ways. Byam and several crew members remain on the island for the ship to take them back to England, while Christian leads the remaining crew, his wife, and several Tahitian men and women back on board ''Bounty'' in search of a new island on which to seek refuge.\n\nByam boards ''Pandora'' and, much to his surprise, discovers that Bligh is the captain. Bligh, who suspects that Byam was complicit in the mutiny, has him imprisoned for the remainder of the journey across the sea.\n\nBack in England, Byam is court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny. Before the court condemns him, Byam speaks of Bligh's cruel, dehumanising conduct aboard ''Bounty''. Due to the intervention of his friend Sir Joseph Banks ([[Henry Stephenson]]) and Lord Hood ([[David Torrence (actor)|David Torrence]]), Byam is pardoned by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and allowed to resume his naval career at sea.\n\nMeanwhile, Christian has found Pitcairn, an uninhabited yet sustainable island that he believes will provide adequate refuge from the reach of the Royal Navy. After ''Bounty'' crashes on the rocks, Christian orders her to be burned.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as [[William Bligh|Captain Bligh]]\n* [[Clark Gable]] as [[Fletcher Christian]]\n* [[Franchot Tone]] as Byam\n* [[Herbert Mundin]] as [[John Adams (mutineer)|Smith]]\n* [[Eddie Quillan]] as [[Thomas Ellison (mutineer)|Ellison]]\n* [[Dudley Digges (actor)|Dudley Digges]] as Bacchus\n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Burkitt\n* [[Henry Stephenson]] as [[Sir Joseph Banks]]\n* [[Francis Lister]] as Capt.

[[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[William Bligh|Bligh]] was never on board {{HMS|Pandora|1779|6}}, nor was he present at the trial of the mutineers who stayed on [[Tahiti]].\n\nAt the time, he was halfway around the world on a second voyage for [[breadfruit]] plants. [[Fletcher Christian]]'s father had died many years before Christian's travels on board ''Bounty'', whereas the film shows the elder Christian at the trial. The movie was always presented as an adaptation of the Nordhoff and Hall trilogy, which already differed from the actual story of the mutiny.\n\nBligh is initially depicted as a brutal, sadistic disciplinarian, only becoming more sympathetic during the voyage to Timor. Particular episodes include a [[keelhauling]] and flogging a dead man. Neither of these happened. Keelhauling was used rarely, if at all, and had been abandoned long before Bligh's time. Indeed, the meticulous record of ''Bounty''{{'}}s log reveals that the flogging rate was lower than the average for that time.<ref>{{cite web |title=MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY |url=https://www.movieguide.org/reviews/movies/mutiny-on-the-bounty.html |website=movieguide.org |publisher=Movieguide |access-date=23 October 2022}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the mutiny, ''Bounty'' had only two deaths. One seaman, James Valentine, died of an ill-defined respiratory illness; logs indicate he was \"seized with a violent hollow Cough and spit much.\" And the ship's surgeon, Thomas Huggan, apparently died of complications due to his chronic alcoholism, not as a result of abuse by Bligh. In fact, Bligh had threatened to seize and impound Huggan's alcohol stocks on account of him regularly being intoxicated while on duty, a threat Bligh eventually carried out. Huggan's constant drunkenness left Bligh little choice but to oversee key health issues himself. Notably, the crew had been examined constantly for scurvy, and Bligh \u2013 his expertise in this matter developed under Captain James Cook \u2013 had detected no verified signs of the illness at any time.\n\nLikewise, the film shows the mutineers taking over the ship only after killing several loyal crewmen, when in fact none died (although one crewman came very close to shooting Bligh until stopped by Christian). Lastly, Christian is shown being inspired to take over the ship after several crewmen have unjustly been put into irons by Bligh; this is fictional.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}\n\nIn the final scene of the film, Christian gives a rousing speech to his fellow mutineers, speaking of creating a perfect society of free men on [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]], away from Bligh and the navy. The reality was very different as mutineers enslaved Tahitian men.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchanan |first1=Kelly |title=Mutiny and Other Crimes: Another Tale from the South Seas (Part 1) |url=https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/04/mutiny-and-other-crimes-part-1/ |website=loc.gov |publisher=The Library of Congress |access-date=23 October 2022}}</ref>\n\nFor historical accuracy, [[Clark Gable]] reluctantly had to shave off his [[moustache]] because the sailors in the [[Royal Navy]] in the 18th century had to be clean-shaven. Midshipman Roger Byam was based on a real person, Midshipman [[Peter Heywood]], who is not listed in the novel or motion picture. Just as the fictional Byam is pardoned at the end of the film, the real-life Peter Heywood was pardoned for his part in the mutiny. MGM trailers in 1935 made an error calling Midshipman Byam an ensign.\n\nMutineer [[Thomas Ellison (mutineer)|Thomas Ellison]] is depicted as being allowed to see his wife before his execution. There is no record to indicate that the real Ellison was married, and in any case, a consolation visit of this type never would have been permitted in real life.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming locations===\n[[File:Clark gable mutiny bounty 6.jpg|thumb|[[Clark Gable]] as [[Fletcher Christian]]]]\n* [[French Polynesia]]\n* Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios \u2013 10202 W.

Cagney is clearly visible toward the beginning of the film. He was sailing his boat near where the film was shooting near Catalina Island; director Frank Lloyd was an old friend of his, and Cagney asked him if he could play a small part in the film, saying, jokingly, \"I need the money\". Lloyd had Cagney dressed in a crewman's clothes and put him in the background of a few scenes.\n\nCharles Laughton, who had a severe self-image complex concerning his weight and unattractive looks, suffered horribly in comparing himself to the handsome, masculine Clark Gable.<ref name=\"HG:CL\">{{Cite episode |title=Charles Laughton |series=Hollywood Greats|airdate=August 31, 1978|series-no=2|number=5 |minutes=12\u201313}}</ref> Laughton would constantly watch his own walk, gestures, and face, making sure not to let his complex be projected.<ref name=\"HG:CL\"/>\n\n===Ship===\nA British merchant navy officer<ref>Le Page, Peter \"A working lifetime\" (1991)</ref> recalled in his memoirs seeing the fore and aft-rigged schooner ''Commodore II'' being broken up in [[Cape Town]] in 1945, having suffered severe gale damage, and that this was the ship that had been re-rigged for the film.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Poster - Mutiny on the Bounty (1935).jpg|thumb|Advertorial poster]]\n\nContemporary reviews were enthusiastic.

It would be based on a novel by Charles Nordhoff about Christian's romantic adventures in England and South America following the colonization of [[Pitcairn Island]] and would be produced by [[Carey Wilson (writer)|Carey Wilson]].<ref>{{cite news|title=NEWS OF THE SCREEN: M-G-M to Make 'Christian of Bounty,' With Gable-- 'Southerner' Premiere Again Postponed Of Local Origin|work=New York Times|date=August 14, 1945|page=17}}</ref> It was never made.\n\n== Other film versions ==\nA 1962 three-hour-plus [[widescreen]] [[Technicolor]] [[Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)|remake]], starring [[Marlon Brando]] as Fletcher Christian and [[Trevor Howard]] as Capt. Bligh, was a disaster both critically and financially at the time. Nonetheless, the remake was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nIn 1984, [[Mel Gibson]] played Christian opposite [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Bligh in a film (based not upon the Nordhoff-Hall novels but on an historical work by [[Richard Hough]]) called ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]''. This latest version, which gives a far more sympathetic view of Bligh, is considered to be the closest to historical events.\n\nThe 1935 version was itself not the first film account of the mutiny. In 1933 an Australian film entitled ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', with the then-unknown [[Errol Flynn]] as Fletcher Christian, was released, but was not successful and received few bookings outside Australia. Flynn noted in his autobiography that whenever he mentioned that he'd played Christian in an Australian version of ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' two years before Gable, no one ever believed him. There was also an even earlier film, the 1916 Australian\u2013New Zealand film, ''[[The Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' directed by [[Raymond Longford]].\n\n==Parodies==\n* [[Friz Freleng]]'s cartoon ''[[Mutiny on the Bunny]]'' casts [[Yosemite Sam]] (called Shanghai Sam) as a foul-tempered skipper who shanghais [[Bugs Bunny]], only to see Bugs rebel. Also, in one scene in Freleng's earlier ''[[Buccaneer Bunny]]'', Bugs dresses up as Capt. Bligh (including a visual and vocal impression of [[Charles Laughton]]) and barks out orders to Sam (called Seagoin' Sam).\n* The 1967 ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode \"[[List of Lost in Space episodes|Mutiny in Space]]\" features [[Ronald Long]] imitating Charles Laughton in the role of spaceship captain \"Admiral Zahrk.\" \n* [[Morecambe and Wise]] performed a sketch with [[Arthur Lowe]] (who played [[Captain Mainwaring]] in ''[[Dad's Army]]'') as Captain Bligh. At the end of the sketch it is announced Bligh has some loyal crewmen who turn out to be other cast members of ''Dad's Army''. \n* \"Holidays at Home\", a 1978 episode of ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'', includes a dream sequence where the sitcom's cast enact scenes from the film.\n* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[The Wettest Stories Ever Told]]\" features the family telling stories set on ships. The second segment is a parody on ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' and casts [[Principal Skinner]] as Capt. Bligh, brutalizing the crew members (played by Bart, Milhouse, Martin, Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|0026752|Mutiny on the Bounty (1935)}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=15288|title=Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n* {{allmovie|33980|Synopsis}}\n* {{AFI film|id=7072|title=Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=1014481-mutiny_on_the_bounty|title=Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n* [http://southseascinema.org/index.html Southseascinema.org]\n* [http://www.virtual-history.com/movie/film/1124/mutiny-on-the-bounty ''Mutiny on the Bounty''] at Virtual History\n\n{{Mutiny on the Bounty}}\n{{Frank Lloyd}}\n{{Irving Thalberg}}\n{{AcademyAwardBestPicture 1927-1940}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mutiny On The Bounty (1935 Film)}}\n[[Category:1935 films]]\n[[Category:American historical films]]\n[[Category:Best Picture Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:1930s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:1930s historical films]]\n[[Category:American adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:American epic films]]\n[[Category:Military courtroom films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:1930s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about HMS Bounty]]\n[[Category:Films about capital punishment]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Frank Lloyd]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Irving Thalberg]]\n[[Category:Films shot in French Polynesia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jules Furthman]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Herbert Stothart]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Seafaring films]]\n[[Category:Films set on ships]]\n[[Category:Films about the Royal Navy]]\n[[Category:1930s American films]]"}]}}}}
