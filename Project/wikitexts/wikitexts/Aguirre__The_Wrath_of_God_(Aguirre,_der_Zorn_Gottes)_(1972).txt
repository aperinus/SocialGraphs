[[Klaus Kinski]] stars in the title role of Spanish soldier [[Lope de Aguirre]], who leads a group of [[conquistador]]es down the [[Amazon River]] in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, [[El Dorado (legend)|El Dorado]]. The [[soundtrack]] was composed and performed by [[kosmische musik|kosmische]] band [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]].\n\nUsing a [[minimalism|minimalist]] approach to story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although loosely based on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release that its storyline is a work of fiction. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by [[Gaspar de Carvajal]]'s account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film.\n\n''Aguirre'' was the first of five collaborations between Herzog and Kinski. They had differing views as to how the role should be played, and they clashed throughout filming; Kinski's rages terrorized both the crew and the locals who were assisting the production. Shooting was entirely on location, and was fraught with difficulties. Filming took place in the [[Peru]]vian [[rainforest]] on the Amazon River during an arduous five-week period, shooting on [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Ucayali region]]. The cast and crew climbed mountains, cut through heavy vines to open routes to the various jungle locations, and rode treacherous river rapids on rafts built by local craftworkers.\n\n''Aguirre'' opened to widespread critical acclaim, and quickly developed a large international [[cult film]] following. It was given an extensive [[art film|arthouse]] theatrical release in the United States in 1977, and remains one of the director's best-known films. Several critics have declared the film a masterpiece, and it has appeared on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of \"All Time 100 Best Films\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1560, several scores of [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, and a hundred [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] slaves, march down from the newly conquered [[Inca Empire]] in the [[Andes]] mountains into the jungles to the east, in search of the fabled country of [[El Dorado]]. Under the command of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], the men, clad in half [[personal armor|armor]], pull cannons down narrow mountain paths and through dense, muddy jungle. On [[New Year's Eve]], reaching the end of his supplies and unable to go on without more information, Pizarro orders a group of forty men to scout ahead by raft down river. If they do not return to the main party within one week with news of what lies beyond, they will be considered lost. Pizarro chooses Don [[Pedro de Urs\u00faa]] as the commander of the expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre as his [[second-in-command]], fat nobleman Don Fernando de Guzm\u00e1n to represent the [[Habsburg Spain|Royal House of Spain]], and Brother [[Gaspar de Carvajal]] to bring the word of God. Also accompanying the expedition, against Pizarro's better judgment, are Urs\u00faa's mistress, Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s and Aguirre's teenage daughter, Flores.\n\nTraveling through rapids, one of the four rafts gets caught in an [[Whitewater#Eddies|eddy]], and the others are unable to help free it. That night, gunfire erupts on the trapped raft; in the morning the men on board are found dead, with three missing. Urs\u00faa wants the bodies to be brought back to camp for proper burial. Knowing this would slow down the expedition, Aguirre suggests that Perucho fire the cannon to clean the rust from it. He fires at the raft, destroying it and throwing the bodies into the river.\n\nDuring the night, the remaining rafts are swept away by the rising river. Time has run out for the scouting mission, and Urs\u00faa decides to return to Pizarro's group despite the danger from hostile Indians. Aguirre leads a [[mutiny]] against Urs\u00faa, telling the men that untold riches await them ahead, and reminding them that [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] won an empire in [[Mexico]] by disobeying orders. Urs\u00faa orders Aguirre arrested, but he and a soldier loyal to him are shot. Aguirre nominates Guzm\u00e1n as the new leader of the expedition and rebels against the Spanish Crown, proclaiming Guzm\u00e1n the emperor of El Dorado. A farcical trial of Urs\u00faa results in his being sentenced to death, but Guzm\u00e1n surprises Aguirre by granting Urs\u00faa clemency.\n\nAguirre remains the true leader of the mutiny, so oppressive and terrifying that few protest his leadership. Only In\u00e9s has the courage to speak out against him. Knowing that some of the soldiers are still loyal to Urs\u00faa, Aguirre simply ignores her.\n\nThe expedition continues on a single, newly built, large raft. An indigenous couple approaching peacefully by canoe are captured by the explorers, and when the man expresses confusion when presented with a Bible, Brother Carvajal kills them for [[blasphemy]]. Guzm\u00e1n dines on the low food supplies while the men starve, and has the expedition's only remaining horse pushed off the raft because it annoys him. Soon afterwards he is found dead near the raft's [[outhouse|privy]]. After Guzm\u00e1n's death, Aguirre proclaims himself leader. Urs\u00faa is then taken ashore and hanged in the jungle. The group attacks an indigenous village, where several soldiers are killed by spears and arrows. The distraught In\u00e9s walks into the jungle and disappears.\n\nOn the raft again, the group of slowly starving, feverish men begin disbelieving everything they see, even when shot with arrows. The group stares in disbelief at a [[sailing ship|wooden ship]] perched in the highest branches of a tall tree, which Aguirre orders be brought down and refurbished, but Brother Carvajal refuses. In a series of final attacks by unseen assailants, the remaining survivors including Aguirre's daughter are killed by arrows. Monkeys overrun the raft as Aguirre imagines conquering all of America and founding an incestuous dynasty to rule over it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Klaus Kinski]] as [[Lope de Aguirre]]\n* [[Helena Rojo]] as In\u00e9s de Atienza\n* [[Ruy Guerra]] as Don [[Pedro de Urs\u00faa]]\n* [[Del Negro (actor)|Del Negro]] as Brother [[Gaspar de Carvajal]]\n* [[Peter Berling]] as Don Fernando de Guzm\u00e1n\n* Cecilia Rivera as Flores de Aguirre\n* Daniel Ades as Perucho\n* Edward Roland as Okello\n* Armando Polanah as Armando\n* Alejandro Repull\u00e9s as [[Gonzalo Pizarro]]\n* Justo Gonz\u00e1lez as Gonz\u00e1lez\n* Alexandra Cheves\n* Daniel Farf\u00e1n\n* Julio E. Mart\u00ednez\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe idea for the film began when Herzog borrowed a book on historical adventurers from a friend. After reading a half-page devoted to Lope de Aguirre, the filmmaker became inspired and immediately devised the story. He fabricated most of the plot details and characters, although he did use some historical figures in purely fictitious ways.<ref name=\"Herzog\">Herzog, Werner. ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God'' [[DVD]], [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]], 2001, [[audio commentary]]. {{OCLC|228418112}}</ref>\n\n===Screenplay===\nHerzog wrote the screenplay \"in a frenzy\", and completed it in two-and-a-half days. Much of the script was written during a {{convert|200|mi|km|adj=on}} bus trip with Herzog's football team. His teammates got drunk after winning a game and one vomited on several pages of Herzog's manuscript, which he immediately threw out the window. Herzog claims he cannot remember all of what he wrote on these pages.<ref name=\"Herzog\" />\n\nThe screenplay was mostly shot as written, with only minor differences. In an early scene in which Pizarro instructs Urs\u00faa to lead the scouting team down the river, in the script, Pizarro mentions that in the course of the expedition Urs\u00faa could possibly discover what happened to [[Francisco de Orellana]]'s expedition, which had vanished without a trace years before (see \"Historical Accuracy\" section). Later in the screenplay, Aguirre and his men find a boat and the long-dead remains of Orellana's soldiers. Further down the river, they discover another ship lodged in some tree tops. In the screenplay, Aguirre and others explore the boat but find no sign of Orellana or his men. Herzog ultimately eliminated any such references to Orellana's expedition from the film. The sequence with the boat caught in the upper branches of a tree remains, but as filmed it seems to be simply a hallucinatory vision.<ref name=\"Fritze\">Fritze, Ronald. \"Werner Herzog's Adaptation of History in Aguirre, The Wrath of God\", from ''Film and History'', Issue 15:4, pgs. 74\u201386.</ref>\n\nThe finale is significantly different from Herzog's original script. The director recalled, \"I only remember that the end of the film was totally different. The end was actually the raft going out into the open ocean and being swept back inland, because for many miles you have a counter-current, the Amazon actually goes backwards. And it was tossed to and fro. And a parrot would scream: 'El Dorado, El Dorado{{'\"}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/werner_herzog.html|title=The Trail of Werner Herzog: An Interview|access-date=2007-05-08|first=Werner|last=Herzog|publisher=Off Screen}}</ref> (This ending was eventually used for [[Cobra Verde]].)\n\n===Herzog and Kinski===\nHerzog's first choice for the role of Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog's family apartment, and Kinski's often terrifying and deranged antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. \"Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang\", Herzog recalled. \"It took me at least a couple of minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,676082,00.html|title=The Enigma of Werner H|access-date=<!----2007-08-22---->|date=20 March 2002|first=John|last=O'Mahony|work=The Guardian |location=London}}</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the production, Herzog and Kinski argued about the proper manner to portray Aguirre. Kinski wanted to play a \"wild, ranting madman\", but Herzog wanted something \"quieter, more menacing\". In order to get the performance he desired, before each shot Herzog would deliberately infuriate Kinski. After waiting for the hot-tempered actor's anger to \"burn itself out\", Herzog would then roll the camera.<ref name=\"Knipfel\">[[Jim Knipfel|Knipfel, Jim]]. ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God'' DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001, [[liner notes]].</ref>\n\nOn one occasion, irritated by the noise from a hut where cast and crew were playing cards, the explosive Kinski fired three [[gunshots]] at it, blowing the tip off one extra's finger.<ref name=\"Herzog\" /> Subsequently, Kinski decided to leave the jungle location (over Herzog's refusal to fire a sound assistant), only changing his mind after Herzog threatened to shoot first Kinski and then himself. The latter incident has given rise to the legend that Herzog made Kinski act for him at gunpoint. However, Herzog has repeatedly denied the claim during interviews, saying he only verbally threatened Kinski in the heat of the moment, in a desperate attempt to keep him from leaving the set.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/04-27-98/slc_ae.html |date=April 27, 1998|title=Hauntingly Herzog |access-date=<!----2007-05-08----> |first=Mary|last=Dickson |work=City Weekly |location=Salt Lake City}}</ref> The incident is parodied in ''[[Incident at Loch Ness]]'', which Herzog co-wrote.<ref>{{cite news|date=March 21, 2009|url=http://moria.co.nz/sciencefiction/incidentatlochness.htm|title=Incident at Loch Ness|access-date=September 7, 2009|first=Richard|last=Scheib|work=Moria, The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312051754/http://moria.co.nz/sciencefiction/incidentatlochness.htm|archive-date=12 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was made for [[United States dollar|US$]]370,000, with one-third of the budget paying for Kinski's salary.<ref name=\"Herzog1\">Herzog, Werner. ''Herzog on Herzog'', edited by Paul Cronin, Faber & Faber, 2003. {{ISBN|0-571-20708-1}}</ref> It was filmed on location in the [[Peru]]vian [[rainforest]], [[Machu Picchu]] (the stone steps of [[Huayna Picchu]]),<ref name=\"Herzog1\" /> and on the [[Amazon River]] [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Ucayali region]]. ''Aguirre'' was shot in five weeks, following nine months of pre-production planning.<ref name=\"Herzog\" /> The film was shot in chronological order, because Herzog believed the film crew's progress on the river directly mirrored that of the explorers' journey in the story. The director and his cast and crew floated in rafts down the [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]] and [[Nanay River|Nanay]] rivers through the [[Urubamba Valley]] in Peru.<ref name=\"Herzog1\" />\n\nAll of the actors spoke their dialogue in English. The members of the cast and crew came from sixteen countries, and English was the only common language among them. In addition, Herzog felt that shooting ''Aguirre'' in English would improve the film's chances for international distribution. However, the small amount of money that had been set aside for post-synchronization \"left Peru with the man in charge of the process; both absconded ''en route''\".  The English-language track was ultimately replaced by a higher-quality [[German language]] version, which was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|post-synched]] after production was completed.<ref name=\"Overbey\" /> Herzog claims that Kinski requested too much money for the dubbing session, and so his lines were performed by another actor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050828/PEOPLE/50828001|title=A conversation with Werner Herzog|access-date=19 June 2007 |first=Roger|last=Ebert|publisher=rogerebert.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910065548/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050828/PEOPLE/50828001 |archive-date=10 September 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe [[low budget]] precluded the use of stunt men or elaborate [[special effects]]. Cinematography in many scenes was done in order to accommodate the inclement weather and terrain of the region, with the camera lens often being obscured by rainwater and mud when the cast moved through thicker regions of the jungle. The cast and crew climbed up mountains, experienced the adverse conditions of the jungle, and rode ferocious Amazonian river rapids on rafts built by locals. At one point, a storm caused a river to flood, covering the film sets in several feet of water and destroying all the rafts built for the film. This flooding was immediately incorporated into the story, as a sequence including a flood and subsequent rebuilding of rafts was shot.<ref name=\"Herzog\" />\n\nThe camera used to shoot the film was stolen by Herzog from the [[University of Television and Film Munich|Munich Film School]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/12/0081313\n| title=The Secret Mainstream: Contemplating the mirages of Werner Herzog|date = December 2006|access-date=<!----2007-05-08----> |first=Tom|last=Bissell|work=[[Harper's Magazine]]}}</ref> Years later, Herzog recalled:\n\n<blockquote>It was a very simple [[35mm movie film|35mm]] camera, one I used on many other films, so I do not consider it a theft. For me, it was truly a necessity. I wanted to make films and needed a camera. I had some sort of natural right to this tool. If you need air to breathe, and you are locked in a room, you have to take a chisel and hammer and break down a wall. It is your absolute right.<ref name=\"Herzog1\" /></blockquote>\n\nTo obtain the monkeys used in the climactic sequence, Herzog paid several locals to trap 400 monkeys; he paid them half in advance and was to pay the other half upon receipt. The trappers sold the monkeys to someone in Los Angeles or Miami, and Herzog came to the airport just as the monkeys were being loaded to be shipped out of the country. He pretended to be a veterinarian and claimed that the monkeys needed vaccinations before leaving the country. Abashed, the handlers handed the monkeys over to  Herzog, who used them in the shot they were required for, then released them afterwards into the jungle.<ref name=\"Herzog\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Aguirre (soundtrack)}}\n''Aguirre''{{'s}} [[film score|musical score]] was performed by [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]], a West German [[progressive rock|progressive]]/[[Krautrock]] band.

It has inside it three dozen different tapes running parallel to each other in loops.&nbsp;... All these tapes are running at the same time, and there is a keyboard on which you can play them like an organ so that [it will] sound just like a human choir but yet, at the same time, very artificial and really quite eerie.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\" />\n\nIn 1975 Popol Vuh released an album entitled [[Aguirre (soundtrack)|''Aguirre'']]. Although ostensibly a [[soundtrack album]] to Herzog's film, the six-track [[LP album|LP]] included only two songs (\"Aguirre I (L'Acrime Di Rei)\" and \"Aguirre II\") taken from ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God''. The four remaining tracks were derived from various recordings made by the group between about 1972 and 1974. At the time of ''Aguirre'' the band members were Fricke ([[piano]], [[Mellotron]]), Fichelscher ([[electric guitar]], [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]]), Djong Yun ([[singing|vocals]]), and Robert Eliscu ([[oboe]], [[Pan flute|pan pipe]]).\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film was produced in part by West German television station ''[[Hessischer Rundfunk]]'', which televised the film on the same day it opened in theatres. Herzog has blamed this for the relatively poor commercial reception of the film in Germany.<ref name=\"Herzog1\" /> However, outside Germany the film became an \"enormous [[cult film|cult]] favorite\" in \"such places as Mexico, Venezuela, and Algiers\".<ref name=\"Peary\">[[Danny Peary|Peary, Danny]].

Various troubles afflicted the expedition and, sure that El Dorado was very close, Pizarro set up a smaller group led by Francisco de Orellana to break off from the main group and forge ahead, then return with news of what they had found. This group utilized a [[brigantine]] to journey down the river. After failing to find the legendary city, Orellana was unable to return because of the current, and he and his men continued to follow the [[Napo River]] until he reached the [[estuary]] of the Amazon in 1542.\nAccompanying Orellana was [[Gaspar de Carvajal]], who kept a journal of the group's experiences.\n\nThe historic Gaspar de Carvajal (1500\u20131584) was a Spanish Dominican friar who had settled in Peru and dedicated himself to the conversion of the Indigenous peoples. His general attitude towards the local people was consistent with the benevolence of his better-known brother Dominican friar, [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This personality is at odds with the description in the film where Carvajal is portrayed as a cowardly priest who claimed that \"the church was always on the side of the strong\".<ref name=\"Fritze\" />\n\nThe film's major characters, Aguirre, Urs\u00faa, Don Fernando, Inez and Flores, were involved in the second expedition, which left Peru in 1560 to find the city of El Dorado. Commissioned by Peru's governor, Urs\u00faa organized an expeditionary group of 300 men to travel by way of the Amazon River. He was accompanied by his [[Mestizo|mixed-race]] mistress, Do\u00f1a Inez. At one point during the journey, Aguirre, a professional soldier, decided that he could use the 300 men to overthrow the Spanish rule of Peru. Aguirre had Urs\u00faa murdered and proclaimed Fernando as \"The Prince of Peru\". Fernando himself was eventually murdered when he questioned Aguirre's scheme of sailing to the Atlantic, conquering Panama, crossing the isthmus and invading Peru.  Many others who attempted to rebel against Aguirre were also killed. The surviving soldiers conquered [[Isla Margarita]] off the coast of [[Venezuela]] and made preparations to attack the mainland. However, by that time Spanish authorities had learned of Aguirre's plans, and when the rebels arrived in Venezuela, government agents offered full pardons to Aguirre's men. All of them accepted the deal. Immediately prior to his arrest, Aguirre murdered his daughter Flores, who had remained by his side during the entire journey. He was then captured and dismembered.<ref name=\"Waller\">Waller, Gregory. \"Aguirre, The Wrath of God:  History, Theater, and the Camera\", from ''[[South Atlantic Review]]'' 46.2 (1981), pgs. 55 \u2013 69.</ref>\n\nOther Spanish expeditions outside the Amazon influenced the story; the conversation in which the local inhabitants refuse a Bible comes from events before the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], in which Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]] allegedly rejected the [[Requerimiento]]. The chronicle of [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], ''La Relaci\u00f3n'' (\"''The Account''\"), mentions the appearance of a boat in a treetop after a fierce tropical storm in [[Hispaniola]]:\n\n{{blockquote|Monday morning we went down to the port and did not find the ships. We saw their buoys in the water, from which we realized that they had been lost, and we went along the coast to see if we could find signs of them.

Many of his fellow soldiers considered his actions to be that of a madman.<ref name=\"Fritze\" />  Kinski's use of a limp reflected one that Aguirre had, the result of a battle injury. Aguirre's frequent short but impassioned speeches to his men in the film were accurately based on the man's noted \"simple but effective rhetorical ability\".<ref name=\"Waller\"/> The ''South Atlantic Review'' observes the film's attitude toward historical accuracy as being similar to works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]:<blockquote>Like Shakespeare, Herzog begins with chronicle accounts of events and personages, but then re-shapes and embroiders upon these historical chronicles, at once providing answers and revealing more puzzling questions, not only turning \"history\" into \"art\" (a tenuous distinction in any case), but meditating upon the makers and the making of history.\n\n\u2014 Gregory A. Waller<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waller|first=Gregory A.|date=1981|title=\"Aguirre, The Wrath of God\": History, Theater, and the Camera|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3199461|journal=South Atlantic Review|volume=46|issue=2|pages=55\u201369|doi=10.2307/3199461|jstor=3199461|issn=0277-335X}}</ref></blockquote>Additionally noted is the juxtaposition of Spanish imperialism with that of Nazism, specifically citing Aguirre's deranged closing speech as \"historical analogy with Hitler and German fascism\".\n\n''Film Quarterly'' further expands on this point, marking the casting of Kinski as emblematic of this historical parallel:<blockquote>[Herzog] achieves this dimension by choosing an actor with typically Nordic coloring: Klaus Kinski, with his blond hair and blue eyes.25 According to historical accounts, Aguirre was \"of short stature . . . sparely made, ill-featured, the face small and lean, [the] beard black. \" Herzog's Aguirre is not of \"short stature\" but although he is not very tall, his deformity causes him to stand out. Unlike the historical Aguirre, this one has unusually large features and is beardless and blond. Through this blond Nordic knight, Herzog alludes to a much earlier age of expansionism: to medieval Germany with the religious imperialism of the Crusaders and the Teutonic Knights, and also to a more recent period: the 1930s, which combined the rebirth of the Nordic stereotype (seen in the light of racial superiority) with Hitler's attempts at imperialist conquest. Herzog's main character is more than a conquistador of one particular century; he is the embodiment of imperialism as such.\n\nSeen in this light, Herzog's re-creation of a specific period in history, i.e., Spain's conquests in the New World, becomes a treatise on the evils of imperialism through the ages. It is not surprising then, that Herzog's film constitutes a great flight of fancy mostly leaving historical data behind and making instead a collage of fact and fiction.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fact and Fiction: Nature's Endgame in Werner Herzog's Aguirre, the Wrath of God - ProQuest|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/bf7e9ad5c271407ff531e972934dfa29/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=5938|access-date=2021-04-05|website=search.proquest.com|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>While film journalists acknowledge the various liberties taken within the film's depiction of historical events, these choices are observed as creative decisions on the part of the director, both in service of the narrative structure and also as reflections of imperialist and fascist manifestations occurring throughout history, both prior to and following the 16th-century conquest of South America. Kinski's manic performance combined with the film's blunt portrayal of violence toward the native population acts less as a literal portrayal of events and more as broad condemnation of both historical events and the concept of imperialist conquest.\n\n==See also==\n*[[John Okello#Cultural references to Okello|John Okello]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Amg movie|1249|Aguirre, the Wrath of God}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0068182}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=aguirre_the_wrath_of_god}}\n\n{{Werner Herzog}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aguirre The Wrath Of God}}\n[[Category:1972 films]]\n[[Category:1970s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s historical drama films]]\n[[Category:West German films]]\n[[Category:German biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:German historical drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s German-language films]]\n[[Category:German epic films]]\n[[Category:Films about conquistadors]]\n[[Category:Films about death]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Epic films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Existentialist films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Werner Herzog]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Popol Vuh (band)]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1560s]]\n[[Category:Films set in jungles]]\n[[Category:Films set in Peru]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Peru]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Inca Empire]]\n[[Category:Historical epic films]]\n[[Category:Indigenous cinema in Latin America]]\n[[Category:Quechua-language films]]\n[[Category:Survival films]]\n[[Category:1972 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about Native Americans]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Amazon]]\n[[Category:1970s German films]]"}]}}}}
