It was written and directed by [[Ben Elton]], with Laurie directing some scenes in an uncredited role, and based upon Elton's 1999 novel, ''[[Inconceivable (novel)|Inconceivable]]''. A critical failure, the film did poorly at the box office, despite a cast including many of the best-known names within comedy in Britain.\n\n==Plot==\nSam Bell ([[Hugh Laurie]]) and his wife Lucy ([[Joely Richardson]]) are a married couple struggling for a baby, having tried everything they can think of to improve their chances of conceiving. At the same time, Sam begins to find his job (as a commissioning editor of drama at the [[BBC]]) increasingly unfulfilling. While he resolves to write his own screenplay, he begins to suffer [[writer's block]].\n\nThe idea dawns upon him to write about his own predicament, something to which Lucy objects strongly. He uses her diary entries to help him achieve authenticity, and the film is a success. Lucy finds out about the film and, shocked, leaves Sam. Eventually they reconcile, and at the end of the story are still trying for a baby.\n\nIt marks the second time Laurie and Richardson have starred in the same film; the first was ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'' (although in that film they shared no scenes).\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hugh Laurie]] as Sam Bell\n*[[Joely Richardson]] as Lucy Bell\n*[[Matthew Macfadyen]] as Nigel\n*[[Adrian Lester]] as George\n*[[Yasmin Bannerman]] as Melinda\n*[[Joanna Lumley]] as Sheila\n*[[Rachael Stirling]] as Joanna\n*[[Dave Thompson (comedian)|Dave Thompson]] as Dave the Comedian\n*[[Emma Thompson]] as Druscilla\n*[[James Purefoy]] as Carl Phipps\n*[[Tom Hollander]] as Ewan Proclaimer\n*[[Rowan Atkinson]] as Mr. James\n*[[Kelly Reilly]] as Nimnh\n*[[Dawn French]] as Charlene\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe title song \"[[Maybe Baby (song)|Maybe Baby]]\" is performed by [[Paul McCartney]] and co-produced by McCartney and [[Jeff Lynne]]. \"I Don't Wanna Fight\", a song from [[Westlife]]'s self-titled debut album, is played in the last part of the movie.
