During his visit, accident-prone Tom makes enemies with nearly every group of students, and thus spends much of his visit evading the growing mob after him.\n\nDuring his visit, Tom finds himself in the middle of a war between \"The Pit\" and \"Balls and Shaft\", two rival groups. Among the members of the latter is Rand McPherson, who, with the other Balls and Shaft members, want the outlawed [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek system]] to return.\n\nMeanwhile, \"The Pit\" runs the former \"Balls and Shaft\" frat house in a highly disorganized manner. Currently inhabited by seniors Gutter and Mullaney, mid-year freshman co-ed Katy, and led by multi-year senior James \"Droz\" Andrews, The Pit is a party-centric house that rebels against politically correct protests; their counter-protests and parties are a frequent source of complaint forms.\n\nOther factions on campus include a commune-style house of pot users called Jerrytown that Gutter often frequents, a [[Radical feminism|radical feminist]] group known as the Womynists, an Afrocentric group suspecting the Pit of conspiring against them, and the college president, Ms. Garcia-Thompson, who is obsessed with enforcing \"sensitivity awareness\" and [[multiculturalism]] to an extreme.  She proposes that Bisexual Asian Studies should have its own building, as well as a plan to change the campus mascot to a [[whooping crane]] instead of an [[Native American mascot controversy|offensive Native American character]] during their bicentennial anniversary.\n\nGarcia-Thompson conspires behind closed doors with Balls and Shaft to get the established residents of The Pit kicked off campus and give Rand control of the house.  She provokes The Pit residents with a damage bill from their past semester. Left unpaid, the campus would seize their house, leaving them homeless and unable to continue attending PCU without getting jobs.\n\nThe Pit responds by throwing a party to raise the funds needed. The Womynists take offense to The Pit's flyers advertising the party, and hold a protest outside as the house residents conspire to steal alcohol and convince students to attend. The party at first appears to be a failure. However, a series of unlikely events results in [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] performing at the party. Students begin streaming in (initially to seize Tom for his prior mistakes) and the party successfully raises the funds to keep the house.\n\nGarcia-Thompson (after being locked in a room by Droz with the song \"[[Afternoon Delight]]\" playing on repeat), decides to act on the many complaints against The Pit. She shuts down the party and expels the residents of The Pit in spite of their fundraising efforts. Tom then informs Droz about an overheard conversation with the Board of Trustees: the President's politically correct changes are negatively affecting both their past legacy and media publicity.\n\nAt the bicentennial ceremony the following morning, Droz and former Pit residents succeed in liberating the Whooping Crane and provoking the other students into an impromptu protest against protesting (chanting \"We're not gonna protest!\"). The demonstration establishes that even with The Pit shut down, the President cannot control the student population, resulting in the Board of Trustees summarily firing her. Meanwhile, Rand complains about all the other student groups, unaware that Droz has surreptitiously used the podium microphone to broadcast his rant to the entire campus.\n\nLater, Tom heads home, having decided to commit to PCU as The Pit has moved back into their house. As he sits on the bus, he sees Rand, who is now in Tom's position at the beginning of the film: being chased by the students across campus.\n\n==Cast==\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''The Pit'''\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as James \"Droz\" Andrews\n* [[Chris Young (actor)|Chris Young]] as Tom Lawrence\n* [[Alex D\u00e9sert]] as Mullaney\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Gutter\n* [[Megan Ward]] as Katy\n* Gale Mayron as Cecilia\n* [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]] as Raji\n* Jake Grace and Darin Heames as \"The Daves\"\n* [[Stivi Paskoski]] as Deege\n* Jody Racicot as Pigman\n\n'''Balls & Shaft'''\n* [[David Spade]] as Rand McPherson\n* [[Kevin Jubinville]] as Carter Prescott\n* Thomas Mitchell as Bantam Draper\n\n'''Womynist House'''\n* Sarah Trigger as Samantha\n* [[Viveka Davis]] as Womynist #1\n* [[Maddie Corman]] as Womynist #2\n{{col-break}}\n'''Jerrytown'''\n* [[Jake Busey]] as Mersh\n* Ted Kozma as Kosmo\n* Theo Caldwell as The Giggler\n\n'''Group Leaders'''\n* Becky Thyre as Moonbeam (Cause-Heads)\n* Kevin Thigpen as Afrocentrist\n* Rob Gfroerer as Computer Geek\n* Jonathan Wilson as Gay Activist\n\n'''The Establishment'''\n* [[Jessica Walter]] as President Garcia-Thompson\n* [[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]] as Trustee #1\n* Larry Reynolds as Trustees #2\n\n'''Others'''\n* [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] as himself\n* [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] appearing as themselves\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] took place almost entirely in and around [[Toronto]] with the [[University of Toronto]] serving as Port Chester University.
