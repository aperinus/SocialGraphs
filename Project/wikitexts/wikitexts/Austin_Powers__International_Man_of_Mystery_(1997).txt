Dr. Evil escapes to space in a rocket and [[Cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|cryogenically freezes]] himself. Powers volunteers to be placed into cryostasis in case Dr. Evil returns in the future.\n\nThirty years later, Dr. Evil returns to discover his henchman Number 2 has developed Virtucon, the legitimate front of Evil's empire, into a multibillion-dollar enterprise. Uninterested in business, Dr. Evil conspires to steal [[nuclear weapons]] and hold the world hostage for $1 million. He increases his demand to $100 billion when he learns that the value of the dollar has fallen due to [[inflation]]. Dr. Evil also learns that, during his absence, his associates have artificially created his son, Scott Evil, using his frozen semen. Now a [[Generation X]] teenager, Scott is resentful of his father's absence and resists his attempts to get closer to him.\n\nHaving learned of Dr. Evil's return, the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] unfreezes Powers, acclimatizing him to the 1990s with the help of agent [[Vanessa Kensington]], the daughter of his 1960s sidekick [[Mrs. Kensington]]. Posing as a married couple, Powers and Kensington track Number 2 to [[Las Vegas]] and meet his Italian secretary, [[Alotta Fagina]]. Powers infiltrates Fagina's penthouse suite and discovers Dr. Evil's plans to drill a nuclear warhead into the Earth's core and trigger volcanic eruptions worldwide. Fagina discovers Powers and seduces him to learn his identity. Dr. Evil and his entourage conspire to defeat Powers by creating a series of [[Fembots (Austin Powers)|fembots]]: beautiful female androids equipped with guns concealed in their breasts.\n\nPowers and Kensington infiltrate the Virtucon headquarters but are apprehended by Dr. Evil's henchman, [[Random Task]]. Meanwhile, the [[United Nations]] accede to the demands of Dr. Evil, who proceeds with his plan nonetheless. Powers and Kensington escape Dr. Evil's death trap and Kensington is sent for help. While searching for Dr. Evil, Powers is confronted by the fembots; Powers seduces them with a [[striptease]] that makes them explode.\n\nBritish forces raid the underground lair, while Powers deactivates the [[doomsday device]]. Powers confronts Dr. Evil, but Fagina arrives holding Kensington hostage. They are interrupted by Number 2, who attempts to betray Dr. Evil by making a deal with Powers. Dr. Evil uses a trap door to eliminate Number 2, then activates the base's self-destruct mechanism and escapes. Powers and Kensington flee as a nuclear explosion destroys the lair. Austin attempts his iconic front flip into the car but crotches himself on the gear shift and groans. Vanessa pulls the stick shift hitting  his [[scrotum]] with it and he grunts.\n\nPowers and Kensington marry. During their honeymoon, Powers is attacked by Random Task. Powers subdues him using a [[penis pump]], which he before claimed wasn't his, allowing Kensington to knock him out. The newlyweds adjourn to the balcony. Among the stars, Powers spots the cryogenic chamber of Dr. Evil, who vows revenge.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] and [[Dr. Evil]]\n* [[Elizabeth Hurley]] as [[Vanessa Kensington]]\n* [[Robert Wagner]] as Number 2\n* [[Seth Green]] as Scott Evil\n* [[Mindy Sterling]] as [[Frau Farbissina]]\n* [[Michael York]] as [[Basil Exposition]]\n* [[Fabiana Udenio]] as [[Alotta Fagina]]\n* [[Will Ferrell]] as [[Mustafa (austin powers)|Mustafa]]\n* [[Mimi Rogers]] as [[Mrs. Kensington]]\n* [[Joe Son]] as [[Random Task]]\n* [[Paul Dillon]] as [[List of Austin Powers characters#Paddy O'Brien|Paddy O'Brien]]\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as [[List of Austin Powers characters#Commander Gilmour|Commander Gilmour]]\n* [[Elya Baskin]] as [[List of Austin Powers characters#General Borschevsky|General Borschevsky]]\n* [[Clint Howard]] as [[List of Austin Powers characters#Johnson Ritter|Johnson Ritter]]\n* [[Neil Mullarkey]] as Quartermaster Clerk\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as [[List of Austin Powers characters#The Texan|Texan]] (uncredited)\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Therapist (uncredited)\n* [[Larry Thomas (actor)|Larry Thomas]] as Casino Dealer\n* [[Burt Bacharach]] as Himself\n* [[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]] as Henchman Steve\n* [[Cindy Margolis]] as Fembot\nDeleted scenes:\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Steve's Step-wife\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Hypnotized Guard (UK Version only)\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as John's Friend (Bill) {{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Inspiration===\n[[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] created the character of Austin Powers for the faux 1960s rock band [[Ming Tea]] that Myers started with [[Matthew Sweet]] and [[Susanna Hoffs]] following his ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' stint in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |author= |year=1997\u20132012 |title=Mike Myers |url=http://www.digitalhit.com/cr/mikemyers/ |access-date=29 July 2012 |work=Digital Hit |publisher=Digital Hit Entertainment/ Multiplex Theatre Properties Inc.}}</ref><ref name=\"BiographyToday\">{{cite book|title=Biography Today Performing Artists|page=101|author=Cherie D.
