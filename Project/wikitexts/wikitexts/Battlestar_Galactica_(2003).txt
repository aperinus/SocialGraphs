Moore]] and directed by [[Michael Rymer]]. It was the first part of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' remake based on the 1978 [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] television series, and served as a [[backdoor pilot]] for the [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|2004 television series]].

Virtually all of the population of the Twelve Colonies is wiped out. Most of the Colonial military is either rendered ineffective or destroyed due to [[malware]] in the military computer network that renders it vulnerable to cyber attack.  The malware was introduced by [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]), a Cylon in the form of a human woman, who seduced the famous scientist [[Gaius Baltar|Dr. Gaius Baltar]] ([[James Callis]]) and exploited their relationship to gain access codes under the cover of an insider contract bid.\n\nThe [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], a hybrid [[battleship]]/[[aircraft carrier]] in space that fought in the earlier war, is in the final stages of being decommissioned and converted to a museum when the attack occurs.  During her decades of colonial service the ''Galactica'''s computer systems had never been networked so the ''Galactica'' is unaffected by the Cylon sabotage. Its commander, [[William Adama]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]), assumes command of the few remaining elements of the human fleet. He heads for the Ragnar Anchorage, a military armory station where the ''Galactica'' can resupply itself with weaponry and essential supplies.\n\n[[File:Caprica burning.jpg|thumb|250px|Caprica under bombardment during the Cylon attack.]]\nSecretary of Education [[Laura Roslin]] ([[Mary McDonnell]]) is sworn in as President of the Twelve Colonies after it is confirmed that the President and most of the government have been killed (Roslin is 43rd in the line of succession). The government starship carrying her (''Colonial One'') manages to assemble a group of surviving civilian ships.\n\nWhen a [[Colonial Raptor]] shuttle from the ''Galactica'' lands briefly for repairs on the Twelve Colonies' capital world of Caprica, the two-person crew, [[Sharon Valerii]] (callsign \"Boomer\") ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) and [[Karl C. Agathon]] (callsign \"Helo\") ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]), offer to evacuate a small group of survivors. Helo remains on the stricken planet, giving up his seat to evacuate Baltar, whom he recognizes for his celebrity status as a scientific genius.\n\n===Part 2===\nThe Cylons locate the human civilian fleet, and Roslin is forced to make the decision to order all of the ships capable of [[faster-than-light]] (FTL) travel to [[Jump drive|jump]] immediately to escape.  Unfortunately this means abandoning many of the survivors who are aboard ships without FTL engines and, as Roslin and the FTL ships jump away, the Cylons launch an attack on the remaining ships.\n\nAt the Ragnar Anchorage space station, Adama is attacked by a supposed arms dealer named Leoben Conoy who claims to be simply bootlegging supplies, but who is clearly being affected by the radiation cloud surrounding Ragnar, which humans are immune to. Adama deduces that he is facing a new type of Cylon that looks, sounds, and acts human.\n\nAs the civilian fleet joins the ''Galactica'' at Ragnar, President Roslin appoints Dr. Baltar, who has not disclosed his suborning by the Cylons, as one of her scientific advisers to combat the Cylons.  Number Six reveals herself to Baltar in hallucinatory form while attempting to direct his behavior. She suggests that she planted a microchip inside Baltar's brain while he slept, allowing her to transmit her image into his conscious mind. Responding to one of her suggestions, he is compelled to identify [[Aaron Doral]], a public relations specialist, as a Cylon agent masquerading as a human. Despite his protests and the lack of any evidence to support the accusation, Doral is left at Ragnar when the ''Galactica'' departs.\n\nAs the Cylons blockade Ragnar, the ''Galactica'' and its fleet of Vipers engage the Cylon fleet in order to allow the civilian fleet to escape by \"jumping\" to a distant, unexplored area outside of their star system. The ''Galactica'' and the colonial fleet make good their escape. Adama then attempts to lift the morale of the surviving humans by announcing plans to reach a legendary thirteenth colony called \"Earth\", whose existence and location have been closely guarded military secrets. Roslin is skeptical and later confronts Adama and makes him admit that Earth is simply an ancient myth.\n\nReturning to his quarters, Adama finds an anonymous note has been left for him stating \"There are only 12 Cylon models.\" On Ragnar, Doral clearly appears to be suffering from radiation poisoning that has been shown to affect only Cylons. His identity as a Cylon is confirmed when a group of Cylons, including the metallic [[Cylon Centurions]] and several humanoid Cylons consisting of multiple copies of the Number Six, Doral, and Leoben models, come to retrieve Doral. In a twist ending, one of the group appears to be Boomer, indicating that her counterpart on the ''Galactica'' is a Cylon as well.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Actor !! Role !!

From the mid-1990s onwards, actor Richard Hatch (Captain Apollo from the original version of the series) made [[Richard Hatch (actor)#Battlestar Galactica revival attempt|numerous efforts]] to revive the series, including co-writing several novels and a comic book series, and even went as far as to produce a proof-of-concept trailer called ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming|The Second Coming]]''. Hatch's campaign was based on the continuation of the original series, set several years after the final episode. DeSanto and Singer's planned version, which actually went into pre-production before being delayed and then scrapped following the events of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]] of 2001, was also a continuation, set some 25 years after the original series. Both versions ignored the events that occurred in ''[[Galactica 1980]]''.\n\nIn 2002, [[Universal Pictures]] (the legal rights holder to ''Battlestar Galactica''), instead opted for a remake rather than a sequel. David Eick approached Ronald D. Moore about a new four-hour ''Battlestar Galactica'' miniseries for Universal. Moore developed the miniseries with Eick, writing the scripts and updating the old series, also developing a backstory that could work for a regular weekly series, should the miniseries be successful. At the same time, Moore was approached by [[HBO]] about running a new television series, ''[[Carniv\u00e0le]]''. While Moore worked on the first year of ''Carniv\u00e0le'', Eick ran the day-to-day production of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' miniseries in Canada. ''Battlestar Galactica'' aired in 2003 and became the highest-rated miniseries on cable that year, and the best ratings that year for any show on Sci-Fi. After ''Carniv\u00e0le'' reached the end of its first season and the Sci-Fi Channel ordered a thirteen-episode weekly series of ''Battlestar Galactica'', Moore left ''Carniv\u00e0le'' to assume a full-time executive producer role on ''Battlestar Galactica''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ron Moore Collection|date=1979\u20132010|series=Finding Aid of the Ron Moore Collection|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt7h4nf5s7/admin/|access-date=20 March 2014|location=USC Libraries Cinematic Arts Library}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe special effects of the miniseries were created by [[Zoic Studios]], who previously worked on the ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' television series. In the opening minutes of Part 1, as the character of Laura Roslin sits in her doctor's office, a Firefly class ship is seen flying above the city. However, the ship does not appear in the Season 2 episode \"[[Epiphanies (Battlestar Galactica)|Epiphanies]]\" in which Roslin reflects on her wait in the doctor's office.\n\nThe regular series also contains effects by Atmosphere Studios,<ref name=\"AtmosphereProd\">{{cite web |date=November 1, 2006 |author=Bryant Frazer | url= http://www.studiodaily.com/main/searchlist/7304.html | title= Heavy-Duty VFX Management for Battlestar Galactica |work=StudioDaily |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421221825/https://www.studiodaily.com/2006/11/heavy-duty-vfx-management-for-battlestar-galactica/ |archive-date=2012-04-21 }}</ref> Enigma Animation Productions and the production's own effects team.<ref name=\"InHouseFXProd\">{{cite web | url = http://www.renderosity.com/news.php?viewStory=14257 | title = \"Battlestar Galactica\" Artists Recognized with 2008 Emmy for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series | access-date = May 6, 2009 | archive-date = February 24, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224082906/http://www.renderosity.com/news.php?viewStory=14257 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Executive producer Ronald D.
