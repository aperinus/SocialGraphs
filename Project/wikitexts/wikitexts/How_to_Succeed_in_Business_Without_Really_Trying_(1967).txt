The film was produced by [[United Artists]] and directed by [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]], with original staging by [[Bob Fosse]].\n\nThe cast includes [[Robert Morse]], [[Rudy Vallee]] and [[Michele Lee]] all reprising their [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] roles; as well as [[Anthony 'Scooter' Teague|Anthony Teague]], and [[Maureen Arthur]]. The film marks the movie debut of Lee. [[Robert Osborne]], who was an actor at this time, was given a small uncredited role as an office employee.\n\n==Plot==\nJ. Pierrepont Finch ([[Robert Morse]]) buys the book ''How to Succeed in Business'', describing in step-by-step fashion how to rise in the business world. The ambitious young window cleaner follows its advice carefully. He joins the \"World-Wide Wicket Company\" and begins work in the mail room. Soon, thanks to the ethically questionable advice in the book, he rises to vice president of advertising by having each person above him either fired or moved or transferred within the company.\n\nFinch begins to fall in love with Rosemary Pilkington ([[Michele Lee]]), a secretary at the company. Finch finds out that J.B. Biggley ([[Rudy Vall\u00e9e|Rudy Vallee]]), the president of the company, has made advances towards Hedy LaRue ([[Maureen Arthur]]), a beautiful but incompetent woman the company has hired. Finch uses this information to assist his climb on the corporate ladder.\n\nBiggley's annoying nephew, Bud Frump ([[Anthony 'Scooter' Teague|Anthony Teague]]), also takes advantage of the situation and tries to get to the top before Finch. By story's end, however, Finch has become chairman of the board, and might make the White House his next step to success.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert Morse]] as J.

Both musical and non-musical versions were prepared.<ref name=\"new\"/> The character of Finch was edited slightly as it was feared that the stage characterization of the character was too edgy and that audiences would not find him likable.\n\nMany songs from the stage version were cut from the movie, most notably all of Rosemary's solos. She was given a version of the song \"I Believe in You\" in order to make up for this.\n\nThe Union Carbide Building (most recently the JPMorgan Chase Tower) that stood at [[270 Park Avenue (1960\u20132021)|270 Park Avenue]] in New York City from 1960 until 2019 was used in exterior shots as the headquarters for the \"World-Wide Wicket Company\" in the movie. It most notably was used in the sequences in which Finch dashes into the building before his boss arrives in order to arrange coffee cups on his desk and pretends to have fallen asleep on it after apparently working all night as a way to convince his boss to promote him to a higher position in the company.\n\nSeveral actors reprised their roles from the stage version, most notably Morse and Vallee. [[Dick Van Dyke]] was considered for the role of Finch, but he turned it down due to concerns that he was too old for the role.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received generally positive reviews. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', for example, praised the film as successfully re-creating \"just about everything that was conducive to the stage success,\" especially the performances of Morse and Vallee:<blockquote>Seeing Mr. Morse in close-ups, as those wily expressions cross on his face and those wicked designs of Pal Joey gleam in his Horatio Alger-character eyes, is better (and I'm not chauvinistic) than seeing him on the stage. And Mr. Vallee\u2014well, I can say nothing nicer than that he continues to improve with age.<ref name=\"Crowther\">{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=Screen: 'How to Succeed' Does Again:Musical With Morse and Vallee Opens|date=March 10, 1967|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/03/10/archives/screen-how-to-succeed-does-againmusical-with-morse-and-vallee-opens.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=11 December 2021}}</ref></blockquote> Upon its release, however, the film failed to make a profit and was a commercial disappointment.
