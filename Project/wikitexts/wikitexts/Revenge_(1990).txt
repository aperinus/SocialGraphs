Some scenes were filmed in Mexico. The film is a production of [[New World Pictures]] and Rastar Films and was released by [[Columbia Pictures]]. ''Revenge'' also features one of [[John Leguizamo]]'s earliest film roles.  The film is based on a novella written by [[Jim Harrison]], published in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine in 1979.  Harrison co-wrote the script for the film.\n\n==Plot==\nMichael J. \"Jay\" Cochran ([[Kevin Costner]]) is a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] aviator, leaving the service after 12 years. He receives a matched pair of Beretta shotguns and an invitation from his wealthy friend, Tiburon \"Tibey\" Mendez ([[Anthony Quinn]]) to spend time at his hacienda in [[Mexico]]. Tibey is also a powerful crime boss, constantly surrounded by bodyguards.\n\nIn Mexico, Cochran meets Tibey's beautiful young wife, Miryea ([[Madeleine Stowe]]) who lives in lavish surroundings, but is unhappy because her much-older husband does not want children, feeling pregnancy would spoil her looks.\n\nJay presents Tibey with a Navy G-1 leather flight jacket. But he rubs Tibey's suspicious right-hand man, Cesar ([[Tomas Milian]]) the wrong way by behaving independently and not acting like an employee. After a dinner Tibey conducts a private meeting with business associates, killing one of them, while elsewhere Miryea and Jay get better acquainted, developing a romantic attraction for each other.\n\nDuring a party, with Tibey and his men nearby, Jay and Miryea secretly have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] in a closet. Jay tells her he intends to leave Mexico, worried that Tibey will become aware of the situation. Miryea begs him to stay and having fallen in love with her, he agrees and together, they arrange a secret rendezvous at a remote cabin in Mexico.\n\nMiryea tells Tibey that she will be visiting her sister in Miami, but Tibey overhears a telephone conversation in which Miryea asks her sister to lie for her. Tibey drives Miryea to the airport, giving her one last kiss. Jay is secretly waiting inside the airport and they drive off to the cabin.\n\nAt their hideaway, they are surprised by Tibey and his men. Jay's beloved dog Rocky is shot dead. Calling Miryea a \"faithless whore\", Tibey strikes her and cuts her across the mouth with a knife (creating half a [[Glasgow smile]]) as Tibey's henchmen viciously beat Jay bloody. After setting fire to the cabin, they dump Jay in the desert, leaving him to die.\n\nMiryea is placed in a whorehouse with Tibby giving instructions for her to be \u201cfucked 50 times a day\u201d, where she is drugged, abused and relegated to \"common use\". The young man responsible for keeping her drugged has [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. As Miryea no longer wishes to live, she persuades him to share a needle with her, thus infecting her.\n\nAn unconscious Jay is discovered by Mauro ([[Joaqu\u00edn Mart\u00ednez]]) a peasant farmer whose family slowly nurses Jay back to health. Jay returns to the burnt cabin and retrieves some money he had hidden. Mauro drives Jay to town and gives him a knife to \"cut the balls off your enemy\". Jay encounters a sickly Texan ([[James Gammon]]) transporting a horse, who offers Jay a ride to Durango. Inside a cantina, Jay notices one of the thugs who had thrashed him; he follows him into the men's room and cuts his throat.\n\nAfter a day on the road, the Texan delivers the horse to a wealthy man, who recognizes Jay from an afternoon at Tibey's estate. The friendly Texan later dies peacefully in his car, while Jay is driving.\n\nAt a motel, Jay runs across Amador ([[Miguel Ferrer]]), Mauro's brother-in-law. Amador and his quiet friend, Ignacio ([[John Leguizamo]]) are willing to help Jay because Amador's sister was killed after getting mixed up in business that involved Tibey. They capture another of Tibey's henchmen, who tells them where Miryea can be found. Jay barges into the brothel, only to find that she has been moved. The madam taunts Jay that Miryea proved very popular with the clientele. No one but Tibey knows where she is.\n\nJay, Amador and Ignacio ambush Tibey and his bodyguard during Tibey's morning horseback ride. Jay is there to ask Miryea's whereabouts, but first Tibey requests that Jay ask forgiveness for having stolen his wife. When Jay lowers his gun and asks Tibey's forgiveness, Tibey reveals that Miryea is in a convent.\n\nMiryea is in a convent hospice, dying of AIDS. Jay arrives in time to tell Miryea that he loves her. He carries her outside and Miryea tells Jay that she also loves him before she dies in his arms.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Michael J. \"Jay\" Cochran, a retired [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] aviator, Tibey's ex-friend and Miryea's lover.\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as Tibey Mendez, a businessman, crime lord, Jay's ex-friend and Miryea's husband.\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Miryea Mendez, Tibey's wife and Jay's lover.\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as ''Amador''\n* [[Tomas Milian]] as ''Cesar''\n* [[James Gammon]] as the ''Texan''\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Mart\u00ednez]] as ''Mauro''\n* [[Jesse Corti]] as ''Madero''\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as ''Ignacio''\n* [[Joe Santos]] as ''Ibarra''\n* Christofer de Oni as ''Diaz''\n* Karmin Murcelo as [[Procuring (prostitution)|Madam]]\n* [[Sally Kirkland]] as ''Rock Star''\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\nThe novella was published in 1979 along with two other novellas under the title ''Legends of the Fall''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=A spring catalog of notable fiction Carner|work=Raymond.
