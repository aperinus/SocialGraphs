The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Emma Stone]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Octavia Spencer]], [[Jessica Chastain]], and [[Allison Janney]]. The film and novel recount the story of a young white woman and aspiring journalist Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Viola Davis on making 'The Help' work |url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/viola-davis-on-making-the-help-work-1.3075367 |first=John| last=Anderson| date=August 5, 2011| newspaper=[[Newsday]]| location=Melville, NY}}</ref> The story focuses on her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963 [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. In an attempt to become a legitimate journalist and writer, Skeeter decides to write a book from the point of view of the maids, exposing the [[Racism in the United States|racism]] they face as they work for white families. [[Domestic worker#Blacks in 1960s America|Black domestic workers in 1960s America]] were referred to as \"the help\", hence the title of the journalistic expos\u00e9, the novel and the film.\n\n[[DreamWorks Pictures]] acquired the [[Film rights|screen rights]] to Stockett's novel in March 2010 and quickly commissioned the film with [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Michael Barnathan]], and [[Brunson Green]] as producers. The film's casting began later that month, with [[principal photography]] following four months after in Mississippi. The film is an international co-production between companies based in the United States, India, and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n\n''The Help'' premiered at [[Beverly Hills]] on August 9, 2011 and went into [[Wide release|general theatrical release]] in North America on August 10 by [[Touchstone Pictures]]. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $216{{nbs}}million worldwide and receiving positive reviews from critics, who mostly praised the acting (particularly that of Davis, Spencer and Chastain), though the film's depiction of race drew some criticism as having a [[white savior narrative in film|white savior narrative]].<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\" /> ''The Help'' received four [[Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Davis, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for both Chastain and Spencer, with the latter winning the award. The film also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary must be between 400 and 700 words.-->\nIn 1963, Aibileen Clark is an African-American maid in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. She works for socialite Elizabeth Leefolt, caring for her daughter Mae Mobley, whom Elizabeth neglects. Aibileen's best friend and fellow maid Minny Jackson works for Mrs. Walters, whose daughter Hilly Holbrook leads the women's socialite group and is president of the city's [[Junior League]] chapter.\n\nElizabeth and Hilly's mutual best friend Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, a recent graduate of [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]] and an aspiring writer, is uncomfortable with her town's racist attitudes toward their maids, including Hilly's insistence on installing separate bathrooms for the help due to the belief that they carry \"different diseases\". Skeeter lives with her parents at Longleaf, their cotton plantation. Skeeter learns that her mother Charlotte fired Constantine, the maid who raised her, and decides to write a book of interviews with African-American maids working for white families.\n\nMinny is soon fired by Hilly for using the guest bathroom during a storm and rendered unemployable due to Hilly's lies, but finds a job as a housemaid for Celia Foote, a housewife ostracized by the socialites. Celia treats Minny with respect and they become friends, but keeps Minny's employment secret from Celia's husband Johnny, Hilly's former beau. Celia suffers a [[miscarriage]], and she reveals to Minny that she never told Johnny about the pregnancy, including two previous miscarriages she had.\n\nSkeeter reaches out to Aibileen, who eventually agrees to be interviewed, as does Minny. Elaine Stein, Skeeter's editor at [[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Row]], tells her that stories of two maids are not enough, but fear of retribution prevents other maids from coming forward. Aibileen tells Skeeter about her struggle to cope with the death of her only son, and believes the book will help her find closure.\n\nHilly refuses to advance money to her replacement maid, Yule May, who is struggling to send her twin sons to college. Yule May discovers a lost ring under a sofa and pawns it, but is later brutally arrested as Hilly watches. This incident and the local assassination of [[Medgar Evers]] inspire more maids to tell Skeeter their stories.\n\nFollowing the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear the maids' stories will be recognized. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" as a form of insurance: after her termination, Minny brought Hilly her famous chocolate pie but revealed{{snd}}after Hilly had finished two slices{{snd}}that she had baked her own [[excrement]] into it; Hilly later forced her mother into a nursing home for laughing at her during the incident. The inclusion of this in the book prompts Hilly to crusade in denial that the book is about people in Jackson.\n\nSkeeter confronts her mother about having fired Constantine after a lifetime of service, and Charlotte confesses that during a [[Daughters of America]] luncheon, she fired Constantine to save face because Constantine's daughter Rachel embarrassed Charlotte by disobeying her orders to enter through the kitchen. Rachel took Constantine to Chicago, where she later died. Charlotte feels guilty that she was not brave enough to stand up for someone who had served her for two decades and helped raise her daughter. \n \nThe book is published anonymously and is a success. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" to Celia, who finally sees what a manipulative bully Hilly is, and writes a check to one of Hilly's charity groups, made out to \"Two Slice Hilly\". Incensed, Hilly threatens to sue Skeeter for [[defamation|libel]], but backs down when Skeeter reminds her that she would have to publicly admit the pie story was about her. Charlotte intervenes, showing that she knows about the \"terrible awful\", and orders Hilly off the property, reconciling the grudge between her and her daughter. She lets her know how proud she is of the book and job offer in New York City, telling Skeeter that sometimes courage skips a generation.\n\nJohnny tells Minny he knows she has been working at his house, and how thankful he is for her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has permanent job security. This kindness gives Minny the courage to take her children and leave her abusive husband.\n\nSeeking revenge for helping Skeeter, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to fire Aibileen, framing her for theft of silverware. Aibileen stands up to Hilly, who breaks down and storms out, and Elizabeth orders Aibileen to leave. Aibileen bids farewell to Mae, pleading with Elizabeth to give her daughter a chance; seeing her daughter's reaction to Aibileen's departure moves Elizabeth to tears. Aibileen reflects on the ordeal and finds closure, officially retiring from help work and looking to her own future as a writer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Emma Stone]] as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan\n*[[Viola Davis]] as Aibileen Clark\n*[[Octavia Spencer]] as Minerva \"Minny\" Jackson\n*[[Jessica Chastain]] as Celia Rae Foote\n*[[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Hillary \"Hilly\" Walters Holbrook\n*[[Allison Janney]] as Charlotte Phelan\n*[[Ahna O'Reilly]] as Elizabeth Leefolt\n*[[Sissy Spacek]] as Mrs. Walters\n*[[Chris Lowell]] as Stuart Whitworth\n*[[Mike Vogel]] as Jonathan \"Johnny\" Foote\n*[[Wes Chatham]] as Carlton Phelan\n*[[Cicely Tyson]] as Constantine Jefferson\n*[[Anna Camp]] as Jolene French\n*[[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Mary Beth Caldwell\n*[[Brian Kerwin]] as Robert Phelan\n*[[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Yule May Davis\n*[[Mary Steenburgen]] as Elaine Stein\n*[[Leslie Jordan]] as Mr. Blackly\n*[[David Oyelowo]] as Preacher Green\n*[[Dana Ivey]] as Grace Higginbotham\n*[[Shane McRae]] as Raleigh Leefolt\n*[[Carol Sutton (actress)|Carol Sutton]] as Cora\n*[[Nelsan Ellis]] as Henry The Waiter\n*[[LaChanze]] as Rachel\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2009, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Chris Columbus, Michael Barnathan, and Mark Radcliffe would produce a film adaptation of ''The Help'', under their production company [[1492 Pictures]].

It brings light to [[Medgar Evers]], an African-American activist and [[NAACP]] leader, who worked toward gaining rights for African-Americans at the time, as well as aiding in the fight to end segregation. In the film, Skeeter and the two maids are seen watching Evers' address. The moment where the news of Evers' assassination is transmitted drives Skeeter to interview the maids for their stories.\n\nIn the original novel, Pascagoula, the Phelan family's maid, is the one watching the Medgar Evers address, introducing her into the narrative, whereas, in the film, Skeeter is at the forefront, placing her as the primary audience of civil rights news. This aspect of the narrative has brought forth some criticism towards the film.
