The five teens include two rival gang leaders, Ruben Pacheco ([[Michael Carmine]]), the leader of the Home Boys serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault and armed robbery; Moss Roosevelt ([[Leon Robinson]]), the leader of the 27th Avenue Players, also serving a three-year sentence, for assault and armed robbery; Carlos Aragon ([[Danny Quinn]]), a drug trafficker serving a four-year sentence after being arrested in a police sting; James Lee \"J.L.\" MacEwen ([[John Cameron Mitchell]]), the youngest and most violent of the teenagers, serving a 10-year sentence for manslaughter of his abusive and alcoholic father and various arson charges; and Dorcey Bridger (Al Shannon), a car thief serving three-plus years for auto theft and over 15 escape attempts from various juvenile halls.\n\nForced into the swamps, the teens must learn to survive in the dangerous swamp and how to work together. Upon completion of the program, the group buys a vacant house in a dangerous part of [[Miami]] and slowly rebuilds the neighborhood, kicking out the pimps, prostitutes and drug dealers. This offends the former illegal inhabitants of their house, all loyal customers of drug baron Cream ([[Laurence Fishburne]]). The conflict leads to armed fights, in which Joe is killed. The surviving members of the group take the fight directly to a drug manufacturing facility that is equipped with an [[M-134 Minigun]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Stephen Lang]] as Joe Tegra \n*[[Michael Carmine]] as Ruben Julian Pacecho\n*[[Lauren Holly]] as Nikki \n*[[Leon Robinson]] as Moss Roosevelt\n*[[John Cameron Mitchell]] as James Lee MacEwen \n*[[Danny Quinn]] as Carlos Rene Aragon\n*Al Shannon as Dorcey Jon Bridger\n*[[Paul Calderon]] as Tito\n*[[James Remar]] as Nestor\n*[[Laurence Fishburne|Larry Fishburne]] as Cream\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 13%, based on 8 reviews, and an average rating of 3.5/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/band_of_the_hand |title=Band of the Hand (1986) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCritics have described the film as \"a poor 1970s vigilante movie produced a decade too late.\"<ref>Allon, Yoram; Cullen, Del.
