It stars [[Harry Dean Stanton]] and [[Emilio Estevez]], with [[Tracey Walter]], [[Olivia Barash]], [[Sy Richardson]], [[Vonetta McGee]], [[Fox Harris]], and [[Dick Rude]] among the supporting cast. Set in [[Los Angeles]], the plot concerns a young [[punk rocker]] (Estevez) who is recruited by a car [[repossession]] agency and gets caught up in the pursuit of a mysterious [[Chevrolet Malibu]] that might be connected to extraterrestrials.\n\nA [[satire (film and television)|satire]] of [[Domestic policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|America under the Reagan administration]], [[consumerism]] and the [[Atomic Age]], ''Repo Man'' was developed by Cox in partnership with his fellow film school graduates from [[UCLA]], [[independent film|independent]] producers [[Jonathan Wacks]] and [[Peter McCarthy (American film producer)|Peter McCarthy]]. His inspiration for the film came from his own experiences working with repossession agent Mark Lewis. Originally conceiving of it as a [[road movie]], Cox reconfigured the story to take place mostly in Los Angeles to maintain its budget. [[Michael Nesmith]] of [[The Monkees]] came on board the project as an [[executive producer]], and secured a [[negative pickup deal]] with [[Universal Pictures]]. Principal photography ran through summer 1983, during which Cox encouraged improvisation from the cast; the film's ending notably differed from what had originally been written.<ref name=\"AFI\">{{Cite web |title=Repo Man (1984) |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/67289-REPO-MAN?sid=81730ab1-8821-4a8e-bb1f-973779004466&sr=4.5347095&cp=1&pos=0 |access-date=2020-03-11 |website=[[American Film Institute|AFI]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Weirdest\">{{Cite web |date=2014-12-19 |title=The Weirdest Things You Never Knew About The Making Of Repo Man |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-weirdest-things-you-never-knew-about-the-making-of-1673079559?IR=T |access-date=2020-03-11 |website=Gizmodo}}</ref><ref name=\"Truths\">{{Cite web |last=Ciampaglia |first=Dante A. |date=2015-08-21 |title=15 Atomic Truths About Repo Man |url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67675/15-atomic-truths-about-repo-man |access-date=2020-03-11 |website=Mental Floss}}</ref> The soundtrack, headlined by a main theme composed and performed by [[Iggy Pop]], is noted as a snapshot of 1980s [[hardcore punk]];<ref name=\"Burks\">{{Cite web |last=Burks |first=Brian |title=Repo Man (soundtrack) |url=http://starling.rinet.ru/music/temp/repoman.html |access-date=2002-04-23 |website=Creative Noise}}</ref> Cox wanted the music to underscore the life of repo men.<ref name=\"Burks\" /><ref name=\"Repo Man Film\">{{Cite web |title=REPO MAN \u2013 Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |url=http://www.repomanfilm.com/music.htm |access-date=2019-01-24 |website=Repo Man Film}}</ref>\n\nDespite a troubled initial release due to Universal's skepticism towards the film's commercial viability, ''Repo Man'' received widespread acclaim, and was deemed by critics to be one of the best films of 1984.<ref name=\"The 10 Best Movies of 1984\">{{Cite web |title=The 10 Best Movies of 1984 |url=http://www.film.com/features/story/10-best-movies-of-1984/15492765 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103324/http://www.film.com/features/story/10-best-movies-of-1984/15492765 |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |access-date=May 21, 2010 |publisher=[[RealNetworks|Film.com]] |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"The Best Movies of 1984 by Rank\">{{Cite web |title=The Best Movies of 1984 by Rank |url=http://www.films101.com/y1984r.htm |access-date=May 21, 2010 |publisher=Films101.com}}</ref> It has since gained a [[cult film|cult following]], particularly surrounding Cox's [[Re-edited film|re-edited version of the film for television]] due to its deliberate inclusion of surreal [[overdub]]s to replace [[profanity]].<ref name=\"Weirdest\" /> A [[stand-alone sequel]] based on an unproduced screenplay by Cox, ''[[Waldo's Hawaiian Holiday]]'', was published as a [[graphic novel]] in 2008, while a [[spiritual successor]], ''[[Repo Chick]]'', was released in 2009.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the [[Mojave Desert]], a policeman pulls over a 1964 [[Chevrolet Malibu]] driven by J. Frank Parnell. The policeman opens the trunk, sees a blinding flash of white light, and is instantly vaporized, leaving only his boots behind.\n\nOtto Maddox, a young punk rocker in L.A., is fired from his job as a supermarket stock clerk. His girlfriend leaves him for his best friend. Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when Bud drives up and offers him $25 to drive a car out of the neighborhood, supposedly for his wife.\n\nOtto follows Bud in the car to the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation, where he learns the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a \"repo man,\" and goes to his parents'. He learns that his burned-out ex-hippie parents have donated the money that they promised him as a reward for graduating from high school to a [[televangelist]]. He decides to take the repo job.\n\nAfter repossessing a flashy red Cadillac, Otto sees Leila running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet. On the way, she shows him pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She says they are dangerous due to the radiation they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand is offered a $20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the repossession is drug-related because the bounty is far above the actual value of the car.\n\nParnell arrives in L.A. driving the Malibu, but he is unable to meet his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When Parnell pulls into a gas station, Helping Hand's competitors, the Rodriguez brothers, take the Malibu. They stop for sodas because the car's trunk is hot. While they are out of the car a trio of Otto's punk friends, who are on a crime spree, steal it.\n\nAfter visiting a nightclub, Parnell appears and tricks the punks into opening the trunk, killing one of them and scaring the other two away. Later, he picks up Otto and drives aimlessly, before collapsing and dying from radiation. After surviving a convenience store shootout with the punks that leaves Bud wounded and punk Duke dead, Otto takes the Malibu back to Helping Hand and leaves it in the lot. The car is stolen again, and a chase ensues. By this time, the car is glowing bright green.\n\nEventually, the Malibu reappears at the Helping Hand lot with Bud behind the wheel, but he ends up being shot. The various groups trying to acquire the car soon show up; government agents, the UFO scientists, and the televangelist. Anyone who approaches it bursts into flames, even those in flame-retardant suits.\n\nOnly Miller, an eccentric mechanic at Helping Hand who had explained earlier to Otto that aliens exist and can travel through time in their spaceships, is able to enter the car. He slides behind the wheel and beckons Otto into the Malibu. After Otto settles into the passenger seat, it lifts straight up into the air and flies away, first through the city's skyline and later into space.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Bud\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Otto Maddox\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Miller\n* [[Olivia Barash]] as Leila\n* [[Sy Richardson]] as Lite\n* [[Vonetta McGee]] as Marlene\n* [[Richard Foronjy]] as Otto Plettschner\n* Susan Barnes as Agent Rogersz\n* [[Fox Harris]] as J.
