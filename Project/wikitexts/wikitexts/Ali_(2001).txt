The film focuses on ten years in the life of the [[boxing|boxer]] [[Muhammad Ali]], played by [[Will Smith]], from 1964 to 1974, featuring his capture of the heavyweight title [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston|from Sonny Liston]], his conversion to [[Islam]], criticism of the [[Vietnam War]], and banishment from boxing, his return to [[Fight of the Century|fight Joe Frazier]] in 1971, and, finally, his reclaiming the title from [[George Foreman]] in [[the Rumble in the Jungle]] fight of 1974. It also touches on the great social and political upheaval in the United States following the assassinations of [[Assassination of Malcolm X|Malcolm X]] and [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.]]\n\nThe project began in 1992 when producer [[Paul Ardaji]] optioned the movie rights to Muhammad Ali\u2019s life story. In 1992, Ardaji had visited Ali on his 50th birthday and persuaded him to allow a film to be made about his life. Nearing the end of his option period, Ardaji signed a contract with [[Sony Pictures]], joining forces with producer Jon Peters as producing partner. In February 2000, it was announced that Mann had taken over as a director, following his Academy Award nomination for ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]''. Filming began in Los Angeles on January 11, 2001 on a $105 million budget, shooting took place in [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Miami]], and [[Mozambique]].\n\nThe film was well received by critics but was a [[box-office bomb]]. [[Will Smith]] and [[Jon Voight]] received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay Jr.]] before his championship debut against then-[[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight champion]] [[Sonny Liston]]. Clay taunts Liston, then dominates the early rounds of the match. Halfway through, he complains of a burning feeling in his eyes (implying that Liston has tried to cheat) and says he is unable to continue. However, his trainer/manager [[Angelo Dundee]] gets him to keep fighting. Once Clay is able to see again, he dominates the fight and Liston quits before round seven, making Clay the second-youngest heavyweight champion at the time after [[Floyd Patterson]].\n\nClay spends time with [[Malcolm X]] and is invited to the home of [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Elijah Muhammad]], where he is given the name Muhammad Ali. His father, Cassius Clay Sr., disapproves. Ali marries Sonji Roi, an ex-[[Playboy Bunny]], although she is not [[Muslim]] and [[Islam and gender segregation|does not abide sex segregation]]. Ali goes to Africa and meets up with Malcolm X, but later refuses to speak to him, honoring the wishes of Elijah Muhammad. He is extremely distraught when X is [[Assassination of Malcolm X|later assassinated]].\n\nUpon returning to [[United States|America]], Ali fights Sonny Liston a second time and knocks him out in the first round. He and Sonji divorce after she objects to various obligations Muslim women have.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/muhammad-ali-women-who-loved-8111280|title=Muhammad Ali and the women who loved him during his four marriages|last=Mirror.co.uk|date=2016-06-04|work=mirror|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref>\n\nAli refuses conscription for the [[Vietnam War]] and is stripped of his boxing license, passport and title, and sentenced to five years in prison. Ali marries 17-year-old [[Khalilah Ali|Belinda Boyd]]. After a three-year hiatus, his [[Clay v. United States|conviction is overturned]] and in his comeback fight, he goes against [[Jerry Quarry]] and wins by technical knockout in three rounds.\n\nAli attempts to regain the heavyweight championship against [[Joe Frazier]]. In the \"[[Fight of the Century]]\", Frazier generally has the upper hand against Ali and wins by decision, the first loss of Ali's career. Frazier later loses the championship to [[George Foreman]].\n\nForeman and Ali go to [[Kinshasa|Kinshasa, Zaire]], for the [[the Rumble in the Jungle|Rumble in the Jungle]] fight. There, Ali meets [[Veronica Porch\u00e9 Ali|Veronica Porch\u00e9]] and has an affair with her. After reading rumors of his infidelity in newspapers, his wife Belinda travels to Zaire to confront him. Ali says he is unsure whether he loves Veronica, but is focused solely on his upcoming title shot.\n\nFor a good portion of the fight against Foreman, Ali leans back against the ropes, [[Rope-a-dope|allowing Foreman to tire himself out]]. He then knocks out the exhausted Foreman, regaining the Heavyweight Championship.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay Jr. / Cassius X / Muhammad Ali]]\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as [[Drew Bundini Brown]] - Ali's assistant trainer\n* [[Jon Voight]] as [[Howard Cosell]] - A journalist\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as [[Malcolm X]] - Ali's friend, and a civil rights leader\n* [[Ron Silver]] as [[Angelo Dundee]] - Ali's trainer\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Howard Bingham]] - Ali's photographer\n* [[Michael Bentt]] as [[Sonny Liston]] - The boxing champion at the beginning of the movie\n*  Robert Sale as [[Jerry Quarry]] - One of Ali's opponents\n* [[James Toney]] as [[Joe Frazier]] - One of Ali's opponents\n* [[Charles Shufford]] as [[George Foreman]] - One of Ali's opponents\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] - A promoter who arranged Ali's fight against Foreman\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as Sonji Roi - An ex-Playboy bunny\n* [[Nona Gaye]] as [[Khalilah Ali|Belinda Boyd / Khalilah Ali]] - A woman who interviewed Ali as a child\n* [[Michael Michele]] as [[Veronica Porch\u00e9 Ali|Veronica Porch\u00e9]] - A woman who worked with Don King\n* [[Joe Morton]] as [[Chauncey Eskridge]] - Ali's lawyer\n* [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] as Dr. [[Ferdie Pacheco]] - Ali's doctor\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Bradley - A government agent\n* [[Barry Shabaka Henley]] as [[Jabir Herbert Muhammad|Herbert Muhammad]] - Ali's manager, and the son of Elijah Muhammad\n* [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]] as [[Elijah Muhammad]] - Leader of the Nation of Islam\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as [[Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr.|Cassius Clay Sr.]] - Ali's father\n*  David Haines as [[Rahman Ali|Rudy Clay / Rahman Ali]] - Ali's brother\n* [[Laurence Mason]] as [[Luis Sarria]]\n* [[LeVar Burton]] as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] - A civil rights leader\n* [[David Cubitt]] as [[Robert Lipsyte]] - A journalist\n* [[Leon Robinson]] as Brother Joe\n* [[Ted Levine]] as Joe Smiley - A government agent\n*  Malick Bowens as [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph Mobutu]] - The President of Zaire\n* [[Victoria Dillard]] as [[Betty Shabazz]] - Malcolm X's wife\n*  David Elliott as [[Sam Cooke]] - A musician\n* [[Brad Greenquist]] as Marlin Thomas\n\n==Production==\nThe project began in 1992 when producer [[Paul Ardaji]] optioned the movie rights to Muhammad Ali's life story.

These included boxing training (up to seven hours a day), Islamic studies with Wiljah Akbar and dialect training. Smith has said that his portrayal of Ali is his proudest work to date.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nOne of the selling points of the film is the realism of the fight scenes. Smith worked alongside boxing promoter Guy Sharpe from SharpeShooter Entertainment, and his lead fighter Ross Kent, to get the majority of his boxing tips for the film. All of the boxers in the film are former or current world heavyweight championship caliber boxers. It was quickly decided that 'Hollywood fighting'\u2014passing the fist (or foot) between the camera and the face to create the illusion of a hit\u2014would not be used in favor of actual boxing. The only limitation placed upon the fighters was for Charles Shufford (who plays [[George Foreman]]). He was permitted to hit Smith as hard as he could, so long as he did not actually knock the actor out.\n\nSmith had to gain weight to look the part of Muhammad Ali.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/09/movies/the-new-season-film-michael-mann-and-will-smith-in-the-ring-with-ali.html | work=New York Times | title=THE NEW SEASON/FILM; Michael Mann and Will Smith in the Ring With Ali | date=2001-09-09 | access-date=2012-03-10 | first1=Allen | last1=Barra}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n=== Box office ===\n''Ali'' opened on December 25 (Christmas Day), 2001 and grossed a total of $14.7 million in 2,446 theaters during its opening weekend.
