It depicts the psychological effects on a family and their life after the death of their son. It was filmed in and around the city of [[Ancona]], with a cast led by Moretti, [[Laura Morante]] and [[Jasmine Trinca]].\n\nThe film competed at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] and received positive reviews. It won numerous awards, including the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[David di Donatello for Best Film]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Ancona]], Giovanni is a therapist, whose 17-year-old son Andrea is accused of stealing a rare [[Ammonoidea|ammonite]] [[fossil]] from his school. Andrea is suspended and protests his innocence, but later confesses to his mother Paola he and his friend stole it as a prank, and intended to return it before it broke. Giovanni and Andrea make plans to go [[jogging]] together, but Giovanni is called to the distant home of a patient who is severely distressed about a possible cancer diagnosis. Instead, Andrea goes [[scuba diving]] with a friend and swims into an underwater cave, where he accidentally drowns. Giovanni, Paola and their daughter Irene are left to mourn. Giovanni investigates the diving equipment model and becomes suspicious that Andrea's was defective, but Paola reminds him the verdict was that it was functioning properly. Giovanni, once a distant observer of his patients' struggles, begins having difficulty analyzing them, particularly the one he went to see on the day Andrea died, against whom he shows signs of impatience and hostility.\n\nOne day, Paola receives a [[love letter]] sent to Andrea by a girl named Arianna, whom he had met at a camp. The family does not know Arianna, and never knew Andrea had a girlfriend. They realize she does not know Andrea has died and attempt to contact her, eventually inviting her to their home. Giovanni stops by a music store to buy an album, ostensibly for a friend of Andrea, but more for Andrea. A clerk gives him a [[Brian Eno]] album. Arianna arrives on her way to a destination, and sees Andrea's bedroom. She shows Giovanni photographs Andrea sent her of himself in his room, some of which are very amusing. The family welcomes Arianna and offers to host her in their home, but she informs them she is [[hitchhiking]] with her friend Stefano to spend vacation in [[France]]. The family offers Arianna and Stefano a short ride, but it lingers to a point where they drive into the night and reach [[Menton]], in the border between Italy and France. Bidding Arianna and Stefano goodbye, the family watch their bus leave Italy and wander in the beach as a new life awaits them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Nanni Moretti]], [[Laura Morante]] and [[Jasmine Trinca]] star as the bereaved family.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = Nanni Moretti (2007).jpg\n | width1    = 148\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Laura Morante Cannes.jpg\n | width2    = 128\n | alt2      = \n | image3    = Jasmine Trinca FCI Tokyo 2007.jpg\n | width3    = 125\n | alt3      = \n}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nanni Moretti]] as Giovanni\n* [[Laura Morante]] as Paola\n* [[Jasmine Trinca]] as Irene\n* [[Giuseppe Sanfelice (actor)|Giuseppe Sanfelice]] as Andrea\n* [[Sofia Vigliar]] as Arianna\n* [[Silvio Orlando]] as Oscar\n* [[Stefano Accorsi]] as Tommaso\n* [[Renato Scarpa]] as Headmaster\n* [[Roberto Nobile]] as Priest\n* [[Paolo De Vita]] as Luciano's father\n* [[Roberto De Francesco]] as record store clerk\n* [[Claudio Santamaria]] as dive shop clerk\n* [[Antonio Petrocelli]] as Enrico\n* [[Lorenzo Alessandri]] as Filippo's father\n* [[Alessandro Infusini]] as Matteo\n* [[Silvia Bonucci]] as Carla\n* [[Marcello Bernacchini]] as Luciano\n}}\n\n==Production==\nItalian director [[Nanni Moretti]] first developed the idea for ''The Son's Room'' out of a longtime interest to write about a [[psychoanalyst]] and play one.<ref name=\"Mottram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/01/31/nanni_moretti_the_sons_room_interview.shtml |title=The Son's Room |last=Mottram |first=James |work=[[BBC]] |date=28 October 2014 |access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>  He came up with the story when he learned his wife was pregnant with a boy.<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-sons-room-2002 |title=The Son's Room |last=Ebert |first=Roger |work=Rogerebert.com |date=1 March 2001 |access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nCinematographer [[Giuseppe Lanci]] said they opted to shoot in [[Ancona]], looking for a sea and port and deciding against [[Genoa]] for its large size and [[Trieste]] for its distractingly beautiful buildings.<ref>Eleanor Andrews, ''Place, Setting, Perspective: Narrative Space in the Films of Nanni Moretti'', Rowman & Littlefield, 26 September 2014, p. 26, {{ISBN|1611476917}}</ref> Filming was suspended for three months, mid schedule, due to Moretti's illness.
