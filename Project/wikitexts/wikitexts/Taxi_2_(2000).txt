Starring [[Samy Naceri]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Diefenthal]] and [[Marion Cotillard]]. It is the second installment in the [[Taxi (film series)|''Taxi'' film series]]. It is a sequel to ''[[Taxi (1998 film)|Taxi]]'', written by [[Luc Besson]] and directed by [[G\u00e9rard Pir\u00e8s]] in 1999. It was followed by ''[[Taxi 3]]'' in January 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Minister of Defense (Japan)|Japanese minister of defence]] is traveling to [[Paris]] to sign a weapons contract between Japan and France, but first, he is visiting [[Marseille]] to view and rate the city police's anti gang tactics (using fake attacks on him).\n\nDuring the visit, however, he is kidnapped by a group working for the Japanese [[yakuza]]. Emilien ([[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Diefenthal]]) is determined to rescue the minister and detective Petra ([[Emma Wiklund|Emma Sj\u00f6berg]]), his girlfriend who was also kidnapped, and restore the honour of his department. Once again, speed demon taxi driver Daniel ([[Samy Naceri]]) is called upon to save the day with his high speed driving skills.\n\nAlso with the Peugeot, the [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI]] is also featured as a star car driven by the [[Yakuza]]s.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Samy Naceri]] as Daniel Morales\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Diefenthal]] as \u00c9milien Coutant-Kerbalec\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Lilly Bertineau\n* [[Emma Sj\u00f6berg]] as Petra\n* [[Bernard Farcy]] as Commissaire G\u00e9rard Gibert\n* [[Jean-Christophe Bouvet]] as [[G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division]] Edmond Bertineau\n* Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Tirmont as Mme Bertineau\n* Tsuyu Shimizu as Yuli\n* [[\u00c9douard Montoute]] as Alain Tr\u00e9sor\n* Ko Suzuki as Katano\n* Yoshi Oida as Yuki Tsumoto\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Car_from_Taxi_film.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Peugeot 406]]]]\nProduction started immediately after the massive success of the first film in the theaters, but this time Besson wanted to up his share of the split with the production company ARP to 70/30 from 50/50. Lead of ARP and Besson's friend P\u00e9tin grit his teeth, as he had carried the first project, but he agreed. The director of the first film G\u00e9rard Pir\u00e8s was replaced by G\u00e9rard Krawczyk, who detractors say was more controllable, but who responded back stating he did what he wanted without needing to respect the scenarios laid by Besson.<ref name=\"lexpress\">{{cite news |last1=Carri\u00e8re |first1=Christophe |title=Luc Besson et la saga Taxi (\u00e9pisode 2) |url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/cinema/luc-besson-et-la-saga-taxi-episode-2_1997772.html |access-date=5 February 2020 |publisher=L'Express |date=7 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Cameraman death===\nOn Monday August 16, 1999, only two weeks into filming, [[Boulevard de l'Amiral-Bruix]] was closed for traffic for the length between [[Porte Dauphine (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Porte Dauphine]] and [[Porte Maillot (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Porte Maillot]]. The [[Peugeot 406]] had to come speeding out of the tunnel, head on to the springboard, jump over two [[AMX-30]] tanks and land on a bed of boxes and mattresses. After an unsuccessful first try, the stunt coordinator [[R\u00e9my Julienne]] with 35 years of experience and credit of 4000 films including six [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]] Films, decided to increase the incline of the springboard a bit and also up the car's running speed. On the second take, the taxi took off faster and higher, landing a few meters further than expected, hitting the 41-year-old cameraman Alain Dutartre, his assistant and a third person. Dutartre died a few hours later in the hospital. The assistant had both of his legs broken. Besson was in [[Los Angeles]] at the time and was contacted immediately. He flew to the set, where detectives were already investigating the matter. Filming had to continue, but did so in a somber mood.<ref name=\"lexpress\"/>\n\nIn June 2002, Luc Besson was summoned to court.<ref name=\"lexpress\"/> Authorities alleged safety was compromised in an effort to cut costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2026403.stm | title=Besson investigated for film death|website=[[BBC News]] |date= 5 June 2002 }}</ref> The stunt coordinator R\u00e9my Julienne was given a one year suspended jail sentence, and fined \u20ac13,000.
