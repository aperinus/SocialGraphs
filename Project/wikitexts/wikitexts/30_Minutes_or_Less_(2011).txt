Loosely inspired by [[Death of Brian Wells|the Brian Wells case]], the plot follows a stoner pizza delivery boy who is forced into wearing a bomb in order to rob a bank.\n\nIt was produced by [[Columbia Pictures]] and funded by [[MRC (company)|Media Rights Capital]]. The film was released on August 12, 2011, received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $40 million against its $28 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Grand Rapids]] [[slacker]] Nick works as a [[pizza delivery]] driver, rarely completes the \"30 Minutes or Less\" policy and is reprimanded by his boss. Nick's school [[teacher]] friend Chet discovers that Nick slept with his twin sister, Kate, on their high school graduation night, causing Chet to end their friendship.\n\nBuddies Dwayne Mikowlski and Travis Cord are miserable, living under the shadow of Dwayne's domineering father, Jerry \"The Major\", who won over $10 million in the lottery about 10 years prior. Dwayne confides in [[lap-dancer]] Juicy about his contempt for his father and his presumed inheritance.\n\nThey devise a plot to kidnap a complete stranger, to strap a bomb to his chest, and get him to get them hitman money. They order a pizza and wait for a driver to come to their hideout. When Nick arrives, Dwayne and Travis assault him and knock him unconscious.\n\nWhen Nick awakes, he is in a vest rigged with explosives, with both a timer and phone-activated detonators. The bomb will explode unless he gets them $100,000 within ten hours, and they also threaten to detonate the bomb if Nick notifies the police. Nick finds Chet, alerts him of the situation, and he reluctantly agrees to help Nick rob a bank. En route, Nick quits his job and then goes to say goodbye to Kate.\n\nNick and Chet hold up the bank and flee quickly. Dwayne says he and Travis will meet Nick at an abandoned rail yard to make the exchange, but go to a restaurant. Instead, Dwayne calls Juicy to get the hit-man to go. Juicy and the hit man Chango arrive to pick up the money, but do not have the bomb deactivation code. Chet appears and knocks out Chango with a metal bar while Nick incapacitates Juicy. The two grab the money and escape.\n\nFrustrated by the turn of events when Nick refuses to answer the phone again, Dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but Travis had altered the number. Rethinking their plan, he and Dwayne head to Kate's apartment in their masks and kidnap her. Chango breaks into the Major's house to find information regarding Dwayne's location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard. The Major attacks him with a pen gun, but is then shot by Chango after a struggle. Chango then heads to the scrapyard. Dwayne threatens to kill Kate unless Nick meets up with him at the scrapyard.\n \nAt the scrapyard, Dwayne gives Nick the code to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with just minutes to spare. Dwayne has them at gunpoint but Nick has Chet fake having a sniper on them by pointing with his laser pointer. Believing him, Dwayne and Travis drop their weapons and Nick starts to leave with the money. However, Chango knocks him out, then has Dwayne at gunpoint, demanding the money. Dwayne gives the money to him, but Chango decides to still kill him and is torched with a flamethrower by Travis. While burning on the ground, Chango wounds Dwayne and shoots the gas tank on Travis's back, causing it to explode.\n\nNick grabs the money and leaves with Kate and Chet. Dwayne chases after them and when he is about to shoot Nick, the bomb explodes, seemingly killing him. (Nick reveals he reactivated the bomb and put it in Dwayne's van.) While Chet looks at the money, a blue dye pack explodes in his face, making the rest of the money worthless. Chet then yells Sandra's name in anger for lying to them again.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Dwayne (who survived the explosion), Travis, the Major recuperating in a wheelchair, and Juicy are seen in an advertisement for their new family business called \"Major Tan: Tanning Salon\".\n\n===Alternative ending===\nIn the alternative ending, Nick, Chet and Kate drive off with the money, discussing what they will do with their newly gained riches. Meanwhile, Dwayne survives the explosion. Annoyed with his plan's failure, he goes to see if Chango successfully killed his father. Dwayne finds his dad on the floor suffering from his gunshot wound and tells him about the tanning salon/brothel idea. His father is excited and tells his son that he is proud of him.\n\nThe final scene is at the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]] in Atlanta, where Kate is managing the special events program. She joins Nick and Chet, who are chilling out by the pool enjoying their new lives. The deceased Chango has been blamed for the bank robbery.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Nick Davis\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Dwayne \"King Dwayne\" Mikowlski\n* [[Aziz Ansari]] as Chet Flanning (Douglas Subramaniam)\n* [[Nick Swardson]] as Travis Cord\n* [[Dilshad Vadsaria]] as Kate Flanning, Chet's sister\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Chango, a hit-man who is an associate of Juicy.\n* [[Bianca Kajlich]] as Juicy, a lap dancer that Dwayne befriends.\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Jerry \"The Major\" Mikowlski, Dwayne's dad.\n* [[Brett Gelman]] as Chris, Nick's boss at a pizza restaurant.\n* Rebecca Cox as Sandra, a bank employee.\n* Rick Irwin as Mark the Bank Manager\n* Torey Adkins as Big Guy, the customer who gets shot in the leg during the robbery.\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place in [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], from July to September 2010, and a bank robbery scene was filmed at the vacant Ludington State Bank building\u2014most recently a [[Fifth Third Bank]]\u2014on James St. in [[Ludington, Michigan]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Ludington's James St. Old Kent Bank to Be Setting for Upcoming Ben Stiller Produced Film\n| newspaper = Ludington Daily News\n| date = August 2010\n| url = http://www.ludingtondailynews.com/news/51185-ludington-s-james-st-bank-to-be-setting-for-upcoming-ben-stiller-produced-film\n| access-date =August 18, 2010}}</ref> The film's screenplay was written by Matthew Sullivan and Michael Diliberti,<ref>[http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/04/08/aziz-ansari-cast-in-ruben-fleischers-30-minutes-or-less-film-inspired-by-real-events \"Aziz Ansari cast in Ruben Fleischer's 30 Minutes or Less film inspired by real events\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013103402/http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/04/08/aziz-ansari-cast-in-ruben-fleischers-30-minutes-or-less-film-inspired-by-real-events/ |date=October 13, 2010 }}.
