It centers on a clique of recent graduates of Washington, D.C.'s [[Georgetown University]], and their adjustment to post-university life and the responsibilities of adulthood. The film is a prominent movie of the [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] [[genre]]. It received negative reviews from critics but was a box-office hit, grossing $37.8 million on a $10 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nRecent [[Georgetown University]] graduates Alec, Leslie, Kevin, Jules, and Kirby arrive at the hospital to see if their friends Wendy and Billy are alright after a minor car accident caused by Billy's drunk driving. In the emergency room, Kirby spots medical intern Dale, his college crush, and strikes up a conversation. After Jules posts bail for Billy due to his [[DUI]], the group gathers at their favorite college hangout, St. Elmo's Bar.  \n\nEach character slowly reveal problems in their lives and relationships - Billy, a reluctant father trapped in an unstable marriage, has difficulty adjusting from his frat boy lifestyle, Wendy has a hard time getting over her feelings for Billy and staying independent from her family's business, Leslie is pressured by Alec into marrying him, but she feels they aren't ready and wants to focus on her career first, Kirby obsesses over gaining Dale's affections, Kevin is bitter over love and is struggling at his writing job, Jules is in debt while stressing over paying for her second stepmother who's on her deathbed, and during a private moment with Kevin, Alec confesses he recently had sex with a lingerie saleswoman and believes that marrying Leslie will keep him faithful.\n\nWendy invites Billy to have dinner with her wealthy family. While hanging out after dinner, Wendy reveals to Billy that she's still a [[virgin]]. They make out, and while tugging at her clothes, Billy makes fun of Wendy's [[Girdle (undergarment)|girdle]]. Fed up with being mistreated by Billy, Wendy insists they just remain friends and kicks him out of her family home. \n\nDuring a Halloween party at St. Elmo's, Billy is performing with his band, Wendy brings a date set up by her parents to try and move on from Billy, and Jules reveals to Leslie that she is having an affair with her married boss. Billy's wife Felicia arrives at the party with another man, prompting Billy to attack him mid-performance and getting thrown out. Billy and Felicia have a heated argument outside the bar, but quickly reconcile. The next day, Leslie and Wendy confront Jules over her affair, but she reassures them that it's not gonna be a problem.\n\nKirby takes a job working for Mr. Kim Sung Ho, a wealthy Korean businessman, and invites Dale to a party that he's holding at Mr. Kim's mansion. When Dale doesn't arrive, Kirby leaves to try and find her. In the middle of the party, Alec announces that he and Leslie are engaged. Upset over the sudden announcement, Leslie confronts Alec and asks him about his infidelity, leading Alec to attack Kevin, accusing him of telling Leslie about his affair. Leslie defends Kevin, telling Alec that he never told her anything and that she had a hunch, causing Alec to break up with her. After the party, Jules gives Billy a ride home and he makes a pass at her. They make out for a bit, but Jules stops, wanting to talk about her problems. When Billy ignores her and continues his sexual advances, Jules angrily kicks him out of her car as Felicia witnesses the confrontation.\n\nLeslie goes to Kevin and Kirby's apartment to spend the night after the break up. The two of them drink and Kevin drunkenly confesses that he has always been in love with Leslie, and they end up having sex. Alec visits the apartment the next day to apologize to Kevin and talk about the break up, but finds out that Leslie and Kevin slept together, and angrily walks out.\n\nKirby ends up at a ski lodge where Dale is staying with her boyfriend. He tries to leave, but is invited inside the cabin when the car he brought gets stuck in the snow. The next morning, as Kirby prepares to leave, Dale tells him that she is flattered by his interest in her. He kisses her and watches as Kirby drives off. \n\nLeslie visits Alec at his job asking for his help in dealing with Jules. She tells him that Jules has been fired from her job and has been unemployed for three weeks, her affair with her boss is over, that she has fallen behind on her [[credit card]] payments, and her possessions have been seized. Jules locks herself in her apartment and opens the windows, intending to [[Hypothermia|freeze to death]]. Her friends attempt to coax her out, but she is unresponsive. Kirby fetches Billy, hoping he'll be able to break in the apartment. Billy convinces Jules to let him in, and the two share a very tender moment, talking about the challenges of life and adulthood, as the rest of the group overhears the conversation. \n\nBilly visits Wendy, who has moved in to her own apartment, and tells her about the incident. Billy also informs her that he has gotten a divorce and is moving to New York to become a musician. Billy asks Wendy for a going away present and they sleep together. At the bus station, the group gathers to say goodbye to Billy. On the walk home, Leslie decides that she should focus on herself first, and Alec and Kevin make up. They end up outside St. Elmo's bar to drink, but decide to meet for Sunday brunch at [[Houlihan's]] instead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Kirby Keager, a law student and waiter at St. Elmo's Bar.\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as William \"Billy\" Hicks, a saxophonist \"frat boy\" and reluctant husband and father.\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Kevin Dolenz, a writer for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' with a sullen streak, and Kirby's roommate.\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Julianna \"Jules\" Van Patten, an international banker and the \"party girl\" of the group.\n* [[Judd Nelson]] as Alec Newbury, a [[yuppie]] pursuing a career in politics.\n* [[Ally Sheedy]] as Leslie Hunter, a budding architect who is reluctant to marry Alec.\n* [[Mare Winningham]] as Wendy Beamish, a social worker from a wealthy family and devoted to helping others.\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Dale Biberman, a hospital intern and the object of Kirby's affection.\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Mr. Beamish, Wendy's father.\n* [[Joyce Van Patten]] as Mrs. Beamish, Wendy's mother.\n* [[Jenny Wright]] as Felicia Hicks, Billy\u2019s wife.\n* [[Blake Clark]] as Wally\n* Jon Cutler as Howie Krantz, an employee at Wendy's family business who becomes interested in Wendy.\n* [[Matthew Laurance]] as Ron Dellasandro, Jules' gay neighbor.\n* [[Gina Hecht]] as Judith, Dale's roommate.\n* [[Anna Maria Horsford]] as Naomi, a prostitute that picks up men near Kevin and Kirby's apartment.\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film was announced in July 1984.
