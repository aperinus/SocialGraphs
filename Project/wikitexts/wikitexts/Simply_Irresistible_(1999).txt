It is [[Regency Enterprises]]' first film to be released by [[20th Century Fox]], instead of [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nAmanda Shelton inherits her late mother's [[restaurant]], but lacks the [[Cooking|ability to cook]]. The restaurant is failing when Amanda meets a mysterious and possibly magical man at the local market. He introduces himself as Gene O'Reilly and claims to be an old friend of her mother's. He sells her [[crab]]s, one of which escapes cooking to become her personal [[mascot]]. While chasing the crab, Amanda meets Tom Bartlett, a [[department store]] manager at [[Henri Bendel]] on [[Fifth Avenue]], who is opening an ambitious new restaurant inside his store. Though they are clearly attracted to each other, Tom is involved with a clingy but beautiful woman named Chris.\n\nLater that day, Tom and Chris are on their way to lunch, where Tom plans to break up with Chris, but the cab driver drops them at the wrong location\u2014 Amanda's restaurant, the Southern Cross. Tom sees Amanda outside, and decides they should have lunch there instead.\n\nFor unclear reasons, Amanda begins cooking her feelings into her food, and she miraculously becomes an impressive, creative chef. She makes a crab dish for Tom that is so delicious he's unbothered. Chris, driven by Amanda's negative feelings toward her cooked into her own food, breaks up with Tom and begins smashing plates in the restaurant.\n\nAmanda visits Tom at Henri Bendel so that he can replace the plates that Chris broke. When he shows her the space where the new restaurant will be, they have a shared fantasy wherein they dance flirtatiously and they begin a romance.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom's assistant Lois begins romancing Jonathan Bendel, the owner of Henri Bendel, seducing him after feeding him [[eclair]]s from Amanda's restaurant, which Amanda baked her passion for Tom into.\n\nAs a result of her food improving overnight, the Southern Cross becomes increasingly successful. One night, Tom visits Amanda after the restaurant has closed and after tasting a dish of hers, they begin to kiss and start floating. Tom panics and breaks things off with Amanda, believing she is some kind of [[witch]] who is manipulating his feelings with [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].\n\nWhen Amanda goes to confront Tom one last time at his office, she witnesses the violent [[tantrum]] and [[resignation]] of a celebrity [[France|French]] [[chef]] hired for Tom's new restaurant. When Jonathan realizes that Amanda cooked the eclairs Lois had fed him, he demands that Tom hire her for the opening, despite his protests.\n\nOn opening night, Amanda is initially shunned by the snobbish French staff and that, coupled with her continued [[Broken heart|heartbreak]] over Tom, causes her to unknowingly cook her sorrow into one of the first courses, causing the entire restaurant to sob uncontrollably. She eventually overcomes her [[self-doubt]] and reaches her full potential as a chef, and the opening is a complete success.\n\nStunned but enchanted by the remarkable effect Amanda's food has had on the guests, Tom goes after Amanda as she's leaving the opening. He convinces her to come back and admits his love for her, and the two reconcile on the dance floor, not noticing Gene is gleefully conducting the orchestra behind them, implying the magic that sparked in Amanda came from him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Amanda Shelton\n* [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] as Tom Bartlett\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Lois McNally\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Jonathan Bendel\n* [[Christopher Durang]] as Gene O'Reilly\n* [[Larry Gilliard Jr.]] as Nolan Traynor\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Aunt Stella\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Chris\n* [[Gabriel Macht]] as Charlie\n\n==Production==\n\nAccording to Mark Tarlov, the director, the conception of the film arose from \"intersection of eating and drinking and romance [...] part of my interest with the movie was this idea of being able to bend reality. How food and wine actually bends time and space [...] the whole [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] view of bending time and space based on your position relative to the events that are happening.\"<ref name=slash>{{Cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/mark-tarlov-simply-irresistible-interview/2 |title=Conversation with Mark Tarlov, Director of Simply Irresistible [HDTGM] |date=July 4, 2016 |website=slashfilm.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704031532/http://www.slashfilm.com/mark-tarlov-simply-irresistible-interview/2 |archive-date=2016-07-04 }}</ref>\n\nTarlov's wife, Judith Roberts, wrote the screenplay based on a story co-developed by Roberts and Tarlov.<ref name=slash/> According to Tarlov, \"the script was about a middle-aged young woman [...] who had never found romance before because she never found her passion. And when she found her passion\u2014which was cooking\u2014romance followed.\"<ref name=slash/>\n\nThe director pitched the film to [[Holly Hunter]], who he intended to play the lead role, but the studio did not want her to play the part. [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] was then wanted, but the studio felt she was too old for the part. The character was then rewritten to a 20 year old woman with [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] landing the role. The studio wanted to cash in on her success from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\n''Simply Irresistible'' was poorly received by critics. Though the acting has received praise, the screenplay has received criticism. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 16%, based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 3.95/10.
