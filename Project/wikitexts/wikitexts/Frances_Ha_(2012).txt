Gerwig also plays the title role, a struggling 27-year-old dancer. The film premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 1, 2012, and began a [[limited release]] on May 17, 2013. It was released by [[IFC Films]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrances Halladay is a 27-year-old dancer who lives in [[New York City]] with her best friend from college, Sophie. Her life is upended when Sophie tells her she plans to relocate from [[Brooklyn]] to [[Tribeca]], which Sophie considers her dream neighborhood. Frances, a struggling would-be dancer working as an apprentice at a dance company, is unable to afford the move and is forced to find someplace else to live.\n\nShe moves to [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] and shares an apartment with her friends Lev and Benji for a brief period. Sophie and Frances's relationship struggles as Sophie and her boyfriend, Patch, grow closer. Frances learns that the dance company does not need her to work their Christmas show, which means Frances can no longer afford the apartment. She visits her hometown of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] for [[Christmas]] where she sees her family and reconnects with high school friends.\n\nRachel, a fellow dancer in the company, lets Frances stay with her for a few weeks. During dinner with Rachel's family, Frances discovers that Sophie has quit her job at [[Random House]] and is moving to [[Tokyo]] with Patch. Frances, on a whim, decides to spend an uneventful couple of days in [[Paris]] that she pays for with a credit card. She returns to [[Vassar College|Vassar]], her ''[[alma mater]]'', to work as a waitress and summer [[resident assistant]]. Overworked and not allowed to take classes, Frances reads Sophie's blog of her life in [[Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nOne night, Sophie and Patch are at an alumni auction which Frances is waitressing for. Frances learns they are engaged and sees the couple get into a fight. She lets a drunk Sophie stay with her in the dorm room she's been given, where Sophie reveals that she suffered a [[miscarriage]] while in Japan and is unhappy in her relationship. Sophie goes back to New York City the next morning, leaving a note for Frances. Some time later, Frances returns to [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] in [[Manhattan]]. She laments her dire financial situation, her poor prospects as a professional dancer, and her increasingly strained relationship with Sophie.\n\nFrances eventually reconciles with Sophie and enjoys a modest but satisfying existence as a fledgling choreographer, teaching dance to young children, and as a [[Bookkeeping|bookkeeper]] for her former dance company. She starts exploring a potential relationship with Benji and rents her own apartment. Upon moving in, Frances writes her name down onto a slip of paper in order to mark her new mailbox. Her full last name does not fit, so she folds the paper to read: \"Frances Ha.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Greta Gerwig]] as Frances Halladay\n* [[Mickey Sumner]] as Sophie Levee\n* [[Adam Driver]] as Lev Shapiro\n* [[Michael Zegen]] as Benji\n* [[Patrick Heusinger]] as Reade \"Patch\" Krause\n* [[Michael Esper]] as Dan\n* [[Charlotte d'Amboise]] as Colleen\n* [[Grace Gummer]] as Rachel\n* [[Josh Hamilton (actor)]] as Andy\n* [[Maya Kazan]] as Caroline\n* [[Justine Lupe]] as Nessa\n* [[Britta Phillips]] as Nadia\n* [[Juliet Rylance]] as Janelle\n* [[Dean Wareham]] as Spencer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Frances Ha'' is directed by [[Noah Baumbach]] and written by Baumbach and Greta Gerwig. Gerwig, who also stars in the film, announced it in April 2012, though Baumbach's involvement was not revealed until the film's listing in the [[Telluride Film Festival]]'s lineup. Gerwig had starred in Baumbach's 2010 film ''[[Greenberg (film)|Greenberg]]'', and they decided to collaborate again.<ref name=\"rosen\" /> They exchanged ideas, developed characters, and eventually co-wrote the script. Gerwig has stated that she did not anticipate starring in the film as well, but Baumbach thought she suited the part. Filming locations included [[New York City]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Paris]], and [[Vassar College]], which is Baumbach's alma mater.<ref name=\"olsen\" />\n\nIn the bonus features of the physical media release, the filmmakers reveal that the film was shot both in the style of [[French New Wave]] cinema and with the tools of a student filmmaker. Even though the production had both the budget for and access to professional [[Arri Alexa|cinema cameras]] and lenses, they opted to shoot the entire film on the [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]], a consumer photographic camera that has a [[high-definition video]] feature. Instead of adapting professional cinema lenses onto the camera, as other cinematographers have done when working with that camera, the production team chose Canon L-Series prime and zoom lenses that were designed for photography. They shot most of the movie on a [[Canon EF 50mm lens|50mm prime lens]] and a [[Canon EF 70\u2013200mm lens|70\u2013200mm zoom lens]], rarely using the [[Canon EF 35mm lens|35mm]] and [[Canon EF 85mm lens|85mm]] prime lenses that they brought with them. These lenses lacked the mechanics and features common among [[Cine lens|cinema lenses]], which (when paired with the large \"[[Full frame (cinematography)|full-frame]]\" sensor) made it difficult to keep the image in [[Focus puller|focus]]. The benefit of using an incredibly small camera and extremely limited lighting equipment was that the production team could quickly and easily move around to different filming locations without attracting attention. Because the film did not spend money on large crews, elaborate sets, or visual effects, they could afford to shoot in [[Paris]], [[New York City]], and in California despite having a small budget.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe filmmakers included a number of pop songs in the film, including \"[[Every 1's a Winner (song)|Every 1's a Winner]]\" by [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]], \"[[Blue Sway]]''\"'' by [[Paul McCartney]], \"Chrome Sitar\" by [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]], and \"[[Modern Love (song)|Modern Love]]''\"'' by [[David Bowie]].<ref name=\"rosen\" /> ''Modern Love'' is featured in a scene in ''Frances Ha'' that is a remake of a sequence in [[Leos Carax]]'s ''[[Mauvais Sang]]'', where [[Denis Lavant]] runs through the streets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/frances-ha-and-the-pursuit-of-happiness|title=\"Frances Ha\" and the Pursuit of Happiness|last=Brody|first=Richard|date=2013-05-15|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|access-date=2017-11-15|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack includes a song by [[Felix Laband]] and references multiple French films;

And this is partly Gerwig's vision, too. No other movie has allowed her to display her colors like this.
