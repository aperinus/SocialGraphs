The Canadian-French co-production is a [[film adaptation]] of the [[1911 in literature|1911]] Belgian novel ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H. Rosny]]. The story is set in [[Paleolithic Europe]] (80,000 years ago), with its plot surrounding the struggle for [[control of fire by early humans]].\n\nThe film was critically acclaimed. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair|BAFTA Award]] for Best Makeup, and the [[C\u00e9sar Awards]] for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. At the [[5th Genie Awards]], the film was nominated in seven categories and won in five ([[Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Overall Sound|Best Overall Sound]]).\n\n==Plot==\nThe ''Ulam'' are a tribe of [[cavemen]]<!-- Source must be provided for specific terms such as Neanderthal etc. --> who possess fire in the form of a carefully guarded small flame which they use to start larger fires. Driven out of their home after a bloody battle with the ape-like ''Wagabu'', the ''Ulam'' are horrified when their fire is accidentally extinguished while taking refuge in a marsh. Because the tribe does not know how to create fire themselves, the tribal elder decides to send three men, Naoh, Amoukar, and Gaw, on a quest to find fire.\n\nThe trio encounter several dangers on their trek, including an encounter with the ''Kzamm'', a tribe of more primitive-looking<!-- Source must be provided for specific terms such as Neanderthal etc. --> [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]]. The ''Kzamm'' have fire, and Naoh, Amoukar and Gaw determine to steal it. Gaw and Amoukar lure most of the ''Kzamm'' away from their encampment. Naoh kills the remaining warriors, but not before being bitten on the genitals by one, which causes him agony. The three ''Ulam'' take the ''Kzamm'' fire and prepare to head home.\n\nA young woman, Ika, had been a captive of the ''Kzamm''. She follows the trio. She makes a primitive [[poultice]] to help Naoh recover from his injury. Later, Amoukar attempts to mount Ika. She hides near Naoh, who then mounts her himself in front of the other two males.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Travers|first1=Peter|date=May 31, 1982|title=Tommy Chong's Daughter, Rae Dawn, Launches a Fiery Quest for Her Own Career| url= https://people.com/archive/tommy-chongs-daughter-rae-dawn-launches-a-fiery-quest-for-her-own-career-vol-17-no-21/ |magazine=People|access-date=1 December 2018|quote=The rape scene with actor Everett McGill (Naoh) left her 'scratched, bruised and crying.

Naoh turns around, followed by the reluctant Gaw and Amoukar, and the band is reunited. After Naoh leaves the others to scout a village, he is trapped in [[quicksand]], nearly sinking to his death, but he is discovered and captured by the Ivaka, Ika's tribe. At first, Naoh is subjected to several forms of humiliation by the Ivaka. He is forced to mate with the high-status women of the tribe, who are large and big-[[breast]]ed. The petite Ika is excluded by her tribe, and when she attempts to lie near him later that night, she is chased away. The Ivaka show Naoh their advanced knowledge of [[Bow drill#Hand drill|fire-making with a hand drill]].\n\nGaw and Amoukar find Naoh among the Ivaka. They try to rescue him, but Naoh seems unwilling to leave. At night, Ika helps them knock Naoh unconscious and escape the camp. The next day, Naoh washes off the Ivaka body paint. He tries to mount Ika again, but she teaches him the more intimate [[missionary position]]. Not long before they reach the marsh where they started the journey, the three are beset by peer rivals from within the Ulam, who wish to steal the fire and bring it back themselves, but Naoh and his group defeat them using the Ivakan [[atlatl]]s, which are superior to Ulam weapons.\n\nFinally rejoining the Ulam, the group present the fire to the delight of all. But during the ensuing celebration, the fire is again accidentally extinguished. Naoh tries to create a new fire as he'd seen in the Ivaka camp, but after several failed attempts, Ika takes over. Once the spark is lit, the tribe is overjoyed.\n\nMonths later, Naoh and Ika prepare to have a child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Everett McGill]] as Naoh\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Amoukar\n* [[Nicholas Kadi|Nameer El-Kadi]] as Gaw\n* [[Rae Dawn Chong]] as Ika\n* Gary Schwartz as Rouka\n* Naseer El-Kadi as Nam\n* Franck-Olivier Bonnet as Aghu\n* Jean-Michel Kindt as Lakar\n* Kurt Schiegl as Faum\n* Brian Gill as Modoc\n* Terry Fitt as Hourk\n* Bibi Caspari as Gammla\n* Peter Elliott as Mikr\n* Michelle Leduc as Matr\n* Robert Lavoie as Tsor\n* Matt Birman as Morah\n* [[Joy Boushel]] as Sura\n* Christian Benard as Umbre\n* Tarlok Sing Seva as Tavawa\n* Lolamal Kapisisi as Firemaker\n* [[George Buza]] and [[The Great Antonio|Antonio Barichievich]] as ''Kzamm'' tribesmen\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing and characterization===\n[[artlang|Special language forms]] were created by novelist [[Anthony Burgess]], while patterns of movement and gesture were developed by anthropologist [[Desmond Morris]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Quest for Fire (1981) / Quest for Accuracy |url= http://www.moviejourneys.com/quest-for-fire-1981-quest-for-accuracy/ |website= moviejourneys.com |access-date=1 December 2018}}</ref> The more advanced language of the Ivaka was largely [[Cree language|that of the Cree]]/[[Inuit language|Inuit]] native people of [[northern Canada]], which caused some amusement among those in this group who saw the film, since the words have little to do with the plot.<ref>{{cite AV media| last= Annaud | first= Jean-Jacques |title= DVD Commentary | work= Quest for Fire | year= | publisher= }} Annaud also comments that his film was popular in [[Greenland]] where Inuit is also spoken.</ref>  The Ulam are portrayed as stereotypical, [[Neanderthal]]-style [[cavemen]]<!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc-->, in an intermediate stage of development compared to the ape-like<!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--> ''Wagabu'', on one hand, and the culturally more advanced ''Ivaka'' on the other.
