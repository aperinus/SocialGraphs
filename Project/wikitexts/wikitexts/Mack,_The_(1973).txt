Goldie's criminal ways contrast with his brother Olinga's Black Nationalist efforts to save the community from drugs and violence. With Slim as his partner and Lulu as his head prostitute, he organizes a team of women and quickly rises to prominence. His success catches the attention of Fat Man, the heroin kingpin that Goldie worked for before heading to prison, and Hank and Jed, two corrupt and racist white detectives. Goldie refuses to work for Fat Man again, and dismisses the detectives' requests to stop his brother from ridding the streets of drugs. As a result, his mother is assaulted which eventually leads to her death. Even though Olinga is disappointed in Goldie because he \"brought death to their house,\" he agrees to help him get revenge. They develop a plan with Slim to seek revenge, but their plans fall apart when Hank and Jed kill Slim at their rendezvous point. They reveal that they are responsible for Goldie's mother's death, causing Goldie and Olinga to kill them both. Realizing that one of his hookers, \"Chico\", snitched him out to Hank and Jed, he attempts to shoot her but then holds back and leaves. Oakland is now too dangerous and Goldie hugs his brother goodbye and heads out of town on a charter bus.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Max Julien]] as John \"Goldie\" Mickens\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as \"Slim\"\n* [[Juanita Moore]] as Mrs. Mickens\n* [[Carol Speed]] as \"Lulu\"\n* [[Roger E.

While staying in Oakland for two months, Campus met Frank Ward, a real pimp and drug dealer from Oakland. Max Julien's character of Goldie is based upon him. In order to shoot the movie, Campus needed Ward's permission, because many scenes were filmed in his territory. In exchange for his guidance and protection, Campus put Ward in the film. All of the homeless people, junkies, pimps and women in the film were supplied by Frank Ward.<ref>{{cite web|title=See Why Black Panthers Got Violent With Crew On \"The Mack\" Movie Set|url=http://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/see-why-black-panthers-got-violent-with-crew-on-the-mack-movie-set/|website=I Love Old School Music| date=23 March 2015 |publisher=I Love Old School Music}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Campus had Ward's protection, the film was also in [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] territory. During filming, Black Panther party members would throw bottles and trash cans from rooftops. In order for filming to run smoothly, an additional deal had to be made with Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, who were then put in charge of providing extras for the film. About halfway through the production of the film, Frank Ward was shot and killed while in his Rolls Royce. There was speculation that the Black Panthers were responsible for Ward's death, and the filmmakers and cast relocated to safer areas for filming. Despite the tension, the film's opening was shot in Oakland with all of the proceeds going to the Black Panthers' [[Free Breakfast for Children|breakfast program]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=David|last2=Rausch|first2=Andrew|last3=Watson|first3=Chris|title=Reflections on Blaxploitation: Actors and Directors Speak|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow|location=Lanham, MD|page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was screened in theaters in only about 20 mostly black communities. Distributors avoided theaters in predominantly white neighborhoods due to a belief the film would do better in black areas. Despite its low distribution, director Michael Campus has noted that the film outgrossed ''[[The Godfather]]'' in the cities in which it played.<ref name = \"Mack40\"/>\n\n==Alternate score==\nIn its original 1973 release by [[Cinerama Releasing Corporation|Cinerama Releasing]] and its 1978 reissue by [[Action International Pictures|AIP]], ''The Mack'' featured a score by [[Willie Hutch]], an artist and producer for [[Motown Records]]. In 1983, [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] reissued the film to capitalize on the resurgent popularity of [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Roger Mosley]], who was co-starring on the hit TV series ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'' PDC commissioned a new score by [[Alan Silvestri]] featuring vocals by [[Gene McDaniels]]. The reissue poster advertised a soundtrack release on [[Posh Boy Records]], but the album was released on the ALA Enterprises label; it is now out of print and highly collectible. To differentiate it from the original score, fans have referred to it as \"The Mack and His Pack,\" based on a catch phrase used on the reissue poster. When the film was initially licensed to [[Embassy Pictures]] for home video, it included the Silvestri score. The [[New Line]] DVD release restored the original Willie Hutch score to the film.\n\n==References in popular culture==\n* In a scene in the 1993 film ''[[True Romance]]'', ''The Mack'' is playing on a TV screen in the background when Clarence Worley (played by [[Christian Slater]]) confronts Drexl Spivey (played by [[Gary Oldman]]).\n*The film's theatrical poster is spoofed in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']] [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series, season 5)|fifth-season episode]] \"The Curse of Savanti Romero\".\n\n===References to soundtrack===\n* [[Dr. Dre]] sampled \u201cBrother's Gonna Work It Out\u201d in \u201cRat-Tat-Tat-Tat\u201d from the album ''[[The Chronic]]''.\n* [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] sampled \"Mack's Stroll/The Getaway (Chase Scene)\" in \"Superstar\" from the album ''[[Confessions (Usher album)|Confessions]]''. \n* [[Chance the Rapper]] sampled \"Brother's Gonna Work It Out\" in \"Lost (ft.
