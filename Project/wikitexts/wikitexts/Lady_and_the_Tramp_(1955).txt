The 15th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], it was directed by [[Clyde Geronimi]], [[Wilfred Jackson]], and [[Hamilton Luske]], and features the voices of [[Barbara Luddy]], [[Larry Roberts (actor)|Larry Roberts]], [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]], Bill Baucom, [[Verna Felton]], and [[Peggy Lee]]. The film was based on the 1945 ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine story \"Happy Dan, The Cynical Dog\" by [[Ward Greene]], and tells the story of Lady the pampered [[American Cocker Spaniel|Cocker Spaniel]] as she grows from puppy to adult, deals with changes in her family, and meets and falls in love with Tramp the homeless [[mongrel dog|mutt]].\n\n''Lady and the Tramp'' was released to theaters on June 22, 1955, to box office success. It was the first animated film to be filmed in the [[CinemaScope]] [[widescreen]] film process,<ref name=\"finch\">{{cite book|last=Finch|first=Christopher|chapter=Chapter 8: Interruption and Innovations|pages=234\u2013244|title=The Art of Walt Disney|year=2004|isbn=0-8109-2702-0}}</ref> as well as Disney's first animated film to be distributed by their Buena Vista division. It initially received generally mixed reviews by film critics, but critical reception for the film has been generally positive in modern times. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel, ''[[Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure]]'', was released on February 27, 2001, and a [[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|live-action/CGI hybrid remake]] premiered on November 12, 2019, as a launch title for the [[Disney+]] streaming service.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words in length. Current word count is 677 words. -->\n\nIn 1909, in a small [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] town, \"Jim Dear\" gives his wife \"Darling\" {{efn|We never learn their real names in the film. They only address each other by these terms of endearment, so others - the dogs in particular - do the same.}} a [[cocker spaniel]] puppy as a Christmas present. The puppy, named Lady, grows up pampered by her doting owners, and befriends her neighbors' dogs Jock (a [[Scottish Terrier|Scottie]]) and Trusty (an elderly [[Bloodhound]]). Meanwhile, across town, a stray [[terrier]]-mix named Tramp feeds on scraps and handouts, and frees his friends Peg the [[Pekingese]] and Bull the [[English Bulldog|Bulldog]] from the local [[dogcatcher]]. \n\nFleeing the angry dogcatcher, Tramp finds himself in Lady's neighborhood. He overhears a distraught Lady conversing with Jock and Trusty about her owners' suddenly-distant behavior towards her. When Jock and Trusty deduce this is because Darling is pregnant, Tramp inserts himself into the conversation as the \"voice of experience\", and warns Lady that \"when a baby moves in, a dog moves out\". Annoyed, Jock drives him from the yard. Tramp's words cause Lady to fret throughout Darling's pregnancy, but when the baby boy arrives, she is allowed to meet and bond with him, dispelling her fears. \n\nLater, Jim Dear and Darling take a short trip, leaving the house, Lady, and the baby in the care of Jim Dear's aunt Sarah, who brings along her two [[Siamese cat]]s Si and Am. Sarah dislikes dogs, and prohibits Lady from seeing the baby; later, the cats destroy the house, and pin the deed on Lady by pretending she injured them. Sarah takes Lady to the pet shop, and has a [[muzzle (mouth guard)|muzzle]] put on her; Lady panics and flees into the street, where she is pursued by three savage dogs, until Tramp intervenes to protect her. \n\nTramp takes Lady to the zoo to have the muzzle removed by a [[beaver]]; he then shows Lady his owner-free lifestyle, and they explore the town. The kindly proprietor of Tony's Restaurant gives them a spaghetti dinner to share, before they end the evening with a walk in the park.\nThe next day, Tramp tries to convince Lady to live \"footloose and collar free\" with him; despite liking Tramp, she decides her duty is to watch over the baby. As Tramp escorts Lady home, he stops to chase some chickens; the dogcatcher pursues them both, but only Lady is caught. At the [[dog pound|pound]], she meets Peg, Bull, and some other strays, who all know Tramp. They reveal he has had many girlfriends in the past, and claim that females are his weakness. \n\nSarah comes to claim Lady, and chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away. Jock and Trusty propose that Lady should marry and come live with one of them, to escape the abuse, but she gently refuses them. When Tramp arrives to apologize to Lady, she berates him for his many girlfriends and sends him away, too. Afterwards, Lady notices a large rat sneaking into the house through the baby's bedroom window. Her attempts to alert Sarah fail, but Tramp hears her barking, returns, and enters the house himself to save the baby. Lady breaks her chain and follows soon after. Tramp is wounded in the battle with the rat, but manages to kill it behind a curtain. During the struggle, the baby's crib overturns, and he begins to cry; Sarah comes to investigate, and assumes the dogs attacked the baby. \n\nJim Dear and Darling return home to find that Sarah has locked Lady in the cellar and handed Tramp over to the dogcatcher to be euthanized. Disbelieving Sarah's story, Jim Dear frees Lady, who immediately shows them the dead rat. Overhearing the truth, Jock and Trusty pursue the dogcatcher's cart and try to stop it; the horses spook, causing the cart to crash. Jim Dear and Darling arrive with Lady to rescue Tramp, but Trusty is badly injured in the wreck.\n\nLater, at Christmastime, Tramp has become an official part of the family, and he and Lady have four little puppies of their own. Jock and a mostly-healed Trusty visit the family; the puppies now provide Trusty a new audience for his old stories, but he has forgotten them, much \nto his and everyone else's amusement.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Barbara Luddy]] as Lady, an [[American Cocker Spaniel]], who is the primary character in the film. A Christmas present to Darling from Jim Dear, she quickly becomes the center of their lives, but is then partly displaced by the birth of a human baby who she comes to love devotedly. Her experiences outside the household, and her encounter with Tramp force her to question the nature of her relationship with her humans (who she never sees as her owners), and give her a new understanding of the world around her, full of animals and humans, pleasures and dangers.\n* [[Larry Roberts (actor)|Larry Roberts]] as Tramp<!-- see talk page about character name -->, a mixed breed dog of apparent [[Terrier]] ancestry, with a knack for dodging dog-catchers. He calls Lady \"Pidge\", short for Pigeon, which he calls her owing to her [[naivety]]. He never refers to himself by name, although most of the film's canine cast refer to him as the Tramp. It is not until the sequel in which any humans call him Tramp, and it is never explained why they \"name\" him with the very name he was known by on the streets. Tramp had other names in the film, and when asked by Lady about having a family, Tramp states that he has, \"One for every day of the week. Point is, none of them have me.\" Each family mentioned called him a different name (such as Mike or Fritzi). The families also had different nationalities (such as Irish or German). As he did not belong to a single-family, Tramp implied that it was easier than the baby problems Lady was going through at the time.\n* [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]] as Jock, a [[Scottish Terrier]] who is one of Lady's neighbors. Thompson also voiced Joe, Tony's assistant chef; Bull, a stray male [[bulldog]] from the dog pound who speaks with a slight Cockney accent; Dachsie, a stray male [[dachshund]] at the dog pound who speaks with a German accent; an Irish-accented policeman; and Jim's friend.\n* Bill Baucom as Trusty, a [[bloodhound]] who used to track criminals with his Grandpappy, Old Reliable, until he lost his sense of smell.\n* [[Verna Felton]] as Aunt Sarah, Jim Dear's aunt (revealed to be the sister of Jim Dear's mother in Ward Greene's novelization of the film) who comes to take care of the baby when Jim Dear and Darling leave for a few days. She is a well-meaning busybody of a maiden aunt who adores her Siamese cats but does not believe that dogs should be around babies. She blames both Lady and Tramp for the baby's crib being knocked over, not knowing that they were actually protecting the baby from a vicious rat. However, she sends a box of dog biscuits for Christmas in the final scene of the film in a presumed attempt to make amends for her mistreatment of the two dogs.\n* [[George Givot]] as Tony, the owner and chef of Tony's [[Italian cuisine|Italian restaurant]]. He and Joe both have great affection for Tramp.\n* Lee Millar as Jim Dear, the fatherly human figure and Darling's husband. Millar also voiced the Dogcatcher.\n* [[Peggy Lee]] as Darling, the motherly human figure and Jim Dear's wife. Lee also voiced Si and Am, Aunt's Sarah's twin [[Siamese cat]]s with a knack for mischief and never-ending trouble; and Peg, a stray female [[Pekingese]] whom Lady meets at the pound (along with the other dog inmates she was put in a cage with). The names of Si and Am are a pun on the country of [[Siam]]. It is implied that Peg had a relationship with Tramp in the past, through the lyrics of the song she sings (''He's a Tramp''). Peg was formerly from the \"Dog and Pony Follies\" ([[dog and pony show]]); either the show ended or she was left behind. Peg has a [[New York City English|Brooklyn Accent]].\n* [[Stan Freberg]] as the beaver, a clever, hard-working beaver at the zoo who speaks with a lisp. He gnaws off the muzzle that Aunt Sarah had placed upon Lady after Tramp realizes that the muzzle is just what the beaver needs for pulling logs. This character would later serve as the inspiration for [[Gopher (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Gopher]] from ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]'' (1966), down to the speech pattern (a whistling sound when he makes the \"S\" sound). Stan Freberg, who voiced the beaver in the film, had an extensive background in commercial and comedy recording voice-overs and soundtracks. On the 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD, he demonstrates how it was done and that a whistle was eventually used because it was hard to continue repeating the effect.\n* [[Alan Reed]] as Boris, a stray male [[Borzoi]] from the dog pound. He speaks with a Russian accent.\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as Al the alligator, an alligator that Tramp asks to remove the muzzle from Lady. However, he instead almost bites Lady's head off.\n* [[Dallas McKennon]] as Toughy, a stray male mutt from the dog pound. He speaks with a slight Brooklyn accent, like Peg. McKennon also voiced Pedro, a stray male [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] from the dog pound who speaks with a Mexican accent; a professor, and a laughing hyena.\n* [[The Mellomen]] ([[Thurl Ravenscroft]], [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]], Max Smith, Bob Hamlin and Bob Stevens) as Dog Chorus\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nIn 1937, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] story artist [[Joe Grant]] came up with an idea inspired by the antics of his [[English Springer Spaniel]] Lady, and how she got \"shoved aside\" by Joe's new baby. He approached [[Walt Disney]] with sketches of Lady. Disney enjoyed the sketches and commissioned Grant to start story development on a new animated feature titled ''Lady''.<ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Lady and the Tramp Platinum Edition DVD - \"Behind the Scenes: Story Development\"|type=Bonus feature|others=Eric Goldberg|year=2006|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment}}</ref> Through the late 1930s and early 1940s, Joe Grant and other artists worked on the story, taking a variety of approaches, but Disney was not pleased with any of them, primarily because he thought Lady was too sweet, and there was not enough action.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nWalt Disney read the short story written by [[Ward Greene]], titled \"Happy Dan, the Cynical Dog\", in the ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine, published in 1945.<ref name=\"archive\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Ward|title=Happy Dan, The Cynical Dog|journal=Cosmopolitan|date=February 1945|volume=118|issue=2|page=19}}</ref> He thought that Grant's story would be improved if Lady fell in love with a cynical dog character like the one in Greene's story, and bought the rights to it.<ref name=\"thomas\">{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Bob|chapter=Chapter 7: The Postwar Films|pages=103\u2013104|title=Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Hercules|year=1997|isbn=0-7868-6241-6}}</ref> The cynical dog had various names during development, including Homer, Rags, and Bozo, before \"Tramp\" was chosen.<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite web|work=Disney Archives|title=Lady and the Tramp History|url=https://disney.go.com/vault/archives/movies/ladytramp/ladytramp.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224175329/http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/movies/ladytramp/ladytramp.html|archive-date=February 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe finished film is slightly different from what was originally planned. Lady was to have only one next-door neighbor, a [[Ralph Bellamy]]-type canine named Hubert. Hubert was later replaced with Jock and Trusty. Aunt Sarah was the traditional overbearing mother-in-law. In the final film, she is softened to a busybody who, though antagonistic towards Lady and Tramp, is well-meaning (she sends a packet of dog biscuits to the dogs at Christmas to apologize for mistreating them). Aunt Sarah's Nip and Tuck were later renamed Si and Am.<ref name=\"archive\"/> Originally, Lady's owners were called Jim Brown and Elizabeth. These were changed to highlight Lady's point of view. They were briefly referred to as \"Mister\" and \"Missis\" before settling on the names \"Jim Dear\" and \"Darling\". To maintain a dog's [[perspective (visual)|perspective]], Darling and Jim's faces are rarely shown, similar to Tom's various owners in the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons. The rat was a somewhat comic character in early sketches, but became a great deal more frightening, due to the need to raise dramatic tension. A scene created but then deleted was one in which after Trusty says \"Everybody knows, a dog's best friend is his human\", Tramp describes a world in which the roles of both dogs and humans are switched; the dogs are the masters and vice versa.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> There was a love triangle among Lady, Tramp, and a [[Russian wolfhound]] named Boris (who appears in the dog pound in the final version).<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Lady and the Tramp Blu-Ray Diamond Edition - Deleted Scenes, Backstage Disney|type=Bonus feature|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film's opening sequence, in which Darling unwraps a hat box on Christmas morning and finds Lady inside, is inspired by an incident when Walt Disney presented his wife Lily with a [[Chow chow|Chow]] puppy as a gift in a hat box to make up for having previously forgotten a dinner date with her.<ref>{{cite video|title=''Walt: The Man Behind the Myth'': Pre-production of ''Lady and the Tramp''|year=2001|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Grant left the studio, yet Disney story men were continually pulling Grant's original drawings and story off the shelf to retool.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> A solid story began taking shape in 1953,<ref name=\"thomas\"/> based on Grant's storyboards and Greene's short story.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Greene later wrote a [[novelization]] of the film that was released two years before the film itself, at [[Walt Disney]]'s insistence, so that audiences would be familiar with the story.<ref name=\"backstage\"/> Due to Greene's novelization, Grant did not receive film credit for his story work, an issue that animation director [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]] hoped to rectify in the ''Lady and the Tramp'' Platinum Edition's behind-the-scenes vignette that explained Grant's role.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nSinger [[Peggy Lee]] not only voiced four characters but co-wrote six songs for the film.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news|last1=Weinraub|first1=Bernard|title=It's a Small World After All, Mr. Eisner|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/07/business/it-s-a-small-world-after-all-mr-eisner.html|work=The New York Times|date=August 7, 1995|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\nAs they had done with deer on ''[[Bambi]]'', the animators studied many dogs of different breeds to capture the movement and personality of dogs. Although the spaghetti eating sequence is probably now the best-known scene from the film, Walt Disney was prepared to cut it, thinking that it would not be romantic and that dogs eating spaghetti would look silly. Animator [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] was against Walt's decision and animated the entire scene himself without any lay-outs. Walt was impressed by Thomas's work and how he romanticized the scene and kept it in.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> On viewing the first take of the scene, the animators felt that the action should be slowed down, so an apprentice trainee was assigned to create \"half numbers\" in between many of the original frames.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Jones|date=September 1986|title=Willie Ito|work=[[Comics Interview]]|issue=38|page=49|publisher=[[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, the background artist was supposed to be [[Mary Blair]] and she did some inspirational sketches for the film. However, she left the studio to become a children's book illustrator in 1953. Claude Coats was then appointed as the key background artist. Coats made models of the interiors of Jim Dear and Darling's house, and shot photos and film at a low perspective as reference to maintain a dog's view.<ref name=\"backstage\">{{cite AV media notes|title=Lady and the Tramp Platinum Edition DVD - \"Disney Backstage\"|type=Bonus feature|year=2006|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref> Eyvind Earle (who later became the art director of Disney's ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'') did almost 50 miniature concept sketches for the \"Bella Notte\" sequence and was a key contributor to the film.<ref name=\"backstage\"/>\n\n====CinemaScope====\n{{Further|CinemaScope}}\nOriginally, ''Lady and the Tramp'' was planned to be filmed in a regular [[full frame (cinematography)|full frame]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. However, due to the growing interest of [[widescreen]] film among movie-goers, Disney decided to animate the film in [[CinemaScope]] making ''Lady and the Tramp'' the first animated feature filmed in the process.<ref name=\"archive\"/> This new innovation presented additional problems for the animators: the expansion of space created more realism but gave fewer closeups.<ref name=\"thomas\"/> It also made it difficult for a single character to dominate the screen so that groups had to be spread out to keep the screen from appearing sparse.<ref name=\"archive\"/> Longer takes become necessary since constant jump-cutting would seem too busy or annoying.<ref name=\"finch\"/> Layout artists essentially had to reinvent their technique. Animators had to remember that they had to move their characters across a background instead of the background passing behind them.<ref name=\"thomas\"/> Yet the animators overcame these obstacles during the action scenes, such as Tramp killing the rat.<ref name=\"finch\"/>\n\nMore problems arose as the premiere date got closer since not all theaters had the capability to show CinemaScope at the time. Upon learning this, Walt issued two versions of the film: one in widescreen, and another in the [[Academy ratio]]. This involved gathering the layout artists to restructure key scenes when characters were on the edges of the screen.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Lady and the Tramp Platinum Edition DVD - \"Behind the Scenes\"|year=2006|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Lady and the Tramp'' was originally released to theaters on June 22, 1955.
