It is the second installment of the [[XXX (film series)|''XXX\n'' film series]], and was produced by [[Revolution Studios]] for [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n[[Vin Diesel]] and [[Rob Cohen]], the lead actor and director of the original, had signed onto a sequel before the first film had opened, but both dropped out over scripting issues,<ref name=\"The Movie Blog\">{{cite web|title=Good Move! Vin Diesel turns down 'xXx 2: State of the Union'|date=16 June 2004|url=http://www.themovieblog.com/2004/good-move-vin-diesel-turns-down-xxx-2-state-of-the-union/|publisher=The Movie Blog|access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref> while Cohen worked on ''[[Stealth (film)|Stealth]]''. Cohen remained as an [[executive producer]]. [[Ice Cube]] took over the lead role as the new Triple X agent and Tamahori was brought in to direct, following the huge commercial success of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Die Another Day]]'', which he directed. Two different scripts were prepared for the film, and the one written by [[Simon Kinberg]] was selected; the other script featured a radically different plot.\n\n''State of the Union'' was a [[box-office bomb]] and it was criticized by reviewers, mainly for the performances, an illogical story, and overuse of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-based visual effects for most of the action sequences. ''State of the Union'' is the last film in the ''XXX'' film series to be distributed by Columbia Pictures, as [[Paramount Pictures]] became the distributor for its future films, starting with ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage]]'' in 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn [[Virginia]], unknown assailants breach into an [[NSA]] bunker beneath the horse ranch headed by Agent Augustus Gibbon who fends off the attackers before barely escaping with Toby Shavers. To find help and a XXX with more attitude, Gibbons meets with Lieutenant Darius Stone, a former [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]], who is currently 9-years into his 20-year sentence in [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|Leavenworth]] for disobeying orders and breaking the jaw of ex-four star [[Four-star rank|General]] George Deckert, who is now the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defence]]. The investigation into the attack on the bunker is led by NSA Agent Kyle Steele, who is informed that concurrently Xander Cage was apparently killed in Bora Bora.\n\nGibbons helps break Stone out of prison, who then sets himself up as their leader due to his lack of trust in Gibbons. Leading them to Washington, Stone meets with Zeke, his old partner in crime, and Lola Jackson, his ex-girlfriend, who now runs an exotic car shop. Despite having moved on, Lola agrees to let Stone, Gibbons and Shavers hide in her shop in exchange for the [[Pontiac GTO#1967|'67 GTO]] Shavers modified, and a promise that Stone wouldn't interfere in her life. Stone then infiltrates the NSA bunker, where Gibbons instructed him to recover a hard drive, whilst Gibbons returns to his house to recover evidence. However he is attacked in his house by Deckert and Sergeant Alabama \"Bama\" Cobb, who destroy the house and apparently kill Gibbons whilst covering up the evidence. Stone meets up with Gibbons' contact, Charlie Mayweather, to get information. Charlie directs Stone to a party where Stone recognizes that Deckert's bodyguards are members of his old SEAL Team, before overhearing Deckert getting into an argument with General Jack Pettibone [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|VCJCS]]. Stone goes to Charlie's safe house but is framed for the murder of General Jack Pettibone, who is apparently her father, realizing that she is involved.\n\nThe police arrive, and Steele arrives to talks with Stone before escaping. While Shavers hacks into [[the Pentagon]] to retrieve Deckert's plans, Steele researches Stone and discovers why he was in prison: Deckert ordered his SEAL team to start a fire to clear civilians, but Stone and half of the unit refused and mutinied, resulting in Stone punching Deckert and being court martialed. Stone infiltrates Deckert's troops aboard an aircraft carrier and discovers Gibbons alive, being held prisoner along with the rest of their SEAL team. Stone realises that the men who sided with him against Deckert 9 years ago are prisoners, whilst those who stayed loyal are Deckert's security. Stone's presence is alerted by Mayweather, forcing him to escape.\n\nAfter retrieving the plans, Stone learns that Deckert is not only corrupt, but is planning a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] against President James Sanford. Stone makes contact with Steele and shows him the plans. When Steele notes that his plans are not clear proof, Stone leaves in frustration, to Steele's initial disbelief. During a conversation with Deckert, Steele realizes Stone was right. He finds Stone and tells him that Deckert wants to kill Sanford and [[United States presidential line of succession|his successors]] so he can take Sanford's place as President, in opposition to Sanford's current plans to dismantle various military branches to focus on foreign aid.\n\nUnable to trust legitimate law enforcement, Stone, Steele, and Shavers enlist the aid of Zeke and his crew. Together, they rob a civilian truck secretly hauling guns and equipment for the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] under the guise of a cheese truck. They end up hijacking a tank, and Stone helps Steele infiltrate the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] building. A shootout starts, and Gibbons kills Mayweather. Deckert and Cobb abduct Sanford while he is making the [[State of the Union Address]], and with Gibbons now free they escape on a [[High-speed rail|bullet train]]. Lola arrives with a [[Ford Shelby Cobra Concept]], and Stone uses it to chase and infiltrate the train. He engages and kills Cobb before engaging Deckert, while Gibbons flies a helicopter which Steele extracts Sanford by. Stone jumps out after Gibbons derails and destroys the train, killing Deckert.\n\nThe story is covered up, and Deckert is buried and branded as a hero. Sanford awards Steele and the unknown soldier (Stone) the [[Medal of Honor]]. Stone is officially released from prison, and making good on his promise not to interfere with Lola's life, says his goodbyes and goes back to his former lifestyle. In the now-rebuilt NSA Headquarters, Gibbons, Steele, and Shavers discuss what kind of person the next Triple X agent should be.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Darius Stone \n* [[Samuel L.
