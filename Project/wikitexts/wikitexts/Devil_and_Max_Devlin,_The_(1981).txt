This film was one of three that influenced Disney to establish [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] and [[Hollywood Pictures]] as an avenue to produce and release films for mature audiences.\n\n== Plot ==\nMax Devlin is the shady landlord of a rundown slum in Los Angeles.  While running to escape his angry tenants after one of them blurts out that he owns the building, Max is killed by a bus and descends into hell, which resembles a corporate headquarters.  He meets souls manager Barney Satin, the devil's chief henchman, who tells him that he will set him free if he can get three innocent youngsters to sell their souls in exchange for his own.  Max agrees and is returned to life, but Barney retains Max's soul, and consequently Max cannot see himself in a mirror.  Barney even gives him limited magical powers to help achieve his goal; he tells Max that if he succeeds, his soul will be free and the subjects will continue to live until the natural end of their lives.  Alive again, Max begins his frantic quest, and Barney, whom only Max can see, appears frequently to check on Max's progress \u2013 and to taunt him.\n\nMax's three targets are Stella Summers, a high school dropout and aspiring singer; Nerve Nordlinger, a student who dreams of being popular; and Toby Hart, a child who longs for his widowed mother Penny to find happiness again.  Max charms his way into each of their lives by landing a recording contract for Stella, training Nerve as a motorbike racer after school, and spending time with Toby while helping Penny operate a day care facility.  Max begins to care for all three of his subjects and discovers his innate decency. He even falls in love with Penny, but finds it difficult to get them to sign away their souls.  Stella refuses to sign, believing that Max is trying to get more than his 20% fee as her manager, Nerve is too focused on training for an important race, and Toby refuses to sign unless Max marries Penny.\n\nEventually Max obtains all three signatures, and upon signing, their personalities immediately change for the worse.  After Max and Penny wed, Barney appears and reveals that all three of them will die at midnight, and though Max gets to live until the natural end of his own life, he is still damned. Angered at the lie, Max is ready to destroy the contracts, and Barney whisks Max back to hell revealing his true demonic form, threatening Max with even greater torment if he destroys the contracts.  Knowing he is already condemned, Max throws the papers into a nearby fire, but he is quickly returned to life.\n\nBelieving himself still damned, Max leaves his wedding reception to say goodbye to Nerve and Stella, and finds that their personalities have returned to normal.  When he comes back to say goodbye to Toby and Penny, he is overjoyed when he can again see himself in a mirror, surmising that by his self-sacrifice he has been redeemed and Barney is defeated. He looks toward Heaven and gives thanks as he attends one of Stella's concerts with Penny and Toby.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Max Devlin\n* [[Bill Cosby]] as Barney Satin\n* [[Susan Anspach]] as Penny Hart\n* [[Adam Rich]] as Toby Hart\n* [[Julie Budd]] as Stella Summers\n* [[Sonny Shroyer]] as Big Billy Hunniker\n* David Knell as Nerve Nordlinger\n* [[Chuck Shamata]] as Jerry Nadler\n* [[Ronnie Schell]] as Greg Weems\n* [[Reggie Nalder]] as Chairman of Devil's Council\n\n== Production ==\nThe film started its life much differently than it ended up: originally, screenwriter [[Jimmy Sangster]] conceived it in 1973 as a [[Hammer Films]] horror film called ''The Fairytale Man'' with [[Vincent Price]] as a dead actor who collects children's souls for the Devil,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lindbergs |first1=Kimberly |title=Unfinished Films: Where Can I Buy My Ticket? |url=http://streamline.filmstruck.com/2014/03/13/unfinished-films-where-can-i-buy-my-ticket/ |website=Filmstruck |accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> but it went into turnaround when producer [[Harold Cohen (producer)|Harold Cohen]], who produced two TV movies based on Sangster's other novels, could not raise money for it. Sangster bought the rights back and sold it to [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]].<ref name=\"Hammer Complete\">{{cite book |last1=Maxford |first1=Howard |title=Hammer Complete: The films, the personnel, the company |date=2019 |publisher=McFarland Publishing |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |isbn=978-1-4766-7007-2 |page=896 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfp1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA896 |accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> Studio head [[Ron W. Miller]] hired [[Mary Rodgers]] to rewrite it based on the fact that ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' (1976), whose screenplay she adapted from her own novel, had been one of the studio's biggest hits of a decade for which profitable and critically well-received new films were few and far between for them. The title changed to ''The Devil and Max Devlin'' to reflect both its Faustian origins and the studio's desire not to be perceived as making movies that are only for children, while bike racing and music replaced the theater (despite that being what Rodgers' father, composer [[Richard Rodgers]], was most famous for), and instead of just children, the Devil wanted adults' souls as well.\n\nThis was the second of two films [[Elliott Gould]] made for Disney after ''[[The Last Flight of Noah's Ark]]''. Coincidentally, that film's plot line was also related to religion.\n\nThough he had declined previous offers from Disney due to rumors that they were unwelcoming to minorities, Bill Cosby and his wife [[Camille Cosby|Camille]] expressed reservations about a black actor playing the devil, Bill Cosby took the part because the role had already been previously played by white actors.  The film was shot on Soundstage 3 at Disney's Burbank studio where the underworld set used so many butane furnaces, dry ice, and smoke machines pushing the heat up to 100 degrees, the cast and crew could only stay inside for a limited time while shooting.<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Jim |title=To Hell With Bill Cosby?

[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film \"is neither the worst nor, certainly, the best of the lot.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (March 6, 1981).

D1, D13.</ref> As of August 2019 the film holds an 18% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 11 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/devil_and_max_devlin |title=The Devil and Max Devlin |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=August 1, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nIt was considered controversial for Disney, particularly for its darker subject material and Cosby\u2019s portrayal of a villainous character. It was also not a sizable moneymaker for the studio; it came in 45th place in the yearly U.S. box office race with a $16,000,000 gross,<ref>{{cite web |title=Box Office Mojo 1981 Yearly Box Office Results |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/1981/ |website=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> but an August 1981 article in the [[New York Times]] quoted [[Ron W. Miller]] as saying that it lost money.<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\" /> Although the film also was one of the earliest in a series of PG films designed to modernize the studio's image, this had a reciprocal negative effect when they received angry letters from longtime supporters of the company who objected to the profanity in the dialogue, claiming that [[Walt Disney]] would never have allowed it. In fact, he allowed characters to use the word \"hell\" in the feature films ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', and ''[[101 Dalmatians (1961 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'' and depicted it as a place in the short cartoon ''[[Pluto's Judgement Day]]''. This persuaded Disney to delve further into the idea of creating other labels to handle such family-unfriendly material, though it would be another three years before that actually happened.\n\nFirst released on videocassette in the U.S. in late 1981 and then discontinued for years in spite of Bill Cosby's renewed TV popularity because of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' (which started its eight-year run in 1984, the same year Elliott Gould's sitcom ''[[E/R]]'' came and went), [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] released the film on DVD on November 14, 2000, and [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] re-released it on DVD on January 17, 2006.\n\nIn the U.K., ironically considering the film's English origins, its 1981 videocassette debut caused a minor stir as it coincided with the growing uproar over \"[[Video nasty|Video nasties]],\" the press-generated term for films with gory violence and explicit sex. Anti-censorship campaigner Liam T. Sanford wrote a letter to the police [[watch committee]] about the film just to make a point about their criteria for pulling films, and they actually pulled it.<ref name=\"Horrorpedia\">{{cite web |last1=Flint |first1=David |title=Video Nasties: The Illustrated Checklist |url=https://horrorpedia.com/2014/02/27/video-nasties-the-complete-checklist/ |website=Horrorpedia |date=27 February 2014 |accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> The suspension was only temporary; the film had already passed the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] classification with an A rating in cinemas in 1981<ref name=\"BBFC 1\">{{cite web |title=The Devil and Max Devlin |url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/devil-and-max-devlin-1970-2 |website=British Board of Film Classification}}</ref> and again with a PG in 1987 for videocassette and 2003 for DVD.\n\nThough Jimmy Sangster received on-screen credit for the film's story but not the screenplay, he said of the experience: \"My only consolation in the affair (apart from the money) was the fact that I got to share a screen credit with the daughter of Richard Rodgers ... that's the Richard Rodgers who wrote all the great musicals. Would that his daughter had been as good a screenwriter as her father was a musician.\"<ref name=\"Hammer Complete\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|https://movies.disney.com/the-devil-and-max-devlin}}\n* {{IMDb title|0082263|The Devil and Max Devlin}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|devil_and_max_devlin}}\n* [https://www.dvdizzy.com/devilandmaxdevlin.html ''The Devil and Max Devlin'' at DVDizzy.com]\n\n{{Steven Hilliard Stern}}\n{{Jimmy Sangster}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Devil And Max Devlin, The}}\n[[Category:1981 films]]\n[[Category:1980s fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:American fantasy-comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Steven Hilliard Stern]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Works based on the Faust legend]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Buddy Baker (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films about singers]]\n[[Category:Films set in hell]]\n[[Category:The Devil in film]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jimmy Sangster]]\n[[Category:1981 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
