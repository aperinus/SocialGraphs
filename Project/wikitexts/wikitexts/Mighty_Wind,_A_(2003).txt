The film was co-written (with [[Eugene Levy]]), directed, and composed by [[Christopher Guest]].<ref name=\"A Mighty Wind\">{{cite web|url=http://alt.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/444606/Mighty-Wind-A/full-credits.html|title=A Mighty Wind|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|access-date=July 11, 2016|archive-date=July 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727115121/http://alt.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/444606/Mighty-Wind-A/full-credits.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The film is widely acknowledged to reference folk music producer [[Harold Leventhal]] as the inspiration for the character of Irving Steinbloom.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox |first=Margalit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/06/arts/music/harold-leventhal-promoter-of-folk-music-dies-at-86.html |title=Harold Leventhal, Promoter of Folk Music, Dies at 86 |work=New York Times |date=2005-10-06}}</ref> More broadly, the film parodies the [[American folk music revival]] of the early 1960s and its personalities.\n\nGuest co-stars and reunites many of his company of actors from ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', and ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best in Show]]'' for this film. They include [[Eugene Levy]], [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Fred Willard]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Jane Lynch]] and [[Parker Posey]].\n\n==Plot ==\nAfter fictional folk music producer Irving Steinbloom dies, his children Jonathan, Naomi, and Elliott organize a memorial concert, which they hope to feature his three most famous acts: [[The Folksmen]], The New Main Street Singers, and Mitch & Mickey.\n\nThe Folksmen trio \u2014 Mark Shubb, Alan Barrows, and Jerry Palter \u2014 were once the most popular of the acts but have not appeared together in decades. They had several minor hits, and their most famous song was \"Old Joe's Place.\" Despite not playing or seeing each other for many years, they diligently begin rehearsing for the concert. Although some tension arises over whether or not to include \"Skeletons of Quinto\", a convoluted song about the Spanish Civil War in their otherwise peppy set list,  they are clearly happy to be working together again. \n\nThe New Main Street Singers are the second generation of the original Main Street Singers, formed by George Menschell, the only living member of the original group, who sings and holds a guitar he cannot play. Performers include Terry Bohner and his wife Laurie, a former [[pornographic film|adult film]] star, now founders of Witches in Nature's Colors (WINC), a coven of modern-day [[witch]]es that worships the power of color. Another member is former juvenile delinquent Sissy Knox, the daughter of Fred Knox, one of the original Main Street Singers. Their manager is Mike LaFontaine, whose fifteen minutes of fame came via a failed 1970s [[sitcom]], ''Wha' Happened?'' The show lasted for less than one season and has largely been forgotten, but LaFontaine is constantly puzzling others by quoting his catchphrases, including the show's titular [[tagline]]. The group is known for their complex harmonies, forming what Menschell terms a \"neuftet.\"\n\nMitch Cohen and Mickey Crabbe appeared as Mitch & Mickey, a former couple that released seven albums until their dramatic break-up years before the events of the film. Mickey seemingly moved on and has married a medical supply salesman, but Mitch had an [[mental breakdown|emotional breakdown]] and has never fully recovered. Their most famous song was \"A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow,\" at the end of which the pair would kiss on stage. As Mitch and Mickey reunite and rehearse, romantic tension and personal regrets repeatedly threaten their participation in the concert. \n\nThe three groups, which had sunk to various levels of musical irrelevance since their respective heyday, agree to the reunion performance, to be held at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|The Town Hall]] in New York and televised live on PBN (a reference to [[PBS]]). The film features rehearsals for the show along with interviews with the performers discussing their activities over the previous years and their feelings about performing again. \n\nThe show itself goes off with only two hitches: The song that The Folksmen intend to open their set with is played first by the New Main Street Singers (a song called \"Never Did No Wanderin'\", which the Folksmen sing in a rugged, emotional manner consistent with the spirit of the song, while the New Main Street Singers perform it in their usual peppy, upbeat way), and Mitch temporarily disappears minutes before he and Mickey are to perform, forcing the Folksman to extend their set. It turns out that Mitch had gone to buy a rose for Mickey, which she gratefully accepts as they go on stage. Mitch and Mickey perform \"A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow\", and after a suspenseful pause, they do the much-anticipated kiss at the end. In the finale, all three acts sing \"A Mighty Wind\" together.\n\nThe film then jumps to interviews with many of the performers six months after the concert in which they detail subsequent events. Mickey is performing \"The Sure-Flo Song\" (about a medical device used for bladder control) at her husband's [[trade show]] booth. Mitch is writing poetry again, claiming to be in a \"prolific phase.\" Mickey claims that Mitch overreacted to their onstage kiss, while Mitch insists that he no longer has feelings for Mickey, but had worried that Mickey's feelings for him might have returned.  LaFontaine is trying to drum up interest for a sitcom starring the New Main Street Singers. He wants to call it \"Supreme Folk\" and have each play Supreme Court judges by day, folk singers sharing a house by night. The Folksmen have reunited, but Mark Shubb has realized that she is a [[transgender]] woman and has revamped her wardrobe. She continues to sing in her deep bass voice, followed now by a girlish giggle.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Mickey Crabbe\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Mitch Cohen\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Mark Shubb\n* [[Michael McKean]] as Jerry Palter\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as Alan Barrows\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Laurie Bohner\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Terry Bohner\n* [[Parker Posey]] as Sissy Knox\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mike LaFontaine\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Jonathan Steinbloom\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Amber Cole\n* [[Christopher Moynihan]] as Sean Halloran\n* [[Jim Piddock]] as Leonard Crabbe\n* [[Don Lake]] as Elliott Steinbloom\n* [[Deborah Theaker]] as Naomi Steinbloom\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Lars Olfen\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Lawrence E.
