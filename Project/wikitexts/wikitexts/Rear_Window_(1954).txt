B. \"Jeff\" Jefferies is confined to a wheelchair in his apartment in [[Greenwich Village, Manhattan]]. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and other apartments. During an intense [[heat wave]], he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool. They are a lonely woman whom Jeff nicknames 'Miss Lonelyhearts', a newlywed couple, a pianist, a pretty dancer nicknamed 'Miss Torso', a middle-aged couple whose small dog likes digging in the flower garden, and Lars Thorwald, a traveling costume jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.\n\n[[File:Rearwindow trailer 1.jpg|thumb|left|267px|James Stewart as L. B. Jefferies]]\n\nJeff is visited regularly by his [[socialite]] girlfriend, Lisa Fremont, and a nurse named Stella. One night after an argument with Lisa, Jeff is alone in his apartment and hears a woman scream, \"Don't!\" and the sound of breaking glass. Later that night, during a thunderstorm, he observes Thorwald making repeated late-night trips carrying a suitcase. The next morning, Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and sees him cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Thorwald also has moving men haul away a large trunk. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife, and shares this with Lisa and Stella, who believe him when they observe Thorwald acting suspiciously. Jeff calls his friend Tom Doyle, a [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] detective, and asks him to investigate Thorwald. Doyle finds nothing suspicious\u2014apparently, Mrs. Thorwald is upstate.\n\nSoon after, the neighbor's dog is found dead. The distraught owner yells and everyone runs to their windows except Thorwald, who sits quietly in his dark apartment. Certain that Thorwald killed the dog, Jeff telephones him to lure him away so that Stella and Lisa can investigate. He believes Thorwald buried something in the flower bed and killed the dog because it was digging there. When Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella dig up the flowers but find nothing.\n\nMuch to Jeff's amazement and admiration, Lisa climbs up the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and clambers in through an open window. Jeff and Stella get distracted when they see Miss Lonelyhearts take out some pills and write a note, realizing she is going to attempt suicide. They call the police but before they can report it Miss Lonelyhearts stops, opening the window to listen to the pianist's music. Thorwald returns and confronts Lisa, and Jeff realizes that Thorwald is going to kill her. He calls the police and reports an assault in progress. The police arrive and arrest Lisa when Thorwald indicates that she broke in to his apartment. Jeff sees Lisa coyly pointing to her finger with Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring on it. Thorwald sees this also and, realizing that she is signaling someone, spots Jeff across the courtyard.\n\nJeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message while Stella goes to bail Lisa out of jail. When his phone rings, Jeff assumes it is Doyle, and blurts out that the suspect has left. When no one answers, he realizes that it was Thorwald calling. Thorwald enters Jeff's dark apartment and Jeff sets off a series of camera flashbulbs to temporarily blind him. Thorwald pushes Jeff out the window and Jeff, hanging on, yells for help. Police enter the apartment, Jeff falls, and officers on the ground break his fall. Thorwald confesses to the police that he murdered his wife.\n\nA few days later, Jeff rests in his wheelchair, now with casts on both legs, and watches the neighbors again. The couple whose dog was killed have a new puppy, the newlyweds are having their first argument, Miss Torso's true love comes back from the war, Miss Lonelyhearts starts seeing the pianist and Thorwald's apartment is being refurbished. Lisa is with Jeff, reading a book titled ''Beyond the High Himalayas''. After seeing that he is sleeping, she happily opens a fashion magazine.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rearwindow trailer 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|James Stewart and Grace Kelly]]\n\n* [[James Stewart]] as L.

Set designers [[Hal Pereira]] and Joseph MacMillan Johnson spent six weeks building the extremely detailed and complex set, which ended up being the largest of its kind at Paramount. One of the unique features of the set was its massive drainage system, constructed to accommodate the rain sequence in the film. They also built the set around a highly nuanced lighting system which was able to create natural-looking lighting effects for both the day and night scenes. Though the address given in the film is 125 W. Ninth Street in New York's Greenwich Village, the set was actually based on a real courtyard located at 125 [[Christopher Street]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|author-link=Lou Lumenick|title=Inside the real Greenwich Village apartment that inspired ''Rear Window''|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/06/inside-the-real-greenwich-village-apartment-that-inspired-rear-window/|work=[[New York Post]]|access-date=21 November 2016|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the meticulous care and detail put into the set, careful attention was also given to sound, including the use of natural sounds and music that would drift across the courtyard and into Jefferies' apartment. At one point, the voice of [[Bing Crosby]] can be heard singing \"To See You Is to Love You\", originally from the 1952 Paramount film ''[[Road to Bali]]''. Also heard on the soundtrack are versions of songs popularized earlier in the decade by [[Nat King Cole]] (\"[[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]\", 1950) and [[Dean Martin]] (\"[[That's Amore]]\", 1952), along with segments from [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s score for [[Jerome Robbins]]' ballet ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'' (1944), [[Richard Rodgers]]' song \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\" (1932), and \"''M'appari tutt'amor''\" from [[Friedrich von Flotow]]'s opera ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]'' (1844), most borrowed from Paramount's music publisher, [[Famous Music]].\n\nHitchcock used costume designer [[Edith Head]] on all of his Paramount films.\n\nAlthough veteran Hollywood composer [[Franz Waxman]] is credited with the score for the film, his contributions were limited to the opening and closing titles and the piano tune (\"Lisa\"). This was Waxman's final score for Hitchcock. The director used primarily \"[[diegetic music|diegetic]]\" sounds\u2014sounds arising from the normal life of the characters\u2014throughout the film.<ref>DVD documentary</ref>\n\n== Release==\n===Theatrical===\nOn August 4, 1954, a \"benefit world premiere\" was held for the film, with [[United Nations]] officials and \"prominent members of the social and entertainment worlds\" at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City,<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/08/05/archives/a-rear-window-view-seen-at-the-rivoli.html|title=A 'Rear Window' View Seen at the Rivoli|work=The New York Times|date=August 5, 1954}}</ref> with proceeds going to the American\u2013Korean Foundation (an aid organization founded soon after the end of the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9835|title=Statement by the President on the fund-raising campaign of the American\u2013Korean Foundation|publisher=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]}}</ref> and headed by [[Milton S.

Additionally, she sees the \"[[male gaze]]\" as especially evident in ''Rear Window'' in characters such as the dancer \"Miss Torso;\" she is both a spectacle for Jeff to enjoy, as well as for the audience (through his substitution).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mulvey |first=Laura |url=https://academic.oup.com/screen/article-abstract/16/3/6/1603296?redirectedFrom=fulltext |title=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema |journal=[[Screen (journal)|Screen]] |year=1975 |volume=16 |issue=3 |publication-date= 1975 |pages=6\u201318|doi=10.1093/screen/16.3.6 }}</ref>\n\nIn his book, ''Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\"'', [[John Belton (academic)|John Belton]] further addresses the underlying issues of voyeurism which he asserts are evident in the film.

Driven by curiosity and incessant watching, with Jeff watching from his window, Lisa sneaks into Thorwald's second-floor apartment, looking for clues, and is apprehended by him. Jeff is in obvious anxiety and is overcome with panic as he sees Thorwald walk into the apartment and notice the irregular placement of the purse on the bed. Jeff anxiously jitters in his wheelchair, and grabs his telephoto camera to watch the situation unfold, eventually calling the police because Miss Lonelyhearts is contemplating suicide in the neighboring apartment. Chillingly, Jeff watches Lisa in Thorwald's apartment rather than keeping an eye on the woman about to commit suicide. Thorwald turns off the lights, shutting off Jeff's sole means of communication with and protection of Lisa; Jeff still pays attention to the pitch-black apartment instead of Miss Lonelyhearts. The tension Jeff feels is unbearable and acutely distressing as he realizes that he is responsible for Lisa now that he cannot see her. The police go to the Thorwald apartment, the lights flicker on, and any danger coming toward Lisa is temporarily dismissed. Although Lisa is taken to jail, Jeff is utterly mesmerized by her dauntless actions.\n\nWith further analysis, Jeff's positive evolution understandably would be impossible without voyeurism\u2014or as Robin Wood puts it in his 1989 book ''Hitchcock's Films Revisited'', \"the indulging of morbid curiosity and the consequences of that indulgence.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitchcock's Films Revisited|url=https://archive.org/details/hitchcocksfilmsr0000wood|url-access=registration|last=Wood|first=Robin|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1989|isbn=978-0-231-12695-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/hitchcocksfilmsr0000wood/page/100 100]\u2013107}}</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\n \nOwnership of the copyright in Woolrich's original story was eventually litigated before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Stewart v.

By this time, the film interested other directors with its theme of voyeurism, and other reworkings of the film soon followed, which included [[Brian De Palma]]'s 1984 film ''[[Body Double]]'' and [[Phillip Noyce]]'s 1993 film ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]''.
