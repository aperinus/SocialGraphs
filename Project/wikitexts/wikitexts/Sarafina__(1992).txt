(musical)|of the same name]]. The film was directed by [[Darrell Roodt]] and written by Ngema and [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]], and stars [[Leleti Khumalo]], [[Miriam Makeba]], [[John Kani]], Ngema, and [[Whoopi Goldberg]]; Khumalo reprises her role from the stage performance.\n\nAn international co-production of the South Africa, United States, France, and the United Kingdom, the film premiered on 11 May 1992, at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot centres on students involved in the [[Soweto Uprising]], in opposition to the implementation of [[Afrikaans]] as the language of instruction in schools.\n\nThe character Sarafina ([[Leleti Khumalo]]) feels shame at her mother's ([[Miriam Makeba]]) acceptance of her role as domestic servant in a [[whites|white]] household in [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]], and inspires her peers to rise up in protest, especially after her inspirational teacher, Mary Masombuka ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]) is imprisoned. In the opening scene, Sarafina is seen talking while staring at [[Nelson Mandela]]'s picture, at the time the South African icon was still imprisoned. In a later scene Sarafina is again talking while staring at Mandela's picture on the wall, criticizing him for being gone for a long time and not responding to the nation's pleas, idolising him as someone who can change the horrific situation that South Africa is in.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] as Mary Masombuka\n* [[Miriam Makeba]] as Angelina\n* [[John Kani]] as School Principal\n* [[Mbongeni Ngema]] as Sabela\n* [[Leleti Khumalo]] as Sarafina\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nProducer Anant Singh acquired the film rights to the Broadway musical ''Sarafina!'' After no Hollywood studio was willing to finance it, Singh raised the funds himself, with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] and the French company Revcom being among the investors. By the time filming started, [[Nelson Mandela]] was freed and [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid era|apartheid]] was abolished, though racial tensions were still high. Said director Darrell Roodt: \u201cThough our project is still confrontational and angry, it\u2019s told with more hope and a spirit of reconciliation.\u201d At the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, Whoopi Goldberg was announced to play Mary Masombuka; she was reportedly the first African-American actress to film a project in South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|date=1992-09-13|title=MOVIES : 'Sarafina!' in a Brave New World : Five years ago, the anti-apartheid musical appealed to the emotions; now comes the film, which also taps into the mind|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-09-13-ca-1493-story.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-09-16|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on location at [[Morris Isaacson High School]] in [[Soweto]], South Africa.

Singh told the press that the film would be a different tackling of apartheid than other films about the subject, where they were told from a white perspective. \"When people ask me why there is no good white in the movie,\" said Singh, \"I tell them that this is one movie that isn\u2019t about whites. Many of the actors have been arrested, had the police break down their doors in the middle of the night. Almost everyone had either first or second-hand experience with the movement. The kids in the cast were performing what they lived.\u201d Given the racism that was still prevalent in South Africa post-apartheid, there were concerns that the filming of scenes showing protests and rioting would fan the flames. To avert this, the prop military vehicles were emblazoned with the insignia \"Sarafina!\" to ensure the public that a movie was being filmed there.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the [[United States]], the film had some of the more graphic scenes removed to avoid a more restrictive rating.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] rated the film [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13]] for \"scenes of apartheid-driven violence;\" the Director's Cut, which was released on LaserDisc in 1993, was rated R for \"strong scenes of violence.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Search|url=https://www.filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=Sarafina&x=0&y=0|access-date=2021-09-16|website=www.filmratings.com}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Accolades===\nThe film was screened out of competition at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]], where it was greeted with a standing ovation.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/31/year/1992.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Sarafina |accessdate=9 September 2017|website=Festival-cannes.com}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Whoopi Goldberg mentioned on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' with [[Trevor Noah]] (who said the movie was a hit in South Africa), that the LA riots due to [[Rodney King]] happened at the same time that ''Sarafina!'' was released which hampered the film's chance of success in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Lullaby review|url=https://www.cinema76.com/home/the-lullaby-review|access-date=2021-09-16|website=Cinema76|language=en-US}}</ref> The film holds a 60% \"certified fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes.<ref>{{Citation|title=Sarafina!

The re-mastered director's cut is not very different from the original, except for the inclusion of one scene that was cut from the original, between [[Leleti Khumalo]] (Sarafina) and [[Miriam Makeba]] (Sarafina's mother), which includes a musical number \"Thank You Mama\".\n\n===Box office===\n''Sarafina!'' grossed $7,306,242 in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{Mojo title|sarafina}}</ref> It was the fourth-highest grossing film in South Africa for the year with a gross of $1.33 million.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Screen International]]|date=29 January 1993|page=27|title=South African top 10 1992}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0105316|Sarafina!}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|sarafina}}\n\n{{Darrell Roodt}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1990s musical comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1992 drama films]]\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Apartheid films]]\n[[Category:BBC Film films]]\n[[Category:English-language South African films]]\n[[Category:Films about race and ethnicity]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Darrell Roodt]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stanley Myers]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1976]]\n[[Category:Films set in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Gauteng]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Miramax films]]\n[[Category:South African comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:South African films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:South African musical films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
