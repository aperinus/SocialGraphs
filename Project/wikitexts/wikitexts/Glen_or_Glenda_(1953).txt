It was produced by [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]] who also made the exploitation film ''[[Test Tube Babies (film)|Test Tube Babies]]'' that same year.<ref name=\"Weldon, Michael 1983\">Weldon, Michael (1983). \"The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film\". [[Ballantine Books]]. {{ISBN|0-345-34345-X}}. Page 284</ref>\n\nThe film is a [[docudrama]] about [[cross-dressing]] and [[transvestism]], and is semi-[[Autobiography|autobiographical]] in nature. Wood himself was a cross-dresser, and the film is a plea for tolerance. It was widely considered [[List of films considered the worst#Glen or Glenda (1953)|one of the worst films ever made]] upon release. However, it has since been reevaluated and has become a [[cult film]] due to its low-budget production values, [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] style, and early cinematic themes of [[Transgender rights movement|transgender acceptance]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=April 2016}}\nA narrator, called The Scientist ([[Bela Lugosi]]), makes cryptic comments about humanity. He first comments that humanity's constant search for the unknown results in startling things coming to light. The cries of a newborn baby are followed by the sirens of an ambulance. One is a sign that a new life has begun, the other that a life has ended.<ref name=\"Craig\">Craig (2009), p. 30-68</ref><ref name=\"Radiation\">{{cite web|author=Banta|first=Mykal|date=June 14, 2009|title=The Unbroken Dream of Edward D.

The life which has ended is that of a [[Transvestism|transvestite]] named Patrick/Patricia, who has committed [[suicide]]. A [[suicide note]] explains the reasons behind the suicide. Patrick/Patricia had been arrested four times for [[cross-dressing]] in public, and had spent time in prison, so he ended his own life and wished to be buried with his women's clothing.<ref name=\"Craig\"/><ref name=\"Radiation\"/>\n\nInspector Warren is puzzled and wants to know more about cross-dressing, so he seeks the office of Dr. Alton, who narrates for him the story of Glen/Glenda. Glen is shown studying women's clothes in a shop window. A flashback scene reveals that a young Glen started out by asking to wear his sister's dress for a [[Halloween]] party.\n\nThe narrative explains that Glen is a transvestite, but not a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. He hides his cross-dressing from his fianc\u00e9e, Barbara, fearing that she will reject him.<ref name=\"Craig\"/><ref name=\"Radiation\"/> She voices her suspicion that there is another woman in his life, unaware that the woman is his feminine alter ego, Glenda.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The scene shifts from a speechless Glen to footage of a stampeding herd of [[bison]], while the Scientist calls for Glen to ''\"Pull the string. Dance to that for which one is made!''\", referring to the narrator pulling the strings of a hapless puppet who is not in control of his own destiny.<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\nAlton narrates that Glen is torn between the idea of being honest with Barbara before their wedding or waiting until after. The narrative shifts briefly from Glen's story to how society reacts to [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change operations]]. A conversation between two \"average joes\", concludes that society should be more \"lenient\" when it comes to people with tranvestite tendencies.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The story returns to Glen, who confides in a transvestite friend of his, John, whose wife left him after catching him wearing her clothes.<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\nLater, Glen/Glenda is walking the city streets at night. He returns home when the sound of [[thunder]] causes him to collapse to the floor; an extended [[dream sequence]] begins. Barbara is depicted trapped under a tree. Glenda fails to lift the tree, then is replaced by Glen, who completes the task with ease.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The dream then depicts Glen and Barbara getting married, where the [[Groomsman|best man]] is a [[devil]]. The sequence continues with a series of erotic vignettes containing [[BDSM]], [[striptease]], [[Lesbian sexual practices|lesbian]], [[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]], and [[rape fantasy]] themes. Throughout these vignettes, the faces of Glen and the Scientist appear, silently reacting to the various images.<ref name=\"Craig\" />\n\nThe dream returns to Glen in the midst of a jury of [[public opinion]]. A [[blackboard]] appears, with messages recording what the Scientist or the mocking voices said in previous scenes. The Devil and the various specters on the jury menacingly approach Glen. Then the Devil departs, Glen turns into Glenda, and the specters retreat.<ref name=\"Craig\" /> A victorious Glenda sees Barbara and approaches her, but she turns into a mocking Devil. Barbara starts appearing and disappearing, always evading Glenda's embrace. The dream sequence ends.<ref name=\"Craig\" />\n\nGlen/Glenda wakes and stares at his mirror reflection. He decides to tell Barbara the truth. She initially reacts with distress, but ultimately decides to stay with him. She offers him an [[Angora wool|angora]] sweater as a sign of acceptance. The scene effectively concludes their story.<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\nBack in Dr. Alton's office, he starts another narrative. This one concerns another tranvestite, called Alan/Anne. Anne was born Alan, a boy, but her mother wanted a girl and raised her as such. Her father did not care either way. She was an outsider as a child, trying to be one of the girls and consequently rejected by schoolmates of both sexes. As a teenager, she self-identified as a woman. She was [[Conscription|conscripted]] in [[World War II]], maintaining a secret life throughout her military service. She first heard of [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex change operations]] during the War while recovering from combat wounds in a hospital. She eventually did have a sex change operation, enduring the associated pains to fulfill her dreams. The [[World War II]] veteran becomes a \"lovely young lady\".<ref name=\"Craig\"/> Following a brief epilogue, the film ends.<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Ed wood glen or glenda.jpg|thumb|[[Ed Wood]] as Glen]]\n* [[Ed Wood]] as Glen/Glenda\n* [[Timothy Farrell]] as Dr. Alton/Narrator\n* [[Dolores Fuller]] as Barbara\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as Scientist/Spirit\n* 'Tommy' Haynes as Alan/Anne\n* [[Lyle Talbot]] as Inspector Warren\n* Charlie Crafts as Johnny\n* [[Conrad Brooks]] as Banker/Reporter/Pickup Artist/Bearded Drag\n* William M. A. deOrgler aka Captain DeZita as The Devil\n\n==Production==\nShot in four days, the film was loosely inspired by the [[sex reassignment surgery]] of [[Christine Jorgensen]], which made national headlines in the U.S. in 1952. [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]], a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] producer of low-budget films, commissioned a movie to exploit the case. Originally Weiss made Jorgensen several offers to appear in the film, but these were turned down.<ref name=\"rhodes\">\n{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = Gary D. | title = Lugosi: His Life in Films, on Stage, and in the Hearts of Horror Lovers | year = 1997 | publisher = McFarland| isbn = 0-7864-0257-1 }}</ref> Wood convinced Weiss that his own transvestism made him the perfect director despite his modest resume. Wood was given the job, but instead made a movie about transvestism. Nonetheless, posters for the film still claimed it was based on Jorgensen's case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wrongsideoftheart.com/wp-content/gallery/posters-g/glen_or_glenda_poster_03.jpg|title=\"I Led 2 Lives\" Based on the Lives of Christine Jorgensen|access-date=2017-08-10|archive-date=2021-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210708095308/http://wrongsideoftheart.com/wp-content/gallery/posters-g/glen_or_glenda_poster_03.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWood persuaded Lugosi, at the time poor and [[drug addiction|drug-addicted]], to appear in the movie. Lugosi's scenes were shot at the Jack Miles Studios in [[Los Angeles]]. He was reportedly paid $5000 for the role, although some stories state the actual amount was only $1000.<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> Lugosi is credited as \"The Scientist\", a character whose purpose is unclear. He acts as a sort of narrator but gives no narration relevant to the plot; that job is reserved for the film's primary narrator, [[Timothy Farrell]].<ref name=\"Peary\"/>\n\nThis was the only film Wood directed but did not also produce. Wood played the eponymous character, but under the [[pseudonym]] \"Daniel Davis\".<ref name=\"Peary\">{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon & Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 97\u2013101 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}</ref> His then-girlfriend, [[Dolores Fuller]], played Glen's girlfriend/fianc\u00e9e Barbara. Wood later returned to ''Glen or Glenda'' in his [[pulp novel]] ''Killer in Drag'' (1963). The plot features a transvestite called Glen whose alter-ego is called Glenda. He is executed in the sequel ''Death of a Transvestite'' (1967) after a struggle for the right to go to the [[electric chair]] dressed as Glenda.\n\nThe erotic-themed vignettes were not created by Wood. They were reportedly added by producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]]. He needed extra scenes to add to what he felt was an overly-short film.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> While not organic parts of the narrative, they seem to tell their own tales of gender dynamics and so fit in with the general themes of the film.<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The [[whip]]ping scene suggests a [[Master/slave (BDSM)|master/slave]] relationship. That the man is [[Top (BDSM)|dominant]] and the woman [[Bottom (BDSM)|submissive]], seems to reflect [[Chauvinism|male chauvinism]].<ref name=\"Craig\"/> The flirtatious and striptease-themed vignettes were typical of 1950s [[exploitation film]]s and [[grindhouse]] films, as was the rape scene.<ref name=\"Craig\"/>\n\nThe film has [[deleted scene]]s. In the theatrical trailer, included in [[laserdisc]] and [[DVD]] editions, the scene in which Fuller hands over her [[Angora wool|angora]] sweater, is a different take than the one in the release version \u2014 in the trailer, she tosses it to Wood in a huff, while the release version shows her handing it over more acceptingly. There is also a shot of Wood in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], mouthing the word \"Cut!\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/sinema-trailer_glen-or-glenda Trailer on Internet Archive]</ref>\n\nThe second part of the film, titled ''Alan or Anne'', is much shorter, told largely through [[stock footage]], and was made to meet the distributor's demand for a [[sex change]] film. Alan is a [[Intersex|pseudo-hermaphrodite]] who fights in [[World War II]] wearing women's underwear. After returning, Alan undergoes surgery to become a woman.\n\n==Release==\nDomestically, the film was [[Limited theatrical release|limited in release]], having been pre-sold to some theaters (under alternative titles such as ''I Led Two Lives'', ''He or She?'' and ''I Changed My Sex''). Internationally, the film was also limited, and in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], the title was translated as ''Louis ou Louise'' and in [[Argentina]] as ''Yo Cambi\u00e9 Mi Sexo'' (I changed my sex); the film had a brief <!-- A few minutes? A few days? --> screening in the [[Republic of China]].<ref name=\"rhodes\"/> It was re-released to theaters in 1981 by Paramount.<ref name=\"Weldon, Michael 1983\"/>\n\nAccording to Tim Dirks, the film was one of a wave of \"cheap teen movies\" released for the [[Drive-in theater|drive-in market]]. They consisted of \"exploitative, cheap fare created especially for them [teens] in a newly-established teen/drive-in genre.\"<ref>Dirks,Tim. \"Citing Website\" The History of Film - The 1950s: The Cold War and Post-Classical Era, The Era of Epic Films, and the Threat of Television, Part 1.

This led to ''Glen or Glenda'' being reissued in 1982. This cut included six minutes of additional footage. One of the restored scenes features Glen rejecting a pass made to him by a man.
