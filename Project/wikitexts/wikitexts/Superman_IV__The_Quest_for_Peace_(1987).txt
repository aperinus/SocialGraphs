A recording left by his mother [[Lara (comics)|Lara]] states that its power can be used only once. He returns to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where he finds the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' has been taken over by David Warfield, a tabloid tycoon who fires [[Perry White]] and hires his own daughter Lacy as the new editor. Following the news that the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] may engage in a nuclear arms race, Superman resolves it by collecting all nuclear warheads from various nations, placing them all into a giant net, and throwing them into the Sun.\n\nMeanwhile, young Lenny Luthor breaks his uncle [[Lex Luthor]] out of prison. Returning to Metropolis, Lex and Lenny steal a strand of Superman's hair from a museum and create a genetic matrix. Lex converses with black-market arms dealers, disgruntled about Superman's actions, wanting to re-arm the countries with nuclear warheads, and makes a deal with them to attach the hair to a nuclear missile. After the missile is test-launched, Superman intercepts it and throws it into the Sun. A glowing ball of energy is discharged, which develops into a superhuman. This \"Nuclear Man\" makes his way back to Earth to find his \"father\", Lex, who establishes that while his creation is powerful, he will deactivate without exposure to sunlight. A vicious battle ensues between Lex's creation and Superman. While saving the [[Statue of Liberty]] from falling onto the streets of New York, Superman is infected with [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]] by a scratch from Nuclear Man's radioactive claws. Nuclear Man kicks Superman into the distance with such strength that Superman's cape falls off.\n\nAfter the ''Daily Planet'', which has been reformatted as a tabloid newspaper, publishes the headline \"Superman Dead?\", [[Lois Lane]] angrily seizes Superman's recovered cape. Lois ventures to Clark's apartment where she proclaims her love for Superman. Felled by radiation sickness, Clark staggers to his terrace where he retrieves the Kryptonian energy module and attempts to heal himself. Having developed a crush on Lacy, Nuclear Man threatens mayhem if she is not brought to him. The encounter between Nuclear Man and the newly restored Superman is taken to the Moon, which ends with Superman being driven into the Moon's surface by Nuclear Man.\n\nNuclear Man forces his way into the ''Daily Planet'' and abducts Lacy, carrying her into outer space. Superman manages to free himself from the Moon's surface, then pushes it out of its orbit, casting Earth into an [[Solar eclipse|eclipse]], nullifying Nuclear Man's powers and leaving Lacy helpless in space. Superman rescues Lacy and returns her to Earth, then recovers Nuclear Man, who is now lifeless and deposits him into the core of a nuclear power plant, destroying him. What had been Nuclear Man becomes electrical power for the entire electrical grid. Perry White secures a loan to buy a controlling interest in the newspaper, making David Warfield a minority shareholder and protecting the paper from any further takeovers. Superman also recaptures the fleeing Luthors. He places Lenny in [[Boys Town (organization)|Boys Town]], telling the priest that Lenny has been under a bad influence, and then returns Lex to prison.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Christopher Reeve]] as [[Superman (1978 film series character)|Clark Kent / Superman]]<ref name=\"Easton\"/>\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as [[Lex Luthor]]\n** Hackman also provides the voice of Nuclear Man<ref name=\"yahooiv\">{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Owen |url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/what-happened-to-superman-iv%E2%80%99s-nuclear-man--153703667.html |title=What happened to Superman IV's Nuclear Man? - Yahoo Movies UK |publisher=Uk.movies.yahoo.com |date=2013-06-21 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130626064811/https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/what-happened-to-superman-iv%E2%80%99s-nuclear-man--153703667.html |archive-date=2013-06-26 |url-status=live |access-date=2022-09-29}}</ref>\n* Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man<ref name=\"yahooiv\"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Murphy |first=Steve |title=Superman IV: The Quest for Peace|website=IGN|date=2001-06-14|url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/300/300589p1.html|access-date=2010-10-11}}</ref>\n* [[Jackie Cooper]] as [[Perry White]]\n* [[Marc McClure]] as [[Jimmy Olsen]]\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Lenny Luthor\n* [[Sam Wanamaker]] as David Warfield\n* [[Mariel Hemingway]] as Lacy Warfield\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as [[Lois Lane]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Beck |first=Marilyn |title=Margot Kidder Flies Back To Superman|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=1986-06-26|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-06-26/features/8602150716_1_lois-lane-margot-kidder-shell-game|access-date=2010-10-11}}</ref>\n* Damian McLawhorn as Jeremy\n* [[William Hootkins]] as Harry Howler\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Jean Pierre Dubois\n* [[Stanley Lebor]] as General Romoff\n* [[Don Fellows]] as Levon Hornsby<ref>{{cite news |title=Superman IV: the Quest for Peace (1987) |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/140748/Superman-IV-the-Quest-for-Peace/cast |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103212749/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/140748/Superman-IV-the-Quest-for-Peace/cast |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 November 2012 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012 |access-date=30 January 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Robert Beatty]] as [[President of the United States|U.S. President]]\n* [[Susannah York]] as the voice of [[Lara (comics)|Lara]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and casting===\n[[Alexander Salkind]] and his son [[Ilya Salkind|Ilya]], the producers of the ''Superman'' series, planned to produce a fourth installment if ''[[Superman III]]'' grossed at least $40 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Superman IV: The Quest for Peace|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/57838-SUPERMAN-IVTHEQUESTFORPEACE?sid=25294c53-7642-454a-8c77-95a143365b5c&sr=6.600077&cp=1&pos=0|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-08|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> The film received an unexpectedly negative reaction but still grossed $80.2 million.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title=Superman III (1983) - Financial Information|url=https://m.the-numbers.com/movie/Superman-III|access-date=2021-06-08|website=The Numbers}}</ref> Reeve was also hesitant to return to the series as Superman, bowing out from a planned cameo appearance in ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Salkinds announced plans for a fourth film regardless, but after the commercial failures of ''Supergirl'' and their next film ''[[Santa Claus: The Movie]]'' caused them financial strain they began to consider if the franchise had run its course.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Mills\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter negotiations during the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival|38th Cannes Film Festival]], Ilya Salkind agreed to sell the ''Superman'' franchise to [[Menahem Golan]] and [[Yoram Globus]] of [[The Cannon Group, Inc.]] for $5 million in June 1985.<ref>{{cite news|title=UGO's World of Superman&nbsp;\u2014 Superman Movies: Superman IV: The Quest For Peace|publisher=[[UGO Networks]]|year=2006|url=http://superman.ugo.com/movies/supermanIV/default.asp|access-date=2010-10-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004233836/http://superman.ugo.com/movies/supermanIV/default.asp|archive-date=October 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Mills\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The studio enticed Reeve to return by offering him a $6 million pay, financing for his pet project ''[[Street Smart (film)|Street Smart]]'', and approval over the story and director.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nReeve pitched a storyline focused on the [[nuclear arms race]] in protest of the breakdown of the [[Reykjav\u00edk Summit|Reykjavik Summit]] and President [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2019s military buildup and skepticism towards [[arms control]].<ref name=\"Mills\" /> His story was accepted and he was also considered as the film\u2019s director.

Cannon Films had nearly thirty projects in the works at the time, and ''Superman IV'' received no special consideration. For example, [[Lawrence Konner|Konner]] and [[Mark Rosenthal (screenwriter)|Rosenthal]] wrote a scene in which Superman lands on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and walks down the double yellow lines to the [[United Nations]], where he gives a speech. If that had been a scene in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman I]]'', we would actually have shot it on 42nd Street. [[Richard Donner]] would have choreographed hundreds of pedestrians and vehicles and cut to people gawking out of office windows at the sight of Superman walking down the street like the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]]. Instead, we had to shoot at an industrial park in England in the rain with about a hundred extras, not a car in sight, and a dozen pigeons thrown in for atmosphere. Even if the story had been brilliant, I don't think that we could ever have lived up to the audience's expectations with this approach.}}\n\nRosenthal's DVD commentary cited this scene as an example of Cannon's budget slashing. According to Rosenthal, Reeve and Furie begged to be able to film that sequence in New York in front of the real [[headquarters of the United Nations]] because everyone knew how they looked and the [[Milton Keynes]] setting looked nothing like them, but Cannon refused. According to Rosenthal, they were \"pinching pennies at every step\".\n\nShortly before production began at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] on September 27, 1986, Cannon reduced the budget from $36 million to $17 million. Part of the problem was that Cannon financed its films by selling the [[television]] and [[home video]] rights in advance, which failed with  films of a budget of over $5 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The studio had also gone six years without a major hit. The studio was narrowly saved from bankruptcy after a deal with [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] to provide $75 million to repay its loans in exchange for distribution rights to its upcoming films, including ''Superman IV'', which provided enough confidence in the studio for a $65 million line of credit from First Bank of Boston.<ref name=\":0\" /> During the production the filming and special effects crews of the first three films were replaced with cheaper [[Israel]]i crews. Principal photography concluded at the beginning of January 1987.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTo keep production solely in England, Superman's childhood home in Smallville was reconstructed on farmland outside [[Baldock]] in [[North Hertfordshire]]\u2014despite the fact that the original farm from ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'' was still standing in [[Blackie, Alberta]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_supermaniv.htm|title=Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) Movie Filming Locations - The 80s Movies Rewind|website=www.fast-rewind.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supermania78.com/2010/04/behind-the-scenes-the-kent-farm-1986/|title=Behind The Scenes - The Kent Farm...|date=April 13, 2010}} {{Better source needed|reason=[[WP:FANSITE]]|date=November 2022}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Jon Cryer, who played Luthor's nephew Lenny, Reeve had taken him aside just before the release and told him it was going to be \"terrible.\" Although Cryer enjoyed working with Reeve and Hackman, Cryer claimed that Cannon ran out of money during the production and ultimately released an unfinished film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jon Cryer takes your iReport questions|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|year=2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/showbiz/2012/10/02/iri-jon-cryer-uncut-raw.cnn.html}}</ref>\n\n===Deleted footage===\nAccording to writer [[Mark Rosenthal (screenwriter)|Mark Rosenthal]]'s commentary on the 2006 DVD, in the gallery of deleted scenes included on the disc, there are approximately forty-five minutes of the film that have not been seen by the general public. They were deleted following a failed Southern California test screening. In fact, the Nuclear Man that appears in the film is actually the second Nuclear Man that Luthor created. Cut scenes featured the original Nuclear Man (portrayed by [[Clive Mantle]]) engaging Superman in battle outside the Metro Club and being destroyed by the Man of Steel.<ref name=\"yahooiv\"/> The first Nuclear Man was somewhat more inhuman-looking than his successor, and vaguely resembled in looks, and significantly in personality, the comic book character [[Bizarro]].

In place of a voice-over from Lara in the early scene involving Superman finding the mysterious crystal, there is a projection of Jor-El himself, much like in the first film. The comic book features a battle with the failed prototype of Nuclear Man resembling Bizarro and an around-the-world fight with the second Nuclear Man. The adaptation has an alternate ending with Superman and Jeremy flying above Earth, observing that the planet is, in reality, just one world, rather than the divided world one sees on a man-made map. In the adaptation, Jeremy is seen in orbit with a space suit but in the deleted footage he is not wearing any [[vacuum]] protection of any kind, as was Lacy Warfield when she was rescued from the second Nuclear Man by Superman. The alternate ending appears in the Deluxe Edition DVD, incorporated in the deleted footage section. There was also a book novelization written by [[Bonnie Bryant]], in which scenes based on deleted footage are included. \n\n{{Anchor|Novelization}}\nThe novelization was released in 1987, along with the premiere of the film.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hiller |first=B.
