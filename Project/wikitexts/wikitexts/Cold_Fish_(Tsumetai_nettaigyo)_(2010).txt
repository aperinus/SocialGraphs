''Cold Fish'' premiered at the [[67th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 7, 2010, and received the best screenplay award in the Fantastic Features section at [[Fantastic Fest]] 2010. The film was released as part of the [[Bloody Disgusting|Bloody Disgusting Selects]] line.\n\n==Premise==\nNobuyuki Shamoto is the quiet and unambitious owner of a [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]] shop specializing in selling [[tropical fish]]. His home life leaves much to be desired, as his daughter Mitsuko is rebellious and physically abuses her stepmother Taeko, his second wife. One night Nobuyuki is summoned when Mitsuko is caught [[shoplifting]] at a local supermarket. Yukio Murata, a patron at the supermarket, persuades the manager to drop the matter and invites Nobuyuki to visit his own, larger tropical fish shop. During an impromptu tour of Yukio's shop, Nobuyuki meets his wife, Aiko. Stating that fate brought the two men together, the gregarious Yukio convinces Nobuyuki to go into business with him. Yukio also takes on Mitsuko as a worker in his shop.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the exploits of two Tokyo serial killers, [[Gen Sekine|Sekine Gen and Hiroko Kazama]], a husband and wife duo who owned a pet shop and murdered at least four people.<ref name=\"Twitch\">{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/interviews/2011/01/screenwriter-yoshiki-takahashi-talks-cold-fish.php|work=Twitch|title= Screenwriter Yoshiki Takahashi Talks COLD FISH|first=Todd|last=Brown|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225052110/http://twitchfilm.com/interviews/2011/01/screenwriter-yoshiki-takahashi-talks-cold-fish.php|archivedate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mitsuru Fukikoshi]] as Nobuyuki Syamoto\n* [[Denden]] as Yukio Murata\n* [[Asuka Kurosawa]] as Aiko Murata\n* [[Megumi Kagurazaka]] as Taeko Syamoto\n* Hikari Kajiwara as Mitsuko Syamoto\n* [[Tetsu Watanabe]] as Takayasu TsuTsui\n\n==Production==\nFollowing ''[[Alien vs Ninja]]'' and ''[[Mutant Girls Squad]]'', ''Cold Fish'' is the third film to be released by [[Nikkatsu]]'s [[Sushi Typhoon]], their gore-themed series.<ref name=\"fba-review\" />\nDirector and writer [[Sion Sono]] was influenced by Japanese crime cases while developing ''Cold Fish'', specifically about an actual killing spree committed by a dog kennel owner in the 1990s (the story of the film involves a family of three that becomes entangled in a string of ongoing murders perpetrated by a tropical fish salesman in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]).<ref name=\"tokyorepoerter\" /> Sono also wanted to \"depict a sense of total hopelessness\" which he felt is \"lacking in Japanese films.\"<ref name=\"tokyorepoerter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2010/11/28/sion-sonos-cold-fish-nets-japan-premiere-at-tokyo-filmex/|work=The Tokyo Reporter|author=CJ|title=Sion Sono's 'Cold Fish' nets Japan premiere at Tokyo Filmex|date=November 28, 2010|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Cold Fish'' premiered at the [[67th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 7, 2010.<ref name=\"fba-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/cold-fish|work=Film Business Asia|title=Cold Fish (\u51b7\u305f\u3044\u71b1\u5e2f\u9b5a)|accessdate=July 11, 2011|date=September 10, 2010|last=Elley|first=Derek}}</ref> It was also shown at film festivals in [[Pusan]] and at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] where it received its North American premiere.<ref name=\"hwr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/notorious-japanese-director-sion-sono-42963|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Notorious Japanese Director Sion Sono Unveils Next Project|accessdate=July 11, 2011|date=November 8, 2010|last=Landreth|first=Jonathan}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/cold-fish-v525140|work=[[Allrovi]]|title=Cold Fish|last=Deming|first=Mark|accessdate=July 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129145039/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/cold-fish-v525140|archivedate=November 29, 2011}}</ref> ''Cold Fish'' won the best screenplay award in the Fantastic Features section at [[Fantastic Fest]] 2010.<ref name=\"hwr\" /> It was released in Japan on January 29, 2011.<ref name=\"fba-review\" />\n\n==Reception==\nFilm Business Asia gave ''Cold Fish'' an 8 out of 10 rating praising the actor Denden who without his \"tour-de-force performance...''Cold Fish'' may never have worked.\"<ref name=\"fba-review\" /> The review went on to state that \"Though there's considerable gore on display, it's largely cartoonish.
