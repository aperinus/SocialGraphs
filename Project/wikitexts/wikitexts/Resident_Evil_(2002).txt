S. Anderson]]. The film stars [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Eric Mabius]], [[James Purefoy]], [[Martin Crewes]], and [[Colin Salmon]]. It is the first installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]], which is loosely based on the [[Resident Evil|video game series of the same name]]. Borrowing elements from the video games ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', the film follows [[amnesia]]c heroine [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and a band of [[Umbrella Corporation]] commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-virus at a secret underground facility.\n\nGerman studio\u00a0[[Constantin Film]]\u00a0bought the rights to adapt the series in January 1997. Several writers and filmmakers, such as [[Alan B. McElroy]], [[George A. Romero]] and [[Jamie Blanks]], were initially hired to direct and write the film, but their scripts were rejected. In 2000,\u00a0\u00a0[[Paul W. S. Anderson]] was announced as writer and director. Developed as a [[prequel]] set in the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] as the video game series, the film was initially titled ''Resident Evil: Ground Zero'', but was retitled after the [[September 11 attacks]]. Cast was announced in early 2001 and [[principal photography]] commenced in March 2001 in [[Berlin]].\n\n''Resident Evil'' was theatrically released in Germany on March 12, 2002, by Constantin Film Verleih, and in the United Kingdom on July 12, 2002, by [[Screen Gems]] and [[Path\u00e9 Distribution]]. The film received generally unfavorable reviews from critics and grossed $103 million worldwide against a production budget of $33 million. It was followed by six sequels establishing their own [[Fictional universe|alternate continuity]]: ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|Apocalypse]]'' (2004), ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction|Extinction]]'' (2007), ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife|Afterlife]]'' (2010), ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution|Retribution]]'' (2012), ''[[Resident Evil: The Final Chapter|The Final Chapter]]'' (2016), and ''[[Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City|Welcome to Raccoon City]]'' (2021).\n\n==Plot==\nUnderneath [[Raccoon City]] exists a [[genetic research]] facility called the Hive, owned by the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates the Hive with it. In response, the facility's [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Red Queen and White Queen|Red Queen]], seals the Hive and kills everyone inside. [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] awakens in the bathroom of a deserted mansion with amnesia. She dresses, checks the mansion, and is tackled by an unknown person as a group of commandos led by [[One (Resident Evil)|James Shade]] breaks in. Alice's attacker is cuffed and then released when he claims to be Matt Addison, who just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. Alice and Matt are ordered to go down to the Hive with the group, where they find another amnesiac, Spence, hidden in their train. The commandos explain that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, and Alice and her partner Spence were assigned to guard the Hive's secret entrance under the mansion under the pretense of being married.\n\nAt the Red Queen's chamber, a laser defense system kills Shade and three more commandos. Despite the Red Queen's urgent pleas for the group to leave, Kaplan disables it, causing the power to fail and all of the doors in the Hive to open. This releases the zombified staff and containment units containing [[Licker (Resident Evil)|Licker]]s, creatures created through experimentation with the T-virus. The humans are attacked by the horde, and J.D. dies. [[Rain Ocampo|Rain]] retreats with Kaplan and Spence, and Matt becomes separated from Alice, who starts regaining her memories. Matt looks for information about his sister, Lisa, and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were environmental activists, and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Red Queen's chamber, where the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit; to force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown.\n\nAs they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before she shoots him dead. They reach safety except Kaplan, who is bitten and separated from the group. Alice remembers that an anti-virus is in the lab, but they find it missing. Spence and Alice remember that Spence was the thief who stole and purposefully released the T-virus, and hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence turns against the others but is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. Spence retrieves the anti-virus but is killed by a Licker set upon him by the Red Queen. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal that Kaplan shut down the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the anti-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.\n\nOn the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti-virus. The Licker, having hidden on the train, attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is attacked by a zombified Rain, the anti-virus having failed to cure her. He shoots Rain dead, and her head hits a button, opening a door and dropping the Licker under the train, killing it. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open, and a group of Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis Program]], and that the Hive is to be re-opened for an investigation into the incident. Later, Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table, and escapes outside to find Raccoon City [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|deserted and in ruins]]. She retrieves a shotgun from an abandoned police car and continues through the streets.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Resident Evil film characters}}\n{{Cast listing |\n* [[Milla Jovovich]] as [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]]\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Rain Ocampo\n* [[Eric Mabius]] as Matthew \"Matt\" Addison\n* [[James Purefoy]] as Spence Parks\n* [[Martin Crewes]] as Chad Kaplan\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as James \"One\" Shade\n* Ryan McCluskey as Mr. Grey\n* Oscar Pearce as Mr. Green\n* [[Indra Ov\u00e9]] as Ms. Black\n* Anna Bolt as Dr. Green\n* [[Joseph May]] as Dr. Blue\n* Robert Tannion as Dr. Brown\n* [[Heike Makatsch]] as Dr. Lisa Addison\n* [[Stephen Billington]] as Mr. White\n* [[Fiona Glascott]] as Ms. Gold\n* [[Pasquale Aleardi]] as J.D.

McElroy's script====\n\nGerman production company [[Constantin Film]] bought the film rights for ''Resident Evil'' in January 1997, and hired screenwriter [[Alan B. McElroy]] to write the script. Several magazines from 1997 published early reports about McElroy's storyline: a U.S. covert [[paramilitary]] rescue squad is put together with members from all over the country, and is sent to a medical research facility inside a remote mountain community, where there has been a string of bizarre murder cases. Another team sent in earlier was killed; the new team members encounter genetically mutated creatures, and realize they are being used as specimens in a medical experiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/constantin-buys-evil-rights-1117433527/|title=Constantin buys 'Evil' rights|author=Variety Staff|date=January 14, 1997|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=May 2, 2018|archive-date=October 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003035905/https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/constantin-buys-evil-rights-1117433527/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |title=The Magazine Biz|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=104|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1997|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.11/articles/news1.11.html |title=News |publisher=[[Animation World Network]] |date=February 1997 |accessdate=2022-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |date=September 1997 |last=Jankiewicz |first=Pat |title=Dead Man's Vengeance |url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-242 |quote=I'm doing ''Resident Evil'' right now,\" he reveals. \"It's based on the Sony Playstation video game, a terrifying game with an ''ALIENS'' kind of sensibility.

Described as action and horror packed and very violent, it was similar to the original game. Some changes were made; for example, there was no mention of the [[Umbrella Corporation]] or [[Forest Speyer|STARS]], but the script did include all major characters and monsters from the game. It also included scenes based on the game's more famous moments, like a zombie eating someone and then turning its head around, and a zombie dog crashing through a window. The plot followed a rescue team with members from different military and special forces (including Chris, Jill, Barry, Brad, Rebecca and others from the game). The team is put together by Albert Wesker, who was in an asylum (no explanation for why was given in the script) until he got recruited by the government to rescue scientists from the mansion laboratory located in Raccoon forest. A [[SWAT team]] was sent in earlier to investigate disappearances and murders of campers and park rangers, but they were destroyed by mysterious creatures. Soon after, Wesker's team lands in the forest and is attacked by mutated dogs, but manages to get into the mansion. After battling monsters, including zombies, giant tarantulas and giant hornets, and losing team members and eventually running out of ammo, the team would find the scientist they were sent to rescue and discover that the mission was a trap for them to get infected and spread the virus to the rest of the world. The script's ending had Chris and Jill as last survivors who find the antidote and escape the mansion as it explodes while they are pursued by Wesker who has mutated into Tyrant, the final monster from the game. They defeat the Wesker-Tyrant, take the antidote and walk off into the sunset. Although producers at Constantin Film felt he did a good job with it, McElroy's script was rejected because, by the time it was finished, ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' would have been out, and some at Constantin felt that a movie based on the first game would have been \"dated and boring\". McElroy has a story credit in the released film, which does still have some similarities to his script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/979|title=Resident Evil: The Movie!!!|author=staff|website=[[Ain't it Cool News]]|access-date=May 2, 2018|archive-date=May 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503041418/http://www.aintitcool.com/node/979|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Alan McElroy Resident Evil Script |url=http://www.crimson-head.com/apps/forums/topics/show/13319068-alan-mcelroy-resident-evil-script |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503042442/http://www.crimson-head.com/apps/forums/topics/show/13319068-alan-mcelroy-resident-evil-script |archive-date=May 3, 2018 |access-date=May 2, 2018 |website=Crimson Head Elder}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |date=June 1998 |last=PSM Staff |title=Resident Evil: the Movie |url=https://archive.org/details/psm-10-june-1998/page/n11/mode/2up |magazine=[[PlayStation: The Official Magazine|PlayStation Magazine]] |issue=10 |page=12 |issn=1940-0721}}</ref><ref name=\"Kulzer\">{{cite magazine |date=April 2002 |last=Salisbury |first=Mark |title=Resident Evil: Girls, Guns and Ghouls |url=https://ia601609.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/28/items/ScifiCultHorrorAndFantasyFilmAndFictionZines/Fangoria/Fangoria%20211.cbr&file=211_17.jpg |quote=We said, 'This is easy,'\" recalls the company's head of production, Robert Kulzer. \"You take the first game\u2014a bunch of commandos go into a place, shoot it up, blah blah blah.

Romero's script====\n\nIn 1998, [[George A. Romero]] directed a television commercial for the video game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]''. The original game's director, [[Shinji Mikami]], was a fan of Romero and had been influenced by [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|his films]]. The commercial was only shown in Japan, but impressed Sony enough for them to ask him to write and direct ''Resident Evil''. Romero stated that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. Romero's screenplay was based on the first ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game and included characters from the video games. [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Jill Valentine]] were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship, and [[Barry Burton]], [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]], [[Ada Wong]], and [[Albert Wesker]] were to also appear. The ending to the film would have been similar to the ''best'' ending to the first ''Resident Evil'' game. Like McElroy, Romero made some changes in his script, like writing Barry, who is white in the game, as African American, and added some history between him and Wesker, now best friends since childhood that have been working together for years on military missions. Chris was changed into a Native American ([[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]) who is not a STARS member but has been living in Raccoon City all his life. Romero also hired artist [[Bernie Wrightson]] to design some concept artwork of creatures for the film, and Wrightson did several designs of Tyrant, based on its look in the original game and its description in Romero's script.<ref name=\"fangoria171\">{{cite magazine |last=Ferrante |first=Anthony C. |date=April 1998 |title=Return of the Living Dead Director |url=https://archive.org/download/ScifiCultHorrorAndFantasyFilmAndFictionZines/Fangoria/Fangoria%20171%20%281998%29%20%28George%20Romero%20Returns%29%20%28HQS%29%20c2c.cbr/ |magazine=[[Fangoria]] |issue=171 |pages=20\u201323 |issn=0164-2111}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Resident Evil Original Screenplay |website=Dailyscript.com |url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/resident_evil_romero.html |last1=Romero |first1=George A. |author-link=George A.

In the newspaper at the end of the film, the words ''\"Horror in Raccoon City! More Victims Dead!\"'' are shown in the upper right corner. This is a reference to the same newspaper in the censored opening of the first ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game and the prologue chapter for the ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy]]'' novel. Near the beginning of the film, Alice examines a statue after the wind blows its cover off. This statue is similar in design to one in the mansion of the first game.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nWhile returning to the Red Queen's chamber, Kaplan points out that the four bodies of the group's dead crew from the Glass Hallway Trap sequence are gone. This is a reference to the games, where the bodies of enemies disappear.<ref name=\"Connections\" /> When the survivors make their escape from the Hive with a countdown as they fight the final boss, this is a reference to the ''Resident Evil'' game which ends with a five-minute countdown, during which the boss must be defeated.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nAnderson has stated that the film's [[camera angle]]s and several shots allude to the video game's camera angles, such as the fight between Alice and the security guard. These include a scene near the beginning where there is a close up of Alice's eye, a direct reference to the title screen of the first game.
