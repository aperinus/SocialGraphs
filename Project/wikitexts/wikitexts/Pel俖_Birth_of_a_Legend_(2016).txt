As explained by the character De Brito:  \"It is primitive, but it has a long and rich history ... It all started at the beginning of the 16th century ... The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] arrived in Brazil with African slaves.  But the African's will was strong, and many escaped to the jungle. To protect themselves, the run away slaves called upon the ginga, the foundation of [[Capoeira]], the martial art of war.  When slavery was finally abolished, the  capoeiraistas came out of the jungle, only to find that capoeira was outlawed throughout the land. They saw football to be the perfect way to practice ginga without being arrested. It was the ultimate form of ginga. And before long the ginga evolved, adapted, until it was no longer just ours, but all Brazilians.  But at the 1950 world cup, most believed our ginga style was to blame for the loss, and turned against anything associated with our African heritage. And just like your coach has been trying to remove ginga from your play, we have been trying to remove it from ourselves as a people ever since.\"\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received mostly negative reviews.
