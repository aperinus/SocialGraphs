Shot almost entirely outdoors in the Russian Far East wilderness, the film explores the theme of a native of the forests who is fully integrated into his environment, leading a style of life that will inevitably be destroyed by the advance of civilization. It is also about the growth of respect and deep friendship between two men of profoundly different backgrounds, and about the difficulty of coping with the loss of strength and ability that comes with old age.\n\nThe film won the [[49th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]],<ref name=\"Oscars1976\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1976|title=The 48th Academy Awards (1976) Nominees and Winners|work=oscars.org|access-date=2012-03-18}}</ref> the Golden Prize and the Prix [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI]] at the [[9th Moscow International Film Festival]],<ref name=\"Moscow1975\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1975|title=9th Moscow International Film Festival (1975)|work=MIFF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194905/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1975|archive-date=2013-01-16|url-status=dead|access-date=2013-01-04}}</ref> and other awards.

The film then flashes back to Arsenyev's surveying expedition to the area of [[Shkotovsky District|Shkotovo]] in [[Ussuri krai|Ussuri region]] in 1902. A topographic expedition troop, led by Captain Arsenyev ([[Yury Solomin]]), encounters a nomadic [[Goldi]] hunter named [[Dersu Uzala]] ([[Maxim Munzuk]]) who agrees to guide them through the harsh frontier. Initially viewed as an uneducated, eccentric old man, Dersu earns the respect of the soldiers through his great experience, accurate instincts, keen powers of observation, and deep compassion. He repairs an abandoned hut and leaves provisions in a birch container so that a future traveller may survive in the wilderness. He deduces the identities and situations of people by analysing tracks and articles left behind.\n\nDersu saves the life of Captain Arsenyev for the first time when the two are lost on frozen [[Lake Khanka]] and a sudden blizzard overtakes them. Dersu directs Arsenyev to help him quickly build a straw hut for shelter using reeds and then, when Arsenyev collapses due to exhaustion, Dersu pulls him into the shelter. The two men avoid freezing to death and are reunited with the rest of their comrades when the blizzard clears. The expedition then, struggling to survive the frozen tundra, encounter a [[Nani people|Nani]] family who invite them into their home, providing the men much needed food, and warmth. At this point Dersu asks where Arsenyev will go next to which Arsenyev tells him \"back to the city\" and invites Dersu to come with him.  Dersu tells him that his place is in the forest and that tomorrow he will go on his way.  The next day he leaves the soldiers by the railway tracks and returns to the wilderness.\n\nFive years later in 1907, Arsenyev is on another expedition in Ussuri. He has been mapping mountain ranges for months, all the time holding onto hope that he will run into his old friend Dersu. One night, when at camp, one of his men says he ran into an old hunter in the forest who was asking about their unit. Instantly hopeful, Arsenyev demands to know where he saw the man and rushes into the forest filled with hope of seeing his old friend. Searching the forest for a few minutes he sees Dersu walking away further into the forest. Calling for him he is overcome with joy as Dersu yells back and then men run to each other. The men embrace and Arsenyev brings Dersu back to camp with him where the two sit by a fire and talk about their time apart. Dersu takes up the job of expedition guide again. The expedition breaks up as Arsenyev, Dersu, and a few men cross a large river by raft, and the rest continue on to try to find a ford to cross with the horses. Arsenyev and Dersu get caught on the raft as the others disembark and are quickly rushed downstream. Dersu saves Arsenyev's life again by pushing him off the raft and telling him to swim toward shore. Dersu is trapped on the raft as conditions on the river become treacherous. Moments before Dersu and the raft crash into the rapids, Dersu jumps onto a branch in the middle of the river. He then directs the party to cut a tree which can reach him before he drowns. The plan succeeds.  Some time passes and the men seem to be in good spirits. They take several pictures with Dersu and all seems to be going well. Arsenyev writes in his journal that some of his fondest memories of Dersu occurred during the beginning of that autumn.\n\nA short time later, the expedition party is trekking through the forest when Dersu realises they are being stalked by an amu, a [[Siberian tiger]]. Dersu tries in vain to scare the tiger away telling him that the soldiers will shoot him with their guns. The tiger continues getting closer to Dersu and Arsenyev until Dersu is forced to shoot at it (which he misses). Dersu is instantly distraught over shooting at the tiger. Despite Asenyey's encouragement that the tiger is not injured, Dersu is convinced the tiger will run until dead. He states that Kangnga, who is a forest spirit that his people worship, will be unhappy and will send another tiger for him. Dersu becomes more and more irritable, yelling at members of the party and distancing himself from Arsenyev. Dersu's eyesight and other senses begin to fade with age until he is no longer able to hunt, thus not being able to live alone in the forest.\n\nCaptain Arsenyev offers to take Dersu with him to the city of [[Khabarovsk]]. Dersu quickly discovers that he is not permitted to chop down trees or to build a hut and fireplace in the city park, nor is he allowed to shoot within the city limits. Despite his love for Arsenyev and Arsenyev's family, Dersu realizes that his place is not in the city and asks Arsenyev if he can return to living in the hills. As a parting gift, Arsenyev gives him a very fine new military rifle.\n\nSome while later, Arsenyev receives a telegram informing him that the body of a [[Goldi]] has been found, with no identification on him save Arsenyev's calling card, and is requested to come identify the body. Arsenyev finds that it is indeed Dersu. The officer who found Dersu speculates that someone may have killed Dersu to obtain the rifle that Arsenyev gave him. As the gravediggers finish their work, Arsenyev finds Dersu's walking stick nearby, and plants it in the ground beside the grave.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Yury Solomin]] as [[Vladimir Arsenyev]]\n*[[Maxim Munzuk]] as [[Dersu Uzala]]\n*Vladimir Kremena as Turtygin\n*[[Alexander Pyatkov]] as Olenev\n*Svetlana Danilchenko as Anna\n*[[Suimenkul Chokmorov]] as Chzhan Bao\n\n==Production==\nIn an interview conducted for the 1999 RUSCICO DVD release, co-star Solomin stated that Kurosawa had long known of Arsenyev's book and had planned to make a film version very early in his career in the late 1930s, but had dropped the project after realising that it had to be made in the region where the events had actually taken place. The Soviet government allowed few foreigners into the region of the [[taiga]] where filming took place, and they monitored Kurosawa and his team closely during the year-long production.<ref>Conrad, David A.

On 1 January 1973, Matsue signed the deal on the condition that Kurosawa receive full creative control. Mosfilm wanted Kurosawa's frequent collaborator [[Toshiro Mifune]] to play Dersu, but Matsue convinced them otherwise as Mifune would not be attached to such a long production. Eventually, [[Tuva]] actor [[Maxim Munzuk]] was cast. Mosfilm, like Japan's [[Toho]] studio that Kurosawa usually worked with, found it impossible to keep the perfectionist director to a tight budget and schedule.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nogami|first=Teruyo|title=Waiting on the Weather|year=2006|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=978-1-933330-09-9|ref=CITEREFNogami|pages=272\u20134}}</ref><ref>Conrad, 184</ref>\n\n==Box office==\n''Dersu Uzala'' sold {{nowrap|20.4 million}} tickets in the Soviet Union, and made {{US$|1.2 million|long=no}} in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zemlianukhin|first=Sergei|author2=Miroslava Segida|title=Domashniaia sinemateka 1918&ndash;1996 (\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0421\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430 1918&ndash;1996)|publisher=Duble-D|location=Moscow|year=1996|isbn= 5-900902-05-6|language=ru|page=118}}</ref> It also sold 994,988 tickets in France,<ref>{{cite web |title=Derzu uzala (1976) |url=http://www.jpbox-office.com/fichfilm.php?id=8128 |website=JP's Box-Office |access-date=30 March 2022}}</ref> 32,400 tickets in Sweden,<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0443 \u0423\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0430, 1975 |trans-title=Dersu Uzala, 1975 |url=https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/8208/ |website=[[Kinopoisk]] |language=ru |access-date=30 March 2022}}</ref> and 48,265 tickets in other EU territories since 1996,<ref>{{cite web |title=Dersu Uzala |url=https://lumiere.obs.coe.int/movie/568 |website=[[LUMIERE]] |access-date=30 March 2022}}</ref> adding up to {{formatnum:{{#expr:20400000+994988+32400+48265}}|}} tickets sold in the Soviet Union and Europe.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Dersu Uzala (1961 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0443 \u0423\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0430}})\u20141961 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] film directed by [[Agasi Babayan]]\n* [[Dersu Uzala]] (historic person)\n* ''[[Dersu Uzala (book)|Dersu Uzala]]'' (book, 1923)\n* [[List of submissions to the 48th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Soviet submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0071411|Dersu Uzala}}\n*{{Amg movie|13328|Dersu Uzala}}\n*[http://www.dersu-uzala.info Dersu Uzala Info]\n*[http://www.mosfilm.ru/index.php?File=gallery/current.php&Gal=032 Stills from ''Dersu Uzala'' with Russian text]\n* {{jmdb title|1975|cy002400}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/880-dersu-uzala ''Dersu Uzala''] an essay by [[Donald Richie]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Akira Kurosawa}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''Dersu Uzala''\n|list =\n{{AcademyAwardBestForeignLanguageFilm 1961\u20131980}}\n{{MIFF Main Award|state=autocollapse}}\n}}\n{{Soviet submission for Academy Awards}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dersu Uzala}}\n[[Category:1975 films]]\n[[Category:1970s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Russian biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Soviet adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s Russian-language films]]\n[[Category:Russian adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Akira Kurosawa]]\n[[Category:Daiei Film films]]\n[[Category:Mosfilm films]]\n[[Category:Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films set in Russia]]\n[[Category:1975 in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Japan\u2013Soviet Union relations]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Akira Kurosawa]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Yuri Nagibin]]\n[[Category:Japanese multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Soviet multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Survival films]]\n[[Category:Films about hunters]]\n[[Category:1975 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1902]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1907]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1908]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1910]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Russian Empire]]\n[[Category:1975 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Japanese adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
