The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Brian Helgeland]], based on a 2006 non-fiction book ''[[Imperial Life in the Emerald City]]'' by journalist [[Rajiv Chandrasekaran]].

Miller finds that the majority of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intel]] given to him is inaccurate. His  efforts to find the true story about the weapons are blocked by [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] official Clark Poundstone ([[Greg Kinnear]]). The cast also features [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Amy Ryan]], [[Khalid Abdalla]] and [[Jason Isaacs]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Working Title Films]],<ref name=\"Rovi\">[http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/v386264 Rovi: ''Green Zone'' - countries, produced by, released by] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130117074608/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/v386264 |date=2013-01-17 }} Retrieved November 4, 2012</ref> with financial backing from [[Universal Pictures]], [[StudioCanal]], [[Relativity Media]], [[Antena 3 de Televisi\u00f3n|Antena 3 Films]] and [[Dentsu]].<ref name=Rovi/> Principal photography for the film project began during January 2008 in [[Spain]], later moving to [[Morocco]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n''Green Zone'' premiered at the [[Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival]] in [[Japan]] on February 26, 2010, and was released in [[Australia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] on March 11, 2010, followed by a further 10 countries the next day, among them the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Canada]]. The film generally received mixed critical reviews and was a box office [[Box office bomb|flop]], as it cost $100 million to produce plus $40 million in marketing, while the global theatrical runs  produced only $94,882,549 in gross revenue.<ref name=\"mojo\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[2003 invasion of Iraq|March 19, 2003]], [[Iraqi Ground Forces|Iraqi Army]] General Mohammed Al-Rawi flees his residence amid the bombardment of [[Baghdad]]. Before leaving the compound he passes a notebook to his aide Seyyed, instructing him to warn his officers to get to their safehouses and wait for his signal.\n\nFour weeks later, [[United States Army|US Army]] [[Chemical Corps|CBRN]] [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Chief Warrant Officer]] Roy Miller and his platoon check a warehouse for [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi weapons of mass destruction]]. To Miller's surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the [[101st Airborne Division]] are too limited in strength to do much. After a firefight with a sniper Miller finds that the warehouse is empty, the third consecutive time an official mission has led to a dead end. Later, at a debriefing, Miller makes the point that the majority of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intel]] given to him is inaccurate and anonymous. High-ranking officials quickly dismiss his concerns. Afterwards [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Agent]] Martin Brown tells him that the next place he is to search was inspected by a [[United Nations]] team two months prior and that it too has been confirmed empty.\n\nMeanwhile, [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] official Clark Poundstone welcomes returning Iraqi exile politician Ahmed Zubaidi at the airport. There Poundstone is questioned by ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter Lawrie Dayne. She says she needs to speak directly to \"Magellan\" (based on real-life informant \"[[Curveball (informant)|Curveball]]\"), but Poundstone brushes her off.\n\nMeanwhile, while checking another unpromising site, Miller is approached by an Iraqi who calls himself \"Freddy\", who tells him that he saw some [[Ba'ath Party]] VIPs meeting in a nearby house. They include Al-Rawi and his officers and aides in Baghdad, who are discussing the current situation. Al-Rawi decides to wait for the Americans to offer him a deal, and attack if they don't. As the meeting ends, Miller and his men burst into the house. Al-Rawi narrowly escapes, but Seyyed is captured. Before Miller can extract much information, Seyyed is taken away by [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] operators and gets in a fight with Miller\u2019s team\u2014however, Miller keeps Al-Rawi's notebook. Dayne complains to Poundstone again, but he states that the stakes are much larger than her role in selling newspapers.\n\nMiller goes to Brown's hotel in the [[Green Zone]], where he tells him what happened and gives him the notebook. Brown arranges for Miller to get into the prison where Seyyed is being interrogated. Miller is then approached by Dayne, who questions him about the false reports of WMDs. Miller bluffs his way in to see Seyyed. Near death after being tortured, he tells Miller that they \"did everything you asked us to in the meeting.\" When Miller asks what meeting he is talking about, he says one word: \"Jordan.\" Miller then confronts Dayne about the bogus intel she published, but she refuses to identify Magellan, her source. After Miller tells her he suspects that Al-Rawi is Magellan, Dayne reluctantly confirms that Magellan met with a high-ranking official in February in Jordan.\n\nMiller realises that Poundstone's men are hunting Al-Rawi, and can think of only one reason: Al-Rawi confirms there was no Iraqi WMD program, and is now a major liability. Poundstone confiscates the notebook from Martin; it contains the locations of Al-Rawi's [[safe house]]s. When Miller tries to arrange a meeting with Al-Rawi, he is abducted by Al-Rawi's men following Poundstone's announcement of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2|decision to disband the entire Iraqi Army]]. Al-Rawi tells Miller that he informed Poundstone that the WMD program had been dismantled after the [[Gulf War|First Persian Gulf War]]; Poundstone, however, reported that Al-Rawi had confirmed there were WMDs so the US government would have an excuse to invade. Poundstone's men attack the locations listed in the notebook. When they get to the general's hiding place he flees, ordering one man to kill Miller. Miller manages to kill his captor and races after Al-Rawi, finally capturing him,  but Freddy suddenly appears and shoots the general, telling Miller that \"the fate of Iraq is not yours to decide\". With his only witness against Poundstone now dead, Miller tells Freddy to flee.\n\nLater, Miller writes a scathing report. He confronts Poundstone in a meeting and gives him the report, but Poundstone dismisses it, telling Miller that WMDs do not matter. Poundstone then rejoins the meeting, only to see Iraqi factional leaders reject Zubaidi, the US's choice as leader of Iraq, as an American puppet and storm out. Afterwards, Dayne receives Miller's report by email. The recipient list includes reporters for major news agencies around the world.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Roy Miller,<ref name=wt>{{cite web|url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/filmCastCrew.php?filmID=118|title=Green Zone|publisher=Working Title Films|access-date=March 12, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303100626/http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/filmCastCrew.php?filmID=118|archive-date=March 3, 2008}}</ref> an idealistic [[US Army]] [[Chemical Corps|CBRN]] Chief Warrant Officer.<ref name=ryan/> Roy Miller is based on real-life Army Chief Warrant Officer Richard \"Monty\" Gonzales.

Although he initially supported [[Tony Blair]]'s justifications of the war, he became disillusioned over time. Greengrass carried out extensive research into the background to the conflict, reading journalists such as [[Bob Woodward]], [[Seymour Hersh]], [[James Risen]], [[Thomas E. Ricks (journalist)|Thomas Ricks]], and [[Ron Suskind]], in addition to [[Rajiv Chandrasekaran]], whose book he optioned. He has even compiled a document, ''How Did We Get It So Wrong?'', detailing what he learned. Although Greengrass initially wanted to make a smaller film, he eventually decided a bigger budget production would expose more people to the ideas in the film.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>\n\nAddressing some of the contentions in the film, Greengrass has said that the arguments about [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2|disbanding the Iraqi army]] portrayed in the film represent debates that actually took place by US policy makers. The issue of the culpability of the [[Fourth Estate]], i.e. the mainstream (news) media, or MSM, in taking intelligence at face value, although embodied by a single character, represents a broad based failing in both the US and UK, but for Greengrass the fault ultimately lay with those trying to manipulate them.<ref name=chud>Faraci, Devin [http://www.chud.com/articles/articles/22932/1/THE-CHUD-INTERVIEW-PAUL-GREENGRASS-GREEN-ZONE/Page1.html The CHUD Interview: Paul Greengrass (Green Zone)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317021039/http://chud.com/articles/articles/22932/1/THE-CHUD-INTERVIEW-PAUL-GREENGRASS-GREEN-ZONE/Page1.html |date=2010-03-17 }} Chud</ref>\n\nGreengrass has said that both the ''Bourne'' films and ''Green Zone'' reflect a widespread popular mistrust of authority that was engendered by governments that have deliberately lied and have let their citizens down over the Iraq war.<ref>[http://www.lovefilm.com/features/detail.html?section_name=interview&editorial_id=2370 Paul Greengrass interview] Lovefilm</ref> The confusion surrounding the absence of WMD in Iraq also provided an ideal scenario for a thriller, in which the protagonist battles for the truth.<ref name=chud/>\n\n===Filming===\nProduction of ''Green Zone'' was originally slated to begin in late 2007.<ref name=lines/> Instead, it began at the [[Los Alc\u00e1zares]] Air Base in Spain<ref name=spain>{{cite news|author=Sobre Cine|url=http://www.sobrecine.com/noticias/matt-damon-y-paul-greengrass-en-green-zone-distrito-protegido|title=sobrecine.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712072042/http://www.sobrecine.com/noticias/matt-damon-y-paul-greengrass-en-green-zone-distrito-protegido/|archive-date=2010-07-12}}</ref> on January 10, 2008,<ref name=ryan/> moved to Morocco, and finished filming in the UK in December 2008.\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe original motion picture soundtrack was composed by musician John Powell.
