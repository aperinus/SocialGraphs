It features interviews with many people with various perspectives on [[copyright]], including copyright lawyers, producers, artists and filesharing service providers.<ref>[https://www.filmaffinity.com/us/film126644.html FilmAffinity]</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nA central point of the documentary is the thesis that \"creativity itself is on the line\" and that a balance needs to be struck, or that there is a conflict between protecting the right of those who own intellectual property and the rights of future generations to create.\n\n==Content==\nArtists interviewed include [[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]] and [[Danger Mouse (Artist and Producer)|Danger Mouse]], popular musicians of the [[mashup (music)|mashup]] scene who cut and remix sounds from other songs into their own (notably the latter artist's ''[[The Grey Album]]'' featuring music of [[The Beatles]] and [[Jay Z]]).<ref>[https://www.allmovie.com/movie/good-copy-bad-copy-v501382 AllMovie]</ref><ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2007/06/michael_moore_should_watch_thi_1.html Michael Moore Should Watch This Documentary - Vulture]</ref><ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/girl-talk-2020-tour-950366/ Girl Talk Announces First North American Tour in Eight Years - Rolling Stone]</ref> The interviews with these artists reveal an emerging understanding of digital works and the obstacle to their authoring [[copyright]] presents.\n\nThe interviews featured in ''Good Copy Bad Copy'' acknowledge a recent shift towards [[user-generated content]], [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] music and video culture. The documentary opens with explaining the current legal situation concerning [[Sampling (music)|sampling]], [[licensing]] and [[copyright]].\n\n''Good Copy Bad Copy'' documents the conflict between current [[copyright]] law and recent technological advances that enable the [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of music, as well as the distribution of copyrighted material via [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] search engines such as [[The Pirate Bay]]. MPAA ([[Motion Picture Association of America]]) CEO [[Dan Glickman]] is interviewed in connection with a raid by the [[Swedish police]] against The Pirate Bay in May 2006. Glickman concedes that piracy will never be stopped, but states that they will try to make it as difficult and tedious as possible. [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] and [[Fredrik Neij]] from The Pirate Bay are also interviewed, with Neij stating that The Pirate Bay is illegal according to US law, but not Swedish law.\n\nThe interviews document attitudes towards [[art]], culture and copyright in a number of countries, including the [[United States]], [[Sweden]], [[Russia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Brazil]].\n\nThe situation in [[Nigeria]] and [[Brazil]] is documented in terms of innovative business models that have developed in response to new technological possibilities and changing markets.\n\nIn [[Nigeria]] the documentary interviews individuals working within the Nigerian [[film]] industry, or [[Nollywood]]. Charles Igwe, a film producer in Lagos, is interviewed at length about his views on the Nigerian film industry, the nature of Nigerian films, and copyright in the context of [[digital video]] technology. Mayo Ayilaran, from the Copyright Society of Nigeria, explains the Nigerian government's approach to copyright enforcement.\n\nIn [[Brazil]] the [[Tecno brega]] industry and its unique approach to [[copyright]] and [[sampling (music)|sampling]] is documented, featuring interviews with amongst others [[Ronaldo Lemos]], Professor of Law [[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas|FGV]] Brazil. Lemos explains that CDs or recorded music is treated merely as an advertisement for parties and concerts that generate revenue.\n\n''Good Copy Bad Copy'' also includes interview segments with notable copyright activist and academic [[Lawrence Lessig]].<ref>[http://www.goodcopybadcopy.net/about Good Copy Bad Copy\u2014About]</ref><ref>[http://www.goodcopybadcopy.net/credits Good Copy Bad Copy\u2014Credits]</ref>\n\n==Credits==\n*[[Girl Talk (musician)|Girl Talk]], Producer\n*Dr Lawrence Ferrara, Director of Music Department [[NYU]]\n*Paul V.
