It was released on May 1, 1987.\n\n==Plot==\nMolly (Hoffs), Val (Pfeiffer) and Gina (Cusack) are graduating [[college]], but on their final night, frustrations are aired. Molly is still looking for real love and Val is beginning to doubt if that is what she has found. Gina is too busy videotaping everything to really notice. When the final party at Pacifica College kicks off, things do not go exactly as planned.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Susanna Hoffs]] \u2013 Molly\n*[[Dedee Pfeiffer]] \u2013 Val\n*[[Joan Cusack]] \u2013 Gina\n*James Anthony Shanta \u2013 Killer\n*[[John Terlesky]] \u2013 C.J.\n*[[Michael Ontkean]] \u2013 Mickey\n*[[Pam Grier]] \u2013 Sergeant McLeesh\n*Christian Roerig \u2013 Dirk Roburn\n*Doug Choo \u2013 Uncle Vance\n\n==Production==\nThe film was also known as ''Cutting Loose''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=It's been a name game;get your family ready to hit the road|date=Apr 7, 1987|work=USA TODAY|id={{ProQuest|305846436}}}}</ref>\n\nIt was written and directed by Hoffs' mother who had directed a number of music videos, including the Bangles' ''[[Going Down to Liverpool]]'', and two short films, including ''The Haircut'' with [[John Cassavetes]]. She said:\n<blockquote>Movies are never 100% accurate because they're one step away from reality, but I think this is an accurate depiction of young people-and not just kids in Southern California in 1987. I went to Yale and the experiences depicted in the film are very much like experiences I had at school. In fact, the three female leads are loosely based on myself and my two roommates. There are certain stories you can tell over and over and it's possible to have enormous amounts of content buried in a film like this. Being in school delays having to deal with certain aspects of life and these kids are still a bit innocent, so on one level the film is about the end of innocence. It's also about the relationships that develop between people when they live together at a certain point in their lives.<ref name=\"los\">{{Cite news|author=McKENNA, K. |date=May 5, 1987|title=MOTHER AND A BANGLE TEAM UP FOR A MOVIE|work=Los Angeles Times|id={{ProQuest|292492261}}}}</ref></blockquote>\nTamar Hoffs called the film as \"sort of a [[beach party]] movie intended for kids from 14 to 16... I've always loved beach party movies\", she admits, \"because they're optimistic and ask nothing more of the viewer than the price of admission and just hanging out-and that's pretty much the mood of `The Allnighter.' It's a light, easy film about a moment in time when friendship really counts.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nTamar Hoffs said she did not write the film with her daughter in mind.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Marcia, F.

She said:\n<blockquote>This movie isn't a musical, and it would've confused the audience if I'd sung in the film-particularly since that's not what the character I portray is about. I play a vulnerable, cautious, self-protective girl-adjectives that describe me pretty well, by the way. I identified with this character quite a bit. On the other hand, she's a beach girl and that's something quite foreign to me. Even though I grew up at the beach and love it there, I can remember looking at surfers and surf bunnies and thinking 'Wow! Who are these people?! They're so cool they're like creatures from another planet!'<ref name=\"los\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was promoted with a poster featuring Susanna Hoffs wearing a skimpy bikini as she sips a cocktail and the tag line, \"Who says you can't do it all in one night?\"\n\n\"I feel pretty weird about it\", said Hoffs, \"though there's a side of me that thinks it's kind of funny. I do a scene in the film wearing nothing but my underwear and I must admit that was hard to do. I knew if I had an incredible song blasting in the background I'd be able to do it, so I brought in a copy of [[Aretha Franklin|Aretha]]'s '[[Respect (song)|Respect]]' and that did the trick.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nShe added, \"I'm satisfied with my performance in the long run\u2026 It left me eager to do more \u2013 probably because we all had so much fun. There was great camaraderie among the cast and I don't think anyone felt I was given special treatment because I was the director's daughter.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe film was popularly and critically panned, receiving a 0% on the Internet review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=allnighter|title=The Allnighter}}</ref>\n\nThe film, according to motion picture-historian [[Leonard Maltin]], was \"...grotesque in the [[AIDS]] era, although it would be a stinker in any age.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe ''New York Times'' called it \"outstandingly dim... The principals are three bubble-headed women who room together, and the film could be accused of sexism if their male counterparts were not equally dumb.\"<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|title=The Allnighter Review|date=30 September 2022 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE6DC113FF937A35756C0A961948260}}</ref>\n\nThe Hoffs said they planned to make another film together despite ''The Allnighter'''s poor reception. \"The critics can\u2019t ruin our relationship\", said Tamar.<ref name=\"people\"/> However no subsequent film resulted.\n\nSusanna Hoffs later said, \"It was such a low budget quickie thing, a cutesy little teeny-bopper movie. It wasn\u2019t a great movie but the whole experience of it was great.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features46.html|title=LET'S GO TO BED: SUSANNA HOFFS INTERVIEW|magazine=Rage|date= 1991|first=Chris|last= Hunt}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nOn August 24, 1999, [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] released ''The Allnighter'' on DVD.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/6305537534 DVD information for ''The Allnighter''], ''Amazon.com''.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1987]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0092537|title=The Allnighter}}\n*{{TCMDb title|id=67116|title=The Allnighter}}\n*{{AllMovie title|1683|The Allnighter}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=allnighter|title=The Allnighter}}\n*{{mojo title|id=allnighter|title=The Allnighter}}\n*[http://www.fast-rewind.com/allnighter.htm ''The Allnighter''] at Fast-Rewind\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Allnighter, The}}\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:1987 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Tamar Simon Hoffs]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films set in universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Beach party films]]\n[[Category:Teen sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:1987 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
