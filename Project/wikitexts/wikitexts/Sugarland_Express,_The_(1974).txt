In the film, a woman and her husband take a police officer hostage and flee across Texas as they try to get to their child before he is placed in foster care. The event partially took place, the story is partially set, and the film was partially filmed in [[Sugar Land, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wilsoncountynews.com/articles/caught-on-camera-spot-our-hometowns-in-the-movies/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Sugarland%20Express%E2%80%9D%20(1974,from%20the%20state%20of%20Texas.|website=WilsonCountyNews.com|title=Caught on camera \u2014 spot our hometowns in the movies|author=Rohan, Linda Sue|access-date=2 June 2020}}</ref> Other scenes for the film were filmed in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Live Oak, [[Floresville, TX|Floresville]], [[Pleasanton, Texas|Pleasanton]], [[Converse, Texas|Converse]] and [[Del Rio, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies2.nm-unlimited2.net/1970s/14sugarland_express.html|title=Movie Locations of the Great Southwest : The Sugarland Express|website=Taos Unlimited Movie Locations|access-date=15 October 2021}}</ref>\n\n''The Sugarland Express'' marks the first collaboration between Spielberg and composer [[John Williams]]. Williams has scored all but five of Spielberg-directed films since; this is the only score he has composed for Spielberg that has never been released as an album, although Williams re-recorded the main theme with [[Toots Thielemans]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] for 1991's ''The Spielberg/Williams Collaboration''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Spielberg-Williams-Collaboration-Conducts/dp/B00000271M|title=The Spielberg/Williams Collaboration: John Williams Conducts His Classic Scores For the Films of Steven Spielberg|work=Amazon|access-date=November 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nLou Jean Poplin visits her incarcerated husband, Clovis Michael Poplin, to tell him that their son will soon be placed in the care of foster parents. Even though he is four months away from being released from [[Beauford H. Jester Prison Farm|prison]], she convinces him to escape to assist her in retrieving their child. They hitch a ride from the prison with a couple, but when [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] Patrolman Maxwell Slide stops the car, they take the car and run.\n\nWhen the car crashes, the two felons overpower and kidnap Slide, holding him [[hostage]] at the head of a slow-moving and growing caravan, initially of police cars but eventually including news vans, private citizens' vehicles, and helicopters. The Poplins and Slide travel through Beaumont, Dayton, Houston, Cleveland, Conroe and finally [[Wheelock, Texas]]. By holding Slide hostage, the pair are able to continually gas up their car, as well as get food via the [[drive-through]]. During the lengthy pursuit, Slide and the pair bond and develop mutual respect for one another.\n\nThe Poplins bring Slide to the home of the foster parents, where they encounter numerous officers, including the DPS Captain who has been pursuing them, Captain Harlin Tanner. A pair of Texas Rangers shoot and fatally wound Clovis, and after another car chase, the Texas Department of Public Safety arrests Lou Jean. Patrolman Slide is found unharmed.\n\nAn epilogue preceding the closing credits explains that Lou Jean subsequently spent fifteen months of a five-year prison term in a women's correctional facility. Upon getting out, she obtained the right to live with her son, convincing authorities that she was able to do so.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Lou Jean Poplin\n* [[William Atherton]] as Clovis Michael Poplin\n* [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]] as Captain Harlin Tanner\n* [[Michael Sacks]] as Patrolman Maxwell Slide\n* [[Gregory Walcott]] as Patrolman Ernie Mashburn\n* [[Steve Kanaly]] as Patrolman Jessup\n* [[Louise Latham]] as Mrs. Looby\n* [[Dean Smith (sprinter)|Dean Smith]] as Russ Berry\n\nThe actual kidnapped patrolman, [[James Kenneth Crone]], played a small role in the film as a deputy sheriff.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nThe film's Lou Jean Poplin and Clovis Michael Poplin are based on the lives of then-21-year-old Ila Fae Holiday/Dent and 22-year-old Robert \"Bobby\" Dent, respectively.<ref name=Truth>{{cite news |url=http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/courier/opinion/the-real-story-behind-the-sugarland-express/article_4d92a2f8-45bf-5be9-93a2-54aaeacb6077.html |title=The real story behind 'The Sugarland Express' |last=Haile |first=Bartee |work=[[The Courier (Conroe newspaper)|Conroe Courier]] |date=2012-05-04 |access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref> The character of [[Texas Highway Patrol]]man Slide is based on then-27-year-old Trooper [[James Kenneth Crone|J.

A year later, Spielberg's next project for Zanuck and Brown was 1975's blockbuster hit ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.\n\nA clip from the [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner]] cartoon ''[[Whoa, Be-Gone!]]'' is shown in silence during a scene at a drive-in theater.\n\nThis was the first movie to use the [[Panavision]] Panaflex camera.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Sugarland Express'' holds an 86% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average score of 7.2 out of 10 from 49 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Its plot may ape the countercultural road movies of its era, but Steven Spielberg's feature debut displays many of the crowd-pleasing elements he'd refine in subsequent films.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_sugarland_express/ | title=The Sugarland Express (1974) | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date=August 8, 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"If the movie finally doesn\u2019t succeed, that\u2019s because Spielberg has paid too much attention to all those police cars (and all the crashes they get into), and not enough to the personalities of his characters.

[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it \"a dazzling, funny, exciting and finally poignant film,\" and called it \"astonishing\" what Spielberg, Barwood and Robbins \"have managed to accomplish within a simple trek plot. Starting out as a comedy that gradually darkens, 'The Sugarland Express,' which is based on an actual incident, becomes an increasingly disenchanted portrait of contemporary America.\"<ref>Thomas, Kevin (April 5, 1974). \"Mother Love Leads a Curious Caravan\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.</ref> [[Nora Sayre]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"Spielberg, the 26-year old director, has built up Texas as a major character in his movie.

It's an odyssey you may never forget, and you might as well memorize the names of the young filmmakers responsible for it, the 26-year old director, Steven Spielberg, and the 30-year old screenwriters (and no doubt prospective directors), Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, because they've made one of the most stunning debuts in Hollywood history.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (April 5, 1974) \"It's a Real Movie and The One That Matters\".
