The students make a bet regarding whether the fireworks are either round or flat in the sky. After Nazuna finds a small glass marble, she, Norimichi and Yusuke compete in the swimming pool race. Yusuke wins and Nazuna asks him to go on a date. Nazuna packs a suitcase and plans to leave home. Yusuke bails on the date and Nazuna is taken home by her mother. Norimichi throws the marble, wishing for luck and causing it to rewind time. Back when the race occurred, Norimichi wins this time around and Nazuna asks him on a date. They head to the train station, but are caught once again by Nazuna's mother. Norimichi learns that the fireworks are flat and is aware he is in an alternate timeline. He wishes for another chance to escape with Nazuna. He throws the marble from a lighthouse and reverses time again. He helps her elude the family and board the train. They are caught again by the others. When Yusuke pushes the two off the balcony, Norimichi uses the marble once again, wishing for no one to see them. Time jumps back again and the train takes a different route, leaving the two in the same town encapsulated in a glass dome. After a pyrotechnician uses the marble as a leftover firework charge, it explodes in the sky. After seeing the future within the shard, Nazuna asks Norimichi where will they see next. The next day, the school notices the absence of Norimichi and Nazuna.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n|-\n!Japanese<ref name=\"MainCast\" /><ref name=\"MainCast2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-06-12/shaft-shunji-iwai-fireworks-anime-film-reveals-5-more-cast-members/.117335|title=Shaft, Shunji Iwai's Fireworks Anime Film Reveals 5 More Cast Members|last=Hodgkins|first=Crystalyn|date=June 12, 2017|website=[[Anime News Network]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617153217/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-06-12/shaft-shunji-iwai-fireworks-anime-film-reveals-5-more-cast-members/.117335|archive-date=June 17, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=June 12, 2017}}</ref>\n!English<ref>{{Cite tweet|author=GKIDS Films|user=GKIDSfilms|number=1010267946411872256|title=Excited to see FIREWORKS on the big screen?
