The Psychlos, a brutal race of giant humanoid aliens, have ruled the planet for 1,000 years, and use human slave labor to strip its minerals and other resources, with a special desire for gold. A few primitive hunter-gatherer tribes of humans live in freedom in remote, hidden areas, but after ten centuries of Psychlo oppression, they have abandoned any hope of regaining control of their planet. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler rejects this universal hopelessness and leaves his tribe in the Rocky Mountains on a journey of exploration with a nomad hunter named Carlo. Both are captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp in the ruins of Denver, Colorado, the Psychlos' principal base of operations. A massive dome over the base protects the Psychlos from Earth's atmosphere, which is toxic to them.\n\nAt the camp, they meet Terl, the Psychlo security chief, and his deputy, Ker. Terl's superiors have had him reassigned to his remote Earth outpost indefinitely following unexplained incidents involving \"the Senator's daughter\". He plans to bribe his way back to the Psychlo home planet by illegally mining gold in areas of high radioactivity. Psychlos avoid such areas because radiation reacts explosively with the gas mixture that they breathe. Terl observes that Jonnie is a resourceful human and selects him to lead the mining operation. Jonnie acquires a comprehensive knowledge of human history and literature in a Psychlo rapid-learning machine. He defiantly declares that one day, humans will overthrow the Psychlos and retake their planet. An amused Terl shows Jonnie the ruins of Denver and its public library and boasts that the Psychlos conquered all of Earth in only nine minutes early in the 21st century. Jonnie spends time in the library and is particularly inspired by the Declaration of Independence.\n\nTerl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and orders him to find gold. Jonnie locates a plentiful supply at the long-abandoned [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]]. He also discovers an abandoned underground military base with working [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|Harrier]] jump-jets, weapons, and fuel. While they are supposed to be laboring in the mines, Jonnie and his followers plot a revolution, training themselves in aerial combat using the military base's flight simulators.\n\nAfter a week of training, the rebels launch their attack. In a suicide mission, Carlo flies his Psychlo flying shuttle into the Denver dome, destroying it and suffocating the Psychlos inside. Jonnie captures a teleportation device and uses it to teleport a [[dirty bomb]] to the Psychlo home world. When it detonates, the radiation it releases reacts catastrophically with the Psychlo atmosphere, destroying all life on the planet. The humans have retaken Earth but face an uncertain future. The last Psychlo survivors are Terl\u2014who is imprisoned inside Fort Knox, in a makeshift cell surrounded by gold bars, as a bargaining chip in the event of a counterattack by Psychlos living off their home world\u2014and Ker, who joins the victorious humans in their challenging project to rebuild their civilization.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[John Travolta]] as Terl\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Jonnie Goodboy Tyler\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Ker\n* [[Kim Coates]] as Carlo\n* [[Sabine Karsenti]] as Chrissy\n* [[Richard Tyson]] as Robert the Fox\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Chirk\n* Michael MacRae as District Manager Zete\n* Shaun Austin-Olsen as Planetship Numph\n* Tim Post as the Assistant Planetship\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Parson staffer\n* [[Christian Tessier]] as Mickey\n* Sylvain Landry as Sammy\n* [[Earl Pastko]] as the Bartender\n* No\u00ebl Burton as the Clinko Learning instructor\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Initial deals ===\n==== 1982\u20131986: Hubbard period ====\nAfter ''Battlefield Earth'' was published in 1982, [[L.

Not only was the film released only three days after the 50th anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'', but the villainous Psychlos have been interpreted by many observers as an obvious allusion to Scientology's ''[[wikt:b\u00eate noire|b\u00eate noire]]'', psychiatry. The conflict between the Psychlos and the free humans can be seen as a reflection of Scientology's own conception of itself as fighting on behalf of humanity against the forces of psychiatry. The \"space opera\" genre of the book and film manifests itself in numerous places in Scientology itself, most famously in [[OT III]] (the [[Xenu]] story). Travolta's own commitment to such a disastrous project as the film version of ''Battlefield Earth'' is, in Urban's estimation, indicative of his \"unusual dedication\" to Scientology.<ref name=\"Urban2011\">{{cite book|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion|url=https://archive.org/details/churchofscientol0000urba|url-access=registration|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-14608-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/churchofscientol0000urba/page/145 145]}}</ref>\n\n== Parodies ==\n''[[South Park]]'' parodied the film at the [[2000 MTV Movie Awards]].<ref name=\"ortega\">{{Cite news|last=Ortega|first=Tony|title=Sympathy For The Devil: Tory Bezazian was a veteran Scientologist who loved going after church critics.
