A loose adaptation of the story of the [[comic album]] ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'', written by [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] and illustrated by [[Albert Uderzo]], the plot follows Asterix and Obelix trying to train the nephew of their village's chief, only to find themselves rescuing him from a tribe of vikings who believe him to be a Champion of Fear.\n\nThe [[ensemble cast|ensemble voice cast]] features [[Roger Carel]] and [[Jacques Frantz]] as Asterix and Obelix, with [[Paul Giamatti]] and [[Brad Garrett]] headlining the [[dubbing (filmmaking)|English dub]]. Unlike most Asterix films, the English dub's voice cast consisted of American actors rather than British or French actors. This adaptation introduced new characters, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] references about modern technology, and [[cover version]]s of pop songs, such as \"[[Get Down on It]]\" by [[Kool and the Gang]], \"[[Eye of the Tiger]]\" by [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]] and \"[[Super Freak]]\" by [[Rick James]].\n\n== Plot ==\nA succession of raids leaves a tribe of [[Vikings]] without anyone to fight against them. The tribe's adviser, Cryptograf, concludes that their enemies have all fled, stating that \"fear gives you wings\". The Viking's chief, Timandahaf, misinterprets his adviser's words and declares they must find a \"Champion of Fear\", believing that if the tribe were to become great cowards, they'll be able to fly and become invincible. Cryptograf, secretly wishing to seize power from Timandahaf, goes along with it and declares that they'll find who they seek within [[Gaul]]. While en route, Timandahaf is shocked to learn that his daughter Abba snuck aboard disguised as a man, after he refused to take her with him. Despite being angry, he reluctantly keeps her among his crew.\n\nMeanwhile, in the rebel village of the Gauls, the villagers welcome the arrival of chief Vitalstatistix's nephew Justforkix, who is to be trained to be a man. However, his nephew is more interested in chasing girls, using a bird to send messages to them, and is a [[vegetarian]], much to the shock of Obelix. Obelix and Asterix attempt to train him to be a warrior, but lack success because of his pacifist nature and his refusal to drink the village's magic potion, which gives the villagers their super-human strength. When the Vikings arrive near their village, Cryptograf explains to his incredibly stupid son [[Characters in Asterix|Olaf]] that he could claim Abba as his wife if he were to capture the Champion, thus putting him next in line as the tribe's chief, with his father secretly calling the shots.\n\nWhen Olaf captures Justforkix, after witnessing his cowardice, Asterix and Obelix find themselves having to rescue him before his father visits their village. Travelling to [[Norway]], the pair attempt to rescue Justforkix. However, he refuses to leave as he has fallen in love with Abba and she with him. When the vikings test Justforkix's flying skills by throwing him from a cliff, Cryptograf secretly rigs up a rope to him that causes him to be suspended in the foggy air. Tricked into believing he is the Champion, the Vikings rush to Olaf's wedding ceremony, leaving Justforkix to be rescued by Asterix and Obelix. Before they can take him back to Gaul, Justforkix secretly takes some magic potion, and swims back to the Viking's village.\n\nDespite the risk, Justforkix rescues Abba, managing to fly by making an improvised [[hang-glider]] from a ship's mast and sail. While Cryptograf and Olaf are shunned for their deception, the Vikings travel back to the Gauls' village to celebrate the wedding of Justforkix and Abba. When Cacofonix decides to sing during the ceremony, the Vikings finally experience real fear and make a run for it. When Asterix asks him what fear is good for, Getafix explains how real courage means overcoming fears.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character(s)\n! Original French version\n!

Some other elements from this book include the Viking party, and joke about Obelix supply for the journey. The dog from the book makes a cameo.\n* The scene when Asterix and Obelix dress up as Vikings \"Asteraf\" and \"Obelaf\", with Obelix unable to stop laughing about it, resembles the scene from ''[[Asterix and the Goths]]'' when the duo dress up as [[Roman empire|Romans]] \"Asterus\" and \"Obelus\". However, Obelix did find the names of the Normans hysterical in [[Asterix and the Normans]], because they all ended in -af.\n* The character of Cryptograf is similar to Prolix from ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]''.\n* The scene in which the Gauls attack a Roman camp for Justforkix's amusement is similar to a scene in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]''.\n* The character Influenza, from the book ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', appears during the party scene, dancing briefly with Justforkix, and at the end of the movie, serving boars at Justforkix' wedding party.\n* The wig on Olaf's bride/menhir is in the form of Panacea's wig from ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]''.\n\n== Box office ==\n* In the [[Netherlands]], the film has grossed a total of [[Euro|\u20ac]] 361,747.{{r|HUxS6}} The Dutch name for the film is \"Asterix en de Vikingen\".\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Nuhmo\">{{cite web\n  | title      = AST\u00c9RIX ET LES VIKINGS\n  | url        = http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&country=SE&id=_fASTERIXETLESVIKI01\n  | publisher  = Box Office Mojo\n  | access-date = 26 November 2011\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"HUxS6\">{{cite web\n  | url         = http://www.sneakpoint.nl/boxoffice.php\n  | title       = Boxoffice NL\n  | publisher   = Sneakpoint.nl\n  | access-date  = 31 December 2010\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060626033620/http://www.sneakpoint.nl/boxoffice.php\n  | archive-date = 26 June 2006\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0371552|Ast\u00e9rix et les Vikings}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|asterix_and_the_vikings}}\n\n{{Asterix|Vikings, Asterix and the|type=film}}\n\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:2006 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:French animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Danish animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:French children's films]]\n[[Category:Danish children's films]]\n[[Category:Asterix films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Norway]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Viking Age]]\n[[Category:Animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on comics]]\n[[Category:Films set in Europe]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jesper M\u00f8ller]]\n[[Category:2000s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
