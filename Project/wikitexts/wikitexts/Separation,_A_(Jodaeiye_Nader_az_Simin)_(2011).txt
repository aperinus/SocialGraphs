It focuses on an Iranian [[middle-class]] couple who separate, the disappointment and desperation suffered by their daughter due to the egotistical disputes and separation of her parents, and the conflicts that arise when the husband hires a [[Working class|lower-class]] [[caregiver]] for his elderly father, who suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]].\n\n''A Separation'' won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2012, becoming the first Iranian film to win the award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-oscars-aseparation-idUSTRE81Q06X20120227|title=Iran wins first Oscar with 'A Separation'|work=[[Reuters]]|date=27 February 2012|access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref> It received the [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] for Best Film and the Silver Bears for [[Silver Bear for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Silver Bear for Best Actor|Best Actor]] at the [[61st Berlin International Film Festival]], becoming the first Iranian film to win the Golden Bear.<ref name=Spiegel>{{cite news | title = Iranian Film Takes Top Prize at Berlinale | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,746610,00.html | date=19 February 2011 | access-date=20 February 2011}}</ref> It also won the Golden Globe for [[69th Golden Globe Awards|Best Foreign Language Film]]<ref name=GGwin/> and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards|Asia Pacific Screen Award]] for Best Feature Film.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.asiapacificscreenawards.com/apsa-nominees-winners?nomination-winner-name=nominee&apsa-year-name=2017 | title=APSA Nominees & Winners }}</ref> The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]],<ref name=OscarNom/> making it the [[List of foreign-language films nominated for Academy Awards#Writing (Original Screenplay)|first non-English film in five years]] to achieve this.\n\n==Plot==\nNader, Simin, and their 11-year-old daughter, Termeh, are a secular, middle-class family living in a flat in [[Tehran]]. Simin wants the whole family to leave [[Iran]] and has prepared the visas, but Nader wishes to stay to care for his father, who lives with them, and has [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Simin therefore files for [[Divorce (Islamic)|divorce]], but the [[family court]] considers the grounds to be insufficient and rejects the application. Simin moves back to her parents\u2019 home and Termeh stays with her father.\n\nNader hires Razieh, a deeply religious woman from a poor and distant suburb, to take care of his father during the day. She comes each day with her young daughter, Somayeh. She soon finds that she cannot cope, in particular because the old man has become incontinent. One day, when Razieh and Somayeh are busy, he slips out and wanders in the street. Razieh hastens out and dodges through the traffic to get to him.\n\nThe next day, Nader and Termeh come home early and discover the old man lying unconscious on the floor in his bedroom, tied to the bed. Razieh and Somayeh are out. When they return, Razieh says she had some urgent personal business; Nader accuses her of neglecting his father and stealing some money (which Simin had in fact used to pay some [[Moving company|movers]]). When Razieh refuses to leave until he pays her, he pushes her out of the flat. She apparently falls down some steps. Nader and Simin later learn that Razieh has suffered a [[miscarriage]].\n\nIf Nader knew of Razieh's pregnancy and caused the miscarriage, he could be guilty of murder. There is now a series of claims and counter-claims before a criminal judge: on one side, Nader, with Simin and Temeh; on the other, Razieh and her husband, Hodjat. He is a hot-tempered man, embittered and humiliated by the loss of his long-time job as a cobbler, and harassed by creditors. More than once, he attempts to assault Nader.\n\nRazieh says that Nader knew of her pregnancy because he heard a conversation in the flat between her and Termeh\u2019s tutor, in which the tutor recommended a doctor to her. Nader denies this, and the tutor gives evidence in his support. Termeh finds reasons to believe this is not true, and Nader at last admits to her that he has lied for her sake and his father\u2019s: he cannot go to prison. The tutor withdraws her evidence. To protect her father, Termeh tells the judge that he did not know of the pregnancy until she told him.\n\nNader claims that when he pushed Razieh out of the flat, she could not have fallen down the steps, but would have been protected by the railing. Razieh confesses to Simin that when she went out to bring back the old man, she was hit by a car and was in pain that night; this was the day before Nader pushed her, and she had gone out that day to see a doctor.\n\nHodjat is violent, and Simin fears for Termeh\u2019s safety. Simin persuades Nader to make a payment to Hodjat, but Nader first asks Razieh to swear on the [[Qur'an]] that he is the cause of her miscarriage. She cannot do so. Hodjat cannot force her, and begins hitting himself in a rage.\n\nLater, at the family court, Nader and Simin are granted a divorce. As the film ends, they wait separately outside the court while Termeh tells the judge which parent she chooses to live with.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Leila Hatami]] as Simin, a teacher and mother in Tehran\n*[[Peyman Moaadi]] as Nader, Simin's husband of 14 years\n*[[Sarina Farhadi]] as Termeh, Simin and Nader's teenaged daughter\n*[[Sareh Bayat]] as Razieh, devout wife and mother employed as a caregiver for Nader's father\n*[[Shahab Hosseini]] as Hodjat, Razieh's troubled and unemployed husband\n*[[Kimia Hosseini]] as Somayeh, Razieh and Hodjat's young daughter\n*[[Merila Zarei]] as Mrs Ghahraei, Termeh's teacher \n*[[Babak Karimi]] as Judge\n*[[Shirin Yazdanbakhsh]] as Simin's mother and Nader's mother-in-law\n*[[Ali-Asghar Shahbazi]] as Nader's elderly father, suffering from severe Alzheimer's\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe concept came from a number of personal experiences and abstract pictures which had been in [[Asghar Farhadi]]'s mind for some time. Once he decided to make the film, about a year before it premiered, it was quickly written and financed. Farhadi described the film as the \"logical development\" from his previous film, ''[[About Elly]]''. Like Farhadi's last three films, ''A Separation'' was made without any government support. The financing went without trouble much thanks to the success of ''About Elly''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wiseman|first=Andreas|date=18 February 2011|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reports/one-on-one/asghar-farhadi/5024047.article|title=One on One: Asghar Farhadi|work=[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]|access-date=19 February 2011}}</ref> The production was granted {{USD|25000}} in support from the [[Motion Picture Association]]'s [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards|APSA]] Academy Film Fund.<ref>{{cite web |date=4 February 2011 |url=http://www.businessofcinema.com/news.php?newsid=17677 |title=Berlin debut for MPA & APSA supported Iranian film |work=Business of Cinema |publisher=Join The Dots Media |access-date=17 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206195523/http://www.businessofcinema.com/news.php?newsid=17677 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, Farhadi was banned from making the film by the Iranian [[Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance]], because of an acceptance speech held during an award ceremony where he expressed support for several Iranian film personalities.
