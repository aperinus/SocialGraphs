The film, an atypical [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] for its creator, was written, directed, produced and later scored by [[Charlie Chaplin]]. It is also known as '''''A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate'''''.<ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/W/WomanOfParis1923.html Progressive Silent Film List: ''A Woman of Paris''] at silentera.com</ref><ref>[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=13437 The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: ''A Woman of Paris'']</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMarie St. Clair and her beau, aspiring artist Jean Millet, plan to leave their small French village for Paris, where they will marry. On the night before their scheduled departure, Marie leaves her house for a rendezvous with Jean. Marie's stepfather locks her out of the house, telling her to find shelter elsewhere.\n\nJean invites Marie to his parents' home, but his father also refuses to let her stay. Jean escorts Marie to the train station, and promises to return after going home to pack. When he arrives at home, he discovers his father has died. When Jean telephones Marie at the station to tell her they must postpone their trip, she gets on the train without him.\n\nOne year later in Paris, Marie enjoys a life of luxury as the mistress of wealthy businessman Pierre Revel. A friend calls and invites Marie to a raucous party in the [[Latin Quarter]]. She gives Marie the address but can't remember whether the apartment is in the building on the right or the left. Marie enters the wrong building and is surprised to be greeted by Jean Millet, who shares a modest apartment with his mother. Marie tells Jean she would like for him to paint her portrait and gives him a card with her address.\n\nJean calls on Marie at her apartment to begin the painting. Marie notices he is wearing a black armband and asks why he is in mourning. Jean tells Marie his father died the night she left without him.\n\nMarie and Jean revive their romance, and Marie distances herself from Pierre Revel. Jean finishes Marie's portrait, but instead of painting her wearing the elegant outfit she chose for the sitting, he paints her in the simple dress she wore on the night she left for Paris.\n\nJean proposes to Marie. Jean's mother fights with him over the proposal. Marie arrives unexpectedly outside Jean's apartment just in time to overhear Jean pacify his mother, telling her that he proposed in a moment of weakness. Jean fails to convince Marie he did not mean what she overheard, and she returns to Pierre Revel.\n\nThe following night, Jean slips a gun into his coat pocket and goes to the exclusive restaurant where Marie and Pierre are dining. Jean and Pierre get into a scuffle, and Jean is ejected from the dining room. Jean fatally shoots himself in the foyer of the restaurant.\n\nThe police carry Jean's body to his apartment. Jean's mother retrieves the gun and goes to Marie's apartment, but Marie has gone to Jean's studio. Jean's mother returns and finds Marie sobbing by Jean's body. The two women reconcile and return to the French countryside, where they open a home for orphans in a country cottage.\n\nOne morning, Marie and one of the girls in her care walk down the lane to get a pail of milk. Marie and the girl meet a group of [[sharecropper]]s who offer them a ride back in their horse-drawn wagon. At the same time, Pierre Revel and another gentleman are riding through the French countryside in a chauffeur-driven automobile. Pierre's companion asks him what had happened to Marie St. Clair. Pierre replies that he does not know. The automobile and the horse-drawn wagon pass each other, heading in opposite directions.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edna Purviance]] as Marie St. Clair\n* [[Clarence Geldart]] as Marie's Father\n* [[Carl Miller (actor)|Carl Miller]] as Jean Millet\n* [[Lydia Knott]] as Jean's Mother\n* [[Charles K.

The most obvious is that he does not appear in the film, at least not in his traditional role of the Tramp. He has a brief cameo as a porter in a train station. This role is inconspicuous and not credited (he even precedes the film with a title card which explains that he does not appear). Most people seeing the film will not notice that it is actually Chaplin. The other major difference between this and most of Chaplin's other work is that the film is a serious drama.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n[[Edna Purviance]] plays the lead as Marie St. Clair. One of Chaplin's reasons for producing the film was to help Purviance gain recognition as an actress without Chaplin at her side. Others were because he wanted to stay behind the camera and to make his first real drama. Despite his effort, Purviance did not achieve the level of success that she had in films with Chaplin's Tramp at her side. However, the film did help [[Adolphe Menjou]] gain some recognition.\n\nThe film was inspired by Chaplin's brief 1922 romance with [[Peggy Hopkins Joyce]], whose stories of her romantic adventures in Europe provided the framework of the screenplay.\n\nThe exterior scenes were shot outside the Ansonia Apartments on W. 6th Street and Lake Street, Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\"google/maps/Ansonia\">{{cite web |title=Ansonia Apartments |url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ansonia+Apartments+%2F+J+E+B+Properties,+Inc./@34.060223,-118.2762765,3a,75y,359.95h,92.71t/ |website=[[Google Maps]] |access-date=25 September 2022 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Ansonia Apartments .jpg|thumb|The Ansonia Apartments, Lake Street entrance near W. 6th Street,<ref name=\"google/maps/Ansonia\"/> Historic Westlake District of Los Angeles, Exterior Filming Location for Charles Chaplin's Silent Film ''A Woman Of Paris'', 1923]]\n\n[[File:Exterior Filming Location Ansonia Apartments L.A.jpg|thumb|The Ansonia Apartments, Lake Street entrance near W. 6th Street,<ref name=\"google/maps/Ansonia\"/> Historic Westlake District of Los Angeles, Film Frame from Charles Chaplin's Silent Film ''A Woman Of Paris'', 1923]]\n\nChaplin and music associate Eric James created a score for a theatrical reissue. Chaplin elected to trim the film (approximately 8 minutes of footage was removed) for the reissue version to further tighten the action. The Museum of Modern Art held the world premiere of ''A Woman of Paris'' with Chaplin\u2019s new music soundtrack on December 23, 1976. The reissue version was given a theatrical release in 1977.<ref>Vance, Jeffrey (2003). ''Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema''. New York: Harry N. Abrams. p. 153. {{ISBN|0-8109-4532-0}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nUpon release ''A Woman of Paris'' was not well received. Chaplin was very popular at the time, and many went to the film expecting to see Chaplin in his traditional comedic role. An attempt was made to ease the public into the idea of Chaplin making a movie without starring in it. At the premiere Chaplin had flyers distributed informing those in line that ''A Woman in Paris'' diverged from his normal work, and that he hoped the public would find it enjoyable. There is also an opening statement in the film that Chaplin does not appear in it. Some {{who|date=July 2014}} film historians have speculated that ''A Woman in Paris'' might have been received differently if the public had not been forewarned of Chaplin's absence from the cast.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nCritical response to the film, on the other hand, was very positive. The film has been credited with influencing later filmmakers. In particular, the motivations and personalities of its characters had a complexity that was unconventional in the context of early 1920s American cinema. Chaplin biographer [[Jeffrey Vance]] champions ''A Woman of Paris'' and writes at length in ''Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema'' of the film's importance. Vance notes,\n\n<blockquote>\"Most examinations of ''A Woman of Paris'' select a key scene such as Marie on the train platform or Pierre removing a handkerchief from Marie\u2019s dresser drawer, or the natural and simple approach to performance as the basis of the film\u2019s critical laurels, while overlooking Chaplin\u2019s overall construction of the visual narrative.  However, the film\u2019s greatness is not limited to a few isolated scenes. Chaplin\u2019s directorial skill and the film\u2019s power are demonstrated in the careful and direct way that Chaplin tells a simple story. Chaplin achieved his purpose of conveying 'psychology by subtle action' throughout the visual narrative by imbuing the d\u00e9cor with symbolism, by using objects for their metaphoric and metonymic value, and by parallel storytelling and editing.\"<ref>Vance, Jeffrey (2003). ''Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema''. New York: Harry N. Abrams. p. 146. {{ISBN|0-8109-4532-0}}.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nIt can be considered the first Chaplin feature, since it is the first one made by the company he co-founded, [[United Artists]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}{{clarify|August|2018|reason=Why does this make it the first \"Chaplin feature\", given he had full control over many other pictures? Why should company ownership matter?|date=August 2018}} [[Mary Pickford]] named it a favorite. ''\"Woman of Paris'' allows us to think for ourselves and does not constantly underestimate our intelligence. It is a gripping human story throughout and the director allows the situations to play themselves. The actors simply react the emotions of the audience.\" \"Charlie Chaplin is the greatest director of the screen,\" she said on another occasion. \"He's a pioneer. How he knows women!\u2014oh, how he knows women! I do not cry easily when seeing a picture, but after seeing Charlie's ''A Woman of Paris'' I was all choked up\u2014I wanted to go out in the garden and have it out by myself.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howe |first=Herbert |date=January 1924 |title=Mary Pickford's Favorite Stars and Films |url=https://archive.org/stream/pho26chic#page/n31/mode/2up |journal=[[Photoplay]] |location=New York |publisher=Photoplay Publishing Company |access-date=September 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''A Woman of Paris'', like other films at that time, was subject to [[Film censorship in the United States|censorship by state and local boards]]. For example, the [[Pennsylvania State Board of Censors]] found the film acceptable only with revisions, and, even though Massachusetts passed the film, the local board of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] banned the film as being \"morally objectionable.\"<ref name=\"MPW\">{{cite journal |title=''A Woman of Paris'' Banned from Worcester, Mass. by Local Board |journal=The Moving Picture World |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=124 |publisher=Chalmers Publishing Co. |location=New York City |date=10 January 1925 |url=https://archive.org/details/movingpicturewor72janf/page/124/mode/1up |access-date=7 July 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe film's box office failure was painful for Chaplin, and after its initial release it was not seen by the public for over fifty years. Chaplin reissued the edited film with a new musical score\u2014replacing the original score by [[Louis F. Gottschalk]]\u2014in 1976, a year before his death. His new composition is credited as the final completed work of his 75-year career.\n\nThe movie has a 92% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 12 reviews {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_woman_of_paris_a_drama_of_fate|title=Rotten Tomatoes: A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|display=''A Woman of Paris''|d=Q470895|c=Category:A Woman of Paris|s=A Woman of Paris (film)|wikt=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|species=no|n=no|q=no}}\n* {{YouTube|IvHHQb-_TU4|''A Woman of Paris''}}\n* {{IMDb title|0014624}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=442072}}\n* {{AFI film|id=13437|title=A Woman of Paris}}\n* [http://silenthollywood.com/awomanofparis1923.html Lantern slide, lobby card, and stills] at silenthollywood.com\n\n{{Charlie Chaplin filmography}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Woman Of Paris, A}}\n[[Category:1923 films]]\n[[Category:1923 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American silent feature films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Charlie Chaplin]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:United Artists films]]\n[[Category:1920s American films]]\n[[Category:Silent romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Silent American drama films]]"}]}}}}
