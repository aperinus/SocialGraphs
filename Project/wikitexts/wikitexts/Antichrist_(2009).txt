It tells the story of a couple who, after the accidental death of their son, retreat to a cabin in the woods where the man experiences strange visions and the woman manifests increasingly violent sexual behavior and [[sadomasochism]]. The narrative is divided into a prologue, four chapters and an epilogue.\n\nWritten in 2006 while von Trier had been hospitalized due to a significant [[Clinical depression|depressive episode]], the film was largely influenced by his own struggles with depression and [[anxiety]]. Filming began in the late summer of 2008, primarily in [[Germany]], and was a Danish production co-produced by several other film production companies from six different European countries.\n\nAfter its premiere at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], where von Trier won the [[Silver Lion]] and Gainsbourg won the festival's award for [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]], the film immediately received polarizing feedback, with critics generally praising its artistic execution but remaining strongly divided regarding its substantive merit, although its criticism and controversy aimed for its depiction of graphic sex and violence. Other awards won by the film include the [[Bodil Award for Best Danish Film]], the [[Robert Award for Best Danish Film]], [[The Nordic Council Film Prize]] for best [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] film and the [[European Film Awards|European Film Award]] for best cinematography. The film is dedicated to the Soviet filmmaker [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] (1932\u201386).\n\n''Antichrist'' is the first film in von Trier's unofficially titled ''Depression Trilogy''. It was followed in 2011 by ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' and then by ''[[Nymphomaniac (film)|Nymphomaniac]]'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/03/20/nyphomaniac-volumes-i-and-ii-reviewed-lars-von-triers-sexually-graphic-pairing-will-titillate-but-fails-to-satisfy/ |title = ''Nyphomaniac'', ''Volumes I'' and ''II'', reviewed: Lars von Trier's sexually graphic pairing will titillate, but fails to satisfy |last = Knight |first = Chris |date = 20 March 2014 |work = [[National Post]]|access-date = 15 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: center;\"| Chapters\n|-\n| Prologue\n|-\n| One: Grief\n|-\n| Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)\n|-\n| Three: Despair (Gynocide)\n|-\n| Four: The Three Beggars\n|-\n| Epilogue\n|}\n\nAn unnamed couple has sex in their [[Seattle]] apartment while their toddler son, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls to his death. The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with [[Complicated grief disorder|atypical grief]]. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with [[psychotherapy]]. She reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, prompting him to try [[exposure therapy]]. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis criticizing [[gynocide]]. During the hike, he encounters a [[deer|doe]] that shows no fear of him and has a [[stillborn]] fawn hanging halfway out of her.\n\nDuring sessions of psychotherapy, the woman becomes increasingly grief-stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man; [[acorn]]s rapidly pelt the metal roof, he wakes up with a hand covered in swollen [[ticks]], and finds a self-[[Disembowelment|disemboweling]] [[red fox]] that tells him, \"Chaos reigns!\" In the dark attic the man finds the woman's thesis studies, which includes violent portraits of [[witch-hunts]], and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man reprimands her for this, and in a frenzied moment, they have violent [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that [[Satan]] is her greatest hidden fear.\n\nUpon viewing Nic's [[autopsy]] and photos she took of him while they stayed at Eden, the man becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nic's shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in a [[foot deformity]]. While in the woodshed, she attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his groin, causing him to lose consciousness. She then [[masturbates]] him, [[Ejaculation|ejaculating]] blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy [[grindstone]] through the wound, and tosses the wrench she used under the cabin. The man awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into a deep [[Red fox#Denning behaviour|foxhole]] at the base of the dead tree. Following the sound of a [[American crow|crow]] he has found buried alive in the hole, the woman locates, attacks, then [[Premature burial|partially buries]] him.\n\nNight falls; now remorseful, the woman unburies the man but cannot remember where the wrench is. She helps him back to the cabin, where she tells him that only \"when the Three Beggars arrive\" he can die. The woman recounts that she saw Nic climbing up to the window on the night of his death, but did not act, displaying her perceived essential evil. In the cabin, she cuts off her [[clitoris]]. The two are then visited by the crow (symbol of despair), the deer (symbol of grief), and the fox (symbol of pain), referred to as  the Three Beggars. A hailstorm begins; earlier it was revealed that women accused of witchcraft had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. When he finds the wrench under the cabin's floorboards, she attacks him with scissors, but he manages to unbolt the grindstone. Finally free, he strangles her to death, then burns her body on a [[funeral pyre]].\n\nThe man limps from the cabin, eating [[Berry|wild berries]], as the Three Beggars look on, now translucent and glowing. Reaching the top of a hill, under a brilliant light he watches in awe as hundreds of women in antiquated clothes come towards him, their faces blurred.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as an unnamed married man, credited as \"He\"\n* [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as an unnamed woman married to the man, credited as \"She\"\n* Stavroula Karalidou as Nic, the couple's toddler son who dies in the beginning of the film\n\n==Analysis==\n===Nature and religion===\nFilm scholar Magdalena Zolkos interprets ''Antichrist'' as an \"origins story,\" citing its unnamed characters and setting\u2014a woods called Eden\u2014as primary reasons.{{sfn|Zolkos|2016|pages=141\u2013143}} Zolkos's interpretation of the film aligns with that of scholar Joanne Bourke, who cites the film as a retelling of [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic origins]] \"framed as a question.\"{{sfn|Zolkos|2016|p=141}} The couple's entrance into the woods and arrival at Eden \"initiates a cinematic restaging of the myths of origins.\"{{sfn|Zolkos|2016|p=149}} The woman's statement made to her husband{{em dash}}that nature is \"[[Satan]]'s church\"{{em dash}}suggests a \"triadic nexus of nature, demonic force and the death of the child.\"{{sfn|Zolkos|2016|p=151}} Zolkos characterizes this nexus as being made of three \"separate, psychic events: the inscrutable and threatening surroundings of the forest;

In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Von Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Von Trier said: \"At the same time that we hang it on our walls over the fireplace or whatever, it represents pure Hell.\"<ref name=\"hatewomen\" /> In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether ''Antichrist'' really could be classified as a horror film, because \"it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film.

One shot, where the couple is having sex under a tree, was particularly difficult since the camera would switch from being hand-held to motion controlled in the middle of the take.<ref name=\"amv\" />\n\nVon Trier had not recovered completely from his depression when filming started.
