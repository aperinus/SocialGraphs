Co-written by Barratier and {{Interlanguage link multi|Philippe Lopes-Curval|fr}}, it is an adaptation of the 1945 film ''[[A Cage of Nightingales]]'' (''La Cage aux rossignols''). The story is inspired by the origin of the boys' choir [[The Little Singers of Paris]].\n\nAt the [[77th Academy Awards]], ''The Chorus'' was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Song (the latter for \"''Vois sur ton chemin''\", listed as \"Look to Your Path\", composed by [[Bruno Coulais]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn 2003, Pierre Morhange ([[Jacques Perrin]]), a French [[Conducting|conductor]] performing in the United States, is informed before a concert that his mother has died. After the performance he returns to his home in France for her funeral. An old friend named P\u00e9pinot ([[Didier Flamand]]) arrives at his door with a diary which belonged to their teacher, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu. They proceed to read it together.\n\nIn 1949, fifty-four years earlier, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu ([[G\u00e9rard Jugnot]]), a failed musician, arrives at Fond de l'\u00c9tang (\"Bottom of the Pond\"), a French boarding school for troubled boys of all ages, to work as a supervisor and teacher. At the gate, he sees a very young boy, P\u00e9pinot ([[Maxence Perrin]]), waiting for Saturday, when he says his father will pick him up. The viewers later learn that his parents were killed in the Second World War during the Nazi occupation of France, but P\u00e9pinot does not know this.\n\nMathieu discovers the boys being ruthlessly punished by the very strict headmaster, Rachin ([[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]]) and attempts to use humour and kindness to win them over. When a [[booby trap]] set by one of the boys, Le{{nbsp}}Querrec, injures the school's elderly caretaker, Maxence ([[Jean-Paul Bonnaire]]), Mathieu keeps the culprit's identity from the headmaster, while encouraging Le{{nbsp}}Querrec to nurse Maxence during his recovery.\n\nOn discovering the boys singing rude songs about him, Mathieu forms a plan: he will teach them to sing and form a choir as a form of discipline. He groups the boys according to their [[Voice type#Children's voices|voice types]], but one student, Pierre Morhange ([[Jean-Baptiste Maunier]]), refuses to sing. Mathieu catches Morhange singing to himself, discovers he has a wonderful singing voice and awards him solo parts on the condition that he behaves.\n\nMorhange's single mother, Violette ([[Marie Bunel]]), arrives at the school. When Mathieu goes to explain that Morhange cannot be visited because he has been locked up as a punishment, he finds himself pitying and being attracted to the boy's beleaguered mother and instead tells her that Morhange is at the dentist. Meanwhile, a cruel, uncontrollable boy named Mondain ({{ill|Gr\u00e9gory Gatignol|fr}}) arrives and begins causing trouble by bullying the others, influencing others to be like him and generally being rebellious. After stealing a watch, he is locked up for two weeks.\n\nThe choir is improving rapidly with Morhange as its lead soloist; the children are happier, and the faculty less strict \u2014 even Rachin begins to loosen up, playing football with the boys and making a paper aeroplane. After Mondain is released from lock-up, he runs away and seemingly steals all the school's money. After Mondain is captured, Rachin repeatedly beats him, until Mondain in turn attempts to strangle Rachin. Rachin hands him over to the police, still not knowing the location of the stolen money, and disbands the choir. Mathieu begins teaching his choir \"underground\", practising at night in their dormitory.\n\nMathieu continues to meet Morhange's mother, who is unaware of his attraction to her. He plans to help her son win a scholarship to the [[Music school#Conservatory|music conservatory]] in [[Lyon]]. One day she blithely informs him that she has met someone: an engineer. Mathieu is dejected but expresses his feigned happiness and watches her leave in the engineer's car.\n\nThe Countess, a sponsor of the school, finds out about the choir; they perform before her and others, and Morhange enchants the audience with his solo. Mathieu discovers that another boy, Corbin, stole the money that Mondain was accused of taking. Despite this, Rachin refuses to accept Mondain back at the school.\n\nWhen Rachin departs to accept an award from the board after taking credit for the choir, Mathieu and Maxence suspend classes and take the boys on an outing. While they are out, Mondain returns and sets fire to the school. Mathieu is fired for breaking the rules, even though he saved the boys' lives, and Maxence is suspended. As Mathieu leaves, the boys \u2014forbidden to say goodbye \u2014 lock themselves in their classroom, sing and throw farewell messages out of the window on paper planes. Touched, Mathieu walks away, musing about how he has failed and nobody knows of his existence.\n\nBack in the present, the adult Morhange finishes reading the diary and recounts what happened afterwards: he won his scholarship to the conservatory, and Rachin was fired after his fellow teachers exposed his abuse towards the students. Mathieu, P\u00e9pinot relates, continued to give music lessons quietly for the rest of his life.\n\nThe final scene (in the past again) shows Mathieu waiting for his bus after being fired. As he boards it, he looks back and finds P\u00e9pinot running after him, insisting that he come too. Initially, Mathieu refuses because it is not allowed, and he leaves P\u00e9pinot behind. Suddenly, the bus stops and Mathieu gives in: the two board the bus together. P\u00e9pinot finally got his wish, for he and Mathieu left on a Saturday, and Mathieu raised him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[G\u00e9rard Jugnot]] as Clement Mathieu, a supervisor and failed musician\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]] as Rachin, the strict headmaster of Fond de L'\u00c9tang\n* [[Jean-Baptiste Maunier]] as Pierre Morhange, a poorly behaved boy with a beautiful singing voice\n** [[Jacques Perrin]] as adult Morhange, now a popular conductor\n* [[Maxence Perrin]] as P\u00e9pinot, a young boy who refuses to believe his parents are dead\n** [[Didier Flamand]] as adult P\u00e9pinot\n* [[Kad Merad]] as Chabert, a physical education teacher\n* [[Jean-Paul Bonnaire]] as Maxence, the school's elderly caretaker\n* [[Marie Bunel]] as Violette Morhange, the single mother of Pierre\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Gr\u00e9gory Gatignol|fr}} as Mondain, a troubled and malevolent older boy\n* Cyril Bernicot as Le Querrec, the perpetrator of a booby trap which injures Maxence\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:BARRRATIER Christophe-24x30-2008b.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Chorus'' was director Christophe Barratier's first feature film.]]\nAfter making the short film ''Les Tombales'', director [[Christophe Barratier]] was looking for a subject for his first feature film. He noticed that many of his ideas were linked to his childhood, and the emotions he felt between the ages of four and eight. Coming from a musical background, he also wanted to tell a story linked to music. The themes of childhood and music made him think of the film ''[[La Cage aux rossignols]]'', which he had seen on television at a young age and which \"touched [him] profoundly\".<ref name=\"press\">{{cite web|title=Les Choristes|url=http://www.vegafilm.com/media/uploads/35/presstexts/les-choristes-press-texte-fr_.pdf|type=Press pack|publisher=[[Path\u00e9]]|access-date=31 August 2013|language=fr}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> Barratier told his idea to [[G\u00e9rard Jugnot]], whom he had known for quite a long time and with whom he shared a taste for old French cinema and actors such as [[No\u00ebl-No\u00ebl]]; Jugnot liked it but thought that the film would have to be set in the past, otherwise his character would be transformed into someone who \"teaches [[rapping]] in the suburbs\". Barratier said he did not think about setting the film in the present time because \"Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu [would have] other priorities, he would have nothing in common with a 1950s music teacher\". Barratier then began writing the script; Jugnot said that the first version somewhat \"lacked roughness\", and co-writer Philippe Lopes-Curval got involved. He collaborated with Barratier to strengthen the story and develop the psychology of characters such as Rachin\u2014for whom the children are \"the symbol of a failed professional life\"\u2014and Chabert.<ref name=\"press\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe director was keen that the role of the young Pierre Morhange should be played by a real singer, and the search for him was tedious. While touring large French choirs to choose the one to record the film's soundtrack, they discovered the 12-year-old [[Jean-Baptiste Maunier]] of [[Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc]]: Barratier described his voice as \"exceptional and very moving\", and composer Bruno Coulais said it was \"incredible\". They decided to cast him as Morhange and use the choir for the soundtrack, but that the rest of the choir would not play his classmates because the director did not want them to be professional actors. Instead, they looked for children near the filming location in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]]: casting director Sylvie Brocher\u00e9 visited primary and [[Secondary education in France#Coll\u00e8ge|secondary schools]] in [[Clermont-Ferrand]],<ref name=\"press\" /> looking for children between the ages of six and 15.<ref name=\"makingof\">{{cite AV media |year=2004 |title=Les Choristes : le making-of |trans-title=The Chorus: the making-of |medium=DVD |language=fr |publisher=[[Path\u00e9]]}}</ref> After over 2000 auditions, the roles were cast. Of all the children, only the Parisians Th\u00e9odule Carr\u00e9 Cassaigne and Thomas Blumenthal had some small acting experience.<ref name=\"press\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Reproduction du pensionnat du film Les Choristes (mus\u00e9e du train miniature de Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Chalaronne).JPG|thumb|A model of the boarding school featured in the film at a [[Rail transport modelling|miniature railway]] museum in [[Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Chalaronne]]]]\n[[Principal photography]] took place on location at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ravel]] in [[Puy-de-D\u00f4me]]. [[Foam]] and salt were used as [[Snowmaking|artificial snow]] and green leaves were removed from the grounds, since the beginning of the movie was filmed in the summer, but set in the winter. [[Fog machine]]s were also used around the castle, and walls were deliberately scorched and stripped of paint to give the surroundings a \"dilapidated\" look, since boarding schools at the time often suffered from poor funding and management.<ref name=\"makingof\" /> When filming his first scene in which his character Mondain tries to intimidate Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu, Gatignol had trouble behaving menacingly towards Jugnot, who described him as \"too nice\". For the scene in which Morhange drops ink on Mathieu's head, [[gouache]] was used. During choir scenes, song lyrics were written on large [[cue card]]s and the classroom's [[blackboard]] to aid actors. The children who played the choir described how their singing improved through the duration of the shoot; Nicolas Porte, the choirmaster of Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc, said that this \"means that the story we tell is credible\". Bruno Coulais, the composer of the film's score, said that the children \"are passionate about music\", which is \"some kind of escape to them\".<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{main|The Chorus (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack for ''The Chorus'' was released on 3 May 2004 by [[Warner Bros.

It features the film's original score, which was composed by [[Bruno Coulais]] and performed by the [[Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra]] (conducted by Deyan Pavlov) and the choir [[Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc]]. The album's 2012 release added five additional tracks, most of which are the orchestral backing tracks of other songs. [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]] summed it up by saying \"for enthusiasts of boys' choirs and heartwarming, sentimental choral performances in general, ''The Chorus'' translates into a strong, albeit repetitive album.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Les Choristes|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/chorus.html|work=[[Filmtracks.com]]|access-date=31 August 2013}} {{rating|4|5}}</ref> The soundtrack [[List of number-one hits of 2004 (France)|topped the albums chart in France]] for 11 weeks and reached number three in Belgium, before its United States release in early 2005.
