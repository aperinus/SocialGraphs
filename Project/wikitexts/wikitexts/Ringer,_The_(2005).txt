Directed by [[Barry W. Blaustein]], it was produced by the [[Farrelly brothers]]. The film was released on December 23, 2005, by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].\n\n== Plot ==\n\nOne day, Steve Barker ([[Johnny Knoxville]]) suddenly receives a promotion at work, and is forced to fire his friend Stavi ([[Luis \u00c1valos]]). Steve reluctantly does so, but hires him to work around his apartment. While working, Stavi loses three fingers in a lawn-mower accident, and reveals that he does not have health insurance; Steve decides to raise $28,000 within two weeks to pay for the surgery to re-attach Stavi's fingers. \n\nHis uncle Gary ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]), owes $40,000 in gambling debts and suggests that they [[Match fixing|fix]] the [[Special Olympics]] in [[San Marcos, Texas]] in order to solve both of their financial problems. Steve reluctantly enters the Special Olympics under the guise of being a high functioning young man named Jeffy Dahmor with a [[developmental disability]]. Gary, assuming that Steve will easily defeat the legitimate contenders, bets $100,000 that reigning champion Jimmy Washington (Leonard Flowers) won't win the gold medal. Despite initially being disgusted at pretending to be intellectually disabled, Steve goes along with it for Stavi.\n\nDuring the competition, Steve falls in love with Lynn ([[Katherine Heigl]]), a volunteer for the Special Olympics. During this time, six other contestants see through Steve's act, so he tells them the truth about Stavi. As Steve decides to leave after being exposed, they tell him to stay, resolving to help Steve save Stavi's fingers and because they want to see the arrogant Jimmy lose.\n\nIn the meantime, Steve befriends the other contestants: he encourages Thomas ([[Bill Chott]]) to talk to a girl he likes, and even takes the group to see a showing of ''[[Dirty Dancing]]''. Steve gradually gets to know Lynn more, but is dismayed to learn that she is seeing David ([[Zen Gesner]]); after Steve discovers that David was cheating behind Lynn's back, she breaks up with him. At one point, Steve feels remorse for taking part in the Special Olympics and tells a [[priest]] in a [[confession booth]], only for the priest to punch him in the face and kick him out of church.\n\nAt the final competition, Steve's friend Glen ([[Jed Rees]]) comes in first, with Steve coming in third behind Jimmy. During the medal ceremony, Steve admits that he is not developmentally disabled, reveals his true name, and gives his medal to Thomas, who had finished fourth. Lynn, upset at Steve, rebuffs him when he attempts to apologize to her. Uncle Gary still ends up winning his bet, as his condition was that Jimmy would lose.\n\nSix months later, Steve has quit his job and is working in theater, producing a play with the friends he made during the Special Olympics, as well as Stavi, who got his fingers reattached. Glen and the others trick Lynn into coming to the theater, and Steve starts to apologize. Lynn forgives him because Stavi told her why Steve pretended to be developmentally disabled, and they kiss.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Steve and his friends dance onstage with [[the Kids of Widney High]] as they perform the song \"[[Respect (song)|Respect]]\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Steve Barker\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Gary Barker\n* [[Katherine Heigl]] as Lynn Sheridan\n* [[Jed Rees]] as Glen Chervin\n* [[Bill Chott]] as Thomas Wetzig\n* [[Edward Barbanell]] as Billy B'Devore\n* [[Leonard Earl Howze]]  as Mark \n* [[Geoffrey Arend]] as Winston Kelso Smith\n* John Taylor as Rudy \n* [[Luis Avalos]] as Stavi \n* Leonard Flowers as Jimmy Washington\n\n<!-- Cameos/Cast/Casting -->\nProfessional wrestlers [[Terry Funk]] and [[Jesse Ventura]]'s cameo appearances came about due to their friendship with director Barry Blaustein, who met the pair whilst filming wrestling documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'' in the late 1990s. Funk portrayed one of the debt collectors, while Ventura lent his voice as a motivational speaker on tape. [[ESPN]] sportscaster [[Steve Levy]] also appears in the movie as himself.\n\n== Production notes ==\n\nThe film took seven years to get made due to its controversial subject.<ref name=\"msnbc\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.today.com/popculture/special-olympics-approve-ringer-wbna10385246\n| title = The Special Olympics approve of 'The Ringer'\n| publisher = The Associated Press\n| accessdate = 2009-10-09 \n}}</ref>\nThe Special Olympics committee eventually agreed to endorse the film, the film makers having given them final say on the script.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.specialolympics.org/Special+Olympics+Public+Website/English/Press_Room/Global_news/The+Ringer+opens+23+December.htm | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051224061140/http://www.specialolympics.org/Special+Olympics+Public+Website/English/Press_Room/Global_news/The+Ringer+opens+23+December.htm | archivedate = 2005-12-24 |work= Specialolympics.org|date=2005-10-13|title=Grab your popcorn and head to your local theater for The Ringer on 23 December}}</ref>\n\nProducer Farrelly is himself a longtime volunteer with [[Best Buddies]], a group that provides mentoring program for people with intellectual disabilities, and has prominently featured characters with disabilities in his previous films such as Warren the brother of Mary in ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' and Rocket in ''[[Stuck on You (film)|Stuck on You]]''.<ref name=\"msnbc\" />\n\nDuring the end credits, scenes from Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' are shown being performed, ending with the [[Kids of Widney High]] performing [[Aretha Franklin]]'s \"[[Respect (song)|Respect]].\"\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film-review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] lists 40% positive reviews based on 89 critics, with an average rating of 5.00/10.
