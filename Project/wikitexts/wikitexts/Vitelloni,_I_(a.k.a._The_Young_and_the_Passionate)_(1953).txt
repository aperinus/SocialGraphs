It stars [[Franco Interlenghi]], [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Franco Fabrizi]], [[Leopoldo Trieste]], and [[Riccardo Fellini]] (the director's brother)  as five young Italian men at crucial turning points in their small town lives.<ref name=\"IMDb\">{{cite web |title=I Vitelloni |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046521/ |access-date=30 April 2012 |website=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> Recognized as a pivotal work in the director's artistic [[evolution]], the film has distinct autobiographical elements that mirror important societal changes in 1950s Italy.<ref name=\"Kezich, 130\">Kezich, 130</ref>\n\nRecipient of both the [[Venice Film Festival]] Silver Lion in 1953, and an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing]] in 1958,<ref name=\"imdbawards\">{{cite web|title=Awards for I Vitelloni |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046521/awards |access-date=30 April 2012}}</ref> the film's success restored Fellini's reputation after the commercial failure of ''[[The White Sheik]]'' (1952). It also launched the career of its star Alberto Sordi, one of [[post-war]] Italy's most significant and popular [[comedian]]s.\n\n==Plot==\nAs summer draws to a close, a violent downpour interrupts a beach-side beauty pageant in a provincial town on the [[Adriatic coast]]. Sandra Rubini, crowned \"Miss Mermaid 1953\", suddenly grows upset and faints: rumours fly that she's expecting a baby by inveterate skirt chaser Fausto Moretti. Under pressure from Francesco, his respectable father, Fausto agrees to a [[shotgun wedding]]. After the sparsely attended middle-class ceremony, the newlyweds leave town on their honeymoon.\n\nUnemployed and living off their parents, Fausto's twenty-something<ref>\"The five youthful characters range in age between nineteen and the early twenties.\" Alpert, 81\u201382</ref> friends kill time shuffling from empty caf\u00e9s to seedy pool halls to aimless walks across desolate windswept beaches. During the interim, they perform childish pranks. Taunting honest road workers from the safety of a luxury car they never earned, they're given a sound thrashing when it breaks down.\n\nMoraldo, Sandra's brother and the youngest of the five ''vitelloni'', uncomfortably observes Fausto's womanizing as he ponders his own existence, dreaming of ways to escape to the big city. Riccardo, the baritone, nourishes unrealistic ambitions to sing and act. Alberto, the daydreamer, is supported by his mother and self-reliant sister, Olga. Vulnerable and close to his mother, he's unhappy that Olga is secretly dating a married man. Leopoldo, the aspiring dramatist, writes a play that he discusses with Sergio Natali, an eccentric stage actor he hopes will perform in it.\n\nBack from his honeymoon and settled in with Sandra, Fausto is forced to accept a job as a stockroom assistant in a religious-articles shop owned by Michele Curti ([[Carlo Romano]]), a friend of his father-in-law's. Incorrigible, Fausto pursues other women even in his wife's presence.\n\nAt the annual masquerade ball, Fausto is bedazzled by the mature beauty of Giulia Curti, his employer's wife. Alberto, in drag and half-drunk, executes a surrealistic dance across the ballroom floor with a goofy carnival head made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Returning home at dawn, Alberto is devastated to find his sister running off for good with her married lover. Fausto's naive attempt to seduce Giulia results in his being humiliated and then fired by her husband. In revenge, he steals the statue of an angel in gold paint from his former employer, enlisting the loyal Moraldo to help him first attempt to sell it to a convent and then sell it to a [[monk]]. Suspicious, both turn down the offers. Fausto ends up leaving the statue with a simple-minded peasant who sets the angel on a mound outside his hovel, caressing it.\n\nOne evening after a variety show, Leopoldo agrees to accompany old Sergio for a walk along the seashore to discuss the merits of his play but when the actor propositions him, he takes to his heels in horror. Learning of Fausto's one-night stand with a variety performer, Sandra runs away from home, taking the baby with her. Riccardo, Alberto, Leopoldo, and Moraldo all join in Fausto's desperate search to trace his wife and child. When they find her at the home of Fausto's father, Francesco pulls off his belt in a rage and finally whips his son.  Later, and reconciled for the present, Fausto and Sandra walk home happily and with optimism about their life together. Resolved to abandon the provincial monotony of his dead-end town, Moraldo boards the train for anyplace else (Rome), imagining his ''vitelloni'' friends sleeping and dreaming their lives away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Franco Interlenghi]] as Moraldo Rubini\n* [[Alberto Sordi]] as Alberto\n* [[Franco Fabrizi]] as Fausto Moretti\n* [[Leopoldo Trieste]] as Leopoldo Vannucci\n* [[Riccardo Fellini]] as Riccardo\n* [[Leonora Ruffo]] as Sandra Rubini, Moraldo's sister\n* [[Jean Brochard]] as Francesco Moretti, Fausto's father\n* [[Claude Farell]] as Olga, Alberto's sister\n* [[Carlo Romano]] as Signore Michele Curti\n* [[L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1]] as Signora Giulia Curti\n* [[Enrico Viarisio]] as Signore Rubini, Moraldo's father\n* [[Paola Borboni]] as Signora Rubini, Moraldo's mother\n* [[Achille Majeroni]] as Sergio Natali\n* Arlette Sauvage as mysterious woman at the cinema\n* [[Silvio Bagolini]] as simple-minded peasant\n* [[Vira Silenti]] as Gisella\n* Maja Nipora as Caterina, the [[soubrette]]<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for I Vitelloni |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046521/fullcredits |access-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>\n* Gigetta Morano as Alberto's mother\n* Guido Martufi as Guido\n* Silvio Bagolini as Giudizio\n* Milvia Chianelli as Maria\n* [[Lilia Landi]] as herself\n* [[Riccardo Cucciolla]] as the voice of the narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nHaving completed an early version of ''[[La strada|La Strada]]'' with co-screenwriter [[Tullio Pinelli]] in 1952, Fellini offered their \"modern fairy tale\"<ref name=\"Kezich, 130\"/> to producer [[Luigi Rovere]] with whom he was still under contract. Rovere had solid reasons for turning it down: apart from the script of ''La Strada'' being an unrecognizable genre, Fellini's last film, ''[[The White Sheik]]'', had been a critical and commercial flop. In a show of solidarity, Rovere loaned the script to a Venetian professor of [[calligraphy]] turned film producer, Lorenzo Pegoraro,  who had admired ''The White Sheik''.<ref name=\"Kezich, 130\"/> Convinced that ''La Strada'' would never attract an audience, Pegoraro requested that Fellini develop a comedy instead. Biographers differ as to who conceived ''I Vitelloni''. For [[Tullio Kezich]], it was Fellini who hit on the idea \"after an afternoon-long consultation\" with [[Ennio Flaiano]].<ref>Kezich, 131</ref> For [[Hollis Alpert]], it was Pinelli brain-storming with Fellini and Flaiano who came up \"with a notion the other two liked: the pleasures and frustrations of growing up in a provincial town\".<ref name=\"Alpert, 81\">Alpert, 81</ref> Under Fellini's supervision, all three together rapidly wrote the script, pooling their adolescent memories while inventing new ones.\n\n===Title===\nDistributors interested in the script demanded a title change: incomprehensible to a general audience, ''I vitelloni'' was a liability to an already risky venture. Fellini adamantly refused to change it, having chosen the film's title after \"being called a ''vitellone'' by an elderly woman expressing disapproval of one of his pranks\".<ref name=\"Alpert, 81\"/> For him, ''vitelloni'' were \"the unemployed of the middle class, mother's pets. They shine during the holiday season, and waiting for it takes up the rest of the year\".<ref name=\"Alpert, 81\"/> According to biographer Alpert, the term was [[Romagnol language|Romagnol]] for \"[[veal]], or [[Calf (animal)|calf]]&nbsp;... used to refer to callow youths\". Today, the term is widely translated as \"big calves\".\n\nThe actual origin of the term has been defined as a cross between the Italian words for [[veal]] (''vitello'') and [[beef]] (''bovino'') implying \"an immature, lazy person without a clear identity or any notion of what to do with his life\".<ref>Bondanella, 90</ref> In a 1971 letter, co-screenwriter Ennio Flaiano offered a fuller meaning of the word: \"The term ''vitellone'' was used in my day to define a young man from a modest family, perhaps a student \u2013 but one who had either already gone beyond the programmed schedule for his coursework, or one who did nothing all the time&nbsp;... I believe the term is a corruption of the word ''vudellone'', the large intestine, or a person who eats a lot. It was a way of describing the family son who only ate but never 'produced' \u2013 like an intestine, waiting to be filled.\"<ref>Kezich, 132. This explanation also was proposed by [[Tullio Pinelli]] in a 2001 research interview for the documentary, ''[[Fellini: I'm a Born Liar]]'' (2002). ''Cin\u00e9Libre'' (Paris), Issue July 2003.</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nFellini once again cast [[Alberto Sordi]] in a major role, despite the latter's reputation as box office poison, and against Pegoraro's express wishes. Intent on playing the lead, however, Sordi didn't accept Fellini's offer until later in production.<ref name=\"Kezich, 134\">Kezich, 134</ref> Pegoraro's skeptical distributors, far from closing the deal, demanded a clause in the contract banning Sordi's name from theatrical posters.<ref name=\"Kezich, 133\">Kezich, 133</ref> To make matters worse, Fellini also cast [[Leopoldo Trieste]] (the lead in ''[[The White Sheik]]'' fiasco) as the budding dramatist, and his brother Riccardo, a total unknown, to interpret his own role. Further unknowns included [[Franco Interlenghi]] and [[Leonora Ruffo]] who had just wrapped on ''The Queen of Sheba''. Although Czech actress [[L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1]] had a cult following, she was more famous for her love affair with [[Nazi]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] than for any of her film roles.<ref name=\"Kezich, 134\"/> Fellini topped things off by casting [[Franco Fabrizi]] as Fausto, an actor who had begun his film career in 1950 with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Chronicle of a Love]]'' but had recently bombed in ''Christ Passed by the Barn''.<ref name=\"Kezich, 134\"/> Pressured by his financial backers \u2013 a Florentine business group and the [[Paris]]-based Cit\u00e9 Film,<ref name=\"Kezich, 134\"/> Pegoraro finally balked at the lack of a star. \"Sordi makes people run away,\" he complained to Fellini. \"Leopoldo Trieste is a nobody. Meet me half way \u2013 bring in a name.\"<ref>Alpert, 82</ref>\n\nTo placate him, Fellini contacted [[Vittorio De Sica]], hoping to convince him to play the part of Sergio Natali, the aging ham actor. When Fellini outlined the homosexual overtones of the role, De Sica accepted provided it was written with \"a great deal of humanity\".<ref name=\"Alpert, 83\">Alpert, 83</ref> In the end, he rejected the offer, \"concerned about being marked as actually gay\".<ref name=\"Kezich, 135\">Kezich, 135</ref> Fellini then decided that De Sica would have been \"too nice, too fascinating, too distracting\"<ref name=\"Alpert, 83\"/> and cast [[Achille Majeroni]], a respected stage actor, in the part.\n\n===Filming and editing===\nDescribed as an \"itinerant production\",<ref name=\"Kezich, 135\"/> shooting was tailored to accommodate Sordi's variety show schedule, requiring Fellini and his troupe to follow him from town to town across Italy. On tour in the ''Big Ruckus'', Sordi rehearsed his role and was ready for filming during his hours off. Accordingly, when the actor toured [[Florence]], shooting began as an all-night party at the city's Teatro Goldoni in early December 1952.<ref>Alpert, 84</ref> Supervised by production manager Luigi Giacosi whom Fellini had first met while on location in [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] during the war, and photographed by veteran [[cinematographer]] [[Otello Martelli]], the rushes served as the basis of the masquerade ball, a major sequence. With a break in production for Christmas, shooting resumed on January 15, 1953.<ref name=\"Kezich, 135\"/> Constrained by the shoestring budget, many scenes were shot in a natural decor. In [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], a quay provided the winter setting for Fausto and his gang to wander around listlessly staring at the sea. In [[Fiumicino]], the terrace of the Kursaal Hotel was the backdrop for the beauty pageant that opens the film. Accustomed to movies produced on promises, Giacosi maintained morale by ensuring that cast and crew dined in the best restaurants in the towns they visited.<ref name=\"Kezich, 133\"/>\n\nWorking with several cinematographers over a six-month period, Fellini developed a predominant camera style based on slow tracking shots that \"match the listless, purposeless lives\" of his characters.<ref name=\"Bondanella, 96\">Bondanella, 96</ref> The camera often dollies in to underscored dramatic events, most notably when Sandra falls ill at the beauty pageant, after the birth of her child, and when Francesco beats his wayward son.\n\nWith editor Rolando Benedetti, Fellini established a rhythm in which short sequences were separated by abrupt cuts while longer sequences used dissolves. The numerous brief and disparate episodes \"governed by their own internal logic\" were thus held together by a particular editing pattern.<ref name=\"Bondanella, 96\"/> A freeze-frame was used to immobilize the young Guido, Moraldo's friend, at the end of the film when he balances himself on a railtrack.\n\n==Critical response==\n'''Italy and France'''\n\nScreened in competition at the [[14th Venice International Film Festival]] on 26 August 1953, the film was awarded the Silver Lion by Italian poet [[Eugenio Montale]] who headed the jury,<ref name=\"Kezich, 135\"/> along with a public ovation and acclaim from the majority of critics.<ref name=\"Alpert, 85\">Alpert, 85</ref> \"Belying all doubts about its appeal\",<ref name=\"Alpert, 85\"/> the film opened on September 17, 1953, to both commercial and critical success.\n\nReviewing for ''[[La Stampa]]'', Mario Gromo argued that it was a \"film of a certain importance because of its many intelligent moments, its sound portrayal of provincial life, and because it is the second film of a young director who evidently has considerable talent&nbsp;... The Italian film industry now has a new director and one who puts his own personal ideas before any of the customary traditions of the trade. Fellini's is a fresh approach\".<ref>First published 9 October 1953 in ''La Stampa'' (Turin). Fava and Vigano, 73</ref> \"It is the atmosphere that counts most in this unusual film,\" wrote Francesco C\u00e0llari of the ''Gazzetta del Luned\u00ec'', \"an intensely human and poetical atmosphere altogether estranged from the provincialism of the setting&nbsp;... Fellini has something to say and he says it with an acute sense of observation&nbsp;... Here is someone apart from the other young directors of post-war Italian cinema. Fellini has a magical touch.\" First published 31 August 1953 in the ''Gazzeta del Lunedi'' (Genoa). After praising Fellini's Venice triumph, Ermanno Contini of ''Il Secolo XIX'' outlined the film's weaknesses: \"''I Vitelloni'' does not have a particularly solid structure, the story is discontinuous, seeking unity through the complex symbiosis of episodes and details&nbsp;... The narrative, built up around strong emotions and powerful situations, lacks solid organic unity, and at times this undermines the story's creative force, resulting in an imbalance of tone and pace and a certain sense of tedium. But such shortcomings are amply atoned for by the film's sincerity and authenticity.\"<ref>First published 28 August 1953 in ''Il Secolo XIX'' (Genoa). Fava and Vigano, 75</ref> Arturo Lanocita of ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' wrote: \"''I Vitelloni'' gives a graphic and authentic picture of certain aimless evenings, the streets populated by groups of idle youths&nbsp;... The film is a series of annotations, hints, and allusions without unity&nbsp;... With a touch of irony, Fellini tries to show the contrast between the way his characters see themselves and the way they really are. Despite its weaknesses, the film is one of the best in recent years.\"<ref>First published 28 August 1953 in ''Corriere della Sera'' (Milan). Fava and Vigano, 75</ref> For Giulio Cesare Castello of ''Cinema VI'', the film proved \"that Fellini is the Italian film industry's most talented satirist, and an acute observer and psychologist of human behaviour. Like any good moralist, he knows how to give his story a meaning, to provide more than just simple entertainment\".<ref>First published 31 August 1953 in ''Cinema VI'' (Milan). Fava and Vigano, 75</ref>\n\nFellini's first film with international distribution,<ref name=\"Kezich, 137\">Kezich, 137</ref> ''I Vitelloni'' did reasonable box office in Britain and North America while performing \"huge in Argentina\".<ref name=\"Kezich, 137\"/> Opening in France on 23 April 1954, it was especially well received. Andr\u00e9 Martin of ''[[Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'' insisted that by \"virtue of the quality of the narrative, and the balance and control of the film as a whole, ''I Vitelloni'' is neither commercial nor does it possess those traits that usually permit a work of art to be consecrated and defined. With a surprising and effective sense of cinema, Fellini endows his characters with a life both simple and real\".<ref>First published May 1954 in ''Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma''. Fava and Vigano, 76</ref> Film critic Genevi\u00e8ve Agel appreciated the maestro's symbolism: \"Fellini films a deserted piazza at nighttime. It symbolizes solitude, the emptiness that follows communal joy, the bleak torpor that succeeds the swarming crowd; there are always papers lying around like so many reminders of what the day and life have left behind.\"<ref>Alpert, 86</ref> The film ranked 6th on [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'s [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's Annual Top 10 Lists|Top 10 Films of the Year List]] in 1954.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|title=Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951-2009|last=Johnson|first=Eric C.|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|archive-date=2012-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n'''United States'''\n\n''I Vitelloni'' opened in the United States on 7 November 1956 to generally positive reviews. In his ''[[New York Times]]'' review, [[Bosley Crowther]] reported that Fellini, with \"his volatile disposition and a desire to make a stinging film&nbsp;... does certainly take a vigorous whiplash to the breed of over-grown and over-sexed young men who hang around their local poolrooms and shun work as though it were a foul disease. He ridicules them with all the candor of his sharp neo-realist style, revealing their self-admiration to be sadly immature and absurd. And without going into reasons for the slack state of these young men, he indicates that they are piteous and merit some sympathy too\".<ref>First published 24 October 1956 in ''The New York Times''. Fava and Vigano, 76</ref> For [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]], Nino Rota's music was one \"of the most brilliant features of the film&nbsp;... The first [of its two main themes] is a soaring, romantic melody that can be made to express nostalgia, love, and the pathos of existence&nbsp;... Slowed down, [the second main theme] becomes lugubrious; with eerie figurations in the woodwinds it turns sinister. The quicksilver changes in the music support the changing moods of the story\".<ref>Alpert, 87</ref>\n\nThe film was re-released internationally on the tenth anniversary of Fellini's death in 2003. For the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Mick LaSalle noted that ''I Vitelloni'' was \"a film of sensitivity, observation and humor \u2013 a must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else. Those less taken by the maestro may find ''I Vitelloni'' to be a favorite among his works\".<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/12/12/DDGQ63KS1U1.DTL LaSalle, Mick.] ''San Francisco Chronicle'', film review, 2003.</ref> Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote: \"In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. It should be in America as well&nbsp;... If you still remember that terrific drunk scene, Alberto Sordi's pre-''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' drag tango or the way the little boy balances on the train track at the end, you should know that this picture plays as strongly now as it did in 1956 or whenever you first saw it. I know I had a ball watching ''I Vitelloni'' again.
