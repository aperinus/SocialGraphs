Also served as the setting and title of the famous film.]]\nDora is a retired schoolteacher who works at [[Central do Brasil|Rio de Janeiro's Central Station]] writing letters for illiterate customers for living. Embittered by life, she usually shows a lack of patience with customers and sometimes does not mail the letters that she writes, putting them in a drawer or even tearing them up instead. One of her customers is the mother of Josu\u00e9, a poor 9-year-old boy who hopes to meet his unknown father someday. When she is killed in a bus accident just outside the train station and Josu\u00e9 is left homeless, Dora is forced to take him in; she initially traffics him to a corrupt couple, but later steals him back out of guilt.\n\nDora is initially reluctant to be responsible for the boy, but eventually decides to take a trip with him to [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]] in order to find his father.\n\nDora tries to leave Josu\u00e9 on the bus, but he follows her, forgetting his backpack containing Dora's money. Penniless, they are picked up by a kind, evangelical truck driver who abandons them when Dora encourages him to drink beer and then grows too friendly. Dora trades her watch for a ride to \"Bom Jesus do Norte\" (a fictionalized version of Cruzeiro do Nordeste,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oreversodomundo.com/2016/07/26/central-brasil/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914065357/https://oreversodomundo.com/2016/07/26/central-brasil/ |archive-date=2016-09-14  |title=Central do Brasil}}; {{cite web|url=http://romanitas.uprrp.edu/vol_5_num_1/mitchell.html|title=Pater / Patria: Central Station and the Search for Identity in Post-Collor Brazil}}</ref> a district of [[Sert\u00e2nia]], [[Pernambuco]]). They find his father's address in Bom Jesus, but the current residents say he won a house in the lottery and now lives in the new settlements. With no money, Josu\u00e9 saves them from destitution by suggesting Dora write letters for the pilgrims who have arrived in Bom Jesus for a massive pilgrimage.\n\nThey take the bus to the settlements, but when they locate the address they have for Josu\u00e9's father, they are told by the new residents that he no longer lives there and has disappeared. Josu\u00e9 tells Dora that he will wait for him, but Dora invites him to live with her. She calls Irene in Rio and asks her to sell her refrigerator, sofa and television. She says that she will call when she gets settled somewhere. After she hangs up, she learns there are no buses leaving until the next morning.\n\nIsa\u00edas, one of Josu\u00e9's half-brothers, is working on a roof next to the bus stop and learns that they are looking for his father, insisting Dora and Josu\u00e9 come to dinner. They return to his house and meet Mois\u00e9s, Josu\u00e9's other half-brother. Later, Isa\u00edas explains to Dora that their father married Ana, who he doesn't know is Josu\u00e9's mother, after their mother died, and that nine years ago, while pregnant, Ana left him to live in Rio and never returned. Isa\u00edas asks Dora to read a letter that his father wrote to Ana when he disappeared, six months ago, in case she returned. In the letter, the boys' father explains that he has gone to Rio to find Ana and the son he never met. He promises to return, asks her to wait for him, and says they can all be together\u2014himself, Ana, Isa\u00edas and Mois\u00e9s. Dora pauses, looks at Josu\u00e9 and says, \"and Josu\u00e9, whom I can't wait to meet.\" Isa\u00edas and Josu\u00e9 are sure their father will return, but Mois\u00e9s does not believe it.\n\nThe next morning, while they sleep, Dora sneaks out to catch the bus to Rio. She first leaves behind the letter from Jesus and the one from Ana - the one Dora carried with her from the Central Station but never mailed, expressing Ana's wish for the family to be reunited. Josu\u00e9 wakes up too late to prevent her departure. Dora writes a letter to Josu\u00e9 on the bus. Both are left with the photos they had taken to remember one another.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fernanda Montenegro]] as Isadora \"Dora\" Teixeira\n* [[Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira]] as Josu\u00e9 Fontenele de Paiva\n* [[Mar\u00edlia P\u00eara]] as Irene\n* Soia Lira as Ana Fontenele\n* [[Othon Bastos]] as C\u00e9sar\n* [[Ot\u00e1vio Augusto]] as Pedr\u00e3o\n* Stela Freitas as Yolanda\n* [[Matheus Nachtergaele]] as Isa\u00edas Paiva\n* Caio Junqueira as Mois\u00e9s Paiva\n\n== Production ==\nBeing a co-production between Brazil and France, the film was chosen by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]] to receive resources of Fonds Sud Cinema, for their funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinemateca.gov.br/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/iah/?IsisScript=iah/iah.xis&base=FILMOGRAFIA&lang=P&nextAction=search&exprSearch=ID=021464&format=detailed.pft|title=Cinemateca Nacional: Central do Brasil (1998)|publisher=Cinemateca Brasileira|access-date=27 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209155627/http://cinemateca.gov.br/cgi-bin/wxis.exe/iah/?IsisScript=iah%2Fiah.xis&base=FILMOGRAFIA&lang=P&nextAction=search&exprSearch=ID%3D021464&format=detailed.pft|archive-date=9 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Central Station'' had its world premiere at a regional film festival in Switzerland on 16 January 1998.
