Redford plays the title role, a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses, who is hired to help an injured teenager (played by [[Scarlett Johansson]]) and her horse back to health following a tragic accident.\n\nThe film was released on May 15, 1998. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed close to $187 million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Lake Luzerne, New York|Lake Luzerne]], [[New York State|New York]], teenager Grace MacLean and her best friend Judith go out early one winter's morning to ride their horses, Pilgrim and Gulliver. As they ride up an icy slope, Gulliver slips and hits Pilgrim. Both horses fall, dragging the girls onto a road and get hit by a tractor-trailer. Judith and Gulliver are killed, while Grace and Pilgrim are both severely injured.\n\nGrace, left with a partially amputated right leg, is bitter and withdrawn after the accident. Meanwhile, Pilgrim is traumatized and uncontrollable to the extent that it is suggested he be [[Animal euthanasia|put down]]. Grace's mother Annie, a strong-minded and workaholic magazine editor, refuses to allow it; sensing that somehow Grace's recovery is linked with Pilgrim's.\n\nDesperate for a way to heal both Grace and Pilgrim, Annie tracks down a \"[[horse whisperer]]\", Tom Booker, in the remote [[Montana]] mountains. Tom agrees to help, but only if Grace also takes part in the process. Grace reluctantly agrees, and she and Annie go to stay at the Booker ranch where Tom lives with his brother and his brother's family.\n\nAs Pilgrim and Grace slowly overcome their trauma, Annie and Tom begin to develop a mutual attraction. However, they are both reluctant to act on these feelings&nbsp;\u2013 Annie is married and Tom had his heart broken before (his wife left him because she belonged in the city). Tom also asks Grace to tell him what happened with her and Pilgrim to understand what Pilgrim is feeling. At first, Grace is reluctant, but eventually gathers up her courage, and tearfully describes the accident.\n\nThe status quo between Annie and Tom is broken when Robert MacLean, Grace's father and Annie's husband, unexpectedly shows up at the ranch. Annie is increasingly torn by her feelings for Tom and her love for her family. Soon, with Tom's help, Grace finally takes the last step to heal herself and Pilgrim&nbsp;\u2013 riding Pilgrim again. As the MacLeans get ready to leave the ranch, Robert tells Annie that he knows he loved her more than she loved him, and that if he could be a better father, husband, or lawyer then it didn't matter, he did it all for the love he had for her. He felt that he didn't need more, he knows she is not sure how she feels about him, and now he wants her to make a choice, and not to come home until she is sure.\n\nAlthough Annie wishes she could stay with Tom on the ranch, she also knows that she belongs to the city, just like Tom's wife. Annie departs, driving away from the ranch, while Tom watches her go from the top of a hill.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Tom Booker\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Annie MacLean\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Grace MacLean\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Robert MacLean\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Dianne Booker\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Frank Booker\n* [[Cherry Jones]] as Liz Hammond\n* Ty Hillman as Joe Booker\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as Judith\n* [[Jessalyn Gilsig]] as Lucy, Annie's assistant\n* [[Jeanette Nolan]] as Mrs. Ellen Booker\n* [[Allison Moorer]] as Barn Dance Vocalist\n* [[Stephen Pearlman]] as David Gottschalk\n* [[Joelle Carter]] as Office Worker #1\n* [[Gloria Lynne Henry]] as Member of Magazine Staff\n<!-- * Austin and Dustin Schwarz as Twins\n* Steve Frye as Hank\n* Don Edwards as Smokey\n* William 'Buddy' Byrd as Lester Petersen\n* John Hogarty as Local Tracker\n* Mike La Londe as Park Ranger\n* C.J.

Redford likewise assisted in the production of the documentary ''[[Buck (film)|Buck]].'' Evans said, \"Others have claimed to be the inspiration for Tom Booker in ''The Horse Whisperer''. The one who truly inspired me was Buck Brannaman. His skill, understanding and his gentle, loving heart have parted the clouds for countless troubled creatures. Buck is the [[Zen]] master of the horse world.\"<ref name=\"review\"/>\n\n==Horse training methods and controversies==\nThe schooling administered to the traumatized horse is faithful to a number of basic [[natural horsemanship]] techniques, although the portrayal in the film does not follow the specific method of any one practitioner. Nicholas Evans writes: \"I spent many weeks traveling across the West and met three amazing horsemen: [[Tom Dorrance]], [[Ray Hunt (horse trainer)|Ray Hunt]] and [[Buck Brannaman]].\"<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n\nThe [[horse training]] methods shown are not entirely without controversy. While Brannaman was the on-site technical consultant, he did not have creative control. The constraints of film-making required a number of sequences to be edited for length, thus not showing some critical training elements that would normally be used. A few basic safety problems in the film include Redford kneeling in front of a horse known to charge humans in one scene, and wearing a large ring on his finger while training in another, a risky practice in the real world when simultaneously handling a dangerous horse and a rope.\n\nA fundamental literary device used that goes against basic [[horse behavior|horse psychology]] was that of having Pilgrim, apparently a well-trained horse, suddenly became a vicious rogue following a single traumatic event. A horse may have a strong reaction after an accident if the elements that preceded the trauma are repeated at a future time (for example, it would be reasonable for Pilgrim to have developed a fear of vehicles, of crossing a road, or of climbing a steep slope),<ref name=\"Synowski\"/> but not generally a complete change in personality, manner and outlook in the way that can occur in traumatized humans. Such behavioral changes in a horse would normally be the result of sustained, long-term [[animal abuse]].\n\nA practitioner of natural horsemanship, [[John Lyons (horse trainer)|John Lyons]], provided an [[equestrianism|equestrian's]] critique of the film, noting that while there were many positive messages, there was also the potential for people to get some dangerous messages about horse training from certain sequences. He first noted that the multiple horses that played Pilgrim were all well-trained animals and that the movie did not represent a real-life time frame for training a single real-life animal. He pointed out that the film made the rehabilitation of the horse appear to be a one-session event, when in reality it would take considerable time for such a change to occur. Lyons criticized a number of dangerous practices shown in the movie, and was particularly critical of the scene where Booker hobbles, ropes, and lays the exhausted horse on the ground, then has Grace get on the recumbent horse, which is then allowed to rise, and the horse and girl miraculously are both cured of their fears and once again a horse and rider team. He argued that the actual real-life practical risk of injury to horse and human in such a method is considerable, that a horse pushed to exhaustion is not \"trained\", and pushing a fearful rider in such a fashion is ill-advised. However, Lyons' critique also recognized the limitations of Hollywood film-making, stating, \"In order to tell a story, things are often done that would be imprudent for horse owners to attempt.\"<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.beulahland.com/abouthw/index.htm |date=* |title=Mixed Messages from the Movie, The Horse Whisperer }}&nbsp;\u2013 [[John Lyons (horse trainer)|John Lyons]] critiques the horse training methods it depicts.</ref><!-- Ref covers entire paragraph -->\n\n==Reception==\n=== Box office ===\n''The Horse Whisperer'' grossed $74.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $111.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $186.9 million.\n\nIn its opening weekend the film made $13.7 million and finished in second, then made $14.5 million and $7.5 million the following two weekends.<ref name=budget/><ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 74% based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 6.96/10.
