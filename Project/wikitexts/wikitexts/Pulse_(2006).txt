It is a remake of [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]]'s 2001 Japanese horror film ''[[Pulse (2001 film)|Kairo]]''. The film stars [[Kristen Bell]], [[Ian Somerhalder]] and [[Christina Milian]]. The film spawned two [[straight-to-DVD]] sequels: ''[[Pulse 2: Afterlife]]'' and ''[[Pulse 3]]'', both released in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Josh Ockmann ([[Jonathan Tucker]]) enters a dark university library intending to meet his friend Douglas Ziegler (Kel O'Neill), he is attacked by a humanoid spirit that sucks the life force out of him. Some days later, Josh's girlfriend, Mattie Webber ([[Kristen Bell]]), visits his apartment, seeing evidence that it has not been well kept. Josh tells Mattie to wait in the kitchen while he walks off. While waiting she finds Josh's pet cat, locked in a closet and dying from severe [[malnutrition]]. But when she rushes to tell him, she finds that he has committed suicide by hanging himself with an [[Ethernet physical layer|Internet cable]].\n\nMattie and her friends begin to receive online messages from Josh asking for help, but assume that Josh's computer is still on and that a [[Computer virus|virus]] is creating the messages. Mattie learns that Josh's computer has been sold to Dex McCarthy ([[Ian Somerhalder]]), who finds a number of strange videos on the computer. Mattie receives a package that Josh mailed two days prior to his death. Inside are rolls of red tape and a message telling her that the tape keeps \"them\" out, although he does not know why. Later, Dex visits Mattie and shows her video messages that Josh was sending to Ziegler. Josh had hacked Ziegler's computer system and then distributed a virus. This virus had unlocked a portal that connected the realm of the living to the realm of the dead. Josh believed that he had coded a counter to the virus and wanted to meet Ziegler at the library. Josh's counter-program is found on a [[USB flash drive|memory stick]] taped inside the PC case with red tape.\n\nDex and Mattie visit Ziegler and find his room entirely plastered in red tape. They believe that the red tape keeps the spirits out. Ziegler tells them of a project he worked on where he found \"frequencies no one knew existed.\" Opening these frequencies somehow allowed the spirits to travel to the world of the living. Ziegler also tells them that these spirits \"take away your will to live\" and where to find the main server infected with the virus.\n\nDex and Mattie find the server and upload Josh's fix, causing the system to crash and the spirits to vanish. Moments later, however, the system reboots and the spirits return, leaving Mattie and Dex with no option but to flee the city by car. Over the car radio, Mattie and Dex hear a report from the Army announcing the location of several \"safe zones\" where there are no Internet connections, cell phones, or televisions. As Dex and Mattie are driving to a safe zone, a [[voice-over]] from Mattie is heard saying \"We can never go back. The cities are theirs. Our lives are different now. What was meant to connect us to one another instead connected us to forces that we could have never imagined. The world we knew is gone, but the will to live never dies. Not for us, and not for them.\" The film closes by showing various clips of abandoned cities, which includes a window of an apartment with Josh looking through it.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Mattie\n* [[Ian Somerhalder]] as Dexter\n* [[Christina Milian]] as Isabelle Fuentes\n* [[Rick Gonzalez]] as Stone\n* [[Jonathan Tucker]] as Josh\n* [[Samm Levine]] as Tim\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Landlady\n* [[Ron Rifkin]] as Dr. Waterson\n* [[Joseph Gatt]] as Dark Figure\n* [[Kel O'Neill]] as Douglas Ziegler\n* [[Zach Grenier]] as Professor Cardiff\n* [[Riki Lindhome]] as Janelle\n* [[Robert Clotworthy]] as Calvin\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Thin Bookish Guy\n* [[Christine Barger]] as Goth Girl\n\n==Production==\nIn 2003, Wes Craven signed to write and direct the film. However, the project was pulled from the schedule by producer Bob Weinstein before shooting. Subsequently, Craven's screenplay was rewritten by Ray Wright for the film that was ultimately made by director Jim Sonzero. Talking to ''[[Fangoria]]'' at the time of the film's release, Craven said he was not involved in the making of the film, stating \"I have had no influence at all on the film they are about to release.\"<ref>\"Losing the Pulse\" by Calum Waddell, ''Fangoria Magazine'' No. 255, August 2006 https://issuu.com/comicscrazy/docs/fangoria_255/30</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film's planned release date was March 3, 2006, but was delayed until August 11, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Upon release, ''Pulse'' was negatively received by critics, with a 11% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 74 reviews, and an average rating of 3.63/10, with the consensus, \"Another stale American remake of a successful Japanese horror film, ''Pulse'' bypasses the emotional substance of the original, and overcompensates with pumped-up visuals and every known horror cliche.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|pulse|Pulse}}</ref>\n\nThe film grossed over $8 million in its opening weekend in the [[United States]]. By its close on October 12, 2006, the film had grossed just over $20 million in the U.S., along with the foreign-box-office total, just over $7.5 million, for a worldwide take of almost $28 million, compared with a production budget of approximately $20.5 million.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pulse.htm | title = PULSE| access-date = 2009-07-04| publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> As a DVD rental, the film has grossed a further $25 million.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&id=pulse.htm| title = PULSE| access-date = 2009-07-04| publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nThe film is followed by two sequels: ''[[Pulse 2: Afterlife]]'', and ''[[Pulse 3]]''.  Both were released in 2008, and were written and directed by [[Joel Soisson]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ghost films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0454919|Pulse}}\n* {{AllRovi movie|324106|Pulse}}\n* {{Mojo title|pulse|Pulse}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|pulse|Pulse}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Pulse}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pulse}}\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:2006 horror films]]\n[[Category:2006 psychological thriller films]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:American dystopian films]]\n[[Category:American ghost films]]\n[[Category:Horror film remakes]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American remakes of Japanese films]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Dimension Films films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Elia Cm\u00edral]]\n[[Category:2006 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Joel Soisson]]\n[[Category:Techno-horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
