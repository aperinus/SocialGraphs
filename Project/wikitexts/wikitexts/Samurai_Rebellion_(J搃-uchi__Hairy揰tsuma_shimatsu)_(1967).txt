Isaburo is one of the most skilled swordsmen in the land, whose principal rival is his good friend Tatewaki Asano ([[Tatsuya Nakadai]]). Isaburo is in a loveless marriage with a shrew of a woman. One day, one of the daimyo's advisors orders Isaburo's elder son Yogoro ([[Go Kato]]) to marry the daimyo's ex-[[concubine]], Ichi ([[Yoko Tsukasa]]), even though she is the mother to one of the daimyo's sons. With much trepidation, the family agrees. In time, Ichi and Yogoro find love and happiness in the marriage and a daughter, Tomi, is born.\n\nHowever, the daimyo's primary heir dies, and he orders his ex-concubine to rejoin his household to care for their son and heir. The family refuses, but Ichi is tricked into the castle by Isaburo's younger son, otherwise her husband and father-in-law will be ordered to commit [[seppuku]] for their insolence and insubordination. Isaburo counters that he will comply only if the heads of the daimyo and his two primary advisors are brought to him first. Isaburo sends his younger son and wife away and dismisses his household servants.With his elder son, he prepares for battle, removing the [[tatami]] from his house to prevent slipping in the blood that will be spilled and removing the house's walls to allow for more space for combat.\n\nThe daimyo's steward, accompanied by a platoon of 20 [[samurai]], brings Ichi to the Sasahara house and tries to force her at spear point to renounce her marriage to Yogoro and join the daimyo's household. The daimyo also \"graciously\" offers to commute Isaburo and Yogoro's sentences to life confinement in a shrine outside his castle.Not only does Ichi refuse to join his household, she throws herself onto a spear instead of abandoning her husband. Her husband goes to her side and is killed with her in his arms.His father, enraged, kills the steward's entire party, killing the steward last as he attempts to flee.\n\nBurying the dead couple, Isaburo now decides to take his case to the [[shogun]] in [[Edo]] regardless of the consequences to his clan, accompanied by Tomi. Tatewaki, who is guarding the gate, cannot permit Isaburo to pass, and a climactic duel follows with his good friend. Isaburo is the victor, but assassins hidden nearby cut Isaburo down with [[Tanegashima (gun)|musket]] fire. As Isaburo dies, we see Tomi's wet-nurse comforting the baby: she has been secretly following him.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Toshiro Mifune]] as Isaburo Sasahara \n*[[Yoko Tsukasa]] as Ichi Sasahara \n*[[Go Kato]] as Yogoro Sasahara \n*[[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Tatewaki Asano \n*[[Shigeru Koyama]] as Geki Takahashi \n*[[Masao Mishima]] as Sanzaemon Yanase \n*[[Isao Yamagata]] as Shobei Tsuchiya \n*[[Tatsuyoshi Ehara]] as Bunzo Sasahara\n*[[Etsuko Ichihara]] as Kiku\n*[[Tatsuo Matsumura (actor)|Tatsuo Matsumura]] as Masakata Matsudaira \n*[[Takamaru Sasaki]] as Kenmotsu Sasahara\n*[[Jun Hamamura]] as Hyoemon Shiomi\n\n==Music==\nThe music, by [[T\u014dru Takemitsu]], is performed almost exclusively on [[Traditional Japanese musical instruments|traditional Japanese instruments]], including ''[[shakuhachi]]'', ''[[biwa]]'', and ''[[taiko]]''.\n\n==Release==\n''Samurai Rebellion'' received a [[roadshow release]] in Japan on 27 May 1967 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=239}} The film received a wide theatrical release in Japan on 3 June 1967{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=239}} and was released by Toho International in December 1967, with English-subtitles and a 120-minute running time.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=239}} It has been released to home video under the title of ''Samurai Rebellion''.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=239}}\n\n==Awards==\n''Samurai Rebellion'' received awards in Japan, including ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' awarding it Best Film,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotobank.jp/word/%E4%B8%8A%E6%84%8F%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%A1%20%E6%8B%9D%E9%A0%98%E5%A6%BB%E5%A7%8B%E6%9C%AB-716032|title=\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u300c\u4e0a\u610f\u8a0e\u3061 \u62dd\u9818\u59bb\u59cb\u672b\u300d\u306e\u89e3\u8aac|work=KOTOBANK|accessdate=July 21, 2021}}</ref> Best Director (Kobayashi), Best Screenplay ([[Shinobu Hashimoto]] (also for [[Kihachi Okamoto]]'s ''[[Japan's Longest Day]]'')).{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=239}} ''[[Mainichi Film Concours]]'' awarded it as Best Film of the year.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=239}} Along with ''[[China is Near]]'', it won the [[FIPRESCI Prize]]at the [[Venice Film Festival]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=239}}\n\n==Other adaptations==\nA TV movie remake starring [[Masakazu Tamura]] as Isaburo Sasahara and [[Yukie Nakama]] as Ichi Sasahara aired on [[TV Asahi]] in 2013.
