It is the first installment in [[The Hangover (film series)|''The Hangover'' trilogy]]. The film stars [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ed Helms]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Heather Graham]], [[Justin Bartha]], [[Ken Jeong]], and [[Jeffrey Tambor]]. It tells the story of Phil Wenneck (Cooper), Stu Price (Helms), Alan Garner (Galifianakis), and Doug Billings (Bartha), who travel to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for a [[bachelor party]] to celebrate Doug's impending marriage. However, Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up with Doug missing and [[Blackout (drug-related amnesia)|no memory]] of the previous night's events, and must find the groom before the wedding can take place.\n\nLucas and Moore wrote the script after executive producer Chris Bender's friend disappeared and had a large bill after being sent to a strip club. After Lucas and Moore sold it to the studio for $2{{nbsp}}million, Phillips and [[Jeremy Garelick]] rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a [[subplot]] involving a baby and a police cruiser, and also including boxer [[Mike Tyson]]. [[Principal photography|Filming]] took place in Nevada for 15 days, and during filming, the three main actors (Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis) formed a real friendship.\n\n''The Hangover'' was released on June 5, 2009,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://g.co/kgs/uk3hqJ|title = The Hangover - Google Search}}</ref> and was a critical and commercial success. The film became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009, with a worldwide gross of over $467{{nbsp}}million. The film won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy#2000s|Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], and received multiple other accolades. It became the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever in the United States, surpassing a record previously held by ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' for almost 25 years.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/mpaa.htm?page=R&p=.htm\n| title=Top Grossing R Rated Movies at the Box Office\n| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]\n| access-date=2013-08-08\n}}</ref>\n\nA [[sequel]], ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'', was released on May 26, 2011, and a third and final installment, ''[[The Hangover Part III]]'', was released on May 23, 2013. While both were also box-office hits, neither were well-received.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nTwo days before his wedding, Doug Billings, a cheerful yet careful [[bachelor party|bachelor]], travels to [[Las Vegas]] with his best friends Phil Wenneck, a sarcastic elementary school teacher, Stu Price, an apprehensive dentist, and Alan Garner, his odd future brother-in-law. Sid, the father of Doug's fianc\u00e9e Tracy, allows Doug to drive his vintage [[Mercedes-Benz W111]] to Las Vegas. They get a suite at [[Caesars Palace]] and celebrate by sneaking onto the hotel rooftop and taking shots of [[J\u00e4germeister]]. The next day, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken to find they have no memory of the previous night. Doug is nowhere to be found, Stu's tooth is missing, the suite is a mess, a [[Bengal tiger]] is in the bathroom, and a baby is in the closet. They see Doug's mattress impaled on a statue outside, and when they ask for their Mercedes the valet delivers a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department cruiser.\n\nRetracing their steps, the trio travel to a hospital, discovering they were drugged with [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]], causing their memory loss, and that they went to the hospital from a chapel the previous night. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a [[call girl]] named Jade, despite being in a relationship with his domineering and philandering girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by gangsters demanding to know where \"he\" is. Bewildered, they flee and track down Jade, the baby's mother.\n\nThey are arrested by the police for having stolen the cruiser. After being told that the Mercedes was impounded, the trio are released when they unwittingly volunteer to be targets for a [[taser]] demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk, who beats the trio with a crowbar and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, believing the drug to be [[MDMA|Ecstasy]].\n\nReturning to their suite, they find [[Mike Tyson]], who knocks Alan unconscious and orders them to return his tiger to his mansion. Stu drugs it, they load it into the Mercedes, and drive to Tyson's mansion. However, the tiger awakens and attacks them, scratching Phil on the neck and damaging the car's interior. They push the car the rest of the way to the mansion and deliver the tiger to Tyson, who shows them security camera footage indicating they did not lose Doug until they got back to the hotel. While driving back, their car is rammed by a black [[Cadillac Escalade]] manned by the gangsters from the chapel and Chow, their boss. Chow accuses them of kidnapping him and stealing $80,000 in [[poker chip]]s. As they deny it, he tells them he has Doug, and threatens to kill him if the chips are not returned. Unable to find Chow's chips, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of [[card counting]] to win $82,400 playing [[blackjack]].\n\nThey meet Chow in the [[Mojave Desert]] to exchange the chips for Doug, only to find that the Doug in question is actually the drug dealer who accidentally sold the roofies to Alan. With the real Doug's wedding set to occur in five hours, Phil calls Tracy to tell her they cannot find him. Simultaneously, the other Doug's remarks that someone who takes roofies is more likely to end up on the floor than on the roof cause Stu to realize where Doug is.\n\nThey travel back to Caesars Palace where they find a dazed and sunburned Doug on the roof. They moved him there on his mattress as a practical joke, but forgot when the roofies wore off; Doug threw the mattress onto the statue in an attempt to signal for help. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to meet Jade for a date the following week. With no flights available, the four drive home in the mangled Mercedes, where Doug reveals that he has Chow's original $80,000 in his pocket. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married. At the wedding, Stu gleefully breaks up with Melissa. Alan finds Stu's digital camera containing photos of the debauchery from the night in Las Vegas, and the four agree to look at the pictures before deleting them.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Phil, a teacher and the leader of the Wolfpack\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Stu, a dentist\n* [[Zach Galifianakis]] as Alan, Doug's socially inept, future brother-in-law, who has [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and acts childishly and erratically\n* [[Justin Bartha]] as Doug, the groom, who goes missing for most of the film\n* [[Heather Graham]] as Jade, a stripper and escort\n* [[Sasha Barrese]] as Tracy, Doug's bride and Alan's sister\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Sid, Tracy's and Alan's father\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Mr. Chow, a flamboyant [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese gangster]]\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Melissa, Stu's domineering, philandering and abusive girlfriend\n* [[Mike Tyson]] as Himself<br />Tyson originally refused to appear in the film, but he changed his mind when he found out that Todd Phillips directed ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'', which Tyson liked.<ref name=\"PopEater-Tyson\">{{cite news| date=January 18, 2010| first=Bryan | last=Alexander| title='The Hangover' Was a Game-Changer For Mike Tyson| url=http://www.popeater.com/2010/01/18/the-hangover-mike-tyson| work=The Huffington Post| access-date=2010-01-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609143033/http://www.popeater.com/2010/01/18/the-hangover-mike-tyson|archivedate=June 9, 2012}}</ref> Tyson later said that working on the film convinced him to change his lifestyle.<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite news| date=January 17, 2010| title=Overheard backstage at the Globes| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118013913/| last1=Cohen| first1=David S.| last2=Oldham | first2=Stuart| work=Variety| access-date=2011-11-23| quote=Tyson added that the pic \"started me on a good path to a healthy life.\"}}</ref>\n* [[Mike Epps]] as Black Doug, a drug dealer who is mistaken for Doug\n* Jernard Burks as Leonard\n* [[Rob Riggle]] as Officer Franklin\n* [[Cleo King]] as Officer Garden\n* [[Bryan Callen]] as Eddie, the wedding organizer\n* [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] as Dr. Valsh\n* [[Ian Anthony Dale]] as Chow's #1\n* Michael Li as Chow's #2\n* [[Sondra Currie]] as Linda, Tracy's and Alan's mother\n* [[Gillian Vigman]] as Stephanie, Phil's wife\n* [[Murray Gershenz]] as Felix (hospital elderly man)\n* Nathalie Fay as Lisa\n}}\n\n[[Todd Phillips]], the film's director, appears as Mr. Creepy, who appears briefly in an elevator.
