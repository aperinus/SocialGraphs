Gary Gray]], depicting the rise and fall of the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[N.W.A]] and its members [[Eazy-E]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[MC Ren]], and [[DJ Yella]]. Members of [[N.W.A]] were involved in the production of the film, including Ice Cube and Dr. Dre as [[film producer|producers]], as was Eazy-E's widow, Tomica Woods-Wright. MC Ren and DJ Yella served as creative consultants. Ice Cube is played by his real-life son, [[O'Shea Jackson Jr.]] who made his film debut. [[Corey Hawkins]] portrays Dr. Dre, [[Jason Mitchell]] is Eazy-E, [[Neil Brown Jr.]] is DJ Yella, and [[Aldis Hodge]] is MC Ren. [[Paul Giamatti]] stars as N.W.A's manager [[Jerry Heller]].\n\nTalks of an N.W.A biopic began in 2010 by [[New Line Cinema]]. Several directors were approached including [[Craig Brewer]], [[Peter Berg]], and [[John Singleton]] before Gray was eventually confirmed in April 2012. Much of the cast signed on in June 2014 and [[principal photography]] began that August, taking place around [[Los Angeles]] and [[Compton, California]]. The production faced several controversies, including casting call issues and several acts of violence on set. The film is dedicated to Eazy-E who died from [[HIV]] in 1995, twenty years before the release of the film.\n\nReleased on August 14, 2015, ''Straight Outta Compton'' received positive reviews from critics with praise for its performances (particularly Jackson's and Mitchell's), direction, screenplay and musical sequences, though many criticized the historical inaccuracies. The film was also a box office success, making over $201 million on a production budget of $28\u2013$50 million.\n\nIt was chosen by the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2015#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2015]] and nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. It inspired Dr. Dre's third studio album, ''[[Compton (album)|Compton]]'', which debuted at no. 2 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart a week prior to the film's release. The [[soundtrack album]], featuring music by N.W.A, debuted at no. 1 on the [[Rap Albums]] chart and reached no. 1 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. Heller filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers, protesting his depiction and claiming that parts were taken from his autobiography without permission.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. Please review the guidelines at WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. -->\nIn [[Compton, California]] in 1986, [[Eazy-E]] is a drug dealer, [[Dr. Dre]] is an aspiring [[disc jockey]], and [[Ice Cube]] is a young [[rapping|rapper]]. Intrigued by Cube's \"reality raps\" reflecting on the crime, gang violence, and police harassment that they and other [[African Americans]] encounter daily, Dre convinces Eazy to fund a startup [[record label]], [[Ruthless Records]], with Dre as [[record producer]]. When their song \"[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]]\" is rejected by a [[New York City|New York]] rap group, Dre convinces Eazy to perform it instead. It becomes a local hit, and Eazy, Cube, Dre, [[DJ Yella]], and [[MC Ren]] form the group [[N.W.A]] (\"Niggaz Wit Attitude\").\n\nEazy accepts [[Jerry Heller]]'s offer to manage N.W.A and co-run Ruthless, and [[Priority Records]] offers N.W.A a [[record deal]]. While recording their debut album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' (1988), the group is harassed by police due to their race and appearance, prompting Cube to compose a [[Fuck tha Police|diss track]] towards the police. The album becomes a controversial hit due to its profanity and violent lyrics, and the group's style is dubbed [[gangsta rap]] by the press. During a 1989 concert tour, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] demands N.W.A to not perform \"Fuck tha Police\" because it encourages violence against law enforcement. Police in [[Detroit]] forbid them from performing the song, but they perform it anyway. During a bridge, the police stop them and arrest the group, resulting in a riot.\n\nHeller delays the individual members' contracts with Ruthless, and when he insists that Cube should sign without legal representation, Cube quits the group. His debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' (1990), becomes a hit, but when Priority Records is unable to pay him his advance on his next album, he wrecks the label head's office.\n\nWhen N.W.A heavily insults Cube on their next record, ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'' (1990), he responds with the [[Diss (music)|diss track]] \"[[No Vaseline]],\" criticizing his former bandmates and Heller. This, combined with Cube's association with the [[Nation of Islam]], outspoken criticism of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] in the wake of the beating of [[Rodney King]], and a starring role in the 1991 film ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'', make him even more famous and controversial.\n\nDre hires the imposing [[Bloods|Blood]] gang member [[Suge Knight]] as his manager after Knight proves that Heller has been underpaying him. Dre leaves N.W.A to form [[Death Row Records]] with Knight, who has his men threaten Heller and beat Eazy-E to pressure them to release Dr. Dre from his contract with Ruthless. Dr. Dre enjoys his newfound freedom and begins working with other rappers, including then-newcomer [[Snoop Dogg]]. His debut solo album, ''[[The Chronic]]'' (1992), sells over five million copies and is critically acclaimed, even as he becomes disturbed by Knight's violent behavior and the community is rocked by the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].\n\nEazy, whose fortunes and health have declined, is devastated by the comparative success of his former bandmates. Learning that Heller has been embezzling money from Ruthless from the beginning, he fires him and decides to rekindle his friendships with Cube and Dre, who agree to an N.W.A reunion. During the reunion, Eazy has a seizure, collapses, and is admitted to the hospital, where he is diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS]]. Amid emotional visits from his bandmates, Eazy dies on March 26, 1995, and is mourned by fans.\n\nDre parts ways with Knight and Death Row a year later to form his own label, [[Aftermath Entertainment]]. Clips shown during the film's credits highlight Cube's subsequent roles as a film actor and Dre's career as a producer and entrepreneur. Several famous rappers credit Dre with helping to launch their careers, and [[Beats Electronics]], which he co-founded, was bought by [[Apple Inc.]] in 2014 for $3 billion.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[O'Shea Jackson Jr.]] as [[Ice Cube|O'Shea \"Ice Cube\" Jackson]]\n* [[Corey Hawkins]] as [[Dr. Dre|Andre \"Dr. Dre\" Young]]\n* [[Jason Mitchell]] as [[Eazy-E|Eric \"Eazy-E\" Wright]]\n* [[Neil Brown Jr.]] as [[DJ Yella|Antoine \"DJ Yella\" Carraby]]\n* [[Aldis Hodge]] as [[MC Ren|Lorenzo \"MC Ren\" Patterson]]\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as [[Jerry Heller]]\n* Marlon Yates Jr. as [[The D.O.C.|Tracy \"The D.O.C.\" Curry]]\n* R.

He is arrested, and Eazy bails him out of jail. According to recorded N.W.A lore, Dre did land in jail, but it was over unpaid tickets on his [[Mazda RX7]].

Dre is [[DJing]] there with Yella in a puffy, lavender jacket and warns Cube that the crowd will be tough. Cube wins over the crowd with \"Gangsta Gangsta.\" Eazy and MC Ren are the only Crips in a crowd of mostly Bloods. The show actually happened at a Compton skating rink in which there was an overwhelming presence of Bloods. Cube did perform \"Gangsta Gangsta,\" but mostly did dirty parodies of popular tracks. Dre's costumes were reserved for his first group World Class Wreckin\u2019 Cru.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/13/straight-outta-compton-film-ice-cube|title=Straight Outta Compton: fact-checking the film \u2026 with Ice Cube|date=August 13, 2015|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\n* In the film, \u201cBoyz-n-the-Hood\u201d almost doesn't happen because HBO doesn't like the lyrics. In real life, HBO did recoil at the song and walked out on the session.<ref name=\"daily\" />\n* In the film, Heller hears \"Boyz-in-the-Hood\" and asks Eazy to go into business together. They later form Ruthless Records and Heller lands N.W.A a deal with Priority Records after a show in a roller rink. In his 2007 memoir \"Ruthless,\" Heller (who was not involved with the film) says that it was Eazy who sought him out, not the other way around, and he even paid a mutual acquaintance $750 to make an introduction. The Priority deal went down the week after N.W.A played a successful show at a local roller rink.<ref name=\"daily\" />\n* In the film, NWA is brutally harassed by racist cops who hate rappers for looking like gangbangers as an outraged Heller looks on in shock. Soon afterward Cube writes some lyrics, Dre gives his approval, and they quickly begin recording Fuck tha Police. In real life, members of N.W.A did get harassed by cops outside of Audio Achievements while recording ''Straight Outta Compton'' in 1987. But Cube had the concept for \"Fuck tha Police\" long before Dre was on board, despite Dre's own frustrations with law enforcement.<ref name=\"daily\" />\n* In the film, Ice Cube finally quits N.W.A after voicing his displeasure over his contract status with Heller and Eazy. In his book, Heller claims the group voted Cube out at the end of their first tour because of his griping about proper compensation.<ref name=\"daily\" /> Ice Cube has said he thought it was ridiculous that Eazy and Heller were driving luxury cars and living in mansions while he still lived with his parents. But departing N.W.A. was not an easy decision. He secretly consulted with publicist Pat Charbonnet (who isn't portrayed in the film), who facilitated his solo deal with Priority Records.<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n* In the film, Knight and his goons beat up Eazy to get him to release Dre from the label. Dre has denied knowing of Knight's plans that night in 1991. In real life, Suge Knight told Eazy-E that he had kidnapped Jerry Heller and was holding him prisoner in a van. This did not convince Eazy-E to release Dr. Dre and The D.O.C. from Ruthless, and Suge Knight threatened Eazy-E's family. He gave Eazy-E a piece of paper that contained Eazy's mother's address, telling him, \"I know where your mama stays.\" Eazy-E finally signed Dr. Dre and The D.O.C.'s releases, officially ending N.W.A.<ref>Borgmeyer, Jon; Lang, Holly (2006). Dr. Dre: A Biography. Greenwood Publishing Group. pp. 52\u201355. {{ISBN|0-313-33826-4}}.</ref> In his book, Heller corroborates the movie's assertion that Eazy-E wanted to retaliate by killing Knight. He also claims that Knight wanted three Ruthless artists\u2014Dre, D.O.C., and Dre's girlfriend Michel\u2019le (whom Knight later married)\u2014released from their contracts so they could sign with Knight and Sony. A lawsuit against Dre, Knight, and Sony was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"daily\" />\n* Dre witnesses Knight and his gangbanger buddies intimidating a man in his underwear with a dog in the Death Row Records offices, then leaves in protest and leads cops on a dramatic high-speed chase that ends with his arrest. Dre told The Hollywood Reporter that the scene really happened: \"I was like, 'What the f\u2014 is going on?' I was ready to leave anyways. This was the extra push. The guy in the underwear? All this shit actually happened.\" Dre was sentenced to eight months in prison for drunk-driving his Ferrari through Beverly Hills in the late-night, 90-mph chase.<ref name=\"daily\" />\n* In the film, Eazy is visited in the hospital by Dr. Dre. Ice Cube arrives to see him too, but can't bring himself to enter Eazy's room. In real life, DJ Yella remained close to Eazy throughout the post-N.W.A breakup. Yella was also the only member of N.W.A to attend Eazy's funeral.<ref name=\"daily\" />\n* In the film, Cube and his new group [[Da Lench Mob]] are suddenly attacked by unidentified assailants. In reality, Cube's dispute was with [[Above the Law (group)|Above the Law]]. He and their rapper/producer Cold 187&nbsp;um had already fought at an Anaheim show earlier that year, and Cube brought along Da Lench Mob partly as protection. [[Shorty from Da Lench Mob]] threw the first blow. It was a wild showdown, with tables flying and shiners administered. But, Cube wasn't involved. When it began, he was speaking on a panel.<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n* Towards the movie's end, Eazy asks Cube about reuniting NWA. Cube says he's down if Jerry Heller isn't involved, and Eazy fires the manager shortly after. Eazy then brings the reunion idea to Dre, who is 100% on board. In reality, Eazy and Cube did speak of an NWA reunion not long before Eazy was diagnosed with AIDS. But, Dre hadn't committed to it. In fact, Cold 187&nbsp;um says he wasn't planning on producing any new NWA tracks.<ref name=\"guardian\" />\n\n==== Reactions from the depicted ====\nOn June 10, 2015, [[MC Ren]] took to [[Twitter]] to voice his displeasure at the lack of exposure his character had in the ''Straight Outta Compton'' trailer, saying \"Man fuck these bitches at universal pictures leaving me out the movie trailers {{Sic|tryin}} to rewrite history.\" and \"When you have bitches work on a hip hop film that don't know shit about hip hop this is what happens.
