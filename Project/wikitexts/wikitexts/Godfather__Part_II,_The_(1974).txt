The film is partially based on the 1969 novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' by [[Mario Puzo]], who co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. ''Part II'' serves as both a sequel and a prequel to the 1972 film ''[[The Godfather]]'', presenting parallel dramas: one picks up the 1958 story of [[Michael Corleone]] ([[Al Pacino]]), the new [[Crime boss|Don]] of the [[Corleone family]], protecting the family business in the aftermath of an attempt on his life; the prequel covers the journey of his father, [[Vito Corleone]] ([[Robert De Niro]]), from his Sicilian childhood to the founding of his family enterprise in New York City. The ensemble cast also features [[Robert Duvall]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Talia Shire]], [[Morgana King]], [[John Cazale]], [[Mariana Hill]], and [[Lee Strasberg]].\n\nFollowing the success of the first film, [[Paramount Pictures]] began developing a follow-up, with many of the cast and crew returning. Coppola, who was given more creative control, had wanted to make both a sequel and a prequel to ''The Godfather'' that would tell the story of the rise of Vito and the fall of Michael. Principal photography began in October 1973 and wrapped up in June 1974. ''The Godfather Part II'' premiered in New York City on December 12, 1974, and was released in the United States on December 20, 1974, receiving divided reviews from critics; its reputation, however, improved rapidly, and it soon became the subject of critical re-appraisal. It grossed $48 million in the United States and Canada and up to $93&nbsp;million worldwide on a $13&nbsp;million budget. The film was nominated for [[47th Academy Awards|eleven Academy Awards]], and became the first sequel to win [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Its six Oscar wins also included [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Coppola, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for De Niro and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola and Puzo. Pacino won Best Actor at the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA's]] and was nominated at the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscars]].\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Part II'' remains a highly influential film, especially in the [[gangster film|gangster]] genre. It is considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]], as well as the rare example of a sequel that may be superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola\">{{cite web |author=Stax |date=July 28, 2003 |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115731/http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |access-date=November 30, 2010}}</ref> In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked it as the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|32nd-greatest film in American film history]] and it retained this position [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|10 years later]].<ref name=\"afi\">[http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf \"Citizen Kane Stands the Test of Time\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811070405/http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |date=August 11, 2011 }}.

Vito escapes to New York City and is registered on arrival as \"[[Vito Corleone]]\". In 1917, Vito lives in New York with his wife, [[Carmela Corleone|Carmela]], and their infant son, [[Sonny Corleone|Sonny]]. He loses his job due to the interference of [[Don Fanucci]], a local [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]] extortionist. His neighbor [[Peter Clemenza]] asks Vito to hide a bag of guns; as thanks, Clemenza enlists Vito's help in stealing a rug, which he gifts to Carmela.\n\nThe Corleones have three more children: sons [[Fredo Corleone|Fredo]] and [[Michael Corleone|Michael]], and daughter [[Connie Corleone|Connie]]. Meanwhile, Vito, Clemenza, and new partner [[Salvatore Tessio]] make income by stealing goods and reselling them door-to-door. This enterprise attracts the attention of Fanucci, who extorts them. Vito convinces his skeptical partners that he will talk Fanucci into accepting a smaller payment. During a neighborhood [[Calendar of saints|festa]], Vito pays an incredulous Fanucci a much smaller amount and is offered a job as an enforcer. Vito later kills Fanucci in his apartment. Vito becomes a formidable and well-respected community member by helping locals in exchange for \"favors\".\n\nIn 1923, Vito and family visit Sicily. Vito and his business partner visit Don Ciccio, ostensibly to ask for Ciccio's blessing on their olive oil business. Ciccio asks for the name of Vito's father; Vito reveals his identity and stabs Ciccio to death, avenging his family.\n\n===Michael===\nIn 1958, during his son's [[First Communion]] party at [[Lake Tahoe]], Michael has a series of meetings in his role as the [[Crime boss|don]] of the [[Corleone crime family]]. [[Frank Pentangeli]], a Corleone [[caporegime|capo]], is dismayed that Michael refuses to help defend his [[The Bronx|Bronx]] territory against the Rosato brothers, who work for [[Hyman Roth]], a [[Jewish Mob]] boss and long-standing Corleone business partner. That night, a failed assassination attempt at his home prompts Michael to suddenly depart after confiding in ''[[consigliere]]'' [[Tom Hagen]] that he suspects a traitor within the family.\n\nMichael suspects Roth planned the assassination, but falsely tells Roth he suspects Pentangeli. In New York City, under Michael's instructions, Pentangeli attempts to make peace with the Rosatos, but they try to kill him. A sickly Roth, Michael, and several of their partners travel to [[Havana]] to discuss their future Cuban business prospects under the cooperative government of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Michael becomes reluctant to continue operating in Cuba given the ongoing [[Cuban Revolution]]. On New Year's Eve, Fredo pretends not to know Johnny Ola, Roth's right-hand man, but later inadvertently reveals they know each other, leading Michael to realize that Fredo is the traitor. Michael orders hits on Ola and Roth; his enforcer strangles Ola with a coat hanger but is killed by Cuban soldiers as he tries to smother Roth. Batista abdicates due to [[Battle of Santa Clara|rebel advances]]. During the ensuing chaos, Michael, Fredo, and Roth separately escape Cuba. Back home, Michael learns that his wife [[Kay Adams-Corleone|Kay]] has miscarried.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a [[United States congressional committee|Senate committee]] on organized crime is investigating the Corleone family. Pentangeli agrees to testify against Michael, who he believes had betrayed him to the Rosatos, and is placed under [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection]]. On returning to Nevada, Fredo tells Michael that he did not know that Roth had intended to kill him, but that he resents being disregarded as stupid by the family and feels that he should have taken over the family after their father's death. Michael disowns Fredo, but gives orders that he is not to be harmed while their mother is alive. Michael sends for Pentangeli's brother from Sicily, and Pentangeli, after seeing his brother in the hearing room, retracts his previous statement indicting Michael in organized crime; the hearing dissolves in an uproar. Kay reveals to Michael that she actually had an abortion, not a miscarriage, and that she intends to leave him and take their children. Outraged, Michael strikes Kay, banishes her from the family, and takes sole custody of the children.\n\nCarmela dies sometime later, and Michael hurries to wrap up loose ends. At the funeral, Michael appears to forgive Fredo at Connie's behest, but exchanges a glance with Corleone enforcer [[Al Neri]] suggesting that Fredo is to be killed. Soon afterward, Neri shoots Fredo dead while the two are fishing, as Michael watches from his den. Roth is forced to return to the United States after being refused [[Right of asylum|asylum]] and [[Law of Return|entry to Israel]]. On Michael's orders,  Roth is assassinated by Corleone caporegime Rocco Lampone during an interview at the [[Miami International Airport]]; Lampone is killed in turn by a federal agent while attempting to flee the scene. At Pentangeli's compound, Hagen visits and the two discuss how failed plotters against the [[Roman emperor]] often committed suicide in return for clemency for their families; Pentangeli is later found dead in his bathtub, having slit his wrists. Kay visits her children; as she is saying goodbye, Michael arrives and closes the door on her. \n\nThe film ends with a flashback to Vito's 50th birthday party, occurring on the same day that [[Bombing of Pearl Harbor|the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor]]. While the family waits to surprise Vito, Michael announces that he has dropped out of college and joined the [[U.S. Marines|Marines]], angering Sonny and Hagen; Fredo is the only member of the family to support his decision. Back in the present, Michael sits alone at the family compound, looking out over the lake.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Michael Corleone]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as [[Tom Hagen]]\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as [[Kay Adams-Corleone]]\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Vito Corleone]]\n** [[Oreste Baldini]] as young Vito Corleone\n* [[John Cazale]] as [[Fredo Corleone]]\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Connie Corleone]]\n* [[Lee Strasberg]] as [[Hyman Roth]]\n* [[Michael V.

In 1981, Paramount released the ''Godfather Epic'' boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. Coppola returned to the film again in 1992 when he updated that release with footage from ''[[The Godfather Part&nbsp;III]]'' and more unreleased material. This home viewing release, under the title ''The Godfather Trilogy 1901\u20131980'', had a total run time of 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes), not including the set's bonus documentary by Jeff Werner on the making of the films, \"The Godfather Family: A Look Inside\".\n\n''The Godfather DVD Collection'' was released on October 9, 2001 in a package<ref>\"DVD review: 'The Godfather Collection'\".

The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a \"Godfather\" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.<ref name=\"dvd\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection [2001]</ref>\n\nThe restoration was confirmed by Francis Ford Coppola during a question-and-answer session for ''[[The Godfather Part&nbsp;III]]'', when he said that he had just seen the new transfer and it was \"terrific\".\n\n==== Restoration ====\nAfter a careful restoration by [[Robert A. Harris]] of Film Preserve, the first two ''Godfather'' films were released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 23, 2008, under the title ''The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration''.
