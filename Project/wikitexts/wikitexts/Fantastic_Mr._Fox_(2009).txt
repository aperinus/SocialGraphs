The project is based on the [[Fantastic Mr Fox|1970 children's novel of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. [[George Clooney]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Jason Schwartzman]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Willem Dafoe]], and [[Owen Wilson]] star. The plot follows the titular character Mr. Fox (Clooney), as his spree of thefts results in his family, and later his community, being hunted down by three farmers known as Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce ([[Hugo Guinness]]), and Bean ([[Michael Gambon]]).\n\nDevelopment on the project began in 2004 as a collaboration between Anderson and [[Henry Selick]] (who worked with Anderson on the 2004 film ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]'') under [[Revolution Studios]]. In 2007, Revolution and Selick left for other projects; work on the film was moved to [[20th Century Fox]] under the [[20th Century Fox Animation]] label, where production began in 2007. Released in the United States on November 13, 2009, to critical acclaim, with praise for Anderson's direction, humor, and stop-motion animation. However, it underperformed at the box office, grossing just $46.5 million against a $40 million budget. The film received [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], losing both awards to ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile raiding Berk's [[squab (food)|Squab]] Farm, Mr. Fox triggers a fox trap caging himself along with his wife Felicity. Felicity reveals her pregnancy to her husband and pleads with him to find a safer job if they escape, and he agrees.\n\nTwo human years (12 fox years) later, the Foxes and their son Ash are living in a hole. Mr. Fox, now a newspaper columnist, moves the family into a better home inside a tree, ignoring the warnings of his lawyer, Clive Badger, about how dangerous the area is for foxes due to its proximity to facilities run by three farmers: Walt Boggis, Nate Bunce, and Frank Bean.\n\nSoon after the Foxes move in, Felicity's nephew, Kristofferson Silverfox, comes to live with them due to his father receiving long-term medical treatment for double pneumonia. While Mr. and Mrs. Fox welcome him, Ash finds this situation intolerable, as his soft-spoken cousin is superior to him at almost everything, and is charming everyone at his expense. Longing for his days as a thief, Mr. Fox and his opossum friend Kylie, the superintendent, steal produce and poultry from all three farms. They take Kristofferson along on the raids, which deepens Ash's resentment. Mr. Fox conceals these outings from Felicity, who becomes suspicious when unexplained food appears in their larder.\n\nAngered by the raids, the farmers decide to kill Mr. Fox. They camp out near his home, and when Mr. Fox emerges, they open fire but only shoot off his tail. After demolishing the site of the tree while attempting to dig Mr. Fox out, they discover the Foxes have dug an escape tunnel. As the Foxes will have to surface for food and water, the farmers wait at the tunnel mouth. Underground, Felicity is upset that Mr. Fox returned to his thieving ways.\n\nThe group encounters Badger and many other local animal residents whose homes the farmers have also destroyed. As the animals begin fearing starvation, Mr. Fox calls them together and leads them on a digging expedition to tunnel to the three farms, stealing all of their prized goods. While the animals feast, Ash and Kristofferson begin to reconcile after Kristofferson defends Ash from Beaver's son. The cousins slip away from the celebration and return to Bean's farm, intending to reclaim the missing tail, but Bean's wife captures Kristofferson.\n\nDiscovering that Mr. Fox has stolen their goods, the farmers and the fire chief flood the animals' tunnel network with some of Bean's [[cider]], forcing the animals to retreat to the sewers. Realizing that the farmers plan to use Kristofferson to lure him into an ambush, Mr. Fox heads to the surface to surrender, but returns when Rat, Bean's violent security guard, confronts the animals and attacks Ash and Felicity. A fight between Mr. Fox and Rat results in the latter being pushed into a generator, electrocuting him. Before dying, Rat reveals that Kristofferson is being held in an attic on Bean's farm, prompting Mr. Fox to organize a rescue mission.\n\nMr. Fox asks the farmers for a meeting in town near the sewer hub, offering to surrender to free Kristofferson and spare himself and the other animals. The farmers prepare an ambush, but the animals, anticipating it, launch a counterattack that allows Mr. Fox, Ash, and Kylie to enter Bean's farm undetected. Ash frees Kristofferson and impresses his father and the group by braving enemy fire to release a [[rabies|rabid]] [[beagle]] to keep the farmers at bay, allowing the group to escape back to the sewers.\n\nAs the farmers wait for the animals to come out of the hole, the animals settle into their new homes in the sewers, inviting any other animals to join them. Soon after, Fox raids a grocery store owned by the farmers, where Felicity reveals her upcoming pregnancy as the animals dance in the aisle, celebrating their abundant new food source.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[George Clooney]] as Foxy Fox\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Felicity Fox\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Ash Fox\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Clive Badger Esq.\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Rat\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as Franklin \"Frank\" Bean\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as Coach Skip\n* [[Wallace Wolodarsky]] as Kylie\n* [[Eric Chase Anderson|Eric Anderson]] as Kristofferson Silverfox\n* [[Jarvis Cocker]] as Petey\n* [[Wes Anderson]] as Stan Weasel\n* Robin Hurlstone as Walter \"Walt\" Boggis\n* [[Hugo Guinness]] as Nathan \"Nate\" Bunce\n* [[Helen McCrory]] as Mrs. Bean\n* Juman Malouf as Agnes\n* [[Karen Duffy]] as Linda Otter\n* [[Roman Coppola]] as Squirrel Contractor\n* [[Garth Jennings]] as Bean's son\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Daniel Peabody\n* Steven Rales as Beaver\n* [[Jeremy Dawson (producer)|Jeremy Dawson]] as Beaver's Son\n* James Hamilton as Phil Mole\n* Jennifer Furches as Dr. Badger\n* [[Mario Batali]] as Rabbit\n* [[Allison Abbate]] as Rabbit's ex-girlfriend\n* Molly Cooper as Rabbit Girl\n* [[Adrien Brody]] as Mouse\n* Martin Ballard as Fire chief\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Joe Roth]] and [[Revolution Studios]] bought the film rights to ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' in 2004.

Even the farmers, who are made to look a touch evil, don't seem capable of it. We never feel the tension of watching the Fox family facing real peril.
