The troupe's main attraction is a portal to a magical \"Imaginarium\", a surreal dream world that transforms according to its participants' own desires and offers them a choice between difficult self-fulfillment or easy ignorance. After a drunkard is swayed to the latter, Parnassus says he has lost \"another one\" to Mr. Nick, a suave personification of the [[Devil]], who often appears without warning to taunt Parnassus and gloat over Parnassus's failures. He reminds Parnassus that in three days Valentina turns 16, and her soul will belong to Mr. Nick. Hundreds of years ago, Mr. Nick tricked Parnassus into accepting immortality, after making a wager similar to his current predicament.\n\nAs the troupe crosses a bridge, Anton notices someone hanging beneath it. After they rescue the man and revive him, he spits out a golden pipe that allowed him to continue breathing while being hanged; unwilling to explain his past, the man convinces his rescuers that he has [[amnesia]]. Parnassus sadly contemplates the impending loss of his daughter, and Mr. Nick visits him, revealing the identity of the rescued man: a disgraced philanthropist named Tony Shepard, who was being hanged by Russian gangsters for owing them money. Mr. Nick also offers Parnassus a new wager: Valentina can stay with Parnassus past the age of 16 if Parnassus can win five souls to the path of self-fulfillment before Mr. Nick can win five souls to the path of ignorance, all within the universe of the Imaginarium.\n\nThe newcomer Tony soon joins the troupe as a barker even more charismatic than Anton, who is becoming suspicious. Tony convinces the troupe to remodel the show into a more modern act. While performing, Tony lures a posh, affluent woman into the Imaginarium and follows her, where they enter a pastel-coloured dream-world representing the woman's imagination. The woman's imagination also changes Tony's face to one of her liking; Tony dances elegantly with her, and they notice a motel run by Mr. Nick, but Tony convinces the woman instead to take a gondola ride that wins the first soul for Parnassus. Tony falls back out of the Imaginarium, returning his face to normal. The woman exits shortly after and gives the troupe a vast sum of money as thanks for her marvellous experience. When three other women enter, each re-emerges elated; and thus Parnassus has won a total of four souls. However, Mr. Nick easily takes the souls of four Russian gangsters looking to hunt Tony down for his debts. They chase Tony into the Imaginarium and quickly fall into a trap laid by Mr. Nick. Thus, the score is tied: four to four.\n\nWith the bet nearing its end, Parnassus reluctantly reveals to Valentina her secret origins: after aging from immortality, Parnassus made a new pact with Mr. Nick to be youthful again, in order to win the heart of a woman he loved. In exchange, any child he fathered would become Mr. Nick's property at the age of 16. Valentina is horrified at her father's revelation. Meanwhile, having discovered that Tony is a fraudulent charity scammer who stole organs from orphans in developing countries and sold them to wealthy westerners, Anton confronts Tony, but Tony fights him off, pushes Valentina into the Imaginarium, and joins her. Influenced by Valentina's romantic desires, Tony's face changes to that of her dream lover, and they float along a beautiful river in a gondola, fulfilling their shared sexual feelings. A child in rags disrupts their serene boat trip, transitioning the scene to one of Tony as a philanthropist, speaking at a fundraiser for impoverished children. Anton, following the pair into the Imaginarium, appears in the form of an outspoken child and exposes Tony as a fraud. A mob of angry benefactors pursues Tony, and, as the landscape disintegrates, Anton confesses his love for Valentina before falling into a void.\n\nDistraught and angry over her father's bargain and a lifetime of hiding the truth from her, Valentina willingly gives her soul over to Mr. Nick. Disillusioned by the easy victory, Mr. Nick offers Parnassus yet another bargain: to trade Valentina's soul for Tony's. Therefore, as the mob approaches Tony to hang him, Parnassus presents Tony with his true sturdy golden pipe that will allow him to survive the hanging as well as a near-perfect but brittle replica. Parnassus hopes that Tony will choose wrong; indeed, Tony inserts the cheap replica in his windpipe and thus dies when the mob lynches him. Mr. Nick keeps his word, freeing Valentina's soul but not revealing her new location to Parnassus, who is abandoned to wander in despair for years, trapped in his own Imaginarium.\n\nOne day, Parnassus looks up to find himself a pitiful beggar back in London, when Valentina suddenly walks by him. He sees that she is now happily married to Anton, and they have a daughter. As Parnassus watches them through a window, his old assistant Percy walks up to him, dissuading him from interrupting Valentina's new cheerful life. Parnassus finally seems to be at peace, just knowing that his daughter is happy. Soon, Parnassus and Percy have teamed up again, presenting [[toy theatre]]s of the Imaginarium and the troupe on a street corner. As Mr. Nick appears one final time to beckon Parnassus over to him for a new bargain, Percy quickly intervenes, ordering Parnassus back to work.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Johnny Depp (July 2009) 2.jpg\n| width1 = 134\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Jude Law 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| width2 = 145\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Colin Farrell by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width3 = 127\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell all completed the film after the death of Heath Ledger\n}}\n\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as Tony Shepard.

He put several references to sudden, tragic, and premature death into his script before the loss of Ledger became a reality.

And that's exactly how it works. ''[...]'' That's what's funny, when Johnny appears so many people ''think'' it's Heath! And it's a trick: Johnny's not ''doing'' anything. He looks like Johnny. ''[...]''\n\n''[During the initial shoot]'' Heath was on stage and the Russians are appearing, and he was behaving in a very funny way, he was moving around, and I said, 'Heath, I know what you're doing.'

Wonderfully enchanting and beautiful, ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'' is a uniquely ingenious, captivating creation; by turns wild, thrilling and hilarious in all its crazed, dilapidated majesty.

This experience was the shooting of ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus''. The reasons for its uniqueness, sadly, are probably obvious to anyone who reads this.\n\nThree of us had been asked to complete a task that had been set in motion by a man we greatly liked and respected as both a person and an artist. Being part of this film was never about filling Heath's shoes as much as seeing them across the finish line. How I wish he had brought the film to its completion himself. Of course, the whole crew felt this way. And the cast that we joined felt it, too. It was this spirit of grieving the loss of Heath, that Johnny and Jude and I joined. But there was also a sense of dogged insistence. Insistence that Heath's last piece of work should not be kept in the shadow of the light of day.\n\nMore than anything, though \u2013 more than the sadness and shock, the vulnerability and un-suredness as to whether it was right to complete the film or not \u2013 was an incredible sense of love. A community of people, caterers and actors, electricians and makeup artists had been brought together in a recognized sense of love and obligation, for and to, one of cinema's finest actors and most generous of men. It will be this sense of love amidst the sadness I will remember most. Such a gift and an honor, from Heath, to be a part of the trail that he left behind.\n\nRIP Heath Ledger x<ref>{{cite news |url=http://riskybusiness.blogs.thr.com/2010/01/colin-farrell-imaginarium-of-doctor-parnassus-heath-ledger-jude-law-johnny-depp.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715013207/http://riskybusiness.blogs.thr.com/2010/01/colin-farrell-imaginarium-of-doctor-parnassus-heath-ledger-jude-law-johnny-depp.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Risky Business: Colin Farrell on 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' |date=January 2010 |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=19 September 2011 }}</ref>}}\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Principal photography]] in Vancouver wrapped, as planned, on 15 April, but the production was soon beset by further tragedy when producer [[William Vince]] died of cancer, just two days after model shooting back in London had wrapped.<ref name=\"smart.co.uk\"/> Fellow producer Amy Gilliam, Terry's daughter, remembered, \"''[Bill Vince]'' always said, 'If you get your film in the can, you'll be all right.'
