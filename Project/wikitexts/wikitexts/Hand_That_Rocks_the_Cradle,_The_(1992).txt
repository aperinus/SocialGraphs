Its plot follows the pregnant wife of a [[Seattle]] [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] who kills himself after he is accused of [[sexual abuse|sexual misconduct]] by his patients. The shock leads the wife to miscarry, after which she poses as a [[nanny]] for one of her husband's accusers, and slowly begins to infiltrate the family. The title is taken from [[The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (poem)|an 1865 poem]] by [[William Ross Wallace]] and there are several nods to the [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''.  ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'' grossed approximately $140 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Seattle]], housewife Claire Bartel is happily married and pregnant with her second child. At a routine check-up, she is [[Sexual assault|sexually molested]] by her new [[obstetrician]], Dr. Victor Mott. Traumatized, she tells her husband Michael, who encourages her to report Dr. Mott to the state medical board. Her accusation prompts four more women to come forward about Dr. Mott assaulting them, and multiple charges are prepared against him. Dr. Mott commits suicide to avoid being arrested. Lawyers tell Mott's pregnant widow that her husband's assets have been frozen because of the lawsuits. They also reveal that he voided his [[life insurance]] contract by committing suicide, and she will lose her luxurious home. Stressed, Mrs. Mott goes into pre-term labor, loses her baby, and undergoes an emergency [[hysterectomy]]. While recovering, she sees a news story identifying Claire as the first woman who came forward with the allegations against her husband.\n\nSix months later, Claire has given birth to a boy, Joey. Looking for a nanny, she unknowingly hires Mrs. Mott, who is going under the alias \"Peyton Flanders\". Mott wages a campaign to undermine Claire in her household, seeking revenge against Claire for reporting her husband in spite of his behavior, as her husband was her only chance to have children. She frequently breastfeeds Joey in secret; this causes him to stop taking Claire's milk. Mott tries to turn Claire's daughter Emma against her and secretly destroys Michael's office proposal. Solomon, an [[intellectually disabled]] handyman who has been assisting the Bartels, discovers Mott breastfeeding Joey. To prevent him from exposing her, Mrs. Mott implies to Claire that she believes Solomon may be [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] Emma. Mott plants a pair of Emma's underwear in Solomon's toolbox, leading Claire to fire him, to Emma's disappointment and causing her to become distant from her mother as Mott had planned. Unknown to the family except for Emma, Solomon keeps his watchful eyes over them. Knowing that Claire's close friend Marlene had been Michael's ex-girlfriend before he married Claire, Mott suggests to Michael that he arrange a surprise birthday party for Claire, leading Marlene and Michael to meet in secret. Claire accuses Michael of having an affair with Marlene, only to find the party-goers waiting in the next room.\n\nA now wary Claire begins to suspect \"Peyton's\" hand in all of these incidents and suggests to Michael that they should take a family vacation without \"Peyton\". Mott overhears this and boobytraps the greenhouse for Claire. Marlene discovers Mott's identity, but before she can tell Claire, Mott tricks her into going into the greenhouse, where she is killed by the falling glass ceiling. Knowing that Claire suffers from [[asthma]], Mott empties all of her inhalers. When Claire finds Marlene's bloodied body, she has an asthma attack and is briefly hospitalized. Michael is left distraught over Marlene's death and his wife's condition; Mott attempts to seduce him, but he rejects her. Claire uncovers the truth about Mott, and confronts her while revealing the truth to Michael. They kick her out, and Michael tells Claire to get Emma and Joey so they can head to a hotel for safety.\n\nMott breaks into the house and hits Michael with a shovel, knocking him down the stairs and breaking his legs. She then attempts to fulfill her true goal: taking Emma and Joey for herself, but after seeing Mott assault her mother, Emma outsmarts Mott and locks her in the nursery, declaring that Mott will never be her mother. Mott escapes and finds Solomon in the attic, aiding the kids' escape. She attempts to kill Claire but stops after Claire appears to be having another asthma attack, prompting Mott to mock her. As she tries to take Joey, Claire gets up, having faked her asthma attack, and viciously attacks a stunned Mott, and Solomon distracts her enough for Claire to push Mott out of the window, impaling her on the [[picket fence]] and killing her. Touched at how Solomon risked his life to protect her family, Claire welcomes him back, and they all leave the attic to help Michael up as the police and paramedics arrive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n\n* [[Rebecca De Mornay]] as Mrs. Mott\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as Claire Bartel\n* [[Matt McCoy (actor)|Matt McCoy]] as Michael Bartel\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Solomon\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Marlene Craven\n* [[Madeline Zima]] as Emma Bartel\n* [[John de Lancie]] as Dr. Victor Mott\n* Kevin Skousen as Marty Craven\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'' originated as Silver's film school thesis.<ref name=Kempley>{{cite web|author=Kempley, Rita|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/thehandthatrocksthecradlerkempley_a0a294.htm|title='The Hand That Rocks the Cradle' (R)|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1992-01-10|access-date=2020-06-19}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1990, it was reported that Interscope Communications was preparing the film for [[Hollywood Pictures]].

Though Mr. Hanson is a slick movie maker, he is not an especially persuasive one here. Don't be gulled by those who would compare ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'' to ''Fatal Attraction'', which features three strong characters who, in one way or another, are ready to answer for their actions.\" He added that \"Mr. Hanson creates the occasionally effective shock effect to satisfy those who want to squeal in mock fright. More often the devices he uses are such tired tricks as the crosscutting between two sets of simultaneous, often innocent, actions to create the illusion of suspense that can't be sustained.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Canby |first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |date=January 10, 1992 |title=Review/Film; Help Wanted: A Nanny, Duplicity & Malice Req'd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/10/movies/review-film-help-wanted-a-nanny-duplicity-malice-req-d.html |access-date=April 7, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Rebecca Hawkes of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the film a rating a 3 stars out of 5 and said that \"It\u2019s a tense, viscerally unsettling moment, that helps make the film into something more than just a fun, formulaic thriller\",<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11316540/The-Hand-That-Rocks-The-Cradle-review-tense-and-fun.html | title=The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, review: 'tense and fun'| publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=December 30, 2014| access-date=April 7, 2016| last=Hawkes | first=Rebecca }}</ref> while Sue Heal of [[The Radio Times]] rated the film 4 stars out of 5, stated that \"This is pure unbridled hokum, of course, but extremely effective until the last 30 minutes, when the plot rapidly self-destructs.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=The Hand That Rocks the Cradle |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/movie-guide/b-dfmcn3/the-hand-that-rocks-the-cradle/ |access-date=April 7, 2016 |publisher=[[The Radio Times]]}}</ref>\n\n''[[Washington Post]]'' reviewer Rita Kempley criticized the movie, arguing that it is [[anti-feminist]].<ref name=Kempley/>\n\n==Home media==\n''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'' was released on [[VHS]] on July 8, 1992, on [[DVD]] on December 8, 1998 with the original theatrical trailer as the sole special feature.
