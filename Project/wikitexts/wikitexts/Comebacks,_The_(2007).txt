This film is a [[parody]] of the clich\u00e9s and plots of the [[List of sports films|sports film]] genre. In the UK, Greece, Finland, Australia and New Zealand this film is called '''''Sports Movie'''''. The movie was released to theaters on October 19, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n{{more plot|date=October 2015}}\nCoach Lambeau Fields ([[David Koechner]]) is pathetic. He has the distinction of being the worst coach in the history of sports anyone can recall. A loser of enormous proportions, the incompetent and seemingly hopeless coach is convinced by fellow coach Freddie Wiseman ([[Carl Weathers]]) to return to the field for one last shot. Assuring his long suffering wife, Barb ([[Melora Hardin]]), that he will not ignore his family, Coach moves them to Plainfolk, Texas where he hopes to redeem himself and his reputation. Here he begins yet another attempt to improve his abysmal record \u2013 this time as the coach of the football team at Heartland State University. But he is saddled with a team of misfits \u2013 most of whom don't know the difference between a line of scrimmage and a line at the cafeteria.\n\nAlthough the team and townsfolk are leery of the newcomer's approach, the Coach uses his unorthodox methods to whip this group of rag-tags into shape \u2013 both on and off the field. While the audience follows their winding road to the playoffs, the film pokes fun at the clich\u00e9s and conventions of other sports flicks. The team does make progress, so much so that they actually make it to the South-Southwest Conference Championship at the 2nd Annual Toilet Bowl.\n\nFacing their fiercest opponents yet and yearning to win the big game, The Comebacks face off with the Lone Star State Unbeatables. And as every great sports team has always done, The Comebacks use ingenuity and unorthodox measures in the final showdown where the best team win. The Comebacks are victorious, but Lambeau is subsequently knocked down in a surprise attack by a bus with Freddie driving it, who laughs manically as Lambeau is in pain. Lambeau groans in agony.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Koechner]] as Coach [[Lambeau Field]]s, the coach of the Heartland Comebacks\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as Freddie Wiseman, the coach of the Lone Star State Unbeatables\n* [[Melora Hardin]] as Barb Fields, the wife of Lambeau Fields\n* [[Brooke Nevin]] as Michelle Fields, the daughter of Lambeau Fields\n* [[Robert Ri'chard]] as Aseel Tare (\"uh-seel tah-ree\", mispronounced by Coach Fields as \"[[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|ACL tear]]\"), running back \n* [[Noureen DeWulf]] as Jizminder Featherfoot, kicker\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Lance Truman, quarterback\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Mr. Truman, Lance's father\n* [[Jackie Long]] as Trotter, wide receiver\n* [[Jesse Garcia]] as Jorge Juanson, receiver\n* George Back as Buddy Boy, lineman\n* [[Martin Spanjers]] as Randy Randinger, towel boy\n* [[Jermaine Williams]] as iPod\n* [[Jillian Grace]] as [[Maria Sharapova]]\n* [[Chauntal Lewis]] as Freddy's Girl\n;Cameos\n* [[Eric Christian Olsen]] as Foreign Exchange Student\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Toilet Bowl Referee\n* [[Dennis Rodman]] as Warden\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as Cowboy\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Sheriff\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Barber\n* [[Will Arnett]] as Mailman\n* [[Kerri Kenney]] as Sports Judge\n* [[Lawrence Taylor]] as Himself\n* [[Michael Irvin]] as Himself\n* [[Eric Dickerson]] as Himself\n* [[Stacy Keibler]] as All-American Mom, a character in the toilet bowl [[halftime show]].\n* [[Drew Lachey]] as All-American Dad, a character in the toilet bowl [[halftime show]].\n* [[Jason Sklar]] and [[Randy Sklar]] as Superfans\n* [[Frank Caliendo]] as [[John Madden (American football)|Chip Imitation]]\n\n==Reaction==\nOn Metacritic, the film received a 25/100 rating from 13 reviews, meaning \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-comebacks|title=The Comebacks (2007)|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2020-01-19}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has an approval rating of 9% and an average rating of 2.7/10 from 33 reviews.
