Retrieved September 18, 2013.</ref>\n}}\n'''''Escape to Witch Mountain''''' is a 1975 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] film, based on [[Alexander Key|Alexander H. Key]]'s 1968 novel of the [[Escape to Witch Mountain|same name]] and directed by [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]]. It was released on March 21, 1975 by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution Company]]. It is the first film of the ''[[Witch Mountain (franchise)|Witch Mountain]]'' series.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film centers upon the siblings Tony and Tia, whose surname they initially know only as that of their deceased adoptive parents, Malone. The children are placed in an [[orphanage]], where they face difficulties stemming from their strange [[psychic]]/[[Psionics|psionic]] abilities:  Tony can [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetically]] move and control inanimate objects with the aid of his [[harmonica]], while Tia can communicate [[Telepathy|telepathically]] to Tony, commune empathically with animals, and experience [[Precognition|premonitions]]. Tia also possesses minor telekinetic abilities. She carries a \"star case\" with her at all times, which eventually reveals a strange map. Tia has fragmented memories of her early childhood, including an accident at sea and a man she later remembers as the children's Uncle Ben\u00e9 ({{IPAc-en|audio=Bene speech synthesizer.ogg|b|\u025b|\u02c8|n|e\u026a}}), who they believe drowned during their rescue.\n\nDuring a field trip, Tia experiences a premonition and warns wealthy attorney Lucas Deranian against a potentially dangerous accident. Deranian informs his employer, millionaire Aristotle Bolt, of the children's unique abilities. Bolt, obsessed with the [[paranormal]], demands that Deranian retrieve the children at all costs. Deranian's detective work leads him to the orphanage, where he poses as Tia and Tony's uncle, though not under the name Ben\u00e9, and takes them to Bolt's mansion. Though initially suspicious of Bolt's motives, Tia and Tony are lured in by the wealthy trappings of Bolt's home. Bolt eventually reveals that he has been monitoring the children via a closed-circuit television system and that he and Deranian are fully aware of their unusual powers. The night of this revelation, Tia and Tony make an escape, using their abilities to psionically control a wild mustang, guard dogs, and the security fence, as well as using Winkie, Tia's cat, to make the allergic security guard let them pass.\n\nBolt sends Deranian and a thug, [[\u00dcbermensch|Ubermann]], after the children. Tia and Tony hide out in a green-and-white [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago motor home]] owned by a crotchety widower named Jason O'Day. Initially negative toward the children, Jason gradually begins to recognize their powers and the truth of their story; Tia's vague memories of a disaster at sea intrigue him. He agrees to take the children on the route indicated by Tia's star case, which leads them to a mountain known as Witch Mountain, home to unexplainable phenomena. Avoiding Bolt, the law, and an incited mob convinced the children are witches, they eventually make their way up Witch Mountain, pursued by Deranian and Ubermann, as well as by Bolt in a [[helicopter]]. As their memories begin to fully return, the children realize their accident at sea did not involve a boat but a spacecraft. Tony and Tia are actually of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] origin; the double star emblem on the star case stands for a [[binary star]] system where their home [[planet]] was located.\n\nHaving come to [[Earth]] because their own planet was dying, survivors of the journey made their way to Witch Mountain and formed a community to await the surviving children, each pair in possession of a star case to help them find their way to their new home. Tony and Tia are the first to reach their destination. The children are reunited with their Uncle Ben\u00e9 (who survived after all, thanks to an \"accommodating\" shark whom he'd telepathically asked for help) and board another spacecraft. When Bolt and the others leave in defeat, Jason witnesses the spaceship's return as it flies over him to say a final goodbye then landing nearby where the inhabitants now live.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Jason O'Day, an embittered widower traveling across the country from home.\n* [[Ray Milland]] as Aristotle Bolt, a ruthless and greedy multi-millionaire obsessed with the paranormal and occult. He tries to expose Tony and Tia and increase his wealth.\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Lucas Deranian, Mr. Bolt's well-to-do attorney.\n* [[Kim Richards]] as Tia Malone, a nine-year-old orphan with psychic powers.\n* [[Ike Eisenmann]] as Tony Malone, Tia's older brother, orphan with telekinetic powers.\n* [[Walt Barnes]] as Sheriff Purdey, a sheriff bribed by Bolt to pursue the children.\n* [[Reta Shaw]] as Mrs. Grindley, owner of the orphanage Tia and Tony are sent to after mourning their foster parents.\n* [[Denver Pyle]] as Uncle Ben\u00e9, the children's uncle.\n* [[Alfred Ryder]] as Mr. Michaeljohn, Mr. Bolt\u2019s Astrologer.\n* [[Lawrence Montaigne]] as Ubermann, a henchman assisting Deranian in his pursuit of the siblings.\n* [[Terry Wilson (actor)|Terry Wilson]] as Biff Jenkins.\n* [[George Chandler]] as Grocer\n* [[Dermott Downs]] as Truck, a child from the orphanage who bullies Tony to the point he reveals the power.\n* [[Don Brodie]] as Gasoline Attendant\n* [[Paul Sorensen|Paul Sorenson]] as Sergeant Foss\n* Harry Holcombe as Captain Malone\n* [[Sam Edwards]] as Mate\n* [[Dan Seymour]] as Mr. Bolt\u2019s Psychic\n* Eugene Daniels as Cort\n* Shepherd Sanders as Ali, Mr. Bolt's guru\n* [[Kyle Richards]] as young Tia Malone (in \"elder Tia's\" memories) (uncredited)\n\n== Differences from the novel ==\n{{main|Escape to Witch Mountain}}\n''Escape to Witch Mountain'' is based on the novel by [[Alexander Key]]. Significant differences from the book include its tone and plot elements. For example, in the book, the children are befriended by Father O'Day, an athletic, young Catholic priest, rather than crusty widower Jason O'Day.  The children's ship is shot down, rather than crashed, and the children are olive-skinned, though with light-colored hair, rather than fair-skinned and blonde-haired. In the book, Deranian is the main antagonist, and he is working for a shadowy European cabal who are trying to capture the children for their special powers, instead of for Aristotle Bolt.<ref>{{cite web | title=Escape to Witch Mountain (1975) FAQ | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072951/faq | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | access-date=2009-03-27}}</ref>  The novel is set along or near the Atlantic Coast of the United States, whereas the film was shot along the Pacific Coast in California.\n\n== Filming locations ==\n* [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]], [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/EscapeToWitchMountain/|title = Escape to Witch Mountain}}</ref>\n* [[Felton, California|Felton]], [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz County]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/EscapeToWitchMountain/|title = Escape to Witch Mountain}}</ref>\n* [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], Peninsula School (formerly the Coleman Mansion)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/EscapeToWitchMountain/|title = Escape to Witch Mountain}}</ref>\n* [[Pebble Beach, California]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/EscapeToWitchMountain/|title = Escape to Witch Mountain}}</ref>\n* [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California Avenue<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/EscapeToWitchMountain/|title = Escape to Witch Mountain}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film earned a Total Lifetime Gross at the Domestic North American Box Office of $20,000,000.
