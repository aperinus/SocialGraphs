The film was co-written by Clooney and [[Grant Heslov]], and it portrays the conflict between veteran journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]] (Strathairn) and [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Joseph McCarthy]] of [[Wisconsin]], especially relating to the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] Senator's actions with the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]].\n\nAlthough released in black and white, it was filmed on color [[film stock]], but on a [[grayscale]] set, and was [[Color grading|color-corrected]] to black and white during [[post-production]]. It focuses on the theme of media responsibility, and also addresses what occurs when U.S. journalism offer voices of dissent from government policy. The movie takes its title (which ends with a period or full stop) from the line with which Murrow routinely [[sign-on and sign-off|signed off]] his broadcasts.\n\nThe film was a box office success and received critical acclaim for Clooney's direction, the writing, cinematography, production design and performances (particularly Strathairn's). It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Strathairn.\n\n==Plot==\nThe setting is 1953, during the early days of television [[broadcast journalism]]. [[Edward R. Murrow]], along with his news team, producer [[Fred W. Friendly|Fred Friendly]] and reporter [[Joseph Wershba]], learn of U.S. Air Force officer [[Milo Radulovich]], who is being forcibly discharged because of family members being known Communists and his refusal to denounce them.\n\nInterest is piqued when it is found that the compilation of charges at Radulovich's hearing was in a sealed envelope and nobody saw them. Murrow presents the story to CBS News' director, Sig Mickelson, who warns Murrow that the story will bring serious accusations and repercussions to [[CBS]] and their sponsors, some of whom have government contracts. He reluctantly allows the story to air, which gains positive responses from the public. Murrow also tries to ease the worries of his colleague, [[Don Hollenbeck]], who is struggling with both the strain of his recent divorce and attacks from newspaper writer [[Jack O'Brian]], who is accusing him of being biased in his news reporting and being a \"[[pinko]]\".\n\nWhile covering a story in Washington DC, Wershba is given an envelope suggesting that Murrow has previously interacted with the Soviets and used to be on their payroll. CBS's Chief Executive, [[William S. Paley|William Paley]], brings this up with Murrow. He warns Murrow that if any members of his staff are associated with Communism in any way, however remotely, they would have to recuse themselves from Murrow's next story. They were planning to make a direct attack on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] and [[McCarthyism|his crusade]] against Communist infiltration in the U.S. government, which some denounce as a witch hunt. Friendly and Murrow gather their staff together, and when one of the team members voluntarily excuses himself because his ex-wife had attended Communist meetings before they even met, Murrow concludes that this kind of fear is what McCarthy wants. The team stays together and presents the story, which becomes highly praised by the public and the press, with the exception of Jack O'Brian, who continues to attack both Murrow and especially Hollenbeck on their supposed support of Communism. Hollenbeck pleads with Murrow to go after O'Brian, but Murrow reluctantly tells him that he cannot attack O'Brian while he is busy going after McCarthy.\n\nAs the team turns their focus to a filmed hearing of [[Annie Lee Moss]], a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] communication worker accused of being a Communist based on her name appearing on a list seen by an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] infiltrator of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], they receive the news that Milo Radulovich is being reinstated by the Air Force, citing no direct evidence supporting any connections with Communism. McCarthy then asks for the opportunity to speak for himself on Murrow's show, which Murrow allows. McCarthy openly accuses Murrow of being a Communist, citing several pieces of evidence that seem to support it. Murrow broadcasts a rebuttal the following week, easily disproving McCarthy's accusations and pointing out that McCarthy didn't do anything to defend himself other than accuse anyone who opposes him as being either a Communist or a Communist sympathizer.\n\nA few days later, the news arrives that the U.S. Senate is investigating McCarthy, which means the imminent end of his crusade. As the team celebrates, Friendly and Murrow learn that Hollenbeck has died by suicide. Paley then tells Murrow and Friendly that their news program's air time is going to be severely cut, citing the high costs of the show's production, along with Murrow's attacks on controversial topics. Also, Joe Wershba and his wife Shirley, who have been concealing their marriage due to CBS forbidding co-workers from being married, are approached by Mickelson, who tells them that everyone knows of their marriage and that he will allow one of them to resign to save face, which Joe agrees to do.\n\nThe film is [[Frame story|framed]] by performance of the speech given by Murrow to the [[Radio Television Digital News Association|Radio and Television News Directors Association]] at \"A Salute to Edward R. Murrow\" on October 25, 1958, in which he harshly admonishes his audience not to squander the potential of television to inform and educate the public, so that it does not become only \"wires and lights in a box\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Edward R.

To accomplish a pair of scenes showing characters going up an elevator, different \"floors\" of the building were laid out on the same level. The \"elevator\" was actually built on a large turntable at the intersection of the two floor sets, and rotated once the doors were closed. When the doors reopened, the actors appeared to be in a different location. In doing so, the movie exercised a bit of dramatic license\u2014the CBS executive offices at the time were located at 485 Madison Avenue.<ref>''Broadcasting Yearbook 1952'', page 448</ref> [[CBS News]] was located in an office building just north of [[Grand Central Terminal]] (demolished and now the site of the [[MetLife Building]]);<ref>Kuralt, Charles, ''A Life on the Road'', 1991</ref> and the ''[[See It Now]]'' studio was located in [[Grand Central Terminal]] itself, above the waiting room.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schwartz |first=David |title=Studio Originations for CBS New York based shows, December 2\u20133, 2001 |url=http://www.cbsretirees.com/dec2a.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://archive.today/2013.01.18-230954/http://www.cbsretirees.com/dec2a.htm |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |access-date=February 2, 2016 |website=Retired CBS Engineers Association}}</ref> For dramatic effect, all three areas were depicted as being in the same building.\n\nClooney and producer Grant Heslov decided to use only archival footage of Joseph McCarthy in his depiction. As all of that footage was black-and-white, that determined the color scheme of the film.<ref name=Brooks/> A young [[Robert F. Kennedy]] is also shown in the movie during McCarthy's hearing sessions. He was then a staff member on the Senate subcommittee chaired by McCarthy.\n\n==Music==\nA small jazz combo starring jazz singer [[Dianne Reeves]] was hired to record the soundtrack to the movie. This combo ([[Peter Martin (jazz pianist)|Peter Martin]], Christoph Luty, [[Jeff Hamilton (drummer)|Jeff Hamilton]] and Matt Catingub) was featured in the movie in several scenes; for example, in one scene the newsmen pass a studio where she is recording with the rest of the band.

Furthermore, Shafer writes, evidence obtained via the declassified [[Venona project|Venona]] espionage program confirmed that many Soviet agents and sympathizers were in fact in positions of influence in the U.S. government, a disclosure the film entirely overlooks: \"Clooney and company ignore the material that might argue against their simple-minded thesis about Murrow, the era, and the press to produce an [[after school special]]\".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Shafer |first=Jack |author-link=Jack Shafer |date=October 5, 2005 |title=Edward R.
