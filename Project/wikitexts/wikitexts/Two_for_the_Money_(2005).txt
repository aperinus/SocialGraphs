J. Caruso]] and starring [[Al Pacino]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Armand Assante]], and [[Carly Pope]]. The film is about the world of [[gambling|sports gambling]]. It was released on October 7, 2005. This was the first [[Morgan Creek Entertainment|Morgan Creek]] movie distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] since ''[[Coupe de Ville (film)|Coupe de Ville]]'' in 1990.\n\n==Plot==\nBrandon Lang is a former college [[American football|football]] star who, after sustaining a career-ending injury, takes a job [[handicapping]] football games. His success at choosing winners catches the eye of Walter Abrams, the slick head of one of the biggest sports consulting operations in the United States. Walter takes Brandon under his wing, and soon they are making tremendous amounts of money.\n\nLang's in-depth knowledge of the game, leagues, and players brings in big winnings and bigger clients. Abrams's cable television show, ''The Sports Advisors'', skyrockets in popularity when he adds Lang's slick \"John Anthony\" persona to the desk, infuriating Jerry Sykes, who up to now has been Walter's in-house expert. Lang's total image is remade with a new car, new wardrobe, and a new look, with the assistance of Walter's wife, Toni, a hair stylist.\n\nThings suddenly go south, however, when Lang begins playing his hunches instead of doing his homework. He loses his touch and is even physically assaulted by the thugs of a gambler who lost a great deal of money following Lang's advice. Abrams and Lang's once-solid relationship sours.\n\nLang's new high-rolling lifestyle depends entirely on his ability to predict the outcomes of the games. Millions are at stake by the time he places his last bet, and Abrams, a recovering [[gambling addiction|gambling addict]] and alcoholic, grows increasingly unstable. He secretly begins gambling all of his own money on Lang's picks and becomes suspicious that Lang is having an affair with his wife.\n\nThe film concludes with Lang's predictions coming true for the last game, both of which he allegedly determines by flipping coins in a bathroom, as he leaves [[New York City|New York]] and takes a job as [[coach (sport)|coach]] of a junior league football team.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Al Pacino]] as Walter Abrams <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barstoolsports.com/podcast/2997884/pmt-10-21-matthew-mcconaughey-nfl-power-rankings-and-the-cowboys-disaster|title=PMT 10-21: Matthew McConaughey, NFL Power Rankings And The Cowboys Disaste|publisher=Barstool Sports|date=October 21, 2020|accessdate=March 10, 2021}}</ref>\n*[[Matthew McConaughey]] as Brandon Lang\n*[[Rene Russo]] as Toni Abrams\n*[[Armand Assante]] as C.M.
