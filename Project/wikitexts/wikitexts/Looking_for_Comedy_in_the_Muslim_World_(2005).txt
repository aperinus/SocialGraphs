O.|date=January 20, 2006}}</ref> It was shown at the [[Dubai International Film Festival]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Albert Brooks]], a [[Jewish-American]] [[comedian]], is asked by the [[United States]] government to travel to [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] to find out \"what makes [[Muslim]]s laugh.\"  References are made to Brooks's earlier films, including ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Lost In America]]'' and ''[[Defending Your Life]]'', along with his earlier stand-up comedy material.\n\nUpon reaching India, Brooks begins interviewing [[Indian people|Indians]] and gathering material for the 500-page essay expected of him from the government. He is aided by two agents (who actually help very little) and an Indian woman named Maya ([[Sheetal Sheth]]), who was hired as his assistant.\n\nBrooks' interviews and a failed stand-up performance begin to attract the attention of the Indian government, who fear he is a spy of some sort. Unable to get a visa, Brooks illegally enters Pakistan for four hours to interview several fledgling Pakistani comedians, the Indian government becomes even more paranoid, increasing border control. This action causes alarm to Pakistan, who responds with security measures of their own.\n\nAs tension between the countries grows, the American government orders Brooks to leave the country and return to America. It is later said that the tension between Pakistan and India is resolved after they learn that everything was Brooks' fault. It is also revealed that Maya sent what was written of the report to Washington, but it received no recognition.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Himself\n* [[Amy Ryan]] as Emily\n* [[Sheetal Sheth]] as Maya\n* [[Fred Dalton Thompson]] as Himself\n* [[Penny Marshall]] as Herself\n* [[Marco Khan]] as Pakistani Comedian\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. According to [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it holds a 42% rating based on one hundred-nine reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Although the premise seems ripe for laughs, Albert Brooks isn't ruthless or clever enough to pull it off.\"<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/looking_for_comedy_in_the_muslim_world/ Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It opened in [[limited release]] (in only 161 theatres).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433116/business Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World (2005) - Box office / business<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, some critics appreciated Brooks's sly satire. As [[Nathan Rabin]] wrote in ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', \"''Looking'' succeeds smashingly both as a comedy and as a savvy deconstruction of comedy. It's equally concerned with getting laughs and exploring how culture and language affect the way people process humor.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/looking-for-comedy-in-the-muslim-world-1798201408|first=Nathan|last=Rabin|title=Looking For Comedy In The Muslim World|date=January 8, 2006|accessdate=January 15, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Humour in Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0433116|title=Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World}}\n* {{amg title|id=331951|title=Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World}}\n\n{{Albert Brooks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Looking For Comedy In The Muslim World}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2005 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:American political satire films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Albert Brooks]]\n[[Category:Warner Independent Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Shangri-La Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Albert Brooks]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Michael Giacchino]]\n[[Category:Islamic comedy and humor]]\n[[Category:Films about actors]]\n[[Category:Films about Islam]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
