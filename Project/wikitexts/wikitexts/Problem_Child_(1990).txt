It stars [[John Ritter]], [[Michael Oliver (actor)|Michael Oliver]], [[Jack Warden]], [[Gilbert Gottfried]], [[Amy Yasbeck]], and [[Michael Richards]]. It was released on July 27, 1990.\n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing $72.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $10 million.\n\nIt was followed by two sequels, ''[[Problem Child 2]]'' (1991) and the [[Made for TV]] ''[[Problem Child 3: Junior in Love]]'' (1995).\n\n==Plot==\nBen Healy is a pleasant but brow-beaten yuppie working for his father \"Big Ben\", a tyrannical sporting goods dealer running for mayor. Ben would love to have a son, but his obnoxious wife Flo has been unable to conceive. Ben approaches less-than-scrupulous adoption agent Igor Peabody with his dilemma, and Peabody presents Ben and Flo with a cute 7-year-old boy, Junior. \n\nHowever, Junior is hardly a model child; mean-spirited and incorrigible, the child leaves a path of serious destruction in his wake, and is even pen pals with Martin Beck, a notorious serial killer. The cat ends up in the hospital, Big Ben ends up falling down the stairs, and the house catches on fire. He messes up a camping trip with the neighbors by urinating in the fire, and manipulating a practical joke played on the kids by their father. He then terrorizes his neighbor's birthday party, after Lucy, the snobby birthday girl, bans him from the magic show. Finally, Junior displays his method for winning in Little League, which involves hitting rival players in the crotch with a baseball bat. Ben is having serious doubts about Junior, and takes him back to the orphanage. However, upon hearing he was returned to the orphanage thirty times by previous adoptive families, he decides to keep him and love him, something no one has ever done. Distraught that his parents do not love him, Junior retaliates by driving Ben's car into his father's store, and his bank account is wiped out to pay for the damages. Ben is on the verge of cracking until Beck arrives at the house, and decides to kidnap his faithful correspondent, along with Flo. \n\nWhile Ben first sees this as good riddance to his browbeating wife and the trouble making Junior, he soon notices signs that Junior is not the monster he appeared; through a series of pictures Junior drew, he depicts children and adults who treated him poorly as deformed monsters with hostile surroundings, but depicted Ben as a person in a pleasant background, revealing that he did value him as a father figure. Ben, realizing that Junior's behavior was simply a reaction to how he himself was treated as a child, undertakes a rescue mission to get Junior back from Beck.\n\nNow exerting a more assertive attitude, Ben first steals his neighbor's car and hat, and confronts his father for money. When he is rudely dismissed, Ben pushes a button that puts Big Ben unknowingly on camera, where he ends up revealing his true nature on the news, even [[mooning]] the camera.\n\nBen catches up with Beck and Junior at the circus. Junior is rescued after escaping from Beck through a [[trapeze]] act. Beck drives away, but the Healys are now on his tail. After a collision, Flo, who was stuffed in a suitcase, flies over the wall and ends up in the back of a truck loaded with pigs. Beck is arrested, but not before getting a shot off, which hits Ben in the chest. Thinking he has died, Junior apologizes and tells him he loves him. Ben wakes up and realizes the bullet ricocheted off his good-luck prune he was holding in his pocket. Junior then removes his bow tie and throws it over the bridge, as a symbol perhaps that he has changed his ways, and then walks away together with his new father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Ritter]] as Benjamin \"Ben\" Healy Jr.\n* [[Michael Oliver (actor)|Michael Oliver]] as Junior Healy\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Benjamin \"Big Ben\" Healy Sr., Ben's wealthy, mean, and selfish father who holds contempt for his son's kindness and considerate personality.\n* [[Gilbert Gottfried]] as Igor Peabody, the adoption agent at the orphanage who is Junior's nemesis and wants Junior out of the orphanage and out of his life.  \n* [[Amy Yasbeck]] as Florence \"Flo\" Healy, Ben's social-climbing wife who cares far more about the image of being a wife and mother rather than the actual responsibilities or morals.\n* [[Michael Richards]] as Martin Beck, an escaped convict who goes by the moniker \"Bow-Tie Killer\".\n* [[Peter Jurasik]] as Roy, Ben and Flo's neighbor who is rather brash and arrogant.\n* Colby Kline as Lucy Henderson, a mean and spoiled brat whose personality spurs Junior into ruining her 6th birthday party.\n* [[Dennis Dugan]] (''cameo'') as All American Dad.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot on location in [[Texas]], from October 2 to November 24, 1989. The primary locations were [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Farmers Branch, Texas|Farmers Branch]], [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Irving, Texas|Irving]], and [[Mesquite, Texas|Mesquite]]. Also, there were two weeks of reshoots in Dallas (see below) in March 1990.<ref>Daily Variety Magazine; February 26, 1990 Issue; Page 2</ref>\n\n[[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Rick Moranis]] and [[Kurt Russell]] were considered for the role of Little Ben before it was turned over to [[John Ritter]]. The part of Martin \"The Bow-Tie Killer\" Beck was originally offered to [[Christopher Lloyd]], who turned it down because of his commitments with ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'', released two months before ''Problem Child'', and was replaced by [[Michael Richards]]; this was the second role, following ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989), that Lloyd had turned down only to be taken by Richards.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/article/we-got-it-all-uhf-oral-history-weird-al-yankovics--215579 | title = We got it all on UHF: An oral history of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's cult classic | first= Sean | last = O'Neil | date = March 23, 2015 | access-date = January 6, 2019 | publisher = [[The A.V.

However, the studio insisted upon turning it into a children's film, a conversion that necessitated numerous reshoots and rewrites, leading to a difficult production that left all involved disappointed and anticipating a box office failure. It defied these expectations, becoming a surprise hit and Universal's most profitable film of 1990 but was still so embarrassing for Alexander and Karaszewski (Alexander even cried after the cast and crew screening) that they tried to distance themselves from it, which proved difficult. Studios were initially reluctant to hire them or take them seriously based on their work on such a prominent disreputable film but, as the years went by, they would eventually come to work with executives who were children when it first came out, and grew up watching its frequent TV airings, and were excited to be meeting its writers. Looking back, they still feel it's \"a mess\" but take some pride in being involved with one of the \"very few [PG-rated] children's films ''that'' black and ''that'' crazy\", citing the scene where Flo commits adultery with Martin while Ben is catatonic and contemplating murdering Junior in the next room as an example. They added, \"And it's funny\".<ref name=\"sideshow network.tv\"/>\n\nIn 2015, [[Dennis Dugan]] revealed that he was hired to direct the film, his first feature one (he'd previously directed episodes of the TV series ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]'', ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]'', and ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]''), after jumping on a coffee table in a meeting with Universal executives: \"You're looking at me like I'm fucking nuts, and this is what we want. We want this kind of chaos\". Dugan suggested [[John Ritter]], with whom he'd worked as an actor before turning to direct, for the role of Ben Healy. The studio was initially reluctant, feeling they needed a more famous actor, but eventually relented. Jack Warden turned down the role of \"Big Ben\" Healy before Dugan offered him half of his [[net profit|net points]]; he was so touched that he took the part, although he refused Dugan's offer. [[Amy Yasbeck]] was cast as Flo; she and Ritter fell in love during production, eventually marrying in 1999. Ritter died in 2003. Both Ritter and [[Gilbert Gottfried]] were allowed to [[ad lib]] while filming, but Universal reprimanded Dugan for shooting too much footage of the latter. The film's first test screening was disastrous, with 70 percent of the audience walking out, verbal complaints from viewers, and a score of only 30. The studio forced two weeks of reshoots, including a retooled ending and the addition of key scenes, such as Lucy's birthday party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/problem-child-turns-25-director-811146 |title='Problem Child' Turns 25: Director on John Ritter Ad-Libs, Test Audience Walkouts |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2015-07-26 |access-date=2016-05-12}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nA soundtrack was released by Universal the same day as the film, and included an original composition by [[The Beach Boys]].\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Track listing\n| extra_column = Artist(s)\n| title1   = Bad To The Bone\n| extra1   = [[George Thorogood]]\n| length1  = 4:57\n| title2   = Real Wild Child\n| extra2   = [[Iggy Pop]]\n| length2  = 3:39\n| title3   = It's My Party\n| extra3   = [[Lesley Gore]]\n| length3  = 2:20\n| title4   = Born To Be Wild\n| extra4   = [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]]\n| length4  = 3:33\n| title5   = [[Problem Child (The Beach Boys song)|Problem Child]]\n| extra5   = The Beach Boys\n| length5  = 4:38\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at third place.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Ghost' Hovers Behind No. 1 'Presumed Innocent' : WEEKEND BOX OFFICE  |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-07-31|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-31/entertainment/ca-1251_1_weekend-ticket-sales|access-date=2011-01-13}}</ref> It went on to be a commercial success at the box office, grossing $54 million domestically and $72 million worldwide.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received negative reviews upon its release.

The first one brought back the original cast in their original roles and picked up where the first film ended. However, Yasbeck was given a new role with a new dynamic opposite to her original character. In the third and final film, [[William Katt]] and Justin Chapman replaced John Ritter and Michael Oliver as Ben and Junior respectively, while Gottfried and Warden reprised their roles as Igor Peabody and Big Ben and does not follow the storyline of the first two films.\n\n===Television series===\n{{Main|Problem Child (TV series)}}\nThe film was adapted into an [[Animation|animated]] television series that aired on [[USA Network]] for two seasons, from October 31, 1993, to December 4, 1994.
