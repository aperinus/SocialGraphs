The movie stars [[Patrick Swayze]] and [[Halle Berry]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSiblings Kelly and Eddie Charles eagerly await alongside journalist Kathleen Mercer the release of their father Jack Charles from prison. \n\nFifteen months earlier, Kelly escapes from the corrupt state-run home in [[Los Angeles|LA]] Bigelow Hall by breaking a window and fleeing in the night. Jack is a petty criminal facing prison time. He robbed drug dealers until he robbed an uncover cop posing as one. He's also waiting for a large deal to come in. With their mother dead, the kids were left in the foster system. \n\nKelly finds Jack when she\u2019s out, telling him that her 7-year-old brother Eddie is about to be placed in Bigelow Hall. She describes to him their abusive treatment, including putting them in handcuffs. \n\nAfter witnessing director Lazzaro lying to the court at Eddie\u2019s custody hearing, Jack sees the kids are put in shackles and takes matters into his own hands. He hijacks the bus taking Eddie to Bigelow and breaks him out. \n\nIntending to dump the kids with their grifter grandmother Rita in [[Las Vegas|Vegas]], Jack can\u2019t do so as their case has made national news. Besides, she later reminds him that as they are his kids are his responsibility. Reporter Mercer has published an article full of lies, making him seem dangerous. \n\nSo, he calls her for her flawed reporting but she's actually investigating the Hall for fraud. Mercer asks him to find out if the kids really goes on the field trips the director claims they do or get meat regularly. \n\nThe three start off on an adventure across country, all the while Jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids. On the way there, he starts to fall in love with them. Eddie insists they stop to see the [[Hoover Dam]], where they are spotted. Jack creates a distraction so they can sneak off in a hot-wired car. On the road, they head through Texas, bound for [[New Orleans]]. There he plans to pull off a big heist that could set them up for life.\n\nIn the meantime, Mercer tries to track down Dolores, Kelly\u2019s pregnant friend from Bigelow Hall. But Mrs. Carter who had been her foster mother would\u2019ve adopted her, tells her they recaptured her. \n\nWhen Jack has Kelly drive, she crashes the car, so they head out on foot. They stow away on a boat being towed to Louisiana. When it\u2019s lowered to the water, they race away. A police chopper and another news one catches up to them, but when a flare is accidentally set off in the boat the family jumps off as they can\u2019t be seen in the smoke. \n\nThey hitchhike the last 90 miles to New Orleans. There, Jack finds Jerry, his partner for the heist. He gets called by Mercer, offering him a reduced sentence of only two years (reduced to 18 months on good behavior) if he helps gets the truth out about the youth detention center and prosecute the home, which is molesting children and billing for trips with them that never really took place. Jack has to decide whether he should take the money and run or look out for his new found family's interests.\n\nThe next morning when Jack is looking for Kelly, Eddie tells him she\u2019s gone to meet with Andy, an intern at Bigelow who lives in New Orleans. She mistook his kindness for something more, and is heartbroken. \n\nThat night the kids stow away in the trunk of Jerry\u2019s car, as he and Jack have gotten on the almost empty ferry to Algiers to steal $250,000. The kids draw attention to the pair, the target is alerted, and Jerry is shot down but Jack and the kids aren\u2019t pursued. \n\nIn court, Jack and Kelly speak out against Bigelow director Lazzaro, helping in the prosecution of the Hall for fraud.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Jack Charles\n* [[Halle Berry]] as Kathleen Mercer\n* [[Sabrina Lloyd]] as Kelly Charles\n* [[Brian Bonsall]] as Eddie Charles\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as Jerry\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Rita\n* [[Bob Gunton]] as Lazzaro\n* [[Adrienne Barbeau]] as Celeste\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Andy\n\n== Locations ==\n''Father Hood'' was shot in [[Los Angeles]], California, [[Hoover Dam]], Arizona-Nevada Border, [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, [[Rio Medina]], Texas, and [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.\n\n== Release ==\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film was released in North America on August 27, 1993 to generally unfavorable reviews from critics.
