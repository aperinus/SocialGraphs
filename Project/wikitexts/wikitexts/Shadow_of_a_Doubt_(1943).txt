One day, his landlady tells him that two men came looking for him; he sees the two men waiting on the street in front of his room, and he decides to leave town.\n\nCharlotte \"Charlie\" Newton is a bored teenage girl living in the idyllic town of [[Santa Rosa, California]]. She receives wonderful news: Her mother's younger brother (her eponym), Charles Oakley, is arriving for a visit. Her uncle arrives, and at first, everyone is delighted with his visit, especially young Charlie. Uncle Charlie brings everyone presents. He gives his niece an emerald ring that has someone else's initials engraved inside. Charlie's father, Joseph Newton, works at a bank, and Uncle Charlie tells him he wants to open an account and deposit $40,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.040000|1943|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) at his bank.\n\nTwo men appear at the Newton home, posing as interviewers working on a national survey. Uncle Charlie is upset and berates his sister for opening up her home to strangers. One of the men takes a photo of Uncle Charlie, who demands the film roll because he wants to avoid having his photo taken at any cost. The younger interviewer, Jack Graham, asks out young Charlie, and she guesses that he is really a detective. He explains that her uncle is one of two suspects who may be the \"Merry Widow Murderer\". Charlie refuses to believe it at first but then observes Uncle Charlie acting strangely, primarily with a news clipping from her father's newspaper that describes a murder. The initials engraved inside the ring he gave her match those of one of the murdered women, and during a family dinner, he reveals his hatred of rich widows.\n\nOne night, when Charlie's father and his friend Herbie discuss how to commit the [[Perfect murder (fiction)|perfect murder]], Uncle Charlie lets his guard down and describes elderly widows as \"fat, wheezing animals\"; he then says, \"What happens to animals when they get too fat and too old?\" Horrified, Charlie runs out. Uncle Charlie follows and takes her into a seedy bar. He admits he is one of the two suspects. He begs her for help; she reluctantly agrees not to say anything, as long as he leaves soon to avoid a horrible confrontation that would destroy her mother, who idolizes her younger brother. Detective Fred Saunders, Jack Graham's older colleague, tells Charlie that the photo they took of Uncle Charlie was sent for identification by witnesses. News breaks that an alternative suspect was chased by police and killed by an airplane propeller; it is assumed that he was the murderer. Jack tells young Charlie that he loves her and would like to marry her, and leaves.\n\n[[File:Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten in Shadow of a Doubt trailer.png|thumb|left|267px|Uncle Charlie ([[Joseph Cotten]]) confronts his niece ([[Teresa Wright]]) in a seedy bar about what she knows.]]\n\nUncle Charlie is delighted to be exonerated, but young Charlie knows all his secrets. Soon, she falls down dangerously steep stairs, which she later notices were cut through. Uncle Charlie says he wants to settle down, and young Charlie says she will kill him if he stays. Later that night, she is prodded by Uncle Charlie to get the car from the garage. The engine was left running, and the garage is full of exhaust fumes. She tries to turn the engine off, but the key is not in the ignition, and when she tries to leave, she finds the garage door jammed, and she is trapped in the garage. Mr. Newton's friend Herbie comes by and hears Charlie banging on the garage door and gets her out in time.\n\nUncle Charlie announces he is leaving for San Francisco, along with a rich widow, Mrs. Potter. At the train station, young Charlie boards the train with her younger sister Ann and their brother to see Uncle Charlie's compartment. Uncle Charlie restrains his niece Charlie on the train as the children disembark, hoping to kill her by shoving her out after it picks up speed. However, in the ensuing struggle, he falls in front of an oncoming train. At his funeral, Uncle Charlie is honored by the townspeople. Jack has returned, and Charlie confesses that she withheld crucial information. They resolve to keep Uncle Charlie's crimes a secret.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Teresa-Wright-1942-1.jpg|thumb|237px|Promotional portrait of Teresa Wright for ''Shadow of a Doubt'', the film for which she received her first top billing.]]\n\n* [[Teresa Wright]] as Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton, a precocious teenager who initially idolizes her loving uncle.\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Charles \"Uncle Charlie\" Oakley\n* [[Macdonald Carey]] as Detective Jack Graham\n* [[Henry Travers]] as Joseph Newton, Young Charlie's father, who loves to read crime stories.\n* [[Patricia Collinge]] as Emma Newton, Young Charlie's mother and Uncle Charlie's sister.\n* [[Wallace Ford]] as Detective Fred Saunders\n* [[Hume Cronyn]] as Herbie Hawkins, a neighbor and [[crime fiction]] buff.

Charlie is traveling on the train under the assumed name of Otis, and is lying down due to a [[migraine]]. Mrs. Harry is eager to help him, but her husband is not interested and keeps playing bridge. Doctor Harry replies to Hitchcock that he doesn't look well while Hitchcock is holding a full suit of spades, the best hand for bridge.\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 250\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Santa Rosa Depot, Railroad Square District, Santa Rosa, CA 6-12-2010 8-16-39 PM.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Santa Rosa railroad depot in 2010\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Santa-Rosa-Library.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = 1905 postcard of the Santa Rosa library\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe project began when the head of David Selznick's story department, Margaret McDonell, told Hitchcock that her husband Gordon had an interesting idea for a novel that she thought would make a good movie. His idea, called \"Uncle Charlie\", was based on the true story of [[Earle Nelson]], a serial killer of the late 1920s known as \"the Gorilla Man\".\n\n''Shadow of a Doubt'' was both filmed and set in [[Santa Rosa, California]], which was portrayed as a paragon of a supposedly peaceful, small, pre-[[World War II|War]] American city. Since Thornton Wilder wrote the original script, the story is set in a small American town, a popular setting of Wilder's, but with an added Hitchcock touch to it. In Patrick McGilligan's biography of Hitchcock, he said the film was perhaps the most American film that Hitchcock had made up to that time.\n\nThe opening scenes take place in the [[List of neighborhoods in Newark, New Jersey|East Ward]] (aka the \"Ironbound\"/\"Down Neck\" section of [[Newark, New Jersey]]). The city skyline and landmarks such as the [[Pulaski Skyway]] are featured in the opening shot. The location shots were used to comply with the wartime [[War Production Board]] restrictions of a maximum cost of $5,000 for set construction.<ref name=\"life19430125\">{{Cite magazine |date=1943-01-25 |title=$5,000 Production |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1EEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70 |magazine=Life |pages=70\u201378}}</ref>\n\nThe Newton family home is located at 904 McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa, which is still standing. The stone railway station in the film was built in 1904 for the [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]] and is one of the few commercial buildings in central Santa Rosa to survive the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake of April 18, 1906]]. The station is currently a visitor center. The library was a [[Carnegie Library]] which was demolished in 1964 due to seismic concerns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sonomalibrary.org/blogs/history/santa-rosas-carnegie-library|title=Santa Rosa's Carnegie Library|website=sonomalibrary.org|access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> Some of the buildings in the center of Santa Rosa that are seen in the film were damaged or destroyed by [[1969 Santa Rosa earthquakes|earthquakes in 1969]]; much of the area was cleared of debris and largely rebuilt.\n\nThe film was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin, his first collaboration with Hitchcock (the others being ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'', ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' and ''[[Dial M for Murder]]''). In his score, Tiomkin quotes the ''[[The Merry Widow|Merry Widow Waltz]]'' of [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]], often in somewhat distorted forms, as a [[leitmotif]] for Uncle Charlie and his serial murders. During the opening credits, the waltz theme is heard along with a prolonged shot of couples dancing.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Shadow of a Doubt (1942 poster - Style D).jpg|thumb|Alternate \"Style{{nbsp}}D\" theatrical release poster]]\nUpon release, the film received unanimously positive reviews.

The publication predicted big \u201c[[box office]]\u201d for theaters presenting Hitchcock's latest work, although in its detailed review of ''Shadow of a Doubt'' the paper does mistakenly refer to the director's 1941 film ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' as \"'Suspense'\":{{blockquote|Of all the startling feature films directed by Alfred Hitchcock\u2014superman of suspense and wizard of mystery\u2014this one is geared most highly to thrill American audiences and to pour coin into the [[Safe|coffers]] of U.S. theaters....There are no [[red herring]]s yanked across the trail in this attraction, as was the case in his recent hit, \"Suspense\".
