The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Marie Dressler]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Lee Tracy]], [[Edmund Lowe]], and [[Billie Burke]].\n\n''Dinner at Eight'' continues to be acclaimed by critics; review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 90% based on 21 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dinner at Eight (1933)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1005875-dinner_at_eight|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=September 29, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nNew York City society matron Millicent Jordan is overjoyed when she receives word that Lord and Lady Ferncliffe, the richest couple in England, have accepted her invitation to her upcoming dinner party. However, her husband Oliver, a shipping magnate, finds Lord Ferncliffe a bore. Their daughter, Paula, is preoccupied with the impending return of her fianc\u00e9, Ernest DeGraff, from Europe.\n\nOliver asks Millicent to invite legendary stage actress Carlotta Vance, who has just arrived from Europe. A former lover of Oliver's, Carlotta confesses to him that she is nearly penniless and is interested in selling her stock in the Jordan Shipping Line, but he lacks the funds, as his business has been severely affected by the [[Great Depression]].\n\n''[[Nouveau riche]]'' magnate Dan Packard, a former miner, agrees to consider helping Oliver, but later brags to his young, gold-digger wife, Kitty, that he plans to take over the Jordan Shipping Line through crooked stock purchases. Oliver convinces Millicent to invite the Packards. While Kitty eagerly accepts the invitation, Dan refuses to go, but changes his mind when he learns that Lord Ferncliffe will be in attendance.\n\nOn the morning of her dinner, Millicent loses the \"extra man\" she found for Carlotta. She telephones Larry Renault, a washed-up silent film star, and extends a last-minute invitation, unaware that Paula is in his hotel room. Larry and Paula have been having an affair for a month, but he wants to end it, citing their age difference (he is 47 and she is 19) and the fact that he is a three-time divorc\u00e9. Paula insists that she loves him, planning to tell her family and Ernest about their affair. Carlotta, who is staying in the same hotel, sees Paula leave Larry's room.\n\nLarry, a hardened alcoholic, is on the brink of physical and economic collapse. His agent, Max Kane, tells him that the stage play he was set to star in has a new producer, Jo Stengel. Stengel decided to cast another actor in the lead role, but is willing to consider Larry in a [[bit part]].\n\nThe Jordans' physician and friend Dr. Wayne Talbot has been having an affair with Kitty on the pretext of tending to her feigned illnesses. On the day of the dinner, his wife, Lucy, catches him in a compromising telephone call with Kitty. Talbot admits that he is a serial adulterer and vows to overcome his impulses. Lucy is surprisingly understanding, and the two kiss. Talbot receives a visit from an ailing Oliver, who is diagnosed with terminal [[Coronary thrombosis|thrombosis]] of the [[coronary arteries]]. At home, Oliver tries to tell Millicent that he needs to rest, but she is too hysterical to pay attention to him because, among several domestic disasters, the Ferncliffes have canceled.\n\nDuring a vicious fight, Kitty spitefully reveals to Dan that she is having an affair. When threatened with divorce, she demands that he back down from his takeover of the Jordan Line and treat her with more respect, or else she will sabotage his potential [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] appointment by exposing his crooked deals. Defeated, Dan storms off.\n\nBefore he leaves for the dinner, Larry is visited by Max and Stengel. Upon discovering that the role being offered to him is that of a dead man, Larry drunkenly insults Stengel, who leaves in haste. Frustrated, Max forces Larry to face reality by bluntly asserting that he has no future in show business, before leaving. To make matters worse, the hotel manager tells Larry he has until the next day to leave. Larry, in utter despair, commits suicide by turning on his gas fireplace.\n\nThe dinner guests arrive at the Jordans' mansion. Carlotta informs Paula that Larry has killed himself, consoling the young woman as she breaks down in tears. Millicent learns about Oliver's health and financial setbacks. Realizing her own selfishness, Millicent tells Oliver that she is willing to adopt a more frugal lifestyle. As the guests are about to go in to dinner, Kitty pressures Dan to tell Oliver that he has saved the Jordan Line.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Dinner at Eight lobby card.jpg|thumb|Lobby card]]\n[[File:Jean-Harlow-1935.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean Harlow]] as Kitty Packard in ''Dinner at Eight'']]\n* [[Marie Dressler]] as  Carlotta Vance\n* [[John Barrymore]] as Larry Renault\n* [[Wallace Beery]] as Dan Packard\n* [[Jean Harlow]] as Kitty Packard, Dan's wife\n* [[Lionel Barrymore]] as Oliver Jordan\n* [[Billie Burke]] as Millicent Jordan, Oliver's wife\n* [[Lee Tracy]] as Max Kane, Larry Renault's agent\n* [[Edmund Lowe]] as Dr. Wayne Talbot\n* [[Madge Evans]] as Paula Jordan, the Jordans' daughter\n* [[Jean Hersholt]] as Jo Stengel, a theatrical producer\n* [[Karen Morley]] as Lucy Talbot, Wayne Talbot's wife\n* [[Louise Closser Hale]], as Hattie Loomis, Millie's cousin \n* [[Phillips Holmes]] as Ernest DeGraff, Paula Jordan's fianc\u00e9\n* [[May Robson]] as Mrs. Wendel, the Jordans' cook\n'''The cast also includes'''\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Grant Mitchell (actor)|Grant Mitchell]], as Ed Loomis, Hattie's husband\n* [[Phoebe Foster]] as Miss Alden\n* [[Elizabeth Patterson (actress)|Elizabeth Patterson]] as Miss Copeland\n* [[Hilda Vaughn]] as Tina, Kitty's maid\n* [[Harry Beresford]] as Fosdick\n* [[Edwin Maxwell (actor)|Edwin Maxwell]] as Mr. Fitch, hotel manager\n* [[John Davidson (actor)|John Davidson]] as Mr. Hatfield\n* [[Edward Woods]] as Eddie\n* [[Isadorables|Anna Duncan]] as Dora\n* [[Herman Bing]] as the waiter\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nTCM.com says that the character of Carlotta was inspired by the popular stage and silent film actress [[Maxine Elliott]], citing the March 13, 1940, obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/12530/dinner-at-eight#notes|title=Dinner at Eight (1934) \u2013 Notes|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=October 30, 2022}}</ref>\n\nMarie Dressler died of cancer in July 1934, less than a year after ''Dinner at Eight'' was released.

Selznick'', Abacus, 1993 p 160.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, ''Dinner at Eight'' received very high marks from many leading reviewers. [[Mordaunt Hall]], the widely read critic for ''The New York Times'', admired the screenplay's thoughtful but \"fast-moving\" blend of drama and \"flip dialogue\", crediting the skillful adaptation of George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber's script from the stage production, which had opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the previous year. Hall also praised the performances of the film's star-studded cast, drawing special attention to the work of Marie Dressler, Billie Burke, John Barrymore, Wallace Beery, and Jean Harlow:{{blockquote|This Dinner at Eight has a cast of twenty-five, and among the players are most of the stellar lights of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, besides a few borrowed from other companies. It is one of those rare pictures which keeps you in your seat until the final fade-out, for nobody wants to miss one of the scintillating lines.\n\nIt is a fast-moving narrative with its humor and tragedy, one that offers a greater variety of characterizations than have been witnessed in any other picture...A strong line of drama courses through the story notwithstanding the flip dialogue. The picture runs along with a steady flow of unusually well-knit incidents, which are woven together most expertly toward the end. This is owing to the fine writing of Mr. Kaufman and Miss Ferber...Veteran players of the stage, who have since been won over to talking pictures, are the principal assets in this film. It is a great pleasure to behold Marie Dressler away from her usual roles, dressed in the height of fashion and given lines that aroused gales of mirth from the first-night audience...\n\nMiss Dressler is splendid as the wise Carlotta. Miss Burke's contribution to the story is all one could wish. She is the personification of an anxious hostess at one moment and subsequently a deeply disappointed woman. John Barrymore tackles his role with his usual artistry. His acting during Larry's last moments is most effective. Mr. Beery fits into the role of Dan Packard as though it were written especially for him and Miss Harlow makes the most of the part of Kitty.<ref>Hall, Mordaunt (1933).

It highlighted Dressler's role as well, although the influential entertainment trade [[Weekly newspaper|weekly]] focused its compliments chiefly on Harlow's portrayal of Kitty:{{blockquote|The story grips from beginning to end with never relaxing tension, its somber moments relieved by lighter touches into a fascinating mosaic for nearly two hours...Acting honors probably will go to Miss Dressler and Miss Harlow, the latter taking hold of her fat role and making it stand out, even in this distinguished company by the astonishingly well-balanced treatment of Kitty, the canny little [[wikt:Special:Search/Hussy|hussy]] who hooks a hard-bitten and unscrupulous millionaire and then makes him lay down and roll over.
