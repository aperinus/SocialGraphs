The plot is about a wealthy [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] who is stabbed by an ancient African dagger and turned into a [[vampire]]. Lee has said the film is about \"[h]uman beings who are addicted to blood\" and called it \"[a] new kind of love story.\"<ref>Wickman, Forrest.

''Slate''.</ref>  The film is a remake of the 1973 film ''[[Ganja & Hess]]'' (with original writer [[Bill Gunn (writer)|Bill Gunn]] receiving a credit as co-writer, along with Lee). It was the first of Lee's films to be funded through [[Kickstarter]].<ref name=\"KickStart\"/> The film was released on June 22, 2014 at the [[American Black Film Festival]] as the closing film,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2014/06/27/spike-lees-da-sweet-blood-of-jesus-closes-the-2014-american-black-film-festival/|title=Spike Lee's 'Da Sweet Blood Of Jesus' Closes The 2014 American Black Film Festival|work=The Source|date=June 28, 2014 |access-date=November 20, 2014}}</ref> and was released in theaters and on [[video on demand|VOD]] on February 14, 2015, by [[Gravitas Ventures]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with an unnamed dancer (Charles \"Lil Buck\" Riley) dancing in various locations around [[Brooklyn]] during the credit sequence.\n\nFrom there, the plot follows Dr. Hess Green ([[Stephen Tyrone Williams]]), a wealthy African-American [[anthropologist]] and art collector who acquires a dagger originating in the ancient [[Ashanti Empire]], a highly advanced civilization that, Green claims, became addicted to blood transfusions. That night, Lafayette Hightower ([[Elvis Nolasco]]), an emotionally unstable colleague from the museum which acquired the dagger, visits Green's impressive, African-art covered [[Martha's Vineyard]] mansion. The two cordially discuss history and philosophy, but once Green has retired for the evening, Hightower becomes drunk and climbs a tree with a noose, claiming he wants to commit [[suicide]]. Green successfully talks him down, but later that night Hightower attacks and stabs Green with the Ashanti ceremonial dagger, killing him. Sometime later, Green is shocked to awaken\u2014unscathed. He hears a gunshot and, upon discovering that Hightower has killed himself, he instinctively drinks Hightower's blood. He discovers that he is invulnerable to physical harm, can no longer tolerate normal food and drink, and has an insatiable need for more blood. Though he steals several bags of blood from a doctor's office, he quickly finds that he needs fresh victims. The first is a [[prostitute]] Lucky Mays ([[Felicia Pearson]]) who, shockingly, reawakens\u2014only after he has discovered that her blood is [[HIV-positive]]. After a period of tension, it is determined that he has not contracted the virus.\n\nSoon, Hightower's estranged ex-wife, Ganja Hightower ([[Zaraah Abrahams]]), arrives at Green's house searching for her ex-husband, who owes her money. Green and Ganja quickly become lovers, and she moves into Green's expansive mansion. He departs \"on business\" and kills Sahara Paysinger, a young woman with a baby (Jeni Perillo) whom he meets in a public park in Brooklyn. While Green is away, Ganja unwittingly discovers her ex-husband's corpse\u2014frozen in his wine cellar\u2014she is initially angry, but after Green explains what happened and tells her that he loves her, she agrees to marry him. On the honeymoon night, he stabs her with the Ashanti dagger so that she will share immortality with him. Ganja is initially horrified by her new existence, but Green teaches her how to survive. He brings home an old female acquaintance Tangier Chancellor (Nat\u00e9 Bova), for Ganja's first kill. Ganja seduces and then strangles Tangier. Ganja and Hess bury Tangier's body, even though, like Lucky from before, her \"corpse\" reawakens.\n\nGreen tells Ganja he is tired of this life and eventually visits a [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] church where he is moved by an energetic musical performance and approaches the altar to have the pastor lay hands on him. Meanwhile, back at home, Ganja murders Green's loyal domestic servant Seneschal Higginbottom ([[Rami Malek]]). When she searches for Green to confess, she finds him in the shadow of a cross, dying. Green dies in her arms, glad to be at peace. Ganja, though saddened by his death, lives on, presumably continuing her vampire-esque lifestyle. At the movie's closing, we see her walk out to the beach and gaze out into the water. Tangier appears, still naked, approaches her then turns and they stand side by side facing the horizon.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Zaraah Abrahams]] as Ganja Hightower\n*[[Stephen Tyrone Williams]] as Dr. Hess Greene\n*[[Rami Malek]] as Seneschal Higginbottom\n* [[Elvis Nolasco]] as Lafayette Hightower\n* [[Felicia Pearson]] as Lucky Mays\n* Jeni Perillo as Sahara Paysinger\n* Nat\u00e9 Bova as Tangier Chancellor\n* Katherine Borowitz as Ms. Staples\n* Charles \"Lil Buck\" Riley as Jookin' Dancer\n\n==Production==\nLee explained that he originally turned to [[Kickstarter]] to fund the film, \"...because I wanted to make this film but I knew no studio was going to make this film. It wasn't going to happen. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but I'm just a realist and I wasn't going to spend a year knocking on doors and stuff like that.\" He claims he did not know anything about crowdfunding projects prior to the development of the film. The project's original goal was to raise $1,250,000; ultimately it raised $1.4 million.<ref name=billboard>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6443496/spike-lee-interview-da-sweet-blood-of-jesus-soundtrack|title=Spike Lee on Finding '12 Gems' From Unsigned Artists for His Kickstarter-Funded Film|last=Lynch|first=Joe|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|billboard.com]]|date=January 15, 2015|access-date=July 22, 2015}}</ref> Lee confirmed that director [[Steven Soderbergh]] contributed $10,000 to get the film launched into production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/23/spike-lee-steven-soderbergh_n_3640794.html|title=Spike Lee: Steven Sodergergh Pledged $10,000 To Kickstarter|last=Rosen|first=Christopher|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=July 23, 2013|access-date=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the film's low budget, it was completed in only 16 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/its-a-wrap-spike-lees-kickstarter-project-da-blood-of-jesus-finishes-shooting|title=It's A Wrap: Spike Lee's Kickstarter Project, 'Da Blood of Jesus' Finishes Shooting|last=Bernstein|first=Paula|publisher=Indiewire|date=October 12, 2013|access-date=December 8, 2013}}</ref> It was filmed in [[Martha's Vineyard]] and in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3265082/spike-lees-scary-new-film-da-sweet-blood-of-jesus-is-already-shot/|title=Spike Lee's Scary New Film 'Da Sweet Blood of Jesus' Is Already Shot!|last=Dickson|first=Evan|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=November 15, 2013|access-date=December 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the soundtrack, Lee solicited music from unsigned, unknown artists via social media. Over 800 songs were submitted; Lee listened to all of them in a single weekend and eventually settled on 12 tracks by different unsigned artists (including singer-songwriter [[Siedah Garrett]], best known for her career as a songwriter and backup singer for major acts including [[Michael Jackson]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Donna Summer]]). \"I Don't Feel God\" was recorded by NJ artist The IZM., aka Anthony L. Peterson. For the Dana Hilliard song \"All Night,\" Lee and the producers added a horn section and [[Vernon Reid]] (of [[Living Colour]]) on guest guitar, but generally the songs were added to the movie unchanged.<ref name=billboard/> Two songs by Brazilian musician [[Milton Nascimento]] are also used. In addition to the soundtrack, [[Bruce Hornsby]] contributed an original score for the film which consists mainly of piano jazz.<ref name=variety/>\n\nAs a remake, the film remains extremely close to the original plot of ''[[Ganja and Hess]]'', \"at times scene for scene and shot for shot,\" according to writer Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref name=variety>Foundas, Scott.\"[https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-spike-lees-da-sweet-blood-of-jesus-1201242049/ Film Review: 'Da Sweet Blood of Jesus].'\" 23 June 2014. Variety.</ref> It uses so much of the original dialogue that original writer [[Bill Gunn (writer)|Bill Gunn]] (who died in 1989) is credited as a co-writer, along with Lee.\n\nThe opening credits note that the film is \"An Official Spike Lee Joint,\" a possible reference to the studio interference Lee experienced on his previous film\u2014[[Oldboy (2013 film)|his remake]] of the [[South Korea]]n revenge thriller ''[[Oldboy (2003 film)|Oldboy]]''\u2014which led to the credits of that film describing it as \"A Spike Lee Film\" instead of his customary \"A Spike Lee Joint.\"<ref name=variety/>\n\n==Release==\nA month prior to its theatrical release, the film was released through [[Vimeo]], an online video-streaming service. This unusual measure was partly inspired by Vimeo's comparatively low cut of the profits from online rentals and sales (10%, as opposed to other web services which can take up to 45%) and partially a strategy to generate interest in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13009453/1/spike-lee-turns-to-vimeo-to-distribute-his-latest-movie.html|title=Spike Lee Turns to Vimeo to Distribute His Latest Movie|last=Lazaroff|first=Leon|work=The Street|date=January 13, 2015 |access-date=July 22, 2015}}</ref>\nThe film was released theatrically and on VOD on February 13, 2015, by [[Gravitas Ventures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/gravitas-ventures-acquires-spike-lees-750330|title=Gravitas Ventures Acquires Spike Lee's 'Da Sweet Blood of Jesus'|author=Etan Vlessing|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 19, 2014 |access-date=November 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Da Sweet Blood of Jesus'' received mixed reviews from critics.

Scott]] also offered faint praise, writing, \"This is, all in all, one of Mr. Lee's cooler joints, meaning both that it is suavely stylish and feels detached from its own emotions and motivations. It's not especially horrifying, or even very thought-provoking. It is touching, however, because it represents one frequently misunderstood, intermittently great filmmaker's tribute to another.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Scott |first=A.O. |date=12 February 2015 |title=Review: 'Da Sweet Blood of Jesus,' Spike Lee's Vampire Movie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/movies/review-da-sweet-blood-of-jesus-spike-lees-vampire-movie.html?referrer=google_kp |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= [[New York City]] |access-date=22 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of black films of the 2010s]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|3104930}}\n\n{{Spike Lee}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sweet Blood Of Jesus, Da}}\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n[[Category:2014 comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2014 independent films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks films]]\n[[Category:African-American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American supernatural horror films]]\n[[Category:American vampire films]]\n[[Category:Comedy film remakes]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Spike Lee]]\n[[Category:Films set in Martha's Vineyard]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Martha's Vineyard]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Spike Lee]]\n[[Category:Horror film remakes]]\n[[Category:Kickstarter-funded films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:Romantic horror films]]\n[[Category:Supernatural comedy films]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]"}]}}}}
