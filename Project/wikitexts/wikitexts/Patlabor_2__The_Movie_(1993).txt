Isao Ota is a police academy Labor instructor. Mikiyasu Shinshi has since been reassigned as the Tokyo Metropolitan Police's head of General Affairs. Seitaro Sakaki has retired with Shigeo Shiba taking over his position as head of the labor maintenance team with Hiromi Yamazaki, Kiichi Goto and Shinobu Nagumo remaining with the unit as Kanuka Clancy had permanently returned to New York. Most of them had been replaced by fresh labor pilots.\n\nSuspicious events begin to materialize with the face of a military takeover of [[Tokyo]] by [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force|GSDF]] forces and [[martial law]]<ref name=\"review\"/> after the [[Yokohama Bay Bridge]] is destroyed by a missile,<ref name=\"Story\"/> with belief that the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|JASDF]] was the culprit. Protests in various [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|JSDF]] bases take place as a means of conveying their denial of the bridge attack. Before long, public panic comes as JGSDF-marked gunships attack in several bridges in [[Tokyo Bay]], various communication centers and SV2 headquarters, coupled by the release of a supposed deadly gas after [[Special Assault Team]] snipers shoot down an auto-piloted [[blimp]] that was responsible for [[Radio jamming|jamming]] all electronics in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]].\n\nGoto and Nagumo once more assemble the original Section 2 members in an abandoned subway passage as they embark on a secret operation to apprehend Yukihito Tsuge, a former GSDF officer who planned the terrorist attacks as a means of forcing the country to face its own military inadequacies after decades of peace. With the threat of military intervention by the [[United States Forces Japan]] looming unless the government controls the situation, the team uses an old stretch of the [[Ginza Line]] to approach an [[artificial island]] Tsuge uses as his hideout. Goto also takes care of things on his end by facilitating the arrest of Shigeki Arakawa, a GSDF intelligence agent who is actually one of Tsuge's former cohorts. After a fierce fight inside the artificial island's tunnel which results in flooding, the team evacuates the tunnel while Nagumo breaks through to finally arrest Tsuge.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"width:25%; text-align:center;\"| Character\n!  style=\"width:25%; text-align:center;\"| Original Japanese\n!  style=\"width:25%; text-align:center;\"| English (Manga UK)\n!  style=\"width:25%; text-align:center;\"| English (Bandai Visual)\n|-\n|Kiichi Goto || [[Ry\u016bsuke \u014cbayashi|Ryunosuke Ohbayashi]] || [[Peter Marinker]] || [[Roger Craig Smith]]\n|-\n|Shinobu Nagumo || [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]] || Sharon Holm || [[Megan Hollingshead]]\n|-\n|Shigeki Arakawa || [[Naoto Takenaka]] || Blair Fairman || [[Kim Strauss]]\n|-\n|Yukihito Tsuge || [[Jinpachi Nezu]] || Bob Sherman || [[Robert Clotworthy]]\n|-\n|Noa Izumi || [[Miina Tominaga]] || Briony Glassico || [[Julie Ann Taylor]]\n|-\n|Asuma Shinohara || [[Toshio Furukawa]] || [[David Jarvis (voice actor)|David Jarvis]] || [[Doug Erholtz]]\n|-\n|Isao Ohta || [[Michihiro Ikemizu]] || Martin McDougall || [[Sam Riegel]]\n|-\n|Mikiyasu Shinshi || [[Issei Futamata]] || Ron Lepaz || [[Joe Ochman]]\n|-\n|Hiromi Yamazaki || [[Daisuke Gouri]] || Michael Fitzpatrick || [[Jason C.
