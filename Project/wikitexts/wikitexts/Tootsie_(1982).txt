Its supporting cast includes Pollack, [[Jessica Lange]], [[Teri Garr]], [[Dabney Coleman]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Charles Durning]], [[George Gaynes]], [[Geena Davis]] (in her debut) and [[Doris Belack]]. The film tells the story of a talented but volatile actor whose reputation for being difficult drives him to adopt a new identity as a woman to land a job. The film was adapted by [[Larry Gelbart]], [[Barry Levinson]] (uncredited), [[Elaine May]] (uncredited) and [[Murray Schisgal]] from a story by Gelbart and [[Don McGuire (actor)|Don McGuire]].\n\n''Tootsie'' was a major critical and financial success, the second most profitable film of 1982, and was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Lange was the only winner, for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. In 1998, the [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Its theme song, \"[[It Might Be You]]\", performed by [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]], was a [[Top 40]] hit in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Dorsey is a respected actor, but nobody in New York City wants to hire him because he is a perfectionist and difficult to work with. He makes ends meet by working as a server in a restaurant and teaching acting classes. After many months without an acting job, Michael hears of an opening on the popular daytime [[soap opera]] ''Southwest General'' from his friend and acting student Sandy Lester, who tries out unsuccessfully for the role of hospital administrator Emily Kimberly. In desperation, and following an argument with his agent, Michael impersonates a woman, auditioning  as \"Dorothy Michaels\", and gets the hospital administrator part. Michael takes the job as a way to raise $8,000 to produce a play by his roommate Jeff Slater, which will star himself and Sandy. As \u201cDorothy\u201d, Michael plays Emily Kimberly as a feisty feminist, which surprises the other actors and the crew, who expected her to be (as written) another swooning female. His character quickly becomes a national sensation.\n\nWhen Sandy catches Michael in her bedroom half undressed because he wants to try on her clothes for ideas for Dorothy's wardrobe, he covers up by claiming he wants to have sex with her. Sandy is receptive and they sleep together. Exacerbating matters further, he is attracted to one of his co-stars, Julie Nichols, a single mother in an unhealthy relationship with the show's amoral, sexist director, Ron Carlisle. At a party, when Michael (as himself) approaches Julie with a pick-up line to which she had previously told Dorothy she would be receptive, she throws a drink in his face. Later, as Dorothy, when he makes tentative advances, Julie\u2014having just ended her relationship with Ron per Dorothy's advice\u2014makes it known that she is not a lesbian.\n\nMeanwhile, Dorothy has her own admirers to contend with: older cast member John Van Horn and Julie's widowed father, Les. Les proposes marriage, insisting that Dorothy think about it before answering. When Michael returns home, he finds John, who almost forces himself on Dorothy until Jeff walks in on them. A few minutes later, Sandy arrives, asking why he has not answered her calls. Michael admits he is in love with another woman, and Sandy screams and breaks up with him.\n\nThe tipping point comes when, due to Dorothy's popularity, the show's producers want to extend her contract for another year. Michael extricates himself when a technical problem forces the cast to perform live, by improvising a revelation about Emily: that she is actually Edward, Emily's twin brother who took her place to avenge her. This allows everybody a way out, but Julie is so outraged at Michael's deception that she punches him in the groin once the cameras have stopped rolling and storms off.\n\nSome weeks later, Michael is moving forward with producing Jeff's play. He returns Les's engagement ring, and Les says, \"The only reason you're still living is because I never kissed you.\" Despite his anger, Les admits that Michael was good company as Dorothy, and Michael buys him a beer.\n\nMichael later waits for Julie outside the studio. She is reluctant to talk to him, but he tells her that he and her father played pool and had a good time. She finally admits she misses Dorothy. Michael tells her Dorothy is within him and he misses her too, adding, \"I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man.\" Julie forgives him and they walk away together, engaged in conversation.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Michael Dorsey, an out-of-work actor / Dorothy Michaels, a working actress on the daytime drama \u201cSouthWest General\u201d\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Julie Nichols, an actress\n* [[Teri Garr]] as Sandy Lester, an actress\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Ron Carlisle, the director\n* [[Charles Durning]] as Leslie \"Les\" Nichols, Julie's father\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Jeff Slater, a playwright and Michael's roommate\n* [[Sydney Pollack]] as George Fields, Michael's agent\n* [[George Gaynes]] as John Van Horn, a soap opera actor\n* [[Geena Davis]] as April Page, a soap opera actress\n* [[Doris Belack]] as Rita Marshall, the producer\n* [[Ellen Foley]] as Jacqui, a production aide\n* [[Lynne Thigpen]] as Jo, a production aide\n* Amy Lawrence as Amy, Julie's daughter\n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as Linda, an actress at Michael's birthday party\n* Anne Shropshire as Mrs. Crawley, Julie's babysitter\n* Susan Egbert as Diane, Jeff's girlfriend\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn the 1970s, fashion company executive Charles Evans decided to get into filmmaking. It was an industry his brother, [[Robert Evans]], was successful in as an actor, producer, and studio executive. Evans told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1995 that he got into producing \"because I enjoy movies very much. I have the time to do it. And I believe if done wisely, it can be a profitable business.\"<ref name=\"Eller\">{{cite news |date=July 28, 1995 |first=Claudia |last=Eller |author-link=Claudia Eller |title=Company Town : Real Key Is How Goldwyn Is Treated |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-28-fi-28893-story.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref> His first foray into film production was a massive success. In the early 1970s, Don McGuire had written a play, ''Would I Lie to You?'', about an unemployed male actor who cross-dresses to get jobs. It was shopped around Hollywood for several years until it came to the attention of comedian and actor [[Buddy Hackett]] in 1978. Interested in playing the talent agent, Hackett showed Evans the script. Evans purchased an [[Option (filmmaking)|option]] on the play.
