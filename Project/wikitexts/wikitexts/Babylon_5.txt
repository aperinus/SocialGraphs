The show depicts a future where Earth has a unified [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)#Early development|Earth government]] and has gained the technology for [[faster-than-light]] travel using 'jump gates', a kind of [[wormhole]] technology allowing transport through the alternate dimension of [[hyperspace]]. The Colonies within the solar system and beyond make up the [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]], which has established contact with other [[Spacefaring#Spacefaring in popular culture|spacefaring]] species. Ten years before the series is set, Earth barely escaped destruction by the technologically superior Minbari, who sought revenge after an Earth starship unwittingly killed their leader during [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]], only for them to unexpectedly surrender on the brink of victory. Earth has since established peaceful relationships with them and the Earth Alliance has become a significant and generally respected power within the galactic community.\n\nAmong the other species are the imperialist [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]]; the [[Narn]], who only recently gained independence from the Centauri empire; and the mysterious, powerful [[Vorlon]]s. Several dozen less powerful species from the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] also have diplomatic contact with the major races, including the [[Drazi]], [[Brakiri]], [[Vree]], [[Civilizations in Babylon 5#Markab|Markab]], and [[pak'ma'ra]]. An ancient and secretive race, the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]], unknown to humans but documented in many other races' religious texts, malevolently influence events to bring chaos and war among the known species.\n\n{{Anchor|Babylon4}}\nThe ''Babylon 5'' space station is located in the [[Epsilon Eridani]] system, at the [[Trojan (celestial body)|fifth Lagrangian point]] of the fictional planet Epsilon III and its moon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/universe/station-1.html |title=Babylon 5 Universe: The Station |first=J.

Each season shares its title with an episode that is central to that season's plot.\n\n=== Season 1: Signs and Portents (1994) ===\nSinclair, the commander of ''Babylon 5'', is a hero of the Minbari war, troubled by his inability to remember events of the war's last day. Though supported by Minbari ambassador Delenn, who is secretly a member of the Minbari ruling Grey Council, other Minbari remain distrustful of him. The Narn have recently succeeded in regaining their independence from Centauri, and Centauri ambassador Mollari finds a new ally in the enigmatic Mr. Morden to strike back at the Narn. Xenophobic groups on Earth challenge humanity's contact with aliens, and President Santiago, who has favored such contact, is assassinated.\n\n=== Season 2: The Coming of Shadows (1994\u20131995) ===\nSinclair is transferred to be ambassador to Minbar, and Sheridan is assigned command of the station by his superior officer, General Hague. Hague and Sheridan believe Santiago's death is part of a conspiracy as now-president Clark takes steps to isolate Earth and install a totalitarian government. The aging Centauri Emperor dies, and against his wishes, Mollari and his ally Lord Refa replace him with his unstable nephew Cartagia. Aided by Morden's allies, the Shadows, the Centauri initiate a full-scale attack on the Narn homeworld, re-conquering it. Vorlon ambassador Kosh requests Sheridan's help to fight the Shadows.\n\n=== Season 3: Point of No Return (1995\u20131996) ===\nSheridan and Delenn establish a \"conspiracy of light\" to fight the influence of the Shadows. When Clark declares martial law, Sheridan declares ''Babylon 5''{{'s}} independence from Earth government. Mollari realizes his deal with Morden has become dangerous but is unable to end it. In retaliation for involving the Vorlons in the war, Kosh is assassinated by the Shadows. Sinclair travels back in time to become Valen, the legendary Minbari religious leader.  Despite Kosh's warnings, Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum, the Shadow homeworld, and crashes a spacecraft filled with explosives on it, seemingly dying in the explosion.\n\n=== Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat (1996\u20131997) ===\nSheridan is rescued from Z'ha'dum by the mysterious Lorien. With the Shadows in retreat, the Vorlons further their efforts to destroy any species touched by the Shadows. Mollari overthrows Cartagia with the aid of Narn ambassador G'Kar. Sheridan discovers the Vorlons and Shadows have used the younger races in a [[proxy war]], and convinces both sides to stop the war and leave the younger races in peace. Sheridan leads Minbar, Centauri, and Narn to form a new Interstellar Alliance. With their help, Sheridan is able to free Earth from control of President Clark and install a new, more peaceful regime.\n\n=== Season 5: The Wheel of Fire (1998) ===\nA group of rogue human telepaths take sanctuary on the station, seeking Sheridan's aid to escape the control of Psi Corps, the autocratic Earth agency that oversees telepaths. Remnants of the Shadows' allies attempt to break up the Alliance by setting the various races against each other, and they manipulate events on Centauri Prime to install Mollari as Emperor, but under their control. Mollari withdraws the Centauri from the Alliance. Twenty years later, Sheridan has a last reunion with his friends before leaving to join Lorien and the older races \"beyond the rim\".\n\n=== Spin-offs and television movies ===\n{{Main|Babylon 5 (franchise)}}\n\nThe original show spawned a multimedia franchise of spin-offs consisting of a miniseries, five television movies, twenty-two novels, two tabletop games (an RPG and a wargame), and various other media such as technical books, comics, and trading cards.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origin ===\nHaving worked on a number of television science fiction shows which had regularly gone over budget, Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralized location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of \"[going] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week\", a fixed space station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], ''[[Childhood's End]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]], Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become ''Babylon 5''.<ref name=\"GEnie-1992\">{{cite web<!-- Archive URL date taken from page metadata, main URL date taken is the one used for the entire document -->|url=http://www.midwinter.com/b5/GEnie/jms92-04|title=Babylon 5 (GEnie) posts by JMS for April, 1992|last=Straczynski|first=J.

It would have to be reasonably budgeted, and \"it would have to look unlike anything ever seen before on TV, presenting individual stories against a much broader canvas.\" He further stressed that his approach was \"to take [science fiction] seriously, to build characters for grown-ups, to incorporate real science but keep the characters at the center of the story.\"<ref name=\"io9 evolution\">{{cite web |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-strange-secret-evolution-of-babylon-5-5985727 |title=The Strange, Secret Evolution of Babylon 5 |last=Shankel |first=Jason |date=February 21, 2013 |work=[[io9]] |access-date=August 31, 2018 |archive-date=February 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224162258/https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-strange-secret-evolution-of-babylon-5-5985727 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"GEnie-1991\">{{cite web<!-- Note: The Google Cache archive for this cite has been removed because it is a dead link.

This also made it challenging for the actors to understand their motivations without knowing where their characters were going; Straczynski said \"I didn't want to tell them too much, because that risks having them play the result, rather than the process.\"<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\"/> He recalled that Peter Jurasik had asked him about the context of Londo's premonition, shown partially in \"[[List of Babylon 5 episodes#ep1|Midnight on the Firing Line]]\", of himself and G'Kar choking each other to death, but Straczynski had to be coy about it.<ref name=\"newsarama 2019\"/> The full death scene was shown in context in \"[[List of Babylon 5 episodes#ep61|War Without End - Part 2]]\" near the end of the third season.\n\nDuring production of the fourth season, the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]], which Warner Bros. opted to use for ''Babylon 5'', was shut down, leaving the planned fifth season in doubt. Unwilling to short-change fans of the show, Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season that would allow him to conclude his overall arc should a fifth season not be greenlit, which ultimately became the direction the fourth season took. Straczynski identified three primary [[narrative thread]]s which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth's slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network commissioned two ''Babylon 5'' television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the [[Earth\u2013Minbari War]], and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, ''Crusade''. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into ''Crusade'', or the fifth season, were it to be given the [[greenlight]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/Messages/Message?id=10251 |title=Year 4/5 |last=Straczynski |first=J.

As the main characters evolved, Bruice referred back to Straczynski and producer John Copeland who she viewed as \"surprisingly more accessible to me as advisors than other producers and directors\", so the costumes could reflect these changes. Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]]'s purple coat became dark blue and more tailored while his waistcoats became less patterned and brightly colored as Bruice felt \"Londo has evolved in my mind from a buffoonish character to one who has become more serious and darker.\"<ref name=\"Bruice2\"/>\n\nNormally there were three changes of costume for the primary actors; one for on set, one for the stunt double and one on standby in case of \"coffee spills\". For human civilians, garments were generally purchased [[Ready-to-wear|off-the-rack]] and altered in various ways, such as removing lapels from jackets and shirts while rearranging [[Hook-and-eye closure|closures]], to suggest future fashions. For some of the main female characters a more [[Haute couture|couture]] approach was taken, as in the suits worn by [[Talia Winters]] which Bruice described as being designed and fitted to within \"an inch of their life\".

A number of short stories and novels were also produced between 1995 and 2001. Additional books were published by the gaming companies Chameleon Eclectic and [[Mongoose Publishing]], to support their desk-top strategy and [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] games.\n\nThree TV films were released by [[TNT (American TV network)|Turner Network Television]] (TNT) in 1998, after funding a fifth season of ''Babylon 5'', following the demise of the [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] the previous year. In addition to ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|In the Beginning]]'', ''[[Babylon 5: Thirdspace|Thirdspace]]'', and ''[[Babylon 5: The River of Souls|The River of Souls]]'', they released a re-edited special edition of the original 1993 tv film, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering|The Gathering]]''. In 1999, a fifth tv film was also produced, ''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms|A Call to Arms]]'', which acted as a pilot movie for the spin-off series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', which TNT canceled after 13 episodes had been filmed.\n\n[[Dell Publishing]] started publication of a series of ''Babylon 5'' novels in 1995, which were ostensibly considered canon within the TV series' continuity, nominally supervised by Straczynski, with later novels in the line being more directly based upon Straczynski's own notes and story outlines. In 1997, [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] obtained the publication license from Warner Bros., and proceeded to release a number of original trilogies directly scenarized by Straczynski, as well as novelizations of three of the TNT telefilms (''In the Beginning, Thirdspace'', and ''A Call to Arms''). All of the Del Rey novels are considered completely canonical within the filmic ''Babylon 5'' universe.\n\nIn 2000, the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] purchased the rights to rerun the ''Babylon 5'' series, and premiered a new telefilm, ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers|The Legend of the Rangers]]'' in 2002, which failed to be picked up as a series.

By the release of Season 2, tapes included [[closed captioning]] of dialogue and [[Dolby Surround]] sound. [[Columbia House]] began distributing [[NTSC]] tapes, via mail order in 1997, followed by repackaged collector's editions and three-tape [[box sets|boxed sets]] in 1999, by which time the original pilot telefilm had been replaced by the re-edited TNT special edition.

Produced on double-sided 12-inch [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] discs, each contained two episodes displayed in the 4:3 broadcast aspect-ratio, with Dolby Surround audio and closed captioning for the dialogue. Starting with two TNT telefilms, ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning|In the Beginning]]'' and the re-edited special edition of ''The Gathering'', Seasons 1 and 5 were released simultaneously over a six-month period. Seasons 2 and 4 followed, but with the decision to halt production due to a drop in sales, precipitated by rumors of a pending DVD release, only the first twelve episodes of Season 2 and the first six episodes of Season 4 were ultimately released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Babylon 5: The Gathering / In The Beginning |last=Germano |first= Derek M |year=2001 |url=http://www.thecinemalaser.com/dvd2/reviews/babylon-5-tgitb-dvd.htm |publisher=thecinemalaser.com |access-date=January 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230075959/http://thecinemalaser.com/dvd2/reviews/babylon-5-tgitb-dvd.htm |archive-date=December 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|''Laserdiscs (Image Entertainment)''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"| '''Volume / Title''' || Release Date\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.01 The Gathering || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.02 Midnight On Firing Line / Soul Hunter || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.03 Born to the Purple / Infection || {{dts|1998-12-15}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.04 Parliament of Dreams / Mind War || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.05 The War Prayer / The Sky Full of Stars || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.06 Deathwalker / Believers || {{dts|1999-02-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.07 Survivors / By Any Means Necessary || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.08 Signs & Portents / TKO || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.09 Grail / Eyes || {{dts|1999-03-09}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.10 Legacies / Voice in the Wilderness #1 || {{dts|1999-04-20}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.11 Voice in Wilderness #2 / Babylon Squared || {{dts|1999-04-06}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 1.12 The Quality of Mercy / Chrysalis || {{dts|1999-04-06}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.00 Points of Departure / Revelations || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.01 The Geometry of Shadows / A Distant Star || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.02 The Long Dark / Spider in the Web || {{dts|1999-05-25}}\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Due to a numbering issue, no Vol. 2.03 exists.''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.04 A Race Through Dark Places / Soul Mates || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.05 The Coming of Shadows / Gropos || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 2.06 All Alone in the Night / Acts of Sacrifice || {{dts|1999-09-28}}\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Season 2 episodes 13 through 22 were never released on laserdisc.''\n|- class=\"expand-child\"\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em; color: gray\" colspan=\"2\" | ''Season 3 was never released on laserdisc.''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Vol. 4.01 Hour of the Wolf / Whatever Happened To Mr Garibaldi?

The telefilms were later individually released in [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|region 2]] in April 2002, though some markets received the original version of ''The Gathering'' in identical packaging.\n\nDVD boxed sets of the individual seasons, each containing six discs, began being released in October 2002. Each included a printed booklet containing episode summaries, with each disc containing audio options for German, French, and English, plus [[wikt:Special:Search/subtitle|subtitles]] in a wider range of languages, including Arabic and Dutch. Video was digitally remastered from original broadcast masters and displayed in [[anamorphic widescreen]] with remastered and remixed [[Dolby Digital]] [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] sound. Disc 1 of each set contained an introduction to the season by [[J. Michael Straczynski|Straczynski]], while disc 6 included [[featurettes]] containing interviews with various production staff, as well as information on the [[fictional universe]], and a [[gag reel]]. Three episodes in each season also contained commentary from either Straczynski, members of the main cast, and/or the episode director.\n\nSince its initial release, a number of repackaged DVD boxed sets have been produced for various [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|regional markets]]. With slightly altered [[cover art]], they included no additional content, but the discs were more securely stored in slimline cases, rather than the early \"book\" format, with hard plastic pages used during the original release of the first three seasons.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|'''Initial DVD release'''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\"| '''Episode box sets''' || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] || [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]]\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete First Season || November 5, 2002 || October 28, 2002 || November 27, 2002\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Second Season || April 29, 2003 || May 26, 2003 || July 9, 2003\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Third Season || August 12, 2003 || November 10, 2003 || December 19, 2003\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 1em\" align=\"left\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season || January 6, 2004 || April 19, 2004 || August 19, 2004\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Fifth Season || April 13, 2004 || Jan 2005 || December 16, 2004\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series || August 17, 2004 || N/A || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Complete Universe (inc. all movies and Crusade episodes)|| N/A || October 24, 2005 || N/A\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 0\"|'''Movie releases and box sets'''\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Gathering / In the Beginning || December 4, 2001 || N/A || November 21, 2001\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Gathering || N/A || April 8, 2002 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: In the Beginning || N/A || April 8, 2002 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Movie Collection || August 17, 2004 || N/A || March 2, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: Movie Box Set || N/A || February 21, 2005 || N/A\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers || March 14, 2006 || October 24, 2005 || November 16, 2005\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left: 1em\" | Babylon 5: The Lost Tales || July 31, 2007 || September 3, 2007 || January 2, 2008\n|}\n\n=== Mastering problems ===\nWhile the series was in pre-production, studios were looking at ways for their existing shows to make the transition from the then-standard [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|4:3 aspect ratio]] to the [[widescreen]] formats that would accompany the next generation of televisions. After visiting [[Warner Bros.]], which was stretching the [[Horizontal blanking interval|horizontal interval]] for an episode of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]]'', producer John Copeland convinced them to allow ''Babylon 5'' to be shot on [[Super 35|Super 35mm film stock]]. \"The idea being that we would [[telecine]] to 4:3 for the original broadcast of the series.
