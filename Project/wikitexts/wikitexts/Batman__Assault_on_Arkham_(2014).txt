In the film, a Suicide Squad of six criminals is dispatched by [[Amanda Waller]] to break into [[Arkham Asylum]], where they must contend with the asylum's inmates and Batman as they attempt to complete their mission.\n\nThe film stars [[Kevin Conroy]] as Bruce Wayne/Batman (reprising his role as Batman from the [[DC animated universe]], among other numerous DC properties, including the ''Arkham'' series), [[Neal McDonough]] as Floyd Lawton/Deadshot, [[Hynden Walch]] as Dr. Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn (who reprises her role from ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'') and [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nygma/Riddler]]. In addition, [[Troy Baker]], [[CCH Pounder]], [[Nolan North]], and [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] reprise their roles of [[Joker (character)|Joker]], Amanda Waller, [[Penguin (character)|Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]] from ''Arkham Origins'' (with Pounder previously appearing in the DCAU and ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' and North and Jarvis appearing in ''[[Batman: Arkham City|Arkham City]]'' as well) while [[Jennifer Hale]] reprises her role of [[Killer Frost|Louise Lincoln/Killer Frost]] from the DCAU and other properties.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Plot==\n[[Bruce Wayne (Arkham series character)|Batman]] rescues the [[Riddler]] from a black ops assassination ordered by [[A.R.G.U.S.]]' director [[Amanda Waller]], returning him to [[Arkham Asylum]]. Invoking Priority Ultraviolet, Waller captures wanted supercriminals [[Black Spider]], [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[KGBeast]], [[Killer Frost]], and [[King Shark]] for the [[Suicide Squad]]. Their mission is to break into Arkham and recover a [[Flash memory|thumbdrive]] in Riddler's cane containing sensitive knowledge about the squad. She forces compliance by threatening to detonate nano-bombs implanted in their necks, and KGBeast is killed when he attempts to walk out on Waller. The remaining six are sent to [[Gotham City]] to get equipment from the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], and while staying the night at the Iceberg Lounge Harley and Deadshot sleep together. The next day Harley commits a crime to lure Batman out, who is looking for a [[dirty bomb]] the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] had hidden in the city. Harley is taken back to Arkham.\n\nAt Arkham, the incarcerated Joker taunts Harley, which causes her to fire a gun at him in a rage. While this is happening, the other members of the squad infiltrate the Asylum and loop the previous day's security camera footage to keep both Batman and Waller from noticing them. The team finds Riddler's cane and Harley's mallet, but the cane contains nothing. Batman arrives after having noticed the security camera ruse and fights the squad. He defeats them one by one before being seemingly beaten by Black Spider. Killer Frost splits from the group and goes to Riddler's cell; Waller secretly ordered her to carry out the real mission of the squad, to kill Riddler. Riddler reveals that Waller can't detonate his neck explosive because he knows how to disarm them, and the squad agrees to help him escape if he can disarm theirs. Meanwhile, Joker notices a weakness in his cell walls from Harley's attempt to shoot him and short-circuits the door to escape.\n\nRiddler hooks the squad up \u2013 minus Black Spider \u2013 to an electro shock machine to fry the explosives. Riddler turns on the machine as Waller calls for an update; seeing the bombs' signals fading and learning of the squad's betrayal, she activates them. Harley, Deadshot, Boomerang, and Frost survive, but King Shark's head explodes due to his thick skin blocking the electricity. The group questions how Black Spider's bomb didn't detonate, and Riddler realizes that \"Black Spider\" is Batman in disguise; Black Spider had just been killed by the bomb detonation on his neck by Waller moments ago. After revealing himself, Batman demands the squad explain why they're in Arkham. Joker arrives and attacks Batman, providing a distraction for the squad to escape. Joker, enraged at Deadshot for \"touching his stuff\" by sleeping with Harley, intercepts them, but Harley sweet-talks him into forgiving her. As the remaining squad members flee, Batman encounters them and deduces from Deadshot that Joker has hidden the dirty bomb in Harley's mallet, which he then activates. Joker releases Arkham's inmates (including [[Two-Face]], [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]]) as a distraction to allow him to escape.\n\nFrost is killed in the chaos by Bane, and Deadshot subdues Captain Boomerang to board a helicopter and escape. Batman notices three heartbeats coming from the helicopter and realizes Joker and Harley have stowed away in it. He follows them in the Batwing while Deadshot and Joker fight. The helicopter collides into a building; Batman knocks out Harley and disarms the bomb. At the same time, Deadshot pins Joker inside the helicopter, which then falls to the ground and explodes.\n\nIn the aftermath, Batman confronts Waller over the incident. He clarifies that her actions allowed Riddler to escape from Arkham, and warns her to discontinue the Task Force X program. Waller dismisses his warning and taunts that Joker's body was not found in the helicopter crash. Once Batman leaves, Waller notices a laser trained on her. Deadshot is shown to be the source, reunited with his daughter, and the movie ends before he pulls the trigger, leaving Waller's fate uncertain.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|''[[Batman: Arkham Underworld]]'' reveals that Deadshot never pulled the trigger as Batman stopped him before he could decide to carry out Waller's assassination.}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Kevin Conroy]] \u2013 [[Bruce Wayne (Arkham series character)|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]<ref name=\"ScreenrantCast\" />\n*[[Neal McDonough]] \u2013 [[Deadshot|Floyd Lawton / Deadshot]]<ref name=\"ScreenrantCast\" />\n*[[Hynden Walch]] \u2013 [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn]]<ref name=\"HarleyVA\"/>\n*[[Matthew Gray Gubler]] \u2013 [[Riddler|Edward Nygma / Riddler]]<ref name=\"CastCBR\"/>\n*[[Troy Baker]] \u2013 [[Joker (character)|Joker]]<ref name=\"ScreenrantCast\" />\n*[[CCH Pounder]] \u2013 [[Amanda Waller]]<ref name=\"CastCBR\"/>\n*[[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] \u2013 [[Captain Boomerang|George Harkness / Captain Boomerang]]<ref name=\"CastCBR\"/>\n*[[Giancarlo Esposito]] \u2013 [[Black Spider|Eric Needham / Black Spider]]<ref name=\"CastCBR\"/>\n*[[John DiMaggio]] \u2013 [[King Shark|Nanaue / King Shark]]<ref name=\"KingShark&KillerFrostVATweet\"/>\n*[[Jennifer Hale]] \u2013 [[Killer Frost|Louise Lincoln / Killer Frost]]<ref name=\"KingShark&KillerFrostVATweet\"/>\n*[[Nolan North]] \u2013 [[KGBeast|Anatoli Knyazev / KGBeast]], [[Penguin (character)|Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin]]<ref name=\"KGBeast&PenguinVATweet\"/>\n*[[Eric Bauza]] \u2013 Security Guy\n*[[Chris Cox (voice actor)|Chris Cox]] \u2013 [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]\n*[[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] \u2013 [[Alfred Pennyworth]]\n*[[Peter Jessop]] \u2013 Watch Commander\n*Christian Lanz \u2013 [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow]], [[Victor Zsasz]]\n*[[Andrea Romano (voice director)|Andrea Romano]] \u2013 Woman\n*[[Travis Willingham]] \u2013 Morgue Guy\n*[[Mick Wingert]] \u2013 Joker Security Guy\n{{Div col end}}\n\nSome characters from the ''Arkham'' games appear in non-speaking cameos including [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Two-Face]], and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]].\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Batman: Assault on Arkham (Music from the DC Universe Movie)\n| type       = Film score\n| artist     = [[Robert J.

He described it as a \"gleefully immoral\" heist film which, having \"no real [plot] arc to speak of\", relies on its violent action and clever character dynamics within the Suicide Squad to carry it. Due to its villainous protagonists, dark comedy, and sexual content, Mendelson considers the production of ''Assault on Arkham'' an experimental decision by DC, and a successful experiment as it tells a style of comic book story that would never get approval as a live-action project.<ref name=\"Mendelson\" />\n\nSeth Robison of [[Newsarama]] was far more critical, considering the animation, characterization, and storytelling in the film poor. He had particular dislike for the voice acting, which he believed squandered a talented cast by delivering a \"disjointed\" performance, and for ''Assault on Arkham''{{'}}s interpretation of Amanda Waller, which he believed simplified her into merely another villain. He further found Deadshot's sympathetic characterization opaque to non-comic readers and Harley Quinn's crazy act obnoxious. Overall, Robison deemed the experience of the film \"superficial\" and thought it compared unfavorably to those offered by the ''Arkham'' video games and the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode \"[[List of Justice League episodes#Season 2: 2005|Task Force X]]\".<ref name=\"Robison\" />\n\n===Sales===\n\nThe film earned $5,820,248 in domestic home video sales.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Batman-Assault-on-Arkham#tab=summary \"Batman: Assault on Arkham (2014) The Numbers listing\"].
