The film is an adaptation of [[Farley Mowat]]'s 1963 [[Never Cry Wolf (book)|autobiography of the same name]] and stars [[Charles Martin Smith]] as a government [[biologist]] sent into the wilderness to study the [[caribou]] population, whose decline is believed to be caused by wolves, even though no one has seen a [[wolf]] kill a caribou. The film also features [[Brian Dennehy]] and Zachary Ittimangnaq. It was the first Disney film to be released under the new [[Walt Disney Pictures]] label. The film was released on October 7, 1983, for a limited distribution, and in the regular theaters on January 27, 1984.\n\nThe film is also notable for being the first Walt Disney Pictures film to feature brief full-frontal male [[nudity]], as well as scenes with bare [[buttocks]].\n\nThe narration for the film was written by Charles Martin Smith, Eugene Corr and Christina Luescher.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\n== Plot ==\nThe young, na\u00efve Canadian biologist Tyler is assigned by the government to travel to the isolated [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]] wilderness and study why the area's [[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]] population is declining, believed to be due to [[wolf-pack]] attacks; amongst his orders to study them, he is also given a gun and required to kill one wolf and examine its stomach contents. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by [[de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver|bush plane]] piloted by \"Rosie\" Little. After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler in the middle of a sub-zero frozen Arctic lake. Tyler is at a loss of what to do about his situation until he is rescued by a traveling [[Inuit]] named Ootek, who transports him and his gear off the ice and builds a shelter for him.\n\nAlone, Tyler divides his days between research and survival, while nights are fraught with nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves\u2014which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them. He and the wolves begin social exchanges, even [[wolf urine|urine-marking their territories]], producing trust and respect between them. Noticing that they have not eaten any caribou and only mice, he begins a side experiment of eating only mice for protein sustenance.\n\nAnother Inuit named Mike encounters Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, is content and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems not only more reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly due to the fact that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled. Tyler discovers that Mike is a wolf hunter, killing for pelts to sell to make a living. Tyler demonstrates a trick he has learned: by playing certain notes on his bassoon, he can imitate a wolf howl, calling other wolves in.\n\nAutumn nears, and Tyler hears that the caribou are migrating south, which will provide an opportunity for him to study the concept his superiors want to confirm. Ootek takes Tyler on a three-day hike to where the caribou will be. The caribou show up as predicted and Tyler observes the wolves make several unsuccessful attacks. Tyler helps drive caribou towards the [[pack (canine)|pack]], which soon takes one down. Tyler takes a bone and samples the marrow, discovering the dead caribou to be diseased. It confirms that the wolves are not ruthless killers but rather their predation kills off only the weaker caribou.\n\nOne day, Tyler encounters Rosie with two hunter-guests, making plans to exploit the area's resources. Rosie insists on flying out Tyler, who refuses. Rosie then offers to extract Tyler from his research campsite in three days, the time it will take Tyler to hike back.\n\nTyler returns to the base to find things very still. He ventures into the wolves' territory and goes into their den, only to find the pups cowering in fear and the two wolves nowhere in sight. Rosie's aircraft approaches outside. Believing that Rosie killed George and Angeline, Tyler shouts at Rosie to leave, then shoots at Rosie's plane, which makes him fly away.\n\nTyler goes back to his camp to find Mike, whose nervous demeanor causes Tyler to suspect that it was Mike, not Rosie, who killed the two wolves. Mike confirms Tyler's suspicions by smiling with a full set of new dentures and leaves, hiking for home.\n\nSome time later, as the first snow begins to fall, Tyler plays the wolf call on his bassoon, bringing in other wolves from George and Angeline's pack. He reflects on his time in the wilderness and how he may have helped bring the modern world to this place. The narration implies that Tyler will return to civilization and recover from his experiences here. Ootek has returned, and in the final scene he and Tyler break camp and trek across the fall [[tundra]] to the south, enjoying each other's company, along with the words of an Inuit song that Tyler translates:\n\n{{blockquote|<poem>I think over again my small adventures, my fears.\nThose small ones that seemed so big.\nFor all the vital things I had to get and to reach.\nAnd yet there is only one great thing, the only thing:\nTo live to see the great day that dawns\nand the light that fills the world.</poem>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Tyler, a biologist without any survival skills, yet bold enough to study wolves in their environment.\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Rosie Little, a carefree bush pilot who exploits the region for money.\n* Zachary Ittimangnaq as Ootek, an Inuit who helps Tyler survive the wilderness.\n* Samson Jorah as Mike, Ootek's adoptive son, caught between his Inuit ways and the modern world.\n* Martha Ittimangnaq as Woman, Ootek's wife.\n* Hugh Webster as Drunk\n* Tom Dahlgren as Hunter #1\n* Walker Stuart as Hunter #2\n\n== {{anchor|Background}} Production ==\nThe fundamental premise in ''Never Cry Wolf''  is that life in the Arctic seems to be about dying: not only are the caribou and the wolves dying, but the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Inuit]] and their way of life as well. The animals are losing their [[habitat]] and the Inuit are losing their land and their [[natural resource|resources]] while their youth are being seduced by\u2014and pressured into\u2014[[modernity]]. They are trading what is real and true, dicing away their time-honoured traditions for the perceived comforts and securities of the [[modernity|modern world]].\n\n''Never Cry Wolf'' blends the documentary film style with the narrative elements of drama, resulting in a type of [[docudrama]].  \n{{Anchor|Writing}}\nIt was originally written for the screen by [[Sam Hamm]] but the screenplay was altered over time and Hamm ended up sharing credit with [[Curtis Hanson]] and Richard Kletter.<ref name=\"NNDB\">[http://www.nndb.com/people/518/000022452/ \"Sam Hamm.\"] ''NNDB/Soylent Communications''.

In the book, Ootek and Mike's roles are reversed, Mike is actually Ootek's older brother (Ootek is a teenager) and Ootek, although speaking mostly in [[Inuktitut]], communicates openly with Mowat while Mike is more reserved.\n\nThe film adds a more spiritual element to the story while the book was a straightforward story. The film also isolates the characters while in the book, Mowat meets several people from different areas of the Arctic. Also in the book, the wolves are not killed and neither did the bush pilot bring in investors to build a resort.<ref>Mowat 2001, p. 13.</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Mowat, Farley.
