It was the second feature film based on the 1812 novel ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' by [[Johann David Wyss]], [[Swiss Family Robinson (1940 film)|a previous adaptation]] having been released by [[RKO Pictures]] in 1940. Directed by [[Ken Annakin]] and shot in [[Tobago]] and [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London, it was the first widescreen [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film shot with [[Panavision]] lenses; when shooting in widescreen, Disney had almost always used a [[matte (filmmaking)|matte]]d wide screen or filmed in [[CinemaScope]].<ref name=locations>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054357/locations IMDb: Filming locations for ''Swiss Family Robinson''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213324/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054357/locations |date=2016-03-04 }} Retrieved 2013-03-10</ref>\n\nUpon its release, ''Swiss Family Robinson'' was a major success with both critics and audiences and remains one of Disney's most beloved live-action feature films.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summaries for feature films are not to exceed 700 words. This article is at 690. Please add nothing without checking wordcount/necessity of addition first.-->\nA [[Swiss people|Swiss]] family from [[Bern]]\u2014Father, Mother, and their three sons\u2014are relocating to a colony in [[New Guinea]] to escape the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when their ship is attacked by pirates and flees into a storm. The crew abandons ship, leaving the family on board, and the ship grounds on rocks off of an uninhabited island. The family makes their way ashore along with the captain's two [[Great Dane]]s. Father, eldest son Fritz, and middle son Ernst salvage supplies and livestock from the shipwreck. The pirates locate the ship, but Father scares them off by putting up a quarantine flag, signaling disease aboard.\n\nThe family soon discovers that the island contains a diversity of wildlife, including a dangerous tiger. To provide safety and comfort, Father, Fritz, and Ernst construct an elaborate [[tree house]] complete with a [[water wheel]]. Youngest son Francis collects various animals including a young [[Asian elephant]], a monkey, and an [[ostrich]]. Ernst theorizes that the island may once have been part of a [[land bridge]] between Africa and Asia. As the family settles in, Father opines that, by going [[back to nature]], they have found everything they need in life. Mother, however, worries that her sons will never marry or have families if they are not rescued, and consents to allow Fritz and Ernst to circumnavigate the island in a homemade [[outrigger boat]] and search for other settlements.\n\nDuring their expedition, the brothers come across the pirates, who have captured another ship and taken its captain and [[cabin boy]] captive. They rescue the cabin boy, but the pirates spot them before they can free the captain, who insists they leave him since the pirates intend to ransom him. The brothers and the boy flee the pirates through the jungle, the brothers later learning that the \"boy\" is really a girl named Roberta. The captain (her grandfather) cut her hair and dressed her as a boy to disguise her gender from the pirates. They survive an attack by an [[anaconda]], but become lost and fight over what to do. Fritz's strong personality wins in the end, and they decide to press on. They rescue a [[zebra]] from [[hyenas]] and a [[quicksand]] trap; using it as a mount, they arrive back at the tree house just in time for Christmas.\n\nAnticipating that the pirates will come looking for Roberta, the family [[scuttling|scuttles]] their wrecked ship to hide their location. They fortify a rocky clifftop, building defenses and [[booby trap]]s. Fritz and Ernst become rivals for Roberta's affections. Believing that her grandfather will return for her once ransomed, she intends to return to [[London]]; Ernst is interested in going to school there, while Fritz would rather go on to New Guinea to build a home of his own. Despite this, a romance develops between Fritz and Roberta, and the brothers come to blows over her. To relieve tension, Father declares a holiday to be held. That night, Francis manages to catch the tiger in one of the pits that they have dug.\n\nThe holiday begins with a race, the boys and Roberta riding on various animals. The pirates, sailing nearby, hear the sound of the starting pistol and come ashore. The family retreats to their fort, and the attackers fall victim to their traps and defenses. The pirate captain demands that they hand over Roberta, while his men sneak up the cliff side and attack from the rear. As the family is about to be overwhelmed, a ship captained by Roberta's grandfather appears, destroying the pirates and their ship with cannon fire.\n\nThe captain offers to help Ernst get into a London university, and to take the rest of the family back to Europe or on to New Guinea. Father and Mother, however, decide that they would rather stay on the island and keep Francis with them for a few more years. The captain speculates that the island will become a new colony, and that Father will be nominated to be its governor. Fritz and Roberta also decide to stay on the island, and the family waves goodbye to Ernst as he, the captain, and the ship's crew set out for England. The film ends when the elephant runs to the sea, catching Ernst, as Francis tries to bring him back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Mills]] as Father Robinson\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Mother Robinson\n* [[James MacArthur]] as Fritz Robinson\n* [[Janet Munro]] as Roberta\n* [[Sessue Hayakawa]] as Kuala, the pirate captain\n* [[Tommy Kirk]] as Ernst Robinson\n* [[Kevin Corcoran]] as Francis Robinson\n* [[Cecil Parker]] as Captain Moreland\n* Andy Ho as Auban, a pirate\n* [[Milton Reid]] as Big Pirate\n* [[Larry Taylor (actor)|Larry Taylor]] as Battoo, a pirate\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film is based upon ''Der Schweizerische Robinson'' (translated as ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]''), a book written by [[Johann David Wyss]].<ref name=\"TCM2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/25093/Swiss-Family-Robinson/notes.html |work=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Swiss Family Robinson - Notes |access-date=7 April 2013 |archive-date=5 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305075018/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/25093/Swiss-Family-Robinson/notes.html |url-status=live }}</ref> [[RKO Pictures]] had previously made [[Swiss Family Robinson (1940 film)|an adaptation]] in 1940, directed by [[Edward Ludwig]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Swiss Family Robinson (1940) |first=Frank S. |last=Nugent |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1940/02/09/archives/the-screen-on-a-tropic-slightly-toporific-isle-lands-wysss-swiss.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=9 February 1940 |access-date=January 21, 2022 |archive-date=23 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023064342/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905E6DB1F3EE23ABC4153DFB466838B659EDE |url-status=live }}</ref> After watching that movie, [[Walt Disney]] and Bill Anderson decided to produce their own version of the story.<ref name=\"TCM2\"/> Anderson talked with director [[Ken Annakin]] during filming of another live-action Disney picture, ''[[Third Man on the Mountain]]'', near [[Zermatt]] (Switzerland).{{sfn|Maltin|1995|p=176}} Ken Annakin had also worked with Disney in the 1953 adventure film ''[[The Sword and the Rose]]''.<ref name=\"TCM1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/203349%7C0/Swiss-Family-Robinson.html |last=Passafiume |first=Andrea |title=SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON (1960) |work=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=9 April 2013 |archive-date=1 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201005051/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/203349%7C0/Swiss-Family-Robinson.html |url-status=live }}</ref> During his stay in Switzerland, Annakin read the book and he wondered why Disney wanted to make a story so outdated.{{sfn|Maltin|1995|p=176}}\n\n[[File:Tobago-sunset.jpg|thumb|left|The movie was filmed almost entirely on the island of Tobago]]\nThere were several meetings to decide filming locations.
