Directed by American [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] filmmaker [[Jules Dassin]], the film stars [[Jean Servais]] as the aging gangster Tony \"le St\u00e9phanois\", [[Carl M\u00f6hner]] as Jo \"le Su\u00e9dois\", [[Robert Manuel (actor)|Robert Manuel]] as Mario Farrati, and Jules Dassin as C\u00e9sar \"le Milanais\". The foursome band together to commit an almost impossible theft, the burglary of an exclusive jewelry shop in the [[Rue de la Paix]]. The centerpiece of the film is an intricate half-hour heist scene depicting the crime in detail, shot in near silence, without dialogue or music. The fictional burglary has been mimicked by criminals in actual crimes around the world.<ref name=newspaperarchive/><ref name=\"Powrie71\"/>\n\nAfter he was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], Dassin found work in France where he was asked to direct ''Rififi''. Despite his distaste for parts of the original novel, Dassin agreed to direct the film. He shot ''Rififi'' while working with a low budget, without a star cast, and with the production staff working for low wages.<ref name=\"ebert\"/>\n\nUpon the initial release of the film, it received positive reactions from audiences and critics in France, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The film earned Dassin the award for [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] at the [[1955 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3723/year/1955.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Rififi |access-date=31 January 2009|publisher=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> ''Rififi'' was nominated by the [[National Board of Review]] for Best Foreign Film.

His friend Jo approaches him about a smash-and-grab proposed by mutual friend Mario in which the threesome would cut the glass on a [[Paris]]ian jeweler's front window in broad daylight and snatch some gems. Tony declines. He then learns that his old girlfriend, Mado, took up in his absence with gangster Parisian nightclub owner Pierre Grutter. Finding Mado working at Grutter's, Tony invites her back to his rundown flat. She is obviously well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter. Tony changes his mind about the heist; he now accepts on the condition that rather than merely robbing the window, they will take on the more difficult but more lucrative task of robbing the store's safe. Mario suggests they employ the services of Italian compatriot C\u00e9sar, a [[safecracker]]. The four devise and rehearse an ingenious plan to break into the store and disable its sophisticated alarm system.\n\nThe caper begins with the group chiseling through a cement ceiling from an upstairs flat on a Sunday night. The suspenseful break-in is completed, and the criminals appear to escape without leaving any trace of their identities. However, without the others' knowledge, C\u00e9sar pocketed a diamond ring as a bauble for his lover Viviane, a chanteuse at Grutter's club. The heist makes headline news and the four men arrange to [[fence (criminal)|fence]] the loot with a [[London]] contact. Meanwhile, Grutter has seen Mado and her injuries, and she breaks off their relationship. Infuriated at Tony's interference in his life, Grutter gives [[heroin]] to his drug-addicted brother R\u00e9my and tells him to murder Tony. But then, the other Grutter brother, Louis, shows them the diamond C\u00e9sar gave to Viviane and they realize that C\u00e9sar, Mario, and Tony were responsible for the jewel theft. Grutter forces C\u00e9sar to confess. Forsaking a [[French franc|FF]]10 million police reward, Grutter decides to steal the jewels from Tony's gang, with R\u00e9my brutally murdering Mario and his wife Ida when they refuse to reveal where the loot is hidden. Tony retrieves it from the couple's apartment and anonymously pays for a splendid funeral for them. He then goes looking for Grutter and stumbles onto the captive C\u00e9sar, who confesses having squealed. Citing \"the rules,\" Tony ruefully kills him.\n\nMeanwhile, seeking to force their adversaries' hand, Grutter's thugs kidnap Jo's five-year-old son Tonio and hold him for [[ransom]]. The London fence arrives with the payoff, after which Tony leaves to single-handedly rescue the child by force, advising Jo it is the only way they will see him alive.  With Mado's help, he tracks Tonio down at Grutter's country house and kills R\u00e9my and Louis while rescuing him. On the way back to Paris, Tony learns Jo has cracked under the pressure and agreed to meet Grutter at his house with the money. When Jo arrives Grutter tells him Tony has already snatched the child and kills him. Seconds too late to save his friend, Tony is mortally wounded by Grutter but kills him as Grutter tries to flee with the loot. Bleeding profusely, Tony drives maniacally back to Paris and delivers Tonio home safely before dying at the wheel as police and bystanders close in on him and a suitcase filled with FF120 million in cash. Jo's wife, Louise, takes her child from the car and leaves the suitcase and the body to police.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jean Servais]] as Tony \"le St\u00e9phanois\": A gangster who recently returned from serving five years in prison for jewel theft.
