It stars [[Evan McGuire]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], Christen Mooney, [[Mick Lally]] (in his final film role), [[Michael McGrath (actor)|Michael McGrath]], [[Liam Hourican]], [[Paul Tylak]] and Paul Young. The film is the first installment in Moore's \"Irish Folklore Trilogy\", preceding the films ''[[Song of the Sea (2014 film)|Song of the Sea]]'' (2014) and ''[[Wolfwalkers]]'' (2020).<ref>{{cite web |title=Wolfwalkers |url=https://tiff.net/events/wolfwalkers |website=tiff.net |publisher=Toronto International Film Festival |access-date=28 December 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSet in 9th century [[Ireland]], during the age of [[Viking expansion]], the film\u2019s protagonist is Brendan, a curious and brave boy living in the tightly knit [[Abbey of Kells]] under the care of his stern uncle, Abbot Cellach, who is obsessed with building a wall around the Abbey to prevent [[Viking]] attacks.\n\nApprenticed in the [[scriptorium]] of the monastery, Brendan hears the other monks talk of Brother Aidan, creator of the ''Book of Iona'', and becomes curious about the mysterious illuminator and the book that \"turns darkness into light\" (the unfinished ''[[Book of Kells]]''). Aidan arrives in Kells, accompanied by his white cat, [[Pangur B\u00e1n]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Secret of Kells |website=newvideo.com |type=promotional |url=http://www.newvideo.com/secretofkells/}}</ref> after his [[Iona Abbey|monastery at Iona]] is destroyed by a raid. After eavesdropping on a discussion between Cellach and Aidan, Brendan wanders into the scriptorium and finds the still-to-be-completed book guarded by Pangur B\u00e1n. Aidan arrives, and tells Brendan about the book.\n\nSeeing Brendan as a suitable apprentice, Aidan sends him and Pangur B\u00e1n into the woods to obtain [[Oak apple|gall nuts]] to make ink. Cornered by a hungry pack of wolves, Brendan is saved by the fairy Aisling, who overcomes her initial suspicion and accepts Brendan after he reveals his intentions of helping to create the book.\n\nAfter a close encounter with [[Crom Cruach]], a deity of death and destruction of whom Aisling is deeply afraid, Brendan and Aisling return to the outskirts of the forest, and she assures him that he can return any time.\n\nAt the monastery, Brendan is reprimanded by Cellach, who forbids him to leave again. Continuing to work with Aidan, Brendan learns that the work is endangered by the loss of the \u2018Eye of [[Columba|Colm Cille]]\u2019, a special magnifying lens captured from Crom Cruach. When Brendan tries to visit Crom's cave to obtain another \u2018Eye\u2019, Cellach confines him to his room.\n\nFreed by Pangur B\u00e1n and Aisling, Brendan runs into the heart of the woods, where a shocked Aisling begs him not to confront the dark deity, warning that Crom Cruach will kill him just as it killed her mother and the rest of her people. Declaring that the book will never be completed without the \u2018Eye\u2019, Brendan persuades Aisling to help him enter Crom\u2019s cave, narrowly escaping death in the process. Brendan duels with Crom and seizes the Eye, blinding Crom and causing the deity to consume itself, becoming an [[ouroboros]]. Returning to the cave entrance, Brendan finds the forest covered in white flowers.\n\nBrendan returns to the abbey and continues to assist Aidan in secret, watched excitedly by the brothers of the monastery. A messenger from outside warns Cellach that the Vikings are on their way. In a fit of anger and frustration, Cellach locks Brendan and Aidan in the scriptorium, but not before ripping out a page Brendan had created. The Vikings invade Kells and breach the wooden gate, to Cellach\u2019s horror. Cellach is wounded by an arrow, then by a Viking blade, as the Vikings swarm Kells. Still locked in the burning scriptorium, Brendan and Aidan escape using green smoke from the gallberry ink, confusing the raiders. The wooden staircase to the abbey\u2019s central tower becomes overloaded with panicked villagers and collapses, and the village and abbey below are set ablaze.\n\nUnable to help Cellach, Brendan and Aidan flee to the forest with Pangur B\u00e1n as the Vikings breach the main church and attack the monks and villagers hiding within. Vikings in the forest find Brendan and Aidan and take the bejeweled cover, scattering the pages of the book, but Aisling\u2019s wolves arrive and either scare away or kill the Vikings. As Brendan finds the final page of the book, he comes face to face for a moment with a white wolf, who may be Aisling.\n\nKells has been sacked and burnt, with few survivors, and Cellach severely injured (although he survives). Brendan and Aidan travel across Ireland and, after many years, complete the book. Aidan entrusts the book to Brendan and then dies, and the now-adult Brendan returns to Kells with Pangur B\u00e1n, guided by a white wolf (revealed to be Aisling). Brendan reunites with the aged, guilt-ridden Cellach, and shows him the completed ''Book of Kells''. The film closes with an animated rendition of the Chi-Rho page, featuring its intense detail.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Evan McGuire]] as Brendan, a bright, imaginative, and curious 12-year-old who leads a sheltered life. \n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Abbot Cellach, Brendan's uncle, who is a former [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminator]] who now superintends a wall to protect the [[Abbey of Kells]] from invasion.\n* [[Christen Mooney]] as Aisling, a forest [[fairy]], related to the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]], living in the woods outside of Kells. \n* [[Mick Lally]] as Brother Aidan, a master illuminator.
