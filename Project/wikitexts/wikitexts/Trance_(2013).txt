It stars [[James McAvoy]], [[Vincent Cassel]], and [[Rosario Dawson]]. The world premiere of the film was held in London on 19 March 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Witches Flight Goya.jpg|left|thumb|[[Francisco Goya|Francisco Goya's]] ''[[Witches' Flight|Witches in the Air]]'' (1798), the painting stolen in the film. In reality, it is part of the collection of the [[Museo del Prado]].]]Four men attack an auction house during the auction of [[Francisco Goya]]'s ''[[Witches' Flight|Witches in the Air]]'' (1798). Simon Newton (McAvoy), one of the auctioneers, follows the house's emergency protocol by quickly removing the painting from the auction floor and packaging it for deposit in a vault, but Franck (Cassel), the leader of the thieves, finds him and takes the package at gunpoint. Simon attacks Franck, who hits Simon on the head and knocks him unconscious. When Franck gets home, he discovers that the package contains only an empty frame. The thieves are unable to find the painting in Simon's apartment or car, so, after he is released from the hospital, they kidnap and torture him. It becomes clear that Simon was involved in the heist as an \"inside man\" and double-crossed the other thieves, but the blow to the head has left him with a case of [[amnesia]], and he does not remember where he hid the painting. Franck decides to send Simon to a [[hypnotherapist]] to try to help him remember.\n\nSimon chooses Elizabeth Lamb (Dawson) from a list of hypnotherapists. Using a fake name, he tells her he is looking for some lost keys, hoping he can secretly get her to lead him to the painting instead. While he is in a hypnotic [[trance]], Simon gives Elizabeth his real name as the name of an alter ego who will help them find the keys, and she notices Simon's injuries from being tortured and sees a wire sticking out from under his shirt from the [[covert listening device]] he is wearing so the other thieves can hear what he says during the session. When there are only keys in the location Elizabeth helps Simon remember, Franck sends Simon back to Elizabeth. By their second session, she has researched Simon and the theft, and she starts by silently asking him if he is in trouble. When he says he is, she says she can help and tells the other thieves she needs to talk to them.\n\nIn exchange for a cut of the proceeds from the sale of the painting, Elizabeth hypnotizes Simon again, this time with the other thieves present, but she is unable to get him to remember the location of the painting. Afterward, she asks him how he got involved with Franck, and Simon confesses that he has a gambling problem and convinced Franck to settle his debts in exchange for help stealing the painting.\n\nDuring the next hypnosis session, Simon remembers that, before encountering Franck during the heist, he had cut the painting from the frame and hid it in his suit, and he attacked Franck because Franck was about to look at the painting. Shortly after the blow to his head, he awoke alone and left the auction house. While crossing the street, he was distracted by a text message on his phone and got hit by a red car. He remembers the driver as having been Elizabeth, who he accuses of making him forget something before lunging at her, in the memory as well as in real life. The other thieves restrain Simon, and Elizabeth brings him out of the trance.\n\nThe next morning, Simon wakes up to find that Elizabeth has slept on his couch because she was worried about him. He says he had a strange dream, which she says was not a dream, in which she and Franck put him in a [[fMRI]] and ran a test that indicated he has an obsession with her. Elizabeth explains to Franck that this is due to [[transference]] and Simon's attempts to fill the gaps in his memory from the brain trauma, but she can use it to seduce Simon and get him to tell her where the painting is. When Simon apologizes to Elizabeth, she acts understanding and agrees to go to out with him.\n\n[[File:Goya Maja naga2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Francisco Goya|Goya's]] ''[[Nude Maja]]'' (''ca''. 1795), a painting Simon discusses in the film.]]At dinner, Simon abruptly cools toward Elizabeth and goes home. She tells Franck this happened because Simon is jealous of him, and Franck and Elizabeth argue and then have sex. One of the other thieves sees this and tells Simon, who is waiting for Elizabeth when she gets home. She is able to trigger his lust for her to calm his jealousy, and then surreptitiously hypnotizes him. By leading Simon through an imagined narrative in which Franck is planning to kill him, Elizabeth is finally able to get Simon to reveal to her where he hid the painting, but she is caught by the other thieves when she leaves to go retrieve it. Simon and Franck are sent to get the painting, while the other thieves stay behind in Elizabeth's apartment to rape her. Franck is distracted by her screams as the thieves draw closer to her, and Simon overpowers Franck and kills the other three thieves.\n\nElizabeth convinces Simon to spare Franck and bring him with them to get the painting. The trio go to a parking garage and collect a red car, which they drive to a warehouse. During the trip, Elizabeth reveals that Simon had previously come to her for help with his gambling addiction. They started an affair, but he became obsessed with her, jealous, and, eventually, abusive. Fearing for her life, she re-directed the hypnosis to make him forget her. Unfortunately, when Franck hit Simon on the head, it brought back a vague sense of his memories of Elizabeth, and, in his confused state, he imagined the driver of the car who hit him as Elizabeth and strangled the woman to death.\n\nAt the warehouse, Elizabeth finds the painting and the body of the driver in the trunk of the car. Simon gives Elizabeth the painting and then douses the car in fuel. Because Franck is still zip-tied to the steering wheel, Elizabeth begs Simon to not set the car on fire, but to no avail. While the fuel ignites and Franck struggles to free himself, Elizabeth runs away. She returns in a truck, which she drives into Simon, pinning him against the car. Both Simon and the car in which Franck is trapped are pushed through the wall of the warehouse and into a river. Franck manages to escape, and it is implied that Simon is killed. Elizabeth makes sure Franck is alright before she disappears.\n\nSometime later, Franck is swimming in his apartment while thinking of Elizabeth. A package is delivered, and inside he finds an [[iPad]] that contains a video of Elizabeth, who has the painting hanging on the wall behind her. She reveals that, when she hypnotized Simon to make him forget her, she also hypnotized him to steal a painting for her to pay her back for his abuse, which is why Simon broke his agreement with Franck, and it is shown that the text message Simon received before being hit by the car was from Elizabeth and told him to deliver the painting to her. Elizabeth tells Franck that he can try to find her and recover the painting, or he can open an app on the iPad called \"Trance\", and a recording of her voice will erase her and the whole ordeal from his memory\u2013the choice to remember or forget is his. Franck is shown debating whether to press the button as the screen cuts to black.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Rembrandt Christ in the Storm on the Lake of Galilee.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt's]] ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee|Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'' (1633), a painting Simon uses to introduce and frame the film, drawing attention to the central self-portrait of Rembrandt, who calmly stares out at the viewer while chaos rages around him.]]\n<!-- Cast list as Credited in Film End Credits -->\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Simon Newton\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Franck\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Elizabeth Lamb\n* [[Danny Sapani]] as Nate\n* Matt Cross as Dominic\n* Wahab Sheikh as Riz\n* Mark Poltimore (7th [[Baron Poltimore]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/62787/Sotheby-s-to-sell-original-receipt-for-Goya-painting-in-Danny-Boyle-s-art-heist-movie-Trance#.U6A_f1Oa98F|title=Sotheby's to sell original receipt for Goya painting in Danny Boyle's art heist movie ''Trance''|date=24 May 2013|publisher=Royalville Communications, Inc|access-date=17 June 2014}}</ref> as Francis Lemaitre\n* [[Tuppence Middleton]] as Young Woman in Red Car\n* [[Simon Kunz]] as Surgeon\n* [[Michael Shaeffer]] as Security Guard #1\n* Tony Jayawardena as Security Guard #2\n* Vincent Montuel as Handsome Waiter\n* Jai Rajani as Car Park Attendant\n* Spencer Wilding as 60's Robber\n* Gursharan Chaggar as Postman\n* Edward Rising as 60's Auctioneer\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAfter director [[Danny Boyle]] filmed ''[[Shallow Grave (1994 film)|Shallow Grave]]'' in 1994, [[Joe Ahearne]] sent the director his screenplay for ''Trance'', seeking Boyle's encouragement.
