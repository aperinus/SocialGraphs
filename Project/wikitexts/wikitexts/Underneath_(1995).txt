The film is based on the novel ''Criss Cross'' by Don Tracy, and is a [[remake]] of the original [[Criss Cross (film)|1949 film adaptation]]. The plot revolves around many themes common to [[film noir]], including romantic intrigue, a botched robbery, and a surprise ending.\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Chambers returns home to celebrate his mother's remarriage. Michael had fled his hometown due to gambling indiscretions and had left his wife Rachel to deal with the mess he created. He must now reassimilate into the town, renew his relationships with his family and friends (and enemies) and, most of all, seek out his ex-wife to woo her again.\n\nMichael obtains a job working for his mother's new husband as an armored car driver. He almost seems the perfect prodigal son as he finds his niche back in the community and his way back into his ex-wife's heart. His troubles increase when he and Rachel are caught in the act by her hoodlum boyfriend, Dundee. To get out of this predicament, Michael must concoct a plan to steal a payroll being transported by his armored car company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Peter Gallagher]] as Michael Chambers \n*[[Alison Elliott]] as Rachel \n*[[William Fichtner]] as Tommy Dundee \n*Adam Trese as David Chambers \n*[[Joe Don Baker]] as Clay Hinkle \n*[[Paul Dooley]] as Ed Dutton\n*[[Shelley Duvall]] as Blake\n*[[Elisabeth Shue]] as Susan Crenshaw \n*[[Anjanette Comer]] as Mrs. Chambers \n*[[Dennis Hill]] as Tom \n*[[Harry Goaz]] as Casey \n*Mark Feltch as George \n*Jules Sharp as Hinkle's assistant \n*Kenneth D.
