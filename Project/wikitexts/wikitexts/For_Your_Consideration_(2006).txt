It was co-written by Guest and [[Eugene Levy]], and both also star in the film. The film's title is a phrase used in trade advertisements to promote films for honors such as the [[Academy Award]]s. The plot revolves around a group of three actors who learn that their performances in the fictional film they have not even completed yet, ''Home for Purim'', a drama set in the mid-1940s [[Southern United States|American South]], are supposedly generating a great deal of award-season buzz.\n\nMany in the cast appeared in Guest's previous films ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best in Show]]'', and ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'', including Levy, [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Parker Posey]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Fred Willard]], [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Jane Lynch]], [[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Michael Hitchcock]], [[John Michael Higgins]] and [[Jim Piddock]]. [[Ricky Gervais]], the co-creator of the original British television series ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]],'' also appears, while [[Paul Dooley]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Richard Kind]], [[Scott Adsit]], and [[Sandra Oh]] make brief cameos. Though the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors as in Guest's earlier films, the format is a departure from the [[mockumentary]] style.\n\nThe film received its World Premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 10, 2006.<ref name=Evans2006>{{Citation\n | title = For Your Consideration premiere at TIFF\n | url = http://www.digitalhit.com/galleries/23/388/\n | year = 2006\n | author = Evans, Ian\n | access-date = 2009-12-02\n}}</ref> It was produced by [[Warner Independent Pictures]] in association with [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] and [[Shangri-La Entertainment]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film follows the production of ''Home for Purim'', a low-budget drama film about a Jewish family in the southern United States in the 1940s. The cast consists of [[character actress]] Marilyn Hack as the family's dying matriarch; veteran actor turned [[kosher]] hot dog mascot Victor Allen Miller as her husband; ''[[ing\u00e9nue]]'' Callie Webb as their lesbian daughter, whose return home with her girlfriend serves as the driving plot of ''Home for Purim''; and Brian Chubb, who is dating Webb, as their son.\n\nThe film's director constantly incorporates bizarre camera shots and acting notes, while the producer, heiress to a diaper service, knows nothing about producing films. The two screenwriters are at odds with the director, as they struggle to align the film's period Southern setting with incongruous Jewish references and words.\n \nWhen an unattributed rumor begins to circulate that Hack, Miller, and Webb are likely to receive Oscar nominations for the film, each begins obsessing about the award. Hack pretends not to care while secretly pining for the award, Miller demands a higher salary and pushes his agent for more dignified work, and Webb breaks up with Chubb. Later, the hosts of entertainment news program ''Hollywood Now'' visit the set and interview the cast.\n\nThe studio intervenes in the production of ''Home for Purim'' and, deeming the film to be \"too Jewish,\" re-title it ''Home for Thanksgiving''. Despite this, the Oscar buzz around the film intensifies, and the three prospective nominees begin to make press appearances to promote the film. Miller appears on a hip-hop teen show called ''Chillaxin''' in youthful attire with capped teeth, a tan, and dyed blonde hair. Hack gets [[breast implant]]s and extensive [[plastic surgery]] to the point where her face is comically ecstatic. Webb goes on a [[shock jock]] radio show, only to field questions exclusively about her [[Nudity in film|nude scenes]].\n\nThe Academy Award nominations are announced, and only Chubb (who sleeps through the morning of the announcement) is nominated. Miller returns to auditioning for commercials. Webb attempts to revive her failed [[one-woman show]], ''No Penis Intended''. Hack makes a drunken rant on ''Hollywood Now'' and becomes an acting teacher, having uncomfortably made peace with her mediocre career.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Catherine O'Hara]] as Marilyn Hack\n*[[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Sandy Lane\n*[[Eugene Levy]] as Morley Orfkin\n*[[Harry Shearer]] as Victor Allan Miller\n*[[Christopher Guest]] as Jay Berman\n*[[John Michael Higgins]] as Corey Taft\n*[[Jim Piddock]] as Simon Whitset\n*[[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Whitney Taylor Brown\n*[[Parker Posey]] as Callie Webb\n*[[Rachael Harris]] as Debbie Gilchrist\n*[[Christopher Moynihan]] as Brian Chubb\n*[[Paul Dooley]] as Paper Badge Sgt.\n*[[John Krasinski]] as Paper Badge Officer\n*[[Don Lake]] as \"Love It\" critic Ben Lilly\n*[[Michael Hitchcock]] as \"Hate It\" critic David van Zyverdan\n*[[Sandra Oh]] as Marketing Person\n*[[Richard Kind]] as Marketing Person\n*[[Bob Balaban]] as Philip Koontz\n*[[Michael McKean]] as Lane Iverson\n*[[Ari Graynor]] as Young PA\n*[[Scott Adsit]] as First AD\n*[[Simon Helberg]] as Junior Agent\n*[[Kevin Sussman]] as Commercial Director\n*[[Fred Willard]] as Chuck\n*[[Jane Lynch]] as Cindy\n*[[Jordan Black (actor)|Jordan Black]] as Whitney's Assistant \n*[[Nina Conti]] as Weather Woman\n*[[Mary McCormack]] as Pilgrim Woman\n*[[Shawn Christian]] as Pilgrim Man\n*[[Deborah Theaker]] as Liz Fenneman\n*[[Ricky Gervais]] as Martin Gibb\n*[[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Syd Finkleman\n*[[Craig Bierko]] as Talk Show Host\n*[[Loudon Wainwright III|Loudon Wainwright]] as Nominee Ben Connelly\n*[[Jessica St. Clair]] as Hula Balls Spokeswoman\n*[[Casey Wilson]] as Young Actress\n*[[Derek Waters]] as Young Actor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nBased on 162 reviews collected by the film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 52% of critics gave ''For Your Consideration'' a positive review, with an average rating of 5.90/10.
