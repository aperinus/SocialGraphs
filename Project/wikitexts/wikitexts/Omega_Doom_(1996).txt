The story, set in a [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian future]], concerns a robot warrior who, during a nuclear winter, plays both sides of a robot [[civil war]] in a small town. The film is mostly based on ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' by [[Akira Kurosawa]], and it was the third movie in Pyun's \"[[Cyborg (film)|''Cyborg'' Trilogy]]\". It is considered a [[cult film]].<ref>[http://www.dvdempire.com/8817/omega-doom-blind-fury-movie.html Omega Doom/Blind Fury] [[DVD Empire]]</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{quote box\n |title = Opening quote\n |quote = <poem>And death shall have no dominion.\nDead men naked, they shall be one ... \nwith the man in the wind and the west moon.\nWhen their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone ... \nthey shall have stars at elbow and feet.\nThough they go mad, they shall be sane.\nThough they sink through the sea, they shall rise again.\nThough lovers be lost, love shall not.\nAnd death shall have no dominion. ...</poem>\n |source = \u2014From the poem ''[[And death shall have no dominion]]'' by [[Dylan Thomas]] (narrated by Rutger Hauer)\n |align = center\n |width = 600px\n |border = 1px\n |fontsize = 75%\n |salign = right\n}}\n\nAt the end of a [[World War]] between humans and robots, a [[nuclear bomb]] was detonated and a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] begun, without technology or electricity. On the last day of the war, as the nuclear bombs are detonating, one of the robots, Omega Doom, is shot in his head by a dying soldier. The shot causes Doom's programming for the destruction of mankind to be erased. After the world was cleared of humanity by the cyborgs, only the cyborgs and robots remain. Some time later, Omega Doom arrives at a destroyed city, where he encounters an unusual community of robots and roms (newer and more advanced robots), who are in conflict.\n\nAt the city Omega Doom finds there are two remaining peaceful robots - a former nanny who now works as a bartender and the head of a former teacher, whom the other robots use as a ball. Omega Doom helps The Head find a body and tells Doom about a rumored stock of hidden weapons. Both the robots and the roms want these weapons in order to continue the destruction of the remaining humans.\n\nEventually, Omega Doom gets the robots to promise to destroy the roms in exchange for half of the weapons; but he also proposes the same deal to the roms. The robots and the roms end up fighting each other, ensuring their mutual destruction. Afterwards, Doom leaves the last two peaceful robots (The Bartender and The Head) and the one remaining rom in charge of the city and continues his wandering.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Omega Doom\n* [[Anna Katarina]] as The Bartender\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as The Head\n* [[Shannon Whirry]] as Zed, Droid Leader\n* Simon Poland as Zed Too, Droid\n* Jahi Zuri as Marko, Droid\n* Earl White as Titus, Droid\n* Tina Cot\u00e9 as Blackheart, Rom Leader\n* Jill Pierce as Zinc, Rom\n* Cynthia Ireland as Ironface, Rom\n* Jozef Apolen as The Scientist\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n[[Christopher Lambert]] was considered for the lead role before Rutger Hauer was cast.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe screenplay written by Albert Pyun and Ed Naha was originally set in [[Paris]], at [[EuroDisney]].
