After a complex and brutal [[bank robbery]], they are being hunted by the Paris police. The hunt is led by the sadistic cop Christini ([[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]]), who only has one goal: to catch Dobermann at any cost. He manages to catch gang member Olivier, who is also a transvestite named Sonia. Christini threatens to kill Olivier's baby if he does not help him to catch the gang. Olivier has no choice and visits a party in a disco where the other gang members celebrate their robbery. He informs Christini with an alarm transmitter that all gang members are here so the police start a raid.\nAfter a gun fight the police arrest several members of the gang but some manage to escape, including Dobermann, who flees into a hidden basement which also has monitoring screens to show what happens in the disco.\nAs Christini kills Pitbull and abducts Nat with a car to rape her, Dobermann leaves his hiding place and follows him in a stolen ambulance. He overtakes Christini and manages to wrestle him down in the car. Dobermann grinds the head of Christini on the road while still driving the car at high speed as revenge for the killed friends. Christini is left heavily disfigured on the road, presumably dying.\nThe surviving gang members are able to escape and bury Sonia (the personage), suggesting that her treason results in Olivier having to drop his transvestite role. As they leave the scene in their cabrio a police helicopter is shown following them, with their car in its sights.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Christini\n*[[Vincent Cassel]] as Yann Lepentrec \"Dobermann\"\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as Nat the Gypsy\n*[[Antoine Basler]] as Jean-Claude Ayache \"Moustique\"\n*{{ill|Dominique Bettenfeld|fr|Dominique Bettenfeld}} as Elie Frossard dit l'Abb\u00e9\n* [[Marc Duret]] as Inspecteur Baumann\n*[[Florence Thomassin]] as Florence\n*[[Romain Duris]] as Manu\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Levantal]] as L\u00e9o\n\n==Sequel==\nOn May 24, 2011, ''Dobermann 2: Arm Wrestle'' was announced.
