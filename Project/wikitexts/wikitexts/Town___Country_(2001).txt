Beatty plays an architect, with Keaton as his wife, and Hawn and Shandling as their best friends. It was Beatty's and Keaton's first film together since 1981's ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]],'' and Beatty's third film with Hawn, after 1971's ''[[$ (film)|$]]'' and 1975's ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]''.\n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics and is one of the [[List of biggest box-office bombs|biggest box office flops]] in American film history, grossing a little over $10 million worldwide from a $90 million budget.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/records/budgets.php Movie Budget Records] from TheNumbers.com</ref> The film was Beatty's last appearance on screen for 15 years before he starred in ''[[Rules Don't Apply (film)|Rules Don't Apply]]'' in November 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nPorter Stoddard ([[Warren Beatty]]) is so prosperous an architect, he has New York homes on [[Park Avenue]] and in [[the Hamptons]], as well as a vacation lodge out west in [[Sun Valley, Idaho]]. He has been married for 25 years to the equally successful Ellie ([[Diane Keaton]]), an interior designer, but has been having an affair with Alex ([[Nastassja Kinski]]), a beautiful young cellist.\n\nThere is trouble brewing in the marriage of their best friends. Mona Morris ([[Goldie Hawn]]) wants a divorce from antique-dealer husband Griffin ([[Garry Shandling]]), after catching him having a hotel tryst. The part she did not catch is that Griffin's new romantic partner is a cross-dressing man. Mona wants to travel to Mississippi to see her girlhood antebellum home. Ellie is worried about Mona's depression over the state of her marriage and does not feel she should be alone, so Porter is asked to accompany Mona down south. There, they end up having a quick sexual fling.\n\nWith things awkward at home for both, Porter and Griffin fly by themselves to Sun Valley to get away from their troubles. But it is not long before Porter finds himself in a romantic entanglement with Eugenie Claybourne ([[Andie MacDowell]]), a spoiled heiress whose gun-loving father ([[Charlton Heston]]) is already loading his shotgun in case Porter does wrong by his daughter. A free spirit named Auburn ([[Jenna Elfman]]) also ends up coaxing Porter and Griffin to a Halloween party, where they end up dressed in preposterous costumes.\n\nBy the time Porter returns to New York, everything is falling apart, not only his home life but his house. And, once and for all, Griffin finds the nerve to tell his wife that he is leaving her for someone else, but it is not another woman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Warren Beatty]] as Porter Stoddard\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Ellie Stoddard\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Mona Morris\n* [[Garry Shandling]] as Griffin Morris\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Eugenie Claybourne\n* [[Jenna Elfman]] as Auburn\n* [[Nastassja Kinski]] as Alex\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Mr. Claybourne\n* [[Marian Seldes]] as Mrs. Claybourne\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as Tom Stoddard\n* Katharine Towne as Holly\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as Peter Principal\n* [[William Hootkins|Bill Hootkins]] as Barney\n* [[Terri Hoyos]] as Yolanda\n* [[Tricia Vessey]] as Alice\n* [[Azura Skye]] as Spider\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Suttler\n* [[Charlie Rose]] (archived footage) as himself\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe production costs of the film totaled an estimated US$90 million,<ref name=\"imdb_bus\">{{cite web|title=Town & Country (2001) - Box office / business|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141907/business|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031107083614/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141907/business|archive-date=7 November 2003|access-date=|website=[[IMDb]]}}</ref> not including distribution and marketing expenses.
