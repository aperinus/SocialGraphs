Westlake]], based on [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]]'s 1963 [[The Grifters (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film won the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Film]] and was declared one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 1990|Top 10 films]] of 1990 by [[National Board of Review Awards|The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nLilly Dillon is a veteran con artist. She works for Bobo Justus, a [[American Mafia|mob]] [[bookmaker]], making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots. On her way to La Jolla for a race, she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son, Roy, a small-time grifter she has not seen in eight years. She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and hit him in the stomach with a bat. When medical assistance finally comes, Lilly confronts the doctor, threatening to have him killed if her son dies.\n\nAt the hospital, Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy's girlfriend, Myra Langtry, who is slightly older than her son. Lilly urges her son to quit the grift, saying he isn't \"tough enough.\" Because she leaves late for La Jolla, she misses a race where the winner pays 70 to 1. For this mistake, Bobo punches her in the stomach and insinuates he will beat her with oranges wrapped in a towel, causing permanent damage, but at the last minute, he burns her hand with a cigar instead.\n\nMyra, like Roy and Lilly, is also a con artist. She uses her sex appeal on a jeweler to get what she wants for a bracelet she is trying to pawn, and when her landlord demands payment of late rent, she lures him into bed in lieu of paying him the money.\n\nUpon leaving the hospital, Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend. On the train, she sees him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game. Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a [[long con]]. She describes her association with a con man named Cole Langley and how they took advantage of wealthy marks in business cons, including a greedy oil investor, Gloucester Hebbing, culminating in a fake FBI raid in which Myra feigned being shot to death to discourage Hebbing from going to the police.\n\nRoy, who insists on working only short-term cons, resists the proposition, fearing she may try to dupe him. Myra, seeing Lilly's power over Roy, accuses him of having an incestuous interest in Lilly. Infuriated, Roy strikes her. Thirsty for revenge, Myra finds out Lilly has been stealing from Bobo over the years and stashing the money in the trunk of her car, and she leaks this information to him. Lilly is warned by a friend and flees. Myra follows her to a remote motel, intending to kill her there and steal the money for herself.\n\nLater, Roy is called by the Phoenix police to identify his mother's body, found in a motel room with the face disfigured by a gunshot wound. Though he tells them it is Lilly, he notices the body lacks the cigar burn that he had noticed on Lilly earlier. He returns home to find Lilly has broken in to steal his money. Lilly reveals she shot Myra in self-defense at the motel while she was trying to strangle her. She arranged the scene to appear as though Myra's body was her own and that she had committed suicide. When Roy refuses to let Lilly take his money, she desperately pleads with him, then attempts to seduce him, even claiming that he is not really her son. Roy is disgusted and rejects her. Lilly angrily swings a briefcase at Roy just as he is taking a drink of water, shattering the glass and sending shards into his neck, which cause him to bleed to death. Sobbing over her son's body, Lilly gathers up the money and disappears into the night.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Cusack]] as Roy Dillon\n* [[Anjelica Huston]] as Lilly Dillon\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Myra Langtry\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Bobo Justus\n* [[J.T.

Westlake changed his mind and agreed to write the adaptation.<ref name=\"bygrave\"/> Frears was unsuccessful, however, at convincing Westlake to write the script under his pseudonym \"Richard Stark,\" a name he had used to write 20 noir-influenced crime novels from 1962 through 1974. Westlake said that \"I got out of that one by explaining Richard Stark wasn't a member of the [[Writers Guild of America|Writer's Guild]].

Cusack has said that he saw the character of Roy Dillon as \"a wonderfully twisted role to dive into.\"<ref name=\"van gelder\"/> To research his role, he studied with real grifters and learned card and dice tricks as well as sleight-of-hand tricks like the $20 switch that his character does in the film.

After completing the final scene between Lilly and Roy, she was so drained from the experience that she ran from the set and the studio.
