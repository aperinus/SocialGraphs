It was produced by [[Goskino]] via the [[Mosfilm]] production unit, with [[Nikolay Konstantinovich Cherkasov|Nikolai Cherkasov]] in the title role and a musical score by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. ''Alexander Nevsky'' was the first and most popular of Eisenstein's three sound films.

In the face of resistance by the [[boyar]]s and merchants of Novgorod (urged on by the monk Ananias), Nevsky rallies the common people of Novgorod and in a decisive [[Battle of the Ice]], on the surface of the frozen [[Lake Peipsi-Pihkva|Lake Chudskoe]], they defeat the Teutonic knights. The story ends in the retaken Pskov, where the ordinary foot-soldiers are set free, the surviving Teutonic knights will be held for ransom, and Tverdilo is swarmed over by the vengeful people (and supposedly torn to pieces).\n\nA subplot throughout the film concerns [[Vassily Buslayev|Vasili Buslai]] and Gavrilo Oleksich, two famous warriors from Novgorod and friends, who become commanders of the Novgorod forces and who engage in a contest of courage and fighting skill throughout the Battle on the Ice in order to decide which of them will win the hand of Olga Danilovna, a Novgorod maiden whom both of them are courting. Vasilisa, the daughter of a boyar of Pskov killed by the Germans, joins the Novgorod forces as a front-line soldier, and she and Vasili fight side by side (which makes a strong impression on Vasili); she also personally slays the traitor Ananias. After both Gavrilo and Vasili have been seriously wounded, Vasili publicly states that neither he nor Gavrilo was the bravest in battle: that honor goes to Vasilisa, and that after her came Gavrilo. Thus Gavrilo and Olga are united, while Vasili chooses Vasilisa as his bride-to-be (with her unspoken consent).\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Nikolay Cherkasov]] as Prince [[Alexander Nevsky]]\n* [[Nikolay Okhlopkov]] as [[Vasily Buslayev|Vasili Buslaev]]\n* [[Andrei Abrikosov]] as Gavrilo Oleksich\n* Dmitry Orlov as Ignat, the master armorer\n* [[Vasili Novikov]] as Pavsha, a [[voivode]] of Pskov\n* [[Nikolai Arsky]] as Domash Tverdislavich, a Novgorod boyar\n* [[Varvara Massalitinova]] as Amelfa Timoferevna, Buslay's Mother\n* [[Valentina Ivashova]] as Olga Danilovna, a maid of Novgorod\n* [[Aleksandra Danilova (disambiguation)|Aleksandra Danilova]] as Vasilisa, a maid of Pskov\n* [[Vladimir Yershov]] as [[Hermann Balk|Hermann von Balk]], the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order\n* [[Sergei Blinnikov]] as Tverdilo, the traitor of Pskov\n* Ivan Lagutin as Anani, a Monk\n* [[Lev Fenin]] as the Archbishop\n* [[Naum Rogozhin]] as the Black-Hooded Monk\n\n==1930s political context==\n[[File:Nevski7.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Alexander ([[Nikolay Cherkasov]]) declines a Mongol ambassador's offer to join the [[Golden Horde]]]]\n\nEisenstein made ''Alexander Nevsky'', his first completed film in 10 years, during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u20131953)|Stalinist era]], at a time of [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941|strained relations]] between the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]].

The concerts were quite popular, because Prokofiev's music is badly degraded by the original soundtrack recording, which suffers from extreme [[distortion]] and limited [[frequency response]], as well as cuts to the original score to fit scenes that had already been shot.

The film was cleared, the film studio logo was added, the captions were replaced (only the font, but not the content), the music was re-recorded by Emin Khatchatourian conducting the [[State Symphony Cinema Orchestra]].\n\nIn 1995, a new edition of the film was issued on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]], for which Prokofiev's score was entirely re-recorded in [[hi-fi]] [[Digital data|digital]] stereo by [[Yuri Temirkanov]] conducting the [[St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Chorus, although the dialogue portions of the soundtrack were left unchanged. This enabled a new generation to experience Eisenstein's film and Prokofiev's score in high fidelity, rather than having to settle for the badly recorded musical portion that had existed since the film's original release.
