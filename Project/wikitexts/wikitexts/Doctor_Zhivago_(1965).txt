The story is set in Russia during [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Civil War]]. The film stars [[Omar Sharif]] in the title role as Yuri Zhivago, a married physician and poet whose life is altered by the [[Russian Revolution]] and subsequent civil war, and [[Julie Christie]] as his love interest Lara Antipova. [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tom Courtenay]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Alec Guinness]], [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Siobh\u00e1n McKenna]], and [[Rita Tushingham]] play supporting roles.\n\nWhile immensely popular in the [[Western world|West]], Pasternak's book was banned in the [[Soviet Union]] for decades. For this reason, the film could not be made in the Soviet Union and was instead filmed mostly in Spain. It was an international co-production between [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and Italian producer [[Carlo Ponti]].\n\nContemporary critics were critical of its length at over three hours and claimed that it trivialized history, but acknowledged the intensity of the love story and the film's treatment of human themes. At the [[38th Academy Awards]], ''Doctor Zhivago'' won five Oscars: [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. It was nominated for five others (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]), but lost four of these five to ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. It also won five awards at the [[23rd Golden Globe Awards]] including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama|Best Motion Picture - Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama]] for Sharif.\n\n{{as of|2022}}, it is the eighth [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada]], adjusted for ticket-price inflation. It is also one of the top ten [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation|highest-grossing films worldwide]] after adjusting for inflation. In 1998, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] 39th on their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|100 Years... 100 Movies]] list,<ref>[http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies.aspx ''AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529012109/http://www.afi.com/100Years/movies.aspx |date=29 May 2015 }} (1998).

Retrieved 27 August 2016</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Part one===\n\nThe film is set against a backdrop of World War I, the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], and the [[Russian Civil War]]. A narrative [[framing device]], set in the late 1940s or early 1950s, involves [[NKVD]] Lieutenant General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago searching for the daughter of his half-brother, Dr Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago, and Larissa (\"Lara\") Antipova. Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tanya Komarova, may be his niece and tells her the story of her father's life.\n\nAfter his mother's burial in rural Russia, the orphaned child Yuri Zhivago is taken in by family friends in [[Moscow]]: Alexander and Anna Gromeko. In 1913, Zhivago, now a doctor but a poet at heart, is reunited with the Gromeko's daughter, Tonya, when she returns to Moscow after her schooling in [[Paris]]. They soon become engaged.\n\nLara, only 17 years, is seduced by her mother's much older friend/lover, the well-connected Victor Ippolitovich Komarovsky. One night, Lara's friend, the idealistic reformer Pasha Antipov, is wounded by sabre-wielding [[Cossack]] [[mounted police]] during an attack on a peaceful demonstration. Pasha goes to Lara, whom he wishes to marry, and she treats his wound. He asks her to hide a gun he picked up at the attack.\n\n[[File:Doctor Zhivago (film)-The Cossacks attack a peaceful demonstration.jpg|thumb|left|Tsarist [[Cossacks#Cossacks between 1900 and 1917|Cossacks]] attack a peaceful demonstration]]\n\nAfter learning of her daughter's affair with Komarovsky, Lara's mother attempts suicide. Komarovsky summons his doctor friend, who brings along Zhivago as his apprentice. Komarovsky attempts to dissuade Lara from marrying Pasha. When she refuses, he pressures her into sex. Enraged, Lara later takes Pasha's gun and follows Komarovsky to a Christmas party. She shoots him, wounding his arm. Komarovsky insists no action be taken against Lara, and she is escorted out by Pasha, who followed her to the party; meanwhile, Zhivago, who is another party guest, treats Komarovsky's wound. Although devastated by Lara's admission about her and Komarovsky, Pasha marries her, and they eventually have a daughter, Katya.\n\nDuring World War I, Yevgraf Zhivago is sent by the [[Bolsheviks]] to subvert the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Yuri, now married to Tonya, is drafted to be a battlefield doctor. Pasha, unsatisfied in his marriage to Lara, joins up, but is reported missing in action following an attack on German forces. Lara enlists as a nurse to search for him. Yuri encounters Lara, and takes her on as his nurse. For the next six months, they serve at a field hospital, during which time radical changes ensue throughout Russia as [[Vladimir Lenin]] returns from exile to Moscow. Before their departure from the hospital, Zhivago and Lara fall in love, though Zhivago remains faithful to Tonya.\n\nAfter the war, Yuri returns to Tonya, their son Alexander (Sasha), and the now-widowed Alexander Gromeko. They are still living in what had been their Moscow house, but it has been confiscated by the new Soviet government and divided into tenements. Yevgraf, now a member of the [[Cheka]], informs Yuri that his poems have been condemned as antagonistic to [[communism]]. Fearing Zhivago will ultimately incriminate himself through his poetry, Yevgraf provides Yuri documents to leave Moscow and travel to the Gromekos' country home, \"Varykino\", located in the [[Ural Mountains]]. The family boards a heavily guarded freight train, bound to be traveling through contested territory that is secured by the Bolshevik commander, Strelnikov, formerly known as Pasha Antipov.\n\n=== Part two ===\n[[File:Trailer-Doctor Zhivago-Yevgraf and Tonya Komarovskaya.jpg|thumb|right|Yevgraf ([[Alec Guinness]], right) with Tanya ([[Rita Tushingham]])]]\nWhile the train makes a mid-journey stop, Yuri gets out. He inadvertently wanders too closely to Strelnikov's armored train on a nearby track. He is captured by guards and taken to Strelnikov. During the intense interrogation, Yuri recognizes Strelnikov as Pasha. Strelnikov mentions that Lara is living in Yuriatin, where Yuri is headed and which is occupied by the anti-Communist [[White Army|White]] forces. Strelnikov deems Yuri a non-threat and allows him to return to the train. The family settles into a cottage on the Varykino estate. While in Yuriatin, Yuri sees Lara, and they surrender to their long-repressed passions. Tonya is pregnant again and when she is about to give birth, Yuri travels to Yuriatin to break it off with Lara. On his return, he is abducted by the Communist partisans and forced to join their field medical service.\n\nAfter two years, Yuri deserts the partisans. Amid great hardship, he makes it back to Yuriatin, arriving exhausted, ill, and suffering from frostbite. He goes to Lara, who cares for him. She says Tonya had contacted her while searching for Yuri. Leaving his belongings with Lara, she returned to Moscow. She had sent Lara a sealed letter to give Yuri if he returned. The letter is six months old. Tonya had given birth to a daughter named Anna, and she, her father, and her two children were deported and are living in Paris.\n\nYuri and Lara become lovers again. One night Komarovsky arrives and warns that Cheka agents have been watching them due to Lara's marriage to Strelnikov. Komarovsky offers her and Yuri help in leaving Russia, but he is promptly refused. They return to the abandoned Varykino estate, and hide in the state-confiscated main house. Yuri begins writing the \"Lara\" poems, which will later bring him popular fame but government disapproval. Komarovsky arrives with a small party of troops. Recently appointed as a regional official in the [[Far Eastern Republic]], he informs Yuri that the Cheka only allowed Lara to remain in the area to lure Strelnikov. He was captured five miles away and committed suicide while en route to his execution. They now intend to arrest Lara. Yuri accepts Komarovsky's offer of safe passage for himself, Lara, and her daughter. However, once Lara is safely on her way, Yuri instead stays behind, although he had said that he would follow in their carriage. Yuri runs to the top of the Varykino main house and watches them from a window ride off in the distance. On the train, Lara tells Komarovsky that she is pregnant with Yuri's child.\n\nYears later in Moscow during the [[Stalinist era]], Yevgraf procures a medical job for his destitute, frail half-brother. While looking out of the tram's window, Yuri spots Lara walking on the street. Unable to attract her attention, he struggles to get off at the next stop. He runs after her but suffers a fatal heart attack before reaching her. Yuri's funeral is well-attended, despite his poetry being banned. Lara approaches Yevgraf at the graveside and asks for his help to find her and Yuri's daughter, who was lost during the civil war. Yevgraf helps her search the orphanages, but they are unable to locate her. Lara disappears and Yevgraf believes she must have died in one of the [[gulag|labour camps]].\n\nWhile Yevgraf still believes that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara's daughter, she remains unconvinced. After persistently being asked how she came to be lost, Tanya finally answers that her \"father\" had let go of her hand when they were running from the war's chaos. Yevgraf responds that a real father would not have let go. Tanya promises to consider what Yevgraf has told her. As she is about to leave with her fianc\u00e9, Yevgraf notices Tanya's [[balalaika]], the same instrument which Yuri's mother was gifted at playing. When Yevgraf asks if Tanya can play it, her fianc\u00e9 declares \"Can she play? She's an artist!\" and adding that she is self-taught, thus suggesting she might well be Yuri's daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as [[Yuri Zhivago|Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago]]\n** Tarek Sharif as young Yuri\n* [[Julie Christie]] as Larissa Ameliava \"Lara\" Antipova\n* [[Geraldine Chaplin]] as Tonya Gromeko\n** Pamella Carrington-Coutte and Mercedes Ruiz as young Tonya<!--Edit note: two different children played this part-->\n* [[Rod Steiger]] as Victor Ippolitovich Komarovsky\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago\n* [[Tom Courtenay]] as Pavel \"Pasha\" Antipov / Strelnikov\n* [[Siobh\u00e1n McKenna]] as Anna Gromeko\n* [[Ralph Richardson]] as Alexander Maximovich Gromeko\n* [[Rita Tushingham]] as Tanya Komarova\n* Jeffrey Rockland as Sasha Antipov\n* [[Klaus Kinski]] as Kostoyed Amoursky\n* [[Bernard Kay]] as Kuril\n* [[G\u00e9rard Tichy]] as Liberius Mikulitsyn\n* [[Jack MacGowran]] as Petya\n* [[Noel Willman]] as Razin\n* [[Geoffrey Keen]] as Professor Boris Kurt\n* [[Adrienne Corri]] as Amelia\n* [[Mark Eden]] as Bakunin\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\n[[Boris Pasternak]]'s novel was published in the West amidst celebration and controversy. Parts of Pasternak's book had been known in [[Samizdat]] since some time after World War II. However, the novel was not completed until 1956. The book had to be smuggled out of the [[Soviet Union]] by an Italian called D'Angelo to be delivered to [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], a left-wing Italian publisher who published it shortly thereafter, in 1957. Helped by a Soviet campaign against the novel, it became a sensation throughout the non-communist world. It spent 26 weeks atop [[The New York Times best-seller list|''The New York Times'' best-seller list]].\n\nPasternak was awarded the 1958 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. While the citation noted his poetry, it was speculated that the prize was mainly for ''Doctor Zhivago'', which the Soviet government saw as an anti-Soviet work, thus interpreting the award of the Nobel Prize as a gesture hostile to the Soviet Union. A target of the Soviet government's fervent campaign to label him a traitor, Pasternak felt compelled to refuse the Prize. The situation became an international ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' and made Pasternak a [[Cold War]] symbol of resistance to Soviet communism.\n\n===Development and casting===\nThe film treatment by David Lean was proposed for various reasons. Pasternak's novel had been an international success, and producer [[Carlo Ponti]] was interested in adapting it as a vehicle for his wife, [[Sophia Loren]]. Lean, coming off the huge success of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), wanted to make a more intimate, romantic film to balance the action- and adventure-oriented tone of his previous film. One of the first actors signed onboard was [[Omar Sharif]], who had played Lawrence's right-hand man Sherif Ali in ''Lawrence of Arabia''. Sharif loved the novel, and when he heard Lean was making a film adaptation, he requested to be cast in the role of Pasha (which ultimately went to [[Tom Courtenay]]).\n\nSharif was quite surprised when Lean suggested that he play Zhivago. [[Peter O'Toole]], star of ''Lawrence of Arabia'', was Lean's original choice for Zhivago, but turned the part down; [[Max von Sydow]] and [[Paul Newman]] also were considered. [[Rod Taylor]] was offered the role but turned it down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rodtaylorsite.com/unfilmed.shtml|title = The Complete Rod Taylor Site: Not Starring Rod Taylor}}</ref> [[Michael Caine]] tells in his autobiography that he also read for Zhivago and participated in the screen shots with Christie, but (after watching the results with David Lean) was the one who suggested Omar Sharif.<ref name=Caine>{{cite book|last=Caine|first=Michael|title=What's It All About?|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0345386809|edition=1st U.S. Ballantine Books ed.

[[Audrey Hepburn]] was considered for Tonya, and [[Robert Bolt]] lobbied for [[Albert Finney]] to play Pasha.\n\nLean convinced Ponti that Loren was not right for the role of Lara, saying she was \"too tall\" (and confiding in screenwriter Robert Bolt that he could not accept Loren as a virgin for the early parts of the film), and [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Yvette Mimieux]], [[Sarah Miles]] and [[Jane Fonda]] were considered for the role.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&q=jeanne+moreau+dr+zhivago+considered&pg=PA73|title = Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others|isbn = 9781476609768|last1 = Mell|first1 = Eila|date = 24 January 2015}}</ref> Ultimately, [[Julie Christie]] was cast based on her appearance in ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' (1963) and the recommendation of [[John Ford]], who directed her in ''[[Young Cassidy]]'' (1965). Sharif's son Tarek was cast as the young Zhivago, and Sharif directed his son as a way to get closer to his character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/129/Doctor-Zhivago/articles.html|title=Doctor Zhivago (1965) - Articles - TCM.com|work=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=10 March 2016|archive-date=2 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102054334/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/129/Doctor-Zhivago/articles.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Presa de Aldead\u00e1vila.jpg|thumb|The opening and closing scenes were filmed on location at the [[Aldead\u00e1vila Dam]] between Spain and Portugal.]]  \nBecause the book was banned in the Soviet Union, it could not be filmed there.

Most of the scenes covering Zhivago's and Lara's service in World War I were filmed in Soria, as was the Varykino estate.  The \"ice-palace\" at Varykino was filmed in Soria as well, a house filled with frozen beeswax. The charge of the partisans across the frozen lake was also filmed in Spain; a cast iron sheet was placed over a dried river-bed, and fake snow (mostly marble dust) was added on top. Some of the winter scenes were filmed in summer with warm temperatures, sometimes of up to 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (77&nbsp;\u00b0F). Other locations include [[Railway Museum (Madrid)|Madrid-Delicias railway station]] in Madrid and the [[Moncayo Range]].<ref>{{cite web|website=[[Railway Museum (Madrid)|Railway Museum]]|title=Silence, we're rolling!|url=http://www.museodelferrocarril.org/140Delicias/panels/panel14.asp|access-date=June 20, 2020|archive-date=22 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622161708/http://www.museodelferrocarril.org/140Delicias/panels/panel14.asp|url-status=live}}</ref> The initial and final scenes were shot at the [[Aldead\u00e1vila Dam]] between Spain and Portugal. Although uncredited, most of those scenes were shot on the Portuguese side of the river, overlooking the Spanish side.\n\nOther winter sequences, mostly landscape scenes and Yuri's escape from the partisans, were filmed in Finland. Winter scenes of the family traveling to Yuriatin by rail were filmed in Canada. The locomotives seen in the film are Spanish locomotives like the [[Renfe Operadora|RENFE]] Class 240 (ex-1400 MZA), and Strelnikov's armoured train is towed by the RENFE Class 141F [[2-8-2|Mikado locomotive]].\n\nOne train scene became notorious for the supposed fate that befell [[:hu:Mur\u00e1ti Lili|Lili Mur\u00e1ti]], a Hungarian actress, who slipped clambering onto a moving train.
