Told in narrative [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s set in a police interrogation, the film centers on a woman implicated in the violent murder of her friend's abusive, drug-addicted husband. Its title is derived from a quote in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth|The Tragedy of Macbeth]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nCynthia Kellogg is interrogated by Detective John Woods and Detective Linda Nealon at a police station regarding the murder of her husband, Artie. Cynthia provides a [[deposition (law)|deposition]], relayed in detailed [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. Cynthia recounts her employment as a hairdresser at her friend Joyce's [[Bayonne, New Jersey]] hair salon. Joyce's husband, Jimmy, is a violently abusive drug addict, and Joyce expresses a desire to kill him several times. One night, Cynthia accompanies Joyce and Jimmy to a Feast of [[Saint Roch|Saint Rocco]] festival. After Jimmy becomes drunk and picks a fight with Joyce, he heads back to their van. Cynthia follows him and takes the keys, leaving him to sleep in the back of the vehicle.\n\nPer Cynthia's account of events, the two women returned to the van later on to find Jimmy dead inside, his throat slashed; Cynthia claims Joyce admitted to cutting his neck after she went to check on him, during which he attacked her. According to Cynthia, at Joyce's insistence, the women disposed of Jimmy's body by dumping it in a ravine. After the murder, Cynthia returns home covered in blood and admits to her husband, Artie, what happened. Several days later, after Jimmy's body is found, Joyce's paranoia about being caught causes her to act increasingly erratically. At one point, she instructs Cynthia to kill one of the hairdressers at the salon out of fear she will tarnish the women's alibis. Joyce subsequently discovers that Artie knows about the murder, and she threatens to Cynthia that she will kill him to silence him. Cynthia does not believe Joyce can actually carry out her threats; however, after Artie is found shot dead at his home on [[Christmas Eve]], Cynthia accuses Joyce.\n\nThroughout Cynthia's interrogation, Detective Woods is skeptical of her descriptions of events and challenges her on them, but ultimately allows her to leave. Cynthia exits the police station, but pauses and recounts the details of what actually happened at the festival: Upon bringing Jimmy to the van, he attempted to rape Cynthia, and began beating her. In self-defense, she slashed his throat with a boxcutter. Cynthia and Joyce left the festival and began driving toward a hospital; however, when Joyce realized he tried to rape Cynthia, she turned the van around and began driving in another direction, biding time while Jimmy bled to death in the back of the van. After he died, the women disposed of his body and made a pact not to tell anyone.\n\nAs Cynthia stands outside the police station recalling the truth of what occurred, Joyce is brought inside for her own interrogation. Cynthia decides to re-enter the station, now prepared to tell the truth of her guilt in Jimmy's death. She sits before Detective Woods' camera to record her taped confession.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Cynthia Kellogg\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as Joyce Urbanski\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as James \"Jimmy\" Urbanski\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Detective John Woods\n* [[John Pankow]] as Arthur \"Artie\" Kellogg\n* Billie Neal as Detective Linda Nealon\n* [[Frank Vincent]] and [[Doris McCarthy]] as Dominic and Jeanette, Joyce's parents\n* Karen Shallo as Gloria, James' mother\n\n==Production==\nThe film's title is derived from a quote in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth|The Tragedy of Macbeth]]'' by Lady Macbeth, in which she says: \"Come, you spirits / That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, / And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full / Of direst cruelty.\"<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/58947|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|title=Mortal Thoughts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729233054/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/58947|archive-date=July 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPrincipal photography of ''Mortal Thoughts'' occurred in February 1990.<ref name=afi/> Claude Kerven, who co-wrote the screenplay, was originally hired to direct the project, but was replaced by [[Alan Rudolph]] after completing only one week of shooting.<ref name=afi/> The film shoot was partly improvisational, and the conclusion of the film was undetermined until it came time to shoot it.<ref name=afi/> Rudolph recalled: \"No one really knew what the ending would be.
