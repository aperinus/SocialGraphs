Whilst looking for Salma late one night Lilia's transformation begins when she becomes suspicious of her teenage daughter of engaging in a secret relationship with Chokri (Maher Kamoun), a [[Goblet drum|darbouka]] drummer in Salma's dance class. To find out more, Lilia decides to follow Chokri one day. On her escapade, she follows him into his second workplace, a cabaret club. After overcoming her initial shock, Lilia becomes drawn towards the dancers and drum music. The women are very different from Lilia as they wear colourful clothing, they are showing their midriffs, and they are dancing in a sensual manner to the drumbeat. After befriending the lead dancer, Folla (Monia Hichri), Lilia is convinced to start dancing in the cabaret club. While Lilia begins dancing nightly, she simultaneously begins a romantic relationship with Chokri, who is still unaware that Lilia is Salma's mother. When Chokri ends his affair with Lilia, she is heartbroken.
