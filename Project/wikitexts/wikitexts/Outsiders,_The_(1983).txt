Some socially affluent teens harass and assault Ponyboy until some of his fellow [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] chase them off. The next night, he, Johnny and Dallas catch a movie at the local [[drive-in]], where Dallas flirts with \"Soc\" Cherry Valance. Unsuccessful, he leaves, however, Cherry invites Ponyboy and Johnny to sit with her and Marcia. Later, while walking the two teen girls home, their boyfriends, ''\"Socs\"'' Bob and Randy, take umbrage at this, so the girls leave with them to avoid any escalation.\n\nPony and Johnny walk to an abandoned lot, instead of home, so Johnny can avoid his parents' routinely volatile bickering and domestic violence. He laments the hopelessness of his young life, both domestically and within the socio-economic structures established at school. Falling asleep, Ponyboy awakens a few hours later and rushes home, fearing his elder brother's discipline, who rebukes and even strikes him. He runs off to a local park with Johnny. They climb on the jungle gym, reminiscing about their childhood until they are confronted, chased, and attacked by Bob, Randy, and three other ''Socs''. Johnny is beaten, and Pony almost drowned in the park's fountain, until Johnny stabs Bob, killing him.\n \nFearful of the legal ramifications, Ponyboy and Johnny find Dallas, who gives them money for food and a loaded gun. They flee to Windrixville, Oklahoma, hopping a train, then hiding in an abandoned church there, where they dye their hair, play poker and read ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' to each other. Four days later, Dallas visits; he has lied to the police, who are now searching in Texas. A note from his brother Sodapop exhorts Ponyboy to come home, as Cherry is willing to testify on their behalf. While buying food, Johnny favors turning themselves in, but Dallas disagrees.\n\nReturning to the church, it's on fire with children trapped inside. They rescue them but are burned, and Johnny breaks his back. Ponyboy reunites with his two older brothers in the hospital, then returns home. Their heroic deed has made the cover of the local paper, however, a judge may send Ponyboy to a boys' home.\n\nPonyboy and Two-Bit visit Johnny and Dallas in the hospital. Ponyboy asks Two-Bit to buy another copy of ''Gone with the Wind'' at the hospital gift shop. When Johnny\u2019s abusive mother comes, he refuses her visit, so she takes out her ire on Ponyboy and Two-Bit, who decries her as a bad mother. Dallas encourages them to win the upcoming rumble, sparked by Bob's death, for Johnny.\n\nLater, Ponyboy meets with Cherry about the court. She won't visit Johnny at the hospital as he killed Bob. Later that night, the greasers, including Dallas, who left the hospital, win the rumble. Afterward, Dallas drives an injured Ponyboy to the hospital to see Johnny. After Ponyboy tells him about the greasers' victory, Johnny is ambivalent and dies after telling Ponyboy to \"stay gold\".\n\nEnraged and devastated over Johnny's death, Dallas robs a store but is shot by the owner. He calls Darrell to meet him in the park and help hide him. The police arrive first, surrounding Dallas. He commits [[suicide by cop]], pointing an empty gun at them.\n\nThe judge exonerates Ponyboy for Bob's death in court and places him in Darrell's custody. Later at school, Cherry sees Ponyboy and ignores him. He is offered a passing grade by his English teacher, to write a quality, personal experience essay, but is uninspired.\n\nInside Johnny's copy of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' is a letter explaining how saving the children was worth sacrificing his life, and admonishes Ponyboy to \"never change\", thus \"stay gold.\"\n\nJohnny's letter inspires Ponyboy's essay, \"The Outsiders\". The story begins: \"When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman, and a ride home.\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- cast and roles per opening credits, order per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast list|\n* [[C.

Coppola re-inserted some [[deleted scene]]s to make the film more faithful to the book. This brought it up to a 114-minute running time. At the beginning of the film, he added scenes where Ponyboy gets stalked and jumped, the gang talks about going to the movies, Sodapop and Ponyboy talk in their room, and Dally, Pony, and Johnny bum around before going to the movies. In the end, Coppola added the scenes taking place in court, Mr. Syme talking to Ponyboy, and Sodapop, Ponyboy, and Darry in the park.\n\nCoppola's father, Carmine Coppola, had written a soaring, romantic score for the original release, which at the time Coppola felt may have been the wrong choice, but he wasn't prepared to say that to him.<ref name=Hoad/> By the time he came to recut the movie for \"The Complete Novel\" re-release his father had died, which allowed Coppola the opportunity to balance Carmine Coppola's music with music popular in the 1960s as well as new music composed by [[Michael Seifert (producer)|Michael Seifert]] and Dave Pruitt.\n\nThe film was re-rated by the [[MPAA]] as PG-13 for \"violence, teen drinking and smoking, and some sexual references\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=20050912&id=YelRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=e3IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4486,2824454&hl=en|title=St. Petersburg Times - Google News Archive Search|access-date=May 21, 2016|archive-date=May 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210526150216/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=20050912&id=YelRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=e3IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4486%2C2824454&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDisc 2 of the DVD includes some unique features, featuring behind-the-scenes interviews with the cast & crew, readings from the novel, additional deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer, and an [[NBC News]] ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' segment from 1983 talking about how ''The Outsiders'' has inspired teenagers across the world.\n\nThe director also removed three scenes that were in the theatrical version to improve pacing. Those scenes were Ponyboy and Johnny looking at their reflections in the lake and talking about their hair, attempting to catch a rabbit, and playing poker. They can be found on the second disc as additional scenes, along with other deleted scenes that were filmed, but not put into the movie. In addition, Swayze, Macchio, Lane, and Howell gathered at Coppola's estate to watch the re-release, and their [[Audio commentary|commentary]] is included on the DVD.
