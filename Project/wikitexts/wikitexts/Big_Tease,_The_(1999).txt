The documentary team (with Chris Langham playing the interviewer) follows Crawford to L.A., where he discovers that his invitation is to be a member of the audience rather than a competitor. He eventually weasels his way into the contest and produces the greatest creation of his career.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Craig Ferguson]] as Crawford Mackenzie\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Candace \"Candy\" Harper\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Monique Geingold\n* [[Chris Langham]] as Martin Samuels, BBC Interviewer\n* [[David Rasche]] as Stig Ludwigssen\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Eamonn McGarvey\n* [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] as Dunstan Cactus\n* Isabella Aitken as Mrs. Beasie Mackenzie\n* [[Kevin Allen (director)|Kevin Allen]] as Gareth Trundle\n* [[Angela McCluskey]] as Senga Magoogan\n* [[Francine York]] as Elegant Woman\n* [[Nina Siemaszko]] as Betty Fuego\n* [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Sen. Warren Crockett\n* [[Melissa Rivers]] as Dianne Abbott (credited as Melissa Rosenberg)\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as Himself\n* [[Drew Carey]] as Himself\n* [[Cathy Lee Crosby]] as Herself\n\n== Production ==\nIt was filmed on location in [[Glasgow]] and [[Los Angeles]]. The inspiration for this film came from Craig Ferguson's desire to make a cheerful film celebrating Scottishness, as opposed to the epic nature of films like ''[[Braveheart]]'' and ''[[Rob Roy (1995 film)|Rob Roy]]'', or the downbeat quality of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' and ''[[Shallow Grave (1994 film)|Shallow Grave]]''.\nThe script was snapped up by [[Warner Brothers]] after a five-day [[bidding war]].\nWarner Brothers was the only studio prepared to immediately greenlight the film. A fast turnaround was required so it could be shot while Ferguson was on hiatus from ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.\n\n''The Big Tease'' was not the only hairdressing film in development at the time; ''The Big Tease'' was released first in 1999, causing ''[[Blow Dry]]'' to be delayed until 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/film.nsf/reviews/blowdry_1|title = Blow Dry|date = 8 March 2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nIt took casting director Kris Nicolau about<!-- weasel --> five weeks to fill all seventy roles in the film.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n[[Frances Fisher]] was originally to read for the part of Monique, a role which went to Mary McCormack. Instead she opted to play Candy, the publicist.\n\nCraig Ferguson attended a hairdressing institute to learn all about the art of hairdressing. The hairpieces used in the final Platinum Scissors competition are made from real human hair. [[Acrylic fiber|Acrylic]] (which is normally used in wigs) doesn't photograph well and ends up looking like plastic. Each hairpiece weighed about {{convert|4|lb|kg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0156639|The Big Tease}}\n* {{Amg movie|180799}}\n* {{Mojo title|bigtease|The Big Tease}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|big_tease|The Big Tease}}\n\n{{Kevin Allen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Big Tease, The}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:American mockumentary films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Kevin Allen]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Craig Ferguson]]\n[[Category:1999 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
