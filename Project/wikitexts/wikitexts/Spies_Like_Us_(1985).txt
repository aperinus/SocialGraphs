Originally written by Aykroyd and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] to star Aykroyd and [[John Belushi]] at [[Universal Studios|Universal]], the script went into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] and was later picked up by [[Warner Bros.]] with Aykroyd and Chase starring.\n\nPartly filmed on location near [[Sognefjord]] in Norway (as Russia) og Sahara (as Pakistan),<ref>{{Cite web |last=DeRiso |first=Nick DeRisoNick |title=How 'Spies Like Us' Faltered When It Got to the Spy Part |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/spies-like-us-movie/ |access-date=2022-09-21 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=McGrath |first=Nick |date=2016-02-04 |title=Dan Aykroyd's Travelling Life |language=en-GB |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/celebrity-interviews/Dan-Aykroyds-Travelling-Life/ |access-date=2022-09-21 |issn=0307-1235 |quote=Favourite film location?

Hope himself cameos in one scene. Other cameos include directors [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Sam Raimi]], [[Costa-Gavras]], [[Martin Brest]], [[Frank Oz]], and [[Coen brothers|Joel Coen]], musician [[B.B. King]] and visual effects pioneer [[Ray Harryhausen]]. The film was negatively received by critics, but was a box office success and went on to become a [[cult film|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nAustin Millbarge is a code breaker dwelling in the dark basement at [[the Pentagon]] who aspires to escape his under-respected job to become a secret agent. Emmett Fitz-Hume, a wisecracking, pencil-pushing son of an envoy, takes the foreign service exam under peer pressure. Millbarge and Fitz-Hume meet during the test, on which Fitz-Hume openly attempts to cheat after an attempt to bribe his immediate supervisor in exchange for the answers backfires. Millbarge, however, was not prepared to take the test, having had only one day to study after his supervisor deliberately withheld a notice for two weeks leaving him vulnerable to fail and having to remain in the bowels of the Pentagon.\n\nNeeding two expendable agents to act as decoys to draw attention away from a more capable team, the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] decides to enlist Fitz-Hume and Millbarge, promote them to GLG-20 Foreign Service Operatives, rush them through minimal military survival training, and then send them on an undefined mission inside [[Pakistan]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]]. Meanwhile, two professional agents are well on their way to reaching the real objective: the seizure of a mobile SS-50 [[intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] launcher in Soviet territory. A member of the main team is killed, while Millbarge and Fitz-Hume manage to escape multiple enemy attacks and eventually encounter Karen Boyer, the surviving operative from the main team.\n\nIn the [[Pamir Mountains]] of the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]], the trio overpowers the mobile missile guard unit using hastily constructed extraterrestrial outfits and tranquilizer guns. Following orders in real-time from the intelligence agency (operating from the W.A.M.P. military bunker located deep under an abandoned drive-in theater), they begin to operate the launcher. At the end of their instructions, the vehicle launches the ICBM into space, targeting an unspecified area in the Continental United States. Thinking they have started a nuclear war, the American agents and their Soviet counterparts pair up to have sex before the world is destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, at the operations bunker, the military generals initiate the conversion of the drive-in theater to expose what is hidden beneath the screens and projection booth: a huge [[Black operation|black-op]] [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]]-esque laser and collector/emitter screen. The purpose of sending the agents to launch a Soviet ICBM is exposed as a means to test this [[anti-ballistic missile]] system, but the laser fails to intercept the nuclear missile. Despite this, the military commanders at W.A.M.P. choose not to inform President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the US Government that the missile launch was not initiated by the Soviet authorities, revealing a twisted contingency plan of letting the impending thermonuclear war commence to \"preserve the American way of life\".\n\nBack in the Soviet Union, horrified at the thought of having launched a nuclear missile at their own country, the American spies and the Soviet missile technicians quickly use Millbarge's technical knowledge of Source Programmable Guidance to transmit instructions to the traveling missile, diverting it off into space where it detonates harmlessly. Immediately after, the underground W.A.M.P. bunker is located and stormed by [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]], and the intelligence agents and rogue military officials involved in the covert operation are arrested. Millbarge, Fitz-Hume, and Boyer go on to become [[nuclear disarmament]] negotiators, playing a nuclear version of ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]''-meets-''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' against their new Soviet friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Emmett Fitz-Hume\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Austin Millbarge\n* [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]] as General Sline\n* [[Donna Dixon]] as Karen Boyer\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Ruby\n* [[Bernie Casey]] as Colonel Rhumbus\n* [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as Keyes\n* [[Tom Hatten]] as General Miegs\n* [[Frank Oz]] as Test Monitor\n* [[Charles McKeown]] as Jerry Hadley\n* [[James Daughton]] as Rob Hodges \n* Jim Staahl as Bud Schnelker\n* [[Vanessa Angel (English actress)|Vanessa Angel]], Svetlana Plotnikova, Bjarne Thomsen, Sergei Rousakov, and Garrick Dombrovski as Russian Rocket Crew\n* [[Terry Gilliam]] as Dr. Imhaus\n* [[Costa-Gavras]] and Seva Novgorodtsev as Tadzhik Highway Patrol\n* Stephen Hoye as Captain Hefling\n* [[Ray Harryhausen]] as Dr. Marston\n}}\n\nOther actors making appearances in minor roles include [[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]] as Fitz-Hume's Associate and [[List of people in Playboy 1980\u20131989#1981|Heidi Sorenson]] as Alice, Fitz-Hume's Supervisor.
