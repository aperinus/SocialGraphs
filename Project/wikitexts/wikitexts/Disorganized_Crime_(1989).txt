It was written and directed by [[Jim Kouf]] and released through [[Touchstone Pictures]]. The  [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Fred Gwynne]], [[Lou Diamond Phillips]], [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]], [[William Russ]], [[Corbin Bernsen]], [[Ed O'Neill]], [[Daniel Roebuck]] and [[Hoyt Axton]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins in a small town in western [[Montana]] where [[New Jersey]] based bank robber Frank Salazar has been hiding out from the law after a series of bank robberies in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].  Upon realizing that the local bank contains a large amount of cash, Salazar recruits four former accomplices to come to town and help him rob the bank.  Among them are Nick Bartkowski, a nervous and possibly alcoholic safecracker; Max Green, an old school explosives expert with a heart condition; Ray Forgy, a young, wisecracking auto thief and [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]]; and Carlos Barrios, a well-manicured lookout and weapons expert.\n\nBefore they can arrive, however, two New Jersey detectives (George Denver and Bill Lonigan) catch up with Salazar, arrest him, and extradite him back to New Jersey.  But Salazar soon escapes and becomes hopelessly lost in the Montana wilderness as he flees Denver and Lonigan's custody.\n\nUnaware of Salazar's arrest and escape, the four accomplices arrive and realize that he is nowhere to be found.  They finally decide to take down the bank on their own but must go through several humorous ordeals before they can complete their plan.  The four successfully rob the bank and escape.  Salazar is caught shortly thereafter and accused of the robbery, despite having not taken part.  Learning that his police bail has been set at $1 million, three of the four (against Bartkowski's wishes) decide to use their loot to rescue Salazar.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fred Gwynne]] as Max Green\n* [[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as Ray Forgy\n* [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] as Carlos Barrios\n* [[William Russ]] as Nick Bartkowski\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Frank Salazar\n* [[Ed O'Neill]] as Detective George Denver\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Detective Bill Lonigan\n* [[Hoyt Axton]] as Sheriff Henault\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography begin on April 22, 1988 in [[Missoula, Montana]]. During the first week of filming in Missoula, a group of Teamsters Union began picketing the set, and protest the production company's use of non-union drivers. Bitterroot Productions had hired 14 non-union drivers, most of them local residents, to move people and equipment between the sets. They first offered the jobs to Teamsters officials, but the union rejected the offer. After filming was done in Missoula, the cast and crew traveled to nearby [[Hamilton, Montana]] where most of the film is set. They spent nearly a month and a half filming in Hamilton because of the bank scenes, the court house scene at the Ravalli Country Court House and more locations in town. Finally they went out to [[Darby, Montana]] where they filmed the small house scenes where the four bank robbers hide out for their partner Salazar, the gas station scene and the river sequence where the two cops try to track down Salazar. Filming was completed shortly in late June 1988. Hoyt Axton, who plays the Sherriff, loved the Bitterroot Valley so much he purchased a ranch in the valley shortly after filming was completed. He lived there for most of the time until his death.\n\n==Release==\n''Disorganized Crime'' had its world premiere at The Roxy Theatre in Hamilton on April 8, 1989. Stars Corbin Bernsen, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ & Daniel Roebuck attended the premiere, including producer Lynn Bigelow & writer & director Jim Kouf. The premiere was a great turnout for residents of Hamilton, who attended & enjoyed seeing the actors coming back to their beloved town for the premiere. The film was released in theatres worldwide on April 14, 1989.\n\n===Reviews and reception===\nUpon release, ''Disorganized Crime'' was met with mixed and overall poor reception by top critics. Both [[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert]] gave it [[thumbs signal|thumbs down]]; reproach was aimed at the lack of detail given to the bank heist plan. They also claimed that the film relies on \"[[slapstick]] and cornball barnyard humor,\" cited its frequency of chase scenes and moments where characters fall in mud and manure. However, Ebert did credit the actions of Lou Diamond Phillips's character as a highlight.<ref>Ebert, Roger & Siskel, Gene [http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&subsec=138 Disorganized Crime]{{dead link|date=March 2015}} ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At the Movies]]'' (April 1989).

Unfortunately, I think the script was funnier than the actual film came out to be, but I think we were all on a different page. I think the director wanted to make more of an action film or a heist film than he wanted to make a comedy, and Jim Kouf \u2013 he was also the writer \u2013 I think that he shied away from the comedy of it, which is unfortunate because if we had gone that way I think the film would have been more satisfying.\"<ref>[http://www.dvdempire.com/Content/interviews/phillips.asp?userid=-1 Lou Diamond Phillips] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213003020/http://www.dvdempire.com/Content/interviews/phillips.asp?userid=-1 |date=February 13, 2012 }} DVDEmpire.com (2003).
