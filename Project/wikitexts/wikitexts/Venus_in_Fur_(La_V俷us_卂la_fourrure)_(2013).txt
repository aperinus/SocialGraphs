Early in the movie, we learn that the book begins with a quote from the [[Book of Judith]]: \"And the Lord hath smitten him and delivered him into a woman's hands.\"\n\nThe film begins with Thomas alone in a Parisian theatre after a day of auditioning actresses for the lead character, Wanda von Dunayev. Thomas laments on the phone about the poor performances he's had to deal with.\n\nAs Thomas prepares to leave the theatre, an actress named Vanda Jordan arrives disheveled from the rain. She claims to have had an audition slot earlier in the day, but her name does not appear on the audition list. Thomas wants to leave for his fiancee. In a whirlwind of energy and unrestrained aggression, Vanda persuades Thomas to let her stay and read for the part. At first appearing untalented, when she begins to read it becomes clear that she is an excellent actress and perfect for the part.\n\nAlthough initially presenting as uneducated, throughout the movie Vanda displays knowledge and talent that almost seems superhuman. For example, she surprises Thomas by producing the full script, not just the portion given out to actors to use in the audition and having memorized it. The audition is in a theater and she shows not only a command of staging but also the lighting rig- adjusting the theater's lightboard, which presumably she has never seen before, without hesitation. And she also has brought a full set of costumes, including some for Thomas to wear which fit him perfectly. At one point she \"guesses\" an amazingly accurate picture of Thomas' fianc\u00e9's life and background.\n\nThe subject of the play is sexual domination and submission. As the audition continues Vanda attacks the script as sexist, soft-core [[Sadomasochism|S&M]] pornography. Thomas at first defends it as a faithful adaptation of a literary classic about passion and desire. Vanda accuses Thomas of having his own masochistic fantasies, which he denies. However, as the film develops, he increasingly identifies with the masochistic male lead in the play. By the end of the film, he has become Vanda's slave.\n\nIn the final scene Thomas is bound and tied to a pole. Vanda appears, proclaims \"[[Maenad|Bacchae]] of [[Cadmea|the Cadmea]]. Dance for [[Dionysus]]!\", dances before Thomas, and leaves. The movie ends with the quote from the [[Book of Judith]]: \"And the Lord hath smitten him and delivered him into a woman's hands.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] as Vanda Jourdain\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Thomas Novacheck\n\n==Production==\nThe intention to adapt Ives' play was announced in September 2012.
