It tells the story of a cat, who obtains the ability to speak after swallowing a parrot, and its owner who is a rabbi in 1920s Algeria.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://collider.com/the-rabbis-cat-synopsis-images-movie/59247/|title=First Images and Official Synopsis of Joann Sfar's THE RABBI'S CAT|date=2010-11-09|work=Collider|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}</ref> The voice cast includes [[Fran\u00e7ois Morel (actor)|Fran\u00e7ois Morel]], [[Hafsia Herzi]], [[Maurice B\u00e9nichou]], [[Fellag]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Damiens]] and [[Jean-Pierre Kalfon]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story takes place in the Jewish community of [[Algeria]] during the 1920s. One day a [[rabbi]] finds that his talking parrot, who is very noisy, has been eaten by his cat and that the cat has gained the ability to speak in human tongues. However, the rabbi finds that the cat is very rude and arrogant, so the rabbi teaches him about the [[Torah]], with the cat deciding that \u2014 if he is Jewish \u2014 then he should receive a [[bar mitzvah]], leading the two to consult with the rabbi's rabbi. The cat proceeds to mock and insult the rabbi's strict views, who declares that the cat should be killed for its heresy. The rabbi takes his cat and leaves, mad at the cat for making a fool of his master. The two eventually reach an agreement where the rabbi will teach the cat all about the Torah and that he might have his bar mitzvah when he is ready.\n\nThe cat helps the rabbi pass a French language exam so that he might one day become head rabbi, but after the exam the cat loses his ability to speak (as he invoked the name of God to pray for his master). After the discovery of a Russian Jew who has stowed away in a shipment of religious texts, the cat learns he can speak Russian. He eventually regains his ability to speak French, finding he knows many languages and can act as a translator. The Russian reveals that he is a painter who has fled from [[Soviet Russia]]. He has come to Africa to search for a hidden city of black Jews deep in the heart of Africa, and convinces the rabbi, his cat, and a former Russian soldier to help him in his search.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Morel (actor)|Fran\u00e7ois Morel]] as the cat\n* [[Maurice B\u00e9nichou]] as the rabbi\n* [[Hafsia Herzi]] as Zlabya\n* [[Jean-Pierre Kalfon]] as Malka of the lions\n* [[Fellag]] as sheik Mohammed Sfar\n* Sava Lolov as the Russian painter\n* Daniel Cohen as the rabbi's master\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Damiens]] as the Belgian reporter\n* [[Wojciech Pszoniak]] as Vastenov\n* [[Pascal N'Zonzi]] as the first giant\n* [[Marguerite Abouet]] as the African girl\n* [[Eric Elmosnino]] as professor Soliman\n* Alice Houri as Knidelette\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as the prince\n* [[Olivier Broche]] as the parrot\n\n==Production==\nAutochenille Production was launched in 2007 by [[Joann Sfar]], Antoine Delesvaux and Cl\u00e9ment Oubrerie with the aim to make \"author-driven, challenging films to appeal to children and adults.\"<ref name=sfardirects>{{Cite web|last=Keslassy|first=Elsa|date=2009-01-13|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998432?refCatId=13|title=Joann Sfar directs 'Rabbi's Cat'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref> ''The Rabbi's Cat'' was the company's first project. The production was made in collaboration with [[TF1]] and [[France 3]]. It was pre-bought by [[Canal+]] and CineCin\u00e9ma and had a budget of 12.5 million euro. It is the second film directed by Sfar, after ''[[Gainsbourg (Vie h\u00e9ro\u00efque)]]''.<ref name=sfardirects />\n\nOne of the directors' sources of inspiration was American animation from the 1930s and, in particular, from the [[Fleischer Studios]], which Sfar described as characterised by multi-ethnic production crews and for portraying dark aspects of society, in cartoons such as ''[[Betty Boop]]'' and ''[[Popeye]]''. To generate more personality for the drawn characters in ''The Rabbi's Cat'', some of the scenes were staged in a Parisian suburb loft in the summer of 2008, with props and the cast fully costumed. As the actors performed and invented their characters' personal motion habits, the design team observed closely and drew what they picked up.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Festra\u00ebts|first=Marion|date=2008-08-13|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/cinema/joann-sfar-chat-tourne_549828.html|title=Joann Sfar: Chat tourne !|language=French|work=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]|accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref>\n\nThe original soundtrack was composed by Olivier Daviaud, who had composed the music for ''Gainsbourg (Vie h\u00e9ro\u00efque)'', and was performed by [[Enrico Macias]] and the Amsterdam Klezmer Band.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dieudonne|first=Jean|date=2011-05-03|url=http://www.evous.fr/Le-Chat-du-rabbin-la-B-O-du-film,1156788.html|title='Le Chat du rabbin', la B.O. du film|language=French|work=evous.fr|accessdate=2011-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in France on 1 June 2011 through [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC Distribution]], which launched it in 243 prints.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lemercier|first=Fabien|date=2011-06-01|url=http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?lang=en&documentID=204436|title=''The Rabbi's Cat'' tackles religion and human folly|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2011-06-02}}</ref> It competed at the 2011 [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]], where it won the top award: the Annecy Crystal for best feature.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|last2=Keslassy|first2=Elsa|date=2011-06-11|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038426?refCatId=13|title='Rabbi's Cat' wins Annecy best feature|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2011-06-12}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Rabbi's Cat'' received positive reviews from critics.

Vavasseur called ''The Rabbi's Cat'' \"a pure pleasure\" and complimented it for its variation and colourfulness, as well as for how it tackles the subject of a divided society: \"Offsprings of [[Voltaire]], Sfar and his cat don't stroke anyone with the hair, but throw as chefs together a broth of cultures with multiple flavours and with nurtured scenery.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vavasseur|first=Pierre|date=2011-06-01|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/cinema/critiques-cinema/le-chat-du-rabbin-au-poil-01-06-2011-1475728.php|title=\" Le Chat du rabbin \" : au poil ***|language=French|work=[[Le Parisien]]|accessdate=2011-06-02|quote=un pur plaisir\"; \"Fils de Voltaire, Sfar et son chat ne caressent personne dans le sens du poil, mais touillent comme des chefs un bouillon de cultures aux multiples ar\u00f4mes et aux paysages soign\u00e9s.}}</ref>\n\n[[Jacques Mandelbaum]] wrote a negative review in ''[[Le Monde]]'', where he, among other things, criticised the film for having dull gags, lifeless voice acting and a dragging pace: \"This general disconcertment is due to the lack of determination in the point of view, which evidently wants to take in everything and fails to grasp the bad. Between [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]] and ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', family chronicle and adventure film, biblical legend and colonial chronicle, historical reconstruction and winks to the contemporary world, the references are superimposed without achieving harmony.
