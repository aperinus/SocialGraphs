Her latest encounters have been particularly bad, so when she meets a homeless (and horny) street musician, Kaz, she thinks that she may have found a good man. Little does she know that Kaz was cursed by the mother of a young girl he was messing around with while he was in middle school. Whenever he becomes aroused he becomes a demon.\n\nWhen young women begin to die throughout the city, Kaz begins to wonder if he is \"The Mangler\" that is murdering them. His worries are compounded when Denny's friend Sonia, a psychic, receives a vision that seems to confirm his suspicions. The killer is ultimately revealed to be Charles, who kidnaps Denny.\n\nTo save Denny, Kaz sleeps with Sonia to trigger his transformation. He then saves Denny and is cured of his curse, while Charles is defeated.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Scott Valentine (actor)|Scott Valentine]] as Kaz\n*[[Michele Little]] as Denny \n*[[Robert Trebor]] as Charles\n*[[Gina Gallego]] as Sonia\n*[[Alan Fudge]] as Phil Janus\n*[[Calvert DeForest]] as Man in Health Food Store\n*[[Arnold Johnson (actor)|Arnold Johnson]] as Fixer\n\n==Production==\nTo distinguish ''My Demon Lover'' from werewolf films, Valentine's character was written to change into a multitude of forms.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Lovers and Other Demons|last=Anker|first=Roger|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|issue=63|date=May 1987|pages=43\u201345}}</ref>  Comic book artist [[Bernie Wrightson]] did additional character design and storyboarding for the film.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=My Demon Artist|last=Dickholtz|first=Daniel|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|issue=64|date=June 1987|page=20}}</ref>\n\nShooting took place in Los Angeles and New York, starting in September 1986 and finishing in November.<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/57755|title=My Demon Lover (1987)|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|access-date=2021-02-14}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed $1,815,583 in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1987&wknd=17&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for April 24-26, 1987 - Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com|access-date=16 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n''My Demon Lover'' received negative reviews.<ref name=afi/>  [[Janet Maslin]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the film bores audiences despite its copious special effects and strange characters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE0DD1030F937A15757C0A961948260 |title=Movie Review - My Demon Lover - FILM: 'MY DEMON LOVER,' GOTHIC TALE IN GOTHAM |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1987-04-24 |access-date=2015-03-16}}</ref>  Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that \"though there\u2019s a lot wrong with it, there are things amusingly right about it, too\".
