The film stars [[Robert Redford]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. It is the story of a gruff [[Wyoming]] rancher (Redford) who must reconcile his relationship with his struggling daughter-in-law (Lopez) and previously-unknown-to-him granddaughter, after they show up unexpectedly at his ranch and ask to stay with him and his disabled best friend and neighbor (Freeman).\n\n== Plot ==\nOne year ago, a bear stole a calf from Mitch and Einar's ranch. The two friends attempted to save the calf, but the bear viciously attacked Mitch \u2014 and because Einar was drunk, he failed to save Mitch from serious injury. The bear escaped into the mountains.\n\nA year later, Mitch's wounds still cause him constant pain. Einar cares for Mitch daily, giving him morphine injections, food, and friendship. He leans his guilt on emotional crutches, while Mitch struggles to walk with real crutches. The bear is later seen foraging for food in town. Sheriff Crane Curtis captures it and it ends up in the town zoo. About the same time, Einar's long-lost daughter-in-law Jean shows up on his doorstep.\n\nJean and her young daughter, Griff move in with Einar and Mitch. Einar's son, Griffin, had married Jean years ago. She discovered that she was pregnant with Griff after Griffin died in a car accident, after which the family broke up. Tension exists between Einar and Jean, as both are still grieving for Griffin; tensions build as Einar has always blamed Jean for his son's death.\n\nSince Griffin died, Jean has been in a series of unsuccessful relationships. She moved in with Einar to escape her abusive boyfriend, Gary. Jean starts working at a local coffee shop to earn money to become independent. There she befriends Nina, another waitress. Sheriff Curtis also becomes her friend.\n\nMeanwhile, Gary has tracked Jean down and appears in town. Initially, Einar and the sheriff throw him out of town. Einar asks Jean to tell him how Griffin died. Jean says they flipped a coin to determine who would drive, and she lost. At 3 a.m., the two tired souls had set out on the last leg of a long trip. Jean fell asleep at the wheel. The car flipped six times. Griffin died, but Jean survived. When Einar learns the truth about his son's death, he says they'll have to talk about Jean moving out. Jean says she's through talking. The next morning she takes Griff with her and leaves to stay with Nina, who ends up helping her understand Einar's gruff ways and bitterness.\n\nGriff, who has begun to build a relationship with her grandfather, leaves her mother and goes back to the ranch alone. Einar meets Jean at the diner and invites her to come back and live with him after he and Griff go on a camping trip.\n\nThe \"camping trip\" is a cover story meant to allow them time to carry out a request from Mitch to set free the bear who mauled him. The plan to get the bear into a transport cage does not go well. Griff accidentally knocks the gearshift lever into neutral while Einar is luring the bear into the cage. The bear gets free, and Einar is injured as he jumps out of the way. Griff drives Einar to the hospital, where he and Jean attempt to reconcile. Back at the ranch, Mitch survives a peaceful confrontation with the bear from his past. It goes into the mountains, where it belongs.\n\nMeanwhile, Gary returns to the area and comes to the ranch the next day to accost Jean. He and Einar have an explosive confrontation that ends in Einar threatening Gary with his rifle, before badly beating him up. Gary, battered and exhausted, leaves on a Trailways bus as it moves through Nebraska.\n\nIn the final scene, Einar affectionately talks with one of his cats, who throughout the whole story he'd coldly ignored. Griff invites Sheriff Curtis for lunch when he drops by to see Jean (previously Griff, knowing of her mother fooling around with Sheriff, had told him not to stay for lunch). All is well as Mitch narrates the last seconds of the story, describing to Einar his dreams of flying above the earth and coming to understand things about life.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per opening stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Redford]] as Einar Gilkyson\n* [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Jean Gilkyson\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Mitch Bradley\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Crane Curtis\n* [[Camryn Manheim]] as Nina\n* [[Damian Lewis]] as Gary Winston\n* Becca Gardner as Griff Gilkyson\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nWhile set in Wyoming, ''An Unfinished Life'' was actually filmed in the Canadian towns of [[Ashcroft, British Columbia|Ashcroft]], [[Savona, British Columbia|Savona]], and [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bclocalnews.com/bc_thompson_nicola/kamloopsthisweek/entertainment/96069984.html |title=Roll film, celebrate a decade |access-date=25 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822063545/http://www.bclocalnews.com/bc_thompson_nicola/kamloopsthisweek/entertainment/96069984.html |archive-date=22 August 2010 |first=Dale |last=Bass |date=10 June 2010 |newspaper=[[Kamloops This Week]] |publisher=[[Black Press]] |via=BC Local News}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Critical reception ===\nReviews of the film were mixed.
