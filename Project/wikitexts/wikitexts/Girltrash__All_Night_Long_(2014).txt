But while on their way to the concert, their van breaks down and they are sidetracked by Daisy's younger sister, Colby, a recent college graduate who agrees to drive them to the concert if they help her hook up with her crush; a struggling actress named Misty. Also tagging along is Misty's bisexual best friend Sid, who longs to hook up with a famous celebrity. However, Misty is not interested in hooking up with Colby because she has her sights on Tyler. Meanwhile, Daisy tries to win back her ex-girlfriend, Xan, who is on a date with her latest girlfriend who is competing against Daisy and Tyler's band that very night. Elsewhere, Monique Jones is a violent ex-con recently paroled from prison who comes looking for Daisy and Tyler with a score to settle.<ref>{{Citation|title=Girltrash: All Night Long|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1555440/|access-date=2019-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lisa Rieffel]] as Daisy Robson\n* [[Michelle Lombardo]] as Tyler Murphy\n* [[Gabrielle Christian]] as Colby Robson\n* [[Mandy Musgrave]] as Misty Monroe\n* [[Kate French]] as Sid\n* [[Clementine Ford]] as Zan\n* [[Rose Rollins]] as Monique Shaniqua Jones\n* [[Heather Thomas]] as Nadine Robson\n* [[Megan Cavanagh]] as Officer Margie\n\n== Awards ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
