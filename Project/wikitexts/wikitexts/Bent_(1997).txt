It revolves around [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|the persecution]] of [[homosexuals]] in [[Nazi Germany]] after the murder of [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] leader [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] on the [[Night of the Long Knives]].\n\n==Plot==\nMax ([[Clive Owen]]) is a promiscuous [[gay]] man living in 1930s [[Berlin]]. He is at odds with his wealthy family because of his [[homosexuality]]. One evening, much to the resentment of his boyfriend, Rudy (Brian Webber II), Max brings home a handsome [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) man ([[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]]). Unfortunately, he does so on the [[Night of the Long Knives]], when [[Hitler]] ordered the assassination of upper echelon SA corps.  The Sturmabteilung man is discovered and killed by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] men in Max and Rudy's apartment, and the two have to flee Berlin.\n\nMax's Uncle Freddie ([[Ian McKellen]]) has organised new papers for Max, but Max refuses to leave his boyfriend behind. As a result, Max and Rudy are found and arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and put on a train headed for [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. On the train, Rudy is brutally beaten to death by the guards. As Rudy calls out to Max when he is taken away, Max lies to the guards, denying he is gay. In the camp, Max falls in love with Horst ([[Lothaire Bluteau]]), who shows him the dignity that lies in acknowledging one's beliefs. After Horst's death, Max finds the courage to be true to himself and takes his own life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Max\n* [[Lothaire Bluteau]] as Horst\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as Uncle Freddie\n* Brian Webber II as Rudy\n* [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] as Wolf\n* [[Mick Jagger]] as Greta\n* [[Jude Law]] as Stormtrooper\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Captain\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Prostitute\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''Bent'' has an overall approval rating of 75% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 24 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.4/10. The site's consensus reads: \"''Bent'' juggles heavy topics with style, though its heavy-handedness at times feels more like exploitation than exploration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1087747-bent/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2022-10-31}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\n* 1997: Won Award of the Youth at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]\n* 1998: Won Best Feature Film in the Torino International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0118698}}\n* {{mojo title|bent}}\n\n{{Philip Glass}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bent (Film)}}\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1990s war drama films]]\n[[Category:British war drama films]]\n[[Category:British LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:English-language Japanese films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Philip Glass]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Sean Mathias]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Japanese war drama films]]\n[[Category:Japanese LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films about anti-LGBT sentiment]]\n[[Category:Homophobia in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films set in Berlin]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Holocaust films]]\n[[Category:Films about Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:1997 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Gay-related films]]\n[[Category:Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:1997 drama films]]\n[[Category:British World War II films]]\n[[Category:1997 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese films]]"}]}}}}
