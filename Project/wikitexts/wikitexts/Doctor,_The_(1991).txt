It is loosely based on Dr. [[Edward Rosenbaum]]'s 1988 book, ''A Taste Of My Own Medicine''.<ref>Dr. Edward E. Rosenbaum, ''A Taste Of My Own Medicine: When the Doctor Is the Patient'', Random House, 1988. {{ISBN|978-0-394-56282-7}}</ref> The film stars [[William Hurt]] as Jack McKee, a [[Physician|doctor]] who undergoes a transformation in his views about life, illness and human relationships.\n\n==Plot==\nDr Jack McKee is a successful surgeon at a leading hospital. He and his wife, Anne, have all the trappings of success, although Jack works such long hours that he rarely has time to see their son and has become somewhat emotionally dead to his wife. His \"bedside manner\" with his patients, in many cases seriously ill, is also lacking. The decorum in the operating theater is very casual and the chatter between him and his partner, Dr. Murray Kaplan, not particularly professional.\n\nReturning home from a charity event, Jack has a coughing fit. His wife is shocked when he coughs up blood all over her and the car. In an examination, Jack has a sample of a growth removed from his throat. The biopsy comes back positive for cancer. His time spent with another cold, impersonal surgeon in this examination is the beginning of his transformation. Further tests and disappointments are blended with scenes of other patients' grace and [[empathy]] towards each other and a much better view of the delays and missteps of their doctors and medical support personnel.\n\nAs Jack experiences life as a patient, he gains a clearer understanding of the emotional void hospitals, some doctors, and his own colleagues can display. He befriends June Ellis, a fellow cancer patient who has an inoperable brain tumor. She gets him to promise to never lie or mislead a patient again. Jack begins to bark at the medical establishment. Jack and June take off to see a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] show, but the pace is too much for her. His wife, meanwhile, struggles to understand Jack's relationship with June.\n\nJack's radiation treatment does not stop the cancer on his vocal cords. His despair ends in a confrontation with Dr. Leslie Abbott, the surgeon treating him whom he provokes in a heated discussion. Jack asks a colleague he has previously ridiculed, Dr. Eli Bloomfield, to perform his needed surgery. Jack apologizes for his and Murray's insulting behavior, to which Eli replies with a smile, \"Well, Jack, I've always wanted to slit your throat, and now I've got the chance.\" Eli's bedside manner is a perfect example for Jack.\n\nJack's cancer is treated and cured, but June dies. The experience changes Jack forever. When he returns to work, he begins to teach new medical interns about the importance of showing [[compassion]] and sensitivity towards their patients, which in turn will make them better doctors. Jack puts the interns in patient gowns, assigns them various illnesses and orders all the tests for them to \"feel\" the experience that they will soon put their patients through.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Hurt]] as Dr. Jack McKee\n* [[Christine Lahti]] as Anne McKee\n* [[Elizabeth Perkins]] as June Ellis\n* [[Mandy Patinkin]] as Dr. Murray Kaplan\n* [[Adam Arkin]] as Dr. Eli Bloomfield\n* [[Charlie Korsmo]] as Nicky McKee\n* [[Wendy Crewson]] as Dr. Leslie Abbott\n* [[Zakes Mokae]] as Dr. Charles Reed (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n[[Warren Beatty]] was originally announced for the lead role<ref>{{cite news|title=Calling Dr. Beatty|author=Broeske, Pat H.|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=22 July 1990|page=Z28}}</ref> but left over creative differences with the director.
