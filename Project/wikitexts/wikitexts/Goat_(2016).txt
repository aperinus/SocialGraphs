His brother, Brett, is already established on campus and is a member of a fraternity that lures Brad in with its promise of protection, popularity, and life-long friendships. Brad is desperate to belong but as he sets out to join the fraternity his brother exhibits reservations, a sentiment that threatens to divide them. As the pledging ritual moves into hell week, a rite that promises to usher these unproven boys into manhood, the stakes violently increase with a series of [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|torturous and humiliating events]]. The pledges are taken to an off-campus site in the woods, where they are told they either need to drink large quantities of beer, or if they fail they need to sodomize and then kill a [[goat]]. They pass the test, and are told the hazing is over. During the crossing ceremony, Brad becomes upset that his brother did not attend and confronts him. Their argument becomes heated and they almost fight each other. Brett says Brad does not belong in the fraternity after seeing how bad the hazing process was.\n\nEvents culminate when Will, Brad's pledge brother, dies of a heart attack while exercising on the track field and his body was shown to be covered in bruises from hazing. The pledges, particularly Brad, are warned not to reveal anything to the authorities. The university launches an investigation into Phi Sigma Mu and the fraternity is suspended from campus after someone had told the investigators all about the hazing process. The pledge master suspects Brad for leaking information to the university. Brad comes back to his dorm after class to find his goat defecating on the carpet with \"Rat Fuck\" shaved into its coat.\n\nAfter confronting the brothers at the house, Brad gets accused of speaking to the authorities but Brett steps in and reveals himself as the source of the leaks.\n\nBrett and Brad both go to the police station to identify Brad's attackers from 6 months ago. One of them is revealed to have been shot in a gas station robbery, while the other has yet to be identified in a line up. Brad lies and says none of the men are the one who assaulted him. The final scene is of Brad and Brett visiting the field where Brad was beaten. The film ends with Mark Mullens throwing a bone to the Goat along with Brad.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nick Jonas]] as Brett Land\n* [[Ben Schnetzer]] as Brad Land\n* Gus Halper as Chance\n* [[Daniel Flaherty]] as Will\n* [[Virginia Gardner]] as Leah\n* [[James Franco]] as Mitch\n* Austin Lyon as Dave\n* [[Jake Picking]] as Dixon Rowley\n* [[Brock Yurich]] as Wes\n* Will Pullen as The Smile\n* [[Eric Staves]] as Ben Baity\n* Connor Harris as Mark Mullens\n* [[Chase Crawford]] as Goat Boy\n* Jamar Jackson as The Breath\n* Chewie as The Goat\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn October 2014, it was announced that [[James Franco]] would produce the film under his [[Rabbit Bandini Productions]] banner, while [[Andrew Neel]] would direct from a screenplay written by [[David Gordon Green]], with revisions by Neel and Mike Roberts.
