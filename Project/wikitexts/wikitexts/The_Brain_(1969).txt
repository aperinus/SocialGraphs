It stars [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and [[Bourvil]] as a pair of French petty crooks, [[David Niven]] as a [[British Army]] officer who is secretly a criminal mastermind and [[Eli Wallach]] as a Sicilian [[made man|mafioso]].\n\n==Plot==\nArthur, due for release from prison in four days' time, escapes to join his accomplice Anatole in robbing a night train carrying millions in cash from [[Paris]] to [[Brussels]]. The money belongs to [[NATO]] and in charge of its transit is Colonel Matthews, who in fact was the unknown mastermind behind the Great Train Robbery, nicknamed 'The Brain'.\n\nIn his plans for a repeat exploit, he recruits a mafioso called Scannapieco to launder the money for a small percentage. Visiting the Sicilian's villa outside [[Palermo]], he catches the eye of his sister Sofia, who resolves to give him her virginity. This infuriates her brother, who considers his honour impugned and resolves that instead of a contemptible percentage he will take all the money himself.\n\nThe train sets off with the money, and with Arthur and Anatole disguised as railwaymen. The two incapacitate the guards in the secure coach with gas, free its couplings and, when it has rolled to a halt, throw the bags of cash down the embankment. However it is the precise spot where Colonel Matthews' team, disguised as firemen, are waiting. They scoop up the bags and make off with sirens blaring, leaving Arthur and Anatole to walk back to Paris penniless.\n\nThe firemen do not get far because they run into a roadblock, where the police reclaim the money and arrest Matthews. In fact, they are not police but disguised mafiosi, whose plan is to smuggle the money out of France in a replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Hijacking a [[Citro\u00ebn DS|DS19]], Arthur and Anatole give chase. Also in the chase at the wheel of a [[BMW New Class|BMW 2000 coup\u00e9]] is Sofia, who has freed Matthews and locked her brother in a cabin trunk. All three groups of villains are pursued by the police, ending up on the dockside at [[Le Havre]].\n\nAs the Statue of Liberty is hoisted aboard the passenger liner ''[[SS France (1960)|SS France]]'', Arthur climbs into it and finds the money, which falls in a shower of banknotes over the crowds on the quay. The film ends on the ship as it enters [[New York Harbor]], where Matthews lets Arthur and Anatole into the secret of his next operation, which is to hijack a consignment of bullion bound for [[Fort Knox]].\n\n==Music==\nThe film's original score was composed by [[Georges Delerue]], while its [[theme song]] was performed by [[The American Breed]]. The score also includes the song ''Cento giorni'', performed by [[Caterina Caselli]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was the most popular French movie at the French box office in 1969.<ref>\"The World's Top Twenty Films.\" Sunday Times [London, England] 27 Sept. 1970: 27.
