Based on [[Greg Iles]]' bestselling novel ''[[24 Hours (novel)|24 Hours]]'', it follows a wealthy [[Portland, Oregon]] couple whose daughter is kidnapped by a mysterious man and his wife who demand a [[ransom]] for unclear reasons.\n\nFilmed in [[British Columbia]] in the spring of 2001, ''Trapped'' was released theatrically by [[Columbia Pictures]] on September 20, 2002. It received largely unfavorable reviews from critics, and was a [[box-office bomb]], earning $13.4 million against its $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Will Jennings, a research physician, has landed his major career break by [[patent]]ing a new anesthetic drug. After speaking at a conference regarding the patent in a [[Seattle]] hotel, he is met by a strange woman, Cheryl, who introduces herself as an admirer of his work. Cheryl attempts to seduce Will in the hallway, before holding him at gunpoint and forcing him into his hotel room. She demands a [[ransom]] for his young daughter, Abby. Meanwhile, Cheryl's husband, Joe, has broken into Will's luxurious [[Portland, Oregon]] home, and confronts Will's wife, Karen, who has returned after picking Abby up from school. Joe sends Abby away with his cousin, Marvin, while Karen attempts to fight the attack, but is ultimately thwarted when Joe holds her hostage at gunpoint.\n\nMarvin drives Abby to a remote cabin in the woods, but soon discovers that Abby suffers from [[asthma]] and is dependent on an inhaler. Abby begins to have an asthma attack, which causes Marvin to panic and phone Joe. Joe agrees to drive Karen to the cabin to administer the inhaler, blindfolding her for the car ride. An emotional Karen stops Abby's attack with the medication, but is quickly forced back into the car by Joe. Joe brings Karen back to her home, where she attempts to fight him, but he subdues her. When her neighbor, Joan, stops by unannounced, Karen is forced to pretend that she has been caught having an affair with Joe. After Joan leaves, Karen manages to slash Joe with a concealed scalpel and locks herself in the bathroom where she receives a phone call from Abby, who has snuck out of the cabin with Marvin's cell phone. The call is short-lived, however, as Marvin recaptures Abby, and Joe forces his way into the bathroom. With Karen under his control again, Joe makes her suture his wound.\n\nAt the hotel, Will manages to inject Cheryl with [[succinylcholine]], paralyzing her and bringing her near the edge of death before he administers an antidote. Fearing for her life, Cheryl also loses her nerve, and admits to Will that she and Joe constructed the plot as revenge for their daughter, Katie, who died during a recent brain operation; Will assisted on Katie's surgery. When Will explains that he was wrongly implicated by the head surgeon in the negligence that caused Katie's death, Cheryl begins to sympathize with him, and agrees to botch the plan.\n\nIn the morning, Cheryl accompanies Will to a bank to retrieve the ransom money while they are monitored by police. Joe and Cheryl have a heated argument on the phone, in which it is revealed that Joe intended to keep Abby after receiving the ransom and raise her as his own daughter. Will and Cheryl board a [[seaplane]] to fly toward Portland, where Joe and Karen are embarking on a freeway toward them to exchange the money; traveling behind them are Marvin and Abby in a separate SUV. Karen attacks Joe in the car, forcing them off the freeway. As Will and Cheryl fly over the freeway, they spot Joe's car, and land the seaplane on the road, causing a multi-car pileup. Marvin loses control of the SUV in the melee and crashes.\n\nWhile Joe chastises Cheryl, Marvin orders Abby out of the car, and urges her to find her parents. Abby is briefly captured by Cheryl, but released when a physical fight ensues between Will and Joe, which ultimately ends with Karen shooting Joe to death. Police and agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] descend on the scene as Abby suffers another asthma attack, but Karen is able to treat her with the inhaler. Cheryl is captured by police as Karen, Will, and Abby embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Charlize Theron]] as Karen Jennings\n*[[Courtney Love]] as Cheryl Hickey\n*[[Stuart Townsend]] as Dr. Will Jennings\n*[[Kevin Bacon]] as Joe Hickey\n*[[Dakota Fanning]] as Abigail (Abby) Jennings\n*[[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Marvin\n*[[Colleen Camp]] as Joan Evans\n*Steve Rankin as Hank Ferris\n*[[Garry Chalk (actor)|Garry Chalk]] as Agent Chalmers\n*[[Jodie Markell]] as Mary McDill\n*Matt Koby as Peter McDill\n*[[Gerry Becker]] as Dr. Stein\n*[[Andrew Airlie]] as Holden\n*Randi Lynne as Hotel Operator\n*J.
