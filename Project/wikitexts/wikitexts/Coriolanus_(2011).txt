The rioters are particularly angry at [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Caius Martius]], a brilliant Roman general whom they blame for the city's problems. During a march, the rioters encounter Martius, who is openly contemptuous and does not hide his low opinion of the regular citizens. The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius, who has fought Martius on several occasions and considers him a mortal enemy, swears that the next time they meet in battle will be the last. Martius leads a raid against the Volscian city of [[Corioli|Corioles]] and during the siege, with much of Martius's unit being killed, Martius gathers reinforcements and the Romans take the city. After the battle, Martius and Aufidius meet in single combat, which results in both men being wounded but ends when Aufidius' soldiers drag him away from the fight.\n\nMartius returns to Rome victorious and in recognition of his great courage, General Cominius gives him the [[agnomen]] of \"Coriolanus\". Coriolanus's mother [[Volumnia]] encourages her son to run for consul within the [[Roman Senate]]. Coriolanus is reluctant but he eventually agrees to his mother's wishes. He easily wins the Roman Senate and seems at first to have won over the commoners as well due to his military victories. Two [[tribunes]], Brutus and Sicinius, are critical of his entrance into politics, fearing that his popularity would lead to Coriolanus taking power away from the Senate for himself. They scheme to undo Coriolanus and so stir up another riot in opposition to him becoming consul. When they call Coriolanus a [[treason|traitor]], Coriolanus bursts into rage and openly attacks the concept of popular rule as well as the citizens of Rome, demonstrating that he still holds the [[plebeians]] in contempt. He compares allowing citizens to have power over the senators as to allowing \"crows to peck the eagles\". The tribunes term Coriolanus a traitor for his words and order him banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who will banish Rome from his presence: \"There is a world elsewhere\".\n\nAfter being exiled from Rome, Coriolanus seeks out Aufidius in the Volscian capital of [[Antium]] and offers to let Aufidius kill him, to spite the country that banished him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus and allow him to lead a new assault on the city, so that he can claim vengeance on the city which he feels betrayed him. Coriolanus and Aufidius lead a Volscian attack on Rome. Panicked, Rome sends General Titus to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance; when Titus reports his failure, Senator [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus|Menenius]] follows but is also shunned. In response, Menenius, who has seemingly lost all hope in Coriolanus and Rome, commits suicide by a river bank. Finally, Volumnia is sent to meet with her son, along with Coriolanus' wife [[Virgilia]] and his son. Volumnia succeeds in dissuading her son from destroying Rome and Coriolanus makes peace between the Volscians and the Romans alongside General Cominius. When Coriolanus returns to the Volscian border, he is confronted by Aufidius and his men, who now also brand him as a traitor. They call him Martius and refuse to call him by his \"stolen name\" of Coriolanus. Aufidius explains to Coriolanus how he put aside his hatred so that they could conquer Rome but now that Coriolanus has prevented this, he has betrayed the promise between them. For this betrayal, Aufidius and his men attack and kill Coriolanus.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Caius Martius Coriolanus]]\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Tullus Aufidius\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as [[Volumnia]]\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus (consul 503 BC)|Menenius]]\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as [[Virgilia]]\n* [[John Kani]] as General Cominius<ref name=\"theplaylist\">{{cite web |title=Ralph Fiennes' ''Coriolanus'' Finalizes Cast For Serbian Shoot Next Week |url=https://theplaylist.net/ralph-fiennes-coriolanus-finalizes-cas-20100311/ |work=The Playlist |last=Dang |first=Simon |date=11 March 2010 |access-date=13 March 2010}}</ref>\n* [[James Nesbitt]] as Sicinius<ref name=\"30ninjas\">{{cite web |last=Wiseman |first=Andreas |date=31 March 2010 |url=http://30ninjas.com/blog/ralph-fiennes-coriolanus-blog-why-coriolanus-matters |title=Why Coriolanus Matters |work=30 Ninjas |access-date=9 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406090358/http://www.30ninjas.com/blog/ralph-fiennes-coriolanus-blog-why-coriolanus-matters |archive-date=6 April 2010 }}</ref>\n* [[Paul Jesson]] as Brutus\n* [[Lubna Azabal]] as Tamora<ref name=\"30ninjas\" />\n* [[Ashraf Barhom]] as Cassius<ref name=\"30ninjas\" />\n* [[Dragan Mi\u0107anovi\u0107]] as [[Titus Larcius]]\n* [[Slavko \u0160timac]] as Volsce lieutenant\n* Radoslav Milenkovi\u0107 as Volsce politician\n* Harry Fenn as Young Martius\n* [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] as TV Anchorman\n* Elizabeta Djorevska as Maid\n* [[Slobodan Ninkovi\u0107]] as War Veteran\n* [[David Yelland (actor)|David Yelland]] and [[Nikki Amuka-Bird]] as TV Pundits\n* [[Mona Hammond]] and [[Marko Stojanovi\u0107 (actor)|Marko Stojanovi\u0107]] as Citizens of Rome\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{expand section|date=December 2017}}\nThe film was produced on a budget of US $7.7 million.
