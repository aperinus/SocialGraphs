It focuses on events in [[Venezuela]] leading up to and during the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|April 2002 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]], which saw President [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] removed from office for two days. With particular emphasis on the role played by Venezuela's private media, the film examines several key incidents: the protest march and subsequent violence that provided the impetus for Ch\u00e1vez's ousting; the opposition's formation of an interim government headed by business leader [[Pedro Carmona]]; and the Carmona administration's collapse, which paved the way for Ch\u00e1vez's return. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' was directed by Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha \u00d3&nbsp;Briain. Given direct access to Ch\u00e1vez, the filmmakers intended to make a [[Reality television#Documentary-style|fly-on-the-wall]] biography of the president. They spent seven months filming in Venezuela, following Ch\u00e1vez and his staff and interviewing ordinary citizens. As the coup unfolded on 11&nbsp;April, Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain filmed on the streets of the capital, [[Caracas]], capturing footage of protesters and the erupting violence. Later, they filmed many of the political upheavals inside [[Miraflores Palace|Miraflores]], the presidential palace.\n\nBartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain conceived of the film after Bartley returned from documenting the aftermath of the [[1999 Vargas mudslides]] for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, [[Bord Scann\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann]] (BS\u00c9), for a development grant. At BS\u00c9's request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot to show to potential investors. Funding for the \u20ac200,000 production was provided by BS\u00c9 and several European broadcasters. Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain shot more than 200&nbsp;hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt.\n\nThe film was positively received by mainstream film critics and won several awards. Reviewers cited the filmmakers' unprecedented proximity to key events and praised the film for its \"riveting narrative\";<ref name=\"schiller 488\">Schiller (2009), p. 488.</ref> criticism focused on its lack of context and pro-Ch\u00e1vez bias. First shown on television in Europe and Venezuela in 2003, ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' later appeared at film festivals and secured a limited theatrical release on the art house circuit. Independent activists held unofficial screenings, and Venezuelan government officials encouraged its circulation to build support for Ch\u00e1vez's administration. The film is regularly shown on Venezuelan television, and in the capital it is often broadcast during \"contentious political conjunctures\".<ref>Schiller (2009), p. 494.</ref> ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' paints Ch\u00e1vez in a favorable light{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}, which has led to disputes over its neutrality and accuracy; particular attention is paid to its framing of the violence of 11\u201313&nbsp;April, the filmmakers' editing of the timeline, and the omission of incidents and personnel. The film is variously cited as an accurate portrayal or a misrepresentation of the events of April 2002.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|History of Venezuela|Media representation of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez#Coverage of the 2002 coup}}\nThroughout much of the twentieth century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and military unrest. After [[Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez]]'s long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with [[Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]]'s overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes.<ref name=\"stoneman 5\">Stoneman (2008), p. 5.</ref> Until 1998, the dominant political parties were [[Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica]] and [[COPEI]], who shared seven presidencies between them. In 1989, during the second term in office for Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica's [[Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez]], Venezuela was hit by a severe economic crisis. A wave of protests known as the ''[[Caracazo]]'' engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting.<ref name=\"stoneman 6\">Stoneman (2008), p. 6.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hugo Chavez in Brazil-1861.jpeg|left|240px|thumb|alt=tbc|Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2003]]\n[[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], then a [[Military career of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez|Lieutenant Colonel in the army]], had formed a secret revolutionary group ([[MBR-200]]) in the early 1980s and was planning a \"rebellious intervention\".<ref name=\"stoneman 6\" /> He later felt the ''Caracazo'' was a missed opportunity for his movement.<ref name=\"stoneman 6\" /> Three years later, Ch\u00e1vez saw another chance; in February 1992, he led an [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempts|unsuccessful military coup d'\u00e9tat]] and was imprisoned. A second coup attempt, without his involvement, also failed. Ch\u00e1vez enjoyed some popular support for his actions. Released from prison in 1994, he recast his revolutionary group as a legitimate [[socialism|socialist]] political party, the [[Fifth Republic Movement]].<ref name=\"stoneman 7\">Stoneman (2008), p. 7.</ref> The movement adopted former Venezuelan leader [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] as its \"iconic hero\" and \"reference point\"; Bol\u00edvar had played a key role in Latin America's successful [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence from Spain]] in the 1820s.<ref name=\"stoneman 5\" /> In the [[1998 Venezuelan presidential election|1998 presidential election]], Ch\u00e1vez won 56.2% of the vote, on a promise to \"end the corruption of several decades\" and institute a new [[Bolivarian Revolution]] that he felt would secure Latin America's true independence from the outside world.<ref name=\"stoneman 7\" />\n\nCh\u00e1vez strengthened his support among the poor with a series of social initiatives known as the [[Bolivarian Missions]], and created a network of grass-roots workers' councils, the [[Bolivarian Circles]].<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 8.</ref> Nevertheless, by early 2002, Venezuela was \"embroiled&nbsp;... in a severe political crisis\" as Ch\u00e1vez sought to bring more of the country's vast oil wealth under state control.<ref name=\"gunson\" /> Although the state-owned radio and television stations remained staunch advocates of Ch\u00e1vez's stated policies\u2014to redistribute the nation's wealth to the poorest\u2014the private media was more hostile.{{refn|According to Phil Gunson in ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', in Venezuela, \"It is hard, if not impossible, to find an impartial observer.

Abandoning their planned route, the marchers advanced towards the palace, a path that took them close to government supporters who had come out in opposition to the protest. Journalist Phil Gunson wrote, \"Shooting broke out on all sides.  A score of civilians died and more than 150 suffered gunshot wounds. The military high command called for Ch\u00e1vez to resign, and at 3:20 the next morning they announced he had agreed to do so.

BS\u00c9 felt the pair needed to partner with a production company that had experience in the field, and which could help raise the remaining funds. Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain approached Power Pictures and, with the addition of David Power as a producer, reapplied for the grant.<ref name=\"stoneman 15\" /> Even as filming began, the full budget\u2014now at \u20ac200,000<ref name=\"stoneman 15\" />\u2014had not been secured. David Power pitched the project at several documentary festivals and markets. At Dublin's Stranger Than Fiction festival in September 2001, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], [[S4C]] and [[Channel 4]] declined to invest. [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]] (RT\u00c9) expressed interest in providing development funds; no such deal was made, but RT\u00c9 did offer \u20ac10,000 (subsequently \u20ac20,000) for the Irish broadcast rights. In October, the Dutch broadcaster [[Nederlandse Programma Stichting]] also committed \u20ac10,000. At a November market in Amsterdam, Power once again approached the BBC and was turned down, as the organization believed the film's subject was \"too far away to be relevant to [its viewers'] lives\".<ref name=\"stoneman 16\" /> However, RT\u00c9's Kevin Dawson pushed the film at a [[European Broadcasting Union]] pitching session, securing the interest of German television channel [[ZDF]], which subsequently provided funds.<ref name=\"stoneman 16\">Stoneman (2008), p. 16.</ref> In late 2001, BS\u00c9 finally approved a production grant of \u20ac63,000.<ref name=\"stoneman 17\">Stoneman (2008), p. 17.</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Entrada Miraflores.JPG|240px|thumb|alt=tbc|Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain captured much of their footage outside and inside the ''Palacio de Miraflores'' in Caracas.<ref name=\"chapter 8\" /><ref name=\"king\" />]]\nIn 2000, Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain had been promised \"exclusive access\" to Ch\u00e1vez by the government's Minister of Communications.<ref name=\"stoneman 17\" /> They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001.<ref name=\"gunson\" /> While filming the pilot they met the president,<ref name=\"stoneman 17\" /> after which they reconsidered their approach.<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 18.</ref> Bartley explained, \"We had&nbsp;... this notion of investigating Ch\u00e1vez\u2014was he a demagogue?

They calculated that they needed to \"press the right buttons\" to gain his support, so they presented  him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general [[Daniel Florence O'Leary]], who had fought alongside [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 19.</ref> Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]].{{refn|\"You cannot put a rope around the neck of an idea; you cannot put an idea up against the barrack-square wall and riddle it with bullets; you cannot confine it in the strongest prison cell your slaves could ever build.\"<ref name=\"stoneman 20\" />|group=\"nb\"}} Slowly, Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain gained their subjects' trust, \"dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras\".<ref name=\"stoneman 20\">Stoneman (2008), p. 20.</ref>\n\nAlthough ensconced with Ch\u00e1vez and his entourage, Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain felt a disconnect from the events of the outside world.

Through their previous contacts at the palace, Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain were able to continue filming without interference: \"no one paid any attention to us\u2014we just blended in.\"<ref name=\"king\" /> Later that day, Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain stayed away from the palace through fears for their safety.

When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, ''El juego de Cuba'', so they hired its editor, \u00c1ngel Hern\u00e1ndez Zoido. Zoido approached the film as if it were entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored.<ref name=\"stoneman 23\">Stoneman (2008), p. 23.</ref> He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the [[Dailies|rushes]] with Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain, Zoido asked them, \"What do we want to tell in this scene?\"<ref name=\"stoneman 24\" /> He focused on two factors: how much information would be necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core. Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.<ref name=\"stoneman 24\">Stoneman (2008), p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe large amount of footage, and the fact that the filmmakers were \"in a sense&nbsp;... looking at it for the first time\", meant that the film's concept only became clear during editing.<ref name=\"stoneman 23\" /> The events of 11\u201313&nbsp;April gave it \"a new dramatic centre\",<ref name=\"stoneman 24\" /> although Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain were keen that the film did not concentrate entirely on the coup. They had intended to include more historical and political context;<ref name=\"stoneman 24\" /> it wasn't until late in post-production that the focus narrowed<ref name=\"stoneman 25\" /> to include more emphasis on the media's role in Venezuelan politics.<ref name=\"stoneman 26\" /> In October 2002, a two-hour \"rough cut\" was shown to Stoneman and Brendan McCarthy, BS\u00c9's head of Production and Development.<ref name=\"stoneman 25\" /> This version included the \"witness\" accounts that Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain had captured after April 2002. Stoneman felt that these sequences reinforced the film's claims, but \"diluted its originality\".<ref name=\"stoneman 26\" /> He argued that they be cut, and that to compensate, Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain should record a voice-over and place themselves more in the frame as witness-protagonists, ideas that the filmmakers initially resisted.<ref name=\"stoneman 26\" />\n\nAs editing progressed, budget shortfalls prevented BS\u00c9 from finalizing contracts. The organization also restricted post-production funds to \"limit [its] exposure\" in the event the project was not completed.<ref name=\"stoneman 26\" /> Stoneman contacted a former colleague at the BBC, Nick Fraser,<ref name=\"stoneman 27\">Stoneman (2008), p. 27.</ref> who had declined to help finance the film in 2001.<ref name=\"stoneman 16\" /> Fraser was [[commissioning editor]] for the BBC's ''[[Storyville (television series)|Storyville]]'' documentaries series. According to Stoneman, Fraser was \"still undecided\", having been told by the head of [[BBC Two]] that \"we've done Ch\u00e1vez\".<ref name=\"stoneman 27\" /> Nevertheless, the BBC pre-purchased the film and in December 2002 received a rough cut.<ref name=\"stoneman 27\" /> At the BBC's behest, the opening of the television version was made more dramatic. Fraser was unsure about the voice-over; he asked for a more \"opinionated\" narration that, according to Bartley, would \"get the boot in\".<ref name=\"stoneman 27\" /> Although the BBC did not ask outright, Bartley's impression was that the organization wanted the film to be \"against Ch\u00e1vez\".<ref name=\"stoneman 27\" /> Fraser later said he had asked for the filmmakers to \"include [an interview] with someone not a Ch\u00e1vez supporter\".<ref name=\"product\" /> He also suggested that a more experienced director be employed to help edit the film. The filmmakers \"made a few minor concessions\", but resisted major edits.<ref name=\"stoneman 27\" /> \u00d3&nbsp;Briain's voice-over in the final cut was \"polished up but not significantly changed\".<ref name=\"stoneman 27\" />\n\nThe filmmakers created two versions of the film.

He wrote to David Power expressing particular concern over an error with the end titles and the use of out-of-chronology footage, saying the latter was \"a real problem\u2014particularly&nbsp;... since it has been used in a film dedicated to exposing the frauds of Venezuelan TV\".<ref name=\"stoneman 43-44\" /> The furor came at a difficult time for the corporation, which was under the spotlight of the [[Hutton Inquiry]], the official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]]; the BBC had been criticized for reporting that intelligence dossiers had been \"sexed up\" by the UK government to justify the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref name=\"product\" />\n\nThe petition's claims were also taken up by the UK's independent telecommunications regulator, [[Ofcom]].<ref name=\"stoneman 47\" /> The body investigated official protests made by several Caracas residents. The concerns largely focused on footage of the residents' attending a neighborhood meeting in June 2002, which was positioned in the film as a prelude to the April coup attempt. The residents said that the filmmakers had used footage of them without consent and that the film had misrepresented their views.<ref name=\"ofcom\" /> In September 2005, Ofcom provisionally ruled that it had not upheld the complaints, citing the BBC's internal review and rebuttal as grounds.<ref name=\"stoneman 67\">Stoneman (2008), p. 67.</ref> A subsequent appeal by the residents was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"ofcom\" /> Two weeks after Ofcom's initial ruling, the BBC announced it had closed the complaint and that no further investigations would take place.<ref name=\"stoneman 67\" /> Stoneman believed the BBC had overreacted, saying its guardedness was merely a product of being a frequent victim of press attacks on its ethos. Fraser said, \"The film was very good in many respects, but also misleading.\"<ref name=\"product\" /> He believed the filmmakers considered Ch\u00e1vez honorable, but having written a book on [[Peronism]] was more skeptical himself. Fraser concluded, \"I still think it's a good film, because of the coup sequence. It should be seen as a Venezuelan ''[[The West Wing|West Wing]]''\u2014biased, of course, but highly entertaining.\"<ref name=\"product\" />\n\n===Responsibility for violence===\nOne of the film's key contentions is that the private media aired footage selectively to make it look like the violence of 11&nbsp;April was caused by Ch\u00e1vez's supporters, portraying them as an \"irrational and uncivilized mob\".<ref name=\"schiller 479\">Schiller (2009), p. 479.</ref> Private television repeatedly showed Ch\u00e1vez's supporters on [[Puente Llaguno]] as they shot at Baralt Avenue below, an area purportedly full of opposition marchers.<ref name=\"gunson\" /> The film says this footage was edited to show the gunmen but not the people near them who were ducking to avoid being shot. It follows with images taken from above the bridge showing an empty Baralt Avenue, claiming that \"the opposition march had never taken that route\" and that Ch\u00e1vez's supporters were only returning fire.<ref name=\"chapter 8\" /> Gunson charges that this edit is itself a misrepresentation, stating that the film does not mention that both sets of marchers were fired upon, and taking issue with the implication that \"coup plotters\" were the shooters.<ref name=\"gunson\" /> In response, the filmmakers say, \"Nowhere in the film did we say that only [Ch\u00e1vez's supporters] were shot&nbsp;... Nobody can say with certainty who orchestrated the shootings.\"<ref name=\"respond\" /> Gunson also asserts that the footage of the empty street was taken earlier that day, citing an \"analysis of the shadows\" by Schalk,<ref name=\"gunson\" /> who created a counter-documentary, ''[[X-Ray of a Lie]]'', to examine ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'' \"scene by scene to uncover [its] narrative strategies and use of artifice\".<ref name=\"schiller 485\" /> Brian A. Nelson agreed with the analysis, claiming that Baralt Avenue was not as empty as the film portrays and that the filmmakers \"put a black bar at the top of the frame to hide the Metropolitan Police trucks that were still there\".<ref name=\"nelson 265\">Nelson (2009), p. 265.</ref> Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain reaffirmed their claim that the opposition did not pass below the Puente Llaguno bridge, citing eyewitness statements\u2014including one from ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]''{{'}}s deputy editor\u2014and an Australian documentary, ''Anatomy of a Coup'', that \"came to conclusions similar to our own\".<ref name=\"respond\" /> A Venezuelan documentary, ''[[Puente Llaguno: Claves de una Masacre]]'', also supported Bartley and \u00d3&nbsp;Briain's view.<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 55.</ref>\n\n===Timeline and media depictions===\nOther issues of contention include the lack of historical context; the film does not cover some of the events leading up to Ch\u00e1vez's ousting, including the long-running political crisis and the general strike. Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order. In June 2002, they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered \"how to defend themselves against possible&nbsp;... attacks\" from Ch\u00e1vez's supporters.<ref name=\"gunson\" /> In the film, this sequence is placed before the march. Bartley justified the action, saying that the residents' opinions were representative of those held \"long before\" the events of April 2002.<ref name=\"respond\" /> Responding to the critique, the BBC added a date stamp to the sequence for the film's repeat broadcast.<ref>Stoneman (2008), p. 51.</ref> Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor [[Freddy Bernal]] as he sings to a happy group of Ch\u00e1vez supporters in front of the palace.
