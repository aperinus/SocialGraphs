S. Van Dyke]], based on the April 18, [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. The film stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]] and [[Spencer Tracy]]. MacDonald's singing helped make this film a major hit, coming on the heels of her other 1936 blockbuster, ''[[Rose Marie (1936 film)|Rose Marie]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nOn New Year's Eve, 1905, saloon keeper \"Blackie\" Norton hires Mary Blake to sing in his bar, the ''Paradise Club'' on Pacific Street in the notorious [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California|Barbary Coast]] of San Francisco. Mary becomes a star attraction at the ''Paradise'', especially for her signature tune, [[Theme from San Francisco|\"San Francisco\"]]. Blackie's friend Matt predicts that Mary will not stay long on the \"Coast\".\n\nBlackie decides to run for the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] at the behest of his childhood friend Father Tim Mullen, who believes Blackie can use the supervisor position to implement reform.\n\nMary is hired by the Tivoli Opera House on [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]], where she becomes involved with [[Nob Hill]] scion Jack Burley. After her performance one night, Blackie visits Mary in her dressing room. Realizing she still loves him, Mary asks him to marry her. Blackie agrees, but their reunion is soon interrupted by Burley, who had proposed to Mary prior to the show. Burley appeals to Mary, but Blackie presents Mary with an ultimatum by asking if she wants to marry him or stay at the Tivoli. Mary chooses to return to the ''Paradise''.\n\nBackstage on the opening night of her return performance, Father Tim drops in and is angered by Mary's skimpy stage costume. He defies Blackie to put her on the stage in front of the rowdy ''Paradise'' audience. Mary decides to leave with the priest after Blackie strikes him in the face.\n\nMary goes back to Burley and meets his mother at her [[Nob Hill]] mansion. Mrs. Burley tells Mary that she had a \"Blackie\" in her younger days, but chose to marry the more steadfast Burley. This cements Mary's decision to accept Burley's proposal of marriage.\n\nOn the evening of April 17, 1906, Burley has the [[San Francisco Police Department]] [[Police raid|raid]] the ''Paradise''. Blackie, distraught about the future of his club, ends up at the city's annual Chickens Ball. After performances by acts from the other clubs, the MC requests the ''Paradise's'' entry. When no one steps on stage, Mary, just having learned of the club's closing, enters the competition on behalf of the ''Paradise''. She rouses the audience to join in a chorus of \"San Francisco\" and wins. but Blackie refuses the prize money and states that Mary had no right to sing on behalf of his club. Mary is about to leave the ball with Burley when [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|the earthquake hits the city]].\n\nAs Blackie wanders the devastated city searching for Mary, he finds Burley dead and Mrs. Burley distraught. Blackie also comes upon a dying Matt, who tells Blackie he was wrong about Mary. Blackie later meets Father Tim, who takes him to a homeless camp in [[Golden Gate Park]]. Blackie hears Mary singing \"[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]\" with those in mourning. As they reunite, word spreads through the camp that \"The fire's out!\" As people shout about building a new San Francisco, Blackie and Mary join the crowd as they leave the park marching arm-in-arm, singing \"[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Clark Gable]] as Blackie Norton\n* [[Jeanette MacDonald]] as Mary Blake\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Father Tim Mullin\n* [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]] as Jack Burley\n* [[Jessie Ralph]] as Mrs. Burley\n* [[Ted Healy]] as Mat\n* [[Shirley Ross]] as Trixie\n* [[Margaret Irving]] as Della Bailey\n* [[Harold Huber]] as Babe\n* [[Edgar Kennedy]] as Sheriff\n* [[Al Shean]] as The Professor\n* [[William Ricciardi]] as Signor Baldini\n* [[Kenneth Harlan]] as Chick\n* [[Roger Imhof]] as Alaska\n* [[Charles Judels]] as Tony (credited as Charles Judells)\n* [[Russell Simpson (actor)|Russell Simpson]] as Red Kelly\n* [[Bert Roach]] as Freddie Duane\n* [[Warren B.

The [[Barbary Coast, San Francisco|Barbary Coast]] barroom set was built on a special platform that rocked and shook to simulate the historic tremor (similar sets were built for the 1974 disaster film ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]''.)  The scene was slightly inaccurate, since the earthquake actually struck just after 5:00 A.M. on the morning of April 18, not the previous evening.\n\nFamous [[silent film]] directors [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]] worked on the film without credit. Griffith directed some of the mob scenes while von Stroheim contributed to the screenplay.<ref>{{harvnb|Dugan|2011|pp=128, 145}}</ref>\n\nThere are two versions of the ending. The original release features a stylish montage of then-current (1936) scenes of a bustling San Francisco, including Market Street and the construction of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. When the film was re-released in 1948, it was thought these scenes were dated and the film fades out on a single long shot of the modern business district. However, the TV and 16mm versions of the film seen in the 1950s and 60s were struck from the original version which includes the montage. The current DVD and cable version features the shorter, 1948 version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/|title=Ratings and Reviews for New Movies and TV Shows|website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nGable and Tracy also made two other films together, ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' and ''[[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]]'', before Tracy eventually insisted on the same [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]] clause in his [[MGM]] contract that Gable had enjoyed, effectively ending one of the American cinema's most famous screen teams.\n\nGable had played an extremely similar character also named \"Blackie\" two years earlier in the smash hit gangster epic ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'', with [[William Powell]] and [[Myrna Loy]].\n\n==Music==\nThe [[Theme from San Francisco|title song]] may be the best-remembered part of the film. It was composed by [[Bronis\u0142aw Kaper]] and [[Walter Jurmann]], with lyrics by [[Gus Kahn]]. It is sung by Jeanette MacDonald a half-dozen times in the film, and becomes an anthem for the survivors of the earthquake. It has now become a popular sentimental sing-along at public events such as the city's annual earthquake commemoration, as well as one of two official city songs; the other being \"[[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]\".<ref name=\"sfmuseum.org\">{{cite web |title=San Francisco's Official Songs |url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/song.html |website=www.sfmuseum.org}}</ref> At San Francisco's historic Castro Theatre, the pre-film organ performance always ends with the song as the organ console is lowered down before the film starts.<ref name=\"KALWNewOrgan\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kalw.org/post/organ-transplant-castro-theatres-mighty-wurlitzer#stream/0 |title=An organ transplant for the Castro Theatre's Mighty Wurlitzer |access-date=2019-04-08|work=kalw.org}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the film, the song \"[[Darktown Strutters' Ball|The Darktown Strutters Ball]]\" can be heard; this is a historically inaccurate inclusion, since the song was written in 1917.\n\nDuring the two operatic scenes in the film, MacDonald sang excerpts from [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[La Traviata]]''. Another song she sings is ''[[The Holy City (song)|The Holy City]]''.\n\n==Box office==\nAccording to MGM records the film grossed a total \u2013 domestic and foreign \u2013 of $5,273,000: $2,868,000 in the US and Canada<ref name=HollywoodDivaBook>{{cite book |last=Turk |first=Edward Baron |year=1998 |title=Hollywood Diva: A Biography of Jeanette MacDonald |publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21202-9|pages=[https://books.google.ie/books?id=ojOxCgHZLpUC&pg=PA364#v=twopage 364-365]}}</ref> and $2,405,000 elsewhere.
