A sequel to the film, ''[[Johnny English Strikes Again]]'' was released in October 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nEight years after the events of [[Johnny English|the first film]], Johnny English has been training at a monastery in [[Tibet]] to recover from the shame of a failed mission to protect the newly elected president in [[Mozambique]], which cost him his knighthood. Called back into service by [[MI7]] under new director Pamela \"Pegasus\" Thornton, English must investigate an assassination plot of the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] during talks with the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. He meets fellow agent Simon Ambrose, MI7's quartermaster Patch Quartermain, and junior agent Colin Tucker, assigned to be his assistant.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], English finds former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Titus Fisher, a member of Vortex, the group responsible for sabotaging English's Mozambique mission. Vortex holds a secret weapon unlocked by three keys, held by himself and two others. Fisher is killed by an elderly assassin disguised as a cleaner, and an accomplice steals his key. English chases the thief and recovers the key, only to have it taken by a faux flight attendant en route to [[London]]. He is humiliated in a meeting with the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and Pegasus when he attempts to present the key and the conspiracy. He compounds his disgrace by mistakenly attacking Pegasus\u2019s mother twice at a children's party after encountering the Killer Cleaner.\n\nKate Sumner, MI7's resident [[behavioral psychologist]], uses [[hypnosis]] to help English recall his suppressed memory of the Mozambique incident, revealing that another Vortex operative, former Russian [[KGB]] and renegade MI7 associate spy Artem Karlenko, is posing as millionaire Sergei Pudovkin. English and Tucker meet Karlenko at a golf course outside London, but the Killer Cleaner critically injures him during their game. English and Tucker bring Karlenko to a hospital by helicopter, but he dies after revealing the third key is held by a mole in MI7.\n\nOver dinner, English confides with Ambrose about the mole, and Ambrose tells him he suspects Quartermain. In the restaurant's toilets, Tucker confronts Ambrose about him being the traitor, but English naively dismisses Tucker, letting Ambrose go with Karlenko's key. English confronts Quartermain at a church, but realizes that he has been framed as the third Vortex member. Chased by MI7 agents, English manages to escape to Sumner's flat, after stealing Quartermain's heavily modified wheelchair.\n\nReviewing footage of the Mozambique mission, Sumner sees that the assassin was manipulated by a supposedly-destroyed mind control drug, [[C11H18N2O3|Timoxeline Barbebutenol]]. Ambrose comes to pick her up, and English realizes that he is the mole and third member of Vortex. Evading the Killer Cleaner by jumping down a garbage chute, English goes to the apartment where Tucker lives with his mother; English apologizes to Tucker and persuades him to join in infiltrating Le Bastion, a nigh-impregnable fortress in the [[Swiss Alps]] where the talks are to be held.\n\nAt the fortress, English accidentally activates a distress beacon, alerting the guards to their presence. He commands Tucker to knock him out and put him inside a body bag, so that they will be taken into the fortress. Inside, English manages to escape the body bag and warns Pegasus of the threat, but accidentally consumes a drink spiked with the drug, and subdues Pegasus on Ambrose's command.\n\nAssigning English as the Prime Minister's bodyguard in place of Pegasus, Ambrose orders him to assassinate the Chinese Premier using a pistol disguised as lipstick, initially designed for Pegasus; thanks to his monastic training, English tries to resist the drug. Tucker interrupts Ambrose's communication feed with music before Ambrose resets it, exposing himself as the traitor. English resists again and shoots Ambrose, who escapes, while the drug enters its lethal stage and English loses consciousness.\n\nSumner arrives and revives English with a passionate kiss. English pursues Ambrose down the mountainside, and they engage in a fistfight in a [[aerial tram|cable car]]. English overpowers Ambrose, but falls out of the carriage. Ambrose shoots at him, who tries to use his spy umbrella as a bulletproof shield, which is actually a [[missile launcher]] when he closes it. The missile destroys the carriage, killing Ambrose.\n\nVortex is shut down and English has his knighthood reinstated by Her Majesty the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]]. During the ceremony, the Killer Cleaner, disguised as the Queen, attacks English with the knighting sword before fleeing, leading English to restrain the real Queen. He only realises his mistake when the assassin is caught by the royal guards and police.\n\nDuring the credits, English prepares dinner for Sumner to the tune of \"[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Johnny English, an accident prone but good hearted MI7 agent.\n* [[Gillian Anderson]] as Pamela Thornton / Pegasus, the head of MI7.\n* [[Dominic West]] as Simon Ambrose, an MI7 agent and colleague of English.\n* [[Rosamund Pike]] as Kate Sumner, a behavioural psychologist at MI7, and English's love interest.\n* [[Daniel Kaluuya]] as Colin Tucker, an MI7 agent who becomes English's assistant and sidekick in his mission.\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Titus Fisher, an ex-CIA operative.\n* [[Tim McInnerny]] as Patch Quartermain, MI7's wheelchair-bound [[quartermaster]].\n* [[Pik-Sen Lim]] as the Killer Cleaner, a Vortex assassin disguised as a grey-haired house cleaner. \n* [[Stephen Campbell Moore]] as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Burn Gorman]] as Slater, a MI7 intelligence expert who works with Ambrose. \n* [[Togo Igawa]] as Ting Wang, English's mentor in Tibet and a MI7 sleeper agent.\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Artem Karlenko, a former Russian KGB double agent.\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as Chi Han Ly\n\nAdditionally, Atkinson's daughter Lily has a [[cameo appearance]] in the film as the girl who gets her helmet stolen by English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.com.au/lily-sastry-how-well-do-you-know-rowan-atkinsons-daughter|title = Lily Sastry: How well do you know Rowan Atkinson's daughter?}}</ref> [[Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume]] plays Madeleine, a deceivingly charming member of Vortex, responsible for luring English off his post in Mozambique.
