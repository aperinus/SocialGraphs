The film follows a boxer who sets out to get his life back on track after losing his wife in an accident and later his young daughter to child protective services. The film was released on July 24, 2015, by [[The Weinstein Company]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics, while Gyllenhaal and [[Oona Laurence|Oona Laurence's]] performances received positive reviews.\n\nThe movie was set in [[New York City]], but it was filmed in [[Pittsburgh]] and the nearby town of [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wtae.com/entertainment/extras-needed-for-new-jake-gyllenhaal-movie-to-film-in-pittsburgh-area/26097472#!bC316x|title='Southpaw' movie now filming in Downtown Pittsburgh|work=wtae|date=10 July 2014|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2014/08/17/City-native-Antoine-Fuqua-filmed-his-movie-here/stories/201408170027|title=Pittsburgh native Antoine Fuqua returns to direct 'Southpaw'|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=23 October 2014|date=2014-08-17}}</ref>\n\nThe film marked one of the last films to be scored by [[James Horner]] and the first of three posthumous releases to feature his music (the other two being ''[[The 33]]'' and ''[[The Magnificent Seven (2016 film)|The Magnificent Seven]]''). The film and the [[Southpaw (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack album]] are dedicated to his memory.\n\n==Plot==\n\nBilly \"The Great\" Hope ([[Jake Gyllenhaal]]) is a [[Professional boxing|professional boxer]], and the reigning champion in the Light Heavyweight division with an Orthodox stance and a won-loss record of 42-0, living in [[New York City]] with his wife Maureen ([[Rachel McAdams]]) and their only daughter Leila ([[Oona Laurence]]). During his match against Darius Jones (Cedric D. Jones) at Madison Square Garden, Maureen is scared as Billy takes several horrific hits to the face, resulting in profuse bleeding out of his eye. Billy wins the match by knockout and retains the light heavyweight title, despite nasty injuries.\n\nAs the press surrounds Billy, a younger upstart boxer, Miguel \"Magic\" Escobar ([[Miguel Gomez (actor)|Miguel Gomez]]), taunts Billy to fight him. Upon returning home, Maureen fears for Billy's safety and urges him to quit. Later at the Hope house, Maureen talks to Billy's manager Jordan Mains ([[50 Cent]]), and disagrees with his plan to get Billy to sign a two-year deal for three more fights.\n\nBilly and Maureen go to a fundraiser ball where Billy gives a speech, acknowledging Maureen, Leila, Jordan and his friends. Miguel is in attendance as well, and as Billy is leaving, Miguel goads him by insulting Maureen and saying he will take his titles away from him, leading to a brawl. A shot (from Miguel's brother Hector) rings out and Billy sees that Maureen has been shot. Hector flees while Maureen dies in Billy's arms.\n\nBilly begins abusing alcohol and drugs. Billy meets with Jordan, who suggests selling the house to solve his financial problems. Jordan then books Billy a fight against Kalil Turay, in which Billy gets beaten up so badly that his corner throws in the towel. Blinded by damage due to headshots, Billy accidentally headbutts the referee in the face. Billy is suspended for a year and has no income, while he owes the ref and the networks damages. His house and belongings are repossessed. Both Jordan and longtime trainer Eli Frost abandon him to work with Miguel.\n\nBilly runs his car into the tree outside his home one night. Leila finds Billy bleeding on the floor and calls 911. Billy wakes up in the hospital to learn that Leila is being put in the care of [[Child Protective Services]] officer Angela Rivera ([[Naomie Harris]]). With nowhere left to go, Billy visits the Wills Gym where he meets former boxer Tick Wills ([[Forest Whitaker]]), who is blind in one eye after his last fight left him injured. Billy wants Tick to get him back on his feet, but Tick knows about his drug problems and declines to train him. He offers Billy a janitorial job.\n\nBilly meets with Angela to see Leila. However, Leila blames him for their problems and refuses to see him. Billy returns to the gym and accepts the janitorial job. While working there, he befriends a boy named Hoppy ([[Skylan Brooks]]), who is also an aspiring boxer. He learns that Hoppy's father abuses his mother, which he reports to Tick. As he starts to make amends in his life, Billy continues visiting Leila, and his persistence wins her over. After winning a charity match, Billy is visited by Jordan. He now manages Miguel, who recently won the championship from Kalil Turay. Jordan wants to book a fight between the two within six weeks, knowing that Billy will not have enough time to train. Billy thinks he can make a comeback and wants Tick to train him, but Tick refuses, believing Billy just wants revenge.\n\nBilly later learns from Tick that Hoppy has died after trying to defend his mother from his father, who shot him. Lamenting that he could not save Hoppy, Tick decides to help Billy train for the upcoming fight. Noting his efforts to turn his life around, the judge grants Billy custody of Leila and she moves back in with him. Visiting Maureen's grave together, Billy tells Leila he is going to fight again, and grants her wish of letting her remain present.\n\nOn the night of the fight, Angela brings Leila into the dressing room where they watch it on TV. Miguel takes the early upper hand. Both fighters trade furious punches, round after round. Miguel then insults Maureen, causing Billy to lose concentration. In a fit of rage, Billy lashes out and almost stops the fight. Tick cautions Billy not to let Miguel control him. Billy controls his anger and in the final round, gains the upper hand against Miguel. In the final seconds, Billy blocks a jab from Miguel and lands a shot to the face before turning southpaw and, with a furious uppercut, sends Miguel to the canvas. Miguel gets up at the last second and both corners are filled with two teams' staffs.\n\nDespite a split decision giving the first rounds to Miguel, Billy is announced as the new champion. Billy then collapses in the corner, thanking Maureen and committing himself to Leila. Tick and the team lift him up on their shoulders as he closes his eyes tearfully and smiles. After the fight, Leila meets Billy in the dressing room, where they hug for the first time since Maureen's death. Billy says Maureen would be proud of her and she tells him she loves him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Billy \"The Great\" Hope<ref name=\"deadline1\">{{cite web|last=Busch |first=Anita |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/03/antoine-fuqua-closes-deal-to-direct-southpaw-jake-gyllenhaal-set-to-star/ |title=Antoine Fuqua To Direct 'Southpaw' Movie Starring Jake Gyllenhaal |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2014-03-06 |access-date=2014-06-21}}</ref>\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Titus \"Tick\" Wills<ref name=\"deadline2\"/>\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Maureen Hope<ref name=\"deadline2\">{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/twcs-southpaw-has-forest-whitaker-rachel-mcadams-and-lupita-nyongo-circling/ |title=Kurt Sutter's 'Southpaw' Movie Eyes Forest Whitaker, Rachel McAdams & Lupita Nyong'o |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2014-05-14 |access-date=2014-06-21}}</ref>\n* [[Oona Laurence]] as Leila Hope<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmovies/article/MATILDAs-Oona-Laurence-to-Star-in-Boxing-Drama-SOUTHPAW-20140619?PageSpeed=noscript |title=MATILDA's Oona Laurence to Star in Boxing Drama SOUTHPAW \u2013 BWWMoviesWorld |publisher=Broadwayworld.com |access-date=2014-06-21}}</ref>\t\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as Angela Rivera\n* [[Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson]] as Jordan Mains<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Emily |url=http://pagesix.com/2014/06/26/50-cent-joins-the-cast-of-jake-gyllenhaals-boxing-movie/ |title=50 Cent joins the cast of Jake Gyllenhaal's boxing movie |publisher=Page Six |date=2014-06-26 |access-date=2014-06-30}}</ref>\n* [[Miguel Gomez (actor)|Miguel Gomez]] as Miguel \"Magic\" Escobar<ref name=\"deadline4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/06/kaitlyn-dever-joins-the-greens-are-gone-miguel-gomez-cast-in-southpaw-richard-cabral-books-blood-father/ |title=Kaitlyn Dever Joins 'The Greens Are Gone'; Miguel Gomez Cast In 'Southpaw'; Richard Cabral Books 'Blood Father' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2014-06-06 |access-date=2014-06-21}}</ref> \n* Danny Henriquez as Hector Escobar\n* [[Rita Ora]] as Maria Escobar\n* [[Skylan Brooks]] as Hoppy\n* [[Victor Ortiz]] as Ramone<ref name=\"deadline3\">{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/06/southpaw-adds-ex-champ-victor-ortiz-to-southpaw-cast/ |title='Southpaw' Adds Ex-Champ Victor Ortiz To Cast |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2014-06-17 |access-date=2014-06-21}}</ref>\t\t\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Jon Jon<ref name=Knapp>{{cite news|title=Beau Knapp Joins 'Southpaw'|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/08/beau-knapp-southpaw-cullen-douglas-wrong-side-of-right/|access-date=August 8, 2014|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref>\t\n* [[Malcolm Mays]] as Gabe \n* [[Clare Foley]] as Alice\n* [[Jim Lampley]] as himself\n* [[Roy Jones Jr.]] as himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Eminem]] was originally supposed to play the role of Billy Hope. The film's screenwriter [[Kurt Sutter]] said the project was inspired by the rapper's personal struggles. He stated that he had taken meetings with Eminem's producing partners over the past seven years, looking for something to do together. \"I know he's very selective and doesn't do a lot. But he shared so much of his personal struggle in this raw and very honest album, one that I connected with on a lot of levels. He is very interested in the boxing genre, and it seemed like an apt metaphor, because his own life has been a brawl. In a way, this is a continuation of the ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' story, but we are doing a metaphorical narrative of the second chapter of his life. He'll play a world champion boxer who really hits a hard bottom, and has to fight to win back his life for his young daughter. At its core, this is a retelling of his struggles over the last five years of his life, using the boxing analogy. I love that the title refers to Marshall being a lefty, which is to boxing what a white rapper is to hip hop; dangerous, unwanted, and completely unorthodox. It's a much harder road for a [[Left-handed|southpaw]] than a right-handed boxer.\"<ref name=\"deadline5\"/> Producers Alan and Peter Riche have given a slightly different story about Eminem's involvement however stating that they set out to make a boxing movie similar to ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'' but wanted to make the story about a father-daughter relationship as opposed to
