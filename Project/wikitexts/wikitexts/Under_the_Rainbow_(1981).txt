[[Jerry Maren]], who had a role as a Munchkin in the original film, also appears in ''Under the Rainbow''. [[Location shooting|Filming locations]] include the original [[Culver Hotel]], which was used by the Munchkins during the filming of ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nThe film received widespread negative reception with critics due to its depiction of little people and use of [[sight gag]]s involving them. Earning just $8.3 million during its initial run, the film is considered a [[box office flop]]. It was nominated for two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for Joe Renzetti and Billy Barty.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Kansas]] 1938, little person Rollo Sweet lives in a homeless shelter while waiting for an offer from Hollywood with bus fare to California. Other residents crowd around a radio, but the reception is poor. Rollo climbs to the roof to fix the antenna, then slips and falls from the roof.\n\nIn [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], [[California]], near [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] Studios, a diverse group of people check into a hotel. Among the hotel guests are Annie Clark, a longsuffering employee at MGM; an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Duke|duke, duchess]], and their [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] escort Bruce Thorpe; Nazi secret agent Otto Kriegling; Kriegling's Japanese contact Nakamuri; a large group of Japanese photographers; and 150 little people, including Rollo Sweet, who have been cast as [[Munchkin]]s in MGM's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The hotel itself has been left in the hands of the owner's incompetent nephew Homer while the boss himself is out of town on business.\n\nThe characters' lives intertwine through various cases of mistaken identity. Kriegling incorrectly assumes his contact from Tokyo must be one of the photographers. Nakamuri, knowing only that his Nazi contact is a little person, believes he must be hidden among the Munchkins. Nazi military maps are smuggled into Annie's copy of the [[screenplay]] for ''The Wizard of Oz''. An assassin on the trail of the Duke and Duchess kills one of the Japanese tourists instead. Homer assumes Kriegling to be one of the Munchkins and carries him bodily off to the studio costume and makeup shop. Meanwhile, the Munchkins' constant drunken antics make life difficult for everyone.\n\nFinally, Krieger and Nakamuri corner Annie, Thorpe, the Duke and the Duchess in a hotel room, where the assassin makes one last attempt on the Duke's life. As he draws his gun, Nakamuri points his camera at the assassin. A bullet fires from the \"camera\" and the two shoot each other dead.\n\nKrieger points his sword at Annie's throat demanding to have the map, whereupon Thorpe tells him the map is hidden in a locket on the Duchess's dog's collar. Krieger runs out of the hotel front door after the dog, which runs onto the movie studio lot where it, Krieger, and the pursuing crowd of Munchkin actors disrupt the filming of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With The Wind.]]'' Krieger gets the locket and tries to get away in a vintage bus, with Sweet pursuing him in a horse-drawn carriage. The chase ends as the two crash.\n\nSweet wakes up back in Kansas. As in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' the whole story was a dream, populated by characters based on the other homeless people in the shelter. A bus full of little people pulls up to take Sweet to Hollywood.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Chevy Chase]] - Bruce Thorpe\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] - Annie Clark\n* [[Eve Arden]] - The Duchess\n* [[Joseph Maher]] - The Duke\n* [[Robert Donner]] - The Assassin\n* [[Billy Barty]] - Otto Kriegling\n* [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] - Nakomuri\n* [[Cork Hubbert]] - Rollo Sweet\n* [[Pat McCormick (actor)|Pat McCormick]] - Tiny\n* [[Adam Arkin]] - Henry Hudson\n* [[Zelda Rubinstein]] - Iris\n* [[Patty Maloney]] - Rosie\n* Peter Issacksen - Homer\n* [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]] - Hotel Rainbow Guest\n}}\n\n==Production==\nFred Bauer, Steve Rash and Ed Cohen had previously made ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'' together. In November 1979 the filmmakers announced they had signed a deal with the newly formed Orion Pictures to make the movie with Chevy Chase to star.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Schreger |first=Charles |date=November 7, 1979 |title=FILM CLIPS: Warner Bros.
