It was the last project developed by the father and son production team of [[Alexander Salkind|Alexander]] and [[Ilya Salkind]]. The film follows events after the fall of the [[Emirate of Granada]] (an Arab principality which was located in the south of [[Spain]]), and leads up to [[Discovery of the Americas|the voyage]] of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to the [[New World]] in 1492.\n\nIts behind-the-scenes history involved an elaborate series of financial mishaps, which later brought about an emotional falling-out between Alexander and Ilya;
