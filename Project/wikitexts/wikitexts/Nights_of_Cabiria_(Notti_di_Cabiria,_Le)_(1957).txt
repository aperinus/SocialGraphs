It stars [[Giulietta Masina]] as Cabiria, a prostitute living in Rome. The cast also features [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] and [[Amedeo Nazzari]]. The film is based on a story by Fellini, who expanded into a screenplay along with his co-writers [[Ennio Flaiano]], [[Tullio Pinelli]] and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]].\n\nBesides the best actress award at the [[1957 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] for Giulietta Masina, ''Nights of Cabiria'' won the 1957 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. This was the second straight year Italy and Fellini won this Academy Award, having won for ''[[La Strada]]'', which also starred Masina.\n\n==Plot==\nProstitute Cabiria and her lover Giorgio playfully chase each other through a field and up to the bank of a river. Oblivious to Giorgio's criminal intentions, Cabiria stands close to the edge of the water, before being pushed in to the river, and having her purse and money stolen. She is quickly saved by a group of onlooking bystanders who prevent her from drowning.\n\nCabiria returns to her small home, but Giorgio has disappeared. She is bitter, and when her best friend and neighbor, Wanda, tries to help her get over him, Cabiria shoos her away and remains disgruntled. One night, she is outside an upscale nightclub and witnesses a fight between famous movie star Alberto Lazzari and his girlfriend. The irritated Lazzari takes the starstruck Cabiria to another club where they dance the [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]], before returning to the movie star's house, where Cabiria is astounded by its opulence. The two share an intimate moment in Lazzari's bedroom, but are quickly interrupted by the intrusion of Lazzari's previous girlfriend. Cabiria is told to wait out the night in the bathroom, and ends up watching Lazzari and his girlfriend reconcile their relationship through the keyhole of the bathroom door.\n\nThe following day, a church procession passes by the street where Cabiria and her friends hang out. As her associates mock the Church, Cabiria is drawn to the procession. Just as she is about to join the procession, a man driving a truck pulls up and offers her a ride home. As she heads home later that night, she sees a man giving food to the poor people living in caves near her house. She has never seen this man before, but she is both impressed and confused by his charity toward others.\n\nThe following day, Cabiria and some of her friends attend a church mass, where she pleads the Virgin Mary for a better life. After the procession ends, Cabiria expresses sadness at the fact that her friends seemed to have not changed anything about their lives.\n\nCabiria goes to a magic show, and the magician drags her up on stage and hypnotizes her. As the audience laughs, she acts out her desires to be married and live a happy life. Furious at having been taken advantage of for the audience's amusement, she leaves in a huff. Outside the theatre, a man named Oscar is waiting to talk to her. He was in the audience, and he says he agrees with her that it was not right for everyone to laugh, but believes that fate has brought them together. They go for a drink, and at first she is cautious and suspicious, but after several meetings she falls passionately in love with him; they are to be married after only a few weeks. Cabiria is delighted and sells her home and takes out all her money from the bank. The sum of more than 700,000 lire in cash represents her dowry, and when she shows it to Oscar in a restaurant, he advises her to keep it in the purse. However, during a walk in a wooded area, on a cliff overlooking a lake,{{efn|Scenes were shot on location at [[Lake Bracciano]] near Rome.{{sfn|Kezich|2006|p=183}}}} Oscar becomes distant and starts acting nervous. Cabiria realizes that just like her earlier lover, Oscar intends to push her over the cliff and steal her money. She throws her purse at his feet, sobbing in convulsions on the ground and begging for him to kill her as he takes the money and abandons her.\n\nShe later picks herself up and stumbles out of the wood in tears. In the film's last sequence, Cabiria walks the long road back to town when she is met by a group of young people riding scooters, playing music, and dancing. They happily form an impromptu parade around her until she begins to smile, as a single black tear falls down her face.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Giulietta Masina]] as Cabiria Ceccarelli\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as Oscar D'Onofrio\n* [[Franca Marzi]] as Wanda\n* [[Dorian Gray (actress)|Dorian Gray]] as Jessy\n* [[Aldo Silvani]] as the wizard\n* [[Ennio Girolami]] Amleto the pimp\n* [[Amedeo Nazzari]] as Alberto Lazzari\n* [[Franco Fabrizi]] as Giorgio (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nThe name Cabiria is borrowed from the 1914 Italian film ''[[Cabiria]]'', while the character of Cabiria herself is taken from a brief scene in Fellini's earlier film, ''[[The White Sheik]]''. It was Masina's performance in that earlier film that inspired Fellini to make ''Nights of Cabiria''.<ref>This and the following facts about the film's production are taken from a [http://www.filmforum.org/films/cabiria/fellinioncabiria.doc series of interviews with Fellini] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927173035/http://www.filmforum.org/films/cabiria/fellinioncabiria.doc# |date=27 September 2011}}.</ref> However, no one in Italy was willing to finance a film which featured prostitutes as heroines. Finally, [[Dino de Laurentiis]] agreed to put up the money. Fellini based some of the characters on a real prostitute whom he had met while filming ''[[Il Bidone]]''. For authenticity, he had [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], known for his familiarity with Rome's criminal underworld, help with the dialogue.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sitney |first=P. Adams |author-link=P.

Its interest is not so much the conflicts that occur in the life of the heroine as the deep, underlying implications of human pathos that the pattern of her life shows...But there are two weaknesses in ''Cabiria.'' It has a sordid atmosphere and there is something elusive and insufficient about the character of the heroine. Her get-up is weird and illogical for the milieu in which she lives and her farcical mannerisms clash with the ugly realism of the theme.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/10/29/archives/the-screen-cabiria-giulietta-masina-stars-in-italian-import.html |title=The Screen: 'Cabiria'; Giulietta Masina Stars in Italian Import |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 October 1957 |access-date=14 August 2022}}</ref> Upon its original 1957 release, on the other hand, French director [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] thought ''Cabiria'' was Fellini's best film to date.<ref>{{cite book |last=Truffaut |first=Fran\u00e7ois |author-link=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXZaBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT350 |title=The Films in My Life |location=New York |publisher=[[Diversion Books]] |year=2014 |page=350 |isbn=978-1-62681-396-0}}</ref> The film ranked third on [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'s \"[[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's Annual Top 10 Lists|Top 10 Films of the Year List]]\" in 1957.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|title=Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951-2009|last=Johnson|first=Eric C.|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|archive-date=2012-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nForty years later, ''The New York Times'' carried a new review by Crowther's successor, [[Janet Maslin]].

''Nights of Cabiria'' is transitional; it points toward the visual freedom of ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' while still remaining attentive to the real world of postwar Rome. The scene involving the good samaritan provides a framework to show people living in city caves and under bridges, but even more touching is the scene where Cabiria turns over the keys of her house to the large and desperately poor family that has purchased it.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-nights-of-cabiria-1957 |title=Nights of Cabiria movie review (1957) |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=16 August 1998 |via=[[RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref> He gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his ''[[Great Movies]]'' list.\n\nIn 1998, the film was re-released, newly restored and now including a crucial 7-minute sequence (with the man giving food to the poor people living in caves) that censors had cut after the premiere.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nichols |first=Peter M. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/17/movies/film-restoring-what-time-and-editors-took-away.html |title=FILM; Restoring What Time, and Editors, Took Away |work=The New York Times |date=17 May 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527082312/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/17/movies/film-restoring-what-time-and-editors-took-away.html |archive-date=27 May 2015}}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ranked ''Nights of Cabiria'' at number 112 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/take/one/full_list.php3?category=10 |title=Take One: The First Annual Village Voice Film Critics' Poll |access-date=27 July 2006 |year=1999 |work=[[The Village Voice]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826201343/http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/take/one/full_list.php3?category=10 |archive-date=26 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 100% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 42 reviews.
