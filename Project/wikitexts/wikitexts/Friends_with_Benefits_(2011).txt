Over time, they begin to develop deep feelings for each other, only to deny it each time they are together.\n\nPrincipal casting for ''Friends with Benefits'' took place over a three-month period from April to July 2010. Gluck reworked the original script and plot shortly after casting Timberlake and Kunis. Filming began in New York City on July 20, 2010, and concluded in Los Angeles in September 2010. [[Screen Gems]] distributed the film, which was released in North America on July 22, 2011. ''Friends with Benefits'' was generally well received by film critics, most of whom praised the chemistry between the lead actors. The  film became a commercial success at the box office, grossing $149.5 million worldwide, against a budget of $35 million. It was nominated for two [[People's Choice Awards]]\u2014Favorite Comedy Movie, and Favorite Comedic Movie Actress (Kunis)\u2014and two [[Teen Choice Awards]] for Timberlake and Kunis.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should not exceed 700 words. -->\nJamie Rellis, an executive [[recruitment|headhunter]] in New York City, recruits Dylan Francis Harper Jr., a Los Angeles art director, to interview for a position with ''[[GQ]]'' magazine. Initially skeptical, Dylan accepts the job after a night exploring the city with Jamie. He moves to New York, signing a one-year contract that earns Jamie a commission, and they become close [[platonic love|platonic friends]]. One night, after agreeing that sex should not require emotional attachment, they have purely casual sex. After several trysts together, Jamie decides to start dating again, and she and Dylan return to simply being friends.\n\nJamie meets Parker, an [[Oncology|oncologist]]. After five dates, they consummate their relationship, only for him to break up with her in the morning. When Jamie's free-spirited mother, Lorna, abandons their [[Fourth of July]] weekend plans, Dylan persuades Jamie to travel with him to Los Angeles. There, she meets his sister Annie, nephew Sammy, and his father, who suffers from the early stages of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Though Jamie and Dylan assure his family that they are merely friends, they spend an intimate night together and have sex again. The next day, Jamie overhears Dylan tell Annie that Jamie is too \"damaged\" for him to date. Hurt, she flies home and ignores Dylan's attempts to reach her. He finds her on the roof of a skyscraper \u2013 a place she showed him the day they met \u2013 where she reveals that she overheard everything he said, and ends their friendship.\n\nSome time later, Jamie discovers that Dylan may be leaving ''GQ'' for another job before his contract ends, which would affect her commission. She confronts him, leading to another argument. Jamie spends time with her mother, while Dylan meets his father at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]]. In a moment of Alzheimer's-induced confusion, his father mistakes a passer-by for a woman from his past. Regaining his lucidity, he explains that he met \"the love of my life\" before marrying Dylan's mother, but let her go. Dylan's father urges him not to do the same, and to reconcile with Jamie.\n\nRealizing his true feelings for Jamie, Dylan calls Lorna to set up an excuse for Jamie to go to [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]], where he surprises her with a [[flash mob]] dancing to \"[[Jump (Kris Kross song)|Jump]]\" and  \"[[Closing Time (Semisonic song)|Closing Time]]\". After confessing his feelings to her and sharing a passionate kiss, Dylan suggests they go on their first real date. They go across the street to the [[Pershing Square Building|Pershing Square caf\u00e9]], and are unable to keep their hands off each other.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Dylan and Jamie watch [[outtake]]s from the fictional romantic comedy seen throughout the film.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Dylan\n* [[Mila Kunis]] as Jamie\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Lorna\n* [[Jenna Elfman]] as Annie\n* [[Bryan Greenberg]] as Parker\n* [[Nolan Gould]] as Sam\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Mr. Harper\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Tommy\n* [[Emma Stone]] as Kayla\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Quincy\n* [[Shaun White]] as himself\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as Flight attendant\n* [[Tiya Sircar]] as Hostess\n* [[Jason Segel]] as Bryce (uncredited)\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Madison (uncredited)\n\nCredits adapted from [[AllMovie]] and ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Friends with Benefits (2011) |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/friends-with-benefits-v529802/cast-crew |publisher=[[AllMovie]] |access-date=August 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219092223/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/friends-with-benefits-v529802/cast-crew |archive-date=December 19, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title=Friends With Benefits recap: unsexy bestie sex |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/05/friends-with-benefits-recap-sex |access-date=September 11, 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 5, 2013 |url-status= live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221083631/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/05/friends-with-benefits-recap-sex |archive-date=December 21, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Southwest corner of Central Park, looking east, NYC.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Filming locations of the film on several sections in [[New York City]], including [[Central Park]] (''pictured'').]]\nIn April 2010, [[Justin Timberlake]] became the first to sign on to the project.<ref>{{cite web|title=Justin Timberlake Gets Between Sheets On Comedy In Menage A Trois Title Battle |url=https://deadline.com/2010/04/justin-timberlake-gets-between-sheets-on-comedy-in-menage-a-trois-title-battle-30772/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=August 29, 2015 |date=April 6, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921051625/http://deadline.com/2010/04/justin-timberlake-gets-between-sheets-on-comedy-in-menage-a-trois-title-battle-30772/ |archive-date=September 21, 2015 }}</ref> He was soon followed by [[Mila Kunis]] when she landed the female lead opposite him.
