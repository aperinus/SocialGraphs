It stars [[Liam James]] as Duncan, an introverted 14-year-old who goes on summer vacation to [[Wareham, Massachusetts]] with his mother and her overbearing boyfriend. It also stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Allison Janney]], [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Sam Rockwell]], and [[Maya Rudolph]], with [[Rob Corddry]], [[Amanda Peet]], Faxon, and Rash in supporting roles.\n\nFaxon and Rash conceived the film in the early 2000s; however, it spent several years in [[development hell]] before funding could be secured. Eventually, [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] (the same studio which distributed other independent films such as ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' and ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'') agreed to distribute the film. Filming lasted several months during summer 2012. It premiered at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]],<ref name=\"filmguide.sundance.org\">{{cite web|url=http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13111/the_way_way_back |title=The Way, Way Back |publisher=[[The Sundance Institute]] |work=[[Sundance Film Festival]] |access-date=March 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230211222/http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13111/the_way_way_back |archive-date=December 30, 2012 }}</ref> and had a wider release on July 5, 2013, where it received positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing $26.9 million against its $5 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIntroverted 14-year-old Duncan from [[Albany, New York]], reluctantly goes on summer vacation to a beach house in a small seaside town near [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]], with his mother, Pam; her wealthy boyfriend, Trent; and Trent's arrogant daughter, Steph. Trent emotionally belittles Duncan, frequently making comments and gestures that are condescending and rude to him. Steph follows suit in attitude towards him and is spoiled by Trent. On the way to the beach house, Trent asks Duncan to rate himself on a scale of one to ten; Duncan rates himself a six while Trent tells him he thinks Duncan is a three. They arrive at the beach house and are greeted by the neighbors: the gregarious, hard-drinking Betty, her children Susanna and Peter, and married couple Kip and Joan. Later that evening, Duncan and Susanna have an awkward conversation from their adjacent porches.\n\nDuncan discovers a small [[Step-through frame|girl's bicycle]] in the garage of the beach house and uses it to begin exploring the town. At a pizza restaurant, he runs into the staff of [[Water Wizz]], the local [[water park]]. He meets Owen, who is playing ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and eventually Owen takes Duncan under his wing and shows him around the park. Duncan meets the park's colorful, rag-tag group of employees: Caitlin, Lewis, and Roddy. Several youths at the water park speak reverently of a legendary pass in the tube slide, wondering how it could have been done. Owen hires Duncan for odd jobs at Water Wizz.\n\nOutside the park, Duncan is continually neglected by his mother, Pam, who indulges in drinking, staying out at night, and smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] with other adult vacationers. At a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] cookout, Susanna sees that he is upset about this and invites him to go hunting for [[ghost crab]]s with her and Peter, where she talks about her absent father and helps Duncan open up. Later that night, Duncan witnesses Trent and Joan kissing by the side of the house, but does not reveal what he saw.\n\nPam begins to suspect Trent and Joan are having an affair, but Trent convinces her nothing is going on. Later, Duncan confronts Pam in front of friends and neighbors and tells her to face up to Trent's affair and get rid of him. Trent interjects, and Duncan insults and shoves him; Trent indignantly tells Duncan his divorced father does not want him. Duncan stalks away. Susanna follows him and comforts Duncan out on the beach. Duncan attempts to kiss Susanna, but she moves away, which makes him become even more upset. Accompanied by Peter, Duncan sneaks away to Water Wizz where Owen is throwing a going-away party for Lewis.\n\nAfter spending all night with his friends at Water Wizz, Duncan is still at the park the next morning, refusing to leave. When Owen confronts him, Duncan opens up about his relationship with Trent and how the water park is the only place where he feels happy and accepted. Owen sympathizes with Duncan, recalling his upbringing where he was forced to abide to strict rules and patterns. He advises Duncan to disregard Trent's criticisms and go his own way.\n\nWhen Duncan returns to the beach house, Pam tells him they are leaving with Trent and Steph. Betty and her kids arrive to say their goodbyes. Susanna finally kisses Duncan. When Trent stops for gas on their way out of town, Duncan jumps out of the station wagon and runs to Water Wizz, followed by his mother, then Trent and Steph. Duncan tells Owen and the other employees that he has to leave and tells Owen to follow him. He takes Owen to the Devil's Peak slide, and Duncan becomes the first person to ever pass someone in the water slide while the rest of the park watches. After finally introducing Owen to his mother, Duncan says goodbye to everyone at the park. Owen tells Pam of Duncan\u2019s good nature, and introduces himself to Trent as \"a good friend of the three\". Trent then attempts to bypass Owen in order to bring Duncan back to the car, but Owen blocks him and Trent retreats. Duncan hugs and thanks Owen \"for everything.\" Trent, Steph, Pam and Duncan regroup in the car, where Pam finally stands up for herself as they head out of town. Pam climbs to the \u201cway way back\u201d of the car where Duncan is sitting, and they share a smile as Trent's protests are heard in the background.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liam James]] as Duncan\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Trent Ramsey\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Pam\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Owen\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Betty Thompson\n* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as Susanna Thompson\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Caitlin\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Kip\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Joan\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Lewis\n* [[Nat Faxon]] as Roddy\n* [[Robert Capron]] as Kyle\n* [[River Alexander]] as Peter Thompson\n* [[Ava Deluca-Verley]] as Katy\n* [[Zoe Levin]] as Steph Ramsey\n* [[Adam Riegler]] as Neil\n* [[Jake Picking]] as Chad}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n{{Anchor|Release|Box office}}\nThe film had its premiere screening at the 2013 [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name=\"filmguide.sundance.org\" /> It was one of the most financially successful films to come out of the festival that year, outperforming well-known entries and Oscar-nominated films from the previous year.<ref name=\"thewrap\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/how-have-those-sundance-pick-ups-performed-box-office-109211|title=Sundance 2013 Pickups Are Outperforming Last Year's Crop |work=[[TheWrap]]|date=August 8, 2013|first=Todd|last=Cunningham|access-date=March 23, 2014}}</ref> It was released on July 5, 2013 in 19 theaters and surpassed box office expectations, averaging an impressive $30,263 per screen and grossing $525,000 for the weekend.<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/specialty-box-office-way-way-back-scores-strong-debut-midnight-tops-sunrise-and-sunset|first=Peter|last=Knegt|date=July 8, 2013|title=Specialty Box Office: 'Way, Way Back' Scores Strong Debut; 'Midnight' Tops 'Sunrise' and 'Sunset'|work=[[IndieWire]]|access-date=March 23, 2014}}</ref> On July 15, 2013, it was added to an additional 60 theaters and grossed $1,110,000.
