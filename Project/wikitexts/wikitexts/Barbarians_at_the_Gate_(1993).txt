The film stars [[James Garner]], [[Jonathan Pryce]], and [[Peter Riegert]]. It tells the true story of [[F. Ross Johnson]], who was the president and CEO of [[RJR Nabisco]].\n\n''Barbarians at the Gate'' received generally positive reviews from critics. The film earned nine nominations at the [[45th Primetime Emmy Awards]], winning one for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding Made for Television Movie]]. It also won [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Miniseries or Television Film]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film|Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film]] for Garner at the [[51st Golden Globe Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nSelf-made multimillionaire F. Ross Johnson, CEO of [[RJR Nabisco]], decides to take the tobacco and food conglomerate company private in 1988 after receiving advance news of the likely market failure of the company's smokeless [[cigarette]] called [[Premier (cigarette)|Premier]], the development of which had been intended to finally boost the company's stock price.<ref>{{cite news |title=Those Good Old Takeover Days |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDB113CF93BA25750C0A965958260 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 18, 1993 }}</ref>\n\nThe free-spending Johnson's bid for the company is opposed by two of the pioneers of the [[leveraged buyout]], Henry Kravis and his cousin. Kravis feels betrayed when, after Johnson initially discusses doing the LBO with Kravis, he takes the potentially enormous deal to another firm, the [[Shearson Lehman Hutton]] division of [[American Express]].\n\nOther bidders emerge, including [[Theodore J. Forstmann|Ted Forstmann]] and his company, [[Forstmann Little & Company|Forstmann Little]], after Kravis and Johnson are unable to reconcile their differences. The bidding goes to unprecedented heights, and when executive Charles Hugel becomes aware of how much Johnson stands to profit in a transaction that will put thousands of Nabisco employees out of work, he quips, \"Now I know what the 'F' in F. Ross Johnson stands for.\" The greed is so evident, Kravis's final bid is declared the winner, even though Johnson's was higher.\n\nThe title of the book and movie comes from a statement by Forstmann in which he calls Kravis' money \"phoney [[junk bond]] crap\" and how he and his brother are \"real people with real money,\" and that to stop raiders like Kravis: \"We need to push the barbarians back from the city gates.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[James Garner]] as [[F.
