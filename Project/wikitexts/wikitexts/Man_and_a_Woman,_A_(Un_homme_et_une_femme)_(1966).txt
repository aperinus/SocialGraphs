Still working as a film script supervisor, Anne divides her time between her home in [[Paris]] and [[Deauville]] in northern France where her daughter attends boarding school. A young widower, Jean-Louis ([[Jean-Louis Trintignant]]), is raising his son Antoine ([[Antoine Sire]]) alone following the death of his wife Valerie (Valerie Lagrange) who committed suicide after Jean-Louis was in a near fatal crash during the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Still working as a race car driver, Jean-Louis divides his time between Paris and Deauville where his son also attends boarding school.\n\nOne day Anne and Jean-Louis meet at the Deauville boarding school after Anne misses the last train back to Paris. Jean-Louis offers her a lift and the two become acquainted during the drive home, enjoying each other's company. When he drops her off, he asks if she would like to drive up together the following weekend, and she gives him her phone number. After a busy week at the track preparing for the next race, Jean-Louis calls and they meet early Sunday morning and drive to Deauville in the rain. Clearly attracted to each other, they enjoy a pleasant Sunday lunch with their children who get along well. Later that afternoon they go for a boat ride followed by a walk on the beach at sunset.  \n \nJean-Louis spends the following week preparing for and driving in the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in southeast France. Every day, Anne closely follows news reports of the race, which takes place in poor weather conditions along the icy roads of the [[French Riviera]]. Of the 273 cars that started the race, only 42 were able to finish, including Jean Louis's white [[Ford Mustang]], number 145. Watching the television coverage of the conclusion of the race, Anne sends Jean-Louis a telegram that reads, \"Bravo! I love you. Anne.\"\n\nThat night at a dinner for the drivers at the [[Monte Carlo Casino]], Jean-Louis receives the telegram and leaves immediately. He jumps into the other Mustang (number 184) used during the race and drives through the night to Paris, telling himself that when a woman sends a telegram like that, you go to her no matter what. Along the way he imagines what their reunion will be like. At her Paris apartment, Jean-Louis learns that Anne is in Deauville, so he continues north. Jean-Louis finally arrives in Deauville and finds Anne and the two children playing on the beach. When they see each other, they run into each other's arms and embrace.\n\nAfter dropping their children off at the boarding school, Jean-Louis and Anne drive into town where they rent a room and begin to make love with passionate tenderness. While they are in each other's arms, however, Jean-Louis senses that something is not right. Anne's memories of her deceased husband are still with her and she feels uncomfortable continuing. Anne says it would be best for her to take the train back to Paris alone. After dropping her off at the station, Jean-Louis drives home alone, unable to understand her feelings. On the train Anne can only think of Jean-Louis and their time together. Meanwhile, Jean-Louis drives south through the French countryside to the Paris train station, just as her train is arriving. As she leaves the train, she spots Jean-Louis and is surprised, hesitates briefly, and then walks toward him and they embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=28em}}\n* [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] as Anne Gauthier\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as Jean-Louis Duroc\n* [[Pierre Barouh]] as Pierre Gauthier\n* [[Val\u00e9rie Lagrange]] as Valerie Duroc\n* {{illm|Antoine Sire|fr|Antoine Sire}} as Antoine Duroc\n* [[Souad Amidou]] as Fran\u00e7oise Gauthier\n* {{illm|Henri Chemin|fr|Henri Chemin}} as Jean Louis' co-driver\n* {{illm|Yane Barry|fr|Yane Barry}} as Jean Louis' mistress\n* [[Paul Le Person]] as Petrol pump attendant\n* [[Simone Paris]] as Head Mistress\n* {{illm|Gerard Sire|fr|Gerard Sire}} as Radio commentator\n* [[G\u00e9rard Larrousse]] as Rally driver\n* {{illm|Jean Collomb|fr|Jean Collomb}} as the waiter\n* Clive Roberts as Rally driver<ref name=\"imdbcast\">{{cite web|title=Full cast and crew for A Man and a Woman |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061138/fullcredits#cast |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Story and script===\nAccording to director [[Claude Lelouch]], the story originated from an experience following his disappointment trying to get a distribution deal for his film ''[[Les Grands Moments]]''. As was his habit during troubling times, he went for a long drive and ended up on the shore at [[Deauville]] at 2:00 am. After a few hours sleep in the car, he was awakened by the sunrise and saw a woman walking on the beach with her daughter and a dog. This sparked his creativity which led to the story and script which he co-wrote with [[Pierre Uytterhoeven]] within a month.<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video|people=Claude Lelouch (Director) |title=A Man and a Woman: 37 Years Later |medium=DVD |publisher=Warner Brothers |location=Burbank |year=1994 |url= }}</ref>\n\nThe title may have come from a line in the film, Jean-Louis and Anne are listening to the news on the radio driving in a fast Ford Mustang and a commentator says \"A man and a woman have just died after skidding in a powerful car\".

We really brought each other a lot. He changed his method of acting while working with me, and I began to truly understand what directing actors was all about, working with him. I think the relationship between a director and actor is the same relationship as in a love story between two people. One cannot direct an actor if you do not love him or her. And he cannot be good if he or she does not love you in turn.<ref name=\"simon\">{{cite web|last=Simon |first=Alex |title=Claude Lelouch |publisher=The Hollywood Interview |url=http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/04/claude-lelouch-hollywood-interview.html |access-date=March 31, 2012}}</ref>}}\nFor the female lead, Trintignant asked Lelouch who his ideal woman would be, and Lelouch indicated [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], who had appeared in Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960) and ''[[8\u00bd]]'' (1962). Trintignant happened to be a close friend of hers and told him to call her. When he did, she accepted without reading the script. Although early disagreements and the low-budget skeleton crew caused initial tension between the director and actress, they quickly resolved their differences and the two went on to become close friends.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nOnce the script was drafted, the film was made relatively quickly, with one month of preproduction work, three weeks of principal photography, and three weeks editing.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> Due to budget constraints, he used an older handheld camera that was not soundproof, so blankets were frequently employed to dampen the camera noise.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\nLelouch is considered a pioneer in mixing different film stocks: black-and-white with color, and 35mm with 16mm and super 8. For years film critics debated the symbolism of the mixed film stocks, but Lelouch acknowledged that the primary reason was that he was running out of money, and black and white stock was cheaper.<ref name=\"simon\"/> His original plan involved shooting strictly in black and white, but when an American distributor offered him $40,000 to film in color, he filmed the outdoor sequences in color, and the indoor scenes in black and white.<ref name=\"dvd\"/>\n\nThe music soundtrack was recorded prior to filming, and Lelouch would play the music on the set to inspire the actors.<ref name=\"dvd\"/> Lelouch encouraged his actors to improvise some of the dialogue, and several key scenes were improvised. The climactic scene at a train station was not scripted at the time of shooting, and Aim\u00e9e did not know that director Lelouch had decided on the two main characters reuniting at the end. The look of surprise on Aim\u00e9e's face is genuine.<ref name=\"allmovie\">{{cite web|last=Erickson |first=Hal |title=A Man and a Woman |website=Allmovie |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/a-man-and-a-woman-v31060 |access-date=March 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot, among others, in [[Paris]], [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Deauville]].
