The film stars [[Rose McGowan]], [[Rebecca Gayheart]], and [[Julie Benz]] as girls in an exclusive [[clique]] in their high school. [[Charlotte Ayanna]] has a non-speaking cameo role as the murdered fourth member of the group. The film was inspired by the 1988 film ''[[Heathers]]'', and is often compared to it, particularly the plot involving a popular female clique, the use of bright pastels, and the ostensibly accidental killing of one of its members.\n\nOf his concept for the film, Stein has stated, \"The jawbreaker just came to represent the duality of the poppy sweetness of the girls, of high school and of youth, versus the whole idea that this thing could break your jaw\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/021999jaw-film-review.html|title='Jawbreaker': Teen Queens of Mean |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 19, 1999 |access-date=December 20, 2018 }}</ref> The film was released on February 19, 1999, and was a critical and financial failure, although it has come to gain a cult following.

The kidnappers turn out to be Liz's friends\u2014Courtney, Marcie, and Julie\u2014playing a prank on her for her birthday, which they do annually. When the girls drive up to a diner to treat Liz to breakfast, they open the trunk and discover she is dead, having choked to death on the jawbreaker Courtney had used to gag her.\n\nJulie wants to go to the police, but Courtney forbids her. Courtney calls the school pretending to be Liz's mother and tells them Liz is ill and cannot attend school, then the three go to school as though nothing had happened. Fern Mayo, school outcast and fervent admirer of Liz Purr, is sent by the school principal, Miss Sherwood, to deliver Liz's homework at the end of the day. She stumbles upon the three girls at Liz's house trying to arrange her corpse in bed. Courtney tries to fabricate a story that Liz died at the hands of a rapist.\n \nFern attempts to flee the house, but the girls catch her and Courtney buys her silence by accepting her into the clique, telling her to take Liz's place, despite Julie's protests. Courtney and Marcie give Fern a total makeover. Courtney introduces Fern to the high school as a completely different person, the attractive new student \"Vylette\". Julie, overwhelmed with guilt at her part in Liz's death, breaks away from the clique, reviled by Courtney and Marcie. As her popularity dissolves, Julie finds solace with drama student Zack and they eventually form a romantic relationship.\n\nJulie threatens to go to the police and tell the truth, but Courtney retorts that she, Marcie, and now Vylette will claim Julie killed Liz if she attempts to expose them. Handling the investigation on Liz's mysterious death is Detective Cruz. Courtney approaches the detective and spins a web of lies, \"revealing\" that Liz used to secretly bring older men into her bedroom to have sex with them, eventually being raped and murdered by one. Upon learning this information from Cruz, Julie surmises that it was Courtney who, at the night of the murder, seduced a stranger at a sleazy bar and had sex with him in Liz's bed in order to frame him for the crime.\n\nMeanwhile, Vylette becomes intoxicated with her new-found popularity, which has eclipsed Courtney's own. Courtney orders Vylette to learn her place, but Vylette vows that if Courtney does not watch her step, then she will reveal the truth behind Liz's death. In response, Courtney and Marcie post enlarged yearbook photocopies of Fern Mayo all over the school with the message, \"Who is Vylette?\" written on them, exposing Vylette's true identity and humiliating her in front of all the students. Julie and Zack take pity on Fern and both girls make amends with each other.\n\nRemorseless for the lives she has destroyed, Courtney attends the senior [[prom]] with [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] Dane Sanders. Meanwhile, Julie is at home going through a bag of Liz's belongings that were given to her. She finds a recordable greeting card she was fiddling with when Courtney was faking Liz's death scene, on which Courtney's admission to the killing was inadvertently recorded: \"I KILLED LIZ! I KILLED THE TEEN DREAM! DEAL WITH IT!\" Armed with this evidence, Julie, Fern, and Zack hurry to the prom.\n\nWhen Dane and Courtney are announced as Prom King and Queen, Zack sneaks backstage with the greeting card and broadcasts Courtney's confession over the sound system. Shocked and disgusted, Dane abandons Courtney while Marcie hides under a table. Horrified that her crime has been exposed, Courtney races for the exit as the rest of the furious students pelt her with corsages, call her names, and use profanity. Julie snaps a picture of the now disgraced Courtney to immortalize the occasion.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rebecca Gayheart]] as Julie Freeman\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as [[Courtney Shayne]]\n* [[Julie Benz]] as Marcie \"Foxy\" Fox\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Fern \"Vylette\" Mayo\n* Chad Christ as Zack Tartak\n* [[Charlotte Ayanna]] as Elizabeth \"Liz\" Purr\n* [[Ethan Erickson]] as Dane Sanders\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Detective Vera Cruz\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Principal Sherwood\n* [[Marilyn Manson]] as The Stranger\n* [[Tatyana Ali]] as Brenda\n* [[William Katt]] as Mr. Purr\n* [[P.
