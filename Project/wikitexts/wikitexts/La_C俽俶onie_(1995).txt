The film echoes the case of [[Christine and Lea Papin]], two French maids who brutally murdered their employer's wife and daughter in 1933, as well as the 1947 play they inspired, ''[[The Maids]]'' by [[Jean Genet]].<ref>[[:fr:La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie (film, 1995)]]</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n''La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie'' tells the story of a young woman, Sophie Bonhomme ([[Sandrine Bonnaire]]),<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071208231343/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135028/La-C-233-r-233-monie/overview New York Times Review]</ref> who is hired as a maid by the Leli\u00e8vre family. The Leli\u00e8vres live in an isolated mansion in [[Brittany]]. The family consists of four members: Catherine ([[Jacqueline Bisset]]) and Georges, the parents, who have no children together, but one each from previous marriages. Gilles is Catherine's and her ex-husband's son. He is a lonely teenager who loves reading and has a passion for arts in general. Melinda is Georges' and his late wife's daughter. She studies at a university and only spends the weekends at home, where she invites her boyfriend J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. The household chores are excessive for Catherine \u2013 who owns her own art gallery \u2013 so she requires a maid's help and hires Sophie. Throughout the film Sophie avoids using the [[dishwasher]], refuses to take driving lessons, buys fake eyeglasses, and has trouble giving a cashier the correct change. The viewer finds out later that Sophie is illiterate and has a history of violence since she is believed to have killed her disabled father, or at least not to have rescued him from the fire she might have set in his house.\n\nOnce in the small village, Sophie meets Jeanne ([[Isabelle Huppert]]), the postmistress, who occasionally works in a charity and reads a lot. However, Jeanne proves to be a bad influence on the maid since she is jealous and aggressive towards a lot of people, including the Leli\u00e8vres, whose mail she vandalises. She also has a violent history: she was charged with the murder of her four-year-old daughter, but she was later acquitted. The two friends meet regularly either for a charity project (that they end up ruining) or for a film; television being Sophie's main pastime. Sophie is treated rather nicely at the Leli\u00e8vres, who mean well towards her, but their patronizing attitude and the affection they have for each other create a feeling of jealousy and frustration both in Sophie and in Jeanne. This frustration reaches its climax when Georges fires Sophie for attempting to blackmail Melinda, who found out about her illiteracy. It is what triggers the climax of the film, which sees Sophie and Jeanne seize Georges\u2019 shotguns and murder the family who were watching an opera on television.\n\nJeanne leaves the crime scene and is killed in a car accident by the priest who had fired her from the charity she worked for. Sophie, for her part, walks away from the house after having wiped their fingerprints off the guns, making her way through the police squads at the accident. The end credits begin with the music of the opera that is being played back by a policeman on Melinda's tape-recorder, which Jeanne stole and put in her car. At the end of the credits, the gunshots can be heard on the tape and then the voices of Jeanne and Sophie, constituting evidence against them. Chabrol presents an ambiguous view of culture and class conflict in this film, which he jokingly called \"the last Marxist film.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311101541/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=P8&xml=/arts/2006/04/15/bfdvd15.xml DVDs of the week: ''The Night of The Shooting Stars'', ''Day of the Dead'' and more] 15 April 2006</ref>\n\n==Reviews==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports 93% approval for ''La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie'', with 26 of 28 reviews positive.<ref>''[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1075705-ceremonie/ La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie]'' at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]</ref> On 17 April 2012, Roger Ebert added ''La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie'' to his list of \"Great Movies\".<ref>''[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-la-ceremonie-1995 La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie]'' at [[Roger Ebert]]</ref>\n\n''[[The Guardian]]'' included ''La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie'' at #16 in its \"25 Best Crime Films of All Time\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/la-ceremonie-crime|title=La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie: No 16 best crime film of all time|website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=17 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nCraig Williams on the BFI website calls it \"perhaps Chabrol\u2019s greatest achievement\", and \"the consummate example of Chabrol\u2019s genius \u2013 a ruthlessly exacting vision of class indebted to both the pulp aesthetic... and French literary tradition.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/claude-chabrol-10-essential-films|title=Claude Chabrol: 10 essential films|website=British Film Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>\n\n[[The Criterion Collection]] called La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie \"a must-see late-career triumph [...] [that] exemplifies the New Wave auteur\u2019s mastery of suspense and twisted psychodrama.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Criterion Channel |author-link=Criterion Channel |user=criterionchannl |number=1239637789425242112 |date=16 March 2020 |title=LA C\u00c9R\u00c9MONIE (1995)\u2014a must-see late-career triumph from Claude Chabrol starring Sandrine Bonnaire and Isabelle Huppert\u2014exemplifies the New Wave auteur\u2019s mastery of suspense and twisted psychodrama. https://t.co/DWn38QVxy9 https://t.co/n6Q4iOpo9p |language=en |access-date=24 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211015021104/https://twitter.com/criterionchannl/status/1239637789425242112 |archive-date=15 October 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film is available on the [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion Channel]] for streaming.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]''' (France)\n**'''Won''': [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress|Best Actress &ndash;
