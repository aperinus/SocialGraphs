Smith]] for the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. It is a two-part [[docudrama]] inspired by real events that took place at the [[Mount Cashel Orphanage]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], one of a number of child sexual abuse scandals in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nThe first film, ''The Boys of St. Vincent'', covers the sexual and physical abuse of a number of orphans by Brothers headed by Brother Peter Lavin ([[Henry Czerny]]). The second film, ''The Boys of St. Vincent: 15 Years Later'', covers the trial of the Brothers and the long-term effects of the abuse 15 years later. \n\nThe miniseries was set to premiere on Canadian television in late 1992, but due to the concurrent trials of four Ontario priests who were being tried for similar cases, a court injunction banned the broadcast in Ontario and Quebec. The ban was later overturned after appeals at federal and provincial courts and the miniseries received a nationwide broadcast in late 1993.\n\n''The Boys of St. Vincent'' received widespread critical acclaim and was included in lists of the Top 10 films of 1994 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]''. It won the grand prize at the [[Banff Television Festival]], as well as a [[Peabody Awards|Peabody Award]] and a [[National Board of Review]] award.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Part One ===\nIn 1975, St. Vincent Orphanage is run by the young [[Brother (Christian)|Brother]] Peter Lavin. Kevin Reevey, a 10-year-old abused child, tries to avoid Lavin's attentions by running away, but he is returned to the orphanage by police. When Lavin tries to embrace and caress him, Kevin resists and protests, \"You're not my mother!\" This causes Lavin to violently react to the boy, and Kevin is severely beaten with the buckle end of the brother's belt. Steven Lunny is another abused boy whose older brother Brian tries to protect him. \n\nFinn, the orphanage's janitor, notices Kevin's injuries and worriedly sends him to a hospital. Lavin fires Finn, but Finn hires a detective to investigate the orphanage, and word starts to spread in the local community about possible abuse at St. Vincent. However, an investigation is hampered by an institutional cover-up. Because the orphanage is about to receive a grant from the government that would go towards renovations, the town's police chief wants to avoid the stain of a political scandal. The investigation is ultimately buried by the head of the justice department and church officials, and no arrests are made. Lavin and several Brothers are merely [[Parish transfers of abusive Catholic priests|transferred]]. \n\n=== Part Two ===\nFifteen years later, Lavin has left the priesthood and lives in Montreal with his wife and two sons. A cop comes to his door to arrest him on charges of sexual assault, gross indecency and misconduct, to which Lavin pleads not guilty. The St. Vincent victims, now men in their mid-20s, are called upon to give evidence in the trial. Brian has since happily married and has two children, but has not seen Steven in years; the two brothers reconcile at the trial. Kevin is [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|haunted]] by his abuse and has nightmares. Steven is emotionally destroyed by the defence advocate, who reveals that he abused seven-year-old boys at the orphanage when he was sixteen. Steven then [[Suicide|takes his own life]] with an overdose of drugs. His death ultimately prompts Kevin to give evidence against Lavin. Lavin remains in denial, even to his wife. His fate is left unanswered as is the question, posed by his wife at the end of the second film, as to whether he ever molested his own two young sons.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|* [[Henry Czerny]] as Brother Peter Lavin\n* [[Sebastian Spence]] as Kevin Reevey\n** Johnny Morina as young Kevin\n* Brian Dooley as Detective Noseworthy\n* Philip Dinn as Mike Finn\n* [[David Hewlett]] as Steven Lunny\n** Brian Dodd as young Steven\n* [[Timothy Webber]] as Brian Lunny\n** Ashley Billard as young Brian \n* [[Lise Roy]] as Chantal\n* [[Mary Walsh (actress)|Mary Walsh]] as Lenora Pardy\n* Jeremy Keefe as Mike Sproul\n* Jonathan Lewis as Eddie Linane\n* Michael Wade as Brother MacLaverty\n* Greg Thomey as Brother Glackin\n* Alain Goulem as Brother Glynn\n* [[Aidan Devine]] as Brother Michael Davitt}}\n\n== Production ==\n''The Boys of St. Vincent'' was a co-production between the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], and Montreal\u2019s Les Productions T\u00e9l\u00e9-Action Inc.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Flahive |first=Gerry |date=2019-12-04 |title=Looking back at the CBC's The Boys of St. Vincent |language=en-CA |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-looking-back-at-the-cbcs-the-boys-of-st-vincent/ |access-date=2022-08-02}}</ref>\n\nFor the orphan characters, the production sought out young boys with no prior acting experience to act alongside experienced professionals like Henry Czerny.<ref name=\":0\" /> The miniseries was shot over a period of five months, beginning in November 1991.<ref name=\":0\" /> The filmmakers did extensive preparatory work with the boys and their parents to ensure they \"fully understood the grave nature of the story,\u201d including working with experts in child sexual abuse counseling and a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] who was on set to create a safe, collaborative environment.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Release ==\nThe miniseries was set to air in Canada on December 6, 1992, but the broadcast was blocked two days prior by the [[Ontario Court of Justice]]. The judge reasoned the broadcast could sway public opinion about four members of the Christian Brothers order, who at that time were being tried for actual cases of abuse in the Ontario courts, and thus impede the perpetrators\u2019 right to a fair trial.<ref name=\":0\" /> A day after the ban, the court agreed to hear arguments from lawyers for the CBC and the NFB, which resulted in the court lifting the ban and the broadcast going ahead everywhere in Canada except for Ontario and Quebec. \n\nThough the broadcast had a limited reach, it managed to attract two million viewers.<ref name=\":0\" /> The CBC and NFB partnered with Kids Help Phone, a hotline that was available for viewers to speak to a counsellor. Set up because of the \u201cdearth of services for adult male survivors of abuse,\u201d the hotline ended up fielding more than 300 calls.<ref name=\":0\" /> The miniseries was eventually broadcast to all of Canada in late 1993, after the trials of the Christian brothers concluded.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[Ivan Fecan]], CBC's then vice-president of arts and entertainment, appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] in late 1992 to overturn the lower courts\u2019 decisions completely.<ref name=\":0\" /> Two years later, the Supreme Court established\u00a0a legal principle that protected free expression in a decision known as [[Dagenais v Canadian Broadcasting Corp|Dagenais vs. Canadian Broadcasting Corp]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Daniel Henry, the CBC\u2019s senior legal counsel at the time, said the court decision \"'changed the equation \u2026 in the years since, it has become established as the bedrock principle on which all publication restrictions are weighed.

[[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"An American TV movie would focus on the courtroom drama, the triumph of delayed justice. [John N.] Smith goes after deeper, harsher truths; for one boy, reliving the experience at the trial proves fatal. And we are forced to look at the monstrous Lavin in a different light.

The film took a cinematic approach to television storytelling that predated the [[Netflix]] revolution by two decades. Twenty-three years before Hollywood\u2019s ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'', it defined in dramatic fashion the deep psychological and institutional roots of abuse, and the power some have to cover up such devastating crimes.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Accolades ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:99%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Nominee\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| {{Abbr|Ref.|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n|1993\n|[[Banff World Media Festival|Banff Television Festival]]\n|Grand Prize\n|''The Boys of St. Vincent''\n|{{won}}\n|<ref name=\":1\" />\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" |1994\n|[[Boston Society of Film Critics Awards 1994|Boston Society of Film Critics Awards]] \n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Actor\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Henry Czerny]]\n|{{nom}}\n|<ref>{{Cite web |last=Carr |first=Jay |date=1994-12-19 |title=Boston critics pick 'Pulp' as top film |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/62043402.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://archive.today/2013.01.31-160916/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/62043402.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current |archive-date=2013-01-31 |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=boston.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 1994|Chicago Film Critics Association Awards]]\n|{{nom}}\n|<ref>{{Cite web |title=Chicago Film Critics Awards 1994 |url=https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/award-edition.php?edition-id=cfca_1994 |access-date=2022-08-01 |website=filmaffinity}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" |[[8th Gemini Awards|Gemini Awards]]\n|Best Dramatic Mini-series\n|[[Sam Grana]], Claudio Luca\n|{{won}}\n| rowspan=\"9\" |<ref>{{Cite web |title=Canadian Film Encyclopedia - The Boys of St. Vincent |url=https://cfe.tiff.net/canadianfilmencyclopedia/content/films/boys-of-st-vincent |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=cfe.tiff.net}}</ref>\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|Henry Czerny\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role\n|[[Lise Roy]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series\n|[[John N.
