It stars [[Chris Elliott]], [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]], [[Jean Smart]], and [[Chevy Chase]] with supporting roles by [[Schuyler Fisk]], [[Pam Grier]], Zena Grey, [[Josh Peck]], [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]], and [[David Paetkau]]. The film premiered on January 29, 2000 and was theatrically released on February 11, 2000. It takes place during the events of a record [[Weather-related cancellation#Snow days|snow day]] in upstate New York, depicting various subplots including a group of kids planning to thwart a snowplow driver in an attempt to get a second snow day. This is the first of two films to star both Josh Peck and Zena Grey, the other being ''[[Max Keeble's Big Move]]'', released the following year.\n\n''Snow Day'' was met with generally negative reviews but was a box office success. The soundtrack single \"[[Another Dumb Blonde]]\" by [[Hoku]] became the biggest chart single of [[Hoku]]'s career. The film was released on home video on October 3, 2000, and re-released on DVD on September 26, 2017.\n\nA musical remake is currently in production for [[Paramount+]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a voice-over describing how snow forms from crystallized water and how a snow day isn't just an event when schools close, but a day of magic. Despite an unusually warm season, a snow storm descends upon [[Syracuse, New York]], leaving the Brandston family's neighborhood covered in blankets of snow. Each member of the Brandston family celebrates the record snow day in events that are narrated by eldest son Hal.\n\nFather Tom, the local weatherman, is involved in a rivalry with Chad, a weatherman from another station. Even though Tom predicted the previous night\u2019s snow storm first, Tom discovers Chad is taking credit for the news. Tom is able to prove Chad is a fraud when he\u2019s unable to answer basic meteorology questions on air, proving he discovered the storm first. Mother Laura is a [[workaholic]], but cannot make it into work as she and youngest son Randy are severely snowed in. Stuck at home with Randy, she eventually takes her mind off work and lets loose with her son in the snow.\n\nDaughter Natalie plans to use the magic of the snow day to take on her archenemy Snowplowman, a local villain who is said to run over kids and [[Snowplow|plow]] the streets so efficiently that there has never been a second snow day in years. With her friends Chet and Wayne, Natalie tricks Snowplowman into thinking Wayne is dead in the street. The diversion works as Snowplowman leaves the plow to investigate, and Natalie sneaks inside the plow. She's attacked by his bird Trudy and ends up kidnapping the violent creature. Snowplowman retaliates by grabbing Wayne. Snowplowman agrees to make a swap with Natalie\u2014Wayne and a second snow day in exchange for the bird. However, when the prisoners are swapped, Snowplowman goes back on his word and continues on his route to plow the snow. Natalie is about to give up when she devises a plan. Later, on Snowplowman's last road of the day, Natalie faces off with him alone. He taunts her, but she reveals an army of kids have united to stop him. The kids tie him to a street sign and commandeer his plow, restoring the snow onto the roads.\n\nMeanwhile, Hal plans to spend the day trying to win over his crush, Claire Bonner, the school\u2019s most popular girl who has just broken up with her loud jock boyfriend Chuck. His friend Lane expresses disbelief at his plan, reasoning to him that love is about finding someone you can stand to be around for more than ten minutes at a time, but she agrees to accompany him on his mission. Hal tries everything from reaching out to Claire live on his dad\u2019s news station and facing off with Chuck in a snowmobile chase. When Hal shows no signs of giving up, Lane gets angry with him and admits she hasn't done what she wants to do for the snow day. When Hal asks what is it, she kisses him and leaves. Hal later meets up with Claire at the school's pool where she kisses him, but Hal realizes that he was wrong and he has stronger feelings for Lane. Claire encourages Hal to go after her. \u00a0\n\nIn search of Lane, Hal is attacked by Chuck. A fight ensues, but Hal is saved when Natalie and friends plow Chuck away into a snow bank with the plow. Hal is impressed with Natalie\u2019s accomplishment of her mission and says he wants to spend the soon-to-be second snow day with her. Hal finds Lane at the local skating rink and apologizes to her. He repeats her line about true love being about finding someone you can stand to be around for ten minutes, and then asks her \"You got ten minutes?\" They kiss and the film ends with the beleaguered school principal arriving home, only to be greeted by a volley of snowballs from kids.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* Zena Grey as Natalie Brandston\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Hal Brandston\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Laura Brandston\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Tom Brandston\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Roger Stubblefield aka Snowplowman\n* [[Josh Peck]] as Wayne Alworth\n* [[Jade Yorker]] as Chet Felker\n* [[Schuyler Fisk]] as Lane Leonard\n* [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]] as Claire Bonner\n* [[Iggy Pop]] as Mr. Zellweger\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Tina\n* [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] as Chad Symmonz\n* [[Damian Young]] as Principal Ken Weaver\n* Connor Matheus as Randy Brandston\n* [[David Paetkau]] as Chuck Wheeler\n* Kea Wong as Paula\n* [[Carly Pope]] as Fawn\n* [[Rozonda Thomas]] as Mona\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Marla\n* Tim Paleniuk as Mailman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn February 1999, it was announced Nick and Paramount would team on ''Snow Day''.<ref name=\"NickParSnow\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1999/film/news/nick-par-pair-again-in-snow-1117491464/|title=Nick, Par pair again in 'Snow'|publisher=Variety|access-date=July 16, 2021}}</ref> The film was filmed in [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin]], as well as [[Edmonton]] and [[Calgary, Alberta]].
