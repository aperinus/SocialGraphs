The film was directed by [[Tommy O'Haver]] for [[Miramax|Miramax Films]] and written by R. Lee Fleming Jr.. The film was released on March 9, 2001, and stars [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Melissa Sagemiller]], [[Sisq\u00f3]], [[Shane West]], [[Colin Hanks]], [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Swoosie Kurtz]], [[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Carmen Electra]] and [[Martin Short]]. The film grossed $19 million against a budget of $22 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter Berke Landers' girlfriend Allison breaks up with him, he tries to win her back by auditioning for the school play, despite having no theatrical talent. Meanwhile, his friends Felix and Dennis try to find him a new girlfriend.\n\nWith the help of Felix's younger sister Kelly, Berke wins a minor role in the play, a modern musical version of Shakespeare's comedy ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' called ''A Midsummer Night's Rockin' Eve'', written and directed by the school's domineering drama teacher, Dr. Desmond Oates ([[Martin Short]]). When one of the leads, the school's star actor Peter Wong, is injured in a freak accident, Berke takes over Wong's role of [[Lysander (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Lysander]]. He gradually improves with continuing assistance from Kelly, unaware of the growing attraction between them.\n\nAt a party thrown by Felix at Berke's house, Kelly kisses Berke, but he insists that a relationship between them could not work as she is Felix's sister. At the same party, Berke and Allison catch her new boyfriend Bentley \"Striker\" Scrumfeld cheating on her with her best friend Maggie. Allison breaks up with Striker.\n\nDuring the intermission on the play's opening night, Allison confides to Berke that she wants to get back together with him. Meanwhile, Striker bribes two of the theater technicians to try and blow Berke off the stage using stage pyrotechnics. Before the play resumes, Felix gives the orchestra sheet music for a love ballad written by Kelly to replace Oates' unpopular tune.\n\nWhen the curtain rises, Kelly sings her song so beautifully that Berke finally realizes he loves her. He abandons his lines from the script and improvises his own verse professing his character's love for Kelly's character [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]]. The audience applauds as Berke and Kelly kiss. Striker protests this change, but unwittingly signals the technicians to set off the explosion, blowing him offstage and into the orchestral section.\n\nDennis kisses Kelly's friend and his dancing partner Basin, who kisses him back, suggesting that they also begin a relationship. Kelly and Berke leave the theater looking forward to their future together.\n\nThe film ends with [[Sisq\u00f3]] and [[Vitamin C (singer)|Vitamin C]] singing and dancing along with the cast to the song \"[[September (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|September]]\" as the credits roll.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Ben Foster (actor)|Ben Foster]] as Berke Landers\n* [[Kirsten Dunst]] as Kelly Woods\n* [[Melissa Sagemiller]] as Allison McAllister\n* [[Sisq\u00f3]] as Dennis Wallace\n* [[Shane West]] as Bentley \"Striker\" Scrumfeld \n* [[Colin Hanks]] as Felix Woods\n* [[Zoe Salda\u00f1a|Zoe Saldana]] as Maggie (credited as Zo\u00eb Saldana)\n* [[Mila Kunis]] as Basin\n* [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Beverly Landers\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Frank Landers\n* [[Martin Short]] as Dr. Desmond Forrest Oates\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as Mistress Moira\n* Jeanie Calleja as Jessica\n* [[Christopher Jacot]] as Peter Wong\n* [[Kylie Bax]] as Dora Lynn\n* [[Dov Tiefenbach]] as Little Steve\n* [[Vitamin C (singer)|Vitamin C]] as Herself\n* [[Coolio]] as Himself\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Get Over It'' was filmed in [[Ontario]], Canada.
