For his performance, Jack Palance won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by [[Lowell Ganz]] and [[Babaloo Mandel]], and it was shot in [[New York City]]; [[New Mexico]]; [[Durango, Colorado]]; and [[Spain]]. A sequel ''[[City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold]]'' was released in 1994, with the same cast, with the exception of Kirby, who was replaced by [[Jon Lovitz]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[Pamplona]], Spain, middle-aged friends Mitch Robbins, Ed Furrilo, and Phil Berquist, participate in the [[San Ferm\u00edn festival|running of the bulls]]. Back home in [[New York City]], Mitch realizes he and his pals use adventure trips as escapism from their mundane lives. \n\nMitch hates his radio advertising sales job. Phil is trapped in a loveless marriage to a shrewish wife while managing his father-in-law's supermarket (who also bullies Phil). Ed is a successful sporting goods salesman who recently married a much younger woman but, unwilling to fully settle down, resists starting a family.\n\nAt Mitch's 39th birthday party, Phil and Ed give Mitch a trip for all three to go on a two-week [[cattle drive]] from [[New Mexico]] to [[Colorado]]. Phil's 20-year-old employee unexpectedly arrives at the party and announces she is pregnant with his baby, causing Phil's wife, Arlene, to walk out. Mitch's wife, Barbara, insists he go on the cattle drive to soul search for a new purpose in his life. \n\nIn New Mexico, the trio meet ranch owner, Clay Stone, and their fellow cattle drivers: entrepreneurial brothers Barry and Ira Shalowitz, young and attractive Bonnie, and father-son dentists, Ben and Steve Jessup. Mitch confronts ranch hands, Jeff and T.R., when they begin sexually harassing Bonnie. Trail boss Curly intervenes, though he inadvertently humiliates Mitch.\n\nDuring the drive, Mitch accidentally causes a stampede which destroys the camp. While searching for stray cows, Mitch discovers Curly has a kind nature beneath his gruff exterior. Curly encourages Mitch to discover the \"one thing\" in his life that is most important to him. Along the way, Mitch helps deliver a calf from a dying cow. Mitch names the calf Norman.\n\nShortly after, Curly suffers a fatal [[heart attack]], leaving the drive under Jeff and T.R.'s control. Camp cook, Cookie, gets drunk and accidentally destroys the food supply, breaking his leg in the process. \n\nAfter the Jessups leave to take Cookie to a nearby town, Jeff and T.R. become intoxicated. A fight ensues when they threaten to kill Norman and assault Mitch. Phil and Ed intervene, and Phil holds Jeff at gunpoint, which unleashes his pent-up emotions. Soon after, Jeff and T.R. abandon the group. Bonnie and the Shalowitzes continue on to the Colorado ranch, while Ed and Phil remain behind to finish the drive. Mitch also leaves but soon returns to rejoin his friends.\n\nAfter braving a heavy storm, they drive the herd to Colorado. When Norman nearly drowns as the herd crosses a river, Mitch acts to save him. Both are swept down current, but Phil and Ed rescue them. They safely reach the Colorado ranch. When Stone offers to reimburse everyone's fee, the Jessups prefer going on a future cattle drive. However, Clay reveals that he is selling the herd to a meat packing company. Mitch, Phil, and Ed initially believe they saved the cattle for nothing, but decide to use their experience to help re-evaluate their lives.\n\nThe men return to New York City. Mitch, a happier man, reunites with Barbara and their two children; he has also brought Norman home as a pet. Phil learned that his employee was never pregnant, and he and Bonnie are in a relationship. Ed intends to start a family with his wife. Mitch is ready to restart his life with a new vision.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Mitch Robbins\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Phil Berquist\n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Ed Furillo\n* [[Patricia Wettig]] as Barbara Robbins\n* [[Helen Slater]] as Bonnie Rayburn\n* [[Jack Palance]] as Curly Washburn\n* [[Noble Willingham]] as Clay Stone\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Cookie\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Lou\n* [[Josh Mostel]] as Barry Shalowitz\n* [[David Paymer]] as Ira Shalowitz\n* [[Bill Henderson (performer)|Bill Henderson]] as Dr. Ben Jessup\n* [[Phill Lewis]] as Dr. Steve Jessup\n* [[Kyle Secor]] as Jeff\n* Dean Hallo as T.R.\n* [[Karla Tamburrelli]] as Arlene Berquist\n* [[Yeardley Smith]] as Nancy\n* [[Robert Costanzo]] as Sal Morelli\n* Walker Brandt as Kim Furillo\n* [[Molly McClure]] as Millie Stone\n* Jane Alden as Mrs. Green\n* Lindsay Crystal as Holly Robbins\n* [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Danny Robbins \n* [[Danielle Harris]] as Classroom Student\n* Eddie Palmer as Classroom Student\n* Howard Honig as Skycap Guy\n* Fred Maio as Doctor\n* [[Jayne Meadows]] as The Voice of Mitch's Mother\n* Alan Charof as The Voice of Mitch's Father\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's plot, which consists of inexperienced cowboys battling villains as they press on with their cattle drive after the death of their leader, was conceived to be similar to [[John Wayne]]'s ''[[The Cowboys]]'', although that was a Western drama as opposed to a comedy.<ref>[http://www.moviefone.com/movie/the-cowboys/29887/similar The Cowboys - Similar Movies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820044805/http://www.moviefone.com/movie/the-cowboys/29887/similar |date=August 20, 2010 }} at MovieFone.

Later that night, Palance placed the Oscar on Crystal's shoulder and said, \"Billy Crystal ... who thought it would be you?\" Crystal added in his book, \"We had a glass of champagne together, and I could only imagine what Charles Bronson was thinking as he went to sleep that night.\" The next year's Oscars opened with Palance appearing to drag in a giant Academy Award, with Crystal (again the host) riding on the opposite end.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
