The film stars [[Jackie Chan]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], [[Claire Forlani]], and [[Julian Sands]]. It was much less successful than Chan's other American films such as the [[Rush Hour (film series)|''Rush Hour'' film series]], ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Shanghai Knights]]''. The film was theatrically released on 15 August 2003 in Hong Kong and 22 August 2003 in the United States by [[TriStar Pictures]].\n\nIn the story, Eddie (Chan) is a Hong Kong police officer hired by [[Interpol]] to capture a crime lord known as Snakehead (Sands) and prevent him from kidnapping a chosen boy with special powers and a medallion that gives superhuman power and immortality.\n\nMuch of the film features supernatural and mystical themes, though it is filled with action and comedy. The film received negative reviews from critics.  Even though the film's United States box office result was strong enough for Sony/TriStar Pictures to make profit,<ref name=\"money\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/box-office/slashers-stash-1117891354/|title = Slashers' stash|website=Variety.com|date = 24 August 2003}}</ref> the film only grossed $34 million in worldwide box office against $41&nbsp;million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nEddie Yang is a [[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] inspector co-operating with [[Interpol]] in the capture of a crime lord named AJ \"Snakehead\" Staul. Snakehead procures an ancient book from a Chinese bookstore keeper, which tells the story of a boy being chosen every thousand years to bind the two halves of a legendary medallion. In Hong Kong, Eddie and Interpol agent Arthur Watson lead a raid to capture Snakehead and his men, who are about to kidnap the boy, named Jai. Eddie and the agents fight off Snakehead's men, infiltrating the temple containing Jai. The agents save Jai, but Snakehead eludes them. Two weeks later, Snakehead captures Jai aboard a cargo boat in Hong Kong. Eddie and a team of Hong Kong police engage and defeat several of Snakehead's men, but Snakehead escapes with Jai to [[Dublin]], Ireland.\n\nIn Ireland, Eddie is assigned to help Interpol with the investigation, much to Watson's annoyance. Eddie also reunites with his girlfriend, a British Interpol agent named Nicole James. By chance, Eddie later encounters and apprehends one of Snakehead's top men, who confesses Jai is being held in the harbor. Eddie, Watson, and Nicole move to rescue Jai, defeating several Snakehead agents in the process. Eddie and Jai end up trapped inside a container, which is knocked into the water by one of Snakehead's men before they can be released. Eddie keeps Jai alive by finding an inflatable tent, and securely putting Jai inside, but Eddie dies from drowning. After being rescued, Jai uses his medallion on Eddie's body.\n\nIn the morgue, Watson grieves over Eddie's body and prepares to say his last words, when Eddie suddenly appears beside him. Eddie realizes Jai used the medallion to resurrect him, and his former body vanishes into dust. Jai splits the medallion into its two-halves, giving one of them to Eddie. Snakehead's men appear in the hospital to recapture Jai, and during the fight, Eddie discovers the medallion has also granted him superhuman strength and immortality.\n\nNicole looks after Jai, but he is captured again by Snakehead. At his castle hideout, Snakehead forces Jai to activate the medallion so he can gain its power, but with only one half of it, Snakehead only gains superhuman strength and remains mortal. To steal the other half, Snakehead and his men attack Watson's family. Watson's Chinese wife reveals herself to be a police operative like him, much to Watson's surprise as he kept his job secret from his family. Together they fight off the attack from Snakehead's men.\n\nEddie, Watson, and Nicole learn the location of Snakehead's castle lair and go to finish him once and for all. The operation runs smoothly at first, but Snakehead kills Nicole and becomes immortal. He and Eddie engage in a vicious fight until Eddie uses the medallion to take away the life it gave, which leads to the serpent and fish from the medallion appearing and taking Snakehead, which traps him in the medallion. Jai allows Eddie to use the medallion to resurrect Nicole, who also gains super-strength and immortality. The two then run at superhuman speed into the distance as Jai enters another dimension through a portal, frightening Watson.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as Inspector Eddie Yang \n* [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] as Interpol Inspector Arthur Watson \n* [[Claire Forlani]] as Inspector Nicole James \n* Alex Bao as Jai\n* [[Julian Sands]] as Snakehead/AJ Staul \n* Johann Myers as Giscard\n* [[John Rhys-Davies]] as Commander Hammerstock-Smythe \n* [[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]] as Lester Wong (Snakehead's assistant)\n* [[Christy Chung]] as Charlotte Watson \n* Billy Hill as Miles Watson\n* [[Nicholas Tse]] as waiter at the restaurant (cameo) \n* [[Edison Chen]] as waiter at the restaurant (cameo)\n\n===Snakehead's henchmen===\n* [[Scott Adkins]] \n* [[Bruce Khan]]\n* [[Han Guan Hua]]\n* [[Paul Andreovski]]\n* [[Nicola Berwick]]\n* [[Reuben Langdon]] (as Reuben Christopher Langdon)\n* [[Hiro Hayama]] (as Hiroyoshi Komuro)\n* [[Mark Strange]] (as Michael Strange)\n* [[Matt Routledge]] (as Matthew James Routledge)\n* [[Chris Torres]] (uncredited)\n* [[Brad Allan]] (uncredited)\n* [[Jude Poyer]] (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n{{Anchor|Production|Development}}\nWith a projected budget of $35 million the film was at the time the most expensive Hong Kong production ever.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/news/chan-yeoh-return-to-teach-preach-1117860202/|title = Chan, Yeoh return to teach & preach|website=Variety.com|date = 6 February 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/markets-festivals/emg-s-chan-sees-no-borders-in-future-pix-1117867156/|title = EMG's Chan sees no borders in future pix|website=Variety.com|date = 18 May 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"irishtimes\">{{cite web |date=8 September 2001|title=Wacky Jackie |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/wacky-jackie-1.326515 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190808141813/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/wacky-jackie-1.326515 | archive-date= 8 August 2019 |website=[[The Irish Times]] }}</ref>\n\n===Original plot and conception===\n''Highbinders'' was the film's working title. In the original plot, those who were given power by the medallion became Highbinders, and Snakehead's goal was to create a Highbinder army at his disposal.\n\nAccording to the editors' commentary, ''The Medallion'' wasn't American-made. However, Columbia-TriStar bought the distribution and editing rights worldwide except in Japan, France, and Hong Kong (but these three countries retain the American cut of the film, the only cut ever made). The original cut was meant to be around 108 minutes. The plot of the film explained Snakehead's crime syndicate of [[People smuggling|human smuggling]], the deaths that occurred from it, and his desire to create an army of Highbinders to aid his organization. These details were all cut to focus on the medallion. As a result of several scene cuts, some original dialogue was overdubbed, including a small amount of [[Cantonese]] dialogue.\n\nOver 20 minutes of these [[deleted scene]]s can be viewed on the U.S. DVD. Among these scenes are [[alternate ending]]s where Eddie prevents Nicole's death, an extended fight sequence between Eddie and Snakehead's men, and an alternate ending to the chase sequence between Eddie and Giscard.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in August 2001 in Dublin, Ireland. Production took a break while Jackie Chan shot '[[The Tuxedo]]', and production resumed in Asia later that year.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jackie Chan's 'Highbinders' Starts Principal Photography | date = 2 August 2001 | website = [[IFTN]] | url = http://www.iftn.ie/news/ProductionNews/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=2136&tpl=archnews&force=1 }}</ref><ref name=\"irishtimes\" /> Filming took place in [[Dublin Castle]], and in the Wicklow countryside.<ref>{{cite web | title = 'Highbinders' Is First Big Budget Asian Shoot In Ireland | date = 27 August 2001 | website = [[IFTN]] | url = http://www.iftn.ie/news/ProductionNews/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=3140&tpl=archnews&force=1 }}</ref> The filmmakers had initially planned to shoot scenes in Australia but were convinced to film in Dublin instead.<ref name=\"irishtimes\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its US release, ''The Medallion'' was No. 5 at the box office on its opening weekend and fell steadily lower during its 10-week release.
