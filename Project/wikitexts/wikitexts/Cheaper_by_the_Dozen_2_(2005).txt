It is a sequel to the 2003 film ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' and stars [[Steve Martin]], [[Bonnie Hunt]], [[Tom Welling]], [[Piper Perabo]], and [[Hilary Duff]], among other child actors reprising their roles as members of the 12-child Baker family, alongside [[Eugene Levy]] and [[Carmen Electra]] as new characters. It tells the story of the Baker family as they go on a vacation and contend with a rival family.\n\nThe film was released on December 21, 2005 in the United States. It received negative reviews from critics and grossed $135 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nTwo years after Tom Baker resigned from his head coaching position, his family begins to undergo many changes, beginning with Lorraine's high school graduation and internship with [[Allure (magazine)|Allure Magazine]] in [[New York City]]. Nora is now married to Bud McNulty and pregnant with their first child with the intent to move to [[Houston, Texas]] because of Bud's new job.\n\nFeeling the family is breaking apart as the children grow up and move away, Tom persuades them to take one last family vacation all together at Lake Winnetka, a fictional lake in [[Wisconsin]]. The family finds that their old cabin is currently owned by a man named Mike Romanow. Tom's old rival, Jimmy Murtaugh, his new wife Sarina, and his eight kids Calvin, Anne, Daniel, Becky, Elliot, Lisa, Robin and Kenny are also staying at the lake for the summer; Jimmy is also friends and neighbors with Mike. Jimmy constantly flaunts his wealth and success to Tom, as well as the accomplishments of his children, often suggesting to Tom that his are less successful because of his parenting style. They get into many incidents, several of which are accidental: Mark accidentally sets off a backpack of fireworks, causing widespread panic, especially when it is thrown into a boat, igniting its engine and causing it to explode, he and Kenny crash into a tennis court with a golf cart, and Sarah is caught shoplifting from a gift shop.\n\nJimmy again brings up the topic that Tom needs to be more strict with his kids. Tom is angered by this, and he and Jimmy decide to settle the matter at the Annual [[Labor Day]] Family Cup. Tom trains the kids for days, not realizing they are miserable. Sarah and Elliot go to the movies to see ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', but are spied on by their fathers, which ultimately results in them getting into an altercation and humiliating their children. Upon returning to the Bakers\u2019 cabin, Sarah is furious and refuses to compete for Tom in the Cup. The other children are also angry with him, not only for spying on Sarah, but also for ruining the entire trip because of his competitiveness with the Murtaughs. Kate laments that his and Jimmy\u2019s conflicting parenting styles have torn the two families even further apart.\n\nThe next morning, Tom goes to the Cup to compete with Kyle and Nigel, the only two still willing to go. However, after discovering an old \"Team Baker\" flag, Kate and the rest of the kids show up, forgiving Tom and willing to compete again. After the events, however, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are tied for first; a tiebreaking canoe race is announced, in which every family member must compete. During the canoe race, Nora goes into labor; the Murtaughs want to help, but Jimmy, sensing the opportunity to defeat Tom once and for all, refuses to do so. The Murtaugh children jump out of the canoe to help the Bakers. While arguing with Sarina, Jimmy reveals that he was jealous of Tom being the popular one when they were younger. Eventually, Sarina convinces him to help and the two families work together to get Nora to the hospital. Bud, Lorraine, and Kate go with Nora in the delivery room, while Tom, Jimmy, Sarina, and the rest of the kids stay in the waiting room.\n\nWhile talking with Jimmy, Tom realizes that he has to let his kids grow, but wherever they go, they will always be together as a family. Nora then gives birth to a baby boy whom she and Bud name after his grandfather, who has shown them that \"there is no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one.\"\n\nBud announces that he and Nora have bought the cabin back at the lake. Nora, Bud, and baby Tom leave for Houston a few days later, and the family enjoy the rest of their vacation.\n\n==Cast==\n===Bakers===\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Tom Baker, the patriarch of the Baker family and former football coach.\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Kate Baker, the matriarch of the Baker family and Tom's wife.\n* [[Piper Perabo]] as Nora Baker-McNulty, Tom & Kate's 1st daughter and Bud's wife (the mother of Tom).\n* [[Tom Welling]] as Charlie Baker, Tom & Kate's 1st son who becomes a mechanic in order to pay off some college tuition.\n* [[Hilary Duff]] as Lorraine Baker, Tom & Kate's 2nd daughter who is planning to move to New York so that she can intern at [[Allure (magazine)|Allure Magazine]].\n* [[Kevin Schmidt|Kevin G.

Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (2005 film)|Yours, Mine, and Ours]]''.\" Ebert also highly praised [[Alyson Stoner]]'s performance, favorably comparing the then-twelve year old actress to [[Reese Witherspoon]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Cheaper by the Dozen 2 Movie Review (2005)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cheaper-by-the-dozen-2-2005 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=8 August 2017 |date=20 December 2005}}</ref>\n\nCalling the overall film \"bland\", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s Justin Chang agreed with Ebert on Stoner, calling her \"an endearingly vulnerable standout\" and deeming her subplot to be \"the most engaging\" in it.
