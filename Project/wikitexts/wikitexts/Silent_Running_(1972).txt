It is the directorial debut of [[Douglas Trumbull]], and stars [[Bruce Dern]], [[Cliff Potts]], [[Ron Rifkin]], and [[Jesse Vint]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the future, all plant life on Earth is becoming extinct. As many specimens as possible have been preserved in a series of enormous greenhouse-like [[geodesic dome]]s, attached to large spaceships, one of which is named ''Valley Forge'', forming part of a fleet of [[American Airlines]] space freighters, currently just outside the orbit of [[Saturn]].\n\nFreeman Lowell, one of four crewmen aboard, is the resident botanist and ecologist who carefully maintains a variety of plants for their eventual return to Earth and the [[reforestation]] of the planet. Lowell spends most of his time in the domes, both cultivating the crops and attending to the animal life.\n\nThe crew of each ship receives orders to jettison and destroy their domes and return the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six ''Valley Forge'' domes are jettisoned and blown up, Lowell rebels and opts instead to save the plants and animals on his ship. Lowell kills one of his crewmates, John, who arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the destruction of the other remaining dome, trapping and killing the remaining two crewmen.\n\nEnlisting the aid of the ship's three [[service robot]]s, Lowell stages a fake premature explosion as a ruse and sends the ''Valley Forge'' careening toward Saturn in an attempt to hijack the ship and flee with the last forest dome. He then reprograms the drones to perform surgery on his leg and sets the ''Valley Forge'' on a risky course through [[Rings of Saturn|Saturn's rings]]. Later, as the ship endures the rough passage, Drone 3 is lost, but the ship and its remaining dome emerge relatively undamaged on the other side of the rings. Lowell gives the surviving drones the names Dewey (Drone 1) and Huey (Drone 2), while the lost Drone 3 is named Louie (a nod to Disney characters [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]).\n\nLowell, Huey, and Dewey set out into deep space to maintain the forest. Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. He also has them bury John in the bio-dome. Lowell begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children.\n\nHuey is damaged when Lowell accidentally collides with him while driving a buggy recklessly, and Dewey sentimentally refuses to leave Huey's side during the repairs. As time passes, Lowell is horrified when he discovers that his bio-dome is dying, but is unable to come up with a solution to the problem. When the ''Berkshire'' \u2014 another space freighter waiting to see if the ''Valley Forge'' has survived the trip around Saturn \u2014 eventually reestablishes contact, he knows that his crimes will soon be discovered. It is then that he realizes a lack of light has restricted plant growth, and he races to install lamps to correct this situation. In an effort to save the last forest before the ''Berkshire'' arrives, Lowell jettisons the bio-dome to safety. He then detonates nuclear charges, destroying the ''Valley Forge'', the damaged Huey, and himself in the process. The final scene is of the now well-lit forest greenhouse drifting into deep space, with Dewey tenderly caring for it, holding Lowell's battered old watering can.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Making of Silent Running Drone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|During a shooting break, [[Amputation|double-amputee]] actor Mark Persons is visible inside the tiny ''Drone 1 (Dewey)'' costume with its cover plate removed.]]\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Freeman Lowell\n* [[Cliff Potts]] as John Keenan\n* [[Ron Rifkin]] as Marty Barker\n* [[Jesse Vint]] as Andy Wolf\n* Mark Persons as Drone 1 (Dewey)\n* Cheryl Sparks and Steven Brown as Drone 2 (Huey)\n* Larry Whisenhunt as Drone 3 (Louie)\n\n==Production==\nTrumbull had been involved with creating effects for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] had wanted the Stargate sequence of that film to be about [[Saturn]], but technical difficulties prevented completion of the sequence's special effects within the limited time available. The Saturn idea was scrapped, and Kubrick substituted [[Jupiter]] instead. Trumbull developed the sequence after production, and it was recreated for Saturn in ''Silent Running''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe interiors were filmed aboard the decommissioned [[Korean War]] aircraft carrier [[USS Valley Forge (CV-45)|USS ''Valley Forge'' (LPH-8)]], which was docked at the [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard]] in [[Long Beach, California]]. Shortly after filming was completed, the carrier was scrapped. The forest environments were originally intended to be filmed in the [[Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory|Mitchell Park Domes]] in [[Milwaukee]], but the production budget forced the sequences to be shot in a newly completed aircraft hangar in [[Van Nuys, California]]. Trumbull stated in the commentary accompanying the DVD release that the geodesic domes containing the last forests of Earth's future on the ''Valley Forge'' were based on the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]'s [[Climatron]] dome.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThree freighters are shown in the film: the ''Valley Forge'', the ''[[Berkshires|Berkshire]]'' and the ''[[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]]''. Five other ships that carried domes \u2013 the ''[[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Acadia National Park|Acadia]], [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]], [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier]],'' and ''[[Mojave Desert|Mojave]]'' \u2014 are also mentioned. Each ship features a designation on the hull that notes the area from which some of its [[flora]] and [[fauna]] samples were taken. The ''Valley Forge'' is listed as \"[[Bahia Honda Key|Bahia Honda]] Subtropical,\" indicating at least some specimens were taken from this area of the [[Florida Keys]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe model of the ''Valley Forge'' was {{convert|25|ft}} long, and took six months to build from a combination of custom castings and the contents of approximately 800 prefabricated model-aircraft or tank kits. After filming was completed, [[American Airlines]] expressed an interest in sending the model on the tour circuit, but this was not feasible due to the model's fragile nature (in fact, during filming, pieces of the model frequently detached). The ship was subsequently disassembled after several years sitting in Trumbull's personal storage facility. Several pieces, including the domes, wound up in the hands of collectors. Several domes survive, including one that now rests in the [[Museum of Pop Culture#Science Fiction Museum|Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], and another that was sold at auction in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe three drones were played by four bilateral [[Amputation|amputees]],<ref name=\"canby72\" /> an idea inspired by [[Johnny Eck]], a sideshow performer of the early 20th century who had been born without lower limbs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thehumanmarvels.com/johnny-eck-the-half-man/ |title=Johnny Eck - The Half-Man |date=August 7, 2006 |publisher=The Human Marvels \u2013 Circus Freaks and Human Oddities}}</ref> The {{convert|20|lbs|adj=on}} drone suits were custom-tailored for the actors. The suits are in Trumbull's personal collection.\n\nThe sound effects, including the drones, were created by uncredited composer [[Joseph Byrd]].
