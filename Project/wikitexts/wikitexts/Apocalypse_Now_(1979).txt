The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and [[John Milius]] with narration written by [[Michael Herr]], is loosely based on the 1899 novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]], with the setting changed from late 19th-century [[Congo Free State|Congo]] to the [[Vietnam War]]. The film follows a river journey from [[South Vietnam]] into [[Cambodia]] undertaken by Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen), who is on a secret mission to assassinate [[Colonel Kurtz]] (Marlon Brando), a renegade [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] officer accused of murder and who is presumed insane.\n\nMilius became interested in adapting ''Heart of Darkness'' for a Vietnam War setting in the late 1960s, and initially began developing the film with Coppola as producer and [[George Lucas]] as director. After Lucas became unavailable, Coppola took over directorial control, and was influenced by [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972) in his approach to the material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/abc/coppola.html |title=Francis Ford Coppola, Interview with Gerald Peary |last=Peary |first=Gerald |publisher=Gerald Peary |access-date=March 14, 2007 |archive-date=December 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217170611/http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/abc/coppola.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Initially set to be a five-month shoot, a series of problems lengthened it to over a year, as chronicled in the documentary ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'' (1991).

Kurtz]] has apparently gone insane and is waging a brutal [[guerrilla war]] against [[People's Army of Vietnam#Vietnam War|NVA]] and [[People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam|PLAF]] forces without permission from his commanders. At an outpost in [[Cambodia]], he commands American and [[Degar|Montagnard]] troops who see him as a [[demigod]].\n\nBurnt-out [[MACV-SOG]] operative [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to [[I Field Force, Vietnam|I Field Force]] headquarters in [[Nha Trang]]. He is ordered to \"terminate Kurtz's command... with [[Summary execution|extreme prejudice]]\".\n\nAmbivalent, Willard joins a U.S. Navy [[Patrol Boat, River|river patrol boat]] (PBR) commanded by [[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] Phillips, with crewmen Lance, \"Chef\" and \"Mr. Clean\" to quietly navigate up the N\u00f9ng River to Kurtz's outpost. Before reaching the coastal mouth of the N\u00f9ng, they rendezvous with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)#Vietnam War|1st Squadron]], [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]]\u2014a helicopter-borne air assault unit commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore\u2014to discuss safe passage. Kilgore is initially uncooperative as he has not received word about their mission through normal channels, but he becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance is a well-known surfer. The commander is an avid surfer himself and agrees to escort them through the N\u00f9ng's [[Viet Cong]]-held coastal mouth. The helicopter squadron, playing \"[[Ride of the Valkyries]]\" on loudspeakers, raids at dawn with a [[napalm]] strike. Before Kilgore can lure Lance out to surf on the newly conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to the PBR to continue their mission.\n\nTension arises as Willard believes himself in command of the PBR while Chief prioritizes routine patrol objectives over Willard's. Slowly making their way upriver, Willard partially reveals his mission to the Chief to assuage his concerns about why his mission should proceed. As Willard studies Kurtz's dossier, he is struck by the mid-career sacrifice Kurtz made by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join Special Forces, with no prospect of advancing beyond the rank of colonel.\n\nAt a remote U.S. Army outpost, Willard and Lance seek information on what is upriver and receive a dispatch bag containing official and personal mail. Unable to find any commanding officer, Willard orders the Chief to continue. Willard learns via the dispatch that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard's and has since joined Kurtz.{{efn|A few days before Willard received this dispatch, Chief had told him that about six months prior to Willard's mission, he (Chief) had taken another man north of the Do Long Bridge. Chief had heard this man shot himself in the head.}}\n\nLance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting enemy fire, and Mr. Clean is killed. Further upriver, Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard by impaling him on the spear point protruding from his own chest before Willard suffocates him. Willard reveals his mission to Chef, who is now in charge of the PBR.\n\nThe PBR arrives at Kurtz's outpost, an abandoned [[Angkor Empire]] temple compound teeming with Montagnards and strewn with corpses and severed heads. Willard, Chef and Lance are greeted by an American photojournalist, who praises Kurtz's genius. They encounter a near-catatonic Colby. Willard sets out with Lance to find Kurtz, leaving Chef with orders to call in an airstrike on the outpost if the two do not return.\n\nIn the camp, Willard is bound and brought before Kurtz in a darkened temple. Kurtz places Chef\u2019s severed head onto Willard\u2019s lap, preventing the airstrike. Willard is released and Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, praising the ruthlessness of the Viet Cong. Kurtz discusses his family and asks that Willard tell his son about him after his death.\n\nThat night, as the Montagnards ceremonially slaughter a [[water buffalo]], Willard attacks Kurtz with a machete. Mortally wounded, Kurtz utters \"...{{nbsp}}The horror ... the horror {{nbsp}}...\" and dies. All in the compound see Willard departing, carrying a collection of Kurtz's writings, and bow down to him. Willard and Lance sail away.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{About||a list of the rest of the cast members not included in the 153-minute version of the film that was released in theaters|Apocalypse Now Redux#Cast}}\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Colonel Kurtz|Colonel Walter Kurtz]], a highly decorated [[United States Army Special Forces]] officer with the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th Special Forces Group]] who goes rogue.

The [[novella]], based on Conrad's experience as a steamboat captain in Africa, is set in the [[Congo Free State]] during the 19th century.<ref>Murfin, Ross C (ed.) (1989): ''Joseph Conrad: Heart of Darkness. A Case Study in Contemporary Criticism''. Boston: St. Martin's Press, pp. 3\u201316.</ref> Kurtz and Marlow (whose corresponding character in the movie is Capt. Willard) work for a Belgian trading company that brutally exploits its native African workers.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nAfter arriving at Kurtz's outpost, Marlow concludes that Kurtz has gone insane and is lording over a small tribe as a god. The novella ends with Kurtz dying on the trip back and the narrator musing about the darkness of the human psyche: \"the heart of an immense darkness\".{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nIn the novella, Marlow is the pilot of a river boat sent to collect ivory from Kurtz's outpost, only gradually becoming infatuated with Kurtz. In fact, when he discovers Kurtz in terrible health, Marlow makes an effort to bring him home safely. In the film, Willard is an assassin dispatched to kill Kurtz. Nevertheless, the depiction of Kurtz as a god-like leader of a tribe of natives and his malarial fever, Kurtz's written exclamation \"Exterminate all the brutes!\" (which appears in the film as \"Drop the bomb. Exterminate them all!\") and his last words \"The horror! The horror!\" are taken from Conrad's novella.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nCoppola argues that many episodes in the film\u2014the spear and arrow attack on the boat, for example\u2014respect the spirit of the novella and in particular its critique of the concepts of civilization and progress. Other episodes adapted by Coppola, the Playboy Playmates' (Sirens) exit, the lost souls, \"take me home\" attempting to reach the boat and Kurtz's tribe of (white-faced) natives parting the canoes (gates of Hell) for Willard, (with Chef and Lance) to enter the camp are likened to Virgil and \"The Inferno\" (''[[Divine Comedy]]'') by [[Dante]]. While Coppola replaced European [[colonialism]] with American [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]], the message of Conrad's book is still clear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberpat.com/essays/coppola.html |title=Heart of Darkness & Apocalypse Now: A comparative analysis of novella and film |publisher=Cyberpat.com |access-date=March 6, 2010 |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103190217/http://www.cyberpat.com/essays/coppola.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt is often speculated that Coppola's interpretation of the [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]] character was modeled after [[Tony Poe]], a highly decorated Vietnam-era paramilitary officer from the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]].<ref>Leary, William L. \"Death of a Legend\". Air America Archive.

These rumors came from Coppola departing frequently from the original screenplay. Coppola admitted that he had no ending because Brando was too fat to play the scenes as written in the original script{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. With the help of Dennis Jakob, Coppola decided the ending could be \"the classic myth of the murderer who gets up the river, kills the king, and then himself becomes the king&nbsp;\u2013 it's the [[Fisher King]], from ''The Golden Bough''\".{{Sfn|Cowie|1990|p=125}} Principal photography ended on May 21, 1977,{{Sfn|Cowie|1990|p=126}} after 238 days.<ref name=AFI/>\n\n=== Post-production and audio ===\nThe budget had doubled to over $25 million, and Coppola's loan from United Artists to fund the overruns had been extended to over $10 million.<ref name=var/> UA took out a $15 million life insurance policy on Coppola.{{Sfn|Biskind|1998|p=361}} By June 1977, Coppola had offered his car, house, and ''The Godfather'' profits as security to finish the film.{{r|Harmetz}}<ref name=var/> When ''Star Wars'' became a gigantic hit, Coppola sent a telegram to [[George Lucas]] asking for money.{{Sfn|Biskind|1998|p=336-337, 343}} The release date was pushed back to spring 1978.<ref name=var/>\n\nJapanese composer [[Isao Tomita]] was signed to provide an original score, with Coppola desiring the film's soundtrack to sound like Tomita's [[electronic music|electronic]] adaptation of ''[[The Planets]]'' by [[Gustav Holst]].

The sound material brought back from the Philippines was inadequate because the small location crew lacked the time and resources to record jungle sounds and ambient noises. Murch and his crew fabricated the mood of the jungle on the soundtrack. ''Apocalypse Now'' used novel sound techniques for a movie, as Murch insisted on recording the most up-to-date gunfire and employed the [[Dolby Stereo 70&nbsp;mm Six Track]] system for the 70&nbsp;mm release, which used two channels of sound behind the audience as well as three channels from behind the movie screen.{{Sfn|Cowie|1990|p=127}} The 35&nbsp;mm release used the new [[Dolby Stereo]] optical stereo system, but due to limitations of the technology at the time, the 35&nbsp;mm release that played in most theaters did not include surround sound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eric Dienstfrey |title=The Myth of the Speakers: A Critical Reexamination of Dolby History |journal=Film History |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=167\u2013193 |publisher=Film HIstory: An International Journal |jstor=10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.06|year=2016 |doi=10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.06 |s2cid=192940527 }}</ref> In May 1978, Coppola postponed the opening until spring of 1979.{{Sfn|Cowie|1990|p=128}} The cost overruns had reached $18 million, for which Coppola was personally liable, but he had retained rights to the picture in [[perpetuity]].<ref name=varrev/>\n\n===Controversies===\nA [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] was slaughtered with a machete for the climactic scene in a ritual performed by a local [[Ifugao]] tribe, which Coppola had previously witnessed with his wife Eleanor (who filmed the ritual later shown in the documentary ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse|Hearts of Darkness]]'') and film crew.

Coppola said the original ending was written in haste, where Kurtz convinced Willard to join him and together they repelled the air strike on the compound. Coppola said he never fully agreed with Kurtz and Willard dying in fatalistic explosive intensity, preferring to end the film in a more positive way.\n\nWhen Coppola originally organized the ending, he considered two significant versions. One had Willard leading Lance by the hand as everyone in Kurtz's base threw down their weapons; Willard then piloted the PBR slowly away from Kurtz's compound, and this final shot was superimposed over the face of a stone idol, which then faded to black. The other version had the base spectacularly blown to bits in an air strike, killing everyone left within it.\n\nThe original 1979 {{nowrap|70mm}} exclusive theatrical release ended with Willard's boat, the stone statue, and the fade to black with no credits, save for '\"Copyright 1979 Omni Zoetrope\"' at its very end. This mirrored the lack of opening titles and supposedly stemmed from Coppola's original intention to \"tour\" the film as one would a play: The credits appeared on printed programs provided before the screening began.{{Sfn|Cowie|1990|p=132}}\n\nThere have been, to date, many variations of the end credit sequence, beginning with the 35&nbsp;mm general release, where Coppola elected to show the credits superimposed over shots of the jungle exploding into flames.{{Sfn|Cowie|1990|p=132}}<ref name=AFI/> The explosions were from the detonations of the sets.<ref name=AFI/> Rental prints circulated with this ending, and can be found in the hands of a few collectors. Some versions had the subtitle \"A United Artists release\", while others had \"An Omni Zoetrope release\". The network television version of the credits ended with \"...{{nbsp}}from MGM/UA Entertainment Company\" (as it made its network debut shortly after the merger of [[MGM]] and UA). Another variation of the end credits can be seen on both YouTube and as a supplement on the current [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment|Lionsgate]] Blu-ray.\n\nWhen Coppola later heard that the audiences interpreted this as an air strike called by Willard, he pulled the film from its {{nowrap|35 mm}} run and added credits on a black screen.<ref name=AFI/> The \"air strike\" footage continued to circulate in repertory theaters well into the 1980s, and was included in the 1980s LaserDisc release. In the DVD commentary, Coppola explains that the images of explosions were not intended as part of the story, but were simply a graphic background he had added for the credits.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Destruction of the Kurtz Compound w/ commentary by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]|work=[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]|medium=DVD|trans-title=DVD Extras|date=November 20, 2001}}</ref>\n\nCoppola explained he had shot the explosion footage during demolition of the sets, whose destruction and removal were required by the Philippine government. He filmed the demolition with cameras fitted with different film stocks and lenses to capture the explosions at different speeds.

This is an extended version that restores 49 minutes of scenes cut from the original film. Coppola has continued to circulate the original version as well: the two versions are packaged together in the ''Complete Dossier'' DVD, released on August 15, 2006, and in the Blu-ray edition released on October 19, 2010.\n\nThe longest section of added footage in the ''Redux'' version is the \"French Plantation\" sequence, a chapter involving the de Marais family's rubber plantation, a holdover from the colonization of [[French Indochina]], featuring Coppola's two sons [[Gian-Carlo Coppola|Gian-Carlo]] and [[Roman Coppola|Roman]] as children of the family. Around the dinner table, a young French child recites a poem by [[Charles Baudelaire]] entitled ''[[L'albatros (poem)|L'albatros]]''. The French family patriarch is not satisfied with the child's recitation. The child is sent away. These scenes were removed from the 1979 cut, which premiered at [[Festival de Cannes|Cannes]]. In behind-the-scenes footage in ''Hearts of Darkness'', Coppola expresses his anger, on the set, at the technical limitations of the scenes, the result of shortage of money. At the time of the ''Redux'' version, it was possible to digitally enhance the footage to accomplish Coppola's vision. In the scenes, the French family patriarchs argue about the positive side of colonialism in Indochina and denounce the betrayal of the military men in the [[First Indochina War]]. Hubert de Marais argues that French politicians sacrificed entire battalions at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], and tells Willard that the US created the Viet Cong (as the [[Viet Minh]]) to fend off Japanese invaders.\n\nOther added material includes extra combat footage before Willard meets Kilgore, a scene in which Willard's team steals Kilgore's surfboard (which sheds some light on the hunt for the mangoes), a follow-up scene to the dance of the ''Playboy'' Playmates, in which Willard's team finds the Playmates stranded after their helicopter has run out of fuel (trading two barrels of fuel for two hours with the Bunnies), and a scene of Kurtz reading from a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article about the war, surrounded by Cambodian children.\n\nA deleted scene titled \"Monkey Sampan\" shows Willard and the PBR crew suspiciously eyeing an approaching [[sampan]] juxtaposed to Montagnard villagers joyfully singing \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]]. As the sampan gets closer, Willard realizes there are monkeys on it and no helmsman. Finally, just as the two boats pass, the wind turns the sail and exposes a naked dead [[Viet Cong]] (VC) nailed to the sail boom. His body is mutilated and looks as though the man had been [[flogged]] and [[castrated]]. The singing stops. As they pass on by, Chief notes out loud, \"That's comin' from where we goin', Captain.\" The boat then slowly passes the giant tail of a shot down [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] as the noise of engines high in the sky is heard. Coppola said that he made up for cutting this scene by having the PBR pass under an aircraft tail in the final cut.\n\n==='' First Assembly'' ===\nA 289-minute ''First Assembly'' circulates as a video bootleg, containing extra material not included in either the original theatrical release or the \"redux\" version.<ref name=\"Coates\">{{cite news |last=Coates |first=Gordon |title=Coppola's slow boat on the Nung |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 17, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/17/1 |access-date=October 17, 2008 |location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018214153/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/17/1|archive-date=October 18, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> This cut of the film does not feature Carmine Coppola's score, instead using several Doors tracks.<ref name=\"Cinephilia & Beyond 2015\">{{cite web |title=The Holy Grail of Workprints: The Five-Hour Rough Version of 'Apocalypse Now' |website=Cinephilia & Beyond |date=2015-10-12 |url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/the-holy-grail-of-workprints-the-five-hour-rough-version-of-apocalypse-now/ |access-date=2021-12-09}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Apocalypse Now Final Cut'' ===\nIn April 2019, Coppola showed ''Apocalypse Now Final Cut'' for the 40th anniversary screening at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Gordon |title=Tribeca: Danny Boyle's Beatles Movie 'Yesterday' Set as Closing Night Film |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/beatles-movie-yesterday-say-anything-apocalypse-now-set-tribeca-2019-1194756 |access-date=April 24, 2019 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 14, 2019 |archive-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114040633/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/beatles-movie-yesterday-say-anything-apocalypse-now-set-tribeca-2019-1194756 |url-status=live }}</ref> This new version is Coppola's preferred version of the film and has a runtime of three hours and three minutes, with Coppola having cut 20 minutes of the added material from ''Redux''; the scenes deleted include the second encounter with the Playmates, parts of the plantation sequence, and Kurtz's reading of ''Time'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=442569 |title=Apocalypse Now Comparison: Final Cut \u2013 Redux Version |website=Movie Censorship |date=September 15, 2019 |access-date=January 9, 2020 |archive-date=April 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200412221437/https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=442569 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is also the first time the film has been restored from the original camera negative at 4K; previous transfers were made from an [[interpositive]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Falt |first1=Chris |title='Apocalypse Now': 5 Things You Need to Know About Coppola's New 'Final Cut' |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/apocalypse-now-final-cut-5-things-to-know-francis-for-coppola-new-version-1202129340/ |website=IndieWire |date=April 29, 2019 |access-date=April 30, 2019 |archive-date=April 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430004130/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/apocalypse-now-final-cut-5-things-to-know-francis-for-coppola-new-version-1202129340/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It was released in autumn 2019, along with an extended cut of ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fleming |first1=Mike Jr. |title=Francis Ford Coppola: How Winning Cannes 40 Years Ago Saved 'Apocalypse Now,' Making 'Megalopolis,' Why Scorsese Almost Helmed 'Godfather Part II' & Re-Cutting Three Past Films |url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/francis-ford-coppola-apocalypse-now-cannes-40-anniversary-megalopolis-scorsese-godfather-part-ii-re-cutting-godfather-iii-cotton-club-interview-1202613659/ |date=May 13, 2019 |website=Deadline |access-date=May 18, 2019 |archive-date=May 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516131543/https://deadline.com/2019/05/francis-ford-coppola-apocalypse-now-cannes-40-anniversary-megalopolis-scorsese-godfather-part-ii-re-cutting-godfather-iii-cotton-club-interview-1202613659/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It also had a release in select [[IMAX]] theaters on August 15 and 18, 2019, in a collaboration between IMAX and [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/apocalypse-now-final-cut-imax-theaters/ |title=Restored 'Apocalypse Now Final Cut' Coming to IMAX Theaters for the 40th Anniversary |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=July 25, 2019 |access-date=August 6, 2019 |archive-date=August 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806155437/http://collider.com/apocalypse-now-final-cut-imax-theaters/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Home media ==\n\nApocalypse Now was released as a mono audio two-tape set on [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] in 1981.

The first [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] appearance, on [[Laserdisc]] on December 29, 1991, cropped the film to a 2:1 aspect ratio (conforming to the [[Univisium]] spec created by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro), and included a small degree of pan-and-scan processing at the insistence of Coppola and Storaro. The end credits, from a videotape source rather than a film print, were still crushed for 1.33:1 and zoomed to fit the anamorphic video frame. All DVD releases have maintained this aspect ratio in anamorphic widescreen, but present the film without the end credits, which were treated as a separate feature. The Blu-ray releases of ''Apocalypse Now'' restore the film to a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, making it the first home video release to display the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio.\n\nAs a DVD extra, the footage of the explosion of the Kurtz compound was featured without text credits but included commentary by Coppola, explaining the various endings based on how the film was screened.\n\nOn the cover of the ''Redux'' DVD, Willard is erroneously listed as \"Lieutenant Willard\".\n\nLionsgate released a 6-disc 40th anniversary edition on August 27, 2019. It includes two [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] discs and four standard Blu-ray discs, containing the theatrical version, ''Redux'', and the ''Final Cut'' featuring 4K restorations from the original camera negative. Previous extras (including the ''Hearts of Darkness'' documentary) have been re-used for this release, along with brand new content including a Tribeca Film Festival Q&A with Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Soderbergh and never-before-seen B-roll footage.<ref>{{cite web|date=29 April 2019|title=Apocalypse Now 40th Anniversary 4K Blu-ray|url=https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=25025|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501003449/https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=25025|archive-date=May 1, 2019|access-date=29 October 2020|website=Blu-ray.com}}</ref>\n\n== Documentaries ==\n''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'' (American Zoetrope/Cineplex Odeon Films) (1991) Directed by Eleanor Coppola, [[George Hickenlooper]], and Fax Bahr\n\n''Apocalypse Now \u2013 The Complete Dossier'' DVD ([[Paramount Home Entertainment]]) (2006).
