But back at work in [[London]], Tala encounters Leyla, a young [[British Indian]] Muslim woman who is dating Tala's best friend Ali. Tala sees something unique in the artless, clumsy, sensitive Leyla who secretly works to become a writer. And Tala's forthright challenges to Leyla's beliefs begins a journey of self-awareness for Leyla. After a weekend getaway into the countryside, Tala and Leyla sleep together and the two women begin to fall in love. However, Tala's own sense of duty and cultural restraint cause her to pull away from Leyla and fly back to Jordan where the preparations for an ostentatious wedding are well under way.\n\nAs family members descend and the wedding day approaches, the pressure mounts until Tala finally cracks and extricates herself. Back in London, Leyla is heartbroken but learns to break free of her own self-doubt and her mother's expectations, ditching Ali and being honest with her parents about her sexuality. When Ali and Leyla's feisty sister, Yasmin, help try to get Tala and Leyla together again, Tala finds that her own preconceptions of what love can be is the final hurdle she must jump to win Leyla back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lisa Ray]] as Tala\n* [[Sheetal Sheth]] as Leyla\n* Antonia Frering as Reema - Tala's mother\n* [[Dalip Tahil]] as Omar - Tala's father\n* Ernest Ignatius as Sam - Leyla's father\n* Siddiqua Akhtar as Maya - Leyla's mother\n* [[Amber Rose Revah]] as Yasmin - Leyla's sister\n* [[Anya Lahiri]] as Lamia - Tala's middle sister\n* [[Kimberly Jaraj]] as Zina - Tala's younger sister\n* Rez Kempton as Ali - Tala's best friend, Leyla's boyfriend\n* [[Daud Shah (actor)|Daud Shah]] as Hani - Tala's fianc\u00e9\n* Sam Vincenti as Kareem - Lamia's husband\n* Ishwar Maharaj as Sami - Kareem's younger brother\n* George Tardios as Uncle Ramzi\n* [[Nina Wadia]] as Rani the Housekeeper\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"another weightless confection from the writer and director Shamim Sarif.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Catsoulis|title=Love Beyond Boundaries|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/movies/21thin.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 November 2008|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Autostraddle]] said that it \"stands out for its cultural specificity, truly stunning leads, and endless charm.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/new-and-revised-the-103-best-lesbian-movies-of-all-time-368953/?all=1|title=Now, An Updated Edition Of The 102 Best Lesbian Movies Of All Time|date=2017-02-14|work=Autostraddle|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n\n[[AfterEllen.com and TheBacklot.com|AfterEllen]]'s review notes, \"While the film has a lot going for it, the script is surprisingly paint-by-the-numbers.
