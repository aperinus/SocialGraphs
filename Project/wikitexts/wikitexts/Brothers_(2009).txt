Maguire, however, received particular praise for his performance, receiving a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn October 2007, [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] Sam Cahill is about to embark on his fourth [[Operation Enduring Freedom|combat deployment]] to [[Afghanistan]]. He is married to his high school sweetheart Grace, and together they raise two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie. Sam's brother Tommy is a convicted [[felon]] who is released from prison on [[parole]] a few days before Sam gets deployed. At a family dinner with Tommy and Sam's parents Hank and Elsie, Maggie reveals to Tommy that Grace dislikes him, and Hank insults Tommy for his lack of success compared to Sam.\n\nDuring Sam's tour, his [[Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk|Blackhawk]] helicopter is shot down in [[Helmand Province]]. Sam and private Joe Willis are the sole survivors and are taken [[prisoner of war|prisoner]] by [[Taliban]] fighters. Sam and Joe are declared [[killed in action]] by the U.S. government. At Sam's funeral, Hank attempts to drive Elsie and the girls home while drunk, but Tommy stops him. Hank again berates Tommy; and Tommy blames Hank for influencing Sam to join the Marines because of his own [[Vietnam War]] service.\n\nTommy attempts to redeem himself and completes a kitchen remodel for Grace. Hank and Tommy also mend their relationship, and Grace bonds with Tommy, aided by his growing paternal connection with Isabelle and Maggie. Grace and Tommy share a fireside kiss, but do not take their attraction any further. However, Tommy continues to remain close with the family and his nieces grow attached to him. Meanwhile, Sam and Joe are [[torture]]d by their captors and Sam is eventually forced to beat Joe to death.\n\nSometime later, Sam is rescued by American forces and returns home. However, he struggles to readjust, showing signs of severe [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]; his daughters grow fearful and resentful toward him. Sam also lies to Joe's widow about her husband's death. His [[paranoia]] also causes him to believe Grace and Tommy fell in love while he was gone, causing him to remain aloof. During Maggie's birthday, an indignant Isabelle falsely claims that Tommy and Grace are having an affair and wishes Sam was actually dead. Returning home, Sam becomes enraged, destroying the kitchen with a [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] and aims a [[pistol]] at Tommy, who tries to calm his brother's violent [[Mental disorder|breakdown]].\n\nThe police arrive and enter a standoff with Sam, who fires the gun into the air before holding it to his own head, contemplating [[suicide]]. He reluctantly surrenders after several pleas from Tommy and Grace. He is arrested and admitted to a [[Department of Veterans' Affairs]] [[mental hospital]]. Grace visits, giving him an [[ultimatum]] that if he doesn't tell her what happened, he'll forever lose her. Sam finally opens up, confiding in her that he killed Joe; and they embrace. In narration, he wonders if he will ever live a normal life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as Capt.
