After enjoying financial success at the box office, ''From Dusk till Dawn'' has since become a [[cult film]]<ref>[http://www.joe.ie/movies/cult-classics/cult-classic-from-dusk-till-dawn-0026808-1 Cult Classic: From Dusk Till Dawn, by  Emmet Purcell] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209150141/http://www.joe.ie/movies/cult-classics/cult-classic-from-dusk-till-dawn-0026808-1 |date=February 9, 2013}} JOE.ie</ref> and spawned a [[From Dusk till Dawn (franchise)|media franchise]] of sequel films, a video game and other media adaptations.\n\n==Plot==\nFugitive bank robber brothers [[Seth Gecko|Seth]] and Richie Gecko hold up a liquor store, killing clerk Pete Bottoms and [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Earl McGraw in a shootout. They inadvertently destroy the building as they leave. At an inn room where they are hiding out, Seth returns from getting food to find Richie has raped and murdered a bank clerk they had taken hostage, much to his anger.\n\nJacob Fuller, a pastor experiencing a crisis of faith brought on by the death of his wife, is on vacation with his teenage children Scott and Kate in their RV. They stop at the inn and are kidnapped by the Gecko brothers, who force the Fuller family to smuggle them over the [[Mexican border]]. In Mexico, they arrive at the Titty Twister, a [[strip club]] in the desert, where the Gecko brothers will be met by their contact, Carlos, at dawn. Carlos will escort them to the sanctuary at \"[[The Getaway (novel)#Escape|El Rey]]\", a place of safety for fugitives from justice whose admission fee is 30 percent of everything they have. When Richie complains to Seth that this is too high, Seth tells him it is non-negotiable.\n\nDuring a bar fight, the bar employees reveal themselves as [[vampire]]s and kill most of the patrons. Richie is bitten by a stripper, Santanico Pandemonium, and dies, but Seth manages to kill her by shooting at a chandelier above her that impales her. Only Seth, Jacob, Kate, Scott, a biker named Sex Machine, and Frost\u2014a [[Vietnam War veteran]]\u2014survive. The others are reborn as vampires, including Richie, forcing the survivors to kill them all. When an army of vampires, in bat form, assembles outside, the survivors lock themselves inside, but Sex Machine is bitten, becomes a vampire, and bites Frost and Jacob. Frost throws Sex Machine through the door, allowing the vampires to enter while Frost turns into a vampire.\n\nSeth, Kate, and Scott escape to a storeroom, followed shortly by an injured but still alive Jacob, brandishing a [[shotgun]]. In the storeroom, they fashion weapons from truck cargo the vampires have looted from past victims, including a stake mounted on a [[Drill|pneumatic drill]], a [[crossbow]], and [[holy water]], which requires Jacob to recover his faith to bless. Jacob, knowing he will soon become a vampire, makes Scott and Kate promise to kill him when he changes.\n\nThe group makes their final assault on the undead. Sex Machine mutates into a large rat-like creature and attacks Seth, but is killed. Jacob becomes a vampire but Scott hesitates to kill him, allowing Jacob to bite him. Scott hits Jacob with holy water and shoots him. Scott is overwhelmed by vampires, who begin to devour him; he begs for death and Kate shoots and kills him. As vampires surround Kate and Seth, streams of morning light enter through bullet holes in the building, making the vampires back away. Carlos arrives and his bodyguards blast open the door, letting in the sunlight which kills the vampires.\n\nSeth chastises Carlos for his poor choice of meeting place and negotiates a smaller tribute for his admission to El Rey. Kate asks Seth if she wants her to go with him to El Rey, but he refuses, apparently concerned for her safety, leaving her with some cash. Kate drives away in the RV, leaving the Titty Twister behind, which is revealed to be the top of an eight-level partially buried [[Aztec]] [[Teocalli|temple]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of From Dusk till Dawn characters}}\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] as Jacob Fuller\n* [[George Clooney]] as [[Seth Gecko]]\n*[[Quentin Tarantino]] as Richard 'Richie' Gecko\n*[[Juliette Lewis]] as Katherine 'Kate' Fuller\n*Ernest Liu as Scott Fuller\n*[[Salma Hayek]] as Santanico Pandemonium\n*Brenda Hillhouse as Hostage Gloria Hill\n*[[Marc Lawrence]] as Old Timer Motel Owner\n*[[Cheech Marin]] as Border Guard / Chet Pussy / Carlos\n*[[Michael Parks]] as Texas Ranger Earl McGraw\n*[[Kelly Preston]] as Newscaster Kelly Houge\n*[[Tom Savini]] as Sex Machine\n*[[John Saxon]] as FBI Agent Stanley Chase\n*[[Danny Trejo]] as Razor Charlie\n*[[Fred Williamson]] as Frost\n*[[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Pete Bottoms\n*[[Tito & Tarantula]] as The Titty Twister House Band\nSpecial make-up effects creator [[Greg Nicotero]] appears as Sex Machine's buddy.\n\n==Development==\n''From Dusk till Dawn'' was conceived by [[Robert Kurtzman]], who hired Tarantino to write the script as his first paid writing assignment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://backwoodshorror.com/robert-kurtzman-interview/|title=ROBERT KURTZMAN INTERVIEW|publisher=backwoodshorror.com|access-date=July 16, 2016|archive-date=August 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820110935/http://backwoodshorror.com/robert-kurtzman-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scaretissue.com/from-dusk-till-dawn-the-oft-forgotten-90s-classic/|title=From Dusk Till Dawn \u2013 The Oft Forgotten 90s Classic|date=January 7, 2014|language=en-US|access-date=July 16, 2016|archive-date=August 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819073437/http://www.scaretissue.com/from-dusk-till-dawn-the-oft-forgotten-90s-classic/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Universal Pictures]] originally considered Tarantino's screenplay for ''From Dusk till Dawn'' as the follow-up to ''[[Demon Knight]]'' and the second in a proposed ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' film trilogy, but ultimately produced another vampire film, ''[[Bordello of Blood]]'', instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/747363-review-tales-crypt-flicks-demon-knight-bordello-blood-blu-ray/amp |title=SHOCK takes a critical look at a double-dose of TALES FROM THE CRYPT features on Blu-ray |date=October 8, 2015 |publisher=ComingSoon |access-date=February 19, 2020 |archive-date=July 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701083540/http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/747363-review-tales-crypt-flicks-demon-knight-bordello-blood-blu-ray/amp |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===References to other titles===\nThe \"El Rey\" hideout in Mexico was borrowed from ''[[The Getaway (novel)|The Getaway]]'', a 1958 crime novel by [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]].\n\nEarl McGraw became a recurring character in Rodriguez and Tarantino's works, later appearing in ''[[Kill Bill]]'', ''[[Planet Terror]]'' and ''[[Death Proof]]'', appearing as an Easter Egg.
