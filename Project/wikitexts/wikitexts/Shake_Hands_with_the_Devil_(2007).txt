Based on Dallaire's autobiographical book ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (book)|Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda]]'', the film recounts Dallaire's harrowing personal journey during the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]] and how the [[United Nations]] failed to heed Dallaire's urgent pleas for further assistance to halt the massacre.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nThe film received 12 nominations at the [[28th Genie Awards]] and tied with the film ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' for most nominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/arts/story.html?id=270335 |title=Violent mobsters, Alzheimer's and genocide: It's Canadian cinema! |access-date=2008-01-30 |author=Maria Kubacki |date=2008-01-29 |work=[[National Post]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSN2952650820080130?sp=true |title=\"Promises,\" \"Devil\" each nab 12 Genie nominations |access-date=2008-01-30 |author=Etan Vlessing |date=2008-01-29 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>\n\n==Film production and planned release==\n[[Image:Set of \"Shake Hands with the Devil\" (Kigali, July 2006).jpg|left|thumb|''Shake Hands'' being filmed in Kigali, July 2006]]\nA co-production of [[Barna-Alper Productions]], of [[Toronto]], and [[Halifax Film Company]], of [[Nova Scotia]], the movie was directed by [[Roger Spottiswoode]] (''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[And the Band Played On (film)|And the Band Played On]]'') and filmed in part on location in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]], from mid-June to early August 2006 before returning to [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] for its \"final shoot\".<ref>[http://thechronicleherald.ca/Entertainment/521321.html \"Extras Needed for Dallaire Movie in Halifax\"], ''[[Chronicle Herald]]'' August 13, 2006.

Dallaire is collaborating on this project \u2013 right down to a line-by-line review of the script \u2013 and insisted on giving Dupuis the decorations to add authenticity.  He also gave Dupuis something of himself. \"I feel a real connection with this man. He opened up to me\", Dupuis says during an interview on the set, the first time he has spoken with media since the gruelling shoot began in Rwanda a month ago.  \"I'm here because of him.\"  (\"One Last Dance with the Devil\")</blockquote>\n\nIn \"New Rwanda Genocide Movie Criticizes U.N. Role\", first posted on [[Reuters]] on August 9, 2006, Arthur Asiimwe quotes from his interview in [[Kigali]] with the film's director [[Roger Spottiswoode]]:\n<blockquote>\"Our film is about a man who was aware [[genocide]] was coming and tried to get the [[U.N.]] to allow him to do something about it, but ... instead it turned him down ...  It is really about the bigger issue of what the U.N. role is in situations like these\", he told [[Reuters]] at the capital's [[Amahoro stadium]], which sheltered thousands of terrified residents in 1994 as the killers roamed the streets outside.<br /><br />\nSpottiswoode said the film was particularly timely given the calls on the [[United Nations]] to intervene to end the war in Lebanon, and the ongoing efforts to send a U.N. force to stop rampant murders and rapes in [[Sudan]]'s troubled [[Darfur]] region.  The [[United States]] has called the [[Darfur conflict]] genocide.<ref>Qtd. by Arthur Asiimwe, [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L09856859.htm \"New Rwanda Genocide Movie Criticizes U.N.
