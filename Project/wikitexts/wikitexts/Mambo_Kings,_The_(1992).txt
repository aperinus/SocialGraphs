The film was directed and produced by [[Arne Glimcher]], and stars [[Armand Assante]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Cathy Moriarty]] and [[Maruschka Detmers]]. Set in the early 1950s, the story follows Cesar (Assante) and Nestor Castillo (Banderas), brothers and aspiring musicians who find success and stardom after fleeing from [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] to [[New York City]] to escape danger. The film marks Glimcher's directing debut, and features Banderas in his first English-language role.\n\nGlimcher acquired the [[film rights]] one year before the novel was published, and hired [[Cynthia Cidre]] to write the script. The film was rejected by several studios, and after an unsuccessful [[pre-production]] at [[Universal Pictures]], the project moved to [[Warner Bros.]] The production was allocated a budget of $15.5 million jointly financed by Warner Bros., [[StudioCanal|Le Studio Canal+]] and [[Regency Enterprises]]. The film was shot on location in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], with principal photography beginning in March 1991, and concluding after 50 days.\n\n''The Mambo Kings'' premiered at the [[Miami International Film Festival]] on February 7, 1992. It opened in [[limited release]] on February 28, 1992, and grossed $6.7 million during its North American theatrical run. Critical reaction was mostly positive, with reviewers praising Glimcher's direction, the story, music and visuals. The film received [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], [[Golden Globe Award]] and Grammy nominations for its original song \"[[Beautiful Maria of My Soul]]\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1950s, Cuban brothers and musicians Cesar and Nestor Castillo flee from Havana, Cuba after getting into a violent dispute with the mobster owners of a club where they performed. Eventually ending up in [[New York City]], the brothers work at menial jobs while attempting to revive their musical careers. At a nightclub where Cesar briefly crashes the act of mambo star [[Tito Puente]], they make new friends and connections, as well as meeting cigarette girl Lanna Lake, who falls quickly into a love affair with Cesar.\n\nNestor, in the meantime, remains oblivious to other women while continually composing his ode to his lost Cuban love, Maria. He writes version after version of the same ballad, \"[[Beautiful Maria of My Soul]]\", until by chance one day he encounters Delores, a shy but attentive young woman who wishes to become a schoolteacher. When she becomes pregnant, they decide to get married.\n\nFate intervenes one night at a club, where the Castillo brothers have a part-time job. Nestor's love ballad captures the interest of one of the customers, who turns out to be the Cuban bandleader and American television star [[Desi Arnaz]]. After a pleasant evening in Nestor and Delores's home, Arnaz invites the struggling Castillos to sing and act on an episode of his sitcom series, ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.\n\nFame does not last, however. Nestor is not as ambitious as his brother and desires nothing more than to own his own small club. He is in love with Delores, but lacks the passion he felt for his beloved Maria back home. Cesar suppresses his true feelings, believing that a woman like Delores would actually be perfect for him. He reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor. One snowy night, the Castillo brothers' car veers off the road and into a tree. Cesar, in the back seat of the vehicle, is barely hurt, but Nestor, who was driving the vehicle, is killed. To honor his brother's memory, a devastated Cesar opens his own small club. Delores pays him a visit and asks him to sing \"Beautiful Maria of My Soul\".\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Cesar Castillo\n* [[Antonio Banderas]] as Nestor Castillo\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Lanna Lake\n* [[Maruschka Detmers]] as Delores Fuentes\n* [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]] as [[Desi Arnaz|Desi Arnaz, Sr.]]\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Fernando Perez\n* [[Talisa Soto]] as Maria Rivera\n* [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as Miguel Montoya\n* Cordelia Gonzales as Anna Maria\n* [[Tito Puente]] as Himself\n* [[Helena Carroll]] as Mrs. Shannon\n* [[Celia Cruz]] as Evalina Montoya\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Arne Glimcher]], an art dealer based in New York City and a fan of [[Mambo (music)|mambo music]], learned that his longtime friend [[Oscar Hijuelos]] was writing a novel relating to the latter subject.
