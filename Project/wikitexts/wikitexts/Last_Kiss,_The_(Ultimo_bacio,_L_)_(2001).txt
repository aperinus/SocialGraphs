Terrified at his imminent entry into the adult world of irreversible responsibilities, Carlo finds himself tempted by a bewitching 18-year-old girl, Francesca ([[Martina Stella]]), whom he meets by chance at a wedding. The possibility of one last youthful crazy fling before the impending prison of parenthood proves to be too attractive to resist.\n\nBut a short-term fling with Francesca comes with serious consequences that threaten to damage his three-year relationship with Giulia, who is expecting a baby girl. At the same time, it also dashes the idealistic hopes of Francesca, who dreams of a beautiful future with him. After a raucous quarrel in the night, Carlo goes to Francesca's house, where they have sex. However, the morning after, reality sinks on Carlo and the enormity of what he had done surfaces. But it is not easy for Giulia to forgive, or to trust him again.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Giovanna Mezzogiorno]]: Giulia\n* [[Stefano Accorsi]]: Carlo  \n* [[Stefania Sandrelli]]: Anna\n* [[Martina Stella]]: Francesca\n* [[Pierfrancesco Favino]]: Marco\n* [[Claudio Santamaria]]: Paolo\n* [[Sabrina Impacciatore]]: Livia\n* [[Giorgio Pasotti]]: Adriano\n* [[Sergio Castellitto]]: Prof. Eugenio Bonetti\n* [[Regina Orioli]]: Arianna\n* [[Marco Cocci]]: Alberto\n* [[Luigi Diberti]]: Emilio\n* [[Daniela Piazza]]: Veronica\n* [[Lina Bernardi]]: Adele \n* [[Piero Natoli]]: Michele\n* [[Vittorio Amandola]]: Mimmo \n* [[Giulia Carmignani]]: Mariposa\n* [[Silvio Muccino]]: fiancee of Mariposa\n* [[Carmen Consoli]]: lover of Alberto\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed $12 million in Italy and $17.8 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=11 June 2001|page=7|title=Italy toasts local share of market|first=David|last=Rooney|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/italy-toasts-local-share-of-market-1117801286/|access-date=22 April 2021}}</ref><ref name=mojo/>\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|The Last Kiss}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0265930|title=The Last Kiss}}\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Gabriele Muccino}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Last Kiss}}\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:2001 romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gabriele Muccino]]\n[[Category:Italian romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian films]]\n\n\n{{2000s-Italy-film-stub}}\n{{2000s-comedy-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
