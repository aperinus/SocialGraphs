It presents a day in the lives of store clerks [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Dante Hicks|Dante Hicks]] (O'Halloran) and [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Randal Graves|Randal Graves]] (Anderson) as well as their acquaintances. It is the first of Smith's [[View Askewniverse]] films, and introduces several recurring characters, notably [[Jay and Silent Bob]] (Mewes and Smith respectively).\n\n''Clerks'' was shot for $27,575 in the convenience and video stores where director Smith worked in real life. Upon its theatrical release, it received generally positive reviews and grossed over $4&nbsp;million in theaters, launching Smith's career. In 2006, a [[Clerks II|sequel]] was released. Additionally, a [[Clerks III|third installment]] was released in 2022.\n\nIt is often regarded as a [[Cult film|cult classic]] and a landmark in independent filmmaking. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cult classic films |url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls004064136/ |access-date=2022-06-29 |website=IMDb |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/purple-rain-amadeus-boys-dont-cry-clerks-enter-national-film-registry-1261469 |title='Purple Rain,' 'Amadeus,' 'Boys Don't Cry,' 'Clerks' Enter National Film Registry |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=December 11, 2019 |language=en |access-date=December 11, 2019 |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308071416/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/purple-rain-amadeus-boys-dont-cry-clerks-enter-national-film-registry-1261469 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nDante Hicks, a young man who works as a retail clerk at Quick Stop Groceries in [[Leonardo, New Jersey]], is called into work on his day off to cover another employee's morning shift. Arriving at the store, he finds that the locks to the security shutters are jammed closed with gum, so he hangs a sheet over them with \"I ASSURE YOU; WE'RE OPEN!\" written in shoe polish. Soon after opening, Dante's best friend, wisecracking slacker Randal Graves, arrives for his own workday at the next door video rental store, RST Video.\n\nThe two prepare for another ordinary day immersed in their tedious customer service jobs. Dante repeatedly laments that he is \"not even supposed to be here today,\" while Randal neglects his job at the video store to keep Dante company at the Quick Stop. They pass the time engaging in philosophical discussions on a wide variety of topics, including movies, sex, relationships, and difficult customers. Some of the customers they encounter during the day are angry and demanding, others clueless and impolite, still others prove unexpectedly wise. After several hours, Dante discovers that his boss, who was supposed to arrive at 12 so Dante could leave, has left on a trip to [[Vermont]], leaving him to run the store alone for the rest of the day. Dante and Randal find a number of reasons to leave the store and slack off, from a rooftop hockey game with their friends to crashing an ill-fated [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] for Julie Dwyer, one of Dante's ex-lovers.\n\nThroughout the film, Dante is torn between Veronica Loughran, his current girlfriend, and Caitlin Bree, his ex-girlfriend with whom he still secretly communicates despite being engaged. Dante is distressed when he learns Veronica has given [[oral sex]] to 36 other men before him, and engaged in [[Snowballing (sexual practice)|snowballing]] with at least one, namely Willam Black. Despite Veronica's doting on him, Dante chooses to rekindle his relationship with Caitlin. However, Caitlin is traumatized by an incident in the Quick Stop bathroom; in the dark, she had sex with a person that she thought was Dante, but who was actually an old customer who had died of a [[heart attack]] while [[Masturbation|masturbating]] to a pornographic magazine Dante provided him earlier. Caitlin leaves catatonic in an ambulance.\n\n[[Jay and Silent Bob]], a pair of drug dealers who spend their time loitering outside the store, invite Dante to party with them after hours, but Dante declines, considering the various seedy characters the two usually attract. Aware of Dante's problems, Silent Bob tersely convinces him that he really loves Veronica, but Randal has already confessed the previous events to her, prompting a furious Veronica to dramatically dump Dante. Dante then finally loses his temper and fights Randal, trashing the Quick Stop.\n\nDante and Randal have a crucial moment of clarity after their fight. Dante repeats his refrain that he's \"not even supposed to be here today\" and an enraged Randal, fed up with Dante's self-pitying, explodes at Dante, explaining that he (Dante, not Randal) closed the store several times to slack off. He then says that Dante came to work on his own free will and therefore could have left at any time, preventing the day's events. Furthermore, he says they are not as \"advanced\" over the customers as they think they are, or else they would not be stuck in such lowly jobs, leaving Dante speechless.\n\nAfter the two make amends and clean the store, Dante plans to visit Caitlin in the hospital, try to reconcile with Veronica, and possibly get some direction in his life. Randal leaves, but not before tossing Dante's shoe-polish sign in his face and declaring, \"You're closed!\"<ref>Kevin Smith. ''Clerks and Chasing Amy: Two Screenplays''.

He was only allowed to film in the store at night while it was closed (from 10:30&nbsp;pm to 5:30&nbsp;am), hence the plot point of the [[window shutter|shutters]] being closed due to a vandal having jammed gum in the padlocks. Because Smith was working at Quick Stop during the day and shooting the film at night, he frequently slept no more than an hour a day. By the end of the 21-day shoot, Smith was unable to stay awake while Dante and Randal's fight was shot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peterbroderick.com/writing/writing/learningfromlowbudgets.html |title=Learning From Low-Budgets |author=Peter Broderick |work=Filmmaker Magazine |date=January 21, 2017 |access-date=January 22, 2017 |archive-date=January 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129024446/http://peterbroderick.com/writing/writing/learningfromlowbudgets.html |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSeveral members of Smith's family played roles in the film due to budget constraints. When Dante is discussing the \"Milk Maids\", the shopper shown is Smith's mother, Grace, and the customer whose job is to \"manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination\" is played by Smith's sister, Virginia. Several of Smith's friends also play roles in the film. One of them, [[Walt Flanagan]], who, in addition to creating the character of Silent Bob's Russian cousin Olaf, was present often during filming either to provide extra help or just to give moral support, plays four roles in this film: The \"Woolen Cap Smoker\" in the beginning (which he reprises at the end of [[Clerks II]]), the \"Egg Man\" (which he also reprises in [[Clerks III]]), the \"Offended Customer\" (during the \"jizz mopper\" scene) and the \"Cat Admiring Bitter Customer\", as well as the final RST Video customer in a deleted scene. Smith never intended for Flanagan to play this many roles, but had to as the actors he got to play them just did not show up, and would often, in jest, refer to Flanagan as \"the [[Lon Chaney]] of the '90s\". Smith originally wrote the part of Dante for another one of his friends, [[Ernest O'Donnell]], before replacing him with local stage actor [[Brian O'Halloran]]. However, O'Donnell appeared in the film as minor character Rick Derris. Smith also originally wrote the part of Randal for himself, which is why he gave Randal all the best lines, according to the 1999 DVD commentary. However, Smith found that writing, directing, working at the store, and playing one of the lead roles all at the same time was too hard and he kept forgetting his lines so he gave the part to another one of his friends, [[Jeff Anderson]], while Smith took on the less-demanding role of Silent Bob.\n\nThe [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] originally gave the film an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|NC-17 rating]], based purely on the film's explicit dialogue, as it contains no real violence aside from Dante and Randal's fight near the end, no sex, and no clearly depicted nudity. This would have serious financial implications for the film, as very few cinemas in the United States screen NC-17 films. Miramax hired civil liberties lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] to appeal the decision and the MPAA relented and re-rated the film with the more commercially viable \"R\" rating, without any alterations.<ref name=vainfo />\n\n=== The lost scene ===\nThe events of Julie Dwyer's wake were written by Smith but were not filmed due to the prohibitive cost of producing the scene.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4h-UbzIGK0 |title=Clerks 'Lost Scene' Introduction by Kevin Smith |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=January 14, 2018 |archive-date=June 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629192440/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4h-UbzIGK0 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2004, the scene was produced in colored animation using the same style of ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'', featured O'Halloran and Anderson reprising their roles and [[Joey Lauren Adams]] in a cameo as her character [[Alyssa Jones]], who'd later appear in further [[View Askewniverse]] films, for the tenth anniversary DVD release. The \"lost scene\" was also presented in comic-book form of the ''Clerks'' [[comic book]] series, with the title of \"[[Clerks. (comics)#Clerks.

After Randal leaves, Dante proceeds to count out the register and does not notice another person entering the store. Upon Dante's informing the latecomer that the store is no longer open, the customer shoots Dante, killing him. Afterward, the killer makes off with all the money from the cash register. The sequence ends with Dante's dead face looking off past the camera; after the credits roll \u2013 the soundtrack over it being a cash register making noises \u2013 a customer (played by Smith with his beard shaved off) wearing glasses and in a ponytail and a baseball jersey comes into the store, sees no one around,  (as Dante is lying dead behind the counter) steals a pack of cigarettes, and runs off.<ref name=snowballdoc>{{cite AV media |people=Phil Benson (director), Kevin Smith |date=September 7, 2004 |title=Snowball Effect: The Story of 'Clerks' |medium=motion picture |language=en |publisher=View Askew Productions}}</ref>\n\nThe depressing ending was criticized by Bob Hawk and [[John Pierson (filmmaker)|John Pierson]] after its first screening at the Independent Feature Film Market, and under Pierson's advice, Smith cut the ending short, ending with Randal's departure and deleting Dante's death. Fans have since analyzed the death of Dante as an homage to the ending of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', which is discussed earlier in the film as Dante's favorite ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie because \"it ended on such a down note\". The film's extended cut also implied that, because Randal disconnected the security camera earlier in the day during the roof hockey scene, the killer would never be caught.\n\nKevin Smith has since claimed he concluded ''Clerks'' this way for three reasons. The primary reason was irony, the ending would be the payoff for Dante's repeated claims of \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\" Smith also stated that the ending was an homage to the ending of [[Spike Lee]]'s ''[[Do The Right Thing]]'', a comedic film with a dark ending. Lee's name can also be seen in the \"special thanks\" portion of the credits. Smith also stated that he ended ''Clerks'' with Dante's death because he \"didn't know how to end a film\".<ref name=snowballdoc /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70020/18-black-and-white-facts-about-clerks |title=18 Black-and-White Facts About 'Clerks' |author=Nick Keppler |website=[[Mental Floss]] |date=October 17, 2015 |access-date=January 21, 2017 |archive-date=June 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629192119/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70020/18-black-and-white-facts-about-clerks |url-status=live}}</ref> Both versions are available in ''Clerks X'', the 10th-anniversary special edition; the lost ending itself was among the extras on the 1995 LaserDisc and the 1999 DVD release; Smith states in his commentary on the 1999 DVD that had he kept the original ending, likely no further View Askewniverse films would have been made. The culprit in question was played by Smith's cousin John Willyung, who went on to appear in later films (most notably as Cohee Lunden in ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' and ''[[Clerks III]]'' and as himself in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]]''). On their movie review show, [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] (both of whom had given thumbs-up reviews to the film in 1994), had a special segment on a November 1995 show that presented and discussed this original ending. Siskel said that having the alternate ending could have worked but it would have to be longer with more tension to suggest that something like this could happen, while Ebert said he understood Smith's desire to do something memorable/shocking but concluded \"ultimately, I'm glad Smith decided to spare Dante.\"\n\n==Release==\n''Clerks'' became a surprising success after it was taken by [[Miramax Films]] and grossed over $3 million in the United States, despite never playing on more than 50 theater screens in the United States at the same time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Box Office History for Clerks Movies |work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|publisher=Nash Information Services |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Clerks.php  |access-date=June 22, 2006 |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611234606/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/Clerks.php |url-status=live}}</ref> It grossed $1.3 million internationally for a worldwide gross of $4.4 million.<ref name=gross/>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Clerks'' was well received by critics and developed a [[Cult film|cult following]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Tobias |first=Scott |title=The New Cult Cannon: Clerks |website=[[The A.V.

This was followed by a [[LaserDisc]] version on August 30, 1995, and a DVD on June 29, 1999. The laserdisc and DVD versions feature the original letterboxed version of the film, [[audio commentary]] by Smith and various cast and crew members, seven [[deleted scene]]s from the film, a [[Trailer (promotion)|theatrical trailer]], and a [[music video]] for [[Soul Asylum]]'s \"Can't Even Tell\" directed by Smith which features him, Mewes, Anderson, and O'Halloran reprising their roles from the film.\n\nOn September 7, 2004, ''Clerks X'' was released to celebrate the film's tenth anniversary. This three-disc set includes, among other things, the features from the initial 1999 DVD, the aforementioned ''Lost Scene'', an unrestored ''First Cut'' featuring the deleted scenes and original ending intact, the original cast auditions, a new making-of documentary entitled ''The Snowball Effect'', a [[The Tonight Show]] short film starring Dante and Randal entitled ''[[The Flying Car (2002 film)|The Flying Car]]'', Smith and Mosier's student film ''Mae Day'', MTV spots with Jay and Silent Bob, still galleries, and eight articles and reviews.

Special features include \"Clerks: The Lost Scene\", \"The Flying Car\", and original cast auditions. In the fall of 2006, a new edition of the ''Clerks'' DVD appeared in Canada, dubbed the ''Clerks: Snowball Edition''.

It was composed of various new and previously released songs by [[alternative rock]], [[grunge]] and [[punk rock]] artists such as [[Bad Religion]], [[Love Among Freaks]], [[Alice in Chains]], and [[Soul Asylum]]. The soundtrack also featured various sound clips from the film. It has been noted that ''Clerks'' is one of the very few films in which the cost of obtaining the rights to the music used was a great portion of the production costs for the entire film.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/clerks-budget/ |title=POTD: Kevin Smith Shows Original Clerks Budget Proposal |date=January 1, 2016 |website=/Film |language=en-US |access-date=February 22, 2020 |archive-date=February 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222070017/https://www.slashfilm.com/clerks-budget/ |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Soul Asylum song \"Can't Even Tell\", which was played over the film's end credits and featured on the soundtrack, peaked at number 16 on the [[Alternative Songs|Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in 1994.

The song was issued as a single in late 1994, due to renewed radio interest from the song's appearance in ''Clerks''. The song peaked at #7 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and #22 on the [[Billboard Modern Rock Tracks]] in early 1995.\n\n== Sequels ==\nAlthough not direct sequels in terms of addressing the original film's storyline, characters from the original ''Clerks'' \u2013 primarily Jay and Silent Bob \u2013 appeared in the films ''[[Mallrats]]'' (1995), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999), ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' (2001), and ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Reboot]] (2019),'' all of which take place in the same continuity as ''Clerks''. Dante and Randal also reprised their roles in ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', which was originally promoted as the finale to the series, but an official sequel to ''Clerks'' was announced a few years later.\n\n=== ''Clerks II'' ===\n{{Main|Clerks II}}\nThe live-action, feature film [[sequel]] to ''Clerks'' was released on July 21, 2006. The working title was ''The Passion of the Clerks'', though the film was released under the title ''Clerks II''. The credits for ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' stated \"Jay and Silent Bob will return in ''Clerks 2: Hardly Clerkin{{'}} ''\"; however, that project \"evolved\" into ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back''. The sequel features Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran reprising their roles as Dante Hicks and Randal Graves. The two now work at a [[Mooby]]'s restaurant after the latter's incompetence resulted in the destruction of the Quick Stop and RST Video.\n\n=== ''Clerks III'' ===\n{{Main|Clerks III}}\nDuring interviews for ''Clerks II'', Smith briefly discussed the possibility of a ''Clerks III''. Stating that \"if there's ever gonna be a ''Clerks III'', it would be somewhere down the road in my 40s or 50s, when it might be interesting to check back in on Dante and Randal.

Of all of Smith's films, however, ''Clerks'' is the one with the most direct spin-off products.\n\n=== ''Clerks: The TV Show'' ===\nA pilot for a [[live-action]] TV series was produced in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npcentral.org/pictures/clerks/clerks.html |title=Clerks |date=May 26, 2008 |website=Npcentral.org |access-date=September 2, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526165337/http://www.npcentral.org/pictures/clerks/clerks.html |archive-date=May 26, 2008}}</ref> It was produced by [[Touchstone Television]] and was to be developed by [[Richard Day (writer)|Richard Day]]. The pilot only referenced the character names and starred none of the cast from the original film, contained no foul language (except words suitable enough for a [[TV-PG]] rating), and did not feature Silent Bob. The character of Jay was featured, prompting Smith to point out that he owned the character rights to both Jay and Silent Bob (for the purposes of featuring them in separate films). The producers' solution was to change the character's name to Ray. Smith was unaware of the production of the series until casting was underway. Smith, as well as Mosier, had been in production with ''[[Mallrats]]'' at the time and attempted to become involved in the series but became disheartened quickly as an episode he had written for the series was shot down to be used as a potential B-plot. He would later use the script for an episode of ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]''.<ref name=\"Threevening\">{{cite video |people=[[Kevin Smith]] |title=[[Sold Out: A Threevening with Kevin Smith]] |medium=Documentary |publisher=[[View Askew Productions]] |location=Red Bank, New Jersey |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nO'Halloran and Anderson both auditioned for the role of Dante Hicks (as Anderson's part of Randal Graves from the film had already been filled by future ''[[Saturday Night Live|SNL]]'' performer [[Jim Breuer]]). After seeing the result, Smith, Mosier, Mewes, O'Halloran, and Anderson all said that it was terrible, and O'Halloran and Anderson further stating they were both glad they weren't involved.<ref name=\"Threevening\" />\n\n=== ''Clerks: The Animated Series'' ===\n{{Main|Clerks: The Animated Series}}\n[[Touchstone Television]] (with [[Miramax Films]]) also produced ''Clerks: The Animated Series'' a short-lived six-episode [[animated television series]] featuring the same characters and cast of the original film. Two episodes aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in late May/early June 2000 before being pulled from the lineup. The full six episodes were released on DVD in 2001 before being run on [[Comedy Central]] in 2004 and [[Adult Swim]] from 2008 to 2010. In a trailer for (but not in) ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', Randal, referencing the series, says to Dante: \"If you were funnier than that, ABC would've never cancelled us.\"\n\n=== ''Clerks: The Comics'' ===\n{{Main|Clerks (comics)}}\n''Clerks.'' is a series of [[comic]]s written by Smith featuring characters from the film. In the series are ''Clerks: The Comic Book'', ''Clerks: Holiday Special'', and ''Clerks: The Lost Scene''. Smith has discussed plans for ''Clerks 1.5'', a comic that would bridge the gap between the original film and its [[Clerks II|sequel]], to be included in a reprint of the ''Clerks.'' trade paperback.<ref>Rich Johnston. \"[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=15019 Lying In The Gutters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111115739/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=15019 |date=January 11, 2009 }}\" Vol 2, issue 16, for September 6, 2005.
