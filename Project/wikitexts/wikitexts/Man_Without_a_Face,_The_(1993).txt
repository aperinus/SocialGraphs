The film is based on [[Isabelle Holland]]'s 1972 novel of the same name. Gibson's direction received positive reviews from most critics.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1968, Justin McLeod has been living an isolated existence as a reclusive painter for the past seven years, following a car accident that left him disfigured on the right side of his face and chest burns sustained in the post-crash fire.\n\nChuck Nordstadt is a young boy who endures a well adjusted relationship with his academically brilliant sisters and their mother. One day, Chuck meets McLeod on a ferry when McLeod witnesses Chuck in an act of vandalism born of escalating frustration. Chuck is both intrigued and slightly scared of him. Chuck needs a tutor to help him pass a military academy's entrance exam that he'd failed earlier that year. Eventually, upon discovering that McLeod is a teacher, Chuck persuades him to become his tutor. While he is initially baffled by McLeod's unorthodox methods, the two eventually develop a close friendship.\n\nChuck keeps his daily meetings with McLeod a secret in order to avoid being scorned for associating with a disfigured man whose past is shrouded in mystery. No one knows much about McLeod and few people have ever made an effort to know him. As a result, McLeod has become the object of gossip, speculation, and suspicion. \"A proper troll,\" McLeod notes with self-deprecating humour. \"Tourist board oughta pay me.\"\n\nUltimately, Mrs. Nordstadt learns that her son has been visiting McLeod. She and the rest of the town convince themselves that McLeod is [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] Chuck, despite Chuck's adamant denials. Chuck researches McLeod's car accident, which involved the death of another boy, thus causing McLeod's fear of another attachment. Chuck is forcibly taken to a psychiatrist, who Chuck correctly suspects is also biased against McLeod.\n\nChuck inevitably confronts McLeod to learn the truth of his disfigurement and to discover the identity of the youth who was killed in the car crash. As it turns out, the boy was a student of McLeod's. Consequently, McLeod was unjustly branded a [[pedophile]], exiled from his hometown, convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served three years in prison. Once his relationship with Chuck is openly known, McLeod is once again run out of town and ordered by the authorities not to have any contact with Chuck.\n\nChuck enters the military academy he'd worked so hard to get into. At mail call, he gets the letters he'd sent to McLeod, marked Undeliverable. Needing to know what's happened to his friend, Chuck went home from school that afternoon, and goes back to McLeod's house. He finds it empty, but for a painting he'd done of Chuck that summer, and a letter written by McLeod. The letter tells Chuck that he's moved on, and that he wishes him the best of luck in his academic goals, thanking him for the gift of grace he'd so unexpectedly been given.\n\nIn the film's final scene, Chuck is shown graduating from the military academy as his sisters and their mom (along with her oldest husband) look on proudly. Chuck sees a familiar figure in the background and recognizes it as his \"faceless\" tutor. They silently greet each other.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Justin McLeod\n* [[Nick Stahl]] as Charles E. \"Chuck\" Norstadt\n* Robert DeDiemar Jr as Charles E. \"Chuck\" Norstadt (older)\n* [[Margaret Whitton]] as Catherine Palin\n* [[Fay Masterson]] as Gloria Norstadt\n* [[Gaby Hoffmann]] as Megan Norstadt\n* [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Chief Wayne Stark\n* [[Richard Masur]] as Prof. Carl Hartley\n* [[Michael DeLuise]] as Douglas Hall, Gloria's boyfriend\n* [[Ethan Phillips]] as Todd Lansing\n* [[George Martin (American actor)|George Martin]] as Sam the Barber\n* Jean De Baer as Mrs. Lansing\n* [[Jack De Mave]] as Mr. Cooper\n* [[Viva (Warhol superstar)|Viva]] as Mrs. Cooper\n* Justin Kanew as Rob Lansing\n}}\n\n==Release==\n''The Man Without a Face'' was released on August 25, 1993, in 865 theatres.

In the original novel, McLeod behaves in a way that could be interpreted as [[child grooming]], taking Chuck swimming and behaving affectionately toward him. Chuck, meanwhile, seems to be attracted to McLeod as more than just a father figure. There is one scene where it is strongly implied that Chuck and McLeod have some kind of sexual experience in his bedroom. In the film, McLeod demonstrates no sexual interest in the boy at all, even though Chuck appears downstairs in his underwear when the police officer calls.\n\nGibson has expressed dislike for the book because of its implied sexual contact between McLeod and Chuck: \"I read the script first and that's what I liked. The book is just \u2013 I'm sorry, but the guy did it. And you know, like, why? I just wanted to say something a lot more positive.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=The Many Faces of Mel|author=Joanna Conners|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=August 22, 1993}}</ref>\n\n==Urban legend==\nAround the time of the release of Gibson's 2000 film ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'', and again around the time of the release of his 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', an Internet rumor falsely attributed to radio commentator [[Paul Harvey]] claimed this film was based on an actual incident that happened to Gibson as a young man.
