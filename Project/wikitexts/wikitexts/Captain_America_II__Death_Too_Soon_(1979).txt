He bids her to do this in order to set a trap for the muggers, and springs the trap as Captain America.\n\nIn the meantime, a free-lance revolutionary terrorist calling himself General Miguel ([[Christopher Lee]]), planning to fight an unspecified war, kidnaps a Professor Ian Ilson (Christopher Cary) and forces him to resume his research in manipulative [[gerontology]]. Ilson has managed to formulate both a chemical that accelerates aging and the antidote to the same chemical, and Miguel, posing as the warden of a prison in Oregon near Portland, plans to use the chemicals in question to hold Portland hostage for a multimillion-dollar ransom.\n\nUltimately Rogers and Miguel directly clash face-to-face, and when Miguel throws a glass bottle of the aging accelerant into the air, hoping it will shatter against Captain America's body, the Captain throws his shield into the air, where it shatters the bottle in such a manner that the aging accelerant splashes them both. However, the Captain only receives a minor amount and thus only ages a month. Miguel, on the other hand, ages to death in less than a minute.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Reb Brown]] as [[Captain America|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Miguel\n* [[Connie Sellecca]] as Dr. Wendy Day\n* [[Len Birman]]  as Dr. Simon Mills\n* [[Susan French]] as Mrs. Shaw\n* [[William Lucking]] as Stader\n* [[Lana Wood]] as Yolanda\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released theatrically in France in 1980 and had a special film festival screening in Finland in 2014.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6_uCwAAQBAJ&q=Spider-man+1978+japanese+theatrical&pg=PT13|title=Marvel Comics into Film: Essays on Adaptations Since the 1940s|first1=Matthew J.|last1=McEniry|first2=Robert Moses|last2=Peaslee|first3=Robert G.|last3=Weiner|date=30 March 2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786443048|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0078938}}\n* {{Letterboxd film}}\n\n{{Captain America}}\n{{Marvel comics TV}}\n{{Ivan Nagy}}\n\n[[Category:Action television films]]\n[[Category:CBS network films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ivan Nagy]]\n[[Category:Captain America films]]\n[[Category:1979 television films]]\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s superhero films]]\n[[Category:1979 action films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]\n[[Category:Live-action films based on Marvel Comics]]"}]}}}}
