The video was directed by [[John Landis]], written by Landis and Jackson, and stars Jackson and [[Ola Ray]]. It references numerous [[horror film]]s and sees Jackson dancing with a horde of [[zombie]]s.\n\nJackson's sixth album, ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'', was released in November 1982 and spent months at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], backed by successful videos for the singles \"[[Billie Jean]]\" and \"[[Beat It]]\". In July 1983, after ''Thriller'' was displaced from the top of the chart, Jackson's manager [[Frank DiLeo]] suggested making a music video for \"Thriller\". Jackson hired Landis after seeing his 1981 film ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]''. The pair conceived a short film with a budget much larger than previous music videos. It was filmed at various locations in Los Angeles, including the [[Palace Theater (Los Angeles)|Palace Theater]]. A making-of documentary, ''Making Michael Jackson's Thriller,'' was produced to sell to television networks.\n\n''Michael Jackson's Thriller'' was launched to great anticipation and played regularly on [[MTV]]. It doubled sales of ''Thriller'', helping it become the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album in history]], and sold over a million copies on [[VHS]], becoming the best-selling videotape at the time. It is credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, breaking down racial barriers in popular entertainment and popularizing the making-of documentary format. The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global [[pop culture]].\n\nMany elements of ''Michael Jackson's Thriller'' have had a lasting impact on popular culture, such as the zombie dance and Jackson's [[Thriller jacket|red jacket]], designed by Landis's wife [[Deborah Nadoolman Landis|Deborah Nadoolman]]. Fans worldwide re-enact its zombie dance and it remains popular on [[YouTube]]. The [[Library of Congress]] described it as the most famous music video of all time, and it has been named the greatest video by various publications and readers' polls. In 2009, it became the first music video inducted into the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Mjthriller.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Jackson dancing with zombies in the video]]\nIn the 1950s, [[Michael Jackson]] and a young woman ([[Ola Ray]]) run out of gas while driving in a wooded area. They walk into the forest, and Jackson asks her to be his girlfriend; she accepts. He warns her that he is \"not like other guys\", transforms into a [[werecat]]<ref name=\"vox thriller\" /><!-- Not \"werewolf\" - makeup artist says it was a werecat, see Production section below --> and attacks her.\n\nIn the present, Jackson and his girlfriend are watching the werecat film in a theater. The girlfriend leaves, scared by the film. Walking down a city street at night, Jackson teases her by performing the verses of \"[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]\". They pass a graveyard, where [[zombie]]s rise from their graves and surround them in the street. Jackson becomes a zombie himself and dances with the horde to the song. He changes back into a human to sing the choruses.\n\nJackson and the zombies chase his girlfriend into an abandoned house. She screams and wakes up, realizing it was a nightmare. Jackson embraces her, but turns to the camera and grins, revealing his werecat<!-- Not \"werewolf\" - makeup artist says it was a werecat, see Production section below --> eyes.\n\n===Horror elements===\nThe ''Thriller'' video makes many allusions to [[horror film]]s.<ref name=\"Mercer\">Mercer (2005), p. 85-89</ref> The opening scene parodies 1950s [[B movie|B-movies]], with Jackson and Ray dressed as 1950s teenagers. The metamorphosis of the polite \"[[Boy next door (stock character)|boy next door]]\" into a werecat has been interpreted as a depiction of male sexuality, depicted as naturally bestial, predatory, and aggressive. The critic [[Kobena Mercer]] found similarities to the werewolf in ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' (1984).<ref name=\"Mercer\" />\n\nThe zombie dance sequence corresponds the lyric about a [[masquerade ball]] of the dead.<ref name=\"Mercer2\">Mercer (1991), p. 316-317</ref> Jackson's make-up casts \"a ghostly pallor\" over his skin and emphasizes the outline of his skull, an allusion to the mask from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).<ref name=\"Mercer2\" /> According to [[Peter Dendle]], the zombie invasion sequence was inspired by ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968). Dendle wrote that the video captures the feelings of [[claustrophobia]] and helplessness essential to [[zombie film]]s.<ref name=\"Dendle\">Dendle (2001), p. 171</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:John landis.jpg|thumb|253x253px|[[John Landis]] (pictured in 2005) directed the video.]]\nMichael Jackson's album ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' was released in November 1982 on [[Epic Records]] and spent months at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Nancy|date=January 24, 2010|title=The 'Thriller' Diaries|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/07/michael-jackson-thriller-201007|url-status=live|access-date=October 9, 2019|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazines)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref> It was backed by successful music videos for the singles \"[[Billie Jean]]\" and \"[[Beat It]]\", which are credited for raising creative standards for music videos and demonstrating their promotional power.<ref name=\"Griffin\" />\n\nIn June 1983, ''Thriller'' was displaced from the top of the ''Billboard'' 200 chart by the [[Flashdance (soundtrack)|''Flashdance'' soundtrack]].
