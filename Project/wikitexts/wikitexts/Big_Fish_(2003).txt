(December 19, 2003). [https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,560441,00.html Big Fish]. ''Entertainment Weekly''.</ref> The film stars [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Albert Finney]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Jessica Lange]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Alison Lohman]], [[Robert Guillaume]], [[Marion Cotillard]], [[Steve Buscemi]], and [[Danny DeVito]]. The film tells the story of a frustrated son who tries to distinguish fact from fiction in his dying father's life.\n\nScreenwriter [[John August]] read a manuscript of the novel six months before it was published and convinced [[Columbia Pictures]] to acquire the rights. August began adapting the novel while producers negotiated with [[Steven Spielberg]] who planned to direct after finishing ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (2002). Spielberg considered [[Jack Nicholson]] for the role of Edward Bloom, but eventually dropped the project to focus on ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002). [[Tim Burton]] and [[Richard D. Zanuck]] took over after completing ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (2001) and brought [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Albert Finney]] on board.\n\nThe film's theme of reconciliation between a dying father and his son had special significance for Burton, as his father had died in 2000 and his mother in 2002, a month before he signed on to direct. ''Big Fish'' was shot on location in [[Alabama]] in a series of fairy tale [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] evoking the tone of a [[Southern Gothic]] fantasy. ''Big Fish'' premiered on December 4, 2003, at the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] and was released in theaters on December 10, 2003, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, and grossed $122.9 million against a $70 million budget. The film received award nominations in multiple film categories, including four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, seven nominations from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], two [[Saturn Award]] nominations, and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] and a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Danny Elfman]]'s original score. The set for the town of [[Spectre (fictional town)|Spectre]] still remains and can be found in [[Wetumpka, Alabama]] at [[Jackson Lake Island]].\n\n==Plot==\nAt Will Bloom's wedding party in 2000, his father Edward recalls the day Will was born, claiming he caught an enormous [[catfish]] using his wedding ring as bait. Will, having heard these stories all his life, has gradually grown exasperated with Edward's histronics, coming to believe all these tales to be just a ruse to captivate attention, and eventually falling out with his father.\n\nThree years later in 2003, Edward gets a cancer diagnosis. When the illness approaches its terminal stage, Will and his pregnant French wife Jos\u00e9phine return to his home town of Ashton, Alabama, to spend time with him in the last days. During the plane ride, Will begins to recall some of his father's usual stories, such as the tale of Edward's childhood encounter with a [[witch]] in 1932, who shows him his death in her glass eye. Edward, in spite of his illness, continues to tell the story of his life to Will and Jos\u00e9phine through this and other bits of personal lore and unlikely feats. As another example, he claims to have once been bedridden for three years due to his rapid growth spurts, and to have then became a locally famous sportsman, a mogul in grass-mowing in his neighborhood and other things, before being driven by his ambition to leave his hometown and pursue even bigger achievements.\n\nIn 1944, he sets out into the world with a misunderstood [[giant]], Karl, who was terrorizing the town by eating livestock from the surrounding farms and had been risking lynching by the scared and angry town folk. Edward and Karl leave Ashton with the major's blessing and celebrated by all local characters. Soon they encounter a fork in the road, and decide travel down separate paths and re-meet where they merge again. Edward chooses a dangerous-looking path through a swamp, confident that nothing can really harm him, since the witch had forecast a different death at an older age. Soon he discovers along this way the secret and otherworldy town of Spectre, where the cheery but strange locals claim that he was early but expected. Among them, he befriends Ashton poet laureate Norther Winslow, who had similarly left their town years ago and suddenly stopped to send any news. Edward makes also a big impression on the Spectre mayor's child daughter Jenny, who claims their big age different not to be a big obstacle to love, as it will get less significant once they are both adult. However, Edward leaves Spectre, unwilling to settle down so soon, but promising Jenny and the others that he will return.\n\nEdward and the Karl reunite. Continuing their wandering, they visit the Calloway Circus in 1948, where Karl turns out to be a more spectacular attraction than the local giant 'El Penumbra' (just a tall man) and Edward spots among the public a beautiful young woman, getting immediately infatuated. Karl is offered a job in the circus and Edward too convinces the [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] Amos Calloway to hire him, in return of one detail about the woman at the end of every month, instead of a normal salary. After three years of this arrangement and many small bits of information, in 1951 Edward discovers that Amos is secretly a [[werewolf]]. He is attacked by him during one of his periodic transformation, and similarly to the initial situation with Karl in Ashton, the circus people is about to shot the dangerous-looking \"freak\" with a silver bullet out of fear, but Edward manage to de-escalate the situation and shows the werewolf's playful and dog-like attitude instead, playing [[Fetch (game)|fetch]] until he turns back into human in the morning. Amos, impressed by Edward's courage, finally reveals the woman's name to be Sandra Templeton, and where to find her: she attends [[Auburn University]], but her graduation date is near and she will depart soon.\n\nEdward rushes to Auburn, and begins to closely court the friendly but already engaged Sandra over many days. He tries to win her over with more and more garish love declarations, going so far as to plant thousands of daffodils (her favorite flower, according to one of the personal details gathered from Amos) outside of her sorority house bedroom. This annoys her fiance, Edward's childhood peer Don Price, also from Ashton. Don was already envious of Edward's always gaining the spotlight in every endeavors, and brutally beats up him up eventually. This however prompts Sandra to break off their engagement and actually decide to marry Edward. Not long after, Don dies an obscure death due to a [[heart attack]] in the toilet, as the witch had prophesied.\n\nShortly after the happy marriage with Sandra, Edward is [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the army in 1952. He is sent to fight in the [[Korean War]], but tries to shorten his tour of duty by volunteering for all the riskiest missions, in attempt to gain a honorable early discharge and return to his wife. In one of such missions, he parachutes alone into the middle of a [[North Korea]]n military show, steals important documents, and convinces local troop entertainers [[Conjoined twins|Siamese twins]] Ping and Jing to help him go home and flee the country all together, in exchange for making them celebrities on the larger stage of American show business. \nUpon returning home, Edward decides to turn his skills into making money to buy his dream family home. He becomes again without effort a successful but fairly ordinary [[door-to-door|travelling salesman]], until he crosses paths by chance with Winslow in a bank in 1963. It turns out that Winslow is there as a robber, claiming to have been inspired to also leave Spectre by Edward's example. Edward is unwittingly brought to help with the robbery, but the bank staff reveals not to have any money and to have kept pretension of solvency only to avoid a [[bank run]]. During their escape, Edward lectures the poet about where real money can be made in quicker but riskier ways than armed robberies, i.e. on the stock market. Winslow decides to follow such advice and parts ways, to start a career in [[Wall Street]] where he will become a wealthy broker. In gratitude, he repays Edward with ten thousand dollars, which allow Edward and his wife to finally move into their dream house.\n\nIn the present, Will is beginning to set his father's affairs into order and this gradually brings him to investigate the truth behind the above many tales. Upon finding some documents actually citing the town of Spectre, he travels there and meets an older Jenny, living alone in a dilapidated house. The aged woman explains that in 1968, Edward had indeed returned to the town of his first side-stop out of Ashton, and that he was instrumental in rescuing all the citizenship from bankruptcy, by buying all properties in an auction and letting all people to stay for free, thanks to the financial backing of his rich friends like Winslow or Ping and Jing. In particular, he had saved and rebuilt Jenny's old house with help of the giant Karl. Will figures out that Jenny and his father had actually an affair during his travel salesman's days, although dates and chronology of the embellished tales don't entirely add up. The woman acknowledges that there was indeed some truth in that, but that Edward had never stopped really loving his wife Sandra.\n\nWill returns home, but finds out that during this absence Edward's condition has suddenly deteriorated further. He has had a [[stroke]], requiring urgent care back at the hospital. Will rushes to his death bed, where Edward briefly regains consciousness but is unable to speak much. They seem to have reached however a better degree of understanding and reconciliation than in years. Will calms down his dying father by taking over his usual role of narrating magic tales barely linked to the more prosaic reality, imagining in particular how the witch's glass eye prophecy could be reconciled with the present hospitalization, and lead to a spectacular happy ending among all other characters of a lifetime. His father dies peacefully in his arms during the tale.\n\nAt the funeral, Will and Jos\u00e9phine are surprised when they start noticing all the people from Edward's stories. Everybody is slightly less fantastical than described, but still clearly recognizable from his father's over-the-top tales. They also share their own memories of Edward's life and of the experiences together, which may have not been so incredible but clearly left all of them inspired and enriched. Some time later, Will is shown to be also a father, now having fully endorsed Edward's tales which he passes on to his own young son.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Ewan McGregor]] as Edward Bloom (young)\n*[[Albert Finney]] as Edward Bloom (senior)\n*[[Billy Crudup]] as Will Bloom\n*[[Jessica Lange]] as Sandra Bloom (senior)\n*[[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Jenny (young & senior) / The Witch\n*[[Alison Lohman]] as Sandra Bloom (young), n\u00e9e Templeton\n*[[Robert Guillaume]] as Dr. Bennett (senior)\n*[[Marion Cotillard]] as Jos\u00e9phine\n*[[Missi Pyle]] as Mildred\n*[[Matthew McGrory]] as Karl the Giant\n*[[David Denman]] as Don Price (age 18\u201322)\n*[[Loudon Wainwright III]] as Beamen\n*Ada Tai and Arlene Tai as Ping and Jing\n*[[Steve Buscemi]] as Norther Winslow\n*[[Danny DeVito]] as Amos Calloway\n*[[Deep Roy]] as Mr. Soggybottom\n*Perry Walston as Edward Bloom (age 10)\n*Hailey Anne Nelson as Jenny (age 8)\n*Grayson Stone as Will Bloom (age 6\u20138)\n*R.

In college, August's father died, and like Will, August had attempted to get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, \"I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me.

I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible.\"<ref name=\"Faber\"/>\n\nReligion and film scholar Kent L. Brintnall observes how the father-son relationship resolves itself at the end of the film. As Edward dies, Will finally lets go of his anger and begins to understand his father for the first time:\n\n<blockquote>In a final gesture of love and comprehension, after a lifetime of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend reality and fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that all we are is our stories and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and a dimension that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father\u2014and the rest of us\u2014are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brintnall|first=Kent L.|date=April 2004|title=Big Fish|journal=[[Journal of Religion & Film]]|volume=8|issue=1|publisher=[[University of Nebraska at Omaha]]|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol8No1/Reviews/BigFish.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316031135/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol8No1/Reviews/BigFish.htm|archive-date=March 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nAbout six months before it was published, screenwriter [[John August]] read a manuscript of ''[[Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]'' (1998) by author [[Daniel Wallace (author)|Daniel Wallace]].<ref>{{cite video|people=August, John|date=2004|title=Big Fish: The Author's Journey|medium=DVD commentary track|time=1:23|publisher=Columbia Pictures}}</ref> August read the unpublished novel following the death of his father.

Following the production of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (2001), the director wanted to get back to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988).

Burton had previously worked with Nicholson on ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to use a combination of [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[prosthetic makeup]]. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question.<ref name=\"Faber\"/> Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with [[Ewan McGregor]] on ''[[Down with Love]]'' (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and [[Albert Finney]] for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague [[Johnny Depp]].<ref name=\"Faber\"/> Viewing Finney's performance in ''[[Tom Jones (1963 film)|Tom Jones]]'' (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] article comparing the two.<ref name=\"Empire\"/> McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a [[Southern American English]] accent. \"It's a much easier accent to do than a standard American accent because you can really hear it.
