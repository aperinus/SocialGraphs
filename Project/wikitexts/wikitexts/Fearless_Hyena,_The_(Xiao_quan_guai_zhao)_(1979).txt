It was Chan's directorial debut. The film was a box office success.<ref name=\"success\" />\n\nThe film has been released under several alternative titles internationally, including:\n\n* ''Revenge of the Dragon'' (USA video title)\n* ''Superfighter 3'' (West Germany video title)\n* ''The Shadowman'' (West Germany video title)\n\nThe film had a sequel, ''[[Fearless Hyena Part II]]'', released in 1983.\n\n==Plot==\nChing Hing-lung (Jackie Chan) is a youngster, living in a remote village with his grandfather, kung fu master Ching Pang-fei ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]). Lung does not take his training seriously enough, he gambles, and he gets into fights which lead him to display the skills his grandfather has told him he must keep secret.\n\nLung briefly finds employment selling coffins, working for an unscrupulous proprietor ([[Dean Shek]]), who even stoops to selling second-hand coffins. Lung is fired when he accidentally traps his boss in one of the coffins. After making his escape, he runs into three thugs he'd beaten up earlier, who ask him to teach them kung fu. Lung meets their sifu, Tee Cha ([[Lee Kwan]]), the unskilled leader of the Everything Clan. Master Tee offers Lung a lucrative job training his students and fighting against the top fighters from rival schools. This boosts the reputation of the school and of the scheming Master Tee. However, Lung makes the mistake of naming the school under the [[Xing Yi Quan|Ying Yee]] clan name. This comes to the attention of evil kung fu master Yam Tin-fa (Yam Sai-kwoon), who finds and kills Lung's grandfather. But, Lung eventually takes revenge for his grandfather's murder after undergoing rigorous training from The Unicorn (Chan Wai-lau).\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jackie Chan]] as Shing Lung \n*[[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] as Ching Pang-pei, Lung's grandfather\n*[[Dean Shek]] as The Coffin Seller\n*Chan Wai-lau as Unicorn \n*Yam Sai-koon as Yam Tin-fa\n*[[Lee Kwan]] as Tee Cha\n*Rocky Cheng as \"The Willow Sword\" Bar Tar\n*Chiang Chih-ping\n*Chu Siu-wa\n*[[Eagle Han-ying]] as Chin Wa-li\n*Hp Hing-nam\n*Chui Yuen\n*Wong Ken-mei\n*Kim Sae-ok\n*Kuo Nai-hua\n*[[Alan Chui Chung-San]]\n*Chang Ma\n*Peng Kong\n*Wong Yiu as Stony Egg\n*Man Lee-pang\n*Wong Chi-sang as One of Yam's men\n*Wang Jia-en\n\n==Fight scenes==\n[[File:Jackie Chan in The Fearless Hyena.jpg|thumb|[[Jackie Chan]] in ''The Fearless Hyena'']]\n\n''Fearless Hyena'' features several unusual slapstick fight scenes, including a [[chopsticks]] [[duel]] (homage later paid in the cartoon film, [[Kung Fu Panda (film)|Kung Fu Panda]]), Hing-lung fighting disguised as a [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] [[Mental retardation|mentally retarded]] man, disguised as a woman, and using \"Emotional Kung-Fu\", a style that involves vividly displaying the emotions of anger, sorrow, joy and happiness to find the opponent's weakness thus fighting whilst crying or laughing.\n\n==Box office==\nIn Hong Kong, the film grossed a total of {{HK$|5,445,535}} ({{US$|{{To USD|5445535|HKG|year=1979|round=yes}}|long=yes}}) at the Hong Kong box office.<ref name=\"success\">{{cite web |title=The Fearless Hyena (1979) |url=http://hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=5962 |website=[[Hong Kong Movie DataBase]] |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn South Korea, where it released in 1980, the film sold 436,545 tickets in [[Seoul City]],<ref>{{cite web |title=\uc601\ud654\uc815\ubcf4 |trans-title=Movie Information |url=http://www.kobis.or.kr/kobis/business/mast/mvie/searchMovieList.do |website=KOFIC |publisher=[[Korean Film Council]] |language=ko |accessdate=26 August 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> equivalent to an estimated {{Currency|{{#expr:436545*2000}}|KRW}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Park |first=Seung Hyun |title=A Cultural Interpretation of Korean Cinema, 1988-1997 |date=2000 |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilEeAQAAMAAJ |quote=Average Ticket Prices in Korea, 1974-1997 [...] * Source: Korea Cinema Yearbook (1997-1998) * Currency: won [...] Foreign [...] 1980 [...] 2,000}}</ref> ({{US$|{{To USD|873090000|KOR|year=1980|round=yes}}|link=no}}).\n\nIn France, it sold 187,706 tickets in 1984,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Soyer |first1=Renaud |title=Jackie Chan Box Office |url=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-jackie-chan-c24779784 |website=Box Office Story |date=4 February 2014 |language=fr |accessdate=1 July 2020}}</ref> equivalent to an estimated {{Currency|{{#expr:187706*2.7 round 0}}|code=Euro|linked=no}}<ref name=\"Europe\">{{cite book |chapter=Cinema market |title=Cinema, TV and radio in the EU: Statistics on audiovisual services (Data 1980-2002) |date=2003 |publisher=[[Office for Official Publications of the European Communities]] |isbn=92-894-5709-0 |issn=1725-4515 |pages=31\u201364 (61) |edition=2003 |chapter-url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/5648553/KS-BT-03-001-EN.PDF/3758081d-5ae4-4e21-9d78-fca7bcc68d5c#page=67 |website=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref> ({{US$|{{To USD|506806|EUR|year=1984|round=yes}}|long=yes}}).\n\nCombined, the film grossed an estimated {{US$|{{#expr:1088526+1437345+399870}}|year=1979|round=-6}} in Asia and Europe.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hong Kong|Film|Martial arts}}\n* [[Jackie Chan filmography]]\n* [[List of martial arts films]]\n* [[List of films in the public domain in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/movie.asp?id=656 ''Fearless Hyena''] at Hong Kong Cinemagic\n* {{IMDb title|id=0079315|title=Fearless Hyena}}\n* {{Amg movie|16977|The Fearless Hyena}}\n\n{{Jackie Chan|state=expand}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fearless Hyena, The}}\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1979 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1979 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1979 martial arts films]]\n[[Category:1970s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jackie Chan]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong martial arts comedy films]]\n[[Category:Kung fu films]]\n[[Category:Wushu films]]\n[[Category:1970s Hong Kong films]]"}]}}}}
