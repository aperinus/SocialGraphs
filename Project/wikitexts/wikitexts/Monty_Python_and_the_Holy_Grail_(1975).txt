It was conceived during the hiatus between the third and fourth series of their [[BBC Television]] series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.\n\nWhile the group's first film, ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', was a compilation of [[sketch comedy|sketches]] from the first two television series, ''Holy Grail'' is an original story that parodies the legend of [[King Arthur]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. Thirty years later, Idle used the film as the basis for the 2005 [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[Spamalot]]''.\n\n''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' grossed more than any British film exhibited in the US in 1975. In the US, it was selected in 2011 as the second-best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]'' behind ''[[Airplane!]]'' In the UK, readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine in 2000 ranked it the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time;<ref name=\"BBC News\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/948331.stm \"Life of Brian tops comedy poll\"].

Along the way, Arthur debates whether [[swallow|swallows]] could carry coconuts, passes through a town infected with the [[Black Death]], recounts receiving [[Excalibur]] from the [[Lady of the Lake]] to two [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] peasants, defeats the [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]] and observes an impromptu [[Witch-hunt|witch trial]]. He recruits [[Bedivere|Sir Bedevere the Wise]], [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot the Brave]], [[Galahad|Sir Galahad the Pure]], and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, along with their squires and Robin's minstrels. Arthur leads the knights to [[Camelot]], but, after a musical number, changes his mind, deeming it \"a silly place\". As they turn away, [[God]] appears and orders Arthur to find the [[Holy Grail]].\n\nArthur and his knights arrive at a castle occupied by French soldiers, who claim to have the Grail and taunt the Britons, driving them back with a barrage of barnyard animals. Bedevere concocts a plan to sneak in using a [[Trojan Horse|Trojan Rabbit]], but no one hides inside it, and the Britons are forced to flee when it is flung back at them. Arthur decides the knights should go their separate ways to search for the Grail. \n\nA modern-day historian filming a documentary on the Arthurian legends is killed by an unknown knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation.\n\nArthur and Bedevere are given directions by an old man and attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded [[Knights Who Say \"Ni!\"]] Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Knight by running away while the heads are arguing amongst themselves. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, which is occupied exclusively by young women, who wish to be punished for misleading him, but he is unwillingly \"rescued\" by Lancelot. Lancelot receives an arrow-shot note from Swamp Castle. Believing the note is from a lady being forced to marry against her will, he storms the castle and slaughters several members of the wedding party, only to discover the note is from an effeminate prince.\n\nArthur and his knights regroup and are joined by three new knights, as well as Brother Maynard and his monk brethren. They meet Tim the Enchanter, who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written. The entrance to the cave is guarded by the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. Underestimating it, the knights attack, but the Rabbit easily kills [[Bors]], [[Gawain]] and [[Sir Ector|Ector]]. Arthur uses the \"Holy Hand Grenade of [[Antioch]]\", provided by Brother Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside the cave, they find an inscription from [[Joseph of Arimathea]], directing them to Castle Aarrgh.\n\nAn animated cave monster devours Brother Maynard, but Arthur and the knights escape after the animator unexpectedly suffers a fatal heart attack. The knights approach the Bridge of Death, where the bridge-keeper demands they answer three questions in order to pass or else be cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Lancelot easily answers simple questions and crosses. Robin is defeated by an unexpectedly difficult question, and Galahad fails an easy one; both are magically flung into the gorge. When Arthur asks for clarification on an obscure question about swallows, the bridge-keeper cannot answer and is himself thrown into the gorge.\n\nArthur and Bedevere cannot find Lancelot, unaware that he has been arrested by police investigating the historian's death. The pair reach Castle Aarrgh, but find it occupied by the French soldiers. After being repelled by showers of manure, they summon an army of knights and prepare to assault the castle. As the army charges, the police arrive, arrest Arthur and Bedevere for the murder of the historian and break the camera, ending the film.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Graham Chapman]] as [[King Arthur|Arthur, King of the Britons]], the hiccuping guard, and the middle head of the Three-Headed Giant, as well as the voice of God\n* [[John Cleese]] as [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot the Brave]], the [[Black Knight (Monty Python)|Black Knight]], French Taunter, and Tim the Enchanter, among other roles\n* [[Terry Gilliam]] as [[Patsy (Monty Python)|Patsy]] (Arthur's servant), the Soothsaying Bridgekeeper, the Green Knight, Sir Bors, and himself as the Weak-Hearted Animator, among other roles\n* [[Eric Idle]] as Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, Lancelot's squire Concorde, Roger the Shrubber, and Brother Maynard, among other roles\n* [[Terry Jones]] as [[Bedivere|Sir Bedevere the Wise]], Prince Herbert, Dennis' mother, and the left head of the Three-Headed Giant, among other roles\n* [[Michael Palin]] as [[Galahad|Sir Galahad the Pure]], Leader of the [[Knights Who Say Ni]], Lord of Swamp Castle, Dennis, and the right head of the Three-Headed Giant, among other roles, and the film's narrator\n* [[Connie Booth]] as Miss Islington, the Witch\n* [[Carol Cleveland]] as Zoot and Dingo, [[Twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|identical twin]] sisters\n* [[Neil Innes]] as the Leader of Robin's Minstrels, among other roles\n* Bee Duffell as the Old Crone\n* [[John Young (actor)|John Young]] as Frank the Historian and the Old Man\n* Rita Davies as Frank's Wife\n* Avril Stewart as Dr. Piglet\n* Sally Kinghorn as Dr. Winston\n* Mark Zycon as Prisoner\n* Elspeth Cameron as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Mitsuko Forstater as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* [[Sandy Johnson (director)|Sandy Johnson]] as a Knight Who Says Ni, Villager at Witch Burning, Musician at Wedding, Monk, and Knight in Battle\n* Sandy Rose as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Romilly Squire as Musician at Wedding and Villager at Witch Burning\n* Joni Flynn as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Alison Walker as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Loraine Ward as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Anna Lanski as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Sally Coombe as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Vivienne MacDonald as\tGirl in Castle Anthrax (as Vivienne Macdonald)\n* Yvonne Dick as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Daphne Darling as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Fiona Gordon as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Gloria Graham as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Judy Lamb as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Tracy Sneddon as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Sylvia Taylor as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Joyce Pollner as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* Mary Allen as Girl in Castle Anthrax\n* [[Julian Doyle (filmmaker)|Julian Doyle]] as Police Sergeant (uncredited)\n* [[Charles Knode]] as Camp Guard and Robin's Minstrel (uncredited)\n* William Palin as Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film (uncredited)\n* [[Roy Forge Smith]] as Inspector at End of Film (uncredited)\n* [[Maggie Weston (make-up artist)|Maggie Weston]] as Page Turner (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|350px|thumb|The legend of the [[Holy Grail]] provided a unifying motif for the film.]]\nIn January 1973 the Monty Python troupe wrote the first draft of the screenplay.{{sfn|Palin|2006|p=174}}<ref name=\"BBCLocation\">{{cite AV media|author=Monty Python troupe |chapter=BBC Film Night: Monty Python & the Holy Grail Location Report |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}</ref> Half of the material was set in the [[Middle Ages]] and half was set in the present day.

This is actually a still photograph of the gorge at [[Mount Buffalo National Park]] in Victoria, Australia. Doyle stated in 2000 during an interview with ''[[Hotdog (magazine)|Hotdog]]'' magazine<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/mpholygrail/article5.html|title=Never have so few suffered for the enjoyment of so many: the making of Monty Python And The Holy Grail|date=October 2000|at=via [[Angelfire.com]] (convenience link)|magazine=[[Hotdog (magazine)|Hotdog]]}}</ref> that it was a still image filmed with candles underneath the frame (to give a heat haze). This was a low-cost method of achieving a convincing location effect.\n \nOn the DVD audio commentary, Cleese described challenges shooting and editing Castle Anthrax in \"The Tale of Sir Galahad\", with what he felt the most comedic [[take]] being unused because an anachronistic coat was visible in it.<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Cleese |first=John |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail commentary |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}</ref> Castle Anthrax was also shot in one part of Doune, where costume designer Hazel Pethig advised against [[Nudity in film|nudity]], dressing the girls in [[Shift (clothing)|shifts]].<ref name=\"QuestLocation\"/>\n\nIn the scene where the knights were combatting the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog]], a real white rabbit was used, switched with [[puppet]]s for its killings.<ref name=\"GilliamJones\">{{cite AV media|last1=Gilliam |first1=Terry |last2=Jones |first2=Terry |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail commentary |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}</ref> It was covered with red liquid to simulate blood, though the rabbit's owner did not want the animal dirty and was kept unaware.

Regardless, the rabbit itself was unharmed. Also, the rabbit-bite effects were done by special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton.\n\nAs chronicled in ''The Life of Python'', ''The First 20 Years of Monty Python'', and ''The Pythons' Autobiography'', Chapman suffered from [[acrophobia]], trembling and bouts of forgetfulness during filming due to his [[alcoholism]], prompting him to refrain from drinking while the production continued in order to remain \"on an even keel\". Nearly three years later, in December 1977, Chapman achieved [[sobriety]].\n\nOriginally the knight characters were going to ride real horses, but after it became clear that the film's small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided their characters would mime horse-riding while their [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] trotted behind them banging [[coconut]] shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned [[Foley (filmmaking)|sound effect]] used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as ''Die Ritter der Kokosnu\u00df'' (''The Knights of the Coconut'').<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/monty-python-ritter-der-kokosnuss-wird-40-a-1026828.html|title=Kult-Comedygruppe Monty Python: Mit Hase, Gral und Handgranate|last1=Pitzke|first1=Marc|date=9 April 2015|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date=9 January 2019|last2=York|first2=New}}</ref> Similarly, the Hungarian title ''Gyalog galopp'' translates to \"Galloping on Foot\".<ref>Foster, Simon (April 12, 2013).
