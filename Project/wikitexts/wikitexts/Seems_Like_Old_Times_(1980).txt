It was the only theatrical film directed by Sandrich, who is best known for his television sitcom directing work.\n\nAfter Nick Gardenia (Chase) is forced to rob a bank, and becomes a fugitive, he seeks help from his ex-wife Glenda Parks (Hawn), a public defender. Her current husband, Ira Parks (Grodin), is the Los Angeles County district attorney, who harbors a jealous disdain towards Nick.\n\nThe film was the second pairing of [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Chevy Chase]], after 1978's ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Gardenia ([[Chevy Chase]]), an out-of-luck writer, has the use of a friend's oceanside cabin in [[Big Sur]], [[California]]. He is interrupted by a pair of bank robbers who use him to rob a bank in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]]. Their [[modus operandi|M.O.]] is to take an innocent person, force them at gunpoint to rob a bank, and then take the money and toss their captive out of their car. Unfortunately for Nick (in one of Chase's signature pratfalls), he trips in the bank, is helped up and looks directly into a security camera.\n\nThe bank's picture of Nick comes to the attention of Los Angeles [[district attorney]] Ira Parks ([[Charles Grodin]]) when his assistant, Fred ([[Robert Guillaume]]), recognizes it to be Parks' wife's ex-husband. Because of his desire to become the state's [[attorney general]], Ira is frustrated and upset, thinking this could harm his campaign.\n\nIra's wife, Glenda ([[Goldie Hawn]]), is a lawyer herself. A [[public defender]], Glenda often tries to rehabilitate her clients by giving them odd jobs around their house, as with her chauffeur/butler Chester ([[T. K. Carter]]). After a long day in court, Glenda comes home to mixed news\u2014joy for Ira's run for Attorney General and surprise when Ira gives her the news about Nick. She wants to defend Nick because of her disbelief that he would ever do such a thing.\n\nThe robbers ditch Nick and he desperately begins to  make his way to Glenda and Ira's [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] home, inadvertently holding up a gas station attendant for candy bars along the way. During a party, Glenda, while searching for one of her dogs, finds Nick hiding in her garage. He begs for help and she tries to get him some food, despite most of the leaders of law enforcement being in her house. Nick explains what happened, but Glenda refuses to help unless he turns himself in. Glenda finally agrees to let him sleep in a guest room over the garage.\n\nThe next day Nick decides he wants to go after the guys who did this to him. After some comically close run-ins with the police, Ira, and her feisty maid, Aurora De La Hoya ([[Yvonne Wilder]]), Glenda manages to keep anyone from knowing Nick was there. He later robs Glenda of her car but then reappears over her garage, and another confrontation ensues between Ira and Glenda.\n\nIra soon discovers Nick was telling the truth about the two men who forced him to rob the bank. About to have the governor of California coming to the house for dinner, Glenda must deal with court cases, her maid having foot surgery (which could ruin the party without the governor's favorite dish), and Chester getting drunk in the kitchen. The party takes a hilarious turn when Nick, coming back to turn himself in, ends up serving dinner to the governor, Ira, Glenda, and Fred. The dinner ultimately ends in a fistfight between a jealous Ira and Nick, during which Fred is knocked out.\n\nNick, Glenda, Ira, Aurora, the dogs and the robbers ultimately end up in the courtroom of Glenda's favorite Judge John Channing ([[Harold Gould]]). While the judge is overwhelmed by the happenings in the Parks household, the police bring in the bank robbers. They admit Nick's innocence in exchange for a reduced sentence after getting caught by Aurora and the dogs when they attempted to force her to rob a bank, just like they had done with Nick.\n\nAfter all is said and done, Nick is free, but he and Glenda still have unresolved feelings. She decides to stay with Ira and kisses Nick good-bye. Some time later, Ira and Glenda decide to take a car trip to forget the recent events. They end up in an accident trying to avoid a cow on the road. Ira breaks his leg, so Glenda has to go for help. She ends up at the only place around: a cabin with all the lights on. Glenda pounds on the door begging for help. The door opens and she discovers the cabin is Nick's.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Glenda Gardenia Parks\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Nicholas 'Nick' J.

He said, \"the good parts were good enough to hold out the promise for more. The movie is Neil Simon's attempt at one of those 1940s-style screwball comedies with lots of surprise entrances and hasty exits and people hiding under the bed. It would be hard to improve on the casting (Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase and Charles Grodin). And there are a couple of really funny, sustained sequences.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Seems Like Old Times review|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/seems-like-old-times-1980|website=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=September 10, 2017|date=December 24, 1980}}</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also awarded two stars out of four and called it a \"limp comedy\" with \"only gag lines and no characters.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (December 19, 1980). \"'Times': Seems like so-so Simon\". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 1.</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film as \"Neil Simon in very funny form\" and the cast as \"extremely appealing,\" adding, \"The material here is slick and entertaining, and Mr. Sandrich settles for comic simplicity without reaching for anything more. He coaxes the film along at a cheerfully breakneck rhythm.\"<ref>Maslin, Janet (December 19, 1980). \"Screen: A Simon Comedy, 'Seems Like Old Times'\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. C6.</ref>\n\n[[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that \"if it gets a zero for innovation, it gets somewhere around 93 for the skill with which it delivers an old-fashioned slapstick farce. Like a [[Henny Youngman]] routine, it is funny partly because it tries so hard, in a stop-at-nothing-you-take-my-wife-please way, to be funny.\"<ref>Champlin, Charles (December 14, 1980). \"'Old Times'\u2014Skilled and Simple Simon\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Calendar, p. 49.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that Sandrich \"has relied basically upon Neil Simon's script, often funny but thin on development, to carry things. The result is a picture that is amusing on the surface but very typical in terms of its setups ... Of course, none of the pic's drawbacks much matter thanks to the extremely engaging rapport between Chase and Hawn.\"<ref>Film Reviews: Seems Like Old Times\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. November 26, 1980. 14.</ref> [[Jack Kroll]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote that Simon's working on the models of old screwball comedies gave the movie \"a breeziness most of his film writing has lacked. On the laugh meter this movie does well. Sandrich has a nice light touch, and his cast is excellent. Especially, of course, Goldie Hawn, the delightful comedienne who provides more pure pleasure than any other movie actress today.\"<ref>Kroll, Jack (January 5, 1981). \"Simonizing Goldie\". ''[[Newsweek]]''. 54.</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for a [[Razzie Awards|Razzie Award]] for Worst Supporting Actor for Charles Grodin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst |year=2005|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=0-446-69334-0}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nAccording to [[Turner Classic Movies]], Neil Simon was inspired by ''[[The Talk of the Town (1942 film)|The Talk of the Town]]''. This 1942 comedy starred [[Cary Grant]] as a wrongfully accused man hiding out at the home of a beautiful woman, played by [[Jean Arthur]], with [[Ronald Colman]] as the third member of the romantic triangle.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0081480|title=Seems Like Old Times}}\n* {{amg title|id=43625|title=Seems Like Old Times}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=4213}}\n* {{AFI film|id=56469|title=Seems Like Old Times}}\n* {{Mojo title|seemslikeoldtimes|Seems Like Old Times}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|seems_like_old_times|Seems Like Old Times}}\n\n{{Neil Simon}}\n\n[[Category:1980 films]]\n[[Category:1980 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Marvin Hamlisch]]\n[[Category:Films about bank robbery]]\n[[Category:Films set in California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Neil Simon]]\n[[Category:1980 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jay Sandrich]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
