[[Bill Murray]] stars as Bob Harris, a fading American movie star who is having a [[midlife crisis]] when he travels to [[Tokyo]] to promote [[Suntory]] whisky. There, he befriends another estranged American named Charlotte, a young woman and recent college graduate played by [[Scarlett Johansson]]. [[Giovanni Ribisi]] and [[Anna Faris]] also feature. The film explores themes of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and disconnection against a backdrop of cultural displacement in Japan. Further analysis by critics and scholars has focused on the film's defiance of mainstream narrative conventions and its atypical depiction of romance.\n\nCoppola started writing the film after spending time in Tokyo and becoming fond of the city. She began forming a story about two characters experiencing a \"romantic melancholy\"<ref name=\"olsen\" /> in the [[Park Hyatt Tokyo]], where she stayed while promoting her first feature film, the 1999 drama ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]''. Coppola envisioned Murray playing the role of Bob Harris from the beginning and tried to recruit him for up to a year, relentlessly sending him telephone messages and letters. While Murray eventually agreed to play the part, he did not sign a contract; Coppola spent a quarter of the film's $4 million budget without knowing if he would appear in Tokyo for shooting. When Murray finally arrived, Coppola described feelings of significant relief.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on September 29, 2002, and lasted 27 days. Coppola kept a flexible schedule during filming with a small crew and minimal equipment. The screenplay was short and Coppola often allowed a significant amount of improvisation during filming. The film's [[Cinematographer|director of photography]], [[Lance Acord]], used [[available light]] as often as possible and many Japanese places of business and public areas were used as locations for shooting. After 10 weeks of editing, Coppola sold distribution rights for the United States and Canada to [[Focus Features]], and the company promoted the film by generating positive word of mouth before its theatrical release.\n\nThe film premiered on August 29, 2003, at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] and was a major critical and commercial success. Critics praised the performances of Murray and Johansson, as well as the writing and direction of Coppola; limited criticism was given to the film's depiction of Japan. At the [[76th Academy Awards]], ''Lost in Translation'' won Coppola [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and the film was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Coppola), and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Murray). Other accolades won include three [[Golden Globe Awards]] and three [[British Academy Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nBob is a fading American movie star who arrives in [[Tokyo]] to appear in lucrative advertisements for [[Suntory]] whisky. He stays at the upscale [[Park Hyatt Tokyo]] and is suffering from strains in his 25-year marriage and a midlife crisis. Charlotte, another American staying at the hotel, is a young [[Yale University]] graduate in philosophy who is accompanying her husband John while he works as a celebrity photographer in Japan. Charlotte is feeling similarly disoriented as she questions her recent marriage and is unsure about her future. They both grapple with additional feelings of [[jet lag]] and [[culture shock]] in Tokyo and often pass the time lounging around the hotel.\n\nCharlotte is repelled by a vacuous Hollywood actress named Kelly, who is also at the Park Hyatt, promoting an action film. She bumps into Charlotte and John, gushing over photography sessions she has previously done with him. Bob and Charlotte frequently happen across each other in the hotel and eventually introduce themselves in the hotel bar.\n\nAfter several encounters, when John is on assignment outside Tokyo, Charlotte invites Bob into the city to meet some local friends. They bond through a fun night in Tokyo, where they experience the city nightlife together. In the days that follow, Bob and Charlotte spend more time together, and their friendship strengthens. One night, while neither can sleep, the two share an intimate conversation about Charlotte's personal uncertainties and their married lives.\n\nBob spends the night with a jazz singer from the hotel bar on the penultimate night of his stay. Charlotte hears the woman singing in Bob's room the next morning, leading to tension between Bob and Charlotte during lunch together later that day. The pair reencounter each other in the evening when Bob reveals that he will be leaving Tokyo the following day.\n\nBob and Charlotte reconcile and express how they will miss each other, making a final visit to the hotel bar. The next morning, when Bob is leaving the hotel, he and Charlotte share sincere but unsatisfactory goodbyes. On Bob's taxi ride to the airport, he sees Charlotte on a crowded street, stops the car, and walks to her. He then embraces her and whispers something (undisclosed to the audience) in her ear. The two share a kiss and say goodbye before Bob departs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Bob Harris, a fading movie star\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Charlotte, a recent college graduate\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as John, Charlotte's husband, a celebrity photographer\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Kelly, a Hollywood actress\n* Fumihiro Hayashi as Charlie, Charlotte's friend\n* Catherine Lambert as a jazz singer{{refn|Lambert was an actual performer in the bar at the Park Hyatt Tokyo.

Then you have to go back to your real lives, but it makes an impression on you. It's what makes it so great and enjoyable.\"<ref name=\"mitchell\" />\n\nGeoff King, a scholar who wrote a book about the film, comments that the experiences of the central characters are one factor that lends ''Lost in Translation'' to varied interpretations by academics.{{sfn|King|2010|p=127}} Todd McGowan reads the film from a [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] psychoanalytic perspective, arguing that the film encourages the embrace of \"absence\" in one's life and relationships.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=62}} He describes Coppola's depiction of Tokyo \"as a city bubbling over with excess\", which offers an empty promise of gratification.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=54}} In his view, both Bob and Charlotte recognize that they cannot find meaning in Tokyo's attractions, so they bond over their shared sense of emptiness in them.{{sfn|McGowan|2007|p=54}} Lucy Bolton offers a feminist reading, arguing that ''Lost in Translation'' evokes the thought of feminist philosopher [[Luce Irigaray]] by highlighting issues of young womanhood. She argues that the film provides a complex portrait of Charlotte's female subjectivity and an optimistic rendering of the character's pursuit for individual expression.{{sfn|Bolton|2011|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n===Narrative===\n''Lost in Translation'' has been broadly examined in terms of its narrative structure, with commentators noting that it contains few plot events as compared with films in the Hollywood mainstream. Narrative events are mostly focused on the development of Bob and Charlotte's relationship,{{sfn|King|2010|p=76}} with few \"external\" obstacles that impact the central characters.{{sfn|King|2010|p=82}} King notes, \"More time is taken to evoke the impressions, feelings, and experiences of the central characters\",{{sfn|King|2010|p=80}} which represents \"a shift in the hierarchical arrangement of [film elements]\" that prioritizes character experiences over plot.{{sfn|King|2010|pp=81\u201382}} The literary critic Steve Vineberg argues that \"the links of the story are indeed there, only they're not typical cause-and-effect connections.

The 36-second shot, which features Charlotte's backside as she lies on a bed wearing transparent pink panties, is based on the photorealist paintings of [[John Kacere]]<ref name=\"stern\" /> and has often been compared to the initial appearance of [[Brigitte Bardot]] in the 1963 film ''[[Contempt (film)|Contempt]]''.{{refn|For examples, see {{harvnb|Kennedy|2010|pp=46\u201347}}, {{harvnb|San Filippo|2003|p=26}}, and {{harvnb|Haslem|2004}}.|group=\"note\"}} While some have described it as a foreshadowing of a romance between Bob and Charlotte,{{refn|For example, see {{cite magazine |last1=Smith |first1=Paul Julian |title=Tokyo Drifters |magazine=[[Sight & Sound]] |date=2004 |volume=14 |issue=1 |page=13}}|group=\"note\"}} the film historian Wendy Haslem argues that \"Coppola's intention with this opening shot appears to be to defy taboos and to undermine expectations surrounding what might be considered the 'money shot' in more traditionally exploitative cinema.\"<ref name=\"haslem\" /> Correspondingly, the academic Maria San Filippo maintains that \"[Coppola] doesn't seem to be making a statement at all beyond a sort of endorsement of beauty for beauty's sake.\"{{sfn|San Filippo|2003|p=26}} King notes that the image contains both \"subtle\" and \"obvious\" appeal in its combination of aesthetic and erotic qualities, which signifies ''Lost in Translation''{{'}}s position between [[Major film studio|mainstream]] and [[independent film]].{{sfn|King|2010|pp=1\u20132}} The film scholar Todd Kennedy interprets it in terms of feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]]'s conception of the [[male gaze]], arguing that the shot \"lasts so long as to become awkward\u2014forcing the audience to become aware of (and potentially even question) their participation in the gaze.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|2010|p=45}}\n\n''Lost in Translation'' has also been noted for defying the conventions of mainstream romantic films. Haslem writes that the classic romantic comedy assures the audience that the couple has a future, but Coppola defies expectations by refusing to unite the central characters.<ref name=\"haslem\" /> She points to elements such as Bob and Charlotte's lack of sexual consummation as one factor that obscures whether their pairing is more romantic or platonic. Writing about the concluding sequence in which the characters make their final goodbyes, Haslem argues, \"Conventionally in mainstream cinema, the kiss{{nbsp}}... signifies resolution by reinforcing the myth of romantic love. But in this new wave of contemporary anti-romance romance, the kiss signifies ambiguity.\"<ref name=\"haslem\" /> The academic Nicholas Y.B. Wong contends that the film's lack of \"heart-melting connections and melodramatic (re)unions between characters\" represents a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] portrait of love, writing that ''Lost in Translation'' is \"about non-love, the predominance of affairs and the complexities of intimacy. Characters vacillate between falling in love and out of love. They are neither committed to someone nor emotionally unattached.\"{{sfn|Wong|2009|p=133}} Coppola said Bob and Charlotte's relationship is \"supposed to be romantic but on the edge.{{nbsp}}... [A] little bit more than friends but not an actual romance.{{nbsp}}... To me, it's pretty un-sexual between them\u2014innocent and romantic, and a friendship.\"<ref name=\"focusinterview\" />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Sofia Coppola.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.90|alt=See caption.|[[Sofia Coppola]] promoting ''Lost in Translation'' at the 2003 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]]]\nAfter dropping out of college in her early twenties,<ref name=\"meyer\">{{cite news |last1=Meyer |first1=Carla |title=Sofia Coppola has a little humor and, now, a big film.

When Japan appears superficial, inappropriately erotic, or unintelligible, we are never completely sure whether this vision belongs to Coppola, to her characters, or simply to a Hollywood cinematic imaginary\".{{sfn|King|2005|pp=45\u201346}} Moreover, Geoff King maintains that while depictions such as Charlotte's alienation from experiences like [[ikebana]] are evidence that the film abstains from the Orientalist \"mythology of Japanese tradition as source of solace\", the film often situates Japan as a source of \"difference\" for the characters by relying on crude jokes and stereotypes of the Japanese as \"crazy\" or \"extreme\".{{sfn|King|2010|pp=130\u2013132}} Coppola reported being surprised by such criticism, saying, \"I think if everything's based on truth you can make fun, have a little laugh, but also be respectful of a culture.
