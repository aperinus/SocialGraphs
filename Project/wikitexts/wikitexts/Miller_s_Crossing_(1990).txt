(1992). ''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style'' (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> [[gangster film]] written, directed and produced by the [[Coen brothers]] and starring [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Marcia Gay Harden]], [[John Turturro]], [[Jon Polito]], [[J. E. Freeman]], and [[Albert Finney]]. The plot concerns a power struggle between two rival gangs and how the protagonist, Tom Reagan (Byrne), plays both sides against each other.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose ''Miller's Crossing'' as one of the 100 greatest films made since the inception of the periodical. ''Time'' critic [[Richard Corliss]] called it a \"noir with a touch so light, the film seems to float on the breeze like the [[frisbee]] of a [[fedora (hat)|fedora]] sailing through the forest\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nTom Reagan is the right-hand man for [[Irish mob]]ster Leo O'Bannon, a [[political boss]] who runs an unnamed U.S. city during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].  Leo sets off a mob war when he extends protection to his girlfriend's brother, a bookie named Bernie Bernbaum, who is skimming off of the [[match fixing]] scheme of Leo's rival, the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian gangster]] Johnny Caspar.  The situation is further complicated by the fact that behind Leo's back, the girlfriend, Verna, is also sleeping with Tom.\n\nDespite his own relationship with Verna, Tom presses Leo to give up her brother to Caspar. When the war heats up, with an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom tries to persuade Leo that he is foolish to protect Bernie on Verna's behalf, making the point by revealing his affair with her. Leo publicly beats up Tom and cuts ties with both him and Verna.\n\nCast out and needing work, Tom turns to Caspar. As a loyalty test, Caspar commands Tom to kill Bernie, an awkward request given Tom\u2019s relationship with Bernie\u2019s sister. With Caspar\u2019s henchmen in tow, Tom leads Bernie to his execution in the woods at a spot called Miller\u2019s Crossing. Bernie grovels for his life, pleading \"Look in your heart\". Tom fakes the killing by firing his gun into the ground and orders Bernie to leave town. Caspar\u2019s henchmen, who are within earshot but cannot see the two men, are fooled and neglect to check for the body before leaving with Tom.\n\nWith Leo weakened, Caspar takes his place as city boss, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo's operations.\n\nWithin Caspar\u2019s gang, there is tension between Tom and Caspar\u2019s trusted enforcer, the brutal Eddie Dane (\"the Dane\"). Upon learning that his men didn't actually see Tom kill Bernie, the Dane takes Tom back to Miller's Crossing to verify that Bernie's body is there. Tom expects to find no corpse and to be executed for it, but instead the group finds a decomposing body that had been shot in the face and disfigured beyond recognition by birds. The Dane and his men assume the body is that of Bernie, but it is actually that of the Dane\u2019s lover, a man named Mink, whom Bernie had secretly killed and placed as a decoy where his own body should have been. Tom is now vulnerable if the Dane or Caspar discovers the identity of the body, a fact that Bernie uses in attempt to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar.\n\nWith Bernie supposedly dead, someone continues to cut into Caspar\u2019s match fix, and Tom and the Dane each try to convince Caspar that the other is behind it. Tom uses the sudden disappearance of Mink to sow suspicion about the Dane by insinuating that Mink has gone into hiding after he and the Dane betrayed Caspar. Caspar must decide between Tom and the Dane, a dilemma he resolves by shooting the Dane in the head as Tom looks on.\n\nTom then thins out his rivals by engineering a surprise meeting between Bernie and Caspar, knowing that the first one to be seen by the other is likely to be killed. Shortly after the arranged time, Tom arrives to discover that Bernie has killed Caspar. Tom tricks Bernie into surrendering his gun and declares his intent to kill him in retribution for his blackmail. Bernie again begs for mercy, saying, as he did at Miller\u2019s Crossing, \"Look in your heart\" but this time Tom asks rhetorically \"What heart?\" and shoots him.\n\nWith Caspar and the Dane dead, Leo resumes his post as the only boss in town. At Bernie\u2019s burial, Verna, now back in Leo's good graces, reacts coldly to Tom and walks back to her car. Leo notifies Tom that Verna has proposed to marry him. He offers Tom his job back but Tom rejects the offer and stays behind, watching Leo as he walks away.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as Tom Reagan\n* [[Albert Finney]] as Liam \"Leo\" O'Bannon\n* [[John Turturro]] as Bernie Bernbaum\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Verna Bernbaum\n* [[Jon Polito]] as Johnny Caspar\n* [[J.

The first image they conceived was that of a black hat coming to rest in a forest clearing; then, a gust of wind lifts it into the air, sending it flying down an avenue of trees. This image closes the film's opening credit sequence.\n\nBecause of the intricate, dense plot, the Coens suffered from [[writer's block]] with the script. They stayed with a close friend of theirs at the time, William Preston Robertson in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], hoping that a change of scenery might help. After watching ''[[Baby Boom (film)|Baby Boom]]'' one night, they returned to New York City and wrote ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (in three weeks) before resuming the ''Miller's Crossing'' screenplay.\n\nThe budget was reported by film industry magazines as around $14 million, but the Coens have said that the film cost \"substantially less\" than that.<ref name = AFI/> According to Paul Coughlin, \"The casting of Byrne allows for the psychological assurance, self-confidence and icy demeanour to be physically reproduced in the sturdy and unruffled presence of the tall and lean actor. Tom is 'a man who walks behind a man, whispers in his ear', he is the brains behind Leo's operation, and he is the heartless centre of ''Miller's Crossing''.\"<ref name=sensesofcinema/> Although he was a native Irishman playing a lieutenant to an Irish mobster, the Coens did not originally want Gabriel Byrne to use his own accent in the film. Byrne argued that his dialogue was structured in such a way that it was a good fit for his accent and after he tried it, the Coens agreed.<ref name=Jackson>[http://mentalfloss.com/article/69719/13-fascinating-facts-about-millers-crossing Jackson, Matthew. \"13 Fascinating Facts About ''Miller's Crossing''\", Mental Floss, October 10, 2015]</ref>\n\nDuring casting they had envisioned [[Trey Wilson]] (who played Nathan Arizona in their previous film ''[[Raising Arizona]]'') as gangster boss Leo O'Bannon but two days before principal photography began, Wilson died from a brain hemorrhage and Finney was cast. Roger Westcombe calls Finney's portrayal of Leo \"perfectly nuanced in a brilliant performance\".<ref name=Westcombe/> Finney also appears in drag in a cameo as an elderly female ladies' room attendant.<ref name=Jackson/>\n\nThe Coens cast family and friends in minor roles. [[Sam Raimi]], director and friend of the Coens, appears as the snickering gunman at the siege of the Sons of Erin social club, while [[Frances McDormand]], Joel Coen's wife, appears as the mayor's secretary. The role of The Swede was written for [[Peter Stormare]] but he could not be cast since he was playing [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] (a role often referred to as \"the Dane\"). [[J. E. Freeman]] was cast and the name of the character was changed to The Dane, while Stormare went on to be featured in ''[[Fargo (1996 film)|Fargo]]'' and ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.\n\nThe city in which the story takes place is unidentified but the film was shot in [[New Orleans]] as the Coen Brothers were attracted to its look. Ethan Coen commented in an interview, \"There are whole neighborhoods here of nothing but 1929 architecture. New Orleans is sort of a depressed city; it hasn't been gentrified. There's a lot of architecture that hasn't been touched, store-front windows that haven't been replaced in the last sixty years.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Levy | first = Steven | title = \"Shot By Shot,\" ''Joel and Ethan Coen: Blood Siblings'' | page = 75 | publisher = Plexus | year = 2000}}</ref> Principal photography ran from January 27 to April 28, 1989.<ref name = AFI/>\n\n== Influences ==\nRoger Westcombe finds in the opening title sequence of a fedora being blown off its bed of fallen leaves in the forest, a subtle homage to [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]'s 1963 French crime film ''[[Le Doulos]]'', which ends with the gangster protagonist's fate underlined wistfully by the shot of his fedora coming to rest, alone in the frame, in the soil of the forest floor.<ref name=Westcombe/>\n\nWriting in ''The Atlantic'', Christopher Orr sees in the opening scene, in which Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) confronts Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney) and Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) \"an obvious nod to the opening of ''[[The Godfather]]''\".<ref name=Orr>[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/30-years-of-coens-millers-crossing/379895/ Orr, Christopher. \"30 Years of Coens: Miller's Crossing\", ''The Atlantic'', September 10, 2014]</ref>\n\n''Miller's Crossing'' quotes many gangster films and [[film noir|films noir]]. Many situations, characters and dialogue are derived from the work of [[Dashiell Hammett]], particularly his 1931 novel ''[[The Glass Key]]''. There are some parallels between the two stories and many scenes and lines are lifted from this novel. The relationship between Tom and Leo in the film mirrors the relationship between Ned Beaumont and Paul Madvig, the principal characters of the Hammett novel.<ref name=franklycurious>Moraes, Francis.
