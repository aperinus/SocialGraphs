The film stars [[Chow Yun-fat]] as [[Tequila Yuen|Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen]], [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]] as Alan, an undercover cop, and [[Anthony Wong (Hong Kong actor)|Anthony Wong]] as Johnny Wong, a leader of the criminal [[Triad (underground society)|triads]].\n\nThe film was John Woo's last [[Hong Kong film]] before his transition to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. After making films that glamorized gangsters and receiving criticism for doing so, Woo wanted to make a ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' styled film to glamorize the police. With the death of screenwriter [[Barry Wong]], the film's screenplay underwent constant changes during filming. New characters such as Mad Dog and Mr. Woo were introduced, while the original plotline of a baby-poisoning psychopath was cut.\n\n''Hard Boiled'' was released in Hong Kong in 1992 to generally positive audience reception, but was not as commercially successful as Woo's previous films such as ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]''. Reception from Western critics was much more positive, with many critics and film scholars describing its action scenes as being among the best ever filmed. In 2007, a video game sequel titled ''[[Stranglehold (video game)|Stranglehold]]'' was released.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a teahouse in Hong Kong, [[Royal Hong Kong Police]] inspectors [[Tequila Yuen|\"Tequila\" Yuen]] and Benny Mak attempt to arrest a group of gun smugglers while they are making a deal. After an ambush from a rival gang, a fierce gun battle breaks out; the gangsters are defeated but several police officers are badly wounded and Benny is killed. As revenge, Tequila executes the gangster who killed Benny rather than arrest him, much to the chagrin of his superintendent Pang. Tequila is then ordered off the case for his misdeed.\n\nMeanwhile, Alan, an assassin under the employ of Triad boss \"Uncle\" Hoi, murders one of his subordinates who had double-crossed their clan for a rival syndicate led by upstart Johnny Wong. Wong, who is looking to usurp the old Triad bosses through his control of the illicit arms trade, is impressed by Alan's skill and attempts to recruit him. Alan reluctantly accepts the offer, and Wong brings Alan to a raid on Hoi's warehouse, where many of Hoi's men are killed.\n\nHoi is eventually cornered, and allows Alan to kill him in exchange for the safety of his men. After Alan shoots him, he kills the rest of his men regardless. Tequila then comes out from hiding and attacks all of Wong's men, but Alan spares Tequila's life in the chaos. Pang confirms to Tequila that Alan is an [[Undercover operation|undercover cop]]. Tequila tracks Alan down to his sailboat to try to make sense of the situation, but the two are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi's gang.\n\nTequila and Alan manage to kill their attackers just before Wong arrives, allowing Alan to keep his cover. Wong realizes that one of his lieutenants, Foxy, is a police informant. Foxy is beaten at the docks by Wong's henchman Mad Dog in front of Alan and Wong. Alan then shoots Foxy in the chest, although a [[Lighter|cigar lighter]] he placed in his chest pocket earlier prevents the shot from being lethal. Foxy finds Tequila at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong's armory is hidden in a vault beneath a nearby hospital. As Tequila takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong discovers that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill him, then discreetly sends Mad Dog to monitor Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts Tequila, demanding to know the whereabouts of the vault. While the two are distracted, Foxy is killed by Mad Dog.\n\nAlan and Tequila discover a hidden passage in the hospital leading to Wong's vault where they get into a gunfight with Mad Dog. As more police and gangsters arrive, Wong has several patients taken hostage. Mad Dog requests the hostages be released, but Wong refuses. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and Tequila manage to save the hostages; Pang evacuates the lobby while officer Teresa Chang goes to the maternity ward to evacuate the babies. As Alan and Tequila continue fighting through the hospital, the duo eventually confront Mad Dog once again. While Tequila leaves to assist Chang with the babies, Alan and Mad Dog get into a tense shootout, before finding themselves in a standoff amidst several patients and staff. They offer the group safe passage, but Wong shoots at the group in a bid to kill Alan. Angered, Mad Dog turns on Wong, but finds himself out of ammo. Wong kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.\n\nTequila manages to meet up with Alan, and the two are confronted by Wong, who sets off bombs within the building. Alan refuses to escape, choosing to pursue Wong, while Tequila jumps out of the hospital with wire cables as it explodes. Wong drags Alan outside at gunpoint as a hostage and has Tequila humiliate himself. With this distraction, Alan manages to grab Wong's pistol and shoot himself, giving Tequila the opportunity to shoot Wong dead, however Alan collapses from the aftermath.\n\nAlan is revealed to have survived the ordeal. To protect Alan from the triads, Pang and Tequila destroy Alan's personnel file and declare him dead, allowing him to leave Hong Kong to start a new life.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:AnthonyWong08TIFF.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Anthony Wong, who portrayed triad boss Johnny Wong]]\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as [[Tequila Yuen|Inspector \"Tequila\" Yuen Ho-yan]]: A [[clarinet]]-playing, alcoholic police sergeant with a reputation for defying his superiors and bending police rules.

This led to Woo having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop.<ref name=\"WooDD\" />\n\nBefore production started, Woo told his actors that he was not going to make the film as stylish as his previous films, but to have it be more of an \"edgy thriller\".<ref name=\"commDD\" /> The role of Teresa Chang was originally made for actress [[Michelle Yeoh]], who had a long relationship with producer [[Terence Chang]].<ref name=\"commDD\" /> After casting [[Teresa Mo]], the character of Teresa Chang was greatly re-written.<ref name=\"commDD\" />\nThe film's initial story was about [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]]'s character being a psychopath who would poison baby food.<ref name=\"WooDD\" /> When [[Terence Chang]] was making connections to have Woo make films in the United States, Chang found people uninterested and disgusted with the theme of babies being poisoned. This halted production for a month to develop a new story.<ref name=\"commFox\" /><ref name=\"ChangDD\" /> Screenwriter [[Barry Wong]] was brought in to write a new story about Tony Leung's character being an undercover police officer.

Woo saw the staircase in the tea house, and thought about a scene where a character would come shooting down gun smugglers while sliding down the banister.<ref name=\"WooDD\" /> The tea house sequence was shot in around a week's time and was choreographed by Woo and [[Philip Kwok]].<ref name=\"commFox\" /><ref name=\"ChangDD\" /><ref name=\"KwokDD\" /> It was shot with interruptions from many local triads in the area asking for protection money, and residents complaining about the noise.<ref name=\"commFox\" /><ref name=\"ChangDD\" />\n[[File:John Woo Cannes 2005.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A photo of a Chinese man wearing a black suit against an orange backdrop.|Director John Woo acted in ''Hard Boiled'' as a bartender who would give Chow Yun-fat's character advice. Woo's character was developed after filming had already started.]]\nThe script of the film went through several changes during filming. Due to the length of the film, scenes from a side-story involving the relationship between the character Tequila and Teresa Chang were cut.<ref name=\"ChangDD\" /> Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny's grave.<ref name=\"commDD\" /> With these cuts, Chow Yun-fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to insert a mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play; Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes.<ref name=\"ChangDD\" /> Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set.

After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad Dog for him.<ref name=\"WooDD\" /><ref name=\"commDD\" />\n\nThe scenes shot at the Hospital maternity ward and the warehouse were shot at a new studio called \"The Coca-Cola Factory\" which was formerly a Coke bottling plant.<ref name=\"ChangDD\" /><ref name=\"Heard101\">Heard, 1999. p.101</ref> The hospital scenes took 40 days to shoot.<ref name=\"Fang44\">Fang, 2004. p.44</ref> The hospital segment's location was chosen since they wanted to have an atypical location where gangs would hide their weapons.<ref name=\"ChangDD\" /> While filming in the hospital, the windows were covered with blast shields to give the appearance of night time, which allowed the crew to film at any time during the day. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the hospital for days often losing track of the time of day.<ref name=\"WooDD\" /> After long hours of filming in the hospital, the crew became exhausted. This led to having the last scene be one long five-minute scene of action to shorten the time needed to film. To complete this, during the scene when two characters go into an elevator to talk for twenty seconds, the crew changes the scene entirely and sets up the explosions for the scene to continue seamlessly.<ref name=\"WooDD\" /> An accident occurred while filming the hospital sequence. Real glass was used and pieces of it flew toward Tony Leung and got into his eyes. Leung was sent to the hospital and after a week's rest, he returned to the set.<ref name=\"WooDD\" /> Woo changed the ending of ''Hard Boiled'' after many members of the crew of the film felt that Leung's character should survive at the film's end.<ref name=\"WooDD\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nWoo is a fan of jazz music and wanted this style for the soundtrack of ''Hard Boiled''.<ref name=\"WooDD\" /> Woo had also previously wanted a singer to perform a jazz song and have Chow Yun-fat's character play saxophone in his previous film ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]''.<ref name=\"Heard78\">Heard, 1999. p.78</ref> The producer for ''The Killer'', [[Tsui Hark]], rejected this idea for ''The Killer'', feeling that Hong Kong audiences didn't enjoy and understand jazz music.<ref name=\"Heard78\" /> The score heard in ''Hard Boiled'' was created by jazz musician [[Michael Gibbs (composer)|Michael Gibbs]]. During promotional screenings, the score for the film was different and was described as \"very haunting music\". This score could not be used as the production crew could not get the rights to the music.<ref name=\"commDD\" /> Other songs featured in the film, include \"[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]\" by [[Lionel Richie]] and the traditional song \"[[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]\".<ref name=\"commDD\" /> Woo chose these songs specifically for their lyrics to suggest that Tony was a sort of pen pal to Teresa.<ref>Hall, 1999. p.164</ref> All the characters in ''Hard Boiled'' had their voices dubbed by their own actors to save money. Woo stated this was convenient as he did not have to worry about setting up boom mics and other sound elements.<ref name=\"commFox\" />\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Theatrical run ===\n''Hard Boiled'' was released on 16 April 1992 in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"hkfa\" /> The film grossed HK$19,711,048 which was not as strong of a box office reception as Woo's previous action films ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' or ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]''.<ref name=\"WooDD\" /><ref name=\"commDD\" /><ref name=\"hkfa\">{{cite web|url=http://ipac.hkfa.lcsd.gov.hk/ipac/cclib/search/showBib.jsp?f=e&id=65537712064005|title=Hong Kong Film Archive|access-date=4 September 2014}}</ref> On the film's initial release in Hong Kong it debuted at number 3 in the box office where it was beaten by [[Tsui Hark]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in China 2]]'' and the [[Stephen Chow]] film ''[[Fight Back to School II]]''.<ref name=\"ss-review\">{{cite journal|title=Hard Boiled|last=Rayns|first=Tony|author-link=Tony Rayns|journal=[[Sight & Sound]]|location=London|volume=2|issue=4|date=August 1992|pages=20\u201323}}</ref>\n\nThe North American premiere of ''Hard Boiled'' was in September 1992 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Heard105\">Heard, 1999. p.105</ref> At the premiere, the audience response was very positive with people stomping their feet and yelling at the screen.
