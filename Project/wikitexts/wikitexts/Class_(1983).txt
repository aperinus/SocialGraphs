In addition to being Lowe's second film (released four months after ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]''), it marked the film debuts of [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[John Cusack]], [[Virginia Madsen]] and [[Casey Siemaszko]].\n\n==Plot==\nUpon first arriving at prep school, Jonathan Ogner is mocked for wearing his school uniform. Then, going up to his dorm he meets his roommate, who introduces himself as Squire Franklin Burroughs IV but tells him to call him \"Skip\". Skip then takes off his bath robe, revealing a red bra and panties, then explains to the shocked Jonathan that it is tradition for seniors to parade around campus wearing only girls' underwear.\n\nJonathan doesn't have any, so Skip gives him a set from his dresser. They head out of the dorm together until they get to the final door where Skip stays behind and locks the door. The other students begin to laugh and mock Jonathan for wearing girls' underwear. Mortified, Jonathan tries to get back inside. After discovering all the doors are locked, he climbs a trellis leading into his room where he finds Skip rolling on the floor laughing.\n\nSkip tries to tell Jonathan it was just a practical joke and to just laugh it off, but Jonathan is too embarrassed. Later, during lunchtime in the cafeteria, the other students again taunt Jonathan as he tries to eat. When Skip invites him over to his table to sit with him and his friends, Jonathan turns to reveal that he is crying. Skip is now deeply remorseful for pulling the prank on Jonathan as he flees the cafeteria.\n\nWhen Skip returns to their room to apologize to Jonathan, he finds him hanging with a rope around his neck in an apparent suicide. Going to get help, on his return to the room, Skip and the gathering crowd find not Jonathan but a mannequin with a picture of the dean's face attached to its head. The crowd begins to crack up hysterically at Skip as the dean says he wants to see him and Jonathan in his office. As the crowd disperses, Skip finds Jonathan very much alive and laughing hysterically in the closet. He grudgingly accepts the prank reversal and they become fast friends. Afterwards they share secrets, and Jonathan confesses he cheated on the [[SAT]].\n\nAfter several failed attempts to find Jonathan a date, Skip vows to help him have a successful sexual encounter. He sends Jonathan to Chicago to gain sexual experience before their reputations are ruined. He is picked up by Ellen, a beautiful older woman, and begins an affair with her. He begins to fall in love with her, although she considers it to be just a fling. Jonathan lied, claiming to be a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student. When he proclaims his love to Ellen during one of their sessions, she begins to have second thoughts about continuing. Her decision is finalized when she discovers Jonathan is both much younger than he had claimed, but he also attends the same school as her son.\n\nOver [[Christmas]] break, Skip invites Jonathan to spend Christmas with him and his family at the Burroughs estate. Here, Jonathan discovers that Ellen is Skip's [[MILF (slang)|mother]] and is married. He tries to end the affair, but she contacts him several times. Eventually, he agrees to meet to talk. Lying to Skip, he claims to need time alone. When Jonathan and Ellen meet, they end up in bed again. Attempting to cheer up his friend, Skip and friends go to the hotel room. There they discover Jonathan in bed with Skip's mother, upsetting Skip. Later, the friends have a fist fight, but finally reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone and closing \"Co-starring\" credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Rob Lowe]] as Skip\n* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as Ellen\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Jonathan\n* [[Stuart Margolin]] as Balaban\n* [[Cliff Robertson]] as Mr. Burroughs\n* [[John Cusack]] as Roscoe\n* Rodney Pearson<!--- not the redirect to Alaska Airlines Flight 261 ---> as Allen\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Roger\n* Remak Ramsey as Kennedy\n* [[Casey Siemaszko]] as Doug\n* [[Joan Cusack]] as Julia\n* [[Virginia Madsen]] as Lisa\n* Aaron Douglas<!--- not the link to actor born 1971 ---> as Barry\n}}\n\n==Production==\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in [[Chicago]] and the surrounding area between September and November 1982.

These included a scene at the end where her son visited her in a mental hospital. \"When you're in a comedy ... It's always difficult to develop a character because they always cut for comedy, the comic effect. I lost a couple of scenes that would have explained my character better. She was more interesting in the original script. Why does she do what she does? She's a very unhappy woman. She doesn't have any relationship at home. Cliff tells her in the bedroom that she's a Burrows and as long as she's a Burrows she must behave. That's not much of a relationship to have with your husband. So she's a bit off balance, greatly in need of a childlike component in her life. She's been completely buckled down by Cliff. There's absolutely no fantasy aspect to her life. She's condemned to being an adult... The director sees it much more as a rites-of-passage film\", Bisset said.<ref>{{cite news| title=MOVIES: What comes after 'Class'?
