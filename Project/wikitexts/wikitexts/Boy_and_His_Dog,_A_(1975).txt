Q. Jones|L.Q. Jones]], from a screenplay by Jones based on the 1969 [[A Boy and His Dog|novella of the same title]] by fantasy author [[Harlan Ellison]]. The film stars [[Don Johnson]], [[Susanne Benton]], [[Alvy Moore]], and [[Jason Robards]]. It was independently produced and distributed by Jones' company LQ/Jaf Productions.\n\nThe film's storyline concerns a teenage boy, Vic, and his [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[dog]], Blood, who work together as a team in order to survive in the dangerous [[Post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] wasteland of the [[Southwestern United States]].\n\n[[Shout! Factory]] released the film on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in August 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/9215/boy_dog_1975.html|title=Blu-ray Review: A Boy and his Dog &#124; High-Def Digest|publisher=Bluray.highdefdigest.com|access-date=19 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the post-nuclear war America of 2024, Vic ([[Don Johnson]]) is an 18-year-old boy, born in and scavenging throughout the wasteland of the former [[southwestern United States]]. Vic is most concerned with food and sex; having lost his parents, he has no formal education and does not understand ethics or morality. He is accompanied by a well-read, misanthropic, [[telepathy|telepathic]] dog named Blood, who helps him find women to [[rape]], in exchange for which Vic finds food for the dog. Blood cannot forage for himself due to the same [[genetic engineering]] that granted him telepathy. The two steal for a living, evading bands of raiders, berserk military [[Android (robot)|android]]s, and mutants. Blood and Vic have an occasionally antagonistic relationship (Blood frequently annoys Vic by calling him \"Albert\" for reasons never made clear), though they realize that they need each other to survive. Blood wishes to find the legendary promised land of \"Over the Hill\" where above-ground [[utopia]]s are said to exist, though Vic believes that they must make the best of what they have.\n\nSearching a [[bunker]] for a woman for Vic to rape, they find one, but she has already been severely mutilated and is on the verge of death. Vic displays no pity. He is merely angered by the \"wastefulness\" of such an act, as well as disgusted by the thought of satisfying his urges with a woman in such a condition. They move on, only to find [[slave trade|slavers]] excavating another bunker. Vic steals several cans of their food, later using them to barter for goods in a nearby [[shanty town]].\n\nThat evening, while watching old vintage [[stag film]]s at a local outdoor \"cinema\", Blood claims to smell a woman, and the pair track her to a large underground warehouse. There, Vic attempts to rape Quilla June Holmes ([[Susanne Benton]]), a scheming and seductive teenage girl from Downunder, a society in a large underground settlement. Unknown to the pair, Quilla June's father, Lou Craddock ([[Jason Robards]]), had sent her above ground to \"recruit\" surface dwellers. Blood takes an instant dislike to her but Vic ignores him. After Vic saves Quilla June from raiders and [[mutants]], they have repeated sex. Eventually, she secretly returns to her underground society. Enticed by the thought of more women and sex, Vic follows her, despite Blood's warnings. Blood remains on the surface at Downunder's portal.\n\nDownunder has an [[Closed ecological system|artificial biosphere]], complete with forests and a city, which is named [[Topeka]] after the ruins of the destroyed city that it lies beneath. The city is ruled by a [[triumvirate]] known as the Committee, who have shaped Topeka into a bizarre caricature of pre-nuclear war America, with all residents wearing [[Whiteface (performance)|whiteface]] and clothes evocative of rural United States prior to [[World War II]]. When Vic is told that he has been brought to Topeka to help fertilize the female population, he is elated to learn of his \"[[stud farm|stud]]\" value. His joy is short-lived, when he is informed that Topeka meets its need for [[Exogamy|exogamous]] reproduction by [[electroejaculation]] and [[artificial insemination]], which will deny him the sexual pleasure that he had envisioned. People who refuse to comply with the Committee are sent off to \"the farm\" and never seen again, as they are violently killed. Vic is informed that when his [[Sperm theft|semen has been used to impregnate 35 women]], he will also be sent to \"the farm\".\n\nQuilla June helps Vic escape only because she wants him to kill the Committee members and destroy their android enforcer, Michael ([[Hal Baylor]]), so that she can usurp their power. Vic has no interest in politics or remaining underground. He only wants to return to Blood and the wasteland. The rebellion is quashed by Michael, who crushes the heads of Quilla June's co-conspirators before Vic disables him. She proclaims her \"love\" for Vic and wants to escape to the surface with him\u2014now that her rebellion has been quashed and the Committee has decreed that ''she'' will be sent to the farm.\n\nOn the surface, Vic and Quilla June discover that Blood is starving and near death. She pleads with Vic to abandon Blood, forcing him to face his true feelings. Vic decides that his loyalties lie with his dog. Off-camera, Vic murders Quilla June and cooks her flesh so that Blood can eat and survive. Blood thanks Vic for the food, and they both comment on Quilla June. Vic says that it was her fault that she followed him, while Blood wryly jokes that she had marvelous judgment but did not have particularly good \"taste\". The boy and his dog continue to talk as they walk off together into the wasteland.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Don Johnson]] as Vic\n* [[Tim McIntire]] as \"Blood\" (voice)\n* [[Susanne Benton]] as Quilla June Holmes\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Lou Craddock\n* [[Alvy Moore]] as Dr. Moore\n* Helene Winston as \"Mez\" Smith\n* [[Charles McGraw]] as Preacher\n* [[Hal Baylor]] as Michael\n* [[Ron Feinberg]] as Fellini\n* [[Michael Rupert]] as Gery\n* Don Carter as Ken\n* Michael Hershman as Richard\n* [[L. Q. Jones]] as Actor In Porno Film\n\n==Production==\n[[Harlan Ellison]] wrote the original novella ''[[A Boy and His Dog]]'' and began an adaptation for film. However, after encountering [[writer's block]], actor/director [[L. Q. Jones|L.Q. Jones]] came onboard to write the script. Jones' own company, LQ/Jaf Productions (L.Q. Jones & Friends), independently produced the film. Distributors initially were reluctant to finance the production, so Jones raised $400,000 through family and business associates.<ref>{{cite web|date=2022|title=A Boy and His Dog|url=https://thenewbev.com/blog/2017/05/a-boy-and-his-dog/|website=[[New Beverly Cinema]]|access-date=February 6, 2022}}</ref> The film was shot at [[Pacific Ocean Park]] in [[Venice, California]], and on location around [[Barstow, California]]<ref name=AFI-details/> and [[Coyote Lake (San Bernardino County, California)|Coyote Dry Lake]] in the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\nIn an interview, Harlan Ellison said: \"When he [Blood] calls Vic 'Al' or 'Albert', he is referring to the [[Albert Payson Terhune]] dog stories, whereas a traditional boy and his dog relationship is turned upside down in this movie\".\n\n[[James Cagney]]'s voice was considered as the voice of Blood, but was dropped because it would have been too recognizable and prove to be a distraction. Eventually, after going through approximately 600 auditions, they settled on [[Tim McIntire]], a veteran voice actor who also did most of the music for the film. [[Ray Manzarek]] (misspelled in the film credits as \"Manzarec\"), formerly of [[The Doors]], was also among those credited for the score.\n\nMcIntire sang the main theme. [[Bolivia]]n composer [[Jaime Mendoza-Nava]] provided the music for the Topeka underground segment.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 78% approval rating based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.

Ellison particularly objected to the film's final line, which did not originate from his original short story, in which Blood said of Quilla, \"Well, I'd say she certainly had marvelous judgement, Albert, if not particularly good taste\". Ellison referred to it as a \"moronic, hateful chauvinist last line, which I despise\".<ref>{{cite web| title=Ellison Webderland Bulletin Board Archives| website= harlanellison.com| publisher= Harlan Ellison | url= http://harlanellison.com/heboard/archive/bull0111.htm|access-date=4 September 2006|first=Harlan|last=Ellison}}</ref><ref>Ellison, Harlan; [[Richard Corben|Corben, Richard]].

Jones, [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] cited the 1975 film adaptation of ''A Boy and His Dog'' as an influence on the ''[[Mad Max]]'' films, particularly ''[[The Road Warrior]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yamato|first1=Jen|title=LQ Jones on A Boy and His Dog: The RT Interview|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/lq-jones-on-a-boy-and-his-dog-the-rt-interview/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|date=February 6, 2008|access-date=30 March 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Sequel===\nThere were rumors regarding a [[sequel]], but it never materialized. On the film's DVD audio commentary, L.Q. Jones states that he had started to write a script sequel to the film that would have picked up where the first film ended and featured a female warrior named Spike, and we would have seen this world through the eyes of a female instead of a male (this happens in Ellison's story, ''Blood's a Rover'', when Blood partners with Spike after the ostensible death of Vic). Jones and Ellison reportedly collaborated on this short-lived effort, although Ellison said that such 'collaboration' never went beyond a short \"what if?\" conversation, and that any efforts were solely that of Jones.\n\nAccording to ''Cult Movies 2'', Jones had a sequel planned called ''A Girl and Her Dog'', but the plan was scrapped when Tiger, the dog who portrayed Blood, died. In a December 2003 interview,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Dec03/lqjones.htm|title=L.Q. Jones|website=Scifidimensions.com|access-date=19 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815154045/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Dec03/lqjones.htm|archive-date=August 15, 2012}}</ref> Jones claimed that he had been repeatedly approached to make a sequel, but funding was always an issue. In 2018, Ellison's teleplay featuring Spike \u2014 the girl in the proposed ''A Girl and Her Dog'' film \u2014 was finally published. ''Blood's a Rover'' by Harlan Ellison (Subterranean Press 2018), a \"fix-up\" novel, consisting of \"Eggsucker\" and \"Run Spot, Run\", two short stories from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as \"A Boy and His Dog\" (Ellison's novella) and an unproduced teleplay from the 1970s, \"Blood's a Rover\", was published in a limited number of hardcovers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1975]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0072730|A Boy and His Dog}}\n* {{YouTube|id=qxeJekzTFjc|title=A Boy and His Dog (1975)}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|ABoyAndHisDog1975FullHD}}\n\n{{Harlan Ellison}}\n{{Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation 1958\u20131980|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boy And His Dog, A}}\n[[Category:1975 films]]\n[[Category:1970s teen films]]\n[[Category:1970s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1975 independent films]]\n[[Category:1970s comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films set in deserts]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction thriller films]]\n[[Category:American dystopian films]]\n[[Category:Films about dogs]]\n[[Category:Films about rape]]\n[[Category:Films based on science fiction short stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2024]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation winning works]]\n[[Category:American post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:First Run Features films]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by Harlan Ellison]]\n[[Category:American survival films]]\n[[Category:Films about cannibalism]]\n[[Category:1975 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1970s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1970s American films]]"}]}}}}
