The narrative follows a [[New Orleans]] [[hospice]] nurse who begins a job at a [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]] plantation home, and becomes entangled in a supernatural mystery involving the house, its former inhabitants, and [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] rituals and spells that took place there.\n\n== Plot ==\nCaroline Ellis, a [[hospice]] aide, quits her position at a nursing home and is hired as the caretaker of an isolated plantation house in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana]]. The aging matron of the house, Violet Devereaux, needs help looking after her husband Benjamin, who was mostly paralyzed by an apparent [[stroke]]. At the insistence of the family's estate lawyer, Luke Marshall, Caroline accepts the position.\n\nAfter Ben attempts to escape his room during a storm, Caroline investigates the house's attic, where Violet said Ben suffered his stroke; she uses a [[skeleton key]] which Violet gave her. She discovers a secret room filled with ritual [[paraphernalia]]. Caroline confronts Violet, who reveals that the room used to belong to two [[African Americans|African American]] servants who were employed at the house 90 years before. The servants, Mama Cecile and Papa Justify, were renowned [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] practitioners; they were [[lynching|lynched]] after conducting a ritual with the owners' two children, from whom Violet and Ben later bought the house. Violet tells Caroline that they keep no mirrors in the house because they see reflections of Cecile and Justify in them. Caroline borrows a phonograph record from the attic: ''Conjure of Sacrifice,'' a recording of Papa Justify reciting a hoodoo ritual.\n\nCaroline surmises that Ben's stroke was caused by hoodoo, but believes that his paralytic state is a [[nocebo|nocebo effect]] induced by his own belief, rather than something supernatural. Taking advice from her friend Jill, Caroline visits a hidden hoodoo shop in a nearby laundromat, where a hoodoo woman gives her tools and instructions to cure Ben. After she conducts the ritual, Ben regains some ability to move and speak and he begs Caroline to get him away from Violet.\n\nCaroline tells Luke she is suspicious of Violet, but he remains skeptical. They travel to a gas station that Caroline previously noted was lined with brick dust, which she was told is a hoodoo defense; supposedly, no one who means one harm can pass a line of brick dust. She asks one of the proprietors, a blind woman, about the ''Conjure of Sacrifice'', which she learns is a spell wherein the caster steals the remaining years of life from the victim. Increasingly convinced of hoodoo's authenticity, Caroline fears that Violet will soon cast the spell on Ben.\n\nCaroline discovers that Violet is unable to pass a line of brick dust laid across one of the house's doorways, confirming her suspicions. She incapacitates Violet and attempts to escape the house with Ben, but the front gate is chained shut. Caroline hides Ben on the property and enters Luke's office for help. Luke, revealed to be Violet's accomplice, brings Caroline back to the house. Caroline escapes, gets into a fight with Violet, and violently pushes her down the stairs, breaking her legs in the process. With strategic use of brick dust, Caroline flees to the attic, calls [[9-1-1]] and Jill for help, and casts what she believes is a protective spell. Violet, having caught up with her, reveals she actually trapped herself inside a protective circle. Violet pushes a full-length mirror at Caroline, which reflects the original owner's daughter, then Violet, and lastly Mama Cecile. A recording of the ''Conjure of Sacrifice'' plays, and the two [[body swap|switch bodies]].\n\nViolet (revealed to be Mama Cecile, who had been occupying Violet's body through the Conjure) wakes up in Caroline's body, and force-feeds Caroline (now in Violet's body) a potion that induces a stroke-like paralytic state like Ben's. Luke (actually Papa Justify) arrives upstairs, revealing that Mama Cecile and Papa Justify have been conducting the Conjure of Sacrifice on new people since their supposed deaths; they had swapped places with the two children just before the lynching. Because hoodoo is supposedly only effective on those who believe in it, Cecile and Justify had to wait for Caroline to come to believe in hoodoo through her own investigation.\n\nEmergency services arrive the next morning and take Caroline and Luke away, trapped in the paralyzed dying bodies of Violet and Ben; when Jill arrives, \"Luke\" tells her that the Devereauxes left the house to Caroline, ensuring that Cecile and Justify will continue to occupy the house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Kate Hudson]] as Caroline Ellis\n*[[Gena Rowlands]] as Violet Devereaux\n*[[John Hurt]] as Benjamin \"Ben\" Devereaux\n*[[Peter Sarsgaard]] as Luke Marshall\n*[[Joy Bryant]] as Jill Dupay\n*Ronald McCall as Papa Justify\n*[[Jeryl Prescott]] as Mama Cecile\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Skeleton Key'' was filmed at the [[Felicity Plantation]], located on the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Saint James Parish, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/tv/index.ssf/2016/06/where_was_the_roots_remake_fil.html|title=Where was the 'Roots' remake filmed?|last=Scott|first=Mike|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=June 8, 2016|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''The Skeleton Key'' was released in the U.S. on August 12, 2005, after having received an earlier release date of July 29, 2005 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=bradshaw/> It grossed $92 million worldwide.<ref name=\"box office\"/> In the U.S., it took in $16.1 million in its first weekend, reaching number 2 at the box office; the total US gross was $47.9 million.<ref name=\"box office\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 38% of 149 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.3/10.
