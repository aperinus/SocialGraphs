It is loosely based on events that took place after the [[Malmedy massacre]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. The film stars [[Corbin Allred]], [[Alexander Polinsky|Alexander Niver]], [[Larry Bagby|Lawrence Bagby]] and [[Peter Holden|Peter Asle Holden]] as the four American soldiers trying to return a British soldier with vital intelligence to the Allied lines.\n\nAfter conducting research on World War II and Battle of the Bulge, Little began shooting in January 2003 in Utah. Filming lasted 30 days. Little and Abel were able to save money on production by recruiting a group of World War II reenactors who volunteered their services, costumes, and props. Excel Entertainment released the film at festivals to garner publicity before it was released to the public. The movie won numerous Best Picture awards from over 15 film festivals.\n\nCritical reception was generally positive with praise towards the message, story, performances (particularly of Allred and Niver), production values and action sequences. Though the screenplay, pacing and ties to Mormonism were criticized by some reviewers, several film scholars argued that despite the LDS-related themes, the film appeals to a wide audience. The film generated two sequels: ''[[Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed]]'' and ''[[Saints and Soldiers: The Void]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, the Germans open fire on their American prisoners of war, in what is known as the [[Malmedy massacre]], killing many troops as they try to run away. Medic Steven Gould ([[Alexander Polinsky|Alexander Niver]]) manages to escape with Corporal Nathan 'Deacon' Greer ([[Corbin Allred]]). Gould and Deacon are joined by two other survivors, Shirl Kendrick ([[Larry Bagby]]), a member in Gould's division, and Deacon's close friend Sergeant Gordon Gunderson ([[Peter Holden|Peter Asle Holden]]). The four stumble on [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot [[Flight Sergeant]] Oberon Winley ([[Kirby Heyborne]]). Winley explains he has important [[military intelligence|intelligence]] he has to get back to the Allies and the group decide to try and reach the Allied lines, located some {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} away. The group fights against German troops, a winter storm, and personal conflict to return Winley to Allied territory.<ref>{{Citation|title=Saints and Soldiers (2003) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373283/plotsummary|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Corbin Allred]] as Corporal Nathan \"Deacon\" Greer\n* [[Alexander Polinsky|Alexander Niver]] as Private Steven Gould\n* [[Kirby Heyborne]] as Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley\n* [[Larry Bagby]] as Private Shirley \"Shirl\" Kendrick\n* [[Peter Holden|Peter Asle Holden]] as Staff Sergeant Gordon \"Gundy\" Gunderson\n* Ethan Vincent as Rudolph Gertz\n* Melinda Renee as Catherine Theary &ndash; Belgian woman\n* Ruby Chase O'Neil as Sophie Theary &ndash; Catherine's daughter\n* Lincoln Hoppe as German soldier\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nRyan Little's first project was short film ''The Last Good War'', which won a Student Emmy.

They researched World War II events and interviewed World War II veterans to develop the story and characters.<ref name=\"uphill\" />\n\nLittle and Abel quickly cast [[Corbin Allred]] and [[Kirby Heyborne]]. However, because Heyborne has appeared in many other LDS Church related movie roles, they instructed Heyborne to grow a mustache, dye his hair, use a British accent, and smoke during the movie. Because Heyborne did not smoke, he smoked herbal cigarettes in the movie and practiced dragging daily for a few weeks before filming. Additionally, Heyborne did not have access to a dialect coach so he became familiar with British accents by watching other films. Heyborne was concerned that this would make him a target for film critics.<ref name=\"uphill\" /> To save on costs, Little and Abel used World War II reenactors as actors who volunteered to travel to Utah and bring their World War II prop equipment at their own expense.<ref name=\"uphill\" />\n\nThe film was shot in early 2003 in 30 days in [[Utah County, Utah|Utah]], [[Wasatch County, Utah|Wasatch]], and [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake]] counties in Utah.
