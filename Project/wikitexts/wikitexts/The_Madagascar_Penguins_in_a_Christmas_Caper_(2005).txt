It was directed by animation veteran [[Gary Trousdale]], produced by [[Teresa Cheng]], and written by Michael Lachance.\n\n==Plot==\nFocusing on the ''Madagascar'' penguins and taking place before the events of the first ''Madagascar'', the youngest penguin on the team, Private, slips out of the zoo on [[Christmas Eve]] to find a present for a lonely [[polar bear]] named Ted. While roaming the streets of [[Manhattan]], he is captured by Nana (the aggressive elderly lady from the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]] and [[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa|second film]]) who mistakes him for a [[chew toy]] for her vicious [[dog]], Mr Chew. The other three penguins, Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico, rescue Private from Nana's apartment before it is too late. They escalate into chaos against Mr. Chew, all-the-while, not noticed by Nana, who is occupied watching a [[American football|football]] game. When they are done, they detonate the door with a stick of [[dynamite]] (which Rico had repeatedly attempted to use prior), finally attracting Nana's attention and leaving Mr. Chew to take the fall for what the penguins have done to her place.\n\nAt the end of the film they invite Ted to their home. But he has already invited several other guests, resulting in a massive sing-a-long to a parody of [[Jingle Bells]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski.\n*[[John DiMaggio]] as Rico.\n*[[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper.\n*[[Elisa Gabrielli]] as Nana.\n*[[Christopher Knights]] as Private.\n*Hope Levy as an Additional Voice\n*[[Rif Hutton]] as an Additional Voice.\n*Richard Miro as an Additional Voice.\n*Mitch Carter as an Additional Voice.\n*Lynnanne Zager as an Additional Voice.\n*[[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Ted the [[polar bear]].\n*Sean Bishop as the Doorman/TV Announcer.\n*[[Frank Welker]] as Mr. Chew.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe original music for the short was composed by [[James Dooley (composer)|James Dooley]].
