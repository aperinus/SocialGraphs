The story centres on a [[bounty hunter]] hired to retrieve his ex-wife, who has skipped bail. The film was released in the United States on March 19, 2010.<ref>[http://hollywood-movies-coming-soon.blogspot.com/2010/03/bounty-hunter.html Trailer and Preview of 'The Bounty Hunter']</ref> The film was panned by critics but was a box office success, grossing $136.3 million against a production budget of $40\u201345 million.\n\n==Plot==\nMilo Boyd, a former [[New York Police Department]] detective is now a [[bounty hunter]].  His ex-wife, Nicole Hurley, is an investigative reporter who has been arrested for [[assault]]ing a police officer.\n\nNicole receives a tip on a story, an apparent [[suicide]] that may have been a [[murder]], she skips her [[Bail|bond hearing]] to meet her informant, causing the judge to revoke her [[bail]] and issue a warrant for her arrest. Just before Nicole arrives, her informant, Jimmy is kidnapped.\n\nMilo is [[ecstatic]] when Nicole's [[bail bondsman]], Sid, offers him the job of bringing her to jail, for a bounty of $5,000. Nicole's mother Kitty inadvertently helps him find her at a race track in [[New Jersey]]. He throws her into his trunk and drives back towards [[Manhattan]]. Nicole escapes briefly before he catches up with her.\n\nThey are being stalked: Milo by two thugs sent by his [[bookie]] Irene, because of his gambling debts, Nicole by corrupt cop Earl Mahler, who is connected with the story she is investigating, and both by Nicole's lovestruck coworker Stewart, bent on rescuing her from Milo. Irene's thugs confuse Stewart for Milo and mistakenly kidnap him.\n\nEarl tries to kill Nicole, but both Milo and Nicole narrowly escape. Milo is not interested in explanations until she tells him she's found evidence that implicates their mutual friend and Milo's ex-partner on the force, Bobby, indicating that he is involved with Earl. Milo decides to investigate with her.\n\nClues from Earl's car lead them to a country club, where they learn from a [[caddie]] that Earl owns a [[tattoo parlor]] in Queens, so they start to make their way there. Bobby warns them to stay off the road.\n\nThe nearest hotel is the [[bed and breakfast]] where they spent their [[honeymoon]]. They discover they still have feelings for each other and admit their mistakes. Coming out of the bathroom, Nicole overhears Milo telling Sid he may sleep with her, but he's still taking her to jail. She handcuffs him to the bed and goes to the [[tattoo]] parlor, finding Jimmy and freeing him before being captured by Irene's thugs.\n\nMilo rescues Nicole at a [[strip club]]. Then, they hear Bobby is heading to the police's evidence warehouse, which is being relocated to a new building. Bobby confronts Earl, a former friend who has used Bobby's name to gain access to the warehouse and steal a large amount of narcotics and cash. Bobby decides to arrest him, but Earl shoots him. Milo and Nicole enter the warehouse and Milo is ambushed, but Earl surrenders when Nicole points a shotgun at him.\n\nBobby explains Earl was using him, as well as the man who supposedly committed suicide, to gain access to the warehouse. There was no proof, so Bobby was waiting for Earl to make his move before arresting him. Milo proudly notes that Earl might have gotten away with it if Nicole hadn't picked up clues. He and Nicole appear to have reconciled. They concede that sometimes their jobs have to come first. Milo turns Nicole in to the police, so she can make her court hearing the next day.\n\nOn his way out of the precinct, Milo runs into a cop who insulted him earlier and punches him in the face. He is arrested and put in the cell next to Nicole's. He reminds her that it is their [[anniversary]] and they have to spend it together. Through the bars they admit their love and kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Nicole Hurley (previously Boyd), a ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' reporter, and Milo's ex-wife.\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Milo Boyd, a bounty hunter, former police officer, and Nicole's ex-husband.\n* [[Jason Sudeikis]] as Stewart, Nicole's co-worker who has unrequited feelings for her.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Sid, Milo's friend, and employer as a bail bondsman.\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Irene, a gift shop owner, and local bookmaker.\n* [[Ritchie Coster]] as Ray, one of Irene's employees.\n* Joel Marsh Garland as Dwight, one of Irene's employees.\n* [[Siobhan Fallon Hogan]] as Teresa, the secretary of Sid's business.\n* [[Peter Greene]] as Earl Mahler, a cop.\n* [[Dorian Missick]] as Bobby Jenkins, [[NYPD]] detective and Milo's best friend.\n* [[Carol Kane]] as Dawn, a co-owner of a bed and breakfast.\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as Edmund, a co-owner of a bed and breakfast.\n* Adam Rose as Jimmy, a bartender.\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Kitty Hurley, Nicole's mother.\n* [[Matt Malloy]] as Gary, a co-worker of Nicole's.\n* [[Christian Borle]] as Caddie.\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2007, it was announced Columbia acquired the then untitled bounty hunter pitch for Development with Original Film.<ref name=\"Pitch\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/columbia-picks-up-thorp-pitch-1117965684/|title=    Columbia picks up Thorp pitch    |publisher=Variety|access-date=July 7, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''The Bounty Hunter'' was released alongside ''[[Repo Men]]'' and ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2010 film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''.
