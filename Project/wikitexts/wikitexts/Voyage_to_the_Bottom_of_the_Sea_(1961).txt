The supporting cast includes [[Peter Lorre]], [[Joan Fontaine]], [[Barbara Eden]], [[Michael Ansara]], and [[Frankie Avalon]]. The film's storyline was written by Irwin Allen and [[Charles Bennett (screenwriter)|Charles Bennett]]. The opening title credits [[Theme music|theme song]] was sung by Avalon. The film was distributed by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe new, state-of-the-art [[nuclear submarine]], ''[[USOS Seaview|Seaview]]'', is on diving trials in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. ''Seaview'' is designed and built by scientist and engineering genius [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Harriman Nelson]] (USN-Ret). [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Lee Crane  is the submarine's [[Commanding Officer]]. One of the on-board observers is Dr. Susan Hiller, studying crew-related stress. The mission includes being out of radio contact for 96 hours while under the Arctic ice cap. The polar ice suddenly begins to crack and melt, with boulder-size pieces crashing into the ocean around the submerged submarine; surfacing, they discover the sky is on fire. After rescuing scientist Miguel Alvarez and his dog at Ice Floe Delta, ''Seaview'' receives a radio message from Mission Director Inspector Bergan at the Bureau of Marine Exploration. He reports that a meteor shower has pierced the [[Van Allen radiation belt]], causing it to catch on fire, resulting in a deadly increase in the global temperature. Nelson's on-board friend and scientist, retired [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] Lucius Emery, concurs it is possible.\n\nThe President summons Admiral Nelson to a UN Emergency Scientific meeting. Nelson and Commodore Emery have devised a plan to end the catastrophe. ''Seaview'' arrives in New York Harbor two days later. Nelson informs the UN that, according to their calculations, if the increasing temperature is not stopped, it will become irreversible and the Earth will die in about three weeks. The Admiral and the Commander propose extinguishing the fire by launching a nuclear missile at the burning belt from the [[Mariana Islands]]. A nuclear explosion should overwhelm and extinguish the flames, \"amputating\" the belt from the Earth. ''Seaview'' has the capability of firing the missile. The chief scientist and head delegate, [[Vienna]]'s Emilio Zucco rejects the Admiral's plan as too risky. He believes the composition of the belt's gasses will cause the fire to soon burn itself out when reaching 173 degrees. Nelson disagrees with Zucco's theory, claiming that his estimated burn-out point is incorrect. Nelson and Emery's plan is rejected. The Admiral and the Commodore quickly leave the proceedings intending to get authorization directly from the President himself.\n\nThe ''Seaview'' races to reach the optimal firing position above the Pacific Ocean's [[Marianas trench]] in time for the needed angle of trajectory. Nelson and Crane attempt tapping the Rio-to-London telephone cable in an attempt to reach the President. During the cable tapping attempt, Crane and Alvarez battle a [[giant squid]]. They can only tap into the London cable, and Nelson learns there has been no contact with the U.S. for 35 hours.\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt on the Admiral's life indicates a saboteur is aboard. The rescued scientist, Miguel Alvarez, a religious zealot regarding the catastrophe, is the suspected saboteur. Dr. Hiller, who privately supports Dr Zucco's plan, is another suspect.\n\nOther obstacles present themselves. The ''Seaview's'' main generator is sabotaged by a crew member who lost his mind, forcing Nelson to order Crane to proceed while repairs are made despite the risk of proceeding without power for the sonar and radar. As a result, the sub narrowly escapes a [[Naval mine|minefield]] left over from World War II. The crew are near-mutiny, to the point that when the ''Seaview'' encounters a motor ship whose crew is dead, Captain Crane and the Admiral allow any crew members who wish to leave rather than continue the mission to leave the sub and sail the derelict home.\n\nCrane begins doubting the Admiral's tactics and reasoning.  A hostile, unidentified submarine pursues them, diving deep into the Mariana Trench, exceeding its [[crush depth]]; the sub implodes before it can destroy ''Seaview''.\n\nThe saboteur has shut down the sub's power. Crane encounters Dr Hiller, the saboteur, atop the shark tank, as she exits the restricted nuclear reactor core. Her radiation detector badge has turned red, showing she has been exposed to a fatal dose. When asked why, she says to prevent the sub from reaching its target. Suddenly an explosion rocks the sub, throwing Dr. Hiller into the shark tank. She is killed by the sharks.\n\n''Seaview'' reaches the Mariana Islands in time to carry out the Admiral's plan. He learns that temperatures are rising faster than projected, proving Zucco's theory is incorrect. Alvarez, believing it is God's will for the Earth to be destroyed, attempts to sabotage the mission by threatening to explode a bomb. The nuclear missile is launched toward the belt by Captain Crane, who launches the nuclear missile from outside the sub before Alvarez is aware. It explodes in the Van Allen Belt as intended, driving the burning flames away from the Earth and saving humanity.\n\nAs the sky returns to its normal blue color, ''Seaview'' turns for home, her mission completed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Walter Pidgeon]] as Admiral [[Harriman Nelson]]\n* [[Joan Fontaine]] as Dr. Susan Hiller\n* [[Barbara Eden]] as [[Lieutenant Junior Grade|Lieutenant (JG)]] Cathy Connors\n* [[Peter Lorre]] as Commodore Lucius Emery\n* [[Robert Sterling]] as Captain Lee Crane\n* [[Michael Ansara]] as Miguel Alvarez\n* [[Frankie Avalon]] as Lieutenant (JG) Danny Romano\n* [[Regis Toomey]] as Dr. Jamieson\n* [[John Litel]] as Vice-Admiral B.J.

Anderson]], steamed under the Arctic ice cap to make the first crossing from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the [[North Pole]]. On August 3, 1958, she became the first vessel to reach the North Pole.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Captain William R.|last2=Keith|first2=Don|title=The Ice Diaries: The Untold Story of the Cold War's Most Daring Mission|location=Nashville|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2008|pages=268\u2013292}}</ref>\n\nFor this accomplishment, ''Nautilus'' and her crew were awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (U.S.)|Presidential Unit Citation]], the first Presidential Unit Citation awarded in peacetime. The citation began with the words, \"For outstanding achievement in completing the first voyage in history across the top of the world, by cruising under the Arctic ice cap from the [[Bering Strait]] to the [[Greenland Sea]]\".{{sfnp|Anderson|Keith|2008|pages =303\u2013304}}\n\n''Nautilus 90 North'' (1959, with [[Clay Blair]]) was the first book Anderson wrote about the Arctic missions of USS ''Nautilus''. It was named for the radio message he sent to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] to announce that ''Nautilus'' had reached the pole. His second book about these missions, ''The Ice Diaries: The Untold Story of the Cold War's Most Daring Mission'' (with Don Keith), was completed shortly before Anderson's death. This second book includes many previously classified details.\n\nOn March 17, 1959, the nuclear submarine {{USS|Skate|SSN-578|6}}, under the command of Commander (later [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]]) [[James F. Calvert]], became the first submarine to surface at the North Pole. While there, her crew scattered the ashes of Arctic explorer Sir [[Hubert Wilkins]].<ref>''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''</ref> Calvert wrote the book ''Surface at the Pole'' about this and the other Arctic missions of USS ''Skate.''\n\nThe film ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' begins with ''Seaview'' in the Arctic for the final phase of her sea trials, including a dive under the ice cap.\n\nTwo milestones in underwater exploration were achieved in 1960, the year before ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' was released. On January 23, 1960, [[Jacques Piccard]] and Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]] (USN), in the [[bathyscaphe Trieste|bathyscaphe ''Trieste'']], made the first descent to the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]]. The Challenger Deep is the deepest surveyed spot in the world's oceans, and is located in the [[Mariana Trench]], southwest of [[Guam]].<ref>\"Navy's Bathyscaphe Dives 7 Miles in Pacific Trench\"; ''The New York Times''; January 24, 1960; page 1</ref> From February 16, 1960, to May 10, 1960, the submarine {{USS|Triton|SSRN-586|6}}, under the command of Captain [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.]], made the [[Operation Sandblast|first submerged circumnavigation of the world]]. ''Triton'' observed and photographed Guam extensively through her [[periscope]] during this mission, without being detected by the U.S. Navy on Guam.<ref>Beach, Captain Edward L.; ''Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton''; Annapolis, Bluejacket Books, Naval Institute Press, 1962 (Bluejacket Books edition 2001); pp. 292, 197\u2013201</ref>\n\nIn the film, ''Seaview'' fires a missile from a position northwest of Guam to extinguish the \"sky fire\".\n\nAt the time that ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' was made, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s had only recently been discovered, and most of what the film's state concerning them is fiction. Discoveries since then clearly invalidate what the film says: the Van Allen belts (actually somewhat more radiation-dense portions of the [[magnetosphere]]) are made up of sub-atomic particles trapped by the Earth's magnetic field in the vacuum of space and cannot catch fire, as fire requires oxygen, fuel, and an ignition source, all of which are insufficient in the Van Allen Belts. Unburned hydrocarbon emissions have never reached concentrations that could support a \"sky fire\".\n\nAt the beginning of the film, pieces of the polar ice cap are sinking, colliding with Seaview. No explanation is given as to why the ice doesn't float.\n\n==The submarine ''Seaview''==\n{{main|USOS Seaview}}\nThe film's submarine [[USOS Seaview#Design|design]] is unique in featuring an eight-window bow viewport that provides panoramic undersea views. In the [[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (novel)|novelization]] by [[Theodore Sturgeon]], the windows are described as \"oversized hull plates which happen to be transparent\". They are made of \"X-tempered herculite\", a process developed by Nelson.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sturgeon|first=Theodore|title=Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea|publisher=Pyramid Books|year=1961|page=10}}</ref> In the film, ''Seaview'' has eight bow windows in the exterior shots, but only four appear in the interior shots showing the lower level Observation Room (the four upper windows are implied to be out of frame, at the top of the Observation Room). The lower hull also has an exterior shark-like bow flare, and the stern has 1961 Cadillac tail-fins. ''Seaview'' is propelled by a water-jet system generally similar to the magnetohydrodynamic system employed by the ''Red October'' in [[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]], though no details are provided in the film.\n\nIn the film, the USOS ''Seaview'' (''United States Oceanographic Survey'') is under the authority of Nelson and the Bureau of Marine Exploration rather than the U.S. Navy. The novel mentions the bureau as being part of the U.S. Department of Science. The crew wears World War II U.S. Army tropical khaki dress uniforms with naval rank insignia on the sleeves, rather than U.S. Navy service dress khaki with shoulder boards. The officers' working uniforms are US Army khaki long with epaulets, black tie, and lapel insignia; however, unlike the U.S. Navy, the Marine Exploration insignia, a specialist insignia, is worn on the right collar point and rank insignia is worn on the left, the reverse of U.S. Navy practice. The crew's working uniform is the U.S. Navy period-correct chambray shirt and dungaree uniform, with the white \"dixie cup\" cap.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garas|first=Daniel|url=https://usnhistory.navylive.dodlive.mil/2016/04/06/the-dixie-cup-an-everyday-icon-and-historic-symbol/ |title=The Dixie Cup: An Everyday Icon and Historic Symbol |website=US Naval History and Heritage Command|date=April 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210320065632/https://usnhistory.navylive.dodlive.mil/2016/04/06/the-dixie-cup-an-everyday-icon-and-historic-symbol/|archive-date=March 20, 2021|url-status=dead}}</ref> Chief petty officers wear the Army khaki uniform with US Navy style chief's rank (less the Navy \"crow\" on top of the rocker) on both sleeves. The effect is that of government service, but not necessarily military service.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was part of an upswing in science fiction and fantasy films of the era, including adaptations of [[Jules Verne]]'s and [[H. G. Wells]]' works.<ref>{{Cite news|title=HOLLYWOOD CYCLE|author=G. H.|date=Mar 26, 1961|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|115380422}}}}</ref>\n\nThe film marked Walter Pidgeon's return to filmmaking after several years working in the theater.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Hopper, H.|title=Walter pidgeon returns to films.|date=Jan 6, 1961|work=Los Angeles Times|id={{ProQuest|167860258}}}}</ref> The role of Captain Crane was originally offered to [[David Hedison]] who played the role in the [[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|1964 television series of the same name]]. Hedison turned the film down after completing Allen's ''[[The Lost World (1960 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1960) saying that he did not like the script.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/interview-david-hedison/ |title = Interview: David Hedison|date = 12 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nSet designer [[Herman A. Blumenthal|Herman Blumenthal]] did not approach the Navy to do research; he relied solely on pictures of naval vessels in the media.<ref>{{Cite news|title=SUBMARINE FILM POSES DEEP STUDY|author=MURRAY SCHUMACH|date=Feb 24, 1961|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|115355235}}}}</ref>\n\nThe theatrical release poster shown above is one of four posters that were produced to promote the film. Each one has different wording and slightly different artwork, and each one promotes the film from a different perspective. The above poster also promotes Sturgeon's novelization.\n\n==Reception==\n''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' was previewed on June 18, 1961. It was released to theaters in early July 1961 and had run its course by late fall (September/October). The film played to mixed reviews from critics, but audiences made the film a popular success. ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' was made for US$2 million and brought in US$7 million at the box office.\n\n==Impact==\nFor the filming of ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'', detailed [[Theatrical scenery|sets]], [[Theatrical property|props]] and [[scale model]]s were created to realize the ''Seaview'' submarine. After the film was completed, the sets were placed in storage. When Irwin Allen decided to make a [[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' television series]], all he had to do was pull the sets out of storage. This was done at a fraction of the cost that he might have had if he had begun from scratch. The film reduced the cost of setting up the show and was the template for the type of stories that were done. The studios, having made the film, helped make the television series easier to produce.\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Television===\nThe success of the [[feature film]] led to the 1964\u20131968 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series, ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]''. During the series run, the film's storyline was remade as a one-hour episode, written by Willam Welch, and titled \"The Sky's on Fire\". Other scenes from the film were also rewritten and incorporated into the television series.\n\n=== Novels ===\nIn June 1961, [[Jove Books|Pyramid Books]] published a [[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (novel)|novelization of the film]] by science fiction writer [[Theodore Sturgeon]]. The book went on to be reprinted several times during the 1960s. One of those reprintings pictures Richard Basehart and David Hedison on the cover, but the book is still based on the Walter Pidgeon film. Collectors who want a novelization of the television series should find ''City Under the Sea''. That novel uses the television characters, but should not be confused with either the television series or the later Irwin Allen film with the same name.\n\nSturgeon's book is based on an early version of the film's script and has the same basic story as the film. It also has a few characters that were not in the film, as well as some additional technical explanation. Some film scenes are different, while some others are wholly absent from the film. Likewise, some film scenes are missing from the book.\n\nThe original 1961 book cover portrays a submarine meeting a fanged sea serpent. This scene is not in the novel or the film. The submarine design on the cover does not match the ''Seaview'' shown in the film or the ''Seaview'' described in the novel: The submarine's bow is opaque, and her \"Observation Room\" is a rearward projection from the base of the conning tower. The basic shape of the ''Seaview'''s hull resembles that of the U.S. Navy's {{USS|Skipjack|SSN-585|6}}, the first American nuclear-powered submarine with an \"[[Teardrop hull|Albacore hull]]\", including its cruciform stern and single-screw [[propeller]].<ref>{{harvp|Sturgeon|1961}}, 1st printing: June 1961, front cover painting, credited to Jim Mitchell on back cover</ref>\n\n===Comics===\nA submarine design very similar to the one used on the 1961 book cover shows up in the 1962 [[Dell Comics]] series, ''Voyage to the Deep'' (with a similar mission to save the world), that was published to capitalize on the film's popularity. The submarine's mission took it to the Mariana Trench to stop the Earth from wobbling out of orbit. Dell later cancelled the title with issue #4.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The submarine was named ''Proteus'', later the name of the submersible seen in the science fiction film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' (1966).\n\nIn 1961, Dell Comics created a full-color adaptation of the ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' film. The comic book was [[Four Color|''Four Color Comics'']] #1230 and was illustrated by [[Sam Glanzman]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/glanzman_sam.htm |title = Sam J. Glanzman}}</ref> It contains a few publicity stills from the film, plus a section on the history of submarines. In this adaptation, the Admiral's first name is Farragut instead of Harriman.\n\n''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine published a TV series parody entitled, \"Voyage to See What's on the Bottom\".\n\n===Other===\nThere is also a family board game, manufactured by GemColor, that is tied to the film and not the television series. The game's product carton uses a photo of a [[wetsuit]]ed scuba diver with the eight-foot shooting miniature of the ''Seaview''.\n\nA ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' coloring book for children was released in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe film has since been released in multiple territories on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of maritime science fiction works]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==Other sources==\n# Tim Colliver, ''Seaview: The Making of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'', 1992, Alpha Control press.\n# ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea'' (VHS)\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb_title|id=0055608}}\n* {{AllMovie title|53041}}\n* {{TCMDb title|id=94930}}\n* {{AFI film|id=19554|title=Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea}}\n* {{mojo title|voyagetothebottomofthesea|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|voyage_to_the_bottom_of_the_sea}}\n* {{YouTube|fBDPOvyZdAg|David Merriman's radio controlled model of the ''Seaview''}}\n* [http://www.vttbots.com/movie_central.html Mike's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea Zone \u2013 the movie.]\n\n{{Irwin Allen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea}}\n[[Category:1961 films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1960s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1960s disaster films]]\n[[Category:1960s adventure drama films]]\n[[Category:American disaster films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Irwin Allen]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:CinemaScope films]]\n[[Category:Sea adventure films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction submarine films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Irwin Allen]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television shows]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Arctic]]\n[[Category:1961 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Paul Sawtell]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
