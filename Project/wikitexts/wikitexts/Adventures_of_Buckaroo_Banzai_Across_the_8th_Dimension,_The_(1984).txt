D. Richter]] and written by [[Earl Mac Rauch]]. It stars [[Peter Weller]] in the titular role, with [[Ellen Barkin]], [[John Lithgow]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], and [[Christopher Lloyd]]. The supporting cast includes [[Lewis Smith (actor)|Lewis Smith]], [[Rosalind Cash]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Pepe Serna]], [[Robert Ito]], [[Vincent Schiavelli]], [[Dan Hedaya]], [[Jonathan Banks]], [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]], [[Carl Lumbly]] and [[Ronald Lacey]].\n\nThe film centers upon the efforts of the [[polymath]] Dr. Buckaroo Banzai, a [[physicist]], [[neurosurgeon]], [[test pilot]], and [[Rock music|rock star]], to save the world by defeating a band of [[Interdimensional being|inter-dimensional]] aliens called Red Lectroids from Planet 10. The film is a cross between the [[action film|action]]-[[adventure film|adventure]] and science fiction film genres and also includes elements of [[comedy film|comedy]] and [[romance film|romance]].\n\nAfter screenwriter W. D. Richter hired novelist Earl Mac Rauch to develop a screenplay of Mac Rauch's new character, Buckaroo Banzai, Richter teamed with producer [[Neil Canton]] to pitch the script to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] studio chief [[David Begelman]], who took it to [[20th Century Fox]] to make the film. Box office figures were low and less than half of the film's production costs were recovered. Some critics were put off by the complicated plot, although [[Pauline Kael]] enjoyed the film and [[Vincent Canby]] called it \"pure, nutty fun.\" ''Buckaroo Banzai'' has been adapted for books, comics, and a video game and has attracted a loyal [[cult following]].\n\n== Plot ==\nBuckaroo Banzai and his mentor Dr. Tohichi Hikita perfect the \"oscillation overthruster\", a device that allows an object to pass through solid matter. Banzai tests it by driving his Jet Car through a mountain. While in transit, he finds himself in another dimension. After exiting the mountain and returning to his normal dimension, he discovers an alien organism has attached itself to his car.\n\nDr. Emilio Lizardo, incarcerated at the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, sees a television news story of Banzai's successful test. In 1938, Drs. Lizardo and Hikita had built a prototype overthruster, but he tested it before it was ready and became stuck between dimensions. He was attacked by aliens until freed by his colleagues, emerging changed and violent. Understanding that Banzai has finally accessed the 8th dimension, Lizardo escapes the asylum and plots to steal the overthruster.\n\nBanzai and his band, \"The Hong Kong Cavaliers\", are performing at a nightclub when Banzai interrupts their musical intro to address a depressed woman in the audience, Penny Priddy. During a song he performs especially for her, she attempts suicide, which is mistaken for an assassination attempt on Banzai. After questioning her at the jail, he realizes she is his late wife, Peggy's, long-lost identical twin sister and bails her out.\n\nLater, during a press conference to discuss his Jet Car experience, the overthruster, and the specimen of alien/transdimensional life he obtained while traversing the 8th dimension, Banzai is called to the phone, where he receives an electrical shock. Simultaneously, strange men disrupt the event and kidnap Hikita. When Banzai returns, his electrical shock enables him to recognize them as humanoid aliens, and he gives chase. He rescues Hikita, and they manage to evade the aliens long enough for the Cavaliers to rescue them.\n\nBanzai and the Cavaliers return to the Banzai Institute, where they are met by John Parker, a messenger from John Emdall, the leader of the peaceful Black Lectroids of Planet 10. Parker delivers a recording from Emdall in which she explains that her people have been at war with the hostile Red Lectroids for years, managing to banish them to the 8th dimension. Lizardo's failed test of the overthruster in 1938 allowed the Red Lectroids' tyrannical leader, Lord John Whorfin, to take over Lizardo's mind and enable several dozen of his allies to escape. Because Banzai has now perfected the overthruster, Emdall fears Whorfin and his allies will try to acquire it to free the other Red Lectroids and tasks Banzai with stopping Whorfin; otherwise, the Black Lectroids will attack Russia from their orbiting ship, triggering a nuclear [[World War III]] that will annihilate the Red Lectroids on Earth as well as humankind.\n\nThe Cavaliers track the Red Lectroids to [[Yoyodyne|Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems]] in New Jersey.  They realize that [[Orson Welles]]'s [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|broadcast of ''The War of the Worlds'']] described the Lectroids' arrival in 1938, though afterward the Lectroids forced him to state it was fictional. Yoyodyne has been building a spacecraft to cross over to the 8th dimension, disguised as a new [[United States Air Force]] bomber. While the Cavaliers are planning their response, Red Lectroids break into the Institute and kidnap Penny, unaware that they have also captured the overthruster, which she was carrying.\n\nAt Yoyodyne, Penny refuses to tell the Red Lectroids where the overthruster is, and they begin torturing her. Banzai enters Yoyodyne headquarters alone; the Cavaliers follow, reinforced by several groups of the Blue Blaze Irregulars, civilians recruited to assist the Cavaliers when necessary. Banzai saves Penny and fights off the Red Lectroids, though she is wounded and unconscious. While the Cavaliers tend to her, Banzai and Parker sneak into a pod on the Yoyodyne spacecraft. Lacking Banzai's overthruster, Whorfin insists they use his imperfect model, which fails to make the dimensional transition; instead, the Red Lectroid spaceship breaks through the Yoyodyne wall and takes off into the atmosphere.\n\nLord Whorfin ejects the pod containing Banzai and Parker from the craft, but they manage to activate it and use its weapon systems to destroy Whorfin and the other Red Lectroids. Banzai parachutes back to Earth while Parker returns to his people in orbit using the pod. With the situation resolved and war averted, Banzai finds Penny has died from her injuries. When he goes to give her a final kiss, Emdall gives Banzai another brief shock, reviving Penny.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Peter Weller]] as Dr. Buckaroo Banzai\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Dr. Emilio Lizardo / Lord John Whorfin\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Penny Priddy / Peggy Banzai\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Dr. Sidney Zweibel / \"New Jersey\"\n* [[Christopher Lloyd]] as John Bigboot\u00e9\n* [[Lewis Smith (actor)|Lewis Smith]] as Tommy \"Perfect Tommy\"\n* [[Rosalind Cash]] as John Emdall\n* [[Robert Ito]] as Professor Hikita\n* [[Pepe Serna]] as Reno Nevada\n* Michael Santoro as Billy Travers\n* [[Ronald Lacey]] as President Widmark\n* [[Matt Clark (actor)|Matt Clark]] as Secretary of Defense McKinley\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as \"Rawhide\"\n* [[William Traylor]] as General Catburd\n* [[Carl Lumbly]] as John Parker\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as John O'Connor\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as John Gomez\n* [[Mariclare Costello]] as Senator Cunningham\n* [[Bill Henderson (performer)|Bill Henderson]] as Casper Lindley\n* Damon Hines as Scooter Lindley\n* [[Billy Vera]] as \"Pinky\" Carruthers\n* [[Laura Harrington]] as Mrs. Johnson\n* [[Yakov Smirnoff]] as National Security Advisor\n* [[Jonathan Banks]] as Lizardo Hospital Guard\n* Tommy J.

Richter]]'s wife read a review of ''Dirty Pictures from the Prom'', the debut novel from [[Dartmouth College]] graduate and writer [[Earl Mac Rauch]], and recommended it to her husband. Richter, also an alumnus from the college, read the book, loved it, and wrote Mac Rauch a letter.<ref name=\"Burns\">Burns 1984, p. 56.</ref> The two men began corresponding. When the writer told him about his interest in becoming a screenwriter, Richter offered him an open-ended invitation to visit him in Los Angeles where he was attending the [[University of Southern California]]<ref name=\"berger\">{{cite news |last=Berger |first=Dan |title=The Saga of a Hollywood Orphan: An Interview with W.

Mac Rauch took Richter up on his offer and arrived in L.A. Richter proceeded to introduce the writer to producer/director [[Irwin Winkler]], who gave Mac Rauch rent money for the next six months.<ref name=\"berger\"/> Over several dinners, Mac Rauch told Richter and his wife of a character named Buckaroo Bandy about whom he was thinking of writing a screenplay. Richter and his wife liked the idea and paid Mac Rauch $1,500 to develop and write it. According to Mac Rauch, his script was inspired by \"all those out-and-out, press-the-accelerator-to-the-floor, non-stop kung fu movies of the early '70s\".<ref name=\"goldberg2\">{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Lee |title=Earl MacRauch: Living with the ''Lepers of Saturn'' |work=[[Starlog]] |date=July 1984 }}</ref> Richter remembers that Mac Rauch wrote several stories about this character, then he \"would get thirty or forty pages into a script, abandon its storyline and write a new one\".<ref name=\"Burns\"/> Mac Rauch recalled, \"It's so easy to start something and then\u2014since you're really not as serious about it as you should be\u2014end up writing half of it ... You shove the hundred pages in a drawer and try to forget about it. Over the years, I started a dozen ''Buckaroo'' scripts that ended that way.\"<ref name=\"flynn\"/>\n\nMac Rauch's original 30-page treatment was titled ''Find the Jetcar, Said the President - A Buckaroo Banzai Thriller''.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> Early on, one of the revisions Mac Rauch made was changing Buckaroo's surname from Bandy to Banzai. Mac Rauch was not happy with the name change, but Richter convinced him to keep the new name.<ref name=\"berger\"/> The Hong Kong Cavaliers also appeared in these early drafts, but, according to Richter, \"it never really went to a completed script. Mac wrote and wrote but never wrote the end\".<ref name=\"berger\"/> Another early draft was titled ''The Strange Case of Mr. Cigars'' about a huge robot and a box of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s cigars.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> Mac Rauch shelved his work for a few years while he wrote ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'' for [[Martin Scorsese]] and other unproduced screenplays.<ref name=\"flynn\"/>\n\nIn 1980, Richter talked with producers [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] and [[Neil Canton]] about filming one of his screenplays.<ref name=\"production notes\">{{cite news |title=''The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai'' Production Notes |work=[[20th Century Fox]] Press Kit |year=1984}}</ref> Out of this meeting, Canton and Richter formed their own production company and decided that ''Buckaroo Banzai'' would be the first film. Under their supervision, Mac Rauch wrote a 60-page treatment titled ''Lepers from Saturn''.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> They shopped Mac Rauch's treatment around to production executives who were their peers, proposing that Richter direct it, but no one wanted to take on such unusual subject matter by two first-time producers and a first-time director. Canton and Richter contacted veteran producer [[Sidney Beckerman (movie producer)|Sidney Beckerman]] at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]], with whom Canton had worked before.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> Beckerman liked the treatment and introduced Richter and Canton to studio chief [[David Begelman]]. Within 24 hours, they had a development deal with the studio.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> It took Mac Rauch a year and a half to write the final screenplay; during this time, the Lepers from the treatment became Lizards and then Lectroids\u2014from Planet 10.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> Much of the film's detailed character histories were taken from Mac Rauch's unfinished ''Banzai'' scripts.<ref name=\"Burns2\">Burns 1984, p. 60.</ref>\n\nThe [[1981 Writers Guild of America strike]] forced the project to languish in development for more than a year. Begelman left MGM as several of his projects had performed poorly at the box office; this put all of his future projects, ''Buckaroo Banzai'' included, in jeopardy.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> Begelman formed Sherwood Productions and exercised a buy-out option with MGM for the ''Banzai'' script. He took it to [[20th Century Fox]] who agreed to make it with a $12&nbsp;million budget.<ref name=\"Burns6\">Burns 1984, p. 55.</ref> Mac Rauch ended up writing three more drafts before they had a shooting script.<ref name=\"goldberg2\"/>\n\n=== Casting ===\nWhen considering the role of Buckaroo Banzai, Richter wanted an actor who \"could both look heroic with grease all over his face, and project the kind of intelligence you would associate with a neurosurgeon and inventor\".<ref name=\"Burns3\">Burns 1984, p. 61.</ref> The studio wanted a recognizable film star, but Richter and Canton wanted to cast a relatively unknown actor.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> Richter looked in New York City because he assumed that an actor with experience on stage and small films \"would be able to ''completely'' interact with props\".<ref name=\"Burns3\"/> He had been impressed by [[Peter Weller]]'s performance in ''[[Shoot the Moon]]'' and met with him.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> At first, the actor was hesitant to take the role because he was unclear on the overall tone of the film. \"Would it be campy? Would it be a cartoon? Or would it be the sort of wacky, realistic film that would catch people sideways\u2014and not be a cartoon\", Weller remembers thinking.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> Richter told Banzai's story to Weller and convinced him to do the film. The actor stated that he based his character on [[Elia Kazan]], [[Jacques Cousteau]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Adam Ant]].<ref name=\"production notes\"/>\n\nFor the role of Dr. Emilio Lizardo, the studio wanted to cast an unknown actor, but Mac Rauch had written the role with [[John Lithgow]] in mind. Like Weller, Lithgow was not sure about the character, but Richter convinced him by \"claiming what a real feast for an actor this wonderful Jekyll and Hyde character was\", Lithgow later said.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> He told an interviewer, \"I have had roles where I came very close to going over the top. In ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie|Twilight Zone]]'' I almost went over the top several times. But this role is completely over the top. It makes the role in ''Twilight Zone'' seem like a model of restraint. I do it in a wild, red fright wig and rotten false teeth with a thick Italian accent. It's wild.\"<ref name=\"PhilInq\">{{cite news |last=Lyman |first=Rick |title=An actor who has mastered versatility |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=February 19, 1984 |page=I01}}</ref> For Lizardo's accent, Lithgow spent time with an Italian tailor at MGM and recorded his voice (film credit to \"Roberto Terminelli: John Lithgow's dialect coach\"). Lithgow changed his walk to that of an \"old crab, because my alien metabolism is supposed to be messed up\".<ref name=\"production notes\"/> He said of his character, \"playing Lizardo felt like playing the madman in ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''.\"<ref name=\"production notes\"/>\n\n[[Ellen Barkin]], who played the romantic interest \"Penny Priddy\", describes the film as \"if [[Terry Southern]] had written ''[[Star Wars]]''. None of the characters are quite what they should be\u2014just my kind of thing.\"<ref name=\"production notes\"/> Richter's only choice to play John Bigboot\u00e9 was [[Christopher Lloyd]], who agreed to the role. Richter first met [[Jeff Goldblum]] on ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' and wanted him to play the character New Jersey; the actor admired the script and was eager to work with the cast the director had assembled. [[Lewis Smith (actor)|Lewis Smith]] was asked to dye his hair blond; it took eight hours, and he saw it go from red to orange to fluorescent yellow to white.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> [[Clancy Brown]] said that his character is \"very common sensical. He's the everyman of the film\".<ref name=\"production notes\"/> [[Robert Ito]] was so determined to get the role of Dr. Hikita, that he disguised himself as an old man, designing his own makeup job to age himself 30 years.<ref name=\"production notes\"/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Buckaroo_Banzai_end_credit_cast_walk_scene.jpg|thumb|right|Getting the right look for the characters was an important part of the filmmaking and led costume designer Aggie Guerard Rodgers to raid LA stores looking for appropriate outfits. From left: New Jersey (Goldblum), Billy Travers (Santoro), Rawhide (Brown), Buckaroo (Weller), Reno (Serna), Pinky Carruthers (Vera) and Perfect Tommy (Smith).]]\n\nProduction designer [[J. Michael Riva]] had worked with Richter before and spent two years working on the look for ''Banzai''.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> He and Richter studied many kinds of art and literature for the film's look, including medical journals, African magazines, and Russian history. The inspiration for the look of the Lectroids came from Riva sporting a lobster on his nose. He based the Lectroids' alien form on Canadian-American paleontologist [[Dale Russell]]'s \"[[dinosauroid]]\", an extrapolation of what dinosaurs might have evolved into if they had survived, but modified the concept because it would have required prosthetics that would have immobilized the actors.<ref name=\"Burns5\"/> Their makeup consisted of 12 separate pieces of latex appliances per alien. Each actor's makeup was unique, with casts taken of their faces.<ref name=\"Burns5\"/> For the Red Lectroids, Riva consulted Russian history to give them a \"baggy-suited, Moscow bureaucrat sort of image\";<ref name=\"Burns5\"/> their outfits were influenced by contemporary Russian lifestyles and they went with greens, blues and yellows because, according to Riva, they are \"sick and anemic.\"<ref name=\"production notes\"/>\n\nCostume designer Aggie Guerard Rodgers, who designed costumes for ''[[Return of the Jedi]],'' ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[The Conversation]],'' met Richter while working on ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''. Riva noted that \"She fell right into step with the stuff I was designing for the sets,\" making the costumes match the color of the rooms.<ref name=press>{{cite techreport |url=http://www.figmentfly.com/bb/publicity.html |title= The Buckaroo Banzai Press Kit Contents |date=1984}}</ref> Richter wanted the Black Lectroids to have a \"warrior-like demeanor, but in an elegant, not fierce fashion\";<ref name=\"Burns5\">Burns 1984, p. 54.</ref> their costumes came from African tribal markings. For Buckaroo's and his Cavaliers' look, Rodgers gathered [[Gianni Versace]], [[Perry Ellis]], and [[Giorgio Armani]] sports jackets, suits, and ties.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> The clothing was mostly found in LA area stores. Rogers noted \"We also wanted to have something a little off so that there's a kick to everything to make it unique. Rick changed something on every outfit\" and that \"It's an interesting style, not a cliche style. You throw stuff in there that people will recognize.\"<ref name=press/> Goldblum's character Dr. Zweibel was given a cowboy outfit to wear; according to costumer Radford Polinski, the character thought he was dressed appropriately for an audition for a person named \"Buckaroo\". The outfit itself was from [[Nudie Cohn]]'s Rodeo Tailors.<ref name=\"35th wwo costuming\">{{cite magazine | title = Interview: Radford Polinski | magazine = World Watch One Newsletter - 35th Anniversary | date = September 8, 2019 | pages = 20\u201324 | first = Steve | last=  Mattsson }}</ref>\n\nRichter and Riva did not want metal spaceships and opted for a more organic look like a deep sea oyster shell.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> Gregory Jein, Inc. and Stetson Visual Concepts built the spaceship models and worked off sketches by production illustrator Tom Cranham and used seashells as guides.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> Richter purposely wanted the film to have an unpolished look because the \"real world appears ramshackle\u2014because people constantly repair whatever's around them\".<ref name=\"Burns4\">Burns 1984, p. 53.</ref>\n\n=== Principal photography ===\nBy the time of filming, Richter had compiled a 300-page book called ''The Essential Buckaroo''<ref name=\"berger\"/> that consisted of notes and had every incomplete script Mac Rauch wrote over the years.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> These included various references to a villain named Hanoi Xan, leader of the World Crime League. Begelman was adamant that ''Across the 8th Dimension'' would be the one and only Buckaroo movie and that all references to Xan be removed. This included the removal of the original opening, which showed Buckaroo's father being killed by Xan and featuring [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Buckaroo's mother. The director later described Begelman as \"our enemy for the entire movie.\"<ref name=\"Richter interview\"/>\n\nPrincipal photography began during the second week of September 1983 on locations in and around South Gate, an industrial suburb of L.A.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> Buckaroo's neurosurgery scene with New Jersey was shot at the Lakeview Medical Center in the [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref name=\"production notes\"/> The jet car sequences were shot in October on a dry lake north of the [[San Bernardino Mountains]]. The vehicle was designed and built by Riva, art director Stephen Dane, and Thrust Racing owners Jerry Segal and George Hedebeck. Segal started with a [[Ford F-350]] truck, reinforced the frame assembly, added the front end from a Grand National stock car, borrowed air scoops from a [[DC-3]], and a one-man cockpit modeled after a [[Messerschmitt]] fighter plane.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> Under the hood, Segal modified the Ford engine with an oversized carburetor and nitrous oxide injectors. [[Northrop University]] loaned the production a working GE turbojet engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.figmentfly.com/bb/institute4.html|title=What do we know about the Jet Car?|website=figmentfly.com}}</ref> The oscillation overthruster was created by Riva and visual effects supervisor Michael Fink out of a gyroscope to which a metal frame, wires, circuits, and tiny strobe lights were added.<ref name=\"production notes\"/>\n\nCinematographer [[Jordan Cronenweth]] was initially hired as the film's director of photography but, halfway through production, producers replaced him with [[Fred J.

Lizardo's 1938 laboratory was filmed at a deserted industrial site, Alpha Tubing. The set decorators rented a collection of 1930s electrical props originally used in the original [[Boris Karloff]] [[Frankenstein]] films.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> The interiors of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems were shot in the abandoned [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tire factory. [[Wilmington, Los Angeles|Wilmington]]'s Department of Water and Power provided the location for Dr. Lizardo's shock tower and served as the Yoyodyne exterior, while the Armco Steel Plant in Torrance housed the Lectroid launch hangar.<ref name=\"production notes\"/> Weller remembers that during the scene where his character is tortured by Dr. Lizardo, \"I was laughing at the banter between [Christopher] Lloyd and [John] Lithgow ... I never laughed so hard in my life! They had to stop takes over and over on that segment.\"<ref name=\"niderost\">{{cite news |last=Niderost |first=Eric |title=Peter Weller: Code Name: Robocop |work=[[Starlog]] |date=August 1987 }}</ref> Finally, 12 weeks of filming were done on the backlot and soundstages at MGM.<ref name=\"production notes\"/>\n\nBegelman continually interfered with production through the initial stages of shooting, demanding changes and sending notes. By the end of filming, these demands had disappeared. The crew became convinced that Begelman had \"checked out\", and to test their theory, added a now-famous scene in which the presence of a [[watermelon]] becomes a topic for a short discussion. When the scene was allowed into the movie without comment, they concluded that management was indeed ignoring them, and they had free rein to put in whatever they wanted.<ref name=\"Richter interview\"/>\n\nBegelman eventually made one more major change after seeing that the movie ended with a kiss and demanding something more. By this time the budget was almost completely spent and postproduction nearly complete.

Boddicker had just won a [[Grammy Award]] for his song \"Imagination\" on the ''[[Flashdance]]'' soundtrack. In addition to composing the score, Boddicker also produced the alien sound effects, while [[Alan Howarth (composer)|Alan Howarth]] was hired to create the sounds of the 8th Dimension.<ref name=\"production notes\"/>\n\nHowe selected the source music for the club scene and put together a special arrangement of \"[[Since I Don't Have You]]\" that Buckaroo sings to Penny Priddy. Weller, an accomplished musician, played the guitar and pocket trumpet, did his own vocals, and learned to mime piano playing. Howe and the filmmakers decided not to go with a rock music score for the film and opted for an electronic one instead. Howe wanted to \"integrate music and sound effects so that everything would merge on the soundtrack with no distinction between music and sound.\"<ref name=\"production notes\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Release ===\nFox hired Terry Erdmann and a team of publicists including Blake Mitchell and Jim Ferguson to promote the film at ''[[Star Trek]]'' conventions with a few film clips and free Banzai headbands, which have since become highly sought-after collector's items by fans of the film.<ref name=\"flynn\"/> The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there were some magazine advertisements (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, \"Nobody knew what to do with ''Buckaroo Banzai''. There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about\u2014I'm not sure anybody knew\".<ref name=\"flynn\"/> Lithgow said, \"I've tried to explain the story line to people and it takes about an hour.
