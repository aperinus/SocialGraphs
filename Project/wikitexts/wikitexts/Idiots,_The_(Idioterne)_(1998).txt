It is his first film made in compliance with the [[Dogme 95|Dogme 95 Manifesto]], and is also known as Dogme #2. It is the second film in von Trier's ''Golden Heart Trilogy'', preceded by ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996) and succeeded by ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'' (2000). It is among the first films to be shot entirely with digital cameras.\n\n==Plot==\nA seemingly anti-[[bourgeois]] group of adults spend their time seeking their \"inner [[Idiot (usage)|idiot]]\" to release their inhibitions. They do so by behaving in public as if they were [[Developmental disability|developmentally disabled]].\n\nAt a restaurant, the patrons are disturbed by the group's mischief, barely contained by their supposed \"handler\", Susanne; however, single diner Karen develops an appreciation of their antics. The members of the group refer to this behaviour as \"spassing\", a [[neologism]] derived from \"spasser\", the Danish equivalent of \"[[Spastic (word)|spaz]]\". Karen leaves in a taxi with the people from the restaurant, and she finds herself at a big house. The apparent leader of the group, Stoffer, is supposed to be selling the house (which belongs to his uncle), but instead it becomes the focal point for group activities.\n\nThe \"spassing\" is a self-defeating attempt by the group to challenge the establishment through provocation. The self-styled idiots feel that the society-at-large treats their intelligence uncreatively and unchallengingly; thus, they seek the uninhibited self-expression that they imagine a romantic ideal of disability will allow.\n\nStoffer, at his birthday party, wishes for a \"[[Group sex|gangbang]]\", and both clothes and inhibitions are soon discarded. Then, when Stoffer calls for the group members to let idiocy invade their personal daily lives, Karen takes up the challenge. She takes Susanne back to her house, where they are greeted with surprise by Karen's mother. Karen has been missing for two weeks, following the death of her young baby; she offers no explanation of where she has been. Karen attempts to spaz in front of her family by dribbling her food, but this results in a violent slap from her husband, Anders. Karen and Susanne leave the house together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bodil J\u00f8rgensen]] as Karen\n* [[Jens Albinus]] as Stoffer\n* [[Anne Louise Hassing]] as Susanne\n* [[Troels Lyby]] as Henrik\n* [[Nikolaj Lie Kaas]] as Jeppe\n* [[Louise Mieritz]] as Josephine\n* [[Henrik Prip]] as Ped\n* Luis Mesonero as Miguel\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Knud Romer J\u00f8rgensen|da}} as Axel\n* [[Trine Michelsen]] as Nana\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Anne-Grethe Bjarup Riis|da}} as Katrine\n* [[Paprika Steen]] as High-class lady\n* [[Erik Weders\u00f8e]] as Stoffer's uncle\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Michael Moritzen|da}} as Man From Municipality\n* [[Anders Hove (actor)|Anders Hove]] as Josephine's father\n* [[Lars von Trier]] (''uncredited voice'') as Interviewer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Idiots'' is a [[Co-production (filmmaking)|co-production]] of companies from [[Cinema of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Cinema of France|France]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]], [[Cinema of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Cinema of Spain|Spain]], and [[Cinema of Sweden|Sweden]].

Accordingly, von Trier made the following confession:\n\n<blockquote>In relation to the production of Dogme 2 \"''The Idiots''\", I confess:\n* To have used a [[stand-in]] in one case only (the [[sexual intercourse]] scene).\n* To have organised payment of cash to the actors for shopping of accessories (food).\n* To have intervened with the location (by moving sources of light \u2013 candlelight \u2013 to achieve exposure).\n* To have been aware of the fact that the production had entered into an agreement of leasing a car (without the knowledge of the involved actor).\n\nAll in all, and apart from the above, I feel to have lived up to the intentions and rules of the manifesto: Dogme95.<ref name=\"Trier1998\">{{cite book |last=von Trier |first=Lars | author-link=Lars von Trier |title=Dogme 2, Idioterne: manuskript og dagbog |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LznAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Gyldendal |language=da |isbn=978-87-00-34238-5}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn order to not violate Dogme 95 rule 2, forbidding the use of non-[[Diegetic#Film sound and music|diegetic]] music, a harmonica player was recorded during the shooting of some scenes, including the end credits, even if he is not seen onscreen.<ref>Interview of Lars von Trier in the bonus features of the DVD</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Idiots'' provoked a storm of publicity and debates, one of which was about the fictional representation of disability.<ref name=BRAND_REPUBLIC>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/476762/channel-4-avoids-action-complaints-idiots-orgy/ |title=Channel 4 avoids action on complaints about Idiots orgy |last= Farey-Jones |first=Daniel |work=[[Brand Republic]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group]] |date=24 May 2005}}</ref> Film critic [[Mark Kermode]]'s reaction was to shout \"Il est [[merde]]!
