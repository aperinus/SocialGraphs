It is the opposite direction from [[east]] and is the direction in which the [[Sunset|Sun sets]] on the Earth.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"west\" is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word passed into some [[Romance languages]] (''ouest'' in French, ''oest'' in Catalan, ''ovest'' in Italian, ''oeste'' in Spanish and Portuguese). As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: 'west' derives from the Indo-European root ''*wes'' reduced from ''*wes-pero'' 'evening, night', cognate with Ancient Greek \u1f15\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 [[Hesperus|hesperos]] 'evening; evening star; western' and Latin vesper 'evening; west'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/west|title=west {{!}} Origin and meaning of west by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin [[Occident|occidens]] 'west' from occid\u014d 'to go down, to set' and Hebrew \u05de\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d1 maarav 'west' from \u05e2\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1 erev 'evening'.\n\n==Navigation==\nTo go west using a compass for [[navigation]] (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) one needs to set a [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] or [[azimuth]] of 270\u00b0.\n\nWest is the direction opposite that of the [[Earth]]'s rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the [[Sun]] appears to constantly progress and eventually set. This is not true on the planet [[Venus]], which rotates in the opposite direction from the Earth ([[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde rotation]]). To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in [[Poles of astronomical bodies|the west]] and set in the east<ref name=\"compare\">{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/compare_the_planets/terrestrial.html |title=Space Topics: Compare the Planets |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |access-date=12 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218084852/http://planetary.org/explore/topics/compare_the_planets/terrestrial.html |archive-date=18 February 2006}}</ref> although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.<ref>{{cite book |title=Solar System Voyage |author=Serge Brunier |author-link=Serge Brunier |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkLxJOhEj-wC&pg=PA40 |isbn=978-0-521-80724-1 |translator-last=Dunlop |translator-first=Storm}}</ref>\n\nIn a map with north at the top, west is on the left.\n\nMoving continuously west is following a [[circle of latitude]].\n\n==Weather==\nDue to the direction of the Earth's rotation, the prevailing wind in many places in the [[middle latitudes]] (i.e. between 35 and 65 degrees [[latitude]]) is from the west, known as the [[westerlies]].<ref name=\"Glossary of Meteorology 2009\">{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=westerlies1|title=Westerlies|publisher=American Meteorological Society|access-date=2009-04-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622073904/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=westerlies1|archive-date=2010-06-22}}</ref><ref name=\"Sue Ferguson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icbemp.gov/science/ferguson_42.pdf|title=Climatology of the Interior Columbia River Basin|author=Sue Ferguson|date=2001-09-07|publisher=Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project|access-date=2009-09-12|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515003307/http://www.icbemp.gov/science/ferguson_42.pdf|archive-date=2009-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural==\n{{further|Western culture}}\nThe phrase \"the West\" is often spoken in reference to the [[Western world]], which includes the [[European Union]] (also the [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] countries), the Americas, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and (in part) South Africa.\n\nThe concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Western Christianity]]. During the [[Cold War]] \"the West\" was often used to refer to the [[NATO]] camp as opposed to the [[Warsaw Pact]] and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned nations]]. The expression survives, with an increasingly ambiguous meaning.\n\n==Symbolic meanings==\nIn Chinese [[Buddhism]], the West represents movement toward the [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]] or enlightenment (see [[Journey to the West]]). The ancient [[Aztec]]s believed that the West was the realm of the great goddess of [[water]], mist, and [[maize]]. In [[Ancient Egypt]], the West was considered to be the portal to the [[underworld|netherworld]], and is the cardinal direction regarded in connection with [[death]], though not always with a negative connotation. Ancient Egyptians also believed that the [[Goddess]] [[Amunet]] was a personification of the West.<ref>[[Joseph Campbell|Campbell, Joseph]]. ''The Mythic Image.'' [[Princeton University Press]], 1981.</ref> The [[Celt]]s believed that beyond the western sea off the edges of all maps lay the [[Otherworld]], or Afterlife.\n\nIn [[Judaism]], west is seen to be toward the [[Shekinah]] (presence) of God, as in Jewish history the [[Tabernacle]] and subsequent [[Jerusalem Temple]] faced east, with God's Presence in the [[Holy of Holies]] up the steps to the west.  According to the [[Bible]], the [[Israelites]] crossed the [[Jordan River]] westward into the [[Promised Land]]. In [[Islam]], while in India, people pray facing towards the west as in respect to [[Mecca]], [[Mecca]] is in the West-ward direction.\n\nIn [[American literature]] (e.g., in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'') moving West has sometimes symbolized gaining [[liberty|freedom]], perhaps as an association with the settling of the [[Wild West]] (see also the [[American frontier]] and [[Manifest Destiny]]).\n\n==Fantasy fiction==\n[[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] used it symbolically, with the dying Thorin calling [[Bilbo Baggins]] \"child of the kindly West\" in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.  This is much more definite in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', where the east served [[Sauron]] and his enemies associate themselves with the West.\n\nIn Saberhagen's [[Empire of the East series]], the rival powers are West and East, including both humans and supernatural beings.  All demons are part of the East.\n\nThis is not universal.  In Tolkien's earlier work, the north had been the direction of evil.  C S Lewis in [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]] has the east as the sacred direction, leading to Aslan's country\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{CandODirections}}\n\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]"}]}}}}
