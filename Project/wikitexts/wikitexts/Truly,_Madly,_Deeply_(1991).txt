The film, written and directed by [[Anthony Minghella]], stars [[Juliet Stevenson]] and [[Alan Rickman]].\n\n==Plot==\nNina, an [[Interpreter (communication)|interpreter]], is beside herself with grief at the recent death of her boyfriend, Jamie, a [[cellist]]. When she is on the verge of despair, Jamie reappears as a \"ghost\" and the couple are reunited. Nina is ecstatic.\n\nBut Jamie tells her about his days while she is at work, and one dialogue suggests she should embrace the life around her; one of these is about a memorial plaque in a park about a dead child and how parents who read it feel an immediate, compelling need to hug their children.\n\nThe returned Jamie also reminds her that he also irritated her, and as a ghost he manifests behaviours she'd have little patience for \u2013 turning up the [[central heating]] to stifling levels, moving furniture around and inviting back \"ghost friends\" to watch videos. This infuriates her, and their relationship deteriorates.\n\nShe meets Mark, a [[psychologist]], to whom she is attracted, but she is unwilling to become involved with him because of Jamie's continued presence. Nina continues to love Jamie but is conflicted by his self-centered behaviour and ultimately wonders out loud, \"Was it always like this?\" Over Nina's objections, Jamie decides to leave to allow her to move on.\n\nTowards the end of the film, Jamie watches Nina leave and one of his fellow ghosts asks, \"Well?\" and Jamie responds, \"I think so... Yes.\" At this point the central conceit of the movie has become clear: Jamie came back specifically to help Nina get over him by tarnishing her idealized memory of him.<ref name=\"minghella\" />\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Juliet Stevenson]] as Nina\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as Jamie\n* Jenny Howe as Burge\n* Carolyn Choa as Translator\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as Sandy\n* Christopher Rozycki as Titus\n* Keith Bartlett as Plumber\n* [[David Ryall]] as George\n* Stella Maris as Maura\n* Ian Hawkes as Harry\n* [[Deborah Findlay]] as Claire\n* Vania Vilers as Frenchman\n* Arturo Venegas as Roberto\n* Richard Syms as Symonds\n* [[Michael Maloney]] as Mark\n\n==Production==\nMinghella said he wrote the script specifically as \"a vehicle for [Stevenson] to express all her talents.

(Alan Rickman and Juliet Stevenson received Best Actor and Best Actress, and Anthony Minghella Most Promising Newcomer, from the 1991 [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]].<ref>[https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/film/evening-standard-british-film-awards-19902001-7222966.html \"Evening Standard British Film Awards 1990-2001\"], ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 10 January 2003.</ref>)  It became a hit in the American arthouse circuit and Minghella subsequently was offered work by every major studio in Hollywood.<ref name=mees/> The film's combination of serious themes with comic scenes, music and strong performances from the actors was noted by critics. [[Roger Ebert]] called it \"a ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' for grownups\" (a common comparison because of the shared theme of lovers returning as ghosts and the concurrent releases of the films) and considered the film to reveal \"some truths that are, the more you think about them, really pretty profound\".<ref>Roger Ebert, [https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/truly-madly-deeply-1991 Truly, Madly, Deeply], 24 May 1991</ref> Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 75% approval rating based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.
