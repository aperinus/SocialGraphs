Loosely based on [[Federico Fellini]]'s film ''[[La Strada]]'', the film tells the fictional story, set in the 1930s, of self-confident [[jazz]] [[guitar]]ist Emmet Ray (played by [[Sean Penn]]) who falls in love with a [[Muteness|mute]] woman ([[Samantha Morton]]). The film also stars [[Uma Thurman]] and [[Anthony LaPaglia]]. Like several of Allen's other films (e.g., ''[[Zelig]]''), the film is occasionally interrupted by interviews with critics and biographers like Allen, [[Nat Hentoff]], [[Daniel Okrent]],and [[Douglas McGrath]], who comment on the film's plot as if the characters were real-life people.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews upon release,<ref name= \"tom\">{{rotten-tomatoes|sweet_and_lowdown|Sweet and Lowdown}}</ref> with Penn and Morton receiving Oscar nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively.\n\n==Plot summary==\nEmmet Ray is a jazz guitarist who achieved some acclaim in the 1930s with a handful of recordings for [[RCA Victor]], but who faded from public view under mysterious circumstances. Although he is a talented musician, Ray's personal life is a shambles. He is a spendthrift, womanizer and [[pimp]] who believes that falling in love will ruin his musical career. Due to his heavy drinking, he's often late or even absent for performances with his quintet. After music, his favorite hobbies are shooting rats at garbage dumps and watching passing trains. Ray idolizes famed guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]], and is said to have fainted in his presence and to have fled a nightclub performance with severe [[stage fright]] upon hearing a false rumor that Reinhardt was in the audience.\n\nOn a double date with his drummer, Ray meets Hattie, a shy, mute laundress. After overcoming some initial frustration due to the difficulties of communication, Ray and Hattie form an affectionate and close relationship. She accompanies him on a cross-country trip to Hollywood, where he plays in a short film; Hattie is spotted by a director and enjoys a brief screen career. However Ray is convinced that a musician of his stature should never settle down with one woman. On a whim, Ray marries socialite Blanche Williams. However, Blanche sees Ray mainly as a colorful example of lower-class life and a source of inspiration for her literary writings. She reports that Ray is tormented by nightmares and shouts out Hattie's name in his sleep.\n\nWhen Blanche cheats with mobster Al Torrio, Ray leaves her and locates Hattie. He assumes that she will take him back, but discovers that she is happily married and raising a family. Afterwards, on a date with a new woman, a despondent Ray plays a melody that Hattie adored and then smashes his guitar and forlornly repeats the phrase \"I made a mistake!\" as his date leaves him. Woody Allen and the rest of the documentary experts remarked that Ray's final compositions were legendary, finally reaching the quality of Reinhardt's.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sean Penn]] as Emmet Ray\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Hattie\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Al Torrio\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Blanche Williams\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Henry\n* [[John Waters]] as Mr. Haynes\n* [[Gretchen Mol]] as Ellie\n* [[Denis O'Hare]] as Jake\n* [[Molly Price]] as Ann\n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Bill Shields\n* [[Tony Darrow]] as Ben\n* [[Daniel Okrent]] as A.J.

Told to \"write what you want to write,\" Allen (a clarinetist and avid jazz enthusiast) wrote ''The Jazz Baby'', a dramatic screenplay about a jazz musician set in the 1930s. Allen said later that the United Artists executives were \"stunned&nbsp;... because they had expected a comedy. [They] were very worried and told me, 'We realize that we signed a contract with you and you can do anything you want. But we want to tell you that we really don't like this.'\"{{sfn|Bjorkman|2005|p=36-37}} Allen went along with United Artists, writing and directing ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' instead. In 1995, he dismissed ''The Jazz Baby'' as having been \"probably too ambitious.\"{{sfn|Bjorkman|2005|p=36-37}}\n\nIn 1998, Allen returned to the project, rewriting the script and dubbing it ''Sweet and Lowdown''. In the role of Emmet Ray, a jazz guitarist whom Allen had originally planned to play himself, the director cast [[Sean Penn]]; Allen also considered [[Johnny Depp]], but the actor was busy at the time.{{sfn|Bjorkman|2005|p=347-356}} In regard to working with Sean Penn, who had a reputation for being difficult to work with, Allen later said, \"I had no problem with him whatsoever&nbsp;... He gave it his all and took direction and made contributions himself&nbsp;... a tremendous actor.\"{{sfn|Bjorkman|2005|p=347-356}}\n\nAllen has said that he told Samantha Morton to \"play [her] part like [[Harpo Marx]]. And she said, 'Who is [[Harpo Marx]]?' and I realized how young she was. Then I told her about him [and] she went back and saw the films.\"{{sfn|Bjorkman|2005|p=347-356}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n''Sweet and Lowdown'' was filmed entirely in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]<ref name=\"Record2002\">{{Cite news |last=Davis |first=Tom |date=January 2, 2002 |title=A Place For Troops, Troupes, Hoops: Teaneck Armory Still Vital |work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] |url=http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/Armory/armory2002.html |url-status=dead |access-date=June 6, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013425/http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/Armory/armory2002.html |archive-date=March 6, 2012}}</ref> but is set in the Chicago area and California.{{sfn|Bjorkman|2005|p=347-356}}\n\nThe film was the first of Allen's that was edited by [[Alisa Lepselter]], who has edited all of Allen's films since. Lepselter succeeded [[Susan E. Morse]], who edited Allen's films for the previous twenty years.\n\nIt was also the first of three films where Allen collaborated with Chinese [[cinematographer]] [[Zhao Fei]].  Allen had first noticed Zhao with his award-winning work on ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'', some years earlier.\n\n==Music==\nThe music for the film was arranged and conducted by [[Dick Hyman]]. All of the guitar solos are played by guitarist [[Howard Alden]]. Alden also coached [[Sean Penn]] on playing the guitar for his role in the film.\n\nAdditional rhythm guitarists were [[Bucky Pizzarelli]] and [[James Chirillo]]. Chirillo played rhythm guitar on the ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' track where the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] cable breaks while [[Sean Penn]] is riding it. Pizzarelli did all other rhythm tracks.\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{div col|colwidth=48em}}\n*When Day Is Done (1926)- Written by Robert Katscher \u2013 Performed by [[Django Reinhardt]]\n*Clarinet Marmalade (1918) \u2013 Written by [[Larry Shields]] and [[Henry Ragas]] \u2013 Performed by [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]] and His Orchestra\n*Parlez-moi d'Amour (1930) \u2013 Written by [[Jean Lenoir (composer)|Jean Lenoir]] \u2013 Performed by [[Howard Alden]]\n*Mystery Pacific (1936\u20137) \u2013 Written by Django Reinhardt and [[St\u00e9phane Grappelli]] \u2013 Performed by [[Howard Alden]], [[Bucky Pizzarelli]] and [Kelly Friesen \n*Limehouse Blues (1922) \u2013 Lyrics by [[Philip Braham]] \u2013 Written by [[Douglas Furber]] \u2013 Arranged by Dick Hyman\n*It Don't Mean a Thing (1931) \u2013 Lyrics by [[Irving Mills]] \u2013 Written by [[Duke Ellington]]\n*Out of Nowhere (1931) \u2013 Lyrics by [[Edward Heyman]] \u2013 Written by [[Johnny Green]]\n*I'll See You in My Dreams (1924) \u2013 Lyrics by [[Gus Kahn]] \u2013 Written by Isham Jones\n*Sweet Georgia Brown (1925) \u2013 Music by [[Ben Bernie]] and [[Maceo Pinkard]] \u2013 Lyrics by [[Kenneth Casey]]\n*Unfaithful Woman (1999) \u2013 Written by Dick Hyman\n*Shine (1910) \u2013 Lyrics by [[Cecil Mack]], Lew Brown \u2013 Music by [[Ford Dabney]]\n*After You've Gone (1918) \u2013 Lyrics by [[Henry Creamer]] \u2013 Written by [[Turner Layton]]\n*I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles (1919) \u2013 Lyrics by James Brockman, Nat Vincent, James Kendis \u2013 Music by John W.
