A [[Taken (2017 TV series)|television series]] premiered in 2017 on [[NBC]], with [[Clive Standen]] portraying a younger Bryan Mills.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--- *** NO MORE THAN 700 WORDS, per [[WP:FILMPLOT]]. *** !--->\nFormer [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] and retired [[CIA]] officer Bryan Mills attempts to build a closer relationship with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim, who lives with her mother (his ex-wife) Lenore, and her wealthy stepfather, Stuart. While overseeing security at a concert for pop star Sheerah, Bryan saves her from a knife-wielding attacker. Out of gratitude, Sheerah offers to have a vocal coach assess Kim as a singer. Before Bryan can tell her about the offer, Kim asks him for permission to travel to Paris with her best friend, Amanda. He initially refuses, concerned about her safety, but eventually gives in. At the airport, Bryan learns that Kim lied; the girls are actually planning to follow [[U2]] during their [[Vertigo Tour|European tour]].\n\nUpon arriving at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], Kim and Amanda meet Peter, a handsome young stranger who offers to share a taxi. Kim and Amanda go to Amanda's cousins' apartment, where Kim learns that the cousins are in Spain. After answering a call from Bryan, Kim sees men enter the apartment and abduct Amanda. When Kim is dragged out from hiding, she yells a description of her abductor, following her father's instructions. Bryan hears someone breathing on the phone and tells the listener that he will not pursue the kidnappers if they release his daughter, but warns them that refusing to accept his offer will result in their deaths.<ref name=\"TakenSpeech\">{{cite web |last1=Marche |first1=Stephen |title='A Very Particular Set of Skills': Revisiting the Amazing 'Taken' Speech |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a31775/taken-speech/ |website=Esquire |access-date=22 December 2020 |date=8 January 2015}}</ref> The listener only replies \"good luck\" and terminates the call.\n\nSam, an old friend and former colleague of Bryan, deduces that the kidnappers are part of an [[Albania]]n sex trafficking ring and identifies the listener as mob boss Marko Hoxha. Based on previous abductions, Kim must be found within 96&nbsp;hours or she will likely be lost forever. Bryan flies to Paris, breaks into the apartment, and finds Peter's reflection in a picture on Kim's phone. He finds Peter at the airport, trying to charm a female traveler. Bryan gives chase in a stolen taxi. While fleeing, Peter is struck and killed by an oncoming truck. With his only lead dead, Bryan turns to an old contact, ex-[[Directorate-General for External Security|DGSE]] Agent turned [[National Police (France)|National Police]] officer Jean-Claude Pitrel, who now has a desk job. Jean-Claude warns him not to get involved, but informs him of the local [[red-light district]] where Bryan plants a listening device on an Albanian pimp. Bryan searches a makeshift brothel in a construction yard and rescues a drugged young woman who has Kim's denim jacket. After a gunfight and high-speed chase with the brothel's operators, Bryan takes the woman to a hotel, where he improvises her detoxification.\n\nThe next morning, the woman tells Bryan of a house where she and Kim were kept. Posing as Jean-Claude, Bryan enters the house under the pretense of renegotiating the police protection rate. When he identifies Marko by tricking him into saying \"good luck,\" the meeting erupts into a fight which results in the deaths of several gangsters. Searching the house, Bryan finds several heavily drugged girls, including Amanda who died of an overdose. Bryan then [[Parrilla (torture)|tortures Marko with electricity]], forcing him to confess that virgins like Kim are quickly sold on the black market. Marko identifies the buyer as crime syndicate leader Patrice Saint-Clair before Bryan leaves him to die from continuous electrocution.\n\nAt Jean-Claude's apartment, Bryan confronts the police official over his corruption and shoots his wife, wounding her, to coerce him into disclosing Saint-Clair's location, before knocking him out. Bryan infiltrates a secret sex-slave auction taking place beneath Saint-Clair's mansion, where Kim is the subject of the last sale. Bryan forces Ali, one of the bidders, to purchase her, but is subsequently caught and knocked out. When Saint-Clair learns who he is, he orders his henchmen to kill Bryan, but Bryan breaks loose and kills them all. Saint-Clair reveals that Kim was taken to a yacht owned by a sheikh named Raman before Bryan murders him.\n\nBryan pursues the yacht and eliminates the bodyguards, including Ali, before he finds Raman holding Kim at knifepoint. When Raman attempts to negotiate, Bryan kills him with a headshot. Back in the United States, Bryan surprises Kim by taking her to visit Sheerah.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Bryan Mills\n* [[Maggie Grace]] as Kim Mills\n* [[Famke Janssen]] as Lenore Mills-St John\n* [[Katie Cassidy]] as Amanda\n* [[Leland Orser]] as Sam Gilroy\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Mark Casey\n* [[David Warshofsky]] as Bernie Harris\n* [[Holly Valance]] as Sheerah\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Stuart St John\n* [[Olivier Rabourdin]] as Jean-Claude Pitrel\n* [[G\u00e9rard Watkins]] as Patrice Saint-Clair\n* [[Arben Bajraktaraj]] as Marko Hoxha\n* [[Camille Japy]] as Isabelle\n* [[Nicolas Giraud]] as Peter\n* [[Goran Kosti\u0107]] as Gregor\n* {{ill|Nabil Massad|fr|Nabil Massad}} as Raman\n* {{ill|Jalil Naciri|fr|Jalil Naciri}} as Ali\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[Luc Besson]]'s [[EuropaCorp]].<ref name=\"fra\">{{cite journal |last1=Jaafar |first1=Ali |last2=Keslassy |first2=Elsa |title=New French wave prefers genre films |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=21 November 2008 |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117996318 |access-date=1 February 2009}}</ref> Pierre Morel had previously worked as a director of photography for Besson, and they had also collaborated on Morel's directorial debut, ''[[District 13]]''.
