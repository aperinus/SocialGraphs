It tells the story of Chris \"Izzy\" Cole, a [[tribute band]] singer who ascended to the position of lead vocalist of his favorite band. The script was inspired by the real-life story of [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]], singer in a [[Judas Priest]] tribute band who was chosen to replace singer [[Rob Halford]] when he left the band. After optioning the filming rights to a ''[[New York Times]]'' profile of Owens by [[Andrew Revkin]], [[Warner Bros.]] hired Stockwell to write the script. [[Brad Pitt]] was initially signed to play the lead role but left due to creative differences, and Wahlberg was eventually hired for the part. ''Rock Star'' garnered mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]], grossing $19 million worldwide against a production budget of $57 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the mid-1980s, [[Pittsburgh]] resident Chris Cole is a fanatical admirer of a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band called Steel Dragon. By day, Chris is a [[photocopier]] technician and by night, he is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon [[tribute band]] called Blood Pollution (the name is taken from a Steel Dragon song).\n\nInternal struggles among the actual Steel Dragon band members culminate with the firing of their lead singer, Bobby Beers, and the beginning of recruitment sessions to find a new vocalist. Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm. During a live performance, Rob's playing fails to live up to Chris' over-demanding standards regarding note-for-note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon recordings and, after Chris sabotages Rob's amplifier mid-song, a fight breaks out between the two onstage. The next day, Chris meets Blood Pollution at a rehearsal session, but he finds out that he has been replaced by his arch-rival, the erstwhile lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob also cites Chris' inability to create his own musical style, preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band.\n\nOne day, Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon's founder and rhythm guitarist, Kirk Cuddy, and is offered an audition for the band (thanks to two of Blood Pollution's groupies, who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution's concerts). After hanging up on Kirk once, thinking he's being pranked by Rob, Chris ecstatically agrees. At the studio, he meets the band and gives an outstanding performance of \"[[We All Die Young]]\" (a Steel Dragon song in the movie, but it is a real song by [[Steelheart]], whose lead vocalist, [[Miljenko Matijevic]], provides Cole's singing voice for the film). Chris joins the band as their new singer, adopting the stage name \"Izzy\". Following a successful debut concert with Steel Dragon, Izzy must come to grips with the pressures of his new-found fame and success. The band embarks on a lengthy tour and Izzy experiences the excesses of the lifestyle, with the group's road manager, Mats, serving as a sympathetic mentor to Izzy.\n\nHis new lifestyle impacts his life both for better and worse, particularly with his relationship with his supportive girlfriend, Emily Poule, when she decides not to continue with him throughout the remainder of the tour as a rock star girlfriend, though Emily and Izzy agree to get back together when the tour reaches [[Seattle]]. Eventually, Steel Dragon stops in Seattle for a show, and Emily arrives at his hotel room as they had previously arranged, although Izzy has become so inebriated while on tour he forgot about the arrangement and does not even know what city he is in. Although taken aback by all the groupies, Emily still tries to reconnect with him, reminding him of their plans to meet up once he got to Seattle; however he is too intoxicated to really understand what she is saying, eventually suggesting they go to Seattle together. Heartbroken with his inconsiderate behavior, intoxication and the fact that he is having sex with so many groupies, Emily leaves him.\n\nSix months later, Izzy reports to the next series of Steel Dragon recording sessions with song concepts and artwork for the band's next album. The rest of the band like his ideas, but they reject them, with Kirk explaining that the band has to stay true to the \"Steel Dragon thing\" to fulfill fan expectations. Izzy is angered upon realizing that he was only recruited for his vocal abilities. After a heartfelt conversation with Mats about how he feared he had no control over the direction life has taken him, Izzy begins to reconsider his rock star lifestyle. On the next tour, in a scene directly paralleling one near the beginning of the film with their roles reversed, Izzy hears a fan singing along with him toward the end of a live concert. Impressed, Izzy pulls the fan, who introduces himself as Thor, onstage and hands him the microphone to finish the concert.  Backstage, Izzy realizes that what he thought he wanted for so long was not what he wanted, and he says goodbye to Mats, departing from the band while doing so.\n\nAfter leaving Steel Dragon and ditching his rock star image and stage name, Chris makes his way to Seattle and starts a new band with his old friend and former bandmate, Rob, allowing him to write his own music. Chris finds Emily working in the coffee shop she and her roommate purchased a few years earlier, and he is initially too ashamed to speak to her. While walking one evening, Emily sees a flyer for his band posted on the wall and takes it down. In the final scene, Chris is singing with his band in a bar and Emily walks in. Chris leaves the stage and speaks to her. They reconcile, ending the film with a kiss and the final note of Chris' first original song \"Colorful\" (which is a real song by [[The Verve Pipe]]).\n\nDuring the credits, Cuddy talks about the future of the band and Bobby Beers is shown to have taken up Irish Dancing after his sacking from Steel Dragon.\n\n==Cast==\nThe band members are portrayed by ex-[[Dokken]] and current [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] bassist [[Jeff Pilson]]; [[Black Label Society]] founder and Ozzy Osbourne guitarist [[Zakk Wylde]]; actor [[Dominic West]]; and ex-Foreigner and [[Black Country Communion]] drummer [[Jason Bonham]] (the son of the late  [[John Bonham]], drummer for [[Led Zeppelin]]). [[Myles Kennedy]], who was at the time the lead vocalist of The Mayfield Four and now the front man of [[Alter Bridge]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]'s solo project, makes a [[cameo appearance]].\n\nThe singing voice for Wahlberg's character was provided by Steelheart frontman Miljenko Matijevic for the Steel Dragon Songs, and the final number was sung by Brian Vander Ark of The Verve Pipe. [[Jeff Scott Soto]] (of [[Talisman (band)|Talisman]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Soul SirkUS]], and [[Journey (band)|Journey]]) provided the voice of Jason Flemyng's character Bobby Beers. [[Ralph Saenz]] ([[Steel Panther]]) also appears briefly, as the singer auditioning ahead of Chris at the studio.\n\nTribute band Blood Pollution is also made up of known musical artists, including guitarist [[Nick Catanese]] ([[Black Label Society]]), drummer [[Blas Elias]] ([[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]]), and bassist [[Brian Vander Ark]] (The Verve Pipe, who also contributed a song to the film's soundtrack). Actor [[Timothy Olyphant]] portrays Blood Pollution's guitarist, Rob Malcolm.  Bradley, the singer who replaces Chris in Blood Pollution, is played by [[Third Eye Blind]] frontman [[Stephan Jenkins]].\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n'''Blood Pollution'''\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Chris \"Izzy\" Cole (lead vocals)\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Emily Poule (manager)\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Rob Malcolm (guitar)\n* [[Blas Elias]] as Donny Johnson (drums)\n* [[Nick Catanese]] as Xander Cummins (guitar)\n* [[Brian Vander Ark]] as Ricki Bell (bass)\n|width=\"20\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n'''Steel Dragon'''\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Bobby Beers (lead vocals)\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Mats (road manager)\n* [[Dominic West]] as Kirk Cuddy (rhythm guitar)\n* [[Jason Bonham]] as A.C.
