Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the second film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Louis Leterrier]] from a screenplay by [[Zak Penn]], and stars [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] alongside [[Liv Tyler]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Ty Burrell]], and [[William Hurt]]. In the film, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in a military scheme to reinvigorate the [[Project Rebirth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|\"Super-Soldier\" program]] through gamma radiation. Banner goes on the run from the military while attempting to cure himself of the Hulk.\n\nAfter the mixed reception to Universal's 2003 film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', Marvel Studios reacquired the rights to the character though Universal retained distribution rights. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' for Marvel, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a script that would be much closer to the comics and the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|1978 television series of the same name]]. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay. His script positioned the film as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, distancing it from the 2003 film to give the new version its own identity. Norton was ultimately not credited for his writing. Filming took place from July to November 2007, primarily in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], with additional filming in [[New York City]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of [[motion capture]] and [[computer-generated imagery]] to complete the film.\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' premiered at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in [[Universal City, California]], on June 8, 2008, and was released in the United States on June 13, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. It received praise for its action sequences and was considered an improvement over the 2003 film, but it was criticized as generic and lacking in depth. The film grossed $264.8 million worldwide, making it the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Reception|lowest-grossing film]] of the MCU. Norton disagreed with Marvel over the final edit of the film and was replaced in the role of Banner by [[Mark Ruffalo]] for future MCU content starting with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, Plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAt Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] meets with Dr. [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment\u2014part of a [[World War II]]-era [[Project Rebirth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|\"super soldier\" program]] that Ross hopes to re-create\u2014fails. The exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the [[Hulk]] for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, killing several people inside and injuring the General and Betty, and others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.\n\nFive years later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed.<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the former of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Banner works at a bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the internet, he anonymously collaborates with a colleague known only as \"Mr. Blue.\" He is learning [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, which is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by [[Emil Blonsky (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team, with Blonsky surviving. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing powers but also begins to deform his skeleton and impairs his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by Betty's suspicious boyfriend, Leonard Samson, causing Banner to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves futile for Ross's forces, and they retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is faltering, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. [[Samuel Sterns (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Samuel Sterns]], who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, to apply its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.\n\nA recovered Blonsky joins Ross's forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed, and Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. The experiment mutates Blonsky into [[Abomination (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the Abomination]], a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. The Abomination rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop the Abomination, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross's helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a battle throughout Harlem, the Hulk defeats the Abomination by nearly strangling him to death with a chain but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea and leaves the Abomination for Ross and his forces to arrest. After having a peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees New York.\n\nA month later, Banner is in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]]. Instead of suppressing his transformation, he begins to transform in a controlled manner with a slight smirk. Later, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him that a team is being put together.{{refn|group=N|The team is identified offscreen as the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]].}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Norton]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]: <!-- Do NOT put \"/ Hulk\" here -- unless there's a reliable source which states he voiced the character. --> <br />A [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] and [[biochemist]] at Culver University who, because of exposure to [[gamma radiation]], transforms into an enormous green humanoid monster when enraged or agitated. [[David Duchovny]] was a front-runner for the film before Norton's casting,<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> while Louis Leterrier's original choice for the role was [[Mark Ruffalo]], who would later play Banner in future [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films.<ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who played Banner in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|TV series]].<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project. Thus, Norton rewrote the script.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> \"Edward's script has given Bruce's story real gravitas,\" Leterrier said. \"Admittedly I'm not the most adult director, but just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]].\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" />\n** [[Lou Ferrigno]] provides vocal performance as the [[Hulk]]. During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> This marks the third time Ferrigno portrayed the Hulk, having also voiced the character in the [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|1996 animated series]]. Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word. Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally, and added \"Leave me alone!\" and \"Hulk smash!\" The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended.<ref name=\"IGNDirectorSpeaks\" /> Ferrigno also has a cameo in the film as a security guard who is bribed by Banner with a pizza.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" />\n* [[Liv Tyler]] as [[Betty Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Betty Ross]]: <br />A [[cellular biology|cellular biologist]] and Bruce's former girlfriend, from whom he is separated as a result of his condition. Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script and was a fan of the TV show because of the \"humanity and what [Banner] is going through\".<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> She was called about the role while driving to her home and she accepted the part after a day without reading the script.<ref name=\"TylerTimes\" /> Tyler and Norton spent hours discussing Bruce and Betty's life before he became the Hulk.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> She said filming the part \"was very physical, which was fun\",<ref name=\"TylerUSAToday\" /> and compared her performance to \"a deer caught in the headlights\", because of Betty's shock at Bruce's unexpected return into her life.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n* [[Tim Roth]] as [[Emil Blonsky (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Emil Blonsky / Abomination]]: <br />A Russian-born officer in the United Kingdom's [[Royal Marines Commandos]] loaned to Ross who, lusting for the Hulk's power, is injected with various serums that transform him into a near-skeletal humanoid monster as strong as the Hulk himself. Roth said he took the part to please his sons, who are comic-book superhero fans. As a teenager, Roth was a fan of the 1970s TV series, and he also found Leterrier's ideas \"very dark and very interesting\". Roth started watching the 2003 film to prepare for the part, but stopped as he did not want to be caught up in the controversy over its quality, and to compare himself to it.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> It was Roth who suggested Blonsky be a soldier, whereas in the comics he was a [[KGB]] agent.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Leterrier was a fan of Roth's work, and felt \"it's great watching a normal [[Cockney]] boy become a superhero!\",<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> but Marvel and Norton were initially reluctant to cast him.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> Before he was cast in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]'', [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] was in discussions for the role.<ref name=\"RayStevenson\" /> Roth prepared for the part by learning to fire guns and break into rooms with two experts.<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> Roth found it tough shooting the chases, because to show Blonsky's aging he could not work out.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He especially found it difficult to run while pulled with a harness, which was used to show the injected Blonsky's 30\u201340 mile per hour running abilities.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> [[Cyril Raffaelli]] performed some of Roth's stunts.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Roth enjoyed the [[motion capture]], which reminded him of [[fringe theatre]], and he hired his trainer from ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' to aid him in portraying the monster's movement.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> Roth was signed on for three more films.<ref name=\"RothSequels\" />\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as [[Samuel Sterns (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Samuel Sterns]]: The cellular biologist who develops a possible antidote to Banner's condition.

Burrell had performed with Norton in the [[off Broadway]] play ''[[Burn This]]'' in 2003, and when Leterrier met him, he recognized Burrell as the \"jerk\" from the 2004 ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' remake,<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> which was how Samson was characterized in the script before Norton rewrote it.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" />\n* [[William Hurt]] as [[Thaddeus Ross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]]: <br />Betty's father and a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[General (United States)|general]] who has dedicated himself to capturing the Hulk. Leterrier cast Hurt because \"Ross is more physical, more explosive in this movie, and no actor goes from zero to 100 as well as William.\"<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> He compared Ross to [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]].<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The Hulk was Hurt's favorite superhero, and his son is also a big fan of the character. Hurt found production very different from the typical \"pure anxiety\" of a studio film, finding it more akin to an independent film.<ref name=\"HurtMTV\" /> He described Ross as \"humiliated by Hulk's conscience: he actually sees and recognizes that it's more developed than his own, even though he's a patriot and a warrior for his country. He's sacrificed [much] for that purpose, but at the expense at times of his humanity \u2013 which he occasionally recovers.\"<ref name=\"HurtCalgary\" /> In June 2015, when reflecting on how his reprisal in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' was different from this film, Hurt said, \"What I created [for ''The Incredible Hulk''] was a Ross who was right out of the graphic novel type of thing, where he was as much of a cartoon, in a way, as the monsters were. His ego was just as big and his problems were just as big. I really did do that consciously. I created a General Ross before which created a verisimilitude for the monsters, by making him a human monster. I worked really hard on the makeup and the exaggerated behavior and things like that and a controlled psychosis.\"<ref name=\"HurtLATimesJune2015\" /> [[Sam Elliott]] had expressed interest in reprising the role from the 2003 ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' film.<ref name=\"ElliottMTV\" />\n\n[[Robert Downey Jr.]] has an uncredited cameo as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] at the end of the film. Downey appeared as a favor to [[Marvel Studios]], which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting his film he would also have to mention their other production.<ref name=\"DowneyCameo\" /> Hulk co-creator [[Stan Lee]] cameos as a man who becomes ill when drinking the soda poisoned by Banner's blood. [[Michael K. Williams]] appears as a Harlem bystander, a role that was written for him by Norton, who is a fan of ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]''.<ref name=\"MichaelKWilliams\" /> [[Paul Soles]], who voiced Banner in the 1966 ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' animated series, appears as Stanley, a kindly pizza restaurant owner who helps Banner. Additionally, the late Bill Bixby appears, in a scene on his TV comedy-drama ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'' on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. [[Rickson Gracie]] has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor; despite Gracie's [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] background, he is credited as an [[Aikido]] instructor. Brazilian actress [[D\u00e9bora Nascimento]] makes a cameo as Martina, Banner's colleague at a beverage factory. [[Peter Mensah]] plays a small role as General Joe Greller, one of General Ross's military friends/associates. Christina Cabot portrays Major Kathleen Sparr, General Ross's personal aide.<ref name=\"ChristinaCabot\" /> Hulk supporting characters, [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] and [[Jack McGee (character)|Jack McGee]], make cameo appearances as Culver University students played by P.J.

He was also considering the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]] and the Abomination as villains.<ref name=\"AngHulkSequel\" /> Marvel wanted the Abomination because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk, unlike General Ross.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> During the filming of ''Hulk'', producer Avi Arad had a target May 2005 theatrical release date.<ref name=\"AradMay2005\" /> On January 18, 2006, Arad confirmed Marvel Studios would be providing the money for ''The Incredible Hulk''{{'}}s production budget, with Universal distributing,<ref name=\"AICNHulk2\" /> because Universal did not meet the deadline for filming a sequel.<ref name=\"StocksSoar\" /> Marvel felt it would be better to deviate from Ang Lee's style to continue the franchise, arguing his film was like a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic book, and their next film needed to be, in Kevin Feige's words, \"''really'' starting the Marvel Hulk franchise\". Producer Gale Anne Hurd also felt the film had to meet what \"everyone expects to see from having read the comics and seen the TV series\".<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nLouis Leterrier, who enjoyed the TV series as a child and liked the first film,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /><ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> had expressed interest in directing the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' film adaptation. [[Jon Favreau]] had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier's primary inspiration was [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Tim Sale (artist)|Tim Sale]]'s ''[[Hulk: Gray]]'' (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film.<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him,<ref name=\"IGNJuly2006\" /> while Feige added the film would explore \"that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite realize you had in yourself\".<ref name=\"FeigeWish\" /> Arad also said the film would be \"a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross\".<ref name=\"May2006Empire\" />\n\n[[Zak Penn]], who wrote a draft of the first film in 1996, said the film would follow up ''Hulk'', but stressed it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]]' [[Hulk#Bibliography|run on the comic]]. He compared his script to ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', which was a very different film from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', but still in the same continuity.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film ''[[The Grand (film)|The Grand]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography.<ref name=\"LATimesSigningOn\" /> In November 2006, a June 13, 2008, release date was set.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America,<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute [[origin story]].<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand.<ref name=\"TimesSquare\" /> Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film.<ref name=\"SampleScreening\" /> Feige commented, \"we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made ''Incredible Hulk'' was to get Hulk into the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> canon.\"<ref name=\"FeigeIGNApr2014\" /> The end of the film occurs at [[Columbia University]], and Leterrier was interested in naming it Empire State University, as a reference to [[Peter Parker]], but was unable to since [[Sony Pictures]] controls the film rights of Spider-Man.<ref name=\"LeterrierMTVNewsJune2008\" />\n\nShortly after the release of ''The Incredible Hulk'', Gale Anne Hurd commented on the uncertainty of its relationship with Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' film. \"We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel.\" Hurd said that \"requel\", a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"reboot\" and \"sequel\", was a \"perfect\" description for the film.<ref name=\"ColliderHurdInt\" /> Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: \"I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning.\"<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> \"Audiences know this story,\" he added, \"[so] deal with it artfully.\" He wanted to \"have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion\".<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> The new origin story references [[Ultimate Marvel]]'s take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers.<ref name=\"ScifiWeekly\" /> Norton removed [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and toned down [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s presence.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /> He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns,<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> which references Bruce Jones' story.<ref name=\"ColliderFeige\" /> Norton rewrote scenes every day.<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> Ultimately, the [[Writers Guild of America]] decided to credit the script solely to Penn,<ref name=\"PennSoleCredit\" /> who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]] explained \"The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue.\"<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" /> Penn said in 2008, \"I wasn't happy with [Norton] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script.\"<ref name=\"PennUnhappy\" /> Before either Penn or Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.<ref name=\"ThompsonScriptCredits\" />\n\n===Filming===\nLeterrier had to direct four [[second unit|units]] with a broken foot.<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting primarily took place in [[Toronto]], because mayor [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] is a Hulk fan and promised to be very helpful to the crew when closing [[Yonge Street]] for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Morningside Park (Toronto)|Morningside Park]]. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the university for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" /> There was also shooting in the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]].<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> A factory in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], which was due for demolition, was the interior of the Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross's military command center.<ref name=\"DVDMaking\" /> The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a [[backlot]] in Hamilton.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Other Canadian locations included [[CFB Trenton]] and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in [[New York City]] and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name=\"FilmingCFB\" /> While there, the crew shot at [[Rocinha]], [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]], [[Tijuca Forest]] and [[Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro)|Santa Teresa]]. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut [[carbon emissions]] and waste created during filming.<ref name=\"TorontoStar\" /> Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, was a popular environmental analogy, and Norton himself is an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced [[pinus echinata|yellow pine]] instead of [[Decorative plywood|lauan]] for the sets, and also used zero-or low-[[Volatile Organic Compounds|VOC]] paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> ''The Incredible Hulk'' became the first blockbuster film to receive the [[Environmental Media Association]]'s Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.<ref name=\"EMAGreenSeal\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n====Editing====\nSeventy minutes of footage, mostly dealing with the origin, were not included in the final cut.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Editor [[Kyle Cooper]], creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits.<ref name=\"EditBayVisit\" /> Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to ''Hulk'', had resulted in compressing these to the film's start.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the [[Arctic]] to commit [[suicide]]. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.<ref name=\"Collider70Mins\" /> Associate producer [[Stephen Broussard]] opined that the scene really worked, but given the test audience's dislike for such opening, the filmmakers decided to move on from the planned opening and instead open the film with Bruce living in Brazil after a recap telling his origin story.<ref name=\"WhyOriginalOpeningGotCut\" />\n\nNorton and Leterrier disputed with the producers over the final running time: they wanted it to be near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton \"made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product\".<ref name=\"NYTimesRuntime\" /> Norton dismissed this: \"Our healthy process [of collaboration], which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted to such a degree that it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen. It has always been my firm conviction that films should speak for themselves and that knowing too much about how they are made diminishes the magic of watching them.\"<ref name=\"EWbtsDrama\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:Abomination in The Incredible Hulk.jpg|thumb|Leterrier's finished redesign of the Abomination]]\nLeterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard he was aiming for.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effects company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> Many of the animators and Leterrier himself provided video reference for the climactic fight.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" /> Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of \"an [[\u00fcber]]-human\" like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones, creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle.<ref name=\"EmpireTrailer\" /> The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark.<ref name=\"DVDCreatingAbomb\" /> The character also shares Roth's tattoos.<ref name=\"RothMTV\" /> A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II#Match|example]] of [[Mike Tyson]] when he fought [[Evander Holyfield]]), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.<ref name=\"AbombEars\" />\n\nLeterrier had planned to use [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[animatronic]]s to complement the [[computer-generated imagery]] that was solely used in the previous film.<ref name=\"Animatronic\" /> The make-up artists who worked on ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' were set to portray Blonsky's gradual transformation,<ref name=\"RothHulk03\" /> which Zak Penn said would portray Blonsky \"not [being] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [It's all about] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [them].\"<ref name=\"PennBlonsky\" /> Tom Woodruff, Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (who created all the costumes for the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films since ''[[Alien 3]]'') was in negotiations, and created two busts of the Hulk and prosthetic hands to act as stand-ins for the character. A full animatronic was never created as it was decided it would complicate production to set up shots for a puppet and then a computer graphic.<ref name=\"Woodruff\" /> An animatronic was used for Sterns' mutating head, however.<ref name=\"BRDPicture\" /> Destruction was mostly done practically. A model of a bottling machine was smashed through a wall for when the Hulk escapes the factory. The filmmakers used steam and [[dry ice]] for the gas used to smoke out the Hulk, and they destroyed a real Humvee by dropping a weight on it when shooting the Culver University battle. Pipes blew fire for when the Hulk strikes down the computer-generated helicopter. When Banner falls from the helicopter to trigger the Hulk into fighting the Abomination, Norton was attached to a surface held by a bar which turned 90 degrees while the camera was pulled to the ceiling to simulate falling. Leterrier jokingly remarked that making Norton fall that distance would obviously render him unable to act.<ref name=\"DVDAnatomy\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|The Incredible Hulk (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nThe score for the film was composed by [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]], who was the [[arrangement|arranger]] for [[Massive Attack]], a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film ''[[Unleashed (2005 film)|Unleashed]]''. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not knowing if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'').<ref name=\"MusicEye\" /> At Leterrier's suggestion, the soundtrack was released on a two-disc album, which Armstrong thought was a joke until he compiled the album and Marvel asked him why they were given only one disc.<ref name=\"MusicHidden\" /> The film's score borrows [[Joe Harnell]]'s theme \"The Lonely Man\" from the 1978 ''Incredible Hulk'' television series.<ref name=harnell>{{cite web |url= http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |title= The Incredible Hulk: Music From the Television Pilot Movies |website= joeharnell.com |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141229232212/http://joeharnell.com/hulk_pilot-desc.html |archive-date= December 29, 2014 |df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Louis-Leterrier-Incroyable-Hulk-2.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Louis Leterrier]] promoting the film in [[Paris]] in July 2008]]\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=\"We know the Hulk from 2003 didn't satisfy the fans, and we had to acknowledge that.

Entertainment analyst David Davis told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', \"The first Hulk had such high expectations after the [[NBCUniversal]] merger and was supposed to be critical-favorite Ang Lee's breakout commercial blockbuster. Then with the new Hulk film, Marvel was able to underplay the importance of the success after the great success of ''Iron Man'' this summer. So the new one overdelivered, relative to its underpromise.\"<ref name=\"THRBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' earned $55.4 million in its opening weekend, becoming the top film at the box office.<ref name=\"BOMWeekends\" /> Behind ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', it was the second-highest gross for a film released over the [[Father's Day]] weekend.<ref name=\"VarietyBO\" /> This surpassed industry expectations of a $45 million opening, following the disappointing response to the 2003 film. Universal believed [[word of mouth]] would contribute to the film breaking even eventually.<ref name=\"LATimesBO\" />\n\n''The Incredible Hulk'' also opened in 38 other countries, adding $31 million to the total opening. The film outgrossed the 2003 film in South Korea, while its openings in [[Mexico]] and Russia created records for Universal.<ref name=\"VarietyOverseasBO\" /> The film grossed 24 million [[Renminbi|yuan]] (roughly $3.4 million) in its Chinese opening on August 26, outgrossing the previous film's overall gross of 10 million yuan.<ref name=\"ChineseBO\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an approval rating of {{RT data|score}}, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}, based on {{RT data|count}} reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' may not be quite the smashing success that fans of Marvel's raging behemoth might hope for, but it offers more than enough big green action to make up for its occasionally puny narrative.\"<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\" /> [[Metacritic]] gave the film an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" /> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" />\n\nTodd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, \"what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of a big screen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in ''The Incredible Hulk''.\" He emphasized \"it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm,\" and \"penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three\u2014actually six\u2014hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements.\"<ref name=\"McCarthyReview\" /> Rene Rodriguez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' applauded that the film \"does a lot of things [Ang] Lee's ''Hulk'' didn't: it's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity\".<ref name=\"RodriguezReview\" /> Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> [[Lou Lumenick]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said, \"What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [Ang] Lee took\".<ref name=\"LumenickReview\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] was not a fan of the film stating, \"''The Incredible Hulk'' is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's ''Hulk'' too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" />\n\nConversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" /> [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, \"'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean\".<ref name=\"ScottReview\" /> [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, \"Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this \"Hulk\" sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The movie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Sterns\".<ref name=\"AnsenReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award association\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\"| {{Abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" | 2008\n| [[2008 Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice Awards]]\n| Choice Summer Movie: Action\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| <ref name=\"TeenChoice\" />\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[National Movie Awards]]\n| Best Superhero\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|rowspan=\"2\"|<ref name=\"NationalMovieAwards\" />\n|-\n| Best Performance \u2013 Male\n| Edward Norton\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\"|[[2008 Scream Awards|Scream Awards]]\n| Best Fantasy Movie\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| rowspan=\"6\"|<ref name=\"ScreamAwards\" /> \n|-\n| Best Fantasy Actor\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Edward Norton\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Superhero\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Remake\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Line\n| \"Hulk Smash\"\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| Best Comic Book Movie\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 2009\n| [[35th Saturn Awards|Saturn Awards]]\n| [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]\n| ''The Incredible Hulk''\n| {{nom}}\n| <ref name=\"SaturnAwards\" />\n|}\n\n==Future==\n=== Further MCU appearances ===\n{{Further|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|She-Hulk: Attorney at Law {{!}} ''She-Hulk: Attorney at Law''}}\n\n[[Mark Ruffalo]] (Leterrier's first choice before casting Norton<ref name=\"HuffPost\" />) replaced Norton as Banner / Hulk in the MCU beginning in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012), after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton.<ref name=\"NortonReplaced\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineRuffalo\" /> In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.<ref name=\"NortonTHR\" /> Ruffalo also portrayed the character in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015),<ref name=\"RuffaloAoU\" /> ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" /> Ruffalo said Banner was able to have a more prominent role in ''Ragnarok'', ''Infinity War'', and ''Endgame'' because of the lack of a standalone Hulk film, with the character's arc in that film \"feel[ing] like a Hulk movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" /> Ruffalo also made appearances in credits scenes of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013),<ref name=\"RuffaloIM3\" /> ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"RuffaloCM\" /> and ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021).<ref name=\"RuffaloSCLTR\" />\n\nHurt first reprised his role as Thaddeus Ross in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"HurtCivilWar\" /> Ruffalo and Roth both reprised their roles in the [[Disney+]] series ''[[She-Hulk: Attorney at Law]]'' (2022).<ref name=\"RuffaloRothSheHulk\" /> Roth also provided uncredited vocals for Abomination in ''Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings''.<ref name=\"AbominationShangChi\" /> Nelson is set to reprise his role as Samuel Sterns / Leader in ''[[Captain America: New World Order]]'' (2024).<ref name=\"SternsCANWO\" />\n\n===Potential sequel===\nIn March 2008, Norton said \"a lot\" was left out of the film because it had been envisioned as multiple parts, with this film \"intended as chapter one\".<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> Leterrier made the film's final shot of Banner ambiguous; the thought being if there was a sequel, it would mean Banner finally masters control over his anger; if there was not a sequel, the shot indicated instead that he becomes a menace in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"MTVHulkVillainAvengers\" /> Leterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky, human once more, imprisoned and chained in a box,<ref name=\"DVDCommentary\" /> with Feige originally having an idea that the character would be locked in a steel vault that would have been sunk to the bottom of the ocean.<ref name=\"RothOriginalAbominationPlan\" /> The character of Samuel Sterns, played by [[Tim Blake Nelson]], was introduced to set him up as a villain in a possible future film, where he would become the Leader.<ref name=\"June2008Empire\" /><ref name=\"NelsonMTV\" /> Aaron Sims, the lead designer on ''The Incredible Hulk'', also took time to work on concepts for the Leader.<ref name=\"LeaderDesigns\" /> [[Ty Burrell]] was also interested in portraying Doc Samson more faithfully to how he appears in the comics.<ref name=\"MTVHulk2\" />\n\nLeterrier and Roth were originally contracted to return.

He added that Marvel Studios would not consider a sequel until after ''Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it.

But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying the studio wanted to \"save\" one of the original Avengers characters for just the ''Avengers'' films, with the others appearing in their own solo films (Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America) or the films of other (Black Widow and Nick Fury in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'').<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" /> In October, again on a solo film, Feige said, \"We'll see.
