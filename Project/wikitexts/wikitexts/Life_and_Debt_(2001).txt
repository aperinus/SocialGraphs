It examines the economic and social situation in [[Jamaica]], and specifically how the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]'s [[structural adjustment]] policies have impacted the island.\n\n==Content==\n''Life and Debt'' is a 2001 United States documentary film directed by [[Stephanie Black]] about the economic and social situation in [[Jamaica]], and specifically the impact of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank's policies. It starts with the essay \"[[A Small Place]]\" by [[Jamaica Kincaid]].\nThe IMF loans were conditional on structural adjustment policies, which required Jamaica to enact major economic reforms, including trade liberalization, privatization, and deregulation. Reforms were not successful and left Jamaica with $4.6 billion in debt.\nThe film features a number of interviews with former Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]], in which he critiques the system of International Financial Institution loans. He is particularly critical of required structural adjustments as an attack on the sovereignty of many former colonial nations and suggests the system is akin to [[imperialism]] or [[neocolonialism]].\n\n==Cast==\n*  [[Michael Manley]]\n*  [[Jamaica Kincaid]]\n* [[Buju Banton]]\n*  [[Horst K\u00f6hler|Horst K\u1f45hler]]\n*  [[Bill Clinton]]\n*  [[Stanley Fischer]]\n*  [[Yami Bolo]]\n* [[Jerry Rawlings]]\n*  Michael Witter\n*  David Coore\n*  Jean-Bertrand Aristide\n*  Belinda Becker\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = ''Life and Debt'' (2001) by Stephanie Black\n| extra_column    =\n| total_length    =\n| all_writing     =\n| all_lyrics      =\n| all_music       =\n| title1          = G-7\n| note1           = Performed by [[Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers]]\n| writer1         = [[David Marley]]\n| length1         =\n| title2          = One Love\n| note2           = \n| writer2         = Bob Marley\n| length2         =\n| title3          = Work\n| note3           \n| writer3         = [[Bob Marley]]\n| length3         =\n| title4          = Three Little Birds\n| note4           = \n| writer4         = [[Bob Marley]]\n| length4         =\n| title5          = One Love ( The Wailers Original Version)\n| note5           = \n| writer5         = [[Bob Marley]]\n| length5         =\n| title6          = One Love Remix\n| note6           = Remix by [[Bill Laswell]]\n| writer6         = [[Bob Marley]]\n| length6         =\n| title7          = No Woman, No Cry\n| note7           = Performed by [[Dean Fraser]]\n| writer7         = [[Vincent Ford]] [[Bob Marley]]\n| length7         =\n| title8          = Circumstances \n| note8           = \n| writer8         = [[Buju Banton]]\n| length8         =\n| title9          = Destiny\n| note9           = \n| writer9         = [[Buju Banton]]\n| length9         =\n| title10         = Zimbabwe\n| note10          = Performed by Dean Frasier\n| writer10        = [[Bob Marley]]\n| length10        =\n| title11         = Fortunes of Love\n| note11          =\n| writer11        = Suzanne Couch & Brian Jobson\n| length11        =\n| title12         = Chantilly Lace\n| note12          =\n| writer12        = [[J.P.
