The film co-stars [[Karyn Parsons]], [[Steven Martini]] and [[Michael Ironside]]. It is a loose remake of the 1955 film ''[[The Private War of Major Benson]]'', starring [[Charlton Heston]].  ''Major Payne'' was released in the United States on March 24 and grossed $30 million.  Wayans plays a military officer who, after being discharged, attempts to lead a dysfunctional group of youth cadets to victory in a competition.\n\n==Plot==\nMajor Benson Winifred Payne, a battle hardened [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]], returns from a successful drug raid in South America to find out that he has been passed over for promotion. Payne receives an [[honorable discharge]] and tries to adjust to civilian life but ends up being arrested.  His former commander gets him out of jail and secures him a position back in the military.\n\nPayne is sent to Madison Preparatory School in [[Virginia]] and is given command of the  [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] students.  The cadets are a disorderly group of delinquents and outcasts who have placed last in the Virginia Military Games for eight straight years.  Payne immediately takes a hard stance with the cadets and asserts his authority.  He shaves the cadets bald and moves them out of their dorms and into a dilapidated barracks.  Payne's harsh punishments and lack of empathy for the cadets lead to friction with school counselor Emily Walburn, who tries to soften Payne's approach.\n\nThe cadets, encouraged by the rebellious Alex Stone, make several attempts to sabotage Payne and drive him out of the school.  Stone and the cadets hire a biker to assault Payne, in the aftermath Payne makes Stone the squad leader.  Things come to a head and Payne offers to quit if the cadets can steal him the Military Games trophy from Wellington Academy.  Payne tips off the Wellington cadets and they ambush the Madison cadets and beat them severely.  Stone confronts Payne and realizes that he wants to earn the trophy, Payne offers to train him to win it.  The cadets begin working hard and training for the Military Games.  They develop into a unified squad, and Payne tells them that they have graduated the program and are fit to compete in the games.\n\nBefore the games, Payne is asked to return to the Marines to fight in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].  He eagerly accepts the new posting but his deployment means he will miss the Military Games.  As Payne waits for a train to depart he daydreams about being in a family with Emily and Tiger.  The cadets don't want to participate in the Games without Payne, but Alex convinces them to do it.  At the games, the boys hold their own until Alex injures his ankle and is unable to participate in the final event. The Madison cadets angrily fight with the Wellington cadets. The fight is broken up, and the judges deliberate having Madison disqualified.\n\nPayne refuses his new posting and commission and shows up at the last minute.  He smooths things over with the judges and tells Tiger to lead Madison in the final event, a drill competition. The group executes an unorthodox but entertaining routine which wins them the trophy. On the first day of the new school year Madison displays the Military Games trophy, along with another one won by Alex.  Payne resumes being an instructor, having married Emily and adopted Tiger. Stone resumes his role as a squad leader. Payne has softened a bit, attempting to befriend the new recruits. When a disrespectful blind cadet shows up with his service dog, Payne shaves both him and his dog bald with his field knife and laughs.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Damon Wayans]] as [[Major]] Benson Winifred Payne, a battle-hardened Marine.

Of course the arc of the storyline is familiar; we know the pretty teacher will soften him, and that he will grow fond of the cadets, and no prizes for guessing who wins the big all-Virginia ROTC [''[[sic]]''] competition... Wayans is one of the most talented comic actors around, especially when he lets go and swings for the fences.<ref name=Ebert /></blockquote>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at number 2 at the US box office behind ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'' with a gross of $7 million on its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Major Payne' Marches to the Bank|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-28/entertainment/ca-48010_1_major-payne|access-date=2012-06-04}}</ref> ''Major Payne'' went on to gross $30.1 million worldwide.<ref name=mojo>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=majorpayne.htm|title=Major Payne|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Major Payne}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0110443|title=Major Payne}}\n* {{Amg movie|134574|Major Payne}}\n\n{{Nick Castle}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:Remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about educators]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Military humor in film]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Army]]\n[[Category:Films about the United States Marine Corps]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Nick Castle]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Craig Safan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Films set in boarding schools]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
