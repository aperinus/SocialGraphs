Set at the turn of the millennium in the shadow of a world-changing catastrophe, the film follows a man and woman, played by [[William Hurt]] and [[Solveig Dommartin]], as they are pursued across the globe, in a plot involving a device that can record visual experiences and visualize dreams. An initial draft of the screenplay was written by American filmmaker [[Michael Almereyda]], but the final screenplay is credited to Wenders and [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], from a story by Wenders and Dommartin. Wenders, whose career had been distinguished by his exploration of the [[road movie]], intended this as the ultimate example of the genre.\n\nThe film has been released in several editions, ranging in length from 158 to 287 minutes.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|film|date=July 2022}}\n\n===Act 1===\nIn 1999, a worldwide panic ensues when an orbiting Indian nuclear satellite goes out of control and begins to spiral toward the Earth, as it is not known where the satellite will ultimately crash land. Claire Tourneur, however, who has been traveling around Europe trying, unsuccessfully, to distract herself after discovering that her boyfriend slept with her best friend, is unconcerned by the impending nuclear disaster, though her sleep has been troubled by a recurring nightmare. When she gets stuck in a [[traffic jam]] that develops in the south of France after it is projected as a possible impact site, she escapes the highway congestion by taking a side road. She gets into an automobile accident with a pair of surprisingly-friendly bank robbers, who enlist her to carry their stolen cash to [[Paris]], in exchange for a cut of the loot. Along the way, she meets a man who introduces himself as Trevor McPhee. He is being followed by an armed man named Burt, so Claire agrees to let Trevor travel to Paris with her. After reaching the house of her estranged lover, Eugene, Claire discovers that Trevor stole some of the stolen money while she slept.\n\nClaire crosses paths with Burt and is able to find out that he is going to [[Berlin]]. She makes the trip as well and hires missing-persons detective Phillip Winter to help her locate Trevor. Using his computer, he learns that Trevor has a substantial bounty on his head for stealing [[opal]] from a mining syndicate in Australia, and access to Trevor's passport and financial information allows him to determine the man has just boarded a flight to [[Lisbon]]. When Claire and Winter catch up with Trevor, Winter handcuffs Trevor to Claire, but she voluntarily goes along with Trevor when he runs away. They go to a hotel, where Winter finds them having sex, though Trevor is able to handcuff both Winter and Claire to the bed and escape with more of Claire's money.\n\nStill after the bounty, Winter takes Claire with him to [[Moscow]], where they meet up with Eugene, who Claire has asked to bring her more money. A local bounty hunter with a more advanced computer than Winter has helps them discover that Trevor is actually Sam Farber, who is wanted by the U.S. government for industrial espionage and has a significantly larger bounty on his head than Trevor McPhee does. Winter says he is quitting the job and going home, and Eugene buys a tracking computer to help Claire, who sees Burt again and learns that Sam is wanted for stealing a camera he had helped develop at a lab in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].\n\nWhen Sam buys a ticket to [[Beijing]] on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], the computer alerts Claire and she leaves Eugene while she thinks he is sleeping. Sam evades Claire, and she ends up traveling through China alone for months. She finally calls Eugene, who tells her to go to [[Tokyo]] and meets her there. They go to the [[capsule hotel]] where Sam is supposed to be staying, only to find a tied-up Winter and get shot at by various bounty hunters and international government agents who have been tipped off by the bounty hunter they consulted in Moscow. Claire is able to escape and happens upon Sam, who is rapidly losing his eyesight, at a [[pachinko]] parlor. She buys them train tickets to a random mountain inn, where the kindly innkeepers provide herbs that heal Sam's eyes. Sam reveals to Claire that the prototype camera he stole was invented by his father, Henry, and is a device that, by recording brain impulses of the photographer for later transfer, takes pictures blind people can see. Though the recording process is hard on his eyes, he has been traveling around the world making recordings of places and people that are important to his mother, Edith, who is blind, so she can see them.\n\nThe next stop on Sam's itinerary is [[San Francisco]]. He and Claire get robbed by a used car salesman shortly after arriving, so Claire calls Chico, one of the French bank robbers, for help, and he brings more money. Sam cannot get the camera to work when he is trying to make a recording of his sister and niece, so Claire takes over. The final recording done, Sam, Claire, and Chico board a small boat to Australia, where Sam's parents are.\n\n===Act 2===\nEugene and Winter, who teamed up and went to [[Coober Pedy]], Australia, to wait for Claire and Sam after losing track of them in Tokyo,{{efn|Because Sam had been traveling as Trevor McPhee, who was wanted for stealing opals, and most opals are mined around Coober Pedy, Winter figured Sam's trip had probably started somewhere near there and he would come back through eventually.}} pick up the trail when Claire uses her credit card to place a video call nearby. When Eugene sees Sam in town, he punches Sam and they have a brief fight before they are arrested. While Winter tries to bail them out, Burt arrives looking for Sam and the camera, but Chico is able to subdue him. The next day, Sam only takes Claire with him when he takes off to fly to the compound where his parents are hiding and his father has built a secret lab, but the others are able to follow thanks to a secret tracking device that is still on the bag Chico gave to Claire when she first transported the money to Paris.\n\nWhile Claire and Sam are in the air, the Indian nuclear satellite is shot down by the U.S. government, and the resulting [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|NEMP]] effect wipes the memories of and interferes with the functioning of unshielded electronics. The engine of his plane stops, so Sam has to execute an emergency landing. He and Claire walk across the desert until they are found by Sam's friend David, who has Eugene, Winter, and Chico in the bed of his hand-cranked diesel-powered truck. David takes everyone to Sam's father's lab, which is sheltered in a massive cave. Burt eventually arrives as well and everyone settles in to wait and see whether communications with the outside world will be restored. Eugene, who was writing a novel about Claire and her adventures before it was erased from his computer by the NEMP, begins rewriting it on an antique typewriter.\n\nThe process Henry developed requires the person who recorded the images to watch them while being monitored in the lab before they can be transmitted to someone else's brain. Sam, who has a strained relationship with his father, attempts to do this immediately after arriving,{{efn|David had taken the camera from Claire and left with it while Sam was in jail, and the viewer is not told where it was during the NEMP and why the recordings were not wiped.}} but he fails because he is too tired to perform well, which leads to an argument with Henry. Claire tries the experiment with her recording of Sam's sister with phenomenal success, and Sam later succeeds with his recordings. Although Edith is at first exhilarated to be able to \"see\" again, the ugly, pixellated images she receives begin to contribute to her growing despondency. On [[New Year's Eve]], the same evening the group have intercepted a mundane radio broadcast that indicates human civilization has not ended, she \"just let[s] go\" and passes away quietly.\n\nAfter Edith's burial, Winter, Chico, and Burt leave the compound to go home. Henry, hoping to win a [[Nobel Prize]], begins working on how to use his technology to record human dreams, but the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] who have been assisting him disagree with this turn in the research and abandon him. He continues by experimenting on himself, Sam, and Claire, who eventually become addicted to viewing their dreams on portable video screens. Eugene finds a catatonic Claire and takes her away from the lab, driving her into painful withdrawal when he refuses to replace the batteries for her screen. He finishes his novel, in which he writes her as being healthy and happy, and gives it to her, using the \"truth of the words\" to cure her of the \"disease of images\". Meanwhile, Sam wanders away from the lab and is ultimately cured by David and an Aboriginal ritual, and Henry is taken by the CIA while lying in the lab's dream-recording chair.\n\nEugene and Claire break up for good, but remain friends. Henry later dies in 2001, with Sam visiting his grave. While in San Francisco, Sam sees his wife (who has since remarried) and son from a distance, realizing that he has lost them forever. On Claire's 30th birthday, Eugene's book comes out and he, Winter, and the French bank robbers call Claire, who is in the middle of a six-month stint as an ecological observer on a space station, to sing her \"Happy Birthday\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Solveig Dommartin]] as Claire Tourneur\n* Chick Ortega as Chico R\u00e9my\n* [[Eddy Mitchell]] as Raymond Monnet\n* [[William Hurt]] as Sam Farber, alias Trevor McPhee\n* [[Adelle Lutz]] as Makiko\n* [[Ernie Dingo]] as Burt\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Eugene Fitzpatrick\n* [[R\u00fcdiger Vogler]] as Philip Winter\n* Elena Smirnova as Krasikova\n* [[Kuniko Miyake]] as Mrs. Mori\n* [[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] as Mr. Mori\n* [[Allen Garfield]] as Used-Car Dealer\n* [[Lois Chiles]] as Elsa Farber\n* [[David Gulpilil]] as David\n* [[Jeanne Moreau]] as Edith Farber\n* [[Jimmy Little]] as Peter\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Henry Farber<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/94535/Until-the-End-of-the-World/ TCM.com]</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nWenders began working on the film as early as late 1977, when, during his first visit to Australia, it struck him that his surroundings would be the perfect setting for a science fiction film. In addition to fleshing out the complex plot, preproduction also involved extensive still photography. It was not until Wenders found commercial success with ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' and ''[[Wings of Desire]]'', however, that he was able to secure funding for the project.\n\nWith a budget of around $22&nbsp;million ($3.7&nbsp;million of which came from he Australian Film Finance Corporation<ref>Bob Evans, \"Our Piece of the Action\", ''The Australian Financial Review'', 18 October 1991, p. 33</ref>), which was more than he had spent on all of his previous films combined, Wenders set off on an ambitious production. Principal photography lasted 22 weeks and spanned 11 countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wenders |first1=Wim |last2=Hagen |first2=Charles |title=From The End of the World To Smack Dab in the Middle: An Interview with Wim Wenders |journal=Aperture |volume=123 |issue=Spring 1991 |pages=90\u201391 |jstor=24472429 |year=1991 }}</ref> Wenders, who had a long-standing fascination with the [[Australian Outback]], shot a substantial amount of the film in and around [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]], Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=14 films coming to Australia from the Toronto Film Festival|work=[[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] (Australia)|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2017/09/25/14-films-coming-australia-toronto-film-festival|date=25 September 2017|access-date=25 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe imagery in the dream sequences were achieved with early [[high-definition video]]. Wenders and technicians at [[NHK]] (the only facility which could play back HD video at the time) worked for six weeks on these sequences, intentionally distorting the imagery to create strange visual effects. They often recorded a fast-forwarded version of the image, then played it back at normal speed.\n\n[[Graeme Revell]] composed the theme and other music for the film. For additional music, Wenders commissioned original songs from a number of his favorite recording artists, asking them to anticipate the kind of music they would be making a decade later, when the film was set.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://film.avclub.com/the-until-the-end-of-the-world-soundtrack-promised-a-hi-1798252365|title=The Until The End of the World soundtrack promised a hipper future|website=Film|date=21 September 2016 |language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> His desire to use all of the pieces he received contributed to his decision to make the film as long as it turned out to be.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trailersfromhell.com/the-strange-case-of-until-the-end-of-the-world-cinesavant-archive-articles/|title=The Strange Case of Until the End of the World: CineSavant Archive Articles|date=2019-11-30|website=Trailers From Hell|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe truncated version of ''Until the End of the World'' that received a theatrical release was poorly received, being both a critical and commercial failure.

He went on to say that a documentary about the globe-trekking production would likely have been more interesting than the film itself.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/until-the-end-of-the-world-1992 |title=Until the End of the World Movie Review (1992) |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=1992-01-17 |access-date=2016-10-15}}</ref>\n\nLater critics \u2013 some responding to Wenders' director's cut \u2013 were more favorable toward it.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an 88% approval rating based on 17 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Until the End of the World (Bis ans Ende der Welt) (1992) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/until_the_end_of_the_world |access-date=2021-09-11 }}</ref>\n\n==Versions==\nThe initial cut of the film was, reportedly, 20 hours long.<ref name=\"DVDB-2019\">{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |title=Until the End of the World\n |url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-until-the-end-of-the-world-william-hurt/3630737?ean=0715515239110&st=AFF&SID=www.barnesandnoble.com |website=Barnes & Noble|access-date=30 October 2022}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=October 2022}} Several shortened versions of the film have been commercially distributed or publicly screened. Wenders was contractually obligated by his backers to deliver a standard feature-length film, so he edited it down to the 158- and 179-minute American and European cuts, which he refers to as the \"''[[Reader's Digest Condensed Books|Reader's Digest]]''\" versions of the film. Meanwhile, he and his editor Peter Przygodda secretly made a complete copy of the film negatives for themselves at their own expense,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2015/10/20/wim-wenders-looking-back-on-t.html|title=Wim Wenders: Looking back on the road ahead|last=Stewart-Ahn|first=Aaron|date=2015-10-20|website=Boing Boing|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talkhouse.com/aaron-stewart-ahn-talks-his-25-year-relationship-with-wim-wenders-until-the-end-of-the-world/|title=Aaron Stewart-Ahn Talks His 25-Year Relationship with Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World|website=Talkhouse|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> and over the next year they worked on a 5-hour version of the film, which they then screened at events over the next decade.
