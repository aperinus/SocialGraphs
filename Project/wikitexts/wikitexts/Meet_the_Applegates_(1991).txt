It was filmed during 1988-89, but not released in the United States until 1991 due to the financial difficulties surrounding [[New World Pictures]], the film's production company. It takes a dark, satirical look at the end of the world, nuclear holocausts, alienism and terrorism. It was filmed in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]], [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] and [[Neenah, Wisconsin]]. It has gained a cult following.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in a forest with a family being attacked by a family of huge [[shapeshifting]] mutant bug creatures called, \"[[Mantis|Brazilian Cocorada]]\". It then moves to a typical-looking family called the Applegates moving into a well-off suburban [[Ohio]] neighborhood. It is revealed that the Applegates are secretly exploring human society on a mission to eradicate the humans.\n\nThey are tasked with assimilating into the human culture. The Applegates have moved to the suburbs after the husband, Dick, got a job at a [[nuclear power]] plant. It is revealed that Dick is secretly working on a plan to cause a nuclear explosion that will rid the world of humans and leave the bugs in peace.\n\nThe Applegates start off living the All American dream. Dick is the patriarch loving father and major bread earner, while Jane is his loving wife and mother to \"Johnny\" and Sally. Johnny is initially a strait-laced A student but begins listening to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and becomes a pot-head. Sally starts out as the all American stereotype high school girl dating Vince Samson who is captain of the football team.\n\nDick and Jane's \"perfect\" marriage begins to crumble as they drift from each other. Dick begins having an affair at work and Jane becomes addicted to shopping and credit cards. While Johnny begins smoking [[marijuana]] with his metalhead buddies, Johnny accidentally displays his true bug form. In a panic, he cocoons his friends and hides them. Sally, while being raped by Vince, displays her true form. Also in a panic, she cocoons him and hides him in the basement. As they drift away from normality and their mission, their aunt, Bea, is dispatched to get the family back on track with their mission.\n\nChaos ensues when Dick's affair with his secretary leads to them both getting fired and his lover deciding to blackmail him. Dick in panic cocoons her and hides her in his basement. Jane is then accosted by two representatives from the credit card company for failure to pay her mounting card bills and she cocoons the men and hides them away. Jane panics and in an effort to pay off her debts tries to rob a local convenience store but is caught by the sheriff while fleeing the scene. With no other options she cocoons the sheriff and returns to the family house. Johnny walks in on her hiding the sheriff.\n\nSally enters and is revealed to be a lesbian, having become disillusioned with men after her interaction with Vince. The Applegates go into freefall when Jane's spending results in their possessions being repossessed. In a twist, just as they are at their lowest, a journalist and photographer enter to notify them that they have won a prize for being the most normal American family. However, after spotting Sally's pregnancy they attempt to rescind the prize.  In the struggle the journalist pushes Sally over, which induces labour.  She gives birth to a large insect egg, which rolls towards the journalist.  Disgusted, he stomps on it and kills it. They are quickly cocooned and hidden away.\n\nBea arrives and is shocked at the Applegates status. He then attempts to forge ahead with the mission but after the family realize they have grown to like living amongst the humans they decide they must prevent Bea from completing the mission. Dick intervenes and in the struggle he kills Bea, preventing the nuclear explosion. They save the town and humans.\n\nAt the end of the movie they return to their lives in Brazil and are visited by the townspeople that grew to love them. Although the plant did not blow up, enough radiation was released to remove the hair from much of the town's population.\n\nA scene before the credits reveals that Aunt Bea survived and still intends to destroy the world.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Richard Peter \"Dick\" Applegate<ref>{{cite news|last=Slate|first=Libby|title=Begley Crusade: Don't Pollute|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-26-ca-106-story.html|date=May 26, 1990|accessdate=August 14, 2021}}</ref>\n*[[Stockard Channing]] as Jane Applegate\n*[[Dabney Coleman]] as Aunt Bea Cocorada/Ralph Carpenter\n*[[Robert Jayne]] as John Richard \"Johnny\" Applegate\n*Camille Cooper as Sally Applegate\n*[[Glenn Shadix]] as Gregory \"Greg\" Samson\n*Adam Biesk as Vince Sampson\n*Susan Barnes as Opal Withers\n*[[Roger Aaron Brown]] as Sheriff Heidegger\n*[[Lee Garlington]] as Nita Samson\n\n==Release==\n''Meet the Applegates'' was released in the Philippines by First Films as ''The Applegates'' on June 6, 1990, with \"[f]ree cassette tapes to lucky patrons.\"<ref name=\"Manila Standard\"/> ''Meet the Applegates'' was released in the United States by Triton Pictures on February 1, 1991.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 10% based on reviews from 10 critics, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.2/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Applegates (1990)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/applegates|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=August 14, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe film was met with mixed reception.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rainer|first=Peter|title=Movie Review: 'Applegates': All-American Alien Invasion|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-02-01-ca-190-story.html|date=February 1, 1991|accessdate=August 14, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Meet the Applegates - Review/Film - Movies|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Meet the Applegates|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19910201/REVIEWS/102010301/1023|date=February 1, 1991|accessdate=August 14, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0100129}}\n*{{Allmovie title|2700}}\n\n{{Michael Lehmann}}\n\n[[Category:1990s comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Fictional families]]\n[[Category:Films about insects]]\n[[Category:Films about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Lehmann]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Denise Di Novi]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:New World Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American pregnancy films]]\n[[Category:1990 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
