Sequel to 2013's ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods|Battle of Gods]]''. It is the [[List of Dragon Ball films|nineteenth film based on]] the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' series, the fifteenth to carry the ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' branding, and is the second film in the franchise to be personally supervised by series creator [[Akira Toriyama]]. The film's plot depicts the return of the villain [[Frieza]], who after his resurrection via the eponymous Dragon Balls, goes into extensive training with the purpose to enact his revenge against Goku.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on April 18, 2015. It is the first Japanese film to be screened in [[IMAX 3D]] and receive screenings at [[4DX]] theaters. The film saw a [[limited theatrical release]] in North American theaters between August 4 through August 13, 2015. [[Madman Entertainment]] released the film in Australian theaters on August 6, where it ran through until August 19, 2015. [[Manga Entertainment]] acquired the rights for the release in the United Kingdom in September 2015. It was also released in India in November 2015. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the quality of animation and the fast-paced action sequences, although its plot received some criticism.\n\nThe film was later adapted into the [[List of Dragon Ball Super episodes#Golden Frieza Saga (2015\u201316)|second story arc]] of ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', with the addition of extra scenes and subplots set before its events.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nThe alien [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Sorbet|Sorbet]], commander of the remnants of [[Frieza]]'s [[military]], travels to Earth where [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Pilaf Gang|the Pilaf Gang]] are forced to collect and use the [[magic (supernatural)|magical]] Dragon Balls to summon the wish-granting eternal dragon [[Shenlong (Dragon Ball)|Shenron]] to resurrect Frieza. However, due to Frieza having been killed when [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Future Trunks]] chopped him up with his sword, he is revived in many pieces which Sorbet's minions manage to reassemble using their advanced technology. Once restored and back in command of his forces, Frieza abuses some of his minions and plots revenge against the Super Saiyans. Upon learning that [[Goku]] has grown far more powerful over time, Frieza postpones the invasion so he can train himself for the first time.\n\n[[Jaco the Galactic Patrolman]] travels to Earth to warn [[Bulma]] that Frieza is approaching and with Goku and [[Vegeta]] away training with [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Whis|Whis]] on the [[Beerus]]' planet, [[Gohan]], [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]], [[Krillin]], [[Master Roshi]], [[Tien Shinhan]] and Jaco assemble to resist Frieza's conquest and they fight and defeat thousands of his soldiers. Having greatly increased his power as the result of his training, Frieza overwhelms the warriors but Bulma is successful in making contact with Whis, notifying Goku and Vegeta of Frieza's return. The Saiyans return to Earth, rescue their allies, and face Frieza while Whis and Beerus watch on. Goku fights Frieza first and quickly gains the advantage but the latter deduces that he is holding back, so the two foes agree to fight at full power. Goku transforms into a new godly Super Saiyan form with a glowing blue hair and aura (later dubbed Super Saiyan Blue) and Frieza assumes his new gold-plated form, which he dubs ''Golden Frieza''. Although Frieza initially gains the upper hand, Goku soon realizes that Frieza's [[qi|energy]] drains quickly due to his lack of experience with the golden form.\n\nGoku eventually bests Frieza in battle and gives him an opportunity to leave Earth, but is blasted in the chest by Sorbet's [[raygun]] when his guard is lowered. Frieza stands over the incapacitated Goku, and offers Vegeta a chance to kill him in order to become his second-in-command. Vegeta refuses, transforms into Super Saiyan Blue, and attacks Frieza. When Krillin attempts to revive Goku with a healing Senzu bean, Frieza attacks him, but Vegeta deflects the energy blast which subsequently kills Sorbet. Vegeta dominates Frieza who is humiliated and proceeds to launch a surprise energy blast into the Earth, completely destroying it and subsequently killing Vegeta. Goku, Beerus, and the others are shielded by Whis and left floating in space on a small patch of earth where they lament on the loss. Whis remarks that he has the ability to [[time travel|reverse time]] up to three minutes and, after doing so, Goku quickly kills Frieza with a ''Kamehameha'' wave; much to Vegeta's anger.\n\nIn the aftermath, Goku and Vegeta discuss the assertion by Whis that, if the two of them were to properly learn to work together, opponents like Frieza would be defeated much easier. Vegeta scoffs and indicates that he would rather die and Goku humorously agrees. Vegeta remarks that it is about time they finally agree on something. In a [[post-credits scene]], Frieza returns to [[Hell]], and to his dismay, is welcomed back.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMCAST]], list only major characters per production notes -->\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|- style=\"background:rgb(255,85,0);\"\n!Character{{efn|In the closing credits, the English cast were listed with the characters' English names (e.g. Goku, Master Roshi, Krillin), while the Japanese cast were listed with Japanese names (e.g. Son Goku, Turtle Hermit, Kuririn). }}\n!Japanese voice actor<ref name=\"prod notes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2015/08/04/dragon-ball-z-resurrection-f-production-notes/|title=DRAGON BALL Z: RESURRECTION 'F' Production Notes|author=Funimation|work=[[SciFi JAPAN TV|SciFi Japan]]|date=August 4, 2015|access-date=August 14, 2015}}</ref>\n!English voice actor<ref name=\"prod notes\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[Goku]]\n|[[Masako Nozawa]]\n|[[Sean Schemmel]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|[[Vegeta]]\n|[[Ry\u014d Horikawa]]\n|[[Christopher Sabat|Christopher R.
