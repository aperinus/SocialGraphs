The film abruptly flashes back to a few weeks before, to a Chinese restaurant that employs a high school boy named Arthur, his ex-babysitter, Annie, and her best friend, Barb. Arthur, who's a bit of a misfit, has a troubled home life caused by his constantly clashing parents, both of whom often forget about him. Annie's life isn't faring much better: she's dealing with her ill mother, is separated from her husband, Glenn, and is now raising their young daughter, Tara, on her own. Glenn is now on the wagon and becoming a born-again Christian in order to prove that he is responsible enough to spend time with Tara.\n\nDepressed and lonely, Annie decides to betray her best friend by having an affair with Barb's husband, Nate, but finds that ruining Barb's life doesn't make her own life any happier. Desperate to prove himself and still harboring deep feelings for his estranged wife (though he suspects is seeing someone), Glenn gets a new job and spends as much time as possible with Tara. Meanwhile, Arthur finds himself growing close to Lila, a new student at the high school who has a knack for photography.\n \nThe film focuses heavily on how people's lives can cross in a small town, especially when Tara wanders out of the house and goes missing while Annie, drained over having meaninglessly destroyed her friendship with Barb and suffering from a bad cold, falls asleep on the couch. The whole town spends hours desperately searching for Tara, before Arthur finds her body while smoking pot with his friend. To everyone's horror, Tara had fallen into open freezing water at the edge of the lake while playing and drowned, after which the open water froze over her. Glenn distraught over the death of his little girl, Tara, breaks into Annie's home with his shotgun and waits for her return.  Upon Annie's return Glenn grabs her \nand forcibly washes her feet.   Covering her mouth as she cries and screams at him, he drags a barefoot Annie by the collar into the snowy woods. With her kneeling, back turned to him, Glenn holds his gun to her head and tells her to say when she's ready (to be shot). The movie presumably ends with their murder-suicide, explaining the shots heard before the flashback.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kate Beckinsale]] as Annie Marchand\n*[[Sam Rockwell]] as Glenn Marchand\n*[[Michael Angarano]] as Arthur Parkinson\n*[[Jeannetta Arnette]] as Louise Parkinson\n*[[Griffin Dunne]] as Don Parkinson\n*[[Nicky Katt]] as Nate Petite\n*[[Tom Noonan]] as Mr. Chervenick\n*[[Connor Paolo]] as Warren Hardesky\n*[[Amy Sedaris]] as Barb Petite\n*[[Olivia Thirlby]] as Lila Raybern\n*Grace Hudson<!--- not the painter born in the 19th century ---> as Tara Marchand\n\n==Production==\nFilming, in-part, occurred on-location in Nova Scotia, Canada.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = https://people.com/parents/kate-beckinsa-3/\n |archive-url  = https://archive.today/20120707211058/http://celebritybabies.people.com/2008/03/16/kate-beckinsa-3/#\n |date         = 16 March 2008\n |archive-date = 2012-07-07\n |access-date   = 29 August 2018\n |title        = Kate Beckinsale discusses having children and Lily's career choices\n |publisher    = [[People (magazine)|People]]\n |df           = \n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics.
