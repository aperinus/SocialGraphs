The story follows [[Tetsuya Watari]] as the reformed yakuza [[Contract killing|hitman]] \"Phoenix\" Tetsu who is forced to roam Japan avoiding execution by rival gangs.\n\n==Plot==\nAn old ''[[yakuza]]'' boss named Kurata decides to retire from his criminal activities and disbands his gang. His fiercely loyal enforcer, Tetsuya \"Phoenix Tetsu\" Hondo, finds himself unable to enjoy a life outside of [[organized crime]]. He is hounded by a rival gang after turning down a recruitment offer by its boss, Otsuka.<ref name=Berra>Berra (2010), 282.</ref> Otsuka sees Kurata's retirement as an opportunity to seize his territory via a real estate scam, seeing Tetsu as a threat to his plans. Kurata is eventually forced to convince Tetsu to become a [[Vagabond (person)|drifter]].<ref name=Berra/>\n\nOtsuka sends his hitman \"Viper\" Tatsuzo to kill Tetsu, who evades him and Otsuka's hit squad a number of times with help from a former Otsuka gang member named Kenji. Tetsu later reaches the establishment of Kurata's ally Umetani, who reveals that Kurata joined forces with Otsuka and placed a bounty on Tetsu's head. A betrayed Tetsu returns to [[Tokyo]] for a final confrontation with Otsuka, killing everyone but his former girlfriend Chiharu, and Kurata takes his own life to redeem himself. Tetsu rejects Chiharu's plea for her to accompany him on his travels, explaining that he has dedicated himself to the wanderer lifestyle and could not abandon it for another's company.<ref name=Berra/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tetsuya Watari]] as Tetsuya \"Phoenix Tetsu\" Hondo\n* [[Chieko Matsubara]] as Chiharu\n* [[Hideaki Nitani]] as Kenji Aizawa\n* [[Tamio Kawaji]] as Tatsuzo The Viper\n* [[Tsuyoshi Yoshida]] as Keiichi\n* [[Ry\u016bji Kita]] as Kurata\n* [[Hideaki Esumi]] as Otsuka\n* [[Eiji Go]] as Tanaka\n\n==Production==\n[[Nikkatsu]] bosses had been warning Suzuki to tone down his bizarre visual style for years and drastically reduced ''Tokyo Drifter'''s budget in hopes of getting results. This had the opposite effect in that Suzuki and [[art director]] Takeo Kimura pushed themselves to new heights of [[surrealism]] and absurdity. The studio's next move was to impose the further restriction of filming in black and white on his next two films, which again Suzuki met with even greater bizarreness culminating in his dismissal for \"incomprehensibility\".<ref>Desjardins (2005), 136\u2013149.</ref>\n\nBecause of budget limitations, Suzuki had to cut connecting shots out of many fights, leading to a need for more creative camera work.<ref name=Pratt/>\n\nVarious shots of [[Tokyo]] were used to establish the setting as the then-contemporary post-1964 Japan.<ref name=Standish/> Suzuki drew inspiration from a wide variety of sources in making ''Tokyo Drifter'', including the [[musical film]]s of the [[1950s in film|1950s]], [[pop art]], [[Absurdism|absurdist comedy]], and [[Surrealism|surrealist film]].<ref name=Vryzidis1/>\n\n==Themes==\nSuzuki displays common themes found in Yakuza films, particularly the theme of loyalty, in order to parody the message and presentation of traditional [[Yakuza film]]s. He uses his depictions of Yakuza relationships to show the inherent weakness of the archetype, particularly the possible abuses of power that can arise from unquestioning allegiance.<ref name=Standish>Standish (2005), 300.</ref> Further, the common theme of [[corporate corruption]] is also parodied through exaggeration when the main character becomes an expendable retainer.<ref name=Standish2>Standish (2005), 301.</ref> The conventions in the film further parody the conformity of theme and structure apparent in all [[Japanese film]], but especially in Yakuza films of the time,<ref name=Vryzidis1/> particularly its excesses.<ref name=Bleiler>Bleiler (2004), 632.</ref>\n\n==Style==\nThe [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] of ''Tokyo Drifter'' is highly stylized.<ref name=Standish3>Standish (2005), 304.</ref> Film reviewer Nikolaos Vryzidis claims that the film crosses over into a number of different genres, but most resembles the [[avant-garde]] films occurring in the 1960s.<ref name=Vryzidis1>Vryzidis (2010), 282.</ref>\n\nAt times, the film draws a good deal of inspiration from [[westerns]]. The whistling of the main character Tetsu is reminiscent of cowboy heroes. Near the middle of the film, a large bar fight erupts; this scene is meant to directly parody western films, everyone in the [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] joins in the brawl against [[United States Navy]] sailors, and comical violence is used where no one is permanently injured, despite the large-scale violence of the scene.<ref name=Vryzidis2/>\n\nThe majority of the film takes place in [[Tokyo]], but portrays the city in a highly stylized manner.<ref name=Barber1>Barber (2005), 124.</ref> The opening sequence consists of a mash of images from metropolitan Tokyo, meant to condense the feeling of the city into one sequence.<ref name=Barber2>Barber (2005), 125.</ref>\n\nThe film opens in stylized [[black and white]], which becomes vibrant color in all subsequent scenes.<ref name=Vryzidis2>Vryzidis (2010), 283.</ref> This served to represent Tokyo post-[[1964 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=Barber2/>\n\n==Reception==\nVryzidis claims that Suzuki's later films, once the studio gave him more freedom, never reached the same level of artistic quality as ''Tokyo Drifter'', where the studio attempted to impose a large amount of control over the project.<ref name=Vryzidis2/> Tetsu, the main character of the film, has also been well received. One reviewer commented that he always looks \"cool\", even when he is not the toughest guy in the room.<ref name=Bleiler/>\n\nStephen Barber called the visualization in ''Tokyo Drifter'' \"bizarre and individual\".<ref name=Barber1/> Douglass Pratt praised the film for its quirkiness and character.<ref name=Pratt>Pratt (2005), 1246.</ref> He further stated that the plot of the film does not matter so much as \"the gorgeous Pop Art sets, the bizarre musical sequences, the confusing but ballistic action scenes and the film's gunbutt attitude.\"<ref name=Pratt/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe film is considered ahead of its time, as it abandoned the themes of the [[Yakuza film#Ninkyo eiga|Ninkyo eiga]] films popular at the time, and combines with themes from the later [[Yakuza film#Jitsuroku eiga|Jitsuroku eiga]] Yakuza films, which disavowed the romantic and nostalgic views of the Yakuza in favor of social criticism.<ref name=Standish2/>\n\n==Home video==\n[[The Criterion Collection]] released the film outside Japan in [[DVD]] format in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/films/577|title=Tokyo Drifter|year=2010|work=Online Cinematheque|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|accessdate=26 April 2010|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>  Criterion also released a Blu-ray version in 2013.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\nThe film has a recurrent appearance of Tetsu's girlfriend as a lounge singer repeating several times her signature song throughout the film.\n\n==Tokyo Drifter 2: The Sea is Bright Red as the Color of Love==\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Tokyo Drifter 2: The Sea is Bright Red as the Color of Love\n| image          =\n| director       = Kenjir\u014d Morinaga\n| writer         = \n| screenplay     = Keihan Ono, Daigo Mitsushiro\n| story          = \n| based_on       = \n| music          = [[Hajime Kaburagi]]\n| starring       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Tetsuya Watari]]\n* [[Chieko Matsubara]]\n* [[Nobuo Kaneko]] \n}}\n| distributor    = [[Nikkatsu]]\n| released       = {{film date|1966|11|9|Japan}}\n| runtime        = 73 minutes\n| country        = Japan\n| language       = Japanese\n}}\n{{nihongo|'''''Tokyo Drifter 2: The Sea is Bright Red as the Color of Love'''''|\u7d9a\u6771\u4eac\u6d41\u308c\u8005 \u6d77\u306f\u771f\u3063\u8d64\u306a\u604b\u306e\u8272|''Zoku T\u014dky\u014d nagaremono Umiwa Makkana Koinoiro''}} is a 1966 Japanese [[crime film]] and sequel to Tokyo Drifter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nikkatsu.com/movie/20953.html|title=Zoku T\u014dky\u014d nagaremono Umiwa Makkana Koinoiro|publisher=Nikkatsu|access-date=12 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinenote.com/main/public/cinema/detail.aspx?cinema_id=22046&key_search=%E7%B6%9A%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC%E6%B5%81%E3%82%8C%E8%80%85|title=\u7d9a\u6771\u4eac\u6d41\u308c\u8005\u3000\u6d77\u306f\u771f\u8d64\u306a\u604b\u306e\u8272|publisher=[[Kinema Junpo]]|access-date= August 17, 2021}}</ref>\n\nTetsuya completed his prison term in Tokyo.
