The film follows various people involved in the [[country music|country]] and [[gospel music]] businesses in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], over a five-day period, leading up to a gala concert for a [[Populism|populist]] outsider running for President on the Replacement Party ticket.\n\n''Nashville'' is often noted for its scope. The film contains 24 main characters, an hour's worth of musical numbers, and multiple storylines. Its large [[ensemble cast]] includes [[David Arkin]], [[Barbara Baxley]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Karen Black]], [[Ronee Blakley]], [[Timothy Brown (actor)|Timothy Brown]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Robert DoQui]], [[Shelley Duvall]], [[Allen Garfield]], [[Henry Gibson]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], David Hayward, [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]], [[Allan F. Nicholls]], Dave Peel, [[Cristina Raines]], [[Bert Remsen]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Gwen Welles]], and [[Keenan Wynn]].\n\nThe screenplay for ''Nashville'' was written by Altman's frequent collaborator [[Joan Tewkesbury]], based partly on her experiences as an outsider visiting the city and observing its local music industry. Several incidents she experienced appear in the finished film, though Altman improvised numerous additional scenes and plot strands during filming. The film was shot on location in Nashville in 1974.\n\n''Nashville'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the summer of 1975, and opened to critical acclaim, praising the ensemble cast and soundtrack. It garnered [[List of accolades received by Nashville|numerous accolades]], including five [[Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for Carradine's track \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\". The film was nominated for a total of 11 [[Golden Globe Awards]], to date the highest number of nominations received by one film.\n\nSince then, it has been considered Altman's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'',<ref name=magnum>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-nashville-robert-altman-20150607-story.html |title=Why Robert Altman's brilliant 'Nashville' never had a sequel  |last=Gabler |first=Neal |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 5, 2015 |access-date=December 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name=sffs>{{cite web|url=http://history.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=3416 |title=Nashville |last=Thomson |first=David |publisher=San Francisco Film Society |date=2006 |access-date=December 12, 2016}} \"It seems clearer than ever that Nashville is [...] Altman's greatest achievement\"</ref> and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]].

Meanwhile, two recording sessions are taking place in a nearby studio: in one room, country superstar Haven Hamilton records a patriotic song commemorating the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]], while next door, Linnea Reese, a white [[gospel music|gospel]] singer, records a song with the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers|Jubilee Singers]] of historically black [[Fisk University]]. Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the [[BBC]] (though she refers to the British Broadcasting Company), attempts to listen in on the sessions. Later that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following what the crowd believes was a burn accident (which may actually have been a nervous breakdown and stay at a mental hospital). She is greeted at [[Nashville International Airport|Berry Field]] by local industry elites, including Haven and his companion, Lady Pearl, a nightclub owner. Also present are [[Private first class|Pfc.]] Glenn Kelly, who is obsessed with Barbara Jean, and a popular folk trio consisting of married couple Bill and Mary, and guitarist Tom, who are in town to record an album. Meanwhile, Martha, a teen [[groupie]] going by the name \"L.A. Joan\", is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co-worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer.\n\nOn the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from [[heat exhaustion]], and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle [[multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up]] occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea, as well as Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic at Lady Pearl's club, demonstrating no singing ability. Meanwhile, Linnea's husband Del has John Triplette, Walker's political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two [[deafness|deaf]] children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea earlier that day, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. Glamorous singer Connie White performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Mary misses Connie's performance to Bill's dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another nervous breakdown.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a Catholic mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a [[Black church|black Baptist]] church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings [[In the Garden (1912 song)|\"In the Garden\"]] from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs.\n\nAfter Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives a performance at [[Opryland USA]] that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker's gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle's house, when she attempts to investigate his violin case. At Lady Pearl's club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\" and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Tom is accustomed to women becoming clingy and emotional after trysts but Linnea is polite but detached afterwards. She leaves Tom\u2019s room oblivious to his blatant attempts to rattle her and make her jealous, frustrating him. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a [[striptease]] in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but Wade rescues her. He tells her that she cannot sing and attempts to persuade her to come to [[Detroit]] with him; she refuses, determined to \"sing with Barbara Jean\".\n\nThe next morning, the performers and audience converge at the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon]] for Walker's gala concert. The lineup consists of Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen; Winifred arrives, hoping to sing. Meanwhile, Mr. Green and Kenny arrive at the gala searching for Martha, who has failed to attend her aunt Esther's funeral, and find her accompanying Bill. During Barbara Jean's set, Kenny produces a gun from his violin case, and begins shooting at the stage. A bullet grazes Haven's arm, but Barbara Jean is seriously injured. Kelly disarms Kenny as chaos breaks out. Barbara Jean is carried from the stage, bleeding and unconscious, while Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that \"[[assassination of John F. Kennedy|This isn't Dallas]]\". Winifred is handed the microphone in the melee, and begins singing \"It Don't Worry Me\", joined by Linnea's gospel choir.\n\n==Cast==\n'''Major characters'''\n{{cast listing|\n* [[David Arkin]] as Norman, a chauffeur hired to drive Bill, Mary and Tom during their stay in Nashville.

He has a cameo as Frog, a [[session musician]], appearing in several scenes.\n* [[Merle Kilgore]] as Trout, the owner of a club that has an open-mic talent night that gives Sueleen Gay what she believes is her big break as a singer.\nThere are [[cameo appearance]]s by [[Elliott Gould]], [[Julie Christie]], [[Vassar Clements]] and [[Howard K. Smith]], all playing themselves. Gould and Christie were passing through Nashville when Altman added them. Altman plays Bob, an unseen producer who in the beginning of the film is producing Haven Hamilton's song \"200 Years\". He can be heard on a speaker when Hamilton gets agitated by Frog's inept piano playing.\n\n==Analysis and themes==\nIn a 1995 academic article published in ''[[American Quarterly]]'', Paul Lauter, a professor of American Studies at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], compared the film to \"a poststructuralist theoretical text\", adding that \"it invites, indeed valorizes, contradiction and seems designed to resist closure.\"<ref name=\"versionsofnashville\">{{cite journal |first = Paul| last = Lauter| title=\"Versions of Nashville, Visions of American Studies\": Presidential Address to the American Studies Association, October 27, 1994 |journal=American Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=2 |page=197 |jstor=2713279 | date = June 1995   | doi = 10.2307/2713279}}</ref> As a result, he explained, \"interpretations of the film have been wildly divergent and evaluations contradictory.\"<ref name=\"versionsofnashville\"/>\n\n===Political content===\nFilm scholars Yoram Allon, Del Cullen, and Hannah Patterson describe ''Nashville'' as an \"epic study of ambition, greed, talent, and politics in American culture, with the country and western music businesses serving as a microcosm of American society.\"{{sfn|Allon|Cullen|Patterson|2002|p=9}} Ray Sawhill of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' views the film as reflective of the 1970s' political climate, writing that the film \"comes across as a piece of [[New Journalism]]; it's like [[Norman Mailer]]'s reports from conventions and rallies. Altman is using Nashville metaphorically\u2014he's really talking about politics. I wish he didn't make that quite so explicit. There's a reference to Dallas and a few to the [[Kennedy family|Kennedys]], as well as some red-white-and-blue visual cues, that the film could have done without. Still, the result is an X-ray of the era's uneasy political soul. What it reveals is a country trying to pull itself together from a nervous breakdown.\"<ref name=salon>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/control/2000/06/27/nashville_2/|title=A movie called \"Nashville\"|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=June 27, 2000|author=Sawhill, Ray|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815051317/https://www.salon.com/control/2000/06/27/nashville_2/|archive-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity===\nSawhill suggests that the film is preoccupied with \"a populist culture driving itself mad with celebrity\" and presents Nashville as a \"provincial New York or [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], as one of the places where the culture manufactures its image of itself.\"<ref name=salon/> He cites the various recording and communication devices present as evidence of this: \"wires, phones, intercoms, cameras, mikes, speakers\u2014seem to be everywhere; so does the machinery of publicity and fame.

The country-western thing had suddenly exploded in Nashville, but [musicians] still had to come to New York for getting paid, and business deals.\"{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=62}} None of Tewkesbury's incarnations of the screenplay featured any death scenes, but Altman, who had a \"penchant for the tragic denouement\", proposed the idea that Barbara Jean would be assassinated in the finale.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=60}}\n\nNumerous characters in ''Nashville'' are based on real country music figures: Henry Gibson's Haven Hamilton is a composite of [[Roy Acuff]], [[Hank Snow]], and [[Porter Wagoner]]; Ronee Blakley's Barbara Jean is based on [[Loretta Lynn]];{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=62}} the black country singer Tommy Brown (played by [[Timothy Brown (actor)|Timothy Brown]]) is based on [[Charley Pride]];{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=62}} and the feuding folk trio is based on [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]; within the trio, the married couple of Bill and Mary were inspired by Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert, who later became [[Starland Vocal Band]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://georgetownvoice.com/2008-03-13/feature/take-me-home |last=Reger |first=Jeff |title=Take Me Home |date=March 13, 2008 |work=The Georgetown Voice |access-date=October 5, 2012}}</ref> [[Keith Carradine]]'s character is believed to be inspired by [[Kris Kristofferson]], and Karen Black's Connie White was conceived as a composite of [[Lynn Anderson]] (who spoke unfavorably of the film after its release{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=292}}), [[Tammy Wynette]], and [[Dolly Parton]].{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=62}} Other characters were based on or inspired by real persons: Linnea was inspired by [[Louise Fletcher]], who had appeared in Altman's ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1973), and who had two deaf parents.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=91}} The black choir singing with Linnea early in the film is based on the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]], though it's disputed whether the performers in the film were actually Fisk University students or members of the B.

Well, within a short time Ronee Blakley was the only actor in the film who was universally disliked.\"{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=167}} Throughout the shoot, Altman and Blakley had several disputes regarding her character, and Blakley sometimes rewrote her scenes to Altman's dismay.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=167}}\n\n[[File:Parthenon.at.Nashville.Tenenssee.01.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon in Nashville]], location of the climactic final scene]]\nLocations featured in the film include the [[Nashville International Airport]],{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=64}} and the [[Exit/In]], a Nashville club which screenwriter Tewkesbury had frequented during her trips there.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=57}} The scene in which Carradine's character performs \"I'm Easy\" was shot at this club.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=57}} Altman's log cabin-style house on the outskirts of Nashville was used as the home of Haven and Lady Pearl.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=173}} The film's climactic assassination sequence, which takes places at the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon]], was originally intended to take place at the [[Ryman Auditorium]].{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=258}} However, Altman was forced to change the locale when he was unable to secure access to the then-recently shuttered Ryman Auditorium.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=258}} Walker, the climactic assassination, the political theme and various associated characters (such as Haven Hamilton) do not appear in the earliest versions of the script, and were integrated into the screenplay throughout filming.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=67}}\n\nAll of the musical scenes featured in the film are actual live concert footage.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=142, 201}}\n\nThe hospital scenes centered on Barbara Jean were filmed in a local hospital that had been closed; one floor of it was refurbished for use in filming.\n\nNearly all of the extras in the film were Nashville locals. Many of them were not actively participating in the film but simply happened to be at the location where the cast and crew were filming at the time. Recording session legend [[Lloyd Green]] (\"Mr. Nashville Sound\") can be seen playing pedal steel guitar in the opening studio scene. Jeff Newman,  known for the pedal steel, is sitting next to him playing a banjo.\n\n===Post-production===\n''Nashville'''s opening [[title sequence]] was designed by the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]], who had recently enjoyed his big break with his work on  ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973). Under Altman's direction, Perri based the film's unusual, [[kitsch]]y title sequence on low-budget [[K-Tel Records]] television commercials, and brought in [[Johnny Grant (radio personality)|Johnny Grant]] to provide the loud, brash [[voiceover]]. Perri later went on to design titles for a number of other major Hollywood pictures, including ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref name=\"perkins\">{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Will|title=Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|website=[[Art of the Title]]|access-date=11 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811100417/http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|archive-date=11 August 2017|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAltman had enough footage to produce a four-hour film, and assistant director [[Alan Rudolph]] suggested he create an expanded version of ''Nashville'' to be shown in two parts, \"Nashville Red\" and \"Nashville Blue\", but the film ultimately remained intact.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=276}} After a rush of critical acclaim, ABC expressed interest in a proposal for a 10-hour [[miniseries]] of ''Nashville'', based on the footage not used in the final cut, but plans for the project were scrapped.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=276}} The additional footage has not been made available on DVD releases.\n\nHowever, in a 2000 interview with ''The A.V. Club'', Altman disputed the claim that he had several hours worth of deleted scenes to cut another feature-length film (or two) out of. Altman claimed that there \"were no deleted scenes\" and that \"almost everything we shot is in that film\". Altman further stated the unseen, extra footage that wasn't used in the final cut of the film was mainly music and not much else.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Nashville: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}\nMany of the actors and actresses in the film composed the songs they performed in the film. Blakley wrote several tracks, including \"Bluebird\", performed by Timothy Brown, and \"Tapedeck in His Tractor\" and \"My Idaho Home\", performed by Blakley.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|pages=190, 226}} Karen Black wrote \"Memphis\" and \"Rolling Stone\", the two songs she performed in the character of Connie White.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=293}} Carradine wrote and performed \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\", which won an Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song]]{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=303}} and a Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song - Motion Picture]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Golden Globe]]s|title=''Nashville''|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/nashville|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190813234138/https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/nashville|archive-date=August 13, 2019|access-date=August 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, Carradine wrote \"It Don't Worry Me\", which is heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, and is the closing number performed by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] onstage at the Parthenon.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|pages=43, 294}}\n\nComposer [[Richard Baskin]] composed songs for [[Henry Gibson]] to sing in character as Haven Hamilton.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=80}} Several Nashville session musicians took part in the music recording and in the film, including violinist [[Vassar Clements]]{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=210}} and guitarist [[Harold Bradley]].\n\nWhile the music featured in the film was viewed in the Nashville music industry as mean-spirited satire,{{sfn|Stuart|2003|pages=289\u2013295}} the songs have achieved a cult-status among [[alternative country]] musicians.

And I said 'Well, I don't feel responsible,' but I said, 'but don't you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?' The statement here is, these people are not assassinated because of their ideas or what they do. They're assassinated to draw attention to the assassin. And in political assassinations, in their sort of warped minds, they know that they are going to have a certain amount of people who said 'that son of a bitch [the politician] should have been shot,' because there's such heat about it. But actually what they are doing is killing somebody who's in the public eye and is some sort of an icon. Because this feeling that by doing that, committing that assassination they draw the attention to themselves, and they make themselves consequently important.
