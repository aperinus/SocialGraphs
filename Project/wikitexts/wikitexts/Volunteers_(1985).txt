After his father, Lawrence Bourne Jr. ([[George Plimpton]]), refuses to pay his debt, he escapes his angry creditors by trading places with his college roommate Kent ([[Xander Berkeley]]), jumping on a [[Peace Corps]] flight to [[Thailand]]. On the plane, he meets [[Washington State University|Washington State]] graduate Tom Tuttle from Tacoma ([[John Candy]]) and the beautiful, down-to-earth Beth Wexler ([[Rita Wilson]]), the latter rejecting his advances once realizing why he's really there.\n\nIn Thailand, they are assigned by John Reynolds ([[Tim Thomerson]]) to build a bridge for the local villagers. On day one, Tuttle gets into an argument with the villagers over what wood to use; the only one who speaks English is At Toon ([[Gedde Watanabe]]).\n\nTuttle then gets captured by communist forces who brainwash him into doing their bidding, while Reynolds makes passes at Beth. Lawrence befriends At Toon, teaching him and several other villagers various gambling card games, but they are met by the powerful [[drug lord]] Chung Mee (Ernest Harada), who forces them to finish the bridge quickly.\n\nLawrence eventually wins Beth over but she is captured by Reynolds, who is working with Chung Mee. They rescue Beth, who urges them to destroy the bridge; Lawrence reluctantly agrees after professing his love for her. They get the villagers on board with the plan and get Tuttle back to reality, plotting to leave dynamite in the center of the bridge so that the entire structure collapses. Their plan works fine until Lawrence is confronted by Reynolds, who threatens to kill him. Lawrence distracts Reynolds long enough to enact the plan, jumping into the river as the bridge explodes. Beth saves Lawrence by performing CPR, and they kiss once Lawrence wakes.\n\nSome time later, Lawrence and Beth are married in the Thai village. Lawrence writes to his parents saying he finally did something right for the right reasons.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as Lawrence Bourne III\n*[[John Candy]] as Tom Tuttle\n*[[Rita Wilson]] as Beth Wexler\n*[[Tim Thomerson]] as John Reynolds\n*[[Gedde Watanabe]] as At Toon\n*[[George Plimpton]] as Lawrence Bourne, Jr.\n*Ernest Harada as Chung Mee\n*[[Allan Arbus]] as Albert Bardenaro\n*[[Xander Berkeley]] as Kent Sutcliffe\n\n==Production==\nThe film was in the works for six years before it was made.
