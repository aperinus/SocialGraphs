The film's title quotes the name of the game [[cryptanalyst]] [[Alan Turing]] proposed for answering the question \"Can machines think?\", in his 1950 seminal paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\". The film stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Turing, who decrypted German intelligence messages for the British government during [[World War II]]. [[Keira Knightley]], [[Matthew Goode]], [[Rory Kinnear]], [[Charles Dance]], and [[Mark Strong]] appear in supporting roles.\n\n''The Imitation Game'' was released theatrically in the United States on November 28, 2014. The film grossed over $233 million worldwide on a $14 million production budget, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2014. It received eight nominations at the [[87th Academy Awards]], winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]; five nominations at the [[72nd Golden Globe Awards]]; and three nominations at the [[21st Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. It also received nine [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] nominations, and won the People's Choice Award at the [[39th Toronto International Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician [[Alan Turing]] after an apparent break-in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at [[Bletchley Park]] during the Second World War.\n\nIn 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in [[cryptography]]. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis.\n\nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston]], he joins the cryptography team of [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], [[John Cairncross]], [[Peter Hilton]], Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. The team are [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|trying to analyze]] the [[Enigma machine]], which the Nazis use to send coded messages.\n\nTuring is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design [[Bombe|a machine]] to decipher Enigma messages. After Denniston refuses to fund the construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. [[Joan Clarke]], a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing's test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages and shares his plans with her.  With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.\n\nTuring's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives from the same German coder, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to [[known plaintext attack|decode words he already knows exist in certain messages]]. One German coder always opens his first message with a standard plaintext German script. That reveals enough of the day's Enigma code that Christopher can quickly decode all the day's messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. They learn a convoy is about to be attacked, but Turing realises that if they suddenly reroute the convoy and attack the U-boats, the Germans will realize Enigma is compromised and change the machinery. Therefore the team at Bletchley Park cannot act on every decoded message. Turing creates a statistical model to indicate which warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize discovery.\n\nTuring discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the top MI6 agent [[Stewart Menzies]] appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted the messages Cairncross leaks to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is a homosexual. Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Turing then tells her he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills.  Heartbroken, she decides to stay anyway, deeming this the single most important task she will undertake, and she now refuses to cow to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or think of her decisions.  After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work, because MI6 wants governments to think they had unbreakable code machines. He tells the team that they should never see one another again or share what they have done.\n\nIn 1952, Turing is convicted of [[gross indecency]] and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes [[chemical castration]] so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that after a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy, Turing [[Alan Turing#Death|committed suicide]] on June 7, 1954. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a [[Alan Turing#Government apology and pardon|posthumous Royal Pardon]], honouring his work which would eventually [[History of computing|go on to create]] the modern computer.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Alan Turing]]\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Joan Clarke]]\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]]\n* [[Rory Kinnear]] as Detective Robert Nock\n* [[Allen Leech]] as [[John Cairncross]]\n* [[Matthew Beard (British actor)|Matthew Beard]] as [[Peter Hilton]]\n* [[Charles Dance]] as [[Alastair Denniston|Commander Denniston]]\n* [[Mark Strong]] as [[Stewart Menzies]]\n* [[James Northcote (actor)|James Northcote]] as [[I.

It was a British [[Bombe]] machine, which was partly inspired by a design by the Polish cryptanalyst [[Marian Rejewski]]. Rejewski designed a machine in 1938, called [[Bomba (cryptography)|''bomba kryptologiczna'']], which had broken an earlier version of Germany's Enigma machines by the [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish Cipher Bureau]] before the Second World War.<ref name=\"harv\">{{cite book|last=Kozaczuk |first=W\u0142adys\u0142aw |author-link=W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kozaczuk |title=Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two |editor1-first=Christopher |editor1-last=Kasparek |editor1-link=Christopher Kasparek |location=Frederick, MD |publisher=University Publications of America |year=1984 |isbn=0-89093-547-5 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5hJnAAAAMAAJ}}}}</ref> \n*: A new machine with a different strategy was designed by Turing in 1940 with a major contribution from mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]] who goes unmentioned in the film.

Their effort allowed the Poles to build replicas of German machines in Warsaw for the Polish secret service. Just before the war, the Polish secret service revealed their work to their French and British allies in a secret meeting on July 26 and 27, 1939,<ref>Ralph Erskine: ''The Poles Reveal their Secrets&nbsp;\u2013 Alastair Dennistons's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry''.

Thousands of men and women were working on the project by the time the war ended in 1945. The computing advances did not obviate the need for human labour, as the many teams of largely female operators certainly knew. Throughout the war, there were breakthroughs and setbacks when the design or use of the German Enigma machines was changed and the Bletchley Park code breakers had to adapt.<ref name=\"nyrb-cc\"/><ref name=\"haigh\"/>{{pb}}Moreover, the breakthrough depicted in the film gives the impression that the ''Bombe'' was developed first, and only became effective later, after Turing suddenly realises that deciphering could be made easier by looking for known or speculated items contained in an intercepted message.  In reality, this is a cryptanalysis technique known as employing a ''[[known-plaintext attack|crib]]'', and the use of this technique predated the construction of the ''Bombe'' and had already been used in manual attacks on Enigma.<ref name=\"haigh\"/>\n* The suggestion that Enigma was the only German cipher broken at Bletchley Park.\n*: The breaking of the [[Lorenz cipher]], codenamed \"Tunny\", arguably made just as important a contribution to Ultra intelligence as the breaking of Enigma, and breaking Tunny was in many ways more difficult. Neither the Tunny effort nor its main contributors, mathematician [[W. T. Tutte|W. T. \"Bill\" Tutte]] and electrical engineer [[Tommy Flowers]], are mentioned in the film. The [[Colossus computer]] they built goes unmentioned by name in the film, although there is an implicit suggestion that Turing was responsible for it, which he was not.<ref name=\"haigh\"/>\n* The scene where the [[Hut 8]] team decides not to use broken codes to stop a German raid on a convoy that the brother of one of the code breakers ([[Peter Hilton]]) is serving on, to hide the fact they have broken the code.\n*: In reality, Hilton had no such brother, and while difficult decisions about [[Ultra#Safeguarding of sources|when and whether to use data from Ultra intelligence]] were made, they were decided at much higher administrative levels and not by the codebreakers themselves.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The sequence in which Turing writes a letter to Churchill to gain control over the project and obtain funding for the decryption machine.\n*: Turing was actually not alone in making a different request with a number of colleagues, including Hugh Alexander, writing a letter to Churchill (who had earlier visited there) in an effort to have more administrative resources sent to Bletchley Park, which Churchill immediately did.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The recruitment of Joan Clarke as a result of an examination after solving a crossword puzzle in a newspaper.\n*: In reality, [[Joan Clarke]] was an accomplished mathematics student and was recruited by her former academic supervisor, [[Gordon Welchman]], to the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)]].<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>  Puzzles were used by Bletchley Park in recruitment but neither Turing nor Clarke was ever involved with them.<ref name=\"guard-puzzle\"/>\n\n===Turing's personality and personal life===\n* Turing is depicted as having pronounced idiosyncrasies and challenges that inhibit his social interactions:\n:: While researchers have tried to assign [[Retrospective diagnoses of autism|a retrospective diagnosis of autism]] to Turing,<ref>{{cite journal | last1=O'Connell | first1=H. | last2=Fitzgerald | first2=M. | date=2003 | title= Did Alan Turing have Asperger's syndrome? | journal=Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume=20 | number=1 | pages=28\u201331| doi=10.1017/S0790966700007503 | pmid=30440230 | s2cid=53563123 }}</ref> the stereotypical traits portrayed in the film, such as social awkwardness, difficulty working with others, and tendency to take things over-literally, bear little relationship to accounts given of Turing's personality. Despite enjoying working alone, Turing was sociable and had friends, was also viewed as having a sense of humour, and had good working relationships with colleagues.<ref name=\"nyrb-cc\"/><ref name=\"spec-asp\">{{cite news | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/life/status-anxiety/9410662/the-misguided-bid-to-turn-alan-turing-into-an-aspergers-martyr/ | title=The misguided bid to turn Alan Turing into an Asperger's martyr | first=Toby | last=Young | newspaper=[[The Spectator]] | location=UK | date=January 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>''[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]'', Burnett Books Ltd, 1983. {{ISBN|0-09-911641-3}}, pp. 272\u20133.</ref><ref name=\"haigh\"/>\n* The scenes depicting Turing's childhood friend, including the manner in which Turing learned of Morcom's illness and death.<ref name=\"g-avt\"/><ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The sequence, which brackets the whole film, in which Turing is arrested in 1951 when a detective suspects him of being a Soviet spy, which leads to the discovery that Turing is gay.\n*: Turing's arrest was in 1952. The detective in the film and the interview as portrayed are fictional. Turing was investigated for his homosexuality after a robbery at his house and was never investigated for espionage.<ref name=\"g-avt\"/>\n* The suggestion that [[chemical castration]] made Turing unable to think clearly or do any work.\n*: Despite physical weakness and changes in Turing's body including [[gynaecomastia]], at that time he was doing innovative work on [[mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]], inspired by the very changes his body was undergoing due to chemical castration. While the physical changes distressed Turing, his friends did not notice any meaningful changes to his disposition or comportment in the period between the beginning of his castration and his death.<ref name=\"nyrb-cc\"/><ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The scene in which Clarke visits Turing in his home while he is serving probation.\n*: There is no record of Clarke ever visiting Turing's residence during his probation, although Turing did stay in touch with her after the war and informed her of his forthcoming trial for indecency.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/>\n* The statement that Turing died by suicide after a year of hormone treatment.\n*: In reality, the nature of Turing's death is a matter of considerable debate. The chemical castration period ended 14 months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had died by suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer, Andrew Hodges, believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from ''[[Snow White]]'', Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to interpret it as an accident. However, [[Jack Copeland]], an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the investigation was poorly conducted.<ref name=\"slate-lva\"/><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | title=Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | first=Roland | last=Pease | work=BBC News | date=June 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Personalities and actions of other characters===\n* The depiction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston|Denniston]] as a rigid officer, bound by military thinking and eager to shut down the decryption machine when it fails to deliver results.\n*: Denniston's grandchildren stated that the film takes an \"unwarranted sideswipe\" at their grandfather's memory, showing him to be a \"baddy\" and a \"hectoring character\" who hinders the work of Turing.
