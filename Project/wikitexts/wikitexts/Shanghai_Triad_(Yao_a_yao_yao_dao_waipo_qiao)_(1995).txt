The script is written by [[Bi Feiyu]] based on [[Li Xiao (writer)|Li Xiao]]'s 1994 novel ''Rules of a Clan'' (\u95e8\u89c4). The film is set in the [[Triad society|criminal underworld]] of 1930s [[Shanghai]], [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and spans seven days. ''Shanghai Triad's'' Chinese title reads \"Row, row, row to Grandma Bridge\", refers to a well known traditional Chinese [[lullaby]].<ref name=Elley>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117904095.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=Shanghai Triad Review|author=Elley, Derek| magazine= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=1995-05-25|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref>\n\nThe film was the last collaboration between Zhang Yimou and actress [[Gong Li]] in the 1990s, thus ending a successful partnership that had begun with Zhang's debut, ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'', and had evolved into a romantic relationship as well. With the wrapping of filming for ''Shanghai Triad'' the two agreed to end their relationship both professionally and personally.<ref name=Ebert/>  Gong Li and Zhang Yimou would not work together again until 2006's ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\n'''Tang Shuisheng''' (Wang Xiaoxiao) has arrived in Shanghai to work  for a [[Triad society|Triad]] Boss (played by [[Li Baotian]]), also named Tang. He is taken to a warehouse where two rival groups of Triads carry out an opium deal that goes wrong, leaving one of the rival members dead. Shuisheng is then taken by his uncle to Tang's palatial home, where he is assigned to serve '''Xiao Jinbao''' ([[Gong Li]]), a cabaret singer and mistress of the Boss. It is soon learned that Jinbao is also carrying on an affair with the Boss's number two man, '''Song''' ([[Sun Chun]]).\n\nOn the third night, Shuisheng witnesses a bloody gang fight between the Boss and a rival, Fat Yu, in which his uncle is killed. The Boss and a small entourage retreat to an island. There, Jinbao befriends '''Cuihua''' ([[Jiang Baoying]]), a peasant woman with a young daughter, '''Ajiao'''. When Jinbao unwittingly meddles in Cuihua's business, it results in the Boss's men killing Cuihua's lover. Furious, Jinbao confronts the Boss and tells Shuisheng to leave Shanghai.\n\nBy the seventh day, Song arrives to the island along with '''Zheng''' ([[Fu Biao]]), the Boss's number three man. During a [[mahjong]] game, the Boss calmly confronts Song with evidence of his treachery. The gang kills Song's men and buries Song alive. The Boss then informs Jinbao that she will have to die as well for her role in Song's betrayal, along with Cuihua. As Shuisheng attempts to save her from her fate, he is thrown back and beaten. The film ends with Shuisheng tied to the sails of the ship as it sails back to Shanghai. The Boss takes Cuihua's young daughter with him, telling her that in a few years, she will become just like Jinbao.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Wang Xiaoxiao as Tang Shuisheng, the young teenage boy who serves as the film's protagonist and he falls under the spell of the boss's mistress, Jinbao.\n* [[Gong Li]] as Xiao Jinbao, a Shanghai [[nightclub singer]], Jinbao is the mistress of the Triad Boss. \n* [[Li Xuejian]] as Uncle Liu, a servant to a Triad organization and Tang Shuisheng's uncle. \n* [[Li Baotian]] as Tang the Triad Boss who hides a ruthless side.\n* [[Sun Chun]] as '''Song''', the Boss's number two man, Song's affair with Jinbao sets up the film's main conflict.\n* [[Fu Biao]] as '''Zheng''', the Boss's number three man.\n* [[Yang Qianguan]] as '''Ajiao''', a young girl living on the secluded island with her mother.\n* [[Jiang Baoying]] as '''Cuihao''', Ajiao's mother, a peasant woman who prepares meals for the Boss while he is hiding on his island estate.\n\n== Production ==\n\n''Shanghai Triad'' was director [[Zhang Yimou]]'s seventh feature film. Zhang's previous film, ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'' had landed the director in trouble with Chinese authorities, and he was temporarily banned from making any films funded from overseas sources.<ref name=Elley/> ''Shanghai Triad'' was therefore only allowed to continue production after it was officially categorized as local production. The director has since noted that his selection of ''Shanghai Triad'' to follow up the politically controversial ''To Live'' was no accident, as he hoped that a \"gangster movie\" would be a conventional film.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CEED7113EF93AA1575AC0A963958260|title=Shanghai triad - Movie - Review| author = Maslin, Janet |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date= 1995-09-29|accessdate =2008-05-07}}</ref>\n\nThe film was originally intended to be a straight adaptation of the novel ''Gang Law'' by author [[Li Xiao (writer)|Li Xiao]]. This plan eventually changed with Gong Li's character becoming more important and the story's viewpoint shifting to that of the young boy, Tang Shuisheng. As a result, the film's title was changed to reflect its new \"younger\" perspective.<ref name=Elley/>\n\n==Reception==\nThough perhaps less well known than some of Zhang Yimou's more celebrated films (notably ''[[Ju Dou]]'', ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'' and ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]''), ''Shanghai Triad'' was nevertheless generally praised by critics upon its release, with a 90% \"fresh\" rating on the review-database, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 29 reviews. With its headline position in the [[New York Film Festival]], ''[[The New York Times]]''' critic [[Janet Maslin]] opened her review that despite the clich\u00e9d genre of the \"gangster film,\" ''Shanghai Triad'' nevertheless \"movingly affirms the magnitude of [Zhang Yimou's] storytelling power.\"<ref name=NYT/> [[Derek Elley]] of the entertainment magazine ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' similarly found the film to be an achievement, particularly in how it played with genre conventions, calling the film a \"stylized but gripping portrait of mob power play and lifestyles in 1930 Shanghai.\"<ref name=Elley/> [[Roger Ebert]], however, provided a counterpoint to the film's praise, arguing that the choice of the boy as the film's main protagonist ultimately hurt the film, and that ''Shanghai Triad'' was probably \"the last, and ... certainly the least, of the collaborations between the Chinese director Zhang Yimou and the gifted actress Gong Li\" (though Gong would again work with Zhang in 2006's ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'').<ref name=Ebert>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960216/REVIEWS/602160304/1023| title = Shanghai Triad| author = Ebert, Roger| newspaper= [[The Chicago Sun Times]] | date = 1996-02-16|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> Even Ebert however, conceded that the film's technical credits were well done, calling Zhang one of the \"best visual stylists of current cinema.\"<ref name=Ebert/>\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n* [[1995 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] ([[1995 in film|1995]])\n**[[Vulcan Award|Technical Grand Prize]]<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3372/year/1995.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Shanghai Triad |accessdate=2009-09-05|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n* [[Camerimage Awards]] ([[1995 in film|1995]])\n**Golden Frog \u2014 [[L\u00fc Yue (cinematographer)|L\u00fc Yue]] (nominated)\n* [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards 1995|Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards (1995)]] \n** [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Cinematography|LAFCA Award, Best Cinematography]] \u2014 [[L\u00fc Yue (cinematographer)|L\u00fc Yue]] \n* [[New York Film Critics Circle Awards]] ([[1995 in film|1995]])\n** [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Cinematography|NYFCC Award, Best Cinematography]] \u2014 [[L\u00fc Yue (cinematographer)|L\u00fc Yue]] \n* [[National Board of Review]] ([[1995 in film|1995]])\n** [[National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film|NBR Award, Best Foreign Language Film]] \n* [[53rd Golden Globe Awards]] ([[1996 in film|1996]])\n** [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe, Best Foreign Language Film]] (nominated)\n* [[68th Academy Awards]] ([[1996 in film|1996]])\n** [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] \u2014 [[L\u00fc Yue (cinematographer)|L\u00fc Yue]] (nominated)\n\n== Retail release ==\n''Shanghai Triad'' was released on December 12, 2000 in the United States on [[DVD Region|region 1]] DVD by [[Sony Pictures]]' [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar]] label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&partNumber=CTR11857DVD|title=Shanghai Triad - DVD|publisher = Sony Pictures|accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> The DVD edition includes English and Spanish subtitles.
