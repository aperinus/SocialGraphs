Spanning the years 1971\u20131997 and based on Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine's 1984 book ''Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer'', it explores the impact that the rivalry between Jobs ([[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]) and Gates ([[Microsoft]]) had on the development of the [[personal computer]]. The film premiered on [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] on June 20, 1999.<ref name=Variety>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/reviews/pirates-of-silicon-valley-1200458078/|title=Review: 'Pirates of Silicon Valley'|access-date=2015-12-12|last=Richmond|first=Ray|date=1999-06-16|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|archive-date=December 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212062136/http://variety.com/1999/tv/reviews/pirates-of-silicon-valley-1200458078/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Steve Jobs]] is speaking with director [[Ridley Scott]] about the creation of the [[1984 (advertisement)|1984 advertisement]] for [[Apple Computer#Macintosh|Apple Computer]], which introduced the [[Macintosh 128K|first Macintosh]]. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that \"We're creating a completely new consciousness.\" Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the advertisement.\n\nNext in 1997 with Jobs, [[History of Apple#1996: Return of Steve Jobs|returning to Apple]], and announcing [[History of Apple#Microsoft deal|a new deal with Microsoft]] at the [[Macworld Expo#1997|1997 Macworld Expo]]. His partner, [[Steve Wozniak|Steve \"Woz\" Wozniak]], is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] and the image of [[Bill Gates]] on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they \"got from there to here\", the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple.\n\nThe earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]] campus during the period of the [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|student anti-war movements]]. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, \"Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are.\" Wozniak then comments that \"Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see [[kilobytes]] or [[circuit boards]] while he'd see [[karma]] or the [[Meaning of life|meaning of the universe]].\"\n\nUsing a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at [[Harvard University]], in the early 1970s, with classmate [[Steve Ballmer]], and Gates's high school friend [[Paul Allen]]. As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates's story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of [[Ed Roberts (computer engineer)|Ed Roberts]]'s [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] [[Altair 8800|Altair]] causing him to drop out of Harvard. Gates's and Allen's early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the \"Homebrew Computer Club\". Jobs and Woz develop [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in the garage of Jobs's family home, with the help of [[Daniel Kottke|Daniel]] and Elizabeth. Eventually, [[Mike Markkula]] invests in the company which allows it to expand and move forward. In 1977, Jobs, Woz, and Markkula demo the [[Apple II]] at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. This event is followed by the development of the [[Influence of the IBM-PC on the PC market|IBM-PC]] with the help of Gates and [[Microsoft]] in 1981.\n\nThe film follows Jobs's relationship with his high school girlfriend and early Apple employee, Arlene (a pseudonym for [[Chrisann Brennan]]), and the difficulties he had with acknowledging his parental legitimacy of their daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Around the time she was born, Jobs unveiled his next computer, which he named [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]. The Lisa was followed in 1984 by the Macintosh, both having been inspired by the [[Xerox Alto]]. The main body of the film finally concludes with a 30th birthday toast in 1985 to Steve Jobs shortly before [[History of Apple#1985: Jobs leaves Apple|he was forced out]] of Apple by CEO [[John Sculley]].\n\nThe film ends in 1997, with the return of 42-year-old Jobs to Apple (after its acquisition of [[NeXT Computer]]) and with his announcement at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo|MacWorld Expo]] of an alliance between Apple and Microsoft. It also indicates that Jobs is now married, has children, and has reconciled with Lisa.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Noah Wyle]] as [[Steve Jobs]]\n* [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as [[Bill Gates]]\n* [[Joey Slotnick]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as [[Steve Ballmer]]\n* [[Josh Hopkins]] as [[Paul Allen]]\n* [[Gailard Sartain]] as [[Ed Roberts (computer engineer)|Ed Roberts]]\n* [[Jeffrey Nordling]] as [[Mike Markkula]]\n* [[Allan Royal]] as [[John Sculley]]\n* [[J.

I was bored by it.\"<ref name=com>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/301225/90s-tv-movie-became-steve-jobs-film-beat/\n|title=How a '90s TV movie became the Steve Jobs film to beat\n|access-date=2015-12-12\n|first=Luke\n|last=Dormhel\n|date=2014-10-29\n|publisher=cultofmac.com\n|archive-date=December 22, 2015\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222144017/http://www.cultofmac.com/301225/90s-tv-movie-became-steve-jobs-film-beat/\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref> After the studio asked him for suggestions Burke states that \"I'm a great believer in Shakespeare, and what we had was a modern equivalent of [[Hamlet]], featuring two young princes, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs ... the more I read about Steve in particular, the more I saw him in those Shakespearean terms. He was brilliant, volcanic, obsessive, suspicious, even vicious in a business sense. He was about conquest, always conquest. I said, 'That's the sort of movie I want to make.'\"<ref name=com/> Burke was thus hired as director of the project and rewrote the screenplay.<ref name=com/> In developing the characters themselves, Burke also stated that he chose not to speak with any of the central figures portrayed in the film:\n\n{{blockquote|I did not want to do an \"authorized biography\" on either Microsoft or Apple, so we made the decision going in that we would not talk or meet with them. With a team of Harvard researchers, I embarked on a seven-month research project that encompassed virtually everything we could find on the history of both companies, including old technical magazines from the '70s. I intended every scene to be based on actual events, including such seemingly fantastic moments as Bill Gates's bulldozer races in the middle of the night and Steve Jobs's bare feet going up on the board room table during an applicant's job interview.

Wyle originally turned down the role, but changed his mind after Burke had him watch the 1996 documentary, ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]''.<ref name=bi2015/> Wyle states that he watched the documentary \"for ten seconds and knew I'd kick myself for the rest of my life if I didn't play this part.\"<ref name=wyleofficial>{{cite web|url=http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/steve.html |title=Noah Wyle as Steve Jobs |access-date=2015-12-13 |date=1999 |publisher=Official website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011214000510/http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/steve.html |archive-date=December 14, 2001 }}</ref> He also noted that ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]'' led him to be \"taken by [Jobs's] presence, his confidence, smugness, smartness, ego, and his story's trajectory. He seemed to be the most Shakespearean figure in American culture in the last 50 years I could think of \u2013 the rise of, the fall of, and the return of. The truest definition of a tragic hero\u2014but you get the 'bonus round' that [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said didn't exist. Jobs has had one hell of a second act.\"<ref name=bi2015/> Burke later credited Wyle for the success of the film stating that, \"whatever was in the air, [Wyle] just absorbed it ... he became Jobs. It was a remarkable transformation. We had a photo of Steve Jobs at about 28 years old, from the cover of Fortune magazine. We did a mockup with Noah and it was almost impossible to tell them apart.\"<ref name=com/> Burke also credits Joey Slotnick's interpretation of Steve Wozniak with Wozniak's enthusiasm for the film; Wozniak was so impressed that he flew to Los Angeles to have lunch with Slotnick. Burke notes that, \"Steve Wozniak made several speeches in which he said that the film accurately portrays how things actually happened ... To me that was better than any awards or nominations the film could get.\"<ref name=com/>\n\n[[Anthony Michael Hall]], who was cast as [[Bill Gates]], commented on his interest in the role, stating that he, \"really fought for this part because I knew it would be the role of a lifetime ... it was a thrill and a daunting challenge to play someone of his stature and brilliance.\"<ref name=amh>{{cite web|url=http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/bill.html |title=Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates |access-date=2015-12-13 |date=1999 |publisher=Official website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011117170345/http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/bill.html |archive-date=November 17, 2001 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' was originally scheduled to be shot in Toronto, with more than $1 million in sets. However, when Wyle was unable to receive a long enough release from ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' to shoot in Canada, the film temporarily shut down. Filming began again later in Los Angeles.<ref name=com/> During the filming, the cast broke down into PC and Mac factions, arguing over the merits of each platform. Burke states that he began the film as a PC user and ended a Mac user.<ref name=com/>\n\n==Themes==\nYoung [[Steve Jobs]] participated in aspects of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]]. Actor [[Noah Wyle]], who portrays Jobs, stated in an interview with [[CNN]], \"These kids grew up 30 miles south of the [University of California] Berkeley campus, which was ripe with revolution ... and they couldn't have cared less about the politics going on. They were in the garage tinkering with their electronics and starting a revolution that was a thousand times greater than anything that was going on the college campuses, politically.\"<ref name=CNN>{{cite web\n|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9906/18/pirates.silicon/\n|title=TV 'Pirates of Silicon Valley': Browsing the recent past\n|access-date=2008-05-08\n|first=Michael\n|last=Dennis\n|date=1999-06-18\n|publisher=[[CNN]]\n|archive-date=September 25, 2009\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925204951/http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9906/18/pirates.silicon/\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref> Director [[Martyn Burke]] also noted in an interview that, \"Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are the true revolutionaries of our time.

After ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' had aired, he contacted [[Noah Wyle]] and told him that while he \"hated\" both the film and the screenplay, he liked Wyle's performance, noting \"you do look like me.\"<ref name=\"bi2015\" /> Jobs then invited Wyle to the 1999 [[Macworld Expo|Macworld convention]] to play a prank on the audience. Wyle agreed and initially appeared as Jobs, until Jobs walked onto the stage and let the audience in on the joke.<ref name=\"bi2015\" /> In contrast, Jobs avoided meeting the director Martyn Burke, who later said that \"Steve wanted nothing to do with me.\"<ref name=\"com\" /> In a 2013 ''Ask Me Anything'' session with [[Reddit]], Gates responded to a question about his portrayal in the film by stating that it was \"reasonably accurate\".<ref name=Reddit>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/11/3977432/bill-gates-reddit-ama-80-inch-windows-8-tablet\n|title=Bill Gates hits Reddit for an AMA, replies using 80-inch Windows 8 display\n|access-date=2015-12-12\n|last=Warren\n|first=Tom\n|date=2013-02-11\n|website=[[The Verge]]\n|archive-date=March 12, 2017\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312131241/http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/11/3977432/bill-gates-reddit-ama-80-inch-windows-8-tablet\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\nWozniak had a positive response to the film and discussed it in detail with fans on his official website.<ref name=wozorglet2>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.woz.org/taxonomy/term/2 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417020209/http://www.woz.org/taxonomy/term/2 | archive-date=April 17, 2012 |title= Pirates of Silicon Valley\n|access-date=March 3, 2020\n|last=Wozniak\n|first=Steve\n|author1-link=Steve Wozniak\n|publisher=woz.org (Steve Wozniak's Official Website)}}</ref> Wozniak said that many aspects of the film were accurate, stating that \"when the movie opened with [a scene of] tear gas and riots ...

That suggestion was based on an incorrect ''Wall Street Journal'' [article] that said I was leaving Apple because I didn't like things there. Actually, I had told the ''Wall Street Journal'' writer that I wasn't leaving Apple because of things that I didn't like and that I wasn't even leaving, keeping my small salary forever as a loyal employee. I just wanted a small startup experience and a chance to design a smaller product again, a universal remote control.\"<ref name=\"wozorglet1\" /> In May 2015, Wozniak once again commented on the film, stating that  ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' is an example of a good Hollywood dramatization of himself, Steve Jobs, and the story of [[Apple Inc]]. He described ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' as \"intriguing, interesting.

He noted in an interview that it was \"a great movie. Noah Wyle was just uncannily close to Jobs. Just unbelievable. I found myself thinking it was actually Steve on the screen.\" He also states that in the film there were \"all these scenes of the garage where it's like half a dozen people working, busily carrying things back and forth, and oscilloscopes\" when he [Kottke] \"was really the only person who worked in the garage.

PARC's director, [[John Seely Brown]] stated in a 2006 interview that the scene in which Gates and Jobs argue about the role of Xerox is not entirely accurate. He said that Jobs was invited by PARC to view their technology in exchange for the ability to buy pre-IPO Apple stock.<ref name=jsb>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.studio360.org/story/106728-john-seely-brown/\n|title=JOHN SEELY BROWN\n|access-date=2015-12-12\n|date=2006-08-04\n|publisher=[[Studio 360|Studio360]]\n|archive-date=December 22, 2015\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222093812/http://www.studio360.org/story/106728-john-seely-brown/\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref> Wozniak said, \"Apple worked with Xerox openly to bring their developments to a mass audience. That's what Steve portrayed Apple as being good at. Xerox got a lot of Apple stock for it too, it was an agreement. Microsoft just took it from Xerox or Apple or whomever.
