Niebieski}}) is a 1993 [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed and co-written by Polish filmmaker [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]. ''Blue'' is the first of three films that comprise the [[Three Colours trilogy|''Three Colours'' trilogy]], themed on the [[Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9|French Revolutionary ideals]] of liberty, equality, and fraternity; it is followed by ''[[Three Colours: White|White]]'' and ''[[Three Colours: Red|Red]]''. According to Kie\u015blowski, the subject of the film is [[liberty]], specifically emotional liberty, rather than its social or political meaning.<ref>Insdorf, Anne, et al. \"A Look at Blue.\" ([[Featurette]]) DVD. [[The Criterion Collection]]. ''Three Colors: Blue''. November 15, 2011.</ref>\n\nSet in Paris, the film is about a woman whose husband and child are killed in a car accident. Suddenly set free from her familial bonds, she attempts to cut herself off from everything and live in isolation from her former ties, but finds that she cannot free herself from human connections.<ref>Kie\u015blowski, Krzysztof.

London: Faber and Faber, 1998, p. 212.</ref>\n\n''Blue'' received critical acclaim upon release and won several accolades, including the [[Golden Lion]] and the [[Volpi Cup for Best Actress]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]], and it is among Kie\u015blowski's most celebrated works.<ref>{{cite web |title=Krzysztof Kieslowski's Acclaimed Films |url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/kieslowskikrzysztof.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708173650/https://www.theyshootpictures.com/kieslowskikrzysztof.php |archive-date=July 8, 2014 |access-date=October 22, 2016 |website=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Votes for Three Colours Blue (1993)|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7c1b61df/sightandsoundpoll2012|access-date=October 17, 2016|publisher=British Film Institute}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nJulie, the wife of the famous French composer Patrice de Courcy, loses her husband and daughter in an automobile accident she herself survives. While recovering in a hospital, Julie attempts suicide by overdosing on pills, but cannot swallow them. After being released from the hospital, Julie, who is suggested to have helped write much of her husband's famous pieces, destroys what is left of them. Calling Olivier, a collaborator of her husband's who has always admired her, she sleeps with him before bidding him goodbye. Emptying the family house and putting it up for sale, she takes an apartment in Paris near [[Rue Mouffetard]] without telling anyone, her only memento being a mobile of blue beads that is hinted to have belonged to her daughter.\n\nJulie disassociates herself from her past life and distances herself from former friendships. She's no longer recognized by her mother, who suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]]. She also reclaims and destroys the unfinished score for her late husband's last commissioned work \u2212 a piece celebrating European unity following the end of the [[Cold War]]. Excerpts of its music, however, haunt her throughout the film.\n\nDespite her desire to live anonymously and alone, Julie is soon confronted by her past. A boy who witnessed the accident meets Julie and gives her a cross necklace found at the scene and asks her about her husband's last words, the punchline of an indelicate joke; Julie allows the boy to keep the necklace. Julie also reluctantly befriends an [[exotic dancer]] named Lucille who is having an affair with one of her neighbors and is despised by most people in the apartment building. The two women would support each other emotionally. While comforting Lucille at the club where she works, Julie sees Olivier being interviewed on TV, revealing that he kept a copy of the European piece and plans to finish it himself; Julie then sees a picture of Patrice with another woman.\n\nJulie confronts Olivier about the European piece and asks him about the woman seen with Patrice. She tracks down Sandrine, a lawyer and Patrice's lover, and finds out that she is pregnant with his child; Julie arranges for her to have the family house, not yet sold, and eventual recognition of his paternity for the child. Julie then returns to working on the piece with Olivier and finishes the final part. She then calls Olivier, who refuses to take the piece as his own unless Julie is credited as well, to which Julie agrees. Julie then calls Olivier again, asks him if he still loves her; he says yes, and Julie proceeds to meet him.\n\nIn the final sequence, part of the completed Unity of Europe piece is played (which features [[Choir|chorus]] and a solo [[soprano]] singing in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] the praise of divine love in [[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]]'s first letter to the [[1 Corinthians 13|Corinthians]]), and images are seen of all the people Julie has affected by her actions. The film ends with a shot of Julie crying before she begins to smile gradually.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Julie de Courcy (n\u00e9e Vignon)\n* [[Beno\u00eet R\u00e9gent]] as Olivier Ben\u00f4it\n* [[Florence Pernel]] as Sandrine\n* Charlotte V\u00e9ry as Lucille\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Vincent]] as the journalist\n* [[Philippe Volter]] as the real estate agent\n* [[Emmanuelle Riva]] as Madame Vignon, Julie's mother\n* [[Yann Tr\u00e9gou\u00ebt]] as Antoine\n* [[Julie Delpy]] as Dominique (cameo)\n* [[Zbigniew Zamachowski]] as Karol Karol (cameo)\n\n==Production==\n''Blue'' was an [[international co-production]] between the French companies CED Productions, [[Eurimages]], [[France 3 Cin\u00e9ma]], and MK2 Productions, the Swiss company CAB Productions and the Polish company Studio Filmowe TOR.\n\nLike the other films in the trilogy, ''Blue'' makes frequent visual allusions to its title: numerous scenes are shot with blue filters or blue lighting, and many objects are blue. When Julie thinks about the musical score that she has tried to destroy, blue light overwhelms the screen. The film also includes several references to the colours of the [[drapeau tricolore|tricolor]] that inspired Kie\u015blowski's trilogy: several scenes are dominated by red light, and in one scene, children dressed in white bathing suits with red floaters jump into the blue swimming pool. Another scene features a link with the next film in the trilogy: while spotting the lawyer Sandrine, her husband's mistress, Julie is seen entering a courtroom where Karol, the Polish main character of ''White'', is being divorced by Dominique, his estranged French wife.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe occasional fade-outs and fade-ins to Julie's character are used to represent an extremely subjective point of view. According to Kie\u015blowski, \"at a certain moment, time really does pass for Julie while at the same time, it stands still. Not only does her music come back to haunt her at a certain point, but time stands still for a moment.\"{{verify source|date=February 2021}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Three Colours: Blue'' received widespread acclaim from film critics.
