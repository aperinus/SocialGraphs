Directed by [[Oliver Stone]], and written by Stone and Kovic, it stars [[Tom Cruise]], [[Kyra Sedgwick]], [[Raymond J. Barry]], [[Jerry Levine]], [[Frank Whaley]], and [[Willem Dafoe]]. The film depicts the life of Kovic (Cruise) over a 20-year period, detailing his childhood, his military service and paralysis during the [[Vietnam War]], and his transition to anti-war activism. It is the second installment in Stone's trilogy of films about the Vietnam War, following ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986) and preceding ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'' (1993).\n\nProducer [[Martin Bregman]] acquired the film rights to the book in 1976 and hired Stone, also a [[Vietnam veteran]], to co-write the screenplay with Kovic, who would be played by [[Al Pacino]]. When Stone [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the book in 1978, the film adaptation became mired in [[development hell]] after Pacino and Bregman left, which resulted in him and Kovic putting the film on hold. After the release of ''Platoon'', the project was revived at [[Universal Pictures]], with Stone attached to direct. Shot on locations in the [[Philippines]], [[Texas]] and [[Inglewood, California]], principal photography took place from October 1988 to December, lasting 65 days of filming. The film went over its initial $14&nbsp;million production budget, and ended up costing $17.8&nbsp;million after reshoots.\n\nUpon release, ''Born on the Fourth of July'' was praised by critics for its story, Cruise's performance and Stone's direction. The film was successful at the box office as it grossed over $162 million worldwide, becoming the [[1989 in film|tenth highest-grossing film of 1989]]. At the [[62nd Academy Awards]], it received eight nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Cruise, his first nomination, and the film won for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], Stone's second in that category, and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. The film also won four [[Golden Globe Award]]s for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1956 [[Massapequa, New York]], 10-year-old [[Ron Kovic]] is playing with his friends in a forest. On his Fourth of July birthday, he attends an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] parade with his family and best friend Donna. In 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s televised [[Inaugural address of John F. Kennedy|inaugural address]] inspires a teenage Ron to join the [[United States Marine Corps]]. After attending an impassioned lecture by two Marine recruiters visiting his high school, he enlists. His decision receives support from his mother, but upsets his father, a World War II veteran. Ron goes to his prom, and dances with Donna before leaving for [[United States Marine Corps Recruit Training|recruit training]].\n\nIn October 1967, Ron is now a Marine sergeant on a [[reconnaissance]] mission in Vietnam, during his second [[tour of duty]]. He and his unit kill a number of Vietnamese villagers after mistaking them for enemy combatants. After encountering enemy fire, they flee the village and abandon its sole survivor, a crying baby. During the retreat, Ron accidentally kills Wilson, a young private in his platoon. He reports the action to his superior, who ignores the claim and advises him not to say anything else. In January 1968, Ron is critically wounded during a firefight, but is rescued by a fellow Marine. [[Paralysis|Paralyzed]] from the mid-chest down, he spends several months in recovery at the [[James J. Peters VA Medical Center|Bronx Veterans Hospital]] in New York. The hospital's conditions are poor; the doctors and nurses ignore patients, abuse drugs, and operate using old equipment. Against his doctors' requests, Ron desperately tries to walk again with the use of [[Brace (orthopedic)|brace]]s and [[crutches]], only to damage his legs and confine himself permanently to a wheelchair.\n\nIn 1969, Ron returns home and turns to alcohol after feeling increasingly neglected and disillusioned. During an Independence Day parade, Ron is asked to give a speech, but is unable to finish after he hears a crying baby in the crowd and [[posttraumatic stress disorder|has a flashback to Vietnam]]. Ron visits Donna in [[Syracuse, New York]], where the two reminisce. While attending a vigil for the victims of the [[Kent State shootings]], they are separated when Donna and other protestors are taken away by police for demonstrating against the Vietnam War.\n\nIn Massapequa, a drunken Ron has a heated argument with his mother, and his father decides to send him to Villa Dulce (The Sweet Villa), a Mexican haven for wounded [[Vietnam veteran]]s. He has his first [[sexual intercourse|sexual encounter]] with a prostitute, whom he falls for until he sees her with another customer. Ron befriends Charlie, another paraplegic, and the two decide to travel to another village after getting kicked out of a bar. After annoying their taxicab driver, they are stranded on the side of the road and argue with each other. They are picked up by a truck driver who takes them back to Villa Dulce.\n\nRon travels to [[Armstrong, Texas]], where he discovers Wilson's tombstone. He then visits the fallen Marine's family in Georgia to confess his guilt. Wilson's widow Jamie expresses that she is unable to forgive Ron, while his parents are more sympathetic. In 1972, Ron joins the organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]], and travels to the [[1972 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Miami, Florida. As [[Richard Nixon]] is giving an acceptance speech for his presidential nomination, Ron expresses to a news reporter his hatred for the war and the government for abandoning the American people. His comments enrage Nixon supporters, and his interview is cut short when police attempt to remove and arrest him and other protestors. Ron and the veterans manage to break free from the officers, regroup, and charge the hall again, though not successfully. In 1976, Ron delivers a public address at the [[1976 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in New York City, following the publication of his [[Born on the Fourth of July|autobiography]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, plus three from closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Sergeant [[Ron Kovic]]\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Charlie\n* [[Kyra Sedgwick]] as Donna\n* [[Raymond J.
