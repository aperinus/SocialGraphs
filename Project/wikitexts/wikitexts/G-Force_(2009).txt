It grossed $292.8 million worldwide against a production budget of $150 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> It received negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- This should be cleaned up to clarify which characters are animals and what kind. -->\nG-Force is a special team of trained animals. The primary field team consists of three guinea pigs: Darwin, Blaster, and Juarez, as well as a mole, Speckles and a fly named Mooch. The unit's leader Ben, orders an unauthorized infiltration of the residence of home electronics and appliances magnate, Leonard Saber, who is working with an unseen business partner named Mr. Yanshu. Saber's appliances all have control chips inside them that will activate a function called Sabersense, allowing electronic communication. The team retrieves sensitive information about a scheme called Clusterstorm, which will occur in 48 hours. However, when Ben's superior, Kip Killian, arrives for his evaluation, he is angry at Ben for performing an unauthorized mission. The government agent orders the unit shut down. With the help of the humans, Darwin, Juarez, Blaster, Mooch, and Speckles escape, but find themselves in a case bound for a pet shop. Ben and his assistant, Marcie, send a trained cockroach named Harry to infiltrate their hideout, which is now guarded by FBI agents, and recover Darwin's Personal Digital Assistant, which contained the information acquired from Saber's computer.\n\nTrapped in the store's pet rodent display case, G-Force meet Hurley, a guinea pig, Bucky, a hamster, and three mice. Although Blaster and Juarez manage to get themselves sold to a family with plans to return to extract their comrades, Speckles is thrown and seemingly crushed in a garbage truck. Meanwhile, Mooch manages to return to Ben to tell him where his mammalian agents are, but Darwin escapes with Hurley, who is forced to come after he gets kicked out by Bucky, before he can arrive to collect them. While Blaster and Juarez escape their new owners to return to Ben, he and Marcie discover that the intel in the PDA has a computer virus that hid the scheme. At this time, Darwin and Hurley make their own way to their superior. En route, Darwin sees a Saberling coffee maker and decides to investigate it, but it turns into a violent robot; which he and Hurley defeat by luring it into the road where its destroyed by a passing car. After examining the wreckage, they discover that Sabersense and Clusterstorm are connected and that the chips found inside the appliances actually transforms them into killer robots.\n\nOnce they all return and inform Ben of Speckles\u2019 apparent demise, Ben eventually confesses that they are not special genetically enhanced animals as previously told, but ordinary ones Ben took in and trained for the team. However, Hurley lifts them from their despair by reminding the team of the astounding feats that he has seen them do. He also suggests using the virus in the PDA to take down Saber's computer mainframe. Emboldened, Ben provides the field team with the means to infiltrate the Saber residence and plant the virus in the mainframe. Unfortunately, FBI agents are ordered by Killian to capture the animals dead or alive. After the team infiltrates Saber's mainframe, they encounter a bomb trap, but avoid it because of their size.\n\nIn every place with Saberling appliances, all of the machines also transform into killing machines resulting in massive chaos; one of which tries to kill the 3 guinea pigs after trapping Hurley inside & tries to cook him. The team fight the monster until it is destroyed by the bomb trap, and the resulting battle separates the group, leaving only Darwin and Mooch to take the mainframe down. Meanwhile, Leonard Saber is shocked that his appliances have turned into killing machines, having wanted them to communicate with each other. As this happens, Kip and the FBI, having found out about the appliances going on a rampage via live television, decide to apprehend Saber for his actions, only to find out that he didn't do anything wrong and that he just wanted to make Saberling the biggest appliance manufacturer in the world. Darwin finds Speckles alive and well (having faked his death) at the mainframe, who reveals that he is the mastermind behind the plot and is also the mysterious Mr. Yanshu (Yanshu means \"mole\" in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]), tricking Saber into planting the control chips into the appliances to repurpose Clusterstorm into causing a massive planet-wide bombardment of space debris to make Earth's surface uninhabitable while using Sabersense as a cover up, and reveals that he was the one who sabotaged G-Force's presentation to ensure that they did not find out about his plot. He explains his motive is to exact revenge on the human race for the death of his family after being persuaded by his father to do so. Speckles promptly amalgamates the various appliances in the vicinity into a giant walking robot, which attacks the police and grabs the command truck with Ben, Marcie, Killian, and Saber inside. During the fight, Darwin convinces Speckles to change his ways, but he refuses and summons a Saberling blender to overpower him, which loses his PDA and parachute in the process. However, Darwin manages to persuade Speckles by saying that G-Force is his family now, one he was close to destroying like what had happened to his first family long ago because Ben was the only human who took him in when they had nobody else. Realizing Darwin is right and that he is close to destroying the only family he has left, Speckles tries to shut down the robot, but he cannot control them anymore. With Mooch recovering the PDA, Darwin uses it on the device to take it down, destroying the robot and nearly killing Hurley, but saving Ben, Marcie, Kip, and Saber, who is later taken by the FBI. With the mission complete, the G-Force find Hurley dead, but they use the remains of his chocolate cake that Hurley found earlier to revive him.\n\nThe guinea pigs are personally commended by the FBI Director, who also appoints them special agents of the FBI. Furthermore, G-Force is reinstated as a unit of the Bureau and expanded with Hurley, Bucky, and the mice inducted as new recruits. Meanwhile, Saber was forced by the FBI and the government to make the largest consumer product recall in history where Speckles is given the duty of removing the malicious chips from all 178,003 Saber appliances before rejoining the team. Agent Killian is relocated to an FBI base in the South Pole as a punishment for trying to arrest G-Force. Darwin, Blaster, Juarez, and Hurley have a dance party to celebrate their victory, with Bucky and the mice joining them.\n\n==Cast==\n===Voice cast===\n[[File:Sam Rockwell (8279227257).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sam Rockwell]] voiced Darwin]]\n\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Darwin (FBI Special Agent), a [[crested guinea pig]], the head of G-Force.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Blaster (FBI Special Agent), a fox guinea pig, the weapons expert of G-Force.
