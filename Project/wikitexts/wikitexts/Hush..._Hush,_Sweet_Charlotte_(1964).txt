It follows a middle-aged Southern woman, suspected in the unsolved murder of her lover from decades before, who is plagued by bizarre occurrences after summoning her cousin to help challenge the local government's impending demolition of her home. The screenplay was adapted by [[Henry Farrell]] and [[Lukas Heller]], from Farrell's unpublished short story \"What Ever Happened to Cousin Charlotte?\"\n\nAldrich conceived the project as a follow-up to his surprise success with the sensational melodrama ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'', also based on Farrell's novel and co-starring Davis and [[Joan Crawford]].\n\nOriginally, Davis and Crawford\u2014who had experienced a turbulent working relationship on the set of ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?''\u2014were cast as Charlotte and Miriam, respectively, but Crawford ultimately dropped out of the production after shooting began. Principal photography was temporarily postponed until de Havilland was recast in the role of Miriam. The film was a critical success and was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1927, young [[Southern belle]] Charlotte Hollis and her married lover John Mayhew plan to elope during a party at the Hollis family's [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] mansion in [[Ascension Parish, Louisiana]]. Charlotte's father, Sam, confronts John over the affair and intimidates him with the news that John's wife Jewel visited the day before and revealed the affair. John pretends to Charlotte he can no longer love her and that they must part. Shortly after, John is ambushed and [[Decapitation|decapitated]] in the summerhouse by an assailant with a cleaver. Charlotte returns to the house in a bloodstained dress, which all of the guests witness.\n\nThirty-seven years later, Charlotte, a [[spinster]], having inherited the estate after her father died, is tended to by her loyal housekeeper, Velma. In the intervening years, John's death has remained an [[Cold case|unsolved murder]], though it is commonly held that Charlotte was responsible. Despite notice from the Louisiana Highway Commission that she has been evicted from the property to make way for the impending construction of a new interstate, Charlotte is defiant, and threatens the demolition crew with a rifle. Seeking help in her fight against the Highway Commission, Charlotte summons Miriam, a poor cousin who lived with the family as a girl, but has since moved to [[New York City]] and become wealthy. Miriam returns and soon renews her relationship with Drew Bayliss, a local doctor who jilted her. Charlotte's sanity soon deteriorates following Miriam's arrival, her nights haunted by a mysterious [[harpsichord]] playing the song John wrote for her and by the appearance of his disembodied hand and head. Suspecting that Miriam and Drew are after Charlotte's money, Velma seeks help from Mr. Willis, an insurance investigator from England who is still fascinated by the case and who has visited Mayhew's ailing widow, Jewel; she gave him an envelope only to be opened after her death.\n\nMiriam fires Velma, who later returns to discover Charlotte has been drugged. Velma plans to expose Miriam's exploitation of Charlotte, but Miriam kills Velma with a chair and she falls down the stairs. Drew covers up the murder by declaring it an accident. One night, a drugged Charlotte runs downstairs in the grip of a hallucination, believing that John has returned to her. After Miriam tricks the intoxicated Charlotte into shooting Drew with a gun loaded with blanks, the two dispose of his body in a swamp. Charlotte returns to the house and witnesses the revived Drew walking downstairs after he returned, reducing her to insanity. Believing she has shattered Charlotte's mental state, Miriam celebrates with Drew in the garden, where they discuss the plan to have Charlotte committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] and usurp her fortune. Charlotte overhears the entire conversation from the balcony, except for Miriam's admission that she had witnessed Jewel kill John, and has been using the knowledge to [[blackmail]] Jewel throughout the years. Charlotte kills Miriam and Drew, pushing a large stone flowerpot off the stair balcony.\n\nThe next day, the authorities escort Charlotte from home, as a crowd gathers around to observe the spectacle. Charlotte receives an envelope from Mr Willis, which he received from Jewel (who died of a [[stroke]] after hearing of the incident which occurred on the previous night), ostensibly confessing to the murder of her husband John.  As the authorities leave with Charlotte, she looks back at the house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Charlotte Hollis\n* [[Olivia de Havilland]] as Miriam Deering\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Doctor Drew Bayliss\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Velma Cruther\n* [[Cecil Kellaway]] as Harry Willis\n* [[Mary Astor]] as Jewel Mayhew\n* [[Victor Buono]] as Big Sam Hollis\n* [[Wesley Addy]] as Sheriff Luke Standish\n* [[William Campbell (actor, born 1923)|William Campbell]] as Paul Merchand\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as John Mayhew\n* [[Frank Ferguson]] as editor\n* [[George Kennedy]] as the foreman\n* [[Percy Helton]] as funeral director \n* Carol Delay as Geraldine\n* Idell James as Ginny Mae\n* Robert Adler as Mr. Howard\n* [[Ellen Corby]], Marianne Stewart and [[Helen Kleeb]] as the town gossips\n* [[Lillian Randolph]], Geraldine West and Maye Henderson as the cleaning women\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and casting===\nFollowing the unexpected box office success of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), Aldrich wanted to make a film with similar themes for [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Bette Davis]]. Their feud was infamous and legendary, and they were not initially eager to repeat themselves. \nWriter [[Henry Farrell]], on whose [[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (novel)|novel]] the film had been based, had written an unpublished short story called \"What Ever Happened to Cousin Charlotte?\" that Aldrich envisioned as a suitable follow-up.{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|1995|p=25}} It told a similar story of a woman who manipulates a relative for personal gain, but for this film, Aldrich's idea was that the two actresses would switch the roles from the previous one, with Crawford playing the devious cousin trying to manipulate the innocent Davis into giving up her estate.<ref name=\"Slate piece\">{{cite news|last=Longworth|first=Karina|title=Did Bette and Joan Really Have a ''Feud''?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/you_must_remember_this/2017/03/did_bette_and_joan_really_feud_or_was_it_a_publicity_stunt.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=March 10, 2017|access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref> Aldrich's frequent collaborator, [[Lukas Heller]], wrote a draft of the screenplay, but was replaced by Farrell in late 1963.{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|1995|p=25}}\n\nThree other cast members from ''What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?'' were cast in ''Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte:'' [[Wesley Addy]], [[Dave Willock]] and [[Victor Buono]].\n\nThe cast included [[Mary Astor]], a friend of Davis' since their days at [[Warner Bros.]] Astor retired from acting and died in 1987.<ref name=\"tcm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78739/Hush-Hush-Sweet-Charlotte/articles.html|url-status=live|archive-date=June 2, 2020|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200602203313/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78739/Hush-Hush-Sweet-Charlotte/articles.html|last=LoBianco|first=Lorraine|title=Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964)|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|access-date=June 2, 2020}}</ref> She said: {{blockquote|My agent called: 'There's this cameo in a movie with Bette Davis.

However, the shoot was temporarily suspended on several occasions early on.{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|1995|p=24}} Initially, it was halted after a third-party lawsuit was brought against Davis by [[Paramount Pictures]] over a commitment to complete additional filming on ''[[Where Love Has Gone (film)|Where Love Has Gone]]'' (1964).{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|1995|p=24}} When this was resolved, filming recommenced.\n\nThe production was postponed again to allow Crawford to recover after she was admitted into the hospital due to an upper respiratory ailment, though Aldrich hired a [[private investigator]] to track her and determine whether or not she was actually ill.{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|1995|pages=24\u201325}} By August 4, 1964, the production had been suspended indefinitely, and the studio's insurance company insisted that Crawford be replaced, or else the film would have to be cancelled entirely.{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|1995|p=24}}\n\nAldrich sought several actresses to replace Crawford, including [[Loretta Young]], and [[Vivien Leigh]], but they were each either unable or unwilling to take the role.{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|1995|p=24}} Aldrich ultimately sought Olivia de Havilland for the part, and flew to her home in [[Switzerland]] to attempt to convince her to take the role.{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|1995|p=24}} de Havilland agreed and she subsequently flew to Los Angeles to begin filming.{{sfn|Silver|Ursini|pages=25\u201326}} In later interviews, de Havilland expressed displeasure with the film: \"I wasn't thrilled with the script, and I definitely didn't like my part. I was reverse-typecast, being asked to be an unsympathetic villain. It wasn't what people expected of me. It wasn't really what I wanted to do. Bette wanted it so much, so I did it. I can't say I regretted it, because working with her was special, but I can't say it was a picture I am proud to put on my resume.

So, instead of coming out funny, as did ''Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'', it comes out grisly, pretentious, disgusting and profoundly annoying.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F03E3DF1730E33ABC4C53DFB566838E679EDE|title=Movie Review \u2013 ''Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte'' \u2013 New Movie at Capitol Echoes ''Baby Jane''|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s reviewer wrote: \"Davis' portrayal is reminiscent of ''Jane'' in its emotional overtones, in her style of characterization of the near-crazed former Southern belle, aided by haggard makeup and outlandish attire.
