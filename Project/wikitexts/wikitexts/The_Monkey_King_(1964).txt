The film was created at the height of the Chinese animation industry in the 1960s, and received numerous awards, earning the brothers domestic and international recognition. The story is an adaptation of the earlier episodes of the 16th-century Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.\n\nThe stylized animation and drums and percussion accompaniment used in this film are heavily influenced by [[Peking opera]] traditions.\n\n==Creators==\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!

However, the project was delayed for over a decade after the Japanese capture of [[Shanghai]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and later by the [[Chinese Civil War]].\n\n[[Wan Laiming]] returned to [[Shanghai]] as director of [[Shanghai Animation Film Studio]] in 1954, and production of ''Havoc in Heaven'' resumed shortly thereafter. The first part of the film was completed in [[1961 in film|1961]] by [[Wan Laiming]] and [[Wan Guchan]]. The second part was completed in [[1964 in film|1964]] with the assistance of [[Wan Chaochen]] and [[Wan Dihuan]]. Both parts of the film were screened together for the first time in [[1965 in film|1965]]. This was the last major [[Chinese animation|animated film]] of the Second Golden Era of [[Cinema of China]]. A year later, the entire industry was effectively shut down by the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\n==Story==\n[[Image:HavocinHeaven1964.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Monkey King fights the god Nezha in Havoc in Heaven'', 1964]]\nThe story is based on the earliest chapters of the [[Ming Dynasty]] ''[[shenmo]]'' novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. The main character is [[Sun Wukong]], aka the Monkey King, who rebels against the Jade Emperor of heaven.\n \n===Part One===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2015}}\nAfter a brief prologue showing Sun Wukong being born out of a rock, the first act begins on the [[Mount Huaguo|Flower and Fruit Mountain]] with Wukong watching a military parade by his subjects. Delighted with their martial prowess, he decides to put on a display himself but accidentally breaks his royal sword. Annoyed at being unable to find a suitable weapon for himself, Wukong follows an old monkey's suggestion to visit the [[Dragon King of the East Sea|Dragon King of the Eastern Sea]] for a possible weapon.\n\nWukong then dives into the sea and travels to the Dragon King's palace where he asks for a neighborly gift of a weapon.\nThe Dragon King, amused by the arrogance, orders his soldiers to bring progressively heavier weapons, but Wukong dismisses them all as being too light and flimsy. The Dragon King then takes him to a great pillar which was used by the gods to pin down the sea during the great floods. The pillar is in fact the [[Ruyi Jingu Bang|As-you-will Cudgel]], a magical staff weighing eight tons that can change size and Sun Wukong happily takes the weapon. The Dragon King, not expecting Wukong to actually be able to take the great treasure, demands it back, but Wukong rebukes him, saying that the king should not have offered it if he did not want it taken, then returns to his kingdom.\n\nThe Dragon King goes to Heaven and petitions the [[Jade Emperor|Celestial Emperor]] for the return of the pillar and to punish Wukong.\n[[Li Jing (deity)|General Li]] quickly offers to send an army, but the God of the North Star suggests that Wukong be given a minor post in Heaven so that he can be kept under close supervision instead. The Emperor agrees to the plan.\n\nThe God of the North Star travels to the Flower and Fruit Mountain and tricks Wukong saying that he was to be honored with a title and a post in Heaven. Wukong travels to Heaven and is granted the post of \"[[Sun Wukong#Names and titles|Head of the Imperial Stables]]\", being misled to believe that it is a high-ranking duty. Wukong arrives at the stables and unhappy with the treatment of the horses, sets them loose, letting them roam freely. Wukong is complimented on the improved health and mood of the horses. Shortly afterwards, however, the General of the Imperial Cavalry arrives to inspect the stables and is furious that the horses are free instead of being stabled, and he confronts Wukong, who then realizes that he has been tricked. He easily defeats the General and returns to the Flower and Fruit Mountain.\n\nThe Imperial Court then hears that Wukong has claimed the title of \u2018Great Sage Equal of Heaven\u2019, and the furious Emperor orders General Li to capture Wukong. The general sends two of his best soldiers, including the god [[Nezha]], to challenge the Monkey King, but they are defeated easily. General Li threatens to return, but Wukong shouts back defiantly that he and his monkeys will be waiting.\n\n===Part Two===\n\nAn omitted part of the original release shows General Li interrupting the Emperor's tour of his land, requesting additional troops. The God of the North Star interjects, saying that subterfuge is required again and after a short argument, the Emperor agrees to his plan. A short scene of life under the protection of the Monkey King is cut short by the captured God of the North Star being brought to Wukong by monkey soldiers.\n\nThe second act opens with the God of the North Star trying to entice Wukong back to Heaven, but the Monkey King is wary, even with Heaven's acceptance of the Monkey King's title. The God makes comments about the Flower and Fruit Mountain, comparing it to the Heavenly Garden, extolling the beauty, scents and fruit compared to earthly delights. Intrigued, Wukong agrees to become the guardian of the Heavenly Garden, another minor post that he is misled to believe is important. Now assumed to be placated, he is left alone in the Garden where he eats the Empress\u2019 peaches of immortality.\n\nA procession of fairies comes to collect peaches for an important Imperial banquet where they are questioned by Wukong about the banquet's guests. When he hears that the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea had been invited, but not the \u2018Great Sage Equal of Heaven\u2019, Wukong realises he has been tricked again and flies into a rage. The fairies flee, but Wukong stops them with his magic. He goes to the Imperial banquet hall and after putting all the attendants to sleep, begins to sample the food and wine.\n\nThe drunken Monkey King suddenly becomes homesick and steals the entire banquet, putting it into a magical bag for his subjects. He then leaves for the Flower and Fruit Mountain but becomes lost due to his drunkenness, ending up at [[Lao Tzu]]\u2019s workshop where he eats the Emperor's [[Pill of Immortality|Pills of Immortality]]. The pills sober him up, allowing him to travel home where he is greeted enthusiastically by his monkeys and he opens the bag, allowing his monkeys to enjoy the stolen food.\n\nMeanwhile, the Empress discovers the remains of her banquet and petitions the Emperor to punish Wukong. The fairies then tearfully inform the Emperor that Wukong has eaten many of the peaches in the Heavenly Garden. Finally Lao Tzu comes and tells the Emperor that his Pills of Immortality have been stolen. This time, both General Li and the God of the North Star recommend military action.\n\nThe Heavenly army descends on the Flower and Fruit Mountain, where there is heavy fighting between the soldiers and well trained monkeys. Sun Wukong fights and defeats the [[Four Heavenly Kings]], who use a variety of weapons ranging from a sleep-inducing lute to a magical snake. General Li then sends in [[Erlang Shen]] and a troop of elite soldiers. Wukong uses his magic to make copies of himself and rapidly defeats the soldiers, then engages Erlang in a duel, which includes a memorable shapeshifting fight and Wukong's attempt to evade Erlang by transforming himself into a house.\n\nSeeing that Erlang and the Monkey are equally matched, Lao Tzu interferes, knocking Wukong unconscious, where he is quickly captured. Wukong is sentenced to death and a guillotine is used, but the blade breaks on the Monkey King's neck. A fire breather tries to burn Wukong to death, but he simply inhales the flames and exhales them over the fire breather, sending him running away on fire. A shower of golden arrows is then used, but only succeeds in sending Sun Wukong to sleep from boredom.\n\nLao Tzu suggests incinerating the Monkey King in his eight-way trigram furnace, since he is extremely durable due to his earlier consumption of the Pills of Immortality and the peaches.\nAfter days of burning Sun Wukong in the furnace, Lao Tzu opens it, expecting to see nothing but ash, but instead sees two glowing lights which he mistakes for two Pills of Immortality. Reaching in, he discovers that they are actually Wukong's eyes, hardened by the time in the furnace rather than weakened. Breaking free, he destroys the furnace then destroys most of the Imperial palace, routs the Imperial guards and causes the Emperor to flee in disarray. A finally triumphant Wukong returns to the Flower and Fruit Mountain where he is greeted by his cheering subjects.\n\n==Influence==\nThe name of the movie (\u5927\u95f9\u5929\u5bab) became a [[colloquialism]] in the Chinese language to describe someone making a mess. Countless cartoon adaptations that followed have reused the same classic story ''[[Journey to the West]],'' yet many consider this 1964 iteration to be the most original, fitting and memorable.<ref>China cis.net. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20050109073427/http://en.cis.net.cn/gb/news/news_detail.asp?id=290&class=1&pic= Cartoon Nostalgia].\" ''Chinese Animations.''

This edition is the original remastered Chinese version of the film, and contains Chinese subtitles in traditional and [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]]. An English-subtitled version of the film has not been released, but fan-made English subtitles can be downloaded (see links section). After much demand, the original 106 minute version was released on a two disc [[VCD]] set. It contains several omitted and extended scenes that weren't included on the 40th anniversary version for unknown reasons.\n\n==Blu-Ray release==\nIn 2012 the film was restored as well as being converted to 3D. The film's aspect ratio was changed from 1.33 to 1.78 by adding additional art to the backgrounds and at times moving the character placement within the frame. The film was shortened to 90 minutes by \"speed[ing] up some of the action scenes.\"  The score and dialogue were re-recorded for a new Dolby 5.1 and 7.1 mix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unseenfilms.blogspot.cz/2012/03/monkey-king-uproar-in-heaven-19611964.html|title=Monkey King Uproar in Heaven (1961/1964 restored 2012) NYICFF}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinesefilms.cn/1/2012/02/13/141s7291.htm |title=Interview: Restoring \"The Monkey King\" |access-date=2014-03-12 |archive-date=2012-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215085627/http://www.chinesefilms.cn/1/2012/02/13/141s7291.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* Won the outstanding film award at the 1978 [[London Film Festival|International London Film Festival]].\n* Won the 13th Special Interest award at the [[Czech Republic]] [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]].\n* Won the best art award and children's literature award at the 2nd Chinese film \"Hundred Flowers\" festival.\n\n==Production notes==\n* At the time, the film was also used as a joke metaphor for the \"[[Great Famine (China)|havoc]]\" being caused by [[Mao Zedong]] (the monkey) in \"heaven\" (China).<ref>Jonathan Clement homepage. \"[http://www.muramasaindustries.com/punditry/animation/chineseanimation/chineseanimation.html Jonathan Clement author] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106033630/http://www.muramasaindustries.com/punditry/animation/chineseanimation/chineseanimation.html |date=2007-01-06 }}.\" ''Chinese Animations.''
