It is followed by ''[[Manon des Sources (1986 film)|Manon des Sources]]''. The story takes place in rural [[Provence]], where two local farmers plot to trick a newcomer out of his newly inherited property. The film starred three of France's most prominent actors \u2013 [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], [[Daniel Auteuil]], who won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award for his performance, and [[Yves Montand]] in one of his last roles.\n\nThe film was shot [[Back to back film production|back to back]] with ''Manon des Sources'', over a period of seven months. At the time the most expensive French film ever made, it was a great commercial and critical success, both domestically and internationally, and was nominated for eight [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actor|C\u00e9sar]] awards, and 10 [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTA]]s. The success of the two films helped promote Provence as a tourist destination.\n\n==Plot {{anchor|Synopsis}}==\nThe story takes place outside a village in\u00a0[[Provence]], in the south of [[France]], shortly after the\u00a0First World War. Ugolin Soubeyran returns from his military service and throws himself into a project to grow\u00a0carnations on his property in the mountains. His uncle C\u00e9sar, referred to as Le Papet, meaning grandfather in the local dialect of French, is at first skeptical, but is convinced when the flowers get a good price at the market. They decide the project is worthy of expansion, and together they go to see the neighboring farmer, Pique-Bouffigue, to buy his land. The land in question is apparently dry, but Papet knows of a\u00a0spring\u00a0that could solve that problem.\n\nPique-Bouffigue does not want to sell, and an altercation breaks out. In the fight, Pique-Bouffigue is killed. After the funeral, Papet and Ugolin plug the spring that could water the land and cover it with cement and earth. Unknown to them, they are seen blocking the spring by a\u00a0poacher.\n\nThe property is inherited by Pique-Bouffigue's sister, Florette, who left the area long ago, but she dies very soon afterward and the inheritance goes to her son, Jean Cadoret, who is a tax collector and a hunchback. Ugolin, according to local custom, refers to him as Jean de Florette - Florette's Jean. To discourage Jean from taking up residence, Ugolin damages\u00a0the roof of the house.\n\nJean arrives with his wife, Aim\u00e9e, and young daughter, Manon. He makes it clear that he has no intention of selling. He intends to make the farm profitable within two years, breeding rabbits and growing their feed himself.\u00a0Jean does not know about the nearby blocked spring, only of one that is more distant, 2 kilometres away, though still on the property. He is relying on rainfall to fill a\u00a0cistern\u00a0to supply\u00a0the livestock and irrigate the crops.\u00a0Ugolin and Papet keep secret from Jean the fact that the area where Jean's farm lies rarely gets any rain. Meanwhile, they work to turn the local community against Jean, because the deceased Pique-Bouffigue has cousins in the village who know about the blocked spring and would tell Jean about it if they became friendly with him.\n\nJean initially makes progress and earns a small profit from his rabbit farm. In the long run, however, getting water proves a problem. Dragging it all the way from the distant spring is a backbreaking task. Jean asks to borrow Ugolin's mule, but Ugolin gives vague excuses. When the rain does come, it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed. The dusty winds of the\u00a0[[sirocco]] then arrive, bringing the farm near catastrophe. Jean decides to dig a\u00a0well.\u00a0\n\nUgolin tells Jean that his project is hopeless and that he might be better off selling. Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm, and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8,000\u00a0francs. However, it turns out that\u00a0Jean has no intention of selling, but wants to use the value of the property to take out a\u00a0mortgage. Papet decides that he will himself grant the mortgage, because that way he will either earn the\u00a0interest\u00a0or drive Jean away for good.\u00a0\n\nFrom the mortgage money Jean buys dynamite to finish the well, but in his first blast is hit by a flying rock, falls into the cavity, and subsequently dies of his injuries. Ugolin returns with the news to Papet, who asks him why he's crying. \"It is not me who's crying,\" he responds, \"it's my eyes.\"\n\nAim\u00e9e and Manon cannot remain on the farm, and Papet buys them out. As mother and daughter are packing their belongings, Papet and Ugolin go to where they blocked the spring and remove the plug. Manon follows them, and when she sees what they are doing, she understands and screams. The men hear it, but dismiss the sound as that of a\u00a0buzzard. Papet performs a mock baptism of his nephew in the water of the spring.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Yves Montand]] as C\u00e9sar Soubeyran / \"Le Papet\": In the local dialect \"Papet\" is an affectionate term for \"grandfather\".<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE3D71739F932A15755C0A961948260|title=Film; France's savoury tale of fate|last=Bernstein|first=Richard|date=21 June 1987|work=The New York Times|access-date=27 July 2008}}</ref> C\u00e9sar is the proud patriarch of a dying family, and his only known relative is his nephew Ugolin.

Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called ''[[The Water of the Hills|L'Eau des collines]]'' (The Water of the Hills).<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Berri came across Pagnol's book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. He decided that in order to do the story justice it had to be made in two parts.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n''Jean de Florette'' was filmed in and around the [[Vaucluse]] department of [[Provence]], where a number of different places have been mentioned as filming locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091288/locations|title=Filming locations for Jean de Florette (1986)|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=27 July 2008}}</ref> [[La Treille]], east of Marseille, in the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne department, was the village where Pagnol had shot the original film. The village is now within the city limits of [[Marseille]] and has undergone extensive development since the 1950s, so Berri had to find alternatives.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> For the village of the story he settled on [[Mirabeau, Vaucluse|Mirabeau]] (65&nbsp;km to the north), while Jean de Florette's house is located in [[Vaugines]], where the church from the film can also be found.<ref name=\"Times\"/> The market scenes were filmed in [[Sommi\u00e8res]] in the [[Gard]], and the story's Les Romarins was in reality [[Riboux]] in the [[Var (department)|Var]].<ref name=\"Powrie\" />\n\nExtensive work was put into creating a genuine and historically correct atmosphere for the film. The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted [[polystyrene]], to make them look older, and all electric wires were put underground.<ref name=\"Times\"/> Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen [[olive tree]]s twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 [[carnation]]s on the farm.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n''Jean de Florette'' and ''Manon des Sources'' were filmed together, over a period of thirty weeks, from May to December 1985. This allowed Berri to show the dramatic seasonal changes of the Proven\u00e7al landscape.<ref name=\"Powrie\"/> At 120 million French Franc ($17 million), it was at the time the most expensive film project in French history.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> The long filming period and the constantly increasing cost put a great burden on the actors, many of whom frequently had to return to Paris for television or theatre work.<ref name=\"Times\"/> Once completed, the release of the film was a great national event.
