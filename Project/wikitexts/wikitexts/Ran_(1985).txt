The plot derives from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' and includes segments based on legends of the ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' [[M\u014dri Motonari]]. The film stars [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging ''[[Sengoku period|Sengoku]]''-period [[warlord]] who decides to [[abdication|abdicate]] as ruler in favor of his three sons.\n\nLike most of Kurosawa's work in the 1970s and 80s, ''Ran'' is an international production, in this case a Japanese-French venture produced by [[Asmik Ace|Herald Ace]], [[Nippon Herald Films]], and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of ''Ran'' in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play ''King Lear'', Kurosawa began using it only after he had started preparations for ''Ran''. Following these preparations, Kurosawa filmed ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' in 1975, followed by ''[[Kagemusha]]'' in the early 1980s, before securing financial backing to film ''Ran''.\n\n''Ran'' was Kurosawa's third encounter with Shakespeare during his career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed ''[[Throne of Blood]]'', based on Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]''. In 1960, he directed the film ''[[The Bad Sleep Well]]'', based on ''[[Hamlet]]''. Despite the changes in setting and language, all three films have received critical acclaim.\n\nAs Kurosawa's last [[Epic Film|epic]], ''Ran'' has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]]. With a budget of $11 million it was the most expensive [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] produced up to that time. ''Ran'' was previewed on<!-- ONLY THE FIRST AND COUNTRY OF ORIGIN RELEASES -->  May 31, 1985, at the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]] before its release on June 1, 1985, in Japan. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of color;  [[costume design]]er [[Emi Wada]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]] for her work on ''Ran'', and Kurosawa received his only career nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. The distinctive [[film score]], inspired by [[Gustav Mahler]], was composed by [[Toru Takemitsu]].\n\n==Plot==\nHidetora Ichimonji, a powerful but elderly [[warlord]], decides to divide his kingdom among his three sons: Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. Taro, the eldest, will receive the prestigious First Castle and become leader of the Ichimonji clan, while Jiro and Saburo will be given the Second and Third Castles. Hidetora is to retain the title of Great Lord and Jiro and Saburo are to support Taro. However, Saburo is exiled after criticizing his father's lecture about unity. Hidetora's servant Tango is also exiled for defending Saburo.\n\nFollowing the division of Hidetora's lands between his remaining two sons, Taro's wife, Lady Kaede, still bitter about Hidetora killing her family and taking their land, successfully urges him to usurp control of the entire Ichimonji clan. When Taro demands Hidetora renounce his title, Hidetora leaves and travels to Jiro's castle, only to discover that Jiro is only interested in using Hidetora as a titular pawn. As Hidetora and his retinue wander, Tango warns Hidetora of Taro's new decree: death to whoever aids his father. Hidetora takes refuge in the Third Castle, abandoned after Saburo's forces followed him into exile. Kyoami, the court [[jester|fool]], then jokes about Hidetora's predicament, only to be thrown out of the Third Castle.\n\nLater, Hidetora and his retinue are attacked by Taro and Jiro's combined forces. Taro is killed by a bullet fired by Jiro's general, Kurogane. Hidetora is allowed to survive and succumbs to madness as he wanders away from the decimated castle. Kyoami and Tango, still loyal to Hidetora, find him and stay to assist. Hidetora is haunted by visions of the people he killed in the past. They take refuge in a peasant's home only to discover that the occupant is Tsurumaru, the brother of Lady Sue, Jiro's wife. Tsurumaru had his eyes gouged out by Hidetora's forces and was left impoverished due to Hidetora's siege. With Taro dead, Jiro becomes the Great Lord of the Ichimonji clan, and moves into the First Castle. Lady Kaede manipulates Jiro into having an affair with her, and demands that he kill Lady Sue, and marry her instead. Jiro orders Kurogane to do the deed, but he refuses, seeing through Kaede's perfidy. Kurogane then warns Sue and Tsurumaru to flee. Tango encounters former spies and before killing them, he is informed that Jiro is considering sending assassins after Hidetora. Tango rides off to alert Saburo. As his madness grows, Hidetora runs off into a volcanic plain.\n\nAfter Saburo's army enters Jiro's territory to find Hidetora, Jiro hastily mobilizes his army. After a truce, Saburo learns from Kyoami of Hidetora's potential location. After Saburo leaves, Jiro attacks Saburo's smaller forces, suffering losses, and orders his remaining forces to retreat after learning of another army marching on the First Castle. Saburo finds Hidetora, who partially recovers his sanity, and reconciles with Saburo. However, Saburo is killed by one of Jiro's snipers. Hidetora dies from grief. Tsurumaru and Sue arrive at the ruins of a castle, but inadvertently leave behind the flute that Sue gave him when he was banished. She gives him a picture of Amida Buddha for protection while she attempts to retrieve the flute. However, she never returns.\n\nAs the First Castle is besieged, Kurogane learns of Sue's death, and confronts Kaede. After she confesses her plot was revenge against the Ichimonji clan, she is killed by Kurogane. Jiro, Kurogane, and all Jiro's men subsequently die in battle. A funeral procession is held for Saburo and Hidetora. Meanwhile, left alone in the castle ruins, Tsurumaru trips, dropping the Amida Buddha image Sue had given to him. The film ends with a distant shot of Tsurumaru silhouetted against the castle's landscape atop the ruins.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as {{nihongo|Ichimonji Hidetora|\u4e00\u6587\u5b57 \u79c0\u864e}}, the film's equivalent to King Lear\n* [[Akira Terao]] as {{nihongo|Ichimonji \"Taro\" Takatora|\u4e00\u6587\u5b57 \u592a\u90ce \u5b5d\u864e}}, Hidetora's eldest son and heir, the film's equivalent to Goneril\n* [[Jinpachi Nezu]] as {{nihongo|Ichimonji \"Jiro\" Masatora|\u4e00\u6587\u5b57 \u6b21\u90ce \u6b63\u864e}}, Hidetora's second son, the film's equivalent to Regan\n* [[Daisuke Ryu]] as {{nihongo|Ichimonji \"Saburo\" Naotora|\u4e00\u6587\u5b57 \u4e09\u90ce \u76f4\u864e}}, Hidetora's youngest son, the film's equivalent to Cordelia\n* [[Mieko Harada]] as {{nihongo|Lady Kaede|\u6953\u306e\u65b9|Kaede no Kata}}, Taro's wife and the film's equivalent to Edmund\n* Yoshiko Miyazaki as {{nihongo|Lady Sue|\u672b\u306e\u65b9|Sue no Kata}}, Jiro's wife whose clan was destroyed by Hidetora and the rough equivalent to Albany, husband to Goneril\n* [[Mansai Nomura]] as {{nihongo|Tsurumaru|\u9db4\u4e38}}, Sue's brother who was blinded by Hidetora and is the film's Gloucester equivalent\n* [[Hisashi Igawa]] as {{nihongo|Kurogane|\u9244}}, Jiro's chief advisor and military commander\n* [[Peter (actor)|Peter]] as {{nihongo|Kyoami|\u72c2\u963f\u5f25|Ky\u014dami}}, the fool\n* Masayuki Yui as {{nihongo|Hirayama Tango|\u5e73\u5c71 \u4e39\u5f8c}}, Hidetora's main advisor, roughly analogous to Kent\n* Kazuo Kato as {{nihongo|Ikoma Kageyu|\u751f\u99d2 \u52d8\u89e3\u7531}}, an Ichimonji clan official\n* [[Jun Tazaki]] as {{nihongo|Ayabe Seiji|\u7dbe\u90e8 \u653f\u6cbb}}, a rival ''[[daimy\u014d]]''\n* [[Hitoshi Ueki]] as {{nihongo|Fujimaki Nobuhiro|\u85e4\u5dfb \u4fe1\u5f18}}, another rival ''daimy\u014d'', based somewhat on the King of France from the play.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Ran storyboards.jpg|thumb|left|Prior to filming, Kurosawa spent ten years storyboarding every shot in the film as paintings.

The film also used 200 [[horse]]s. Kurosawa loved filming in lush and expansive locations, and most of ''Ran'' was shot amidst the mountains and plains of [[Mount Aso]], Japan's largest active volcano. Kurosawa was granted permission to shoot at two of the country's most famous landmarks, the ancient castles at [[Kumamoto Castle|Kumamoto]] and [[Himeji Castle|Himeji]]. For the castle of Lady Sue's family, he used the ruins of the custom-constructed Azusa castle, made by Kurosawa's production crew near [[Mount Fuji]].<ref name=Positif/><ref>MTV News, \"Happy 444th Birthday, William Shakespeare, Screenwriter\", Mark Bourne, 04/22/2008, [http://www.mtv.com/news/2759127/happy-444th-birthday-william-shakespeare-screenwriter/].</ref><ref>Soundtrack of ''Ran''.

No miniatures were used for that segment, and Tatsuya Nakadai had to do the scene where Hidetora flees the castle in one take.<ref name=Positif/>  Kurosawa also filmed a scene that required an entire field to be sprayed gold, but cut it out of the final film during editing. The documentary ''[[A.K. (film)|A.K.]]'' shows the filming of the scene.\n\nKurosawa often shot scenes with three cameras simultaneously, each using different lenses and angles. Many [[Long shot|long-shots]] were employed and very few [[close-up]]s. On several occasions, Kurosawa used static cameras and suddenly brought the action into frame, rather than using the camera to track the action. He also used [[jump cut]]s to progress certain scenes, changing the pace of the action for filmic effect.<ref name=JimReview/>\n\nAkira Kurosawa's wife of 39 years, [[Y\u014dko Yaguchi]], died during the production of the film.

While he had directed over twenty films in the first two decades of his career, he directed just four in these two decades. After directing ''[[Red Beard]]'' (1965), Kurosawa discovered that he was considered old-fashioned and did not work again for almost five years. He also found himself competing against television, which had reduced Japanese film audiences from a high of 1.1 billion in 1958 to under 200 million by 1975. In 1968, he was fired from the [[20th Century Fox]] epic ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' over what he described as creative differences, but others said was a perfectionism that bordered on [[insanity]]. Kurosawa tried to start an independent production group with three other directors, but his 1970 film ''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' was a box-office flop and bankrupted the company.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prince|1999|p=5}}</ref>  Many of his younger rivals boasted that he was finished. A year later, unable to secure any domestic funding and plagued by ill health, Kurosawa attempted [[suicide]] by slashing his wrists. Though he survived, his misfortune continued to plague him until the late 1980s.\n\nKurosawa was influenced by the [[William Shakespeare]] play ''[[King Lear]]'' and borrowed elements from it.<ref name=Sragow/> Both depict an aging warlord who decides to divide up his kingdom among his children. Hidetora has three sons \u2013 Taro, Jiro, and Saburo \u2013 who correspond to Lear's daughters [[Goneril]], [[Regan]], and [[Queen Cordelia|Cordelia]]. In both, the warlord foolishly banishes anyone who disagrees with him as a matter of pride \u2013 in Lear it is the Earl of [[Kent]] and Cordelia; in ''Ran'' it is Tango and Saburo. The conflict in both is that two of the lord's children ultimately turn against him, while the third supports him, though Hidetora's sons are far more ruthless than Goneril and Regan. Both ''King Lear'' and ''Ran'' end with the death of the entire family, including the lord.\n\nThere are some crucial differences between the two stories. ''King Lear'' is a play about undeserved suffering, and Lear himself is at worst a fool. Hidetora, by contrast, has been a cruel warrior for most of his life: a man who ruthlessly murdered men, women, and children to achieve his goals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prince|1999|p=287}}</ref>  In ''Ran'', Lady Kaede, Lady Sue, and Tsurumaru were all victims of Hidetora. Whereas in ''King Lear'' the character of Gloucester had his eyes gouged out by Lear's enemies, in ''Ran'' it was Hidetora himself who gave the order to blind Tsurumaru. The role of the Fool has been expanded into a major character (Kyoami), and Lady Kaede serves as the equivalent of Goneril, but is given a more complex and important character.<ref name=JimReview>[http://jclarkmedia.com/film/filmreviewran.html Kurosawa's RAN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322081409/http://jclarkmedia.com/film/filmreviewran.html |date=2006-03-22 }}.

According to Michael Wilmington, Kurosawa told him that much of the film was a metaphor for nuclear warfare and the anxiety of the post-[[Hiroshima]] age.<ref>{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Wilmington | title=Apocalypse Song | date=December 19, 2005 | publisher=Criterion Collection|url=http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=316&eid=452&section=essay}}</ref> He believed that, despite all of the technological progress of the 20th century, all people had learned was how to kill each other more efficiently.<ref name=Bock>{{cite news |first=Audie |last=Bock |page=21 |title=Kurosawa on His Innovative Cinema |date=1981-10-04 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/04/movies/kurosawa-on-his-innovative-cinema.html}}</ref>  In ''Ran'', the vehicle for [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] destruction is the [[arquebus]], an early firearm that was introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Arquebuses revolutionized [[samurai]] warfare. Kurosawa had already dealt with this theme in his previous film ''[[Kagemusha]]'', in which the Takeda cavalry is destroyed by the arquebuses of the [[Oda clan|Oda]] and [[Tokugawa clan]]s.\n\nIn ''Ran'', the battle of Hachiman Field is an illustration of this new kind of warfare. Saburo's arquebusiers annihilate Jiro's cavalry and drive off his infantry by engaging them from the woods, where the cavalry are unable to venture. Similarly, Taro and Saburo's assassination by a sniper also shows how individual heroes can be easily disposed of on a modern battlefield. Kurosawa also illustrates this new warfare with his camera. Instead of focusing on the warring armies, he frequently sets the focal plane beyond the action, so that in the film they appear as abstract entities.<ref>{{cite video | people=Prince, Stephen (Commentary) | date=2005 | title=Ran | medium=Film | location=North America | publisher=Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe description of Hidetora in the first script was originally based on [[Toshiro Mifune]].<ref name=AsktheExpert/> However, the role was cast to [[Tatsuya Nakadai]], an actor who had played several supporting and major characters in previous Kurosawa films, such as Shingen and his double in ''[[Kagemusha]]''. Other Kurosawa veterans in ''Ran'' were Masayuki Yui (Tango), Jinpachi Nezu (Jiro) and [[Daisuke Ryu]] (Saburo), all of whom were in ''Kagemusha''. For [[Akira Terao]] (Taro) and [[Mieko Harada]] (Lady Kaede), ''Ran'' was their first Kurosawa film, but they would go on to work with him again in ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]''. [[Hisashi Igawa]] (Kurogane), who had previously been in Kurosawa's ''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'', would reappear in both ''Dreams'' and ''[[Rhapsody in August]]''. Kurosawa also hired two popular entertainers for supporting roles: singer-dancer [[Peter (actor)|Shinnosuke \"Peter\" Ikehata]] as Hidetora's loyal fool Kyoami and comedian-musician [[Hitoshi Ueki]] as rival warlord Nobuhiro Fujimaki. About 1,400 [[Extra (acting)|extras]] were employed.<ref>Conrad, David A. (2022). ''Akira Kurosawa and Modern Japan'', p198-200, McFarland & Co.</ref>\n\n===Acting style===\nWhile most of the characters in ''Ran'' are portrayed by conventional acting techniques, two performances are reminiscent of Japanese [[Noh]] theatre. Noh is a form of Japanese traditional theatre requiring highly-trained actors and musicians where emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures. The heavy, ghost-like make-up worn by [[Tatsuya Nakadai]]'s character, Hidetora, resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh performers. The body language exhibited by the same character is also typical of Noh theatre: long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. The character of Lady Kaede is also Noh-influenced. The Noh treatment emphasizes the ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures of these two characters.\n\n=== Music ===\nCraig Lysy, writing for ''Movie Music UK'', commented on the strengths of the film soundtrack's composer for Kurosawa's purposes: \"[[T\u014dru Takemitsu]] was Japan's preeminent film score composer and Kurosawa secured his involvement in 1976, during the project's early stages. Their initial conception of the score was to use tategoe, a \"shrill-voice\" chant style without instrumentation. Over the intervening years, Kurosawa's conception of the score changed dramatically. As they began production his desire had changed 180 degrees, now insisting on a powerful [[Gustav Mahler|Mahleresque]] orchestral score. Takemitsu responded with what many describe as his most romantic effort, one that achieved a perfect blending of Oriental and Occidental sensibilities.\"<ref>{{cite video|title=Music for the Movies: Toru Takemitsu|date=1995|publisher=Sony Classical Essential Classics|medium=DVD}}</ref><ref name=\"Lysy\">{{cite web |last=Lysy |first=Craig |url=https://moviemusicuk.us/2016/10/10/ran-toru-takemitsu/ |title= ''Movie Music UK'' |access-date=2017-06-08}}</ref>\n\nTakemitsu has stated that he was significantly influenced by the Japanese [[karma|karmic]] concept of ''[[Ma (negative space)|ma]]'', interpreted as a surplus of energy surrounding an abundant void. As Lysy stated: \"Takemitsu was guided in his efforts best summed up in the Japanese word ''ma'', which suggests the incongruity of a void abounding with energy. He related: 'My music is like a garden, and I am the gardener. Listening to my music can be compared with walking through a garden and experiencing the changes in light, pattern and texture.{{'\"}}<ref name=\"Lysy\" />\n\nThe project was the second of two which allowed Kurosawa and Takemitsu to collaborate, the first being ''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' in 1970. Lysy summarized the second project stating: \"the collaboration between Kurosawa and the temperamental Takemitsu was rocky. Kurosawa constantly sent Takemitsu notes, which only served to infuriate him, so he frequently visited the set to gain a direct sensual experience. Takemitsu actually resigned... Fortunately, producer Masato Hara intervened, made peace, and Takemitsu returned to the film. Years later, Takemitsu would relate: \"Overall, I still have this feeling of&nbsp;... 'Oh, if only he'd left more up to me'&nbsp;... But seeing it now&nbsp;...
