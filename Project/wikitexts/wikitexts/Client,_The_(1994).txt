It is based on the [[The Client (novel)|1993 novel]] by [[John Grisham]]. It was filmed in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]].\n\n''The Client'' was theatrically released in the United States on July 20, 1994 and was a box-office hit, grossing $117.6 million against a $45 million budget. It received positive reviews from critics, with Sarandon's, Jones's and Renfro's performance in particular earning high praise.\n\n== Plot ==\nEleven-year-old Mark Sway and his little brother, Ricky, are smoking cigarettes in the woods near their home when they encounter mob lawyer W. Jerome Clifford. Clifford tells Mark that he is about to kill himself to avoid being murdered by Barry \"The Blade\" Muldano, the nephew of notorious mob kingpin Johnny Sulari. Ricky becomes [[catatonia|catatonic]] after witnessing the suicide and is hospitalized at Saint Peter Charity Hospital. Authorities \u2013 and the mob \u2013 realize that Clifford probably told Mark where a Louisiana senator, murdered by Muldano, is buried.\n\nMark meets Regina \"Reggie\" Love, a lawyer and recovering alcoholic, who agrees to represent him. They quickly run afoul of \"Reverend\" Roy Foltrigg, a celebrated and vain US Attorney who is using the case as a springboard for his political ambitions. In the meantime, it is revealed that Sulari never authorized Muldano to kill the senator and wants Muldano to uncover how much the boys know. Muldano is also ordered to move the body, but he is unable to because it is buried in Clifford's boathouse, and police are still on the property investigating his suicide.\n\nFoltrigg continues to use legal means to get Mark to reveal where the body is hidden, while Sulari orders Muldano to kill the children and Reggie. He also orders the body to be moved once the investigation at Clifford's home is concluded. Mark is threatened in a hospital elevator by Mafia member Paul Gronke, and is unable to talk to Foltrigg.\n\nMark and Reggie go to New Orleans to confirm that the body is on Clifford's property. Reggie intends to use this information to broker a deal with Foltrigg to get Ricky specialized medical care and place the family in the witness protection program. Reggie and Mark arrive at Clifford's house the same night as Muldano and his accomplices. They are digging up the body, but a melee follows when Mark and Reggie are discovered. Muldano and the others flee after Reggie trips the neighbors' alarm.\n\nFoltrigg agrees to Reggie's demands in exchange for information about the body's location. Before the Sway family leaves to restart their lives under new identities, Mark and Reggie share a heartfelt goodbye. While Muldano gets angry at his fellow mob members for messing up, Sulari becomes fed up with Muldano and sends him off to be killed. With the body recovered, Foltrigg is a lock-in for the media headlines he craves, and mentions that he intends to run for governor.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Regina \"Reggie\" Love\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as U.S. Attorney Roy \"Reverend Roy\" Foltrigg\n* [[Brad Renfro]] as Mark Sway\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Dianne Sway\n* David Speck as Ricky Sway\n* [[Anthony LaPaglia]] as Barry \"The Blade\" Muldano\n* [[J.
