It stars [[Sean Rogerson]], Ashleigh Gryzko, [[Merwin Mondesir]], [[Mackenzie Gray]], and Juan Riedinger as the crew of a [[Paranormal television|paranormal]] [[Reality television|reality]] [[television program]] who lock themselves in a supposedly haunted [[psychiatric hospital]] in search of evidence of paranormal activity, as they shoot what ends up becoming their final episode.\n\n''Grave Encounters'' premiered on April 22, 2011, at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]]. Prior to its premiere, its trailer went [[Viral video|viral]] online, generating over 30 million views. The film had a limited theatrical run in select theaters in the United States, and was released on [[video-on-demand]] on August 25, 2011. Two months prior, the film had its Italian premiere via distributor Eagle Pictures under the title ''ESP Fenomeni Paranormali''.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews, was a box office success,<ref name=bom/> spawned [[Grave Encounters 2|a sequel]] in 2012, and has attained a [[cult following]] since its release.\n\n==Plot==\nJerry Hartfield is the producer of ''Grave Encounters'', a paranormal reality television program directed by [[ghost hunting|ghost hunter]] Lance Preston. Hartfield explains that the show was cancelled after five episodes following the disappearance of its crew, and presents raw scenes from recovered footage of the sixth and final episode. The ''Grave Encounters'' crew consists of Lance, [[occult]] specialist Sasha Parker, surveillance operator Matt White, cameraman T.C. Gibson, and fake [[Mediumship|medium]] Houston Grey. The crew is invited to examine the abandoned Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital, where unexplained phenomena have been reported for years. Kenny, the hospital's caretaker, takes the crew on a day tour and informs them of the hospital's history, particularly of a doctor named Arthur Friedkin, who performed unethical experiments and [[Lobotomy|lobotomies]] on the hospital's patients before being killed by them.\n\nThe crew lock themselves inside the hospital for the night and begin their investigation, setting up camp near the main entrance and positioning static cameras throughout the building. No paranormal activity seems to occur within the first few hours until T.C. captures a door slamming behind him. The crew attempts to establish contact with any entities that might be in the hospital; they soon hear unexplained sounds, and Sasha's hair appears to be lifted into the air by an unseen force. They return downstairs to pack in preparation for Kenny's return. Matt sets out alone to retrieve the static cameras. Before Matt can retrieve the last camera, a loud banging noise grabs Matt's attention and he walks off to investigate it.\n\nWhen neither Matt nor Kenny returns, the crew forces the front doors open but discover that it leads to another hallway. They aimlessly walk the hallways and realize that despite their clocks saying it's dawn, it is still dark outside. The crew return to the lobby and sleep but are awoken when the construction light they set up falls forward and breaks. T.C. tells Lance that there is a fire escape on the roof and they head off to find a stairwell with rooftop access. They are successful but find that the stairs are blocked off by a randomly built wall blocking their escape.\n\nThey decide to back track and while looking at a map on the wall, the arrows on their compass spin in random directions. The group hear what sounds like Matt screaming and run through the halls hoping to find him. \nOnce they find the room where they heard Matt's screams, they encounter a metal bed frame that levitates into the air and they run in terror. The crew stops to rest and when they wake up, they find the word \"HELLO\" scratched onto Sasha's back. They once again go looking for Matt after hearing his voice on the walkie-talkie. The group comes across a woman in a hospital gown and when they catch up with her, her face distorts grotesquely. They flee from the entity in fear, and Houston is separated from the other crew members. Houston wanders the halls in the darkness and is then lifted into the air and choked before a bright light bursts from the end of the hallway which sends Houston flying and kills him. After hiding in a room for several hours, Lance, Sasha, and T.C. discover that they have been fitted with hospital identification bracelets bearing their names. The trio roam the halls again and an arm smashes through the window on a door and grabs Sasha. Lance frees her and they run down the hallways. While Lance comforts Sasha, T.C. yells at them to come into a room which Matt is sitting in. Matt, wearing a hospital gown and now insane, mumbles incoherently and claims that they can leave the building once they are \"better\".\n\nThe four rest inside a room and when they wake up, several hands are reaching through the ceiling and walls. The group flee into a room full of bathtubs and find Matt staring down at a bathtub full of blood. T.C. attempts to pull Matt away from the tub, but a figure emerges from the blood and drags T.C. into it. Sasha and Lance tip the tub over but T.C. is not inside it which causes Sasha and Matt to become hysterical. Lance finds an elevator but struggles to pull the doors open. He leaves Sasha and Matt behind to look for something to try open the doors. Lance yanks a rod off of a hospital cart and notices a bloody severed tongue in the corner of the room. Lance then sees a ghostly figure huddled up in the corner of the ceiling which chases after him. Lance makes it back to Sasha and Matt and successfully tries opening the elevator doors. He hears the figure making its way to them, so Lance and Sasha keep the entity at bay by keeping the door closed. While the two are busy, Matt leans forward and plunges several feet down the elevator shaft, killing himself.\n\nLance and Sasha enter the tunnels beneath the building in search of an exit. Sasha falls ill and begins to cough up blood violently.  The two stop to sleep and Sasha is abducted by a mist. Lance, now all by himself, wanders the tunnels for several hours. An increasingly unstable Lance wanders the tunnels alone and feeds on live rats to survive. Lance passes out and after waking up, finds a door leading into Friedkin's operating room, which contains evidence of occult rituals and graphic photos of his operations. He sees apparitions of Friedkin and several nurses, and is dragged away from his camera.
