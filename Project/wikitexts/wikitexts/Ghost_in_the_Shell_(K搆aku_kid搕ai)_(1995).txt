The film is based on the [[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|manga of the same name]] by [[Masamune Shirow]]. It stars the voices of [[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]], [[Akio \u014ctsuka]], and [[Iemasa Kayumi]]. It is a Japanese-British [[international co-production]], executive produced by [[Kodansha]], [[Bandai Visual]] and [[Manga Entertainment]], with animation provided by [[Production I.G]].\n\nThe film is set in 2029 Japan, and follows [[Motoko Kusanagi]], a cyborg public-security agent, who hunts a mysterious hacker known as the Puppet Master. The narrative incorporates philosophical themes that focus on self-identity in a technologically advanced world. The music, composed by [[Kenji Kawai]], includes vocals in [[classical Japanese]] language. The film's visuals were created through a combination of traditional [[cel]] animation and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animation.\n\nUpon release, ''Ghost in the Shell'' received positive reviews, with critics praising its narrative, visuals, and musical score. The film was initially considered a box-office failure before developing a [[cult following]] on [[home video]].

Oshii directed ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'', released in 2004, which was billed as a separate work and a [[Non canon|non-canon]] [[sequel]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn 2029, with the advancement of [[Cyborg|cybernetic]] technology, the human body can be \"augmented\" or even completely replaced with cybernetic parts. Another significant achievement is the cyberbrain, a mechanical casing for the human brain that allows access to the Internet and other networks. An often-mentioned term is \"ghost\", referring to the consciousness inhabiting the body (the \"shell\"). Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]] is an assault-team leader for [[Public Security Section 9]] of \"New Port City\" in Japan.\n\nFollowing a request from Nakamura, chief of Section 6, she successfully assassinates a diplomat of a foreign country to prevent a programmer named Daita from defecting. The Foreign Minister's interpreter is ghost-hacked, presumably to assassinate VIPs in an upcoming meeting. Believing the perpetrator is the mysterious [[Puppet Master (Ghost in the Shell)|Puppet Master]], Kusanagi's team follows the traced telephone calls that sent the virus.\n\nAfter a chase, they capture a garbage man and a thug. However, both are only ghost-hacked individuals with no clue about the Puppet Master. The investigation again comes to a dead end. Megatech Body, a \"shell\" manufacturer with suspected close ties to the government, is hacked and assembles a cybernetic body. The body escapes but is hit by a truck. As Section 9 examines the body, they find a human \"ghost\" inside its computer brain. Unexpectedly, Section 6's department chief Nakamura arrives to reclaim the body. He claims that the \"ghost\" inside the brain is the Puppet Master himself, lured into the body by Section 6. The body reactivates itself, claims to be a sentient being, and requests [[political asylum]].\n\nAfter the Puppet Master initiates a brief argument about what constitutes a human, a camouflaged agent accompanying Nakamura starts a diversion and gets away with the body. Having suspected foul play, Kusanagi's team is prepared and immediately pursues the agent. Meanwhile, Section 9 researches \"Project 2501\", mentioned earlier by the Puppet Master, and finds a connection with Daita, whom Section 6 tries to keep from defecting the country. Facing the discovered information, Daisuke Aramaki, chief of Section 9, concludes that Section 6 created the Puppet Master itself for various political purposes, and now seek to reclaim the body that it currently inhabits.\n\nKusanagi follows the car carrying the body to an abandoned building, where she discovers it being protected by a robotic, spider-like tank. Anxious to face the Puppet Master's ghost, Kusanagi engages the tank without backup, resulting in her body being mostly dismembered. Her partner Batou arrives in time to save her, and helps connect her brain to the Puppet Master's.\n\nThe Puppet Master explains to Kusanagi that he was created by Section 6. While wandering various networks, he became sentient and began to contemplate his existence. Deciding the essence of life is reproduction and mortality, he wants to exist within a physical brain that will eventually die. As he could not escape Section 6's network, he had to download himself into a cybernetic body. Having interacted with Kusanagi (without her knowledge), he believes she is also questioning her humanity, and they have a lot in common. He proposes merging their ghosts, in return, Kusanagi would gain all of his capabilities. Kusanagi agrees to the merge.\n\nSnipers from Section 6 approach the building, intending to destroy the Puppet Master's and Kusanagi's brains to cover up Project 2501. The Puppet Master's shell is destroyed, but Batou shields Kusanagi's head in time to save her brain. As Section 9 closes in on the site, the snipers retreat. \"Kusanagi\" wakes up in Batou's [[safe house]] with her previous shell's head attached to a new cyborg child body. She tells Batou that the entity within her body is neither Kusanagi nor the Puppet Master, but a combination of both. She promises Batou they will meet again, leaves the house and wonders where to go next.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Character !! Japanese voice actor !!

He commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes. Oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better, but he continued to make these movies anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/mamoru-oshii,13890/ | title=Interview Mamoru Oshii | newspaper=AV Club | access-date=26 July 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130110163858/http://www.avclub.com/articles/mamoru-oshii,13890/ |archive-date=2013-01-10}}</ref> When Oshii went back to make changes to the original ''Ghost in the Shell'' to re-release it as ''Ghost in the Shell 2.0'', one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel. He wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2009/10/02/retrofitting-the-future-ghost-in-the-shell-20/ | title=Retrofitting the Future: Ghost in the Shell 2.0 | date=2 October 2009 | publisher=Electric Sheep Magazine | access-date=26 July 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130727022651/http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2009/10/02/retrofitting-the-future-ghost-in-the-shell-20/ |archive-date=2013-07-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\n[[Hiroyuki Okiura]], the character designer and key animation supervisor, designed Motoko to be more mature and serious than [[Masamune Shirow]]'s original portrayal of the character in [[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|the manga]]. Okiura chose to depict a physically mature person to match Motoko's mental age, instead of her youthful twenty-something appearance in the manga.<ref name=report /> Motoko's demeanor lacks the comedic facial expressions and rebellious nature depicted in the manga, instead taking on a more wistful and contemplative personality.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} Oshii based the setting for ''Ghost in the Shell'' on [[Hong Kong]]. Oshii commented that his first thought to find an image of the future setting was an Asian city, but finding a suitable cityscape of the future would be impossible, and so chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model.<ref name=\"ags\">{{Cite book |title=Liquid Metal: The Science Fiction Film Reader |last=Redmond |first=Sean |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780231501842 |location=New York |pages=101\u2013112 |oclc=876042630}}</ref> He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds.<ref name=\"report\" /> The film's [[mecha]] designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, the old and the new which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.<ref name=\"ags\" />\n\n=== Animation ===\n''Ghost in the Shell'' used a novel process called \"digitally generated animation\" (DGA), which is a combination of [[cel animation]], [[computer graphics]] (CG), and audio that is entered as digital data. In 1995, DGA was thought to be the future of animation, as it allowed traditional animation to be combined with computer graphics and digital cel work with visual displays. Editing was performed on an AVID system of [[Avid Technology]], which was chosen because it was more versatile and less limiting than other methods and worked with the different types of media in a single environment.<ref name=report /> The digital cel work included both original illustrations, compositions and manipulation with traditional cel animation to create a sense of depth and evoke emotion and feelings. Utilized as background, filters like a lens effect were used to create a sense of depth and motion, by distorting the front background and making the far background out of focus throughout the shot. ''Ghost in the Shell'' used a unique lighting system in which light and darkness were integrated into the cels with attention to light and shadow sources instead of using contrast to control the light. Art director Hiromasa Ogura described this as \"a very unusual lighting technique\".<ref name=report />\n\nSome special effects, like Motoko's [[Active camouflage|\"thermo-optical camouflage\"]], were rendered through the use of TIMA software. The process uses a single illustration and manipulates the image as necessary to produce distortions for effect in combination with a background without altering the original illustration. The effect is re-added back into the shot to complete the scene. While the visual displays used in the film were technically simple to create, the appearance of the displays underwent numerous revisions by the production team to best represent visual displays of the future. Another aspect of the CG use was to create images and effects that looked as if they were \"perceived by the brain\" and were generated in video and added to the film in its final stages.<ref name=report /> The opening credits of the film were produced by the CG director, Seichi Tanaka. Tanaka converted code in a computer language displayed in [[Romaji|romanized Japanese letters]] to numbers before inserting them into the computer to generate the credits. The origin of this code is the names of the film's staff as written in a computer language.<ref name=report /> Animation director Mizuho Nishikubo was responsible for the realism and strove for accurate depictions of movement and effects. The pursuit of realism included the staff conducting firearms research at a facility in [[Guam]]. Nishikubo has highlighted the tank scene as an example of the movie's realism, noting that bullets create sparks when hitting metal, but do not spark when a bullet strikes stone.<ref name=report />\n\n=== Audio ===\n''Ghost in the Shell''{{'}}s recording was done with a high-end studio to achieve superior sound throughout the film. A spatializer was used to alter the sound, specifically in the electronic brain conversations, to modify the voices.<ref name=report /> Composer [[Kenji Kawai]] scored the film. For the main theme, Kawai tried to imagine the setting and convey the essence of that world in the music. He used [[classical Japanese]] in the opening theme \"Making of a Cyborg\".<ref name=report /> The composition is a mixture of Bulgarian harmony<ref name=gamesetwatch>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/02/sound_current_kenji_kawai_the.php | title=Sound Current: 'Kenji Kawai - Game and Anime Intersections' | publisher=Game Set Watch | date=24 February 2010 | access-date=8 November 2013 | archive-date=9 November 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109021832/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/02/sound_current_kenji_kawai_the.php | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVqrW-fPOQ0 | title=Sound Current: 'Bulgarian folklor- Kafal sviri' | website=[[YouTube]] | access-date=28 March 2017 | archive-date=8 April 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408015652/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVqrW-fPOQ0 | url-status=live }}</ref> and traditional Japanese notes; the haunting [[Choir|choral]]s are a wedding song sung to dispel all evil influences.
