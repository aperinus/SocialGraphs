Set in Scotland, the film tells the story of Liam, a teenage boy from a troubled background who dreams of starting afresh with his mother as soon as she has completed her prison term. Liam's attempts to raise money for the two of them are set against the backdrop of the [[Inverclyde]] towns of [[Greenock]], [[Port Glasgow]] and the coast at [[Gourock]].\n\nThe film is often shown with subtitles because, as with many of Loach's films, the dialogue is extensively in a local dialect, in this case the Inverclyde variant of [[Scottish English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12396377.english-subtitles-on-film-set-in-scotland/|title='English' subtitles on film set in Scotland |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=21 February 2005|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> a similar dialect and accent to [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/loach-film-may-be-subtitled-for-english-audience-185427.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220526/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/loach-film-may-be-subtitled-for-english-audience-185427.html |archive-date=26 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Loach film may be subtitled for English audience|date=23 July 2002|access-date=27 October 2018|newspaper=The Independent|location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|film|date=October 2022}}<!-- Needs to be under 700 words per [[MOS:FILMPLOT]] -->\nIn a few weeks, [[Scottish people|Scottish]] teenager Liam will turn 16. He and his friends exemplify the violent \"[[Ned (Scottish)|ned]]\" subculture; they no longer attend school, but instead, hang around isolated areas or wander about all day long. They obtain money by illicitly selling untaxed cigarettes in a pub, and defy the police. Liam's mother is currently in prison for a crime she did not commit. She will be released in a few weeks, in time for her son's 16th birthday. She has a boyfriend named Stan, who works as a drug dealer with Liam's grandfather, Rab.\n\nStan and Rab take Liam to visit his mother in [[HM Prison Cornton Vale|Cornton Vale Prison]], attempting to force him to smuggle drugs to his mother while they create a distraction. In the event, Liam refuses to cooperate by passing the drugs over. When driving home, his companions beat him up; he fights back and flees. Liam arrives back to find that he has been expelled from his grandfather's [[apartment|flat]], and his belongings thrown down into the front garden. Liam then moves into his sister Chantelle's nearby home in [[Port Glasgow]]. Chantelle agrees to let Liam live in her house if he is good to Chantelle's little son, Calum. She has been taking free evening classes to get work in a [[call centre]], and implores Liam to do the same because she wants Liam to do something more \"constructive\" with his own life.\n\nWhen Liam takes Calum for a walk along Greenock Esplanade, his friend Pinball arrives in a stolen car and insists on taking them [[Joyride (crime)|joyriding]] along the coast. They drive up through the [[Cloch]] [[Travel trailer|caravan]] (trailer) park where Liam sees a caravan for sale in a spot overlooking the scenic [[Firth of Clyde]]. Liam, who loves his mother very much, fantasizes that he, his sister, and his mother can escape to the seaside and live in the caravan, away from Stan and Rab's wrath. To purchase it, he and Pinball steal a delivery of drugs from Stan's house and sell them, doing the very things Liam once hated\u2014claiming that they will never get anywhere by selling cheap cigarettes. They soon develop \"entrepreneur skills\" and raise several thousand pounds, which they pay as a deposit towards the caravan in Liam's mother's name.\n\nLiam's efforts attract the attention of the local drug \"godfather\", Tony Douglas. Liam, who only wanted a peaceful life with his mother, agrees to work with them after the local godfather tells him to 'stay away from our shops'. Pinball, meanwhile, is thrown into the health club showers due to his disrespectful manner towards the dealer, and vows revenge. Liam and Pinball carry on selling drugs to the local area, with the help of Liam's other friends who deliver pizzas. Liam and Pinball meet again with members of the drug godfather's gang, and Liam joins them in their car. Pinball is kicked out, angering him further; the gang members advise Liam to 'dump' Pinball for good. They take Liam to a [[Glasgow]] nightclub and instruct him that he has to kill someone to join the gang. Liam attempts to do so, but is stopped by the gang, who inform him it was a test (which he has passed).\n\nLiam, Chantelle, Calum and Suzanne (Chantelle's friend) drive to the caravan to have a picnic, only to discover that it has been burned down. Liam believes it was Stan who did it. That evening, Pinball turns up in Douglas's (stolen) car, telling Liam that he wants revenge. He proceeds to crash the car into the health club. Liam speaks to the godfather in the morning and, to his chagrin, is ordered to \"take care of\" the Pinball problem (i.e. to kill his friend). The next morning, Pinball\u2014aware of Liam's intentions\u2014first tries to stab Liam, then proudly tells him that he is the one who burnt down the caravan, not Stan. He then cuts his own face in rage. Liam is seen reassuring his injured friend after phoning for an ambulance, but he then notifies the godfather that the deed has \"been done\", implying that he has indeed murdered his friend.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Simon|title=Anywhere but Scotland?

She appears uneasy, and the next morning is found to have escaped to Stan's house. Liam blames this on Chantelle. Chantelle, now fully aware that Liam is dealing drugs, attempts to warn him about their mother probably not being so thankful for Liam's efforts because she is too devoted to Stan, but this only provokes Liam even further. An enraged Liam goes to Stan's house, trying to convince his mother to return to their new home, only to be insulted by Stan. In a struggle, Liam stabs Stan.\n\nLiam walks alone on the stony beach. He is phoned by Chantelle, who reminds him that the day is his 16th birthday. She also tells him that the police have been looking for him, but that after everything that he has done, Chantelle still loves him. He walks towards the sea.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Compston]] as Liam\n* Annmarie Fulton as Chantelle\n* [[William Ruane (actor)|William Ruane]] as Pinball\n* Junior Walker as Nighttime\n* Gary McCormack as Stan\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{div col|colwidth=48em}}\n*The Arrival of the Night Queen from ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] \u2013 Performed by Failoni Kamerazenekar and Helen Kwon\n*I'll Stand by You \u2013 Written by [[Tom Kelly (musician)|Tom Kelly]], [[Billy Steinberg]] and [[Chrissie Hynde]] \u2013 Performed by [[The Pretenders]]\n*Burn in Hell \u2013 Written by Otten/Skog/Tell/Torstensen \u2013 Performed by [[Clawfinger]]\n*Dogman \u2013 Written by Tristan Hervo \u2013 Performed by Wide Open Cage\n*Bushes \u2013 Written by Markus Nikolai, Theo Krieger, [[Clair Dietrich]] \u2013 Performed by [[Markus Nikolai]]\n*Ain't No Love \u2013 Written by [[Melanie Williams]], [[Jimi Goodwin]], [[Jez Williams]], [[Andy Williams]] \u2013 Performed by Sub Sub\n*Let Me Entertain You \u2013 Written by [[Robbie Williams]] and [[Guy Chambers]] \u2013 Performed by Robbie Williams\n*You Stole the Sun from my Heart \u2013 Written by [[James Dean Bradfield]], [[Nicky Wire]], [[Sean Moore (musician)|Sean Moore]] \u2013 Performed by [[Manic Street Preachers]]\n*I Go to Sleep \u2013 Written and Composed by [[Ray Davies]] \u2013 Performed by The Pretenders\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe premiere of ''Sweet Sixteen'' was at the UGC in central Glasgow on 1 October 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11914870.sweet-welcome-for-loach-premiere/ |title=Sweet welcome for Loach premiere |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow|date=2 October 2002 |access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref> ''Sweet Sixteen'' received very positive reviews, currently holding a 97% \"fresh\" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 88 critics; the consensus states: \"A bleak, but heartbreaking coming-of-age tale that resonates with truth.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=The Innkeepers |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sweet_sixteen/ |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2012-10-22}}</ref> ''Sweet Sixteen'' was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] and won the Best Screenplay Award at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]].
