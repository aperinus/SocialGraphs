Doctorow]]. The film is set in and around turn-of-the-century New York City, [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], and [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], and includes fictionalized references to actual people and events of the time. The film stars [[James Olson (actor)|James Olson]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Howard Rollins]], [[Brad Dourif]], and [[Elizabeth McGovern]], features the final film appearances of [[James Cagney]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]], and features early appearances, in small parts, by [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ethan Phillips]], and [[John Ratzenberger]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the turn of the 20th century, architect [[Stanford White]] unveils a nude statue atop Madison Square Garden, modeled after former chorus girl [[Evelyn Nesbit]]. After learning of this, Nesbit's husband, billionaire industrialist [[Harry Kendall Thaw]], becomes convinced White has corrupted her and publicly shoots him dead.\n\nAn upper-class family resides in [[New Rochelle, New York]], where Father owns a factory where his wife's Younger Brother makes fireworks. An African American baby is abandoned in their garden, and upon learning the police intend to charge the child's mother, Sarah, with child abandonment and attempted murder, Mother takes Sarah and her child into the home despite Father's objections. Ragtime pianist Coalhouse arrives in search of Sarah, driving a new [[Ford Model T]], and realizing he is the baby's father, announces his intention to marry Sarah.\n\nYounger Brother witnesses White's murder and becomes obsessed with Evelyn. Thaw's lawyer Delmas bribes Evelyn with a million-dollar divorce settlement to keep silent about Thaw's mental instability and to testify that White abused her. Passing through the Lower East Side, Evelyn encounters street artist Tateh, who throws out his unfaithful wife. He leaves New York with their daughter and sells the [[flip book]] he created. Evelyn and Younger Brother begin an affair as she prepares her return to the stage, while he assumes they will eventually marry. After Thaw is found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity, his lawyers inform Evelyn that Thaw will sue her for divorce on the grounds of infidelity and she accepts a smaller settlement. The affair ends, leaving Younger Brother adrift.\n\nIn New Rochelle, Coalhouse is targeted by bigoted [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firemen]] led by Willie Conklin, who refuse to allow his automobile to pass by. Coalhouse finds a policeman and returns to find his car soiled with [[horse manure]]. Coalhouse attempts to force the policeman to intervene, but the policeman insists that Colehouse should clean the manure off his car and move on, giving him the choice to do so or be arrested. Colehouse refuses, and is hauled in to the local [[police precinct|precinct]]. After Father arranges for Coalhouse's release, they discover his car has been further vandalized. Coalhouse pursues legal action, but can find no lawyer willing to represent him. Father and Younger Brother argue over Coalhouse's legal recourse. At a presidential rally, Sarah attempts to tell President Roosevelt about Coalhouse's case but is beaten by guards and dies.\n\nAfter Sarah's funeral, Coalhouse and his supporters kill several firemen. He threatens to attack other firehouses, demanding his car be restored and Conklin be turned over to him. Father is disgusted at the violence but Younger Brother joins Coalhouse's gang with his knowledge of explosives. Ostracized by their own white community and hounded by reporters, Father and Mother leave for Atlantic City. They encounter Tateh, now a film director on a photoplay with Evelyn. Mother is attracted to Tateh and she and Father quarrel. Coalhouse's gang hold the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Pierpont Morgan Library]]'s collection hostage. Police Commissioner [[Rhinelander Waldo]] sends for Walker's child as a bargaining chip but Mother refuses to give him up. Father demands she turn the child over and returns to New York to assist Waldo and Mother leaves.\n\n[[Booker T. Washington]] fails to persuade Walker to surrender, as does Father. Conklin is captured by police and forced to apologize to Coalhouse. Waldo is disgusted by Conklin's bigotry but cannot submit to terrorist demands and has him arrested. Coalhouse agrees to surrender if Waldo permits his supporters to depart in his restored car and Waldo agrees after Father volunteers to stay as a hostage. Coalhouse's supporters escape and he drives Father out of the library. Ready to blow himself up, Coalhouse instead surrenders but is shot dead on Waldo's orders. The film ends with another newsreel: Evelyn dances in vaudeville and Thaw is released from an asylum. Houdini escapes from a straitjacket several stories above the ground, while newspapers announce that the [[First World War]] has begun. Younger Brother returns to his fireworks job and Father watches from the house in New Rochelle as Mother departs with Tateh and Coalhouse's son.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ragtime-1981|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|title=Ragtime|date=January 1, 1981}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\nThe film is notable for introducing numerous actors for whom this was one of their first appearances in an American film: [[Samuel L.
