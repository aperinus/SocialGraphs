It was Chan's first traditional style martial arts film since ''[[Fearless Hyena Part II]]'' (1983). The film was released in North America as '''''The Legend of Drunken Master''''' in 2000.\n\nThe film is a sequel to Chan's 1978 film ''[[Drunken Master]]'', directed by [[Yuen Woo-ping]]. Another film, ''[[Drunken Master III]]'' (1994, directed by Lau Kar-Leung) features little in common with either this or its predecessor, and is not considered a sequel.{{by whom|date=March 2020}} In 2005, ''Drunken Master II'' was named one of the top 100 [[Time's All-Time 100 Movies|best films of all time]] by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]. In 2015, the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI) selected ''Drunken Master II'' as one of the ten best action movies of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie is set in early 20th century [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]]. [[Wong Fei-hung]], along with his father [[Wong Kei-ying]] and servant Tso, is on the way home to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] after a trip to the [[Northeast China|Northeast]] when he encounters Fu Wen-chi, a former top candidate in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] era's [[Imperial examination#Military|military examination]]. After an exchange of blows, Wong and Fu accidentally switch the boxes they had been fighting over. Wong ends up with the [[Heirloom Seal of the Realm|Imperial Seal]] while Fu gets the [[ginseng]] that Wong's father had bought for a client. Unknown to Wong, the Imperial Seal is one of numerous Chinese artifacts that the British [[Consul (representative)|consul]] is trying to smuggle out of China to Britain.\n\nBack in Canton, Wong gives the client a root from his father's favourite [[bonsai]] to pass off as the ginseng. Wong's stepmother, Ling, complicates things when she tries to help Wong by loaning her necklace for money for Wong to buy a new ginseng; their neighbours mistakenly believe that the Wongs are in financial difficulty. In the meantime, the British consul sends his henchmen to track down Wong and seize the Imperial Seal. A fight breaks out between Wong and the henchmen when the latter try to snatch a bag from Ling, thinking that it contains the Seal. At Ling's instigation, Wong gets drunk and uses [[drunken boxing]] to beat up the henchmen until his father shows up and stops him. The older Wong is furious at his son for embarrassing their family by getting drunk and fighting in public. To make matters worse, the client falls sick after consuming the fake ginseng and his wife informs Wong's father about it. After he learns the truth behind the ginseng and bonsai, the older Wong becomes so angry that he hits his son and chases him out of the house.\n\nWhen Wong tries to drown his sorrow by drinking heavily, he gets beaten up and publicly humiliated by the henchmen because he is too drunk to fight back. After his family saves him and brings him home, Wong feels deeply ashamed of his drunken behaviour and apologizes to his father, saying that he will never drink again. Meanwhile, Fu Wen-chi visits the Wong residence and tells them about the British consul's smuggling operation. The next day, Fu and Wong are attacked at a restaurant by [[the Axe Gang]], a group of thugs hired by the consul. Fu is fatally shot and the Imperial Seal is taken by the consul's men. Before dying, Fu implores Wong and his friends to retrieve the Seal and stop the consul from stealing Chinese artifacts.\n\nOne night, Wong and his friend, Tsang, disguise themselves and break into the British consulate. They are caught, assaulted and held for ransom by the consul, who demands that Wong's father sells his land in exchange for their release; the older Wong reluctantly agrees. Later, Wong's friends discover that the British consul is planning to smuggle the stolen artifacts out of Canton using boxes meant for steel shipments. They inform Wong and Tsang, who then join the workers in a violent protest at the British-owned steel factory against the consul's abuses. Out of desperation, he breaks his promise and drinks again in order to use drunken boxing technique to defeat the main bad guy. After a long fight, Wong and his friends defeat the consul's henchmen and put an end to the smuggling operation. At the end of the movie, a Chinese general presents the Wongs a commemorative plaque to honour them for their service to the country only to find that Wong has suffered brain damage due to his drinking.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jackie Chan]] as [[Wong Fei-hung]]\n* [[Anita Mui]] as Ling\n* [[Ti Lung]] as [[Wong Kei-ying]]\n* [[Felix Wong]] as Fishmonger Tsang\n* [[Lau Kar-leung]] as Fu Wen-chi\n* Ho Wing-fong as Fun\n* [[Chin Kar-lok]] as Fo-sang\n* Lau Kar-yung as Marlon\n* [[Ram Chiang]] as Tso\n* [[Ken Lo]] as John\n* [[Ho-Sung Pak]] as Henry\n* [[Andy Lau]] as [[Zhang Xueliang]] / counter-intelligence officer\n* [[Suki Kwan]] as Mrs Chiu\n* [[Yvonne Yung]] as a lady in the coffee shop\n* Vindy Chan as a lady in the coffee shop\n* Hon Yee-sang as Uncle Hing\n* Lau Siu-ming as Mr Chiu\n* Wong Shing as Larry\n* Chan Kwok-kuen as Curly\n* Tai Po as Moe\n* Sandy Chan as Lily\n* Pau Fong as cook\n* Ha Chun-chau as a senior in the restaurant\n* [[Szema Wah Lung]] as a senior in the restaurant\n* [[Yan Pak]] as Mrs Chan\n* Louis C.

The fighting styles observed in the film during the fight scenes are:\n* In the fight scene on the train, at the beginning of the film, between [[Wong Fei-hung]] ([[Jackie Chan]]) and Fu Wen-chi ([[Lau Kar-leung]]), both Wong Fei-hung and Fu Wen-chi use the [[Hung Ga]], in addition to weapons known as the spear (or [[Qiang (spear)|Qiang]]), used by Fu Wen-chi and the Tiger Sword, used by Wong Fei-hung.\n* In the fight scene at the restaurant, Wong Fei-hung and Fu Wen-chi uses both [[Hung Ga]] and [[Shaolin Kung Fu]], while the henchmen use the [[Xingyiquan]]. \n* In the fight scene in the central square of the city, Wong Fei-hung uses the [[Drunken boxing]] against the main antagonist's goons.\n* In the savage final fight scene between Wong Fei-hung and one of the main antagonists, John ([[Ken Lo]]) uses [[Taekwondo]]  against Wong Fei-hung and uses typical Taekwondo kicks to try to defeat him. Wong Fei-hung on the other hand uses one of the most popular styles of [[Drunken boxing]], the Daoist style or the Drunken [[Eight Immortals]] style to counter attack John ('''Note''': [[Ken Lo]] is a black belt in [[Taekwondo]] and has won numerous tournaments with this martial art).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.martialartsentertainment.com/ken-lo/|title=Ken Lo|date=16 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tkdkwan.com/2019/11/jackie-chan-fighting-against-his-real.html|title = Jackie Chan fighting against his real life Bodyguard Ken Lo (Taekwondo practitioner)}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\nNo DVD has been made available to date that preserves the original aspect ratio and the uncut version of the film with the original Cantonese audio track. The film's purest English-friendly version can only be found on now out-of-print releases \u2013 the [[Mei Ah Entertainment|Mei Ah]] VCD and [[LaserDisc]], Tai Seng's VHS (itself a recording of the Mei Ah LaserDisc) and the Australian VHS from Chinatown Video (a sub label of [[Siren Visual]]). These prints have \"burnt-in\" Chinese/English subtitles. An uncut release with good picture quality, the original audio track, and the original aspect ratio is considered a \"holy grail\" by many Hong Kong cinema fans.\n\nThakral's region 0 DVD release of ''Drunken Master II'' was the only official DVD which featured the uncut version with proper English subtitles. However, instead of the original Hong Kong theatrical version, it contains the Chinese print. The Chinese print is identical to the Hong Kong print except for one major difference: the scene of Fei-Hung drunkenly singing at the outdoor restaurant is re-cut and re-edited with alternative footage so that Fei-Hung is singing a different song in Mandarin instead of Cantonese.<ref name=\"Movie-Censorship\">{{cite web|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=786496|title=Drunken Master II : Comparison of Chinese DVD and Japanese blu-ray|publisher=Movie-Censorship|access-date=2020-12-28}}</ref> Thakral's aspect ratio is cropped to 1.78:1 from the original theatrical 2.35:1 aspect ratio.\n\nThe region 3 releases for Hong Kong and Korea contains the English export version with the original 2:35:1 non-anamorphic aspect ratio. This cut of the film ends almost immediately after Fei-Hung defeats John. The audio tracks include an abridged Cantonese and Mandarin soundtracks, and the original Golden Harvest English dub different than that of Dimension's. It contains the original score and sound effects, but there are no English subtitles.\n\nOf all the films in Chan's back-catalogue that received North American theatrical distribution, ''Drunken Master II'' was cut the least. A scene in which Wong drunkenly sings at a caf\u00e9 was re-cut slightly, making use of a few alternate takes not seen in the original Cantonese version. In addition, a 35&nbsp;second cut was made to the concluding scene of the film which showed Wong blinded and mentally crippled as a result of drinking [[methanol|industrial alcohol]] during the film's ultimate fight. Played for laughs, the scene was considered to be in bad taste by the American distributor, [[Dimension Films]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nIn addition to the cut, other significant changes made to the US release including the change of title (to ''Legend of Drunken Master''), an English-language dub (Chan dubbed himself), and a new musical score. The re-dubbed soundtrack also meant that sound effects were different, in some instances completely altering the rhythm of the fight scenes.<ref name=\"dm2 vs legend\">{{cite web | url = http://www.newmoanyeah.com/2002-reviews/021102_dm2_vs_legend.php | archive-url = https://archive.today/20030327011631/http://www.newmoanyeah.com/2002-reviews/021102_dm2_vs_legend.php | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2003-03-27 | title = Drunken Master 2'' vs. ''Legend of Drunken Master | last = Lin | first = Stephen | publisher = newmoanyeah }}</ref>\n\nThe English dub also makes references to animal kung fu styles such as [[Drunken Monkey]], as well as made-up names for random moves during the first two instances that Wong Fei-hung uses drunken boxing. The original dialogue referenced the [[Eight Immortals|Eight Drunken Immortals]] technique, which was also featured in Drunken Master (1978) based on the real-life [[Drunken boxing#Daoist style|Daoist style of Drunken Fist]]. The change was most likely done to compensate for the general western audience's unfamiliarity with Chinese mythology and the first film.\n\nThe Australian (region 4) and Japanese (region 2) release featured the same cuts and re-scoring as the US release.\n\nA Blu-ray version was released on 15 September 2009, in the United States, which features the cut US version in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/38449/legend-of-drunken-master-the/|title=The Legend of Drunken Master (Blu-ray) : DVD Talk Review of the Blu-ray|publisher=dvdtalk.com|access-date=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK it was released on Blu-ray 16 April 2012 under the title ''The Legend of Drunken Master''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legend of Drunken Master|website=Amazon UK |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Legend-Drunken-Master-Blu-ray/dp/B007BL6316|access-date=26 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe original, uncut Hong Kong version was finally made available on Blu-ray in China, Korea and Japan, courtesy of [[Warner Bros.

Most of the expository and character-building scenes fall into one of three categories: (1) inane, (2) incomprehensible, or (3) dull. The tone is also wildly inconsistent.
