After failing to get her dream job as a newspaper intern, she comes to the conclusion that it is because she is a girl.\n\nWith her parents out of town on a two-week Caribbean vacation, Terri decides to remedy the situation. Enrolling at a rival high school, she enlists the help of her sex-obsessed younger brother, Buddy, and her best friend Denise to disguise herself as a boy. Along the way, she meets Rick Morehouse, a nerd who becomes her pet project. After helping him through an image makeover and encouraging him to start talking to girls, Terri starts to fall for him.\n\nAfter many episodes in and out of school, including fending off a group of bullies led by bodybuilder Greg Tolan, dealing with her real college boyfriend Kevin, and being set up on a blind date with a potential new girlfriend named Sandy, Terri manages to be accepted as \"one of the guys\".\n\nAt the senior [[prom]], a jealous Greg picks a fight with Rick, who ultimately trounces the bully in front of the entire class. When Terri's boyfriend shows up unexpectedly and discovers the ruse, Rick assumes that Terri's big secret was that she was gay. To prove otherwise, Terri opens her shirt and reveals her breasts to Rick. Although she admits to loving him, Rick rejects her, prompting a desperate Terri to kiss him in front of everyone. To placate the awestruck students, Rick derisively announces that Terri \"has tits\" before leaving the prom and Terri behind.\n\nHeartbroken and humiliated, Terri retreats to her room and writes a long article on what it is like to be a girl in boys' clothing, detailing all of her experiences, both good and bad.\n\nTerri returns to her own school. When her article is printed in the newspaper, she receives high praise and finally earns her dream job at the newspaper. Nevertheless, she still finds herself yearning for Rick, who has not spoken to her since the prom. One day during the summer, Rick suddenly turns up after reading her article. Realizing their true feelings for each other, they reconcile and make plans for another date. They decide to go for a drive in Terri's car, but before Buddy can join them, an attractive blonde on a motorcycle rides up and beckons to him with a smile. Buddy then climbs onto the back of her motorcycle, and both couples happily drive away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Joyce Hyser]] as Terri/Terry Griffith\n* [[Clayton Rohner]] as Rick Morehouse\n* [[Billy Jayne|Billy Jacoby]] as Buddy Griffith\n* [[Toni Hudson]] as Denise\n* [[William Zabka]] as Greg Tolan\n* [[Leigh McCloskey]] as Kevin\n* [[Sherilyn Fenn]] as Sandy\n* [[Arye Gross]] as Willie\n* [[Deborah Goodrich]] as Deborah\n* [[Stuart Charno]] as Reptile\n* [[Kenneth Tigar]] as Mr. Raymaker\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Just One of the Guys\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1985\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings|noprose=yes\n|rev1=[[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score={{Rating|3|5}} [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r230533|pure_url=yes}}]\n}}\n\n# \"Just One of the Guys\" by [[Shalamar]] \u2013 3:55\n# \"Girls Got Something Boys Ain't Got\" by [[Midnight Star (band)|Midnight Star]] \u2013 3:56\n# \"Tonight You're Mine, Baby\" by [[Ronnie Spector]] \u2013 4:57\n# \"Prove It to You\" by [[Dwight Twilley]] \u2013 3:20\n# \"Jealous\" by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]] \u2013 4:23\n# \"Way Down\" by [[Billy Burnette]] \u2013 3:34\n# \"Burning\" by Brock/Davis \u2013 4:20\n# \"Thrills\" by Greg French \u2013 3:15\n# \"Hard Way\" by Brock/Davis \u2013 4:48\n# \"Guy Talk\" by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]] \u2013 2:29\n\nThe songs and music that were played in the film, not on the soundtrack.\n# \"[[Trouble (Lindsey Buckingham song)|Trouble]]\" by [[Lindsey Buckingham]]\n# \"Down on the Street\" by [[The Stooges]]\n# \"Turn Out Right\" by [[Private Domain (band)|Private Domain]]\n# \"Comb My Hair\" by [[Johnny Lyon]]\n# \"Buns\" by Bonedaddys\n# \"Gone Too Far\" by Neurotica\n\n==Release==\n''Just One of the Guys'' was released on April 26, 1985.\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] under [[Sony Pictures]] on April 28, 2020.
