It stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as the leader of an elite [[paramilitary]] rescue team on a mission to save hostages in [[guerrilla]]-held territory in a [[Central American]] rainforest, <!--see note below about setting location--> who encounter the deadly [[Predator (fictional species)|Predator]] ([[Kevin Peter Hall]]), a skilled, technologically advanced alien who stalks and hunts them down.\n\n''Predator'' was written in 1984 under the working title of ''Hunter''. Filming ran from March to June 1986 with creature effects devised by [[Stan Winston]]; the budget was around $15 million. [[20th Century Fox]] released the film on June 12, 1987, in the United States, and it grossed $98 million worldwide. Initial reviews were mixed, but the film has since been considered a classic of the action and science fiction genres and one of the best films of the 1980s.\n\nThe success of ''Predator'' launched [[Predator (franchise)|a media franchise of films, novels, comic books, video games, and toys]]. It spawned four sequels: ''[[Predator 2]]'' (1990), ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]'' (2010), ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]'' (2018), and ''[[Prey (2022 film)|Prey]]'' (2022). A crossover with the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] produced the  ''[[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' films, which include ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004) and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- A plot summary ranges from 400-700 words. For more information, see WP:FILMPLOT. -->\nAn alien spacecraft deploys a shuttle to Earth, where [[Vietnam War]] veteran Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sfy.ru/?script=predator|title=Predator Screen Play (from the original on January 30, 1987) |accessdate=December 10, 2021}}</ref> and his military rescue team, consisting of Mac, Poncho, Blain, Billy, and Hawkins, are tasked with rescuing a foreign cabinet minister and his aide from insurgents. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Al Dillon, a Vietnam War buddy of Dutch's, is assigned to accompany the team over Dutch's objections. En route, the team discovers the wreckage of a helicopter and three skinned corpses. Dutch identifies them as [[Green Berets]] that he knew and becomes suspicious of Dillon's intentions. The team reaches the guerilla camp and witnesses the execution of a hostage. They mount an attack, killing most of the rebels and several Soviet intelligence officers. Dutch confronts Dillon, who reveals their true mission was to stop a planned Soviet-backed invasion and that the CIA sent the Green Berets weeks earlier for the same mission. \n\nThe only surviving guerilla, Anna, is captured. Learning that more rebels are coming, the team chooses to trek to the extraction point. They are followed by an entity employing a [[cloaking device]] and thermal imaging technology, but a spooked Billy glimpses it while Anna attempts an escape. Hawkins catches her, but the creature attacks and kills him while sparing Anna. Dutch organizes a search party, but Blain is killed by the creature's [[Plasma weapon|plasma cannon]]. Enraged, Mac provokes everyone to blindly fire their weapons into the jungle, unknowingly wounding the creature. As the creature administers first-aid, the commandos regroup and realize they are being hunted. Dillon believes two or three guerrillas are responsible, but Billy is adamant that their pursuer is not human. They make camp for the night and set traps, which are triggered by a [[wild boar]]. In the confusion, Mac kills it while the creature steals Blain's body.\n\nDutch later realizes that their enemy uses the trees to travel and frees Anna, who states that her people had seen similarly mutilated bodies before. The next day, the group constructs a net trap and captures the creature, but it frees itself and Poncho is injured. Mac and Dillon pursue it but are outmaneuvered and killed. As the survivors flee, Billy stays behind to fight the creature. The creature kills Billy before following the survivors and killing Poncho. Realizing it does not attack unarmed individuals, Dutch tells the unarmed Anna to head to the extraction point. Dutch attempts to distract the creature by fleeing but is followed to a muddy riverbank and covered in mud. The creature fails to see him and leaves to collect trophies from the others. Dutch realizes the cool mud provided camouflage for his body heat. He crafts makeshift traps and weapons and lures the creature out at night with a war cry and torch. \n\nDutch lightly injures the creature and disables its cloaking device as the creature fires wildly into the forest, and tries to escape, but accidentally falls into the river, where the water dissolves his muddy camouflage. As the creature corners Dutch, it removes its mask and plasma cannon to fight him hand-to-hand, having deemed him a worthy opponent. Despite being overpowered and outsmarted, Dutch attempts to goad the creature into a booby trap. It goes around, but Dutch triggers the trap anyway, crushing the creature with the trap's counterweight. With the alien mortally wounded, he asks it, \"What the hell are you?\" The creature repeats the question to him and activates its self-destruct device, maniacally laughing as it counts down. Realizing what it has done, Dutch runs for cover and survives the explosion. He is then rescued by the extraction helicopter, with Anna already safely onboard, though he is left traumatized by the experience.\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Predator (film series) characters}}\n[[File:Predator (1987) - main cast.jpg|thumb|The main cast of ''Predator''.

Screenwriters [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]] took the inspiration from the joke and wrote a screenplay based on it. The Thomas script for ''Predator'' was originally titled ''Hunter''.<ref name=\"bleeds\">{{cite AV media |last=Haufrect |first=Ian T. |year=2001 |title=If It Bleeds, We Can Kill It |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |location=''Predator'' DVD}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite magazine |last=Shapiro |first=Marc |date=July 1987 |title=Stalking the Predator |journal=[[Starlog]] |via=archive.org |issue=120 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-120/page/n88 89]\u201391 |url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-120}}</ref> The original concept, centered on a plot of \"what it is to be hunted,\" concerned a band of alien hunters of various species seeking various targets; that concept was eventually streamlined to one extraterrestrial hunting the most dangerous species, humans, and the \"most dangerous man,\" a combat soldier. Additionally, the setting was chosen as Central America for having [[Operation Condor|constant special forces operations during that period]].<ref>{{cite AV media |type=DVD |people=Jim & John Thomas |year=2005 |title=''Predator 2'' |section=Writers Commentary track |publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] }}</ref>\n\nAs the Thomas brothers were first time screenwriters with little credibility in Hollywood, they struggled to attract attention for their proposed film, and eventually resorted to slipping the script under the door of 20th Century Fox producer Michael Levy (who would go on to serve as executive producer on the film's sequel, ''[[Predator 2]]''). Levy then brought the screenplay to producer [[Joel Silver]] who, based on his experience with ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]'', decided to turn the science-fiction pulp story line into a big-budget film. Silver enlisted his former boss [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] as co-producer and [[John McTiernan]] was hired as director for his first studio film. At one point, New Zealand director [[Geoff Murphy]] was also considered to direct.<ref>{{cite web |year=1985 |title=Roy Murphy: Geoff Murphy interview |publisher=Murphyroy.com |url=http://www.murphyroy.com/film/filmmaker.html |access-date=July 19, 2011 |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425050544/http://www.murphyroy.com/film/filmmaker.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Predator (1987) - The Predator.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kevin Peter Hall]] as the Predator]]\nSilver and Gordon first approached [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] with the lead role. Schwarzenegger said: {{block quote|The first thing I look for in a script is a good idea, a majority of scripts are rip-offs of other movies. People think they can become successful overnight. They sat down one weekend and wrote a script because they read that Stallone did that with ''Rocky''. ''Predator'' was one of the scripts I read, and it bothered me in one way. It was just me and the alien. So we re-did the whole thing so that it was a team of commandos and then I liked the idea. I thought it would make a much more effective movie and be much more believable. I liked the idea of starting out with an action-adventure, but then coming in with some horror and science fiction.}}\n\nHe had previously starred in ''Commando'', on which Silver had served as producer. To play the elite band of soldiers, both Silver and Gordon, with co-producer [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]], searched for other larger-than-life men of action. [[Carl Weathers]], who had been memorable as boxer [[Apollo Creed]] in the ''Rocky'' films, was their first choice to play Dillon while professional wrestler and former [[Navy SEAL]] [[Jesse Ventura]] was hired for his formidable physique as Blain, co-starring with Schwarzenegger the same year in ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]''. Also cast were [[Sonny Landham]], [[Richard Chaves]], and [[Bill Duke]], who costarred alongside Schwarzenegger in ''Commando''.\n\n[[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was originally cast as the Predator with the intent that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the Predator an agile, [[ninja]]-like hunter.<ref name=\"bleeds\" /> But when the 5'9\" Van Damme was compared to Schwarzenegger, Weathers, and Ventura \u2014 actors over 6 feet tall and known for their [[bodybuilding]] regimens \u2014 it became apparent a more physically imposing man was needed to make the creature appear threatening. Additionally, it was reported that Van Damme constantly complained about the monster suit being too hot and causing him to pass out. He allegedly had also repeatedly voiced reservations about only appearing on camera in the suit. Additionally, the original design for the Predator was felt to be too cumbersome and difficult to manage in the jungle and, even with a more imposing actor, did not provoke enough fear. Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by the 7'2\" [[Kevin Peter Hall]], who had just finished work as a sasquatch in ''[[Harry and the Hendersons]]''.<ref name=\"bleeds\" />\n\n===Filming===\nCommitments by Schwarzenegger delayed the start of filming by several months. The delay gave Silver enough time to secure a minor rewrite from screenwriter [[David Peoples]]. [[Principal photography]] eventually began in the jungles of [[Palenque|Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico]], during the last week of March 1986, but {{citation needed span|most|reason=End credits say \"This film was shot entirely in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco and Palenque, Chiapas Mexico\".|date=March 2020}} of the film was shot in [[Mismaloya]], Mexico. Much of the material dealing with the unit's deployment in the jungle was completed in a few short weeks and both Silver and Gordon were pleased by the [[dailies]] provided by McTiernan. On Friday, April 25, production halted so that Schwarzenegger could get to his wedding on time, flying to [[Hyannis Port]] in a [[Learjet]] chartered by Silver. Schwarzenegger was married on April 26, 1986, to [[Maria Shriver]], and [[honeymoon]]ed for only three days while the second unit completed additional filming. The production resumed filming on May 12 and ended in late June 1986.\n\nBoth McTiernan and Schwarzenegger lost 25 pounds during the film.<ref name=\"bleeds\" /> Schwarzenegger's weight loss was a professional choice while McTiernan lost the weight because he avoided the food in Mexico due to health concerns.<ref name=\"bleeds\" /> Unlike McTiernan, most of the cast and crew suffered from [[Montezuma's Revenge]] since the Mexican hotel in which they were living had problems with its water purification.<ref>{{cite video |date=2001 |title=''Predator'' Special Edition |chapter=Don't Drink The Water |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video |volume=Disk 2}}</ref> In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3:00&nbsp;a.m. to work out before the day's shooting. Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him and would work out only after the other actors were nowhere to be seen.<ref name=\"bleeds\" />\n\nAccording to Schwarzenegger, filming was physically demanding. The actor\u2014and former bodybuilder\u2014shipped gym equipment to Mexico and trained intensively every day before shooting began, usually with his co-stars.<ref name=\"gent\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gentside.co.uk/fitness/this-is-how-arnold-schwarzenegger-kept-up-his-workout-routine-on-the-set-of-predator_art3906.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200614100933/https://www.gentside.co.uk/fitness/this-is-how-arnold-schwarzenegger-kept-up-his-workout-routine-on-the-set-of-predator_art3906.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 14, 2020|title=How Arnold Schwarzenegger Maintained His Famous Physique On The Set Of Predator|work=Gentside|date=October 31, 2019|access-date=June 14, 2020}}</ref> Screenwriter Jim Thomas was impressed with the training regimen and said: \"I think that phrase 'manly men' was coined [during the production of ''Predator'']\".<ref name=\"gent\"/> Among other tasks, Schwarzenegger had to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien.<ref name=\"gire\">{{cite news |last=Gire |first=Dan |date=December 1987 |title=Schwarzenegger on ''Predator'' |publisher=[[Cinefantastique]]}}</ref> In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required [[heat lamp]]s to be on all of the time. Cast and crew filmed on rough terrain that, according to the actor, was never flat, \"always on a hill. We stood all day long on a hill, one leg down, one leg up. It was terrible.\"<ref name=\"gire\" /> Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with [[Kevin Peter Hall]], who could not see in the Predator suit. The actor recalled that \"when he's supposed to slap me around and stay far from my face, all of a sudden, ''whap!'' There is this hand with claws on it!\"<ref name=\"gire\" /> Hall stated in an interview that his experience on the film \"wasn't a movie, it was a survival story for all of us.\"<ref name=\"gire2\">{{cite news |last=Gire |first=Dan |date=December 1987 |title=''Predator'': The Man in the Suit |publisher=[[Cinefantastique]]}}</ref> For example, in the scene where the Predator chases Dutch, the water was foul, stagnant and full of leeches.<ref name=\"gire2\" /> Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and memorize where everything was.

The red was removed with [[chroma key]] techniques, leaving an empty area. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, the jungle from the second take filled in the empty area. Because the second take was filmed with a wider lens, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape.<ref name=\"robley\" />\n\nFor thermal vision, infrared film could not be used because it did not register in the range of body temperature wavelengths. The filmmakers used an [[FLIR Systems|Inframetrics]] thermal video scanner because it gave good heat images of objects and people.<ref name=\"robley\" /> The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from [[glow stick]]s mixed with personal lubricant for texture.<ref name=\"robley\" /> The electrical sparks were rotoscoped animation using white paper pins registered on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were composited by the optical crew for the finished effects.<ref name=\"robley\" /> Additional visual effects, mainly for the opening title sequence of the Predator arriving on Earth, were supplied by [[Dream Quest Images]] (later Oscar-winners for their work on ''[[The Abyss]]'' and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]''). The film was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]].<ref>{{cite web |title=''Predator'': Award Wins and Nominations |website=[[IMDb]].com |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/awards |access-date=July 18, 2010 |archive-date=August 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806112118/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/awards |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Predator (soundtrack)}}\nThe score was composed by [[Alan Silvestri]], who was coming off the huge success of ''[[Back to the Future]]'' in 1985. ''Predator'' was his first major action movie and the score is full of his familiar genre characteristics: heavy horn blasts, staccato string rhythms, and undulating timpani rolls that highlight the action and suspense. [[Little Richard]]'s song \"[[Long Tall Sally]]\" is featured in the helicopter en route to the jungle. Mac also recites a few lines from the song as he's chasing the Predator after it escapes from their [[booby trap]]. Silvestri returned for [[Predator 2|the sequel]], making him the only composer to have scored more than one film in either the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' or ''Predator'' series.\n\nIn 2003, [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released the soundtrack album as part of its limited release [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande#The CD Club Returns|CD Club]] collection; the album also includes the [[Elliot Goldenthal]] arrangement of the 20th Century Fox fanfare used on ''[[Alien 3]]''.\n\nIn 2007, [[Brian Tyler]] adapted and composed some of Silvestri's themes used in the score of the film ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]''.\n\nIn 2010, the same year ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]'' featured an adaptation of Silvestri's score by [[John Debney]], [[Intrada Records]] released the album in a 3000-copy limited edition with remastered sound, many cues combined and renamed, and most notably (as with Intrada's release of [[Basil Poledouris]]'s score for ''[[RoboCop]]'') presenting the original end credits music as recorded (the film versions are mixed differently).
