Some scenes in the film appear as dream sequences, often employing [[magical realism]]. The music of [[Luis Mariano]] (\"Mexico,\" and \"Maman, Tu Es La Plus Belle Du Monde\") is used in these scenes, with actor [[Laszlo Harmati]] playing Mariano, who died in 1970. The original music score is from [[Pierre Van Dormael]], Jaco's brother.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Pascal Duquenne Daniel Auteuil Cannes.jpg|thumbnail|[[Pascal Duquenne]] and [[Daniel Auteuil]] at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival premiere.]]\n* [[Daniel Auteuil]] as Harry\n* [[Pascal Duquenne]] as Georges\n* [[Miou-Miou]] as Julie\n* [[Henri Garcin]] as The director of the bank\n* [[Isabelle Sadoyan]] as Georges' Mother\n* [[Michele Maes]] as Nathalie\n* [[Fabienne Loriaux]] as Fabienne\n* [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Roussel]] as Julie's mother\n* [[Alice van Dormael]] as Alice\n* [[Juliette Van Dormael]] as Juliette\n* [[Didier De Neck]] as Fabienne's husband\n* [[Marie-Pierre Meinzel]]\n* [[Sabrina Leurquin]] as Waitress in fast food restaurant\n* [[Laszlo Harmati]] as [[Luis Mariano]]\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed $24.3 million in France and $37.1 million worldwide.<ref name=grosses/>\n==Awards==\nThis film was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] award, the top prize at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]].
