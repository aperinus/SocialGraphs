It is the [[sequel]] to [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] 1994 animated [[Film|feature film]], ''[[The Lion King]]'', with its plot influenced by [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and the second installment in [[The Lion King (franchise)|''The Lion King'' trilogy]]. According to director Darrell Rooney, the final draft gradually became a variation of ''Romeo and Juliet''.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite news |last=King |first=Susan |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-oct-26-ca-36222-story.html |title='LION KING' \u2013 Roaring Only in Stores |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 26, 1998  |access-date=August 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809071543/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-oct-26-ca-36222-story.html |archive-date=August 9, 2020 |url-status=live |url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\nProduced by [[DisneyToon Studios|Walt Disney Video Premiere]] and animated by [[Disneytoon Studios|Walt Disney Animation Australia]] and released on October 27, 1998, the film centers on Simba and Nala's daughter Kiara, who falls in love with Kovu, a male rogue lion from a banished pride that was once loyal to Simba's evil uncle, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]]. Separated by Simba's prejudice against the banished pride and a vindictive plot planned by Kovu's mother Zira, Kiara and Kovu struggle to unite their estranged prides and be together.\n\nMost of the original cast returned to their roles from the first film with a few exceptions. [[Rowan Atkinson]], who voiced Zazu in the first film, was replaced by [[Edward Hibbert]] for both this film and ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]'' (2004). [[Jeremy Irons]], who voiced Scar in the first film, was replaced by [[Jim Cummings]], who briefly provided his singing voice in the first film. Despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, the film experienced a positive reassessment in later years, with many critics deeming it as one of Disney's better direct-to-video sequels.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words only! As of 2020, the word count is 663 words. -->\n\nIn the Pride Lands of Africa, King Simba and Queen Nala's daughter, Kiara, becomes annoyed with her father's overprotective parenting. Simba assigns his childhood friends meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa to follow her. After entering the forbidden \"Outlands\", Kiara meets a young cub, Kovu, and they are attacked by crocodiles. They escape using teamwork and Kiara even saves Kovu at one point. When Kovu retaliates to Kiara's playing, Simba confronts the young cub just as he is confronted by Zira, Kovu's mother and the Outsiders' leader. Zira reminds Simba of how he exiled her and the other Outsiders, and she says Kovu was to succeed Simba's deceased uncle and nemesis Scar.\n\nAfter returning to the Pride Lands, Nala and the rest of the pride head back to Pride Rock while Simba lectures Kiara about the danger posed by the Outsiders. He then tells her that they are a part of each other. In the Outlands, Zira reminds Kovu that Simba killed Scar and exiled everyone who respected him. Kovu explains he does not think it is bad to befriend Kiara, and Zira realizes she can use Kovu's friendship with Kiara to exact revenge on Simba.\n\nSeveral years later, Kiara, now a young adult, begins her first solo hunt. Simba has Timon and Pumbaa follow her in secret, causing her to hunt away from the Pride Lands. As part of Zira's plan, Kovu's siblings Nuka and Vitani trap Kiara in a fire, allowing Kovu to rescue her. Simba is forced to accept Kovu's place since he rescued Kiara. Later that night, Simba has a nightmare about attempting to save his father, Mufasa, from falling into the wildebeest stampede but is stopped by Scar who then morphs into Kovu and sends Simba to his death.\n\nKovu contemplates attacking Simba, but he is interrupted by Kiara and starts spending more time with her. Kovu becomes conflicted between his mission and his feelings for Kiara until Rafiki, a mandrill who serves as shaman and advisor, leads them to the jungle, where he introduces them to \"upendi\" (an erroneous form of [[wikt:upendo|''upendo'']], which means \"love\" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]), helping the two lions fall in love. That night, Simba allows Kovu to sleep inside Pride Rock with the rest of the pride at Nala's persuasion. Upon learning of Kovu's failure to kill Simba, Zira sets a trap for them.\n\nThe next day, Kovu once again attempts to explain his mission to Kiara, but Simba takes him around the Pride Lands and tells him Scar's story. The Outsiders attack Simba, resulting in Nuka's death and Simba's escape. In the aftermath, Zira scratches Kovu, causing him to turn on her. Returning to Pride Rock, Kovu pleads Simba for forgiveness but is exiled. Kiara makes Simba realize he is acting irrationally, and flees to find Kovu. The two lions later find each other and profess their love. Realizing that they must reunite the two prides, Kiara and Kovu return to the Pride Lands and convince them to stop fighting. Zira, however, attempts to kill Simba, but Kiara intervenes and Zira falls to her death. \n\nWith his enemy gone, Simba apologizes to Kovu for his mistake, and the Outsiders are welcomed back into the Pride Lands.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Lion King (franchise) characters}}\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as [[Simba]], son of Mufasa and Sarabi, King of the Pride Lands, Nala's mate, and Kiara's father.
