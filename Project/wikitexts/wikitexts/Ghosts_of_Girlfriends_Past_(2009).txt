The three ghosts share similar appearances with the original descriptions, and the film shares the traditional plot points from the book.\n\n==Plot==\nConnor Mead is a famous [[photographer]] and womanizer. He attends the wedding of his brother Paul to Sandra, where he becomes reacquainted with Jenny Perotti, the only girl who captured his heart. After delivering a drunken speech at the rehearsal dinner, Connor sees the ghost of his [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]] uncle Wayne. Wayne tells him not to be like him in life and says that he will be visited by three ghosts who will lead him through his romantic past, present, and future.\n\nThe first is the \"Ghost of Girlfriends Past\" in the form of Allison, his first lover. They revisit scenes from his past, focusing on his relationship with Jenny. Connor and she were very close at school; she gave him his first [[instant camera]] which he used to take her picture, promising to keep it forever. By middle school, they were on the verge of romance, but Connor's hesitation at a dance caused Jenny to dance with and kiss another boy.\n\nWayne told Connor that he must avoid romance at all costs in order not to feel such pain again. When he next saw Jenny, he ignored her and chose Allison. Several years later, Connor and Jenny meet again and rekindle their romance. She tries to stop his womanizing. He falls in love but panics, running away to avoid being hurt. Jenny wakes up broken-hearted.\n\nBack in the present, Connor accidentally destroys the wedding cake and fails to reconcile with Jenny. He is confronted by the \"Ghost of Girlfriends Present\" in the form of his assistant Melanie. He sees that the others make fun of his shallow lifestyle. Paul expresses hope that he will someday improve. Connor is upset that Jenny is being comforted by Brad. Melanie and his former lovers discuss his lack of empathy.\n\nConnor accidentally tells Sandra that Paul slept with one of her bridesmaids early in their relationship, and she is furious with Paul. Connor attempts to mend the situation, but Paul tells him to leave. Confronted by the \"Ghost of Girlfriends Future\", who takes him forward in time to see that Jenny marries Brad while Paul remains alone. Further in the future, Paul is the only mourner at Connor's funeral. Wayne appears and tells Connor that this is his future if he continues on the same path, pushing him into the grave to be buried by his many ex-girlfriends.\n\nWaking up the next day, Connor finds out that Sandra has cancelled the wedding. Connor took the car in order to find her, convincing her to forgive Paul, saying that the pain of heartbreak is outweighed by the regret of never risking one's heart in the first place. Connor photographs the wedding, and he reconciles with Jenny by showing her the picture he still carries of her. They kiss and dance in the snow to the same song Connor once hesitated to ask her to dance to.\n\nWayne strikes out with the Ghost of Girlfriends Future. Wayne tries to hit on Melanie but she dances with Brad. Wayne is finally rejected by Allison, the Ghost of Girlfriends Past, who still appears 16.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Connor 'Dutch' Mead, a ladies man, is based on [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].\n** Devin Brochu as Little Connor\n** [[Logan Miller]] as Young Connor\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Jenny Perotti is based on Ebenezer Scrooge's ex-fianc\u00e9e Belle.\n** Kasey Russell as Little Jenny \n** [[Christa B.
