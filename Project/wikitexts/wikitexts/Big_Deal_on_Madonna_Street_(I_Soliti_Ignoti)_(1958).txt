Its original Italian title literally translates as \"the usual unknown ones\", which is roughly equivalent to the English phrase \"the usual suspects\". The name of the Roman street in the English title is a slight mistranslation, as the Italian name of the fictional Roman street on which the midnight burglary in the film takes place is the ''Via delle Madonne'' (The Street of the Madonnas) rather than \"Madonna Street\". Compounding the confusion is the fact that the real Roman street on which the scene was filmed is the ''Via delle tre cannelle'' (The Street of the Three Spouts), rather than the ''Via delle tre Madonne'' (The Street of the Three Madonnas).\n\nThe film is a comedy about a group of small-time thieves and ne'er-do-wells who bungle an attempt to burgle a [[pawn shop]] in [[Rome]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9801E3DA1431EF3ABC4B51DFB767838B679EDE Crowther, Bosley. \"The Screen: Italian Parody of 'Rififi':'Big Deal on Madonna Street' in Premiere Toto Among Bungling Burglars at the Paris\" (''The New York Times'', November 23, 1960)]</ref> The five hapless would-be burglars are played by [[Vittorio Gassman]], [[Renato Salvatori]], [[Carlo Pisacane (actor)|Carlo Pisacane]], [[Tiberio Murgia]] and [[Marcello Mastroianni]]. The careers of both Gassman and Mastroianni were considerably helped by the success of the film{{--}}Gassman in particular, since before this point he was not deemed suitable for comedic roles. [[Claudia Cardinale]] is featured in a minor role (a chaste, black-clad [[Sicily|Sicilian]] girl, almost held prisoner at home by her overbearing brother, played by Murgia); she would later rise to fame for other work. In addition to its cast and plot, the film is also notable for its breezy jazz score by composer [[Piero Umiliani]], who helped develop the style of the jazz soundtracks now considered characteristic of European films in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe producers were initially skeptical about the film's success, so the appearance of the famous comedian [[Tot\u00f2]] was highlighted on the original poster to boost audience interest, even though his character, used for comic relief,  chooses to remain a consultant to the heist gang, rather than joining it outright.\n\nThe film is distributed in [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] by [[The Criterion Collection]] and for the Italian market in [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/652-big-deal-on-madonna-street|title=Big Deal on Madonna Street|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA hapless small-time Roman crook, Cosimo ([[Memmo Carotenuto]]), is arrested for a bungled car theft and sentenced to a few months in prison. He harangues his girlfriend and lawyer to get him released so he can carry out a heist idea stolen from another inmate, a dishonest bricklayer who purposely constructed a flimsy wall between a pawn shop safe and an adjacent vacant apartment. Ultimately, his gang bribes an acquaintance with a clean criminal record, a boxer named Peppe ([[Vittorio Gassman]]) to confess. The warden does not believe Peppe, however, and he ends up in jail alongside Cosimo. Peppe tells Cosimo that he has been sentenced to three long years for this minor offense and Cosimo, to justify his actions, explains the details of the pawn shop heist to Peppe. Peppe then gleefully reveals that he has been given a year's probation and walks out the prison gate, infuriating Cosimo.\n\nPeppe takes up the heist plan with Cosimo's gang: Mario ([[Renato Salvatori]]), petty thief and the youngest member of the group; Michele ([[Tiberio Murgia]]), posturing Sicilian crook who needs money for his sheltered sister's dowry; Tiberio ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]), down and out photographer caring for his baby with his wife in jail on a minor offense; and Capannelle ([[Carlo Pisacane (actor)|Carlo Pisacane]]), elderly pickpocket. Tiberio steals a movie camera from a flea market to film the pawn shop safe's combination with a telephoto lens, but without success. Since none involved have the skill to crack the safe, they enlist the help of genteel local safecracker Dante ([[Tot\u00f2]]), who is cautious not to violate his parole but supplies tools and gives them a brief primer.\n\nThey soon discover the vacant apartment is occupied by two spinsters and their young, attractive maid, Nicoletta ([[Carla Gravina]]). Ladies' man Peppe learns from Nicoletta that the two older women leave the apartment overnight once a week. Peppe earns the offer of a tryst with the maid the next time the ladies leave. The rest of the group pressures him to accept so they can stage the burglary, but Nicoletta unexpectedly quits her job in a huff and does not know if the spinsters will make their weekly departure. Meanwhile, Cosimo is released from prison. He had insisted on a substantial portion of the loot as the plan's mastermind but was rebuffed. Now, he vows vengeance on the group by robbing the pawn shop with a gun, which the blas\u00e9 pawnbroker assumes he wants to hock. Deflated, Cosimo leaves, but during a botched purse snatching he is killed by a streetcar.\n\nMario has fallen for Michele's sister, Carmelina ([[Claudia Cardinale]]), and quits the caper in fear of being caught and embarrassing his mother. He vows to pursue a straight life and court Carmelina. Tiberio deposits his baby with his wife in prison to participate in the robbery, but runs into the flea market proprietor, who breaks his arm for stealing the camera. The group's fortunes brighten, however, when the elderly occupants of the apartment make their weekly trip after all. Re-energized, the gang break into the apartment. After a couple of misfortunes, they succeed in breaking through a wall that leads to the apartment's own kitchen; the elderly women had rearranged the furniture, thus disorienting the gang.\n\nRealizing they have little time left until morning, they resignedly gather round the apartment's kitchen table and raid the refrigerator. Their repast ends abruptly when ever-starved Capannelle blows up the stove while lighting one of its burners.  Thwarted, they all straggle homeward, members peeling off one by one for streetcars until only Peppe and Capanelle are left. Peppe then surprises Capanelle by deciding to find legitimate work.  The film ends with a newspaper article recounting a robbery by unknown persons who apparently broke into an apartment to steal pasta with chickpeas.\n\n==Cast==\n(character names are not indicated in on-screen cast credits)\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n{|class=wikitable\n!Actor!!Role\n|-\n|[[Vittorio Gassman]] ||Peppe il pantera\n|-\n|[[Renato Salvatori]]||Mario Angeletti\n|-\n|[[Memmo Carotenuto]] ||Cosimo\n|-\n|[[Rossana Rory]]||Norma\n|-\n|[[Carla Gravina]]||Nicoletta\n|-\n|[[Claudia Cardinale]]||Carmelina\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|[[Carlo Pisacane (actor)|Carlo Pisacane]]||Capannelle\n|-\n|[[Tiberio Murgia]]||Michele (known as \"Ferribotte\")\n|-\n|Gina Rovere||Teresa, Tiberio's wife\n|-\n|Gina Amendola||Mario's \"Madre\"\n|-\n|Elvira Tonelli||Assunta\n|-\n|[[Elena Fabrizi]]||Signora Ada\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|Pasquale Misiano||Massimo\n|-\n|[[Renato Terra]]||Eladio\n|-\n|Aldo Trifiletti||Fernando, the night porter\n|-\n|[[Nino Marchetti]]||Luigi\n|-\n|Mario De Simone||Receiver of stolen goods\n|-\n|[[Marcello Mastroianni]]||Tiberio\n|-\n|[[Tot\u00f2]]||Dante Cruciani\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:I soliti ignoti filming site.jpg|thumb|The building depicted in the film, photographed in 2019]]\nAccording to director Mario Monicelli, while the film was intended as a parody of neorealism, \"by then neorealism was already a thing of the past, something that was surpassed. It was more a parody that was aligned with a certain realism around us, with the poverty, and with people who had to do the best they could with whatever means possible to survive, with petty crimes.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\">{{cite journal |last1=Totaro |first1=Donato |title=Interview with Mario Monicelli |journal=Offscreen |date=September 1999 |volume=3 |issue=5 |url=https://offscreen.com/view/mario_monicelli |access-date=1 January 2019 |language=en |issn=1712-9559}}</ref>\n\nAsked if it was also a parody of [[Jules Dassin]]'s film ''[[Rififi]]'', Monicelli said, \"Yes because we saw this as a film shot in a very harsh, realist style. Very scientific, as the Peppe character continually says. So we wanted to do the same thing, but the characters didn't have the means. The way they worked was quite the contrary actually.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nMonicelli and cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo agreed on a photographic tone that was not comedic or brightly lit. \"On the contrary,\" Monicelli said, \"harsh and dramatic, because the film has a dramatic side in that it is about poor people. But Di Venanzo understood the tone. To make people laugh with a story that was dramatic rather than comic. But seen with a comic eye.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nThe film was shot in ten weeks on locations throughout Rome. Monicelli said, \"The only interior that was shot in a studio was the wall that gets broken into at the end, because I couldn\u2019t break a wall in an actual apartment! But all the other interiors were shot on location. Which of course was a particular trait of Italian cinema, to shoot on location.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nAccording to Monicelli, the film adhered to the script, without improvisations.\n\nDialogue, as was customary in Italian cinema, was all post-dubbed. Monicelli explained, \"First of all because in Italy we often shoot with actors who are not professional.\" (Carlo Pisacane and Tiberio Murgia were not actors.) \"So because they didn\u2019t know how to recite their lines they had to be dubbed.\" Furthermore, some cast members spoke in the wrong dialect. Monicelli continued, \"So, for example, [Murgia] who plays the Sicilian was not Sicilian. So I had to have a Sicilian dub his voice. Another one of the actors who was supposed to be Bolognesian (from Bologna) was from Naples, so I had to dub his voice. Cardinale spoke French so I had to dub her voice into Sicilian.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nThe apartment and pawnshop on \"Via della Madonna\" was in reality located at 7\u20138, Via delle Tre Cannelle ({{Coord|41.896613|12.486|display=inline}}), immediately north of [[Trajan's Market]]. The building is still standing as of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://igshid.com/tag/ViadelleTreCannelle|title=#ViadelleTreCannelle Instagram posts (photos and videos) - igshid.com|website=igshid.com}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe film was a hit in Italy when it was released and won two Italian [[Nastro d'Argento]] awards: [[Nastro d'Argento for Best Actor|Best Leading Actor]] (Gassman) and [[Nastro d'Argento for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]]. It also garnered the prestigious [[Silver Shell for Best Director]] at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival]] in Spain.

They chose subtitles,<ref>New York Times. 13 Nov 1960: X9.</ref> though the dubbed version did make it to American TV in the early 1960s.\n\nSeveral critics decried the subtitles. ''New York Times'' critic [[Bosley Crowther]] called it \"an essentially funny picture, artfully and joyously played. It's just too bad those incongruous, flat subtitles have to get in the way.\u201d <ref>New York Times. 23 Nov 1960: 20.</ref> ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' critic James Rich liked the film, though he noted \u201cthe humor [is] tarnished only when the parade of subtitles makes viewing a sort of exercise in speed reading.\u201d <ref>Chicago Daily Tribune;  Sep 8, 1961; pg. B15</ref> Philip K. Scheuer, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', called it \u201ccleverly directed and acted...but there is one disadvantage for the linguistically limited: they have to wait to read the joke at the bottom of the screen, and by the time they can appreciate its purport the actors have already gone on to the next one.\u201d<ref>Los Angeles Times. 22 Sep 1961: A11.</ref>\n\nOther critics simply praised the film. The critic for the ''[[New York Herald-Tribune]]'' called it \u201cone of the most irresistible Italian comedies in years. No one with a sense of humor and an appreciation of humanity should miss it.\u201d <ref>Beckley, Paul V. New York Herald Tribune. 23 Nov 1960: 13.</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: \u201cMost unusual, however, and ever so clever, are the ways the script progresses to its climactic goof-up.\u201d<ref>The Washington Post. 8 June 1961: D8.</ref> ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' said: \u201cDirector Mario Monicelli has endowed the film with such flashes of brilliance, and the cast...has enacted it with such tasteful understatement, that \u2018The Big Deal on Madonna Street\u2019 must be listed as one of the funniest comedies of the last ten years.\u201d<ref>The Sun. 29 July 1961</ref>\n\nCrowther, in a follow-up essay, wrote: \u201cAlthough the routines have whiskers, so old and used in vaudeville are they, the picture has an ageless zest for laughter.\u201d<ref>Italian Comeback: Two Dandy Films Give Promise of Renascence.New York Times. 4 Dec 1960: X1.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 89% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 7.47/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_deal_on_madonna_street |title=Big Deal on Madonna Street (I Soliti Ignoti) (1960) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nA sequel directed by [[Nanni Loy]] titled ''[[Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti]]'' (also known as ''Fiasco in Milan'' or ''Hold-up \u00e0 la Milanaise'') followed in 1960, reuniting the entire main cast, aside from Tot\u00f2 and Mastroianni.\n\nAnother sequel was released in 1985, directed by Amanzio Todini and titled ''[[I Soliti ignoti vent'anni dopo]]'' (known in English-speaking countries as ''Big Deal After 20 Years''; it was released by [[Koch Lorber]] on DVD in the United States as ''Big Deal on Madonna Street - 20 Years Later'').\n\n==Remakes==\nTwo remakes of the film were shot in the United States: the 1984 film ''[[Crackers (1984 film)|Crackers]]'' by [[Louis Malle]] (set in San Francisco) and the 2002 film ''[[Welcome to Collinwood]]'' by [[Anthony Russo (director)|Anthony Russo]] and [[Joe Russo (director)|Joe Russo]] (set in Cleveland).\n\n[[Bob Fosse]] created a Broadway musical titled ''[[Big Deal (musical)|Big Deal]]'' based on the film. Set in 1930s Chicago with an African-American cast and using popular songs of the era, the show opened at the Broadway Theatre on April 10, 1986, and closed on June 8, 1986, after 69 performances. It received five Tony Award nominations, with Fosse winning for his choreography.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 31st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0052216}}\n* {{Amg title|5408}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|big_deal_on_madonna_street}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|68650}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/142-big-deal-on-madonna-street ''Big Deal on Madonna Street''] an essay by Bruce Eder at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Mario Monicelli}}\n\n[[Category:1958 films]]\n[[Category:1950s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:1950s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian heist films]]\n[[Category:Italian black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Commedia all'italiana]]\n[[Category:Italian crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mario Monicelli]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Piero Umiliani]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Suso Cecchi d'Amico]]\n[[Category:Lux Film films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rome]]\n[[Category:1950s heist films]]\n[[Category:1958 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1950s Italian films]]"}]}}}}
