Casanova is frustrated that the man finds no interest in his research into [[alchemy]] and his further scheming. As he rows back to the mainland, Casanova is arrested, judged and imprisoned by the High Court over his famed debauchery.\n\nDuring his time in prison, Casanova reminisces of his affairs with a dressmaker and later on with one of her junior employees, Anna Maria, who suffers from frequent fainting and requires constant [[bloodletting]]. Casanova escapes the prison through the roof and exiles himself from Venice, being taken into the [[Paris]] court of Madame d'Urf\u00e9. The Madame, an aged woman, enthralled by Casanova's apparent knowledge of alchemy, wishes to transform her soul into a man's through ritualistic intercourse with him. Fortuitously, Casanova encounters his brother, whose girlfriend he entices away.\n\nCasanova then moves to the court of a hunchback, Du Bois, in between taking charge of a beautiful girl, Henriette. The lovers vow fidelity to each other, but the following morning Henriette has disappeared. Du Bois informs Casanova that an emissary of a faraway court has reclaimed Henriette, and she has requested that Casanova not attempt to follow her.\n\nWhile in [[London]], Casanova is robbed by two women and he attempts [[suicide]] by drowning himself in the [[Thames]]. A vision of a [[giantess]] and two [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] distracts him; he follows them to a [[frost fair]], where he arm-wrestles the giantess\u2014a princess\u2014and later pays to watch her bathe with the dwarves.\n\nCasanova attends a deranged party at Lord Talou's palace in [[Rome]], where he wins a bet over how many orgasms he can have in one hour. In [[Switzerland]] he falls in love with an alchemist's daughter, Isabella, who fails to keep an appointment to go to [[Dresden]] with him; Casanova instead partakes in an orgy within the hostel he's been stranded in. In Dresden, he has a brief chance encounter with his estranged mother in a theater. He then moves to a court in [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], where his desire to be taken seriously as a writer/inventor is frustrated by the court's orgiastic, wild nature. It is here that he meets Rosalba, a mechanical doll with whom he shares a dance and later on has sex with.\n\nTime goes by and an old Casanova finds himself librarian to Count Waldstein at his castle in Dux. Life at the castle is more than frustrating for Casanova, as he becomes an object of mockery and animosity. The final scene has a weary, bloodshot Casanova cringing in an armchair and recounting a recent dream. In this dream, Casanova is back in Venice. He chases the ghosts of his past lovers, all of whom disappear. An ornate stagecoach beckons him to join its passengers. He finally meets with Rosalba, the mechanical doll, once again and they dance with each other.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as [[Giacomo Casanova]]\n* [[Tina Aumont]] as Henriette\n* Cicely Browne as [[Jeanne Camus de Pontcarr\u00e9|Madame d'Urf\u00e9]]\n* [[Carmen Scarpitta]] as Madame Charpillon \n* Clara Algranti as Marcolina\n* Daniela Gatti as Giselda\n* Margareth Clementi as Sister Maddalena\n* Mario Cencelli as Dr. Mobius \n* Silvana Fusacchia as Isabella\n* [[Olimpia Carlisi]] as Isabella's sister\n* Leda Lojodice as Rosalba, the mechanical doll \n* [[Sandy Allen|Sandra Elaine Allen]] as Angelina the Giantess \n* Clarissa Mary Roll as Anna Maria\n* [[Daniel Emilfork]] as the Marquis Du Bois\n* [[Dudley Sutton]] as the [[Charles Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n* [[John Karlsen]] as Lord Talou\n* [[Reggie Nalder]] as Faulkircher\n* [[Harold Innocent]] as [[Count of St. Germain]]\n* [[Marika Rivera]] as Astrodi \n* [[Alessandra Belloni]] as Princess\n* [[Diane Kurys]] as Madame Charpillon's daughter\n* [[Dan van Husen]] as Viderol\n* [[Mary Marquet]] as [[Zanetta Farussi]], Casanova\u2019s mother\n* [[Nicholas Smith (actor)|Nicholas Smith]] as [[Francesco Giuseppe Casanova]], Casanova\u2019s brother\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Fellini\u2019s Casanova'' is noted for its symbolic, highly stylised ''[[mise en sc\u00e8ne]]'' and the casting of [[Donald Sutherland]] in the lead role.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-05-15 |title=Philip French's Classic DVD |url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/16/fellini-casanova-french-classic-dvd |access-date=2021-02-06 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> Fellini's dislike of the character was well documented, and in one interview he even referred to exposing \"the void\" of Casanova's life.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Essays in Criticism: Federico Fellini |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1978 |isbn=0-19-502273-4 |editor-last=Bondanella |editor-first=Peter |location=Oxford |page=[https://archive.org/details/federicofellinie00bond/page/29 29] |chapter=Casanova: An Interview with Aldo Tassone |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/federicofellinie00bond/page/29}}</ref> Producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] suggested [[Robert Redford]] in the role of Casanova but Fellini refused to cast him.<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=Hollis Alpert |last=Alpert |first=Hollis |year=1988 |title=Fellini: A Life |location=New York |publisher=Paragon House |isbn=1-55778-000-5 |page=245 }}</ref> [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]], [[Alberto Sordi]] and [[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] were also considered for the role.<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=Tullio Kezich |last=Kezich |first=Tullio |title=Federico Fellini - Il libro dei film |location=Milan |publisher=Rizzoli |year=2009 |isbn=978-8-817-03282-7 |page=233 }}</ref>  When De Laurentiis bowed out of the project and Fellini signed a new contract with producer [[Alberto Grimaldi]], [[Donald Sutherland]] was cast in the role.
