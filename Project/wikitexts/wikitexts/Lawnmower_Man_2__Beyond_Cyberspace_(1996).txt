It is a [[sequel]] to the 1992 film ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]''. The film was negatively reviewed by both [[Film criticism|critics]] and fans of the original film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lawnmower Man 2 - Jobe's War (Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lawnmower_man_2_jobes_war/|language=en|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=June 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe founder of [[virtual reality]], Dr. Benjamin Trace, has lost a legal battle to secure a [[patent]] on the most powerful worldwide communications chip ever invented. Touted as the one [[operating system]] to control all others, in the wrong hands the \"[[Chiron]] Chip\" has the potential to dominate a society dependent on computers. When corporate [[tycoon]] and virtual reality entrepreneur Jonathan Walker takes over development of the Chiron Chip, he and his team discover Jobe Smith barely alive after the [[The Lawnmower Man (film)|destruction of Virtual Space Industries]]. After having his face reconstructed and his legs amputated, they hook him up to their database to have him help them perfect the Chiron Chip.\n\nSix years later, a now 16-year-old Peter Parkette is a [[Hacker|computer hacker]] living in the subways of a cyberpunk [[Los Angeles]] with a group of other runaway teens. While hooked into Cyberspace, Jobe reconnects with Peter and asks him to find Trace for him. Peter locates Trace living in a desert and brings him to his hideout to speak with Jobe. Jobe shows Trace his newly constructed cyber world and asks about the Egypt link, a hidden Nano routine in the chip's design. Trace refuses to tell him, noting that Jobe is insane and would not understand its power. Enraged, Jobe hacks into the subway system's  computer to send another train crashing into the one Trace and the teenagers are in, but Trace causes the runaway train to crash into a construction site instead.\n\nWalker and his team at \"Virtual Light Industries\" plan on announcing the functions of the chip and its virtual city to the public and world leaders, though Walker wants to use them for spying and blackmail. He uses Jobe to deal with anything that could stop him, such as crashing a plane carrying a senator who is opposed to the launch, and killing anyone who gets too close to the truth through virtual reality. Trace, Peter, and the others make an attempt to break into Virtual Light to steal the chip, but are nearly killed by Jobe before they are rescued by Dr. Cori Platt, Trace's former partner and lover.\n\nAfter stealing the chip they find it is a decoy. Walker keeps the real chip in his office and the launch of the chip seems inevitable. Jobe begins causing havoc through the chip by accessing credit accounts, ATM machines, and water and power in an attempt to destroy the world so that everyone may join and follow him as a virtual messiah. Walker attempts to stop Jobe but is gunned down by his own security.\n\nThe group returns to Virtual Light Industries. Trace explains that the Egypt link is a [[Firewall (computing)|dam]] function designed to prevent \"ultimate power\". Jobe has built around the link without knowing its purpose. Trace and the others confront Jobe in his virtual city, in an attempt to get him roused enough to overpower himself. \"Egypt\" kicks in, destroying the virtual city and reducing Jobe to his simpleton persona. Peter goes to see Jobe before a wounded Walker takes Peter hostage in an attempt to bargain for the chip. Jobe distracts Walker long enough for Trace to strike him, causing him to land on exposed wiring that kills him. Peter and the others collect Jobe as they go home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Patrick Bergin]] as Dr. Benjamin Trace\n* [[Matt Frewer]] as Jobe Smith\n* [[Austin O'Brien]] as Peter Parkette\n* [[Ely Pouget]] as Dr. Cori Platt\n* [[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] as Jonathan Walker\n* Camille Cooper as Jennifer\n* Patrick LaBrecque as Shawn\n* [[Crystal Celeste Grant]] as Jade\n* Sean P.

Filming for the sequel commenced in March 1995 in Los Angeles with only Austin O'Brien returning from the original. Pierce Brosnan was initially asked to return as well but was unavailable due to the production of ''[[GoldenEye]]'' - this led to the hiring of [[Patrick Bergin]] as Dr. Benjamin Trace. Original director [[Brett Leonard]] was directing ''[[Virtuosity]]'' at the same time and did not return to helm the sequel to his original film. {{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Lawnmower Man 2'' was poorly received by critics, with an 10% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 2.4/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/lawnmower_man_2_jobes_war/|title=Lawnmower Man 2 - Jobe's War (Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace)}}</ref> The plot and characters were generally negatively received,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid:138301|title=Film Review: The Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond www.deseretnews.com/article/700001006/Lawnmower-Man-2-Beyond-Cyberspace.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700001006/Lawnmower-Man-2-Beyond-Cyberspace.html|title=Film review: Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond www.deseretnews.com/article/700001006/Lawnmower-Man-2-Beyond-Cyberspace.html|first=Chris|last=Hicks|date=14 January 1996}}</ref> while the visual effects received mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1996/tv/reviews/lawnmower-man-2-beyond-www.deseretnews.com/article/700001006/Lawnmower-Man-2-Beyond-Cyberspace.html-1200444491/|title=Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond www.deseretnews.com/article/700001006/Lawnmower-Man-2-Beyond-Cyberspace.html|date=15 January 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/lawnmowerman2.htm|title='Lawnmover Man 2: Beyond www.deseretnews.com/article/700001006/Lawnmower-Man-2-Beyond-Cyberspace.html' (PG-13)|first=Richard|last=Harrington|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0116839}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|lawnmower_man_2_jobes_war}}\n\n{{Farhad Mann}}\n{{Media based on Stephen King works}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:Films about computing]]\n[[Category:Films about telepresence]]\n[[Category:American films about revenge]]\n[[Category:1996 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction action films]]\n[[Category:Techno-thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Farhad Mann]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Robert Folk]]\n[[Category:Films shot from the first-person perspective]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
