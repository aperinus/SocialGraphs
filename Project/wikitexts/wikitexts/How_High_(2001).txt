The ghost helps with their exams, and they receive scholarships to [[Harvard University]]. The film received generally negative reviews.<ref name=\"rt\" /><ref name=\"mc\" />\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2022}}\nTwo underachieving [[Cannabis smoking|potheads]], Silas ([[Method Man]]) and Jamal ([[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]) are visited by the ghost of Silas's recent deceased friend Ivory (Chuck Deezy). Ivory was cremated and Silas used his ashes as [[fertilizer]] for a new batch of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. While sitting in the parking lot before taking their \"THC\" (Testing for Higher Credentials, a parody of the [[SAT]] and an allusion to [[tetrahydrocannabinol]]) exams for college, Silas has his marijuana but no cigar while Jamal has a cigar but nothing left to smoke, leading them to team up in Silas's car.\n\nThey soon discover that smoking Silas's new batch summons the ghost of the recently deceased Ivory, visible to just the two of them. Ivory tells them the test answers as they take the test and they both score perfect scores. Several dubious colleges offer the pair [[scholarship]]s, but none of them are appealing. Eventually, Chancellor Huntley ([[Fred Willard]]) suggests the two apply to [[Harvard University]].\n\nOnce there, they meet Bart (Chris Elwood), captain of the [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] team, his girlfriend Lauren ([[Lark Voorhies]]), I Need Money ([[Al Shearer]]), and their roommates Jeffrey (Justin Urich) and Tuan (Trieu Tran). Once they are settled in, they visit Dean Carl Cain ([[Obba Babatund\u00e9]]) who tells them that per the terms of their scholarship, they must maintain a minimum [[Academic grading in the United States#Grade point average|grade point average]] of 2.0 in order to remain, or else face [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]].\n\nJamal joins the rowing team hoping to outrank Bart. Silas enrolls in a [[botany]] class to develop his [[Cannabis (drug)|\"herbal\"]] skills, and they both enroll in [[African-American history|black history]]. Throughout the semester, they pass every test with the help of Ivory. Silas continues to woo and study with Lauren, while Jamal dates the [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. vice president's]] ([[Jeffrey Jones]]) daughter Jamie ([[Essence Atkins]]).\n\nAlso during the first half of the [[Academic term#Synonyms|semester]], they pull pranks and steal, which angers Bart, Jeffrey (who is pledging for a [[Final Club]]), and Dean Cain. Things go downhill after Silas and Jamal's raucous [[Halloween]] party. At the party, Gerald ([[T. J. Thyne]]), the volunteer officer whose bicycle was stolen and crushed by I Need Money, steals and smokes the Ivory plant, leaving the pair without access to Ivory.\n\nSilas begins working on a [[truth serum]] for his Botany class, using plant extracts. Silas concludes that, if his experiment works, he will earn an A in Botany, and a guarantee of a next semester. His experiment fails numerous times. Before [[Academic term|midterms]] Jamal suggests they go to a graveyard, dig up a \"smart dead guy\", and smoke his remains which they attempted to do so with [[John Quincy Adams]]. Whereas Silas suggests simply that they study hard for a few hours a day while [[Substance intoxication|high]]. They try Silas's plan, but it does not pan out, as they end up failing almost all of their midterm exams.\n\nDesperate to stay in Harvard, they try Jamal's plan, but it proves fruitless, as well. Meanwhile, Gerald, who has morphed into a complete stoner, sees Ivory during one of his binges, and, at Ivory's behest, returns the remnants of the Ivory plant to Jamal and Silas. Due to Gerald's abuse of the plant very little remains and Jamal and Silas continue to fail their classes, which pleases Dean Cain.\n\nWith the last final exam approaching, Jamal and Silas resign themselves to give up. However, Jeffrey reminds Silas of his guarantee of another semester if he can successfully fix his truth serum experiment. Silas ultimately does, having found a solution in which the last of Ivory's leaves could be used to counteract nausea.\n\nNonetheless, because of their low grades, Jamal and Silas do not receive an invitation to the Harvard [[Alumnus|Alumni]] party. Dean Cain, clearly thrilled with this result, tells Bart he does not have to worry about the pair showing up or staying in Harvard. However, that changes when Jamie invites them both as her dates, as her father is an alumnus. At the party, Silas makes things a bit more interesting by testing out his truth serum experiment, which proves successful.\n\nAt Lauren's presentation at the alumni party of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s artifacts, she shocks everyone with her discovery: the artifacts turn out to be a [[bong]]. Ivory even shows up with Benjamin Franklin to confirm the bong's authenticity. Dean Cain is outraged by this finding, but the Chancellor decides that he has had it with the Dean and fires him. Jamal and Silas are proud that the serum worked, a celebration that was almost short-lived, as Dean Cain returns and unsuccessfully attempts to kill them both with an [[ax]] as revenge. He is eventually apprehended by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. At the end, Jamal and Silas are able to stay, Jamal and Jamie get approval of Jamie's father to date, and Lauren leaves Bart for Silas because Bart \"can't satisfy her\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Method Man]] as Silas P.
