It stars [[Danny Glover]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Luke Wilson]], and Owen Wilson. Ostensibly based on a nonexistent novel, and told with a narrative influenced by the writing of [[J. D. Salinger]], it follows the lives of three gifted siblings who experience great success in youth, and even greater disappointment and failure in adulthood. The children's [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] father Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) leaves them in their adolescent years, then returns to them after they have grown, falsely claiming he has a [[terminal illness]]. He works on reconciling with his children and ex-wife (Huston).\n\nWith a variety of influences, including [[Louis Malle]]'s 1963 film ''[[The Fire Within]]'' and [[Orson Welles]]' 1942 film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', the story involves themes of the [[dysfunctional family]], lost greatness, and redemption. An [[Absurdism|absurdist]] and ironic sense of humor pervades the film, which features a [[The Royal Tenenbaums (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] subsequently released in two albums.\n\n''The Royal Tenenbaums'' was shot in and around New York City, including a house in [[Harlem]] used for the Tenenbaum residence. The filmmakers went to efforts to distinguish the film's backgrounds from a recognizable New York, with fashions and sets combining the appearances of different time periods.\n\nAfter debuting at the [[New York Film Festival]], ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' received positive reviews from critics and was Anderson's most financially successful film until 2014's ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''. Hackman won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] for his performance, and the screenwriters were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. In 2016, it was included in [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]].\n\n== Plot ==\nRoyal Tenenbaum explains to his three adolescent children, Chas, Margot, and Richie, that he and his wife, Etheline, are separating. Each of the children achieved great success at a young age. Chas is a math and business genius, from whom Royal steals money. Margot, who was adopted, was awarded a grant for a play that she wrote in the ninth grade. Richie is a [[tennis]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]] and artist who expresses his love for Margot through paintings. Royal regularly takes Richie on outings without the other children. Eli Cash is the Tenenbaums' neighbor and Richie's best friend. Also part of the Tenenbaum household is Pagoda, the trusted valet.\n\nTwenty-two years later, Royal is kicked out of the hotel where he has been living. The children are in a post-success slump, with Richie traveling the world on a [[cruise ship]], following a breakdown. He writes to Eli revealing his romantic love for Margot. Chas has become overprotective of his sons, Ari and Uzi, following his wife Rachael's death in a plane crash. Margot is married to [[neurologist]] Raleigh St. Clair, from whom she hides her smoking and her checkered past. Raleigh is conducting research on a subject named Dudley Heinsbergen.\n\nEtheline's longtime accountant, Henry Sherman, proposes to her. Learning of Henry's proposal, Royal claims that he has [[stomach cancer]] to win back his wife's and children's affections. Etheline calls her children home, and Royal moves back in and sets up medical equipment in Richie's room. Royal learns of Chas' overprotective nature and takes his grandsons on an adventure involving [[shoplifting]] and [[dog fighting]]. On their return, Chas berates him for endangering his boys while Royal accuses Chas of having a [[nervous breakdown]].\n\nEli, with whom Margot has been having an affair, tells her that Richie loves her. Royal discovers the affair and objects to Margot's treatment of Raleigh, who confides to Richie his suspicions of Margot having an affair. He and Richie hire a [[private investigator]] to surveil her. Meanwhile, Henry investigates Royal's cancer claim and discovers his hospital had closed, his doctor does not exist, and that his cancer medication is only candy. He confronts Pagoda, the servant, and gathers the family to tell them that Royal has been lying about his illness. Afterwards, Royal and Pagoda move out.\n\nRichie and Raleigh get the private eye's report on Margot, which reveals her history of smoking and sexual promiscuity, including a previous marriage to a [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] recording artist. Both men take the news hard, with Richie going into a bathroom, shaving off his hair and beard, and slashing his wrists in an attempt of suicide. Dudley finds him and Raleigh rushes him to hospital. As the Tenenbaums sit in the waiting room, Raleigh confronts Margot and then leaves. Richie escapes and meets with Margot to confess his love. They share their secret love and they kiss.\n\nRoyal decides that he wants Etheline to be happy, and finally arranges for a divorce. Before Henry and Etheline's wedding, Eli, high on [[mescaline]], crashes his car into the side of the house. Royal rescues Ari and Uzi, but the boys' dog, Buckley, is killed. Enraged, Chas chases Eli through the house and wrestles him to the ground. Eli and Chas agree that they both need psychiatric help. Chas thanks Royal for saving his sons and for buying them a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] named Spark Plug from the responding firemen as a replacement for Buckley. Forty-eight hours later, Etheline and Henry are married in a [[judge's chambers]].\n\nSome time later, Margot releases a new play inspired by her family and past events, Raleigh publishes a book about Dudley's condition, Eli checks himself into a drug rehabilitation facility in [[North Dakota]], and Richie begins teaching a junior tennis program. Chas becomes less overprotective of his children. Royal seems to have improved his relationship with all his children, and seems to be on better terms with Etheline. He has a [[heart attack]] and dies at the age of 68. Chas accompanies him in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, and is the only witness to his death. The family attends his funeral, where the [[epitaph]] dubiously reads that he \"Died tragically rescuing his family from the wreckage of a destroyed sinking battleship.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Anjelica Huston]] star as Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = GeneHackmanJun08.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | image2    = Anjelica Huston1.JPG\n | width2    = 148\n | alt2      =\n}}\n''The Royal Tenenbaums'' has an [[ensemble cast]],<ref name=\"TIMEStaff\">{{cite magazine |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/04/23/top-10-troubled-genius-films/slide/the-royal-tenenbaums-2001/ |author=Staff |date=April 23, 2009 |title=Top 10 Troubled Genius Films |access-date=September 19, 2017 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323110906/http://entertainment.time.com/2009/04/23/top-10-troubled-genius-films/slide/the-royal-tenenbaums-2001/ |archive-date=March 23, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"Redshaw\">{{cite web |url=http://old.post-gazette.com/movies/20020106tenenp3.asp |last=Redshaw |first=Rebecca |date=January 6, 2002 |title='Tenenbaums' writer/director attracts stellar cast, led by Gene Hackman |access-date=September 19, 2017 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919140543/http://old.post-gazette.com/movies/20020106tenenp3.asp |archive-date=September 19, 2017 }}</ref> led by Hackman.<ref name=\"Redshaw\" /><ref name=\"Queenan\" /> [[Alec Baldwin]] also serves as the narrator.<ref name=\"Queenan\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/16/features.joequeenan |title=Gene therapy |last=Queenan |first=Joe |access-date=September 18, 2017 |date=March 16, 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917050059/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/16/features.joequeenan |archive-date=September 17, 2017 }}</ref> The fictional family and performers are:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20020197.pdf |date=2002 |title=The Royal Tenenbaums |access-date=September 19, 2017 |publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]] |language=de |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823044546/http://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20020197.pdf |archive-date=August 23, 2004 }}</ref>\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart | RT | y | ET |~| HS | | | | | | RT = Royal Tenenbaum<br />([[Gene Hackman]]) |ET = Etheline Tenenbaum<br />([[Anjelica Huston]]) |HS = Henry Sherman<br />([[Danny Glover]]) }}\n{{chart | | , | -

However, Kornhaber added Royal may also view his family members as \"external expressions of himself\", and this explains why the title refers to them as Royal Tenenbaums.{{sfn|Kornhaber|2017}}\n\n[[File:The-Magnificent-Ambersons-5.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Orson Welles]]' 1942 film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' influenced the film's themes, with Anderson selecting a main set reminiscent of Welles' production.]]\nAuthor Mark Browning also identified the [[dysfunctional family]] and family happiness as a key theme.{{sfn|Browning|2011|p=38}} Mayshark commented on the depiction of decline after genius, with all the characters being past the peak of their greatness and now being left \"sad, individually and collectively\".{{sfn|Mayshark|2007|p=129}} Browning assessed the Tenenbaum sons and daughter as [[child prodigy|child prodigies]], with \"clear-cut genius status\".{{sfn|Browning|2011|p=36}} Ethel is not negligent as a mother,{{sfn|Browning|2011|p=37}} fostering her children's talents, though in dispensing money without question she may have [[Spoiled child|spoiled]] them.{{sfn|Browning|2011|p=38}}\n\nThe children grow up hailed as a \"family of geniuses\", and when they face failure in adulthood, they turn to nostalgia, with academic Daniel Cross Turner remarking the word \"[[nostalgia]]\" literally means returning home in pain.{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=159\u2013160}} The fact that the Tenenbaums dress alike as children and adults also reveals their nostalgia,{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=161}} and Turner connected Royal's nostalgia with Dudley's fictional Heinsbergen syndrome symptom, an inability to \"tell time\".{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=164}} Professor [[Whitney Crothers Dilley]] considered that confrontation between past reputation and the private reality is what moves Margot not to take the word \"genius\" lightly, and to deny she was ever a genius, despite Royal insisting people called her one.{{sfn|Dilley|2017}} Although the film ends without any of the characters regaining their lost glory, they form new bonds, particularly between Royal and Chas, or realize secret desires, in the case of Richie and Margot.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=87}}\n\nFilm Professor [[Christopher Robe]] commented on the loss of loved ones, particularly Royal's parents and Chas' wife Rachael, having an impact on the characters' [[Depression (mood)|depression]].
