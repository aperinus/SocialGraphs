It grossed $966 million worldwide, making it the [[2016 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2016]]. The film won accolades for achievements in visual effects at the [[89th Academy Awards]], [[22nd Critics' Choice Awards]], and [[70th British Academy Film Awards]].  The [[Rotten Tomatoes]] critical consensus describes it \"as lovely to behold as it is engrossing to watch\". A sequel is in development, with Marks as the screenwriter, and Favreau returning as director and as a producer.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the jungles of 1890s [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|India]], [[Mowgli]] is an orphaned boy raised by the wolf [[Raksha (The Jungle Book)|Raksha]] and her pack, led by [[Akela (The Jungle Book)|Akela]], ever since he was brought to them as an infant by the black panther [[Bagheera]]. Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but he  faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings, while Akela objects to him using human \"tricks\", like building tools, instead of learning the ways of the pack.\n\nOne day, during the [[dry season]], the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a drought that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of their predators. The truce is disrupted when a murderous and vicious [[Bengal tiger]] named [[Shere Khan]] arrives, detecting Mowgli's scent in the crowd. Consumed by a vendetta against humans for scarring him with [[fire]], he threatens to kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether or not they should keep Mowgli. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera volunteers to guide him to the nearby \"man-village\".\n\nEn route, Shere Khan ambushes them, but Mowgli manages to escape amidst a [[wild water buffalo|buffalo]] stampede. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous [[Pythonidae|python]] named [[Kaa]], who hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan while protecting him. Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but she is attacked by a bear named [[Baloo]] who rescues the unconscious Mowgli. Mowgli later awakens and retrieves some difficult-to-access honey for Baloo as repayment, with the two bonding in the process. Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Meanwhile, upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, Shere Khan kills Akela and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out.\n\nBagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is shocked that Mowgli has not joined the humans as he had agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of elephants gathered around a ditch and uses vines to save their baby. Although Baloo and Bagheera are impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village.\n\nMowgli is kidnapped by a gang of monkeys known as the \"[[Bandar-log]]\", who present him to their leader, a deranged gigantic [[Gigantopithecus]] named [[King Louie]]. Assuming that all humans can make \"the red flower\" (fire), King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for it. Baloo distracts King Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak Mowgli out, but their ruse is uncovered. As King Louie chases Mowgli through his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death, but Mowgli doesn't believe him. King Louie's rampage eventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him. Bagheera and Baloo confess the truth to Mowgli about Akela.\n\nFurious that Baloo and Bagheera neglected to tell him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan. He steals a lit torch from the man village and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who claims that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Seeing the wolves' fear of him, Mowgli throws the torch into a river in rage, restoring their trust in him. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack hold off Shere Khan when he attacks, giving Mowgli enough time to flee into the burning jungle. Shere Khan defeats all of them single-handedly and goes after Mowgli, who lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under his weight, and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire.\n\nIn the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, calling with Baloo, and Bagheera.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Jungle Book characters{{!}}List of ''The Jungle Book'' characters}}\n<!--English cast only-->\n[[File:Neel Sethi Press conference of 'The Jungle Book'.jpg|thumb|upright|Neel Sethi, the actor who portrayed Mowgli]]\n* Neel Sethi as [[Mowgli]]: <br />A young boy who was raised by wolves.
