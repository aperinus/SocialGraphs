As of August 2022, word count is 644. -->\nKing Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to [[Rumpelstiltskin]] (\"Rumpel\"), in exchange for lifting the curse of their daughter, [[Princess Fiona]], who was cursed to be an ogre as a child, and was locked in a tower until her \"true love\" can rescue her. However, the deal is canceled when they're informed that Fiona was rescued.{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001)}} Rumpel laments his loss and wishes that Fiona's rescuer, [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], was never born.\n\nIn the present, Shrek has grown tired of being a family man and celebrity, longing for the days when he was feared and had privacy, and Rumpel has since become an outcast. While celebrating his children's first birthday at a restaurant in Far Far Away, an escalating series of events further injure Shrek's ego and cause him to walk out in anger and lash out at Fiona. Having seen the outburst, Rumpel follows Shrek into the forest and invites him into his carriage. Inside Rumpel's carriage, Shrek laments that he is no longer a \"real ogre\", so Rumpel offers him a deal to receive a day as a \"real ogre\" in exchange for a day from his past. Shrek signs a contract fulfilling this wish, and is taken to an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]].\n\nNow feared by the villagers, Shrek causes some lighthearted mischief, until he discovers that Fiona is a fugitive and his swamp is deserted. Captured by [[Witchcraft|witches]], Shrek is taken to Rumpel, who's now the king of Far Far Away. Rumpel reveals to Shrek that he took the day he was born, meaning Shrek never existed in this altered timeline. Consequently, Harold and Lillian were forced to sign the kingdom over to Rumpel, causing them to disappear, and when the day ends, Shrek will cease to exist.\n\nShrek escapes Rumpel's castle with an enslaved [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], who is initially terrified of him, but befriends him after seeing him cry over his erased history, and the two realize that Rumpel's contract can be nullified by \"true love's kiss\". The pair soon encounter a still-cursed Fiona leading an army of ogres in a resistance against Rumpel, and a lazy and overweight [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] being kept as Fiona's pet. Shrek unsuccessfully tries to woo Fiona, who has since lost hope of finding true love after not being rescued, and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel.\n\nDuring the ambush, most of the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], who was hired by Rumpel, but Shrek and Fiona escape with Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists that Fiona kiss him, assuring her that it will fix everything, she reluctantly obliges, but nothing happens, making Shrek realize that Fiona doesn't love him. Later on, Rumpel publicly offers a wish to anyone who brings Shrek to him, and after hearing this, Shrek turns himself in. Rumpel is forced to grant Shrek's wish, and he uses it to free the other ogres. As Shrek is locked up, Rumpel reveals that Fiona was not released, since she is still a human by day, and he plans to have them killed by the [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]]. Donkey, Puss, and the freed ogres storm the castle, capture Rumpel, and defeat his witch army, while Shrek and Fiona take down the Dragon.\n\nAs the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having finally fallen in love with him, kisses him just before he disappears. Seeing that she is still an ogre in the sunlight, Fiona realizes that her curse was broken and now she has assumed \"love's true form\" just as the alternate reality disintegrates, making everyone disappear, and they are then transported back to the original timeline at the moment before Shrek lost his temper at the party. Instead of lashing out, Shrek embraces his family and friends, Rumpel is locked in a cage for his crimes, and Shrek has a newfound appreciation for his calmer life.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple
