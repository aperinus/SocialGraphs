His best friend, Billy, makes a living kidnapping dogs and collecting rewards for their safe return. His partner-in-crime is Hans, a religious man whose wife Myra has cancer.\n\nMarty writes a story about a psychopath, the \"Quaker\", who stalks his daughter's killer for decades, driving him to suicide. Billy suggests Marty use the \"Jack of Diamonds\" killer, perpetrator of a recent double murder, as one of the seven. Billy puts an ad in the paper inviting psychopaths to share their stories for Marty's script. Zachariah Rigby approaches him, sharing his story of having been a part of a serial killer duo who killed other serial killers: the [[Texarkana Moonlight Murders|Texarkana Moonlight Murderer]], the [[Cleveland Torso Killer]], and the [[Zodiac killer]]. However Zachariah wants Marty to include a message to Maggie, his former partner in crime and lover, in the credits.\n\nBilly and Hans steal Bonny, a [[Shih Tzu]], the beloved pet of Charlie Costello, an unpredictable and violent gangster. His thugs, led by Paulo, discover Hans' connection to the kidnapping. They threaten to kill Marty and Hans, but the Jack of Diamonds killer arrives and kills them. Charlie traces Myra to the cancer ward and kills her when she refuses to tell him anything.\n\nBilly goes to meet his girlfriend, Angela, who is also Charlie's girlfriend. After telling her he kidnapped Bonny, she snitches. Billy, discovering Charlie killed Myra, shoots Angela in retaliation. Charlie arrives at Billy's and discovers many packs of playing cards with the jack of diamonds missing, realizing he is the \"Jack of Diamonds\" killer.\n\nMarty, Billy, and Hans leave for the desert with Bonny. Hans reveals that he was the Quaker, which Marty wrote the story about after hearing it from a drunken Billy. When the trio arrive to the desert, they set up camp. Billy suggests ''Seven Psychopaths'' end with a shootout between all of the psychopaths.\n\nMarty and Hans see a headline saying that Billy is wanted in connection with the Jack of Diamonds killings. When he's confronted, he reveals that he assumed the Jack of Diamonds persona would inspire him, but Marty declares they must go home. Meanwhile, Hans has a vision of Myra in a \"grey place,\" leading him to doubt his belief in the [[afterlife]]. He ignores Marty's reassurances that his vision was a [[peyote]]-induced hallucination. Billy sets the car on fire, stranding the trio. He then calls Charlie, giving him their location. To alleviate Hans' doubts about an afterlife, Billy claims to have impersonated Myra; but, not able to describe precisely what Myra had said to Hans in his vision of her (other than it was \"grey\" as Billy had overheard earlier), Hans walks away.\n\nBilly, with Bonny in tow, impatiently waits for Charlie's arrival, intending to have a climactic shootout. Charlie arrives alone and unarmed, apart from a flare gun. An enraged Billy shoots him, feeling cheated out of a shootout. Marty drives away with Charlie, intending to take him to a hospital, when Billy realizes the flare gun's purpose and fires it. Hans finds Charlie's thugs awaiting the flare signal. The large group catches the attention of the police, who draw closer. Hans pretends to draw a weapon, causing Paulo to shoot him in front of the police. Before dying, he says \"It isn't grey at all\".\n\nThe thugs head towards the signal, with police in pursuit, and find Marty and Charlie, who reveals that he only suffered a flesh wound. With backup, Charlie returns to Billy. After a shootout, Charlie and Billy have a stand-off, respectively holding Marty and Bonny hostage. Charlie releases Marty and shoots Billy just as the police arrive. Charlie and Paulo are arrested, but Bonny stays at the dying Billy's side. Marty catches up with Hans's body, finding a tape recorder with suggestions for ''Seven Psychopaths''.\n\nMarty, having adopted Bonny, finishes the screenplay. Some time later, after the ''Seven Psychopaths'' movie is shown in theaters, he receives a call from Zachariah. He threatens to kill him for not leaving a message to Maggie as promised. On hearing Marty's weary and resigned acceptance, Zachariah realizes his experiences have left him a changed man, and decides to spare him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Marty Faranan\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Billy Bickle\n* [[Woody Harrelson]] as Charlie Costello\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Hans Kieslowski / The Quaker\n** [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as The Imagined Quaker\n* [[Tom Waits]] as Zachariah Rigby\n** [[Brendan Sexton III]] as Young Zachariah Rigby\n* [[Abbie Cornish]] as Kaya\n* [[Olga Kurylenko]] as Angela\n* [[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Paulo\n* Linda Bright Clay as Myra Kieslowski\n* [[Amanda Warren]] as Maggie Rigby\n* Long Nguyen as the [[Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c|Vietnamese Priest / Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c]]\n* James H\u00e9bert as Killer\n* [[Christine Marzano]] as The Hooker\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Dennis\n* [[Gabourey Sidibe]] as Sharice\n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Larry\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Tommy\n* [[Helena Mattsson]] as Blonde Lady\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe first casting announcements were made on 12 May 2011.<ref name=\"EmpireOnline\">Williams, Owen (12 May 2011).
