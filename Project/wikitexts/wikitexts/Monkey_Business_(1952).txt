To avoid confusion with the unrelated 1931 [[Marx Brothers]] [[Monkey Business (1931 film)|film of the same name]], this film is sometimes referred to as '''''Howard Hawks' Monkey Business'''''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Monkey Business trailer.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ginger Rogers, Robert Cornthwaite, Cary Grant, and Marilyn Monroe in ''Monkey Business'']]\nDr. Barnaby Fulton ([[Cary Grant]]), an absent-minded research chemist for the Oxley chemical company, is trying to develop an [[Rejuvenation|elixir of youth]].  He is urged on by his commercially minded boss, Oliver Oxley ([[Charles Coburn]]). One of Dr. Fulton's [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, Esther, gets loose in the laboratory, mixes a beaker of chemicals, and pours the mix into the [[water cooler]]. The chemicals have the rejuvenating effect Fulton is seeking.\n\nUnaware of Esther's antics, Fulton tests his latest experimental concoction on himself and washes it down with water from the cooler. He soon begins to act like a 20-year-old and spends the day out on the town with his boss's secretary, Lois Laurel ([[Marilyn Monroe]]). When Fulton's wife, Edwina ([[Ginger Rogers]]), learns that the elixir \"works\", she drinks some along with water from the cooler and turns into a prank-pulling schoolgirl.\n\nEdwina makes an impetuous phone call to her old flame, the family lawyer, Hank Entwhistle ([[Hugh Marlowe]]). Her mother, who knows nothing of the elixir, believes that Edwina is truly unhappy in her marriage and wants a divorce.\n\nBarnaby takes more elixir and befriends a group of kids playing as make-believe [[Native Americans in the United States|\"Indians\" (Native Americans)]].  They capture and \"scalp\" Hank (giving him a [[Mohawk hairstyle]]), later fleeing when police show up. Meanwhile, Edwina lies down to sleep off the formula. Meanwhile, a woman leaves her baby with the Fultons' housekeeper as she needs an emergency babysitter. When Edwina awakens, a naked baby is next to her and Barnaby's clothes are nearby. She mistakenly presumes he has taken too much formula and regressed to a baby. She takes the child to Oxley to resolve the problem. Together the two attempt to find an antidote and when the baby grows sleepy, Edwina tries to put him to sleep in the hopes of reversing the effects.\n\nMeanwhile, more and more scientists (and Mr. Oxley) at the laboratory are drinking the water and reverting to a second childhood. The formula is lost with the last of the water poured away. As the water is poured away, Barnaby crawls into the laboratory through the window and lies down to sleep next to the baby. Edwina later discovers him and realizes her mistake with the baby. Later at home as Barnaby and Edwina are planning to go out, their spirits and marriage renewed, Barnaby notes that \"you're old only when you forget you're young.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Dr. Barnaby Fulton\n* [[Ginger Rogers]] as Edwina Fulton\n* [[Marilyn Monroe]] as Lois Laurel\n* [[Charles Coburn]] as Oliver Oxley\n* [[Hugh Marlowe]] as Hank Entwhistle\n* [[Henri Letondal]] as Dr. Jerome Kitzel\n* [[Robert O.

[[Peter Bogdanovich]] has noted that the scenes with [[Cary Grant]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] work especially well and laments that Monroe was not the leading lady instead of [[Ginger Rogers]]. However, Gregory Lamb of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' described Rogers as \"a comedienne par excellence\" in the film.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Culture-Cafe/2011/1104/Celebrating-the-Ginger-Rogers-century The Christian Science Monitor, November 4, 2011: ''Celebrating the Ginger Rogers century'']</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Monkey Business (1952 film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|0044916}}\n* {{AllMovie title|33125}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1014138-monkey_business}}\n* {{AFI film|50578}}\n* {{BBFC title|AFF045976|Monkey Business}}\n* {{TCMDb title|83861}}\n* [http://www.carygrant.net/reviews/monkey.html Historic reviews, photo gallery at CaryGrant.net]\n\n{{Howard Hawks}}\n{{Charles Lederer}}\n\n{{Ben Hecht}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1952 films]]\n[[Category:1952 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1950s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1950s screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American screwball comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Howard Hawks]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Sol C.
