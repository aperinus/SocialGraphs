It stars the voice roles of [[Charlize Theron]], [[Art Parkinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[George Takei]], [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], [[Rooney Mara]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]]. The film revolves around Kubo, a young boy who wields a magical {{transliteration|ja|[[shamisen]]}} (a Japanese [[stringed instrument]]) and whose left eye was stolen during infancy. Accompanied by an anthropomorphic [[snow monkey]] and [[beetle]], he must embark on a quest to defeat his mother's evil twin Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather, the Moon King, who is responsible for stealing his left eye.\n\nLaika's production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] pitched the fantasy story stop-motion animated film based on samurais to Knight. By December 2014, Laika announced that ''Kubo and the Two Strings'' would be released in August 2016, with Knight to direct and produce the project, as well as the voice casting announcement. He was enthusiastic about the project by owing partly his affinity towards both the \"epic fantasy\" genre as well as Japanese culture in general, despite the studio never ventured into the genre before. The stop-motion animation were inspired by Japanese media such as [[ink wash painting]] and [[origami]] among others. According to Knight, he mentioned that the story for the film was partly inspired by works of Japanese animator [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. [[Dario Marianelli]], who composed the music for Laika's one prior film, returned to compose the film's musical score for its second.\n\n''Kubo and the Two Strings'' premiered at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] on August 13, 2016 and was released by [[Focus Features]] in the United States on August 19. The film received critical acclaim for its craftsmanship, musical score and story, but was a [[box-office bomb|box-office disappointment]], grossing $77 million worldwide against a $60 million budget. It received criticism for its perceived [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]] casting choice. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], and was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], becoming the second stop-motion animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and the first Laika film to be nominated for both.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary. -->\n\nIn [[feudal Japan]], a 12-year-old boy with only one eye named Kubo tends to his ill mother in a mountain cave near a village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his {{transliteration|ja|[[shamisen]]}} for the village folk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and his mother cannot recall the end due to her deteriorating mental state. His mother warns him not to stay out after dark or her Sisters, and his grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.\n\nOne day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. The Sisters quickly find him and attack, but his mother suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor.\n\nKubo wakes up in a distant land to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, has come alive. Monkey tells him his mother is gone and the village destroyed. With help of \"Little Hanzo\", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice.\n\nKubo, Monkey, and Beetle reclaim the \"Sword Unbreakable\" from a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]]. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the \"Breastplate Impenetrable\" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the \"Garden of Eyes\", who first uses its many eyes to entrance its victims by showing them visions of secrets, then eats them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and vanquishing one of the Sisters.\n\nThey go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting a blind elderly man, who points him towards the \"Helmet Invulnerable\" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and the remaining Sister. The Sister reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking their sister away from them, and kills Hanzo. Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his {{transliteration|ja|shamisen}} to vanquish the Sister, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight to Kubo that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.\n\nAt the village, Kubo meets the old man from his dream, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. The Moon King transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When the armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his {{transliteration|ja|shamisen}} using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon King that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon King, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers choose compassion and tell him he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' ghosts during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as Kubo, an adventurous 12-year-old boy who can move origami\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Kubo's Mother/Monkey, the latter being a reincarnation of the former\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Beetle/Hanzo, respectively Kubo's father and a cursed bug version of the latter\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as the Moon King, Kubo's grandfather who stole Kubo's left eye\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Mother's younger twin Sisters tasked with taking Kubo's eye by the Moon King\n* [[George Takei]] as Hosato\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Kameyo, Kubo's elderly friend\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Hashi\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.jpg|thumb|''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]'' by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] inspired the giant skeleton.]]\nAnnounced by the stop-motion animation studio [[Laika (company)|Laika]] in December 2014, the project is the directorial debut of Laika's CEO [[Travis Knight]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Pete|title=Laika & Focus Begin Production On All-Star 'Kubo And The Two Strings' To Kick Off 3-Pic Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|access-date=January 15, 2015|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 22, 2014|archive-date=January 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120539/http://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|url-status=live}}</ref> Laika's production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] pitched the story to Knight as a \"stop-motion samurai epic\".
