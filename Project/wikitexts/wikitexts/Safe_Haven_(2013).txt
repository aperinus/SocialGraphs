The film marks the final film role for actor [[Red West]]. It was released theatrically in North America on February 14, 2013. The film was directed by [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]], and is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Nicholas Sparks]]' [[Safe Haven (novel)|2010 novel of the same name]]. The film was originally set for a February 8 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/11/relativity-dates-turkeys-shifts-safe-haven |title='Turkeys' Gets Date, 'Safe Haven' Shifts |date=November 16, 2012 |publisher=Deadline.com |access-date=2013-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with a terrified woman, Erin, barefoot and covered in blood, running to an elderly neighbor\u2019s house for shelter. She arrives at a bus station, now with cut and bleached hair. Cops appear and start looking for her, but she gets on a bus and escapes them. Finally, Erin arrives at [[Southport, North Carolina]].\n\nShe introduces herself as Katie at the general store, gets a job as a waitress, and rents a small house on the edge of town. She befriends her neighbor, Jo, and meets Alex Wheatley who operates the local general store. He is a widowed father of two young children, Josh, who has a strained relationship with him, and Lexie.\n\nKatie soon begins a relationship with Alex, and becomes a mother figure to Josh and Lexie. Meanwhile, Kevin Tierney, a Boston police detective, prepares wanted posters for \"Erin\", a woman accused of [[first-degree murder]]. Alex sees the poster in the police station and notices the picture bears a striking resemblance to Katie. He confronts her, causing a huge fight which ends in their breakup and her moving out.\n\nAs Katie is about to leave town, Alex intercepts her, saying he has fallen in love with her, begging her not to leave and promising to keep her safe. Katie reluctantly returns his love, and decides to stay in Southport (though still apprehensive of bringing danger upon his family). She tells him that she fled there to escape her [[domestic violence|abusive]] and [[alcoholic]] cop husband. They got in a big fight and she stabbed him in self-defense before fleeing in a panic.\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin is suspended for creating the false wanted posters - for crimes that were not committed - and for drinking on the job. He turns out to be Katie's (Erin's) husband, still alive and well. A flashback reveals that on the night Katie ran away, she stabbed Kevin with a knife when he attacked her in a drunken rage. Enraged, he breaks into Katie's former neighbor's home in Boston and gets the phone number to the restaurant where Katie works. Arriving in time for the town's [[Fourth of July]] parade, a severely intoxicated Kevin sees Katie kissing Alex, which enrages him. That evening, Katie has a dream that she is standing on the docks watching the fireworks when Jo comes up and tells Katie that \"he\" is here. Katie wakes up in the convenience store next to a sleeping Lexie when Kevin suddenly appears and confronts her, demanding that she go back with him. She refuses and tells him to leave. Kevin pulls a gun and pours gasoline all over the store, with the intent to burn it down.\n\nKatie buys time by faking sympathy and agreeing to go back with him. When he lets his guard down, she pushes him into the water. A firework spark lands on the gasoline, igniting a fire that engulfs the store. Alex sees the burning store, quickly crosses the harbor by boat, and saves Lexie. Meanwhile, as Katie tries to fight off Kevin, the gun goes off and kills him.\n\nAfter the fire, Alex recovers several letters written by his late wife Carly before she died. They were prepared ahead of time for memorable events such as Josh's eighteenth birthday and Lexie's wedding day. He also reconciles with Josh.\n\nJo later tells Katie that she will be leaving Southport soon. Katie thanks her for being a good friend and Jo tells her, \"You deserve this, Katie. You belong here.\"\n\nAlex gives Katie a letter with the words \"To Her\" on the envelope. It explains that Alex must be in love to have given her the letter and she hopes that she feels the same, wishing that she could be there with them. Enclosed with the letter is a photo of Alex's late wife. Katie realizes that her neighbor \"Jo\" was the ghost of Carly watching over them.<!-- ghost https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ryan/safe-haven-ending_b_2706717.html -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Julianne Hough]] as Erin Tierney / Katie Feldman, A young woman who flees her abusive husband and Alex's new girlfriend.\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as Alex Wheatley, Katie's new boyfriend and a widower who struggles to raise his two kids after the death of his wife.\n* [[Cobie Smulders]] as Carly Wheatley/Jo, a local woman who befriends Katie\n* [[David Lyons (actor)|David Lyons]] as Detective Kevin Tierney, Katie's abusive husband. \n* Mimi Kirkland as Lexie Wheatley, Daughter of Alex and who befriended Katie\n* [[Noah Lomax]] as Josh Wheatley, Son of Alex who has a rough and strained relationship with his father due to his mother's death.\n* Irene Ziegler as Mrs. Feldman\n* Robin Mullins as Maddie\n* [[Red West]] as Roger.
