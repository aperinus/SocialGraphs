It was also a financial success, grossing more than $273&nbsp;million worldwide against its $50&nbsp;million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> It was the [[1996 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 1996]]. It notably spawned a large number of catch phrases into popular culture, most prominently \"Show me the money\" and \"You had me at 'hello{{'\"}} (which were deemed the 25th and 52nd most memorable American movie quotations of all time, respectively, in a [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|2005 survey]] by the [[American Film Institute]]), but also including \"You complete me\", \"Help me help you\" and several others.\n\nThe film was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Tom Cruise, with [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] winning [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. It also received nominations for three Golden Globes, with Cruise winning for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], and three [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], with Gooding winning Best Supporting Actor.\n\n==Plot==\nJerry Maguire is a slick 35-year-old [[sports agent]] working for Sports Management International (SMI). After criticism from an injured player's son triggers a life-altering epiphany, he writes a [[mission statement]] about perceived dishonesty in the sports management business and his desire to work with fewer clients to produce a better, more caring personal relationship with them. In turn SMI management sends Bob Sugar, Jerry's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, to fire him. This spurs Jerry and Sugar to each call all of Jerry's clients to try to convince them not to hire the services of the other. Jerry speaks to [[Arizona Cardinals]] wide receiver Rod Tidwell, one of his clients who is disgruntled with his contract. He needs a $10 million contract for his family to live on. Jerry informs him if he gets injured for the season, he will get no money from the Cardinals. Rod tests Jerry's resolve through a very long telephone conversation, while Sugar persuades the rest of Jerry's clients to stick with SMI.\n\nLeaving the office Jerry announces that he will start his own agency and asks if anyone will join him, to which only 26-year-old [[single mother]] Dorothy Boyd agrees. Frank \"Cush\" Cushman, a superstar [[quarterback]] prospect who expects to be the number one pick in the [[National Football League Draft|NFL Draft]], initially also stays with Jerry after he makes a visit to the Cushman home. However, Sugar persuades Cushman and his father to sign with SMI over Jerry the night before the draft.\n\nAfter an argument Jerry breaks up with his disgruntled fianc\u00e9e Avery. He then turns to Dorothy, becoming closer to her young son, Ray, and starts a relationship with her. Dorothy contemplates moving to San Diego as she has a secure job offer there; however, she and Jerry get married. Jerry concentrates all his efforts on Rod, now his only client, who turns out to be very difficult to satisfy. Over the next several months, the two direct harsh criticism towards each other with Rod claiming that Jerry is not trying hard enough to get him a contract while Jerry claims that Rod is not proving himself worthy of the money for which he asks; one point of contention is that Rod is not very likable and comes across as aloof to the fans. Rod takes Jerry's advice to prove he is worthy of his contract. Rod is playing well and his team is winning. Jerry's marriage with Dorothy deteriorates and they separate.\n\nDuring a December ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the Cardinals and the [[Dallas Cowboys]], Rod plays well but appears to receive a serious [[injury]] when catching a winning touchdown, securing a spot for the Cardinals in the playoffs. He recovers and [[Touchdown celebration|dances for the wildly cheering crowd]]. Afterwards, Jerry and Rod embrace in front of other athletes and sports agents and show how their relationship has progressed from a strictly business one to a close personal one, which was one of the points Jerry made in his mission statement. He then flies back home to meet Dorothy, telling her that he loves her and wants her in his life, which she reciprocates. Rod appears on [[Roy Firestone]]'s sports show. Unbeknownst to him, Jerry has secured him an $11.2 million contract with the Cardinals, allowing him to finish his pro football career in [[Arizona]]. The emotional Rod proceeds to thank everyone and extends warm gratitude to Jerry. Jerry speaks with several other pro athletes, some of whom have read his earlier mission statement and respect his work with Rod.\n\nOne day, Ray throws a baseball up in the air, surprising Jerry, who then talks about Ray's possible future sports industry career with Dorothy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Gerald \"Jerry\" Maguire\n* [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] as Rod Tidwell\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Dorothy Boyd\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Avery Bishop\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Frank \"Cush\" Cushman\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Bob Sugar\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as Laurel Boyd\n* [[Regina King]] as Marcee Tidwell\n* [[Jonathan Lipnicki]] as Ray Boyd\n* [[Todd Louiso]] as Chad the Nanny\n* [[Jeremy Suarez]] as Tyson Tidwell\n* [[Jared Jussim]] as Dicky Fox\n* [[Jann Wenner]] as Scully\n* [[Ali Wentworth]] as Bobbi Fallon\n* [[Aries Spears]] as Teepee Tidwell\n* [[Kelly Coffield Park|Kelly Coffield]] as Jan\n* [[Winnie Holzman]] and [[Hynden Walch]] as members of the women's group\n* [[Glenn Frey]] as Dennis Wilburn\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Rick (Junior Agent)\n* [[Tom Gallop]] as Ben\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Kathy Sanders\n* [[Rick Johnson (quarterback)|Rick Johnson]] as John Swenson\n* [[Jerry Cantrell]] as Jesus of CopyMat\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Steve Remo\n* [[Drake Bell]] as Jesse Remo\n* [[Christine Cavanaugh]] as Mrs. Remo\n* [[Eric Stoltz]] as Ethan Valhere\n* [[Brent Barry]] as Calvin Nack\n* Theo Greenly as Hootie Fan\n* [[Jerry Ziesmer]] as Trainer\n* [[Anthony Natale]] as Elevator Couple\n* [[Reagan Gomez-Preston]] as Tidwell's Cousin\n* [[Lucy Liu]], [[Justina Vail Evans]], [[Samantha Smith (actress)|Samantha Smith]], [[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]], [[Lisa Stahl]], [[Emily Procter]], [[Stacey Williams]], [[Lisa Ann Hadley]], [[Alison Armitage]] and [[Rebecca Rigg]] as Former Girlfriends\n* [[Beau Bridges]] as Matt Cushman (uncredited){{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Barry Switzer]] as himself (uncredited){{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n}}\nAs Themselves\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Roy Firestone]]\n* [[Al Michaels]]\n* [[Dan Dierdorf]]\n* [[Frank Gifford]]\n* [[Mel Kiper Jr.]]\n* [[Jeffrey Lurie]]\n* [[Drew Rosenhaus]]\n* [[Rich Kotite]]\n* [[Tim McDonald]]\n* [[Mike Tirico]]\n* [[Wayne Fontes]]\n* [[Mike White (American football coach)|Mike White]]\n* [[Johnnie Morton]]\n* [[Rick Mirer]]\n* [[Drew Bledsoe]]\n* [[Rob Moore (American football)|Rob Moore]]\n* [[Ki-Jana Carter]]\n* [[Herman Moore]]\n* [[Art Monk]]\n* [[Troy Aikman]]\n* [[Katarina Witt]]\n* [[Dean Biasucci]]\n* [[Warren Moon]]\n* [[Kerry Collins]]\n* [[Erica Sorgi]]\n* [[Dallas Malloy]]\n* [[Jim Irsay]]\n}}\n\n[[Cameron Crowe]] originally wrote the screenplay for [[Tom Hanks]].

Zellweger said of filming the famous \"hello\" line, \"Cameron had me say it a few different ways. It's so funny, because when I read it, I didn't get it\u2013I thought it was a typo somehow. I kept looking at it. It was the one thing in the script that I was looking at going, 'Is that right? Can that be right? How is that right?' I thought, 'Is there a better way to say that?
