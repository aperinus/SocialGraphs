It is based on ''[[The Stupids]]'', characters from a series of books written by [[Harry Allard]] and illustrated by [[James Marshall (author)|James Marshall]].\n\nThe film follows the fictional family, the Stupids, with a last name synonymous with their behavior. The story begins with patriarch Stanley Stupid believing \"sender\" from letters marked \"return to sender\" is a wicked man planning a conspiracy. Adding several misunderstandings, they unwittingly save the world from military chaos, while believing a fake story about a fictional man named Sender and his plot to confiscate everyone's mail and garbage.\n\n==Plot==\nStanley and Joan Stupid are convinced they are victims of a conspiracy that steals their garbage every week. In an attempt to uncover this, Stanley follows the garbage truck to the city dump, where he stumbles across Colonel Neidermeyer, who is selling contraband weaponry to a group of terrorists. He believes Stanley to be a secret agent who has uncovered their operation and orders him assassinated, and after several attempts on his life result in him unintentionally killing his would-be assassins, he narrowly escapes a car bomb and is presumed dead by Neidermeyer.\n\nMeanwhile, Stanley and Joan's children, Petunia and Buster, believe they have been kidnapped by a Chinese restaurant and go in search of them. They reunite with Joan, who explains her theory that the police have turned against them and are responsible for Stanley being missing.\n\nOnce the Stupids are reunited at home, Joan tells Petunia and Buster about Stanley's last job for the postal service where he discovered all the letters being marked \"return to sender\", but was fired before he could find out who \"Mr. Sender\" was. He tells his family about the conspiracy theory he has invented that combines all the ideas their overactive imaginations have created, including the \"Evil Mr. Sender\" plotting to steal all the mail and garbage from America and employing the police to kidnap anybody who discovers his scheme.  When they find local museum curator Charles Sender in the phone book they set off in pursuit, ultimately tracking him to a television studio where Stanley appears on a talk show and is spotted by Niedermeyer who has him kidnapped and brought to the army base.\n\nWhile being held hostage at the army base, Stanley overhears the address of the warehouse being used for the illegal arms deals. Following an escape, the Stupids go to the warehouse, where they expect to find Sender and the stolen mail. They confront Neidermeyer and his terrorist associates in a battle, resulting in some explosions that cause the police to investigate the warehouse. The associates are arrested but Neidermeyer escapes. Stanley offers what he perceives to be heroic advice about how Sender can repent his evil ways, but he takes them as road directions. The Stupids return home, only to find a vengeful Neidermeyer waiting for them, armed with a handgun. Luckily, just as he is about to kill them, Neidermeyer is knocked out from behind the front door by a deli deliveryman that Joan had called round earlier. In the end, the Stupids celebrate their success with an outdoor barbeque.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as Stanley Stupid\n* [[Jessica Lundy]] as Joan Stupid\n* [[Alex McKenna]] as Petunia Stupid\n* [[Bug Hall]] as Buster Stupid\n* [[Mark Metcalf]] as Colonel Neidermeyer{{efn|The name is a reference to his role in ''[[Animal House]]'', which Landis directed}}\n* [[Bob Keeshan]] as Charles Sender\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as Evil Mr. Sender\n* [[Matt Keeslar]] as Lieutenant Neal\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as Lloyd\n* [[David Ferry (actor)|David Ferry]] as Late night show host\n* [[Max Landis]] as Graffiti artist\n* George Chiang as Chinese Waiter #1\n\n;Celebrity [[Cameo appearance|cameos]]\n* [[Rolonda Watts]] as Talk show hostess\n* [[Jenny McCarthy]] as Glamorous actress\n* [[Atom Egoyan]] as TV studio guard\n* [[Norman Jewison]] as TV director\n* [[Robert Wise]] as Stanley's neighbor\n* [[David Cronenberg]] as Postal supervisor\n* [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] as Talk show guest\n* [[Costa-Gavras]] as Gas station attendant\n* [[Gurinder Chadha]] as Reporter #1\n* [[Mick Garris]] as Reporter #2\n* [[Harvey Atkin]] as Deli Guy\n* [[Anthony J.
