It stars [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]], [[Rachael Leigh Cook]], [[Matthew Lillard]], and [[Paul Walker]]. After being dumped by his girlfriend, Zack Siler boasts he could make any girl at his high school popular. It is a modern adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' and [[George Cukor]]'s 1964 film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the lead actors' performances but were critical of the script. It was one of the most popular [[teen film]]s of the late 1990s and reached No. 1 at the box office in its first week of release. It went on to earn $103 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> After featuring in the film, the song \"[[Kiss Me (Sixpence None the Richer song)|Kiss Me]]\" reached No. 2 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and stayed in the Top 10 for 16 weeks. A gender-swapped remake, titled ''[[He's All That]]'', was released on August 27, 2021 by [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"Remake\" />\n\n== Plot ==\n\nZack Siler is the big man on campus at his [[Southern California]] high school. After returning from spring break, he finds out his girlfriend, Taylor, has cheated on him with a [[Reality television|reality TV]] star, Brock. After Zack and Taylor's breakup, Zack consoles himself by claiming that Taylor is replaceable with any girl in the school. Zack's friend Dean disagrees and bets Zack to turn any random girl from school into the prom queen in six weeks. Zack accepts, and Dean chooses Laney Boggs, an awkward and unpopular art student.\n\nZack attempts to befriend Laney, but she pointedly ignores his advances until he asks for her help with art. She reluctantly invites him to a small theater lounge where she will perform. Intending to deter him, Laney volunteers Zack to perform onstage. Zack manages to improvise a routine with his hacky sack. Laney is impressed but still rejects him when he attempts to charm her again.\n\nWhen Zack shows up at her house, Laney reluctantly agrees to go to the beach with him and his friends, and they invite her to a [[party]] later. Laney says she's busy, but Zack persuades her to go. He enlists his sister, Mack, to give her a [[makeover]]. At the party, Taylor, who is embarrassed by Brock and jealous of Laney, publicly humiliates Laney and brings her to tears.\n\nLaney is surprised to be nominated for prom queen, along with Taylor. Zack then goes by Laney's house and asks about her mother, who died when Laney was young, and talks about his father, who is pressuring him to go to Dartmouth for [[college]]. Zack leans in to kiss Laney but pulls back when she jokes that it's just to get her vote for prom king. \n\nThe next day, Zack defends Laney's brother, Simon, from bullies in the cafeteria. After a falling out with Zack, Dean asks Laney to be his [[prom]] date. Taylor is humiliated when Brock dumps her, so she cozies up to Zack. When Zack turns her down, she tells him that Dean has already asked Laney to the prom. When Zack confronts him, Dean reveals the bet, forcing a public confession from Zack. A furious Laney rushes from the room, refusing to speak to Zack.\n\nUnable to reconcile with Laney, Zack takes his sister to the prom. After some persuading from her father, a disheartened Laney agrees to go with Dean. At the dance, Dean boasts of his plan to seduce Laney. Laney's friend Jesse overhears, and he and Mack rush to warn Zack, who has taken the stage with Taylor as Prom King and Queen. Zack rushes after Laney, who's already left with Dean.\n\nLaney returns home to find Zack  there. Laney explains how she avoided Dean's advances. Zack confesses his true feelings, and they share a dance and kiss by the pool. When Laney asks Zack about the bet, Zack says he will honor the terms, which entail appearing [[Nudity|nude]] at the [[Graduation|graduation ceremony]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as Zachary \"Zack\" Siler\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Laney Boggs\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Brock Hudson\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Dean Sampson, Jr.\n* [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] as Taylor Vaughan\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Wayne Boggs\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Simon Boggs\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Jesse Jackson\n* [[Usher (musician)|Usher Raymond]] as Campus D.J.\n* [[Lil' Kim|Kimberly \"Lil' Kim\" Jones]] as Alex Chason Sawyer\n* [[Debbi Morgan]] as Ms. Rousseau\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Harlan Siler\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Mackenzie \"Mack\" Siler\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Katarina \"Katie\" Darlingson\n* [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]] as Preston\n* [[Tamara Mello]] as Chandler\n* Ashlee Levitch as Melissa\n* [[Vanessa Lee Chester]] as Melissa's Friend\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Misty\n* Katharine Towne as Savannah\n* [[Flex Alexander]] as Kadeem\n* [[Patricia Charbonneau]] as Lois Siler\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as Mitch\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Soccer Player\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as JV Cleaning Boy\n* [[Takbir Bashir]] as \"''She's All That''\" Rapper\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Girl in Cafeteria (''uncredited'')<ref name=\"Greco\" /><ref name=\"Macatee\" />{{efn|Named in the credits under ''The Producers Wish To Thank'', subsection ''They're All That''.}}\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Derek Funkhouser Rutley\n* Dave Buzzotta as Jeffrey Munge Rylander\n* [[Carlos Jacott]] as Prom Photographer\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Principal Stickley\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Casting ===\n{{Anchor|Casting}}\nThe film had an ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors, including [[Kieran Culkin]], [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] winner [[Anna Paquin]], [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]], musician [[Usher (musician)|Usher Raymond]], [[Gabrielle Union]] in her film debut, [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]], and [[Lil' Kim]].<ref name=\"Macatee\" /><ref>{{cite web |date= January 29, 2019 |last= Kupfer |first= Lindsey |title= 'She's All That' mean girl reflects on the movie 20 years later |url= https://pagesix.com/2019/01/29/jodi-lyn-okeefe-reflects-on-shes-all-that-20-years-later/ |website=Page Six }}</ref><ref name=\"glamour\">{{cite web |last=Harman |first=Justine |date=February 1, 2018 |title=Jaime Pressly, Rachael Leigh Cook, and More '90s Icons Look Back on the Genre They Invented |url=https://www.glamour.com/story/jaime-pressly-rachael-leigh-cook-and-90s-teen-stars-on-the-genre-they-invented |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201150214/https://www.glamour.com/story/jaime-pressly-rachael-leigh-cook-and-90s-teen-stars-on-the-genre-they-invented |archive-date=February 1, 2018 |website=Glamour |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast}}</ref> Producer [[Richard N.

The falafel restaurant hat was created on short notice with items picked up from a [[The Michaels Companies|Michaels]] craft store.
