Bruce Humberstone]] and starring [[Vera-Ellen]], [[David Niven]], and [[Cesar Romero]]. The film was made and first released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and distributed in the US by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] in 1952.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen chorus girl Janet Jones is late for rehearsal in [[Edinburgh]], Bates, the chauffeur for B. G. Bruno, gives her a ride in Bruno's limousine, starting rumours that she is engaged to the wealthiest man in Scotland. American producer John Frost, her employer, has just had the star of his next show, ''Frolics to You'', walk out on him because of his desperate financial situation. He replaces her with Janet, hoping that Bruno will back his revue, or at least that he can use Bruno's reputation to fend off impatient creditors. Her dressmaker, Madame Amanda, gives her more clothes, and sends the bill to Bruno. Janet's roommate, Mae Thompson, convinces her to continue the deception.\n\nWhen Bruno receives the bill, he goes to the theatre to investigate. Janet mistakes him for reporter Paul Tracy, who was supposed to interview her. Finding Janet very attractive, Bruno does not correct her error. The two fall in love. Bruno amuses himself by continually asking Janet about her relationship with the millionaire.\n\nFinally, Bruno gives Frost a cheque for \u00a310,000. When Janet finds out, however, she confesses everything. On the opening night of ''Frolics to You'', Bruno takes a box seat. Frost summons the police to have Bruno arrested as an impostor. In between performing on stage, Janet tries to make \"Paul Tracy\" hide or leave. During the hectic proceedings, Janet blurts out that she loves him. The police catch Bruno, but the inspector in charge recognizes him, much to the surprise of Janet and Frost, and all ends well.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Niven]] as B.G.
