The story is based on a version of [[White Lady (ghost)|The Lady in White]] legend, concerning a woman who supposedly searches for her daughter in Durand-Eastman Park in [[Rochester, New York]], from where the director hails.\n\nDespite positive reviews from critics, the film was a [[box office bomb]]. It later earned status as a [[cult film]].<ref>[https://www.popmatters.com/lady-killer-exploring-coming-of-age-through-horror-in-lady-in-white-2495399321.html Lady-Killer: Exploring Coming-of-Age Through Horror in 'Lady in White'|PopMatters]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Halloween]] 1962, nine-year-old Frankie Scarlatti is locked inside his classroom [[cloakroom|coatroom]] by schoolmates Donald and Louie at the end of the day. Trapped well after dark, he witnesses the [[ghost|apparition]] of a young girl being murdered in the coatroom, though her assailant is invisible. Moments later, a man enters the coatroom and attempts to open a vent grate on the floor, but notices Frankie. He [[strangulation|strangles]] him to unconsciousness. In a near-death vision, Frankie again sees the girl, who asks for his help to find her mother. Frankie is revived by his father, Angelo, and rushed to the hospital. Frankie was unable to see his attacker's face. The school janitor, Harold \"Willy\" Williams, found drunk in his office, is arrested as he was on school grounds at the time of the assault.\n\nAs Frankie recovers at home, his brother, Geno, shows him a newspaper article about the attack. He learns it is linked to eleven killings, all apparently by a [[serial killer]] targeting children. The ghostly girl is Melissa Ann Montgomery, and she continues to appear to Frankie. They form a tenuous friendship. Striving to help Melissa, Frankie returns to the coatroom and removes the cover of the net to discover several dust-laden objects, including toys, a hair clip, and a high school class ring. Later, he overhears the chief of police telling Angelo that the case against the janitor is crumbling and that the coatroom is also the scene of Melissa's murder. After considering this new information, Frankie confides in Phil, a family friend, that the class ring likely belongs to the killer and that he thinks the killer returned to the coatroom to retrieve it as the school's heating system was being replaced. Unbeknownst to Frankie, the ring, which had accidentally fallen out of his pocket earlier, was found by Geno and hidden away again.\n\nLater, Donald and Louie lure Frankie out to the nearby cliffs, where they encounter a ghostly lady dressed in white. All three boys take off running and Frankie collides into Geno in the surrounding woods. Frankie tries to explain the link between Melissa, the attacker and the lady in white, but is unsuccessful. One evening, Melissa appears to both Geno and Frankie. The town clock begins to chime and Frankie realizes that her nightly death re-enactment is about to commence. They follow her ghost to the school then wait until her lifeless body reappears, which is carried by an invisible figure from the school and onto the cliffs. At the last minute, Melissa awakes and begins screaming as she is thrown over the cliffs. A pale, blond woman dressed in white then comes out of the cottage. Upon seeing Melissa's lifeless body on the rocks below, she flings herself off the cliff and also plunges to her death. The ghostly scene ends and the brothers head home. Finally, Frankie understands the source of Melissa's anguish. He vows to help her bring her killer to justice.\n\nA [[grand jury]] fails to indict Willy due to insufficient evidence. Outside the courthouse, the distraught mother of one of the murdered children shoots and kills him. Researching the class ring, Geno examines one of Angelo's old yearbooks and realizes that he and the killer wore the same type of class rings. The yearbook reveals that the initials on the ring, \"MPT\", belong to Michael P. Terragrossa. Geno quickly deduces that the \"P\" stands for Phillip\u2014as in their family friend Phil\u2014and he rushes to tell his father. Frankie happens to be with Phil at that same time, and realizes Phil is the killer after he begins whistling \"[[Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?]]\", Melissa's song. Phil realizes that Frankie has deduced his secret and attacks him, but Frankie escapes and runs to the cliffs. Phil catches him and confesses to the murders just before he starts to strangle Frankie again. Suddenly, Phil is struck from behind and they both collapse to the ground.\n\nRegaining consciousness, Frankie finds himself in Melissa's old cottage with Amanda Harper, and learns that she was the one who saved him from Phil, and that she was the lady in white Frankie saw earlier when he was with Donald and Louie. Amanda reveals that she is Melissa's aunt and has been living in the cottage since the deaths of her sister and niece. Without warning, Phil attacks and kills Amanda, setting the building ablaze in the process. Pulling Frankie from the burning cottage, Phil attempts to throw him over the cliff. However, Frankie drops safely to the ground when the ghostly lady in white suddenly appears and frightens Phil, causing him to tumble over the cliff's edge. Melissa emerges from the burning cottage and the two ghosts happily reunite, ascending into the sky in a cascade of light. As Frankie crawls away from the ledge, Phil grabs his ankle. Angelo, Geno, and the police arrive and save Frankie. Angelo also tries to save Phil, but overcome with shame, Phil lets go and falls to his death. Everyone watches the cottage burn to the ground as the snow begins to fall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n*[[Lukas Haas]] as Franklin J. \"Frankie\" Scarlatti\n*[[Len Cariou]] as Michael Phillip \"Phil\" Terragrossa\n*[[Alex Rocco]] as Angelo Rodolfo Scarlatti\n*[[Katherine Helmond]] as Amanda Harper\n*[[Jason Presson]] as Geno Scarlatti\n*Henry Harris as Harold \"Willy\" Williams\n*[[Renata Vanni]] as Mama Assunta\n*Angelo Bertolini as Papa Charlie\n*Joelle Jacobi as Melissa Anne Montgomery\n*[[Jared Rushton]] as Donald\n*Gregory Levinson as Louie\n*Karen Powell as Anne Montgomery (Melissa's mother/\"Lady in White\")\n}}\n\n==Production==\nLaLoggia partly based the screenplay of the film on [[White Lady (ghost)|The Lady in White]] legend, regarding a woman who supposedly searches for her lost daughter in Durand-Eastman Park in [[Rochester, New York]], LaLoggia's hometown.<ref name=dem>{{cite web|work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/movie/2016/10/05/jack-garner-lady-in-white/91488352/|title=Jack Garner: 'Lady in White' based on local legend|date=October 5, 2016|last=Garner|first=Jack|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190621082558/https://eu.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/movie/2016/10/05/jack-garner-lady-in-white/91488352/|archive-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n;Financing\n\nThe film was entirely financed ($4.7 million) through a penny stock offering. New Sky Communications, a public company set-up by Frank LaLoggia and his cousin Charles M. LaLoggia, traded initially on NASDAQ for 10 cents a share. It was the first and only occasion that a single, feature film was financed in this manner.\n\n\u201c'Charlie came to me and said \u2018Look, we may be able to do this again (raise money independently) if we go public.\u2019 He said that there was a possibility we could structure a penny stock offering to raise the money to make another film,\u201d Frank told HalloweenLove. \u201cIt took us quite a while to structure this public entity called New Sky Communications. We had a number of brokers around the country selling stock for \"Lady\" and it took us about three years, from beginning to end, to bring Lady in White to fruition.'\u201d\n\nWhile Charles led the fundraising effort on the East Coast, Frank did the same in Los Angeles. There, he secured commitments from Lukas Haas (Witness), [[Tony Award]] winner Len Cariou, and his friend Katherine Helmond, best known as Mona on ''Who\u2019s the Boss'' one of America\u2019s 10 most-watched TV shows at the time. In fact, Helmond pitched in a little of her own money to the fund-raising.\nAcross all of their fundraising efforts, Frank and Charles raised $4.7 million, and they endeavored to use the money wisely \u2013 meticulously storyboarding every scene prior to the 15-week production, forgoing a standard practice like a completion bond insuring against budget overages...\nThe cousins managed to recoup every penny of their negative costs before the film had even hit theaters. They sold the foreign rights to Samuel Goldwyn Productions for a $1,000,000 advance and 70% of all foreign sales bringing their foreign earnings to over 2.7 million.  Home video rights went to Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Vision for $2,000,000, and New Century Vista picked up U.S. theatrical while guaranteeing a $1,000,000 spend to open the picture.<ref>We Minored in Film, Kelly Konda</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nThe film had a budget of $4.7 million<ref name=cf>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|page=19|title=The Lady in White|last=Jongeward|first=Steven|year=1987|publisher=F.S.
