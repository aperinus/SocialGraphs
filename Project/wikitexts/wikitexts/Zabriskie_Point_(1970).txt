It was widely noted at the time for its setting in the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] of the United States. Some of the film's scenes were shot on location at [[Zabriskie Point]] in [[Death Valley]]. The film was an overwhelming commercial failure,<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith, Matt.

Mark ([[Mark Frechette]]) leaves the meeting after saying he is \"willing to die, but not of boredom\" for the cause, which draws criticism from the young white radicals. Following a mass arrest at the campus protest, Mark visits a police station hoping to bail his roommate out of jail. He is told to wait but goes to the lock-up area, asks further about bail for his roommate, is rebuffed, calls out to the arrested students and faculty and is arrested. He gives his name as [[Karl Marx]], which a duty officer types as \"Carl Marx\". After he is released from jail, Mark and another friend buy firearms from a Los Angeles gun shop, saying they need them for \"self-defense\" to \"protect our women.\"\n\nIn a downtown Los Angeles office building, successful real estate executive Lee Allen ([[Rod Taylor]]) reviews a television commercial for Sunny Dunes, a new resort-like real estate development in the desert. Instead of actors or models, the slickly produced commercial features casually dressed, smiling mannequins. In the next scene Allen talks with his associate ([[G.D. Spradlin]]) about the greater Los Angeles area's very rapid growth as the two drive through crowded streets.\n\nMark goes to a bloody campus confrontation between students and police. Some students are tear-gassed and at least one is shot. As Mark reaches for a gun in his boot, a Los Angeles policeman is seen being fatally shot, although it is unclear by whom.<ref name=\"nyt\">[[Vincent Canby|Canby, Vincent]].

She finds the young boys near a roadhouse in the Mojave desert, but they tease, taunt, and grab at her, boldly asking for \"a piece of ass,\u201d to which she asks in reply, \"Are you sure you'd know what to do with it?\"\n\nDaria flees in her car. While filling its radiator with water, she is spied from the air by Mark, who buzzes her car and then flies only 15 feet over her as she lies face down in the sand. He throws a T-shirt out of the window of the aircraft for her to pick up. Daria goes from upset to curious and smiling during this sequence.\n\nThey later meet at the desert shack of an old man, where Mark asks her for a lift so he can buy gasoline for the aircraft. The two then wander to [[Zabriskie Point]], where they make love. As they begin, other unidentified young naked people are shown playing sexually on the ground, their wild games sending up thick clouds of white dust from the desert floor.{{#tag:ref| The music is performed by [[The Open Theater]].<ref name=\"moviecrazed.com\">''[http://www.moviecrazed.com/outpast/antonioni.html Out of the past.\"] ''moviecrazed.com''.

Hidden behind a portable toilet meant for tourists, Mark takes aim at the policeman, but Daria stands between the two of them to block this, apparently saving the policeman's life before he drives away. Daria asks Mark if he was the one who killed the cop in Los Angeles. He states that he wanted to, but someone else shot the officer first and that he \"never got off a shot\".\n\nReturning to the stolen aircraft, they paint it with politically charged slogans and psychedelic colors. Daria pleads with Mark to travel with her and leave the aircraft, but Mark is intent on returning and taking the risks that it involves. He flies back to Los Angeles and lands the plane at the airport in Hawthorne. The police (along with some radio and television reporters) are waiting for him, and patrol cars chase the aircraft down the runway. Instead of stopping, Mark tries to turn the taxiing aircraft around across the grass and is shot dead by one of the policemen.\n\nDaria learns about Mark's death on the car radio. She drives to Lee's lavish desert home, \"a desert [[Berghof (Hitler)|Berchtesgaden]]\"<ref name=\"nyt\" /> set high on a rock outcropping near Phoenix, Arizona, where she sees three affluent women sunning themselves and chatting by the swimming pool. She grieves for Mark by drenching herself in the house's architectural waterfall. Lee is deeply immersed in a business meeting having to do with the complex and financially risky Sunny Dunes development. Taking a break, he spots Daria in the house and happily greets her. She goes downstairs alone and finds the guest room that has been set aside for her, but after briefly opening the door, she shuts it again.\n\nSeeing a young Native American housekeeper in the hallway, Daria leaves silently. She drives off, but stops to get out of the car and look back at the house, her own imagination seeing it repeatedly blown apart in billows of orange flame and household items.{{#tag:ref| The scene has been described as a metaphor for her sadness and anger.<ref name=\"nyt\" />|group=Note}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Frechette]] as Mark\n* [[Daria Halprin]] as Daria\n* [[Rod Taylor]] as Lee Allen\n* [[Paul Fix]] as Roadhouse owner\n* [[G.D.

Antonioni took this as a thread, with which he could tie together the plot of his next film. After writing many drafts, he hired playwright [[Sam Shepard]] to write the script. Shepard, Antonioni, Italian filmmaker Franco Rossetti, Antonioni's frequent collaborator screenwriter Tonino Guerra and Clare Peploe (later to become the wife of [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]), worked on the screenplay.\n===Casting===\nThe lead roles went to two non-professional actors, [[Mark Frechette]] and [[Daria Halprin]]. Most of the supporting roles were played by a professional cast, including, notably, [[Rod Taylor]],<ref>Vagg 2010,  p. 144.</ref> along with [[G. D. Spradlin]], in one of his early feature film roles, following many appearances on U.S. national television. [[Paul Fix]], a friend and acting coach of [[John Wayne]] who had appeared in many of Wayne's films, played the owner of a roadhouse in the [[Mojave desert]]. [[Kathleen Cleaver]], a member of the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and wife of [[Eldridge Cleaver]], appeared in the documentary-like student meeting scene at the opening of the film.\n===Filming===\nShooting began in July 1968 in Los Angeles, much of it on location in the wider southern downtown area. Exteriors of the art deco [[Richfield Tower]] were shown in a few scenes shot shortly before its demolition in November of that year. Various college campus scenes, excluding the scene of the student meeting, were filmed on location at [[Contra Costa Community College]] in [[San Pablo, California]]. The production then moved to location shooting at [[Carefree, Arizona]], near Phoenix and from there to Death Valley.<ref name=\"making\">[http://chainedandperfumed.wordpress.com/category/zabriskie-point/ \"Making Zabriskie Point.\"] ''chainedandperfumed.wordpress.com'', November 17, 2009.
