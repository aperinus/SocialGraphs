Graham]]. It is the sixth installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' franchise]] and the last one to feature [[Tommy Jarvis]] (Mathews) as the [[protagonist]]. Continuing on from the events of ''[[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning]]'', the plot follows Tommy after he accidentally resurrects mass murderer [[Jason Voorhees]] (Graham) while attempting to destroy his body to ensure he will not return. While Jason returns to Crystal Lake for another killing spree, Tommy must overcome his fear of the masked killer that has haunted him for years, and find a way to stop him once and for all.\n\nThe original storyline had Tommy Jarvis become the series' new antagonist, but after the poor fan reception of ''A New Beginning'', the producers instead brought Jason Voorhees back.<ref name = \"ZitoInterview\">{{cite web|url = http://www.pitofhorror.com/main/zito.html|title = Joseph Zito Interviewed by Royce Freeman|publisher = Pit of Horror|access-date = 2009-08-14|archive-url = https://archive.today/20130111080111/http://www.pitofhorror.com/main/zito.html|archive-date = 2013-01-11|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Bracke|first = Peter|title = Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th|publisher = Titan Books|date = 2006-10-11|pages = 146\u2013148|isbn = 1-84576-343-2}}</ref> In resurrecting Jason, McLoughlin made him an explicitly [[supernatural]] force for the first time in the series. This version of Jason, an [[undead]] and more powerful [[superhuman]], would become the standard depiction for the rest of the series.

The film was followed by ''[[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood]]'' in 1988.\n\n==Plot==\nSome time after [[Friday the 13th: A New Beginning|the events of the last film]], [[Tommy Jarvis]] is released from the [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]], despite still having hallucinations of the mass murderer [[Jason Voorhees]]\u2014whom he killed in [[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter|part 4]]. He returns to Crystal Lake, now renamed Forest Green, to confront his fears, alongside his friend Allen Hawes. The pair visit Jason's grave during a thunderstorm, hoping to cremate the killer's body and finally end Tommy's nightmares. After digging up Jason's corpse, Tommy experiences flashbacks of his last encounter with Jason and furiously impales his body with a metal fence post, just as two lightning bolts strike the post, causing Jason to come back to life as an immortal [[revenant]]. Jason proceeds to kill Hawes and don his hockey mask, which Tommy brought with him. Tommy flees to the sheriff's office to warn the police of Jason's return, only to be arrested and jailed. His warning of Jason's return goes unheeded by Sheriff Mike Garris, who is aware of Tommy's institutionalization and thinks he is hallucinating Jason's return. On the road, camp counselors Darren Robinson and Lizabeth Mott get lost looking for the Camp Forest Green and are stopped by Jason, who murders them both.\n\nThe following morning, Garris' daughter Megan and her friends Sissy Baker, Cort Andrews, and Paula Mott arrive at the police station to report Darren and Lizabeth missing. Tommy warns them about Jason, but as he is now considered an [[urban legend]], they ignore the warnings, though Megan grows attracted to him. In the woods, Jason happens upon a corporate [[paintball]] game; he kills all five members (three members via decapitation, crushed the first member's face into a tree and dismembered the fifth member). Then he steals a machete from them, in the process discovering that he now possesses [[superhuman strength]] as a result of his resurrection.\n\nAt Camp Forest Green, children arrive, and the teens do their best to run the camp without Darren and Lizabeth. Meanwhile, Garris decides to escort Tommy out of his jurisdiction due to his influence on Megan. On the way, Tommy tries to make a run for Jason's grave but finds that the caretaker had covered it up to deny responsibility for it being dug up, and Hawes' body is buried in its place. Tommy is then handcuffed and escorted out of town by Garris, who warns him to never return. That night, Jason murders the caretaker and a nearby couple who witness the murder. Meanwhile, Cort goes out to have sex with a girl named Nicola Parsley, but Jason kills them both. The sheriff's men find the victims' bodies and Garris immediately implicates Tommy in the murders, believing he has gone insane imagining Jason.\n\nTommy contacts Megan and convinces her to help him lure Jason back to Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Jason makes his way to the camp and kills both Sissy and Paula, but refrains from harming the children. Meanwhile, Tommy and Megan are pulled over by Garris. Despite Megan's alibi that she was with Tommy, he does not believe him to be innocent and arrests him, and then goes to the camp to investigate. As Tommy and Megan develop a ruse to trick Deputy Rick and escape, Jason kills Garris and two other deputies when they arrive at the camp.\n\nJason is about to kill Megan when Tommy calls to him from the lake; apparently remembering his killer, Jason goes after Tommy instead. Tommy is attacked in a boat in the middle of the lake and ties a boulder around Jason's neck to trap him. Jason fights back, holding Tommy underwater long enough to seemingly drown him. Megan rushes out to save him but is nearly killed when Jason grabs her leg; she turns the boat's activated motor around onto Jason's neck, and he releases her. She takes Tommy back to shore and uses [[CPR]] to revive him. Tommy says that it is finally over and that Jason is home. Under the water, Jason is shown to be still alive, albeit anchored to the bottom of the lake, waiting for [[Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood|another opportunity to return]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Friday the 13th characters}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Thom Mathews]] as [[Tommy Jarvis]]\n* [[Jennifer Cooke]] as [[List of Friday the 13th characters#Megan Garris|Megan Garris]]\n* [[C.J.

In order to prevent further alienating the fans (and thus potentially endangering the series), the producers decided to take the series in a new direction, moving it away from what producer Frank Mancuso Jr. called the \"coarse\" nature of ''A New Beginning''.<ref>{{cite book|last = Bracke|first = Peter|title = Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th|publisher = Titan Books|date = 2006-10-11|pages = 148\u2013149|isbn = 1-84576-343-2}}</ref>\n\nTo this end, Mancuso hired Tom McLoughlin, who had directed the successful horror film ''[[One Dark Night]]'' but was also known around Hollywood for shopping around various comedy scripts he had written, a dichotomy that appealed to Mancuso. McLoughlin was given free rein on how he would present the story, with the only condition being that he bring back Jason and make him the film's villain.<ref>{{cite web |title=#5 - 35th Anniversary of Jason Lives w/ CJ Graham & Tom McLoughlin |url=https://open.spotify.com/episode/7BdYXMij2It448KfmNR01E?si=SMEZwWEDRFOhvwTdZDEtQg |website=High On Horror |publisher=High On Horror |access-date=15 October 2022 |language=en |date=26 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Bracke|first = Peter|title = Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th|publisher = Titan Books|date = 2006-10-11|page = 148|isbn = 1-84576-343-2}}</ref>\n\nMcLoughlin decided to take the film in the direction of an old [[Universal Monsters]] movie, specifically the 1931 version of ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', which portrayed the monster as a lumbering killer brought to life by electricity. McLoughlin also drew from [[vampire]] lore in order to give Jason a weakness, namely being returned to his \"home soil\"; to achieve this, McLoughlin disregarded the idea presented in ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2|Part 2]]'' that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting the idea that Jason has always been some sort of supernatural force.<ref name=\"Commentary\">Jason Lives Director's Commentary</ref> He also decided to [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] the ending of the fifth film, where Tommy Jarvis was a serial killer. In fact, Pam's truck from the fifth film can be seen indicating she is alive. In the \"Tommy Tapes\" for ''[[Friday the 13th: The Game]]'' (2017) written by [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]], it's explained that the ending of the fifth film was Tommy's dream.<ref>{{cite AV media |url-status = dead| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9txxxBO1RIo |title = YouTube, a Google company |website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nMcLoughlin further decided to expand the series' thematic scope, incorporating [[action film]] elements and [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] [[Meta-joke|metahumor]]; when Jason is first encountered in the woods near Crystal Lake, the character Lizbeth comments that she and Darren should flee because she knows about proper conduct to survive a horror film. McLoughlin would further satirize the series itself, as Martin the gravedigger comments on Jason's exhumation, \"Why'd they have to go and dig up Jason?\" before breaking the fourth wall and addressing the camera with the observation, \"Some folks sure got a strange idea of entertainment.\" In addition to ''Frankenstein'', McLoughlin also cited as inspiration his love of Gothic horror, particularly the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and his [[Catholic]] upbringing; ''Jason Lives'' features the series' only explicit references to [[God]], and during the climax a praying girl is spared by Jason (a similar scene, in which the same girl prays for Tommy while Megan performs CPR, then mouths \"Thank you\" while looking skyward was deleted from the final cut of the movie, apparently against McLoughlin's wishes; he recalled in the 2009 DVD's director's commentary, \"Somehow it didn't stay in... probably too much sentiment\").<ref>{{cite book|last = Bracke|first = Peter|title = Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th|publisher = Titan Books|date = 2006-10-11|page = 149|isbn = 1-84576-343-2}}</ref><ref>[https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/37576/friday-the-13th-part-vi-jason-lives-deluxe-edition/ DVD Talk: Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe decision to retcon the events of ''Part V'' resulted in many members of that film's cast\u2014whose characters had survived\u2014having their contracts to return for a sequel terminated. At one point in time when ''Jason Lives'' was being considered as a direct sequel to ''A New Beginning'' rather than to ''The Final Chapter'', the surviving characters Pam and Reggie from ''A New Beginning'' were to have died in the film's opening moments.<ref name=\"Bracke 151\">{{cite book|last = Bracke|first = Peter|title = Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th|publisher = Titan Books|date = 2006-10-11|page = 151|isbn = 1-84576-343-2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Mancuso retained control over the film's casting, he deferred to McLoughlin's judgment; the only caveat was that the [[final girl]] had to be a \"very attractive blonde\".<ref name=\"Bracke 151\"/> To fulfill this requirement, McLoughlin chose Jennifer Cooke, based on her performance in the television series ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]''. The role of Hawes, Tommy's would-be sidekick who dies within the first five minutes of the movie, was given to another television veteran, [[Ron Palillo]], famous for the role of Horshack on ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]''.\n\n[[John Shepherd (actor)|John Shepherd]] was asked to reprise his role as Tommy Jarvis from the previous film. Shepherd, an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] who had reservations about returning to the series based on the atmosphere surrounding ''A New Beginning'', was attracted to ''Jason Lives'' based on the scene in which a praying girl is spared by Jason. He ultimately decided to film ''Caught'' and shortly thereafter retired from acting to go to [[seminary]]. [[Thom Matthews]], who would take over the mantel of Tommy Jarvis, was chosen for his work in the horror comedy ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]'', although McLoughlin himself was unaware of Matthews' horror credentials until after shooting began.<ref name=Commentary/> Other cast members were actors who McLoughlin had directed before (such as David Kagen, who was also an acting teacher for female lead Jennifer Cooke) and McLoughlin's own family\u2014Jason's first female victim in the film, Lizbeth, was played by McLoughlin's wife, Nancy. In keeping with the series' tradition, the role of Jason was given to a stuntman, Dan Bradley. Bradley, however, was replaced shortly thereafter by C. J. Graham. Bradley's involvement during the paintball scene is kept.\n\n===Filming===\nAfter the first day of filming, Mancuso decided that he disliked Bradley's appearance onscreen as Jason. Although the scenes that Bradley filmed\u2014in which Jason kills the paintball playing executives\u2014were kept in the completed picture, the rest of Jason's scenes were performed by [[C. J. Graham]], an area restaurant manager and former soldier. As part of a stage show put on at the restaurant, a magician would hypnotize audience members and place them in a scenario during which they encountered Jason Voorhees; Graham, who stood 6'3 and weighed 250&nbsp;lbs, was asked to play Jason for the scenario. ''Jason Lives''{{'}} special effects coordinator, Martin Becker, was in the audience for one such show, and recommended Graham to Mancuso and McLoughlin. Both men were impressed with Graham's presence, and he was hired to film the remainder of Jason's scenes.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\n''Jason Lives'' is the only film in the franchise to contain no nudity; the characters in the film's sole sex scene are both fully clothed, a conscious move on McLoughlin's part to distance the ''Friday the 13th'' films from their perception as morality tales in which premarital sex is punished by death. McLoughlin was pressured by the film's producers to have Darcy Demoss remove her shirt during the RV sex scene, but he only suggested the idea to Demoss, who refused.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\n''Jason Lives'' was filmed in [[Covington, Georgia]], an area close to [[Atlanta]]. The scenes involving the police department and town were filmed in Covington, while the camp scenes were filmed at Camp Daniel Morgan outside the city limits of Covington. In the film, Camp Crystal Lake has been renamed Lake Forest Green. Surrounding Camp Daniel Morgan are [[Smokey the Bear]] signs asking everyone to \"Keep the Forests Green\".{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}\n\nSome of the climactic moments in the lake were actually filmed in the swimming pool of McLoughlin's father. McLoughlin ruined the pool's filter in the process (it was jammed by gore churned into the water when Jason is hit with the boat propeller).<ref name=Commentary/>\n\n===Post-production===\nMcLoughlin's attempt to deliver a \"different\" kind of ''Friday the 13th'' film were met with skepticism from the producers. In contrast to the series' other entries, which had to be edited for violence in order to avoid an \"X\" rating, the film's producers requested that McLoughlin add more gore, violence, and murders to the film. The original cut of the film contained 13 killings as an in-joke; in order to appease the studio, McLoughlin had to add an additional three killings, bringing the total up to 16.<ref name=Commentary/> These were the killings of Martin the gravedigger, and the recently engaged couple on a nighttime picnic. McLoughlin later said he felt the shot in which the picnicking man realizes that he's been spotted by Jason to be the film's scariest moment.<ref name=Commentary/>\n\nAdditionally, McLoughlin was made to extend Sissy's death, adding the shots of Jason dragging her to the ground and twisting her head off; as originally filmed, Sissy was simply pulled out of the cabin window, and wasn't seen again until Megan finds her head in the squad car.<ref name=Commentary/>\n\nMcLoughlin also found himself in contention with the producers over how the film should end. In the original script, the movie was supposed to have concluded in the graveyard, with Martin the gravedigger meeting Jason's father, Elias\u2014a heretofore unseen character in the series\u2014with the implication that Elias knows Jason has been resurrected and has come looking for him. The studio balked at the scene, as they did not want the responsibility of having to introduce Elias' backstory in the next installment. Additionally, the added murder of Martin made the scene a continuity error. This ending would have tied up a continuity error from ''A New Beginning'', when it is mentioned that Jason was cremated. A deleted scene from ''Jason Lives'' had Tommy asking Sheriff Garris why Jason wasn't cremated, as had been planned, at which point Garris informs him that someone paid the city to bury Jason; Elias' handing Martin a wad of money would have indicated that he was the man who paid for Jason's burial. The scene was later storyboarded for inclusion on the film's \"Deluxe Edition\" DVD release, with Bob Larkin reprising his role as Martin to provide voiceover. Elias, like Jason, was scripted to be completely silent.<ref name=Commentary/><ref>Meeting Mr. Voorhees. Special feature on Jason Lives DVD</ref>\n\nMcLoughlin ultimately shot three endings, two of which were not included on the film's DVD release. In one ending, Jason's mask floats to the surface of Crystal Lake, having become detached during his struggle with Megan. In another, Deputy Cologne tries to reach the jail cell keys after having been locked in by Tommy and Megan; the door to the police station opens and the film abruptly ends, indicating that Jason managed to get free. The producers disliked both of these endings, as each one left Jason's survival ambiguous, and wanted it explicitly shown onscreen that he was still capable of returning for a sequel. As a result, McLoughlin shot the film's used ending, showing a closeup of Jason's open, twitching eye.<ref name=Commentary/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Harry Manfredini]]\n| cover      = \n| alt        =\n| released   = January 13, 2012 (La-La Land)\n| recorded   = 1986\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]\n| length     = {{duration|h=1|s=12}}\n| label      = La-La Land\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe film's music was composed by [[Harry Manfredini]], who composed the scores to all of the series' previous installments.

However, he felt the bulk of the film, while an improvement over the previous two installments, suffered from tedious pacing and a lack of gore. He gave it two out of four stars, the same rating he gave to six out of the series' ten installments.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nusair |first=David |title=The Friday the 13th Series |url=https://reelfilm.com/fri13th.htm#6 |website=Reel Film Reviews |access-date=10 August 2020 |date=April 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Novelization===\nA novelization of ''Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives'' was written by [[Simon Hawke]] in 1986; notably, the novelization features an appearance by a Mr. Voorhees, Jason's father who was originally meant to appear in the film but was cut.
