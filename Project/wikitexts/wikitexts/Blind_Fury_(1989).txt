Parker decides to help the boy find his father, who has been kidnapped by a major [[crime syndicate]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile serving in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], American soldier Nick Parker was blinded by a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] explosion. Rescued by local villagers, he recovered his health and, though he remains blind, was trained to master his other senses and be an expert swordsman.\n\n20 years later, having returned to the United States, he visits old army buddy Frank Deveraux, only to find that Deveraux is missing. Parker meets Frank's son Billy and his mother Lynn, Frank's ex-wife. Minutes later, Frank's evil boss Claude MacCready's henchman Slag arrives with two corrupt police officers to kidnap Billy to use as leverage over Frank. Nick stops them; the officers are killed, Billy is knocked unconscious, but Slag mortally wounds Billy's mom before he escapes. With her last words, Lynn tells Nick to take Billy to his father in [[Reno, Nevada]].\n\nAt a rest stop on the way to Reno, Parker tells Billy about his mother's death. Billy runs away from Nick and is grabbed by Slag and some henchmen. Slag escapes as Nick rescues Billy a second time, and Billy and Nick (now called Uncle Nick) become fond of one another.\n\nThey reach Reno and find Frank's girlfriend Annie, who agrees to take them to Frank. After escaping yet another attempted kidnapping by MacCready's men, Annie suggests they hide out at the home of her friend Colleen. Annie takes Nick to MacCready's casino, where Frank is making MacCready's drugs. Annie returns to Colleen's to watch over Billy while Nick saves Frank. Nick and Frank are reunited; Frank takes the key ingredient in MacCready's drugs and destroys the lab. Avoiding casino security, Nick and Frank escape and head to Colleen's to reunite Billy with his dad; they find Colleen dead, Billy and Annie kidnapped, and a note instructing them to bring the drugs to MacCready's mountain penthouse in exchange for Billy and Annie.\n\nKnowing it is an ambush, Nick and Frank arm themselves with homemade napalm bombs. After killing all of MacCready's men, they find MacCready holding Billy and Annie at gunpoint. MacCready hired a Japanese assassin to kill Nick, but after an epic swordfight between the two, Nick wins by electrocuting the assassin in a hot tub. Slag shoots Nick in the shoulder and Nick throws his sword at Slag, impaling him. MacCready then tries to interfere only to be stopped by Frank. Billy escapes his rope and throws Nick's sword to him, but it lands in the hot tub. As Slag reaches for his gun, Nick grabs hold of the assassin's sword and slashes him, cutting him in half and causing him to fall out of a window.\n\nFrank is reunited with Billy and Annie, and they leave for San Francisco. Nick drops his ticket, choosing not to go. Billy follows Nick, telling him that he needs him. Nick says that while he is fond of Billy, he should go back to his father. Nick crosses the street and vanishes as a bus passes him. Saddened by Nick's departure, Billy throws a toy dinosaur off the bridge where Nick catches it. Billy calls out to Nick one last time and tells him that he'll miss him. As Frank catches up to Billy, they embrace. Nick smiles or sheds a tear, puts on his sunglasses while holding Billy's toy dinosaur with left arm in a sling, and walks off into the distance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as Nick Parker\n* [[Terry O'Quinn]] as Frank Deveraux\n* [[Brandon Call]] as Billy Deveraux\n* [[Noble Willingham]] as Claude MacCready\n* [[Lisa Blount]] as Annie Winchester\n* [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] as Slag\n* [[Nick Cassavetes]] as Lyle Pike\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Tector Pike\n* [[Meg Foster]] as Lynn Deveraux\n* [[Sho Kosugi|Sh\u014d Kosugi]] as The Assassin\n* [[Charles Cooper (actor)|Charles Cooper]] as Ed Cobb\n* Weasel Forshaw as Popcorn\n* Roy Morgan as Six Pack\n* Tim Mateer as Snow\n* Sharon Shackelford as Colleen\n* Woody Watson as Crooked Miami Cop\n* Alex Morris as Crooked Miami Cop\n* Mark Fickert as Bus Station Cop\n* [[Jay Pennison]] as Casino Bodyguard\n* [[Tiger Chung Lee]] as Casino Bodyguard\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Blind Fury'' marked the producing debut of actor [[Tim Matheson]].

In 1986, the producers landed a deal with film distributor [[Tri-Star Pictures]]. According to Grodnik, various writers and directors were attached to the project before Phillip Noyce was hired as the film's director.\n\nHauer calls ''Blind Fury'' one of his \"most difficult jobs\" because of the combination of swordplay with playing a blind man; and Hauer spent a month training with [[Lynn Manning]] whose first words to him were \"I don't get confused about what I see ...\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hauer|first=Rutger|title=Blind Fury|url=http://www.rutgerhauer.org/plots/blind.php|publisher=Rutger Hauer Official Website|access-date=April 21, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFilming took place around the [[Midwestern United States]], where the cast and crew underwent humid weather conditions. Of the intense weather conditions, Matheson stated, \"We shot in the Midwest and West, and it was incredibly hot. Everything was burning up. We ended up buying a three-foot pool for the cast and crew to wade through to cope with the heat.\"<ref name=\"Spokesman-Review\"/> After [[principal photography]] was completed, a sequel to the film was planned, but never materialized.<ref name=\"Spokesman-Review\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nOn their syndicated television program ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert and the Movies]]'', film critics [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film \"Two [[thumbs signal|thumbs up]]\".<ref name=\"Siskel and Ebert\">{{cite web|url = http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=1&subsec=310|title = At the Movies|date = March 16, 1990|access-date = June 12, 2010|work = [[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel and Ebert and the Movies]]|publisher = [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[American Broadcasting Company]]}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nReviewer Ian Jane of ''DVD Talk'' wrote, \"Hauer does a commendable job in the lead and is reasonably convincing as a blind man.
