The film stars [[Jason Statham]] as [[Frank Martin (Transporter)|Frank Martin]], a driver for hire&mdash;a mercenary \"transporter\" who will deliver anything, anywhere, no questions asked&mdash;for the right price. It also stars [[Shu Qi]] as Lai Kwai.\n\nIt is the first installment in the [[Transporter (franchise)|''Transporter'' franchise]], succeeded by three [[sequel]]s, ''[[Transporter 2]]'' and ''[[Transporter 3]]'', ''[[The Transporter Refueled]]'' (a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]), and a [[Transporter: The Series|television series]].\n\n== Plot ==\nFrank Martin is a former [[special operations]] soldier and now highly skilled driver/mercenary residing in southern [[France]] whose callsign is ''The Transporter''. He strictly follows three rigid rules when transporting:\n\n#Never change the deal.\n#No names.\n#Never open the package.\n\nIn [[Nice]], Frank is hired to transport three bank robbers with his black [[BMW 7 Series (E38)|BMW 735i]], but they hoist a fourth man in his car after the robbery. Explaining the extra weight will affect his precisely planned getaway, he refuses to drive until, in desperation, the leader kills one of his men who is pushed out of the car. Later they offer more money for Frank to drive them to [[Avignon]]. He refuses the deal. The robbers escape in another car, but are foiled by their amateur driving. At Frank's villa on the [[French Riviera]], local [[French Police|Police]] Inspector Tarconi questions Frank about the black BMW that fled the scene of the robbery which Frank was the getaway driver. \n\nLacking any real proof, Tarconi leaves. Frank is then hired to deliver a package of {{convert|50|kg|lb}} to an American, Darren \"Wall Street\" Bettencourt. The package is loaded into Frank's trunk. While changing a flat tire, Frank notices the package moving. Realizing a person is inside, he violates his third rule in order to give the person something to drink. He discovers a woman, tied up and gagged. She attempts to escape but Frank recaptures her and returns her to the trunk along with two policemen who spot them. Frank delivers the package to Wall Street as promised and agrees to another job, transporting a briefcase. As Frank stops to buy drinks for the cops in his trunk, a bomb hidden in the briefcase explodes. \n\nOut for vengeance, Frank returns to Wall Street's villa where he kills and wounds several henchmen. Frank then steals a car (a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse]]) to get away, only to find \"the package\" bound and gagged in the back seat. He brings the young woman, whose name is Lai, back to his house. Wall Street visits one of his surviving men in hospital in order to determine who attacked his residence, before killing the man after discovering that Frank is alive. The next day, Tarconi arrives and asks about Frank's car, which Frank claims was stolen. Lai supports Frank's alibi by introducing herself as his new cook and girlfriend. Tarconi again leaves with no concrete evidence. Shortly after, Wall Street's hitmen fire [[missiles]] and [[automatic weapons]] down on the house. \n\nFrank and Lai barely escape through an underwater passage to a nearby safe house. Later, while being questioned at the police station, Lai accesses Tarconi's computer to find information on Wall Street. Frank, presumed dead by Wall Street, wants to rebuild his villa and start a new life and advises Lai to do so too before she tells him that Wall Street is a [[human trafficking|human trafficker]] with 400 Chinese trapped in shipping containers,  including her family. Lai and Frank go to Wall Street's office, where Wall Street reveals that Lai's father, Mr. Kwai, is also a human trafficker and Wall Street's partner in crime. Kwai arrives and his henchmen subdue Frank. When Tarconi arrives, Kwai and Wall Street accuse Frank of kidnapping Lai. \n\nTarconi has Frank arrested and locked up in the station. Realizing that Frank would not be constrained by search warrants and that he would be able to solve the case faster than the police, Tarconi agrees to aid Frank's escape as his faux hostage and releases him at the harbour of [[Cassis]]. Frank then tracks the criminals to the docks in Marseille, where they load the containers onto trucks. However, Frank is spotted and forced to fight his way through the guards, and fails to stop the trucks. He then steals an old car and makes chase at dawn before it breaks down on a small country road. He then commandeers a small airplane from a farmer and follows the highway to the trucks where he parachutes onto one of them. \n\nAfter a lengthy fight, Frank manages to kill Wall Street by throwing him out of the moving truck where he is crushed by the wheels (in the American version, Wall Street is simply thrown out of the truck to be arrested), only to be ambushed by Kwai once he gets out of the truck where he is marched to a cliff edge. Frank is prepared to fight back until Lai reluctantly shoots her father. Afterwards, Tarconi arrives with the police, and they rescue the people trapped inside the two containers as he congratulates Frank on his work.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jason Statham]] as [[Frank Martin (Transporter)|Frank Martin]]\n* [[Shu Qi]] as Lai Kwai\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]] as Inspector Tarconi\n* [[Matt Schulze]] as Darren \"Wall Street\" Bettencourt\n* [[Ric Young]] as Mr. Kwai\n<!-- not opening title card billing\n* Didier Saint Melin as Boss\n* [[Adrian Dearnell]] as Newscaster\n-->\n\n== Releases ==\n\n=== Theatrical release ===\n''The Transporter'' premiered in 2,573 theaters.

The film was also released as a part of \"The Transporter Collection\", which featured the first two films in the series. A [[Blu-ray]] format was released on 14 November 2006.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Review aggregator|Review aggregation website]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 54% based on reviews from 127 critics and an average rating of 5.6 out of 10. The site's consensus reads: \"''The Transporter'' delivers the action at the expense of coherent storytelling.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/transporter/|title=The Transporter|access-date=29 October 2016|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 51 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Transporter|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-transporter|publisher=Metacritic|access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=2022-02-27 |website=[[CinemaScore]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Manohla Dargis]], of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', complimented the action, saying, \"[Statham] certainly seems equipped to develop into a mid-weight alternative to [[Vin Diesel]].

Frank breaks one of his own rules and opens the package. What follows is a high octane action movie. Slowly we learn about Frank\u2019s past and the skills that make him such a fantastic driver. Those skills put him in a unique position to rescue not only the package he was transporting but a cargo container full of people.\nBeautiful scenery, a clear hero, well-choreographed action sequences, and enough character development to keep you engaged, make The Transporter a great excuse for a bowl of popcorn.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.delafieldlibrary.org/the-transporter-2002/ | title=The Transporter (2002) | date=10 February 2017 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thetransportermovie.net Official Website]\n* {{IMDb title|0293662}}\n* {{Allmovie title|265929}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|transporter}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Related topic navboxes\n|state=collapsed\n|list1=\n{{Transporter series}}\n{{Louis Leterrier}}\n{{Corey Yuen}}\n{{Luc Besson}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transporter}}\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2002 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:2000s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:20th Century Fox films]]\n[[Category:2000s chase films]]\n[[Category:EuropaCorp films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stanley Clarke]]\n[[Category:Films about kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Films about automobiles]]\n[[Category:Films about human trafficking]]\n[[Category:Films about organized crime in France]]\n[[Category:French films about revenge]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Corey Yuen]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Louis Leterrier]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Luc Besson]]\n[[Category:Films set in France]]\n[[Category:Films set on the French Riviera]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Saint-Tropez]]\n[[Category:French action thriller films]]\n[[Category:Patricide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Luc Besson]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Mark Kamen]]\n[[Category:Transporter (franchise)]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:2002 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
