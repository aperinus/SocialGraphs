It is a collection of five [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]], taking place during the same night, concerning the temporary bond formed between taxi driver and passenger in five cities: [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]], and [[Helsinki]]. The action in the vignettes takes place at the same time, moving from Los Angeles in the United States to Helsinki, Finland.  The scene in each city appears to occur later and later in the night due to the changing time zones. Jarmusch wrote the screenplay in about eight days, and the choice of certain cities was largely based on the actors with whom he wanted to work.<ref>{{cite news | first=Geoff | last=Andrew | title=Jim Jarmusch interviewed by Geoff Andrew | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Guardian_NFT/interview/0,4479,110606,00.html | date=1999-11-15 | access-date=2008-05-02 | archive-date=2008-05-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516094437/http://film.guardian.co.uk/Guardian_NFT/interview/0,4479,110606,00.html | url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Night on Earth (soundtrack)|soundtrack of the same name]] is by [[Tom Waits]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Los Angeles===\nAs evening falls, tomboy cabby Corky picks up Hollywood executive Victoria Snelling from the airport, and as Corky drives, Victoria tries to conduct business on her phone. Despite their extreme differences socially, the two develop a certain connection. When Victoria suggests that cab driving is not much of a career, Corky counters that her dream in fact is to become a mechanic. During the ride, Victoria, who is a casting agent, comes to realise that Corky would be ideal for a part in a movie she is casting, but Corky rejects the offer because she intends to be a mechanic.\nThe taxi is a [[Chevrolet Caprice|1985 Chevrolet Caprice Classic Wagon]].\n\n===New York===\nHelmut, an immigrant from [[East Germany]] who was a clown in his home country, has found work as a taxi driver. After dark, he picks up a passenger named YoYo, a streetwise young man who wants to go to Brooklyn. Increasingly alarmed at Helmut's inability to handle an automatic transmission, ignorance of New York geography, and feeble command of the English language, YoYo takes over the wheel. During the drive, YoYo sees his sister-in-law Angela on the street and forces her into the cab to take her back home. Helmut is clearly amused by the vituperation between the two. After Angela and Yoyo depart, Helmut struggles to drive back to Manhattan, muttering \"New York...New York.\"\nThe taxi is a [[Ford LTD Crown Victoria|1983 Ford LTD Crown Victoria]].\n\n===Paris===\nAt night, a cab picks up two drunk African diplomats, who mock the lowly driver and find it hilarious that he is from the [[Ivory Coast]]. In French, when he says he is ''ivoirien'', they say ''il voit rien'' (he can't see a thing). Sick of their insults, he throws them out, forgetting to get money off them. Next he picks up an attractive young woman, who is blind. As she cannot see the colour of his skin, he asks her where she thinks he is from. After a moment's thought, she says ''the Ivory Coast''. Prickly and sexually provocative, she rejects most of his efforts to be friendly, regarding him as beneath her, but he is genuinely fascinated by her and her predicament. So much so that, after dropping her off, he watches her walk beside a canal in the dark and he drives into another car, whose driver angrily accuses him of being blind. The taxi is a [[Peugeot 504|1980 Peugeot 504]].\n\n===Rome===\nIn the early morning hours, an eccentric cabbie picks up a priest. As he drives, he starts to confess his sins. Much to the priest's discomfort, he goes into great detail about how he discovered his sexuality, first with a pumpkin and then with a sheep, then details a love affair he had with his brother's wife, miming the actions and mouthing the cries. Already ailing, overwhelmed by the barrage of unwanted information, the priest has a fatal heart attack. Unable to revive him, the cabbie leaves him on a bench to be found once it is light.\nThe taxi is a [[Fiat 128|1976 Fiat 128]].\n\n===Helsinki===\nAfter an evening spent drinking heavily, three workers, one of whom has just been fired from his job and has passed out, climb into a cab to return home. On the way, the two conscious workers talk about the terrible situation their unconscious friend is in, being out of work and having to face a divorce and a pregnant daughter. The driver, Mika, then tells them all the saddest story they have ever heard. The workers are terribly moved and depressed by the story, and even become unsympathetic toward their drunken, laid-off companion. Leaving him in the cab, they stagger off to their homes. Mika wakes him, takes payment and leaves. Worker sits on the ground, passing neighbours greet him and he replies back. The taxi is a [[Volvo 144|1973 Volvo 144]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n;Los Angeles\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Corky (taxi driver)\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Victoria Snelling (passenger)\n\n;New York\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as YoYo (passenger & taxi driver)\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Helmut Grokenberger (taxi driver & passenger)\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Angela (passenger)\n\n;Paris\n* [[Isaach De Bankol\u00e9]] as Unnamed Taxi Driver\n* [[B\u00e9atrice Dalle]] as the Blind Woman (passenger)\n* [[Emile Abossolo M'Bo]] & [[Pascal N'Zonzi]] as the African passengers\n\n;Rome\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Gino (taxi driver)\n* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as Priest (passenger)\n\n;Helsinki\n* [[Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4]] as Mika (taxi driver)\n* [[Kari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen]], [[Sakari Kuosmanen]], and Tomi Salmela as passengers\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively gave the film an approval rating of 76%, based on 25 reviews, and an average rating of 6.4/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/night_on_earth |title=Night on Earth (1991) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |access-date=October 27, 2022 |archive-date=November 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129084017/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/night_on_earth/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{div col|colwidth=48em}}\n*Back in the Good Old World - Written by Tom Waits and [[Kathleen Brennan]] - Arranged by Tom Waits and [[Francis Thumm]]\n*Good Old World - Written by Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan - rearranged by Tom Waits and Francis Thumm\n*Cycle-Delic - Performed by [[Davie Allan|Davie Allan and The Arrows]] (as Davie Allan & The Arrows)- Written by Davie Allan\n*Summertime Blues - Performed by [[Blue Cheer]] - Written by [[Eddie Cochran]] and [[Jerry Capehart]]<ref>{{cite book|last= Piazza|first= Sara|date= 2015|url= http://jimjarmusch-musicwordsandnoise.com/|title= Jim Jarmusch: Music, Words and Noise|location= UK|publisher= Reaktion Books|page= 388|isbn= 9781780234694|access-date= 2020-10-26|archive-date= 2021-07-28|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210728163405/http://jimjarmusch-musicwordsandnoise.com/|url-status= live}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=Bernd Wahlbrinck|title=Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth: The New York Episode| location=Germany | publisher=Tumbleweed|year=2011|isbn=978-3-00-035771-8}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0102536}}\n* {{Amg movie|35323}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|night_on_earth}}\n* {{mojo title|nightonearth}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/572-night-on-earth-paris-talk-the-talk ''Night on Earth: Paris\u2014Talk the Talk''] an essay by [[Bernard Eisenschitz]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Jim Jarmusch}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Night On Earth}}\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1991 comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American anthology films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1991 independent films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s Finnish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films set in Helsinki]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jim Jarmusch]]\n[[Category:Films about taxis]]\n[[Category:1991 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1991 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:American multilingual films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
