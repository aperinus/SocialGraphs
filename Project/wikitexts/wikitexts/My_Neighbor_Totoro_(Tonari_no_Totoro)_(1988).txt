Totoro also serves as the mascot for the studio and is recognized as one of the most popular characters in Japanese animation.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n\nIn 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively), move into an old house closer to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called [[susuwatari]], which can be seen when moving from bright to dark places.<ref group=note>Called \"black soots\" in early subtitles and \"soot sprites\" in the later English dubbed version.</ref> When the girls become comfortable in their new house, the susuwatari leave to find another empty house. One day, Mei discovers two small spirits who lead her into the hollow of a large [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". Mei thinks Totoro is the Troll from her illustrated book ''Three Billy Goats Gruff'', with her mispronouncing Troll. She falls asleep atop Totoro, but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her by telling her that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Expo 2005 of Satsuki and Mei\u2019s House 01.jpg\n| caption1 = {{ill|Satsuki and Mei's house|ja|\u30b5\u30c4\u30ad\u3068\u30e1\u30a4\u306e\u5bb6}} at the [[Expo 2005]] site.\n| image2 = Satsuki and Mei's House 01.JPG\n| caption2 = Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house\n| direction = vertical\n}}\n\nOne rainy night, the girls are waiting for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back, and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken for her father. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A [[Catbus|giant, bus-shaped cat]] halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it and leaves. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his colleagues engaged in a [[ceremonial dance]] around the planted seeds and join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying [[top]]. In the morning, the tree is gone, but the seeds have sprouted.\n\nThe girls discover that a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei does not take this well and argues with Satsuki, leaving for the hospital to bring fresh corn to Yasuko. Her disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the camphor tree and pleads for Totoro's help. He delightfully summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits, and the sisters emotionally reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital. The girls overhear a conversation between their parents and learn that she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it, and return home. Eventually, Yasuko returns home, and the sisters play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch them from afar.\n\n== Characters ==\nThe name ''Totoro'' comes from a misprononciation of the word {{Nihongo|[[troll]]|\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb|tor\u014dru}} by Mei. She has seen one in a book and decides that it must be the same creature.<ref name = NAUSICAA>[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/totoro/faq.html Tonari no Totoro - FAQ].</ref>\n\nThe cat-bus comes from a Japanese belief attributing to an old cat the power of shape-shifting: he then becomes a \u201c[[bakeneko]]\u201d. The cat-bus is a \u201cbakeneko\u201d who has seen a bus and decided to become one.<ref name=\"NAUSICAA\"/>\n\n== Themes ==\n[[Animism]] is a large theme in this film according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Ogihara-Schuck|first=Eriko|title=Miyazaki's Animism Abroad: The Reception of Japanese Religious Themes by American and German Audiences|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4766-1395-6|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=81\u201383}}</ref> Totoro has animistic traits and has [[kami]] status due to the fact that he lives in a [[camphor tree]] in a [[Shinto shrine]] surrounded by a [[Shinto rope]] and was referred to as \"''mori no nushi'',\" or \"master of the forest\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Moreover, Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro. This is a common practice in the [[Shinto]] tradition following an encounter with a kami.<ref name=\":1\" /> The themes of the film was additionally noted for Phillip E.

The director challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with ''My Neighbor Totoro'' jump-started the artist's career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the palette of the film, Oga seeking to paint black soil from [[Akita Prefecture]] and Miyazaki preferring the color of red soil from the [[Kant\u014d region]].<ref name=\"art\" />{{rp|82}} The ultimate product was described by [[Studio Ghibli]] producer Toshio Suzuki: \"It was nature painted with translucent colors.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Yoshiaki | last=Kikuchi | title=Totoro's set decorator | work=Daily Yomiuri | date=August 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOga's conscientious approach to ''My Neighbor Totoro'' was a style that the ''International Herald Tribune'' recognized as \"[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive\". The newspaper described the final product:\n{{blockquote|Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity.

However, due to his disappointment with the result of the heavily edited 95 minute English version of ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'', Miyazaki and Ghibli would not permit any part of the film to be edited out, all the names remained the same (with the exception being Catbus), the translation was as close to the original Japanese script as possible, and no part of the film could be changed for any reason, cultural or linguistic (which was very common at the time) despite creating problems with some English viewers, particularly in explaining the origin of the name \"Totoro\". It was produced by [[John Daly (producer)|John Daly]] and Derek Gibson, with co-producer [[Jerry Beck]]. In April 1993, [[Troma Entertainment|Troma Films]], under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film as a theatrical release, and was later released onto VHS by [[20th Century Studios Home Entertainment|Fox Video]].\n\nIn 2004, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] produced an all new English dub of the film to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of ''Totoro'' features a star-heavy cast, including [[Dakota Fanning|Dakota]] and [[Elle Fanning]] as Satsuki and Mei, [[Timothy Daly]] as Mr. Kusakabe, [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as Granny, [[Lea Salonga]] as Mrs. Kusakabe, and [[Frank Welker]] as Totoro and [[Catbus]]. The songs for the new dub retain the same translation as the previous dub, but are sung by [[Sonya Isaacs]].<ref>{{Citation|title=My Neighbor Totoro|url=https://movies.disney.com/my-neighbor-totoro|language=en|access-date=February 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206133629/http://movies.disney.com/my-neighbor-totoro|archive-date=February 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The songs for the Streamline version of ''Totoro'' are sung by Cassie Byram.<ref>{{Citation|title=From 'Mere' to 'Interesting' [Cassie's Corner]|url=http://www.oodlesworld.com/blog/?p=2400|language=en|access-date=June 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622060242/http://www.oodlesworld.com/blog/?p=2400|archive-date=June 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Disney's English-language dub premiered on October 23, 2005; it then appeared at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival. The [[Turner Classic Movies]] cable television network held the television premiere of Disney's new English dub on January 19, 2006, as part of the network's salute to Hayao Miyazaki. (TCM aired the dub as well as the original Japanese with English subtitles.) The Disney version was initially released on [[DVD]] in the United States on March 7, 2006, but is now out of print. This version of the film has since been used in all English-speaking regions and is one of the two versions most widely available, especially for streaming on Netflix and HBO Max.\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was released to [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] by [[Tokuma Shoten]] in August 1988 under their [[Animage|Animage Video]] label. [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan]] (now Walt Disney Japan) would later reissue the VHS on June 27, 1997 as part of their ''Ghibli ga Ippai'' series, and was later released to [[DVD]] on September 28, 2001, including both the original Japanese and the Streamline Pictures English dub. Disney would later release the film on [[Blu-ray]] in the country on July 18, 2012. The DVD was re-released on July 16, 2014, using the remastered print from the Blu-ray and having the Disney produced English dub instead of Streamline's.\n\nIn 1993, [[20th Century Studios Home Entertainment|Fox Video]] licensed the film from Studio Ghibli and released the Streamline Pictures dub of ''My Neighbor Totoro'' on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States and was later released to DVD in 2002. After the rights to the dub expired in 2004, [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] re-released the movie on DVD on March 7, 2006 with Disney's newly produced English dub and the original Japanese version. A reissue of ''Totoro'', ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'', and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' featuring updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on March 2, 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-ray debut of ''[[Ponyo]]'', and was subsequently released by Disney on [[Blu-ray|Blu-Ray Disc]] on May 21, 2013.
