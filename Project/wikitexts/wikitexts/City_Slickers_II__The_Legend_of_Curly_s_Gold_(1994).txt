It is the sequel to ''[[City Slickers]]'' (1991) and stars [[Billy Crystal]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Jon Lovitz]], and [[Jack Palance]]. Although a mild financial success, the film did not reach the popularity of the first, receiving generally negative responses from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nA year after the events of the first film, Mitch Robbins is a much happier and livelier man, having moved out of the city. He is the manager at the radio station, and has employed his best friend, Phil Berquist. However, he is plagued with nightmares about deceased trail boss, Curly, and believe he may still be alive. On his 40th birthday, Mitch sees a man resembling Curly on the train. He later finds a treasure map belonging to Lincoln Washburn hidden in Curly's old cowboy hat, albeit with a missing corner. He and Phil investigate the map's contents and learn that Lincoln was Curly's father and a train robber in the Old West. In 1908, he infamously stole and hid one million dollars in [[gold bullion]] in the deserts near [[Las Vegas]]. With an impending trip to Las Vegas for a convention, Mitch decides to search for the gold (now worth twenty million) along with Phil, and his immature younger brother, Glen.\n\nSeveral mishaps ensue, such as Glen accidentally burning a hole in the map with a magnifying glass, Mitch nearly falling off a cliff while retrieving it, and Phil believing a rattlesnake bit him when he sits on a cactus. They are ambushed by the two cowboys who sold them their supplies. They demand the map, since Phil recklessly blabbed about the gold. Just as they are poised to kill them, a man resembling Curly appears and fights them off. He is Duke, Curly's identical twin brother. He explains that long ago, their father had plans to find the gold with his sons once he was no longer being monitored, but he died before he could. On her death bed, their mother gave Curly the map, and he contacted Duke to find him so that they could find the gold together, but he died on the cattle drive the previous year. Duke learned from Cookie that Mitch had Curly's belongings, and so sought him out, though Mitch believed he was Curly. Though Duke is prepared to take the map and find the gold by himself, Mitch chastises him for his attitude, reasoning that Curly would not approve. Out of respect for Curly, Duke relents and allows the others to accompany him and share the gold.\n\nA reckless act by Mitch causes a stampede in which the map and almost all their supplies are lost. Thanks to Glen's memory, they are able to press on and find the location of the cave where the gold is hidden. They eventually find it, but are confronted by two armed cowboys also seeking it. In the ensuing fight, Glen is shot, but Duke discovers the bullets to be blanks with red paint pellets. At that moment, Clay Stone, the organizer of the cattle drive, appears along with some of their old friends, such as Ira and Barry Shalowitz. Clay explains that the cowboys are his sons and he has been looking for Duke for some time. Having left the cattle business, he is now making a living taking men on a trip to find the gold, which is revealed to be lead bars painted gold. Though Mitch, Phil, and Glen feel lost, Duke remains convinced that the gold is out there somewhere, and stays behind as the others return to Las Vegas.\n\nMitch is visited by Duke in his hotel room, who confesses that he had planned to cheat Mitch and the others out of the gold, but couldn't bring himself to do so, having found his 'one thing' to be honesty. Through Mitch's skepticism, Duke also reveals that he possesses the missing corner of the map, which points to where Lincoln reburied the gold in 1909, and presents a bar of it to Mitch as evidence. He tries to scratch the gold off with a knife, and screams in joy upon realizing that it is real after all.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Mitch Robbins\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Phil Berquist\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Glen Robbins\n* [[Jack Palance]] as Duke Washburn\n* [[Patricia Wettig]] as Barbara Robbins\n* [[Noble Willingham]] as Clay Stone\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Bud\n* [[Bill McKinney]] as Matt\n* [[David Paymer]] as Ira Shalowitz\n* [[Josh Mostel]] as Barry Shalowitz\n* Lindsay Crystal as Holly Robbins\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Lois\n* [[Jayne Meadows]] as The Voice of Mitch's Mother\n* [[Jennifer Crystal Foley|Jennifer Crystal]] as The Jogger\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Dr. Jeffrey Sanborn (uncredited)\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Norman (voice){{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Production==\nParts of the film were shot in [[Arches National Park]], Dugout Ranch, Professor Valley, and [[Goblin Valley]] in [[Utah]].
