The film stars [[Steve Carell]] and [[Keira Knightley]] as a pair of strangers who meet and form an unexpected bond as they help each other find closure in their lives before an asteroid wipes out life on Earth. The inspiration for the title comes from a line in [[Chris Cornell]]'s song \"Preaching the End of the World\", from his 1999 debut solo album ''[[Euphoria Morning]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/commentary-norah-had-screenwriter-wanting-120281|title=Commentary: 'Norah' had screenwriter wanting to be 16 again |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=October 2, 2008|access-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/for-end-of-the-world-writerdirector-lorene-scafaria-music-is-key/2012/06/21/gJQAXGfetV_story.html|title=For 'End of the World' writer/director Lorene Scafaria, music is key |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 21, 2012|access-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe film was theatrically released on June 22, 2012, in the [[United States]] by [[Focus Features]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], earning $9.6 million on a $10 million budget. It was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] and made available for [[streaming video|digital streaming]] in the United States on October 23, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[New York City]], a breaking news report informs the world that a mission to stop an incoming 70-mile wide asteroid known as \"Matilda\" has failed and that the asteroid will make impact in three weeks, [[Global catastrophic risk|destroying all life on Earth]]. Dodge Petersen and his wife, Linda, listen to the broadcast parked on the side of the road. When Dodge expresses disinterest, Linda looks disgusted and abandons both the vehicle and their marriage. At home, Dodge reminisces about his high school sweetheart, Olivia, when he notices his neighbor Penny crying on the fire escape. She just broke up with her boyfriend Owen for making her miss her last opportunity to see her family in [[England]]. Dodge stops going to his job at an insurance company when one of his co-workers commits suicide. He also attends a bacchanal at the house of his best friend, where he politely avoids the amorous intentions of a friendly stranger and of his best friend's wife (on the latter case, he says he cannot cheat with a married woman, but she points out that marriage means nothing now that civilization is going to end). At her apartment, Penny gives Dodge three years worth of his mail that was incorrectly delivered to her and, in the process, unwittingly tells him that his wife was having an affair. Dodge storms off into the night, guzzling [[codeine]]-laced cough syrup and window cleaner in a suicide attempt. He wakes up in a park, with a dog tethered to his foot and a note on his sweater reading \"Sorry\", which becomes the dog's name. Dodge takes Sorry home, opens the old mail, and is surprised to discover a three-month-old letter from Olivia, which explains that he was \"the love of her life\". Later, a riot breaks out in their neighborhood. Dodge and Penny abandon the self-centered Owen amid the rioters, with Dodge explaining to Penny that he knows someone who could fly her to England if she helps him find Olivia. She agrees, and the two set off with Sorry for Dodge's hometown in [[Delaware]].\n\nAlong the way, Dodge and Penny run out of gas, witness the bizarre death of suicidal motorist Glenn whose plan to pay an assassin to kill him without warning pays off, see the beginning of an orgy at a chain restaurant but leave in terror before the frenzied sex begins, have sex themselves in a pick-up truck, and spend a night in jail. They get a ride to [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[New Jersey]], where they meet Penny's ex-boyfriend, Speck, who is prepared for the [[apocalypse]]. Speck has a working [[satellite phone]] in his bunker and lets Penny contact her family. Penny and Dodge borrow a car from Speck and eventually make it to Olivia's family home. Dodge and Penny walk up to the door of the home but find no one home and then spend the day together; they realize a mutual affection. Penny discovers a letter from Olivia to her parents, which reveals Olivia's address. Penny and Dodge drive to Olivia's home, where Dodge leaves a letter to Olivia and expresses his feelings for Penny. Later, they go to the house of the man who Dodge promised could take Penny to England. The man turns out to be Dodge's estranged father, Frank. After making amends with Frank, Dodge puts a sleeping Penny into his father's plane, whispering to her that she is the real love of his life. Frank and Penny depart, leaving Dodge behind. Dodge takes refuge in Penny's apartment and awaits his imminent death until Penny unexpectedly returns, upset that Dodge allowed her to leave. The two lie in bed and comfort each other as they feel the tremor of the asteroid's impact. Penny expresses regret at not having met Dodge sooner, while Dodge assures her that their meeting had been opportune. Penny smiles as everything fades to white.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Dodge Petersen\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Penelope \"Penny\" Lockhart\n* [[William Petersen]] as Glenn\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Karen Amalfi\n* [[Adam Brody]] as Owen\n* [[Tonita Castro]] as Elsa\n* [[Mark Moses]] as Anchorman\n* [[Derek Luke]] as Alan Speck\n* [[Connie Britton]] as Diane\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] as Roache\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Warren\n* [[Rob Huebel]] as Jeremy\n* [[Gillian Jacobs]] as Katie\n* [[T.J.
