It is a remake of the 1978 American film ''[[Fingers (1978 film)|Fingers]]'', and tells the story of Tom, a shady realtor torn between a criminal life and his desire to become a concert pianist. The film premiered on 17 February 2005 at the [[Berlin Film Festival]]. The film was given limited release to theaters in North America and grossed $1,023,424 and $10,988,397 worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIntense young \"tough\" Thomas Seyr is a 28-year-old [[real estate]] broker involved in shady business deals. His business partners, Fabrice and Sami, spend much of their time ruthlessly chasing squatters and illegal immigrants out of the buildings they have procured and trying to work their way around government housing regulations. Thomas is born to this kind of work; his father, Robert, is involved in dodgy endeavors and sometimes calls upon Thomas to beat up people who refuse to pay. Tom shows a protective and defensive attitude toward his father who doesn't always appreciate what his son does for him \u2013 so much so that when his father introduces his new girlfriend to Tom, Tom undermines her to her face, and insults her to his father, insisting she is an opportunistic \"whore.\" Later, when he tries to enlist her help to watch over his father, she tells him they broke up due to Robert changing his attitude and she is aware of Tom's backstabbing because Robert told her. Robert by this time is in danger from a Russian gangster, Minskov (Anton Yakovlev) who scammed him out of 300,000 Euros and Tom is worried for his safety.\n\nTom chances upon his late mother's manager, his mother having been a concert pianist until she died 8 years previously. The manager remembers him playing something when he was 20 years old, and invites him to audition for him. The opportunity rapidly takes over Tom's imagination, becoming an obsession. He finds a teacher newly emigrated to France, virtuoso Miao Lin, to help him prepare for the audition. She speaks only Chinese, Vietnamese and some English, but no French. Tom misses appointments and drops assignments while practicing piano around the clock, and having an affair with the wife of one of his promiscuous business partners. Finally Tom reaches the high standards of his teacher, but he falls apart at the audition, having stayed up all night helping his partners with a business deal. He goes to see his father only to find the apartment destroyed and his father murdered. Tom is devastated.\n\nTwo years later: Tom tests a piano onstage and gives directions to the stage manager. He drives Miao Lin to the concert hall and parks the car, when he chances to see Minskov. He follows Minskov, and takes him by surprise waiting for an elevator. They fight in the stairwell, Minskov almost shooting Tom. Tom gains the upper hand and tries to use Minskov's own gun against him, but cannot pull the trigger. Tom washes in the restroom and takes his seat in the concert hall, knuckles and shirt bloody, exchanging affectionate glances with Miao Lin at the piano. He is evidently Miao Lin's manager and partner.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Romain Duris]] as Thomas Seyr\n* [[Niels Arestrup]] as Robert Seyr\n* [[Jonathan Zacca\u00ef]] as Fabrice\n* {{ill|Gilles Cohen|FR|Gilles Cohen}} as Sami\n* [[Linh Dan Pham]] as Miao Lin\n* [[Jian-Zhang]] as Jean-Pierre (Miao Lin's friend)\n* [[Aure Atika]] as Aline\n* [[Emmanuelle Devos]] as Chris\n* {{ill|Anton Yakovlev|FR|Anton Yakovlev}} as Minskov\n* [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] as Minskov's Girlfriend\n* [[Sandy Whitelaw]] as Mr. Fox\n\n==Background==\nThe film is a [[remake]] of [[James Toback]]'s 1978 film ''[[Fingers (1978 film)|Fingers]]'', but it devotes more attention to the relationship between Tom and his piano teacher, Miao Lin. The idea that affection can blossom despite a language barrier is one which [[Jacques Audiard]] has raised before in ''[[Sur mes l\u00e8vres|Read My Lips]]'' (starring [[Vincent Cassel]]).\n\nFor the film, Duris learned to play his own piano sequences\u2013most notably, [[Bach]]'s [[Toccata]] in E minor, trained by his sister, pianist Caroline Duris, who performs on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news| last =Toumani| first =Meline| title =The 60-Day Course in Perfect Fake Piano Playing| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| date =10 July 2005| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/movies/10toum.html?pagewanted=all| access-date =3 January 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe film's French title comes from the lyrics of the [[Jacques Dutronc]] song ''La Fille du p\u00e8re No\u00ebl'' (\"Santa Claus' Daughter\"), written by [[Jacques Lanzmann]]. It translates to English as \"My heart stopped beating\".\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Won===\n*'''[[59th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]]'''\n**[[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film not in the English Language]]\n*'''[[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]'''\n**Silver Berlin Bear: Best Film Music ([[Alexandre Desplat]])\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]'''  \n**Best Actor &ndash; Supporting Role ([[Niels Arestrup]])\n**Best Cinematography ([[St\u00e9phane Fontaine]])\n**Best Director ([[Jacques Audiard]]) \n**Best Editing ([[Juliette Welfling]]) \n**Best Film\n**Best Music Written for a Film ([[Alexandre Desplat]])\n**Best Screenplay &ndash; Adapted ([[Jacques Audiard]] and [[Tonino Benacquista]])\n**Most Promising Actress ([[Linh Dan Pham]])\n*'''[[French Syndicate of Cinema Critics]]''' \n**Best Film\n*'''[[Lumi\u00e8res Award]]'''  \n**[[Lumi\u00e8res Award for Best Film|Best Film]]\n**[[Lumi\u00e8res Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] ([[Romain Duris]])\n* '''[[Seville European Film Festival]]'''\n**[[Golden Giraldillo to Best Film]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/news/seville-dances-to-audiard-s-beat-1117932957/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Seville dances to Audiard's 'Beat'|date=15 November 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Nominated===\n*'''[[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]]'''\n**Golden Berlin Bear ([[Jacques Audiard]])\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]'''\n**Best Actor &ndash; Leading Role ([[Romain Duris]])\n**Best Sound ([[Philippe Amouroux]], [[Cyril Holtz]], [[Brigitte Taillandier]] and [[Pascal Villard]])\n*'''[[European Film Awards]]''' \n**Best Actor ([[Romain Duris]])\n**(Audience Award) Best Director ([[Jacques Audiard]])\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0411270|The Beat That My Heart Skipped}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|beat_that_my_heart_skipped|The Beat That My Heart Skipped}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=The Beat That My Heart Skipped}}\n\n{{Jacques Audiard}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''The Beat That My Heart Skipped''\n|list =\n{{BAFTA Best Foreign Language Film}}\n{{C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film}}\n{{Lumi\u00e8res Award for Best Film}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beat That My Heart Skipped}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:French drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s French-language films]]\n[[Category:BAFTA winners (films)]]\n[[Category:Best Film C\u00e9sar Award winners]]\n[[Category:C\u00e9sar Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jacques Audiard]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor C\u00e9sar Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Director C\u00e9sar Award]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actor Lumi\u00e8res Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Best Foreign Language Film BAFTA Award winners]]\n[[Category:Best Film Lumi\u00e8res Award winners]]\n[[Category:French remakes of American films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alexandre Desplat]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jacques Audiard]]\n[[Category:Films about pianos and pianists]]\n[[Category:2005 drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]"}]}}}}
