The film stars [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Joe Morton]], and [[Jeff Daniels]]. Its premise revolves around a bus that is rigged by a terrorist to explode if its speed falls below 50 miles per hour.\n\nThe film premiered in Hollywood on June 7, 1994, and was released in United States on June 10, 1994, it became critically and commercially successful, grossing $350.4&nbsp;million on a $30\u201337&nbsp;million budget, becoming the [[1994 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 1994]] and winning two [[67th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. A sequel, ''[[Speed 2: Cruise Control]]'', was released on June 13, 1997, without Reeves' involvement. The latter film would go down in infamy as one of the worst sequels of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/movies/2010/03/speed_2_the_worst_sequel_of_al.html|title=''Speed 2'' the Worst Sequel of All?

As they corner Payne, he takes Harry hostage. Jack intentionally shoots Harry in the leg, forcing the bomber to release him. Payne flees and explodes the bomb, seemingly dying. Jack and Harry are praised by Lieutenant \"Mac\" McMahon, with Harry being promoted. Having survived the incident, however, Payne watches from afar. The next morning, Jack witnesses a mass transit bus explode orchestrated by Payne, who contacts Jack on a nearby payphone, explaining that a similar bomb is rigged on another bus, which will activate once it reaches {{convert|50|mph|km/h}} and detonate if it drops below 50. \n\nPayne also demands a ransom of $3.7&nbsp;million and threatens to detonate the bus if the passengers are offloaded. Jack races through freeway traffic and boards the bus, but the bomb is already armed. He explains the situation to Sam Silver, the bus driver. However, a criminal on board, fearing Jack is about to arrest him, wildly discharges his gun, accidentally wounding Sam. Another passenger, Annie Porter, takes over for Sam, but when she tries to slow down so he can get help, Jack is forced to reveal the bomb, to the passengers' shock and horror. Jack examines the bomb underneath the bus and calls Harry, who works to identify the bomber. The bus is cleared to drive on an unopened freeway section. Mac demands that they offload the passengers onto a flatbed trailer, but Jack warns him about Payne's plot. \n\nWitnessing the events on TV, Payne calls Jack to reiterate his instructions. While he is convinced to allow the injured Sam to be offloaded for medical attention as a show of good will, Payne detonates a smaller bomb after witnessing a passenger attempt to get off, killing her. When Jack learns part of the freeway is incomplete, he persuades Annie to accelerate so they can jump the gap, which narrowly succeeds, before directing her to a nearby [[Los Angeles International Airport|airport]] to use their unobstructed runways. Meanwhile, Harry identifies Payne's name, former occupation as a bomb squad officer, and address. He leads a SWAT team to Payne's home, but the property explodes, killing them. In a last-ditch attempt to defuse the bomb, Jack goes under the bus on a towed sled, but he accidentally punctures the fuel tank when the sled breaks from its tow line. \n\nAfter the passengers bring him back aboard, Jack learns that Harry has been killed and that Payne has been watching the passengers on a hidden surveillance camera. Mac has a local news crew record the transmission and rebroadcasts it on a loop to fool Payne while the passengers are offloaded onto an airport bus. Jack and Annie escape through a floor access panel before the empty bus collides with a [[Boeing 707]] cargo plane and explodes. Jack and Mac head to [[Pershing Square (Los Angeles)|Pershing Square]] to drop the ransom. Realizing that he has been fooled, no one died in the explosion, and the LAPD are waiting for him, Payne poses as a police officer to kidnap Annie and recover the ransom. Jack follows Payne into the Metro [[B Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]] subway, and discovers that Annie has been fitted with an [[explosive belt|explosive vest]] rigged to a [[dead man's switch|pressure-release detonator]]. \n\nPayne hijacks a subway train, handcuffs Annie to a pole, and sets the train in motion while Jack pursues them. After killing the train engineer, Payne attempts a bribe with the ransom money, but is enraged when a [[dye pack]] in the bag explodes, tainting the cash. A crazed Payne battles Jack on the train's roof before the former is decapitated by a [[railway signal]]. Jack deactivates Annie's vest, but cannot free her from the pole as Payne had the key to her handcuffs. Unable to stop the train, Jack accelerates it, causing it to jump the tracks, as it plows through a construction site and then bursts onto [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The train car comes to a halt, on the street. Unharmed, Jack and Annie share a kiss while a crowd looks on in amazement.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Officer Jack Traven\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as Howard Payne\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Annie Porter\n* [[Joe Morton]] as Lieutenant Herb 'Mac' McMahon\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Detective Harry Temple\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Doug Stephens\n* [[Glenn Plummer]] as Maurice\n* [[Beth Grant]] as Helen\n* [[Hawthorne James]] as Sam Silver\n* [[Carlos Carrasco (actor)|Carlos Carrasco]] as Ortiz\n* [[David Kriegel]] as Terry\n* [[Natsuko Ohama]] as Mrs. Kamino\n* [[Daniel Villarreal]] as Ray\n* [[Margaret Medina]] as Officer Robin\n* [[Jordan Lund]] as Bagwell\n* [[Robert Mailhouse]] as Young Executive\n* [[Patrick Fischler]] as Friend of executive\n* [[Patrick John Hurley]] as CEO\n* Susan Barnes as Female Executive\n* [[Neisha Folkes-LeMelle]] as Mrs. McMahon\n* [[Richard Lineback]] as Sergeant Norwood\n* [[Beau Starr]] as Commissioner\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Train Driver\n* [[John Capodice]] as Bob\n* [[Thomas Rosales Jr.]] as Vinnie\n* [[Sandy Martin]] as Bartender\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Harbor Fwy Upper Deck1.jpg|thumb|Part of the film featured the bus making its way onto [[Interstate 110 and State Route 110 (California)|Interstate 110]] through the traffic.]]\n\n===Writing===\nScreenwriter [[Graham Yost]] was told by his father, Canadian television host [[Elwy Yost]], about a 1985 film called ''[[Runaway Train (film)|Runaway Train]]'' starring [[Jon Voight]], about a train that speeds out of control. The film was based on a 1963 concept by Japanese filmmaker [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Elwy mistakenly believed that the train's situation was due to a bomb on board. Such a theme had in fact been used in a 1975 [[Japanese film]], ''[[The Bullet Train]]''. After seeing the Voight film, Graham decided that it would have been better if there had been a bomb on board a bus with the bus being forced to travel at 20&nbsp;mph to prevent an actual explosion. A friend suggested that this be increased to 50&nbsp;mph.<ref>''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' - ''Special Collectors' Edition - The Greatest Action Movies Ever'' (published in 2001)</ref> The film's end was inspired by the end of the 1976 film ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]''. Yost had initially named the film ''Minimum Speed'' reflecting on the plot element of the bus unable to drop below a speed. He realized that using \"minimum\" would immediately apply a negative connotation to the title, and simply renamed it to ''Speed''.<ref name=\"ew 20th yost\">{{cite magazine | url = http://ew.com/article/2014/06/10/speed-20th-anniversary-graham-yost/ | title = 'Speed' 20th anniversary: Screenwriter Graham Yost looks back | first = Mandi | last = Bierly | date = June 10, 2014 | magazine = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | access-date = May 25, 2019 | archive-date = May 18, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190518002930/https://ew.com//article/2014/06/10/speed-20th-anniversary-graham-yost/ | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nYost's initial script would have the film completely occur on the bus; there was no elevator or subway scene, the bus would have driven around [[Dodger Stadium]] due to the ability to drive around in circles, and would have culminated with the bus running into the [[Hollywood Sign]] and destroying it.<ref name=\"ew 20th yost\"/> Upon finishing the script, Yost took his idea to [[Paramount Pictures]], which expressed interest in green-lighting the film and chose [[John McTiernan]] to direct due to his blockbuster films ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', ''[[Die Hard]]'', and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''. However, McTiernan eventually declined to do so, feeling the script was too much of a ''Die Hard'' retread, and suggested [[Jan De Bont]], who agreed to direct because he had the experience of being the [[director of photography]] for action movies, including McTiernan's ''Die Hard'' and ''The Hunt for Red October''. Despite a promising script, Paramount passed on the project, feeling audiences would not want to see a movie which takes place for two hours on a bus, so De Bont and Yost then took the project to [[20th Century Fox]] which also distributed ''Die Hard''.<ref name=poststar/>  Fox agreed to green-light the project on the condition there were action sequences in the film other than the bus.  De Bont then suggested starting the film off with the bomb on an elevator in an office building, as he had an experience of being trapped in an elevator while working on ''Die Hard''.<ref name=poststar/> Yost used the opening elevator scene to establish Traven as being clever enough to overcome the villain, comparable to [[Perseus]] tricking [[Medusa]] into looking at her own reflection.<ref name=\"ew 20th yost\"/> Yost then decided to conclude the film on a subway train to have a final plot twist not involving the action on the bus. Fox then immediately approved the project.<ref name=poststar/><ref name=\"ew 20th yost\"/>\n\nIn preparing the shooting script, one unnamed author had revised Yost's script in a manner that Yost had called \"terrible\".<ref name=\"ew 20th yost\"/> Yost spent three days \"reconfiguring\" this draft.<ref name=\"ew 20th yost\"/> [[Paul Attanasio]] was also brought in as a [[script doctor]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Attanasio Bio |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001921/bio |publisher=iMDB |access-date=June 1, 2019 |archive-date=May 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519191803/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001921/bio |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=June 2019}} Jan de Bont brought in [[Joss Whedon]] a week before principal photography started to work on the script.<ref name=\"Kozak\">{{cite news| last = Kozak| first = Jim| title = ''Serenity'' Now!| work = In Focus| date = August\u2013September 2005| url = http://www.natoonline.org/infocus/05augustseptember/whedonuncut.htm| access-date = April 9, 2009| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615162238/http://www.natoonline.org/infocus/05augustseptember/whedonuncut.htm| archive-date = June 15, 2011}}</ref> According to Yost: \"Joss Whedon wrote 98.9 percent of the dialogue.

Reeves did not like how the Jack Traven character came across in Yost's original screenplay. He felt that there were \"situations set up for one-liners and I felt it was forced\u2014''Die Hard'' mixed with some kind of screwball comedy.\"<ref name=\"Gerosa\"/> With Reeves' input, Whedon changed Traven from being \"a maverick hotshot\" to \"the polite guy trying not to get anybody killed,\"<ref name=\"Kozak\"/> and removed the character's glib dialogue and made him more earnest.<ref name=\"Gerosa\"/>\n\nYost also gave Whedon credit for the \"Pop quiz, hotshot\" line.<ref name=\"ew 20th yost\"/> Another of Whedon's contributions was changing the character of Doug Stephens ([[Alan Ruck]]) from a lawyer (\"a bad guy and he died\", according to the writer) to a tourist, \"just a nice, totally out-of-his-depth guy\".<ref name=\"Kozak\"/> Whedon worked predominantly on the dialogue, but also created a few significant plot points, like the killing of Harry Temple.<ref name=\"Kozak\"/> Yost had originally planned for Temple to be the villain of the story, as he felt that having an off-screen antagonist would not be interesting. However, Yost recognized that there was a lot of work in the script to establish Temple as this villain. When [[Dennis Hopper]] was cast as Howard Payne, Yost recognized that Hopper's Payne readily worked as a villain, allowing them to rewrite Temple to be non-complicit in the bomb situation.<ref name=\"ew 20th yost\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[Jeff Speakman]] was originally attached to star in ''Speed'' when the project was under Paramount's management, but was dropped from the project when it was sold to 20th Century Fox.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Art of Action: Episode 17 Jeff Speakman|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psO6_gwHtio|website=YouTube|publisher=[[Scott Adkins]]|time=41:30|access-date=9 February 2021|archive-date=November 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115231433/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psO6_gwHtio&feature=youtu.be|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Stephen Baldwin]], the first choice for the role of Jack Traven, declined the offer because he felt the character (as written in the earlier version of the script) was too much like the John McClane character from ''Die Hard''.<ref name=\"Gerosa\"/> According to Yost, they had also considered [[Tom Cruise]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[Woody Harrelson]].<ref name=\"ew 20th yost\"/> Director Jan de Bont ultimately cast Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven after seeing him in ''[[Point Break (1991 film)|Point Break]]''.

The director remembers, \"everyone at the studio was scared shitless when they first saw it. There was only like a millimeter.

He became very quiet, and it took him quite a while to work it out by himself and calm down. It scared the hell out of him\", de Bont recalls.<ref name=\"Gerosa\"/> Initially, Reeves was nervous about the film's many action sequences but as the shooting progressed he became more involved. He wanted to do the stunt in which Traven jumps from a Jaguar onto the bus himself, and rehearsed it in secret after de Bont disapproved.

The bus used in the jump was empty except for the driver, who wore a shock-absorbing harness that suspended him mid-air above the seat, so he could handle the jolt on landing, and avoid spinal injury (as was the case for many stuntmen in previous years that were handling similar stunts). The highway section the bus jumped over is the directional ramp from I-105 WB to I-110 NB (not the HOV ramp from I-110 SB to I-105 WB as commonly believed),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Speed4.shtml|title=Speed: Filming Locations - part 4|last=GJW|access-date=April 19, 2017|archive-date=April 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419193116/http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Speed4.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> and as the flyover was already constructed, a gap was added in the editing process using [[computer-generated imagery]] with the help of [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]].<ref name=\"MakingOff\" /> A 2009 episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'' attempted to recreate the bus jump as proposed, including the various tricks that they knew were used by the filmmakers such as the ramp, and proved that the jump, as in the film, would never have been possible.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://people.com/celebrity/speed-movie-celebrates-20th-anniversary/ | title = 20 Reasons to Love Speed, 20 Years Later | first = Drew | last = Mackie | date = June 13, 2014 | access-date = January 19, 2018 | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | archive-date = January 20, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180120065912/http://people.com/celebrity/speed-movie-celebrates-20th-anniversary/ | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nOn a commentary track on the region 1 DVD, De Bont reports that the bus jump stunt did not go as planned. To do the jump the bus had everything possible removed to make it lighter. On the first try the stunt driver missed the ramp and crashed the bus, making it unusable. This was not reported to the studio at the time. A second bus was prepared and two days later a second attempt was successful. But, again, things did not go as intended. Advised that the bus would only go about 20 feet, the director placed one of his multiple cameras in a position that was supposed to capture the bus landing. However, the bus traveled much farther airborne than anyone had thought possible. It crashed down on top of the camera and destroyed it. Luckily, another camera placed about 90 feet from the jump ramp recorded the event.\n\nFilming of the final scenes occurred at [[Mojave Air and Space Port|Mojave Airport]], which doubled for [[Los Angeles International Airport]].

[[Sandra Bullock]] agreed to star again as Annie, for financial backing for another project, but [[Keanu Reeves]] declined the offer to return as Jack. As a result, [[Jason Patric]] was written into the story as Alex Shaw, Annie's new boyfriend, with her and Jack having broken up due to her worry about Jack's dangerous lifestyle. [[Willem Dafoe]] starred as the villain John Geiger, and [[Glenn Plummer]] (who played Reeves's character's carjacking victim) also [[cameo appearance|cameos]] as the same character, this time driving a boat that Alex takes control of.
