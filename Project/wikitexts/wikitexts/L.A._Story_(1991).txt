Story''''' is a 1991 American [[satire (film and television)|satirical]] [[romantic comedy]] film written by and starring [[Steve Martin]] and directed by [[Mick Jackson (film director)|Mick Jackson]]. The plot follows a weatherman (Martin) trying to find love in Los Angeles. It was released on February 8, 1991, and received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nHarris K. Telemacher is a TV [[weather presenter]] living in Los Angeles. He is in a dead-end relationship with his social-climbing girlfriend Trudi, and feels his job requires him to be undignified and unintellectual, though he has a PhD in arts and humanities. He wants to find some meaning and magic in his life, having grown increasingly weary of what he sees as the rather shallow and [[superficiality|superficial]] city of LA, from overly pretentious coffee orders to bizarre shooting etiquette rules on the freeway. He spends his time roller-skating through art galleries with his friend Ariel, offering eccentric art reviews to acquaintances, remixing Shakespeare a lot, and otherwise seeking to escape his ordinary life.\n\nAt a luncheon with a group of friends, he meets Sara, a journalist from [[London]], with whom he immediately becomes infatuated.\n\nDriving home that night, his car breaks down on the freeway. He notices that a [[Variable-message sign|freeway traffic condition sign]] seems to be displaying messages intended solely for him. It offers him cryptic advice on his love life throughout the movie.\n\nHe begins to fall for Sara, but she is conflicted because she has pledged to reconcile with her ex-husband, Roland. Feeling that a relationship with Sara is unlikely, Harris begins dating SanDeE*, a ditzy aspiring [[spokesmodel]], whom he meets at a clothing store. After his first date with her, Harris discovers that Trudi has been cheating on him for three years with his agent. The discovery leads him to pursue his romantic interest in Sara. This is complicated by his new relationship with SanDeE* and by Sara's feeling of obligation to Roland.\n\nBy the conclusion, he has successfully wooed Sara \u2013 with some encouragement and advice from the sign, some helpful weather, and plenty of cameos from [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Iman (model)|Iman]], [[Rick Moranis]], [[Terry Jones]], and many others, with musical encouragement from [[Enya]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Harris K.
