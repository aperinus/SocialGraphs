It stars Allen, [[Mia Farrow]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[David Ogden Stiers]], [[Jodie Foster]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[John Cusack]], [[Madonna]], and [[Kenneth Mars]]. It was filmed on a {{convert|26000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} set at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]], which was the biggest set ever built in New York. It was also Allen's last film for [[Orion Pictures]].\n\n''Shadows and Fog'' is an homage to [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] filmmakers [[Fritz Lang]], [[G. W. Pabst]] and [[F. W. Murnau]] in its visual presentation, and to the writer [[Franz Kafka]] in theme. Critical reception of the work was lukewarm.\n\n==Plot ==\nKleinman is awakened from his sleep by a [[vigilante]] mob, which claims to be looking for a [[serial killer]] and therefore to be needing his help. Kleinman's landlady gives him a bag containing pepper. Irmy and her boyfriend Paul, a pair of circus performers, quarrel about getting married and having a baby. Paul leaves and goes to another tent where he has sex with Marie, another artist. Seeing this, Irmy runs to the city and enters a brothel. Irmy also ends up having sex with a student named Jack.\n\nKleinman visits a coroner's house and has a glass of sherry with him. But after he leaves, the coroner is murdered by the killer. Kleinman comes to the police station to protest a local family's eviction. There, the police talk about the coroner's murder, saying that they have a clue about the killer in the fingerprints on the sherry glass. A panicked Kleinman meets Irmy in the police station, who had been arrested at the brothel for prostitution. She protests against the police calling her \"whore,\u201d and in the confusion Kleinman confiscates the evidence. Irmy is allowed to leave the police station after a $50 fine, and she meets Kleinman outside. Together they start exploring the city, seeing its different scenes \u2014 a man peeping into a woman's room, a starving mother and child, a church \u2014 and decide to go back.\n\nPaul arrives in the city looking for Irmy. He goes into a bar where Jack is having a drink. The student reflects on the wonderful experience he had with \"a sword-swallower,\u201d shocking Paul. Kleinman and Irmy return to his place to stay but are refused entry by his fianc\u00e9e. They go to the pier but are ambushed by the vigilante mob who find the sherry glass in Kleinman's pocket. Thinking him to be the killer, they decide to lynch Irmy and Kleinman, but the latter uses the pepper spray and they escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Irmy and Paul meet, and at first Paul is ready to kill Irmy for sleeping with another man. They break off their fight when they find the starving woman murdered, and the baby lying on the ground. They decide to keep the child and return to the circus. Kleinman comes to the brothel searching for Irmy but is unable to find her. From his rival at work, he learns about the circus leaving the town and decides to follow it. At the circus, Kleinman meets the magician Armstead, whom he greatly admires. The murderer arrives and tries to kill them but is thwarted by Armstead. Kleinman becomes Armstead's assistant on the circus and Irmy and Paul continue their careers as circus performers, while raising their newfound child.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Woody Allen]]&nbsp;\u2013 Kleinman\n*[[Victor Argo]]&nbsp;\u2013 Hacker's Vigilante #2\n*[[Kathy Bates]]&nbsp;\u2013 Prostitute\n*[[Philip Bosco]]&nbsp;\u2013 Mr. Paulsen\n*Charles Cragin&nbsp;\u2013 Spiro\n*[[John Cusack]]&nbsp;\u2013 Student Jack\n*[[Mia Farrow]]&nbsp;\u2013 Irmy\n*[[Jodie Foster]]&nbsp;\u2013 Dorrie\n*[[Fred Gwynne]]&nbsp;\u2013 Hacker's Follower\n*[[Robert Joy]]&nbsp;\u2013 Spiro's Follower\n*[[Julie Kavner]]&nbsp;\u2013 Alma\n*[[Steven Keats]]&nbsp;\u2013 Hacker's Vigilante #3 (uncredited)\n*[[Michael Kirby (figure skater)|Michael Kirby]]&nbsp;\u2013 Killer\n*[[William H.
