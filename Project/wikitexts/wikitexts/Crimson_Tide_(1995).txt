It takes place during a period of political turmoil in [[Russia]], in which [[Russian nationalism#Extremist nationalism|ultranationalists]] threaten to launch nuclear missiles at the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].\n\nThe film focuses on a clash of wills between the seasoned [[commanding officer]] of a U.S. nuclear missile submarine ([[Gene Hackman]]) and his new [[Executive officer#United States Navy and United States Coast Guard|executive officer]] ([[Denzel Washington]]), arising from conflicting interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. The story parallels [[Soviet submarine B-59|a real incident]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\n[[Hans Zimmer]], who scored the film, won a [[Grammy Award]] for the main theme, which heavily uses synthesizers instead of traditional orchestral instruments. An extended cut, which incorporates seven minutes of deleted scenes, was released on DVD in 2006, while the 2008 [[Blu-ray]] release only includes the theatrical version.<ref>[http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/638/crimsontide.html Crimson Tide Blu-ray Review] High-Def Digest, February 2008.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn post-Soviet [[Russia]], civil war erupts as a result of the [[First Chechen War|ongoing conflict]] in [[Chechnya]]. Military units loyal to Vladimir Radchenko, a Russian ultra-nationalist rebel, take control of a nuclear missile installation and threaten nuclear war if confronted.\n\nThe [[USS Alabama (SSBN-731)|USS ''Alabama'']], a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[ballistic missile submarine]], is dispatched on patrol with orders to launch a [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] if Radchenko fuels his missiles. Combat-hardened veteran [[Captain (United States Navy)|Captain]] Frank Ramsey is in command and chooses [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Ron Hunter as his new [[executive officer|XO]], who has an extensive education in military history and tactics, but no combat experience.\n\nTensions arise between the headstrong Ramsey and the more analytical and cautious Hunter, exacerbated by Ramsey's decision to order a missile drill amidst the chaos caused by a galley fire that results in the death of the chief mess officer. Hunter helps fight the fire and discreetly questions the decision but is chastised by Ramsey for the appearance of discord.\n\n''Alabama'' receives an [[Emergency Action Message]] ordering missile launch against the Russian base. As ''Alabama'' prepares to fire, a second radio message is detected before a rebel Russian {{sclass|Akula| submarine}} attacks, damaging the ship's radio and leaving the message incomplete.\n\nWith the last confirmed order being to launch, Ramsey decides to proceed. Hunter refuses to concur as is required, believing the partial second message may be a retraction. When Hunter refuses to consent, Ramsey tries to relieve him of duty. Hunter orders Ramsey arrested for attempting to circumvent [[Two-man rule|two-man protocol]]. The crew's loyalty is divided between Hunter and Ramsey, but the [[Chief of the Boat]] sides with Hunter in having Ramsey relieved of command and confined to his stateroom, putting Hunter in charge.\n\nThe Russian submarine attacks ''Alabama'' again. The American vessel emerges victorious but is hit by a torpedo. The main propulsion system is disabled and the [[bilge]] bay begins flooding. As the crew tries to restore propulsion, Hunter orders the sealing of the bilge with sailors trapped inside, saving the ship at the expense of the men. Just before the submarine reaches [[Submarine depth ratings#Crush depth|hull-crush depth]], propulsion is restored.\n\nOfficers and crew loyal to Ramsey unite and retake the control room, confining Hunter, the Chief of the Boat, and a few others to the officers' mess. Repairs to the radio continue, but Ramsey is determined to proceed without waiting for verification. Hunter escapes his arrest and stages a second mutiny. In doing so, he gains the support of weapons officer Peter Ince in the missile control room, further delaying the launch and leading Ramsey to proceed to missile control. Hunter's party storms the ship's command center, removing the captain's missile key. Ramsey and his men return to the control room, resulting in an armed [[Mexican standoff]]. With news that the radio will soon be repaired, Ramsey and Hunter agree to wait until the deadline for missile launch. Communications are restored, revealing the full message from the second transmission \u2013 a retraction ordering that the missile launch be aborted because Radchenko's rebellion has been quelled. Ramsey turns the [[Conn (nautical)|conn]] over to Hunter and returns to his cabin.\n\nThe two men are put before a [[tribunal]] at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor]] to answer for their actions. The tribunal concludes that both men were right and both men were wrong, and Hunter's actions were deemed lawfully justified and in the best interests of the United States. Unofficially, the tribunal reprimands both men for failing to resolve their differences. Thanks to Ramsey's personal recommendation, the tribunal agrees to grant Hunter command of his own sub while allowing Ramsey to save face via an early retirement with full honors. The two men part ways amicably. Captain Ramsey is allowed to keep his beloved Jack Russel terrier.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Lieutenant Commander Ron Hunter, Executive Officer (XO)\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Captain Frank Ramsey, Commanding Officer (CO)\n* [[George Dzundza]] as Chief of the Boat Walters (COB)\n* [[Matt Craven]] as Lieutenant Roy Zimmer, Communications Officer (COMMO)\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Lieutenant Peter Ince, Weapons Officer (WEPS)\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Lieutenant Bobby Dougherty, Supply Officer (SUPPO)\n* [[Rocky Carroll]] as Lieutenant Darik Westergard, Operations Officer (OPS)\n* [[Jaime P.

Those embarked included [[Hollywood Pictures]] president of production Ricardo Mestres,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0582338/|title=Ricardo Mestres|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-03-05}}</ref> director [[Tony Scott]], producers [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Don Simpson]], screenwriter [[Michael Schiffer]], and writer Richard Henrick.  While aboard, the Navy allowed the film crew to videotape ''Florida''{{'}}s Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander [[William Toti]], performing many of the same actions (Executive Officer's response to fire, flooding, missile launch sequence, etc.) that actor [[Denzel Washington]] eventually performed as Executive Officer in the movie.\n\nThe Navy had been led to believe that the movie's storyline was going to be about a Trident ballistic missile submarine crew attempting to stop the ship's fictional computer from launching nuclear missiles and starting [[World War III]]. In movie parlance, the Navy was told the story would be \"''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' meets ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\" The Navy wanted the ''Florida'' crew to prove to the studio executives that \"there is no computer on a Trident submarine that can launch missiles, hence the storyline is implausible.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nFollowing the at-sea walk-through and missile launch demonstration, ''Florida'' returned to port to drop off the studio executives. During that transit, Toti spent a great deal of time in the ship's [[wardroom]] with the studio executives, walking them through the missile launch redundancy procedures. A few months later, the studio returned to the Navy with the revised storyline, and the Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander Hunter (the character played by Denzel Washington) was now leading a mutiny against the commanding officer to prevent a missile launch.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}\n\nThe film has uncredited additional writing by [[Quentin Tarantino]], much of it being the pop-culture-reference laden dialogue.<ref name=\"QT\">{{cite book | first=Gerald | last=Peary | title=Quentin Tarantino Interviews | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5SdiFJmswcC | series=[[Conversations with Filmmakers Series]] |date=August 1998 | access-date=2008-08-03 | publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] | isbn=1-57806-050-8 | chapter=Chronology | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5SdiFJmswcC&pg=PR18 | page=xviii}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800021942/bio | title=Quentin Tarantino Biography | publisher=Yahoo Movies | access-date=2009-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place in 1994.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/Khap645LwIg Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20201219060014/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khap645LwIg&gl=US&hl=en Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khap645LwIg| title = Detr\u00e1s de las c\u00e1maras: \"Marea roja\" (Behind the scenes: \"Crimson Tide\") | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/yjG-vPFPie8 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20200119215513/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjG-vPFPie8 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjG-vPFPie8| title = C\u00f3mo se hizo \"Marea roja\" (\"Crimson Tide\" making-of) | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In the end, the Navy objected to many of the elements in the script\u2014particularly mutiny on board a U.S. naval vessel\u2014and as such, the film was produced without the Navy's assistance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Suid|first=Lawrence|title=Guts & Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|year=2002|edition=2|pages=748|isbn=978-0-8131-9018-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB8J2ho-0k8C&pg=PA609|access-date=February 2, 2009}}</ref> The [[French Navy]] assisted the team for production with the use of the aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Foch|R99|2}}.

After checking to make sure there was no law against filming naval vessels, the producers waited at the submarine base at [[Pearl Harbor]] until a submarine put to sea. After a submarine (coincidentally, the real USS ''Alabama'') left port, they pursued it in a boat and helicopter, filming as they went. They continued to do so until she submerged, giving them the footage they needed to incorporate into the film.<ref>Ryan, Tim.
