Belden]]. The film soundtrack features music by [[Deftones]], [[My Chemical Romance]], and [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]].\n\n''House of Wax'' premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and was released in United States theaters on May 6, 2005, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film grossed over $70 million worldwide and received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized its lack of originality, screenplay, and characters, but praised the performances and atmosphere.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn their way to a football game, Carly, her boyfriend Wade, her brother Nick, and their friends, Paige, Dalton and Blake, set up camp for the night in a wooded area. A stranger in a pickup truck arrives, then leaves after Nick smashes one of his headlights. The next morning, Wade discovers his car's fan belt is broken; a local man named Lester offers to drive Wade and Carly to the nearby town of Ambrose while the rest of the group head to the game.\n\nIn Ambrose, Carly and Wade meet a man named Bo who offers to sell them a fan belt and drive them back to their car after he is finished attending a funeral. They visit \"Trudy's House of Wax\" while they wait, a [[wax museum]] which is the central feature of the ghost town. They eventually follow Bo back to his house to get the fan belt; Carly waits in his truck while Wade goes inside to use the bathroom. Wade is attacked and knocked unconscious by Bo's twin brother Vincent, who wears a wax mask to cover the facial disfigurement he has from where they were once [[Conjoined twins|conjoined]]. When Carly notice's Bo's truck has a broken headlight, she flees from the scene, chased by Bo who catches her and takes her down to the gas station cellar. Meanwhile, Vincent covers Wade's body in molten wax.\n\nRealising they will not arrive at the game in time, Paige and Blake return to the campsite while Nick and Dalton arrive in Ambrose to look for Carly and Wade. When Carly attempts to call for help, Bo cuts off her fingertip. She manages to get Nick's attention who fends off Bo and then frees Carly, while Dalton finds Wade as part of the museum, trapped in a wax coating. Dalton tries to peel the wax from Wade's face, inadvertently removing his skin in the process. Vincent then ambushes Dalton as he slashes off a section of Wade's face, causing him to die from shock, before decapitating Dalton. \n\nWhile searching the town for help, Carly and Nick realise all of the wax figures are actually the wax-coated corpses of visitors. Meanwhile, back at the campsite, Vincent kills Blake and chases Paige into an abandoned sugar mill, where he kills her with a metal pipe through her forehead. Bo and Vincent chase Carly and Nick into the House of Wax. Nick unintentionally starts a fire in the workshop, causing the building and the figures inside to start melting. Bo and Nick battle and Nick is stabbed in the leg before Carly beats Bo to death with a baseball bat. Vincent chases Carly to the top floor where she tries to reason with him over his brother's treachery and, with Nick's help, is then able to stab him in the back. A dead Vincent falls through the floor and lands on top of Bo's corpse while Carly and Nick escape as the building melts to the ground.\n\nThe next morning, the police arrive and report that Ambrose had been abandoned for ten years since the sugar mill shut down. As Nick and Carly are driven away by ambulance, they are waved goodbye by Lester, who is revealed to be Bo and Vincent's other brother.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per closing tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Carly\n* [[Chad Michael Murray]] as Nick\n* [[Brian Van Holt]] as Bo and Vincent\n* [[Paris Hilton]] as Paige\n* [[Jared Padalecki]] as Wade\n* [[Jon Abrahams]] as Dalton\n* [[Robert Ri'chard]] as Blake\n\n== Filming ==\n''House of Wax'' was filmed at [[Warner Bros.
