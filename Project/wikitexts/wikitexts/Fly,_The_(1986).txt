Produced by [[Brooksfilms]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], the film stars [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Geena Davis]] and [[John Getz]]. Loosely based on [[George Langelaan]]'s 1957 [[The Fly (Langelaan)|short story of the same name]] and [[The Fly (1958 film)|the 1958 film of the same name]], ''The Fly'' tells of an eccentric scientist who, after one of his experiments goes wrong, slowly turns into a fly-hybrid creature. The [[film score|score]] was composed by [[Howard Shore]] and the make-up effects were created by [[Chris Walas]], along with makeup artist [[Stephan Dupuis]].\n\n''The Fly'' was released on August 15, 1986, to massive acclaim by critics and audiences, with praise mainly regarding the special effects and Goldblum's performance. It grossed $60.6 million at the box office against its $9 million budget, becoming the largest commercial success of Cronenberg's career. Walas and Dupuis' work on the film resulted in their winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], the only Oscar won by a film directed by Cronenberg. A [[The Fly II|sequel]], directed by Walas, was released in 1989.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nBrilliant but eccentric scientist Seth Brundle meets science journalist Veronica \"Ronnie\" Quaife at a meet-the-press event held by Bartok Science Industries, the company funding his work. He takes her back to the laboratory of his warehouse home and asks her to exclusively document his invention: two pods that can [[teleportation|teleport]] objects between them. While the \"telepods\" can transport inanimate objects perfectly, they are unable to teleport live tissue, as demonstrated when a [[baboon]] is turned inside out after being teleported.\n\nAs they experiment with the invention, Seth and Ronnie begin to form a relationship. Using two steaks, one a control and one teleported, Seth discovers that the machine is creating a synthetic version of biological material rather than the object itself. He reprograms the system to understand the makeup of living [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] and successfully teleports a second baboon. Ronnie departs before they can celebrate, and Seth worries that she is rekindling her relationship with her editor, Stathis Borans. She actually left to confront Stathis about a veiled threat, spurred by his jealousy of Seth, to publish the telepod story without her consent. While drunk, Seth teleports himself alone, unaware that a [[housefly]] had entered the transmitter pod with him. He emerges from the receiving pod seemingly normal.\n\nAfter Seth and Ronnie reconcile, Seth exhibits sugar cravings and increased strength, agility, stamina, and sexual potency, which he believes resulted from the teleportation \"purifying\" his body. Ronnie becomes increasingly concerned about Seth's deteriorating sanity, as well as strange, bristly hairs growing from a wound on his back and developing sores on his face. When she expresses her worries, Seth becomes aggressive, insisting that the process is beneficial. He tries to force Ronnie to undergo teleportation, but she refuses.\n\nSeth goes to a bar and partakes in an [[arm-wrestling]] match, leaving his opponent with a compound fracture. He brings a woman, Tawny, back to the warehouse, where they have sex. After that, Seth tries to coerce her into teleporting. However, Ronnie intervenes, and Seth throws her out. When his fingernails begin falling off, he realizes something is wrong. He checks his computer's records and discovers that the telepods confused the two lifeforms, fusing him with the fly at the molecular-genetic level.\n\nSeth continues to deteriorate, losing body parts along with his human appearance. After several weeks, he reconnects with Ronnie and reveals he is slowly becoming a hybrid creature that is neither human nor insect, which he has nicknamed \"Brundlefly.\" He has also begun vomiting [[digestive enzyme]]s onto his food before eating and is able to cling to walls and ceilings. He also discovers that he is losing his human reason and compassion and is now being driven by primitive impulses he cannot control.\n\nSeth installs a fusion program into the telepod computer, planning to dilute the fly [[gene]]s in his body with human [[DNA]]. Ronnie discovers she is pregnant with Seth's baby and has a nightmare of giving birth to a giant [[maggot]]. She demands that Stathis persuade a doctor to perform an abortion in the middle of the night, but Seth overhears Ronnie's fears and abducts her before the procedure occurs. He begs her to carry the child to term since it may be the last remnant of his humanity. Stathis breaks into Seth's lab with a shotgun, but Seth disables him using his corrosive vomit to destroy Stathis' hand and foot, stopping just short of vomiting acid onto his face when Ronnie screams at him to stop.\n\nSeth reveals his final plan to Ronnie: he will use the telepods to fuse the two of them, along with the unborn child, into a single entity to become \"the ultimate family.\" During a struggle, she accidentally tears off his jaw, which triggers his final transformation, shedding his decaying flesh to become a monstrous, insectoid-human creature.\n\nSeth traps Ronnie in the first telepod, puts himself in the other, and begins the countdown. A weakened Stathis recovers his shotgun and severs the cables connecting Ronnie's telepod to the computer. Seth breaks halfway out of his own pod, but the fusion process activates, gruesomely amalgamating him with a chunk of the telepod. Seth crawls to Ronnie and places the end of the shotgun to his head, silently begging her to end his suffering. Looking on at the creature that was once Seth Brundle, she tearfully fires, killing him instantly. She falls to her knees in despair.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as [[Seth Brundle]]\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Veronica \"Ronnie\" Quaife\n* [[John Getz]] as Stathis Borans\n* [[Joy Boushel]] as Tawny\n* [[Leslie Carlson]] as Dr. Brent Cheevers \n* [[George Chuvalo]] as Marky\n* [[David Cronenberg]] as a Gynecologist\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nIn the early 1980s, co-producer Kip Ohman approached screenwriter [[Charles Edward Pogue]] with the idea of remaking the classic science fiction horror film ''[[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]]''.<ref name=\"bloodydisgusting\">{{Cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3402730/the-fly-released-30-years-ago-today/ |title='The Fly' Was Released 30 Years Ago Today |last=Thurman |first=Trace |date=2016-09-15 |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=2017-10-04 |archive-date=2017-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005050708/http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3402730/the-fly-released-30-years-ago-today/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Pogue began by reading [[George Langelaan]]'s [[The Fly (George Langelaan)|short story]] and then watching the original film, which he had never seen. Deciding that this was a project in which he was interested, he talked with producer [[Stuart Cornfeld]] about setting up the production, and Cornfeld very quickly agreed.<ref name=\"fourthree\">{{Cite web |url= https://fourthreefilm.com/2016/08/the-fly-a-30-year-love-story/ |title=The Fly: A 30-Year Love Story |last=Westwood |first=Emma |date=2016-08-15 |website=4:3 |access-date=2017-10-04 |archive-date=2017-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005050719/https://fourthreefilm.com/2016/08/the-fly-a-30-year-love-story/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The duo then pitched the idea to executives at 20th Century Fox and received an enthusiastic response, and Pogue was given money to write a first draft screenplay. He initially wrote an outline similar to that of Langelaan's story, but both he and Cornfeld thought that it would be better to rework the material to focus on a gradual metamorphosis instead of an instantaneous monster. However, when executives read the script, they were so unimpressed that they immediately withdrew from the project. After some negotiation, Cornfeld orchestrated a deal whereby Fox would agree to distribute the film if he could set up financing through another source.<ref name= \"bloodydisgusting\" />\n\nThe new producer was [[Mel Brooks]];  the film was to be produced by his company, Brooksfilms. Cornfeld was a frequent collaborator and friend of Brooks. Together, they had produced [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]''.<ref name=\"fourthree\" /> (Brooks would leave his name off the film's credits, to avoid confusing viewers who might expect \"a Mel Brooks film\" to be a comedy.) Cornfeld gave the script to Brooks, who liked it but felt that a different writer was needed. Pogue was then removed from the project, and Cornfeld hired [[Walon Green]] for a rewrite. However, Green's draft was not a step in the  desired direction, so Pogue was then sought to polish the material.<ref name= \"bloodydisgusting\" /> At the same time, Brooks and Cornfeld were trying to find a suitable director. Their first choice was [[David Cronenberg]], but he was working on ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', an adaptation of the [[Philip K. Dick]] short story \"[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]\", for [[Dino De Laurentiis]], so he was unable to accept.<ref name=\"fourthree\" /> Cornfeld decided on a young British director named [[Robert Bierman]] after seeing one of his short films. Bierman was flown to Los Angeles to meet with Pogue, and the film was in the very early stages of preproduction when tragedy struck: Bierman's family had been vacationing in South Africa, and his daughter was killed in an accident.<ref name=\"fourthree\" /> Bierman boarded a plane to go to his family, and Brooks and Cornfeld waited for a month before approaching him about resuming work on the picture. Bierman told them that he was unable to start working so soon, and Brooks told him that he would wait three months and contact him again. At the end of the three months, Bierman told him that he could not commit to the project. Brooks told him that he understood and had freed him from his contract.\n\nCornfeld then heard that Cronenberg was no longer associated with ''Total Recall'' and re-approached him with ''The Fly''.<ref name=\"fourthree\" /> Cronenberg agreed to sign on as director if he would be allowed to rewrite the script.<ref name= \"autogenerated2005\">''Fear of The Flesh: The Making of'' The Fly, 20th Century Fox, 2005</ref><ref name= \"autogenerated1986\">{{cite magazine| title= The Fly Papers | first= Tim | last= Lucas| work= [[Cinefex]] Magazine| year= 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media| work= AMC Backstory | title= The Fly Papers: The Buzz on Hollywood's Scariest Insect | year= 2000| publisher= AMC}}</ref>\n\n; Pogue's draft\n\n<blockquote>Geoff and Barbara Powell are a happily married couple. Geoff, a brilliant scientist, has been working on a teleportation machine, but is unwilling to tell his employer, Phillip DeWitt, or his friend, Harry Chandler, about the nature of the project. DeWitt is greatly displeased by this, and threatens to pull his funding of the mystery project unless he is given full disclosure. After several failed experiments, such as a monkey's atoms never reintegrating after disintegration, Geoff eventually is successful in teleporting both inanimate and living objects. However, when he tries it on himself, a housefly slips into the booth with him. Seemingly normal at first, Geoff soon develops incredible strength, stamina, and energy. After sprouting fly-hairs and losing his fingernails, Geoff eventually discovers that the fly has been absorbed into his body, and that its cells are now taking over his own.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>As he slowly mutates into a giant fly, Geoff loses body parts, and becomes able to climb walls, as well as digest food with corrosive vomit. Barb is horrified to learn that she is pregnant by Geoff, and cannot be sure if the child was conceived before or after his teleportation. Eventually, Chandler discovers the teleporter's existence, reveals it to DeWitt, and demonstrates it on a cat, only to have the lost monkey atoms return from the ether and create a horrible \"monkey-cat\" creature, which DeWitt beats to death with a metal rod. Despite this failed experiment, DeWitt sees the substantial monetary value of the device, and so takes possession of the teleporter. Geoff (now mostly transformed into a fly-monster and unable to speak) learns of this, and goes to DeWitt's office building, followed by Barb. Geoff confronts DeWitt, starts a fire in the lab where the teleporter is now housed, and kills DeWitt by vomiting and feeding on him. He then traps himself in one of the teleportation booths just as Barb arrives to watch the fire kill him and destroy the teleporter\u2014his intent all along. In a coma, Barb dreams of giving birth to a giant maggot, only to wake up in a hospital, where it is revealed that she's given birth to a healthy baby boy.</blockquote>\n\n; Cronenberg's draft\n\n<blockquote>The revised script differed greatly from Pogue's screenplay, though it still retained the basic plot and the central concept of a gradual mutation. Cronenberg rewrote the characters and most of the dialogue from scratch (as well as fusing DeWitt and Chandler--who had romantic intentions toward Barb in the Pogue draft--into Stathis Borans), and carried over a few key moments and concepts. Certain aspects of the transformation from Pogue's draft (such as the hero's loss of body parts) were expanded upon, and Cronenberg also layered in his trademark themes of sexuality, body horror, and personal identity. He also made it a point to keep Seth Brundle as articulate as possible for as long as possible, as opposed to Pogue's draft, in which Geoff Powell loses his ability to speak two-thirds of the way through the script.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Seth Brundle's increasing mania and personality changes in the early stages of the transformation were emphasized in the rewrites, and the notion of the transformation itself being a horrible (and very metaphorical) disease became a key factor in the new script. Also, in this version, Brundle was clearly transforming into a bizarre hybrid creature as the result of a genetic fusion, whereas in Pogue's version, Powell was being taken over by the fly's cells, which had been absorbed into his body (thus slowly transforming him literally into a giant fly, rather than Brundle's deformed man-fly mixture). Cronenberg's version also retained such moments as Brundle catching a fly in mid-air, the fingernail-pulling, and the maggot-baby dream (which was moved to an earlier point in the story, and used for thematic and plot purposes rather than as an end-of-film shock moment).</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The \"monkey-cat\" of Pogue's script was repurposed by Cronenberg into a twisted, desperate attempt by Brundle to find a cure, and Pogue's sequence of a fly leg hatching from Geoff's side was taken one step further, with Brundle amputating the twitching limb with his teeth. Pogue's script also featured a [[wikt:bag lady|bag lady]] being murdered by Geoff in an alley, and Cronenberg revised this so that the woman was killed by vomit-drop (as with DeWitt's murder at the end of the original draft) rather than Geoff cutting her throat accidentally (however, Cronenberg never filmed his version of this sequence, which was written out of the final shooting script). While Cronenberg's script did not end with Veronica Quaife giving birth, it did end with a coda which revealed that she was pregnant with a normal baby, conceived by Borans after Brundle's death (and the abortion of Brundle's possibly tainted fetus).</blockquote>\n\nDespite the extensive rewrite of Pogue's script, Cronenberg insisted during [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] arbitrations that he and Pogue share screenplay credit, since he felt that his version could not have come to pass without Pogue's script to serve as a foundation.<ref name= \"autogenerated2005\"/>\n\nWith a script that everyone approved of, Cronenberg assembled his usual crew and began the process of casting the picture. [[John Lithgow]] was offered the role of Seth Brundle but turned it down, stating it was too grotesque;<ref>{{Cite web| url= https://www.indiewire.com/2014/05/john-lithgow-says-he-turned-down-david-cronenbergs-the-fly-because-it-was-icky-and-grotesque-86380/| title= John Lithgow Says He Turned Down David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' Because It Was 'Icky' And 'Grotesque'| website= indiewire.com |date= May 5, 2014}}</ref> ultimately deciding on [[Jeff Goldblum]] and [[Geena Davis]] for the leads. [[Chris Walas]], who had designed the creatures in ''[[Gremlins]]'', was hired to handle the film's extensive special effects. Principal photography began on December 1, 1985, in [[Toronto]].\n\nThe producers commissioned musician [[Bryan Ferry]] to record a song for the film for promotional purposes. The resulting track was \"Help Me\". A [[music video]] was made for the song, and footage from the film was prominently featured in it. Cronenberg admitted to liking the song, but he felt that it was inappropriate to the film itself. Brooks and Cornfeld originally wanted to play the song over the closing credits, but after Cronenberg screened it for them, they agreed with the director that it did not mesh with the movie. As a result, the song is featured only briefly in the film, in the background during the scene where Brundle challenges Marky in the bar. \"Help Me\" became rather obscure, as it was not included on the film's soundtrack release. The song resurfaced in 1993 on the [[Roxy Music]]/Bryan Ferry [[compact disc]] ''Ultimate Collection''.<ref name= \"autogenerated3\">{{cite AV media| work= The Fly| title= DVD audio commentary | publisher= 20th Century Fox | year= 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe design of Brundle's telepods was inspired by the engine cylinder of Cronenberg's [[Ducati 750 Imola Desmo|Ducati Desmo]] motorcycle.<ref>{{cite AV media| last= Cronenberg | first= David | year=2010| work= The Fly| title= Blu-ray Commentary| publisher= Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment LLC| location= Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n===Deleted and alternate scenes===\nAfter filming ended early in 1986, a rough cut of ''The Fly'' was shown to Fox executives, who were very impressed. A rough cut was then previewed at Toronto's [[Uptown Theatre (Toronto)|Uptown Theatre]] in the spring of that year. Due to a strong audience reaction, the graphic and infamous \"monkey-cat\" sequence was cut from the film to make it easier for audiences to maintain sympathy for Brundle's character. Another preview screening was subsequently held at the Fox lot in [[Los Angeles]], and this version featured the \"butterfly baby\" coda. As before, the screening results dictated that the scene be cut.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/>\n\n===Makeup and creature effects===\n[[File:BrundleStages.JPG|thumb|right|The different stages of Seth Brundle's gradual transformation into \"Brundlefly\"]]\nThe [[Academy Award]]-winning makeup was designed and executed by [[Chris Walas]], Inc. over a period of three months. The final \"Brundlefly\" creature was designed first, and then the various steps needed to carry protagonist Seth Brundle to that final incarnation were designed afterwards. The transformation was intended to be a metaphor for the aging process. To that end, Brundle loses hair, teeth and fingernails, with his skin becoming more and more discolored and lumpy. The intention of the filmmakers was to give Brundle a bruised and cancerous look that gets progressively worse as the character's altered genome slowly asserts itself, with the final Brundlefly hybrid creature literally bursting out of Brundle's hideously deteriorated human skin. The creature itself was designed to appear horribly asymmetrical and deformed, and not at all a viable or robust organism.\n\nVarious looks were tested for the makeup effects. Some early test footage can be seen on the 2005 ''The Fly'': Collector's Edition DVD, as well as the Blu-ray release.\n\nThe transformation was broken up into seven distinct stages, with Jeff Goldblum spending many hours in the makeup chair for Brundle's later incarnations.<ref name=\"autogenerated1986\"/>\n:\n\n* Stages 1 and 2: subtle, rash-like skin discoloration that leads to facial lesions and sores, with tiny fly hairs dotting Goldblum's face, in addition to the patch of fly hairs growing out of the wound on Brundle's back.\n* Stages 3 and 4-A: piecemeal prosthetics covering Goldblum's face (and later his arms, feet, and torso), wigs with bald spots, and crooked, prosthetic teeth (beginning with stage 4-A).\n* Stage 4-B: deleted from the film, this variant of stage 4 was seen only in the \"monkey-cat\" scene, and required Goldblum to wear the first of two full-body foam latex suits, as Brundle has stopped wearing clothing, at this point.\n* Stage 5: the second full-body suit, with more exaggerated deformities, and which also required Goldblum to wear distorting contact lenses that made one eye look larger than the other.\n* Stage 6: the final \"Brundlefly\" creature (referred to as the \"space bug\" by the film's crew), depicted by various partial and full-body cable- and rod-controlled puppets.\n* Stage 7: another puppet which represented the mortally injured Brundlefly-Telepod fusion creature (initially dubbed the \"Brundlebooth\" and later the \"Brundlething\" by the crew) as seen in the film's final moments.\n\n== Music ==\nThe score to ''The Fly'' was composed and conducted by [[Howard Shore]], and performed by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. It was released on record, cassette and compact disc (with three additional tracks exclusively included on the latter) by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]], and in 2005 was remastered and reissued on a two-disc set with [[Christopher Young]]'s album for ''[[The Fly II]]''.\n\nTitles in '''bold''' are exclusive to the CD release.

Despite being a gory remake of a classic made by a controversial, non-mainstream director, the film was a commercial success, the biggest of Cronenberg's career, and was the top-grossing film in the United States for two weeks, earning a total domestic gross of $40,456,565. Audiences reacted strongly to the graphic creature effects and the tragic love story, and the film received much attention at the time of its release. Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |access-date=2022-06-09 |website=CinemaScore |language=en-US}}{{nonspecific|date=August 2022}}</ref>\n\nCronenberg was surprised when ''The Fly'' was seen by some critics as a cultural metaphor for [[AIDS]], since he originally intended the film to be a more general analogy for disease itself, terminal conditions like cancer and, more specifically, the aging process:{{blockquote|If you, or your lover, has AIDS, you watch that film and of course you'll see AIDS in it, but you don't have to have that experience to respond emotionally to the movie and I think that's really its power.

The song is inspired by the 1986 film.\n\n==Other media==\n===Sequel===\n{{Main|The Fly II}}\nWhereas the [[The Fly (1958 film)|1958 original]] was followed by two sequels, Cronenberg has said that the stories in his films have definitive beginnings and endings, and he has never considered making a sequel to one of his own films, although others have made sequels to Cronenberg films, including ''[[Scanners]]'' (1981).\n\n\n''The Fly II'' (1989) was directed by Chris Walas, the man behind the makeup and creature effects of both films and ''Gremlins''. It is a direct continuation of ''The Fly''. It features Veronica Quaife giving birth to Brundle's mutant son before dying, and it focuses on the Bartok company's attempts to get the Telepods working again.\n\nDavid Cronenberg was not involved with the project. The only actor to return for the sequel was John Getz as an embittered Stathis Borans. Veronica Quaife appears briefly in the film. She is played by [[Saffron Henderson]], since Geena Davis declined to reprise the role. Jeff Goldblum appears in archival footage of Seth Brundle in two scenes, including the post-teleportation interview segment that was deleted from the first film.\n\nAn early treatment for a sequel, written by [[Tim Lucas]], involved Veronica Quaife dealing with the evils of the Bartok company. Brundle's consciousness had somehow survived within the Telepod computer, and the Bartok scientists had enslaved him and were using him to develop the system for [[Cloning#In popular culture|cloning]] purposes. Brundle becomes able to communicate with Veronica through the computer, and he eventually takes control of the Bartok complex's security systems to gruesomely attack the villains. Eventually, Veronica frees Brundle by conspiring with him to reintegrate a non-contaminated version of his original body. Cronenberg endorsed this concept at the time. Geena Davis was open to doing a sequel (and only pulled out of ''The Fly II'' because her character was to be killed in the opening scene), while Goldblum was not (although he determined a cameo appearance was acceptable), and this treatment reflects that.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://videowatchdog.blogspot.com/2016/06/the-story-behind-flies-my-lost-fly.html|title= The Story Behind FLIES - My 'Lost' FLY Sequel |first= Tim |last= Lucas |date=June 20, 2016| work= Video Watchdog| access-date=March 23, 2017|archive-date=March 24, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170324084049/http://videowatchdog.blogspot.com/2016/06/the-story-behind-flies-my-lost-fly.html|url-status= live}}</ref> However, a later treatment written by Jim and Ken Wheat was used as the basis for the final script, written by [[Frank Darabont]].

Cronenberg stated that he had written not a remake, but rather a \"sort of\" sequel script to his 1986 version, and would film it if [[20th Century Fox]] gave the project the go-ahead: \n{{blockquote|I have written a script that is more of a strange lateral, let's say oblique sequel than it is a true sequel, and it's certainly not a remake of the original. It's financed by Fox, and whether it will get made or not, I cannot say at the moment because there are a lot of up-in-the-air factors that deal with internal studio politics and a bunch of other things that I'm not in control of. But I would make it if they greenlight it, let's put it that way.}}\n\nCronenberg elaborated further when interviewed by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' in 2012: \n{{blockquote|Well, I did talk to Fox, because my agent found out that they were approaching people to do a remake of my film. He sort of said, \"Well, you know, what about David?\" And they said, \"Well, we never thought of that!\" I think they'd been to [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Michael Bay]]. I said, \"Long ago I proposed a sequel to Mel Brooks when he said he wanted to make a sequel.\" He didn't like what I proposed because he said it wasn't the same as the original movie. \"A sequel,\" he said, \"should be more of the same.\" And I said, \"Well, Mel, then I'm not interested.\" And he went off and did his sequels [sic] and they had nothing to do with me and they weren't very successful. But I still had this idea in mind\u2014which no, I won't tell you\u2014and I said to Fox, \"I'll write that idea up because, as I think of it, it could be interesting.\" And they were excited about it enough to pay me to write a script. And then for various reasons it kind of got bogged down. I don't know exactly why. It seems now that it's not going to happen. But it's a script that I like and would do. It's not exactly a sequel, and it's certainly not a remake.

However, what was in it that attracted them could not be done low-budget.
