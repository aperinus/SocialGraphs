The supporting cast features [[Tony Randall]], [[Thelma Ritter]], [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]], [[Allen Jenkins]], [[Marcel Dalio]] and [[Lee Patrick (actress)|Lee Patrick]]. The film was written by [[Russell Rouse]], [[Maurice Richlin]], [[Stanley Shapiro]], and [[Clarence Greene]].\n\nIt tells the story of Jan Morrow (Day), an interior decorator and Brad Allen (Hudson), a womanizing composer/bachelor, who share a telephone [[Party line (telephony)|party line]]. When she unsuccessfully files a complaint on him for constantly using the line to woo his conquests, Brad decides to take a chance on Jan by masquerading as a Texas rancher, resulting in the two falling in love. The scheme seems to work until Brad's mutual friend and Jan's client Jonathan Forbes (Randall) finds out about this, causing a love triangle in the process.\n\nAccording to a \"Rambling Reporter\" (August 28, 1959) item in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] originally bought the script by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene in 1942, but since it was not produced, the writers bought it back in 1945. In 1947, they sold it as a play, but bought it back once again four years later, finally selling it in 1958 to Arwin Productions, the company owned by Doris Day's husband, [[Martin Melcher]]. Although the film was originally titled ''Pillow Talk'', according to a February 2, 1959 \"Rambling Reporter\" item in ''The Hollywood Reporter'', the title \"displeased\" the [[Production Code Administration|PCA]], and was changed to ''[[Any Way the Wind Blows (1958 song)|Any Way the Wind Blows]]''. In August 1959, however, the original title was reinstated.\n\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Doris Day), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] (Thelma Ritter), [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color]] ([[Richard H.

She lives alone and claims to be quite happy, when questioned on that subject by her drunken housekeeper, Alma. The only irritant in her life is the [[Party line (telephony)|party line]] that she shares with Brad Allen, a talented, creative Broadway composer and playboy who lives in a nearby apartment building. She is unable to obtain a private phone line because the telephone company has been overwhelmed by the recent demand for new phone lines in the area.\n\nJan and Brad, who have only ever \"met\" on the telephone, develop a feud over the use of the party line. Brad is constantly using the phone to chat with one young woman after another, singing to each of them an \"original\" love song supposedly written just for her, though he only changes the name or language he sings in. Jan and Brad bicker over the party line, with Brad suggesting that the single Jan is jealous of his popularity.\n\nOne of Jan's clients is millionaire Jonathan Forbes, who repeatedly throws himself at her to no avail. Unknown to Jan, Jonathan is also Brad's old college buddy and his current Broadway benefactor.\n\nOne evening in a nightclub, Brad finally sees Jan dancing and learns who she is. Attracted to her, he fakes a Texan accent and invents a new persona: Rex Stetson, a wealthy Texas rancher. He succeeds in wooing Jan, and the pair begin seeing each other regularly. Jan cannot resist bragging about her new beau on the phone to Brad, while Brad teases Jan by having \"Rex\" show an interest in effeminate things, thereby implying \"Rex's\" homosexuality.<ref name='cohan'>{{cite book |last = Cohan |first = Steven |title = Masked Men: Masculinity and the Movies in the Fifties |chapter = The Bachelor in the Bedroom |editor-first = Patricia |editor-last = Mellencamp |publisher = Indiana University Press |date = December 1997 |location = Bloomington |pages = 296\u2013300 |isbn = 978-0253332974 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Jonathan discovers about Brad's masquerade, he forces Brad to leave New York City and go to Jonathan's cabin in Connecticut to complete his new songs. Brad invites Jan to join him. Once there, romance blossoms until Jan stumbles upon a copy of \"Rex's\" sheet music. She plunks the melody on the nearby piano and recognizes Brad's song. She confronts Brad and ignores his attempts at explanation, returning to New York with Jonathan, who has just arrived at the cabin.\n\nBack in New York, Jonathan is pleased to learn that the playboy has finally fallen in love, while conversely Jan will have nothing to do with Brad. Brad turns to Jan's housekeeper, Alma, for advice. Alma, pleased to finally meet Brad after listening in on the party line for so long, suggests he hire Jan to decorate his apartment so they will be forced to collaborate. Jan only concedes so that her employer will not lose the commission. Brad leaves all the design decisions up to Jan, telling her only to design a place that she would want to live in herself.\n\nStill resentful at his deception, Jan decorates Brad's apartment in the most gaudy and hideous decor she can muster. Horrified by what he finds, Brad angrily storms into Jan's apartment and carries her in her pajamas through the street back to his apartment to explain herself. He tells her of all the changes he has made to end his bachelor lifestyle because he thought they were getting married. Her face lights up and, as he leaves in anger, she uses one of his \"playboy\" remote control switches to lock the door. She flips the second switch and the player piano pounds out a honky-tonk version of Brad's standard love song. He turns around, their eyes meet, and they lovingly embrace.\n\nAt the end of the film, Brad goes to tell Jonathan that he is going to be a father, only to be pulled by Dr. Maxwell (an obstetrician) and Nurse Resnick into their office for an examination, when he says that he is going to have a baby (a reference to when he ducks into Dr. Maxwell's office in an earlier scene to hide from Jan, but escapes before they can examine him).\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Rock Hudson]] as Brad Allen\n* [[Doris Day]] as Jan Morrow\n* [[Tony Randall]] as Jonathan Forbes\n* [[Thelma Ritter]] as Alma\n* [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]] as Tony Walters\n* Perry Blackwell as Perry\n* Karen Norris as Miss Dickenson\n* [[Julia Meade]] as Marie\n* [[Allen Jenkins]] as Harry\n* [[Marcel Dalio]] as Mr. Pierot\n* [[Lee Patrick (actress)|Lee Patrick]] as Mrs. Walters\n* Mary McCarty as Nurse Resnick\n* Alex Gerry as Dr. Maxwell\n* [[Hayden Rorke]] as Mr. Conrad\n* Valerie Allen as Eileen\n* [[Jacqueline Beer]] as Yvette\n* Arlen Stuart as Tilda\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n\nThe film's script was turned down and bought back by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] a few times in the late 1940s and early 1950s until Martin Melcher (the husband of Doris Day at the time) and his Arwin Productions label bought the script and took it to [[Universal Pictures Company|Universal]].<ref name=\"AFI\" /><ref name=\"tcm.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4363/Pillow-Talk/|title=Pillow Talk}}</ref><ref name=\"connolly\">{{cite news |last = Connolly |first = Mike |title = Rambling Reporter |work = Hollywood Reporter |date = August 28, 1959 |page = 2 }}</ref> According to Day in [[A.E.

Hunter identified Day's potential to be sexy, and recruited legendary costume designer [[Jean Louis]], who designed 18 or 24 costumes for Day to wear.<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref name=\"tcm.com\"/> Hunter said to Day, \"You are sexy, Doris, and it's about time you dealt with it...if you allow me to get Jean Louis to do your clothes, I mean a really sensational wardrobe that will show off that wild fanny of yours, and get some wonderful makeup on you, and chic you up and get a great hairdo that lifts you, why, every secretary and every housewife will say, 'Look at that\u2014look what Doris has done to herself. Maybe I can do the same thing'\".<ref>{{harvp|Day|Hotchner|1976|p=. 200}}.</ref> Day acknowledged that the film transformed her image from \"the girl next door\" to classy sex symbol, describing that the plot, for the time, was very sexy, involving a climactic scene in which the leading man carries her out of bed in her pajamas and out into the streets.<ref>{{harvp|Day|Hotchner|1976|p=}}.{{page needed|date=May 2019}}</ref> In addition, Laykin et Cie lent $500,000 worth of jewels for Day to wear.<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref name=\"tcm.com\"/>\n\nThis is Hudson's first comedy film, after a slew of dramas that he made throughout the 1950s including ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'' (1956) and ''A Farewell to Arms'' (1957). It was Hunter who saw Hudson's potential to do comedy. The advice he received from director Michael Gordon was \"Comedy is the most serious tragedy in the world. Play it that way and you can't go wrong. If you ever think of yourself as funny, you haven't got a chance.\" On February 2, 1959, Thelma Ritter was cast as Alma, Jan's housekeeper, while Lee Patrick was cast as Mrs. Walters the following month.<ref>{{cite news |title = Lee Patrick in 'Wind' |work = The Hollywood Reporter |date = April 2, 1959 |page = 2 }}</ref><ref name=\"connolly\"/> Hope Emerson was recruited by Hunter to play an Indian princess called \"Dessert Flower\" in the film.<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref name=\"tcm.com\"/><ref name=\"connolly\"/> She does not appear in the final cut. A cameo appearance by Day's friend and actress Miriam Nelson occurs in the scene where Brad ducks into Dr. Maxwell's (the obstetrician) office to avoid running into Jan.<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref name=\"tcm.com\"/> Nelson was given the walk-on part as a patient in the waiting room so she could have lunch with Day in the commissary.<ref>{{cite book |last = Kaufman |first = David |title = Doris Day: The Untold Story of the Girl Next Door |location = New York |publisher = Virgin USA |year = 2008 |page = 257 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n\nAccording to Hudson, the final scene, in which Brad storms into Jan's apartment and yanks her out of bed, and carries her through the streets of Manhattan, back to his re-decorated apartment, was actually shot first. Due to back problems, Hudson carried Day on a shelf with her sheets and blankets over her to get through the many takes. According to Hudson, \"I could have managed if only one take had been involved, but we went on endlessly, primarily because there was a bit actor who played a cop on the street, and as we passed him Doris' line was 'Officer, arrest this man,' and the cop was supposed to say to me, 'How you doing, Brad?' but that stupid actor kept calling me Rock (01:39:36). So back to our marks we went for another take and another and another. I'll bet we did that scene twenty times. That's why the shelf for Doris to sit on.\" Also, Hudson related that when he pulled Doris Day out of bed, he forgot to let go of her ankles \"\u2026with the result that my leading lady crashed to the floor.\"<ref>{{harvp|Kaufman|2008|p= 256}}.</ref>\n\nDay and Hudson developed chemistry during filming and the cast and crew acted as if they were family. Hudson recalled that, as per a ''[[Modern Screen]]'' article, \"they had to add a week on to the shooting schedule because we could not stop laughing\".<ref>{{harvp|Kaufman|2008|p=258}}.</ref> Day clarified this during interviews she had with [[Merv Griffin]] on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' and [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' (1976), during her 1976 press tour to promote her biography ''Doris Day: Her Own Story'' by A.E. Hotchner.  \"Every day on the set was a picnic\u2014sometimes too much of a picnic, in that we took turns at breaking each other up.\"<ref name=\"Day-195\"/> According to an article in the October 1959 issue of ''Saturday Review'', [[Jean Louis]] designed 24 costumes for Doris Day and Laykin et Cie loaned the production $500,000 worth of jewels.<ref name=\"AFI\"/><ref name=\"tcm.com\"/> The film is notable for its usage of split-screens during which Jan and Brad/Rex have telephone conversations. Triple split-screens are featured at the beginning of the film when Brad is using the party line to flirt with Eileen and Yvette.\n\n==Songs==\nDay sings three songs in the film: \"Pillow Talk\" during the opening credits, \"Roly Poly\" in the piano bar with Blackwell and Hudson, and \"Possess Me\" on the drive up to Jonathan's cabin. Singer Perry Blackwell performs three songs in the piano bar: \"I Need No Atmosphere\", \"Roly Poly\" (in part), and \"You Lied\"\u2014a song directed at Hudson's character, Brad. Hudson sings \"Inspiration\" in the film to three of his conquests: Eileen, Yvette and Marie. It then becomes an instrumental motif to represent Brad and his playboy ways: when the telephone inspector comes to interview Brad (00:13:24), when Brad calls Jan to apologize for his behavior and ask her on a date (00:26:26) and when Jan realizes that \"Rex\" was Brad the whole time after discovering the sheet music of the song and playing its notes on the piano in Jonathan's home during their stay in Connecticut (01:17:54). For their commercial releases, Doris Day recorded the title song for [[Columbia Records]] and Rock Hudson recorded \"Roly Poly\" and the title song for [[Decca Records]].\n\n==Release==\n\n===Promotions===\nUniversal's efforts to promote the film were significant. The studio sponsored press tours by the cast, director and producers in cities across the United States throughout the late summer and early fall of 1959. Promotional materials included original production photos and press material (a copy of which is available at the New York Public Library for Performing Arts at [[Lincoln Center]]), print advertisements and recordings sent to radio stations with Day and Hudson narrating introductions to audio clips from the film.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/is8jcCbUchA Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20131114072832/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is8jcCbUchA Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite AV media | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is8jcCbUchA| title = PILLOW TALK Movie- Radio Spot Announcements 1959 | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Also, Hudson recorded a voice message that would play when people called a number given by K-B's Ontario Theatre in local newspaper and magazine ads for the film. Even though the number was only expected to receive about 60,000 calls daily, it was so successful it wound up receiving twice that many, or 120,000 calls a day.<ref>{{cite news |title = Phone Co: In Yelp at P.A.

In the United States, the posters were clean and non-explicit, with no trace of the film's verbal and visual innuendo. Consistent with the European Foreign-Language films being introduced in the states, the ads running in Europe were more explicit. For example, the Danish release poster features an illustration of Doris Day in the bathtub from a high-angle, showing the water inside and giving a sexy appearance.\n\n===Premieres===\nProducer Ross Hunter convinced Sol Schwartz, owner of the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] on Broadway, to book ''Pillow Talk'' for a two-week run following its premiere on October 6, 1959.<ref>{{harvp|Day|Hotchner|1976|pp= 200-201}}.</ref><ref name=\"nyt oct 6\">{{cite news |date = October 6, 1959 |title = Of Local Origin |journal = [[The New York Times]] |page = 45 }}</ref> Cast members Hudson and Day attended the event with celebrities, including [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Tallulah Bankhead]].

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote \"A nice, old-fashioned device of the theatre, the telephone party line, serves as a quaint convenience to bring together Rock Hudson and Doris Day in what must be cheerfully acknowledged one of the most lively and up-to-date comedy-romances of the year.\"<ref name=\"NY Times\"/> ''Variety'' described the film as \"dripping with the trappings of glamor.

She schemes to get Brad back while Brad does a scam of his own. According to [[David Kaufman (author)|David Kaufman's]] biography ''Doris Day: The Untold Story of the Girl Next Door'', Day was enthusiastic about the project and wanted to be involved. Hudson also expressed interest in returning. Ross Hunter was set to produce again, with [[Delbert Mann]] (who directed Day and Hudson in ''Lover Come Back'') directing the script written by Bruce Kane. Despite making changes according to Day's wishes and getting approval from Universal to make the sequel, the project did not materialize; Day's retirement was one of the reasons.<ref>{{harvp|Kaufman|2008|pp=511-512}}.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1959]]\n* ''[[Down with Love]]'', an homage 2003 film that contains elements of ''Pillow Talk'' (with [[Tony Randall]] himself making a cameo)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*''Pillow Talk'' essay [https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation-board/documents/pillow_talk.pdf] by [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] at the [[National Film Registry]]\n* {{IMDb title|0053172|Pillow Talk}}\n* {{tcmdb title|4363|Pillow Talk}}\n* {{Allmovie title|38140|Pillow Talk}}\n* {{AFI film|id=52988|title=Pillow Talk}}\n* {{mojo title|pillowtalk|Pillow Talk}}\n* [http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/read_better.php?___f=preview&ID=36906&___r=%2Freviews%2Flogin%2Freviews.php%3FrecordState%3DApproved Production notes and theories about ''Pillow Talk'']\n* [http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/24/pillowtalk1.html Article on ''Pillow Talk''] - ''Bright Lights Film Journal''\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150821022100/http://www.dorisday.net/pillow_talk.html Article on ''Pillow Talk''] - DorisDay.Net\n* [http://rockhudsonblog.com/2011/01/03/pillow-talk-premiere/ ''Pillow Talk'' Movie Premiere] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304183038/http://rockhudsonblog.com/2011/01/03/pillow-talk-premiere |date=March 4, 2016 }} - RockHudsonBlog.com\n* ''Pillow Talk'' essay by Daniel Eagan In America's Film Legacy, 2009-2010: A Viewer's Guide To The 50 Landmark Movies Added To The National Film Registry In 2009-10, Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2011, {{ISBN|1441120025}} pages 99\u2013102 [https://www.google.com/books/edition/America_s_Film_Legacy_2009_2010/4GNRD_icEmkC?hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiK6oeJ8PfqAhXXgXIEHRqMA68QiKUDMBd6BAgUEAQ]\n\n{{Michael Gordon}}\n{{Ross Hunter}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pillow Talk (Film)}}\n[[Category:1959 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1950s sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:1959 films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sex comedy films]]\n[[Category:CinemaScope films]]\n[[Category:1950s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Michael Gordon]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Ross Hunter]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Frank De Vol]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films about telephony]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Photoplay Awards film of the year winners]]\n[[Category:1950s American films]]"}]}}}}
