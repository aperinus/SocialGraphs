Filming began in September 1985 and finished in November, featuring [[List of Chicago Landmarks|many Chicago landmarks]] including the then [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]], [[Wrigley Field]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

His parents believe he is ill, though his sister Jeannie does not. After learning Ferris stayed home for the day, the [[Dean (education)|Dean of Students]] Ed Rooney is determined to expose Ferris's repeat [[truancy]]. Ferris persuades his [[Hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]] best friend Cameron Frye to help excuse Ferris's girlfriend Sloane Peterson from school on the grounds that her grandmother died. To complete the ruse that Sloane's father is picking her up from school, Ferris borrows Cameron's father's 1961 [[Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder]]. Cameron, who is afraid of his father's wrath, is dismayed when Ferris decides to take the car on a day trip into Chicago. Ferris promises they will return the car as it was, including preserving the original [[odometer]] mileage.\n\nThe trio leave the car with parking attendants, who promptly go on a long joyride. The three explore the city, with Ferris taking care to stay out of view from his father. They visit a museum, use deception to dine at an upscale restaurant, go to a baseball game, and attend the [[Von Steuben Day]] Parade, with Ferris jumping on a [[Float (parade)|float]] and performing.\n\nRooney prowls the Bueller home for Ferris, becoming victim to several [[pratfall]]s. Jeannie skips class and returns home to confront Ferris, but finds Rooney instead. Shocked by his appearance, she knocks him unconscious and calls the police. Rooney regains consciousness and leaves, with the police arresting Jeannie for making a false report.  \n\nUpon collecting the Ferrari and heading home, Ferris and Cameron discover that the car's mileage has gone up significantly. Cameron becomes semi-catatonic from shock, but wakes up after falling into a pool. Back at Cameron's house, Ferris jacks up the car and runs it in reverse to [[Odometer fraud|rewind the odometer]]. The odometer fails to rewind, and Cameron damages the car beyond repair out of anger over his domineering father. Ferris offers to take the blame for the now destroyed car, but Cameron declines, deciding to stand up to his father.\n\nAfter walking Sloane home, Ferris realizes his parents will be returning soon. As he races on foot through the neighborhood, he is nearly hit by Jeannie, who is driving their mother home. Jeannie sees Ferris, and fails to get her mother to notice him. Ferris makes it home first, but Rooney confronts him before he can get back inside. Seeing Ferris through the window, Jeannie has a change of heart and allows Ferris to come inside. As Rooney flees from Ferris's [[Rottweiler]], Ferris rushes back to his bedroom to await his parents. They find him in bed and believe he has been there all day.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Matthew Broderick.jpg|thumb|175px|alt=A black and white photo of young man with dark hair and a moustache|right|Broderick in Sweden during his promotion of ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off'', June 1986]]\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Matthew Broderick]] as Ferris Bueller, a high school senior\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as Cameron Frye, Ferris' best friend\n* [[Mia Sara]] as Sloane Peterson, Ferris' girlfriend\n* [[Jeffrey Jones]] as Ed Rooney, the Dean of Students\n* [[Jennifer Grey]] as Jeanie Bueller, Ferris' sister\n* [[Cindy Pickett]] as Katie Bueller, Ferris' mother\n* [[Lyman Ward (actor)|Lyman Ward]] as Tom Bueller, Ferris' father\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as School secretary\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Boy in police station\n* [[Ben Stein]] as Economics teacher\n* [[Del Close]] as English teacher\n* [[Virginia Capers]] as Florence Sparrow \n* [[Richard Edson]] as Garage attendant\n* [[Larry Flash Jenkins]] as Attendant's co-pilot\n* [[Kristy Swanson]] as Economics student\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Economics student\n* [[T.

Ferris flexes his hand in pain after supposedly catching the foul ball. During this scene, the characters enjoy the game and joke about what they would be doing if they had played by the rules. All these \"in the park\" shots, including the one from the previous scene where Ferris catches the foul ball on TV, were filmed on September 24, 1985, at a game between the [[1985 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] and the Cubs. During the [[1985 Major League Baseball season|1985 season]], the Braves and the Expos both wore powder blue uniforms during their road games so, with seamless editing by Hirsch, it is difficult to distinguish that the game being seen and described in the pizza joint is not only a different game but also a different Cubs' opponent than the one filmed inside the stadium.<ref>{{cite web |author=Larry Granillo |title=Ferris Bueller Follow-up |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=12899 |publisher=Baseball Prospectus |date=2011-02-08 |access-date=2011-02-10 |archive-date=February 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212144424/http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=12899 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 2011, Wrigley Field celebrated the 25th anniversary of the film by showing it on three giant screens on the infield.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/7048417/ferris-bueller-returns-wrigley-field |title=Ferris Bueller returns to Wrigley Field |publisher=ESPN |date=2011-10-01 |access-date=2014-07-19 |archive-date=August 8, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808143714/http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/7048417/ferris-bueller-returns-wrigley-field |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nSeveral [[Deleted scene|scenes were cut from the final film]]; one lost scene titled \"[[Islets of Langerhans|The Isles of Langerhans]]\" has the three teenagers trying to order in the French restaurant, shocked to discover [[pancreas]] on the menu (although in the finished film, Ferris still says, \"We ate pancreas,\u201d while recapping the day).

But neither of us found a very exciting hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life.\"<ref name=\"hughesactors\" /> \"''Ferris Bueller'' is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school\u2014 in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another,\" Broderick added.\n\n\"But just for fun,\" said Ruck, \"I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do ''Ferris Bueller Returns'' and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really need to be there, but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, at the end of the movie, Cameron dies.\"<ref name=\"bratpackbook\" />\n\nIn August 2022, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[interquel]] film entitled ''Sam & Victor's Day Off'', was announced to be in development for the [[streaming service]] [[Paramount+]].
