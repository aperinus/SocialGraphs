The film was directed by [[David Lynch]], produced by [[Mel Brooks]] (who was uncredited, to avoid audiences anticipating the film being in the vein of his comedic works, although his company Brooksfilms is in the opening credits) and [[Jonathan Sanger]], and stars [[John Hurt]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Anne Bancroft]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Wendy Hiller]], [[Michael Elphick]], [[Hannah Gordon]] and [[Freddie Jones]]. ''The Elephant Man'' is generally regarded as one of Lynch's more accessible and mainstream works, alongside ''[[The Straight Story]]'' (1999).\n\nThe screenplay was adapted by Lynch, Christopher De Vore and [[Eric Bergren]] from [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]]'s ''The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences'' (1923) and [[Ashley Montagu]]'s ''The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity'' (1971). It was shot in [[black-and-white]] and featured make-up work by [[Christopher Tucker]].\n\n''The Elephant Man'' was a critical and commercial success with eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. After receiving widespread criticism for failing to honour the make-up effects, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] was prompted to create the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup]] the following year. The film also won the [[BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and was nominated for [[Golden Globe]] awards. It also won a French [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for Best Foreign Film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nFrederick Treves, a [[surgeon]] at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]], finds John Merrick in a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[freak show]] in London's [[East End of London|East End]], where he is kept by Mr. Bytes, the brutish ringmaster. His head is kept hooded, and his \"owner\", who views him as [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], is paid by Treves to bring him to the hospital for examination. Treves presents Merrick to his colleagues and highlights his deformed skull, which forces him to sleep with his head on his knees, since if he were to lie down, he would [[asphyxia]]te. On Merrick's return, he is beaten so badly by Bytes that he has to call Treves for medical help. Treves brings him back to the hospital.\n\nMerrick is tended to by hospital matron Mrs. Mothershead, as the other nurses are too frightened of him. Mr. Carr Gomm, the hospital's Governor, is against housing Merrick, as the hospital does not accept \"incurables.\" To prove that Merrick can make progress, Treves trains him to say a few conversational sentences. Carr Gomm sees through this ruse, but as he is leaving, Merrick begins to recite the [[Psalm 23|23rd Psalm]] and continues past the part of the Psalm that Treves taught him. Merrick tells the doctors that he knows how to read, and has memorized the 23rd Psalm because it is his favorite. Carr Gomm permits him to stay, and Merrick spends his time practicing conversation with Treves and building a model of a cathedral he sees from his window.\n\nMerrick has tea with Treves and his wife, and is so overwhelmed by their kindness, he shows them his mother's picture. He believes he must have been a \"disappointment\" to his mother, but hopes she would be proud to see him with his \"lovely friends\". Merrick begins to take guests in his rooms, including the actress Madge Kendal, who introduces him to the work of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].  Merrick quickly becomes an object of curiosity to high society, and Mrs. Mothershead expresses concerns that he is still being put on display as a freak. Treves begins to question the morality of his own actions. Meanwhile, a night porter named Jim starts selling tickets to locals, who come at night to gawk at the \"Elephant Man\".\n\nThe issue of Merrick's residence is challenged at a hospital council meeting, but he is guaranteed permanent residence by command of the hospital's royal patron, [[Queen Victoria]], who sends word with her daughter-in-law [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]]. However, Merrick is soon kidnapped by Bytes during one of Jim's raucous late-night showings. Bytes leaves England and takes Merrick on the road as a circus attraction once again. A witness reports to Treves, who confronts Jim about what he has done, and Mothershead fires him.\n\nMerrick is forced to be an \"attraction\" again, but during a \"show\" in Belgium, Merrick, who is weak and dying, collapses, causing a drunken Bytes to lock him in a cage and leave him to die. Merrick manages to escape from Bytes with the help of his fellow freakshow attractions. Upon returning to London, he is harassed through [[Liverpool Street station]] by several young boys and accidentally knocks down a young girl. Merrick is chased, unmasked, and cornered by an angry mob. He cries, \"I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I&nbsp;... am&nbsp;... a&nbsp;... man!\" before collapsing. Policemen return Merrick to the hospital and Treves. He recovers some of his health, but is dying of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]. Treves and Mothershead take Merrick to see one of Mrs Kendal's shows at the theatre, and Kendal dedicates the performance to him. A proud Merrick receives a standing ovation from the audience.\n\nBack at the hospital, Merrick thanks Treves for all he has done, and completes his church model. He lies down on his back in bed, imitating a sleeping child in a picture on his wall, and dies in his sleep. Merrick is consoled by a vision of his mother, who quotes [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]]'s \"Nothing Will Die\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]], a doctor who takes John from the freakshow to work in the hospital\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]], an intelligent, friendly and kind-hearted man who is feared by most people in his society because of his severe deformity.\n* [[Hannah Gordon]] as Ann Treves\n* [[Anne Bancroft]] as [[Madge Kendal]]\n* [[John Gielgud]] as Francis Carr Gomm\n* [[Wendy Hiller]] as Mrs Mothershead\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as Mr Bytes, the evil ringmaster (based on [[Tom Norman]]<ref>{{cite news|last=von Tunzelmann|first=Alex|title=The Elephant Man: close to the memoirs but not the man|date=10 December 2009|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/10/the-elephant-man-reel-history|access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref>)\n* [[Frederick Treves (actor)|Frederick Treves]] (great nephew of Dr Frederick Treves) as Alderman\n* [[Michael Elphick]] as Jim, the dishonest night porter\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as Bytes' boy\n* [[Helen Ryan]] as [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra, Princess of Wales]]\n* [[John Standing]] as Fox\n* [[Lesley Dunlop]] as Nora, Merrick's nurse\n* [[Phoebe Nicholls]] (picture)/Lydia Lisle (footage) as Mary Jane Merrick\n* [[W.

Brooks' personal assistant, Stuart Cornfeld, suggested [[David Lynch]] to Sanger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/27/42|title= 'How does a guy known for fart jokes make The Elephant Man?'|website= [[The Guardian]]|date= July 26, 2008|accessdate= December 28, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/mel-brooks-david-lynch-and-the-elephant-man/|title= A Brief History of Mel Brooks, David Lynch and 'The Elephant Man'|website= Film School Rejects|date= June 28, 2021|accessdate= December 29, 2021}}</ref>\n\nSanger met Lynch and they shared scripts they were working on (''The Elephant Man'' and Lynch's unrealized ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]''). Lynch told Sanger that he would love to direct the script after reading it, and Sanger endorsed him after hearing Lynch's ideas. However, Brooks had not heard of Lynch at the time. Sanger and Cornfeld set up an ''[[Eraserhead]]'' viewing at a [[20th Century Fox]] screening room; Brooks loved it and enthusiastically agreed for Lynch to direct.

Lynch tried to design the make-up himself too but the design didn't work.<ref name=\"IMDB\"/> The makeup, now supervised by [[Christopher Tucker]], was based on direct casts of Merrick's body, which had been kept in the [[Royal London Hospital]]'s private museum. The makeup took seven to eight hours to apply each day and two hours to delicately remove. [[John Hurt]] would arrive on set at 5am and shoot his scenes from noon until 10pm. After his first experience of the inconvenience of having to apply the makeup and perform with it, he called his girlfriend, saying, \"I think they have finally managed to make me hate acting.\"\n\nBecause of the strain on the actor, he worked alternate days.<ref name=\"IMDB\"/> Lynch originally wanted [[Jack Nance]] for the title character. \"But it just wasn't in the cards\", Lynch says; the role went to Hurt after Brooks, Lynch and Sanger saw his performance as [[Quentin Crisp]] in ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Potter|first=Maximillian|title=Erased|date=August 1997|magazine=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|url=http://www.lynchnet.com/absent/nancepre.html}}</ref>\n\nThe film is bookended with [[surrealism|surrealist]] sequences centred around Merrick's mother and her death. Lynch used [[Samuel Barber]]'s ''[[Adagio for Strings]]'' to underline the climax and Merrick's own death.
