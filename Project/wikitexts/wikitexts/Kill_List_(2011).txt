His disturbed past surfaces as he spins out of control during jobs and ominous employers raise the stakes. It was filmed in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]] in England.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== Plot ==\nJay and Gal are two former British soldiers turned [[hitman|hitmen]]. While Gal is laid-back, Jay is still reeling from an unspecified disastrous mission in [[Kyiv]]. Despite the urging of his wife Shel, Jay has not obtained full employment, to the point where they are financially broke.\n\nShel organizes a dinner party to which she invites Gal and his latest girlfriend, Fiona, a [[human resources]] manager. During the evening, Gal reveals he has a new job for them, which Shel encourages him to take. Meanwhile, Fiona goes to the toilet, carves a symbol on the back of the bathroom mirror, and takes a tissue that Jay had used to mop up his blood after a shaving accident. Jay accepts the job, and the two meet the shadowy client, who has a list of three people he wants killed. The employer unexpectedly cuts Jay's hand and his own, so that the contract is effectively signed in blood.\n\nTheir first target, captioned as \"''The Priest''\", appears to recognize Jay and thanks him just before being killed. The second name on the list, \"''The Librarian''\", is an archivist who keeps a collection of horrific, sickening videos of an undisclosed nature. Upon watching the videos, Jay is deeply disturbed and breaks down in tears. Confronting the archivist at his home, an enraged Jay beats him senseless and tortures him into identifying the names of the people who created the videos. As Gal goes to raid the safe, the archivist thanks Jay, who proceeds to savagely beat him to death with a hammer. Jay insists on chasing down and killing the archivist's associates, and as Gal looks into their files, he finds a folder on himself and Jay, including details of their Kyiv mission. Although they do not recognize it, the file includes the symbol that Fiona carved in Jay's mirror.\n\nUpon Jay's insistence, Gal drives to the location of the creators of the sickening videos, where Jay promptly murders all of them in horrific fashion.\n\nGal informs Jay that, while raiding the safe in the home of the second target, he took enough money to cover the total sum they would receive for the contract. The pair decide to abandon the contract and return home. When his cut hand becomes infected, Jay visits his doctor, only to find that his regular doctor has been replaced by another man who will only give him cryptic advice. Jay and Gal return to their client and offer to find replacements to kill the last name on the list. The client refuses and says that both hitmen and their families will be killed if they do not complete the contract as they agreed. Shel takes their son Sam to the family's cottage for safekeeping while Jay and Gal go back to work.\n\nTheir final mark, \"''The MP''\", is a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] who lives in a [[English country house|mansion]]. While observing the house, the pair witness a strange ceremony in the woods that culminates in [[human sacrifice]]. Jay opens fire with an assault rifle, and the leader of the ceremony presents himself for Jay to execute. He kills the leader and several cultists before the remaining masked members chase the hitmen into an underground complex. They capture and disembowel Gal, forcing Jay to perform a mercy killing on him. Emerging from the tunnels, Jay flees to the family cottage and meets with Shel. When he goes outside, he finds their car tires have been slashed and lit torches have been placed around the nearby field. Jay attempts to locate their attackers, but he is knocked unconscious. Inside the cottage, Shel arms herself and shoots several invaders.\n\nJay awakens in the field surrounded by the cultists, who strip him and place a mask over his face. He is confronted by his last victim, \"''The Hunchback''\", a masked and cloaked person armed with a knife. After a brutal knife fight, Jay triumphs, only to discover that the Hunchback was his wife with Sam strapped to her back. Shel laughs as she dies. The cultists applaud and remove their masks, revealing Fiona, the client, and the man from the doctor's office amongst their numbers. Jay is then crowned by the cultists.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Neil Maskell]] as Jay\n* [[Michael Smiley]] as Gal\n* [[MyAnna Buring]] as Shel\n* [[Emma Fryer]] as Fiona\n* Harry Simpson as Sam\n* [[Struan Rodger]] as The Client\n* [[Ben Crompton]] as Justin\n* Robin Hill as Stuart\n* Gareth Tunley as The Priest\n* Mark Kempner as The Librarian\n* James Nickerson as The [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]\n* Robert Hill as High Priest\n* [[Alice Lowe]] as Radio Reporter\n* [[Steve Oram]] as Radio Reporter\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nAfter making ''[[Down Terrace]]'', Wheatley wanted to use the lessons learned to make a horror film. The original treatment was a hybrid of the styles and themes of ''[[Get Carter]]'' and [[H. P.

Wheatley was worried people might call him on its similarities, but he was instead surprised to find people comparing it to a symbol from ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', with which he is unfamiliar.<ref name=guardian/> The film's most violent scene, the hammer murder, came about when Wheatley was surprised at the shocking violence in ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|The Orphanage]]'', which he had assumed would be a subtle art-house film.  Wheatley stated that this turn toward violent horror in ''The Orphanage'' made the rest of the film unpredictable; he wanted a similar unpredictability in his own film, so that viewers were never sure whether the film would be subtle or explicit.<ref name=complex/>\n\nThe song \"It Could Have Been Better\", used in the film, is performed by [[Joan Armatrading]].
