It is the sequel to the 1988 film ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]'' and the second installment in [[The Naked Gun|''The Naked Gun'' film series]]. The film stars [[Leslie Nielsen]] as the comically bumbling Police [[Frank Drebin|Lt. Frank Drebin]] of ''[[Police Squad!]]''. [[Priscilla Presley]] plays the role of Jane, with [[O. J. Simpson]] as Nordberg and [[George Kennedy]] as police captain Ed Hocken. The film also features [[Robert Goulet]] (who previously made a \"special guest star\" appearance on ''Police Squad!'') as the villainous Quentin Hapsburg and [[Richard Griffiths]] as renewable fuel advocate Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer (as well as his evil double, Earl Hacker). [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], [[Mel Torm\u00e9]] and members of the [[Chicago Bears]] have cameo roles.\n\n[[David Zucker]] returns from the first entry as director and screenwriter of the film. [[Jim Abrahams]] and [[Jerry Zucker]] serve as [[executive producer]]s for the film and receive writing credit due to their contributions to the first entry of the series and the ''Police Squad!'' television series. However, neither contributed to the screenplay for the film.\n\nA third installment in the series, ''[[Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult|Naked Gun {{frac|33|1|3}}: The Final Insult]]'', was released in 1994.\n\n==Plot==\nFrank Drebin is honored at the [[White House]], where [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] announces that he will base his recommendation for the country's energy program on Dr. Albert Meinheimer's advice, which will be revealed during the doctor's speech at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] dinner the following week. The heads of the coal and oil ([[fossil fuel]]) and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] industries are distressed by this fact, as Dr. Meinheimer is an advocate for renewable energy. Jane Spencer, now separated from Frank and working for Dr. Meinheimer, is working late at Meinheimer's research institute when she spots a man leaving in a van. A maintenance worker discovers a clock with dynamite attached and takes it to the security guards, who accidentally trigger it.\n\nThe next morning, Frank reacquaints himself with Jane as he interviews her about the explosion. He is shown around the institute and meets Jane's boyfriend, Hexagon Oil executive Quentin Hapsburg, of whom he becomes exceedingly jealous. Frank's boss, Ed Hocken, finds him and Jane at a lonely blues bar, where Frank promptly blows a chance to make up with her. Meanwhile, at a meeting of the \"energy\" industry leaders, Hapsburg reveals that he has kidnapped Dr. Meinheimer and found an exact double for him, Earl Hacker, who will endorse fossil and nuclear fuels at the Press Club Dinner.\n\nPolice Squad tracks down the van driver, Hector Savage. Once he discovers the police are onto him, Savage holes up in a house, demanding money and a car. Frank drives a SWAT tank into and through the house, inadvertently allowing Savage to escape, and causes more damage when he loses control of the tank and crashes into the city zoo, allowing the animals to escape. At a party that evening, Frank notices that Dr. Meinheimer does not instantly remember him, despite Jane telling him that Meinheimer had a photographic memory. Frank confronts her with this at her apartment following the party, but is dismissed. Moments later, Savage enters the home and tries to kill Jane. Frank becomes aware of Savage and kills him by sticking a fire hose into his mouth and turning it on full blast. Jane realizes that Frank was right, and the two rekindle their romance.\n\nThe next day, Police Squad stakes out Hexagon Oil's headquarters where Dr. Meinheimer is being held. Frank tries to go undercover into the building, but instead is discovered and tied up by Hapsburg's henchmen. Frank and Dr. Meinheimer are eventually freed, and Police Squad proceeds to the Press Club Dinner. Finding their only way in locked, Frank, Ed, Nordberg, and Dr. Meinheimer commandeer a [[mariachi]] band's costumes and head inside, where Hacker is eventually intercepted, allowing Meinheimer to give his speech. Hapsburg flees the dinner and takes Jane with him. After a shootout on the roof of the building, Hapsburg informs Frank that he has rigged the building with a small [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear device]] which will kill everyone in there except for him and render Dr. Meinheimer's speech useless. After a fight, Frank attempts to learn the bomb's disarming code from Hapsburg, but Ed enters and throws Hapsburg out a window. Hapsburg hits an awning below and is able to come to the sidewalk unscathed, but is immediately killed by an escaped lion from the zoo.\n\nFrank and Jane attempt to disarm the bomb while Ed and Nordberg go back into the ballroom to evacuate it. After several failed attempts, Frank finally manages to disarm the bomb at the last second by tripping over its power cord, unplugging it. Frank is commended by the President, who offers him a special post as head of the Federal Bureau of Police Squad. Frank declines, instead asking Jane to marry him, which she accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as [[Frank Drebin|Lieutenant Frank Drebin]]\n* [[Priscilla Presley]] as Jane Spencer\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Captain Ed Hocken\n* [[O.

This role has frequently been attributed to singer [[Vitamin C (singer)|Vitamin C]] who happens to share the same name, but this is incorrect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKWoI6ivRyw |title=Naked Gun 2 1/2 Blues Club clip - Hilarious Depression! |website=YouTube |date=August 4, 2010 |access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther non-Newborn pieces are heard in this ''Naked Gun'' installment. They include the standards \"[[Tangerine (1941 song)|Tangerine]]\" and \"[[Satin Doll]]\" and [[The Righteous Brothers]]' recordings of \"[[Unchained Melody]]\" (featured in Jerry Zucker's drama ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'') and \"[[Ebb Tide (song)|Ebb Tide]].\" Nielsen himself voices the Latin-flavored pop standard \"[[B\u00e9same Mucho]]\" at the Press Club dinner.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Naked Gun {{frac|2|1|2}}: The Smell of Fear<br />(Original Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Ira Newborn]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1991\n| recorded   = 1991\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Big Band]]\n| length     = 35:46\n| label      = [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]]\n| producer   = [[Ira Newborn]]<br />Robert Townson (executive producer)\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nIn conjunction with the second ''Naked Gun'' film, [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] released a soundtrack combining the best Newborn compositions from the first two films.

Even the inconsistent ''[[Top Secret!]]'' (1984), a demented hybrid of Elvis movies and World War II espionage thrillers, had far wilder passages. Yet I'll take lesser ZAZ over most of the competition any day. Their comedies don't just get you laughing. They put you inside a new, cracked-mirror world \u2014 a world where no detail is too small for ridicule, and where Leslie Nielsen (bless him) can be a movie star.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear|work= Entertainment Weekly|date=July 12, 1991|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,314827,00.html|access-date=October 10, 2010}}</ref> [[Kenneth Turan]] wrote in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that one should \"consider ''The Naked Gun {{frac|2|1|2}}: The Smell of Fear''.
