Walker]] and Corey Blechman from a story by Walker and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] under their [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]] imprint. The film stars [[Jason James Richter]] in his feature film debut, [[Lori Petty]], [[Jayne Atkinson]], [[August Schellenberg]], and [[Michael Madsen]] with the eponymous character, Willy, played by [[Keiko (orca)| Keiko]]. The story is about an orphaned boy who befriended a captive [[orca]] at an ailing amusement park.\n\nReleased on July 16, 1993, the film received positive attention from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $153.7 million from a $20 million budget.\n\nIt grew into [[Free Willy (franchise)|a small franchise]], including a television series, two sequels and a direct-to-video reboot in addition to inspiring the rehabilitation and release of Keiko. The film also marked Keith A. Walker's only film he wrote and final project before his death in late December of 1996.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films must be from 400 to 700 words only. Keep this message for new editors, and please shorten in case this goes beyond the word limit.-->\nNear the coastline of the [[Pacific Northwest]], a pod of [[orca|killer whales]] are peacefully swimming. The pod is tracked down by a group of [[whaler]]s. One of them has a distinguishable set of three spots. The orca gets trapped and sent to the Northwest Adventure Park while his family is unable to help.\n\nMonths later in [[Portland, Oregon]], Jesse, a troubled 12-year-old abandoned by his estranged mother six years earlier, fled from Cooperton until police catch him and fellow runaway Perry, who escapes, vandalizing the observation room within the park. On the night of his arrest, he encounters the orca named Willy. Jesse's social worker Dwight earns him a reprieve by finding him a foster home in [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] and having him clean up the graffiti. His foster parents are the supportive and kind Annie and Glen Greenwood, but Jesse is initially unruly and hostile to them.\n\nJesse sees Willy again. He is regarded as surly and uncooperative by park employee Rae Lindley, but takes a liking to Jesse's harmonica playing and later saves him from drowning one night. The two start a bond and Jesse also becomes friendly with Willy's keeper Randolph Johnson who witnessed Jesse's arrest the previous night.  Randolph teaches him about his connection with Willy. Jesse is offered a job after probation, and also warms up to his new home.\n\nPark owner Dial sees the talent Jesse and Willy have together in hopes of finally making money from Willy who has thus far been a costly venture for him.  On opening day, however, Willy refuses to perform due to being antagonized. Jesse, unable to get him to do tricks while dealing with pressure from spectators, tearfully storms off and plans to find his mother. Willy cracks the tank with his stress-induced rage, having had enough of the children's constant banging. Later that night, Jesse says his farewell but notices Willy's family calling to him from the outside and realizes how miserable he is in captivity after discovering their voices responding to his cry. However, the discovery was cut short when Jesse spots Wade and several colleagues sneaking into the observation area to deliberately damage the tank enough that the water will gradually leak out and kill Willy, allowing them to cash in on $1,000,000 of insurance.\n\nAfter Randolph reveals Dial's plan, Jesse hatches an idea to free Willy and also recruited Rae. They use the forklift to load him onto a trailer attached to Glen's truck Jesse and Randolph stole to tow him to Dawson's Marina. Wade meanwhile calls Dial about Willy being stolen. Dial tells him to call Wilson as he launches a search.  Jesse, Randolph and Rae try to stay on the back roads to avoid being spotted, but eventually get stuck in the mud.\n\nWith Randolph and Rae unable to move the trailer, Jesse calls Glen and Annie using a [[CB radio]] in the truck. Glen and Annie show up and help free the truck, and continue while making a stop at a car wash. Once at the marina, Dial was already there after presumably figuring out their path. Glen smashes through the gate, turns the truck around and backs Willy into the water.\n\nWilly is finally released but does not immediately move, seemingly having been on dry land for too long.  Wade and the confederates attempt to interfere, but the group held them off long enough for him to swim away. With Jesse's encouragement, Willy finally begins to swim. Before he can make it, however, two of Dial's whaling ships seal off the marina. Jesse runs towards the [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], calling for Willy to follow him, drawing him away from the nets. Jesse goes to the edge and signals to Willy that if he makes the jump, it will be his highest and he'll be free. Jesse says a tearful goodbye, but pulls himself together and goes back to the top. He recites a [[Haida people|Haida]] prayer Randolph had taught him through the story of Natselane, before giving Willy the signal. Willy finally makes the jump over the breakwater and lands in the ocean on the other side, free to return to his family, which a dismayed Dial and Wade could only watch. Jesse thanks Glen and Annie as Willy calls out to Jesse in the distance.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jason James Richter]] as Jesse, a 12-year old orphan\n* [[Lori Petty]] as Rae Lindley, Northwest Adventure Park trainer and Willy's veterinarian\n* [[Jayne Atkinson]] as Annie Greenwood, a teacher, Jesse's foster mother, and Glen's wife\n* [[August Schellenberg]] as Randolph Johnson, Willy's Haida caregiver\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Glen Greenwood, Greenwood Auto Repairs founder and owner, Jesse's foster dad, and Annie's husband\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as Dial, Northwest Adventure Park owner\n* [[Richard Riehle]] as Wade, Dial's assistant and Northwest Adventure Park general manager\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Dwight Mercer, Jesse's social worker\n* [[Michael Bacall]] as Perry, a runaway orphan and Jesse's friend\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as Gwenie, a runaway orphan\n* [[Keiko (orca)|Keiko]] as Willy, a captive 12-year old orca who Jesse befriends\nThen-Astoria mayor [[Willis Van Dusen]] made a cameo appearance as a fish vendor. [[Jim Michaels]] was the announcer for the Northwest Adventure Park's aquatic theater.\n\n== Production ==\nMost close-up shots involving limited movement by Willy, such as when Willy is in the trailer and the sequences involving Willy swimming in the open water, make use of an animatronic stand-in. [[Walt Conti]], who supervised the effects for the orcas, estimated that half of the shots of the orca used animatronic stand-ins. Conti stated that the smaller movements of a real orca actually made things difficult in some ways for him and his crew; they had to concentrate on smaller nuances in order to make the character seem alive.<ref name=Rickett2006>{{cite book |title=Designing Movie Creatures and Characters: Behind the Scenes With the Movie Masters |last=Rickitt |first=Richard |year=2006 |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=978-0-240-80846-8 |pages=161\u201365 }}</ref> The most extensive use of CGI in the film is the climax, filmed at the Hammond Marina in [[Warrenton, Oregon]], where Willy jumps over Jesse and into the wild. All stunts with the orca were performed by the young orca trainer Justin Sherbert (known additionally by his stage name, Justin Sherman).
