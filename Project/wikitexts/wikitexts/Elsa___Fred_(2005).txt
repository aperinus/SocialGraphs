An [[Elsa & Fred (2014 film)|American remake]] of the film was released in 2014.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nFred, a recently widowed Spaniard in his 70s who has led a quiet life, retires to an apartment in [[Madrid]]. Elsa, a similarly aged but more colorful Argentinian and a chronic liar, is his neighbor. Fred has no significant health problems but is a hypochondriac. Elsa is seriously ill and undergoing dialysis but hides it from Fred. The two fall in love. Elsa throws Fred into situations the widower would have disapproved of before he met her, making him \"live life and not death\". Once Fred learns Elsa will probably die, he pays all their expenses for a trip to Rome to fulfill Elsa's lifelong wish of reenacting [[Federico Fellini]]'s famous scene starring [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Anita Ekberg]] under the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] in ''[[La Dolce Vita]]''.\n\nAfter the trip to Rome, the movie ends with Fred visiting Elsa's grave in Madrid with his grandson. Fred looks at the birthdate on her tombstone and realizes she lied about how old she was and jokingly and affectionately calls her \"embustera\" (Spanish for \"liar\").\n\n== English-language remake ==\nThe film was remade in 2014 as a film set in the United States, starring [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Christopher Plummer]], also titled ''[[Elsa & Fred (2014 film)|Elsa & Fred]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Spanish films of 2005]]\n* [[List of Argentine films of 2005]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0453047|Elsa & Fred}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elsa and Fred}}\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Madrid]]\n[[Category:Films about old age]]\n[[Category:Argentine romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Marcos Carnevale]]\n[[Category:2000s Argentine films]]\n[[Category:2000s Spanish films]]\n\n\n{{2000s-Argentina-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
