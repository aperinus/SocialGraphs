The film stars [[Vin Diesel]] as an immortal witch hunter who must stop a plague from ravaging the entire world.<ref name=SR2>{{cite web|last=Schafer|first=Sandy|title='Fast & Furious 7\u2032 Resumes Filming; 'Last Witch Hunter' Getting a Rewrite|url=https://screenrant.com/fast-furious-7-last-witch-hunter-diesel/|publisher=Screen Rant|access-date=6 April 2014}}</ref> The film was released on October 23, 2015, grossing $147 million while receiving generally unfavorable reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nEight hundred years ago, the Witch Queen unleashes the [[Black Death|Black Plague]] to wipe out humanity. A band of knights, including a widowed Kaulder, storms her lair and defeats her. Before dying, the Witch Queen curses Kaulder with [[Immortality|eternal life]].\n\nIn the present day, Kaulder prevents a teenage witch from unintentionally destroying an airplane with weather-controlling runes. Kaulder is revealed to be working as a witch hunter for an organization called the Axe and Cross, which aims to keep the truce between humans and witches and either executes or imprisons the witches who break the law. He is aided by a priest called \"Dolan\", a tradition carried from the battle to destroy the Witch Queen.\n\nThe 36th Dolan tells Kaulder that he is retiring from his duties and has chosen a new Dolan for him, but dies in his sleep. Kaulder and the 37th Dolan deduce that 36 was murdered by a witch. While tracking down the witch, Kaulder finds traces of old dark magic, not seen since before he killed the Queen. It is revealed that 36 is not dead but under a dark magic spell that can only be broken if the witch that cast it is killed.\n\nUsing clues that 36 left behind, Kaulder goes to a witch bar, owned by Chloe and Miranda, to buy a memory spell to help him remember how he died and came back. Chloe eventually agrees to perform the spell. During the process of reliving Kaulder's memory, the bar is attacked by the witch who cursed the 36th Dolan. He later attacks Chloe at her apartment, though Kaulder saves her. 37 and Kaulder work together to determine the witch's name\u2014Baltasar Ketola, aka Belial. After Miranda is killed by Belial, Chloe agrees to help Kaulder get what he needs to kill him.\n\nTo get the rare ingredient to create another memory spell, they visit another witch, Danique. However, Danique casts an endless memory spell on Kaulder, planning to entrap him in his dream forever. Chloe, revealed to be a dream-walker, is able to enter his trance and free his mind and the pair escape. Kaulder asks Chloe to enter his mind and pull out the memory. He discovers that, though the Queen's body burned to ash, the first Dolan chose to spare her heart; if the heart was destroyed, Kaulder would die. They deduce that 36 was attacked because he knew of where the heart was hidden and was tortured into revealing its location. They also realize that Belial's real plan is to revive the Queen.\n\nLeaving Chloe and the 37th Dolan behind, Kaulder goes to face Belial to prevent the Queen from returning. Though he kills Belial in a confrontation, the Queen reenters the world through the sacrifice of another witch and escapes into the city, stealing Kaulder's immortality. 36, who is recovering, encourages Kaulder to continue fighting.\n\nThe members of the Witch Council, who guard the Witches' Prison, are killed and the Queen plans to release another plague curse using the imprisoned witches as a magical power source. Using her dream walking ability, Chloe kills one of the prisoners, severing the connection of the Queen. Kaulder fights the Queen, and appears close to killing her, until 37 attacks him with grudge for killing his witch parents. He asks the Queen to give him magical power. She refuses and kills 37 and uses Chloe to complete the connection for the plague curse to form again. Kaulder summons lightning to his sword using the weather runes he confiscated from the young witch on the plane, and throws his sword into the Queen, burning her to ash. Kaulder prepares to kill both himself and the Queen's heart, but Chloe dissuades him, stating that there were things in the darkness worse than the Witch Queen that he needs to continue fighting.\n\nThe 36th Dolan agrees to delay his retirement and stay by Kaulder's side. Chloe does as well, and the three form a new team, free from the Axe and Cross. The heartbeat of the Queen is heard within Kaulder's weapon stash in his apartment.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as Kaulder\n* [[Rose Leslie]] as Chloe\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Dolan 37th\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Dolan 36th\n* [[\u00d3lafur Darri \u00d3lafsson]] as Baltasar Ketola/Belial\n* [[Julie Engelbrecht]] as Witch Queen\n* [[Rena Owen]] as Glaeser\n* [[Isaach De Bankol\u00e9]] as Max Schlesinger\n* [[Lotte Verbeek]] as Helena, Kaulder's wife\n* [[Dawn Olivieri]] as Danique\n* [[Inbar Lavi]] as Sonya\n* [[Aimee Carrero]] as Miranda\n* [[Bex Taylor-Klaus]] as Bronwyn\n* Allegra Carpenter as Fatima\n* [[Kurt Angle]] as Bodyguard #4\n* [[Joe Gilgun]] as Ellic\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:10.13.15LastWitchHunterPremiereByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|right|The film's New York premiere was held at the Loews [[Lincoln Square, Manhattan|Lincoln Square]] on October 13, 2015.]]\n\nScreenwriter Corey Goodman was largely influenced by talks with Vin Diesel, specifically about his ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' witch hunter character.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dickens|first=Donna|title=If it weren't for Vin Diesel's 'Dungeons & Dragons' character, 'The Last Witch Hunter' wouldn't exist|url=http://www.hitfix.com/harpy/if-it-werent-for-vin-diesels-dungeons-dragons-character-the-last-witch-hunter-wouldnt-exist|access-date=30 September 2015}}</ref> Initially [[Timur Bekmambetov]] was to direct but was later replaced by [[Breck Eisner]] and Goodman's script was re-written by D.W.
