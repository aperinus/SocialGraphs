The film was followed by a 2011 sequel ''After Fall, Winter''.\n\n==Plot==\nMichael Shiver ([[Eric Schaeffer]]) is a cab driver in New York. One day, supermodel Sarah Easton ([[Amanda de Cadenet]]) enters his taxi and they have a short but intense exchange. A few days later, he sees her by chance when having dinner with his two close friends, and they have a short interaction.\n\nThe movie develops with the two of them becoming interested into each other and slowly falling in love while Sarah's husband is away in Rome for two months. Michael occasionally writes her love poems and surprises her with romantic gifts such as a thousand roses delivered to her hotel room in Spain, when Sarah went there to visit her husband.\n\nTowards the end, there is an intense conflict between Sarah and Michael, in which Sarah says how Michael doesn't understand her life and that everything happens on his terms. Michael reveals that he was a writer and had known her kind of life, but did not feel fulfilled so gave up and became a cab driver instead. Sarah goes back to her husband and Michael sends her his best-selling book (which made him famous in the past) along with a last letter with which the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[Eric Schaeffer]] - Michael\n*[[Amanda de Cadenet]] - Sarah\n*[[Rudolf Martin]] - Phillipe\n*[[Francie Swift]] - Robin\n*[[Lisa Vidal]] - Sally\n*[[Roberta Maxwell]] - Joan Alterman\n*[[Scarlett Johansson]] - Little Girl\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0119098|Fall}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1081000-fall|Fall}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Manhattan]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Paris]]\n[[Category:1997 independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Eric Schaeffer]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-romantic-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
