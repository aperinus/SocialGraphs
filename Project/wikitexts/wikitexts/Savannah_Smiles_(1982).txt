Miller also played one of the male leads in the movie. The film was directed by Pierre De Moro, and starred [[Bridgette Andersen]] as the title character, with Mark Miller and [[Donovan Scott]] as the two vagabonds who befriend her.\n\n==Plot==\nSix-year-old Savannah's father, a wealthy [[Salt Lake City]] businessman, is running for the United States Senate. Savannah has been relegated to the background in the lives of her mother and father. Feeling neglected, she decides to run away, packs her things and writes a note to her parents. Her aunt comes by to pick her up for a planned trip to the park, and Savannah manages to place her suitcase into the car unnoticed. At the park Savannah slips away and sneaks into the back seat of the car of Alvin \"Alvie\" Gibbs and Boots \"Bootsie\" McGaffee, two escaped, down-on-their-luck convicts. Savannah's father finds her note, but fearing that news of her running away would damage his chances of winning the election, he burns the note and orders the maid not to tell anyone. The convicts reluctantly take Savannah with them, but soon discover her parents have posted a $100,000 reward for her safe return. Alvie and Boots believe their luck has finally come in, but wonder how they could return Savannah and collect the reward without drawing attention to themselves and being sent back to prison. While trying to work it out they unexpectedly become attached to Savannah, and Savannah finds the love and attention she always wanted. Alvie confides in Savannah that he himself was a runaway, having left his abusive and neglectful next of kin as a child. The convicts arrange to return her, with the help of the family priest, but she becomes lost in the [[Uinta Mountains]] of northeastern Utah. Forgoing an opportunity to escape, the convicts search for Savannah and bring her back to safety, ultimately surrendering their freedom. As Savannah drives away with her parents, Boots tells Alvie he hopes no one tells Savannah they were \"bad guys\", but Alvie assures him it will make no difference to her. The film ends with a flashback of a young Alvie finally catching up to the pick-up truck with his cousins welcoming him on, finally having gained the family he never had.\n\n==Production==\nMark Miller was the creative force behind the project. He conceived the story, wrote the screenplay, starred in and produced the movie.<ref name=\"Machen\">{{cite web|url=https://cinapse.co/savannah-smiles-sweetness-schlock-fcf77a492315|last=Machen|first=Rod|title=Savannah Smiles: Sweetness and Schlock|work=Cinapse|date=22 May 2018|accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> Miller got the idea for the movie when his daughter Savannah was a toddler. Her unruly curly blonde hair and  smiling face struck Miller as so appealing that he came to believe he could make a successful movie around that alone.<ref name=\"Alyse\"/> He had to build a story for the little girl, and borrowed from the 1937 French movie ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'', where an escaped hardened prisoner hides out in the home of a young widow, and is softened by the kindness of her daughter.<ref name=\"Alyse\"/> Miller titled the story after his daughter Savannah.<ref name=\"Machen\"/> To finance the production he went to Texas oil man Hal Clifford.<ref>Lee, Luaine ''Small Production A Rigorous Experience'', Knight News Service</ref> Though many thought the movie would have no audience, Miller believed the project would appeal to young women. He was proved right.<ref name=\"Alyse\"/>\n\nSixty child actresses tried out for the part of Savannah.<ref name=\"Alyse\">{{cite web|url=http://thecrowdfundingcenter.com/videos/play?id=9B8XXB|last=Alyse|first=Jennifer|title=A Chat with Mark Miller|work=The Savanest Agency|date=|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref> This was narrowed down to twelve who were asked to audition before Miller, including [[Drew Barrymore]]. Auditioning [[Bridgette Andersen]], he asked her to tell him any bedtime story she knew. Bridgette told Miller the story of [[Br'er Rabbit]]. He liked her telling of the story so well he included it in the movie.<ref name=\"Alyse\"/>\n\nHe asked [[Donovan Scott]] to play the role of Boots McGaffey, Alvie's friend, and relied upon him for the slapstick comedy that he used to lighten the story.<ref name=\"Machen\"/> Miller played Alvie Gibbs, the other male lead and the central character in the movie. He asked his wife, Barbara Stanger, to play the role of Savannah's mother, Joan Driscoll, and called upon friends [[Peter Graves]] and [[Pat Morita]] to take roles in the film. Miller relied upon his Texas upbringing to help him create the character of Alvie Gibbs. He gave his daughter Savannah a small speaking role as Savannah's cousin Beth. By the time of filming, she had grown into an eleven-year-old. Miller's older daughter Marissa also had a small role in the film.\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Provo Canyon]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref> and in the mountain country to the southeast near [[Sundance Resort|Sundance]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=\"O'Leary\"/> The gondola scene was shot at [[Bridal Veil Falls (Utah)|Bridal Veil Falls]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/locations_savannahsmiles.htm|last=|first=|title=Savannah Smiles 80s Movies Rewind|work=Locations|date=|accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nShort on funds to promote the movie, Miller teamed with [[Eunice Shriver]] of [[Special Olympics]], a charity he supported. Miller committed the gross revenue from the opening weekend of the film to the Special Olympics for their aid in promoting the release. Shriver agreed.<ref name=\"Alyse\"/> The movie opened 10 December 1982 in time for the Christmas season. The movie's soundtrack, titled ''Savannah Smiles (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'', was released six months before the movie, on 1 June 1982.\n\nAfter a short theater run, the movie received extensive play on cable television, and was featured on such channels as [[HBO]].<ref name=\"O'Leary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/4660/Savannah%20Smiles%20(Anchor%20Bay)|last=O'Leary|first=Chuck|title=Savannah Smiles|work=Fulvue Drive-in|date=|accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> The film was released to DVD by Anchor Bay on 26 September 2006.
