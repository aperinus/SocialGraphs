''[[The Hard Goodbye]]'' is about an ex-convict who embarks on a rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart's killer. ''[[The Big Fat Kill]]'' follows a private investigator<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/film/fj5jnd/sin-city/|title=Sin City \u2013 review {{!}} cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> who gets caught in a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries, the police and the mob. ''[[That Yellow Bastard]]'' focuses on an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured [[serial killer]]. The intro and outro of the film are based on the short story \"The Customer is Always Right\" which is collected in ''Booze, Broads & Bullets'', the sixth book in the comic series.\n\nThe film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Jessica Alba]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Clive Owen]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Elijah Wood]], and featuring [[Alexis Bledel]], [[Powers Boothe]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Carla Gugino]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Jaime King]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Nick Stahl]], and [[Makenzie Vega]] among others.\n\n''Sin City'' opened to wide critical and commercial success, gathering particular recognition for the film's unique color processing which rendered most of the film in black and white while retaining or adding color for selected objects.

He offers her a cigarette and says that she looks like someone who is tired of running and that he will save her. The two share a kiss and he shoots her; she dies in his arms. He says he will never know what she was running from but that he will cash her <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE. -->check <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE. -->in the morning. <!-- U.S. FILM MEANS U.S. SPELLINGS; DO NOT CHANGE \"CHECK\" TO \"CHEQUE\", PLEASE.-->\n\n===\"That Yellow Bastard (Part I)\"===\nOn the docks of Sin City, aging police officer [[John Hartigan (Sin City)|John Hartigan]] tries to stop serial child-killer [[Roark Junior]] from raping and killing his fourth known victim, eleven-year-old [[Nancy Callahan]]. Junior is the son of [[Roark family#Senator Roark|Senator Roark]], who has bribed the police to cover up his son's crimes. Hartigan's corrupt partner, Bob, tries to convince Hartigan to walk away; Hartigan knocks him out.\n\nHartigan, experiencing pain from a [[Angina pectoris|bad heart]], heads into the warehouse where Roark Junior and several henchmen are holding Nancy. Junior shoots Hartigan in the shoulder and tries to escape. Hartigan catches up and shoots off Junior's ear, hand and genitals. Bob, now recovered, shoots Hartigan in the back. As the sirens approach, Bob leaves and Nancy lies down in Hartigan's lap. Hartigan passes out, reasoning his death is a fair trade for the girl's life.\n\n===\"The Hard Goodbye\"===\nAfter a [[one-night stand]], [[Marv (Sin City)|Marv]] awakens to find [[Goldie and Wendy|Goldie]] has been killed while he slept. He flees the frame-up as the police arrive, vowing to avenge her death. His [[lesbian]] [[parole officer]], Lucille, warns him to give up on this mission, believing Marv may have imagined it all due to his \"condition\". Marv interrogates several informants, working up to a corrupt priest, who reveals that the Roark family was behind the murder. Marv kills the priest but is then attacked by a woman who looks like Goldie, which he dismisses as a hallucination.\n\nMarv goes to the Roark family farm and is subdued by the silent stalker who killed Goldie. He awakens in the basement to find Lucille has been captured after looking into his story. She tells Marv that the killer is a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]] and that Goldie was a prostitute. He learns that the killer's name is Kevin and escapes. Lucille is shot by the leader of a squad of corrupt cops. Marv kills the cops except for their leader, whom he interrogates. He learns that Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark arranged for Goldie's murder.\n\nMarv goes to Old Town, Sin City's prostitute-run [[red-light district]], to learn more about Goldie and is captured by her twin sister, [[Goldie and Wendy|Wendy]], the attacker Marv previously dismissed as a hallucination. Once he convinces Wendy that he is not the killer, the two return to the farm where Marv kills Kevin. He confronts Cardinal Roark, who confesses his part in the murders. Kevin was the cardinal's ward; the two men ate the prostitutes to \"consume their souls\". Marv kills the cardinal but is then shot and captured by his guards.\n\nMarv is taken to a hospital where cops threaten to kill his mother, to get him to confess to killing Roark, Kevin and their victims. He is [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in the [[electric chair]]. Wendy visits him on [[death row]] and thanks him for avenging her sister. Marv is then executed.\n\n===\"The Big Fat Kill\"===\nShellie is being harassed by her [[domestic violence|abusive]] ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy and his cronies. Her boyfriend [[Dwight McCarthy]] violently warns him to leave Shellie alone. Jackie Boy and his cronies flee to Old Town. Dwight follows and sees them harass Becky, a young prostitute. Gail, the prostitutes' leader and Dwight's on-and-off lover, also witnesses the scene. When Jackie Boy threatens Becky with a gun, [[Miho (Sin City)|Miho]], a martial arts expert, kills Jackie Boy and his friends. They realize Jackie Boy is actually Detective Lieutenant [[Jack Rafferty]] of the Basin City Police, considered a \"hero cop\" by the press. If the cops learn how he died, their truce with the prostitutes would end and the mob would be free to wage war on Old Town.\n\nDwight takes the bodies to a [[tar pit]], where he is attacked by an ex-[[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] mercenary hired by mob boss Wallenquist. He nearly drowns in the tar before Miho saves him. The mercenary flees to the sewer with Jackie Boy's severed head but Dwight and Miho retrieve it and return to Old Town. Meanwhile, mob enforcer Manute kidnaps Gail. Becky, threatened with the death of her mother by the mob, betrays the prostitutes. Manute prepares the mob's invasion of Old Town. Dwight trades Jackie Boy's head for Gail's freedom but the head is stuffed with explosives; Dwight detonates it, destroying the evidence and Gail's captors. The other prostitutes gun down the mercenaries while Becky, injured in the fight, escapes.\n\n===\"That Yellow Bastard (Part II)\"===\nHartigan is recovering in a hospital when Senator Roark informs him that Junior is in a [[coma]] and the Roark legacy is in serious jeopardy. Hartigan will be framed for Junior's crimes; if he tells anyone the truth, his family will die. A grateful Nancy promises to write letters every week while he is in prison. Hartigan goes to jail, though he refuses to confess. He receives a weekly letter from Nancy, as promised. After eight years, the letters stop and he receives a severed finger instead. Hartigan confesses to all charges, leading to his parole, and searches for an adult Nancy, not knowing he is being followed by a deformed, yellow man. He eventually finds her at Kadie's Bar, where she has become an [[exotic dancing|exotic dancer]].\n\nHe realizes he was set up to lead the yellow man to Nancy and the two escape in Nancy's car. Hiding in the trunk of Hartigan's car, the deformed man returns, revealing himself as Roark Junior, disfigured by years of surgery to regenerate his body parts. Junior attacks Hartigan, claims to have raped nearly a hundred other children, and takes Nancy to the Roark farm to finish what he started eight years before. Hartigan follows and fakes a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], giving him a chance to kill Junior. Knowing that Senator Roark will never stop hunting them, Hartigan commits [[suicide]] to ensure Nancy's safety. Again, he justifies his life for Nancy's as a fair trade.\n\n===\"The Customer Is Always Right (Part II)\"===\nAn injured Becky departs from a hospital, talking on a cell phone with her mother. In the elevator she encounters The Salesman, dressed as a doctor. He offers her a cigarette, calling her by name, and she abruptly ends the call with her mother.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Listed in alphabetical order, as shown in the film's opening credits.

An example of the film's neo-noir atmosphere.]]\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{See also|Shot-for-shot}}\nPrincipal photography began on March 29, 2004. Several of the scenes were shot before any actor had signed on; as a result, several stand-ins were used before the actual actors were digitally added into the film during post-production. Rodriguez, an aficionado of cinematic technology, has used similar techniques in the past. In [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of the film, he recalled Rodriguez's speech during production of ''[[Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams]]'': \"This is the future! You don't wait six hours for a scene to be lighted. You want a light over here, you grab a light and put it over here. You want a nuclear submarine, you make one out of thin air and put your characters into it.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news |author=Ebert, Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050331/REVIEWS/50322001 |title='Sin City' Review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=March 31, 2005 |access-date=February 9, 2011 |archive-date=February 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224190211/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050331%2FREVIEWS%2F50322001 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film was noted throughout production for Rodriguez's plan to stay faithful to the source material, unlike most other comic book adaptations. Rodriguez stated that he considered the film to be \"less of an adaptation than a translation\". As a result, there is no screenwriting in the credits; simply \"Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller\". There were several minor changes, such as dialogue trimming, new colorized objects, removal of some nudity, slightly edited violence, and minor deleted scenes. These scenes were later added in the release of the ''Sin City'' Collectors DVD, which also split the books into four separate stories.<ref>{{cite web |last=Miller III |first=Randy |title=Frank Miller's Sin City: Recut, Extended, Unrated |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19223/frank-millers-sin-city-recut-extended-unrated |work=DVDTalk.com |access-date=September 23, 2012 |archive-date=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908021854/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19223/frank-millers-sin-city-recut-extended-unrated/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Sin City (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack was composed by Rodriguez, [[John Debney]], and [[Graeme Revell]]. The film's three main stories were each scored by an individual composer: Revell scored \"The Hard Goodbye\", Debney scored \"The Big Fat Kill\", and Rodriguez scored \"That Yellow Bastard\". Additionally, Rodriguez co-scored with the other two composers on several tracks.\n\nAnother notable piece of music used was the instrumental version of the song \"Cells\" by the London-based alternative group [[The Servant (band)|The Servant]]. The song was heavily featured in the film's publicity, including the promotional trailers and television spots, and being featured on the film's DVD menus.\n\n\"Sensemay\u00e1\" by [[Silvestre Revueltas]] is also used on the end sequence of \"That Yellow Bastard\". [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]]'s track \"Absurd\" is also used when Hartigan first enters Kadie's.\n\n=== Credits ===\nThree directors received credit for ''Sin City'': Miller, Rodriguez, and [[Quentin Tarantino]], the last for directing the drive-to-the-pits scene in which Dwight talks with a dead Jack Rafferty ([[Benicio del Toro]]). Miller and Rodriguez worked as a team directing the rest of the film.\n\nWhen the [[Directors Guild of America]] refused to allow two directors that were not an established team to be credited (especially since Miller had never directed before), Rodriguez first planned to give Miller full credit. Miller would not accept this. Rodriguez, also refusing to take full credit, decided to resign from the Guild so that the joint credit could remain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rodriguez Quits DGA |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/rodgriguez-quits-dga |work=ContactMusic.com |date=March 19, 2004 |access-date=November 28, 2011 |archive-date=December 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212103955/http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/rodgriguez-quits-dga |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on August 16, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Latchem|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=7501|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511013353/http://www.hive4media.com:80/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=7501|title=Dimension Confesses 'Sin'|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archive-date=May 11, 2005|date=May 9, 2005|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] released a two-disc [[Blu-ray]] version with [[DTS-HD Master Audio]], which includes a theatrical and extended, unrated, recut of 147 minutes, on April 21, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Today on Blu-ray - April 21 |url=https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=2602 |access-date=29 December 2020 |work=blu-ray.com |date=21 April 2009 |archive-date=August 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830100012/http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=2602 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Critical reception {{Anchor|Critics}} ===\n''Sin City'' opened on April 1, 2005, to generally positive reviews.

Don't let the movies fool you: Roger Rabbit was guilty,\" with regard to the increasing use of digitisation within films to replace the human elements. He applauds the fact Rodriguez \"has rendered a gorgeous world of silvery shadows that updates the expressionist cinematography of postwar noir\" but bemoans that several elements of \"old film noirs has been digitally broomed away\", resulting instead in a film that \"offers sensation without feeling, death without grief, sin without guilt, and, ultimately, novelty without surprise\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/movies/24scot.html?ex=1271995200&en=83f36c443f1c41eb&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=The Unreal Road From Toontown to 'Sin City' |date=April 24, 2005 |author=Scott, A.
