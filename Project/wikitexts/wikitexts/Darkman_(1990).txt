Based on a [[short story]] Raimi wrote that paid [[homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s [[horror film]]s of the 1930s, the film stars [[Liam Neeson]] as scientist [[Darkman (character)|Peyton Westlake]], who is brutally attacked, disfigured, and left for dead by ruthless mobster Robert Durant ([[Larry Drake]]), after his girlfriend, attorney Julie Hastings ([[Frances McDormand]]), runs afoul of corrupt developer Louis Strack Jr. ([[Colin Friels]]). After a treatment to cure him of his burn injuries fails, Westlake develops super-human abilities, which also have the unintended side-effect of rendering him mentally unstable and borderline psychotic. Consumed with vengeance, he decides to hunt down those who disfigured him.\n\nUnable to secure the rights to ''[[The Shadow]]'', Raimi decided to create his own [[superhero]] and struck a deal with Universal Studios to make his first [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studio film. It was produced by [[Robert Tapert]], and was written by Raimi, his brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]], [[Chuck Pfarrer]], and brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin. Makeup effects artist [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]], who also cameos in the film as the Lizard Man in the carnival Freak Show sequence, designed and created the makeup effects required to turn Neeson into Darkman.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nNeeson's first action film in the main role, ''Darkman'' received generally positive reviews by critics and was commercially successful, grossing $48 million, above its $14 million budget. This financial success spawned two direct-to-video [[sequel]]s, ''[[Darkman II: The Return of Durant]]'' (1995) and ''[[Darkman III: Die Darkman Die]]'' (1996), as well as comic books, video games, and action figures. Neeson did not reprise his role for the direct-to-video sequels.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Darkman (character)|Dr. Peyton Westlake]] is developing a new type of synthetic skin to help burn victims but cannot get past a flaw that causes the skin to rapidly disintegrate after 99 minutes. His girlfriend, attorney Julie Hastings, discovers the Belisarius Memorandum, an incriminating document that proves developer Louis Strack Jr. has been bribing members of the zoning commission. When she confronts Strack, he confesses, showing Julie that he plans to design a brand-new city, creating a substantial number of new jobs. He warns Julie that the city's reigning crime boss, Robert G. Durant, also wants the document.\n\nAt Westlake's lab, Westlake and his assistant Yakitito are testing the skin when the lights go out. The synthetic skin remains stable after 100 minutes, so Westlake deduces that the skin is [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]]. Their joy is short lived as Durant and his mobsters show up and demand the Memorandum, which Westlake knows nothing about. They search for the document, and Durant has his men kill Yakitito and beat Westlake, burning his hands and dipping his face in acid. After finding the document, they rig the lab to explode. Julie witnesses the blast as a hideously burned Westlake is thrown through the roof and into the river. As a [[John Doe]], he is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the [[spinothalamic tract]]; physical pain is no longer felt at the cost of tactile sensation. This loss of sensory input gives him [[enhanced strength]] due to [[Adrenaline|adrenal]] overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but also mentally destabilizes him. After waking up from a coma, Westlake escapes from the hospital.\n\nBelieved dead by Julie, Westlake re-establishes his lab in a condemned building and begins a long process of digitization to create a mask of his original face, using the time to plot revenge against Durant and his men. He kills Durant's henchman Rick by putting his head in front of an incoming car after forcing him to reveal the identities of the other men. He then studies them to subdue and impersonate them (having a talent for [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionism]]). When his face mask is complete, Westlake manages to convince Julie that he was in a coma rather than dead. He mentions that he is aware of Julie seeing Strack after his supposed death; she responds that Strack only comforted her. Keeping his disfigurement from her, Westlake instead probes whether she would accept him despite his appearance.\n\nWestlake sows dissension and confusion among Durant's henchmen by assuming their identities. On a date at a carnival with Julie, Westlake loses his temper after an altercation over a stuffed elephant and assaults a worker, revealing to Julie that something is wrong with him. He flees as his face begins to melt, and she follows him, discovering the discarded mask; she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him before discovering the stolen Memorandum on his desk, confirming that he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her as long as he has the Memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake.\n\nDurant intercepts Julie, kidnapping her before attacking Westlake's lair. Two of his men enter the lab to locate and kill Westlake but are outmaneuvered and eliminated. Durant flees in a helicopter with Westlake dangling from an attached cable, which he uses to crash the helicopter. Impersonating Durant, Westlake meets up with Strack and a captive Julie at the top of an unfinished building. Strack breaks Westlake's ruse, and they fight; Westlake eventually gains the upper hand and dangles Strack by his ankle in the air. Strack says that killing him would not be something he could live with. Westlake drops Strack, remarking: \"I'm learning to live with a lot of things\". Julie tries to convince Westlake that he can still return to his old life, but he tells her he has changed internally as well, and cannot subject anyone to his new, vicious nature. He rushes from Julie as they exit an elevator, pulling on a mask and running into a crowd of pedestrians. As Julie unsuccessfully searches for him, a disguised Westlake watches her for a few moments before turning and walking away, narrating, \"I am everyone and no one. Everywhere. Nowhere. Call me... Darkman\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Darkman (character)|Dr. Peyton Westlake / Darkman]], a brilliant scientist who was left for dead and burned alive as he returns to seek revenge on those who disfigured him. Initially, Raimi's longtime friend and collaborator [[Bruce Campbell]] was set to play Darkman, but the studio rejected the idea because they did not think Campbell could carry the role.<ref name=\"Muir\">{{cite book | last = Muir | first = John Kenneth | title = The Unseen Force: The Films of Sam Raimi | publisher = Applause Books | date = May 2004 | isbn= 978-1557836076}}</ref> Campbell cameos in the film as Peyton's last seen disguise (credited as \"[[Fake Shemp|Final Shemp]]\"). [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Bill Paxton]] were also considered before Liam Neeson was cast.<ref name= \"Muir\" /> For the role, Raimi was looking for someone who could suggest \"a monster with the soul of a man, and I needed an actor who could do that beneath a lot of makeup\" and liked Neeson's \"old [[Gary Cooper]] charisma\".<ref name= \"Counts2\">{{cite news | last = Counts | first = Kyle | title = Heart of Darkness | work = [[Starlog]] | date = December 1990 | url = https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-161/page/n44/mode/1up?q=darkman |via= Internet Archive}}</ref> The actor was drawn to the [[The Phantom of the Opera|operatic nature of the story]] and the inner turmoil of his character.<ref name= \"Counts2\" /> To research for the role, Neeson contacted the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors, an organization that supports the emotional and social healing of burn survivors.<ref name= \"Counts2\" />\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Julie Hastings, an attorney and Peyton's love interest. Raimi had wanted to work with Frances McDormand but the studio resisted this notion and almost cast [[Julia Roberts]] before ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' made her a star.<ref name= \"Muir\" /> At one point, they wanted [[Demi Moore]] for the role.<ref name= \"Muir\" /> The director even tested [[Bridget Fonda]] but felt that she was too young for Neeson.<ref name= \"Muir\"/> McDormand described the character saying \"this is the first bimbo I've played\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Darkman Lover |url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-158/page/n36/mode/1up?q=darkman |website=Starlog Magazine Issue 158 |via= Internet Archive}}[https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-158/158_djvu.txt Text only copy]</ref>\n* [[Colin Friels]] as Louis Strack Jr., a corrupt and haughty billionaire developer who runs Strack Industries. He bribes members of the city zoning commission to further his ambitious construction project (which he dubs the \"City of the Future\"), and employs Durant and his mobsters to eliminate anyone who interferes, even his own wife. He and Darkman have their final battle atop one of Strack's half-finished skyscrapers at the film's climax.\n* [[Larry Drake]] as Robert G. Durant, a ruthless and sadistic mob boss who works under the payroll of Strack. He auditioned for the film and Raimi liked the way he underplayed the character, \"quiet and careful, yet intense\", the actor remembers.<ref name= \"Counts, Kyle\">{{cite news | last = Counts | first = Kyle | title = Black Heart | work = [[Starlog]] | date = January 1991}}</ref> Raimi had never seen ''[[L.A. Law]]'' but found that Drake's face reminded him of \"a modern day [[Edward G. Robinson]]. He looked so mean, so domineering, yet he had this urban wit about him. I thought, 'My God, this guy is not only threatening-looking, he has a good physical presence \u2013 what a perfect adversary for the Darkman!'\"<ref name= \"Counts, Kyle\"/>\n* Nelson Mashita as Yakitito \"Yakky\" Yanagito, lab assistant to Peyton Westlake. He is killed by Anderson.\n* [[Ted Raimi]] as Rick Anderson, Robert G. Durant's henchman: an unassuming-looking man, he is treated more like a very close friend or confidant/protege by Durant. He is the first henchman killed by Darkman, getting his head run over.\n* [[Nicholas Worth]] as Pauly Mazzuchelli, Robert G. Durant's henchman: a stocky, physically imposing man, he has a shaved head and a small tattoo of a dagger (and a single drop of blood) on the right side. He is the first person impersonated by Darkman, stealing a money drop. He is the second henchman killed; Durant believed Pauly stole the drop money and found tickets to Rio for Pauly and the still missing Rick, and threw Pauly out the window.\n* [[Dan Hicks (actor)|Dan Hicks]] as Skip Altwater, his left leg is false (making it ideal for concealing weapons). He's last seen during the attack on Darkman's lair - while abducting Julie - and doesn't appear for the rest of the film. A cut/deleted scene shows Darkman killing Skip with his own prosthetic leg.\n* [[Jessie Lawrence Ferguson]] as Eddie Black, a rival crime boss, dispatched by Durant.\n* Rafael H. Robledo as Rudy Guzman, a collaborator of Durant's, who seems to despise Durant, calling Durant a \"son of a [bitch]\". He is killed by Smiley when a shackled and gagged Guzman runs into him wearing a Westlake mask underneath a Smiley mask, tricking Smiley into shooting Guzman.\n* Dan Bell as Sam \"Smiley\" Rogers, a henchman of Durant's who laughs like a hyena, he is the most ruthless of Durant's collaborators. He is killed after Darkman recreated the same drinking bird triggered gas explosion that mutilated Peyton.\n* Arsenio \"Sonny\" Trinidad as Hung Fat, a Chinese Triad boss who owes Durant money.\n* [[Bridget Hoffman]] as Computer Voice\n\nAdditionally, Raimi's brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] and director [[John Landis]] have cameos as hospital staff, while [[Jenny Agutter]] plays the doctor treating Westlake's burns. [[Neal McDonough]], [[William Lustig]], [[Scott Spiegel]] and [[Stuart Cornfeld]] portray dockworkers. Other appearances include [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]] as the driver and passenger in an Oldsmobile, [[Professor Toru Tanaka]] and [[Nathan Jung]] as Hung Fat's Chinese Warriors, and [[Julius Harris]] as the Gravedigger. In the final scene of the film, Campbell portrays the disguised Darkman as he flees, credited as \"[[Fake Shemp|Final Shemp]]\".\n\n==Production==\n===Development and origins===\nThe idea for ''Darkman'' developed from a short story Raimi had written about a man who could change his face.<ref name= \"Warren, Bill\">{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | title = ''The Evil Dead'' Companion | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | date = January 15, 2001}}</ref> The story drew elements from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', and ''The Shadow''<ref name= \"Warren, Bill\"/> (Raimi had previously sought the film rights to ''The Shadow''; when rejected, he decided to write his own [[superhero]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Bruce |title=If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor |date=Aug 24, 2002 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9780312291457 |pages=203 |edition=reprint}}</ref> Raimi was also inspired by the Universal horror films of the 1930s and 1940s because \"they made me fear the hideous nature of the hero and at the same time drew me to him. I went back to that idea of the man who is noble and turns into a monster\".<ref name= \"Johnston, Sheila\">{{cite news | last = Johnston | first = Sheila | title = Beauty Within the Beast | work = [[The Independent]] | date = November 9, 1990}}</ref> He originally wrote a 30-page short story, titled \"The Darkman\", and then developed into a 40-page treatment. At this point, according to Raimi, \"it became the story of a man who had lost his face and had to take on other faces, a man who battled criminals using this power\".<ref name= \"Warren, Bill\"/> It also became more of a tragic love story in the tradition of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. In 1987, Raimi submitted the treatment to Universal Pictures which they liked, green-lighted a budget in the range of $8\u201312 million, and suggested that he get a screenwriter to flesh out the story.<ref name= \"Warren2\"/>\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Joshua Goldin Shankbone 2009 Tribeca.jpg|thumb|175px|Screenwriter Joshua Goldin.]]\nThe more Raimi worked, the more Darkman became a crime-fighting figure like [[Batman]], \"a non-superpowered man who, here, is a hideous thing who fights crime. As he became that hideous thing, it became more like ''The Phantom of the Opera'', the creature who wants the girl but who was too much of a beast to have her\", according to Raimi.<ref name= \"Warren, Bill\"/> The process of developing his treatment into a screenplay was difficult with Raimi hiring ex-[[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] [[Chuck Pfarrer]] based on his work on ''[[Navy SEALs (film)|Navy SEALs]]''.<ref name= \"Italie, Hillel\">{{cite news | last = Italie | first = Hillel | title = Beauties, Beasts and 'Biff!' 'Bam!' 'Pow!' | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = September 12, 1990}}</ref> He wrote the first draft and then Raimi's brother, Ivan (a doctor), wrote drafts two through four with Sam. Ivan made sure that the medical aspects and scientific elements were authentic as possible given the nature of the story.<ref name= \"Stanley, John\">{{cite news | last = Stanley | first = John | title = ''Darkman'' Brings Director's Talent to Light | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = August 26, 1990}}</ref>\n\nAs Raimi and his producing partner [[Robert Tapert]] progressed through various drafts, they realized they had a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and \"lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions\".<ref name= \"Warren, Bill\"/> Goldin said that they \"spent a lot of time talking and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the nuts and bolts of the story\".<ref name= \"Muir\"/> The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script.<ref name= \"Stanley, John\"/> For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, \"I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves\".<ref name= \"Stanley, John\"/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nWorking with Universal meant a significant budgetary increase for Raimi, allowing him to design and build a laboratory set for Darkman and afford helicopters and professional stuntmen to film the climactic helicopter chase through the city.<ref name= \"Portman, Jamie\">{{cite news | last = Portman | first = Jamie | title = Horror can be a labor of love | work = [[Toronto Star]] | date = August 16, 1990}}</ref> He was eventually given $14 million to work with, including a longer schedule and much more effects work.\n\nVisually, the filmmaker was interested in paying homage to Universal horror films of the 1930s. Production designer Randy Ser remarked, \"if you look at Darkman's lab that he moves into, which is an old warehouse, what was on my mind was Dr. Frankenstein. There were a number of references visually to what we were thinking about in regards to those films\".<ref name= \"Muir\"/> Raimi consciously wanted to tone down his style because of a desire to \"get into the characters' heads and follow them as real human beings in extraordinary circumstances\".<ref name= \"Warren2\"/>\n\nMcDormand and Neeson worked closely in rehearsals, rewriting the three love scenes they had together after he becomes Darkman. They got through these scenes, according to the actress, by depending on \"each other's knowledge, of theater and each other\".<ref name= \"Counts2\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot on location in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Toronto, Ontario]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://movielocationsandmore.blogspot.com/2014/06/darkman-1990.html|title=Movie Locations and More: Darkman (1990)|last=Robert|date=2014-06-30|website=Movie Locations and More|access-date=2018-03-30}}</ref>\n\nRaimi said directing McDormand was \"very difficult\".<ref name=\"Warren2\">{{cite news | last = Warren | first = Bill | title = The Man Behind ''Darkman'' | work = [[Fangoria]] | date = September 1990}}</ref> Raimi said, \"apparently I didn't know Fran as well as I thought I did ... The reason it was difficult was that our conception of the best movie to make differed, arguing in trying to make the best picture possible. We did come across disagreements, but they were very healthy\".<ref name=\"Warren2\" />\n\nDurant's finger collection developed over the Pfarrer and Raimi brothers drafts. The director wanted a specific trademark for the character \u2013 one that hinted at a military background.<ref name= \"Counts, Kyle\"/>\n\nNeeson worked in ten-piece prosthetic makeup, sometimes for 18 hours.<ref name= \"Johnston, Sheila\"/> He saw the lengthy time spent in extensive makeup as a challenge and liked \"the idea of working behind a mask on camera, and just exploring the possibilities of what that entailed\".<ref name= \"Counts2\"/> He and makeup effects designer [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]] did tests using specific glues, foams, and bandage coverings. They also timed how fast they could apply the prosthetic makeup and put the costume on. Neeson worked with the costume designer on his outfit, including aspects like the cloak.<ref name= \"Counts2\"/> The hardest part for the actor was speaking with false teeth and he ended up doing \"a lot of work on my voice \u2013 I didn't want the [false teeth] to move at all\".<ref name= \"Counts2\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nRaimi and Tapert ran into conflicts with the studio during [[post-production]]. The director had a problem with the editor that the studio assigned him and eight weeks into assembling the rough cut, he was not following Raimi's storyboards. The editor had a nervous breakdown and left.<ref name= \"McDonagh, Maitland\">{{cite book | last = McDonagh | first = Maitland | title = Filmmaking on the Fringe | year = 1995 | isbn= 978-0806515571}}</ref> Early preview screenings did not go well as people laughed in the wrong places and complained about a lack of a happy ending.<ref name= \"Arnold, Gary\">{{cite news | last = Arnold | first = Gary | title = Sam Raimi's Flair Makes ''Darkman'' A Reel Delight | work = [[The Washington Times]] | date = August 23, 1990}}</ref> Universal told Raimi that some people rated ''Darkman'' the worst film they had ever seen. According to executives, the film was one of the worst-scoring pictures in Universal's history.<ref name= \"McDonagh, Maitland\"/> Then, two preview screenings, one with Danny Elfman's score, went well. Tapert remembers, \"the experience on ''Darkman'' was very difficult for Sam and me; it isn't the picture we thought it should be, based on the footage we shot and all that. The studio got nervous about some kind of wild things in it, and made us take them out, which was unfortunate\".<ref name= \"Muir\"/> Raimi did like the \"brilliant\" marketing campaign that the studio came up with, releasing posters in advance with a silhouette of the main character and the question, \"Who is Darkman?\" According to the director, \"the marketing made the film a money-maker\".<ref name= \"McDonagh, Maitland\"/>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Darkman: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Film score\n| artist     = [[Danny Elfman]]\n| cover      = \n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = August 17, 1990\n| recorded   = 1990\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 40:09\n| label      = [[MCA Records|MCA]]\n| producer   = Danny Elfman\n| prev_title = Dick Tracy\n| prev_year  = 1990\n| next_title = [[Batman Returns (soundtrack)|Batman Returns]]\n| next_year  = 1992\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r84258}}</ref>\n| noprose   = yes\n}}\nReleased on August 17, 1990, the soundtrack to ''Darkman'' was composed by [[Danny Elfman]], who previously scored the music to [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' in 1989.

Darkman's headquarters are in an abandoned observatory overlooking the city, and he is wanted by the police for his actions against Durant's gang.
