Based loosely on fact, the film tells the story of Wild West outlaws Robert LeRoy Parker, known as [[Butch Cassidy]] ([[Paul Newman]]), and his partner Harry Longabaugh, the \"[[Sundance Kid]]\" ([[Robert Redford]]), who are on the run from a crack US posse after a string of train robberies. The pair and Sundance's lover, [[Etta Place]] ([[Katharine Ross]]), flee to [[Bolivia]] to escape the posse.\n\nIn 2003, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Librarian of Congress Adds 25 Films to National Film Registry|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-03-211/25-films-added-to-national-film-registry/2003-12-16/|access-date=September 18, 2020|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222231120/https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-03-211/25-films-added-to-national-film-registry/2003-12-16/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|access-date=September 18, 2020|website=Library of Congress|archive-date=December 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217172059/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|url-status=live}}</ref> The American Film Institute ranked ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' as the 73rd-greatest American film on its \"[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]]\" list, and number 50 on the original list. [[Butch Cassidy]] and the [[Sundance Kid]] were ranked 20th-greatest heroes on \"[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]\". ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' was selected by the [[American Film Institute]] as the 7th-greatest Western of all time in the [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] list in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1899 [[Wyoming]], [[Butch Cassidy]] is the affable, clever, talkative leader of the outlaw [[Hole-in-the-Wall Gang]]. His closest companion is the laconic [[Sharpshooter|dead-shot]] \"[[Sundance Kid]]\". The two return to their hideout at [[Hole-in-the-Wall]] (Wyoming) to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Cassidy's long absences, have selected [[Harvey Logan]] as their new leader.\n\nLogan challenges Cassidy to a [[knife fight]] over the gang's leadership. Cassidy defeats him using trickery, but embraces Logan's idea to rob the [[Union Pacific]] ''[[Overland Flyer]]'' train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and likely reap even more money than the first.\n\nThe first robbery goes well. To celebrate, Cassidy visits a favorite [[brothel]] in a nearby town and watches, amused, as the town marshal unsuccessfully attempts to organize a [[Posse comitatus|posse]] to track down the gang, only to have his address to the townsfolk hijacked by a friendly bicycle salesman (he calls it \"the future\"). Sundance visits his lover, schoolteacher [[Etta Place]], and they spend the night together. Cassidy joins up with them early the next morning, and takes Place for a ride on his new bike.\n\nOn the second train robbery, Cassidy uses too much [[dynamite]] to blow open the [[safe]], which is much larger than the safe on the previous job. The explosion demolishes the baggage car in the process. As the gang scrambles to gather up the money, a second train arrives carrying a six-man team of lawmen. The crack squad doggedly pursues Cassidy and Sundance, who try various ruses to get away, all of which fail. They try to hide out in the brothel, and then to seek [[amnesty]] from the friendly Sheriff Bledsoe, but he tells them their days are numbered and all they can do is flee.\n\nAs the posse remains in pursuit, despite all attempts to elude them, Cassidy and Sundance determine that the group includes renowned Indian [[tracking (hunting)|tracker]] \"Lord Baltimore\" and relentless lawman [[Joe Lefors]], recognizable by his white [[boater|skimmer]]. They finally elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Place that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head [[E. H. Harriman]] to remain on their trail until they are both killed.\n\nCassidy convinces Sundance and Place that the three should go to [[Bolivia]], which he envisions as a robber's paradise. On their arrival there, Sundance is dismayed by the living conditions and regards the country with contempt, but Cassidy remains optimistic. They discover that they know too little [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to pull off a bank robbery, so Place attempts to teach them the language. With her as an accomplice, they become successful bank robbers known as {{lang|es|Los Bandidos Yanquis}}. However, their confidence drops when they see a man wearing a white hat (the signature of determined lawman Lefors) and fear that Harriman's posse is still after them.\n\nCassidy suggests \"going straight\", and he and Sundance land their first honest job as [[payroll]] guards for a mining company. However, they are ambushed by local bandits on their first run and their boss, Percy Garris, is killed. They kill the bandits, the first time Cassidy has ever shot someone. Place recommends farming or ranching as other lines of work, but they conclude the straight life isn't for them. Sensing they will be killed should they return to robbery, Place decides to go back to the United States.\n\nCassidy and Sundance steal a payroll and a burro used to carry it, and arrive in a small town. A boy recognizes the burro's [[livestock branding]] and alerts the local police, leading to a gunfight with the outlaws. Cassidy has to make a desperate run to the burro to get ammunition, while Sundance provides covering fire. Wounded, the two men take cover inside a nearby building. Cassidy suggests the duo's next destination should be [[Australia]]. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the two of them, the local police have called on the [[Bolivian Army]] to deal with the two outlaws. Confident of their ability to escape, the pair charge out of the building, guns blazing, directly into a hail of bullets from the massed troops who have occupied all of the surrounding vantage points. The film ends on a freeze-frame, as sounds of the Bolivian troops firing on the doomed outlaws are heard.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Paul Newman]] as [[Butch Cassidy]]\n* [[Robert Redford]] as the [[Sundance Kid]]\n* [[Katharine Ross]] as [[Etta Place]]\n* [[Strother Martin]] as Percy Garris\n* [[Henry Jones (actor)|Henry Jones]] as Bike Salesman\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Sheriff Bledsoe\n* [[George Furth]] as Woodcock\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Agnes\n* [[Ted Cassidy]] as [[Harvey Logan]]\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] as Marshal\n* [[Donnelly Rhodes]] as Macon\n* [[Timothy Scott (actor, born 1937)|Timothy Scott]] as [[William Carver (Wild Bunch)|\"News\" Carver]]\n* [[Charles Dierkop]] as [[Flat Nose Curry]]\n* [[Paul Bryar]] as Card Player #1\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Card Player #2\n* [[Jody Gilbert]] as Large Woman on Train\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nWilliam Goldman first came across the story of [[Butch Cassidy]] in the late 1950s and researched intermittently for eight years before starting to write the screenplay.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goldman, William|title=Adventures in the Screen Trade|date=1982|pages= 191\u2013200}}</ref> Goldman says he wrote the story as an original screenplay because he did not want to do the research to make it as authentic as a novel.<ref name=\"Egan, p. 90\"/> Goldman later stated:\n<blockquote>The whole reason I wrote the ... thing, there is that famous line that Scott Fitzgerald wrote, who was one of my heroes, \"There are no second acts in American lives.\" When I read about Cassidy and Longabaugh and the superposse coming after them\u2014that's phenomenal material. They ran to South America and lived there for eight years and that was what thrilled me: they had a second act. They were more legendary in South America than they had been in the old West ... It's a great story. Those two guys and that pretty girl going down to South America and all that stuff. It just seems to me it's a wonderful piece of material.<ref name=\"Egan, p. 90\">Egan, p. 90</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe characters' flight to South America caused one executive to reject the script, as it was then unusual in Western films for the protagonists to flee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/220486%7C0/The-Big-Idea-Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid.html|title=The Big Idea \u2013 Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid|last=Nixon|first=Rob|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|access-date=February 26, 2017|archive-date=February 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226212904/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/220486%7C0/The-Big-Idea-Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nAccording to Goldman, when he first wrote the script and sent it out for consideration, only one studio wanted to buy it\u2014and that was with the proviso that the two lead characters did not flee to South America. When Goldman protested that that was what had happened, the studio head responded, \"I don't give a shit. All I know is [[John Wayne]] don't run away.\"<ref name=\"Egan, p. 91\">Egan, p. 91</ref>\n\nGoldman rewrote the script, \"didn't change it more than a few pages, and subsequently found that every studio wanted it.\"<ref name=\"Egan, p. 91\"/>\n\nThe role of Sundance was offered to [[Jack Lemmon]], whose production company, JML, had produced the film ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' (1967) starring Newman. Lemmon, however, turned down the role because he did not like riding horses and felt that he had already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kid's character before.<ref>{{cite news| title=A slice of Lemmon for extra character|author=Flynn, Bob |series= Panorama|page= 7|work=The Canberra Times|date= August 15, 1998}}</ref> Other actors considered for the role of Sundance were [[Steve McQueen]] and [[Warren Beatty]], who both turned it down, with Beatty claiming that the film was too similar to ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. According to Goldman, McQueen and Newman both read the scripts at the same time and agreed to do the film. McQueen eventually backed out of the film due to disagreements with Newman. The two actors would eventually team up in the 1974 disaster film ''[[The Towering Inferno]]''. [[Jacqueline Bisset]] was a top contender for the role of Etta Place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/184908595|title=Actress Is Driving Yellow Volkswagen into a Cadillac Future|author=[[Axel Madsen]]|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 14, 1968|access-date=January 23, 2021|archive-date=June 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210613070533/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/184908595/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFilming locations include the ghost town of [[Grafton, Utah|Grafton]], [[Zion National Park]], [[Snow Canyon State Park]], and the city of [[St. George, Utah|St. George]].
