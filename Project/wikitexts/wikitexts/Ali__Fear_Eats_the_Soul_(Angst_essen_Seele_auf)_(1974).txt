The film won the [[International Federation of Film Critics]] award for best in-competition movie and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2216/year/1974.html |title=Festival de Cannes: ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' |access-date=2009-04-26|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It is considered to be one of Fassbinder's most powerful works and is hailed by many as a masterpiece.\n\nThe film revolves around the romance that develops between Emmi, an elderly German woman, and Ali, a Moroccan migrant worker in [[postwar]] West Germany.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place an unspecified number of months after the [[Munich Massacre]] in West Germany. Emmi, a 60-year-old window cleaner and widow, enters a bar, driven in by the rain and wanting to listen to the music being played inside. A woman in the bar tauntingly suggests Ali , a Moroccan ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' ([[guest worker]]) in his late thirties, ask Emmi to dance, to which Emmi accepts. After they dance, they develop a friendship and Ali follows Emmi home, staying at her apartment for the night. After more interaction, they start to fall in love and Ali continues to live with Emmi. Emmi decides to visit her children to introduce them to Ali; daughter Krista and her tyrannical son-in-law Eugen; Eugen thinks she is losing her sanity and Krista thinks that her mother \u2013 who has been a widow for years \u2013 is fantasising.\n\nTheir relationship is threatened when the landlord's son, who has been sent on the assumption that Emmi has taken in a lodger, tells Emmi that subletting is against Emmi's tenancy agreement, and that Ali must leave within a day. Fearful of losing Ali, Emmi claims that she and Ali are planning to marry. After the landlord's son apologises for the misapprehension and leaves, Emmi speaks to Ali and apologises for having invented the idea of her marrying him, but is surprised by Ali when he says that it is an excellent idea. The film then shows them in a civil court, married.\n\nTheir marriage is looked upon negatively by those who live near them, which include apartment tenants and shopkeepers. Emmi is shunned by her work colleagues, and Ali faces discrimination at every turn. When Emmi invites her three grown children and son-in-law to meet Ali, they openly reject him. One of Emmi's sons smashes in her TV set in anger, her other son declares she must have lost her sanity, and her daughter calls her apartment a \"pigsty\" and calls Emmi a \"whore\", before the four of them leave.\n\nEmmi's sadness towards this rejection washes away as her optimism resurfaces and she decides that she and Ali should take a long holiday together to escape the discrimination, convinced that upon their return, they will have been missed and will be welcomed back. After their return, they face less discrimination, but only because neighbouring tenants and shopkeepers see the gain in treating Emmi better, not because they have outgrown their prejudices.\n\nWanting to get back with her old friends, after their apparent renewed respect, Emmi begins to neglect Ali and adopt some of their attitudes toward him. She becomes more strict, ordering him to do more things. When co-workers visit and remark on how surprisingly clean he is and comment on his muscles, she shows him off as if he were an object. This causes Ali to leave, and to seek comfort in bar maid Barbara, with whom he has apparently had a relationship prior to meeting Emmi.  When he leaves Emmi to her friends, she attributes it to his \"mood swings\" and notes that it must be his \"foreigner mentality\", adopting the attitudes of her friends in order to fit in. This causes them to drift apart, with Ali not standing up to Emmi because of the insecurities he faces as an immigrant. He returns to the bar maid, spending the night with her. Emmi visits him at work, where he pretends he doesn't know her as his workmates make fun of her age, calling her Ali's \"Moroccan grandmother\".\n\nWhen it seems as if the relationship is beyond repair, Emmi goes back to the bar where they first met to meet with Ali and has the barmaid put the same song on the jukebox that led to their dance in the beginning of the film. They decide to dance together, and, while dancing, Emmi emphasizes that she knows she is old and that he is free to come and go, but tells him that when they are together, they must be nice to each other. He agrees and they declare their love for each other. In that moment, Ali collapses in Emmi's arms from what turns out to be a burst [[stomach ulcer]]. The film then shows Emmi with Ali in the hospital, where a doctor tells her the illness is common among foreign workers because of the stress they face in everyday life; the doctor then adds that Ali will have surgery to remove the ulcer, but that he will probably be back in six months with another ulcer. Emmi declares that she will do everything in her power to prevent this and holds Ali's hand.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brigitte Mira]] \u2013 Emmi Kurowski\n* [[El Hedi ben Salem]] \u2013 Ali\n* [[Barbara Valentin]] \u2013 Barbara\n* [[Irm Hermann]] \u2013 Krista\n* [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] \u2013 Eugen\n* Karl Scheydt \u2013 Albert Kurowski\n* [[Marquard Bohm]] \u2013 Gruber\n* [[Walter Sedlmayr]] \u2013 Angermayer\n* Doris Mattes \u2013 Mrs. Angermeyer (as Doris Mathes)\n* Lilo Pempeit \u2013 Mrs. M\u00fcnchmeyer\n* Gusti Kreissl \u2013 Paula\n* [[Margit Symo]] \u2013 Hedwig\n* Elisabeth Bertram \u2013 Frieda\n* Helga Ballhaus \u2013 Yolanda\n* [[Elma Karlowa]] \u2013 Mrs. Kargus\n* Anita Bucher \u2013 Mrs. Ellis\n* Katharina Herberg \u2013 Woman in Bar\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in just under two weeks, and was planned as an exercise in film-making for Fassbinder, to fill in the time in his schedule between the work on two other films, ''[[Martha (1974 film)|Martha]]'' and ''[[Effi Briest (1974 film)|Effi Briest]]''.{{ref|1}}\n\nAli is played by [[El Hedi ben Salem]], who was Fassbinder's [[significant other|partner]] at the time. Fassbinder himself has a cameo appearance as Emmi's son in law. [[Irm Hermann]], who plays Emmi's daughter Krista, had a turbulent relationship with Fassbinder in real life, having been quoted as saying of Fassbinder, \"He couldn't conceive of my refusing him, and he tried everything. He almost beat me to death on the streets of [[Bochum]] ....\".<ref>{{harv|Baer|1986|p=65}}</ref> And Fassbinder himself grew up under some of the domestic effects of immigrant prejudice, given that his mother immigrated back to Germany from Poland after the Soviet Occupation and Fassbinder grew up in a turbulent and eventually divorcing household where immigrating relatives stayed with them.<ref>{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=3}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Watson|1992|p=13}}</ref>\n\nThe original German title ''Angst essen Seele auf'' is deliberately grammatically incorrect, translating literally as \"Fear eat soul up.\"  The correct German form would be ''\"Angst isst die Seele auf''\" \u2013 which (without the definite article \"die\") became the title of a related 2002 short film also starring Mira. The title is one of the things Ali tells Emmi. As an immigrant, he speaks in what can be referred to as  \"broken German\" consistently throughout the film. The line of dialogue he utters is simply \"Fear eat soul up.\" Since Ali's poor German grammar is translated literally in the film's English subtitles, the subtitles for Ali's dialogue are similarly riddled with grammatical errors.\n\n''Ali'' is in part an homage to the films of [[Douglas Sirk]], in particular ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1959) and ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'' (1955). The most overt homage is the scene in which Emmi's son kicks in the television (an important symbol in ''All That Heaven Allows'') after finding out that his mother has married a [[north African]].<ref name=Toteberg>{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1068-ali-fear-eats-the-soul-all-that-fassbinder-allows |title=Ali: Fear Eats the Soul: All That Fassbinder Allows |first=Michael |last=T\u00f6teberg |date=1990 }} Posting of a published essay by Fassbinder's biographer and editor.</ref>\n\n==Themes and symbolism==\n\"Fear eats the soul\", which is one of the things Ali says while talking with Emmi early in the movie, becomes almost literal later on, when it turns out that Ali has a stomach ulcer and is hospitalised. The characters are also often shown on screen in exaggerated ways; characters are shown far away from the camera to emphasise how distant from society Emmi and Ali feel, while their apartment is shot in a claustrophobic manner, to symbolise the fear they feel in their relationship and everyday life. Spectatorship in the film embodies social oppression against marginalized individuals, yet ironically, such distancing diminishes when the neighbourhood sees a utilitarian need in Emmi and Ali, as \"productive and consuming bodies\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gorfinkel |first1=Elena |editor1-first=Brigitte |editor1-last=Peucker |title=Ali: Fear Eats the Soul and Fassbinder's Asynchronous Bodies |date=28 May 2012 |publisher=2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd |isbn=9781405191630 |pages=505\u2013510|doi=10.1002/9781118275733 }}</ref><ref name=\"Ebert Digital LLC\">{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Great Movie: Ali: Fear Eats the Soul|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-ali-fear-eats-the-soul-1974|website=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=27 April 1997|access-date=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' was released in West Germany on March 5, 1974.<ref name=\"filmportal.de\">{{cite web|url=https://www.filmportal.de/en/movie/angst-essen-seele-auf_ea43d4a6c4655006e03053d50b37753d|publisher=[[Filmportal.de]]|title=Angst essen Seele auf|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=de}}</ref> The film has been released by [[the Criterion Collection]] as a region 1 DVD with English subtitles.<ref name=DVD>{{cite AV media |title=Ali: Fear Eats the Soul |publisher=The Criterion Collection |type=Blu-Ray (region 1) |date=September 30, 2014 |oclc=892562488 |isbn=9781604659030}}  See {{cite AV media |title=Ali: Fear Eats the Soul |publisher=The Criterion Collection |type=DVD (region 1) |date=June 24, 2003 |oclc=779179093 |isbn=9781559409391}}</ref> The Blu-Ray contains the contents of both disks of the 2003 DVD release, which include interviews with actress Brigitte Mira and editor Thea Eymes.

I\u2019m sure of it. His style and tone are so adamant that audiences sometimes just sit in silence, uncertain of the right response. With some films, that indicates the director's loss of control over tone. With Fassbinder, it seems to be the response he wants.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Ali: Fear eats the soul review|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ali-fear-eats-the-soul-1974|work=Chicago Sun-Times|via=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=5 October 1974|access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref> Gene Moskowitz of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave it a similarly positive review, calling the film \"Not showy for exploitation, too observant and cool for robust hypoing\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Gene|title=Film Reviews: Angst essen seele auf (Fear eats the soul)|url=https://cinefiles.bampfa.berkeley.edu/cinefiles/DocDetail?docId=2983|magazine=Variety|via=[[CineFiles]]|date=22 May 1974|access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref> Vincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' dissented somewhat, calling it a \"courageous attempt\" and praising Mira and Salem's performances, while criticizing the \"posterlike blandness\" of the movie.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent|title=At the Film Festival: 'Ali'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/07/archives/at-the-film-festivalali-fassbinder-explore-racial-prejudice-the.html|work=The New York Times|date=7 October 1974|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref> Despite the acclaim his movie received, Fassbinder stated that he thought it was only the eighth best movie he made.<ref name=\"NYTretrospec\"/>\n\n===Modern reception===\nThe film has continued to receive positive reviews, with Mira and Salem's acting being praised as a highlight.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Regarded as one of the high-water marks in German New Wave cinema of the 1970s, ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' is at once an intense portrayal of a relationship and a tribute to one of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's film heroes, Douglas Sirk.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Angst essen Seele auf (Ali: Fear Eats the Soul)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fear_of_fear/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=13 September 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Scorsese]] included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/10/scorseses-list-of-39-essential-foreign-films.html |title=Martin Scorsese Creates a List of 39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker |publisher=Open Culture |date=15 October 2014 |access-date=1 February 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207201938/http://www.openculture.com/2014/10/scorseses-list-of-39-essential-foreign-films.html |archive-date=February 7, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Alex Abramovich calls ''Ali'' \"The most thought-provoking, and beautiful, of [Fassbinder's] films\"<ref name=NYTretrospec/> Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the direction, saying \"Fassbinder uses the camera with a precise, novelistic touch\", and also praised Fassbinder's tributes to other films, saying \"...[Fassbinder] didn't just make use of prior forms, he quoted them, and derived from them the ironies implicit in his melodramatic styles.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|title=DVD of the Week: Ali: Fear Eats the Soul|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-ali-fear-eats-the-soul|magazine=The New Yorker|date=15 March 2010|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Peter Bradshaw calls Mira and Salem's performance \"superb\", and \"The most purely lovable characters I have ever seen on a movie screen\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Fear Eats the Soul review \u2013 love versus racism in Fassbinder's exquisite tale|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/30/fear-eats-the-soul-review-love-versus-racism-in-fassbinders-exquisite-tale|work=The Guardian|date=30 March 2017|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref> Re-reviewing the movie for his ''[[Great Movies]]'' series of essays, [[Roger Ebert]] calls the film \"very powerful\" and ends his review by saying, \"\u201cAli: Fear Eats the Soul\u201d might sound like improbable, contrived soap opera.
