It stars [[Hugh Grant]] as a washed-up screenwriter who begins teaching at [[Binghamton University]], and [[Marisa Tomei]] as a single mother with whom the screenwriter finds romance. It began development at [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] in October 2012, and filming began in New York in April 2013.\n\n''The Rewrite'' premiered at the [[Shanghai International Film Festival]] on {{nowrap|June 15}}, 2014, and was released in the United States on February 13, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bupipedream.com/release/46914/binghamton-set-movie-8216the-rewrite8217-to-screen-on-campus-with-star-hugh-grant-and-director-marc-lawrence/|title=Binghamton-set movie 'The Rewrite' to screen on campus with star Hugh Grant and director Marc Lawrence|date=30 January 2015|website=Bupipedream.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nKeith Michaels is a [[divorce]]d and [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] screenwriter whose only successful work was ''Paradise Misplaced'', which won the Best Screenplay Award fifteen years ago. Unemployed and low on funds after a long period of unsuccessful pitching, he reluctantly takes up a job teaching screenwriting at [[Binghamton University]] in [[Upstate New York]].\n\nOn arrival, Keith angers fellow professor Mary Weldon with derogatory comments about Jane Austen and other misogynistic behavior; he also strikes up an unethical relationship with a young undergraduate student, Karen Gabney, which ends quickly. Keith also does not believe in the concept of teaching and is scornful of his job, as exemplified by his selecting mostly women students for his class based solely on their appearance and then dismissing the class for a month.\n\nAfter being publicly challenged by an outraged Karen about his competence, Keith starts to devote more time and effort to coaching his students and helping them discover their passion and improve their writing; he finds great potential in Clem Ronson, a [[Shyness|shy]] and awkward [[nerd]], whose script quickly garners the interest of Keith\u2019s agent, Elle. \n\nKeith also forms a friendship with mature student Holly Carpenter, a single mother of two who is in a steady but unloving relationship. They often disagree on their perspectives on life, where Keith believes that nothing will salvage his failing career or mend his relationship with his estranged son Alex, whereas Holly maintains an optimistic outlook on life and believes that with effort, talents can be [[Late bloomer|developed]] and problems can be solved. Despite their differences, Keith finds enlightenment in Holly\u2019s advice and makes the first move in contacting Alex.\n\nHowever, Keith\u2019s problems worsen when his outline for ''Paradise Misplaced II'' gets rejected and he faces expulsion from the school after his short-lived relationship with Karen is exposed. In frustration, Keith gets into an argument with Holly and decides to leave the school. As a last parting gesture, he accompanies Clem to [[Manhattan]] to meet with Hollywood film producers. Halfway through the meeting, Keith has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] about how he has helped his students and, leaving a newly confident Clem to resume the meeting by himself, he heads back to [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] to save his job \u2014 which he manages to do with a sincere apology to Professor Weldon. \n\nIn a revelation of his renewed priorities, Keith expresses admiration for Holly\u2019s determination in life and they show a mutual interest in each other. He also declines Elle's invitation to return to Hollywood, as he has decided to stay in Binghamton to teach and write a screenplay based on his experience there; and he tells Elle not to call during class hours.\n\nKeith is welcomed back warmly by his students and apologizes to them for the confusing almost leaving, and then coming back. The film ends with Keith's phone flashing with a voicemail from Alex.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Keith Michaels\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Holly Carpenter\n* [[Bella Heathcote]] as Karen Gabney\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Mary Weldon\n* [[J.

She found that Grant \"embraces his maturity\" as an older version of his typical character but that Tomei's character was \"painfully underwritten\".
