Koch]] and written by [[Neil Simon]], based on [[The Odd Couple (play)|his 1965 play]]. It stars [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Walter Matthau]] as two divorced men, neurotic neat-freak Felix Ungar and fun-loving slob Oscar Madison, who decide to live together.\n\nThe film was successful with critics and grossed over $44.5 million,<ref name=\"box office\"/> making it the [[1968 in film|third highest-grossing film of 1968 in the United States]]. The success of the film was the basis for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|television sitcom of the same name]], starring [[Tony Randall]] and [[Jack Klugman]] as Felix and Oscar.\n\nA [[sequel]], ''[[The Odd Couple II]]'', was released 1998, almost three decades later, in which Lemmon and Matthau reprised their roles. However, it was a critical and commercial failure.<ref name=Mojo/>\n\n== Plot ==\nNewly separated Felix Ungar wanders [[New York City]] in a daze with vague ideas of committing [[suicide]].\n\nDivorced sports writer Oscar Madison and his card-playing cronies Murray, Speed, Roy and  Vinnie have assembled in Madison's [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] apartment for their Friday night [[poker]] game. Murray is concerned because their mutual friend Felix Ungar is unusually late for the game. Murray's wife calls and informs them that Felix is missing. Oscar then calls Felix's wife Frances, who tells him that she and Felix have broken up. Felix arrives not knowing that everyone has already heard that he and his wife have separated. The group attempts to pretend nothing is wrong, but Felix eventually breaks down crying and his friends attempt to console him. After everyone leaves, Oscar suggests that Felix move in with him, since Oscar has lived alone since he split up with his own ex-wife, Blanche, some time earlier. Felix agrees and urges Oscar to not be shy about letting him know if he gets on Oscar's nerves.\n\nWithin only a week, the two men discover they are incompatible. Felix runs around the apartment cleaning, picking up after Oscar, and berating him for being so sloppy. Felix refuses to have any fun, spending most of his time thinking about Frances. While at a tavern, Oscar tells Felix about two English sisters he recently met who live in their building: Cecily and Gwendolyn Pigeon. Oscar telephones the girls and arranges a double date for the following evening.\n\nThe next night, Oscar tries to get uptight Felix to loosen up by leaving him alone with the two flirtatious sisters while he leaves the room to mix drinks. Instead, Felix talks incessantly about his family, breaks down weeping, and burns the meatloaf. Furious about Felix's ruining the date, Oscar resorts to giving Felix the silent treatment and torturing him by deliberately making the apartment as much of a mess as possible. Eventually, the tension explodes into an argument that results in Oscar demanding that Felix move out. Felix complies, but leaves Oscar feeling guilty for having abandoned his still-in-need friend.\n\nOscar assembles the poker group to help search the city for Felix. After searching for hours, they return to Oscar's apartment to play poker and soon discover that Felix has moved in with the Pigeon sisters with plans to get a place of his own. Felix and Oscar apologize to each other, realizing that a bit of each has rubbed off on the other, with each being a better person for it. Felix promises that next week he will attend their usual Friday night poker game. After Felix's final exit, the once slovenly Oscar tells his friends to watch their messes as the poker game continues.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Felix Ungar\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Oscar Madison\n* [[Herb Edelman]] as Murray\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Vinnie\n* [[David Sheiner]] as Roy\n* [[Larry Haines]] as Speed\n* [[Monica Evans]] as Cecily Pigeon\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as Gwendolyn Pigeon\n* [[Billie Bird]] as Chambermaid\n* [[Iris Adrian]] as Waitress\n* [[Angelique Pettyjohn]] as [[Go-go dancing|Go-Go dancer]]\n* [[Ted Beniades]] as Bartender\n* Bill Baldwin as Sports announcer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production and casting==\n''The Odd Couple'' was originally produced for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and the original cast starred [[Art Carney]] as Felix and [[Walter Matthau]] as Oscar. For the film version, Matthau reprised his role as Oscar, and Felix was portrayed by Jack Lemmon. At one point, [[Frank Sinatra]] (as Felix) and [[Jackie Gleason]] (as Oscar) were reportedly considered for the film version. [[Dick Van Dyke]] and [[Tony Randall]] were also among those considered for the role of Felix (Randall later  portrayed Felix in the 1970 TV series). Similarly,  [[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Jack Klugman]] (who replaced Matthau on Broadway as Oscar and would later play him in the 1970 TV series) were also considered to portray Oscar. Much of the original script from the play has been retained for the film, although the setting is expanded: instead of taking place entirely in Oscar's apartment, Simon also added some scenes that take place at various [[New York City]] locations (such as the scene at [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens, New York]]).\n\nOscar's poker playing cronies were Roy ([[David Sheiner]]), Vinnie ([[John Fiedler]]), Speed ([[Larry Haines]]) and Murray the Cop ([[Herbert Edelman]]). The film made its debut at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in 1968. It was a hit and earned Neil Simon a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay]]. The film was also nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy]] and Lemmon and Matthau were both nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].\n\nThe scene at [[Shea Stadium]], which also featured [[Heywood Hale Broun]], was filmed right before a real game between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] on June 27, 1967. [[Roberto Clemente]] was asked to hit into the [[triple play]] that Oscar misses, but he refused to do it and [[Bill Mazeroski]] took his place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centerfieldmaz.com/2014/06/remembering-mets-history-1967-odd.html |title=Centerfield maz: Remembering Mets History: (1967) the Odd Couple Movie Filming at Shea Stadium |access-date=2015-03-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402135304/http://www.centerfieldmaz.com/2014/06/remembering-mets-history-1967-odd.html |archive-date=2015-04-02 }}</ref>\n\nOne of the outdoor scenes in the film involved Felix shopping at [[Bohack]], a [[Maspeth, Queens]]-based supermarket chain ubiquitous in the [[New York City]] area during the mid-20th century.

The theme was used throughout the movie's [[sequel]], starring Lemmon and Matthau and released 30 years later, and also adapted for the 1970 TV series and used over the opening credits.
