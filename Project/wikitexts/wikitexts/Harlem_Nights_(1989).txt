The film co-stars [[Richard Pryor]], [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]], [[Danny Aiello]], [[Redd Foxx]] (in his last film appearance before his death in 1991), [[Della Reese]], and Murphy's older brother [[Charlie Murphy (actor)|Charlie]]. The film was released theatrically on November 17, 1989, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film tells the story of \"Sugar\" Ray and Vernest \"Quick\" Brown as a team running a nightclub in the late 1930s in [[Harlem]] while contending with gangsters and corrupt police officials.\n\n''Harlem Nights'' was Eddie Murphy's only directorial effort. He had always wanted to direct and star in a [[period piece]], as well as work with Pryor, whom he considered his greatest influence in [[stand-up comedy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Chris Rock, Bernie Mac, Eddie Murphy Call Pryor The Real King Of Comedy|date=12 December 2005|publisher=[[MTV News]]|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1517956/chris-rock-bernie-mac-eddie-murphy-call-pryor-the-real-king-of-comedy/|access-date=5 January 2015|archive-date=January 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103074825/http://www.mtv.com/news/1517956/chris-rock-bernie-mac-eddie-murphy-call-pryor-the-real-king-of-comedy/|url-status=live}}</ref> Reviews of the film were panned.

Nearly killed by an angry gambler who demands his money back (along with everyone elses), Ray is saved by seven-year-old errand boy Vernest Brown, who shoots the man with Ray's gun. After being told that his parents are dead, Ray decides to raise the boy as his own, nicknaming him \"Quick\" on account of his savvy. Twenty years later, Ray and Quick, now wealthy club owners, run a nightclub called \"Club Sugar Ray\", with gambling and dancing in the front, and a [[brothel]] in the back that's run by Ray's old friend Madame Vera.\n\nTommy Smalls, a black enforcer working for white gangster Bugsy Calhoune, and Miss Dominique LaRue, Calhoune's mistress, arrive to assess the club's profitability. Later, Calhoune sends corrupt detective Sgt. Phil Cantone to threaten Ray with having the club shut down unless Calhoune gets a cut. Ray decides to relocate rather than pay, but only after making sure his friends and workers are taken care of. An upcoming fight between boxer Michael Kirkpatrick and defending champion (and loyal Club Sugar Ray patron) Jack Jenkins is expected to bring in large sums of money in bets. Ray places a large bet on Kirkpatrick to make Calhoune think he paid Jenkins to throw the fight. Secretly, Ray instructs his men to intercept the bets Calhoune's friends and associates have bet on the match and steal them. A sexy call girl named Sunshine is used to distract Calhoune's bag man, Richie Vinto, ensuring the theft is carried out successfully.\n\nCalhoune has Tommy Smalls killed for theft before Quick is noticed near the scene by Tommy's brother, Reggie, who takes two men and corners him in an empty storefront. Quick shoots his attackers dead in self-defense and flees. Calhoune sends LaRue to seduce and kill Quick, but Quick anticipates this and kills LaRue with a gun hidden under his pillow.\n\nCalhoune has Club Sugar Ray burned down. In retaliation, Sunshine goes to Richie and asks him to help her with a pickup. Richie agrees to meet her on the way to collect some money for Calhoune, only to get in a car accident orchestrated by Ray's henchman Jimmy. Ray and Quick, claiming to be law officers, attempt to arrest Richie, telling him that the woman he's riding around with is a drug dealer. Quick manages to switch the bag holding Calhoune's money with the one Sunshine had placed in the car before two white policemen suddenly arrive to investigate the accident. Richie explains that he's on a run for Bugsy Calhoune, so they let him go.\n\nThe championship fight begins. With Calhoune's gang distracted, two of Ray's men seize the opportunity to blow up his \"Pitty Pat Club\". At the fight, Calhoune realizes it was not fixed as he thought, and then receives word that his Pitty Pat Club has been destroyed. Quick and Ray arrive at a closed bank with Cantone following them. It turns out to be a trap, and Ray's crew seal Cantone inside a bank vault, but promise to call the police precinct to let him out when they've made their clean getaway.\n\nRichie arrives to deliver Calhoune's money from earlier, but realizes that his bag has been switched with the one holding Sunshine's \"heroin\", which turns out to be sugar. An enraged Calhoune realizes that Ray is behind all of his recent setbacks. Vera, seemingly afraid for her safety, visits Calhoune and tells him where to find Ray and Quick. Calhoune and his remaining men go to Ray's hideout, where they trigger hidden explosives that kill all of them. Ray and Quick paid off the two white policemen from the accident and take one last look at Harlem, knowing they can never return and that there will never be another city like it. Despite this, the two, along with their associates Bennie and Vera, leave for an unknown location as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Vernest \"Quick\" Brown, Sugar Ray's adopted son who helps him run his club.\n* Desi Arnez Hines II as Young Vernest \"Quick\" Brown\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as \"Sugar\" Ray, a candy store owner who also operates an illegal after-hours nightclub.\n* [[Redd Foxx]] as Bennie \"Snake Eyes\" Wilson, a nearly-blind craps dealer and Vera's husband. \n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Sergeant Phil Cantone, a crooked cop who works for Bugsy Calhoun.\n* [[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as \"Bugsy\" Calhoun, the crime boss who owns most of the after-hours clubs in Harlem.\n* [[Della Reese]] as Vera Walker, Bennie's wife and the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] at Ray's club.\n* [[Berlinda Tolbert]] as Annie, Sugar Ray's wife.\n* [[Stan Shaw]] as Jack Jenkins, the current heavyweight boxing champion.\n* [[Jasmine Guy]] as Dominique La Rue, Bugsy Calhoun's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]].\n* [[Vic Polizos]] as Richie Vento, the [[Bagman|bag man]] who makes cash pickups for Bugsy Calhoun.\n* [[Lela Rochon]] as \"Sunshine\", a prostitute who works at Ray's club.\n* [[David Marciano]] as Tony, one of Bugsy Calhoun's goons.\n* [[Arsenio Hall]] as Reggie, Tommy Smalls' brother.\n* [[Thomas Mikal Ford]] as Tommy Smalls, the manager of one of Bugsy Calhoun's clubs.\n* [[Miguel A.

I just wanted to direct\u2014just to see if I can do it. And I found out that I can\u2019t, and I won\u2019t do it anymore. And the biggest thing is I didn\u2019t enjoy doing it. The problem with Harlem Nights wasn\u2019t the directing as much as it was the writing of it. It was just written fucked up, and that\u2019s because I threw it together real quick. And then it was disappointing because Richard wasn\u2019t the way I thought Richard was gonna be. I thought it would be like a collaborative thing where I would get to work with my idol, and then it would be like, \u201cThis is great.\u201d But Richard would come to the set, say his line and leave, it wasn't like a collaborative thing.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/featured/eddie-murphy-and-spike-lee-in-conversation-our-1990-cover-story/ |title=Eddie Murphy and Spike Lee in Conversation: Our 1990 Cover Story |date=November 19, 2020 |access-date=February 26, 2021 |archive-date=April 29, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210429155228/https://www.spin.com/featured/eddie-murphy-and-spike-lee-in-conversation-our-1990-cover-story/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nLater he said: \"That movie was a blur. It was Richard [Pryor], Robin Harris \u2013 all comedians. I remember Richard and Redd Foxx laughing offstage during the whole movie. The funniest shit was off camera, we\u2019re all just crying. Redd was a really funny dude, he would have the set screaming all the time. But afterwards it was like, Whoa, that's a lot of work. I was really young when I did it. I had one foot in the club, and one foot on the set, a lot of shit going on. It's amazing it came together.\" He also said he didn't know Pryor was sick at the time. \"He was sick with MS by then, but nobody knew it was going on.

A 22-year-old woman, who panicked and ran into traffic, was in critical condition two days later at the city's [[Providence Hospital (Southfield)|Providence Hospital]]; her name was withheld by police. Less than an hour after the shooting, police arrived at the theatre to find a 24-year-old Detroit man who had shot at an officer.  The gunman was wounded when the officer shot him back in the theatre parking lot. The incident caused the theatre chain to cancel showings of ''Harlem Nights''. One resident of the area, D'Shanna Watson, said:\n\n{{blockquote|There were so many people in the theater and there was so much going on, they stopped the movie three times.<ref name=googlenews>{{cite news|title= Shooting, violence mar 'Harlem Nights'|work= Ludington Daily News|date= Nov 20, 1989|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&dat=19891120&id=UMEwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xlUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3035,4562282|access-date= October 7, 2016|archive-date= September 15, 2012|archive-url= https://archive.today/20120915/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&dat=19891120&id=UMEwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xlUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3035,4562282|url-status= live}}</ref>}}\n\nLater that night, brawlers were ejected from a [[Sacramento]] theater showing ''Harlem Nights''. Their feud continued in a parking lot and ended with gunshots. Two 24-year-old men were seriously injured. An hour later, Marcel Thompson, 17, was fatally shot in a similar fight at a theater in [[Richmond, California]]. When police stopped the projection of ''Harlem Nights'' to find suspects, an hour-long riot erupted. In Boston, Mayor [[Raymond Flynn]] saw so many fistfights taking place in a crowd leaving ''Harlem Nights'' that he at first threatened to close the theater down but decided to tighten police security at the theatre. Flynn blamed the film for the riot, stating that it \"glorifies violence.\" However, Raymond Howard, a lieutenant of the Richmond police department, defended the film, saying, \"There's nothing wrong with the show.
