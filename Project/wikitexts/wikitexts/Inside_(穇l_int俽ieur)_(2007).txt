Written by Bustillo, it is the first feature film from either director. It concerns the attack and [[home invasion]] of a young pregnant woman (Paradis) by a mysterious stranger (Dalle) who seeks to [[fetal abduction|take her unborn baby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morehorror.com/Inside-Movie-Review|title=MoreHorror.com|website=www.morehorror.com}}</ref> The film received generally positive reviews from mainstream critics upon its release and was particularly well received among horror film critics, noting it for being a genuinely scary and brutally violent example of the [[New French Extremity#New wave of French horror|new wave of French horror]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Christmas Eve]], four months after expectant mother Sarah Scarangella survives a car crash that kills her husband, she makes final preparations for her delivery the following day. Her baby is overdue. Still reeling from her husband's death, Sarah has grown moody and depressed. She turns down her mother's request to stay with her for the night and has asked her employer Jean-Pierre to take her to the hospital for her eventual delivery.\n\nThat evening, a mysterious, unidentified woman arrives at Sarah's door, asking to use the telephone to call for help. Sarah lies that her husband is sleeping and she does not want to be disturbed, but the woman tells her that she knows that he is dead. When the visitor persists on coming in, Sarah, a professional photographer, attempts to take her photo through a window and telephones the police.  When they arrive, the woman has already vanished. The police assure Sarah that she will be fine, arranging to have a patrol car visit throughout the night.\n\nUpon developing her photos, Sarah recognizes the woman in the background of an earlier photo she had taken, indicating she was stalking Sarah. Sarah telephones Jean-Pierre, asking to have the photos enhanced. As she goes to bed, the woman arrives in the bedroom, awakening Sarah with scissors puncturing her pregnant belly. Sarah fights the visitor off (who slashes part of Sarah's face with the scissors) and locks herself in the bathroom, where the woman tries to gain entry. The woman makes clear that her intentions are to take Sarah's child for herself.\n\nJean-Pierre arrives, and not knowing what Sarah's mother looks like, takes the woman's word that she is the mother. Not long after her actual mother Louise arrives, arousing his suspicion. Louise heads upstairs to check on her daughter. Believing her to be the attacker, Sarah accidentally kills Louise by stabbing a needle into her neck. Jean-Pierre is later stabbed to death by the intruder. The police arrive to check up on her with a prisoner in tow. Not knowing what Sarah looks like, the police take the woman's word that she is Sarah and everything is fine. As they are about to leave, the police realize the woman who answered the door was not pregnant and return to the home. The first officer is stabbed to death with knitting needles as he attempts to arrest the attacker. The second is shot in the back of the head as he attempts to help Sarah. The attacker turns off the power as the third enters, waiting until they go to turn it back on before shooting the officer and stabbing his prisoner in the head.\n\nSarah confronts the woman, and both injure each other with various household appliances. Sarah manages to burn off half of the woman's face with an aerosol container and cigarette. The woman flees, and after being cornered by Sarah, reveals that she was the other driver in the car accident, which killed her unborn baby. She wants Sarah's baby as a replacement.\n\nBefore anything else can happen or be said, the two are interrupted by the revival of the third police officer; having been shot in close proximity by the woman with his [[flexible baton round|riot gun]], he survived the attack but is now disoriented and blinded. He confuses Sarah with her attacker and beats her in the stomach with his club, forcing her water to break. The woman comes to Sarah's aid and brutally kills the officer; but Sarah, now lying on the stairs, has begun to give birth and the baby is stuck.\n\nDesperate to save her child, Sarah pleads for the now reluctant woman to do what she originally intended. Acquiescing to the plea, the woman tearfully performs a [[Caesarean section]] on Sarah with scissors, saving the infant but killing Sarah in the process. The woman then sits in a chair and begins rocking the baby, who briefly cries, as she looks soulfully at Sarah who lies dead on the steps.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[B\u00e9atrice Dalle]] as La Femme\n* [[Alysson Paradis]] as Sarah Scarangella\n* [[Nathalie Roussel]] as Louise Scarangella, Sarah's mother\n* Fran\u00e7ois-R\u00e9gis Marchasson as Jean-Pierre Montalban\n* Jean-Baptiste Tabourin as Matthieu\n* Dominique Frot as The Nurse\n* Claude Lul\u00e9 as The Doctor\n* Hyam Zaytoun as Policewoman\n* [[Tahar Rahim]] as Policeman #1\n* Emmanuel Guez as Policeman #2\n* Ludovic Berthillot as BAC Policeman #1\n* Emmanuel Lanzi as BAC Policeman #2 \n* [[Nicolas Duvauchelle]] as BAC Policeman #3\n* Aymen Sa\u00efdi as Abdel\n\n== Production ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo, October 2011.png|right|thumb|Directors Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo]] \n[[Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo]] met each other through a mutual friend. After the meeting, Bustillo sent Maury a first draft of the script and Maury sent over some short films that he had worked on in the past. According to Maury, \"The first idea with the story was to change the sex of the killer. In horror movies it\u2019s always a guy chasing after young girls; it\u2019s one of the clich\u00e9s of the genre. So the first main idea was changing the identity of the bad guy. We wondered what was the motivation for a woman to hunt another woman?\" The film was given a budget of 1.7 million Euros.<ref name=Scifinow>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/5852/interview-julien-maury/|title=Interview: Julien Maury|date=12 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n''Inside'' received mostly positive reviews.

Sometimes it's as peaceful-looking as the [[Starchild (2001: A Space Odyssey)|star baby]] in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]''; at other times, after a scuffle or a blow, it's tossed about so violently that its survival is in question.
