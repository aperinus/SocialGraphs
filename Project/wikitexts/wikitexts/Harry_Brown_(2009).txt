The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Caine's performance but criticized the excessive violence.\n\n==Plot==\nElderly [[pensioner]] Harry Brown, a decorated [[Royal Marine]]  veteran of the [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland conflict]], lives on a London [[council estate]] infested with violent youth [[gang]] activity and illegal narcotics distribution. Harry spends most of his free time playing chess with his friend, Len Attwell, at a local pub owned by Sid Rourke. When the hospital phones about his wife Kath's imminent demise, Harry arrives too late as the pedestrian underpass shortcut is active gang territory. Kath is buried next to their thirteen-year-old daughter, Rachel, who died of pneumonia in 1973.\n\nLen confides to Harry that he is being terrorised by youths and shows him an old [[bayonet]] he now carries to defend himself; with the police unable to help, he plans to confront his harassers himself. The next day, Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock visit Harry and inform him that Len is dead. The police arrest Noel Winters, the leader of a drug-dealing gang, along with members Carl, Dean and Marky, but they are released due to insufficient evidence. After Len's funeral, an inebriated Harry is frozen when confronted by Dean at knife-point, for his wallet; almost instinctually, presumably due to his military training, Harry kills Dean with his own knife during a brief struggle. \nDI Frampton visits Harry the next morning, as Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges could be reduced to [[manslaughter]] or even [[self-defence]], incensing Harry.\n\nThat night Harry follows a drug dealer, Kenny, from a pub, to a  tenement, where they negotiate the purchase of a 9mm pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his mate, Stretch, growing [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and manipulating a young female heroin addict, to make [[pornography|pornographic films]]. Harry, mortified by their treatment of the comatose young woman, shoots the two dealers and sets their den ablaze,  fleeing with the girl, a bag of firearms and a large sum of cash in their military transport truck. He leaves the girl outside a hospital, and then tracks Marky to a secluded, wooded area, shooting the older drug boss who is sexually abusing him. Harry ties up Marky, coercing him into revealing mobile phone footage of Len's cold blooded murder. Harry then uses Marky to bait Noel and Carl in the underpass; a gunfight ensues, Carl and Marky are killed, but Noel flees. Harry pursues, but collapses from an [[emphysema]] attack. Harry is found and taken to hospital, where DI Frampton smells [[cordite]] gun residue on his overcoat. \n\nFrampton has deduced that Harry is behind all the recent shootings, but her boss\u2014Superintendent Childs\u2014is dismissive, convinced of an escalating gang war, and congratulates her on a new position.\nChilds leads a major police operation on the estate, which escalates into a riot. Meanwhile, Harry discharges himself from the hospital. Driving to the estate, Frampton and Hicock are involved in a car crash in which Hicock is severely injured. Harry appears and takes them into Sid's pub, where Frampton calls for backup and informs Harry that Sid is Noel's uncle, so shooting Noel is dubious at best. \n\nHarry discovers Sid hiding Noel in the basement, but has an emphysema fit, allowing Sid to disarm him and reveal himself as the gang's true leader. Sid suffocates the injured Hicock, and Noel begins to strangle Frampton. A weakened Harry draws a concealed ankle pistol and kills Noel; Sid then shoots Harry and prepares to finish him, as two red, (police-sniper) dots mark (Sid's) chest, unaware, Sid is baited by Harry to raise his gun.\n\nAt a press conference after the riot, Superintendent Childs announces that Frampton and Hicock are to be awarded medals, but denies evidence of a vigilante. Harry walks towards the now quiet and gang-free underpass.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col| colwidth=30em}}\n<!-- Main cast as they appear in ''Harry Brown''{{'}}s credits -->\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Harold \"Harry\" Brown\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Detective Inspector Alice Frampton\n* [[Charlie Creed Miles]] as Detective Sergeant Terence \"Terry\" Hicock\n* [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] as Leonard \"Len\" Attwell\n* [[Plan B (musician)|Ben Drew]] as Noel Winters\n* [[Sean Harris]] as Stretch\n* [[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]] as Marky\n* Jamie Downey as Carl\n* [[Lee Oakes]] as Dean Saunders\n* [[Joe Gilgun]] as Kenneth \"Kenny\" Soames\n* [[Liam Cunningham]] as Sidney \"Sid\" Rourke\n* [[Iain Glen]] as Superintendent Childs\n* [[Klariza Clayton]] as Sharon \"Shaz\" Thompson\n* Liz Daniels as Katherine \"Kath\" Brown\n* [[Orla O'Rourke]] as Nurse # 2\n* Chris Wilson as Daniel Ladlow Assistant Chief Constable\n* [[Ashley McGuire]] as Community WPC\n* [[Charles Ramsay (stuntman)|Charles Ramsay]] as Officer Charlie Ramsay\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot mainly in and around the abandoned [[Heygate Estate]] in [[Walworth]], [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Movies filmed in &#124; Enjoy the best film locations in with filmaps|url=http://www.filmaps.com/films/harry-brown-ref-1226/|access-date=2012-08-01|publisher=Filmaps.com}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/03/heygate-estate-south-london-hollywood \"South London's Heygate estate mourned by locals \u2013 and Hollywood\"], ''The Guardian'', 3 September 2010</ref> At the time of filming, it was due to be demolished,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Surtees|first=Joshua|date=2010-03-26|title=Gallery: The last days of Elephant and Castle's 1970s housing project|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/gallery/2010/mar/26/elephant-castle-housing-estate-heygate-redevelopment|access-date=2016-09-15|website=the Guardian}}</ref> which did not happen until early 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2014-02-13|title=Heygate Estate demolition enters final stage |newspaper=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-26180828|access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref> The subway scenes were shot at [[Marks Gate]], London.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sahin|first=Sukran|date=2 November 2010|title=A new dawn for blighted estate|url=http://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/crime-court/a-new-dawn-for-blighted-estate-1-715895|website=Barking and Dagenham Post|quote=Early last year, the subway was the scene setter for Harry Brown}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] 63% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 127 reviews, with an average score of 6/10.
