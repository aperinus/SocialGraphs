It is based on a play by [[Firesign Theatre]] members [[Phil Proctor]] and [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]]. The movie includes appearances by [[Jay Leno]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Tommy Lasorda]], and [[Chief Dan George]], with a musical performance by [[Elvis Costello]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the (then-near future) year 1998, the United States has run out of oil, and many Americans are living in their now-stationary cars and using nonpowered means of transportation such as jogging, riding bicycles and rollerskating. Many Americans wear [[tracksuit]]s. Paper money has become completely worthless, with all business transactions being conducted in gold; even a coin-operated elevator warns \"Gold Coins Only\". In search of leadership, Americans elect Chet Roosevelt as president of the United States. Roosevelt, a \"cosmically inspired\" former governor of California modeled on California governor [[Jerry Brown]] and wearing a three-piece tracksuit with [[waistcoat|vest]], proves to have little in common with [[Theodore Roosevelt]] or [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] other than his name. Roosevelt, an overly-optimistic man who quotes positive affirmation slogans, stages a number of highly publicized fund raising events, all of which fail. He becomes interested in having a relationship with [[Vietnamese American]] pop superstar Mouling Jackson. Real money comes in the form of loans from a [[cartel]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], led by billionaire Sam Birdwater, in control of [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] (styled as National Indian Knitting Enterprises; at the time of the film's release, they were still emerging as a company).\n\nThe federal government, now housed in \"The Western [[White House]]\" (a sub-leased condominium in Marina del Rey, California), finds itself facing national bankruptcy and in danger of being foreclosed and repossessed when Birdwater goes public on national television with the fact that he lent America billions of dollars and now wants his money back, the alternative being foreclosure and the country reverting to its original owners, stating \"Hey, I have to eat, too. Does that make me a bad guy?\"\n\nIn desperation, Roosevelt hires young television consultant Eric McMerkin to help produce a national raffle. Instead, they decide that the only way enough money can be raised to save America is instead to run a national telethon, and hire vapid TV celebrity Monty Rushmore to host it. However, Presidential adviser Vincent Vanderhoff is secretly plotting to have the telethon fail so that representatives of the United Hebrab Republic (formed by the merger of Israel and the Arab states) can purchase what is left of the country when Birdwater forecloses.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Ritter]] as President Chet Roosevelt\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Monty Rushmore\n* [[Peter Riegert]] as Eric McMerkin\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Vincent Vanderhoff\n* [[Chief Dan George]] as Sam Birdwater\n* [[Zane Buzby]] as Mouling Jackson\n* [[Nancy Morgan]] as Lucy Beth\n* [[Meat Loaf]] as Roy Budnitz\n* [[Elvis Costello]] as the Earl of Manchester\n* [[Tommy Lasorda]] as Jimmy Dunphy\n* [[Jay Leno]] as Larry Miller\n* [[Howard Hesseman]] as Kip Margolis\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Gold Girl\n* [[Allan Arbus]] as Moishe Weitzman\n* [[David Opatoshu]] as\tAbdul Muhammad\n* [[George Carlin]] as the Narrator\n\n==Production notes==\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack features \"[[It's a Beautiful Day (The Beach Boys song)|It's a Beautiful Day]]\" by [[The Beach Boys]], \"Crawling to the USA\" by [[Elvis Costello]] and \"Get a Move On\" by [[Eddie Money]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/elvis-costello-film-interview-1202637190/|title=With a 'Film Stars' Song in Contention, Rock Star Elvis Costello Reflects on Moonlighting for the Movies|last=Willman|first=Chris|date=2017-12-12|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/rockrollfilmency0000muir|url-access=registration|title=The Rock & Roll Film Encyclopedia|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|date=2007|page=[https://archive.org/details/rockrollfilmency0000muir/page/15 15]|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781557836939|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn a scene that features a song by Vietnamese singer Mouling Jackson ([[Zane Buzby]], better known as a TV director and philanthropist), a large poster of actor [[Burt Kwouk]] can be seen. The photo is actually taken from the 1968 film ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman]]'', in which Kwouk played Chinese leader Chairman Peng.\n\n===Cast===\n[[Dorothy Stratten]] appears, uncredited and in a brief non-speaking role, in a [[Playboy bunny]] style outfit during a scene where Meat Loaf's character donates blood. The [[Del Rubio triplets]] can be seen performing \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" behind several posing bodybuilders. [[John Carradine]] was to have played \"Uncle Sam\" in this movie, but his scenes did not make the final cut. Director [[Neal Israel]] has a cameo as a protesting rabbi holding a picket sign reading \"The President Is a Yutz\" (Yiddish for \"a stupid, clueless person\").\n\n===Playwrights===\nIn a scene where Eric McMerkin is reading a list of \"Government Approved\" performers, the names of \"Proctor & Bergman\" (the co-authors of the original play) can be seen fifth on the list, credited as \"Comics.\" Peter Bergman and Phil Proctor were members of the satirical comedy performance group Firesign Theatre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nightflight.com/americathon-the-prescient-1979-absurd-comedy-that-predicted-americas-unfunny-future/|title=\"Americathon\": The prescient 1979 absurd comedy that predicted America's unfunny future|website=nightflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nTo promote the movie, [[Ted Coombs]] roller-skated across the United States and back and gained a place in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]].''

At times, this movie is a savage affront to the intelligence. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. One of the things I hated about it was that it took the intelligence of its audience so much for granted, as if at a very low level. The audience is also at an intelligence of 102 apparently, the way this film behaves. The decibel level is turned way up. They're screaming. They're shouting. It's as if a joke will be funny if they shout it loudly enough. It's not funny. It's one of the low points of my entire movie-going career.}}</ref> Janet Maslin of ''The New York Times'' wrote \"The premise of ''Americathon'' is strong enough to sustain a 15-minute skit, but the movie has the ill fortune to drag on for an hour and a half.\"<ref>Maslin, Janet (August 10, 1979).
