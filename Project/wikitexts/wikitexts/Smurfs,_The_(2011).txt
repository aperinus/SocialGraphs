It was directed by [[Raja Gosnell]] and stars [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Jayma Mays]], [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]], and [[Hank Azaria]], with the voices of [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Katy Perry]], [[George Lopez]], [[Anton Yelchin]], [[Fred Armisen]], and [[Alan Cumming]]. It is the first [[Sony Pictures Animation]] film to blend computer animation with live-action photography, and the first of two [[The Smurfs (film series)|live-action animated ''Smurfs'' feature films]].<ref name=\"info\" /> \n\nAfter five years of negotiations, [[Jordan Kerner]] bought the rights in 2002, and the film entered development with [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]], until [[Columbia Pictures]] and Sony Pictures Animation obtained the film rights in 2008. Filming began in March 2010 in New York City.\n\n''The Smurfs'' was released by Columbia Pictures on July 29, 2011. While the film received negative reviews from critics, the film grossed $564 million worldwide against a $110 million budget, making it the [[2011 in film|ninth highest-grossing film of 2011]] and Sony Pictures Animation's most commercially successful film to date. A sequel, titled ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'', was released on July 31, 2013.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films are recommended to be kept between 400 to 700 words. -->\n{{Long plot|date=September 2022}}\nAs the [[Smurfs]] prepare for the [[Blue Moon]] Festival, [[Papa Smurf]] sees in his cauldron a vision of [[List of The Smurfs characters|Clumsy Smurf]] reaching for a dragon wand and the Smurfs' longtime enemy, evil wizard [[Gargamel]], capturing him. Not wanting this vision to come true, Papa disallows Clumsy to pick smurfroot, since the smurfroot fields lead to Gargamel's castle. Clumsy disobeys Papa and ends up unintentionally leading Gargamel and his pet cat Azrael to the village. The Smurfs all flee for their lives while Clumsy unknowingly runs towards the Forbidden Falls, with Papa, [[Smurfette]], [[Grouchy Smurf|Grouchy]], [[Brainy Smurf|Brainy]] and [[Gutsy Smurf|Gutsy]] running after him. They find him at the edge of a cliff, and while trying to help him up, they are sucked into a gigantic vortex that spirits them to 2011 [[New York City]]. To make matters worse, Gargamel and Azrael follow them through the vortex. The Smurfs end up in the apartment of Patrick and Grace Winslow, a married couple who are expecting their first child, and their [[Basset Hound]] Elway. After introducing themselves and explaining their situation, the Winslows befriend them and allow them to stay in their apartment. The next day, needing to find a [[telescope|\"stargazer\"]], the Smurfs follow Patrick to his workplace at Anjelou Cosmetics, misunderstanding the previous explanation of his job as fortune-telling, where he calls Grace to pick them up.\n\nMeanwhile, having extracted Smurf essence from a lock of Smurfette's hair, Gargamel also arrives at Anjelou Cosmetics and ends up being treated favorably by Patrick's boss Odile when he uses most of his acquired magic on her elderly mother by restoring her youth and attractiveness. Gargamel resumes his search upon recognizing Patrick and following him into [[FAO Schwarz]], but gets arrested after stealing another man's [[leaf blower]] and for causing chaos in the store with some customers while trying to catch the Smurfs. Gargamel manages to break out of prison with the aid of flies, since he encountered a moth and told it to bring him eagles to help him escape. By that time, Papa manages to calculate the night he and the others can get home. But first, he must figure out the spell to do so. Patrick tells them that there is an old bookstore in the city near Anjelou Cosmetics that may contain the spell Papa needs. Meanwhile, Patrick bonds with the Smurfs after sending what he believed to be his finished advertisement to be published. The next day, Patrick learns that Clumsy accidentally attached Patrick's first attempt at the advertisement before it was sent, a blue-moon-themed image that he couldn't bring himself to submit. Angered, Patrick berates the Smurfs and walks out on them and Grace to save his job, believing that he will get fired if he doesn't fix Clumsy's mistake.\n\nForced to search on their own, the Smurfs except for Clumsy find the store and find the book ''L\u2019Histoire des Schtroumpfs'' by researcher [[Peyo]], containing the spell to turn the moon blue. Having learned of their whereabouts from a homeless man, Gargamel sneaks into the bookstore and finds a dragon wand, transferring his magic into it as he uses it to capture Papa as he sends the others to safety. Though the Smurfs promise Papa that they won't try to save him and return home, Clumsy and Patrick, having seen the error of their actions after Grace gave him a sonogram picture of their baby, convince them to plan a rescue. At [[Belvedere Castle]], after increasing the dragon wand's power with Smurf essence extracted from bits of Papa's beard, Gargamel finds himself facing all the Smurfs, summoned to New York by Brainy after he reopened the vortex by conjuring the blue moon. As the Smurf army battles Gargamel, Smurfette defeats Azrael and saves Papa before they join the fray. Though Gargamel attempts to break the Smurfs by killing Papa, Patrick saves him while Gutsy knocks the dragon wand out of Gargamel's hand, but he drops it. Clumsy tries to catch it, and to Papa's surprise, is successful and sends Gargamel flying into trash bags and being hit by a [[Motor Coach Industries|MCI J4500 bus]] with the advertisement \"Blue Moon\" on it. The Smurfs cheer for Clumsy and Papa expresses how proud he is of him. Soon after, the Smurfs take their leave as Patrick receives a call from Odile that he still has his job because he finally gave her what she wants after she noticed the blue moon that Brainy created. Later, Patrick and Grace have a baby boy, whom they name Blue to honor the Smurfs, who rebuild their village in the style of New York.\n\nIn the aftermath, Gargamel wakes up and learns that he is still in the present and he looks at the audience before breaking the [[fourth wall]] and asking them \"What are you looking at?\" and blasts them with his wand.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Live-action actors===\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as [[Gargamel]], the arch-nemesis of the Smurfs who plots to use the Smurfs as part of a spell that would turn lead into gold. As opposed to the television show where Gargamel's goal is to use the Smurfs as the key ingredient in an alchemical formula to create the gold or eat them or destroy them, in the film he wants to capture them to serve as charms, \"whose mystical essence will make his inept magic more powerful \u2014 and dangerous\".<ref name=\"usatoday\" /> To look the part of Gargamel, Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, [[Malocclusion|buck teeth]], eyebrows, and a wig (to make the process easier, he shaved his head). The initial make-up test took three hours, but by mid-production, the process took 90 minutes to complete. Azaria was transformed over 50 times and spent approximately 130 hours in the make-up chair.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as Patrick Winslow, the new VP of marketing at Anjelou Cosmetics and Grace's husband.\n* [[Jayma Mays]] as Grace Winslow, Patrick's wife. \n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as Odile Anjelou, the leader of Anjelou Cosmetics who is Patrick's boss.\n* [[Tim Gunn]] as Henri, Odile's assistant of Anjelou Cosmetics.\n\n[[Joan Rivers]], [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]], [[Tom Colicchio]], [[Olivia Palermo]], and [[Michael Musto]] make cameos in the film at a fictional Anjelou cosmetics product launch.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\n===Voice actors===\n{{Further|List of The Smurfs characters}}\n* [[Jonathan Winters]] as [[Papa Smurf]], the leader of the Smurfs. Winters previously provided the voice of Grandpa Smurf in the [[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|1980s cartoon series]]. He and Frank Welker are the only original cast members from the TV series who returned for the film.\n* [[Katy Perry]] as [[Smurfette]], the female of the Smurfs. About gaining the voice role, Perry said: \"They had done a blind test where they took certain voices from previous interviews and matched them with the character. They liked my voice without even knowing who it was, and when they found out it was me, they thought that would work out. My personality was just a plus!\"<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n* [[Anton Yelchin]] as [[Clumsy Smurf]], the dimwitted but friendly smurf. Yelchin commented on his character's personality change from the cartoons series saying, \"I was familiar with Clumsy from the TV series, where he had that Southern twang. I went back and watched that, and then Raja, Jordan and I talked about it. We decided to make Clumsy a little simpler, a little sweeter. His voice is pitched higher than my normal speaking voice \u2013 it's full of joy, optimism, and enthusiasm for life. Clumsy isn't trying to mess anything up for anybody \u2014 he's just clumsy, and actually, he's tired of being clumsy\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n* [[Fred Armisen]] as [[Brainy Smurf]], the smartest Smurf, below Papa Smurf. [[Quentin Tarantino]] was up to voice him, but dropped out.\n* [[Alan Cumming]] as [[Gutsy Smurf]], one of three Smurfs created specifically for the film and who is Scottish, wears a [[kilt]] and has sideburns. The character is also described as the \"action-hero\" of the film.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n* [[George Lopez]] as [[Grouchy Smurf]], a smurf who is always grouchy. To prepare for his role of being \"grouchy\", Lopez did not drink coffee, made sure he had bad breath and picked the busiest time to get to the studio.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n* [[Jeff Foxworthy]] as [[Handy Smurf]], a hard-working smurf.\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as [[Jokey Smurf]], a smurf who plays pranks on others.\n* [[Gary Basaraba]] as [[Hefty Smurf]], a strong smurf with a tattoo of a heart. \n* [[John Oliver]] as [[Vanity Smurf]], a smurf who is obsessed with his looks.\n* [[Kenan Thompson]] as [[Greedy Smurf]], a smurf who loves smurfberries.\n* [[B. J. Novak]] as [[Baker Smurf]], a smurf who loves to bake.\n* Joel McCrary as [[Farmer Smurf]], a smurf who is a farmer.\n* [[Wolfgang Puck]] as Chef Smurf, a smurf who loves to cook.\n* [[John Kassir]] as Crazy Smurf, the alarm for the village and the second Smurf created specifically for the film\n* [[Tom Kane]] as Narrator Smurf, a smurf with a deep narrator voice and the third Smurf created specifically for the film.\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[List of The Smurfs characters#Antagonists|Azrael]], Gargamel's cat.<ref name=\"Zap2itCast\">{{cite web|url=http://movies.zap2it.com/movies/the-smurfs/8554187|title=The Smurfs|work=[[Zap2it]]|access-date=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Welker provided the voice of Hefty Smurf and other characters in the 1980s cartoon series. Four orange [[tabby cat]]s played the role of Azrael with some scenes being created with [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] by [[Tippett Studio]]. Animal trainer Larry Madrid had a \"rare [[Burmese (cat)|Burma cat]]\" that was used to educe snarls from the other cats since they did not like him.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn 1997, producer [[Jordan Kerner]] sent the first \"of a series of letters\" to ''[[The Smurfs]]''{{'}} licensing agent Lafig Belgium expressing interest in making a feature film. It was not until 2002 after a draft of Kerner's film adaptation of ''[[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'' was read by [[Peyo]]'s heirs, that they accepted Kerner's offer. Peyo's daughter V\u00e9ronique Culliford and family had wanted to make a Smurfs film for years and said that Kerner was the first person to pitch a film that shared their \"vision and enthusiasm\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Kerner soon began developing the 3-D CGI feature film with [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]].<ref name=\"rights1\" /><ref name=\"rights2\" /> In 2006, Kerner said the film was planned to be a trilogy and would explain more of [[Gargamel]]'s backstory. He stated, \"We'll learn [more] about Gargamel and Smurf Soup and how all that began and what really goes on in that castle. What his backstory really was. There's an all-powerful wizard... there's all sorts of things that get revealed as we go along\".<ref name=\"rights1\" /> Early animation footage was leaked on the internet in early 2008.<ref name=\"first look\" /> The filmmakers were allowed to create three new Smurfs for the film \u2013 Narrator, Crazy, and Gutsy.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nIn June 2008, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Sony Pictures Animation]] obtained the film rights from Lafig Belgium.<ref name=\"film rights\" /> Kerner said the current project started with Sony during a conversation with the chairman-CEO [[Michael Lynton]], who grew up watching ''The Smurfs'' in the Netherlands. Kerner explained, \"He relished them as I do and suggested that it should be a live-action/CG film. [[Amy Pascal]] felt equally that there was potentially a series of films in the making\".<ref name=\"rights2\" /> ''[[Shrek 2]]'' writers, J. David Stern and [[David N. Weiss]] wrote the screenplay along with ''[[Zookeeper (film)|Zookeeper]]'' writers Jay Scherick and David Ronn; Stem and Weiss also wrote the story. [[Raja Gosnell]] directed.<ref name=\"rights2\" /><ref name=\"director\" /> [[Quentin Tarantino]] was in talks to play Brainy Smurf, however, these did not pan out.<ref name=\"Quentin\" />\n\n===Filming and animation===\nOn a budget of $110 million,<ref name=\"LABox\">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/07/cowboys-aliens-smurfs-crazy-stupid-love.html|title=Movie Projector: 'Cowboys & Aliens' will trample 'Smurfs'|last=Kaufman|first=Amy|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 28, 2011|access-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref> [[principal photography]] began in New York City on March 26, 2010.<ref name=\"filming\" /> In May, scenes were filmed in [[Manhattan]]'s [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"nypost1\" /> That month, scenes were shot all night for five nights in a row at [[F.A.O. Schwartz]] toy store.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Production was temporarily halted after a worker fell 30 feet from a set at the toy store on [[Fifth Avenue]] and 58th Street; he later recovered in a hospital.<ref name=\"nypost2\" /> Other locations used for filming were [[Belvedere Castle]], the [[Russian Tea Room]], [[Rockefeller Center]], and Brooklyn's [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]].<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A two-thirds-scale replica of the Belvedere Castle was built with wooden grates as floors (to create additional contrast). Gargamel's dungeon under the Belvedere Castle, which included the \"Smurfalator\", was built on a soundstage. It took three months to build because some parts were hard to come by. Production eventually found the rare parts at garage sales, flea markets, on [[eBay]] and [[Craigslist]].<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nIn order to help the Smurfs' animators during post-production, [[cinematographer]] [[Phil Meheux]] and his team would light up a scene where the Smurfs would be digitally added using 7 and one half-inch tall models to stand in during set-up and rehearsals. He explained, \"We can then position the light so that it falls right. The actors know where the Smurf will be when it is animated later, so their eyelines will match. Then we can take out the model and shoot the scene, and they look quite real, fitting the real backing that we're giving them. It looks like they're part of the surroundings\".<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Also during the process the Imageworks visual effects team used a new camera system to precisely record the on-set lighting, so it could be applied later in the computer.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> When time came to film a scene that would include actors and Smurfs, each Smurf was represented by a different colored dot and the\nactors had to remember which dot was which Smurf. ''The Smurfs'' characters were created during [[post-production]] by 268 [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] employees who spent around 358,000 hours animating. Character designer Allen Battino, a long time Kerner collaborator, was brought in to redesign the characters for CGI.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\n==Release==\n[[File:J\u00fazcar M\u00e1laga Andalusia Spain smurf town.jpg|thumb|right|For the world premiere of ''The Smurfs'', [[J\u00fazcar]] residents painted their entire village in blue]]\nThe film had its worldwide premiere on June 16, 2011, in [[J\u00fazcar]], a small village in Spain.

He called the slapstick \"very small-kid friendly\" and considered the adult-friendly jokes \"pretty mild stuff\". He closed his review saying, \"Yeah, the Smurfs are still sickeningly sweet and upbeat. But if you've got kids, it's not nearly as torturous to sit through as you might have feared\".<ref name=\"Orlando\"/> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the film as \"adorable and annoying, patently unnecessary yet kinda sweet\" and calling it \"a calculated commercial enterprise with little soul but an appreciable amount of heart\". He said, \"The script does wink knowingly in the direction of attentive adults\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\"/>\n\n''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''{{'}}s Peter Hartlaub gave the film a mixed review. He said ''The Smurfs'' is a \"rare movie where the worst parts are in the promos\". He called Harris' performance an \"honest effort in a thankless role\" but said that Azaria as Gargamel \"Hidden under prosthetics, [Hank Azaria] compensates for his lack of good lines and repulsive makeup by overacting\". He closed his review saying, \"Harris, mostly acting against Marshmallow Peep-sized animated creations, is convincing and likable throughout. No doubt he will poke fun at his participation in this film the next time he's hosting an awards show, but don't be fooled. It takes a good actor to save a bad movie\".<ref name=\"SanFranciscoReview\"/> Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' criticized the CGI used on the cat, the use of 3D by calling it \"needless\" and Lopez's voice as Grouchy. He called the Smurf rap the worst part of the film. However, Burr echoed Harlaub's praise for Harris' performance by saying, \"Harris manages to class up whatever he touches, even if the sight of him repeatedly hitting himself with an umbrella probably won't go on the career highlight reel\". About Azaria, he said, \"[Azaria] gets to put on a baldy wig and fake buck-teeth and overact as broadly as he can. A little of this goes a long way unless you're 6 years old, which is the point\". He also added that Sofia Vergara \"shares the screenplay's confusion as to what, exactly, she's doing here\".<ref name=\"BostonReview\"/>\n\n''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Scott Bowles enjoyed Azaria's performance calling him \"the human standout\" and saying \"He and his distrusting cat, Azrael, steal scenes\". He also called Jonathan Winters \"wonderful\" as Papa Smurf.<ref name=\"USA Today\"/> Neil Genzlinger of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said Azaria was \"quite funny\". About the film's content, he said \"Those grown-up winks, along with an array of New York locations, make ''The Smurfs'' a surprisingly tolerable film for adults. As for their children, well, who knows with kids? But at least the writers have cleverly built in enough Smurfology that today's youngsters will be able to get the basics of the blue universe\".<ref name=\"NYTimesReview\"/> Betsy Sharkey from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the film a negative review saying, \"Director Raja Gosnell starts with the innocence but then loses his way in trying to pull off the hipster spin the script by J. David Stern, David N. Weiss, Jay Scherick and David Ronn is shooting for.\" and \"There are many good actors wasted as voices\u2014Alan Cumming, Fred Armisen and Winters among them\u2014and in the flesh, though the greatest disservice is to Azaria\".<ref name=\"LAReview\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n'''[[NewNowNext Awards]]'''\n* Next Must See Movie (Nominated)\n\n'''[[38th People's Choice Awards]]'''\n* Favorite Animated Movie Voice: [[Katy Perry]] (Nominated)\n\n'''[[2012 Kids' Choice Awards]]'''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schillaci|first1=Sophie|title=Taylor Swift, Tim Tebow, Johnny Depp Land Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award Noms|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nickelodeon-kids-choice-awards-taylor-swift-tim-tebow-292050|access-date=July 19, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Rice|first1=Lynette|title='Kids Choice Awards': And the winners are...|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2012/03/31/kids-choice-awards-and-the-winners-are|access-date=July 19, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 31, 2012}}</ref>\n* Favorite Movie (Nominated)\n* Favorite Movie Actress: [[Sofia Vergara]] (Nominated)\n* Favorite Voice in an Animated Film: [[Katy Perry]] (Won)\n\n==Video games==\n* ''[[The Smurfs (video game)|The Smurfs]]'', a [[Nintendo DS]] [[video game]] was released on July 19, 2011.\n* ''[[The Smurfs Dance Party]]'', a [[Wii]] video game was released on July 19, 2011.\n\n==Sequels==\n===''The Smurfs 2''===\n{{Main|The Smurfs 2}}\nA sequel, titled ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'', was released on July 31, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|title=New Release Dates for THE SMURFS 2, THE SAMARITAN and the Farrelly/Wessler Star-Packed Comedy Anthology|url=https://collider.com/smurfs-2-release-date-samaritan-farrelly-wessler-comedy/155939/|access-date=March 30, 2012|newspaper=Collider.com|date=March 29, 2012}}</ref> Director Raja Gosnell and producer Jordan Kerner returned, along with all the main cast.
