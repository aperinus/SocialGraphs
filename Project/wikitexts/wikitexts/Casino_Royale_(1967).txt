It is loosely based on the 1953 novel of [[Casino Royale (novel)|the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]], the first novel to feature the character [[James Bond]]. The film stars [[David Niven]] as the \"original\" Bond, [[James Bond filmography|Sir James Bond 007]]. Forced out of retirement to investigate the deaths and disappearances of international spies, he soon battles the mysterious Dr. Noah and [[SMERSH]]. The film's tagline: \"Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond!\" refers to Bond's ruse to mislead SMERSH in which six other agents are pretending to be \"James Bond\", namely, [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] master Evelyn Tremble ([[Peter Sellers]]); millionaire spy [[Vesper Lynd]] ([[Ursula Andress]]); Bond's secretary [[Miss Moneypenny]] ([[Barbara Bouchet]]); Bond's daughter with [[Mata Hari]], Mata Bond ([[Joanna Pettet]]); and British agents Coop ([[Terence Cooper]]) and The Detainer ([[Daliah Lavi]]).\n\n[[Charles K. Feldman]], the producer, had acquired the film rights in 1960 and had attempted to get ''Casino Royale'' made as an [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|Bond film]]; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], failed to come to terms. Believing that he could not compete with the Eon series, Feldman resolved to produce the film as a satire. The budget escalated as various directors and writers became involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project.\n\n''Casino Royale'' was released on 13 April 1967, two months prior to Eon's fifth Bond movie, ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''. The film was a financial success, grossing over $41.7 million worldwide, and  [[Burt Bacharach]]'s musical score was praised, earning him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for the song \"[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\". Critical reaction to ''Casino Royale'', however, was generally negative, with many reviewers regarding it as a baffling, disorganised affair. Since 1999, the film's rights have been held by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures]], distributors of the Bond films by Eon Productions.\n\n==Plot==\nSir James Bond 007, a legendary British [[spy]] who retired from the secret service 20 years previously, is visited by the head of British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[M (James Bond)|M]]; [[CIA]] representative Ransome; [[KGB]] representative Smernov; and [[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]] representative Le Grand. All implore Bond to come out of retirement to deal with [[SMERSH]], who have been eliminating agents; Bond spurns all their pleas. When Bond continues to stand firm, his mansion is destroyed by a mortar attack at the orders of M (who is, however, killed in the explosion).\n\nBond travels to Scotland to return M's remains to his grieving widow, Lady Fiona McTarry.  However, the real Lady Fiona has been replaced by SMERSH's Agent Mimi.  The rest of the household have been likewise replaced, with SMERSH's aim to discredit Bond by destroying his \"celibate image\". Attempts by a bevy of beauties to seduce Bond fail, but Mimi/Lady Fiona becomes so impressed with Bond that she changes loyalties and helps Bond to foil the plot against him.  On his way back to London, Bond survives another attempt on his life.\n\nBond is promoted to the head of MI6. He learns that many British agents around the world have been eliminated by enemy spies because of their inability to resist sex. Bond is also told that the \"sex maniac\" who was given the name of \"James Bond\" when the original Bond retired has gone to work in television. He then orders that all remaining MI6 agents will be named \"James Bond 007\", to confuse SMERSH. He also creates a rigorous programme to train male agents to ignore the charms of women. Moneypenny recruits Coop, a karate expert who begins training to resist seductive women: he also meets an exotic agent known as the Detainer.\n\nBond then hires Vesper Lynd, a retired agent turned millionaire, to recruit [[baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] expert Evelyn Tremble, whom he intends to use to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft before he is executed.\n\nFollowing up a clue from agent Mimi, Bond persuades his estranged daughter Mata Bond to travel to [[West Berlin]] to infiltrate International Mothers' Help, an [[au pair]] service that is a cover for a SMERSH training center. Mata uncovers a plan to sell compromising photographs of military leaders from the US, USSR, China and Great Britain at an \"art auction\", another scheme Le Chiffre hopes to use to raise money. Mata destroys the photos. Le Chiffre's only remaining option is to raise the money by playing baccarat.\n\nTremble arrives at the Casino Royale accompanied by Lynd, who foils an attempt to disable him by seductive SMERSH agent Miss Goodthighs. Later that night, Tremble observes Le Chiffre playing at the casino and realises that he is using infrared sunglasses to cheat. Lynd steals the sunglasses, allowing Evelyn to eventually beat Le Chiffre in a game of baccarat. Lynd is apparently abducted outside the casino, and Tremble is also kidnapped while pursuing her. Le Chiffre, desperate for the winning cheque, [[hallucinogenic]]ally tortures Tremble. Lynd rescues Tremble, only to subsequently kill him. Meanwhile, SMERSH agents raid Le Chiffre's base and kill him.\n\nIn London, Mata is kidnapped by SMERSH in a giant [[flying saucer]], and Sir James and Moneypenny travel to Casino Royale to rescue her. They discover that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah, secretly Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, a former MI6 agent who defected to SMERSH to spite his famous uncle. Jimmy reveals that he plans to use [[biological warfare]] to make all women beautiful and kill all men over {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|adj=on}} tall, leaving him as the \"big man\" who gets all the girls. Jimmy has already captured The Detainer, and he tries to persuade her to be his partner; she agrees, but only to dupe him into swallowing one of his atomic time pills, turning him into a walking atomic bomb.\n\nSir James, Moneypenny, Mata and Coop manage to escape from their cell and fight their way back to the casino director's office where Sir James establishes Lynd is a double agent. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues. American and French support arrive, but just add to the chaos. Jimmy counts down a series of hiccups, each bringing him closer to doom. Eventually the atomic pill explodes, destroying Casino Royale with everyone inside. Sir James and all of his agents then appear in heaven, and Jimmy Bond is shown descending to hell.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Niven]] as [[James Bond (literary character)|Sir James Bond]]: A legendary British secret agent forced out of retirement to fight SMERSH.\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Evelyn Tremble / James Bond: A [[baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] master recruited by Vesper Lynd to challenge [[Le Chiffre]] at ''Casino Royale''.\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Vesper Lynd]] / James Bond: A retired British secret agent forced back into service in exchange for writing off her tax arrears.\n* [[Joanna Pettet]] as Mata Bond / James Bond: Bond's daughter, born of his love affair with [[Mata Hari]].\n* [[Daliah Lavi]] as The Detainer / James Bond: A British secret agent who successfully poisons Dr. Noah with his own atomic pill.\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Dr Noah / Jimmy Bond: Bond's nephew and head of SMERSH under his Dr Noah alias.

Broccoli]], who had held an interest in adapting James Bond for some years, offered to purchase the ''Casino Royale'' rights from Feldman, but he declined.{{sfn|Broccoli|Zec|1998|p=199}} Feldman and his friend, the director [[Howard Hawks]], had an interest in adapting ''Casino Royale'' and considered [[Leigh Brackett]] as a writer and [[Cary Grant]] as James Bond. They eventually decided not to proceed after they saw ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), the first Bond adaptation made by Broccoli and his partner [[Harry Saltzman]] through their company [[Eon Productions]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood|pages=595, 629|author=McCarthy, Todd|publisher=Grove Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-802-19640-8}}</ref>\n\nBy 1964, with Feldman having invested nearly $550,000 of his own money into pre-production of ''Casino Royale'', he decided to try a deal with Eon Productions and [[United Artists]]. The attempt at a co-production eventually fell through as Feldman frequently argued with Broccoli and Saltzman, especially regarding the profit divisions and when the ''Casino Royale'' adaptation would start production. Feldman eventually decided to offer his project to [[Columbia Pictures]] through a script written by [[Ben Hecht]], and the studio accepted. Given Eon's series led to spy films being in vogue at the time, Feldman opted to make his film a spoof of the Bond series instead of a straightforward adaptation.<ref name= Missing/>\n\n====Screenplay====\n[[Ben Hecht]]'s contribution to the project, if not the final result, was in fact substantial and he wrote several complete drafts. In May 1966, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that Hecht had \"three bashes\" at completing a script, while his papers contained material from four surviving screenplays by Hecht.<ref name=\"TimeMagazine\">{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,901872,00.html |title=On Location: Little Cleopatra |magazine=Time |date=6 May 1966 |access-date=8 January 2022}}</ref> His treatments were almost entirely \"straight\" adaptations, far closer to the original source novel than the spoof which the final production became. A draft from 1957 discovered in Hecht's papers \u2014 but which does not identify the screenwriter \u2014 is a direct adaptation of the novel, albeit with the Bond character absent, instead being replaced by a poker-playing American gangster.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nLater drafts see [[vice]] made central to the plot, with the Le Chiffre character becoming head of a network of brothels (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then blackmailed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through [[Hamburg]]'s red light district that results in Bond escaping disguised as a female [[mud wrestling|mud wrestler]]. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel [[Pimp|madam]] and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to be crushed in the back of a garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nVirtually nothing from Hecht's scripts was ever filmed, although a draft dated to February 1964 has a line of dialogue containing the idea of MI6 having given multiple agents the name of James Bond after Bond has died to confuse the other side.<ref name=\"Duns2011\" /> Hecht died from a heart attack in April 1964, two days after finishing his script and before he was able to present it to Feldman. [[Joseph Heller]] (and his friend [[George Mandel]]) worked on the project for a few weeks in early 1965 submitting  more than 100 pages after Feldman offered Heller $150,000. Heller later wrote about this episode in ''How I found James Bond, lost my self-respect and almost made $150,000 in my spare time''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Duns|first=Jeremy|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/catch-007-how-joseph-heller-almost-wrote-casino-royale-wc5hnv0h9|title=Catch 007: how Joseph Heller almost wrote Casino Royale|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2020|access-date=20 April 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nThe script was then completely re-written by [[Billy Wilder]],<ref name=\"TimeMagazine\" /> and by the time the film reached production, only the idea that the name James Bond should be given to a number of other agents remained. This key [[plot device]] in the finished film, in the case of Hecht's version, occurs after the demise of the original James Bond (an event which happened prior to the beginning of his story) which, as Hecht's M puts it, \"not only perpetuates his memory, but confuses the opposition.\"<ref name=\"Duns2011\" />\n\nIn addition to the credited writers, [[Woody Allen]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Val Guest]], [[Ben Hecht]], [[Joseph Heller]], [[Terry Southern]] and Wilder are all believed to have contributed to the screenplay to varying degrees.

Screenwriter [[Wolf Mankowitz]] declared that Sellers felt intimidated by Welles to the extent that, except for a couple of shots, neither was in the studio simultaneously. Other versions of the legend depict the drama stemming from Sellers being slighted, in favour of Welles, by [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] (whom Sellers knew) during her visit to the set. Welles also insisted on performing magic tricks as Le Chiffre, and the director obliged. Director Guest wrote that Welles did not think much of Sellers, and had refused to work with \"that amateur\". Director McGrath, a personal friend of Sellers, was punched by the actor when he complained about Sellers' on-set behaviour.<ref>Sikov, Ed. ''Mr Strangelove: A Biography of Peter Sellers''. Pan Macmillan, 2011. {{ISBN|1447207149}}. pp. 310\u20133</ref>\n\nSome Sellers biographies suggest that he took the role of Bond to heart, and was annoyed at the decision to make ''Casino Royale'' a comedy, as he wanted to play Bond straight. This is illustrated in somewhat fictionalised form in the film ''[[The Life and Death of Peter Sellers]]'', based on the biography by [[Roger Lewis]], who has claimed that Sellers kept re-writing and improvising scenes to make them play seriously. This story is in agreement with the observation that the only parts of the film close to the book are the ones featuring Sellers and Welles.<ref name=Sellers>Lewis, Roger. ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'', Applause Books, 2000, {{ISBN|1-55783-248-X}}</ref> In the end, Sellers's involvement with the film was cut abruptly short.<ref name=\"TCM\" />\n\n====Cameo appearances====\n[[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and [[George Raft]] received [[opening credits|major billing]], even though both only appear briefly. Both appear during the climactic brawl at the end, Raft flipping his trademark coin and promptly shooting himself dead with a backward-firing pistol, while Belmondo appears wearing a fake moustache as the [[French Foreign Legion]] officer who requires an English phrase book to translate ''\"[[Shit|merde]]!\"'' into \"ooch!\" during his fistfight.<ref name=Playboy/> Raft's coin flip, which originally appeared in ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), had been spoofed by Raft a few years earlier in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959).<ref>{{cite book|title=Gangster Films|author=Smith, Jim|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2004|isbn=0753508389|page=34}}</ref>\n\nAt the Intercon science fiction convention held in [[Slough]] in 1978, [[David Prowse]] commented on his part, apparently his big-screen debut. He claimed that he was originally asked to play \"Super Pooh\", a giant [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] in a superhero costume who attacks Tremble during the Torture of The Mind sequence. This idea, as with many others in the film's script, was rapidly dropped, and Prowse was re-cast as a [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]-type monster for the closing scenes. The final sequence was principally directed by former actor/stuntman [[Richard Talmadge]].<ref name=Missing />\n\n====Unfinished scenes====\nSellers went absent for days or weeks at a time, refused to appear in his scenes with Welles<ref name=Sellers /> and exited before all of his scenes had been shot.<ref name=\"TCM\">{{cite web |last=Stafford |first=Jeff |title=Casino Royale |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/21301%7C0/Casino-Royale.html |website=Turner Classic Movies |access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref> As a result, Sellers was unavailable for the filming of an ending and other interlinking scenes, leaving the filmmakers to devise a way to make the existing footage work without him.

Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, he calls for the car, \u00e0 la ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'', to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; the next thing that is shown is Tremble being tortured. Outtakes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending to play the piano on Andress' torso), in the finale \u2013 blowing out the candles while in highland dress \u2013 and at the end of the film when all the various \"James Bond doubles\" are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot).<ref name=Missing />\n\nAs well as this, an entire sequence involving Tremble going to the front for the underground James Bond training school (which turns out to be under [[Harrods]], of which the training area was the lowest level) was never shot, thus creating an abrupt cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble exiting the lift into the training school.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nMany sequences were dropped, so that several actors never appeared in the final cut, including [[Ian Hendry]] (as 006, the agent whose body is briefly seen being disposed of by Vesper), [[Mona Washbourne]] and [[Arthur Mullard]].<ref name=Missing />\n\n===Music===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Casino Royale\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Herb Alpert|Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass]] and [[Dusty Springfield]]\n| cover      = Burt Bacharach - Casino Royale (1967 soundtrack).png\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1967\n| recorded   = 1967\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 34:27\n| label      = [[Colgems]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Casino Royale Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]\n | single1date = 29 January 1967\n}}\n}}\nFor the [[film score|musical score]], Feldman decided to bring in [[Burt Bacharach]], who had done the score for his previous production, ''What's New Pussycat?''. Bacharach worked over two years writing for ''Casino Royale'', in the meantime composing the ''[[After the Fox]]'' score and being forced to decline participation in ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]''.

It is played in the scene of Vesper recruiting Evelyn, seen through a man-size aquarium in a seductive walk. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. The song was a Top 10 radio hit at the [[KGB-FM|KGB]] and [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] radio stations.

A clarinet melody would later be featured in a [[Cracker Jack]] peanut popcorn commercial. As an in-joke, a brief snippet of [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]'s song \"[[Born Free (Matt Monro song)|Born Free]]\" is used in the film.

Afterward, Crowther felt, the script became tiresome, repetitive and filled with clich\u00e9s due to \"wild and haphazard injections of 'in' jokes and outlandish gags\", leading to an excessive length that made the film a \"reckless, disconnected nonsense that could be telescoped or stopped at any point\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/04/29/archives/screen-population-explosion-victimssecret-agents-abound-in-casino.html|title=Screen: Population Explosion Victims|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Crowther, Bosley|date=29 April 1967|access-date=12 August 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925013351/https://www.nytimes.com/1967/04/29/archives/screen-population-explosion-victimssecret-agents-abound-in-casino.html|archive-date=25 September 2020}}</ref>\n\nWriting in 1986, [[Danny Peary]] noted, \"It's hard to believe that in 1967 we actually waited in anticipation for this so-called James Bond spoof.
