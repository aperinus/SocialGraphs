Its original Czech title is '''''N\u011bco z Alenky''''', which means \"Something from Alice\". It is a loose adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s first [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] book, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865), about a girl who follows a white rabbit into a bizarre fantasy land. Alice is played by Krist\u00fdna Kohoutov\u00e1. The film combines live action with [[stop motion]] animation, and is distinguished by its dark production design.\n\nFor \u0160vankmajer, a prolific director of short films for more than two decades, ''Alice'' became his first venture into [[Feature film|feature-length filmmaking]]. The director had been disappointed by other adaptations of Carroll's book, which interpret it as a fairy tale. His aim was instead to make the story play out like an amoral dream. The film won the feature film award at the 1989 [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] is sitting by a brook, throwing rocks in the water. She is then in her sitting room, throwing rocks in a cup of tea. A creaking noise draws her attention to a [[taxidermy|taxidermic]] [[White Rabbit]] in a glass case. Alice hides beneath a [[writing desk]] while the Rabbit comes alive, dressing himself and retrieving a pair of scissors from a hidden drawer, which he uses to smash the case, freeing himself.\n\nAlice follows the Rabbit into a writing desk on top of a hill; crawling into the drawer after him, she soon finds herself in an elevator that deposits her atop a pile of leaves. The leaves begin to stir on their own, revealing another desk in which Alice finds a tiny key. Alice uses the key to open a miniature door, through which she sees the Rabbit disappear into a painted garden; she herself is too large to fit through the door. She finds a bottle labelled \"Drink Me\". Drinking it transforms her into a small [[china doll]] in her likeness. She then finds a [[butter tart]] that causes her to grow large, again rendering her unable to fit through the door. Frustrated, Alice cries until the room floods with tears. The White Rabbit rows by, dropping a tray of tarts. Eating one returns Alice to her doll-size and she is able to retrieve the key and follow the Rabbit.\n\nOnce through the door, Alice finds herself at the banks of a brook and encounters the White Rabbit, who mistakes her for his maid and commands her to fetch scissors from his house. Inside, she drinks from another ink bottle and returns to her true size, trapping her inside the now too-small house. The Rabbit and his animal companions try to force her out by launching [[Bill the Lizard|a skull-headed lizard]] through the window. Alice kicks him away, causing him to burst and spill his sawdust innards. The angry animals imprison Alice inside an Alice-shaped doll, which they lock inside a storage room filled with specimen jars.\n\nAlice breaks free of the doll and discovers a key inside a sardine can. She uses the key to escape the storage room, stepping into a hall of doors. Behind one of them, she meets [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|a stocking-Caterpillar]] in a room swarming with sock-worms that bore holes in the floor. The Caterpillar tells her that eating one piece of his [[Darning#Darning tools|darning mushroom]] causes things to grow, while the other piece causes things to shrink. Alice follows the sound of a crying baby to a tiny dollhouse, which she enlarges by eating a piece of the mushroom. She discovers the Rabbit inside tending a piglet in baby's clothes. The Rabbit escapes while Alice chases the piglet downstairs, where a mechanical tea party is being hosted by a [[wind-up toy|wind-up]] [[March Hare]] and a [[marionette]] [[The Hatter|Hatter]]. The Rabbit flees to the attic and Alice follows.\n\nBehind a curtain of clothes, Alice reaches the painted garden. The [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King]] and [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] march into the garden with a troop of playing cards. The Queen commands the White Rabbit to [[decapitate|behead]] two fencing [[Jack (playing card)|Jack]]s, among others; he does so with his scissors. The Queen invites Alice to play [[croquet]], but Alice storms off when the mallets and balls turn into chickens and hedgehogs. In a courtroom, she is put on trial for eating the Queen's tarts. Alice tries to explain herself but the King commands her to follow a script. Annoyed, Alice starts eating the tarts and the Queen demands Alice's head. Alice asks \"Which one?\", and her head morphs into the heads of the other characters. The Queen demands ''all'' her heads be severed, and the Rabbit advances with his scissors.\n\nAlice wakes in her sitting room. Around the room are the various household objects that populated her dream: playing cards, china dolls, marionettes, an inkwell, and socks in a sewing basket. The case that formerly contained the taxidermic rabbit is still broken and empty. Opening the hidden drawer in the case, she finds the White Rabbit's scissors. Examining the scissors, Alice says to herself, \"He's late, as usual. I think I'll cut ''his'' head off.\"\n\n==Cast==\n*Krist\u00fdna Kohoutov\u00e1 as [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n'''In Alice's English version''':\n*[[Camilla Power]] as Alice's voice\n\n==Production==\n[[Jan \u0160vankmajer]], who had been making [[short film]]s since the mid-1960s, says he got the confidence to make a feature-length film after finishing the shorts ''[[Jabberwocky (1971 film)|Jabberwocky]]'' and ''Down to the Cellar''. He described [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', a work which had followed him since he was a child, as \"one of the most important and amazing books produced by this civilisation.\"<ref name=esm>{{Cite web|last1=Stafford |first1=Mark |last2=S\u00e9lavy |first2=Virginie |date=2011-06-14 |url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2011/06/14/interview-with-jan-352vankmajer/ |title=Interview with Jan \u0160vankmajer |work=Electric Sheep Magazine |access-date=2011-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623155950/http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2011/06/14/interview-with-jan-352vankmajer/ |url-status=live |archive-date=23 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> He argued that other film adaptations of the story had interpreted it as a fairy tale, but that Carroll had written it like a dream, and that was what he wanted to transmit: \"While a fairy tale has got an educational aspect \u2013 it works with the moral of the lifted forefinger (good overcomes evil), dream, as an expression of our unconscious, uncompromisingly pursues the realisation of our most secret wishes without considering rational and moral inhibitions, because it is driven by the principle of pleasure.

James described the animation as \"remarkably fluid\" and held forward the dynamics of the film, which contrasts visually captivating elements with superficiality: \"Mr. \u0160vankmajer never lets us forget we are watching a film in which an actress plays Alice telling a story\", although, \"with its extreme close-ups, its constant motion and its smooth animation, the film is so visually active that it distracts us from a heavy-handed fact - this is a world of symbols come alive.\"<ref>{{Cite web|last=James|first=Caryn|date=1988-08-03|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DEED91631F930A3575BC0A96E948260|title=An 'Alice' for Adults|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2011-07-09}}</ref> Upon the British home-media release in 2011, [[Philip Horne]] reviewed the film for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.
