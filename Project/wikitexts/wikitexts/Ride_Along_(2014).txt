During their 24-hour patrol of Atlanta, Ben accidentally gets wrapped up in James' hunt for an arms dealer, Omar (Laurence Fishburne).\n\nThe film was produced by [[Relativity Media]], [[Cube Vision Productions]] and [[Universal Pictures]], and distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. Following two premieres in Atlanta and [[Los Angeles]], the film was released worldwide on January 17, 2014. A sequel, ''[[Ride Along 2]]'', was released on January 15, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nUndercover detective James Payton is on an falsifying passports operation by \"Omar\". After a shootout with the smugglers, his lieutenant asks him to drop the Omar case, which he doesn't.\n\nBen Barber, a jumpy, short, tight-up high school security guard who plays video games in his spare time, applies to the Atlanta City Police Academy. He asks James for his blessing to marry his sister, Angela. He says Ben has to go on a \"[[ride along]]\" to prove he's worthy of her. If successful, James will recommend him for the academy, and give his blessing. \n\nTaking Ben to the station, James asks dispatch to give him all the 1-26s that are called in, which he has Ben take care of. Questioning the informant Runflat, James uncovers the connection between Serbia and \"Omar\" and hears a shipment will come in later that day. Leaving the park, James takes Ben to the local shooting range and finds out that [[Zastava M92]]'s have been given to the store. When a 1-26 is called in, so Ben and James go to the [[Sweet Auburn Curb Market]], where drunken 'Crazy Cody' is being disorderly. Ben tries to subdue him but can't, so James arrests him.\n\nBen asks to be taken home before Angela's call. He tells her about his stressful day, and she tells him James plays poker with a guy named Crazy Cody, and that 1-26s are code for annoying situations for newbies as a joke. He then goes into the police station and sees Cody laughing with James, Santiago and Miggs.\n\nUpset, Ben refuses to go home and instead takes a 1-26 for a disturbance at a strip club. There, two men get into a [[mexican standoff]] with James and Ben which Ben, believing is another joke call, fools around. James subdues them, then they are tipped off about a gun deal with Omar's men. Ben confronts James about the 1-26s.\n\nJames receives a call from Santiago in the car, finding out that Runflat had turned himself in. Ben says Runflat's brother told him in the park Runflat had just got out of prison, news to James so, another clue. They talk to Runflat's other brother, J, to get the location of the gun deal. During the conversation, Ben accidentally shoots J, who reveals where and when the deal will take place.\n\nDeciding to infiltrate the warehouse with Santiago and Miggs, James leaves Ben in the car. They betray him, turning out to be crooked cops working for Omar. James is then tied up, which Ben sees. Santiago mocks and criticizes James for being unsociable and egocentric. As the deal begins, Ben pretends to be Omar (as no one has ever seen the real Omar). Successfully fooling them, he wreaks havoc at the deal. Just as he is about to leave with James, the real Omar appears. A shootout ensues, and many of Omar's men are killed. Ben shows his sharp reflexes and knowledge of battle (thanks to his gaming). James and Ben take the money from the deal and escape before the warehouse explodes as Ben's grenade hits a box of explosives and destroys James's car. Unbeknownst to them, Santiago, Miggs and Omar escape.\n\nSantiago and Miggs arrive at Angela's apartment, tying her up. As she was playing one of Ben's interactive games, Ben's fellow gamers hear the confrontation between Angela, Miggs and Santiago through Ben's headset. At the hospital, being for a gunshot wound in the leg, Ben receives a call from a fellow gamer, who tells James something's going on at the apartment. After seeing some cops arriving at the hospital, James and Ben sneak out to the apartment with Omar's money. James injures Miggs, before fighting with Santiago. As Santiago is about to shoot James, Angela knocks him out. Ben gets knocked out by Omar in a fight. Omar takes the bag of money and Angela, and leaves.\n\nJames follows Omar and Angela, confronting him. Just as Omar is about to shoot James, Ben slides over a car and kicks him. James shoots Omar twice, injuring him. Police arrest Omar, Miggs, and Santiago, and James finally gives Ben his blessing.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Ben and Angela are engaged, and Ben is weeks away from graduating from the police academy. At a barbecue at James', Ben blows up the barbecue and goes flying into the bushes, killing the neighbor's dog.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| footer      = [[Ice Cube]] stars as James Payton and [[Kevin Hart]] stars as Ben Barber in the film.\n| total_width = 300\n| image1      = Ice-Cube 2014-01-09-Chicago-photoby-Adam-Bielawski.jpg\n| alt1        = Ice Cube\n| image2      = Kevin Hart 2014 (cropped 2).jpg\n| alt2        = Kevin Hart\n}}\n* [[Ice Cube]] as James Payton,<ref name=\"THR-Cube\" /> undercover police detective\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Ben Barber,<ref name=\"Universal-Ben\" /> James' sister's boyfriend\n* [[Tika Sumpter]] as Angela Payton,<ref name=\"three-cast\" /> James's sister and Ben's girlfriend\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Santiago,<ref name=\"Leguizamo\" /> a detective and Miggs' partner\n* [[Bryan Callen]] as Miggs,<ref name=\"three-cast\" /> a detective and Santiago's partner\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Omar,<ref name=\"Fishburne\" /> a boss of smugglers\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Lieutenant Brooks,<ref name=\"McGill\" /> head of the Atlanta Police department\n\nAdditional cast includes [[Gary Owen (comedian)|Gary Owen]] as Crazy Cody,<ref name=\"Owen\" /> [[Jay Pharoah]] as Runflat,<ref name=\"three-cast\" /> [[David Banner]] as Pawnshop Jay, [[Drago\u0219 Bucur]] as Marko, [[Gary Weeks]] as Dr. Cowan, [[Jacob Latimore]] as Ramone and [[Lil' P-Nut|Benjamin Flores, Jr.]] as Morris, Runflat's brother.\n\n==Production==\nOn November 29, 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that comedian [[Jason Mantzoukas]] had been hired to write cop-buddy comedy film ''Ride Along'' for [[New Line Cinema]], originally written by [[Greg Coolidge]], with [[Ice Cube]] set to star in and produce the film along with Matt Alvarez, through Cube's film company, Cube Vision Productions.<ref name=THR-Cube>{{cite news|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Ice Cube film, Fox comedy on scribe's plate|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ice-cube-film-fox-comedy-91783|access-date=January 13, 2014|newspaper= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 29, 2009}}</ref> The film was originally offered to [[Warner Bros.]], but according to Cube, the Warner executives reportedly passed down the offer because they told him that an action movie with two Black stars wouldn't sell well overseas; a studio executive claimed that the concerns about the stars were false and that the true reason of passing down ''Ride Along'' was because script disagreements.<ref name=TWSJ-Cube>{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=\u2018Friday\u2019 Franchise Frozen as Ice Cube and Warner Bros.
