The film stars [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[Nick Robinson (American actor)|Nick Robinson]], [[Ron Livingston]], [[Maggie Siff]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Maria Bello]], [[Maika Monroe]], and [[Liev Schreiber]].\n\nDevelopment began in March 2012, when [[Columbia Pictures|Sony]] picked up the film rights to [[The 5th Wave (series)|the trilogy of novels]], with [[Graham King]]'s production company [[GK Films]] and [[Tobey Maguire]]'s Material Pictures. Filming took place in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], from October 2014 to January 2015, with Jon Billington serving as the production designer. ''The 5th Wave'' was released on January 22, 2016, in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It grossed $109 million worldwide against a $54 million budget, and received generally unfavorable reviews from critics for the CGI, storyline, and screenplay, though some praise was given to the acting.<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.-->\n[[Ohio]] high-schooler [[Cassie Sullivan]], armed with an [[M4 carbine]], emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned [[gas station]]. Upon entering, she hears a voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they ask each other to put their respective weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket\u2014and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him, thinking he was holding a gun, but he was in fact holding a [[Christian cross]]; the screen cuts to black to show her [[backstory]].\n\nA colossal alien spaceship is circling Earth, guided by [[extraterrestrial life]] referred to as \"The Others\". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that disables all electrical power and communications worldwide, and shuts off the engines of moving vehicles, including planes in mid-flight. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate<!--- the method is not explained in the film, but in the novel --> the planet's [[geology]] and [[fault lines]], causing [[earthquakes]] and [[megatsunamis]] that destroy coastal cities and islands, including [[Hallandale Beach]], [[London]], [[Bangkok]] and [[New York City]]. In Ohio, [[Lake Erie]] floods, but Cassie and her younger brother Sam are able to escape by climbing a tree. For the 3rd Wave, The Others modify a strain of [[avian influenza]] and spread it across the planet via birds. The population is decimated, with Cassie's mother one of the victims. In the 4th wave, the Others possess common humans and start killing other humans.\n\nCassie, Sam and their father find a summer camp in use as a refuge in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an Army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 5th Wave and they will take the children to safety at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the Army [[massacre|massacring]] all the adults, her father included. Cassie makes her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by a sniper and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a young man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his [[consciousness]] into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.\n\nAt the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's [[Telescopic sight|scopes]]. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind. Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military Others evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base. Ben's squad is reunited, and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival.\n\n=== Differences Between The Novel And The Film ===\nBeing an adaptation of a novel, there are several major differences between the book and the film\n\n* Crisco, a major character who is killed in front of Cassie, was cut from the film\n* Chris, a boy who Ben befriends and later kills, was also cut from the film.\n* In the novel, it is directly stated that Colonel Vosch killed Cassie's father while it is unclear who killed Cassie's father in the film\n* In the novel, Ben's family is killed from an attack at home. In the film, Ben's family died from plagues during the 3rd Wave\n* The mind-mapping alien simulation Wonderland was cut from the film.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-01-22 |title=15 Book to Movie Changes
