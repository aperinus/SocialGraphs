When Jews are banned from the city's tennis club, the family allow the friends of their two children, Mic\u00f2l and the sickly Alberto, to use their private tennis court. Among them are Giorgio, son of a Jewish businessman, and Giampiero, a communist and a gentile. Giorgio has been in love with Mic\u00f2l since early adolescence, but she is ambivalent.\n\nAs war approaches, Giorgio's brother moves to France to pursue his studies while Giorgio, close to graduation, decides to stay in Ferrara and, when Jews are banned from the university library, the Finzi Contini allow him to use their private library. Mic\u00f2l leaves to stay in Venice and on her return to Ferrara she definitively rejects Giorgio.\n\nIn 1940, when Italy enters the war, Giampiero is conscripted while Giorgio as a Jew is exempt. On his last night  in Ferrara, Giampiero meets up with Giorgio and, when they part at midnight. Giorgio has an urge to see Mic\u00f2l one more time. Climbing the wall of the Finzi Contini park, he notices a light in the garden hut and, looking in, sees a naked Mic\u00f2l beside Giampiero.\n\nIn 1943, amid rumours of further measures against the Jews, Giorgio goes underground and the police arrest the whole Finzi Contini family, holding them with the other Jews of the city in a school. Mic\u00f2l finds herself herded with her frail grandmother into the same classroom she attended as a child. There she sees Giorgio's father, who informs her that Giorgio has escaped and that Giampiero has died in Russia. The two embrace, their future as unclear as the fog hanging over the city.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Dominique Sanda.jpg|thumb|Dominique Sanda as Mic\u00f2l]]\n[[File:Il giardino dei Finzi Contini - Lino Capolicchio.jpg|thumb|Lino Capolicchio as Giorgio]]\n{{castlist|\n*[[Lino Capolicchio]] as Giorgio\n** [[Alessandro D'Alatri]] as young Giorgio\n*[[Dominique Sanda]] as Mic\u00f2l Finzi-Contini\n** {{ill|Cinzia Bruno|it}} as young Mic\u00f2l\n*[[Helmut Berger]] as Alberto Finzi-Contini\n*[[Fabio Testi]] as Giampiero Malnate\n*[[Romolo Valli]] as Beniamino, Giorgio's father\n*Camillo Cesarei as Ermanno Finzi-Contini\n*Katina Morisani as Olga Finzi-Contini\n*Inna Alexeievna as Regina Finzi-Contini\n*{{ill|Barbara Pilavin|it}} as Giorgio's mother\n*{{ill|Ettore Geri|it}} as Perotti, the majordomo\n*{{ill|Raffaele Curi|it}} as Ernesto\n*Giampaolo Duregon as Bruno\n*Marcella Gentile as Fanny\n*Franco Nebbia as Professor De Marchis\n}}\n\n=== Casting notes ===\n''The Garden of the Finzi-Continis'' marked the debut or near-debut for some of its stars, notably the actors who played the two adult Finzi-Contini children, Mic\u00f2l and Alberto. For [[Dominique Sanda]] (Mic\u00f2l), it was her first Italian feature film (followed by such films as ''[[The Conformist (film)|The Conformist]]'' and ''[[1900 (film)|1900]]''). For [[Helmut Berger]] (Alberto), it was his third feature film.\n\n== Production ==\nThe director seriously considered entrusting the lead role to singer [[Patty Pravo]], who had to refuse due to too many work commitments.\n\n=== Screenplay ===\nContrary to Bassani's novel, the film directed by De Sica does not use the narrating ego technique, which for the novel is compared by the critics to the author himself. However, while following the director an entirely dialogative film narrative, the novelist's narrator coincides with the role of the protagonist Giorgio. Contrary to Bassani's novel, the film directed by De Sica ends with the episode of the deportation. In the novel, Giorgio, who fled abroad in time, will tell the story of his youth and his first impossible love, recalling the facts after 14 years.\n\n=== De Sica and Bassani ===\nInitially Giorgio Bassani cooperated in the drafting of the dialogues and the screenplay of the film but after some disagreements and misunderstandings, the writer and the director entered into open conflict (also due to the fact that in the film the relationship between Mic\u00f2l and Malnate is made explicit, which is not present in the novel). Bassani asked that his name be removed from the credits of the film. His name was duly removed as one of its script-writers and the opening credits just state that it was \u2018freely derived from the novel by Giorgio Bassani'.\n\n=== Locations ===\n[[Villa Ada]] near Rome was used for the garden, while the Finzi Contini villa is the Litta Bolognini villa in Vedano al Lambro, a municipality in the Brianza area, adjacent to the Monza Park.\nThe entrance to the garden in the film is really in Ferrara, in Corso Ercole I d'Este, near where Bassani had imagined it. The other exteriors were shot in Ferrara; noteworthy are the Estense castle and the city walls, the Palazzo dei Diamanti, the Cathedral of San Giorgio and also some famous streets.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 1972, ''The Garden of the Finzi-Continis'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and was nominated for [[Academy Awards|Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium]].<ref name=\"Oscars1972\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1972 |title=The 44th Academy Awards (1972) Nominees and Winners |access-date=2011-11-27 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> It won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[21st Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1971.<ref name=\"berlinale 1971\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1971/03_preistr_ger_1971/03_Preistraeger_1971.html |title=Berlinale 1971: Prize Winners |access-date=2010-03-14 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> It was De Sica's penultimate film.\n\n== Restoration ==\nThe restored digital version, curated by the [[Istituto Luce Cinecitt\u00e0]] and performed at the \"Studio Cine\" in Rome and \"The rediscovered image\" in Bologna, was presented in the spring of 2015.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n* [[List of submissions to the 44th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[John C.
