It stars [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[Kim Cattrall]], [[Estelle Getty]], [[Meshach Taylor]] and [[G. W. Bailey]]. The [[Film score|original music score]] was composed by [[Sylvester Levay]]. A modern retelling of the [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion myth]], the film revolves around a chronically underemployed passionate artist named Jonathan Switcher who lands a job as a department-store window dresser and the [[mannequin]] he created which becomes inhabited by the spirit of a woman from [[Ancient Egypt]], but only comes alive for Jonathan.\n\n''Mannequin'' received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for its main title song, \"[[Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now]]\" by [[Starship (band)|Starship]],<ref name=\"oscar\">{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearch?action=searchLink&displayType=1&BSCategoryExact=1600&BSFromYear=60|title=60th Academy Awards for Best Original Song|publisher=The Academy Awards of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=14 May 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530225135/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearch?action=searchLink&displayType=1&BSCategoryExact=1600&BSFromYear=60|archive-date=30 May 2012}}</ref> which reached number one on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 1991, a sequel to the film called ''[[Mannequin Two: On the Move]]'' was released. Though the sequel takes place in the same department store in Philadelphia, only actors Meshach Taylor and Andrew Hill Newman returned from the original film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding the plot. It recommends a length of between 400 and 700 words. -->\n\nIn [[Ancient Egypt]], Ema \"Emmy\" Hesire takes refuge in a pyramid, pleading to the gods that she find true love rather than enter an arranged marriage. Emmy suddenly vanishes before her mother's eyes. In 1987 [[Philadelphia]], Jonathan Switcher is a sculptor working at a mannequin warehouse and finishes a single female mannequin he considers a masterpiece. His boss fires him for spending time trying to make his mannequins works of art rather than assembling several each day.\n\nJonathan takes a number of odd jobs and is fired each time for working too slowly because he tries to make each project artistic. His girlfriend Roxie Shield, an employee of the Illustra department store, dumps him, criticizing him as a flake. After his motorcycle breaks down in the rain, Jonathan passes the Prince & Company department store. Seeing his mannequin in the display window, he remarks she is the first work that made him feel like a true artist. The next morning, he saves store owner Claire Timkin from being injured by her own shop sign. Grateful, Claire orders store manager Mr. Richards (who is secretly paid by Illustra to sabotage Prince & Company so it can be bought) to give Jonathan a job. Viewed with suspicion by security guard Captain Felix Maxwell, Jonathan works with and befriends window dresser Hollywood Montrose. When Jonathan is putting together a window display, the mannequin he made comes to life with Emmy's spirit. She says she has existed for centuries as a muse, sometimes inhabiting the works of an artist she admires and inspires. She has encountered amazing people but has never found true love. Emmy explains the gods allow her life when she and Jonathan are unobserved, otherwise she is a mannequin.\n\nWith Emmy's help, Jonathan's window display is a massive success. Now placed in charge of visual merchandising, Jonathan asks Emmy to continue helping with the displays. Over several weeks, they create several popular displays, attracting new business while also deepening their relationship. Montrose realizes Jonathan loves a mannequin he created but doesn't judge him. Illustra's chief executive B.J. Wert sends Roxie to poach Jonathan but he refuses, saying he now works for people who value him. Annoyed by Felix's ineptitude and Richards' attitude towards Jonathan, Claire fires them. Deeply impressed with his work, Claire makes Jonathan vice president of the department store. One night, Jonathan takes Emmy through the city on his motorcycle, despite how unusual this seems to bystanders. He is witnessed by Richards and Felix, who conclude he is deeply fixated on a female mannequin.\n\nRichards and Felix (who now works for Illustra) steal the female mannequins from Prince & Company. The next morning, Jonathan confronts Wert about the theft, who makes another job offer. Furious over Jonathan caring so much about the mannequin he calls Emmy, Roxie storms off. Jonathan follows Roxie while being pursued by security guards including Felix. Wert and Richards demand the police be called. Roxie loads the stolen mannequins into the store's large trash compactor, then is knocked out by the debris. As Hollywood holds the pursuers at bay with a fire hose, a janitor watches Jonathan jump onto the compactor's conveyor belt to save the mannequin that is Emmy. As Jonathan risks his life for her, Emmy comes to life. Once safe, she realizes she is truly and permanently alive again. Emmy thanks the gods for uniting her with her true love and Jonathan promises to love her forever.\n\nWhile the janitor wonders if other mannequins will come to life, Hollywood arrives and realizes Emmy was alive the entire time. Felix and his fellow guards rush in, followed by Wert and Richards who demand the police arrest Jonathan. Claire arrives, revealing she has security video of Richards and Felix breaking and entering, and committing theft. She accuses Wert of conspiracy, and Jonathan adds the man also kidnapped Emmy. Wert fires Roxie as he is arrested and hauled away alongside Richards and Felix. Jonathan realizes the security footage may have shown him being romantic with a mannequin, but Claire coyly suggests he shouldn't worry about that. Some time later, Jonathan and Emmy are married in the store window of Prince & Company, with Claire as [[maid of honor]] and Hollywood as best man. Numerous pedestrians outside the store window applaud the wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Jonathan Switcher\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Ema \"Emmy\" Hesire\n* [[Estelle Getty]] as Claire Timkin\n* [[James Spader]] as Mr. Daryl Richards (His first name is never mentioned in the film) \n* [[G.

The film was specifically designed to appeal to target demographics. Though not a star, McCarthy was cast after tests of his films showed that he strongly appealed to girls, the target audience.<ref name=\"nytobit\">{{cite web |first=Bruce |last=Weber |title=Joseph Farrell, Who Used Market Research to Shape Films, Dies at 76 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/business/joseph-farrell-dies-at-76-used-market-research-to-shape-films.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=28 December 2011 |date=25 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nThe producers contacted various state film commissions across America looking for an elegant center city department store in which to shoot the movie. They visited stores across the country before settling on [[Wanamaker's|John Wanamaker's]] in Philadelphia (now Macy's Center City). The store was given the name Prince and Company for the film.<ref name=\"mcall\" /> Interior filming at Wanamaker's took about three weeks, with shooting usually beginning around 9 pm and going until 6 am the next day.\n\nAdditional scenes were filmed in the formal gardens behind [[The Hotel Hershey]]. Scenes taking place at the fictitious department store Illustra were filmed at the [[Boscov's]] department store in the former Camp Hill Mall (now Camp Hill Shopping Center) near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].\n\nPhiladelphia mayor [[Wilson Goode]] estimated the film injected $3 million into the city.<ref name=\"mcall\">{{Cite web | url= http://articles.mcall.com/1987-02-14/entertainment/2563952_1_mannequin-filming-movie |title= \"''Mannequin'' Is Kim Cattrall's Display Window\" |author=Paul Willistein |work=[[The Morning Call]] |date=February 14, 1987 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408080020/http://articles.mcall.com/1987-02-14/entertainment/2563952_1_mannequin-filming-movie| archive-date=2013-04-08 |access-date= 4 May 2020 }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the start of filming, Cattrall spent six weeks posing for a Santa Monica sculptor, who captured her likeness. Six mannequins, each with a different expression, were made.<ref name=\"mcall\"/> Cattrall recalled (1987), \"There's no way to play a mannequin except if you want to sit there as a dummy [...] I did a lot of body-building because I wanted to be as streamlined as possible. I wanted to match the mannequins as closely as I could.\"<ref name=\"mcall\"/> The actress also said that doing the film made her feel \"grown up\":\n\n<blockquote>I've become more of a leading lady instead of, like, the girl... All the other movies that I've done I played the girl, and the plot was around the guy. I've never had anybody to do special lighting for me, or find out what clothes look good on me, or what camera angles are best for me... In this movie, I learned a lot from it. It's almost like learning old Hollywood techniques... I've always been sort of a tomboy. I feel great being a girl, wearing a dress.<ref name=\"mcall\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Music===\nFeatured in the film, \"[[Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now]]\" was a song co-written by [[Albert Hammond]] and [[Diane Warren]] and recorded by the American rock band [[Starship (band)|Starship]] in 1986. It is a duet featuring Starship vocalists [[Grace Slick]] and [[Mickey Thomas (singer)|Mickey Thomas]]. It reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on April 4, 1987,<ref>{{cite web |title=Starship |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/starship/chart-history/hsi/ |website=Billboard }}</ref> and topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] for four weeks the following month, becoming the UK's second-biggest-selling single of 1987.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film debuted at number three at the US box office behind ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', grossing $6 million over the four-day [[President's Day]] weekend, surpassing the other opener, ''[[Over the Top (1987 film)|Over the Top]]'' starring [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Stallone Loses A Box-office Arm-wrestle|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=19 February 1987|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-19/entertainment/ca-4353_1_box-office|access-date=2 June 2012|first=Jack|last=Mathews}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 18, 1987|page=3|title='Platoon' Pumps Up February B.O.; Brisk Biz At Top}}</ref> The film grossed a total of $42.7 million in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mannequin.htm |title=''Mannequin'' (1987) |access-date=14 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 20% based on 40 reviews and an average rating of 3.9/10.
