Hercules is said to be the demigod son of [[Zeus]], who completed the legendary [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labors]] after he was betrayed by [[Hera]], who drove him insane and caused him to murder his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]] and their children during a visit to King [[Eurystheus]]. Throughout the film, it is not clearly established that Hercules is truly the son of Zeus and many are skeptical of the claim as well as of the stories of Hercules' famous Twelve Labors. Despite this, Hercules displays unusual inhuman strength and nigh-unmatched skill in combat. However, Hercules is frequently haunted by the memory of the deaths of his wife and children by his hand, as well as visions of [[Cerberus]].\n\nAfter finishing a recent mission and saving his nephew on the [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonian]] Coast in Northern Greece in 358 BC, Hercules and his team are celebrating and drinking at a tavern when they are approached by Ergenia, the daughter of [[Cotys I (Odrysian)|King Cotys]], who wants Hercules to train the armies of [[Thrace]] to defend the kingdom from bloodthirsty [[warlord]] [[Rhesus of Thrace|Rhesus]]. Hercules accepts after he and his men are offered his weight in gold, and the band is welcomed to Thrace by Cotys and General [[Sitalces|Sitacles]], leader of the Thracian army. However, Rhesus has reached the [[Bessi]] tribe in Central Thrace and Cotys insists that Hercules lead the army into battle to defend the Bessi, despite Hercules's objections and the army's lack of training. However, they are too late as Rhesus' supposed sorcery has turned the Bessi against the [[Thracians]]. After the Bessi are defeated following a long and disastrous battle which results in at least half the Thracian forces being killed, Hercules and his allies properly train the army. When the training is complete, Hercules and Sitacles confront Rhesus and his soldiers after a day-long journey on the battlefield before [[Strandzha|Mount Asticus]]. The Thracians force Rhesus' army to retreat after an arduous battle, but Rhesus himself rides out to confront Hercules and is defeated by him.\n\nRhesus is taken back to Thrace as a prisoner, where he is publicly tormented and humiliated. Taking pity, Hercules stops the townsfolk from throwing more objects at him. When Hercules mentions Rhesus' actions of burning down villages, Rhesus tells him it was not him or his army and tells Hercules that he has been fighting on the wrong side. Later, in the palace hall, Rhesus is chained up and left on display. Noticing that Ergenia has taken pity on him, Hercules confronts her and finds out Rhesus was telling the truth about the villages, in that he was merely retaliating against Cotys's aggressive attempts to expand his kingdom. Although Ergenia doesn't agree with Cotys's methods, she goes along out of fear, as her father poisoned her husband, the previous king. Furthermore, Cotys threatens her son Arius, the true heir to the throne.\n\nAfter receiving their reward, the mercenaries are ready to leave, but Hercules decides to stay behind to stop Cotys, with all but Autolycus choosing to follow him. However, they are overpowered and captured by Sitacles and his men. While chained, Hercules is confronted by King Eurystheus, who is in league with Cotys. Eurystheus reveals that he drugged Hercules the night his family died, viewing him as a threat to his power. Hercules's family was in fact killed by three [[Black wolf|black wolves]] sent by Eurystheus, resulting in Hercules's constant hallucinations of Cerberus. When Cotys orders Ergenia to be executed for her betrayal, Hercules is encouraged by Amphiaraus to believe in himself just as everyone believes in him. In a show of superhuman strength, Hercules breaks free of his chains, saving Ergenia and defeating the wolves single-handedly. Hercules releases the prisoners, including Rhesus, and then confronts Eurystheus, impaling him with his own dagger and avenging his family; however, he is ambushed by Sitacles, who is then stabbed to death by Iolaus, who has been secretly honing his skills. Outside, Hercules and his forces battle Cotys and his army. Arius is taken hostage, but rescued by Autolycus, who has decided to return to help his friends. In the ensuing battle, Tydeus is mortally wounded while protecting Arius, but fights on, slaughtering numerous Thracian soldiers until he falls; later dying in Hercules's arms. Again using inhuman strength, Hercules pushes a massive statue of Hera from its foundations and uses it to crush Cotys and many of his soldiers.\n\nThe remaining soldiers see Hercules as lightning flashes in the background. The surviving soldiers bow to Hercules and Arius takes the throne, with Ergenia at his side. As the credits roll, an animated retelling of the Twelve Labors shows how Hercules accomplished these feats with the help of his companions.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as [[Hercules]], the son of [[Zeus]].\n* [[Irina Shayk]] as [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFqY089piQ4  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211220/GFqY089piQ4 |archive-date=2021-12-20 |url-status=live|title=Hercules Official Trailer #1 (2014) \u2013 Dwayne Johnson, Ian McShane Movie HD |publisher=YouTube |date=March 26, 2014 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref> the late wife of Hercules.\n* [[Rebecca Ferguson]] as Ergenia, the Princess of Thrace.\n* [[Ian McShane]] as [[Amphiaraus]], the seer.\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as [[Autolycus]], the rogue.\n* [[Aksel Hennie]] as [[Tydeus]], the wild barbarian.\n* [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] as [[Atalanta]],<ref>{{cite news | url = https://variety.com/2013/film/news/ingrid-bolso-hercules-dwayne-johnson-1200442001/ | title = Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Set to Battle with Dwayne Johnson in 'Hercules' (Exclusive) | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first= Justin  | last= Kroll | date= May 2, 2013 | access-date= December 19, 2013}}</ref> the Amazon archer.\n* [[Reece Ritchie]] as [[Iolaus]], the storyteller.\n* [[Tobias Santelmann]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Dwayne Johnson in first trailer for Hercules \u2013 watch|date=March 25, 2014|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a560108/dwayne-johnson-in-first-trailer-for-hercules-watch.html|publisher=Digital Spy}}</ref> as [[Rhesus of Thrace|Rhesus]], a supposed bloodthirsty warlord.\n* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as [[Eurystheus|King Eurystheus]], a former employer of Hercules.\n* [[Peter Mullan]]<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.deadline.com/2014/06/hercules-trailer-dwayne-johnson-the-rock-video/|title= [WATCH] 'Hercules' Trailer: The Rock is back in new preview|work= [[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher= [[PMC (company)|PMC]]|date= June 3, 2014|access-date= June 16, 2014}}</ref> as General Sitacles, the leader of Thrace's army.\n* Isaac Andrews as Arius, the Crown Prince of Thrace.\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Cotys I (Odrysian)|King Cotys]], the ruler of [[Thrace]] and the father of Ergenia and grandfather of Arius.\n* [[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/more/news/hercules-joe-anderson-twilight-1200501962/ |title='Hercules' Adds 'Twilight' Actor to the Cast |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 26, 2013 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> as [[Phineus|Phineas]]\n* [[Steve Peacocke]] as Stephanos<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/news/article/-/17086011/steve-peacocke-bound-for-hollywood-then-home-to-summer-bay/ |title=Steve Peacocke bound for Hollywood, then home to Summer Bay \u2013 Home and Away \u2013 Official Site |publisher=Au.tv.yahoo.com |date=May 9, 2013 |access-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113150054/http://au.tv.yahoo.com/home-and-away/news/article/-/17086011/steve-peacocke-bound-for-hollywood-then-home-to-summer-bay/ |archive-date=November 13, 2013  }}</ref>\n* [[Barbara Palvin]] as [[Antimache]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BarbaraPalvin/status/379692409334292480 |title=Twitter / BarbaraPalvin: Had an amazing day shooting |publisher=Twitter.com |date=September 16, 2013 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BrettRatner/status/377111773390069760 |title=Twitter / BrettRatner: So excited to have @barbarapalvin |publisher=Twitter.com |date=September 9, 2013 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Ian Whyte (actor)|Ian Whyte]] as Bessi Leader\n* [[Christopher Fairbank]] as Gryza, leader of the Macedonian pirates\n* [[Robert Maillet]] as Thracian Executioner\n\n==Production==\nThe film is directed by [[Brett Ratner]].<ref name=mcshane>{{cite news | url = https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ian-mcshane-joins-dwayne-johnson-430270 | title = Ian McShane Joins Dwayne Johnson in 'Hercules' for MGM and Paramount (Exclusive) | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date= March 21, 2013 | first=Borys | last= Kit| access-date= December 19, 2013}}</ref> The producers are [[Beau Flynn]], Barry Levine, and Ratner, with [[Peter Berg]], Sarah Aubrey, Ross Fanger, and Jesse Berger serving as executive producers.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter1\"/>\n\nTo prepare for the role, Johnson took on a grueling training routine, stating: \"I trained and worked harder than ever for 8 months for this role.
