It is the third film adaptation and a remake to the [[Carrie (1976 film)|1976 adaptation]]  of [[Stephen King]]'s [[Carrie (novel)|1974 novel of the same name]] and the fourth film in the [[Adaptations of Carrie|''Carrie'' franchise]]. The film was produced by [[Kevin Misher]], with a screenplay by [[Lawrence D. Cohen]] and [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]]. The film stars [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as the titular character [[Carrie White]], alongside [[Julianne Moore]] as [[Margaret White (Carrie)|Margaret White]]. The cast also features [[Judy Greer]], [[Portia Doubleday]], [[Gabriella Wilde]], [[Ansel Elgort]] and [[Alex Russell (actor)|Alex Russell]]. The film is a modern [[re-imagining]] of King's novel about a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother, who uses her telekinetic powers with devastating effect after falling victim to a cruel prank at her senior prom.\n\nThe film held its world premiere at the [[Arclight Hollywood]] in [[Los Angeles]] on October 7, 2013, and was released in the United States by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Screen Gems]] on October 18, 2013. The film received mixed reviews, with critics calling it \"unnecessary\" and criticizing the lack of originality and scares, though they praised the modern updates and cast.<ref name=\"Reviews\">{{cite web|last1=Gilman|first1=Greg|title=What the Critics Think of 'Carrie': Super Scary - or Unnecessary|url=https://www.thewrap.com/critics-think-carrie-super-scary-unnecessary-remake/|website=[[TheWrap]]|access-date=April 27, 2018|date=18 October 2013}}</ref> It grossed $84 million worldwide at the box office.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=May 2022}} <!--- massively bloated 850 word \"synopsis\" versus 400-700 word norm --->\n\n<!-- NOTE: The plot summary is currently 700 words long, which is the maximum permitted length.

She intends to kill the infant but changes her mind.\n\nYears later, her daughter [[Carrie White|Carrie]], a shy, unassertive girl, nears her graduation from Ewen High School in [[Maine]]. While showering after the gym at school, Carrie experiences her [[Menarche|first menstrual period]]. Never having been taught to prepare for this, she believes she is bleeding to death and runs out of the shower yelling for help. The other girls ridicule her by throwing [[tampons]] and [[Sanitary napkin|pads]] at her. Longtime bully Christine \"Chris\" Hargensen records everything on her [[smartphone]] and uploads it to [[YouTube]]. The school's physical education teacher Miss [[Rita Desjardin]], comforts Carrie and sends her home with Margaret, who believes menstruation is a sin. Margaret demands that Carrie abstain from showering with the others. When Carrie refuses, Margaret hits her in the forehead with a Bible and locks her in her \"prayer closet.\" As Carrie screams to be let out, a crack appears on the door, and the [[crucifix]] in the closet begins to bleed. Carrie begins to experience more signs over the oncoming days that point to her having [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. She researches her abilities, learning to harness them.\n\nMiss Desjardin threatens the girls who teased Carrie with an ultimatum: either endure [[Recruit training|boot-camp-style]] detention for their behavior or be suspended from school, prohibiting them from attending prom; Chris is the only one who refuses to take part in detention and is suspended from school after denying the allegation and refusing to give up her smartphone. [[Sue Snell]] regrets her part in the incident. To make amends, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts Tommy's invitation and makes a prom dress at home. Her mother, Margaret, forbids Carrie to attend. Asking her mother to relent, Carrie manifests her telekinesis. Margaret believes this power comes from the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] and is proof that Carrie has been corrupted by sin. Meanwhile, Chris, her boyfriend Billy Nolan, and his friends plan revenge on Carrie; they obtain pig blood to put in a bucket.\n\nOn Prom Night, Margaret tries to prevent Carrie from going, but Carrie uses her powers to lock her mother in the closet. At the prom, Carrie is nervous and shy, but Tommy kindly puts her at ease. As part of Chris and Billy's plan, Chris's friend, Tina Blake, discreetly slips fake ballots into the voting box, which names Carrie and Tommy as prom queen and king. At home, Sue receives a text from Chris, taunting her about her scheme to humiliate Carrie. Sue drives to the prom, arriving just as Carrie and Tommy are about to be crowned. Billy warns Chris not to tell anyone about the bucket as it is criminal assault; Chris agrees to say nothing. Sue sees the bucket of blood dangling above Carrie and attempts to warn someone. Desjardin locks her out of the gym, suspecting that Sue plans to hurt Carrie.\n\nChris dumps the blood onto Carrie and Tommy. Nicki plays the \"shower video\" of Carrie on the large screens above the stage, inciting laughter from some in the audience. Carrie pushes Miss Desjardin with her powers when Desjardin attempts to help her. The bucket falls onto Tommy's head, killing him. Enraged, Carrie takes her revenge and uses her telekinesis to kill nearly every student and staff, but spares Desjardin. An electrical wire merges with leaking water, and a fire breaks out. As the school burns to the ground, Carrie walks away, leaving behind a trail of destruction. Chris and Billy attempt to drive away, but Carrie crashes the car, killing Billy. Chris attempts to run Carrie over, but Carrie lifts the car and throws it at a gas station, killing her. Carrie tips over an [[Utility pole|electric power pole]], setting the car on fire.\n\nCarrie arrives home and takes a bath and changes into her nightgown afterward. Carrie tearfully tells Margaret about the prank. Carrie and Margaret embrace and Margaret recounts Carrie's conception. After having shared a bed platonically with her husband, they yielded to temptation one night, and, after praying for strength, Carrie's father \"[[Marital rape|took]]\" Margaret, who enjoyed the experience. After the talk, Margaret stabs Carrie in the back with a knife. She declares that she must kill Carrie in order to prevent the Devil from possessing her again and attacks Carrie, but Carrie kills her with several sharp tools. She becomes hysterical and makes stones rain from the sky to crush the house. When Sue arrives, a furious Carrie lifts her with her powers but senses that Sue is pregnant with a baby girl. Carrie protects Sue and throws her out of the house to safety as the house collapses and sinks, apparently killing Carrie as well.\n\nAfter giving her testimony in court regarding the prom incident, Sue visits Carrie and Margaret's grave, which has been vandalized to read \"CARRIE WHITE BURNS IN HELL,\" and places white roses by the headstone. As she leaves, the gravestone begins to break, and Carrie's enraged scream is heard.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]]  as [[Carrie White]]\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as [[Margaret White (Carrie)|Margaret White]]\n* [[Judy Greer]] as [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Desjardin]]\n* [[Gabriella Wilde]] as [[Sue Snell]]\n* [[Portia Doubleday]] as Chris Hargensen\n* [[Alex Russell (actor)|Alex Russell]] as Billy Nolan\n* [[Ansel Elgort]] as Tommy Ross\n* [[Barry Shabaka Henley]] as Principal Henry Morton\n* Zo\u00eb Belkin as Tina Blake\n* [[Karissa Strain]] as Nicki Watson\n* [[Katie Strain]] as Lizzy Watson\n* [[Samantha Weinstein]] as Heather Mason\n* [[Demetrius Joyette]] as George Dawson\n* [[Mouna Traor\u00e9]] as Erika Langton \n* [[Hart Bochner]] as John Hargensen (uncredited)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/10/19/carrie-ellis-die-hard-hart-bochner-cameo/|title='Carrie' remake includes great 'Die Hard' cameo|author=Darren Franich|website=Ew.com|access-date=April 4, 2022}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2011, representatives from MGM and Screen Gems announced that the two companies were producing a film remake of ''Carrie''.

The Blu-ray features an alternative opening and ending and nine deleted scenes.\n\nIn the alternative opening, a young Carrie has a discussion with her teenage neighbor, who is sun-bathing, over the fact that Margaret believes that women with breasts are sinful. Margaret catches them in the conversation and believes that the neighbor is offending Carrie, not before the neighbor's mother disagrees with her. Suddenly, stones begin to rain only on the White household. Margaret, believing it is a sign from God, takes shelter inside her home with a distressed Carrie.\n\nIn the alternative ending, the cracking gravestone and the court speech are not present. After placing the roses on Carrie's grave, Sue suddenly feels pain from her pregnancy and begins to go into labor. Sue is in the hospital and is preparing to give birth to her baby. As she struggles to give birth, Carrie's bloody hand suddenly emerges and grabs Sue's arm. Sue screams loudly as she wakes up in her own bedroom with her mother comforting her and telling her that her nightmare is over. A subliminal frame image of Carrie's bloodied arm is seen grabbing onto Sue's arm as Sue continues to scream in her room.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 50% approval rating with an average rating of 5.49/10 based on 187 reviews.
