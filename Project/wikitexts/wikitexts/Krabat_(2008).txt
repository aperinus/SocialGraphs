The plot is about a boy, Krabat (played by [[David Kross]]), who learns [[black magic]] from a sorcerer (played by [[Christian Redl]]). A [[DVD-Video]] encode of the film is distributed in the [[United Kingdom]] as ''Krabat and the Legend of the Satanic Mill''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peccapics.com/product/krabat/|title=Krabat and the Legend of the Satanic Mill|website=peccapics.com|accessdate=16 July 2021}}</ref>\n\nIt premiered in the US at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Roy|url=https://www.roy-stevenson.com/siff.html|title=Krabat|publisher=[[Seattle International Film Festival]]|accessdate=16 July 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the Plague sweeps across Europe after the [[Thirty Years' War]] a boy named Krabat ([[David Kross]]) is left without family, food, or hope. An old Mill Keeper takes him in as an apprentice. There are eleven other boys working at the mill, and Krabat develops a friendship with one of them, a young man named Tonda ([[Daniel Br\u00fchl]]).\nSoon, Krabat learns that the apprentices are also taught dark sorcery by the master, and one of the rituals (during Easter) lead to an excursion to the nearby village Schwarzkollm where Krabat meets a young girl and falls in love with her. There, Tonda also talks to one of the girls; both seem to be in love with each other. Later, Tonda warns Krabat that the master must never know the name of his girl.\n\nOne day, while protecting the nearby village from soldiers, Tonda makes an error and his girl's name (Worschula) is revealed to the master. The next day, Worschula turns up in the creek, dead. Krabat mistakenly blames Lyschko, another apprentice. Tonda becomes a recluse and anticipates the end of the year.\nKrabat's first Silvester (New Year's Eve) brings to light the true horror of the mill. Every Silvester, one of the boys must be sacrificed so the master may remain young. And so at midnight, Krabat's best friend Tonda is viciously murdered, and when Krabat tries to help him he is stopped by the other boys who tell him that \"there is nothing we can do\".  Before he dies, Tonda tells Krabat there is another boy in the mill Krabat can confide in. He also tells Krabat to take two sacks of flour to the village.\n\nKrabat is distraught over Tonda's death, but does as he is told. Bringing the sacks of flour to a tree near the village, Krabat once again meets the girl he first met while protecting the village. He is in love, but does not let the girl tell him her name, fearing for her life. Instead, he calls her Kantorka (Choir leader).\nDuring the ritual at Easter night, he goes to the village to meet her, this time along with a boy called Juro who appears to be mentally disabled and not able to learn the trade or properly do magic. When Juro tells Krabat that they must leave and go back to the mill, Krabat insists that he will stay with Kantorka. Juro then uses powerful magic to convince Krabat to come back with him, revealing that he is in truth highly intelligent and powerful, even able to change the weather. Juro promises Krabat that he will help him escape the master, and tells him that his girl must ask for him on Silvester to set him free. \nKrabat tells Kantorka that she must do so, and she agrees and gives Krabat a lock of her hair, telling him to have another boy deliver it to her when the time is right.\n\nWhen Krabat returns, a series of climactic events are set in motion.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[David Kross]] as Krabat \n*[[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as Tonda\n*[[Christian Redl]] as The Master \n*[[Robert Stadlober]] as Lyschko\n*[[Paula Kalenberg]] as Kantorka \n*[[Hanno Koffler]] as Juro \n*[[Anna Thalbach]] as Worschula \n*[[Charly H\u00fcbner]] as Michal \n*Moritz Grove as Merten \n*[[Tom Wlaschiha]] as Hanzo \n*Sven H\u00f6nig as Andrusch \n*Stefan Haschke as Staschko \n*David Fischbach as Lobosch \n*[[Daniel Steiner]] as Petar \n*Tom Lass as Kubo \n*Daniel Fripath as Kito \n*Ionu\u021b B\u0103ia\u0219 as Baro \n*Mac Steinmeier as Godfather Death \n*Carmen Ungureanu as Krabat's Mother\n*[[Otto Sander]] as the narrator (voice only)\n\n==Reception==\nFlickering Myth reviewed the [[DVD]] release of the film, in which he wrote: \"Krabat has great potential even though the film doesn\u2019t fully realize it. It fails to explore some interesting story elements and is a little slow on pace. However, it focuses really well on the themes of temptation; with the lure of black magic and power, and friendship; with the sense of brotherhood and companionship Krabat experiences. It\u2019s an enjoyable dark fantasy that has a Grimm fairytale-like feel to it and effective performances from the lead actors\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2011/07/dvd-review-krabat-and-legend-of-satanic/|title=DVD Review \u2013 Krabat and the Legend of the Satanic Mill (2008)|website=Flickering Myth|date=3 July 2008|accessdate=16 July 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n''Krabat'' was nominated for the [[Deutscher Filmpreis]] in 2009 in the categories ''Best Production Design'', ''Best Music'' and ''Best Sound Design''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article3369406/Die-Nominierungen-im-Ueberblick.html|title=Die Nominierungen im \u00dcberblick|trans-title=The nominations at a glance|language=de|department=Kultur|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=16 July 2021}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Krabat \u2013 The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (1978)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0772181}}\n\n{{Marco Kreuzpaintner}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Krabat}}\n[[Category:2000s fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:German teen fantasy films]]\n[[Category:German fantasy adventure films]]\n[[Category:Dark fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Films based on fairy tales]]\n[[Category:Films based on fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on German novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on Slavic mythology]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Marco Kreuzpaintner]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 17th century]]\n[[Category:2000s teen fantasy films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]\n[[Category:2000s German-language films]]"}]}}}}
