Tashi's ditzy fianc\u00e9e, Sonia, is an air hostess who agrees to deliver a package for Vladimir Dragunsky to Somayajulu, without realizing its contents or that Somayajulu is a [[gangster]]. Sonia asks Tashi to deliver the package. Tashi, in turn, asks Nitin to do so. But Nitin is unable to do so as he is suffering from diarrhea. Nitin hands Sonia's package to Arup for delivery to Somayajulu, along with a package containing his [[stool sample]] for delivery to Nitin's doctor. Arup mixes up the two bags. Somayajulu, furious, tortures Vladimir to find his package.\n\nMeanwhile, Nitin photographs his landlord Manish with a prostitute. He sends an envelope with the photographs to his landlord to blackmail him. Tashi is with Sonia, when his colleague Menaka calls him on the pretext of work. When he reaches the place he realizes that it is just a party and Menaka called him just to have fun. Menaka's ex-husband Rajeev sees them together and punches Tashi in the eye in a fit of jealousy. Tashi retaliates and knocks Rajeev out. As Tashi and Menaka leave they are chased by a furious Rajeev and his friends who shoot at them. The duo barely manages to escape.\n\nVladimir informs Somayajulu that the mix-up must have been caused by Sonia as she didn't know what she was carrying in the package. Somayajulu calls Sonia, informs her about the mix-up and asks her to give him the address of the person who had delivered the package. When Tashi arrives into his apartment, he walks into Somayajulu who has Arup standing on a stool with a noose around his neck. On hard interrogation, Somayajulu discovers the mix-up and realizes that the package must be with Nitin's doctor.\n\nNitin gets the package from his doctor's office, wherein Somayajulu finds his thirty diamonds hidden inside. Upon recovering his booty, he orders his henchmen to kill the three roommates. One of them is about to shoot Tashi, when another kicks the stool on which Arup was standing to hang him. Luckily for the roommates, the ceiling of the apartment collapses, since it can't take Arup's weight. The cave-in knocks out Somayajulu and his men, leaving one with broken arms. Tashi, Arup and Nitin escape with the diamonds and spend the night at Menaka's place. The next day they sell the diamonds to a local jeweller.\n\nAs the roommates prepare to get out of town with the money, they get a call from Somayajulu who has kidnapped Sonia. He threatens to kill her if they don't return the diamonds. The trio tries to buy back the diamonds from the jeweller, who demands double the sale amount.\n\nWithout the money, Tashi comes up with a plan. Nitin, Arup, Tashi and Menaka disguise themselves in [[burqa]]s and rob the jeweller, leaving him the bag of money. They flee in Tashi's car with the police on their tail and go to the hotel where Somayajulu is holding Sonia. As they are about to make the exchange with Somayajulu, the police arrive at the hotel room where a shoot-out between the police and Somayajulu's gang.\n\nNitin, Arup, Tashi, Sonia and Vladimir who had hit the floor during the gunfight, are left as the only survivors. Menaka, who by now realises that she likes Tashi, is upset to learn about his engagement and walks away from him. Tashi breaks off his engagement to Sonia. Later, it is revealed that Nitin did not return the cash to the jewellery store owner, and had kept most of the money for himself (whereupon he abandons blackmailing the landlord). The film ends when Menaka comes to the roommates' apartment to return Tashi's car's hubcap lost while escaping from Rajeev. Tashi jumps into her car through the open window and kisses her passionately.\n\nProducer-actor [[Aamir Khan]] is seen dancing in a song and dance performance as the credits start rolling.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Vir Das,Poorna Jagannathan,Abhinay Deo,Aamir Khan,Shenaz Treasuryvala,Imran Khan,Kunal Roy Kapoor From The \u2018Delhi Belly\u2019 success bash.jpg|thumb|Vir Das, Poorna Jagannathan, Abhinay Deo, Aamir Khan, Shenaz Treasuryvala, Imran Khan, Kunal Roy Kapoor at the film's success bash]]\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]] as Tashi Malhotra / Tashi Dorjee Lhatoo\n* [[Kunaal Roy Kapur]] as Nitin Berry\n* [[Vir Das]] as Arup\n* [[Rahul Singh (actor)|Rahul Singh]] as Rajeev Khanna (Menaka's [[Ex-husband]])\n* [[Poorna Jagannathan]] as Menaka Vashisht\n* [[Shenaz Treasury]]wala as Sonia Mehra\n* [[Raju Kher]] as Zubin Mehra (Sonia's Father)\n* [[Vijay Raaz]] as Somayajulu\n* John Gabriel as Lucky (Somayajulu's Henchman)\n* [[Lushin Dubey]] as Mrs. Mehra (Sonia's Mother)\n* [[Paresh Ganatra]] as Manish Chand Jain\n* Rahul Pendkalkar as Prateek Jain\n* [[Sanjay Taneja]] as DIG Phool Chand Jain (Manish's Brother)\n* Rajendra Sethi as Sudhir Adlakha (the jeweller)\n* Pradeep Kabra as Brajesh (Somayajulu's Henchman)\n* Dharmendar Singh as Bunty (Somayajulu's Henchman)\n* [[Kim Bodnia]] as Vladimir Dragunsky\n* [[Anusha Dhandekar]] as VJ Sophaya\n* Bugs Bhargava as Swapan Bannerjee (Arup's boss)\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Disco Fighter (Guest Appearance in song \"I Hate You (Like I Love You)\") also as the producer\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThis film was written by [[Akshat Verma]], a Los Angeles based writer, who first wrote the screenplay as a part of his studies at Screenwriting programme at [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|UCLA]], under the title ''Say Cheese''.
