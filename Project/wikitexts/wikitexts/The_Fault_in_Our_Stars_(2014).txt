The film stars [[Shailene Woodley]] and [[Ansel Elgort]], with [[Laura Dern]], [[Sam Trammell]], [[Nat Wolff]], and [[Willem Dafoe]] in supporting roles. Woodley plays a sixteen-year-old cancer patient forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she meets and subsequently falls in love with another cancer patient, played by Elgort.\n\nDevelopment began in January 2012 when [[Fox 2000]], a division of [[20th Century Fox]], optioned the rights to adapt the novel into a feature film. [[Principal photography]] began on August 26, 2013, in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], with a few additional days in [[Amsterdam]], The Netherlands, before concluding on October 16, 2013. Pittsburgh doubled for all of the scenes set in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], the novel's setting, as well as for some interior scenes set in Amsterdam.\n\n''The Fault in Our Stars'' had its world premiere at [[Seattle International Film Festival]] on May 16, 2014, and was released in North America on June 6, 2014, by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise given to Woodley's and Elgort's performances and chemistry together, as well as the screenplay. The film was number one at the box office during its opening weekend and grossed $307{{nbsp}}million worldwide against a budget of $12{{nbsp}}million. It was released on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on September 16, 2014, and earned $42{{nbsp}}million in total domestic video sales.<ref name=\"The Numbers\">{{cite web |title=The Fault in Our Stars (2014) |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fault-in-Our-Stars-The#tab=summary |website=The Numbers. |publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC. |access-date=August 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918191530/http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Fault-in-Our-Stars-The |archive-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Indianapolis]] teenager Hazel Grace Lancaster is living with [[thyroid cancer]] that has spread to her lungs. Believing she is depressed, her mother urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient [[support group]]. There, Hazel meets Augustus \"Gus\" Waters who is at the support group for his friend Isaac, who has eye cancer. Gus lost a leg to [[osteosarcoma|bone cancer]] but has since gone into remission. Hazel and Gus bond over  their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite books. Gus gives Hazel ''The Prince of Dawn'', while Hazel recommends ''An Imperial Affliction'', a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience, but has an abrupt ending. Its author, Peter Van Houten, retreated to [[Amsterdam]] following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.\n\nWeeks later, Gus tells Hazel he has tracked down Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and has been corresponding with Van Houten via email. Van Houten says he is only willing to answer their questions in person. Gus then surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam, acquired from a charity organization that fulfills the wishes of children with critical illnesses. After a medical setback, Hazel's doctors eventually allow the trip.\n\nHazel and Gus arrive in Amsterdam, where Gus confesses his love for Hazel during a romantic meal sponsored by Van Houten. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to discover he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. It is revealed that the emails from Van Houten had actually come from Lidewij, who arranged the meeting without Van Houten's knowledge. Van Houten taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers to a piece of fiction and belittles her medical condition. The teens leave distraught. Lidewij invites them sightseeing to compensate for their ruined experience and they visit the [[Anne Frank House]], where they share their first kiss. The next day, Gus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned, spread throughout his body, and is now terminal.\n\nAfter their return to Indianapolis, Gus' health continues to deteriorate. Gus invites Hazel and Isaac to his \"pre-funeral\". They both deliver eulogies, during which Hazel tells Gus she would not trade their short time together for anything. Gus dies eight days later. Van Houten attends his funeral, revealing that Gus had demanded he do so. Van Houten explains to Hazel that ''An Imperial Affliction'' was inspired by his own daughter, Anna, who died from [[leukemia]] at a young age. He gives Hazel a piece of paper, which she initially discards but later retrieves after Isaac reveals that the paper was a letter from Gus, who had asked Van Houten for assistance in writing a eulogy for Hazel.\n\nHazel reads the letter, in which Gus accepts his fate and professes his love for Hazel. As Hazel finishes the letter, she lies on her back in her lawn and looks up at the stars, smiling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 150\n| footer    = Top to bottom: The film stars [[Shailene Woodley]] as Hazel Grace Lancaster, [[Ansel Elgort]] as Augustus Waters, and [[Nat Wolff]] as Isaac.\n| image1    = Shailene Woodley March 18, 2014 (cropped).jpg\n| alt1      = Shailene Woodley\n| image2    = Ansel Elgort (35875410045) (colour edited).jpg\n| alt2      = Ansel Elgort\n| image3    = Nat Wolff TIFF 2012.jpg\n| alt3      = Nat Wolff\n}}\n* [[Shailene Woodley]] as Hazel Grace Lancaster\n** Lily Kenna as young Hazel<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sperling |first1=Nicole |title=As ''The Fault in Our Stars'' is filmed, John Green turns astrologer |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2014/feb/15/entertainment/la-et-mn-john-green-fault-in-our-stars-20140216 |access-date=August 29, 2014 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 15, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Ansel Elgort]] as Augustus \"Gus\" Waters<ref name=\"casting2\" />\n* [[Nat Wolff]] as Isaac, Augustus' best friend<ref name=\"casting3\" />\n* [[Laura Dern]] as Frannie Lancaster, Hazel's mother<ref name=\"casting3\" />\n* [[Sam Trammell]] as Michael Lancaster, Hazel's father<ref name=\"casting4\" />\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Peter Van Houten<ref name=\"casting6\" />\n* [[Lotte Verbeek]] as Lidewij Vliegenthart, Van Houten's assistant\n* [[Mike Birbiglia]] as Patrick, the support group leader<ref name=\"casting5\" />\n* Ana Dela Cruz as Dr. Maria\n* Milica Govich as Mrs. Waters, Augustus's mother\n* David Whalen as Mr. Waters, Augustus's father\n* [[Emily Peachey]] as Monica\n* Emily Bach as Monica's Mom\n* Carole Weyers as the voice of [[Anne Frank]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nOn January 31, 2012, it was announced that [[Fox 2000]], a division of [[20th Century Fox]], had optioned the rights to adapt [[John Green]]'s novel ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'' for a feature film.<ref name=\"deahl\">{{cite news |first=Rachel |last=Deahl |date=January 31, 2012 |title=Fox Options John Green's ''Fault in Our Stars'' |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/50442-fox-options-john-green-s-fault-in-our-stars.html |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=July 23, 2013}}</ref> [[Wyck Godfrey]] and Marty Bowen were due to produce the film with their production company, [[Temple Hill Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Abrams |first1=Rachel |title=Fox 2000 options ''Fault in Our Stars'' |url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/fox-2000-options-fault-in-our-stars-1118049583/ |access-date=August 10, 2014 |publisher=variety.com |date=February 1, 2012}}</ref> [[Stephen Chbosky]], who directed ''[[The Perks of Being a Wallflower (film)|The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]'' (also filmed in Pittsburgh), was in talks to direct the film but turned it down because of its similarity to ''Perks''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hypable.com/perks-author-stephen-chbosky-says-he-had-a-meeting-to-direct-the-fault-in-our-stars-movie/ |title=Stephen Chbosky says he met about directing Fault In Our Stars movie |work=Hypable |date=February 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918200002/http://www.hypable.com/perks-author-stephen-chbosky-says-he-had-a-meeting-to-direct-the-fault-in-our-stars-movie/ |archive-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref> On February 19, 2013, [[Josh Boone (director)|Josh Boone]] was hired as director;<ref name=\"Director\">{{cite news |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |last2=Lewis |first2=Andy |title=''The Fault in Our Stars'' Movie Lands Director |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fault-stars-movie-lands-director-422485 |access-date=August 10, 2014 |publisher=hollywoodreporter.com |date=February 19, 2013}}</ref> [[Scott Neustadter]] and [[Michael H.
