Javier's wife has left him because he was tricked by a woman called Azucena into recounting his sexual fantasies over a phoneline and cassettes of his imaginary activities are on sale throughout Madrid. Miranda, while walking her dog after her husband has gone to work and her daughter to school, can't resist quick encounters with men.\n\nImmediately attracted to one another, in the car park after the session Javier and Miranda get into the back of an abandoned car. When a corpse is found in the car next morning, the police enquiry is headed by F\u00e9lix, who is Miranda's husband. He would be delighted to pin the murder onto Javier, who he has seen with Miranda.\n\nAfter putting all her sleeping pills into F\u00e9lix's soup, Miranda goes with luggage and dog to the hotel where Javier is staying. While making love with her, he has a traumatic flashback. He had gone to the flat of Azucena, who was blackmailing him, and as they made love he discovered that \u201cshe\u201d was a transvestite. Enraged beyond control at this further betrayal, he had killed \u201cher\u201d and put the body in the car. Going straight to the airport, Javier, Miranda and dog board a plane that looks Brazilian. F\u00e9lix, having bought a puppy to replace the lost pet, meets his daughter off the school bus.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Victoria Abril]] as Miranda\n* [[Javier Bardem]] as Javier\n* [[Carmelo G\u00f3mez]] as F\u00e9lix\n* [[Juan Diego (actor)|Juan Diego]] as Jare\u00f1o\n* [[Sergi L\u00f3pez i Ayats|Sergi L\u00f3pez]] as Claudio\n* {{ill|Javier Albal\u00e1|es}} as Juancar\n* [[Mar\u00eda Ad\u00e1nez]] as Juani\n* [[Carmen Balagu\u00e9]] as Bego\u00f1a\n* [[Manuel Manqui\u00f1a]] as Manuel\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb title|0177747}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|between_your_legs}}\n\n{{Manuel G\u00f3mez Pereira}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Between Your Legs}}\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1999 drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Manuel G\u00f3mez Pereira]]\n[[Category:1990s Spanish films]]\n\n{{1990s-Spain-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
