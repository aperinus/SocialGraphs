The [[ensemble cast]] features [[Henry Fonda]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]], [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Peter Lawford]], [[Gene Tierney]], [[Franchot Tone]], [[Lew Ayres]], [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Eddie Hodges]], [[Paul Ford]], [[George Grizzard]], [[Inga Swenson]], [[Betty White]] and others.\n\nThe title derives from the [[United States Constitution]]'s Article II, Sec. 2, cl. 2, which provides that the president of the United States \"shall nominate, and by and with the [[Advice and Consent]] of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States.\"\n\nThe film, set in [[Washington, D.C.]], follows the nomination process of a man who commits [[perjury]] in confirmation hearings for his nomination as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[President of the United States|president]] nominates Robert A. Leffingwell as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. The second-term president, who is ill, has chosen him in part because he does not believe that [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Harley Hudson, whom both he and others usually ignore, will successfully continue the administration's foreign policy should the president die.\n\nLeffingwell's nomination is controversial within the [[US Senate|Senate]], which must use its [[advice and consent]] powers to approve or reject the appointment. The parties of both the president and the minority are divided. [[Senate Majority Leader]] Bob Munson, the [[senior senator]] from [[Michigan]], loyally supports the nominee despite his doubts, as do the hard-working [[Senate Majority Whip|majority whip]] Stanley Danta of [[Connecticut]] and womanizer Lafe Smith of [[Rhode Island]]. Demagogic peace advocate Fred Van Ackerman of [[Wyoming]] is especially supportive, but Munson repeatedly advises him not to aggravate the situation. Although also of the majority party, the curmudgeonly [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] Seabright \"Seab\" Cooley of [[South Carolina]] dislikes Leffingwell for both personal and professional reasons and leads the opposition.\n\nThe [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] appoints a [[United States congressional subcommittee#Senate Subcommittees|subcommittee]], chaired by majority member Brigham Anderson of [[Utah]], to evaluate the nominee. The young and devoted family man is undecided on Leffingwell. Cooley dramatically introduces a surprise witness, Herbert Gelman, during the subcommittee's hearing. The minor [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]] clerk testifies that he was briefly affiliated with a [[Communism|communist]] [[Clandestine cell system|cell]] with Leffingwell and two others at the [[University of Chicago]]. Leffingwell denies the charge and questions Gelman's credibility but later tells the president that he had committed [[perjury]] and that Gelman was correct. He asks the president to withdraw his nomination, but the president refuses.\n\nCooley identifies another member of the cell, senior treasury official Hardiman Fletcher. He forces Fletcher to confess to Anderson, who tells Munson. Despite personal lobbying by the president, the subcommittee chairman insists that the White House withdraw the nomination because of Leffingwell's perjury or he will [[subpoena]] Fletcher to testify. The president angrily refuses, but the majority leader admits that the White House will soon have to nominate another candidate. Anderson delays his committee's report on Leffingwell, but the president sends Fletcher out of the country, angering the senator.\n\nAnderson's wife receives anonymous phone calls from a man warning that unless the subcommittee reports favorably on Leffingwell, information about what happened with \"Ray\" in [[Hawaii]] will be disclosed. A worried Anderson visits fellow army veteran Ray Shaff in New York. Shaff admits that he sold evidence of a past [[homosexual]] relationship between the two. Hudson and Anderson's friend, Smith, joins others in attempting to counsel the troubled chairman, but unable to reconcile his duty and his secret, Anderson takes his own life.\n\nThe president denies knowing about the blackmail to Munson and Hudson. He tells the majority leader that he is dying and that Leffingwell's confirmation is vital. Munson criticizes Cooley for opposing the nominee but not exposing Fletcher and thus forcing Anderson to bear the pressure alone. Anderson's death nonetheless permits the subcommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee to proceed with the nomination. Both report favorably to the full Senate.\n\n[[File:Advise and Consent (1962).jpg|thumb|right|Sen. Seabright Cooley (Charles Laughton) speaking against the Leffingwell nomination on the Senate floor]]\nIn the [[United States Senate#Senate Chamber|Senate Chamber]], Cooley apologizes for his \"vindictiveness.\" While he will vote against Leffingwell and his \"alien voice,\" the senator will not ask others to follow. Munson, moved by Cooley's action, cites the \"tragic circumstances\" surrounding the confirmation. The majority leader will vote for Leffingwell but will permit a [[conscience vote]] from others. Hudson's [[quorum call]] and the majority leader's refusal to [[recognition (parliamentary procedure)|yield the floor]] prevent Van Ackerman from speaking until Munson asks for the \"yeas and nays,\" ending debate. The majority leader tells Van Ackerman that but for the Andersons' privacy, the Senate would have [[List of United States senators expelled or censured|censured and expelled]] him, as he was responsible for the blackmail. Van Ackerman leaves the chamber before the vote.\n\nMunson's side is slightly ahead until Smith unexpectedly votes against Leffingwell, and the majority leader prepares for the vice president to [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States|break the tie]] in the nominee's favor. [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents enter the chamber, and Hudson receives a message from the [[Senate Chaplain|Senate chaplain]]. He announces that he will not break the tie, thus causing the nomination to fail, and that the president has died during the vote. As he leaves with the Secret Service, Hudson tells Munson that he wants to choose his own secretary of state. The film ends as Munson makes a [[motion to adjourn]] because of the former president's death.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Henry Fonda]] as Robert A.

Tierney had withdrawn from acting for several years because of her ongoing struggle with [[bipolar disorder]]. ''Advise & Consent'' was the last of four films that she made for Preminger and one of her last major film roles overall. ''Advise & Consent'' was Laughton's last film; he had [[cancer]] during filming and died six months after the film's release. Lawford, [[John F.

He wrote, \"It is in this latter complication that the nature of the drama is finally exposed for the deliberately scandalous, sensational and caustic thing it is. Mr. Preminger has his character go through a lurid and seamy encounter with his old friend before cutting his throat, an act that seems unrealistic, except as a splashy high point for the film.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crowther|first1=Bosley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/06/07/archives/screen-advise-and-consent-opensmovie-on-washington-is-at-two.html|title=Screen: 'Advise and Consent' Opens: Movie on Washington Is at Two Theatres|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 7, 1962}}</ref>\n\nCritic [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] described ''Advise & Consent'' as \"pure hokum.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Reverse Angle: A Decade of American Film|url=https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo|url-access=registration|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Crown Publishers Inc. |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo/page/79 79]|isbn=9780517544716}}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. the film has an approval rating of 75% based on reviews from 12 critics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Advise and Consent (1962) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/advise_and_consent |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2020-10-10}}</ref>\n\nOn May 10, 2005, [[Warner Bros.]] released the film on [[DVD]] as part of its Controversial Classics box set.
