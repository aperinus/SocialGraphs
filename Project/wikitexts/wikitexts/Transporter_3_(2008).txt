It is the third and final installment in the original trilogy of the ''[[Transporter (franchise)|Transporter]]'' franchise. Both [[Jason Statham]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]] reprise their roles, as [[Frank Martin (Transporter)|Frank Martin]] and Inspector Tarconi, respectively. The first film in the series to be directed by [[Olivier Megaton]], it continues the story of Frank Martin, a professional \"transporter\" who has returned to France to continue his low-key business of delivering packages without question. It grossed over $109 million, making it the highest-grossing film in the trilogy.\n\n==Plot==\nFrank Martin, having returned from [[Miami]] to the [[French Riviera]], is unsuccessfully fishing with his friend, Inspector Tarconi when Tarconi receives a call about a black [[Audi A8#Second generation (D3, Typ 4E; 2002\u20132009)|Audi A8]] that sped past French customs and evaded the police in a car chase. While Tarconi returns to headquarters to give Frank's alibi, in [[Odessa]], Ukraine, the Environmental Agency Minister, Leonid Tomilenko, receives a threat from corrupt Ecocorp official Jonas Johnson to reopen business negotiations.\n\nAt night, the Audi crashes into Frank's home, with a wounded transporter, Malcolm Melville, whom Frank had referred when he declined a previous job. As paramedics take away Malcolm, Frank discovers a woman in the back seat of the Audi who warns him not to take her from the car \u2013 she shows him a metal bracelet she and Malcolm have been wearing which explodes if it gets too far from the vehicle. Frank rushes outside, but the ambulance, getting out of range, explodes and  kills Malcolm. Frank is then knocked out by one of Johnson's henchmen.\n\nJohnson places an explosive bracelet on Frank, forcing him to take a package and the woman, Valentina, to [[Budapest]]. Tomilenko negotiates to postpone signing Ecocorp's agreement that would allow the ship with the chemicals into his country. While Tarconi researches into Johnson's motivations, Frank goes off-course, visiting a garage to try to deal with the bracelet, but as he fends off Johnson's men, his mechanic friend Otto cannot disarm the device on the car. In Budapest, Johnson tells Frank that he's fired. One of Johnson's men steals the Audi with Valentina inside, leaving Frank to chase him down by bicycle and retrieve them both.\n\nAfter Frank and Johnson agree to call it even, Johnson sends him to [[Bucharest]], but Frank and Valentina are chased by a black [[Mercedes-Benz W211|Mercedes-Benz E-Class]] driven by Tomilenko's agents. After opening the package in the trunk, Frank realizes Valentina is the real package. She then seduces Frank by holding his car keys, resulting in them having sex. Valentina, who is revealed to be Tomilenko's daughter, explains that she was drugged in [[Ibiza, Spain|Ibiza]] and was transported by Malcolm in order for Johnson to blackmail her father.\n\nJohnson redirects him to Odessa, where he and his men surround them on a bridge. Although Valentina is delivered to Johnson and her bracelet removed, Johnson's men shoot at Frank's car. Frank drives off the bridge into the lake, fooling Johnson into believing that he is dead, but survives by using the air from the car's tires to inflate a buoying device. Aboard the train, Johnson lets Tomilenko talk to Valentina and gives him 15 minutes to sign the contract. After Tarconi and the Ukrainian police retrieve Frank and the Audi, Frank continues his chase and jumps the car on top of the train containing Johnson and his men. He takes out all of Johnson's men but cannot attack Johnson because he is too far from his car.\n\nAfter Johnson separates the train cabs, Frank jumps his car into the cab, and beats Johnson, strapping him with the bracelet and sending his car, which Johnson is restrained to, into reverse. Johnson breaks free, but is inevitably blown into pieces inside of the cab; Frank reunites with and kisses Valentina in the rubble. Upon hearing from Tarconi that Valentina is safe, Tomilenko tears up the Ecocorp contracts before heading for his business conference. The cargo ship is raided by police and sent away from Ukrainian shores.\nFrank and Tarconi return to fishing in Marseilles, still unsuccessful. Valentina, who is in the boat with them, suggests they eat out at a nearby restaurant instead.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Statham]] as [[Frank Martin (Transporter)|Frank Martin]]\n* Natalya Rudakova as Valentina Tomilenko\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]] as Inspector Tarconi\n* [[Robert Knepper]] as Jonas Johnson\n* [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as Leonid Tomilenko\n* Alex Kobold as Leonid's Aide\n* [[Katia Tchenko]] as Leonid's Secretary\n* [[David Atrakchi]] as Malcom Manville\n* {{Interlanguage link|Yann Sundberg|fr|Yann Sundberg}} as Flag\n* [[Eriq Ebouaney]] as Ice\n* David Kammenos as Driver Market\n* {{Interlanguage link|Silvio Simac|it}} as Mighty Joe\n* Oscar Relier as Thug / Driver\n* Timo Dierkes as Otto\n* Igor Koumpan as Ukrainian cop\n* Paul Barrett as Captain\n* Elef Zack as Mate\n* Michel Neugarten as Assassin Driver \u2013 Sergei\n* Farid Elquardi as Yuri\n<!-- minor characters were listed here -->\n* [[Semmy Schilt]] as the Giant\n\n==Production==\nNatalya Rudakova was spotted by Luc Besson on the street as she hurried to her job at a [[New York City]] hair salon.
