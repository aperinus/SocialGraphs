It revolves around \"present-day\" contract killers called \"loopers\" hired by criminal syndicates from the future to terminate victims whom they send back through time.\n\n''Looper'' was selected as the opening film of the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on September 28, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/looper-sets-september-2012-release-date|title=US Release Date|date=June 9, 2012|access-date=June 14, 2012|archive-date=March 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323141458/http://www.movieweb.com/news/looper-sets-september-2012-release-date|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pissedoffgeek.com/?p=5713|title=UK Release Date|date=June 27, 2012|access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref> The film  received critical acclaim and was a box office success, grossing $176 million worldwide on a $30 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- As of March 2020, this Plot section has less than 600 words. Per WP:FILMPLOT, please keep the word count below 700. -->\nIn 2044, 25-year-old Joe works for a [[Kansas City]] [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]] as an assassin, or \"looper.\" Since [[tracking system]]s in the future of 2074 have made it nearly impossible to dispose of bodies undetected, the syndicate [[time travel|sends its enemies back in time]] to be executed. Managed by a man from the future named Abe, loopers kill and dispose of victims whose faces are concealed, recovering [[Silver as an investment|silver bars]] attached to their targets as payment. To hide connections to the syndicate, any loopers who survive until 2074 are sent back and killed by their own younger selves, referred to as \"closing the loop.\" These targets are identified by [[gold bar]]s instead of silver, marking the end of the looper's contract.\n\nJoe's friend Seth confesses to Joe that he failed in an assignment to kill his future self. Old Seth has escaped, after warning Seth that a person in the future called the Rainmaker will overthrow the five major [[Boss (crime)|bosses]] and close all loops. Joe reluctantly hides Seth in his apartment's floor safe, but later reveals his location after Abe threatens to confiscate half of Joe's saved silver. Abe's elite \"Gat Men\" capture Seth, cut an address into his arm, and begin severing body parts. These effects appear on Old Seth's body; he goes to the address on his arm and is shot dead by Kid Blue, one of the Gat Men.\n\nWhen Joe's next target arrives, it is his older self, but with his face uncovered and hands unbound. Old Joe escapes before Joe can kill him. Returning to his apartment and finding it ransacked by the Gat Men, Joe fights with Kid Blue, falls off a [[fire escape]] and blacks out.\n\nIn another timeline, Joe does kill his older self. He moves to [[Shanghai]] and becomes a hitman to finance his drug addiction and wild lifestyle. Eventually, he marries and breaks the addiction with his wife's help. Seven years later, his wife is killed when Joe is taken to close the loop. Overpowering his captors, Old Joe sends himself back to 2044, [[Alternate history|altering his history]] by evading Joe and escaping.\n\nOld Joe experiences vague memories of Joe's actions in the present, and meets his younger self at a diner. He wants to alter history again and save his wife by killing the Rainmaker as a child. He acquires a map from a local library using numbers written on his hand that are supposed to pertain to the Rainmaker's identity. Kid Blue and the Gat Men appear, and a gunfight ensues. Both Joes escape, with pieces of the map.\n\nJoe follows the map to a farm where a woman named Sara lives with her young son Cid. Sara recognizes the numbers on the map as Cid's birthday and the location of the hospital where he was born. Joe guesses that Old Joe is going to kill all three children born at that hospital on the same day, not knowing which one will become the Rainmaker.\n\nJesse, a Gat Man, comes to the farm, but Cid and Joe hide. Later that night, Sara and Joe have sex, and Sara reveals that while she has slightly above-average telekinetic powers, Cid's abilities are far stronger. In the morning, Joe wakes to find Jesse holding Sara at gunpoint. Terrified, Cid kills Jesse using telekinesis. Joe realizes that Cid will become the Rainmaker and that Old Joe will now know this.\n\nKid Blue captures Old Joe and takes him to Abe. Old Joe breaks free, killing Abe and his henchmen, and goes to Sara's farm, followed by Kid Blue. While Young Joe kills Kid Blue, Old Joe pursues Sara and Cid. When Cid's face is grazed by a bullet, Sara calms him before he can react and kill anyone. She sends Cid into a sugar cane field and positions herself to block Old Joe's line of fire. Joe realizes that Cid will become the Rainmaker if Old Joe kills Sara. He [[Suicide|commits suicide]], erasing Old Joe's existence, saving Sara and potentially preventing Cid from becoming the Rainmaker.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]

about ''Looper'' and [[List of time travel science fiction|time travel in film]], Rian Johnson said:\n\n{{blockquote|Even though it's a time-travel movie, the pleasure of it doesn't come from the mass of time travel. It's not a film like ''[[Primer (film)|Primer]]'', for instance, where the big part of the enjoyment is kind of working out all the intricacies of it. For ''Looper'', I very much wanted it to be a more character-based movie that is more about how these characters dealt with the situation time travel has brought about. So the biggest challenge was figuring out how to not spend the whole movie explaining the rules and figure out how to put it out there in a way that made sense on some intuitive level for the audience; then get past it and deal with the real meat of the story.<ref name=\"Kit\"/> }}\n\nOther influences cited by Rian Johnson include ''[[The Terminator]]'', ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'', ''[[Akira (franchise)|Akira]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/rian-johnson-reddit-ama/|title=Rian Johnson Talks Working with Joseph Gordon-Levitt on LOOPER, Hollywood's Lack of Originality, Future Projects and More|first=Dave|last=Trumbore|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=September 25, 2012|access-date=November 18, 2019|archive-date=June 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619134519/http://collider.com/rian-johnson-reddit-ama/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Domu: A Child's Dream]]'',<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/interview-rian-johnson-looper/3/ |title=Roundtable Interview with Rian Johnson on Looper |work=We Got This Covered|date=September 27, 2012 |access-date=October 25, 2021}}</ref> ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'', ''[[Timecrimes]]'', and ''[[Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10f1ky/iam_rian_johnson_filmmaker/|title=r/IAmA - IAm Rian Johnson, filmmaker|website=reddit|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-date=October 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014142348/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10f1ky/iam_rian_johnson_filmmaker/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Theatrical===\n''Looper'' premiered on September 6, 2012, at the opening night of the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Vlessing|first=Elan|title=Toronto 2012: 'Looper's' Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt Bring Star Power on Opening Night|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-looper-bruce-willis-joseph-gordon-levitt-368601|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=October 4, 2012|date=September 6, 2012|archive-date=June 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621070327/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-looper-bruce-willis-joseph-gordon-levitt-368601|url-status=live}}</ref> The film was then released theatrically in the United States on {{nowrap|September 28}}, 2012<ref>{{cite news |last=McClintock |first=Pamela |title=Box Office Report: 'Hotel Transylvania' Wins Friday, Headed For Record $38 Mil-Plus Debut |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-report-hotel-transylvania-looper-joseph-gordon-levitt-pitch-perfect-wont-back-down-375153 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=October 4, 2012 |date=September 29, 2012 |archive-date=October 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003014249/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-report-hotel-transylvania-looper-joseph-gordon-levitt-pitch-perfect-wont-back-down-375153 |url-status=live }}</ref> by [[FilmDistrict]], who obtained the domestic rights from production company Endgame Entertainment at the 2011 [[Cannes Film Festival]].
