While on an assignment, Miguel Bain ([[Antonio Banderas]]), another assassin, manages to eliminate Rath\u2019s target first. Bain then reveals his plan to kill Rath and become the world\u2019s best assassin.\n\nAs Rath tries to figure out who sent Bain, his contractor offers him a lucrative job that could allow him to retire: kill a computer hacker named Electra ([[Julianne Moore]]), the four Dutch buyers of a computer disk she possesses, and to retrieve the disk. Electra has set up [[CCTV]] cameras and an elaborate mechanism for remotely moving items between rooms in the building where she is based.\n\nBain finds and kills the four Dutch buyers first, who he discovers to be [[Interpol]] agents. Rath, meanwhile spares Electra, and the two escape from Bain with the disk. Rath exchanges the disk for his fee, given to him in a briefcase, which contains a bomb placed by his contractor in an attempt to kill him. Electra then tells him she had swapped the disk, unsure if Rath would come back. Rath demands a greatly increased fee from his contractor, this time to be wired to a bank.\n\nThe contractor then hires Bain to kill Rath. Rath and Electra travel to the bank in [[Puerto Rico]], where Rath identifies the decrepit, abandoned hotel that Bain will use as a sniper post and plans a trap.\n\nAfter Bain's apparent death, Nicolai appears, revealing that he had had a bulletproof vest on when Rath shot him. Knowing that Nicolai would kill him too, Bain joins Rath in shooting him dead. Bain still plans to kill Rath and become number one. Electra puts on her sunglasses, allowing Rath to see Bain; Rath shoots through his jacket to kill him. After Bain's death, Rath and Electra leave the place, take Electra's cat and say that their true names are Joseph and Anna respectively.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Sylvester Stallone]] as Robert Rath/Joseph Rath\n*[[Antonio Banderas]] as Miguel Bain\n*[[Julianne Moore]] as Electra/Anna\n*Anatoly Davydov as Nicolai Tashlinkov\n*[[Muse Watson]] as Ketcham\n*[[Steve Kahan]] as Alan Branch\n*[[Kai Wulff]] as Remy\n*Mark Coates as Jereme Kyle\n*[[Kelly Rowan]] as Jennifer\n*[[Reed Diamond]] as Bob\n\n==Production==\nThe original [[spec screenplay]] was written by [[The Wachowskis]] and sold for $1 million to producer [[Joel Silver]] around the same time he bought their script for ''[[The Matrix]]'', also for $1 million. The script was similar to the final product, but with a more developed love story between Rath and Electra and a briefer ending without the character of Nicolai. [[Joel Silver]] offered [[Richard Donner]] $10 million to direct, but Donner insisted the script be rewritten to tone down the violence and make the central character more sympathetic and brought in [[Brian Helgeland]], who did a page one rewrite and earned a co-screenwriter credit. The Wachowskis attempted to remove their name from the film but were refused by the [[Writers Guild of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/interviews/27.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031202184946/http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/interviews/27.html|archive-date=2003-12-02|url-status = dead|title=The Lost Wachowski Brothers Interview|last=Horowitz|first=Josh|date=2003-11-05|access-date=2015-07-22}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in [[Seattle]], Washington, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/article/puerto-rico-movies|title = Puerto Rico in the Movies}}</ref> and [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref name=\"ORfilm\">{{cite web\n | url=http://library.state.or.us/repository/2015/201505210910074/2015.pdf\n | title=Filmed in Oregon 1908-2015\n | work=Oregon Film Council\n | publisher=Oregon State Library\n | access-date=December 27, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received mostly negative press,<ref>{{cite news|title= Bad Guys Win, Viewers Lose In 'Assassins'|work= Chicago Tribune |date=1995-10-06|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-06/entertainment/9510060130_1_assassins-robert-rath-movie|access-date=2010-10-01|first=Michael|last=Wilmington}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= FILM REVIEW; The Gunplay When Killers Compete|work= The New York Times |date=1995-10-06|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E04EEDE1239F935A35753C1A963958260&scp=51&sq=%22Brian%20Helgeland%22&st=cse&pagewanted=print|access-date=2010-10-01|first=Janet|last=Maslin}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Assassins|work= Chicago Sun-Times |date=1995-10-06|url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/assassins-1995|access-date=2017-10-11|first=Roger|last=Ebert}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Assassins|work= ReelViews |url= http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/assassins.html|access-date=2017-10-11|first=James|last=Berardinelli}}</ref> and on the film-critic aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] received 16% positive reviews based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 3.71/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/assassins/ |title=Assassins |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The script was heavily criticized for being confusing and dull. Stallone's performance in the film earned him a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for Worst Actor (also for ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]''), but lost the trophy to [[Pauly Shore]] for ''[[Jury Duty (film)|Jury Duty]]''.\n\nAbout the reception, Richard Donner said: \"''Assassins'', I thought Stallone did one of the best jobs he's ever done. He underplayed, he was quiet, he found the character and he went with it. I thought Antonio Banderas was wonderful. The picture came out, and it did not do very well at all. Sure, it hurts and you know why you wish it would do better? The studio gave you a lot of money and you want them to make their money back so that other people can make movies. When we made ''The Omen'', that money Alan Ladd was able to spend at Fox to do ''Star Wars''. So you feel good about that. Not only is your picture a success, but it helps other people too. Warners have been good to us and gave us money to make that movie. And I thought we did a good job and they thought we did a good job, but the audiences and critics didn't like it. Did I feel bad? Sure. Did it get me down? Nope, nope, nope \u2014 too lucky to be in this business to be down in the dumps.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2019/03/07/in-conversation-with-richard-donner-director-2006/|title = In Conversation with Richard Donner, Director (2006)|date = 7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\n''Assassins'' debuted at No. 2 at the box office.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Seven' Holds Onto Its First-Place Spot |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-10-10|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-10/entertainment/ca-55277_1_dead-presidents|access-date=2010-11-13|first=Elaine|last=Dutka}}</ref> The film grossed $30.3 million in the US and another $53 million worldwide, for a total of $83.3 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=assassins.htm|title=Assassins|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=2015-07-22}}</ref><ref name=\"numbers\"/>\n\nAudiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"CinemaScore\">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0112401|Assassins}}\n* {{mojo title|assassins|Assassins}}\n* [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/assassins_early.html Original screenplay] by the Wachowskis\n* [http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/assassins_shooting.html Screenplay revised] by Brian Helgeland\n\n{{Richard Donner}}\n{{The Wachowskis}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Assassins (1995 Film)}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 action thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s chase films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American chase films]]\n[[Category:Day of the Dead films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about contract killing]]\n[[Category:Films about snipers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Donner]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Joel Silver]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Brian Helgeland]]\n[[Category:Films set in Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Films set in Seattle]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by The Wachowskis]]\n[[Category:Silver Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Mancina]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
