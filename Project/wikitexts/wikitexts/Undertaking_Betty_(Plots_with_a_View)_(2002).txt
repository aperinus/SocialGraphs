The film began filming in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, Wales in 2002, and was released in the U.S. on 12 November 2005, with a DVD release on 7 March 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nBoris Plots is director of Plots Funeral Home in the fictional Welsh village of Wrottin Powys. His rival Frank Featherbed, an American, is determined to revolutionise the undertaking business in Britain through the innovation of \"themed funerals\".\n\nBoris dreamed of only two things as a young boy: dancing and Betty Rhys-Jones. Betty secretly loved Boris, but could not fight her father's wishes, so she was married off to a gold digger.\n\nGiving up his dreams, Boris took over the family's undertaking business. When Betty's mother-in-law dies, they are thrust together again and as they discuss the funeral arrangements for Betty's mother-in-law, the old spark is rekindled.\n\nBoris discovers that the only obstacle between their love for one another is her marriage to the adulterous Councilor Hugh Rhys-Jones. In a desperate bid for happiness Boris and Betty decide to stage her death and run away together.\n\nAt the same time, Hugh's mistress and secretary insists that they try to poison her. Before they can, Boris and Betty go through with their plan, but Frank rushes to the scene. He and Boris fight over the right to handle the funeral arrangements. After an argument and scuffle, the medical examiner said it was her dying wish to be handled by Plots.\n\nIn the church, both the mistress and Hugh talk about her, she about the affair, he gloating about inheriting all of her money. Then he insists watching while Boris seals the lid, making it impossible for Betty to sneak away.\n\nWith a lot of difficulty, Boris manages to free Betty with only Frank and his right-hand man discovering the secret. She and Boris enlist their help, after Boris and Frank agree to split the funeral business. Together they help Betty scare Hugh and the secretary (setting up the house with ghostly gadgets), who both flee.\n\nBetty also appears as a ghost to neighbor boy Billy, whose mum passed before, telling him his mum says hi, and she loves him very much. We learn Betty leaves everything to young Billy, and an allowance to Hugh if he follows a long list of conditions. The girl goes on Jerry Springer as a haunted mistress; Betty and Boris go on the Princess cruise they were planning; their cats go too.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Brenda Blethyn]] as Betty Rhys-Jones\n* [[Robert Pugh]] as Hugh Rhys-Jones\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Boris Plots\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Meredith Mainwaring\n* [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] as Delbert Butterfield\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Frank Featherbed\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was filmed on location in [[Wales]] in [[Monmouthshire]], [[South Glamorgan]], [[Vale of Glamorgan]], [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]], and [[Denbighshire]].\n\nThe dance sequences were choreographed by [[Peter Darling]] and the costumes were designed by [[Ffion Elinor]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe 2002 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' review noted its \"near-miraculous balance between the silly and the morbid\" and referred to it as \"enjoyable and entertainingly cast\" even though it was \"unlikely to bury the competition\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117919286?refcatid=31 |title=Plots With a View (U.K.) |first=Lisa |last=Nesselson |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 7, 2002 }}</ref> In 2005, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as succeeding in sustaining its \"deliberate silliness\" though it might work better for home viewing than in theatres, and described its cast as \"first rate.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-undertaking11nov11,0,4863759.story  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318040007/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-undertaking11nov11,0,4863759.story |archivedate=2006-03-18 |date=November 11, 2005 |title=''Undertaking Betty'' |first= Kevin |last=Crust |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> ''DVD Talk'' was less enthusiastic: \"though kind of a mess, and not really all that funny, ''Undertaking Betty'' still feels barely recommendable, thanks to a colorful cast of true characters.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Undertaking Betty |first=Scott |last=Weinberg | date=March 29, 2006 |publisher=DVDTalk.com |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/20888/undertaking-betty/ }}</ref> ''Reel Film'' gave it 3 of 4 stars, and described it as \"charming, low-key romantic comedy\", and though there's \"nothing especially groundbreaking or even memorable about ''Undertaking Betty,'' but the undeniably sweet vibe is ultimately quite difficult to resist.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Buena Vista's March '06 Releases - Undertaking Betty (March 15/06) |publisher=ReelFilm.com| date=March 15, 2006 | url=http://www.reelfilm.com/bvmar06.htm#under}}</ref>\n\n===Recognition===\nThe film was nominated for a Golden Hitchcock at the 2002 Dinard British Film Festival, and won a Cymru Award at the 2003 [[BAFTA Award]]s, Wales.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Amg movie|286679|Plots with a View}}\n* {{IMDb title|0298504}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|undertaking_betty}}\n* {{Letterboxd title | undertaking-betty }}\n\n{{Nick Hurran}}\n\n[[Category:2000s romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:British black comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Nick Hurran]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Rupert Gregson-Williams]]\n[[Category:British romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:2002 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
