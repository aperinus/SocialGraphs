It is loosely based on the comic book series ''[[The Extraordinary Adventures of Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec]]'' by [[Jacques Tardi]] and, as in the comic, follows the eponymous writer and a number of recurring side characters in a succession of far-fetched incidents in 1910s Paris and beyond, in this episode revolving around [[parapsychology]] and ultra-advanced [[Ancient Egyptian technology]], which both pastiche and subvert adventure and speculative fiction of the period. The primarily [[live action|live-action]] film, shot in [[Super 35]], incorporates much use of [[computer animation]] to portray its fanciful elements and contemporary [[action film]] [[special effect|special]] and [[visual effects]] within the form of the older-style adventure films they have largely superseded.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Paris]], {{circa|1912}} Professor Esp\u00e9randieu is experimenting with [[telepathy|telepathic]] techniques, and he unintentionally hatches a 136 million year-old [[pterosaur]] egg within the ''[[Galerie de pal\u00e9ontologie et d'anatomie compar\u00e9e|National Museum of Natural History]]''. This results in the death of a former [[prefect (France)|prefect]] (scandalously sharing a taxicab with a ''{{lang|fr|[[Moulin Rouge]]}}'' showgirl) which though witnessed only by the then-drunk {{lang|fr|Choupard}} sparks an epidemic of claimed sightings of the creature. The [[President of France]] orders the case be considered of utmost urgency by the [[National Police (France)|National Police]], only for it to be handed down to the bumbling Inspector Albert Caponi.\n\nAd\u00e8le Blanc-Sec, a journalist and travel writer of some fame, finds herself involved after returning from [[Egypt]], where she was searching for [[Ramesses II]]'s [[mummy|mummified]] doctor/physician Patmosis. She wants to revive the mummy with the help of Esp\u00e9randieu so the doctor can save her sister Agathe, who is comatose following an unfortunate tennis incident involving a [[hatpin]]. After a brief struggle with her nemesis, the mysterious Professor Dieuleveult, she retrieves the mummy and returns home. Her mission is complicated further by Esp\u00e9randieu being on [[death row]], having been blamed for the pterosaurs attacks, in lieu of Inspector Caponi and celebrity [[big game hunter]] Justin de Saint-Hubert having any success in taking down the beast itself. Andrej Zborowski, a researcher at the [[Jardin des Plantes]] who is enamored with Ad\u00e8le, is able to lure the pterosaur into hiding. Ad\u00e8le, riding the pterosaur, rescues Esp\u00e9randieu moments before his execution.\n\nSaint-Hubert fatally shoots the pterosaur along with Esp\u00e9randieu, but not before Esp\u00e9randieu is able to revive the mummy. The mummy reveals itself to be the [[Pharaoh]]'s [[physicist]] (\"I'm a nuclear physicist. I deal in figures, signs and equations.\") and is unable to help her sister medically. Instead he accompanies Ad\u00e8le to the [[Louvre]], where they revive the rest of the Pharaoh's mummified court on display there, including the Pharaoh himself. The Pharaoh's doctor uses their advanced medical techniques to revive Agathe. The Pharaoh then decides he wants to see Paris, so the entire court wanders out into the night, scaring the ever-hapless Choupard yet again.\n\nAd\u00e8le decides she needs a vacation to relax. As she boards the ship, the name [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] is revealed. Dieuleveult is then shown, sarcastically wishing her a \"good journey\".\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], M\u00e9nard pursues Saint-Hubert with a rifle, still outraged that Saint-Hubert shot the pterosaur. M\u00e9nard is arrested by Caponi as two [[gorilla]]s stare menacingly at Saint-Hubert.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Louise Bourgoin Cannes 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Louise Bourgoin]] at the 2010 [[Cannes Film Festival]].]] \n* [[Louise Bourgoin]] as Ad\u00e8le Blanc-Sec\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Dieuleveult\n* [[Philippe Nahon]] as Professor M\u00e9nard\n* [[Gilles Lellouche]] as Inspector Albert Caponi\n* [[Jean-Paul Rouve]] as Justin de Saint-Hubert\n* [[Jacky Nercessian]] as Professor Esp\u00e9randieu\n* [[Nicolas Giraud]] as Andrej Zborowski\n* [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Bel]] as The Bourgeois\n* [[Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre|Laure de Clermont]] as Agathe Blanc-Sec\n* [[Swann Arlaud]] as The Elys\u00e9e [[town crier|crier]]\n* Youssef Hadji as Aziz\n* [[Bernard Lanneau]] as the narrator\n\n==Production==\nThe film incorporates characters and events from several of the ''{{lang|fr|albums}}'', in particular the first, \"Ad\u00e8le and the Beast\", first published in 1976, and the fourth, 1978's \"Mummies on Parade,\"<ref name=Ghostbreakers /> within an overall plot of {{lang|fr|Besson}}'s construction and takes place primarily in [[Paris]], {{circa|1912}}.<ref name=Press />\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 85% based on reviews from 26 critics, with an average rating of 6.1/10.
