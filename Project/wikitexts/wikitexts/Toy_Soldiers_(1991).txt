It stars [[Sean Astin]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Louis Gossett Jr.]], [[Andrew Divoff]], [[Mason Adams]] and [[Denholm Elliott]].\n\nThe plot revolves around an all-male boarding school overtaken by terrorists. While the authorities remain helpless, a group of rebellious and mischievous students decide to put their resourcefulness to good use.<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CEFD91030F935A15757C0A967958260 New York Times]</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Barranquilla]], [[Colombia]], terrorist Luis Cali has taken over the [[Palace of Justice of Colombia|Palace of Justice]] with a team of [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. He demands the release of his drug kingpin father, Enrique Cali, only to learn that his father has already been extradited to the United States to stand trial. They escape by helicopter, and with the weapons and logistics assistance of Luis's second-in-command, an American named Jack Thorpe, they enter the U.S. through Mexico.\n\nIn the United States, the Regis High School is a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] for teenage boys with wealthy and influential parents, many of whom have been expelled from other schools. A group of pranksters led by Billy Tepper that includes Billy's best friend Joey Trotta, Hank Giles, Ricardo Montoya, Jonathan Bradberry, and Phil Donoghue are carefully watched over by their teachers and the stern but well-meaning Dean Parker. Phil's father is the Federal Judge presiding over Enrique Cali's trial, so the entire family is taken to a safe location as a precaution. Unaware of this, Luis Cali and his men invade the school to capture Donoghue, killing a campus police officer and a faculty member who intervenes. They set up lookout posts with heavy firearms and rig the campus with [[C-3 (explosive)|C-3 explosives]]. With Phil nowhere to be found but with the sons of numerous influential individuals in his grasp, Luis takes the entire school hostage.\n\nUnderestimating the threat, the local Sheriff attempts to intervene but is repelled by heavy weapons fire. The State Police, FBI and US Army are called in, keeping their distance to avoid provoking the terrorists. Thorpe arms the explosives with a [[detonator]] wired to a remote control gadget Luis tapes to the back of his hand. Luis warns the authorities he will set off the explosives should they attack the school. He releases the school faculty except for the cooks and the headmaster, Dr. Robert Gould, demanding his father's release in exchange for the hostages and institutes hourly headcounts.\n\nThe students, under Billy's leadership, use their expertise in skirting authority to collect tactical information about the occupying forces, which Billy covertly brings to the authorities on the outside. They won't allow Billy to return, but with Parker's encouragement, he escapes and rejoins the students just in time to be counted, preventing the killing of Gould and four students in response.\n\nJoey's father, New Jersey [[Mafia|mob]] [[Crime boss|boss]] Albert Trotta, arranges for Joey to be released. Joey, contemptuous of his father, refuses to go. He overpowers a guard, steals a [[uzi|submachine gun]] and opens fire on another terrorist, but is killed in the exchange. Luis tries to impress upon Parker, who comes to retrieve the body, that it was an accident, but Albert takes revenge by having Enrique Cali killed in prison.\n\nKnowing they must act before Luis can learn of his father's death, the authorities undertake a rescue mission. [[FBI Hostage Rescue Team]] personnel (trailed by Parker), supported by the Army and armed with the information provided by Billy, covertly infiltrate the school and begin taking out the terrorists. Meanwhile, Billy and his friends sabotage the remote control receiver for the detonator, overpower their guards and lead the students and Gould to the secret basement chamber. Overwhelmed by the assault and unable to blow up the school, Luis takes Billy at gunpoint and holds him in Gould's office. Parker and commandos converge on Luis and Billy. Luis wounds Parker, but Billy elbows him in the abdomen, giving a commando the chance to shoot Luis, killing him.\n\nWith Parker's wound bandaged, he and Billy gain a better understanding of each other. In the end, the students are freed, the surviving terrorists are arrested and Billy joyously reunites with his friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sean Astin]] as William \"Billy\" Tepper\n* [[Wil Wheaton]] as Joseph \"Joey\" Trotta\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as Dean Edward Parker\n* [[Keith Coogan]] as Jonathan \"Snuffy\" Bradberry\n* [[George Perez (actor)|George Perez]] as Ricardo \"Ricky\" Montoya\n* T.E.
