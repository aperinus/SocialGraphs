The film was dedicated to actor [[Richard Griffiths]],<ref>End credits</ref> who died a few months before the film\u2019s release, marking his final film appearance.\n\n== Plot ==\nTim Lake grows up in [[Cornwall]], in a house by the sea with his father James, mother Mary, absent-minded uncle Desmond, and free-spirited sister Katherine (\"Kit Kat\"). On his 21st birthday, Tim learns from his father that the men of his family have the ability to travel back in time to moments they have lived before. James discourages his son from using his gift to acquire money or fame, and Tim decides he will use it to improve his love life.\n\nThe following summer, Kit Kat's friend Charlotte visits. Tim is instantly smitten, but waits until the end of her stay to tell her how he feels; she tells him that he should have told her earlier. Tim travels back in time to tell Charlotte in the middle of the holiday, but she advises him to wait until her last day. Heartbroken, Tim realises she is uninterested in him, and that time travel cannot change anyone's mind. In a fit of melancholy, Tim believes that he has lost the love of his life.\n\nTim moves to London to pursue a career as a lawyer, living with his father's acquaintance, Harry, an angry misanthropic playwright. Tim visits a [[Dans le Noir]] restaurant, where he meets Mary. They flirt in the darkness, and afterward, Mary gives Tim her phone number. Tim returns home to find a distraught Harry, whose opening night of his new play has been ruined by an actor forgetting his lines. Tim goes back in time to put things right, and the play is a triumph.\n\nHowever, when Tim tries to call Mary, he discovers that by going back in time to help Harry, the evening with Mary never occurred. He recalls Mary's obsession with [[Kate Moss]], and finds Mary a week later at a Kate Moss exhibition. However, he discovers that she now has a boyfriend. Tim goes back in time having discovered when and where they met, turning up early before the potential boyfriend arrives, and persuades Mary to leave with him instead. Their relationship develops and Tim moves in with Mary. One night, he encounters Charlotte who now seems interested in him, something Tim initially seems to consider is at least partially reciprocated, but he finally turns her down upon the invitation of intimacy, realising that he is in love with Mary. He proposes; they marry and have a daughter, Posy.\n\nKit Kat's relationship struggles and drinking habits lead her to crash her car on Posy's first birthday. As Kit Kat recovers, Tim decides to intervene in her life: he prevents the crash and takes Kit Kat back in time to avert her unhappy relationship with Jimmy. They manage to return to the present, where Tim finds Posy has never been born and he has a son instead. James explains that they cannot change events prior to their children's birth and ensure that that exact child will still be conceived. Tim accepts that he cannot change his sister's life by changing her past; he allows the crash to occur, ensuring Posy's birth, and he and Mary help Kit Kat face her problems to improve her own life. She settles down with Tim's friend Jay and has a child of her own. Tim and Mary have another child, a baby boy.\n\nTim learns his father has terminal cancer and that time travel cannot change it, as going back far enough would undo his and Kit Kat's conception, and therefore his relationship with Mary, something he is unwilling to do. His father has known for some time, traveling back in time to effectively extend his life and spend more time with his family. He tells Tim to live each day twice in order to be truly happy: first, with all the everyday tensions and worries, but the second time noticing how sweet the world can be. Tim follows this advice; his father dies, but Tim travels to the past to visit whenever he misses him.\n\nMary tells Tim she wants a third child. He is reluctant because it means he will not be able to visit his father again. Tim tells his father that he cannot visit anymore, and together they travel back to relive a fond memory from Tim's early childhood, taking care not to actually change the experience to avoid causing any changes to the present. Mary gives birth to a baby girl, and Tim knows he can never see his father again. Tim comes to realise that it is better to live each day once, deciding from that point on to not time travel at all, and comes to appreciate life with his family as if he is living it for the second time.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as Tim Lake\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Mary\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as James Lake\n* [[Tom Hollander]] as Harry Chapman\n* [[Lindsay Duncan]] as Mary Lake\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as Charlotte\n* [[Lydia Wilson]] as Kit Kat\n* [[Richard Cordery]] as Uncle Desmond\n* [[Joshua McGuire]] as Rory\n* [[Tom Hughes (actor)|Tom Hughes]] as Jimmy Kincade\n* [[Vanessa Kirby]] as Joanna\n* [[Will Merrick]] as Jay\n* [[Lisa Eichhorn]] as Jean\n* [[Jenny Rainsford]] as Polly\n* [[Harry Hadden-Paton]] as Rupert\n* [[Richard Griffiths]] as Defence Lawyer in play (his final film appearance)\n* [[Richard E.

Upon admitting  he was not truly happy in life, the conversation turned towards him describing an ideal day. From here Curtis realised that the day of the lunch, for him, constituted such a day, which led to him deciding to write a film about \"how you achieve happiness in ordinary life\". Thinking that the concept was too \"simple\" he decided to add a [[time travel]] element to the film.<ref name=\"Firstshowing\"/>\n\nAlthough the production contracted out various effect houses to try to make the time travelling effects feel like more of a spectacle, they found the resulting work \"just completely wrong\" tonally and instead focused on a more low-key approach. Curtis has opined \"that in the end it turns out to be a kind of anti\u2013time travel time travel movie. It uses all the time travel stuff but without it feeling like it's a science fiction thing particularly or without it feeling that time travel can actually solve your life.\"<ref name=\"Firstshowing\"/>\n\nCurtis is primarily known as a screenwriter, and ''About Time'' was only his third ever film as a director (plus one television short); he said the film was likely to be his last film as director, but that he will continue in the film industry.<ref>{{cite web|first = Ben|last= Child|title = Richard Curtis: 'About Time will probably be the last film I direct'|date= 31 July 2013|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/31/richard-curtis-about-time-retirement|work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref>\n\n[[Zooey Deschanel]] had been in talks for the role of Mary, but ultimately, the role went to McAdams.<ref>{{cite news|date = 11 May 2012|last = Pulver|first = Andrew|title = Rachel McAdams to star in Richard Curtis romcom About Time|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/11/rachel-mcadams-richard-curtis-about-time|work = The Guardian|access-date = 11 April 2013|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Chang |first=Justin |url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/deschanel-gleeson-on-time-for-working-title-1118051976/ |title=Deschanel, Gleeson on 'Time' for Working Title|work=Variety|date=27 March 2012|access-date=8 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film's initial release date (10 May 2013) was pushed back to 1 November 2013.<ref name=\"release-date\"/> It was premiered on 8 August 2013 as part of the Film4 Summer Screen outdoor cinema series at the historic [[Somerset House]] in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/play-win/film4-summer-screen-about-time/film4-summer-screen-about-time-competition/|title=Film4 Summer Screen: About Time Competition|publisher=Channel 4|access-date=9 September 2013}}</ref> It was released in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2013.

Unlike that film, she has no knowledge of his powers in ''About Time'', resulting in a \"fundamental lack of honesty in their relationship\". Felperin noted British reverse snobbery would put many off this and other Curtis films, but that this would be less of a problem among American Anglophiles and those willing to suspend disbelief, taking the characters as British \"versions of [[Woody Allen]]'s Manhattanites (but with less angst)\". Felperin praised the chemistry of the leading couple \"that keeps the film aloft\" and the supporting cast, while also criticising the stock characters as being too familiar.<ref>{{cite news|date = 8 August 2013|first= Leslie|last=Felperin|title = Richard Curtis returns to a quintessentially English milieu with this sweet, familiar and reassuringly bland romance.|url = https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-about-time-1200575189/|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nCritics have pointed to the film's [[plot holes]] relating to [[time travel]]; how big or how many plot holes varied with the reviewer.
