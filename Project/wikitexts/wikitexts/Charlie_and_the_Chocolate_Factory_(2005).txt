The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]] and [[Freddie Highmore]] as Charlie Bucket, alongside [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Noah Taylor]], [[Missi Pyle]], [[James Fox]], [[Deep Roy]], and [[Christopher Lee]]. The storyline follows Charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by Wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory.\n\nDevelopment for a second adaptation of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' began in 1991, which resulted in [[Warner Bros.]] providing the Dahl estate with total [[artistic control]]. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as [[Gary Ross]], [[Rob Minkoff]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Tom Shadyac]] had been involved, while actors [[Bill Murray]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Will Smith]], [[Adam Sandler]], and many others, were either in discussion with or considered by the studio to play Wonka. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and [[Danny Elfman]] aboard. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' represents the first musical film directed by Burton and the first time since ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' that Elfman contributed to a film score using written songs and his vocals.\n\nFilming took place from June to December 2004 at [[Pinewood Studios]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Rather than using [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] environments, Burton primarily used built sets and practical effects, which he claimed was inspired by the book's emphasis on texture. Wonka's Chocolate Room was constructed on the [[007 Stage]] at Pinewood, complete with a faux chocolate waterfall and river. Squirrels were trained from birth for Veruca Salt's elimination. Actor Deep Roy performed each Oompa-Loompa individually rather than one performance duplicated digitally. Burton shot the film simultaneously alongside the stop-motion animated film ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', which he also directed.\n\n''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was released to positive critical reviews, with praise directed towards the visual style, set design, soundtrack, child stars, and Burton's direction. Depp's performance as Willy Wonka received a more polarized response. Although more divisive than the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|1971 film also based on Dahl's book]], Burton's film is considered to be a more faithful adaptation. ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was also a box office success,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/netflix-buys-roald-dahl-catalog.html|title=Netflix buys the entire catalog of {{'}}''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''{{'}} author Roald Dahl|date=September 22, 2021|last=Browne|first=Ryan|work=[[CNBC]]|access-date=November 5, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220602165423/https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/netflix-buys-roald-dahl-catalog.html|archive-date=June 2, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/09/23/netflix-big-roald-dahl-deal-huge-risk-wonka-depp-chalamet/?sh=3cc105226af7|title=Why Netflix's Big Roald Dahl Acquisition Is A Huge Risk|date=September 23, 2021|last=Mendelson|first=Scott|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=November 5, 2022|archive-url=https://archive.ph/FAEgh|archive-date=November 5, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> grossing US$475 million and becoming the [[2005 in film|eighth-highest-grossing film worldwide]] in 2005.

The company's owner, [[Willy Wonka]], has long closed his factory to the public due to problems concerning [[industrial espionage]], which also caused all his employees, including Charlie's [[Grandpa Joe]], to lose their jobs. Charlie's father, meanwhile, has more recently been [[layoff|laid off]] from his own job at a toothpaste factory, although he does not admit this to Charlie.\n\nOne day, Wonka announces a contest in which Golden Tickets have been placed in five random [[Wonka Bar]]s worldwide, and the winners will receive a full tour of the factory as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate, while one will receive an additional prize at the end of the tour. Wonka's sales subsequently skyrocket, and the first four tickets are found by the gluttonous [[Augustus Gloop]], the [[Spoiled child|spoiled]] [[Veruca Salt (character)|Veruca Salt]], the arrogant [[Violet Beauregarde]], and the ill-tempered [[Mike Teavee]]. Charlie tries twice to find a ticket, but both bars come up empty. After overhearing that the final ticket was found in Russia, Charlie finds a banknote and purchases a third Wonka Bar. The Russian ticket is revealed to be a forgery just as Charlie discovers the real ticket inside the wrapper. He receives monetary offers for the ticket, but the cashier warns him not to trade it regardless, and Charlie runs back home. At home, Charlie initially wants to trade the ticket for money for his family's betterment, but after a pep talk from [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Other characters|Grandpa George]], he decides to keep it and brings Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the tour.\n\nCharlie and the other ticket holders are greeted outside the factory by Wonka, who then leads them into the facility. Individual character flaws cause the other four children to give in to temptation, resulting in their elimination from the tour while Wonka's new employees, the [[Oompa-Loompa]]s, sing a song of morality after each. Meanwhile, Wonka reminisces on his troubled past and how his dentist father, Wilbur, strictly forbade him from consuming any candy. After sneaking a piece of candy, Wonka instantly became hooked and ran away from home to follow his dreams. When he returned, however, both his father and their house were gone.\n\nAfter the tour, the four eliminated children leave the factory with an exaggerated characteristic or deformity related to their elimination while Charlie learns that Wonka, now approaching retirement, intended to find a worthy heir. Since Charlie was the least ill-behaved of the five, Wonka invites Charlie to come live and work in the factory with him, provided that he leave his family behind. Charlie declines, as his family is the most important thing in his life.\n\nAs Charlie and his family's life improve, Wonka becomes despondent, causing his company and sales to decline. He eventually turns to Charlie for advice, and he decides to help Wonka reconcile with his estranged father, Wilbur. During the reunion, Charlie notices newspaper clippings of Wonka's success which Wilbur collected, while Wonka realizes the value of family as he and Wilbur finally reconcile. Afterwards, Wonka allows Charlie and his family to move into the factory together.\n\n==Cast==<!--First-billed only.-->\n* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Willy Wonka]]\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as [[Charlie Bucket]]\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as [[Grandpa Joe]]\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Other characters|Mrs. Bucket]]\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Other characters|Mr. Bucket]]\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as [[Mrs. Beauregarde]]\n* [[James Fox]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Other characters|Mr. Salt]]\n* [[Deep Roy]] as [[Oompa-Loompa]]s (with vocal work by [[Danny Elfman]])\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters#Dr. Wilbur Wonka|Dr. Wonka]]\n\nOther cast members include [[Adam Godley]] as [[List of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters|Mr. Teavee]] and [[Franziska Troegner]] as [[Mrs. Gloop]].
