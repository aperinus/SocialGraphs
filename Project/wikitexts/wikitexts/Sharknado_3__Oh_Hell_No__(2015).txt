The film was directed by [[Anthony C. Ferrante]] with [[Ian Ziering]], [[Tara Reid]], [[Cassie Scerbo]], and [[Mark McGrath]] reprising their roles from the previous installments. Also joining the cast are [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Bo Derek]], [[Ryan Newman (actress)|Ryan Newman]] (replacing [[Aubrey Peeples]] in the role of Claudia Shepard, from the first film), and [[Jack Griffo]].\n\nIrish music duo [[Jedward]] wrote and performed the film's official theme song \"Oh Hell No\", and also had a brief cameo in the film. In the film, Fin Shepard and his allies attempt to stop a group of sharknadoes that emerge along the East Coast of the United States, from [[Washington, D.C.]], to [[Florida]].\n\nThe film premiered on [[Syfy]] in the United States on July 22, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last=Petski|first=Denise|title=Syfy Sets Summer Programming Schedule|url=https://deadline.com/2015/04/syfy-summer-programming-schedule-sharknado-3-1201415186/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 23, 2015|access-date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Washington, D.C.]], Fin Shepard ([[Ian Ziering]]) attends an awards ceremony at the [[White House]], where he is given the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by the [[President of the United States|President]] for his heroic actions during the [[Sharknado|2013]] and [[Sharknado 2: The Second One|2014]] sharknadoes. When a [[tropical depression]] approaches D.C, a sharknado forms and attacks and destroys the nation's capital, killing the [[Mayor of New York City]], [[White House Chief of Staff]], and multiple [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents. Fin and the President work together to defeat the sharks, and the sharknado eventually evaporates into thin air, rather than having been taken down by force like before.\n\nWorried that his pregnant wife April ([[Tara Reid]]), who is attending [[Universal Orlando]] with their daughter Claudia ([[Ryan Newman (actress)|Ryan Newman]]) and her mother May ([[Bo Derek]]), is in danger, Fin drives down the East Coast in order to reach [[Florida]]. En route, Fin encounters a \"fognado\", which is destroyed by his former employee Nova Clarke and her partner Lucas Stevens. Nova reveals that she and Lucas have been tracking sharknado activity ever since the events in 2013. Using a mobilized RV equipped with sharknado-destroying weapons, the two have been traveling the country destroying sharknadoes and saving lives.\n\nNova and Lucas realize that the numerous storms will soon combine into a massive sharknado wall that will destroy the entire East Coast. The trio drive down to the [[Charleston Air Force Base]], where they acquire a fighter jet they'll use to get to [[Orlando]]. However, Lucas sacrifices himself in order to destroy an approaching sharknado. Nova and Fin destroy a sharknado approaching the [[Daytona International Speedway]], causing their jet to crash land in the resort at Universal. There, a sharknado kills Claudia's friend Jess while Claudia and Billy, a random stranger Claudia befriended, escape and reunite with Claudia's family.\n\nFin, April, Nova, Claudia, Billy and May take shelter in the Universal Studios Globe at the entrance of the resort, which is carried away by a sharknado, injuring May. While she is taken to the hospital, the rest of the group escape Universal and seek the help of Fin's estranged father, former NASA colonel Gil Shepard. Fin approaches him at a diner and convinces him to help him with a risky plan to destroy the storm from space. The group reaches a NASA facility outside [[Cape Canaveral]], where they plan to dissipate the storm by using a top-secret Space Shuttle to blow up large tanks of rocket fuel inside it.\n\nNova accidentally leaks to April that Fin is heading to space in the shuttle, causing her to confront him as he is getting ready to go on the flight. The sharknado wall hits the NASA facility just as takeoff is about to begin, killing Billy while he is fending off sharks with Claudia. Too late for April to return to the command center, she joins Fin and Colonel Shepard in their journey to space. Nova uses a fighter jet to create a hole in the sharknado wall, allowing the trio a clear entrance to the atmosphere. They launch into space where they detonate the external tank, but it fails to stop the wall of sharknadoes.\n\nColonel Shepard deploys \"Plan B\", activating a Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative satellite laser weapon, stranding himself in space since there is not enough fuel to propel all of them back to Earth. This time, the sharknadoes are destroyed, but the beam causes the sharks to propel into space, attacking the shuttle. Fin attempts to fight them off using an energy-beam chainsaw, but he and April are swallowed by two different sharks, which fall back down to earth. Fin and April emerge from the sharks unharmed, during which Fin discovers that April had given birth during the descent; Fin decides to name his son Gil.\n\nAs April recovers Fin's [[United States Astronaut Badge]], a piece of the shuttle debris falls back down to Earth, seemingly crushing her to death.\n\n==Cast==\n===Principal cast===\n<!-- opening credits sequence -->\n* [[Ian Ziering]] as [[Fin Shepard]]<!-- use common name, not full name Fin Allan Shepard -->\n* [[Cassie Scerbo]] as Nova Clarke, a former waitress at Fin's restaurant\n* [[Bo Derek]] as May Wexler, April's mother\n* [[Mark McGrath]] as Martin Brody, Fin's brother-in-law\n* [[Frankie Muniz]] as Lucas Stevens, Nova's partner\n* [[Ryan Newman (actress)|Ryan Newman]] as Claudia Shepard, Fin and April's daughter\n* [[Mark Cuban]] as President Marcus Robbins<ref name=\"cuban\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/page/instantawesome-cubansharknado-150302/mark-cuban-appear-sharknado-3-president-united-states|title=Mark Cuban to appear in 'Sharknado 3' ... as the president of the United States|work=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n* [[Jack Griffo]] as Billy, a guy who befriends Claudia at the theme park.\n<!-- \"With\" credit -->\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] as Gilbert Grayson Shepard, Fin's father and a former NASA colonel\n* [[Tara Reid]] as April Wexler, Fin's wife<!-- \"And\" credit at the end of the first list -->\n\n===Supporting cast===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Blair Fowler]] as Jess, Claudia's friend\n* [[Michael Winslow]] as Brian \"Jonesy\" Jones\n* Michelle Beadle as Agent Argyle\n* [[Ne-Yo]] as Agent Devoreaux\n* [[Chris Jericho]] as Bruce the [[Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit]] Team Member\n* [[Ann Coulter]] as Vice President Sonia Buck<ref name=\"cuban\"/>\n* [[Melvin Gregg]] as Chad\n* [[Christopher Judge]] as Lead Agent Model\n* [[Grant Imahara]] as Lodge\n* [[Lou Ferrigno]] as Agent [[Bruce Banner|Banner]]<ref name=\"smh\"/>\n* [[Lorenzo Lamas]] as Sergeant Rock\n* [[Kim Richards]] as Babs Jansen, a Team Member at Universal Studios Orlando {{efn|Character name from the movie [[Animal House]], in which \"Babs Jansen\" ultimately becomes a tour guide at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].}}\n* [[Benjy Bronk|Benjamin Bronk]] as a preacher\n* [[Bill Engvall]] as Gary Martin Hayes, the [[White House Chief of Staff]] \n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as Arne Sleslum\n* [[Cindy Margolis]] as Ms. Litella\n* [[Kellita Smith]] as Sergeant [[Z Nation#Main cast|Roberta Warren]] <!-- , a guard at the Charleston Air Force Base -->\n* [[Maria Menounos]] as C.J.
