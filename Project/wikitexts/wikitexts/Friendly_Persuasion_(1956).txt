It stars [[Gary Cooper]], [[Dorothy McGuire]], [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Richard Eyer]], [[Robert Middleton]], [[Phyllis Love]], [[Mark Richman]], [[Walter Catlett]] and [[Marjorie Main]]. The screenplay by [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] was adapted from the 1945 novel ''[[The Friendly Persuasion]]'' by [[Jessamyn West (writer)|Jessamyn West]]. The film tells the story of a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] family in southern [[Indiana]] during the [[American Civil War]] and the way the war tests their [[Pacifism|pacifist]] beliefs.\n\nThe film was originally released with no screenwriting [[credit (creative arts)|credit]]<ref name=\"variety\"/> because Wilson was on the [[Hollywood blacklist]].  His credit was restored in 1996.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in [[Jennings County, Indiana]], in 1862.  Jess Birdwell ([[Gary Cooper]]) is a farmer and patriarch of the Birdwell family whose Quaker religion conflicts with his love for the worldly enjoyments of music and horse racing. Jess's wife Eliza, ([[Dorothy McGuire]]) a Quaker minister, is deeply religious and steadfast in her refusal to engage in violence. Jess's daughter Mattie ([[Phyllis Love]]) wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with dashing [[cavalry]] officer Gard Jordan ([[Peter Mark Richman]]), a love that is against her mother's wishes. Jess's youngest child \"Little\" Jess ([[Richard Eyer]]) is a feisty child whose comical feud with his mother's pet [[goose]] causes her heartache. Jess's elder son Josh ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is torn between his hatred of violence and a conviction that to protect his family he must join the home guard and fight the invaders. Enoch ([[Joel Fluellen]]), a [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|runaway slave]], is a laborer on their farm; his children are still enslaved in the South.\n\nWe are introduced to the family via its youngest member, \"Little\" Jess, who is forever at war with his mother's pet goose. The story begins as an easygoing and humorous tale of Quakers trying to maintain their faith as they go to meeting on First Day (Sunday); contrasted with the Birdwells' neighbor Sam Jordan ([[Robert Middleton]]) and other members of the nearby Methodist Church. The mood shifts dramatically when the meeting is interrupted by a Union officer who asks how the Quaker men can stand by when their houses will be looted and their families terrorized by approaching [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] troops. When confronted with the question of his being afraid to fight, Josh Birdwell responds that it might be the case. His honesty provokes the wrath of Purdy, a Quaker elder who condemns people who don't believe as he does.\n\nThe film returns to its lighter tone as the Quakers try to maintain their ways, despite the temptations of amusements at a county fair, and a new organ (which Jess buys over Eliza's opposition), but one is always reminded that the [[Morgan's Raid|Confederate Army]] is drawing closer.  On a business trip, Jess acquires a new horse from the widow Hudspeth ([[Marjorie Main]]), and is finally able to defeat Sam in their weekly horse race.  One day, Jess is cultivating his fields and notices an immense cloud of smoke on the horizon produced by the burning of buildings. Josh soon arrives and tells them the neighboring community has been reduced to ash and corpses. Josh believes that he must fight, a conviction that threatens to destroy the family. Eliza tells him that by turning his back to their religion he's turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded. Meanwhile, Jess is reluctant to fight, only picking up a rifle and riding off towards the fighting when the family horse gallops back to the farm riderless.\n\nWhen Confederates arrive at the farm, with only Eliza and the younger children present, the family and the farm are saved when Eliza greets them on the porch and welcomes them to take all the food and animals they want and feeds them in their kitchen.  As Jess finds Sam Jordan dying he is bushwhacked by a \"Reb\". He plays possum and when the Confederate soldier approaches he struggles with him and takes away his gun, but ultimately lets him go free and unhurt. He then finds Josh injured and brings him home. Each member of the family faces the question of whether it is ever right to engage in violence.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as Jess Birdwell\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as Eliza Birdwell\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as Joshua \"Josh\" Birdwell\n* [[Marjorie Main]] as the widow Hudspeth\n* [[Richard Eyer]] as Little Jess Birdwell\n* [[Robert Middleton]] as Sam Jordan\n* [[Phyllis Love]] as Martha True \"Mattie\" Birdwell\n* [[Peter Mark Richman]] as Gardner \"Gard\" Jordan (credited as Mark Richman)\n* [[Walter Catlett]] as Professor Quigley\n* [[Richard Hale]] as Purdy\n* [[Joel Fluellen]] as Enoch\n* [[Theodore Newton (actor)|Theodore Newton]] as Major Harvey\n* [[John Smith (actor)|John Smith]] as Caleb Cope\n* [[Edna Skinner]] as Opal Hudspeth \n* Marjorie Durant as Pearl Hudspeth\n* Frances Farwell as Ruby Hudspeth\n*[[Tom London]] as Farmer on Front Line with Gard (uncredited)\n* [[James Dobson (actor)|James Dobson]] as Rebel soldier (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was in development for eight years; producer-director [[William Wyler]] brought the project to [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation]] (formerly known as Monogram Pictures Corporation) from [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]; Allied agreed to a $1.5 million budget for what was Wyler's first film in color for a commercial studio.  Wyler had previously shot two documentaries in color in 1944, ''[[The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]'' and the uncredited ''[[The Fighting Lady]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0036152|The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944)}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0036823|The Fighting Lady (1944)}}</ref> In 1947, he shot the documentary, ''[[Thunderbolt (1947 film)|Thunderbolt]]'', in color.<ref>{{IMDb title|0038171|Thunderbolt (1947)}}</ref>\n\nThe film's shooting location was moved from southern Indiana to a combination of a [[Republic Pictures|Republic studio]] and a San Fernando Valley estate,<ref name=\"tcm\"/> The film ended up costing over $3 million.<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite magazine| title= Friendly Persuasion | url= https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117791127/| year = 1956  | magazine= Variety | access-date= 2011-10-06}}</ref> The film went over budget to the point that Allied sold the foreign distribution rights to [[MGM]] to raise more funds.<ref>Mirisch, pp. 80-81</ref>\n\n[[Jessamyn West (writer)|Jessamyn West]] spent a year with the production as both story writer and as technical adviser (credited). Her novel covered a forty-year span of the Birdwell family history and was essentially plotless, so to make the movie effective, she arranged the sequences selected for filming around the Civil War vignette from the novel (altering it significantly for dramatic action) and compressed the whole into a single year, 1862, using the war as the central plot conflict. She created new characters (primarily the Jordans) to fill in for others that had to be deleted, and entirely wrote out Laban, the second eldest son of the novel, substituting a new character, Josh's friend Caleb Cope ([[John Smith (actor)|John Smith]]), as a two-scene surrogate. The character Mattie was a composite of the two surviving Birdwell daughters in the novel. Wyler wanted his brother, associate producer [[Robert Wyler]], and author Jessamyn West to receive credit for rewriting the script (also including Wilson), but the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]] ruled that Wilson deserved sole credit for his screenplay.\n\nCooper expressed initial reservations to West about his character, noting that since in his previous roles \"'action seems to come natural to me,' the father should be shown joining the fight. 'There comes a time in a picture of mine when the people watching expect me to do something,' he said. West responded he would do something: 'Refrain. You will furnish your public with the refreshing picture of a strong man refraining.'\"<ref name=\"tcm\"/> Cooper followed West's advice.  He researched his role by attending West's Quaker meeting, East Whittier Friends Church.  Cooper had not wanted to play the father of grown-up children, although he was 55 in real life. He supposedly disliked the finished film and his own performance.\n\nDorothy McGuire was cast as Cooper's wife after Wyler's choice, [[Katharine Hepburn]], declined.<ref>Mirisch, p. 80</ref> It was Perkins' second film, after his debut in the 1953 film ''[[The Actress]]''; his Broadway success with ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'' in the meantime tempted him to remain on the stage, though ultimately he decided to do the film.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nDuring production, cameras for the television documentary series ''[[Wide Wide World]]'' visited the set.

When William Wyler directed the film for Allied Artists in 1956 as ''Friendly Persuasion'', he had the story changed to make the Quaker youth (played by Anthony Perkins) become a killer. The Quakers in Wyler's version, as [[Pauline Kael]] observed, 'are there only to violate their convictions.' But some of the strength of Wilson's conception remains, as in a scene of a crippled Union Army officer respectfully challenging the steadfast Quakers about pacifism in their meeting house.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=McBride|first=Joseph|title=\"A Very Good American\" The undaunted artistry of blacklisted screenwriter Michael Wilson|url=http://marlowesghost.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Microsoft_Word_-_A_Very_Good_American.5371929.pdf|access-date=9 February 2013|newspaper=Written By Joseph McBride|date=February 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627000031/http://marlowesghost.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Microsoft_Word_-_A_Very_Good_American.5371929.pdf|archive-date=2013-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Ronald Reagan==\n''Friendly Persuasion'' also became a footnote to world history in the 1980s when [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] made a gift of the film to [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] at one of their five [[List of Soviet Union\u2013United States summits#Cold War (1985\u20131991)|summit meetings]], suggesting that he view the film as symbolic of the need to find an alternative to war as a means of resolving differences between peoples.  One Quaker commentator stated: \"''Friendly Persuasion'' seems to me to come about as close to truth and fairness as I expect to see Hollywood get in a treatment of Quakerism; I recommend it to every Quaker parent, as projecting images their children ought to see and imitate...I believe (critics have) woefully misjudged the film, on several counts: its place in American cinema, the characters and their roles, its historicity, and, not least, its value as an expression of the Peace Testimony. Here, for perhaps the only time, I think Ronald Reagan was closer to the truth when he commended the film to Gorbachev because it 'shows not the tragedy of war, but the problems of pacifism, the nobility of patriotism as well as the love of peace.'\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Fager|first=Chuck|title=Filming the Reputation of Truth: Quakers in the Movies|url=http://www.afriendlyletter.com/afl122.html|work=A Friendly Letter|access-date=10 February 2013|year=1991|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520133914/http://www.afriendlyletter.com/afl122.html|archive-date=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nA week before the year's Oscar nominations were announced, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|AMPAS]] Board of Governors introduced a rule denying an Oscar to anyone who refused to talk to a [[United States congressional committee]].
