The [[screenplay]] was written by Michael Browning. It was filmed on location in [[Kauai]], and released on June 12, 1998. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a moderate box-office success.\n\n== Plot ==\nRobin Monroe is a New York editor for a fashion magazine called ''Dazzle''. Her boyfriend Frank Martin surprises her with a week-long vacation in [[Makatea]], an island in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. The final leg of their journey to Makatea is in a vintage [[de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver]], piloted by a middle-aged American, Quinn Harris. They are accompanied by Quinn's young girlfriend Angelica. On their first night on the island, Frank proposes to Robin, who happily accepts. At a bar, a drunken Quinn, failing to recognize Robin, unsuccessfully hits on her.\n\nThe next morning, Robin's boss Marjorie wants her to briefly interrupt her vacation to fly to [[Tahiti]] to supervise a fashion shoot. She hires Quinn to fly her there. While en route, a sudden thunderstorm appears. The plane gets damaged by a lightning strike, forcing Quinn to crash-land on a deserted island, damaging the plane's wheel. Quinn believes they are on an island that has a signal beacon located on a high hill. If disabled, a repair crew will be sent. After climbing a high hill, they discover that in fact they are on a different island.\n\nBack on Makatea, Frank and Angelica accompany the aerial search party for their missing partners, but after several days, the search is unsuccessful and is soon called off. Frank, believing Robin is dead, gets drunk and sleeps with Angelica after she seduces him.\n\nAfter spotting a boat off the island coast, Robin and Quinn head out to it in the life raft. Discovering that there are now two vessels moored next to each other, then observing a man being killed and thrown into the water, they realize that the second vessel belongs to pirates. The pirates spot Quinn and Robin and pursue them back to the island. After briefly being captured, the two narrowly escape. While hiding in the jungle, they discover a crashed World War II Japanese float plane. They salvage the [[Float (nautical)|pontoons]] and attach them to Quinn's damaged plane in an attempt to leave the island. As they are about to take off, the pirates reappear and fire shells onto the beach, injuring Quinn. They start the plane and are able to take off. They fly over the pirates, who accidentally destroy their own boat whilst shooting at the plane.\n\nQuinn quickly instructs Robin on how to land the plane before passing out due to his injury, leaving Robin to fly it herself. Arriving at Makatea, she lands the aircraft close to the beach, where their memorial service is in progress. Frank is relieved that Robin is alive, but secretly is disgusted with himself for having slept with Angelica. Robin visits Quinn in the hospital and confesses her feelings for him, but he says their lives are too different.\n\nAs Robin and Frank are about to fly back to New York, she says she does not want to get married. Frank confesses he slept with Angelica and she reveals her feelings for Quinn. They realize they are not in love and Robin returns Frank's engagement ring.\n\nQuinn has a change of heart and rushes to the airport to find Robin, but is apparently too late. He then encounters Robin, who got off the plane before it took off and is surprised to see Quinn. Quinn confesses his feelings for her.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Quinn Harris\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Robin Monroe\n* [[David Schwimmer]] as Frank Martin\n* [[Jacqueline Obradors]] as Angelica\n* [[Temuera Morrison]] as Jager\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Marjorie\n* Douglas Weston as Philippe Sinclair\n* [[Cliff Curtis]] as Kip\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Pierce\n* [[Ben Bod\u00e9]] as Tom Marlowe\n* Derek Basco as Ricky\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as Robin's secretary\n* [[Kerry Rossall]] as Yacht Owner\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was acquired by [[Caravan Pictures]] for Disney's [[Hollywood Pictures]] as a vehicle for [[Julia Roberts]].<ref name=\"RobertsCastDays\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1995/film/features/roberts-commits-to-days-99128329/|title=  Roberts commits to 'Days'   |publisher=Variety|access-date=April 11, 2022}}</ref> Following Roberts' departure from the film, [[Anne Heche]] was cast.<ref name=\"HecheCastDays\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/heche-on-board-for-caravan-s-6-days-1117434122/|title=   Heche on board for Caravan's '6 Days'    |publisher=Variety|access-date=April 11, 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe film features stunt work with aircraft.
