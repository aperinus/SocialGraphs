The film stars [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], [[Kevin Hart]], [[Method Man]] and [[Snoop Dogg]]. Supporting actors include [[Mo'Nique]], [[Loni Love]], [[K.D. Aubert]], [[D.L. Hughley]], [[Godfrey (comedian)|Godfrey]] and [[Sof\u00eda Vergara|Sofia Vergara]]. The film revolves around multiple characters in different scenarios on board an airplane. ''Soul Plane'' garnered negative reviews from critics and grossed $14 million worldwide against a $16 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nNashawn Wade claims that he has loved planes since he was a child, but he has a horrible experience with a typical [[airline]]: his dog Dre is classified as a [[checked baggage]] instead of a [[Hand luggage|carry-on]], he eats a horrible [[airline meal]], his buttocks gets stuck in the toilet while he has [[diarrhea]], caused by his meal, during turbulence, and Dre is fatally sucked through a jet engine after a stewardess accidentally opens the cargo door.\n\nIn response to the terrible experience he endured, Nashawn sues the airline and is awarded $100,000,000 by the jury. He decides to use the money to start his own airline, called N.W.A. (Nashawn Wade Airlines), whose acronym and logo are a pop culture reference to rap group [[N.W.A]]. The airline specifically caters to African Americans and hip hop culture. The [[Airport terminal|terminal]] at the airport is called the [[Malcolm X]] terminal, where two non-working [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] Agents, Jamiqua and Shaniece, are goofing off instead of checking belongings. The plane is a heavily modified [[Boeing 747SP]], customized with low-rider [[hydraulics]], [[Spinner (wheel)|spinners]], [[Wingtip device|blended winglets]] to compensate for the drag from the decorations, and a dance club. The [[Pre-flight safety demonstration|safety video]] is also a parody of the [[Destiny's Child]] song \"[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]\".\n\nAfter taking off from [[Los Angeles International Airport]], Nashawn must deal with a multitude of problems, starting with his [[Acrophobia|acrophobic]] captain, Captain Mack. At a cruising altitude of Flight Level 330, it is revealed that he has never left the ground because he learned to fly on computer simulators in prison. Meanwhile, his cousin Muggsey sets up a miniature casino and strip joint in one of the areas of the plane (as seen in the workprint and unrated versions of the film), and Nashawn's ex-girlfriend, Giselle is on board and less than happy to see him. Meanwhile, the Hunkee family, the only caucasian passengers on board, must also deal with their own problems; Elvis' daughter Heather is turning 18 and plans to use her newfound freedom by drinking and having sex, his son has transformed from an exact duplicate of him to a stereotypical [[wigger]], and his wife has found a new interest in black men after viewing pictures in a pornographic magazine.\n\nCaptain Mack seemingly dies after eating mushrooms that the co-pilot, First Officer Gaemon, uses to soothe his [[Crab louse|genital crabs]]. Nashawn attempts to contact Gaemon, who is incapacitated after slipping near a hot tub, forcing Nashawn to attempt to land the plane himself. Nashawn lands the plane safely, using the airplane stewardess Blanca's flight knowledge which she learned while having sex in the cockpit with the pilot on another plane. The plane lands in the middle of [[Central Park]] instead of [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], and the spinners are stolen from the plane. Nashawn reconciles with Giselle after earlier revealing to her that he only broke up with her so she would not give up her college opportunities for him.\n\nThe movie ends with Nashawn telling the audience the fate of his crew. He claims that he and his ex-girlfriend are back together taking their relationship slow this time around, his cousin Muggsey has started a strip club and gambling casino located in another airplane similar to the club in Nashawn's plane, Elvis has begun a sexual relationship with Jamiqua, and his son Billy has become a major music video director but has disappeared shortly after filming a [[Michael Jackson]] video. Captain Mack later wakes up with both his chain and clothing stolen.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as Nashawn Wade\n* [[Snoop Dogg]] as Captain Antoine Mack\n* [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] as Elvis Hunkee\n* [[Method Man]] as Muggsy\n* [[K.
