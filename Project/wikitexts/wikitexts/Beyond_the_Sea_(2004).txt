Starring in the lead role and using his own singing voice for the musical numbers, [[Kevin Spacey]] co-wrote, directed, and co-produced the film, which takes its title from Darin's [[Beyond the Sea (song)|song of the same name]].\n\n''Beyond the Sea'' depicts Darin's rise to success in both the music and film industry during the 1950s and 1960s as well as his marriage to [[Sandra Dee]], portrayed by [[Kate Bosworth]].\n\nAs early as 1986, [[Barry Levinson]] intended to direct a film based on the life of Darin, and he began [[pre-production]] on the project in early 1997. When he eventually vacated the director's position, Spacey, along with Darin's son Dodd, acquired the [[film rights]].\n\nFilming for ''Beyond the Sea'' took place from November 2003 to January 2004. It was released in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and [[box-office bomb|bombed at the box office]]. Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee and former Darin manager [[Stephen Blauner|Steve Blauner]] responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey's work on the film. Despite a number of negative reviews, some critics praised Spacey's performance, largely because of his decision to use his own singing voice. He received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] nomination.\n\n==Plot==\nRather than providing a straightforward biography, the film weaves [[fantasy]] sequences with scenes containing somewhat [[fiction]]alized accounts of events in Darin's life, and throughout it, the adult singer interacts with his younger self. It chronicles his determination to rise from his working-class roots as Walden Robert Cassotto, a frail boy from [[The Bronx]] plagued by multiple bouts of [[rheumatic fever]], who becomes a singer more famous than [[Frank Sinatra]]. To achieve that goal, he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any [[nightclub]] that will hire him.\n\nHis agent gets Darin a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]], where the singer enjoys [[teen idol]] success with \"[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]\". Not wanting to limit his appeal to [[rock and roll]] audiences, he changes his niche to [[big band]] singing and recording major hits, such as \"[[Mack the Knife#Popular song|Mack the Knife]]\". To capitalize on his popularity with teenage and young adult audiences, Darin is cast in ''[[Come September]]'' opposite [[Sandra Dee]]. He falls in love with the 18-year-old actress; determined to marry her, he romantically seduces and enchants her with songs like \"[[Beyond the Sea (song)|Beyond the Sea]]\" and \"[[Dream Lover]]\".They [[elopement (marriage)|elope]], angering her mother. Darin finally realizes his own mother's dream when he is signed to appear at the famed [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana nightclub]] in [[Manhattan]].\n\nAs success takes him on the road and away from home, Dee begins to drink heavily, and the couple fights frequently. Eventually, they separate and later reconcile. She gives birth to a son, Dodd. To his actress wife's chagrin, Darin is nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance as a [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]]ed soldier in ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]''\n\nIn the late 1960s, Darin becomes involved in the campaign to elect [[Robert F. Kennedy]] for [[President of the United States|President]] and contemplates a political career of his own. His sister Nina, knowing his past will be investigated closely if Bobby opts to enter the political arena, shocks him with the news his beloved mother actually was his grandmother and that he is Nina's illegitimate child, the son of a father she cannot identify.\n\nDevastated, Darin becomes a [[recluse]] living in a trailer on the [[Big Sur]] coast in [[California]]. He finds himself out of step with changing music trends, and when he tries to adapt by incorporating [[folk music]] and [[protest song]]s into his repertoire, he finds himself rejected by the audience that once embraced him. Undaunted, he stages a show, complete with a [[gospel music|gospel]] choir, at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], and against all odds, it is a huge success.\n\nHowever, his triumph is short-lived. Suffering from [[Sepsis|blood poisoning]] following surgery to repair his mechanical [[heart valve]], Darin is rushed to the hospital, where he dies at the age of 37. Following his death, he meets the younger counterpart of himself once again, and the two duet with \"As Long as I'm Singing\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[Bobby Darin]], who rises from his lower-class roots to become one of the most popular [[rock and roll]] and [[big band]] performers of all time.\n**William Ulrich as Young Bobby.\n* [[Kate Bosworth]] as [[Sandra Dee]], the popular actress who marries Bobby. Although they divorced in 1967, Sandra said she always truly and deeply loved him and that she always would do so and thus never remarried.\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as Charlie Maffia, who serves as a [[father figure]] and considers Bobby to be his son.\n* [[John Goodman]] as [[Stephen Blauner]], Bobby's dedicated [[talent manager]].
