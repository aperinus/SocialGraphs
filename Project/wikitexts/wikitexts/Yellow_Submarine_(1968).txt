Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]. The titular Yellow Submarine rests on an [[Mesoamerican pyramids|Aztec-like pyramid]] on a hill. At the edge of the land is a range of high blue mountains.\n\nThe land falls under a surprise attack from the music-hating [[Blue Meanies (Yellow Submarine)|Blue Meanies]], who live beyond the mountains. The attack starts with a music-proof glass globe that imprisons the band. The Blue Meanies fire projectiles and drop apples (a reference to the Beatles' then-new company [[Apple Corps]])<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TP3DAAAQBAJ|title=The Encyclopedia of Musicians and Bands on Film|first1=Melissa U.

Fred takes off in the Yellow Submarine (\"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\"). He travels to [[Liverpool]] (\"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\"), where he follows a depressed [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] to \"The Pier\", a house-like building on the top of a hill, and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his mates [[John Lennon|John]], [[George Harrison|George]], and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]]. The four decide to help Old Fred, as they call him, and journey with him back to Pepperland in the submarine. As they operate the submarine, they sing \"[[All Together Now (Beatles song)|All Together Now]]\", after which they pass through several regions on their way to Pepperland, including the Sea of Time, where time flows both forwards and backwards (\"[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]\"), the Sea of Science (\"[[Only a Northern Song]]\") and the Sea of Monsters, where Ringo is rescued from monsters after being ejected from the submarine. In the Sea of Nothing, the protagonists meet [[Jeremy Hillary Boob]] Ph.D., a short and studious creature (\"[[Nowhere Man (song)|Nowhere Man]]\"). As they prepare to leave, Ringo feels sorry for the lonely Boob, and invites him to join them aboard the submarine. They arrive at the Foothills of the Headlands, where they are separated from the submarine and Old Fred (\"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\"). They then find themselves in the Sea of Holes, an expanse of flat surfaces with many holes, Ringo takes one for himself. Jeremy is kidnapped by a Blue Meanie, and the group finds their way to Pepperland.\n\nReuniting with Old Fred and reviving the Lord Mayor, they look upon the now-miserable, grey landscape. The Beatles dress up as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and steal some instruments. The four rally the land to rebellion (\"[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\"). The [[Chief Blue Meanie]] retaliates by sending out the Dreadful Flying Glove, which John defeats by singing \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\". Pepperland is restored to colour as its flowers re-bloom and its residents revive. The original Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band are released due to Ringo's hole, and join the Beatles in combating the Meanies' multi-headed dog (\"[[Hey Bulldog]]\"). Jeremy performs some \"transformation magic\" on the Chief Blue Meanie, causing the Meanie to bloom roses and sadly concede defeat. John extends an offer of friendship, and the Chief Blue Meanie has a change of heart and accepts. An enormous party ensues (\"[[It's All Too Much]]\").\n\nThe real Beatles then appear in [[live-action]], and playfully show off souvenirs from the events of the film. George has the submarine's motor, Paul has \"a little 'love',\" and Ringo has \"half a hole\" in his pocket (having apparently given the other half to Jeremy). Ringo points out John looking through a telescope, which prompts Paul to ask what he sees. John replies that \"newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre\" and claims \"there is only one way to go out... Singing!\" The four oblige with a short reprise of \"All Together Now\", which ends with translations of the song's title in various languages appearing in sequence on the screen.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[John Clive]] as [[John Lennon]]\n* [[Geoffrey Hughes (actor)|Geoffrey Hughes]] as [[Paul McCartney]]\n* Peter Batten as [[George Harrison]] ''(uncredited)''\n* [[Paul Angelis]] as Opening Narrator / [[Chief Blue Meanie]] / [[Ringo Starr]] / George Harrison ''(additional dialogue)''\n* [[Dick Emery]] as Max / Lord Mayor / [[Jeremy Hillary Boob]]\n* [[Lance Percival]] as \"Young/Old\" Fred\n\n'''<small>Sources:<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063823/fullcredits#cast Yellow Submarine (1968) \u2013 Full cast and crew<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[[Apple Corps]], 2012.</ref></small>'''\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n* According to the special features section of the ''Yellow Submarine'' home media release, Peter Batten provided the voice of George for about the first half of the film. Before he finished recording for the film, he was discovered to be a [[deserter]] from the [[British Army of the Rhine]] in [[West Germany]], and was arrested. His part was completed by Angelis, who was also the voice of Ringo and the Chief Blue Meanie.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/aug/24/artsfeatures2|last=Espiner|first=Mark|title=The Fake Four | location=London |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 August 1999|access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n* Percival also provided the voices of Paul and Ringo for the [[United States]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV cartoon series ''[[The Beatles (TV series)|The Beatles]]''.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[The Beatles]] were not enthusiastic about participating in a new motion picture, having been dissatisfied with their second feature film, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' (1965), directed by [[Richard Lester]]. However, they saw an animated film as a favourable way to complete their commitment to [[United Artists]] for a third film. Many fans have assumed that the cartoon did not satisfy the contract, but ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'' (1970) the film was not connected to the original three-picture deal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hieronimus|first1=Dr Robert|title=Inside the Yellow Submarine|year=2002|publisher=Krause|isbn=0-87349-360-5|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThe Beatles make a live-action [[cameo appearance]] in the final scene, which was filmed on 25 January 1968, shortly before the band's [[The Beatles in India|trip to India]]. This was done primarily to fulfill their contractual obligation to United Artists to actually appear in the film. The cameo was originally intended to feature a post-production psychedelic background and effects, but because of time and budget constraints, a blank, black background remained in the final film. While Starr and McCartney still looked the same as their animated counterparts, Lennon's and Harrison's physical appearances had changed by the time the cameo was shot. Both were clean-shaven, and Lennon had begun to grow his hair longer with accompanying mutton-chop [[sideburns]].\n\nThe original story was written by Lee Minoff, based on the song by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and the screenplay was penned by four collaborators including [[Erich Segal]]. George Harrison's character's recurring line \"It's all in the mind\" is taken from ''[[The Goon Show]]''.\n\nAs with many motion-picture [[Musical film|musicals]], the music takes precedence over the actual plot, and most of the story is a series of [[set piece]]s designed to present Beatles music set to various images, in a form reminiscent of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (and foreshadowing the rise of music videos and MTV thirteen years later). Nonetheless, the film still presents a modern-day [[fairy tale]] representing the values of its intended [[hippie]] audience.\n\nThe dialogue is littered with [[pun]]s, [[double entendre]]s and Beatles in-jokes. In the DVD [[Audio commentary|commentary track]], production supervisor John Coates states that many of these lines were written by Liverpudlian poet [[Roger McGough]], though he received no credit in the film.\n\nIn the DVD commentary track, Coates states that the Meanies were always intended to be coloured blue. However, Millicent McMillan recalls that the Blue Meanies were originally supposed to be red, or even purple, but when [[Heinz Edelmann]]'s assistant accidentally changed the colours, the film's characters took on a different meaning.<ref name=\"Hieronimus-hidden\">{{cite magazine | last = Hieronimus | first = Robert R. | date = 11 September 1999 | url = https://www.21stcenturyradio.com/yellowsub/billboard.html | title = The Hidden Stories Behind Yellow Submarine | magazine = Billboard | access-date = 19 April 2009}}</ref> Coates acknowledges in the commentary that the \"Are you Bluish? You don't look Bluish\" joke in the film is a pun on the then-contemporary expression \"You don't look Jewish\", but that it was not intended to be derogatory.\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe Beatles' animated personas were based on their appearance during the Sgt Pepper's press party at Brian Epstein's house, on 19 May 1967. The film also includes several references to songs not included in the soundtrack, including \"[[A Day in the Life]],\" the lyrics of which are referenced in the \"Sea of Holes\" scene; the orchestral breaks earlier in the film are also taken from the song.\n\nAmerican animators [[Robert Balser]] and [[Jack Stokes (director)|Jack Stokes]] were hired as the film's animation directors.<ref name=awn>{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Wolfe|title='Yellow Submarine' Animation Director Robert Balser Passes at 88 |url=https://www.awn.com/news/yellow-submarine-animation-director-robert-balser-passes-88 |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=6 January 2016 |access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref><ref name=thr>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes|title=Robert Balser, Animation Director on 'Yellow Submarine,' Dies at 88 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/robert-balser-dead-yellow-submarine-852980 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=7 January 2016 |access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref> Charlie Jenkins, one of the film's key creative directors, was responsible for the entire \"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\" sequence, as well as the submarine journey from Liverpool, through London, to splashdown. Jenkins also was responsible for \"Only a Northern Song\" in the Sea of Science, plus much of the multi-image sequences. A large crew of skilled animators, including (in alphabetical order) Alan Ball, [[Ron Campbell (animator)|Ron Campbell]], John Challis, Hester Coblentz, Geoff Collins, Rich Cox, Duane Crowther, Tony Cuthbert, Malcolm Draper, [[Paul Driessen (animator)|Paul Driessen]], Cam Ford, Norm Drew, Tom Halley, Dick Horne, Arthur Humberstone, Dennis Hunt, [[Greg Irons]], [[Dianne Jackson]], [[Anne Jolliffe]], Dave Livesey, Reg Lodge, Geoff Loynes, Lawrence Moorcroft, Ted Percival, Mike Pocock, [[Gerald Potterton]], and Peter Tupy, were responsible for bringing the animated Beatles to life. The background work was executed by artists under the direction of [[Alison de Vere]] and Millicent McMillan, who were both background supervisors. Ted Lewis and Chris Miles were responsible for animation cleanup.\n\n[[George Dunning]], who also worked on [[The Beatles (TV series)|the Beatles cartoon series]], was the overall director for the film, supervising over 200 artists for 11 months. \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\" was Dunning's idea, which he turned over to Bill Sewell, who delivered more than thirty minutes of [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] images. By that time, Dunning was unavailable, and Bob Balser, with the help of Arne Gustafson, edited the material to its sequence length in the film.\n\nThe animation design of ''Yellow Submarine'' has sometimes been incorrectly attributed to famous psychedelic [[pop art]] artist of the era [[Peter Max]], as his art style greatly resembles the style used in the film, but the film's art director was in fact [[Heinz Edelmann]]. Edelmann, along with such contemporaries as [[Milton Glaser]] and [[Seymour Chwast]], pioneered the psychedelic style for which Max would later become famous, but according to Edelmann and producer Al Brodax, as quoted in the book ''Inside the Yellow Submarine'' by Hieronimus and Cortner, Max had nothing to do with the production of ''Yellow Submarine''.<ref name=\"Hieronimus-inside\">{{Cite book | last1 =Hieronimus | first1 =Robert |first2=Laura |last2=Cortner | title =Inside the Yellow Submarine | year =2002 | publisher =Krause Publications | location =Iola, Wisconsin, USA | isbn =0-87349-360-5 | page =81 }}</ref>\n \nEdelmann's surreal visual style contrasts greatly with the efforts of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and other animated Hollywood films that had been previously released at the time (a fact noted by [[Pauline Kael]] in her positive review of the film<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kael|first1=Pauline|title=Going Steady|year=1970|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=9780851170053|pages=189\u2013190}}</ref>). The film uses a style of [[limited animation]]. It also paved the way for [[Terry Gilliam]]'s animations for ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (particularly the ''Eleanor Rigby'' sequence), as well as the ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'' vignettes for ABC and similar-looking animation in early seasons of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Electric Company]]''. (Only one of the animation staff of ''Yellow Submarine'', Ron Campbell, contributed subsequent animation to [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]]).\n\n=== Music ===\nIn addition to the 1966 title song \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\", several complete or excerpted songs, four previously unreleased, were used in the film. The songs included \"[[All Together Now (Beatles song)|All Together Now]]\", \"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\", \"[[It's All Too Much]]\", \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\" (which had first appeared as the [[B-side]] to \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" in June 1967), \"[[Only a Northern Song]]\" (originally recorded during sessions for ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]])'' and \"[[Hey Bulldog]]\". Written by Lennon, this last track was cut from the film before it opened in the US. \"Hey Bulldog\" was restored for the US theatrical and home video reissue in 1999. The four new songs used on the soundtrack album were not considered of high enough quality for appearance on a \"regular\" Beatles album.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe film's instrumental music was an orchestral score composed and arranged by [[George Martin]]. One of the film's cues, heard after the main title credits, was originally recorded during sessions for \"[[Good Night (Beatles song)|Good Night]]\" (a track on ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'', also known as the \"White Album\") and would have been used as the introduction to Ringo Starr's White Album composition \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\".

Released in the midst of the [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] pop culture of the 1960s, the film drew in moviegoers both for its lush, wildly creative images and its soundtrack of Beatles songs. The film was distributed worldwide by [[United Artists]] in two versions. The version shown in Europe included an extra musical number, \"Hey Bulldog\", heard in the final third of the film. For release in the United States, the number was replaced with alternative animation because of time constraints. It was felt that, at the time, American audiences would grow tired from the length of the film.\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds {{a or an|{{RT data|score}}}} approval rating based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine|title=Yellow Submarine|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access-date|df=dmy}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> The website's critical consensus states: \"A joyful, phantasmagoric blend of colorful animation and the music of the Beatles, ''Yellow Submarine'' is delightful (and occasionally melancholy) family fare.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine/ | title =Yellow Submarine (1968) | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date =29 June 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/yellow-submarine |title=Yellow Submarine Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1980 interview, [[John Lennon]] said of the film, \"I think it's a great movie, it's my favourite Beatle movie.
