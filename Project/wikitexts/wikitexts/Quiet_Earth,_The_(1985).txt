At 6:12&nbsp;a.m., the sun darkens for a moment, and a red light surrounded by darkness is briefly seen.\n\nZac Hobson is a scientist employed by Delenco, part of a United States-led international consortium working on \"Project Flashlight\" \u2013 an experiment to create a [[Wireless power transfer|wireless]] global energy grid to power military equipment. He awakens abruptly; when he turns on his radio, he is unable to receive any transmissions. He drives into the city, which he finds deserted. Investigating a fire, he discovers the burning wreckage of a passenger jet, but there are no bodies, only empty seats. Every living animal and human appears to have vanished between the ticks of a clock.\n\nZac enters his laboratory, but fails to contact any of the other labs around the world. In an underground lab, he discovers the dead body of Perrin, his superior, at the primary Flashlight Grid control panel; a monitor displays the message \"Operation Flashlight Complete\". The mass disappearance seems to coincide with the moment Flashlight was activated. The lab is suddenly and automatically sealed because of radiation, so he improvises a gas bomb to escape. He listens to his own voice on a tape recorder describing the project as having \"phenomenal destructive potential\", then notes: \"Zac Hobson, July 5th. One: there has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight with devastating results. Two: it seems I am the only person left on Earth.\" He refers to the phenomenon as \"The Effect\".\n\nAfter a week of trying to contact another human being, Zac moves into a mansion. His mental state begins to deteriorate. He puts on a woman's nightgown and alternates between exhilaration and despair. He assembles cardboard cutouts of famous people (including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Elizabeth II]], and [[Pope John Paul II]]), plays a loud fanfare and cheers from large speakers, and addresses the cutouts from a balcony. He declares himself \"President of this Quiet Earth\", then goes on a destructive rampage after the power blacks out. He bursts into a church, shoots a statue of Jesus off a crucifix, and announces that he is God. After accidentally crushing an empty [[Baby transport|pram]] with an enormous earthmover, he puts the barrel of a shotgun into his mouth, but desists. This event serves to break his insanity.\n\nZac settles into a more normal routine. One morning, a young woman named Joanne appears. Zac is attracted to her, and after a few days they have sex. They find a third survivor, a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] man named Api. The three determine why they survived: at the instant of The Effect, they were all at the moment of death: Api was being drowned during a fight, Joanne was electrocuted by a faulty hairdryer, and Zac had overdosed on pills in a suicide attempt. He had realized the experiment posed serious dangers and was guilt-ridden for not speaking out. The discovery of his body, with his lab ID and tape recorder nearby, would have the consequence of exposing Project Flashlight and ending the experiment before it was too late.\n\nA [[love triangle]] develops, but Zac is more concerned about his scientific observations: universal [[physical constant]]s are changing, causing the Sun's output to fluctuate and become highly unstable. Zac fears The Effect will occur again (and that the Sun will soon collapse in any case and obliterate the Earth) and decides to destroy the Delenco facility. Api has provided the possible answer \u2013 if the still-active Flashlight Grid is balanced, and is continually destabilizing the Sun, then knocking out the facility would make the Grid fail. The three put aside their personal conflicts and drive a truckload of explosives to the installation, only to be stopped at the perimeter when Zac detects dangerous levels of [[ionising radiation]] emanating from the plant. He says that he will go to town to retrieve a remote control device to send the truck into the facility.\n\nWhile Zac is gone, Joanne and Api have sex. Afterward, Api tells Joanne that he will sacrifice himself by driving the truck; he doubts that Zac's device will be capable of controlling the vehicle. They then hear the truck. Zac drives the truck onto the gas-bomb-weakened roof of the laboratory, which caves in. Just as the Second Effect occurs, he triggers the explosives.\n\nOnce again, a bright red light is seen surrounded by a dark tunnel. Zac awakens on a beach at [[twilight]]. There are strange cloud formations, resembling [[waterspouts]], rising out of the ocean. He walks to the water's edge, then sees an enormous [[Ring system|ringed planet]] slowly rise over the horizon. As the only survivor of this new Effect, Zac stares in confusion and despair at his unearthly surroundings.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruno Lawrence]] as Zac Hobson\n* [[Alison Routledge]] as Joanne\n* [[Pete Smith (actor)|Pete Smith]] as Api\n\n==Analysis==\nThe precise meaning of the final scene is left to the audience. In his commentary on the Umbrella Entertainment DVD release, writer/producer Sam Pillsbury states, \"...we all thought it was quite simple; I mean, our intention was just that, what happened was, he died at the moment of the effect for a second time and he's now found himself in another world, what the hell's he gonna do...\", he then says, more or less jokingly, that director Geoff Murphy being \"a Catholic or lapsed Catholic, [it] may well have been something to do with purgatory, and y'know, you being trapped in cyclical and going back into having to relive your thing until you work out your karma, [something; possibly 'if I'm not'] mixing my metaphors; anyway, enigmatic is good, I think, to a certain extent...\"\n\n==Reception==\nWalter Goodman of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"...it's easy to watch most of the time and never positively painful.\"<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE2D81539F93BA15750C0A960948260 New York Times]</ref>  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"One of New Zealand's top directors, Geoff Murphy has taken a man-alone theme and turned it imaginatively to strong and refreshing effect in ''The Quiet Earth''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1984/film/reviews/the-quiet-earth-1200426407/|title=Review: 'The Quiet Earth'|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|year=1985|access-date=16 June 2015}}</ref> Sheila Benson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Lawrence's screen presence \"electrifying\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-18/entertainment/ca-13707_1_movie-review|title=Movie Review : 'Earth,' Star Are Out of This World|last=Benson|first=Sheila|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=18 October 1985|access-date=16 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt has since become a [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/the-10-best-last-man-on-earth-movies-20130418|title=The 10 Best \"Last Man on Earth\" Movies|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=18 April 2013|access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref> In 2014, astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] named it one of his favorite [[science fiction films]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/2001-and-beyond-neil-degrasse-tyson-names-his-top-10-sci-fi-films/#/0|title='2001' and beyond: Neil deGrasse Tyson names his top 10 sci-fi films|last=Tyson|first=Neil deGrasse|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=6 June 2014|access-date=16 June 2015}}</ref> The film placed tenth in a 2014 public poll by [[Stuff.co.nz]] of the best [[New Zealand films]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/9642284/Kiwis-pick-their-favourite-movie|title=Kiwis pick their favourite movie|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|date=25 January 2014|access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0089869}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|quiet_earth}}\n* {{amg movie|39904}}\n* {{Mojo title|quietearth}}\n\n{{Geoff Murphy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quiet Earth, The}}\n[[Category:1980s disaster films]]\n[[Category:1985 independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:1985 films]]\n[[Category:1980s dystopian films]]\n[[Category:New Zealand science fiction films]]\n[[Category:New Zealand independent films]]\n[[Category:New Zealand post-apocalyptic films]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on New Zealand novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoff Murphy]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
