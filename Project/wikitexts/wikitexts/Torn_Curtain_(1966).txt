Written by [[Brian Moore (novelist)|Brian Moore]], the film is set in the [[Cold War]]. It is about an American scientist who appears to [[defector|defect]] behind the [[Iron Curtain]] to [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1965, Michael Armstrong ([[Paul Newman]]), a [[US]] physicist and [[aerospace engineering|rocket scientist]], is traveling to a conference in [[Copenhagen]] with his assistant and fianc\u00e9e, Sarah Sherman ([[Julie Andrews]]). Armstrong receives a [[Radiogram (message)|radiogram]] to pick up a book in Copenhagen; it contains a message which says, \"Contact <big>{{pi}}</big> in case of emergency.\" He tells Sherman he is going to [[Stockholm]], but she discovers he is flying to [[East Berlin]] and follows him. When they land, he is welcomed by representatives of the [[East Germany|East German]] government. Sherman realizes that Armstrong has [[defector|defected]], and is appalled that, given the circumstances of the [[Cold War]], if she stays with him, she will likely never see her home or family again.\n\nArmstrong visits a contact, a \"farmer\" ([[Mort Mills]]), where it is revealed that his defection is in fact a ruse to gain the confidence of the East German scientific establishment, in order to learn how much their chief scientist Gustav Lindt ([[Ludwig Donath]]) and by extension, the [[Soviet Union]], knows about [[Missile defense|anti-missile systems]].\n\nArmstrong has made preparations to return to the [[Western Bloc|West]] via an escape network, known as {{pi}}. However, he was followed to the farm by his appointed chaperone, Hermann Gromek ([[Wolfgang Kieling]]), an East German security officer. Gromek realizes what {{pi}} is and that Armstrong is a [[double agent]], and as Gromek is calling the [[Volkspolizei|police]], a tortuous struggle commences that ends with Gromek being killed by Armstrong and the farmer's wife ([[Carolyn Conwell]]). Gromek and his motorcycle are buried on the land. The [[taxicab]] driver ([[Eugene Weingand|Peter Lorre Jr.]], uncredited) who drove Armstrong to the farm, however, sees Armstrong's picture in the newspaper and reports him to the police.\n\nVisiting the physics faculty of [[Leipzig University|Karl Marx University]] in [[Leipzig]] the next day, Armstrong's interview with the scientists ends abruptly when he is questioned by security officials about the missing Gromek. The faculty try to interrogate Sherman about her knowledge of the American \"Gamma Five\" anti-missile program, but she refuses to cooperate and runs from the room, even though she has agreed to defect to East Germany. Armstrong catches up with her and secretly confides his actual motives, and asks her to go along with the ruse.\n\nArmstrong finally goads Professor Lindt into revealing his anti-missile equations in a fit of pique over what Lindt believes are Armstrong's mathematical mistakes. When Lindt hears over the university's loudspeaker system that Armstrong and Sherman are being sought for questioning, he realizes that he has given up his secrets while learning nothing in return. Armstrong and Sherman escape from the school with the help of the university clinic physician Dr. Koska ([[Gisela Fischer]]).\n\nThe couple travel to East Berlin, pursued by the ''[[Stasi]]'', in a decoy bus operated by the {{pi}} network, led by Mr. Jacobi ([[David Opatoshu]]). Roadblocks, highway robbery by [[Soviet Army]] deserters, and [[Bus bunching|bunching]] with the \"real\" bus result in the police becoming aware of the deception, and everyone aboard is forced to flee. While looking for the [[Friedrichstra\u00dfe]] post office, the two encounter the exiled [[Szlachta|Polish countess]] Kuczynska ([[Lila Kedrova]]) who leads them to the post office in hopes of being sponsored for a [[Visa policy of the United States|US visa]]. When they are spotted, Kuczynska trips the pursuing guard and allows Armstrong and Sherman to escape to their next destination.\n\nTwo men approach them on the pavement, one of whom is the \"farmer\". He gives them tickets to the ballet as part of a plan to smuggle them to [[Sweden]] that evening inside the ballet troupe's luggage. While attending the ballet and waiting to be picked up, they are spotted and reported to the police by the lead ballerina ([[Tamara Toumanova]]), who flew to East Berlin on the same airplane as Armstrong.\n\nArmstrong and Sherman escape through the crowd by [[Shouting fire in a crowded theater|shouting \"fire\"]]. They are hidden inside two hampers of costumes and ferried across the [[Baltic Sea]] to Sweden on an East German freighter. The ballerina, desperate to reveal the fugitives' hiding place due to subterfuge by a deckhand member of {{pi}}, identifies the wrong hampers, which are shot up by a guard with a machine gun while dangling over the pier, but Armstrong and Sherman have already escaped by jumping overboard and swimming to the Swedish dock.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Professor Michael Armstrong\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as Sarah Sherman\n* [[Lila Kedrova]] as Countess Kuczynska\n* [[Hansj\u00f6rg Felmy]] as Heinrich Gerhard\n* [[Tamara Toumanova]] as Ballerina\n* [[Wolfgang Kieling]] as Hermann Gromek\n* [[Ludwig Donath]] as Professor Gustav Lindt\n* [[G\u00fcnter Strack]] as Professor Karl Manfred\n* [[David Opatoshu]] as Mr. Jacobi\n* [[Gisela Fischer]] as Dr. Koska\n* [[Mort Mills]] as Farmer\n* [[Carolyn Conwell]] as Farmer's Wife\n* [[Arthur Gould-Porter]] as Freddy, the Bookseller\n* Gloria Gorvin as Fr\u00e4ulein Mann\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Background===\nBy the time  ''Torn Curtain'', his fiftieth film, was conceived, Hitchcock was the most famous film director in Hollywood, having already reached the pinnacle of commercial success six years before with ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960). Audiences eagerly anticipated his next film. To find a gripping plot, Hitchcock turned towards the spy thriller genre, which was greatly in fashion since the early 1960s  with the success of the [[James Bond]] series starting in 1962 with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 657\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 657</ref> Hitchcock had already found success in that genre many times, most recently in 1959 with ''[[North by Northwest]]''.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 657\"/>\n\nThe idea behind ''Torn Curtain'' came from the [[defection]] of British diplomats [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1951.<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 659\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 659</ref> Hitchcock was particularly intrigued about Maclean's life in the [[Soviet Union]] and about Melinda Marling, Maclean's wife, who followed her husband behind the [[Iron Curtain]] a year later with the couple's three children.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 659\"/> With these facts as a starting point Hitchcock created a plot line involving an American nuclear physicist, Professor Michael Armstrong, defecting to [[East Germany]].<ref name = \"Maxford 264\">Maxford, ''The A - Z of Hitchcock'', p. 264</ref> Against his will, the physicist is followed to [[East Berlin]] by his fianc\u00e9e and assistant, who decides to remain loyal to him regardless of his intentions. The twist of the story is that Professor Armstrong is in fact a member of a secret [[spy ring]] and he has defected only with the idea of stealing a formula from an East German scientist.<ref name=\"Maxford 264\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nIn autumn 1964, Hitchcock offered to let [[Vladimir Nabokov]], the author of ''[[Lolita]]'', who had successfully helped adapt his own novel to a well-regarded [[Lolita (1962 film)|film]] directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]] in 1962, write the script.<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 658\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 658</ref> Although intrigued, Nabokov declined the project, feeling that he knew very little about a [[political thriller]].<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 661\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 661</ref>\n\nAs the original focus of the plot was on the female lead, the spy's girlfriend, the script was commissioned early in 1965 to Irish-Canadian writer [[Brian Moore (novelist)|Brian Moore]], who was known for successfully tackling female characters.<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 665\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 665</ref><ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 662\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 662</ref> His well-regarded first novel, ''[[Judith Hearne]]'', centers on an alcoholic [[Belfast]] spinster. In addition to this, Moore had adapted his own novel ''[[The Luck of Ginger Coffey (novel)|The Luck of Ginger Coffey]]'' into a [[The Luck of Ginger Coffey (film)|film]] the previous year.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 662\"/> Moore moved to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to work on the script. His five-page synopsis, completed on 26 March 1965, already contained two key scenes of the film: ''Torn Curtain'''s opening aboard a cruise steamer in the Norwegian fjords, and the brutal killing of undercover agent Gromek by the American scientist and a farm woman.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 662\"/> Moore's final draft, completed by June 21, pleased neither Hitchcock nor Universal. It lacked the humor and sparkle characteristic of a Hitchcock film. On his part, Moore complained that Hitchcock had \"no concept of character\"<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 663\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 663</ref> and that he had \"a profound ignorance of human motivation\".<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 663\"/> Brian Moore's own dissatisfaction with the project was reflected in his novel ''Fergus'' ([[1970 in literature|1970]]), which features Bernard Boweri, an unsympathetic character based on Hitchcock.<ref name = \" Busby 32\">Busby, ''Character Parts: Who's Really Who in CanLit'', p. 32</ref>\n\nTo polish the dialogue and improve the script, Hitchcock hired British authors [[Keith Waterhouse]] and [[Willis Hall]], known for their screenplays for ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (film)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'' (1961), ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' (1962), and ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' (1963), the latter based on the novel by Waterhouse.<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 669\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 669</ref> They worked rewriting some dialogue, on a day-by-day basis, as the film was shot.<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 670\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 670</ref> However, their contribution was restricted by the director's resistance to change and concern for detail. His notes to them were like these: \"Scene 88. We should eliminate the floor concierge. My information is that they do not have these in [[East Berlin]];<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 669\"/>\nScene 127 C. I would like to discuss the place where the sausage is carved;<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 669\"/> On Scene 139, where we had someone describing the Julie Andrews character as beautiful... do you think beautiful is perhaps too much, and cannot we say lovely instead?\"<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 669\"/>\n\nSubmitted to arbitration, the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] gave sole script credits to [[Brian Moore (novelist)|Brian Moore]].<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 671\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 671</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nHitchcock had to compromise in his casting choices. Initially, he wanted [[Eva Marie Saint]], the blonde star of ''[[North by Northwest]]'',  for the female lead. Hitchcock also spoke in 1965 to [[Cary Grant]] about appearing in the film, only to learn that Grant intended to make [[Walk, Don't Run|just one more film]] and then retire.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 663\"/> \nHitchcock had wanted English actress [[Samantha Eggar]] for the lead female role.\nUniversal Pictures executives insisted on famous stars being cast for the leads.  Paul Newman and Julie Andrews were imposed on Hitchcock by [[Lew Wasserman]], the studio executive, rather than being his real choices.<ref name = \"Maxford 265\">Maxford, ''The A - Z of Hitchcock'', p. 265</ref> The director felt that the stars were ill-suited to their roles, while their salaries of $750,000 took a big part of the film's $5 million budget.<ref name=\"Maxford 265\"/>\nAt the time Julie Andrews was Hollywood's biggest star after the back-to-back successes of her films ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964)  and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965).<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 663\"/> As she was much in demand, Andrews was only available for a short period of time, and that meant that the production of the film was rushed, although Hitchcock was not yet satisfied with the script.\n\nHitchcock surrounded Newman and Andrews with colorful supporting actors: [[Lila Kedrova]], fresh from winning an Academy Award for ''[[Zorba the Greek (film)|Zorba the Greek]]'',  as the eccentric and flamboyantly dressed Countess Kuczynska who helps Armstrong and Sherman in their escape in return for their sponsoring her to go to America; [[Tamara Toumanova]] as the haughty prima ballerina whose limelight Armstrong steals when he arrives in East Berlin; [[Ludwig Donath]] as the crotchety professor Lindt, eager  to cut the chat and get down to business; and [[Wolfgang Kieling]] as the sinister Hermann Gromek, the gum-chewing personal guide the East German authorities provide to shadow Armstrong's every move.\n\n===Filming===\nHitchcock initially wanted to shoot the film entirely on location in the [[Eastern Bloc]] but could not because he refused to give East German officials a copy of his screen play. Moore later said that Hitchcock probably could have secured filming permits in East Germany, [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] if he had tried harder.<ref>{{Cite web|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/18571-TORN-CURTAIN?cxt=filmography|access-date=2021-10-02|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref> Principal photography of the film began on 18 October 1965, on Stage 18 at the Universal back lot in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 672\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 672</ref> The shooting schedule lasted three months, including a two-week hiatus while Paul Newman recuperated from a chin infection.<ref name = \" Mc Gilligan 673\">Mc Gilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 673</ref> Filming was completed in mid-February 1966.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 673\"/>\n\nAlthough unexcited about his leading actress, Hitchcock was always very polite with Julie Andrews.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 672\"/> About her experience making the film Andrews commented: \"I did not have to act in ''Torn Curtain''. I merely went along for the ride. I don't feel that  the part demanded much of me, other than to look glamorous, which Mr Hitchcock can always arrange better than anyone. I did have reservations about this film, but I wasn't agonized by it. The kick of it was working for Hitchcock. That's what I did it for, and that's what I got out of it.\"<ref name = \"Maxford 31\">Maxford, ''The A - Z of Hitchcock'', p. 31</ref>\n\nThe working relationship between Hitchcock and Newman was problematic.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 672\"/> Newman came from a different generation of actors from the likes of [[Cary Grant]] and [[James Stewart]]. He questioned Hitchcock about the script and the characterization throughout filming. Hitchcock later said he found Newman's manner and approach unacceptable and disrespectful. Newman insisted that he meant no disrespect toward Hitchcock, and once said, \"I think Hitch and I could have really hit it off, but the script kept getting in the way.\" When Newman, a [[method acting|Method]] actor, consulted Hitchcock about his character's motivations, the director replied: \"motivation is your salary.\" Furthermore, as Hitchcock discovered, the expected onscreen chemistry between Newman and Andrews failed to materialize.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 672\"/>\n\nUnsatisfied with the actors cast in the leads, Hitchcock shifted the point of view of the plot from the defecting scientist's wife to the American amateur spy and he centered his attention in the colorful international actors who played supporting roles in the film.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 665\"/> Lila Kedrova was Hitchcock's favorite among the cast; he ate lunch with her several times during filming and invited her home for dinners with his wife.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 665\"/> Although the length of the film was shortened in post-production, Hitchcock left intact Countess Kuczynska's scenes in the final film.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 665\"/>\n\nThe film's climax in a theater was filmed on Sound Stage 28 at Universal Studios. Stage 28 was also used in the 1925 and 1943 versions of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' with [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]], 41 years earlier. The set was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://variety.com/2014/artisans/news/universal-to-demolish-phantom-of-the-opera-soundstage-but-preserve-silent-films-set-1201292227/ |title=Universal to Demolish 'Phantom of the Opera' Soundstage, But Preserve Silent Film's Set |first=Ted |last=Johnson |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=27 August 2014 |issn=0042-2738 |access-date=10 December 2017 |archive-date=22 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120545/http://variety.com/2014/artisans/news/universal-to-demolish-phantom-of-the-opera-soundstage-but-preserve-silent-films-set-1201292227/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the best-known scene is the fight to the death between Armstrong and Gromek, a gruesome, prolonged struggle. In conversation with [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], Hitchcock said that he included the scene to show the audience how difficult it can be to kill a man, because a number of spy thrillers at the time made killing look effortless.<ref name = \"Maxford 266\">Maxford, ''The A - Z of Hitchcock'', p. 266</ref>\n\n[[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In ''Torn Curtain'' he can be seen (eight minutes into the film) sitting in a hotel lobby holding a baby.\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]] told [[James Lipton]] on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' that as a young man he sneaked onto the soundstage to observe the filming, and remained for 45 minutes before an assistant producer asked him to leave.\n\nThe production occurred during the [[Watts riots|1965 Watts race riots]], leaving Kieling disgusted with [[Society of the United States|American society]]. As a result, after the film was released he defected to East Germany in real life, calling the United States \"the most dangerous enemy of humanity in the world today\" and guilty of \"crimes against the [[Negro]] and the people of [[Vietnam]].\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kurlansky|first=Mark|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53929433|title=1968 : the year that rocked the world|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|year=2004|isbn=0-345-45581-9|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=53929433}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe film had two scores. The first was written by [[Bernard Herrmann]], a recurrent contributor to Hitchcock's work. Hitchcock and Universal asked Herrmann for a pop-and-jazz-influenced soundtrack, and even hoped Herrmann might write a song for lead actress Julie Andrews to perform. However, the score Herrmann provided was not what Hitchcock and the studio wanted, and his revisions failed to satisfy them. Hitchcock and Herrmann ended their long-time collaboration and [[John Addison]] was approached to write the score.\n\nAlthough the Addison score was issued commercially in 1966 (and has been re-released), the Herrmann score has been re-recorded and reissued several times, eclipsing that by Addison in terms of available versions. Recordings of Herrmann's original studio sessions exist, and have circulated online. [[Elmer Bernstein]] made the first commercial recording of the score with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] on [[Warner Brothers Records]] in 1978. [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] recorded a suite from the film as part of a Herrmann album with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1996. [[Joel McNeely]] subsequently recorded an expanded version with the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] for [[Varese Sarabande Records]] in 2010.\n\nIn the climactic scene involving the ballet at the East Berlin theatre, the music was excerpted from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Tchaikovsky)|Francesca da Rimini]]''.\n\n==Release==\n''Torn Curtain'' was released without any rating on 14 July 1966 (see original 1966 movie poster above). However, the film was given an \"R\" (for \"Restricted\") under the [[MPAA film rating system]] that took effect November 1, 1968. It was ultimately re-rated PG in 1984.\n\n==Reception==\nAfter its premiere in 1966, the film was criticized, especially in terms of its production technology, as being old-fashioned. The film was nevertheless a minor hit for Hitchcock, making $7 million in the United States alone.<ref name=\"Maxford 266\"/> The film ranked 8th on [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma]]'s [[Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's Annual Top 10 Lists|Top 10 Films of the Year List]] in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|title=Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951-2009|last=Johnson|first=Eric C.|website=alumnus.caltech.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327102838/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html|archive-date=2012-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe film earned poor reviews from critics. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a pathetically undistinguished spy picture, and the obvious reason is that the script is a collection of what Mr. Hitchcock most eschews\u2014clich\u00e9s.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |authorlink=Bosley Crowther|date=July 28, 1966 |title=Screen: 'Torn Curtain' At 3 Theaters |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=23 }}</ref> [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]], writing for ''[[Sight & Sound]]'', commented: \"What went wrong here, one suspects, was something basic in the story line.\"<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 675\">McGilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock'', p. 675</ref>  The reviewer in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said: \"Some good plot ideas are marred by routine dialogue, and a too relaxed pace contributed to a dull overlength,\" adding \"Hitchcock freshens up his bag of tricks in a good potpourri which becomes a bit stale though a noticeable lack of zip and pacing.\"<ref name=\"Maxford 266\"/> \"Awful,\" \"preposterous,\" and \"irritating slack,\" concluded [[Renata Adler]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 675\"/> ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, \"Up until about the point at which the plot makes itself clear, ''Torn Curtain'' is as good as anything Hitchcock has ever done in his other forty-nine (or is it fifty-one?) films ... The let-down comes with the verdant studio hillock that was surely never meant to fool anyone, and after this the film drops like a stone, without impetus, without imagination, without interest.\"<ref>{{cite journal |date=September 1966 |title=Torn Curtain |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=33 |issue=392 |page=139 }}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Schickel]], writing in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', concluded: \"Hitchcock is tired to the point where what once seemed highly personal style is now repetitions of past triumphs.\"<ref name=\" Mc Gilligan 675\"/>\n\nWriting in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', Richard Mallet asserted: \"The film as a whole may be a bit diffuse... but it has some brilliant scenes, it's pleasing to the eye, and it is continuously entertaining.\"<ref name=\"Maxford 266\"/> [[Richard L. Coe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also liked the film, writing that \"Hitchcock has given us several sequences that will prove memorable.\" He singled out Countess Kuzynska's search for a sponsor for her escape to the United States as a sequence that stood as \"a short story in itself. It could be shown independently of the rest of the film, a gripping vignette with a beginning, a middle and an end.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Coe |first=Richard L. |date=July 28, 1966 |title='Torn Curtain' Just Ripping |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A31 }}</ref>\n\n''Torn Curtain'' holds a 65% rating on [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 31 reviews with an average rating of 6.4/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/torn_curtain/ |title=Torn Curtain|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=May 23, 2022|archive-date=October 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011060909/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/torn_curtain/?search=Torn%20C|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1966]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Busby, Brian.
