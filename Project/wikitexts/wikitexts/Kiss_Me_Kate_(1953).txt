Lois Lane arrives to audition for the Bianca role (\"Too Darn Hot\"). Lilli decides against performing the lead of \u201cKatherine\u201d, opposite Fred in the male lead of Petruchio, as she is leaving to marry a rich Texas rancher. She changes her mind when Cole and Fred manipulate her by offering Lois the lead role.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |title=Kiss Me, Kate - PLOT SYNOPSIS |url=https://www.themusicallyrics.com/k/514-kiss-me-kate-2019-musical-lyrics/7198-plot-synopsis.html |access-date=2022-05-03 |website=www.themusicallyrics.com}}</ref>\n\nLois' boyfriend, Bill Calhoun, is playing Lucentio in the play. He leads a gambling lifestyle, which results in owing a local gangster $2,000, but he has signed the [[IOU (debt)|IOU]] in Fred's name. Lois laments his bad-boy lifestyle (\"Why Can't You Behave?\").\n\nAfter a fiery confrontation during rehearsals, Fred and Lilli get together in her dressing room and reminisce about happier times (\"Wunderbar\"). Fred later sends flowers and a card to Lois, but his butler mistakenly gives them to Lilli. Lilli is overcome by this romantic gesture and fails to read the card (\"So In Love (Reprise)\").\n\nThe play opens, with Fred, Lilli, Lois and Bill performing an opening number (\"We Open In Venice\"). In the play, Bianca, the younger daughter of Baptista, wishes to marry, but her father will not allow it until his elder daughter, Katherine, is married.  Bianca has three suitors \u2013 Gremio, Hortensio and Lucentio \u2013 and each of them try to win her over. She is prepared to marry anyone (\"...any Tom, Dick or Harry...\").\n\nPetruchio arrives, seeking a wife (\"I've Come To Wive It Wealthily In Padua\"), and when he hears of Katherine, he resolves to woo her.  Katherine hates the idea of getting married (\"I Hate Men\"). When Petruchio serenades Katherine (\"Were Thine That Special Face\"), Lilli finally reads the card from the flowers. She sees that it is addressed to Lois, and attacks Fred/Petruchio on stage, ad-libbing verbal abuse.  As the curtain comes down, Fred spanks Lilli/Kate. Backstage, Lilli phones her fianc\u00e9, Tex, to come and immediately pick her up.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLippy and Slug, a pair of thugs, arrive to collect from Fred. Fred asks them to keep Lilli from leaving the show so it will be successful enough for Fred to pay the debt.  Lois has learned that Fred has taken responsibility for the IOU and she comes to thank him, but each time she begins to thank him for not being angry about Bill forging his name, Fred kisses her to prevent Lippy and Slug from learning about his deception. Lilli and Bill walk in on the scene and become furious.\n\nIn order to keep Lilli from leaving, Slug and Lippy appear on stage, disguised as Petruchio's servants. They have no acting ability, but still manage to amuse the audience. Petruchio sets about \"taming the shrew\", but later reminisces about his days of philandering (\"Where Is The Life That Late I Led?\").\n\nDuring the play's intermission, when Tex arrives to rescue Lilli from the theatre, he is recognized by Lois, an old flame. When Bill is angered by Lois' behavior, she admits that though she loves Bill, she cannot resist the advances of other men (\"Always True To You In My Fashion\").\n\nThe gambling debt is cancelled by the untimely death of Slug and Lippy's boss, so they stop interfering with Lilli's mid-performance departure from the theatre. Fred tells her that she truly belongs in theatre, and also reveals his true feelings for her. She departs, leaving a dejected Fred to be cheered up by Slug and Lippy (\"Brush Up Your Shakespeare\").\n\nBianca marries Lucentio. The rejected suitors, Gremio and Hortensio, meet two new girls (\"From This Moment On\"). At the finale, the show is temporarily halted when Lilli's understudy goes missing. Suddenly, Lilli reappears on stage, delivering Kate's speech about how women should surrender to their husbands (\"I'm Ashamed That Women Are So Simple\"). Fred is bowled over, and the play reaches its triumphant finale (\"Kiss Me Kate\"), with Fred and Lilli back together as a real couple.\n\n==Cast==<!--- opening credits order --->\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Kathryn Grayson]] as Lilli Vanessi / \"Katherine (Kate)\"\n* [[Howard Keel]] as Fred Graham / \"Petruchio\"\n* [[Ann Miller]] as Lois Lane / \"Bianca\"\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Lippy\n* [[Bobby Van (actor)|Bobby Van]] as \"Gremio\"\n* [[Tommy Rall]] as Bill Calhoun / \"Lucentio\"\n* [[James Whitmore]] as Slug\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Kurt Kasznar]] as \"Baptista\"\n* [[Bob Fosse]] as \"Hortensio\"\n* [[Ron Randell]] as Cole Porter\n* [[Willard Parker]] as Tex Calloway\n* [[Ann Codee]] as Suzanne, Lili's maid\n* [[Claud Allister]] as Paul, Fred's valet\n* [[Dave O'Brien (actor)|Dave O'Brien]] as Ralph, the Stage Manager\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n*Lilli's understudy, Jeanie, is mentioned several times, but never appears.\n*In the stage musical, Lilli's fianc\u00e9 is a domineering up-and-coming politician named General Harrison Howle.
