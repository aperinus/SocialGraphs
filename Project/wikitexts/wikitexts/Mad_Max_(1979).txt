[[Mel Gibson]] stars as [[Max Rockatansky|\"Mad\" Max Rockatansky]], a police officer turned vigilante in a near-future Australia in the midst of [[societal collapse]]. [[Joanne Samuel]], [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]], [[Steve Bisley]], Tim Burns, and [[Roger Ward]] also star. James McCausland and Miller wrote the screenplay from a story by Miller and Kennedy.\n\n[[Principal photography]] for ''Mad Max'' took place in and around [[Melbourne]] and lasted for six weeks. The film initially received a polarized reception upon its release in April 1979, although it won four [[AACTA Awards]]. Filmed on a budget of A$400,000, it earned more than US$100 million worldwide in gross revenue and set a ''[[Guinness Record Book|Guinness]]'' record for most profitable film. The success of ''Mad Max'' has been credited{{by whom|date=February 2021}} for further opening up the global market to [[Australian New Wave]] films.\n\nThe film became the first in the [[Mad Max|''Mad Max'' series]], giving rise to three sequels: ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (1981), ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome|Beyond Thunderdome]]'' (1985), and ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road|Fury Road]]'' (2015). In 2020, a fifth film, to be titled ''[[Furiosa (film)|Furiosa]]'', was announced.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words. Words such as \"realise\", \"recognise\", or anything that relates to Australian English should NOT be changed to their American or British English versions without viewing the WP:ENGVAR guidelines. -->\nIn a near-future [[dystopia]]n Australia that is facing a breakdown of civil order primarily due to widespread oil shortages, [[Berserker|berserk]] [[motorbike gang]] member Crawford \"Nightrider\" Montazano kills a rookie officer of the poorly-funded Main Force Patrol (MFP)\u2014one of the last remaining law enforcement agencies\u2014and escapes with his girlfriend in the dead officer's [[Pursuit Special]]. Nightrider is able to elude the MFP until the organization's top pursuit man, [[Max Rockatansky]], manages to break his concentration and steer him into a roadblock, resulting in a fiery crash that kills both Nightrider and his girlfriend.\n\nAt the MFP garage, Max is shown his new police car: a specially-built [[Supercharger|supercharged]] [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered black Pursuit Special. A conversation between Max's superior, Captain Fred \"Fifi\" Macaffee, and Police Commissioner Labatouche reveals the Pursuit Special was authorised to bribe Max, who is becoming weary of police work, into staying on the force.\n\nNightrider's motorbike gang, which is led by Toecutter and Bubba Zanetti, run riot in a town, vandalising property, stealing fuel, and terrorising the populace. A young couple attempts to escape, but the gang destroys their car and rapes them. Max and fellow officer Jim \"Goose\" Rains arrest Toecutter's young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Johnny the Boy, at the scene. No witnesses appear in court and Johnny is deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, however, so, against Goose's furious objections, he is released into Bubba's custody.\n\nWhile Goose visits a nightclub in the city that night, Johnny sabotages his police motorbike, causing it to lock up at high speed the next day and launch Goose off the road. Dazed, but uninjured, Goose borrows a [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] to haul his bike back to MFP headquarters. On the way, Johnny throws a [[drum brake|brake drum]] through his windshield, and he crashes again. Toecutter urges, and then forces, a reluctant Johnny to throw a match into the wreck of the ute, burning Goose alive.\n\nAfter seeing Goose's charred body in the hospital [[Intensive care unit|ICU]], Max informs Fifi that he is resigning from the MFP to save what is left of his sanity. Fifi convinces him to take some time off and think it over, so Max goes on a trip in his [[Panel van#Australia|panel van]] with his wife, Jessie, and infant son, \"Sprog\" (Australian slang for a child). When they stop to fix the spare tire, Jessie takes Sprog to get ice cream and is molested by Toecutter and his gang. She escapes, and the family flees to a remote farm owned by an elderly friend named May Swaisey. The gang follows and chases Jessie through the woods, and they capture Sprog while Max is off looking for them. May helps Jessie free the boy and the trio escapes in the van, but it soon breaks down. Jessie grabs Sprog and runs down the road until the gang catches up and runs them over. Sprog is killed instantly, while a comatose Jessie is brought to the ICU, where she is expected to succumb to her injuries.\n\nDriven into a rage by the loss of his family, Max dons his police uniform and takes the black Pursuit Special without authorization to pursue and eliminate the gang. He kills several gang members before being caught in a trap set by Toecutter, Bubba and Johnny. Bubba shoots Max in the leg and drives over his arm before Max is able to shoot Bubba with a [[sawn-off shotgun]]. Toecutter and Johnny ride away, and Max staggers to his car and chases Toecutter, whom he forces into the path of an approaching [[semi-truck]].\n\nAfter a long search, Max finds Johnny stealing boots from a dead motorist. Ignoring Johnny's desperate pleas that he did not kill the man and he is not responsible for what happened to Max's family due to his diagnosed [[psychopathy]], Max handcuffs Johnny's ankle to the corpse's overturned vehicle and creates a crude time-delay fuse utilizing leaking petroleum and Johnny's lighter. He gives Johnny a hacksaw, saying Johnny can either try to saw through the handcuffs, which will take ten minutes, or his ankle, which will take five minutes, in order to survive. The vehicle explodes soon after Max drives away. Now a shell of his former self, Max blankly heads off to points unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- in the same order as the film's end credits (which are alphabetical after the first 6) -->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Max Rockatansky]], an officer of the Main Force Patrol (MFP)\n* [[Joanne Samuel]] as Jessie Rockatansky, Max's wife\n* [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as Toecutter, the leader of a motorcycle gang\n* [[Steve Bisley]] as Jim \"Goose\" Rains, a member of the MFP's motorcycle unit\n* Tim Burns as Johnny the Boy, a young member of Toecutter's gang\n* [[Roger Ward]] as Fred \"Fifi\" Macaffee, Max's MFP captain\n* David Bracks as Mudguts, a member of Toecutter's gang\n* David Cameron as Underground Mechanic, who builds the V-8 Pursuit Special\n* Robina Chaffey as Singer, who performs at the Sugartown Cabaret\n* Stephen Clark as Sarse, an MFP officer (Scuttle's partner)\n* [[Reg Evans]] as Station Master\n* Max Fairchild as Benno, May's large adult son, who has an [[intellectual disability]]\n* [[Sheila Florance|Sheila Florence]] as May Swaisey, an old friend of Max\n* Hunter Gibb as Lair, a man with a Chevvy who is attacked by Toecutter's gang\n* [[Vincent Gil]] as Crawford \"The Nightrider\" Montazano, a member of Toecutter's gang\n* [[Jonathan Hardy]] as Police Commissioner Labatouche, who oversees the MFP\n* Brendan Heath as \"Sprog\" Rockatansky, Max and Jessie's infant son\n* Paul Johnstone as Cundalini, a member of Toecutter's gang who loses a hand\n* [[Nico Lathouris|Nick Lathouris]] as Grease Rat, a mechanic near a beach\n* John Ley as Charlie, a religious MFP officer (Roop's partner)\n* Steve Millichamp as Roop, an MFP officer (Charlie's partner)\n* George Novak as Scuttle, an MFP officer (Sarse's partner)\n* [[Geoff Parry]] as Bubba Zanetti, Toecutter's second in command\n* [[Lulu Pinkus]] as Nightrider's Girl\n* Kim Sullivan as Girl in Chevvy, who, along with Lair, is attacked by Toecutter's gang\n* Karen Moregold as Radio Dispatcher (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] was a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|medical doctor]] in [[Sydney]], working in a hospital [[Emergency department|emergency room]] where he saw many injuries and deaths of the types depicted in the film. He also witnessed many car accidents growing up in rural [[Queensland]] and lost at least three friends to accidents as a teenager.<ref name=\"miller\">Scott Murray & Peter Beilby, \"George Miller: Director\", ''Cinema Papers'', May\u2013June 1979 p369-371</ref>\n\nWhile in residency at a Sydney hospital, Miller met amateur filmmaker [[Byron Kennedy]] at a summer film school in 1971. The two men produced a [[short film]], ''Violence in the Cinema, Part 1'', which was screened at a number of [[film festival]]s and won several awards. Eight years later, they produced ''Mad Max'', working with first-time [[screenwriter]] James McCausland (who appears early in the film as the bearded man in an apron in front of the diner).\n\nAccording to Miller, his interest while writing ''Mad Max'' was \"a [[Silent film|silent movie]] with sound\", employing highly kinetic images reminiscent of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]] while the narrative itself was basic and simple. Miller believed that audiences would find his violent story more believable if set in a bleak dystopian future.<ref name=aso/> He knew little about writing a script, but he had read [[Pauline Kael]]\u2019s essay \"[[Raising Kane]]\" and concluded that most major American scriptwriters, like [[Herman J. Mankiewicz|Herman Mankiewicz]] and [[Ben Hecht]], were former journalists, so he hired McCausland, the Melbourne finance editor of ''[[The Australian]]'', with whom he had previously bonded at a party as a fellow film buff. McCausland was paid roughly $3,500 for about a year\u2019s worth of writing.\n\nThe basic concept for the film was already established when McCausland was brought on to the project. He worked from a one-page outline prepared by Miller, writing each evening from about 7pm to midnight. Miller would then arrive at 6am to confer on the pages. McCausland had never written a script before and did no formal or informal study in preparation, other than going repeatedly to the cinema with Miller and discussing the dramatic structure of westerns, road movies, and action films. McCausland described taking the lead in writing the dialogue, while Miller was concerned with giving his thoughts on the narrative context of each part and thinking through the visual beats of how things would unfold on screen. The ornate and hyper-verbal speech of Mad Max\u2019s villains, like the manic Nightrider in the opening sequence, which would recur through the subsequent films in the franchise, in this sense stems from McCausland\u2019s work, albeit under Miller\u2019s instruction.<ref>[https://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/eserv/rmit:162968/Douglas.pdf The Kennedy Miller Method: A Half-Century of Australian Screen Production] pages 105-107</ref> McCausland drew heavily from his observations of the effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]] on Australian motorists:\n\n{{blockquote|Yet there were further signs of the desperate measures individuals would take to ensure mobility.

An apocryphal tale stated that Gibson went to auditions with a beat-up face following a fight, but this has been denied by both Matthews and Miller. Gibson's friend and classmate [[Steve Bisley]], who had worked with him in his only previous screen role, 1976's ''[[Summer City]]'', was cast as Max's partner Jim Goose.

The only lens that worked properly was a 35mm lens, which Miller employed to shoot the whole of ''Mad Max''.<ref name=aso/>\n\n===Post-production===\nThe film's post-production was done at a friend's apartment in North Melbourne, with Miller and Kennedy editing the film in the small lounge room on a home-built editing machine that Kennedy's father, an engineer, had designed for them. Miller and Kennedy also performed [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editing]] there. Tony Patterson spent four months editing the film, then had to leave because he was contracted to work on ''[[Dimboola (1979 film)|Dimboola]]'' (1979). George Miller took over editing with [[Clifford Hayes|Cliff Hayes]], and they worked for an additional three months. Kennedy and Miller did the final cut,<ref name=\"kennedy\"/> in a process Miller described as \"he would cut sound in the lounge room and I\u2019d cut picture in the kitchen.\"\n\nProfessional sound engineer [[Roger Savage]] performed the sound mixing in a studio after finishing his work for [[Little River Band]].

AIP also altered the operator's duty call on Jim Goose's bike in the beginning of the film (it ended with \"Come on, Goose, where are you?\"). The only exceptions to the dubbing were the singer in the Sugartown Cabaret (played by Robina Chaffey), Charlie (played by John Ley) when he speaks through the mechanical voice box, and Goose ([[Steve Bisley]]) when he sings while driving the truck before being ambushed. Since Mel Gibson was not well known to American audiences at the time, trailers and television spots in the United States emphasised the film's action content. The original Australian dialogue track was finally released in [[North America]] in 2000 in a [[Limited release|limited theatrical reissue]] by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] (the film's rights holders at the time), and the film has since been released in the U.S. on DVD with the American and Australian soundtracks included on separate audio tracks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zad|first1=Martie|title=Gibson's Voice Returns on New 'Mad Max' DVD|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-29-et-zad29-story.html|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=14 May 2015|date=29 December 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/30657/Mad-Max/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102085410/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/30657/Mad-Max/overview|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 November 2007|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Robert Firsching|date=2007|title=Mad Max (1979)|access-date=17 July 2011}}</ref> In 2021, North American rights to ''Mad Max'' reverted to Warner Bros., so WB now fully owns all four films in the ''Mad Max'' series everywhere except for Australia and New Zealand.\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on DVD on 1 January 2002 and re-released on DVD on 15 September 2015.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Mad Max DVD Release Date|url=https://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/3830/Mad-Max-(1979).html|access-date=27 October 2020|website=DVDs Release Dates|language=en}}</ref> It was released on [[Blu-ray]] on 5 October 2010 and re-released on Blu-ray on 15 September 2015 by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Kino Lorber]] (on behalf of [[Warner Bros.

In a 1979 review, the Australian [[Social commentary|social commentator]] and film producer [[Phillip Adams (writer)|Phillip Adams]] condemned ''Mad Max'', saying that it had \"all the emotional uplift of ''[[Mein Kampf]]''{{-\"}} and would be \"a special favourite of rapists, sadists, child murderers and incipient [[Charles Manson|Mansons]]\".<ref>Phillip Adams, ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', 1 May 1979; cited by [http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=5602&s=reviews ''urban cinefile'', 2010, \"Mad Max\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909052215/http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=5602&s=reviews |date=9 September 2018 }}.
