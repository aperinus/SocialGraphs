It is the sequel to 2000's ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' and the second installment in the [[Charlie's Angels (franchise)|''Charlie's Angels'' film series]], which is a continuation of the story that began with the television series of the [[Charlie's Angels|same name]] by [[Ivan Goff]] and [[Ben Roberts (writer)|Ben Roberts]].\n\nIn an [[ensemble cast]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Lucy Liu]] reprise their roles as the three women working for the Townsend Agency. [[Crispin Glover]], [[Matt LeBlanc]] and [[Luke Wilson]] also reprise their roles from the first film. It also features [[Justin Theroux]], [[Demi Moore]] and [[Bernie Mac]] as [[John Bosley (Charlie's Angels)|John Bosley]]'s adoptive brother while [[Robert Patrick]], [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[John Cleese]] and [[Ja'net DuBois]] appear in supporting roles. [[Jaclyn Smith]] reprised her role as [[Kelly Garrett (Charlie's Angels)|Kelly Garrett]] from the original series for a cameo appearance. [[John Forsythe]] also reprised his role as Charlie's voice from the series and previous film for the last time. It was his final film role before his retirement in 2006 and his death in 2010.\n\nIt was released in the United States on June 27, 2003 by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] under its [[Columbia Pictures]] label and was number one at the box office for that weekend, also making a worldwide total of $259.2{{nbsp}}million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.sympatico.msn.ca/movies/galleries/MovieGallery.aspx?cp-documentid=17240697&imageindex=16 |title=Take 1: Movie firsts that changed cinema forever |author=Jonathan Crocker |publisher=MSN Movies |access-date=June 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228035025/http://entertainment.sympatico.msn.ca/movies/galleries/MovieGallery.aspx?cp-documentid=17240697&imageindex=16 |archive-date=February 28, 2009}}</ref> Like its predecessor, the film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the performances of Diaz, Barrymore and Liu, but criticism aimed at the \"bland plot and lack of sense\".\n\n==Plot==\nAfter rescuing U.S. Marshal Ray Carter in Mongolia, the Angels: Natalie Cook, Dylan Sanders, and Alex Munday together with John Bosley's adoptive brother Jimmy Bosley are sent to recover [[titanium]] rings stolen from the [[United States Department of Justice]] that can display the people listed in the witness protection program. DOJ official William Rose Bailey and a protected witness, Alan Caulfield are among those killed. At Caulfield's house in [[San Bernardino]], the Angels track his assassin Randy Emmers to a beach where they meet former Angel Madison Lee. During the Coal Bowl motorcycle race, Emmers targets another witness named Max Petroni, but is killed by the Thin Man because he was protecting Max. Inside Emmers' pocket, the Angels discover the photos of Caulfield, Max, and, surprisingly, Dylan, under her birth name, Helen Zaas.\n\nDylan reveals that she is a protected witness after sending her former boyfriend, Irish mob leader Seamus O'Grady to prison. O'Grady has since targeted those who wronged him; including Dylan and Max, whose parents O'Grady killed. Max is sent to the home of Bosley's mother for his protection. At a monastery, the Angels learn about the Thin Man's past from the Mother Superior, who reveals his name, Anthony. Afterwards, the Angels track O'Grady's mob at [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] and manage to get the rings, but O'Grady threatens Dylan with the murder of everyone she loves. Natalie attends her boyfriend, Pete Kominsky's high school reunion at [[Hermosa Beach, California|Hermosa Beach]], where she overhears his friends implying he might propose, which she feels is too fast since they just moved in together. Alex returns home while Dylan leaves the Angels and heads to Mexico. When Natalie, Bosley, and Alex notice the letter she left for them, they realize that Dylan fled to protect them. Natalie asks Charlie how O'Grady got out of jail, and Charlie reveals someone had him released on good behaviour. While hiding out in Mexico, Dylan is convinced to return after seeing an apparition of former Angel Kelly Garrett.\n\nNatalie and Alex deduce that Carter is the one who let O'Grady out of prison after seeing him return Bosley's keys without any pain, despite claiming to have broken his ribs beforehand. Following him, the two witness him killed by Madison, the true mastermind. Though Dylan arrives to back the group, the Angels are shot by Madison, who takes the rings, though they survived via [[Kevlar vest]]s. Back at the base, Charlie reprimands Madison for what she's done and confronts her for endangering her former teammates' lives. Madison responds by shooting the speaker and blowing him off. The Angels realize that Madison is going to sell the rings to the O'Grady Crime Family, the Antonioni Mafia, the Tanaka Yakuza, and the Diablo Cartel at the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], where Jason's film premiere is about to commence.\n\nThe Angels arrange for the buyers to be arrested by the FBI while they confront Madison and O'Grady. The O'Gradys enter the melee, having avoided arrest when Seamus realized the Angels' plan. The Thin Man comes to the Angels' aid, helping Alex and rescuing Dylan when she is being attacked by O'Grady - he begins to fight O'Grady and kicks him off the roof. The Thin Man grabs Dylan and chokes her at first, but they ended up sharing a kiss and he pulls some of Dylan's hair out. Just as he is about to say something, O'Grady stabs him and he falls off the roof. O'Grady nearly succeeds in killing Dylan as well, but she blinds him, causing him to lose his footing and fall to his death (in the unrated cut, O'Grady is still alive and attempts to get back up but is stopped by The Thin Man, who also survived; Dylan accidentally knocks over the \"E\" sign and it falls on O'Grady, possibly The Thin Man as well). The Angels fight Madison all the way to an abandoned theatre, where they kick her into a chamber filled with gas and she fires her gun, inadvertently blowing herself up.\n\nThe Angels attend the premiere, where they learn that Mama Bosley is adopting Max. Peter surprises Natalie by asking her to get a puppy (the big question he was planning on asking her) and Alex terminates her \"time out\" with Jason. The Angels celebrate their victory together with Bosley.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Natalie Cook\n* [[Drew Barrymore]] as Dylan Sanders / Helen Zaas\n* [[Lucy Liu]] as Alex Munday\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Madison Lee, a former Angel turned independent operative\n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Jimmy Bosley, successor and adoptive brother of [[John Bosley (Charlie's Angels)|John Bosley]]\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Seamus O'Grady, Dylan's ex-boyfriend and head of the O'Grady Irish Mob\n* [[Crispin Glover]] as the Thin Man / Anthony, a mysterious assassin\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Randy Emmers, a surfer assassin hired by Madison\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Ray Carter, a corrupt Director of the U.S. Marshals Service\n* [[John Forsythe]] as the voice of Charles 'Charlie' Townsend, the owner of the Townsend agency\n* [[Matt LeBlanc]] as Jason Gibbons, Alex's boyfriend\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Pete Komisky, Natalie's boyfriend\n* [[John Cleese]] as Mr. Munday, Alex's father\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Max Petroni, an orphaned teenager targeted by the mob after his testimony\n* [[Ja'net DuBois]] as Momma Bosley, Jimmy's biological mother and [[John Bosley (Charlie's Angels)|John Bosley]]'s adoptive mother\n\n;Cameos\n* [[Jaclyn Smith]] as [[Kelly Garrett (Charlie's Angels)|Kelly Garrett]], one of the original Angels\n* [[Bruce Willis]] as William Rose Bailey, Justice Department official murdered by Emmers\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Roger Wixon, Director of the FBI\n* [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] as the Coal Bowl M.C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0051302/ |title=Pink to Write Her Own Movie |date=December 8, 2004 |access-date=2009-06-05}}</ref>\n* [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]] and [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] as the future Angels from Dylan's imagination \n* [[Ed Robertson]] as the sheriff\n* [[Wayne Federman]] and [[Steve Hytner]] as high school reunion buddies in the bathroom\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as a woman at crime scene.
