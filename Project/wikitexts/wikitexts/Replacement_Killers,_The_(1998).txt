The film was released in the United States on February 6, 1998. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Ken Sanzel. Veteran action director [[John Woo]] co-produced and choreographed the action sequences. The film is set in modern-day [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and follows an emotionally disillusioned assassin who is forced to settle a violent vendetta for a ruthless crime boss. The film marks the American acting debut for Chow, as his previous film credits included [[Hong Kong action cinema]] only.\n\nThe film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Brillstein Entertainment Partners|Brillstein-Grey Entertainment]], and WCG Entertainment Productions. ''The Replacement Killers'' explores assassination, violence and the influence of [[Triad (underground society)|triads]] in modern society.<ref name=\"film\">[[Antoine Fuqua]] (Director). (1998).

United States: [[Columbia Pictures]].</ref> The film score was orchestrated by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]]; the soundtrack was released by the [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] music label on March 10, 1998.\n\n''The Replacement Killers'' premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on February 6, 1998, grossing $19.2 million in US ticket receipts and $39.5 million worldwide from a $30 million budget. The film was screened at 1,936 theaters during its widest release in cinemas.  It has a 38% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and a consensus of \"mixed reviews\" on [[Metacritic]]. The widescreen [[DVD]] edition of the film featured scene selections, a featurette, and interviews among other highlights, and was released in the United States on July 1, 1998.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring an orchestrated drug bust at a marine loading dock, [[Los Angeles Police]] Detective Stan Zedkov kills [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] lieutenant Peter Wei. Looking to exact revenge for his son's death, Peter's crime boss father Terence Wei sends for professional [[assassin]] John Lee. Paying off an old debt, Lee has already killed two targets for Wei, and the crime boss tells him that this third and final job will settle the [[obligation]]. However, Lee's [[conscience]] prevents him from completing his final assignment: to murder Zedkov's seven-year-old son Stevie before the detective's eyes. Realizing that his actions will result in [[retaliation]] against his mother and sister, Lee prepares to return to [[China]], enlisting the help of old friend Alan Chan, a monk in a local [[Buddhist]] temple, to make arrangements to have his family moved to a secure location. Infuriated by Lee's disobedience, Wei orders his head lieutenant, Michael Kogan, to lead the hunt for Lee, and has his people in China begin the search for Lee's family.\n\nNo longer able to use the Triad network to get out of the country, Lee searches for alternative means outside Wei's sphere of influence, and looks to skilled [[forger]] Meg Coburn for a new [[passport]]. Before she can finish the job, Wei's men storm her office, destroying the computerized tools of her trade in the ensuing shootout. Lee escapes; Coburn is picked up by the police, unsuccessfully interrogated by Zedkov, and released as bait so the detective can see who tries to kill her. Meanwhile, Wei hires skilled out-of-town [[contract killing|professional hitmen]] named Ryker and Collins to take over the hunt for Lee and the Zedkov contract.\n\nLee finds Coburn when she returns to her destroyed office. Having been made aware that the Triads are involved, Coburn wants out, but Lee forces her to finish her original task of creating a forged passport. Traveling with Coburn, with the two replacement killers, in pursuit, Lee gets pictures from a photo booth and phones Alan, who offers the use of his passport. When Lee arrives at the temple, he discovers that Alan has been tortured to the point of death. Alan tells Lee that his family was moved to [[Guangzhou|Canton]]\u2014but he told his torturers they were in Shanghai.<ref name=\"film\"/> Lee has little more than 24 hours before his family is found. The monk gives Lee his passport before dying in his arms.\n\nHoled up in a hotel, Coburn finishes altering Allan's passport for Lee. The two exchange stories, and Coburn becomes sympathetic to Lee. Feeling compelled to stop the killing of Zedkov's son before leaving the country, Lee forces one of Wei's men to reveal the plan, which is to kill Stevie while he and his father are at a cartoon festival in a movie theater. Lee and Coburn, who insists on helping, arrive barely in time to prevent Ryker and Collins from killing the boy, and Ryker is killed by Lee in the subsequent gunfight.\n\nConcerned that Lee and Coburn will make their way back to Wei's base of operations, the crime boss makes plans to flee the country and hunt down Lee's mother and sister himself. However, when two guards open the main gate for Wei and his entourage to leave in a limo, Lee is just outside and launches a two-handed handgun assault. Coburn surfaces moments later, driving a truck through the melee, incapacitating Michael Kogan, and later killing him. When Collins fires from a high perch on Lee and Coburn, Lee soon outflanks him, killing him from behind. Finally, Lee corners Wei on a fire escape platform. Though both men have emptied their guns, Lee is first to reload. Wei promises Lee that the boy and Lee's family will still die, but Lee replies, \"Not in your lifetime,\" and kills him. Though Zedkov arrives before Lee and Coburn can get away, he lets them go, taking only their guns.\n\nCoburn reluctantly bids goodbye to Lee at the [[airport]], presenting him with one last gift, passports for his mother and sister.<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as John Lee\n* [[Mira Sorvino]] as Meg Coburn\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Detective Stan \"Zeedo\" Zedkov\n* [[Kenneth Tsang]] as Terence Wei\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Michael Kogan\n* [[Til Schweiger]] as Ryker\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Collins\n* [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]] as \"Loco\"\n* [[Carlos G\u00f3mez (actor)|Carlos Gomez]] as Detective Hunt\n* Frank Medrano as Eddie Rawlins\n* Carlos Leon as Romero\n* Leo Lee as Lam\n* [[Patrick Kilpatrick]] as Pryce\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as Alan Chan\n* Andrew J.

Retrieved 2012-07-05.</ref> In ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', Walter Addiego perceived that the film \"remains a counterfeit of a Woo movie, even though Woo himself co-produced it. He turned the directing chores over to first-timer Antoine Fuqua, whose previous work was limited to music videos and commercials, and it shows.\" He added, \"The script, by Ken Sanzel, is the work of someone who's seen Woo's movies and wasn't particularly moved by the experience.\"<ref>Addiego, Walter (6 February 1998).

It was great because Chow Yun-Fat is the coolest guy in the world. He was just beautiful. Mira Sorvino was cool. It was fun working with Mira. But the difficult thing was learning the studio system, learning all the things that go along with that system. There are a lot of people that have a lot of say, especially when you're that young in the studio world. You learn that it is a business. I think for me, what I learned was I still love making movies, and I know what I don't want to do. The thing that I learned the most out of that movie was what I don't want to do.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/607359/jake-gyllenhaal-and-antoine-fuqua-on-filming-the-guilty-using-unorthodox-pandemic-methods-interview/|title = Jake Gyllenhaal and Antoine Fuqua on Filming the Guilty Using Unorthodox Pandemic Methods &#91;Interview&#93;|date = 17 September 2021}}</ref>\n\nKen Sanzel, who wrote the movie, said: \"The script bears very little resemblance to anything I would have written; only the bare bones of the plot really survived. I think that Chow Yun-Fat was incredible, but for me the movie was a series of otherwise bad decisions. I\u2019m glad that people enjoy it, but it was really Antoine Fuqua\u2019s sensibility top to bottom, which is not at all mine (aside from the fact that we both love the work of Michael Mann, though apparently for very different reasons).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.actionreloaded.com/interview-director-ken-sanzel/|title = *Interview* Director Ken Sanzel|date = 14 April 2021}}</ref>\n\nMira Sorvino said: \"I loved working with Antoine, and it was fun to do an action movie. It was kind of like being a kid and playing cowboys and Indians, or cops and robbers. And I enjoyed the role of Meg. I thought she was fun to do.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/mira-sorvino-1798228602|title = Mira Sorvino|website = [[The A.V.
