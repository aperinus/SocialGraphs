Leslie is the classic hero archetype \u2013 always dressed in white, handsome, ever-courteous, enormously talented and successful. Leslie's nemesis, Fate, is the traditional melodramatic villain \u2013 usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at almost everyone, possessing a maniacal evil laugh, filled with grandiose plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure. Leslie proposes an automobile race from New York City to Paris and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey.  They design and build a new car for him, \"The Leslie Special\". Fate builds his own car, \"The Hannibal Twin-8\", complete with hidden devices of sabotage. Other car owners enter the race, including one owned by New York City's most prominent newspaper. Driving the newspaper's car is beautiful photojournalist Maggie DuBois, a vocal [[suffragist]].\n\nA seven-car race begins, but Fate's long-suffering sidekick Maximilian Meen has sabotaged four other cars (and his own, by mistake), leaving just three cars in the race. The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal valet Hezekiah Sturdy, Maggie DuBois driving a [[Stanley Motor Carriage Company|Stanley Steamer]] by herself, and Fate and Max. The steamer car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special. Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Boracho.<ref>A misspelling of the Spanish word ''Borracho'' (drunk).</ref> A local outlaw named \"Texas Jack\" becomes jealous of the attraction to Leslie shown by showgirl Lily Olay and a saloon brawl ensues. Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest. Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and \"wanted to go back to New York\".\n\nThe two remaining cars reach the [[Bering Strait]] and park side by side in a blinding snowstorm. Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors. Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate's car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie's car. They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who in turn casts off Maggie for deceiving him. Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead.\n\nAfter driving across Asia, both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Carpania, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Friedrich Hapnick is the [[look-alike|spitting image]] of Professor Fate. Plotters under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe and General Kuhster kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie. Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others. Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom. Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe's henchmen and confront Von Stuppe.  Following a climactic sword fight with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it. Leslie and Max return the real Prince to the capital in time to defeat Kuhster's plan for a military coup. Fate, still masquerading as Prince Hapnick, takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake.  A [[pie fight]] ensues involving the racers, the Prince's men and the conspirators. The five racers, covered in pie filling, depart Carpania with King Friedrich's best wishes.\n\nAs the racers leave Pottsdorf (with Maggie now back in Leslie's car), it becomes a straight road race to Paris. Nearing Paris, Leslie and Maggie have a spirited argument regarding the roles of men, women and sex in relationships. Leslie stops his car just short of the finish line under the [[Eiffel Tower]] to prove that he loves Maggie more than he cares about winning the race. Fate drives past to claim the winner's mantle, but becomes indignant that Leslie let him win. Fate demands a rematch: a race back to New York.\n\nThe return race commences, with newlyweds Leslie and Maggie now a team. Fate lets them start first, then attempts to destroy their car with a small cannon. The shot misses the Leslie Special, instead knocking down the Eiffel Tower.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Professor Fate and Prince Friedrich Hapnick\n* [[Tony Curtis]] as The Great Leslie\n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Maggie DuBois\n* [[Peter Falk]] as Maximillian (\"Max\")\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Hezekiah Sturdy\n* [[Arthur O'Connell]] as Henry Goodbody\n* [[Vivian Vance]] as Hester Goodbody\n* [[Dorothy Provine]] as Lily Olay\n* [[Larry Storch]] as Texas Jack\n* [[Ross Martin]] as Baron Rolf von Stuppe\n* [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] as the Mayor of Boracho\n* [[Denver Pyle]] as the Sheriff of Boracho\n* [[Marvin Kaplan]] as Frisbee\n* [[George Macready]] as General Kuhster\n* [[Joyce Nizzari]] as Woman in West\n* Ken Wales as Baron's Guard\n* [[William Bryant (actor)|William Bryant]] as Baron's Guard\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Themes==\nDirector [[Blake Edwards]] based the film on the [[1908 New York to Paris Race]], very loosely interpreted. On February 12, 1908, the \"Greatest Auto Race\" began with six entrants, starting in New York City and racing westward across three continents. The destination was Paris, making it the first around-the-world automobile race. Only the approximate race route and the general time period were borrowed by Edwards in his effort to make \"the funniest comedy ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movie-gurus.com/content/reviews//945/|title=Movie Gurus \u2013 The Movie Review Community|website=movie-gurus.com}}</ref>\n\nEdwards, a studious admirer of [[silent film]], dedicated the film to film comedians [[Laurel and Hardy]].<ref name=Wasson2009/> ''The Great Race'' incorporated a great many silent era visual gags, along with slapstick, double entendres, parodies, and absurdities.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> The film includes such time-worn scenes as a barroom brawl, the tent of the desert sheik, a sword fight, and the laboratory of the [[mad scientist]]. The unintended consequences of Professor Fate's order,\"Push the button, Max!\" is a running gag, along with the spotless invulnerability of The Great Leslie.<ref name=Wasson2009>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWr3jPbVVDkC&pg=PT98 |pages=98\u2013108 |last=Wasson |first=Sam |title=A splurch in the kisser: the movies of Blake Edwards |chapter=The Great Race (1965) |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8195-6915-8 |series=Wesleyan Film}}</ref>\n\nEdwards poked fun at later films and literature as well. The saloon brawl scene was a parody of the [[Western (genre)|western]] film genre, and a plot detour launched during the final third of the film was a direct parody of the novel ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' and of the [[The Prisoner of Zenda (1937 film)|1937 film version of the story]], where a traveler is a lookalike for the king and stands in for him.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\n==Production==\nBecause of the success of Edwards' previous films ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[A Shot in the Dark (1964 film)|A Shot in the Dark]]'', the film's budget started at $6&nbsp;million. [[Mirisch Company|Mirisch Productions]] initially financed the film for [[United Artists]]. The film's escalating costs led UA to drop the film, but the project was picked up by Warner Brothers.<ref>p.239 Mirisch, Walter ''I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History''  Univ of Wisconsin Press, 27/02/2008</ref>\n\nEdwards wanted [[Robert Wagner]] to play the leading man, but studio executive [[Jack L. Warner]] insisted on Tony Curtis, possibly because of Wood's recent divorce from Wagner. ([[Burt Lancaster]] was announced at one stage.)<ref>{{Cite news|title=The American Girl' Seen Lost to Films: Males Dominate Producer Jurow Mourns: Tells Plans|author=Scheuer, Philip K.|date=July 8, 1963|work=Los Angeles Times|page=D13}}</ref> Working with Warner, Curtis's new agent [[Irving Paul Lazar|Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar]] negotiated US$125,000 for Curtis, more than Edwards and Lemmon who were to receive US$100,000 each. After Warner signed the Curtis contract, Lazar reasoned that Edwards and Lemmon should  make US$125,000, and Warner upped its compensation to match Curtis.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x0sFjFxhoGIC&pg=PA249 |pages=249\u2013250 |title=American Prince: A Memoir |last1=Curtis |first1=Tony |author-link1=Tony Curtis |last2=Golenbock |first2=Peter |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-307-40849-5}}</ref>\n\nNatalie Wood did not want to make ''The Great Race'', but Warner talked her into it. Wood was unhappy with her career and her personal life, having been divorced from Robert Wagner in April 1962. Warner asked Curtis if he would give a percentage of his film royalties to Wood as an enticement, but Curtis refused. He said \"I couldn't give her anything to make her want to do the movie.\"<ref name=Finstead2009>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShQPhimir3EC&pg=PT297 |page=297 |last=Finstad |first=Suzanne |title=Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood |publisher=Random House Digital |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-42866-0}}</ref> Instead of more money, Warner promised Wood that if she completed ''The Great Race'', she could star in [[Gavin Lambert]]'s drama ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'', a role she greatly wished to have.<ref name=Finstead2009/> Wood agreed, thinking that filming would be brief on Edwards' movie.\n\nShooting began on June 15, 1964.<ref name=Finstead2009/> Many of the sight gags for ''The Great Race'' were expensive to create, and the costs ballooned to US$12&nbsp;million by the time the film was finished. Edwards, sometimes with Wood in tow, repeatedly visited Warner in his office to ask for more money. Warner approved nearly all of the requests. When it was released, it was the most expensive comedy ever filmed.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\nShooting ended in November 1964. During the five months of filming, Wood's unhappiness was not visible to the cast and crew, and her characterization of Maggie DuBois was playful. Her sister [[Lana Wood]] thought that Wood looked the prettiest she ever had, but Lana sensed that the film \"was physically taxing\" for Wood.<ref name=Finstad299>Finstad, 2009, p. 299</ref> On Friday, November 27, the day after Thanksgiving, Wood wrapped the last bit of dialog work, then went home and swallowed a bottle of prescription pills. Groggy from the drugs, she called her friend [[Mart Crowley]] who took her to the hospital for emergency treatment.<ref name=Finstad299/>\n\nMusic for the film was by [[Henry Mancini]], and the costumes were designed by [[Edith Head]]. Production design, setting the period and augmenting the visual humor, was by [[Fernando Carrere]] who had designed ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' and ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' for Blake Edwards. The unique slideshow-style title design was by Ken Mundie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-great-race/|title=The Great Race|website=www.artofthetitle.com}}</ref>\n\n===Custom cars===\n[[File:Stahls Automotive Collection December 2021 101 (1964 Leslie Special from \"The Great Race\").jpg|thumb|Leslie Special from ''The Great Race'' at [[Stahls Automotive Collection]]]]\n[[File:Stahls Automotive Collection December 2021 098 (1964 Hannibal 8 from \"The Great Race\").jpg|thumb|Hannibal 8 from ''The Great Race'' at Stahls Automotive Collection]]\n\nThe hero's white car, the Leslie Special, was built by Warner Brothers to resemble a [[Thomas Flyer]], the car that won the [[1908 New York to Paris Race]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowers |first=Jesse |url=http://justacarguy.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-movie-great-race-you-may-have-liked.html |title=Just a car guy : In the movie \"The Great Race\" you may have liked the \"Leslie Special\" ... but did you think they'd ever put it in another movie?

One is on display at the Petersen Automobile Museum, powered by a Volkswagen industrial engine. Another is at the [[Volo Auto Museum]] in Volo, Illinois. This model includes a prop \"cannon\" and a working smoke generator.

Following this was the throwing of 4,000 pies,<ref name=Wasson2009/> the most pies ever filmed in a pie fight.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> The scene lasts four minutes and 20 seconds and cost US$200,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|200000|1965|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars {{inflation-fn|US}}) to shoot; US$18,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18000|1965|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars {{inflation-fn|US}}) just for the pastry.<ref name=Wasson2009/>\n\nColorful cream pies with fillings such as raspberry, strawberry, blueberry and lemon were used.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> For [[Continuity editing|continuity]] between days of shooting, the actors were photographed at the end of each day and then made up the following morning to have the same colorful appearance, the same smears of pie crust and filling.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nEdwards told the cast that a pie fight by itself is not funny, so to make it funny they would build tension by having the hero, dressed all in white, fail to get hit with any pies. He said \"The audience will start yearning for him to get it\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> Finally, the hero was to take a pie in the face at \"just the right moment\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nShooting was halted while the actors took the weekend off. Over the weekend, the pie residue spoiled all over the scenery. When the actors returned Monday morning, the set stank so badly that the building required a thorough cleaning and large fans to blow out the sour air. The missing pie residue was recreated carefully with more pies, and shooting resumed.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nAt first, the actors had fun with the pie fight assignment, but eventually the process grew wearisome and dangerous. Wood choked briefly on pie filling which hit her open mouth. Lemmon exaggerated that he got knocked out a few times; he said \"a pie hitting you in the face feels like a ton of cement\".<ref name=Zeitlin1965/> At the end of shooting, when Edwards called \"cut!\", he was barraged with several hundred pies that members of the cast had hidden, waiting for the moment.<ref name=Zeitlin1965/>\n\nThe pie fight scene paid homage to the early [[Mack Sennett]] practice of using a single thrown pie as comedic punctuation, but to a greater degree, it was a celebration of movie pie fights such as ''[[Behind the Screen]]'' (1916) with [[Charlie Chaplin]]; ''[[The Battle of the Century]]'' (1927) starring [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]]; and ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]'' (1941) with [[the Three Stooges]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK9ZsmT9B5IC&pg=PA55 |page=55 |title=The complete films of Laurel & Hardy |chapter=The Battle of the Century |last=Everson |first=William K. |publisher=Citadel Press |year=1967 |isbn=0-8065-0146-4}}</ref> In his script for ''The Great Race'', Edwards called for a \"''Battle of the Century''\u2013style pie fight\". Although Edwards used 4,000 pies over five days, many of these were used as set dressing for continuity. Laurel and Hardy used 3,000 pies in only one day of shooting, so more are seen flying through the air. [[Leonard Maltin]] compared ''The Great Race'' pie fight to ''The Battle of the Century'' and determined that Laurel and Hardy's pacing was far superior, that the more modern film suffered from an \"incomplete understanding of slapstick\" while the 1927 pie fight remains \"one of the great scenes in all of screen comedy.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Movie comedy teams |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |author-link=Leonard Maltin |publisher=New American Library |year=1970 |edition=2 |page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Great Race'' was generally not well-received upon release and was considered a critical and commercial flop, making it the first notable failure for director Edwards. Most critics attacked its blatant and overdone slapstick humor and its lack of substance. It also suffered from comparisons with another race-themed \"epic comedy\" of 1965, ''[[Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines]]''. Film critic Richard Schickel wrote that, although the film \"bumps along very pleasantly for the most part\", Edwards failed at his attempt to recreate the slapstick atmosphere of a Laurel and Hardy comedy.<ref name=Schickel1965>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 |page=8 |title=A $12&nbsp;Million Romp in Hollywood's Attic |last=Schickel |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Schickel |magazine=Life |date=September 17, 1965 |access-date=July 7, 2011}}</ref> Schickel felt that Wood was \"hopelessly miscast\", and that the energies of Lemmon and Curtis did not quite make the slapstick work.<ref name=Schickel1965/> Maltin wrote that Wood \"never looked better\" and that the film's comedy sometimes worked but was otherwise forced: \"a mixed bag\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789/page/554 554] |title=Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |author-link=Leonard Maltin |publisher=Penguin |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-452-28978-9}}</ref> On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 72% based on 25 reviews, with an average score of 6.00/10.<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=1008852-great_race|title=The Great Race}}</ref>\n\nDespite earning theatrical rentals of over $11.4 million in the United States and Canada, due to its high cost, it caused a loss to the studio.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 15, 1968|page=1|last=Beaupre|first=Lee|title=Rising Skepticism On Stars}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nBefore the film was released, the soundtrack was re-recorded in Hollywood by RCA Victor Records for release on vinyl LP.

The author was renowned crime and western novelist [[Marvin Albert|Marvin H. Albert]], who also made something of a cottage industry out of movie tie-ins. He seems to have been the most prolific screenplay novelizer of the late '50s through mid '60s, and, during that time, the preeminent specialist at light comedy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\nThe novelization, based on the screenplay rather than the finished film, differs from the film in various aspects. In the novel, the country of Carpania is called Ruritania (like in Hope's ''Prisoner of Zenda''), Keenan Wynn's character is called Jebediah (not Hezekiah) and stays behind in Ruritania, having fallen in love with a local noblewoman. The pie fight is missing, and the drivers are chased by cowboys (rather than native Americans) before arriving in Boracho. A few minor changes concern Leslie's courting of Maggie Dubois: in the novelization, it's she who suggests sharing the blanket in the snowstorm, and she also gets to drive the Leslie Special when Leslie has his arm in a sling. Scenes not included in the film include: a rainstorm, Fate's car sinking in a river, and a more extended stay in Russia (mirroring the Boracho episode).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Albert|first=Marvin H.|title=The Great Race|publisher=Dell|year=1965|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n* [[Dell Comics|Dell]] Movie Classic: ''The Great Race'' (March 1966)<ref>{{gcdb series|id=74217|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''The Great Race''}}</ref><ref>{{Comic Book DB|type=issue|id=311519|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''The Great Race''}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe film was a major influence on ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]'', a [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon series.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's the Wacky Races!|url=http://www.hotink.com/wacky/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516051336/http://www.hotink.com/wacky/|archive-date=May 16, 2011|access-date=2014-08-25|publisher=John V.
