Although a commercial failure, ''Shattered Glass'' received acclaim from critics, with particular praise for Christensen and Sarsgaard's performances.<ref name=\"Rotten Tomatoes\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1998, [[Stephen Glass]] is an associate editor at ''[[The New Republic]]''. Among the youngest of the magazine's staff, Glass enjoys popularity with his colleagues for his entertaining stories. Glass serves under editor [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], whom the writers hold loyalty towards. However, conflict between Kelly and publisher [[Marty Peretz]] results in Peretz firing Kelly. Reporter [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] is promoted by Peretz to replace Kelly, despite being disliked by the staff.\n\nGlass writes a story entitled \"Hack Heaven\" that details a teenage hacker being hired by a large software firm he infiltrated. The story reaches [[Forbes#Forbes.com|Forbes Digital Tool]] where reporter [[Adam Penenberg]] finds no corroborating evidence for what Glass described. When contacted by Penenberg about being unable to reach the individuals in his story, Glass provides a number with a [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] area code for the firm. After Lane calls the number, he briefly speaks with an individual identifying as the firm's chairman. Glass and Lane also partake in a conference call with the Forbes staff, which further erodes the story's credibility and prompts Glass to claim he was tricked by his sources.\n\nLane, looking to protect Glass from the Forbes staff, has Glass take him to a convention center and restaurant where the story took place, but learns that both were closed during the events Glass wrote about. With the story contradicted by this information, Glass tells Lane he had only relied on sources for information and falsified his first-hand experiences to improve the story. Lane decides to suspend Glass instead of firing him due to his popularity, but upon discovering that Glass's brother lives in Palo Alto, he realizes that Glass had his brother pose as the firm's chairman. After confronting Glass with this knowledge, Lane re-reads Glass's previous stories and comes to the revelation that they were also falsified. With his deception exposed, Glass is fired by Lane.\n\nDespite initial pushback, Lane receives support from ''The New Republic'' staff for bringing Glass's deception to light, while the magazine's attorney questions Glass over which stories of his were fabricated. Closing titles reveal that Penenberg's article on Glass was hailed as a breakthrough for internet journalism, ''The New Republic'' determined that 27 of Glass's 41 stories were either partially or completely fabricated, Kelly was killed while covering the [[Iraq War]], Glass earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown]] and wrote a novel paralleling his own life, and Lane joined ''[[The Washington Post]]''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Hayden Christensen]] as [[Stephen Glass]]\n* [[Peter Sarsgaard]] as [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]]\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Caitlin Avey\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Andy Fox\n* [[Melanie Lynskey]] as Amy Brand\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]]\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as [[Adam Penenberg]]\n* [[Mark Blum]] as Lewis Estridge\n* Simone-\u00c9lise Girard as Catarina Bannier\n* [[Chad Donella]] as David Bach\n* [[Jamie Elman]] as Aaron Bluth\n* [[Luke Kirby]] as Rob Gruen\n* [[Cas Anvar]] as Kambiz Foroohar\n* Linda E.

The challenge for Ray was to make the subject matter watchable because, according to the filmmaker, \"watching people write is deadly dull ... in a film like this, dialogue is what a character is willing to reveal about himself, and the camera is there to capture everything else\".<ref name=\"Bowen\"/> The breakthrough for Ray came when he realized that the film's real protagonist was not Glass but Chuck Lane.
