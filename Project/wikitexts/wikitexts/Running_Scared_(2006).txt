The film follows a low-ranking mafioso who is ordered to get rid of a gun used to kill corrupt cops and finds himself in a race against time when the gun ends up in the wrong hands.\n\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States on February 24, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nA large drug deal between [[New Jersey]] [[mobsters]] and a [[Jamaica]]n gang goes awry, leading to a shootout that kills two corrupt police officers who were attempting to rob the gangs. Mobster Tommy Perello orders his subordinate, Joey Gazelle, to dispose of the guns; Joey goes home to his wife Teresa and their ten-and-a-half-year-old son Nicky, and stashes the guns in his basement. Unbeknownst to him, Nicky and his friend Oleg secretly watch him.\n\nOleg steals one of the guns before heading home to his mother Mila and his abusive stepfather, Anzor. When Anzor becomes belligerent, Oleg shoots him before leaving the house. When Joey goes to investigate the disturbance, he finds a wounded Anzor who then describes the gun. Joey realizes that it is one of the weapons he hid earlier, and rushes to track down Oleg before the police do.\n\nThroughout the night, Oleg runs into many unsavory people: a homeless crack addict, a drug dealer, then finally an abusive pimp named Lester and his prostitute, Divina. After Oleg helps Divina, she decides to look after him. She takes him to a diner where they find Joey, who is explaining to his boss Frankie Perello that Oleg has the gun. Oleg stashes the gun in the diner bathroom, and after leaving with Divina, he is found by police officers who then return him to Anzor.\n\nOleg once again escapes, and is taken in by a kindly family. When Oleg becomes suspicious of them, he discreetly calls Teresa, who then arrives and threatens her way into their apartment. She rescues Oleg and tells him to leave with the other children, then murders the parents after finding evidence of [[snuff film]]s and other paraphernalia. Meanwhile, Joey continues his search, and eventually finds Oleg. However, just before he can retrieve the gun, both he and Oleg are found by Tommy, who goes to take them to Frankie.\n\nTommy takes Joey and Oleg to an ice hockey rink to meet Frankie and [[Russian mafia|Russian mob]] boss Ivan. Ivan has brought Anzor to try and get Oleg to tell them the source of the gun he used. When Ivan slaps the boy, Joey lashes out at Ivan, and he, in turn, is subdued and beaten by Ivan's thugs. When Anzor refuses to kill Oleg, Ivan kills him, and then turns to kill Oleg. Before he can, Joey distracts him by accusing Frankie of planning to attack the Russians because Anzor was cooking [[Methamphetamine|meth]] in Frankie's territory. A shootout ensues between the two gangs, leading to the deaths of Tommy and Ivan. When Frankie attempts to shoot Joey, the latter reveals that he is an undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, showing a hidden [[Covert listening device|wire]] under his shirt. Oleg then distracts Frankie, allowing Joey to disarm and kill him. Joey and Oleg then exit as the FBI and local police storm the building.\n\nJoey and Oleg return to the diner for breakfast, and they encounter Lester holding the gun that Oleg had hidden earlier. In the ensuing struggle, Lester shoots Joey in the stomach, but not before Joey fatally stabs Lester with a [[switchblade]]. Joey and Oleg struggle to return to Teresa and Nicky. Meanwhile, Mila, thinking Oleg is dead, commits suicide by blowing herself up in Anzor's meth lab. Just as Teresa and Nicky rush outside to investigate, they see Joey crash his car after losing consciousness.\n\nDays later, Teresa and Nicky attend Joey's funeral along with Oleg, who has been adopted by the family. They drive out to a small farmhouse, where Joey emerges, having faked his death to protect himself and his family after being outed as an undercover FBI agent.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Joey Gazelle\n* [[Cameron Bright]] as Oleg Yugorsky\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Teresa Gazelle\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Detective Rydell\n* [[Karel Roden]] as Anzor Yugorsky\n* [[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]] as Tommy \"Tombs\" Perello\n* [[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]] as Mila Yugorsky\n* Alex Neuberger as Nicky Gazelle\n* [[Michael Cudlitz]] as Sal \"Gummy Bear\" Franzone\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Dez Hansel\n* [[Elizabeth Mitchell]] as Edele Hansel\n* [[Arthur J.
