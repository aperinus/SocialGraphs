The [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Nora Gregor]], [[Paulette Dubost]], [[Mila Par\u00e9ly]], [[Marcel Dalio]], [[Julien Carette]], [[Roland Toutain]], [[Gaston Modot]], [[Pierre Magnier]] and Renoir.\n\nRenoir's portrayal of the wise, mournful Octave anchors the fatalistic mood of this pensive [[comedy of manners]]. The film depicts members of upper-class French society and their servants just before the beginning of [[World War II]], showing their moral callousness on the eve of destruction.\n\nAt the time, ''The Rules of the Game'' was the most expensive French film made: Its original budget of 2.5 million [[French franc|francs]] eventually increased to more than 5 million francs. Renoir and [[cinematographer]] [[Jean Bachelet]] made extensive use of [[Deep focus|deep-focus]] and long shots during which the camera is constantly moving, sophisticated cinematic techniques in 1939.\n\nRenoir's career in France was at its pinnacle in 1939 and ''The Rules of the Game'' was eagerly anticipated. However, its premiere was met with scorn and disapproval by critics and audiences. Renoir reduced the film's running time from 113 minutes to 85 but even then the film was a critical and financial disaster. In October 1939, it was banned by the wartime French government for \"having an undesirable influence over the young\".{{sfn|Drazin|2011|p=186}}\n\nFor many years, the 85-minute version was the only one available but despite this its reputation slowly grew. In 1956, boxes of original material were discovered and a reconstructed version of the film premiered that year at the [[Venice Film Festival]], with only a minor scene from Renoir's first cut missing. Since then, ''The Rules of the Game'' has been called [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films in the history of cinema]]. Numerous film critics and directors have praised it highly, citing it as an inspiration for their own work. It is the only film to earn a place among the top films in the respected Sight & Sound (BFI) decennial critics' poll for every decade since the poll's inception in 1952.<ref name=\"Sight&Sound1952\">{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1952.html |title=Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 1952 |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008052443/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1952.html |archive-date=October 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sight&Sound1962\">{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1962.html |title=Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 1962 |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008051815/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1962.html |archive-date=October 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sight&Sound1972\">{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1972.html |title=Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 1972 |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008052122/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1972.html |archive-date=October 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sight&Sound1982\">{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1982.html |title=Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 1982 |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008062954/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1982.html |archive-date=October 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sight&Sound1992\">{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1992.html |title=Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 1992 |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008052127/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/1992.html |archive-date=October 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sight&Sound2002\">{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/poll/critics.html |title=Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll: 2002 |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007210621/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/poll/critics.html |archive-date=October 7, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sight&Sound2012\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics |title=Critics Top Ten |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=16 August 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=left|width=25%|fontsize=101%|quote=<poem>\n''Sensitive hearts, faithful hearts,''\n''Who shun love whither it does range,''\n''Cease to be so bitter:''\n''Is it a crime to change?''\n''If Cupid was given wings,''\n''Was it not to flitter?''</poem>\n|source=\u2014 Quotation at the beginning of the film, from Beaumarchais' ''[[The Marriage of Figaro|Le Mariage de Figaro]] ''(IV, 10)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefifiorganization.net/janus/the-rules-of-the-game/ |title=The Rules of the Games |website=thefifiorganization.net |publisher=The Fifi Organization |date=August 30, 2009 |access-date=11 May 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nAviator Andr\u00e9 Jurieux lands at [[Le Bourget Airfield]] outside Paris after crossing the Atlantic in his plane. He is greeted by his friend Octave, who tells Andr\u00e9 that Christine {{spaced ndash}}the Austrian-French noblewoman Andr\u00e9 loves{{spaced ndash}}has not come to greet him. Andr\u00e9 is heartbroken. When a radio reporter comes to broadcast Andr\u00e9's first words upon landing, he explains his sorrow and denounces Christine. She is listening to the broadcast in her Paris apartment while attended by her maid, Lisette. Christine has been married to Robert, Marquis de la Chesnaye for three years. For two years, Lisette has been married to Schumacher {{spaced ndash}}the gamekeeper at Robert's country estate, La Colini\u00e8re in [[Sologne]]{{spaced ndash}}but she is more devoted to Christine than to her husband. Christine's past relationship with Andr\u00e9 is openly known by her husband, her maid and their friend Octave. After Christine and Robert playfully discuss Andr\u00e9's emotional display and pledge devotion to one another, Robert excuses himself to make a telephone call. He arranges to meet his mistress Genevi\u00e8ve the next morning.\n\nAt Genevi\u00e8ve's apartment, Robert says he must end their relationship but invites her to join them for a weekend retreat to La Colini\u00e8re. Christine also invites her niece, Jackie. Later, Octave induces Robert to invite Andr\u00e9 to the estate as well. They joke that Andr\u00e9 and Genevi\u00e8ve will begin a relationship, thereby solving everyone's problems. At the estate, Schumacher is policing the grounds and trying to eliminate rabbits. Marceau {{spaced ndash}}a poacher{{spaced  ndash}}sneaks onto the estate to retrieve a rabbit caught in a snare. Before Marceau can escape, Schumacher catches him and begins to escort him from the property when Robert demands to know what is happening. Marceau explains that he can catch rabbits and Robert hires him as a servant. Once inside the house, Marceau flirts with Lisette. The assembled guests go on a hunt led by Schumacher, who resents Marceau. On the way back to La Colini\u00e8re's castle, Robert tells Genevi\u00e8ve that he no longer loves her. Genevi\u00e8ve wants to pack up and leave but Christine persuades her to stay.\n\nAt a masked ball, various romantic liaisons are made. Andr\u00e9 and Christine declare their love for each other and plan to run away together. Marceau pursues Lisette, and the jealous Schumacher is upset. Robert and Andr\u00e9 come to an argument over Christine. In the secluded greenhouse, Octave declares that he too loves Christine{{spaced ndash}}who is now having doubts about Andr\u00e9{{spaced ndash}}and they decide to run away together. Schumacher and Marceau, who have both been expelled from the estate by Robert after a fight over Lisette, watch Octave and Christine in the greenhouse. As in Beaumarchais's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' the literary basis for Mozart's opera, they mistake Christine for Lisette because Christine is wearing Lisette's cape and hood. Octave returns to the house for his coat and hat, where Lisette begs him not to leave with Christine.\n\nBreaking his promise to Christine, Octave meets Andr\u00e9 and sends him out to Christine in the greenhouse, lending him his overcoat, which causes Andr\u00e9's death. When Andr\u00e9 reaches the greenhouse wearing Octave's coat, Schumacher mistakes him for Octave, who he thinks is trying to run off with his wife, and shoots him dead.\n\nIn the closing moments of the film, Octave and Marceau walk away into the night as Robert brings Schumacher back into the household and explains that he would report the killing to the authorities as nothing more than an unfortunate accident.\n\n== Cast ==\nCredits adapted from [[British Film Institute]].<ref name=bfi>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b41d658 |title=La R\u00e8gle du jeu (1939) BFI |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=28 November 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129082724/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b41d658 |archive-date=November 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Nora Gregor]] as Christine, Marquise de la Chesnaye\n* [[Paulette Dubost]] as Lisette, Christine's maid\n* [[Marcel Dalio]] as Robert, Marquis de la Chesnaye, Christine's husband and Genevi\u00e8ve's lover\n* [[Roland Toutain]] as Andr\u00e9 Jurieux, an aviator in love with Christine\n* [[Jean Renoir]] as Octave, an old friend of Christine's and friend of Andr\u00e9\n* [[Mila Par\u00e9ly]] as Genevi\u00e8ve de Marras, Robert's lover\n* [[Julien Carette]] as Marceau, a poacher and Lisette's would-be lover\n* [[Gaston Modot]] as Edouard Schumacher, Robert's gamekeeper and Lisette's husband\n* Anne Mayen as Jackie, a niece of Christine\n* [[Pierre Magnier]] as The General, a guest at Robert's estate\n* [[L\u00e9on Larive]] as the cook\n* [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] as the English servant\n* [[Marguerite de Morlaye]] as a guest\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n* [[Pierre Nay]] as Monsieur de St. Aubin, a guest at Robert's estate\n* Richard Franc\u0153ur as Monsieur La Bruy\u00e8re, a guest at Robert's estate\n* [[Odette Talazac]] as Madame de la Plante, a guest at Robert's estate\n* Claire G\u00e9rard as Madame de la Bruy\u00e8re, a guest at Robert's estate\n* Lise Elina as the radio reporter at the airport\n* Eddy Debray as Corneille, Robert's butler\n* G\u00e9o Forster as the effeminate guest\n* Tony Corteggiani as Monsieur Berthelin, a guest\n* Nicolas Amato as Cava, a guest from South America\n* Jenny H\u00e9lia as Germaine, a servant\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Zwoboda]] as Andr\u00e9's engineer at the airport\n* Camille Fran\u00e7ois as a radio reporter (voice)\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Background and writing ===\nIn 1938 the French film industry was booming, and Renoir was at the height of his career.

All five invested 10,000 francs into the company and intended to produce two films per year.{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=196}} The company was modeled after the American film production company [[United Artists]],{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=379}} which was formed in 1919 as a film distribution company for independent artists by [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[D.W. Griffith]] and [[Mary Pickford]]. Renoir rallied his friends in the film industry around the company and got financial support from [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], [[Julien Duvivier]], [[Jean Gabin]] and [[Simone Simon]]. NEF's headquarters on the Rue la Grange-Bateli\u00e8re was sublet from [[Marcel Pagnol]]'s production company. On December 8, 1938 [[Georges Cravenne]] published a press release in ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' announcing that Renoir and Pagnol were about to sign an agreement to procure a large theatre where they would publicly screen \"the films that they would direct from then on\". ''The Rules of the Game'' was the only film produced by the company.{{sfn|Bertin|1986|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\nIn May 1938, Renoir completed the historical drama ''[[La Marseillaise (film)|La Marseillaise]]'' and wanted to make a comedy.{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=187}} He was anxious about the [[Munich agreement]] and the strong possibility of another world war, and wanted to film a \"happy dream\" to subdue his pessimism.{{sfn|Bertin|1986|p=156}} He wrote a synopsis for a film titled ''Les Millions d'Arlequin'', which had characters similar to those in ''The Rules of the Game''.{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=187}} When conceiving the film, Renoir was inspired by classical French art, such as the works of [[Pierre de Marivaux]], [[Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais]] and especially [[Alfred de Musset]]'s ''[[Les Caprices de Marianne]]''.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=387}} Renoir initially intended to adapt the classic French play ''[[The Moods of Marianne|Les Caprices de Marianne]]''; NEF first announced the film as an adaptation of it.{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=197}} Renoir later said he never intended to directly adapt ''Les Caprices de Marianne'' but only to re-read it and other classics of French literature for inspiration.{{sfn|Cardullo|2005|p=4}}\n\nAfter returning from lecturing in London in January 1939, Renoir left Paris to work on a script. He told a reporter that his next film would be \"A precise description of the bourgeois of our age.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Truffaut|1a2=Bazin|1y=1974|1p=184|2a1=Sesonske|2y=1980|2p=380}} Renoir, [[Carl Koch (director)|Carl Koch]] and Zwoboda went to [[Marlotte]] to work on the script. Because Renoir wanted to allow the actors to improvise their dialogue, only one-third of the film was scripted and the rest was a detailed outline. Renoir later said that his \"ambition when I made the film was to illustrate this remark: we are dancing on a volcano\".{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=382}} Renoir called the film a \"[[divertissement]]\" for its use of [[baroque music]] and aspects of classical French comedies.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=386}} Renoir's initial inspiration by ''Les Caprices de Marianne'' led to the film's four main characters correlating with those of the play; a virtuous wife, a jealous husband, a despairing lover and an interceding friend. In both the play and the film the interceding friend is named Octave.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=392}} Octave is also the only one of the four characters inspired by the play that shares traits with its counterpart. In both works, Octave is a \"sad clown\" full of self-doubt and self-pity.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=421}} The characters' names constantly changed between versions of the script;{{sfn|Bertin|1986|p=159}} Renoir said that in an early draft, Andr\u00e9 Jurieux was an orchestra conductor rather than an aviator.{{sfn|Cardullo|2005|p=4}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Nora Gregor.jpg|right|thumb|187px|[[Nora Gregor]] in 1932.

He was replaced by Roland Toutain. Simon was offered the role of Christine but wanted 800,000 francs, which was a third of the film's entire budget. Simon's salary request was vetoed by NEF administrator Camille Fran\u00e7ois. Ledoux was offered the role of Schumacher. He was married to Simon at the time; he declined when her salary request was denied and instead took a role in [[Maurice Tourneur]]'s ''Volpone''. He was replaced by Gaston Modot.{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=199}} [[Claude Dauphin (actor)|Claude Dauphin]] was offered the role of the Marquis de la Chesnaye; he refused it and instead acted with Simon in [[Raymond Bernard]]'s ''[[Love Cavalcade|Cavalcade d'amour]]''.{{sfn|Bertin|1986|p=159}} Renoir then cast Marcel Dalio as the Marquis. Years later, Dalio asked Renoir why he had been cast after having typically played [[burlesque]] or traitorous roles. Renoir told Dalio that he was the opposite of the clich\u00e9 of what a Marquis was and that Dalio was the only actor he knew that could portray the character's insecurity.{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=199}} Renoir's brother [[Pierre Renoir|Pierre]] was cast as Octave, and Carette was cast as Marceau.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=380}}\n\nFrancois suggested newly famous stage actress Michele Alfa for the role of Christine, and Renoir went with his wife [[Marguerite Renoir|Marguerite]] and Zwobada to see her perform in a play.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=380}} While at the play Renoir noticed Nora Gregor in a box seat in the audience and asked about her during the intermission. He learned that Gregor was the wife of [[Ernst R\u00fcdiger Starhemberg|Prince Ernst Rudiger von Stahremberg]], an Austrian nobleman. Renoir became friends with Gregor and her husband, getting to know them over several dinners in Paris.{{sfn|Bergan|1997|pp=199\u2013200}} Stahremberg was forced to resign his leadership role in the [[Heimwehr]]{{spaced ndash}}a paramilitary fascist party{{spaced ndash}}because Gregor was Jewish and he was anti-fascist. When Germany [[Anschluss|annexed Austria in March 1938]] Gregor and Stahremberg fled to France. Renoir said they were \"in a state of great disarray. Everything they believed in was collapsing.\"{{sfn|Drazin|2011|p=174}} Gregor was an actress from the Viennese ''[[Burgtheater]]'' and had appeared in some films, including [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]'s ''[[Michael (1924 film)|Michael]]''.{{sfn|Bertin|1986|p=159}} Gregor's first husband had been the concert pianist [[Mitja Nikisch]], son of the renowned conductor [[Arthur Nikisch]] of the [[Leipzig Opera]] and according to film theorist Charles Drazin, a possible inspiration for some characteristics of Octave.{{sfn|Drazin|2011|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\nDespite objections from his NEF colleagues, Renoir hired Gregor for the role of Christine.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=381}} She was older than the original character, and he made changes to the character based on Gregor's personality and on their dinner conversations, such as making Christine the daughter of an Austrian conductor.{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=200}} Many of Renoir's friends believed he fell in love with Gregor shortly after casting her. Zwoboda said Gregor had \"that which Renoir loved above all; an incontestable class, a style, the gestures and bearing of a great distinction\". Renoir said he cast Gregor because of her Austrian accent, which he believed would create \"a little barrier&nbsp;... between her and her surroundings\" and because of her appearance, which he considered \"birdlike\" and \"sincere\".{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|pp=417\u2013418}}\n\nRenoir finished casting the remaining roles by late January 1939.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=381}} When asked who the main character of the film was, Renoir answered: \"There isn't any! My conception at the beginning{{spaced ndash}}and at the end{{spaced ndash}}was to make a ''film d'ensemble'', a film representing a society, a group of persons, almost a whole class, and not a film of personal affairs.\"{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=413}}\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for exterior scenes set in the country began on February 15, 1939, in Sologne and outside the Chateau de [[la Fert\u00e9-Saint-Aubin]].{{sfnm|1a1=Braudy|1y=1972|1p=249|2a1=Durgnat|2y=1975|2p=186}} Renoir later said he chose Sologne because his father [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] \"regretted that he had never been able to paint [it].

Special Features: Mila Par\u00e9ly. The Criterion Collection. 2004. Spine Number 216.</ref> The cast's improvisations caused some changes from the original script. Christine was initially written as a bored, upper class bourgeois whose main preoccupation was planning parties, but Renoir amended this to accommodate Gregor's acting. Renoir also cut most of the references to Christine's conductor father Stiller, such as his relationship with the Marquis.

It was shot between [[Munich Agreement|Munich]] and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed by the state of mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And it seemed to me that a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|pp=378}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Jean en tant que Chasseur (1910).jpg|thumb|187px|Renoir's father, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], painted him in ''Portrait of Jean Renoir as a hunter'' (1910). Jean considered hunting to be cruel, and did not film ''The Rules of the Game''{{'}}s hunting scene himself.]]\n\nRenoir wanted to depict people as they truly were at that point in history; he said ''The Rules of the Game'' was \"a reconstructed documentary, a documentary on the condition of a society at a given moment\".{{sfn|Cardullo|2005|p=106}} He believed this depiction was the reason behind the film's disastrous premiere, saying \"the audience's reaction was due to my candour\".{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=172}} ''The Marriage of Figaro'', an inspiration for the film, had also been considered controversial for its attack on the class system.{{sfn|Drazin|2011|p=182\u2013183}} ''The Rules of the Game'' remained controversial with the French public shortly after World War II when it was once again banned. Renoir's biographer [[Ronald Bergan]] said the film hit a raw nerve with the public by depicting \"people, who might have had an influence in shaping the world, [but] did nothing to prevent an advance of Fascism; some of whom, indeed, actually welcomed it\".{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=203\u2013204}}\n\nThe rabbit hunt scene is often compared to the senseless death that occurs during war; Renoir said he wanted to show a certain class of people killing for no reason. Renoir himself had never killed an animal and called hunting \"an abominable exercise in cruelty\".<ref name=DVDalain />{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=170}} Bergan saw the analogy to world events and wrote \"in the great set piece of the hunt, the callous cruelty of the guests is laid bare as they fire at any rabbit and bird that moves after the beaters have led the game to slaughter\".{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=203}}\n\nThe film's most-quoted line of dialogue, spoken by Octave, is \"You see, in this world, there is one awful thing, and that is that everyone has his reasons\".{{sfn|Truffaut|Bazin|1974|p=9}} Renoir's sentiment of [[Secular humanism|objective humanism]] for the film's characters is articulated by Octave's remark and shows his empathy for the people he was simultaneously criticizing. [[Richard Roud]] praised Renoir's role in the film, observing that Renoir's honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism: \"he did not wish to stand outside. And Renoir/Octave serves as the standard against which reality and fiction can be measured.\"{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=205}} In his original outline for the film, Renoir said he intended all the characters to be sincere and that the film would have no villains.<ref name=DVD11>DVD notes, p. 11</ref>\n\nRenoir said Andr\u00e9 was \"the victim, who, trying to fit into a world in which he does not belong, fails to respect the rules of the game\",{{sfn|Renoir|1974|p=170}} and that Andr\u00e9 thought he could shatter the rules by a world flight, while Christine thought she could do the same by following her heart.<ref name=DVD10>DVD notes, p.10</ref> The \"rules\" of the film's title are its only villain.

He later said \"Little by little, my idea took shape and the subject got simpler. I kept living on baroque rhythms, and after a few more days, the subject became more and more precise.\" He also said he began imagining Simone Simon \"moving to the spirit of the music.\" This preoccupation with baroque music during filming led to Renoir's original idea of adapting ''Les Caprices de Marianne'' into a film.{{sfn|Bertin|1986|p=157}}\n\n''The Rules of the Game'' is known for its early and elaborate use of [[deep focus]] cinematography. Renoir said he and his cinematographer [[Jean Bachelet]] \"ordered some special lenses, very [[fast lens]]es, but ones that still gave us considerable depth, so that we could keep our backgrounds in focus almost all the time.\"{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=203}} This [[depth of field]] in his shots allowed Renoir to shoot in large rooms and long corridors in the chateau sequences, and characters were able to move freely between the background and the foreground.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=437}} Approximately half of the shots in the film have camera movements. In many shots the camera moves, stops in place, changes direction and circles around the subjects. Film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] said \"one has the impression of a camera that is always moving to cover as much as possible. One does not notice cuts, one delights in a continuity which is often on the verge of chaos and finally leads to tragedy in the intrusion of subplot into plot, of the theatrical into the real and of disaster into balances.\"{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|p=935}}\n\nRenoir used few [[close-ups]] or [[Shot reverse shot|reverse shots]] and most of the shots are [[two shot]]s. The hunt scene differs from the rest of the film; it uses [[Fast cutting|rapid editing]] whereas most of the film uses long takes of dialogue or action.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=437}} Renoir wanted to shoot the film in color to take advantage of the beauty of Sologne in the winter but he was unable to secure funding from Jean Jay. One week before filming began Renoir tried to persuade [[Technicolor]] to fund the color cinematography but the company refused.{{sfn|Bertin|1986|p=162}}{{sfn|Bergan|1997|p=201}}\n\nThe sound in the film was complex for its time; it included dialogue spoken over ambient noises such as crowds at the airport and gunfire during the hunt. Film director Jean Prat said the film's soundtrack was \"of a perfection  never equaled by any French film.\" Characters often talk at once or talk over each other's lines. One example of the dense soundtrack is the party scene, which includes dialogue over screams, gunfire and music. Except for the opening credits and the very end of the film, all of the music heard in the film is [[Incidental music|incidental]]. The sound engineer was Joseph de Bretagne.{{sfn|Crisp|2015|p=277}} Music used in the film includes [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Three German Dances (Mozart)|Three German Dances]]'', [[Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny|Monsigny]]'s ''[[Le d\u00e9serteur]]'', Louis Byrec, [[L\u00e9on Garnier]] and Eug\u00e8ne Rimbault's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|En revenant de la revue|fr}}'', [[Johann Strauss II|Strauss]]'s ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]'s ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Sa\u00ebns)|Danse macabre]]'', [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' and [[Vincent Scotto|Scotto]]'s ''\u00c0 Barbizon''. The music was arranged by [[Joseph Kosma]] and [[Roger D\u00e9sormi\u00e8re]].{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=437}}\n\nThe film's set designers Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9 and Max Douy built one of the most expensive sets in French film history at the Joinville Studio.{{sfn|Sesonske|1980|p=382}} According to Douy they were based on the script and were not reproductions of the interior of Chateau de la Fert\u00e9-Saint-Aubin, where exterior scenes were shot. The [[music box]]es used in the film were borrowed from several sources and some are now in a museum in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].<ref name=DVDmax /> Renoir thought the musical organ scene and Dalio's performance in it was the best scene he had ever filmed.
