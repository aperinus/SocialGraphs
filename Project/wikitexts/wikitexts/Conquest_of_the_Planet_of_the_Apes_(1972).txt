Lee Thompson]] and written by [[Paul Dehn]]. It is the fourth of five films in the original ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' series produced by [[Arthur P. Jacobs]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mediacircus.net/pota.html| title=Those Damned Dirty Apes!| access-date=2011-06-30| publisher=www.mediacircus.net}}</ref> The film stars [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]] and [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]. It explores how the apes rebelled from humanity's ill treatment following ''[[Escape from the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1971). It was followed by ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]'' (1973).\n\nThe first film in the 2010s [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] series, ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'' (2011), has a similar premise to ''Conquest'', but it is not officially a remake.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing a North American [[pandemic]] from a space-borne disease that wiped out all dogs and cats in 1983, the government has become a series of [[police state]]s that took apes as pets before establishing a culture based on ape [[Slavery|slave labor]]. These events were foretold [[Escape from the Planet of the Apes|in 1973]] as testimony by two chimpanzee scientists [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Cornelius|Cornelius]] and his wife [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Zira|Zira]], prior to being killed. While it appeared their baby was also killed, he evaded death and was secretly raised by the circus owner [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Armando|Armando]] as a young horseback rider. In 1991, now fully grown and named [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]], Armando brings him to one of the cities to distribute flyers for the circus's arrival, explaining to the curious ape the events that led to their new reality while advising him not to speak in public for fear of his life.\n\nSeeing apes performing various menial tasks and shocked at the harsh abuse inflicted on rebellious apes, Caesar shouts out \"lousy human bastards!\" after seeing a gorilla messenger being beaten and drugged. Though Armando takes responsibility for the exclamation while defusing the situation, Caesar runs away in the commotion. Finding Caesar hiding in a stairway, Armando tells the ape that he will turn himself in to the authorities and bluff his way out while instructing Caesar to hide among a group of arriving apes for safety. Caesar follows Armando's instruction and hides in a cage of orangutans, finding himself being trained for slavery through violent conditioning. Caesar is then sold at auction to Governor Breck, allowed by his owner to name himself by randomly pointing to a word in a book handed to him. The chimpanzee's finger rests upon the name \"Caesar\", feigning coincidence. Caesar is then put to work by Breck's chief aide MacDonald, whose African American heritage allows him to sympathize with the apes to the thinly veiled disgust of his boss.\n\nMeanwhile, Armando is being interrogated by Inspector Kolp, who suspects his \"circus ape\" is the child of the two talking apes from the future. Kolp's assistant puts Armando under a machine, \"the Authenticator\", that psychologically forces people to be truthful. After admitting he had heard the name Cornelius before, Armando realizes he cannot fight the machine and jumps through a window to his death after a brief struggle with a guard. When Caesar learns of the circus owner's death, he loses faith in human kindness and begins secretly teaching the apes combat while having them gather weapons.\n\nBy that time, through Kolp's investigation that the vessel which supposedly delivered Caesar is from a region with no native chimpanzees, Breck learns that Caesar is the ape they are hunting. Caesar reveals himself to MacDonald after he covered for the ape twice when called by Breck on Caesar's whereabouts. While MacDonald understands Caesar's intent to depose Breck, he expresses his doubts about the revolution's effectiveness along with Caesar being dismissive of most humans. Caesar is later captured by Breck's men and is electrically tortured into speaking. Hearing him speak, Breck orders Caesar's immediate death. Caesar survives his execution because MacDonald secretly lowers the machine's electrical output well below lethal levels. Once Breck leaves, Caesar kills his torturer and escapes.\n\nCaesar begins his revolution by first taking over Ape Management to build his numbers, proceeding to the command center with the apes killing most of the riot police that attempt to stop them, while setting the city on fire. After bursting into Breck's command post and killing most of the personnel, Caesar has Breck marched out to be executed. MacDonald attempts to plea Caesar not to succumb to brutality and be merciful to the former masters. Caesar ignores him and in a rage declares, \"Where there is fire, there is smoke. And in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch, and conspire, and plot, and plan for the inevitable day of man's downfall. The day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble! When the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity! And we shall build our own cities, in which there will be no place for humans except to serve our ends! And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! And that day is upon you now!\"\n\nIn the theatrical cut, as the apes raise their rifles to beat Breck to death, Caesar's girlfriend Lisa voices her objection, shouting \"No!\". She is the first ape to speak other than Caesar. Caesar reconsiders and orders the apes to lower their weapons, saying, \"But now, now we will put away our hatred. Now we will put down our weapons. We have passed through the night of the fires, and those who were our masters are now our servants. And we, who are not human, can afford to be humane. Destiny is the will of God, and if it is man's destiny to be dominated, it is God's will that he be dominated with compassion, and understanding. So, cast out your vengeance. Tonight, we have seen the birth of the Planet of the Apes!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Planet of the Apes characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]]\n* [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]] as Governor Breck\n* [[Ricardo Montalban]] as Armando\n* [[Natalie Trundy]] as Lisa\n* [[Hari Rhodes]] as MacDonald\n* [[Severn Darden]] as Kolp\n* [[Lou Wagner]] as busboy\n* [[John Randolph (actor)|John Randolph]] as commission chairman\n* Asa Maynor as Mrs. Riley\n* [[H.

Lee Thompson]], who had maintained an interest in the franchise ever since producer [[Arthur P. Jacobs]] invited him for the original ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', was hired to direct ''Conquest of the Planet of the Apes''. Thompson had worked with Jacobs on two earlier films, ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' and ''[[The Chairman (1969 film)|The Chairman]],'' as well as during the initial stages of ''Planet'', but scheduling conflicts had made him unavailable during its long development process.<ref>Greene, Eric (1998). ''Planet of the Apes as American Myth: Race and Politics in the Films and Television Series''. Wesleyan University Press. pp. 81\u201382. {{ISBN|9780819563293}}.</ref>\n\nThompson staged every scene with attention to detail, such as highlighting the conflicts with color: the humans wear black and other muted colors, while the apes' suits are colorful. [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]] suggested to Thompson his wardrobe with a black turtleneck sweater, and rehearsed his scenes after translating his dialogue into German \"to get this kind of severe feeling of the [[Nazism#Ideology and programme|Nazis]]\". Screenwriter [[Paul Dehn]] wrote the film incorporating references to the [[Racism in the United States|racial conflicts in North America]] during the early 1970s, and Thompson further highlighted by shooting some scenes in a manner similar to a news broadcast. The primary location was [[Century City, Los Angeles]], that had previously been part of the [[20th Century Fox]] [[backlot]] and translated well the bleak future with monochromatic buildings in a sterile [[Modern architecture|ultramodern]] style.<ref name=riots>\"Riots and Revolutions: Confronting the Times\", ''Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'' Blu-Ray</ref>  Also used as a shooting location was the [[University of California, Irvine]], in Orange County.  In addition, TV producer [[Irwin Allen]] contributed [[Theatrical property|props]] and clothes to the film: he let the makers of 'Conquest' borrow his [[USOS Seaview|Seaview]] jumpsuits from ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'', brown clothes and computers and cabinets for Ape Management that were used first on ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' and other sets and props from other Allen productions.\n\nOf the five original films, ''Conquest'' is the only entry filmed in [[Todd-AO 35]] using Arriflex ARRI 35IIC cameras with lenses provided by the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss Group]]; the other ''Apes'' pictures were filmed in [[Panavision]].\n\n===Original opening and ending===\nThe original cut of ''Conquest'' ended with the apes' execution of Governor Breck. After a preview screening in Phoenix on June 1, 1972, the impact of the graphic content caused the producers to rework the film, even though they did not have the budget to do so. [[Roddy McDowall]] recorded a complement to Caesar's final speech, which was portrayed through editing tricks - Caesar being mostly shown through close-ups of his eyes, the gorillas hitting Breck with the butt ends of rifles played backwards to imply they were acquiescing to Caesar's directive of non-violence  - and assured a lower rating.<ref name=riots/> The film's Blu-ray version adds an unrated version, restoring the original ending and many other graphic scenes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Matt|title=Match Cuts: \"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\"|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/08/match-cuts-conquest-of-the-pla|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306014642/https://www.ifc.com/2011/08/match-cuts-conquest-of-the-pla|archive-date=March 6, 2016|access-date=June 30, 2021|work=[[IFC (American TV channel)|IFC]]}}</ref>\n\n''Conquest'' is the only Apes film without a [[Pre-credit|pre-title sequence]].  The film's script and novelization describes a nighttime pre-title scene where police on night patrol shoot an escaping ape and discover that his body is covered with welts and bruises as evidence of severe [[abuse]] (in a later scene Governor Breck refers to the \"ape that physically assaulted his master,\" thereby prompting MacDonald to report that the escape must have been the result of severe mistreatment). The scene appears in the first chapter of [[John Jakes]]' novelization of the film, and in the [[Marvel Comics]] adaption of the film in the early 1970s, both of which were probably based directly on the screenplay and not on the final edit of the actual film. An article in the Summer 1972 issue of ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' (volume 2, issue 2) by Dale Winogura shows and describes the scene being shot,<ref>{{cite news|work=Cinefantastique|title=On the filming of Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes|author=Dale Winogura|date=Summer 1972|volume=2|issue=2|pages=32\u201333|url=http://pota.goatley.com/magazines/cinefantastique-summer-1972.pdf}}</ref> but it is unknown why it was cut. The Blu-ray extended cut does not contain the pre-credit opening.\n\n===Continuity===\nScreenplay writer Paul Dehn, who wrote and co-wrote the sequels, said in interviews with ''Cinefantastique''<ref>{{cite news|work=Cinefantastique|title=Apes, Apes and More Apes|author=Dale Winogura|date=Summer 1972|volume=2|issue=2|pages=26\u201328|url=http://pota.goatley.com/magazines/cinefantastique-summer-1972.pdf}}</ref> (quoted in ''The Planet of the Apes Chronicles'', by Paul Woods) that the story he was writing had a circular timeline:\n\n{{blockquote|The whole thing has become a very logical development in the form of a circle. I have a complete chronology of the time circle mapped out, and when I start a new script, I check every supposition I make against the chart to see if it is correct to use it...While I was out there [in California], Arthur Jacobs said he thought this would be the last so I fitted it together so that it fitted in with the beginning of Apes One, so that the wheel had come full circle and one could stop there quite happily, I think?|January 1972}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Howard Thompson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"J. Lee Thompson's direction furiously propels the action in a compact chromium-and-glass setting\u2014and wait till you see that last battle royal.\"<ref>[[Howard Thompson (film critic)|Thompson, Howard]] (June 30, 1972). \"'Conquest of Planet of Apes' Opens\".

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. p. 18.</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film 2.5 stars out of four, calling it \"excellent in the first half hour,\" but found \"the concluding action sequences run on too long without any original slashing, maiming, or setting on fire.\"<ref>[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (August 8, 1972). \"K.C.

Section 2, p. 5.</ref> [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that the film \"may be the best since No. 1, 'Planet of the Apes',\" calling it \"a self-contained allegory in which man's cruelty to beasts becomes symbolic of man's inhumanity to man. It is a simple but powerful premise, thoroughly developed with a good balance between dialog and action by Dehn and splendidly directed by J. Lee Thompson.\"<ref>[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Thomas, Kevin]] (June 14, 1972). \"'Conquest' No. 4 of 'Apes'\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 19.</ref> Clyde Jeavons of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, \"This comic-book adventure is a far cry from the provocative Pierre Boulle vision so impressively realised by Franklin Schaffner four films ago; and in spite of some crude allegorical pretensions, it can't really be considered seriously as more than another excuse by APJAC to get maximum wear out of an expensive set of costumes.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jeavons |first=Clyde |date=August 1972 |title=Conquest of the Planet of the Apes |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=39 |issue=463 |page=157 }}</ref>\n\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 23 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"''Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'' is as angry and relevant as any of its predecessors, but budget constraints and a stale script rob this revolution of the scope it requires.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Conquest of the Planet of the Apes |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/conquest_of_the_planet_of_the_apes/ |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= September 18, 2022 }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film earned $4.5 million in theatrical rentals at the North American box office.<ref>\"All-time Film Rental Champs\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p 48</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1972]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.foxmovies.com/movies/conquest-of-the-planet-of-the-apes}}\n* {{IMDb title|68408}}\n* {{amg movie|10815}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|conquest_of_the_planet_of_the_apes}}\n* {{mojo title|conquestoftheplanetoftheapes}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Science fiction|Film}}\n{{Planet of the Apes}}\n{{J.
