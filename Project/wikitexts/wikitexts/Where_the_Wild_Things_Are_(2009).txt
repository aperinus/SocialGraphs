Written by Jonze and [[Dave Eggers]], it is based on [[Maurice Sendak]]'s 1963 [[Where the Wild Things Are|children's book of the same name]]. It combines live-action, [[Suitmation|performers in costumes]], [[animatronics]], and [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). The film stars [[Max Records]] and features the voices of [[James Gandolfini]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Lauren Ambrose]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Catherine O'Hara]], and [[Chris Cooper]]. The film centers on a lonely young boy named Max who sails away to an island inhabited by creatures known as the \"Wild Things\", who declare Max their king.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] considered adapting the film as a blend of traditionally animated characters and [[computer generation|computer-generated]] environments, but development did not go past a test film to see how the animation hybridizing would result.<ref name=\"pixar-touch\" /> In 2001, [[Universal Studios]] acquired rights to the book's adaptation and initially attempted to develop a computer-animated adaptation with Disney animator [[Eric Goldberg (animator)|Eric Goldberg]], but the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] concept was replaced with a live-action one in 2003, and Goldberg was dropped for Spike Jonze. The film was co-produced by actor [[Tom Hanks]] through his production company [[Playtone]] and made with an estimated budget of $100 million.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/14/wild.things/index.html | work=CNN | title=Spike Jonze goes 'Where the Wild Things Are' - CNN.com | date=2009-10-14}}</ref> ''Where the Wild Things Are'' was a joint production between Australia, Germany, and the United States, and was filmed principally in [[Melbourne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmedinmelbourne.com.au/wtwta/|title=Film Victoria - Where The Wild Things Are|work=Filmed in Melbourne|access-date= 23 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323075820/http://www.filmedinmelbourne.com.au/wtwta/|archive-date=23 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe film was released on 16 October 2009, in the United States, on 3 December in Australia, and on 17 December in Germany. Despite concerns from within Warner Bros. and news outlets leading up to release over whether or not Spike Jonze's approach to the film was suitable for children, the film was met with positive reviews and appeared on many year-end top ten lists. However, the film was a financial disappointment, grossing just $100 million against a production budget of $100 million. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 2 March 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nMax is a lonely 9-year-old boy<ref>{{Cite web |title=WBshop.com - The Official Online Store of Warner Bros.

His older sister, Claire, does nothing when her friends crush Max's [[snow fort]] with him inside during a snowball fight. Out of frustration, Max messes up her bedroom and destroys a frame he made for her. Later, his mother, Connie, invites her boyfriend Adrian to dinner. Max becomes upset with her for not coming to the fort he made in his room. Wearing his wolf suit, he begins to wreak havoc among the house. As Connie scolds him, he acts up and bites her on the shoulder. She yells at him and he runs away, scared by what transpired. At the edge of a pond, Max finds a small boat that he boards.\n\nEventually, Max reaches an island that is home to a group of seven large monsters called the Wild Things - namely, Carol, Ira, Judith, Alexander, Douglas, the Bull, and KW. Carol is in the middle of a destructive tantrum caused by the departure of KW. Max tries joining in on the mayhem, but finds himself facing the suspicious anger of the Wild Things. When they contemplate eating him, Max convinces them that he is a king with magical powers capable of bringing harmony to the group. They crown him as their new king. Shortly after, KW returns, and Max declares a \"wild rumpus\" in which the Wild Things smash trees and tackle each other, before going to sleep in a pile with Max at the center.\n\nCarol takes Max on a tour of the island, showing him a model he built depicting what he wishes the island looked like. Inspired by this, Max orders the construction of an enormous fort. When KW brings her two [[owl]] friends, Bob and Terry, to the fort, a disagreement ensues as Carol feels they are outsiders. To release their frustrations, Max divides the tribe into \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" for a dirt clod fight. However, Alexander is injured during the game, and Carol berates KW for jokingly stepping on his head, prompting the latter to leave once again.\n\nMax finds Alexander alone in the fort, whereupon he reveals that he knows Max is not a king with magical powers, but warns him never to let Carol know. However, Douglas reveals the truth when Carol throws another tantrum in the middle of the night over the state of the fort and Max's failure to fulfill his duties as a king. Enraged, Carol rips off Douglas's right arm -  though only sand pours from the wound - before chasing Max into the forest and attempting to eat him. Max is saved by KW, who hides him in her stomach. After Carol leaves, KW explains to Max how difficult their lives are, with Carol's tantrums only making matters worse. Max realizes what his mother is going through, and decides to leave the island.\n\nMax finds the crushed remains of Carol's model island and leaves a token of affection for him to find. Max finds Carol and tells him he is going home because he is not a king. The other Wild Things escort Max to his boat. Carol runs to join them after finding Max's token and arrives in time to see him off. He starts to howl and Max howls back; all the other Wild Things join in. Carol looks at KW, and she smiles kindly at him. Returning home, Max is embraced by his mother, who gives him a bowl of soup, a piece of cake, and a glass of milk. She sits with him as he eats and he watches as she falls asleep at the table.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live action===\n* [[Max Records]] as Max, a lonely boy with a wild imagination.\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Connie, Max's mother.\n* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as Adrian, Connie's boyfriend.\n* [[Pepita Emmerichs]] as Claire, Max's older sister.\n* [[Steve Mouzakis]] as Max's teacher.\n* Max Pfeifer, Madeleine Greaves, Joshua Jay, and Ryan Corr as Claire's friends.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[James Gandolfini]] as Carol, the impulsive and short-tempered leader of the Wild Things. \n* [[Lauren Ambrose]] as KW, the loner of the group. \n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Douglas, a [[cockatoo]]-like peace-keeper Wild Thing who is Carol's best friend. \n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Ira, a gentle and soft-spoken Wild Thing.\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Judith, a three-horned [[lion]]-like Wild Thing who is Ira's aggressive and loud girlfriend. \n* [[Paul Dano]] as Alexander, a [[goat]]-like Wild Thing who is constantly ignored, belittled and mistreated. \n* [[Michael Berry Jr.]] as Bernard The Bull, an intimidating and quiet [[cattle|bull]]-like Wild Thing who keeps to himself and rarely speaks.\n* [[Spike Jonze]] as Bob and Terry, two owls that are KW's friends.\n\n===Suit performers===\n* Vincent Crowley as Carol\n* Alice Parkinson as KW\n* John Leary as Douglas\n* Sam Longley as Ira\n* Nick Farnell as Judith\n* Sonny Gerasimowicz as Alexander\n* [[Angus Sampson]] as The Bull\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Where the Wild Things Are'' started its development life in the early 1980s, originally to be an animated feature by Disney that would have blended traditionally animated characters with computer-generated settings.
