However, on the night of the reunion, three intoxicated men attempt to assault Tricia, which leads to him being given a ten-year prison sentence for [[involuntary manslaughter|accidentally killing one of them]]. Eight years later, Poe is [[parole]]d and boards a flight to [[Alabama]] on a [[Fairchild C-123 Provider]] known as the ''Jailbird'', a converted [[Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System|JPATS]] prison transport plane. Accompanying him is his [[diabetic]] cellmate Mike \"Baby-O\" O'Dell.\n\nMost of the inmates boarding the flight are being transferred to a [[supermax prison]]: mass murderer William \"Billy Bedlam\" Bedford, serial rapist John \"Johnny 23\" Baca, [[Black Guerrilla Family|Black Guerrilla]] member Nathan \"Diamond Dog\" Jones, and [[professional criminal]] Cyrus \"The Virus\" Grissom. The flight is overseen by [[U.S. Marshal]] Vince Larkin, who is approached by [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Duncan Malloy and Willie Sims; the latter plans to go [[Undercover operation|undercover]] to get information from drug kingpin Francisco Cindino, who is being picked up en route.\n\nAfter taking off, inmate Joe \"Pinball\" Parker sets another prisoner on fire using smuggled [[kerosene]] as a distraction, allowing Grissom and Diamond Dog to take over the plane. They plan to land at [[Carson Airport]] as scheduled, pick up and transfer other prisoners, and then fly to a non-[[extradition]] country. Sims tries to retake control, but Grissom kills him and takes his gun. Poe and Grissom also put halt to Johnny 23's rape attempts on the plane's female guard, Sally Bishop.\n\nThe plane arrives at Carson City and the inmate exchange commences. The ground crew is unaware that hijackers are disguised as guards and the real guards are forcibly disguised as inmates, gagged to prevent them from revealing the scheme. Amongst the new passengers are Cindino, pilot Earl \"Swamp Thing\" Williams, and [[serial killer]] Garland Greene. The authorities discover the hijacking upon finding evidence in Grissom's old cell and a tape recorder planted by Poe on one of the disguised guards, but are unable to stop the plane from taking off. Meanwhile, Pinball disposes of the plane's [[transponder]], but dies trying to re-board during takeoff.\n\nThe inmates plan to land at Lerner Airfield, an abandoned desert airstrip, and transfer onto another plane owned by Cindino and his [[Drug cartel|cartel]]. Poe finds Pinball's corpse trapped in the landing gear and writes a message to Larkin on the body before throwing it out. Larkin learns of the news and heads to Lerner after contacting the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. Bedford, raiding the cargo, discovers Poe's identity when reading his parole letter and finding the toy bunny Poe intends to give to his daughter, forcing Poe to kill him.\n\nThe ''Jailbird'' is grounded at Lerner, with no sign of the transfer aircraft. Poe warns the others of Cindino's past acts of deceit and betrayal, and thus Grissom orders the others to fuel up the plane and get it ready for takeoff. Poe leaves to find Baby-O a syringe to give him [[insulin]], meeting Larkin and informing him of the situation. They discover Cindino planning to escape on a hidden [[private jet]], which Larkin sabotages. Grissom executes Cindino by igniting the plane's fuel. Meanwhile, Greene encounters a little girl, but resists the urge to kill her.\n\nAs the other inmates prepare the plane, Johnny 23 spots a National Guard convoy approaching and gives the alarm. The inmates find a cache of fully loaded shotguns and rifles in the cargo hold and prepare an ambush. As the National Guard arrives, the inmates launch an assault, resulting in a number of casualties, but Larkin defends the surviving troops using a [[bulldozer]] as a makeshift shield, while the surviving inmates flee back onto the ''Jailbird'' and take flight.\n\nPoe's identity is revealed when Bedford's body is found. Grissom is about to execute him and Baby-O, when Larkin and Malloy arrive in [[attack helicopter]]s, damaging the ''Jailbird''{{'}}s fuel tank. Though Larkin orders the plane to land at [[Harry Reid International Airport|McCarran International Airport]], Swamp Thing is forced to land it on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], causing mass destruction and killing Johnny 23. Grissom, Diamond Dog, and Swamp Thing escape on a [[fire truck]], pursued by Poe and Larkin on police motorcycles; the chase leads to the deaths of all three escapees. Poe and Larkin form a friendship before the former meets his daughter for the first time and gives her the bunny. As the surviving inmates are apprehended, the only one unaccounted for is Garland Greene, who gambles in a casino.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Cameron Poe, a paroled former [[75th Ranger Regiment|Army Ranger]] who works with the authorities to retake the titular flight.\n* [[John Cusack]] as [[U.S. Marshal]] Vince Larkin, a U.S. Marshal who discovers Poe's role in retaking the plane.\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Cyrus \"The Virus\" Grissom, a highly-intelligent career criminal and mastermind of the escape plot.\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Garland \"The Marietta Mangler\" Greene, a notorious [[serial killer]].\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Nathan \"Diamond Dog\" Jones, a [[black nationalist]] convicted of [[terrorism]] and Cyrus' second-in-command.\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Agent Duncan Malloy\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Mike \"Baby-O\" O'Dell, Cameron Poe's diabetic friend and cellmate.\n* [[Rachel Ticotin]] as Guard Sally Bishop, the flight's only female corrections officer who remains protected by Poe after being lusted by Johnny 23.\n* [[Monica Potter]] as Tricia Poe, Cameron Poe's wife.\n* [[Dave Chappelle]] as Joe \"Pinball\" Parker, a low-level inmate convicted of heroin, armed robbery, and arson charges.\n* [[M.
