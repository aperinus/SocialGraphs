Adapted for the screen by Lu Wei based on the novel by [[Lilian Lee]], the film is set in a politically tumultuous 20th-century China, from the early days of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] to the aftermath of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. It chronicles the troubled relationships between two [[Peking opera]] actors and lifelong friends Cheng Dieyi (Cheung) and Duan Xiaolou (Zhang), and Xiaolou's wife Juxian (Gong).\n\nThe film's themes include confusion of identity and blurred lines between real life and the stage, portrayed by the revered opera actor Dieyi, whose unrequited love for Xiaolou persists throughout. Scholar Ying notes that in order \"[to] attract the international audience, Chinese history and Peking Opera are drawn close while homosexuality, individual perversities and moral dilemmas are transposed distant\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ying|first=Liang|title=Making the Familiar Strange and the Strange Familiar-Farewell, My Concubine and Its Crossing National Borders|journal=US-China Foreign Language|volume=9|pages=530\u2013538}}</ref> Commentators also noted themes of political and societal disturbances in 20th-century China, which is typical of the Chinese [[Cinema of China#Rise of the Fifth Generation|Fifth Generation]] cinema.\n\n''Farewell My Concubine'' premiered on January 1, 1993, in [[Hong Kong]]. Upon release, the film received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics and won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]],{{refn|Shared with ''[[The Piano]]''|group=note}} becoming the first Chinese-language film to achieve the honour. It further won accolades including a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]], and received two nominations at the [[66th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\nA few weeks following its China release, the film was abruptly banned by the [[politburo]] unless and until major changes be made. While allowing a premiere in Beijing but forbidding release in other cities, the government objected to the representation of homosexuality, the suicide of a leading character and a description of the turmoil during the Communist period in China.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kristof |first=Nicholas D. |date=1993-08-04 |title=China Bans One of Its Own Films; Cannes Festival Gave It Top Prize |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/04/movies/china-bans-one-of-its-own-films-cannes-festival-gave-it-top-prize.html |access-date=2022-04-02 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThe film was allowed to resume public showings in September 1993, less than a year after its original release.

Douzi has an extra finger causing Master Guan to reject him from joining the troupe. Shortly after, Douzi's mother cuts the extra finger off with a knife, returns him to the troupe with his hand still bleeding, and abandons him. Douzi befriends a fellow student, Shitou.\n\nIn 1932, a teenage Douzi is trained to play [[Dan role|''dan'']] (female roles), while Shitou learns ''[[Jing role|jing]]'' (painted face male roles). When practicing the play \"Dreaming of the World Outside the Nunnery\", Douzi accidentally substitutes \"I am by nature a boy, not a girl,\" for the line \"I am by nature a girl, not a boy\" and is disciplined severely by the instructors. Douzi, along with another student, Laizi, attempts to run away, but Douzi decides to pursue acting seriously after witnessing an opera performance in a theatre. Upon returning, they find the entire troupe being punished for their desertion, and Douzi is beaten. As a result, Laizi hangs himself.\n\nAn agent who provides funding for opera plays, visits the troupe seeking potential actors. When Douzi repeats his previous mistake in front of the agent, Shitou commands him to start over. Douzi finally whispers, \"I am by nature a girl, not a boy.\" He delivers the entire monologue successfully, to the joy of the troupe, and secures the agent. The troupe is invited to perform for [[eunuch]] Zhang. Shitou and Douzi are brought to Zhang's house where they find a finely crafted sword, which Douzi promises to give to Shitou one day. Zhang asks to meet Douzi in his room and sexually assaults him. Douzi does not mention this to anyone, but Shitou implicitly knows what happened. On their way home, Douzi adopts an abandoned baby, who later comes under Master Guan's training.\n[[File:HKCL CWB Red Mission \u5f35\u570b\u69ae\u6b4c\u5f71\u8ff7\u570b\u969b\u806f\u76df Leslie Cheung's Movies \u9738\u738b\u5225\u59ec\u96fb\u5f71 Farewell My Concubine clothing Apr-2013.JPG|thumb|Memorabilia from the film exhibited at \"The Art of Leslie Cheung's Movie Images\", April 2013, [[Hong Kong Central Library]].]]\n\nIn 1937, on the eve of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], Douzi and Shitou become Peking opera stars under stage names Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou, respectively. Their signature performance is the play ''[[The Hegemon-King Bids His Concubine Farewell|Farewell My Concubine]]'', where Dieyi plays the concubine [[Consort Yu (Xiang Yu's wife)|Consort Yu]] and Xiaolou plays the hero [[Xiang Yu]]. Their fame attracts the attention of Yuan Shiqing, a reputable person who attends their performances, and who is enamoured with Dieyi. During a meeting, Dieyi discovers Yuan Shiqing now owns Zhang's sword, which he gifts to Dieyi. Yuan Shiqing compliments his performance but Dieyi is hesitant to develop a romantic relationship with him. The adult Dieyi has an unrequited love for Xiaolou, but Xiaolou marries Juxian, a headstrong courtesan at an upscale brothel, and Dieyi and Xiaolou's relationship begins to fall apart. A love triangle between Dieyi, Xiaolou, and Juxian leads to jealousy and betrayal, which is further complicated by the successive political upheavals following the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. When Master Guan dies, the abandoned baby, now Xiao Si, comes under Dieyi's training to continue learning ''dan'' roles.\n\nWhen the communist forces win the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]], Xiao Si becomes an avid follower of the new government. Dieyi's addiction to opium affects his performances, but he ultimately rehabilitates with the help of Xiaolou and Juxian. Xiao Si nurtures resentment against Dieyi because of his rigorous teaching and usurps his role in ''Farewell My Concubine'' during one performance, without anyone warning Dieyi beforehand. Devastated by the betrayal, Dieyi secludes himself and refuses to reconcile with Xiaolou. As the [[Cultural Revolution]] continues, the entire opera troupe is put on a [[struggle session]] by the [[Red Guards]] where, under pressure, Dieyi and Xiaolou accuse each other of [[Counter-revolutionary|counterrevolutionary]] acts. Dieyi also tells the guards that Juxian was a prostitute. To protect himself from further prosecution, Xiaolou swears that he does not love her and will \"make a clean break\" with her. Juxian is heartbroken and commits suicide. Afterward, Xiao Si is caught by the Red Guards when he is singing Consort Yu's lines to the mirror alone in a practice room.\n\nIn 1977, Dieyi and Xiaolou reunite, seeming to have mended their relationship. They once again practice ''Farewell My Concubine''; Xiaolou begins with the line \"I am by nature a boy,\" to which Dieyi makes the same mistake of finishing with \"I am not a girl.\" As they finish their performance, Dieyi takes Xiaolou's sword and cuts his own throat, paralleling the concubine's final act in the opera. Xiaolou turns around in shock, and calls out Dieyi's name, and before the screen fades to black, he meekly whispers Dieyi's childhood name: Douzi.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Actor !!
