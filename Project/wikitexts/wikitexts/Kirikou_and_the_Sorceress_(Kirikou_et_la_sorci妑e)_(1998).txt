He is not a normal baby, as he can speak before birth and walk immediately after birth. After Kirikou's mother tells him that an evil sorceress, Karaba, has dried up their spring and eaten all the men of the village except for one, he decides to accompany the last warrior, his uncle, to visit her and use intercourse as a means to stop her. Kirikou manages to trick the sorceress and save his uncle by waiting inside his uncle's hat and pretending that it's magic. Additionally, he saves the village's children from being kidnapped both by the sorceress's boat and tree, and kills the monster who was drinking all the village's water, gaining trust and stature in the eyes of the previously skeptical villagers. With the help of his mother and various animals, Kirikou then evades Karaba's watchmen and travels into a forbidden mountain to ask his wise old grandfather about the sorceress. His grandfather tells him that she is evil because she suffers from a poisoned thorn in her back, which causes her great pain and also gives her great power. After learning this, Kirikou manages to take the sorceress's stolen gold, thus luring her outside to where he can trick her and extract the poisoned thorn. As a result, the sorceress is cured of her suffering, and she kisses Kirikou, who then becomes an adult. When Kirikou and Karaba arrive back at the village, no one believes that the sorceress is cured until a procession of drummers arrive with Kirikou's grandfather. The drummers turn out to be the sorceress's watchmen and henchmen restored to their original human forms, the missing men of the village, whom she hadn't eaten after all.\n\n==Cast==\n===French voice cast===\n* [[Doudou Gueye Thiaw]]: Child Kirikou\n* [[Awa Sene Sarr]]: Karaba\n* [[Maimouna N'Diaye]]: Kirikou's mother\n* [[Robert Liensol]]: Kirikou's grandfather\n* [[William Nadylam]]: Adult Kirikou\n* [[S\u00e9bastien H\u00e9brant]]: Adult Kirikou\n* [[R\u00e9mi Bichet]]: Adult Kirikou\n* [[Thilombo Lubambu]]: Kirikou's uncle\n* [[Marie Augustine Diatta]]: the force woman\n* [[Moustafa Diop]]: the fetish on the roof\n* [[Isseu Niang]]: the small woman\n* [[Selly Raby Kane]]: Zo\u00e9, the big girl\n* [[Erick Patrick Correa]]: Boris, the big boy\n* [[Adjoua Barry]]: Boulette, a girl\n* [[Charles Edouard Gomis Correa]]: a boy\n* [[Marie-Louise Shedeye Diiddi]]: the little girl\n* [[Abdoulay\u00e9 Diop Yama]]: the old person\n* [[Josephine Theodora M'Boup]]: a woman\n* [[Tabata N'Diaye]]: the old woman\n* [[Samba Wane]]: fetish talked\n* [[Aminatha N'Diaye]]: a mother\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Chica\u00efa]]: man of the village\n* [[N'Dey\u00e9 A\u00efta N'Diaye]]: woman of the village\n* [[Abdou El Aziz Gueye]]: man of the village\n* [[Boury Kand\u00e9]]: woman of the village\n* [[Assy Dieng B\u00e2]]: Karaba's scream\n* [[Michel Elias]]: animal sounds\n\n===English voice cast===\n* [[Theodore Sibusiso Sibeko]]: Kirikou\n* [[Antoinette Kellermann]]:  Karaba\n* [[Fezile Mpela]]: Uncle\n* [[Kombisile Sangweni]]: The Mother\n* [[Mabutho Kid Sithole]]: The Old Man\n\n===Swahili voice cast===\n* [[Samson Komeka]]: Kirikou\n\n===Japanese voice cast===\n* [[Ryunosuke Kamiki|Ry\u016bnosuke Kamiki]]: Kirikou\n* [[Atsuko Asano]]: Karaba\n* [[Kaori Yamagata]]: Mother\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is a co-production of Les Armateurs, Trans Europe Film, Studio O, [[France 3]] cin\u00e9ma, [[RTBF]] and Exposure in France, Odec Kid Cartoons in [[Belgium]] and Monipoly in [[Luxembourg]].<ref name=Noms /> It was animated at Rija Films' [[animation studio]] in [[Latvia]] and Studio Exist in [[Hungary]], with [[Background artist|backgrounds painted]] at Les Armateurs and Paul Thiltges' animation studio, Tiramisu, in Luxembourg, [[digital ink and paint]] and compositing by Les Armateurs and Odec Kid Cartoons in Belgium and voices and music recorded in [[Senegal]].<ref name=credit>Closing credits of the film.</ref>\n\nThe original French voice acting was performed by a cast of West African actors and schoolchildren and recorded in [[Dakar]].
