A neighbour, whose husband is also in Germany, has fallen pregnant and is trying to lose the baby. Marie helps her successfully. Other women come to her and she starts charging.\n\nWhile talking with Paul following his release, she reveals that a fortune teller saw \"nothing but good things\" in her future, along with a lot of women, which she would not clarify. Marie confesses to wanting to be a famous singer. She has, however, lost her love for her husband, who has been wounded and struggles to stay in employment, and rejects his crude and abrupt sexual demands.\n\nAlthough he cannot find work, he rents a bigger flat at her prompting. Marie continues her illicit business and lets prostitutes use their bedrooms during the day. When one of the abortions goes wrong, the woman dies and her despairing husband commits suicide. Marie shrugs off the tragedy and hires a maid to help. She visits a music teacher, who tells her that she has a great voice.\n\nShe also starts a daytime affair with a collaborator and offers the maid a pay raise if she sleeps with Paul. Paul is unhappy with this arrangement and, after he returns home early and witnesses Marie and her lover asleep together, he sends an anonymous denunciation to the police, alerting them to her illegal activities.\n\nA recent law of the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] r\u00e9gime, determined to enforce morality and stop population decline, has made abortion a treasonable crime. Marie is condemned to death and guillotined.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Isabelle Huppert]] as Marie\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]] as Paul\n* [[Nils Tavernier]] as Lucien\n* [[Marie Trintignant]] as Lulu/Lucie\n* [[Dominique Blanc]] as Jasmine\n* [[Franck de la Personne]] as Martinet\n* [[Anna Mucha]] as Agnes\n* Guillaume Foutrier as Pierrot #1\n* Nicolas Foutrier as Pierrot #2\n* [[Aurore Gauvin]] as Mouche #1\n* [[Lolita Chammah]] as Mouche #2\n* [[Thomas Chabrol]] as the waiter\n* [[Fabienne Chaudat]] as the saleswoman\n}}\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1988, Isabelle Huppert won the Best Actress award at the [[Valladolid International Film Festival]] and the Volpi Cup at the [[Venice Film Festival]].
