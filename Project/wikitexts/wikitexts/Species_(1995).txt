It stars [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Michael Madsen]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Marg Helgenberger]] and [[Natasha Henstridge]] in her film debut role. The film's plot concerns a motley crew of scientists and government agents who try to track down Sil (Henstridge), a seductive [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]-human hybrid, before she successfully mates with a human male.\n\nThe film was conceived by Feldman in 1987, and was originally pitched as a [[film treatment]] in the style of a [[police procedural]], entitled ''The Message''. When ''The Message'' failed to attract the studios, Feldman re-wrote it as a [[spec script]], which ultimately led to the making of the film. The extraterrestrial aspect of Sil's character was created by [[H. R. Giger]], who was also responsible for [[Xenomorph (Alien)|the beings]] from the [[Alien franchise|''Alien'' franchise]]. The effects combined practical models designed by Giger collaborator [[Steve Johnson (special effects artist)|Steve Johnson]] and XFX, with [[computer-generated imagery]] done by [[Richard Edlund]]'s [[Boss Film Studios]]. Giger felt that the film and the character were too similar to ''Alien'', so he pushed for script changes.\n\nMost of the principal photography was done in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where the film is set. Several scenes were filmed in [[Utah]] and at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. ''Species'' was met with mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the film's execution did not match the ambition of its premise, but nevertheless was a box office success, partly due to the hype surrounding Henstridge's nude scenes in various tabloid newspapers and [[lad mags]] of the time, grossing US$113&nbsp;million (${{Inflation|US|113.3|1995|fmt=c}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars). It spawned a [[Species (franchise)|franchise]], which includes one theatrical sequel (''[[Species II]]''), as well as two [[Television film|direct-to-television]] sequels (''[[Species III]]'' and ''[[Species \u2013 The Awakening|Species: The Awakening]]''). ''Species'' was adapted into a novel by [[Yvonne Navarro]] and two comic book series by [[Dark Horse Comics]], one of which was written by Feldman.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[SETI]] program, Earth's scientists send out transmissions (shown to be the [[Arecibo message]]) with information about Earth and its inhabitants, DNA structure, etc., in hopes of finding life beyond Earth. They then receive transmissions from an alien source on how to create endless fuel effortlessly. Therefore, the scientists assume that this is a friendly alien species. From a second alien transmission, the scientists receive information about an alien [[DNA]] along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. A government team led by Xavier Fitch goes forward with the genetic experiment attempting to induce a female, under the (later proved to be mistaken) assumption that a female would have \"more docile and controllable\" traits. One of the hundred experimental ova produces a girl named Sil, who looks like a normal human but develops into a 12-year-old in 3 months.\n\nSil's violent outbursts during sleep make the scientists consider her a threat. One day they try to kill her using [[cyanide]] gas, but she breaks out of her containment cell and escapes. The government assembles a team composed of [[anthropologist]] Dr. Stephen Arden, [[molecular biologist]] Dr. Laura Baker, \"[[telepath|empath]]\" Dan Smithson and [[mercenary]] Preston \"Press\" Lennox to track and destroy Sil. Sil matures rapidly into an adult in her early twenties and makes her way to Los Angeles. Her body strength, regenerative ability and intelligence make tracking her extremely difficult. The scientists fear she may mate with human males and produce offspring that could eventually eliminate the human race. Sil is intent on producing offspring as soon as possible, and kills several people to prevent them from notifying the authorities or simply to use their clothing.\n\nShe first tries to mate with Robbie, but after sensing that he is [[diabetic]], she rejects him. Unsatisfied, he tries to [[Rape|assault]] her, prompting her to kill him by puncturing through his [[pharynx]] with her tongue. Later she tries to mate with John Carey, a man she meets after a car accident. They swim in Carey's hottub where Sil forces him to open his swimming trunks in order to mate, but he refuses. This act is interrupted by Preston and Laura. She soon kills Carey, morphing into her alien form, a [[bipedal]] mutant with tentacles on her shoulders and back, and flees naked into a forest without being seen by the team. She pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman in order to assume her identity. Sitting in the car near Carey's home, she reads Fitch's lips, as she had done earlier, learning of their plan to stake out the nightclub for her return. There, she is seen by Dan, prompting a car chase. She fakes her death by crashing the car, which she has previously filled with gasoline containers, into a high-voltage transformer, using the kidnapped woman as a stand-in for her own body.\n\nAfter cutting and dyeing her hair, Sil takes an attraction to Preston, having dreamt of him the previous night. After the team celebrates their apparent victory, she stalks them in their hotel, and they do not recognize her. Arden, who is upset at being single, walks into his room to find Sil waiting there. She has intercourse with Arden, which results in her instantly getting impregnated by him, then kills him when he realizes who she is. Dan senses that Sil is in the hotel and he alerts Preston, Laura, and the rest of the team. She morphs again, escapes and they follow her into the sewers where Fitch is subsequently killed. Sil gives birth, and Dan finds her offspring in a cavern behind the sewers. The child morphs into alien form and attacks him and he incinerates it. Preston blows off Sil's head with a shotgun. The trio leaves the area. The last scene shows a rat chewing on one of Sil's severed tentacles; it starts to mutate into a vicious beast and devours another rat.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Natasha Henstridge]] as Sil\n**[[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Young Sil\n** [[Dana Hee]] as Alien Sil\n** [[Frank Welker]] as Alien Sil (voice)\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Xavier Fitch\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Preston \"Press\" Lennox\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Dr. Stephen Arden\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Dan Smithson\n* [[Marg Helgenberger]] as Dr. Laura Baker\n* [[Whip Hubley]] as John Carey\n* [[Anthony Guidera]] as Robbie\n* [[Matthew Ashford]] as Man In Club\n* Kurtis Burow as Baby Boy, Sil's Offspring\n\n==Influence and themes==\nSince Sil grows rapidly and kills humans with ease, at a certain point film character Dr. Laura Baker speculates if she was a biological weapon sent by a species who thought humans were like an intergalactic [[weed]]. Feldman declared that he wanted to explore this theme further in the script, as it discussed mankind's place in the universe and how other civilizations would perceive and relate to humanity, considering that \"maybe [humans are] not a potential threat, maybe a competitor, maybe a resource\".<ref name=dvd1/> He also declared that more could be said about Sil's existentialist doubts, as she does not know her origin or purpose, and only follows her instinct to mate and perpetuate the species.<ref name=dvd1/>\n\nWriting for the ''[[Journal of Popular Film & Television]]'', Susan George authored a paper that dealt with the portrayal of procreation in ''Species'', ''[[Gattaca]]'' and ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]''. George compares the character of Fitch to \"an updated [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]\",<ref name=\"george-2001\"/> and explores the development of Sil's maternal aspirations, which convert the character into an \"[[archaic mother]]\" figure similar to the [[Xenomorph (Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] creature in the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' series, both of which are, she claims, portrayed negatively.<ref name=\"george-2001\">{{cite journal |title=Not exactly 'of woman born': Procreation and creation in recent science fiction films |last=George |first=Susan A. |journal=Journal of Popular Film & Television |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=176\u201383 |year=2001 |doi=10.1080/01956050109602839|s2cid=191567924 }}</ref> George further states that a recurring theme in science fiction films is a response to \"this kind of powerful [[female sexuality]] and 'alien-ness{{'\"}} in that \"the feminine monster must die as Sil does at the end of ''Species''\".<ref name=\"george-2001\"/> Feldman himself considered that an underlying theme regarded \"a female arriving and seeking to find a superior mate\".<ref name=dvd1/>\n\nA five-year investigation into accounts of the [[chupacabra]], a well known [[cryptid]], revealed that the original sighting report of the creature in [[Puerto Rico]] by Madeline Tolentino may have been inspired by the character Sil.

The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms.<ref name=log/> Mankind has sent to space transmissions \"giving out directions\" such as the [[Arecibo message]], which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space.

Eventually Feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues, and instead changed the protagonists to a government team. After coining the name \"Sil\", Feldman initially thought of forming an [[acronym]], but in the end chose only the three-letter name after learning about the codons of the [[genetic code]], which can be represented in groups of three letters. Sil would originally emerge from a DNA sequence manipulating human DNA, and constantly mutate as she used the human [[junk DNA]] to access \"all the defenses of the entire animal kingdom that [humans] evolved through \u2013 including ones that had never developed, plus ones [Earth's scientists] don't know about that have become extinct\".<ref name=log/> Among the research Feldman did for the script included going to sessions of [[UCLA]]'s Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life (CSEOL), talking to [[SETI]] scientists, and visiting the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] to talk with researchers working on the [[Human Genome Project]].<ref name=dvd1/> ''The Message'' was offered to several studios, but was passed up.<ref name=des>{{cite book|author=Giger, H.R. |title=Species Design|publisher=Morpheus International|year=1996|isbn=1-883398-12-6}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Feldman reworked his ideas into a [[spec script]].<ref name=des/> This was sent to producer [[Frank Mancuso, Jr.]], who had hired Feldman to adapt [[Sidney Kirkpatrick]]'s ''A Cast of Killers''.<ref name=origin/> The producer got attracted to the creative possibilities as the film offered \"the challenge of walking that fine line between [[suspension of disbelief|believability]] and pushing something as far as it can go\".<ref name=notes1/> [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] got interested on the project, and while Feldman had some initial disagreements on the budget, after considering other studios he signed with MGM.<ref name=log/> In turn, the now retitled ''Species'' attracted director [[Roger Donaldson]], who was attracted to its blend of science fiction and thriller. The script underwent eight different drafts, written over an eight-month period, before Donaldson was content that flaws in the story's logic had been corrected. At one point another writer, [[Larry Gross]], tried his hand with the script, but ultimately all the work was done by Feldman.<ref name=\"origin\"/> Feldman would remain as a co-producer. While the initial ''Species'' script suggested a [[love triangle]] between Sil and two government team members, the dissatisfaction of the crew eventually led to changes to the ending, which ended up featuring Sil having a baby that would immediately prove dangerous.<ref name=dvd1/>\n\nWhen Donaldson was announced as the director in 1994, Mancuso stated that most of the $35&nbsp;million budget would be spent on effects, as \"it's not a movie that calls for stars. We're going to try and put as much money as we can below the line and allow the effects and the creature to be the highlights of the film\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/donaldson-on-mgm-pic-120093/|title=Donaldson on MGM pic|date=April 13, 1994|first=Dan|last=Cox|access-date=January 27, 2018|archive-date=January 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128132736/https://variety.com/1994/film/news/donaldson-on-mgm-pic-120093/|url-status=live}}</ref> The lesser emphasis on actors included a newcomer as the human version of the creature, Sil, former model [[Natasha Henstridge]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.littlegiger.com/articles/files/FemmeFatales_4_8.pdf|title=Natasha Henstridge - Species' Sexy Seductress|magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]|author=Scapperotti, Dan|date=June 1996|volume=4|issue=8|access-date=2018-01-27|archive-date=2018-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128134243/https://www.littlegiger.com/articles/files/FemmeFatales_4_8.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Design===\n[[File:HR Giger Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|[[H. R. Giger]] with a Sil sculpture.]]\nSil was designed by Swiss artist [[H. R. Giger]], who also created the [[Xenomorph (Alien)|creature]]s in the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films. Donaldson thought Giger was the best man for the film after reading his compendium ''[[Necronomicon (H. R. Giger)|Necronomicon]]'', and eventually he and Mancuso flew to Switzerland to meet the artist. What attracted Giger was the opportunity to design \"a monster in another way\u2014an aesthetic warrior, also sensual and deadly, like the women look in [his] paintings\".<ref name=origin /> While Giger opted to stay in Switzerland to take care of his dying mother instead of flying to Los Angeles to accompany production, he built some puppets in his own studio, and later faxed sketches and airbrush paintings as production went through.<ref name=origin/>\n\nThe practical models were made by [[Steve Johnson (special effects artist)|Steve Johnson]] and his company XFX, which had already worked with Giger's designs in ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side]]''. Giger had envisioned more stages of Sil's transformation, but the film only employed the last one, where she is \"transparent outside and black inside\u2014like a glass body but with carbon inside\",<ref name=building>{{cite journal|last1=Robley|first1=Les Paul|title=Building Giger's alien|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=March 1996|volume=27|issue=7|pages=23\u201328|url=http://www.littlegiger.com/articles/files/Cinefantastique_27_7.pdf|access-date=September 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911053747/http://www.littlegiger.com/articles/files/Cinefantastique_27_7.pdf|archive-date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> with XFX doing the translucent skin based on what they had done for the aliens of ''[[The Abyss]]''. Sil's alien form had both full-body animatronics with replaceable arms, heads and torsos, and a body suit.<ref name=building/> [[Richard Edlund]]'s [[Boss Film Studios]] was hired for over 50 shots of [[computer-generated imagery]], which included one of the earliest forms of [[motion capture]] effects. Using a two-foot-high (60&nbsp;cm) electric puppet that had sensors translating its movements to a digital Sil, Boss Films managed to achieve in one day what would have once taken as much as three weeks with practical effects.<ref name=notes1/>\n\nGiger was unhappy with some elements he found to bear similarity with other films, particularly the ''Alien'' franchise. At one point he sent a fax to Mancuso finding five similarities: a \"chestburster\" (as Sil giving birth echoed the infant Alien breaking out of its host's chest), the creature having a punching tongue (Giger at first wanted Sil's tongue to be composed of barbed hooks), a cocoon, the use of flame throwers, and having Giger as the creature designer. A great point of contention was the ending, which Giger considered derivative from the climaxes from both ''[[Alien 3]]'' and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. The designer felt that horror films frequently held some final confrontation with fire, which he considered old-fashioned and linked to [[Witch trials in the early modern period|medieval witch trial]]s. He sent some ideas for the climax to the producers, with them accepting to have Sil's ultimate death occurring by headshot.<ref name=origin/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming happened mostly in Los Angeles, including location shooting at [[Sunset Strip]], [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]], [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], the [[Hollywood Hills]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]]. Id Club, the nightclub featured in the film, was built within Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theater]], while the hills above [[Dodger Stadium]] near [[Elysian Park]] were used for the car chase and crash where Sil fakes her death. For the opening scenes in [[Utah]], the [[Tooele Army Depot]] dubbed as the outside of the research facility\u2014the interiors were shot at the [[Rockwell International Corporation]] laboratory in California\u2014and a [[Victorian-era]] train station in [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]] was part of Sil's escape. Other locations included the  [[Santa Monica Pier]] and the [[Arecibo Telescope]] in [[Puerto Rico]]. The most complex sets involved the sewer complex and a tar-filled granite cavern where the ending occurs. Donaldson wanted a maze quality for the sewers, which had traces of realism (such as tree roots breaking through from the ceiling) and artistic licenses. Production designer John Muto intentionally designed the sewers wider and taller than real ones, as well as with walkways, but nevertheless aiming for a claustrophobic and realistic atmosphere. The tunnels were built out of structural steel, metal rod, plaster and concrete to endure the fire effects, and had its design based on the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], with Muto describing them as \"just the sort of place in which a creature from another planet might feel at home\".<ref name=notes2>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgm.com/species/inventory_species/prod_unnat.html |title=An Unnatural Habitat |access-date=2013-09-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970329210744/http://www.mgm.com/species/inventory_species/prod_unnat.html |archive-date=March 29, 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Species'' received a wide theatrical release on July 7, 1995.
