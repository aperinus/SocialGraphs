''Onegin'' is [[Martha Fiennes]]' [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] and stars her brother [[Ralph Fiennes]] in the role of Yevgeny (Eugene) Onegin, [[Liv Tyler]] as Tatiana, [[Irene Worth]] as Princess Alina and [[Toby Stephens]] as Lensky. Two other Fiennes siblings were involved in the project: [[Magnus Fiennes]] wrote the music and [[Sophie Fiennes]] appeared in a minor role.\n\n==Plot==\nIn early 19th century [[Russian Empire|Russia]], a bored [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] socialite named Onegin inherits his uncle's estate in the country. There, he meets a neighbouring landowner and aspiring poet, Lensky, and a widowed mother and her two daughters. The poet is engaged to the elder daughter Olga. Her sister, Tatiana (Tanya), writes Onegin a passionate love letter but he turns her down because of her youth and inexperience. He instead dances with her sister, which the jealous Lensky interprets as flirtation, and challenges his friend to a duel. The duel is arranged to take place in a secluded place by a local lake, and unknown to the participants, Tatiana secretly witnesses the duel from a safe distance. She observes Lensky taking the first shot and missing, followed by Onegin taking careful aim and disposing of Lensky with a shot to his opponent's head.\n\nOnegin  departs from his country estate. Six years later, he returns to St Petersburg, he encounters Tatiana, the woman whom he spurned, who is now a woman of refinement and married to a prince. Onegin immediately sees Tanya as desirable, and falls in love with her. He begs her forgiveness for his past behaviour.  Tanya refuses Onegin, explaining to him that he has missed his chance with her; she will be faithful to her husband. He receives her rejection with despair.<ref name=\"Onegin &#124; BFI &#124; BFI\">{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8107d6b6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721035708/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8107d6b6 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-21 |title=Onegin &#124; BFI &#124; BFI |publisher=Explore.bfi.org.uk |access-date=2014-03-07}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[Ralph Fiennes]] as Yevgeny Onegin \n*[[Liv Tyler]] as Tatyana Larina\n*[[Toby Stephens]] as Vladimir Lensky\n*[[Lena Headey]] as Olga Larina\n*[[Martin Donovan]] as Prince Nikitin\n*[[Alun Armstrong]] as Zaretsky\n*[[Harriet Walter]] as Madame Larina\n*[[Irene Worth]] as Princess Alina\n*[[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]] as Guillot\n*[[Simon McBurney]] as Triquet \n*Gwenllian Davies as Anisia\n*Margery Withers as Nanya\n*[[Geoffrey McGivern|Geoff McGivern]] as Andrey Petrovitch\n\n==Reception==\n''Onegin'' received mixed reviews, with praise for its production values and performances, but criticism was leveled at the pacing and writing. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' said, 'There is a cool, mannered elegance to the picture that I like, but it's dead at its center. There is no feeling that real feelings are at risk here.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/onegin-2000|title=Onegin Movie Review & Film Summary (2000) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|access-date=8 July 2018}}</ref> [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, \"An earnest but worthwhile attempt to render the Russian writer's tragic and romantic verse novel of 1833 for the screen... we are estranged from the distinctively comic savour of the original.
