But \"comedy film\" is not a main genre. Please do not add a single genre or repeating at cost. --> directed by [[Pete Docter]] from a screenplay he co-wrote with [[Meg LeFauve]] and [[Josh Cooley]]. Produced by [[Pixar Animation Studios]], it stars the voices of <!--In order of end credits and Template:Infobox film documentation-->[[Amy Poehler]], [[Phyllis Smith]], [[Richard Kind]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Lewis Black]], [[Mindy Kaling]], Kaitlyn Dias, [[Diane Lane]], and [[Kyle MacLachlan]]. The film follows the inner workings inside the mind of a young girl named Riley, as five personified emotions administer her thoughts and actions as she adapts to her family's relocation.\n\nDocter conceived ''Inside Out'' in late 2009 after noticing changes in his daughter's personality as she grew older, and it was subsequently [[green-light]]ed. Based on the remembrances of Docter and the film's co-writer and co-director [[Ronnie del Carmen]], they adopted an idea involving emotions for the film. During production, the filmmakers consulted psychologists and neuroscientists in order to achieve greater accuracy in their portrayal of the mind. Development on ''Inside Out'' lasted for five and a half years, on an approximate $175{{nbsp}}million budget, and the film faced production difficulties, including story changes.\n\n''Inside Out'' debuted out of competition at the [[68th Cannes Film Festival]] on May 18, 2015, and was released in the United States on June 19. The film received <!--Do not change to \"acclaim\" or \"acclaimed\" per MOS:PUFFERY-->positive reviews<!--Do not change to \"acclaim\" or \"acclaimed\" per MOS:PUFFERY--> for its craftsmanship, screenplay, subject matter, plot, and vocal performances (particularly those of Poehler, Smith, Kind, and Black). Organizations like the [[National Board of Review]] and the [[American Film Institute]] named it as one of the top ten films of 2015. ''Inside Out'' earned $858.8{{nbsp}}million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2015]]. The film was nominated for two awards at the [[88th Academy Awards]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], and received [[List of accolades received by Inside Out (2015 film)|numerous other accolades]]. A sequel, ''Inside Out 2'', is scheduled to be released in 2024.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nWithin the mind of a young girl named Riley are the basic emotions that control her actions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Her experiences become memories, stored as colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. The aspects of five most important \"core memories\" within her personality incorporate the form of five floating islands. Joy acts as the leader, and she and the rest of the emotions try to limit Sadness's influence.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves from [[Minnesota]] to [[San Francisco]] for her father's new job. She at first has poor experiences: the new house is cramped and old, her father hardly has any time for her, a local pizza parlor only serves pizza topped with broccoli (which Riley dislikes), and the moving van with their belongings ends up in Texas and will not arrive for weeks. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively turns joyous memories sad, which causes Riley to cry in front of her class and creates a sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it by using a [[pneumatic tube|vacuum tube]], but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters.\n\nIn Joy and Sadness's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to take control of Riley with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. Her disused personality islands gradually crumble, and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where things fade to non-existence as they are forgotten. Finally, Anger resolves to return to Minnesota, believing it will restore Riley's happiness.\n\nWhile navigating the vast long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. After several adventures and mishaps, the trio eventually catch the train; however, it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely with the collapse of another island. Afraid that all the core memories will become sad, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to the Headquarters. The ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and sending Joy and Bing Bong plunging into the Memory Dump. \n\nAfter discovering a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her, Joy understands Sadness's purpose: alerting others when Riley is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket, which gets energy when the rider sings, to escape the Memory Dump, but are unable to fly high enough due to their combined weight. On their last attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, and fades away.\n \nJoy reunites with Sadness and they return to Headquarters, discovering that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic as she boards a bus to Minnesota. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness re-installs the core memories, transforming them from happy to sad, Riley tearfully confesses to her parents that she misses her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory consisting of happiness and sadness; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n \nA year later, Riley, now at the age of 12, has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and are given a newly expanded console with room for them all to work together. In a [[mid-credits scene]], the audience is given a glimpse into the \"headquarters\" of various people throughout the city.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--In order of end credits-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Amy Poehler]] as Joy\n* [[Phyllis Smith]] as Sadness\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Bing Bong\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Fear\n* [[Lewis Black]] as Anger\n* [[Mindy Kaling]] as Disgust\n* Kaitlyn Dias as Riley\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Mom\n* [[Kyle MacLachlan]] as Dad\n* [[Paula Poundstone]] as Forgetter Paula\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as Forgetter Bobby\n* [[Paula Pell]] as the dream director and Mom's Anger\n* [[Dave Goelz]] as Subconscious Guard Frank \n* [[Frank Oz]] as Subconscious Guard Dave\n* [[Josh Cooley]] as Jangles\n* [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] as Mind Worker Cop Jake\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fritz\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] as a helicopter pilot\n* [[Peter Sagal]] as Clown's Joy\n* [[Rashida Jones]] as Cool Girl's emotions\n}}\n\n==Themes and analysis==\nThe main theme of ''Inside Out'' are the consequences and portrayal of emotions and memories.<ref name=\"WaPoThemes\" /><ref name=\"NerdistThemes\" /><ref name=\"NPRThemes\" /> Those depicted in the film are \"honest\" and \"generous\";<ref name=\"NerdistThemes\" /><ref name=\"FastCompanyThemes\" /> their goal is maintaining Riley's life.<ref name=\"DeseretThemes\" /> Natasha Moore of the Australian [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] detailed the film's theme: \"[If] Riley's carefree life gets more complicated, [...] Joy's attempts to deliver uninterrupted happiness become increasingly neurotic.\"<ref name=\"ABCNewsAustraliaThemes\" /> [[Nicole Markotic]] argued that the film explores the relationship between \"the many and the one\", demonstrating that people have \"composite\" personalities. The different components of one person's personality are vital for that person's \"emotional and psychological balance\". Depression and sadness are distinct in the film, and this distinction is meant to \"[offer] individuals strategies to avoid suppressing crucial feelings\".{{sfn|Markoti\u0107|2019|p=163}} Writing in the British Journal of Psychiatry, Hannah Marcarian and Paul O.

Primatologist Louise Barrett thought the film showed disconnection between characters who are not relating to each other, or to their own emotions; but moments of personal harmony lead to positive interpersonal connections.<ref name=\"USATodayBettelheim\" /> According to ''USA Today''{{'}}s Jamie Altman, the film shows that major environmental changes can be \"difficult, but not impossible, to overcome\", recommending it to college students experiencing homesickness or sadness.<ref name=\"USATodayAltman\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{multiple image \n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = [[Pete Docter]] (left) and [[Ronnie del Carmen]] in 2009\n| image1 = Pete Docter cropped 2009.jpg\n| alt1 = Headshot of Pete Docter\n| image2 = Ronnie del Carmen.jpg\n| alt2 = Headshot of Ronnie del Carmen\n}}\nThe development of ''Inside Out'' began in late 2009, when director [[Pete Docter]] felt anxiety about his adolescent daughter Elie's progressing introversion.<ref name=\"DOGInterviewDelCarmen\" /><ref name=\"NYTBarnes\" /><ref name=\"TheVergeInterview\" /> Docter approached [[Ronnie del Carmen]] to become a co-director, and he eventually accepted the offer, citing his \"accidental\" animation work.<ref name=\"PDIDelCarmen1\" /><ref name=\"PDIDelCarmen2\" /> They relived their past experiences and histories to adopt an idea involving emotions for the film,<ref name=\"RapplerDelCarmen\" /> aiming to depict them with strong, caricatured personalities.<ref name=\"NPR\" /> Docter had decided to make it after del Carmen determined most of the film's aspects had narrow appeal.<ref name=\"ColliderMakingOf\" />\n\nThe directors and producer [[Jonas Rivera]] researched the mind with the help of psychologist [[Paul Ekman]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] professor of psychology [[Dacher Keltner]].<ref name=\"NPR\" /> [[Pixar]] animator Dan Holland and his team allowed some psychologists and specialists to accurately develop the film's story.<ref name=\"TheDPBTS\" /> Production designer [[Ralph Eggleston]] authorized neuroscientists to design the locations in Riley's mind using DNA-based cues and photographs of neuronal flashes.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> In Keltner and Ekman's opinion, they emphasized the emotions' formation of social lives and interactions, which can moderate themselves.<ref name=\"NYTScience\" />\n\nWhile Keltner focused on Sadness that strengthens relationships, Ekman identified seven emotions with \"universal signals\" early: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, contempt, and surprise. Therefore, Docter removed surprise from ''Inside Out'' after he corroborated that it and fear were similar; contempt was abandoned also by the filmmakers. Two of Joy's initial names, happiness and an unrelated optimism, were combined with Joy.<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"PostMagazine\" /><ref name=\"KGO-TV\" /> A total of 26 emotions, including irritation, envy, greed, gloom, despair, depression, love, schadenfreude, ennui, shame, embarrassment, and hope, were considered for the film before reducing to their possible value.<ref name=\"USATodayMissingEmotions\" /><ref name=\"PolygonMissingEmotions\" /><ref name=\"IGNMissingEmotions\" /> Its finalized, streamlined scope featured a condensed story and the emotions' traits.<ref name=\"USATodayMissingEmotions\" />\n\n''Inside Out'' was [[green-lit]] in October 2009, after Docter was interested in forming the main character's story arc.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> Chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]] offered little input on the film due to his focus on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], and it was the first for Pixar without involvement of co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011.<ref name=\"NYTBarnes\" /> Executives at [[Disney]] and Pixar were positive at Docter's proposal, but acknowledged it was difficult to advertise.<ref name=\"ColliderMakingOf\" /><ref name=\"UpsideDown\" /> The film spent five and a half years in development,<ref name=\"APMakingOf\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilm40Things\" /> with an approximate $175{{nbsp}}million budget.<ref name=\"DeadlineProfitAnalysisFinal\" /> Docter and Eggleston described this an intricate and lengthy process.<ref name=\"APMakingOf\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilm40Things\" /> As such, first-time directors were likely ineligible to work on the film.{{sfn|Diamond|2019|p=130}}\n\n===Writing===\nIn 2010, Docter and the filmmaking team met to discuss aspects about ''Inside Out'', including its setting, rules, and reels. Docter then recruited a small story team to develop the film's plotline and design its characters within 12 months;<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /><ref name=\"LATimesInsideOutBTS\" /><ref name=\"AnneThompson\" /> their main challenge was to deal with its multilayered technique.<ref name=\"NewGround\" /> Though the film's script was deemed ambitious and ingenious, screenwriter [[Michael Arndt]] spent a year on it before leaving the project in early 2011;<ref name=\"FilmScript\" /> he was attributed with additional story material.<ref name=\"MetacriticCast\" />\n\nTo promote diverse input, half of the story team were women, at a time when the animation industry consisted largely of men. Although ''Inside Out''{{'s}} focus was about a girl, research found that females age 11 to 17 were more attuned to expressions and emotions than younger girls.<ref name=\"WomenAndHollywood\" /> Docter decided that Riley was not a main character, but her role as a setting.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> He considered the lead emotion as female, since Riley had the same gender. Other emotions were assigned between male and female.<ref name=\"USATodayEmotions\" /> Del Carmen influenced the film's story development based around his upbringing,<ref name=\"GMANewsDelCarmen\" /> and preferred the idea of hockey's popularity in Minnesota, becoming a core concept.<ref name=\"WomenAndHollywood\" /> Docter also discarded an initial idea about Riley falling into a deep depression.<ref name=\"NYTBarnes\" /> Creation of [[storyboard]]s for ''Inside Out'' took two to three years, and included seven to eight screenings for Pixar's \"brain trust\" (a small group of creative leaders who oversee its development on all films).<ref name=\"SecretReveal\" />\n\nThe filmmakers were responsible for expressing the characters' personal traits, talents,<ref name=\"THRMakingOf\" /> and contrasts.<ref name=\"WomenAndHollywood\" /> ''Inside Out''{{'s}} design team researched more of her personality's distinct directions, after Docter was concerned over Joy's displeasure. Designer Albert Lozano wanted Joy with tomboyish and \"mischievous\" characteristics.<ref name=\"EWDocterMostDifficult\" /> [[Amy Poehler]] helped the team to write Joy, illustrating a broad range of happiness after facing difficulties. With LeFauve's help, the team envisioned Joy as vulnerable and intangible because she was \"unapologetically positive\".<ref name=\"LATimesInsideOutBTS\" /><ref name=\"LisaMiller\" /> From the outset, the idea persisted about Joy's potential to excessively manipulate youth, setting off Riley's \"social storms\".<ref name=\"Moviefone\" />\n\nIn one instance, Riley was to have wanted the lead role as a turkey in a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant. Ultimately, Docter found that plot idea to be too unfamiliar, and sought something to replace it. Several drafts emerged, including: the characters cultivating ideas after falling to \"Idea Fields\";<ref name=\"SlashfilmDocterRiveraTalk\" /> and Bing Bong recruiting at a large, exiled entourage from Riley's childhood. [[Richard Kind]] later defined his character as \"the fading of childhood\" when ''Inside Out''{{'s}} development had progressed.<ref name=\"USATodayBingBong\" /> In October 2011, [[Diane Disney Miller]] convinced Docter to reduce ''Inside Out''{{'s}} distractions and reprioritize the story.<ref name=\"LATimesInsideOutBTS\" /> Docter determined that the concept of personality islands could integrate the mind world's geography and story.<ref name=\"SlashfilmDocterRiveraTalk\" />\n\nIn 2012, the film was put into production<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> after several screenings and suggestions, and evaluated after three months. Editor Kevin Nolting said that seven versions of the film were created before the production began.<ref name=\"SecretReveal\" /> The difficult part was to balance the film's tone, for example, how viewers would respond to Joy's cheerful nature while feeling negative about the mess that Joy manipulated in Riley. Rivera credited Poehler for fleshing out these aspects of Joy's nature.<ref name=\"Moviefone\" /> Eggleston recommended that the film be set to take place in the mind rather than in the brain,<ref name=\"AWNEggleston\" /> as such a few scenes about the brain were dropped.<ref name=\"THRMakingOf\" />\n\nAn early version of ''Inside Out'' focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together. In July 2012, Pixar filmmakers held an evaluation screening of the film. Docter came to find that storyline nonfunctional, and was reluctant to be fired. In 2013, Docter was still unsure about what Joy had learned from Fear to develop her characterization,<ref name=\"THRMakingOf\" /> eventually reached a breakthrough to integrate emotions and relationships within the film.<ref name=\"UpsideDown\" /> Storyboarding was reworked to replace Fear with Sadness and give Sadness a \"much juicier\" role.<ref name=\"THRMakingOf\" /> Docter's altercation between Joy and Sadness lacked the film's emotional ending. To address the issue, he changed a scene where Riley separating her friend in its subsequent portions. Islands of Friendship and Personality became Joy and Sadness's outings in the film to maintain its [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].<ref name=\"AdultAppeal\" />\n\nOver the course of storyboarding, 27 sequences and 178,128 outlines were developed,<ref name=\"LATimesInsideOutBTS\" /> with 127,781 remaining upon completion.<ref name=\"THRMakingOf\" /> According to Cooley, 10 plot rewrites of ''Inside Out'' and 10 unabridged scenes of Riley\u2019s mind were made.<ref name=\"AdultAppeal\" /> Initial storyboarding differentiated the importance of Riley's story arc than emotions, but Rivera considered the film's balance was \"about 75 percent inside, 25 percent out\".<ref name=\"NewGround\" /> In early 2013, the filmmakers made seven to eight distinct openings for the film.<ref name=\"LATimesInsideOutBTS\" /> The brain trust eventually [[Picture lock|locked the picture]] and its story.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> After Cooley and [[Meg LeFauve]] contributed the film's rewrite, they were credited as screenwriters. Docter, Cooley, and LeFauve worked on experiences with raising their own children into the screenplay. Cooley highlighted these as emotions and subsequently created them.<ref name=\"McKittrick\" /> Production of the film concluded in May 2015,<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> after three years.<ref name=\"PostMagazine\" />\n\n===Casting===\nVoice recording began in 2013 and ended in 2014.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> As ''Inside Out'' contained several veterans of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''), the film's team spent a week at that program for research on a live television sequence.<ref name=\"PeopleMagazine\" /> Poehler and [[Phyllis Smith]] had three voice recording sessions.<ref name=\"PoehlerSmithLATimes\" /> Sadness's appearance was inspired by Smith.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> Once Smith got a call for traveling to Pixar's headquarters in [[Emeryville, California]], Rivera chose her after watching a lunch scene in ''[[Bad Teacher]]'' (2011). He contacted Docter and remarked, \"I think we found our Sadness.\" Poehler was hired as the last of the emotions' cast.<ref name=\"PoehlerSmithLATimes\" />\n\nFear was inspired by [[Don Knotts]]. According to Lozano, Knotts had wide eyes. Docter said, \"[He] was the kind of guy who could bring sophistication and then flip on a dime\".<ref name=\"USATodayEmotions\" /> [[Bill Hader]] was cast as Fear<ref name=\"PeopleMagazine\" /> after he and the filmmakers visited the set of ''SNL'' in New York City for a week,<ref name=\"KGO-TV\" /> and also assisted at the story room. His casting was assumed until his stay ended, but he asked to contact fellow ''SNL'' veteran Poehler<ref name=\"WaPoHaderFear\" /> that it was secret. Hader later reaffirmed his involvement in ''Inside Out''. In all recording sessions, he instructed his screaming voice for his role of Fear.<ref name=\"HuffPostEyeOpening\" />\n\nWhen the story was [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]]ed by [[Mindy Kaling]], she said that it sounded \"really beautiful\" and joined the cast.<ref name=\"NPR\" /> Disgust was described as akin to the looks of [[April Ludgate]] and [[Veruca Salt (character)|Veruca Salt]].<ref name=\"CharacterInspirations\" /> Docter exemplified [[Lewis Black]] for Anger, and was perfect for the role after the filmmakers kept him in mind as expected, having realized Black's voice.<ref name=\"KGO-TV\" /> Kind was cast to voice Bing Bong, who tried to convey the same \"sort of innocence\" of his previous Pixar roles, and wound up not taking part in pre-release promotion as the producers decided to keep the character a secret.<ref name=\"EWBingBong\" />\n\n===Animation===\nAnimation of ''Inside Out'' took a year and a half. About 48 animators (including [[Supervising animator|supervisors]] Shawn Krause and Victor Navone, and [[Animation director|director]] Jamie Roe), and 350 artists (35 of them lighting\u2013led by cinematographer Kim White\u2013and 10 [[layout artist|layout]]) and technicians were involved in the production of the film. Two other animation teams were also produced: one was separate for abstract sequence and another was crowded for the character process.<ref name=\"PostMagazine\" /><ref name=\"APMakingOf\" />\n\nDocter imagined that with emotions for characters, they could \"push the level of caricature\" to both design and \"style of movement\" to degrees. To this end, they emulated the styles of animators [[Tex Avery]] and [[Chuck Jones]].<ref name=\"SlashfilmDocterRiveraTalk\" /> Docter informed Krause and Navone to push the graphic caricature of each character rather than sticking to the rigid behavior of each [[Pixar RenderMan|RenderMan]] model. This required an artist to draw over characters in ''Inside Out'' during [[dailies]], using a [[Wacom Cintiq]].<ref name=\"BillDesowitz\" /> The team spent over three years on enhancing the dinnertime scene, the first one to do so.<ref name=\"SecretReveal\" /> Sketches resembled the emotions were superior by the filmmakers, despite the rules broke within such boundaries.<ref name=\"PostMagazine\" /> After the characters were brought to finalized forms, they were proposed for 3D models using [[desktop computers]]. The filmmakers studyed dailies and understand animation until Docter gave the film's finalized shots for their approval on lighting and [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]].<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" />\n\nThrough the simulation department, the motion of the characters' hair and their garments were added.<ref name=\"THRMakingOf\" /> Eggleston's production design arrived, moving forward for added placements that included their original inspiration for lighting Joy.<ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\" /> Pixar co-founder [[Edwin Catmull]] believed the characters' attributes have a lesser extent of humanoid forms, brighter colors, and strange shapes due to their possession of [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]]. Rendering took 33 hours.<ref name=\"NewYorkerScience\" /> All aspects of ''Inside Out'' were eventually merged to a single image,<ref name=\"THRMakingOf\" /> having an animation spread across 1,600 shots. The film took three weeks of animation to create three seconds of footage.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" />\n\nEggleston's diagram was made of pastels shaped Joy, having her increased illumination<ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\" /> and making her Pixar's crucial character. Instead of being solid, Joy's effervescence was derived from pinwheels, [[Champagne]], and sparklers. Lozano thought that Joy would look like [[Audrey Hepburn]].<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> For Joy to become brightened, the RenderMan team turned real light from a geometry,<ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\" /> and Docter suggested to design her with \"sprite-like and golden\" modifications.<ref name=\"USATodayEmotions\" /> The filmmakers worked for eight months on Joy's aura, but encountered difficulties related to time and budget. Lasseter requested that it be applied for each emotion instead. Eggleston described this technique, \"You could hear the core technical staff just hitting the ground, the budget falling through the roof\".<ref name=\"CinemaBlendBrightIdea\" /> Docter and his six-designer team spent approximately 18 months finalizing Joy's look.<ref name=\"EWDocterMostDifficult\" /> Overall, the process on making Joy ran for three years.<ref name=\"USATodayEmotions\" />\n\n===Design and cinematography===\nEggleston was tasked with outlining ''Inside Out''{{'s}} worlds.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> Its design faithfully reflected Pixar films ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009), ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"PostMagazine\" /> and the intended 1950s [[Broadway musical]]s,<ref name=\"NYTBarnes\" /> which Navone tightened its aspects<ref name=\"PostMagazine\" /> and was emphasized by [[Freeform surface modelling|freeform techniques]].<ref name=\"TechCrunchProblems\" /> The mind world's [[Layout (computing)|layout]] and cinematography took inspiration from ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942).<ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\" /> Around 300 different designs of Headquarters were developed.<ref name=\"ShortListMakingOf\" /> Pixar researched films within the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood's golden age]] for [[set construction]]s. They performed [[Master shot|master moving shot]]s in combining them into a single scene, the longest of which were 48 seconds or 1,200 frames.<ref name=\"IndieWire10Things\" /> In envisaging how the mind's interior would be depicted, the filmmakers concentrated on the word \"electrochemical\" and was considered for various options using electricity.<ref name=\"JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind\" />\n\nDirector of photography [[Patrick Lin (cinematographer)|Patrick Lin]] placed ''Inside Out''{{'s}} camera language into the mind and real worlds for determining and differentiating them; they were respectively described as superior and inferior. The real world had problems created through lens distortion and out-of-focus shots. Even so, directorial changes countered the camera's complex usage. Two types of camera lenses (Arri/Zeiss{{nbsp}}Ultra Prime and Cooke S4), with distinct camera movements and predetermined paths, were used for both worlds. An inherent mechanical procedure using a dolly, track, crane, and boom was used in the mind one; and biological cameras like [[Zoom lens|zoom]], [[Steadicam]], and hand-held in the real one. Lin's crew supervised Riley's story arc as these cameras were applied in the film across three acts: first was Steadicam, followed by two were hand-held.<ref name=\"SlashFilm40Things\" /><ref name=\"Camerimage\" />\n\nThe use of scale progressions, which measured the [[worldbuilding]] size of the main characters, were made for handling the development of them and Riley and Joy's arcs. [[Staging (theatre, film, television)|Staging]] was used for ''Inside Out''{{'s}} story, while [[Framing (visual arts)|framing]] for its theme. One of the film's parts was described as earliest and reserved, and had [[closeup]]s for adults indicated for growing up, especially for Joy and Riley.<ref name=\"Camerimage\" /> The cameras were created by their crew have attached sensors and were \"rough\" and \"physical\"; these were improved in ''Inside Out'' after using them in Pixar's short film ''[[The Blue Umbrella (2013 film)|The Blue Umbrella]]'' (2013). For projecting ''Inside Out''{{'s}} environment, they used humans to surround it for the development and assembly of the film's scenes.
