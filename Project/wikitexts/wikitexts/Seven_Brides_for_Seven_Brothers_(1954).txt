The screenplay, by [[Albert Hackett]], [[Frances Goodrich]], and [[Dorothy Kingsley]], is based on the short story \"The Sobbin' Women\", by [[Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t]], which was based in turn on the [[ancient Roman]] legend of [[the Rape of the Sabine Women]]. ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'', which is set in [[Oregon]] in 1850, is particularly known for Kidd's unusual choreography, which makes dance numbers out of such mundane [[frontier]] pursuits as chopping wood and [[barn raising|raising a barn]]. Film critic Stephanie Zacharek has called the barn-raising sequence in ''Seven Brides'' \"one of the most rousing dance numbers ever put on screen.\"<ref name=\"Dance Magazine\">{{cite journal|title=DEATHS: Michael Kidd (1915\u20132007)|author=Gold, Sylviane|journal=Dance Magazine|date=March 2008 |volume=82|issue=3|pages=88\u201389}}</ref>  The film was photographed in [[Ansco Color]] in the [[CinemaScope]] format.<ref>{{Citation |title=Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) - IMDb |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047472/technical |access-date=2022-03-09}}</ref>\n\n''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Scoring of a Musical Picture]] and was nominated for four additional awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. In 2006, [[American Film Institute]] named ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' as [[AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals|one of the best American musical films ever made]]. In 2004, ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1850, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee arrives at an [[Oregon Territory]] town to look for a bride (Bless Your Beautiful Hide). He eventually meets Milly and proposes to her after seeing the quality of her cooking and her insistence on finishing her chores before she leaves with him. Despite not knowing him well, she accepts under the belief she is taking care of only him (Wonderful, Wonderful Day).\n\nWhen they arrive at his mountain cabin however, she is surprised to learn that he has six brothers \u2013 Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank, and Gideon \u2013 who all live uncouth lives with him. An angered Milly accuses Adam of manipulating her into becoming his servant, but he acknowledges that he needs her help due to how difficult living in the backwoods is and plans on sleeping outside to avoid losing face with his brothers, after Millie throws him out of the room. She eventually lets Adam sleep inside upon seeing him crawl up to sleep in a tree, explaining she had high hopes regarding marriage and love (When You're in Love).\n\nThe next morning, Milly teaches the Pontipee's cleanliness and proper manners. She is later shocked to learn Adam's brothers are unmarried as they rarely see girls and never learned how to communicate with them. Despite initial difficulties in changing their \"mountain man\" ways, they eventually realize they can only get brides by following Milly's example (Goin' Co'tin'). At a barn-raising social-gathering, the brothers meet Dorcas, Ruth, Martha, Liza, Sarah, and Alice, all of whom take a fancy to each other despite the women already having suitors, who taunt the Pontipee's (Hoedown/Barn Dance). The brothers resist the urge to fight at Millie's request, but the suitors attack Adam, provoking Gideon to retaliate. A brawl ensues, in which the physically superior Pontipee's overpower the suitors, but are expelled from town.\n\nAs winter comes and the brothers pine for the women they fell in love with (Lonesome Polecat), Milly asks Adam to help them. He reads his brothers \"[[The Sobbin' Women]]\" and Milly's Bible, telling them they should do whatever it takes to get their loves.\n\nWith Adam's aid, the brothers kidnap the six women before causing an avalanche in Echo Pass to stop the townspeople pursuing them. However, the Pontipees realize they forgot to kidnap a [[parson]] to conduct their weddings. Furious at the Pontipees' actions, Milly forces the men to live in the barn while the women stay in the house with her, sleeping in the brothers' beds. In response, a similarly furious Adam leaves for the Pontipees' trapping cabin further up the mountain to spend the winter alone. Gideon tells Milly, but she refuses to stop him.\n\nOver the winter, the women vent their frustrations by pranking the remaining Pontipees and musing upon their slowly softening feelings towards marriage (June Bride). Spring arrives and the women and the Pontipee's are paired off and happy in each other's company (Spring, Spring) until Milly announces she is having Adam's baby, causing everyone present to come together to help her. She gives birth to a baby girl named Hannah in the spring and Gideon leaves to tell Adam. Adam still refuses to return, despite learning he has a daughter, so Gideon berates him for his selfishness and punches him before leaving, causing Adam to feel shame for his actions. After the snow in Echo Pass melts, Adam returns, as he had said he would. Upon meeting his daughter, he realizes how worried the townspeople must be over the missing women and tells his brothers they should return them; but having fallen in love the six couples are unwilling to part and the women run and hide rather than go back to town. After discovering this, Milly tells the brothers, who track them down only to encounter the angry townspeople, who have come through the pass intending to hang them for kidnapping the girls.\n\nAlice's father, Reverend Elcott, hears Hannah crying as the townspeople sneak up onto the farm. Worried the baby might belong to one of the six women, he asks the women whose child Hannah is. After they all answer \"mine\", the fathers agree to give the six brothers and the six women a [[collective wedding|collective]] [[shotgun wedding]].\n\n==Cast==\nThe Brothers and their Brides:\n* [[Howard Keel]] as Adam and [[Jane Powell]] as Milly\n* [[Jeff Richards (actor, born 1924)|Jeff Richards]] as Benjamin and [[Julie Newmar]] as Dorcas (credited as Julie Newmeyer)\n* [[Matt Mattox]] as Caleb and [[Ruta Kilmonis|Ruta Lee]] as Ruth (credited as Ruta Kilmonis)\n* [[Marc Platt (dancer)|Marc Platt]] as Daniel and [[Norma Doggett]] as Martha\n* [[Jacques d'Amboise (dancer)|Jacques d'Amboise]] as Ephraim and [[Virginia Gibson]] as Liza\n* [[Tommy Rall]] as Frank and Betty Carr as Sarah\n* [[Russ Tamblyn]] as Gideon and Nancy Kilgas as Alice\n\n===Brothers===\n<!-- Please do not change the colors of the shirts which Daniel and Ephraim wore.  Daniel (Marc Platt) wore a mauve shirt \u2013 while Ephraim (Jacques d'Amboise) wore a dark green shirt.  There are clues in the movie to confirm this (please check the talk page for this film). -->\n\nTo perform the dance numbers and action sequences, choreographer [[Michael Kidd]] wanted dancers to portray all six of Adam Pontipee's brothers. Kidd said that he \"had to find a way to have these [[Rural poverty|backwoods]] men dance without looking ridiculous. I had to base it all around activities you would accept from such people&nbsp;\u2013 it couldn't look like [[ballet]]. And it could only have been done by superbly trained dancers.\" However, he was able to integrate into the cast two non-dancer MGM contract players who were assigned to the film, Jeff Richards, who performed just the simpler dance numbers, and [[Russ Tamblyn]], using him in the dance numbers by exploiting his talents as a gymnast and tumbler.<ref name=\"Variety 1997\">{{cite news | title=Kidd embraced by the Academy | work=Variety | date=March 3\u20139, 1997 | author=Gilbert, Tom | pages=54}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16147/Seven-Brides-for-Seven-Brothers/articles.html ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers''] TCM.com</ref>\n\nThe other four brothers were portrayed by professional dancers&nbsp;\u2013 Matt Mattox, Marc Platt, Tommy Rall, and Jacques d'Amboise.

One exterior sequence not filmed at the studio was shot on location at Corral Creek Canyon in Sun Valley, Idaho. It was here that the escape following the brothers' kidnapping their future brides and the avalanche that closed the pass was filmed.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047472/trivia?ref_=tt_ql_2 \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) | Trivia\"], IMDb.

Despite the fact that it cost more than the widescreen version to make, he says, the other version was never used. However, both versions are available on the 2004 DVD release.\n\nThe dresses worn by the female cast were made from old quilts that costume designer [[Walter Plunkett]] found at [[the Salvation Army]].<ref name=\"Jane Powell Autobiography\" />\n\n==Songs and music==\n\nThe \"Main Title\" is a medley of the songs \"Sobbin' Women\", \"Bless Your Beautiful Hide\" and \"Wonderful, Wonderful Day\".\n\nIn the film, Matt Mattox's voice is dubbed in by Bill Lee on \"Lonesome Polecat\".
