The plot revolves around Mystery Incorporated, a group of four young adults and a talking dog who solve mysteries, who reunite after a two-year disbandment to investigate a mystery at a popular horror-themed tropical island resort.\n\nFilmed in and around [[Queensland]], Australia, on a budget of $84&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|author=Dayna Van Buskirk, Reg Seeton|url=http://screenwriting.ugo.com/screenwriting/jamesgunn_interview.php|title=Unleashing Monsters & Zombies|work=[[UGO]]|date=March 1, 2004|access-date=April 23, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908083524/http://screenwriting.ugo.com/screenwriting/jamesgunn_interview.php|archive-date=September 8, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Scooby-Doo'' was released on June 14, 2002, and grossed $275&nbsp;million worldwide. [[Reggae]] artist [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] and rock group [[MxPx]] performed different versions of the ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' theme song. The [[Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster]], a ride based on the film, was built at [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] in Gold Coast, Australia in 2002. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized its script and humor, although Lillard\u2019s performance was praised and the movie later gained a [[Cult following|cult following]] from fans of the show. This is the last time [[William Hanna]] served as an executive producer before his death on {{dts|2001|3|22}}. A sequel, ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'', was released on March 26, 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter [[Mystery, Inc.]] solves the mystery of the Luna Ghost at a factory, long-brewing friction between [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], a glory hog, [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]], who has become sick of being the one who gets captured, and [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]], from whom Fred regularly steals credit for her plans, causes the gang to disband, abandoning a dismayed [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby]] and [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] and leaving them to care for the gang's van, [[The Mystery Machine]]. Two years later, they are all invited to solve a mystery on horror-themed tropical resort Spooky Island, whose owner, Emile Mondavarious, believes the visiting tourists are being brainwashed.\n\nWhile Shaggy and Scooby hope this will bring the gang back together, Velma, Fred and Daphne are all intent on solving the mystery on their own. Velma attends a ritualistic performance given by actor N'Goo Tuana and his henchman, famous [[luchador]] Zarkos. N'Goo claims ancient demons once ruled the island but have been plotting revenge ever since they were displaced by the resort. Meanwhile, Shaggy falls for a girl named Mary Jane, distancing himself from Scooby in the process.\n\nThey are all led to the resort's haunted house ride, where Fred and Velma encounter a schoolroom that educates inhuman creatures about human culture, while Daphne discovers a pyramid-shaped artifact called the Daemon Ritus. Fred, Velma and Mondavarious are kidnapped and later possessed by the island's demons. Mary Jane calls the Coast Guard for help, but they don't arrive; Zarkos steals back the Daemon Ritus from Daphne, who is also captured and possessed. The next day, after trying and failing to tell Shaggy that Mary Jane is a demon in disguise, Scooby goes missing as well.\n\nShaggy goes in search of his friends and finds a vat of [[protoplasm]] containing the souls of those possessed. He finds and frees the souls of Daphne, Fred and Velma, who discovers sunlight destroys the demons. A voodoo priest who lives on the island informs the gang the demons are to perform their \"Darpokalypse\" Ritual, which will see them rule the world for ten thousand years if a pure soul is sacrificed in the Daemon Ritus. The gang realizes that the pure soul is Scooby, whom Mondavarious brought to Spooky Island for this very reason. Fred, Daphne, and Velma finally decide to put their differences aside and work together with Shaggy to save Scooby.\n \nThe gang infiltrate the ritual, where Mondavarious is foiled in sacrificing Scooby's soul by Shaggy. Mondavarious is revealed to be a robot controlled by Scooby's estranged nephew [[Scrappy-Doo (live-action film)|Scrappy-Doo]], whom the gang abandoned long ago after his increasingly power-hungry and egomaniacal nature got out of control. Absorbing the tourists' souls, Scrappy transforms into a monster and tries to kill the gang. Daphne kills the demons by reflecting sunlight through a skull-shaped [[disco ball]] and knocks Zarkos into the vat, returning the other to their bodies. Shaggy frees the rest of the souls and finds the real Mondavarious imprisoned, having been captured by Scrappy so he could pose as his double. Scrappy and his henchmen are all arrested and Mystery, Inc. reunites.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Shaggy and Scooby eat hot peppers in the Spooky Island restaurant, glad that the resort has fulfilled its \"all-you-can-eat\" promise.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]]\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers]]\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Emile Mondavarious{{efn|Atkinson portrays the real Mondavarious, as well as the Mondavarious whom Scrappy-Doo was impersonating by operating a mechanical human suit of him, in a [[cameo appearance]].}}\n* [[Miguel A.
