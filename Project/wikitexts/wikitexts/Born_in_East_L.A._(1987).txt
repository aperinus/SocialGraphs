It co-stars [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Kamala Lopez]], [[Jan-Michael Vincent]], [[Lupe Ontiveros]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]] in his first feature film debut. The film is based on his [[Born in East L.A. (song)|song of the same name]], released as a 1985 single by [[Cheech & Chong]]. The film focuses on Rudy Robles, a [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] from [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] who is mistaken for an illegal immigrant and deported.\n\n''Born in East L.A.'' marked Marin's first solo film, without the involvement of his comedy partner, [[Tommy Chong]], at the insistence of executive [[Frank Price]], who was fired between greenlighting and production due to the failure of ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]''. ''Born in East L.A.'' was ultimately a financial success, and bolstered Marin's reputation in the Latino community, winning several awards at the [[Havana Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nRudy Robles ([[Cheech Marin]]) is told by his mother to pick up his cousin Javier ([[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]]) at a factory in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] before she and his sister leave for [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]. Robles arrives shortly before [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|immigration officials]] raid the factory looking for [[illegal immigrants]]. Because he is carrying no identification, and his mother and sister are not available to verify he is a US citizen, Robles is deported with the undocumented immigrants to [[Mexico]].\n\nRobles cannot speak more than very simple [[Spanglish]], though he is fluent in [[German language|German]] from having served in [[Germany]] in the [[United States Army]].\n\nIn [[Tijuana]], Robles becomes friends with a guy named Jimmy ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]) and a waitress named Dolores ([[Kamala Lopez-Dawson]]). Unable to contact his mother, Robles makes repeated attempts to cross the border, all ending in failure.\n\nJimmy offers to get him back home for a price. Having left home without his wallet, Robles works for Jimmy as doorman at a strip club, earning extra money selling oranges and teaching five would be illegal immigrants, two [[Nahuatl]] natives, played by [[Del Zamora]] and [[Sal L\u00f3pez]] and three Asians [[Jason Scott Lee]], [[Ted Lin]] and [[Jee Teo]], to walk and talk like [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] natives. They become called the \"Waas Sappening Boys\" or \"What's Happening Boys\".\n\nRobles falls in love with Dolores and finally raises the money needed to be smuggled across the border. He goes on a date with Dolores and the next day, Robles bids farewell to Jimmy, receives a last kiss goodbye from Dolores and climbs into the [[People smuggling|coyote]]'s truck. He sees a woman pleading to also be taken as her husband is already in the truck and their family is in the United States, but she lacks the money to pay for her to be smuggled. Robles gives the woman his place.\n\nRobles stands for the last time on the hill of the [[Mexico \u2013 United States border]] while two immigration officers sit in their truck watching in laughter. The song \"[[America (Neil Diamond song)|America]]\" by [[Neil Diamond]] is heard as Robles raises his arms and hundreds of people appear and race forward to reach the [[American Dream]]. The immigration officers hide in their truck. Rudy, Dolores, and their \"Waas Up\" friends walk with their heads up high into the United States.\n\nRudy and Dolores are kidnapped by coyotes and held for ransom, coincidentally, across the street from Rudy's home. He calls his cousin Javier from across the street to bring him his wallet, which he does to pay off the kidnappers. Then la migra storms in, headed by the man in the sunglasses and cowboy hat who had deported Rudy in the beginning.\n\nRudy shows his identification this time to the immigration officer, who says he's going to send Dolores back to El Salvador. Rudy and Dolores make a dash and escape during the East Los Angeles [[Cinco de Mayo]] parade. Not knowing where to turn, Rudy and Dolores hop onto the float with a priest; Rudy asks if he can marry them. Rudy and Dolores both look at each other in happiness as they are wed.\n\nThe immigration officer arrives to place Dolores under arrest. Rudy then explains that they've just been married, making Dolores a legal resident. The crowd, witnessing everything, cheers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=65%}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Rudy Robles\n* [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] as Javier\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Jimmy\n* [[Kamala Lopez]] as Dolores\n* [[Jan-Michael Vincent]] as McCalister\n* [[Lupe Ontiveros]] as Mrs. Robles\n{{col-2}}\n* Alma Martinez as Gloria\n* [[Neith Hunter]] as Marcie (the Redhead)\n* [[Larry Blackmon]] as Slick dude\n* [[Tito Larriva]] as Oscar\n* [[Terrence Evans]] as Immigration Officer\n* [[Tony Plana]] as Feo\n* [[Eddie Barth]] as Lester\n* Del Zamora as What\u2019s Happening Boys\n* [[Jason Scott Lee]] as What\u2019s Happening Boys\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\nFollowing the success of [[Cheech & Chong]]'s 1985 single \"[[Born in East L.A. (song)|Born in East L.A.]]\", a parody of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]\" written by [[Cheech Marin]], [[Frank Price]], at the time a development executive at [[Universal Pictures]], called Marin, whom he had known from having previously worked at [[Columbia Pictures]], where Cheech & Chong had made the films ''[[Nice Dreams]]'' and ''[[Things Are Tough All Over]]''. Price suggested that the song would make a good film, but without [[Tommy Chong]]'s involvement. With the deterioration of Marin's comedy partnership with Chong, Marin signed a contract with Universal to write, direct and star in ''Born in East L.A.''<ref name=Marin185>Marin, Cheech. \"You're into video, I'm into film.\" ''Cheech is Not My Real Name''.

We wanted to satirize them a little bit. We turned Feo into a guy who extorts money in the name of [[Jesus]].\" Plana also improvised much of his dialogue, including \"You don\u2019t have to thank me, you just have to pay me.\"<ref name=NBCLatino/>\n\nAlso improvised was the scene with Marin standing outside the bar; the people that walked past him, Marin claims, were not extras, and their reactions were real.<ref name=NBCLatino/>\n\nDuring shooting, the film's producer, [[Peter MacGregor-Scott]], was interviewed by a Mexican radio station, where he called for extras to come to the set to appear in the movie, where they would receive American scale pay, lunch and transportation paid for by the production.<ref name=Marin186/>\n\n==Release==\nBetween the greenlighting and production of ''Born in East L.A.'', Frank Price was fired by Universal due to the failure of ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'', which was blamed on Price.
