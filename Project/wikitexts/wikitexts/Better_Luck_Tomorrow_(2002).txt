The film is about [[Asian American]] overachievers who become bored with their lives and enter a world of petty crime and material excess. ''Better Luck Tomorrow'' introduced film audiences to a cast including [[Parry Shen]], [[Jason Tobin]], [[Sung Kang]], [[Roger Fan]], and [[John Cho]]. The film was based loosely on the [[murder of Stuart Tay]], a teenager from [[Orange County, California]], by four [[Sunny Hills High School]] honor students on December 31, 1992.<ref>Yi, Daniel. {{cite web|title=They're the bad seeds?|url=http://www.betterlucktomorrow.com/article.php?id=32|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321193117/http://www.betterlucktomorrow.com/article.php?id=32|archive-date=2006-03-21|access-date=2008-03-19}} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

His perfectionism masks another side of his life, which is toilet-papering houses with his best friend Virgil and engaging in petty crime with Virgil's cousin [[Han Lue]].\n\nThough Ben makes the basketball team, he ends up being mostly a benchwarmer. Through Daric Loo, senior valedictorian and president of nearly every student club, Ben gets involved in a school-wide cheat sheet operation. Daric pays Jesus, another student, to steal the tests from the school office, and Ben uses the tests to make cheat sheets which are then sold off to students. Ben brings Virgil and Han into the scam, and the four of them make a small fortune. Meanwhile, Ben finds himself competing with Steve Choe, a private school student and Stephanie's boyfriend, for Stephanie's affections. Steve discovers Ben's crush and offers to let him take Stephanie to the Winter Formal.\n\nThe group's activities gradually escalate into more dangerous scams, such as the theft of computer parts from the school and selling drugs. They become users themselves, with Ben developing a heavy cocaine habit. Feeling increasingly conflicted by the expectations others have of him, and horrified at waking up with a nosebleed due to his cocaine use, Ben decides to quit the group. He resumes his academic pursuits and begins spending more time with Stephanie. He eventually asks her to the formal; she accepts.\n\nAfter the Winter Formal dance, Ben is lured back to his life of crime when Steve meets with Ben and tells him he has information on a possible score. The group is stunned when Steve reveals he wants them to rob his parents' house. Though Ben and Han are initially against it, Daric convinces the group this would be the perfect opportunity to teach the haughty Steve a lesson.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, the four meet Steve at Jesus's house under the pretense of robbing Steve's parents, but Daric, Virgil and Han begin attacking Steve while Ben keeps watch outside. In the ensuing struggle Steve gets Virgil's gun which goes off. Ben runs in and, seeing the gun in Steve's hand, beats Steve with a baseball bat. The group convinces Jesus to bury the body in his backyard for $300. Steve begins to twitch, revealing he's still alive, but Daric suffocates Steve with a gasoline-soaked rag while a tearful Virgil holds his arms back. Afterwards, the four go to a New Year's Eve party, where Ben and Stephanie kiss at midnight.\n\nThe next day, while cleaning up the aftermath of the murder, Ben and Virgil hear Steve's phone ringing under the ground in Jesus's backyard. They dig it up and learn it was a call from Stephanie. Ben debates on whether to report Steve's murder to the police. The guilt over Steve's murder is too much for Virgil, who attempts suicide, but fails and suffers potential brain damage. Daric expresses concern about Han or Virgil reporting the murder, but Ben simply resolves to do nothing and walks away.\n\nAt the end of the film, Ben is shown alone. He encounters Stephanie one day on the way home. She asks him whether he has seen Steve lately, and expresses some concern that he has not called. They kiss, implying the resumption of their relationship. Ben's voice-over tells the audience that he has no idea about what the future holds, but all he knows is that there is no turning back.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Parry Shen]] as Ben Manibag, a straight-A student who commits petty crimes to express himself in other ways\n* [[Jason Tobin]] as Virgil Hu, Ben's friend since the fourth grade\n* [[Sung Kang]] as [[Han Lue]], Virgil's cousin\n* [[Roger Fan]] as Daric Loo, the violent, self-centered, senior class valedictorian\n* [[John Cho]] as Steve Choe, Stephanie's boyfriend\n* [[Karin Anna Cheung]] as Stephanie Vandergosh\n* [[Jerry Mathers]] as The Biology Teacher\n\n== Development ==\n[[Justin Lin]] said that the title \"Better Luck Tomorrow\" refers to how the film explores \"the whole youth culture of today, specifically Asian-American, but also just the general mentality of teenagers today. I mean, I work with teenagers, I grew up in the 80s, and already it's very different, the mentality.
