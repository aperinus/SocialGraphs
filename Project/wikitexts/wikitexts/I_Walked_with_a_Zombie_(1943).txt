It stars [[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]], [[Frances Dee]], and [[Tom Conway]], and follows a nurse who travels to care for the ailing wife of a sugar [[plantation]] owner in the [[Caribbean]], where she witnesses [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] rituals and possibly encounters [[Zombie|the walking dead]]. The film's screenplay, written by [[Curt Siodmak]] and [[Ardel Wray]], is based on an article of the same title by [[Inez Wallace]], and also partly reinterprets the narrative of the 1847 novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' by [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]].{{sfn|Bansak|2003|pages=146\u2013147}}\n\n''I Walked with a Zombie'' premiered in New York City on April 21, 1943, before receiving a wider theatrical release later that month. The film has been analyzed for its themes of slavery and racism, and for its depiction of beliefs associated with [[African diaspora religions]], particularly [[Haitian Vodou]]. Though it received mixed reviews upon release, retrospective assessments have been more positive.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Darby Jones as Carrefour in the trailer for I Walked with a Zombie (1943).jpg|thumb|[[Darby Jones]] as the [[zombie]]-like Carrefour]]\nBetsy Connell, a white Canadian nurse, relates that she once \"walked with a [[zombie]]\". A man interviews her, asking if she believes in witchcraft, and sends her to a job in the Caribbean. She travels by ship, meeting Paul Holland on board.\n\nBetsy is hired to care for the wife of Paul Holland, a [[sugar plantation]] owner on the [[Caribbean]] island of Saint Sebastian. Saint Sebastian is home to a small [[White Caribbeans|white]] community and [[Afro-Caribbean|descendants of African slaves]]. On the way to the plantation, the black driver tells Betsy that the Hollands brought slaves to the island, and that the statue of \"Ti-Misery\" ([[Saint Sebastian]] pierced by arrows) in the courtyard is the [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] from a [[slave ship]].\n\nAt dinner, Betsy meets Paul's half-brother and employee, Wesley Rand, who clearly resents Paul. While getting ready for bed, Betsy hears crying. When she investigates, a woman in a white robe walks towards her, her eyes staring. Betsy screams, waking everyone. The woman is Jessica Holland, Paul's wife whom Betsy is to care for. The next morning, Dr. Maxwell tells Betsy that Jessica's [[spinal cord]] was irreparably damaged by a serious illness, leaving her totally without the willpower to do anything for herself.\n\nOn her day off, Betsy encounters Wesley in town. While he drinks himself into a stupor, a [[Calypso music|calypso]] singer sings about how Jessica was going to run away with Wesley, but Paul would not let them go; she was then struck down by the fever. Betsy meets Mrs. Rand, Paul and Wesley's doctor mother.\n\nThat night at dinner, Wesley accuses Paul of being responsible for Jessica's condition. Later, Paul, whom Betsy has been falling in love with, apologizes to her for bringing her to the island, and admits that he may have been the cause of his wife's condition. Betsy determines to make him happy by curing Jessica.\n\nBetsy gets Paul to agree to try a potentially fatal [[insulin shock]] treatment on Jessica, but it has no effect. Housemaid Alma then tells her that a ''[[houngan]]'', or [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] priest, cured a woman of a similar condition. Betsy takes Jessica without permission through cane fields past a crossroads guarded by Carrefour{{efn|Also spelled as \"Carre-Four\".{{sfn|Nemerov|2005|p=97\u201398, 102\u2013108, 112\u2013119}}<ref name=\"Murthi 2015\">{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/09/criticwire-classic-of-the-week-i-walked-with-a-zombie-130444/|title=Criticwire Classic of the Week: 'I Walked With a Zombie'|last=Murthi|first=Vikram|date=September 2, 2015|website=[[IndieWire]]|access-date=June 29, 2021}}</ref> The name is a reference to the [[loa]] [[Kalfu|Maitre Carrefours]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}}} to the ''[[Hounfour|houmfort]]'' (a place where voodoo worshipers gather). There, they watch a sabreur wield a [[saber]] during a ritual. People are given advice by a voodoo priest, whom Betsy is shocked to find is Mrs. Rand. Mrs. Rand explains that she uses voodoo to convince the natives to accept conventional medical practices and tells Betsy that Jessica is incurable. Outside, the locals stab Jessica in the arm with the sword as a test. When she does not bleed, they are convinced she is a zombie.\n\nBetsy takes Jessica home. Paul is furious, but is moved when he realizes that Betsy was trying to cure Jessica. The local authorities investigate the next day, and the natives demand that Jessica be returned to them for further ritualistic tests. Later, Carrefour approaches the residence, and Mrs. Rand orders him to leave. Paul suggests that Betsy return to Canada, regretting entangling her in his family problems and fearful of demeaning and abusing her as he did Jessica. Betsy reluctantly agrees.\n\nThe next day, Dr. Maxwell reports that the unrest has sparked an official inquiry into Jessica's illness. Mrs. Rand claims that Jessica is a zombie. Although she had never taken voodoo seriously before, Mrs. Rand reveals that when she discovered that Jessica was planning to run away with Wesley and break up her family, she felt herself [[Spirit possession#In Haitian Vodou and African traditions|possessed by a voodoo god]]. She then put a curse on Jessica. Paul, Maxwell and Betsy dismiss her story, but Wesley becomes obsessed with freeing Jessica. He asks Betsy if she would consider [[euthanasia]], but she refuses.\n\nUsing an [[effigy]] of Jessica, the sabreur twice attempts to draw her to him from afar. Paul and Betsy stop her the first time, but Wesley allows Jessica to leave the second time. Wesley pulls an arrow out of the statue of Ti-Misery and follows. As the sabreur stabs the doll with a pin, Wesley thrusts the arrow into Jessica. He then carries her body into the sea, pursued slowly by Carrefour. Later, the natives discover the bodies of Jessica and Wesley floating in the surf.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Frances Dee]] as Betsy Connell\n* [[Tom Conway]] as Paul Holland\n* [[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]] as Wesley Rand\n* [[Edith Barrett]] as Mrs. Rand\n* [[James Bell (actor)|James Bell]] as Dr. Maxwell\n* Christine Gordon as Jessica Holland\n* [[Theresa Harris]] as Alma\n* [[Sir Lancelot (singer)|Sir Lancelot]] as Calypso Singer\n* [[Darby Jones]] as Carrefour\n* [[Jeni Le Gon]] as Dancer{{sfn|Nemerov|2005|p=118}}\n* [[Rita Christiani]] as a friend of Melise (uncredited){{sfn|Nemerov|2005|p=118}}\n* Jieno Moxzer as the sabreur (uncredited){{sfn|Nemerov|2005|p=118}}\n}}\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\n===Slavery and racism===\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=\"Carre-Four must have confronted audiences that summer as an especially charged figure, even if his exact significance requires after-the-fact interpretation.
