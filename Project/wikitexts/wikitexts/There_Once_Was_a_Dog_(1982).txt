However, they become exasperated when the Dog is indifferent during a burglary. The Dog is kicked out and goes to the forest, where he meets the Wolf, his old enemy. The Dog and the Wolf are both old, so they understand they can't be just enemies forever. The Wolf stages a kidnapping to help his mate and the Dog \"rescues\" the child. The Dog is welcomed back to the [[khutor]] (the farmstead) and continues with his old duty. The winter comes and one evening the Dog hears the [[Howl (sound)|howl]] of the Wolf. The Dog remembers to repay the Wolf's kindness. He helps the Wolf to enter the house where there is a wedding in progress and takes him different kinds of food from the table. Becoming tipsy from the effects of a large meal, alcohol and a warm house, the Wolf starts to howl his \"song\". The wolf howls and is discovered, but the quick-thinking dog saves him by 'chasing' him from the house. The Wolf thanks the Dog and the best friends bid farewell.\n\nThe story reveals the problem of becoming old and useless. It appeals to everyone's ability for mutual readiness to help, despite past history.\n\n==Credits==\nThe cartoon repeatedly features the Ukrainian folk songs \"Oy tam na hori\" (\"Oh, there at the mountain\") and \"Ta kosyv batko, kosyv ya\" (\"My father and I were mowing\") performed by \"Drevo\" folk choir from Kriachkivka [[Village#Slavic countries|village]] of [[Pyriatyn Raion|Pyriatyn]] District, [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava Region]]. The Dog was voiced by [[Georgi Burkov]] and the Wolf by [[Armen Dzhigarkhanyan]].
