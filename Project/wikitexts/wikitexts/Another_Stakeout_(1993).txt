It is a sequel to the 1987 film, ''[[Stakeout (1987 film)|Stakeout]]''. Unlike its predecessor, the film was neither a critical nor a commercial success.\n\n==Plot==\nLuella Delano ([[Cathy Moriarty]]), a witness against the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] is being hidden until the trial in the desert. A hitman blows up the house using a sewage removal truck to pump gas under it. The violent attempt against her kills her husband, several of her guards and she disappears.\n\nChris Lecce ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and Bill Reimers ([[Emilio Estevez]]), after an undercover detail goes wrong (the man who's been killing homeless people gets shot with Chris's gun), are called upon to stake out the lakeside home where Luella is believed to be.\n\nUnlike their earlier [[Stakeout (1987 film)|stakeout]], this time they are accompanied by Gina Garrett ([[Rosie O'Donnell]]) the assistant DA and her pet [[rottweiler]] 'Archie', their cover is husband, wife, and son.\n\nWhen Chris arrives home, his girlfriend Maria ([[Madeleine Stowe]]) is kicking him out, as he won't marry her, although they've been together for seven years. Chris doesn't want to, as his family has the worst track record in marriage, including his own divorce.\n\nHowever, he, Bill, and Gina must continue with their stakeout of Brian and Pam O'Hara to make sure Luella is safe. The trio are given use of a red convertible and a judge's summer house next to the O'Haras' as cover.\n\nThe trio meet the couple upon arrival, as Archie chases a cat onto their property. Bill sends Gina for a run after Brian the next morning. When all three aren't watching, the O'Haras leave the house. Bill sneaks in to bug the place, but has to abort the mission.\n\nGina invites them to their house that night for a dinner party so Bill can plant several bugs around theirs. She and Chris freak out the couple by acting odd. Then things take a turn for the worse when Bill is knocked unconscious after being mistaken for a hit man.\n\nLuana has subdued Bill, not knowing he's there to protect her. Her friends, the O'Haras find her with the bound, gagged and hooded man, who she insists they must kill. As she's about to shoot him at the end of the pier, he flips off it, freeing himself.\n\nGina and Chris appear, subduing Luana. In custody, she asks to talk to the O'Haras in person. Chris and Bill are packing up to leave when they spot Tony the hitman. Hurrying to warn them in the other house, there they are initially shot at as Luella insists it is they who are the hitmen.\n\nTony, kills the corrupt District Attorney for his interference. Then he takes Gina hostage, despite Chris and Bill having their guns drawn. While walking Gina at gunpoint past the pool in pursuit of Luella, Tony is attacked by Archie for threatening Gina and they both fall into the pool. He shoots at Luella but hits Gina in the shoulder instead, then gets shot and killed by Chris and Bill.\n\nBoth Chris and Bill are congratulated as heroes by the FBI, Luella and Gina. Chris returns to his apartment to call Maria, but she is already there. He proposes and she accepts, while Bill watches through binoculars from the car.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as Detective Chris Lecce\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as Detective Bill Reimers\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Assistant District Attorney Gina Garrett\n* [[Dennis Farina]] as Brian O'Hara\n* [[Marcia Strassman]] as Pam O'Hara\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Luella \"Lu\" Delano\n* [[John Rubinstein]] as District Attorney Tommy Hassrick\n* [[Miguel Ferrer]] as Tony Castellano\n* [[Sharon Maughan]] as Barbara Burnside\n* [[Christopher Doyle]] as McNamara\n* Sharon Schaffer as Tilghman\n* Jan Speck as Van Agent\n* [[Frank C.
