It stars [[Hugh Jackman]] as Dutch monster hunter [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]], and [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Anna Valerious. The film is a homage and tribute to the [[Universal Classic Monsters|Universal Horror Monster]] films from the 1930s and 1940s (also produced by [[Universal Pictures]] which were in turn partially based on novels by [[Bram Stoker]] and [[Mary Shelley]]), of which Sommers is a fan.\n\nThe eponymous character was inspired by the Dutch vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing from Irish author Bram Stoker's novel ''[[Dracula]]''. Distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], the film includes a number of monsters such as [[Count Dracula]] (and other [[vampire]]s), [[Frankenstein's monster]], [[Simonside Dwarfs|Duergar]], [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Mr. Hyde]] and [[Werewolf|werewolves]] in a way similar to the multi-monster movies that Universal produced in the 1940s, such as ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', ''[[House of Frankenstein (film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[House of Dracula]]''. The film received mostly negative reviews but grossed $300 million worldwide against a budget of $160\u2013170 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[1887]] [[Transylvania]], Doctor [[Victor Frankenstein]], aided by his assistant [[Igor (character)|Igor]] and [[Count Dracula]], creates a [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]]. Dracula kills Frankenstein and as an angry mob storms the Castle, the monster flees to a [[windmill]] with Frankenstein's body. The mob burns down the windmill, seemingly killing the monster. A year later, monster hunter Gabriel [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]] travels to [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and kills [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll]] after a brawl with Mr. Hyde. Helsing pursues evil on behalf of the Holy Order, which has protected mankind \"from time immemorial\". Van Helsing, who remembers nothing before he was found crawling up the steps of a church nearly dead, hopes to earn pardon for his forgotten sins and regain his memory.\n\nAt the Order's [[Vatican City]] headquarters, Van Helsing is tasked with traveling to Transylvania, destroying Dracula and protecting Anna and Velkan Valerious, the last of an ancient Romanian family. Their ancestor vowed that his descendants would kill Dracula or spend eternity in [[Purgatory]]. In Transylvania, Anna and Velkan attempt to kill a [[werewolf]] controlled by Dracula, but it falls with Velkan into a deep river gorge, managing to bite him in the process.\n\nVan Helsing and Carl, a [[friar]] and weapons inventor, arrive at a village and join Anna's fight with Dracula's [[Brides of Dracula|brides]] \u2013 Verona, Marishka and Aleera, slaying Marishka in the process. That night, Velkan visits Anna to warn her of Dracula's plans but transforms into a werewolf and escapes. Van Helsing and Anna pursue Velkan to [[Frankenstein Castle|Frankenstein's castle]]. They stumble upon Dracula's plan to duplicate Frankenstein's experiments to give life to thousands of his undead children, using Velkan as a conduit.\n\nDuring the fray, Dracula confronts Van Helsing, whom he regards as an ancient rival. Dracula's spawn come to life before dying, due to lacking Frankenstein's original formula. Van Helsing and Anna escape and stumble upon Frankenstein's monster at the windmill, who reveals that he's the key to Frankenstein's machine to give life to Dracula's brood. Eavesdropping on their discussion, Velkan escapes with this new information.\n\nIn Anna's castle, Carl discovers a hidden painting of two rival knights. It comes to life, revealing the knights as a vampire and a werewolf in battle. While attempting to bring the monster to Rome, Van Helsing and his crew are ambushed by the brides and Velkan, near [[Budapest]]. Verona and Velkan are killed, but Van Helsing is bitten. Aleera kidnaps Anna and offers to trade her for the monster at a masquerade ball. Van Helsing locks the monster in a crypt, but the undead retrieve him for Dracula. Van Helsing and Carl rescue Anna and escape from the masquerade guests, revealed to be vampires.\n\nAt Anna's castle, Carl explains that Dracula is the son of Valerious the Elder. When he was killed in 1462 by the \"[[Gabriel|Left Hand of God]]\", Dracula made a pact with the Devil and lived again. Valerious was told to kill Dracula and gain salvation for his entire family. Unable to kill his son, he imprisoned him in an icy fortress. A fragment the Cardinal gave Van Helsing opens a path to Dracula's castle.\n\nThey find the monster, who reveals that Dracula possesses a cure for [[lycanthropy]] because only a werewolf can kill him. Van Helsing, fighting the curse, sends Anna and Carl to retrieve the cure, killing Igor and Aleera in the process. Van Helsing attempts to free the monster but is struck by lightning, bringing Dracula's children to life. Dracula and Van Helsing turn into their bestial forms and battle. Whilst both briefly return to their human forms, Dracula reveals that it was Van Helsing who killed him and offers to restore his memory. Van Helsing refuses and kills Dracula after reverting back to his werewolf form, triggering his brood's deaths. Anna arrives and injects the cure into Van Helsing, but is killed by him in the process.\n\nVan Helsing and Carl burn Anna's body on a cliff overlooking the sea. Frankenstein's monster departs by raft, and Van Helsing sees Anna's spirit reuniting with her family in [[Heaven]]. Van Helsing and Carl ride off into the sunset.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Gabriel Van Helsing]], a legendary hunter of monsters.\n* [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Anna Valerious, the last descendant of an ancient [[Romanians|Romanian]] family.\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as [[Count Dracula|Count Vladislaus Dracula]], a powerful vampire.\n* [[David Wenham]] as Carl, a friar of the Holy Order.\n* [[Shuler Hensley]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]]\n* [[Kevin J.

Furthermore, he wrote: \"There are quite a few unintentionally funny moments, although the overall experience was too intensely painful for me to be able to advocate it as being \"so bad, it's good\". ... Some, however, will doubtless view it as such. More power to them, since sitting through this movie requires something more than a strong constitution and a capacity for self-torture\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/v/van_helsing.html | title = Van Helsing | access-date = 2012-05-09 | last = Berardinelli | first = James | publisher = ReelViews}}</ref>\n\n[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' greatly disliked the film: \"Writer-director Stephen Sommers (...) throws together plot strains from various horror movies and stories and tries to muscle things along with flash and dazzle. But his film just lies there, weighted down by a complete lack of wit, artfulness and internal logic. ... What Sommers tries to do here is use action as the only means of involving an audience. So story is sacrificed. Character development is nonexistent, and there are no attempts to incite emotion. Instead, Sommers tries to hold an audience for two hours with nothing up his sleeve but colored ribbons, bright sparklers and a kazoo. What he proves is that this is no way to make movies\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Van-Helsing-a-monstrosity-of-a-movie-2782332.php|title='Van Helsing' a monstrosity of a movie|access-date=2012-05-09|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|date=May 7, 2004|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' gave the film 3 stars out of 4 stating that \"at the outset, we may fear Sommers is simply going for f/x overkill, but by the end, he has somehow succeeded in assembling all his monsters and plot threads into a high-voltage climax.
