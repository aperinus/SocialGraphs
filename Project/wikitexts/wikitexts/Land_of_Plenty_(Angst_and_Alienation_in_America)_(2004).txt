The film was [[Gloria Stuart]]'s last screen appearance before her death in 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie presents a view of post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] United States as seen through the eyes of Lana, an American girl who has lived in Africa and the Middle East for years with her [[missionary]] parents.  She is returning from a long trip to the [[West Bank]]. In Los Angeles, she works at a homeless mission and looks up her only living relative in the US, her late mother's brother, Paul. He is a paranoid [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran who drives around filming and spying on [[Arab]]s and people with Arab features. Lana, in contrast, leans toward [[anti-war]] convictions and has been changed by her experiences abroad, so feels outside American culture.\n\nHaving first-hand knowledge of the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], she sees similarities between the slums of [[Los Angeles]] and those of the [[Third World]]. After she and Paul see the murder of a young Pakistani outside the mission, they take his body to his family. Their road trip offers Paul a different view of Muslim home life. Over the course of the film, Paul and Lana learn more about each other.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] as Lana\n* [[John Diehl]] as Paul\n* [[Shaun Toub]] as Hassan\n* [[Wendell Pierce]] as Henry\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Jimmy\n* [[Burt Young]] as Sherman\n* Yuri Elvin as Officer Elvin\n* [[Jeris Lee Poindexter]] as Charles\n* Rhonda Stubbins White as Dee Dee\n* Victoria Thomas as News reporter\n* Matthew Kimbrough as News anchor\n* Paul West as Policeman\n* [[Jeffrey Vincent Parise]] as Coroner's assistant\n* [[Christa Lang]] as Trailer park woman\n* Warren Stearns as Mortician\n* [[Bernard White (actor)|Bernard White]] as Youssef\n* [[Gloria Stuart]] as Old lady\n{{Div-col-end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot using the [[Digital data|digital]] and hand-held [[Panasonic AG-DVX100]] camera, so the production time was cut to a minimum.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the film was distributed by [[IFC Films]].\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1153319_land_of_plenty |title=Land of Plenty |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |access-date=November 15, 2017}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/land-of-plenty |title=Land of Plenty |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=November 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKevin Thomas of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, \"Hampered by an ending that overreaches needlessly, the film is nevertheless worthy and unmistakably the effort of an enduringly distinctive and important filmmaker.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Kevin |date=November 11, 2005 |title=Getting left behind in 'Land of Plenty' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/11/entertainment/et-plenty11 |access-date=November 15, 2017 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Leslie Felperin of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised Michelle Williams' performance, saying, \"Engaging perfs keep its motor running, with Williams in particular charming and convincing as a politically engaged humanist.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/land-of-plenty-1200531090/ |title=Land of Plenty |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Leslie |last=Felperin |date=September 14, 2004 |access-date=November 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title}}\n\n{{Wim Wenders}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Land Of Plenty}}\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2000s drama road movies]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wim Wenders]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism]]\n[[Category:American drama road movies]]\n[[Category:2004 drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
