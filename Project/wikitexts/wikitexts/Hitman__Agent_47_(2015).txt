It is based on the [[Hitman (franchise)|''Hitman'' video game series]], developed by [[IO Interactive]], and its main character, a mysterious assassin known only as [[Agent 47]].<ref name=\"Fox\">{{cite news|last = Fleming|first = Mike Jr.|title = Fox Reloading 'Hitman' With Paul Walker As Bald Barcoded Assassin Agent 47|url = https://deadline.com/2013/02/fox-reloading-hitman-with-paul-walker-as-bald-barcoded-assassin-agent-47-422594/|access-date = February 6, 2014|publisher = deadline.com|date = February 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe film, starring [[Rupert Friend]], [[Hannah Ware]], [[Zachary Quinto]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], [[Thomas Kretschmann]] and [[Angelababy]], was theatrically released on August 21, 2015. It received negative reviews from critics, who lamented the script, performances, score and visual effects, and grossed $82 million worldwide against its $35 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n\n47 is an \"Agent\"; a [[Genetic engineering|genetically]]-[[Human enhancement|enhanced]] [[supersoldier]] created by Dr. Petr Litvenko, a skilled [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] geneticist. Litvenko, unable to bear the guilt of his creation, abandoned the Agent project. 47 works as a hitman for the ICA (International Contracts Agency) and has spent the last few years tracking down Litvenko's daughter, Katia; he gets a lead from mercenaries led by Delriego, who have been trying to find Litvenko in order to recreate the Agent program for their own means.\n\nKatia, living in [[Berlin]] under the assumed surname of Van Dees, has worked tirelessly to find an unknown man and is plagued by overwhelming anxiety and a superhuman awareness of everything around her. Katia is approached at a subway station by a man calling himself John Smith. He tells her that 47 is on his way to kill her, and offers her protection, while hinting that he has information about the man she's searching for. 47 finds and attacks the pair, who are able to escape, but not before 47 grazes Katia's arm with a sniper bullet.\n\nSmith and Katia hide out in a hotel room. He explains that he is an operative for a corporation known as Syndicate International and that the man she's searching for is her father. Katia shows him the clues she has put together and asks John to tell her everything he knows about her father. Based on the languages he knows, his age, his love of orchids and medical condition ([[lung cancer]]), Katia deduces where her father must be living. Before she can tell Smith, 47 enters, leaving Smith for dead and capturing Katia.\n\nOnce Katia awakens, 47 explains to her that she is an Agent, designed by her father to be better than even 47 himself (he explains that her name \"Katia van Dees\" is an homophone for her real name, \"Quatre-vingt-dix\"; which is [[French language|French]] for \"90\"). He shows her how to use her heightened senses in combat and the two fight against Syndicate forces. They are confronted by Smith, who is revealed to have surgically implanted subdermal body armor, making him impervious to gunshots. After fighting off Smith, 47 and Katia manage to escape. Katia makes 47 promise that he won't harm her father and finally reveals Litvenko's location: [[Singapore]]. Elsewhere, 47's handler Diana, learning of his situation, contacts another Agent with a contract in Singapore.\n\n47 and Katia track down Litvenko, who apologizes to Katia for abandoning her, saying that he only wanted to keep her safe and referring to 47 as her \"brother\". Just then, Syndicate soldiers attack the group and they are forced to flee. During the escape, Litvenko is captured by the Syndicate, but not before 47 slips him an [[inhaler]].\n\nSmith tortures Litvenko under the supervision of Syndicate director Antoine Le Clerq but Litvenko refuses to reopen the Agent program. 47 hacks into the Syndicate announcing system and Katia crashes a stolen helicopter into the building; 47 disguises himself as a firefighter to get inside undetected. The two fight their way through Syndicate security forces, and 47 is once again confronted by Smith. 47 defeats him by [[electrocuting]] him.\n\nOn the rooftop, 47 and Katia mop up the rest of the Syndicate's troops, but not before Le Clerq escapes in a helicopter with Litvenko. In mid-air, Litvenko detonates the inhaler, killing himself and the director. 47 then calls Diana and confirms his first target (Le Clerq) has been eliminated. When Diana asks about the second target (implied to be Katia), 47 drops his phone off the side of the building. As the two prepare to leave, they are confronted by Agent 48, an exact look-alike of Agent 47, who tells them \"Diana says 'Hello'\" before firing.\n\nIn the mid-credits scene, Smith is shown to be still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rupert Friend]] as [[Agent 47]], a mysterious assassin who works for a top secret non-government organization called the International Contracts Agency (known as either the ICA or just the Agency) which carries out the assassinations of high-profile targets worldwide.<ref name=\"Rupert\">{{cite news|last = Kit|first = Borys|title = 'Homeland' Actor Rupert Friend in Talks to Replace Paul Walker in 'Agent 47'|url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/homeland-actor-rupert-friend-talks-669664|access-date = February 6, 2014|newspaper = The Hollywood Reporter|date = January 9, 2014}}</ref> Friend also portrays Agent 48.\n** Jesse Hergt as Young Agent 47\n* [[Hannah Ware]]<ref name=\"Hannah\">{{cite news|last = Kroll|first = Justin|title = Hannah Ware Lands Female Lead in 'Agent 47,' Based on 'Hitman' Videogame|url = https://variety.com/2014/film/news/hannah-ware-agent-47-hitman-1201088128/|access-date = February 6, 2014|newspaper = Variety|date = February 5, 2014}}</ref> as Katia, a woman, with enhanced senses, who is on the run and is desperately searching for Litvenko\n** Helena Pieske as Young Katia\n* [[Zachary Quinto]]<ref name=\"Zachary\" /> as John Smith, a high-ranking member of Syndicate International surgically enhanced to counter Agents like 47\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Litvenko, doctor and the founder of the Agent program and Katia's father\n** Johannes Suhm as Young Litvenko\n* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Le Clerq, the chairman of an organization called Syndicate International,<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> which is described as an international [[terrorist organization]] responsible for creating an army of unstoppable assassins in an effort to destroy the ICA.\n* [[Angelababy]] as Diana, the handler of Agent 47\n* [[Dan Bakkedahl]]<ref name=\"Bakkedahl\" /> as Sanders, an American diplomatic official in Berlin who interrogates Agent 47\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Tobias\n* [[Rolf Kanies]] as Dr. Delriego\n* [[Jerry Hoffmann]] as Franco\n\n==Production==\nOn February 5, 2013, it was reported that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing a new film based on the [[Hitman (franchise)|''Hitman'']] video games, with the title ''Agent 47'' derived from the lead character [[Agent 47]].

Critic Will Greenwald commented that \"It isn't a must-watch, and doesn't stand out as memorable or terrible, but it's enjoyable enough to at least feel like ''Hitman''... The premise feels like ''[[L\u00e9on: The Professional|The Professional]]''... And, as stupid as that all sounds, it's actually very loosely the plot of the first ''Hitman'' game, ''[[Hitman: Codename 47]]''... the first hour the film feels like a bizarre take on ''[[The Terminator]]''. The action is frantic and creative. Gunplay feels a bit like ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]'', which means it's eye-catching, brutal, and incredibly unrealistic... and it's entertaining despite not feeling as genuine and harsh as the action in ''[[Dredd]]'' or ''[[John Wick]]''... I liked ''Hitman: Agent 47'', but it's not a very good movie. It's uneven and weird, and while it's much more enjoyable than the previous ''Hitman'' film, it doesn't leave a very lasting impression. It's not ''[[Hitman (2007 film)|Hitman]]'' boring and it's not ''[[Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li]]'' bad or faithless to the source material, but it isn't consistently as strong as it could have been with a bit more logic in the writing and much less reliance on CG and film speed trickery to make the fights seem flashier (and faker). There are just too many little things that feel off for the big, eye-catching things to really stay with you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/review/hitman-agent-47-is-a-solid-7-but-not-quite-a-hit-1631167/|title=Hitman: Agent 47 is a solid 7, but not quite a hit - Reviews - Geek.com|work=@geekdotcom|access-date=September 3, 2015|archive-date=September 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906015347/http://www.geek.com/review/hitman-agent-47-is-a-solid-7-but-not-quite-a-hit-1631167/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Sci-Fi Movie Page awarded the film two stars out of five.
