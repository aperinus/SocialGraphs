Pimentel|Rodrigo Pimentel]]. Directed by [[Jos\u00e9 Padilha]] from a screenplay by Padilha, [[Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani]], and Pimentel, the film stars [[Wagner Moura]], Caio Junqueira, and Andr\u00e9 Ramiro. In ''Elite Squad'', Roberto Nasciemento (Moura), a [[Batalh\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Policiais Especiais]] (BOPE) captain, leads a crackdown on a series of [[Rio de Janeiro]] neighbourhoods to prepare for the 1997 state visit of [[Pope John Paul II]]. \n \nInspired by the [[Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State|Military Police]] and their related arms, ''Elite Squad'' is the second feature and first film by Padilha, after the documentary ''[[Bus 174]]'' (2002). \n\n''Elite Squad'' was an overwhelming critical and commercial success, and became a [[cultural phenomenon]] in Brazil. The film won the [[Golden Bear (award)|Golden Bear]] at the 2008 [[Berlin Film Festival]]. Its [[sequel]], ''[[Elite Squad: The Enemy Within]]'', released in Brazil on October 8, 2010, holds industry records in the country for ticket sales and gross revenue.\n\n==Plot==\nRoberto Nascimento, a BOPE captain, leads an operation to secure the Turano neighbourhood before [[Pope John Paul II]]'s overnight visit at the [[Archbishop]]'s home near the favela. With his wife Rosane pregnant, Roberto searches for a successor at the unit before switching to a desk job. \n\nRookie [[Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State|PMERJ]] officers and best friends Andr\u00e9 Matias and Neto Gouveia handle menial work as instructed to them by their corrupt seniors: Neto supervises the police [[auto mechanic]] shop, whilst Matias is responsible for registering and filing police complaints in a small archive office. Andr\u00e9 also attends [[law school]], where he begins a relationship with Maria, and meets her friends Roberta and Edu; all three are members of a [[Non-Governmental Organization|NGO]] that operates in an area ruled by drug lord Baiano. Baiano provides marijuana to Matias' friends, who sell it on campus. Andr\u00e9 also befriends Romerito, a boy who, like himself, suffers from [[myopia]].\n\nNeto applies to another department, but his transfer is denied. Disgusted by corruption led by fellow officer Fabio, Neto and Andr\u00e9 steal the police's [[bribe]] money to fix as many police cars as possible. Their superior, Captain Oliveira, finds out and demotes them to [[cook (profession)|kitchen work]] as punishment and orders Fabio - whom he believes stole from him - to meet drug traffickers at a community [[Funk carioca|funk]] party in [[Morro da Babil\u00f4nia]] to enquire about payment. \n\nFabio realizes is a set-up to kill him and discreetly warns Neto and Andr\u00e9, who rush to a vantage point at the party. They use a [[sniper rifle]] telescope to watch Oliveira and other policemen but Neto accidentally shoots, causing a deadly gunfight between the officers and thugs; as Andr\u00e9 and Neto attempt to flee the scene, Roberto and his men rescue all the officers. After the shootout, Andr\u00e9 is photographed by the press. Andr\u00e9 and Neto apply for BOPE, motivated by their honesty and devotion, and eagerness for action. At the NGO office, Baiano confronts Maria and her friends with a newspaper featuring Andr\u00e9's picture and threatens to kill them if they bring policemen inside his territory.\n\nBOPE training proves to be gruesome, with many candidates quitting the program, including Fabio (who applied as a way to avoid Oliveira), but both Neto and Andr\u00e9 pass; Neto celebrates by getting a BOPE [[tattoo]] on his arm. Andr\u00e9's relationship with Maria ends and he confronts Edu, ordering him to arrange a meet with Romerito the next day to give him a pair of glasses. Edu reveals Andr\u00e9' plan to Baiano, who sets an ambush to kill him. Neto informs Andr\u00e9 of a job interview at a law firm that will conflict with meeting Romerito, and volunteers to deliver the glasses in his place: this results in Neto being mortally wounded. When Baiano prepares to execute him, he notices his BOPE tattoo and goes into hiding for fear of retaliation.\n\nAfter Neto's funeral, Andr\u00e9, Roberto, and the men make daily incursions into Baiano's slum, torturing several dealers into revealing his whereabouts. After one of them reveals Edu tipped Baiano, Matias storms in a [[peace walk]] and violently beats Edu and insults Maria and the others. BOPE locate and corner Baiano: Roberto orders Andr\u00e9 to shoot Baiano in the face with a [[shotgun]], as revenge for Neto's death and his final test for BOPE. As Baiano pleads, Andr\u00e9 cocks the gun and the screen cuts to black as a shot is heard.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Wagner Moura]] as Roberto Nascimento - A captain in the BOPE squad, who is  awaiting a promotion that will make his job safer and enable him to spend time with his wife and newborn son.

The book was controversial at the time of release, in its description of the BOPE as a \"killing machine\", as well as the detailed allegation of an aborted assassination attempt on then left-wing governor of Rio de Janeiro, [[Leonel Brizola]], and reportedly resulted in Batista being reprimanded and censured by the Military Police.
