He dropped out of [[medical school]] after discovering his girlfriend kissing their teacher and he has not been social for more than a year. He is convinced to attend his best friend Allan's party, where he meets Allan's cousin Chantry. That same night, Allan meets Nicole and they become enamored with one another.\n\nWallace and Chantry leave the party and he walks her home, where he learns that Chantry is in a relationship. Nevertheless, she gives him her phone number, but he decides against calling her. They later run into each other at a movie theater and end up having dinner. The two form an instant connection, discussing various topics such as the [[Fool's Gold Loaf|Fool's Gold sandwich]]. They decide to become friends and Wallace is soon invited to meet Ben, Chantry's long-term boyfriend, an [[Lawyer|attorney]] who works for the [[United Nations]]. Ben ends up in the hospital after Wallace accidentally knocks him out of a window. At the hospital, Wallace and Chantry encounter Wallace's ex-girlfriend, Megan. Ben later moves to [[Dublin]] for six months for work, and Chantry continues her work as an [[animator]]. While Ben is gone, Wallace and Chantry's relationship continues to develop. Wallace struggles with his desire to tell Chantry how he feels, much to Allan's dismay.\n\nAllan and Nicole get married. After the reception, Chantry's younger sister Dalia tries to seduce Wallace in her car, but he does not reciprocate. Later on, Wallace and Chantry join Allan and Nicole for a bonfire on the beach and they decide to go [[skinny dipping]]. Allan and Nicole steal their clothes, forcing them to sleep naked together in a single sleeping bag. Feeling forced into an uncomfortable intimate situation, they express anger with their friends.\n\nFeeling guilty, Chantry travels to Dublin to see Ben. She discovers that Ben has accepted more work commitments that require him to travel frequently and she decides to end the relationship. Meanwhile, Wallace decides to go to Dublin to express his true feelings. He encounters Ben who punches him in the face. He learns that Chantry has returned to Toronto and wants to meet. At a diner, Wallace tells Chantry about the trip and his feelings for her and she responds unfavorably, informing that she has accepted a work promotion and will be moving to [[Taiwan]].\n\nHeartbroken, Wallace considers going back to medical school and moving on with his life; however, he decides to attend Chantry's farewell party and they have a tearful goodbye. They finally admit to their mutual feelings after gifting each other Fool's Gold, and they kiss.\n\nEighteen months later, Wallace and Chantry return home from Taiwan after becoming engaged. They marry and contemplate the rest of their lives while sitting on Wallace's rooftop.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as Wallace<ref name=\"MTV; cast\">{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Kara |date=18 October 2012 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1695816/daniel-radcliffe-teaches-us-about-f-word.jhtml |title=Daniel Radcliffe Teaches Us About 'The F Word' |publisher=MTV|access-date=20 July 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Zoe Kazan]] as Chantry<ref name=\"HUFF POST;
