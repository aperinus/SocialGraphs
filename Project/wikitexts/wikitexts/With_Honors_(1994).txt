While Monty is working on his senior [[thesis]], which takes a pessimistic view of citizens on public assistance, a power outage ruins his computer\u2019s hard drive. When he rushes out to print a backup copy of his thesis, he trips on the street, breaking his leg, and drops his thesis down a grating into the boiler room under [[Widener Library]]. There Monty finds a homeless man, resembling the writer [[Walt Whitman]], burning his thesis page by page. Monty calls the campus police who arrest the man, but they are unable to recover the thesis.\n\nIn court, Monty learns the man\u2019s name is Simon Wilder. Simon gets the worst of the charges against him dismissed, but is held in [[Contempt of court|contempt]], for which Monty pays the fine. Despite Simon\u2019s anger over Monty\u2019s having him arrested, they work out a deal: for every service Monty provides, Simon will return one page of his thesis. Monty takes Simon to the house, letting him stay in a broken down van in the backyard.\n\nOver time, Monty and Simon become close friends. Monty confides in Simon about his absent father, and Simon helps Monty see poor people like himself as human beings. Simon also shows Monty his collection of stones, each one representing a significant memory from his life. Monty\u2019s roommates begin to like the arrangement as well, with Courtney appreciating Monty\u2019s newfound open-mindedness and Everett giving Simon wine in exchange for repairing the van. However, Jeff refuses to let Simon stay in the house\u2019s basement on a particularly cold night because of his parents\u2019 visiting. When Monty lies to Simon about why he can\u2019t come in the house, Simon ends their deal and leaves.\n\nWhile everyone goes home for [[Academic year|Christmas vacation]], Monty stays to recompose his thesis. Simon sends a friend to deliver the thesis; he reveals where Simon is staying, but says he does not want to see Monty. Monty finds him living on the street, coughing and wheezing as a result of years of exposure to [[asbestos]] in the [[United States Merchant Marine|U.S. Merchant Marine]]. Monty agrees that Simon can live in the house and refuses his offer of a new deal. Simon gets disability benefits to help with the rent while Monty decides to completely rewrite his thesis. Courtney and Everett are supportive of Simon\u2019s moving in, but Jeff is still unwelcoming.\n\nRealizing the seriousness of his illness, Simon writes his [[obituary]], which reveals that he left his wife and child to join the Merchant Marine. Though initially angry, Monty eventually forgives him and takes him as his guest to a campus pajama party. As Monty watches Courtney dance with another man, Simon encourages Monty to confess his love for her. Courtney reciprocates and the two begin a relationship.\n\nMonty agrees to drive Simon to visit the son he abandoned, named Frank, despite the fact that doing so will delay his completion of his thesis. All the roommates, including Jeff, who has come to see Simon's humanity, make the long drive. Frank bitterly berates Simon for leaving him and is dismissive when Simon\u2019s granddaughter asks who he is. Before leaving, Simon adds a stone to his collection.\n\nSimon\u2019s condition deteriorates on the drive back to the house; the roommates stay up all night reading Walt Whitman to him before he dies. At his [[funeral]], Monty tearfully reads Simon\u2019s obituary where he refers to the roommates as his family, and states that Monty \u2018\u2019will graduate life with honor and without regret.\u201d\n\nMonty meets with his haughty mentor, Professor Pitkannan, and explains why he changed his thesis to a more optimistic subject. Professor Pitkannan accepts his explanation, but tells Monty his lateness means that he will not [[Latin honors|graduate with honors]]. Monty thanks him for his mentorship. He also returns the Walt Whitman book to Widener Library, symbolically leaving Simon\u2019s spirit there.\n\nThe roommates graduate and Monty begins his own collection of memory stones.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Simon B. Wilder\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Montgomery \"Monty\" Kessler\n* [[Moira Kelly]] as Courtney Blumenthal \n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Everett Calloway\n* [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] as Jeffrey Hawkes \n* [[Gore Vidal]] as Professor Pitkannan\n* [[James Deuter]] as Judge\n* [[Mara Brock Akil]] as Ms. Moore\n* [[Shanesia Davis]] as Dr. Cecile Kay\n* [[Claudia Haro]] as Marty\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot at various locations in [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Massachusetts]], including the Harvard University campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The exterior of [[Winthrop House]] appears, but the interiors pictured are not that of actual [[Harvard College#House system|Harvard houses]], and the last scene of the movie was shot at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. The [[building]]s and surroundings were dressed up to look as if it were Harvard and many of the people in the final scene are Illinois [[students]]. The graduation scene was shot while the local climate in Illinois had not allowed for the trees to bloom leaves and so artificial branches and leaves were stapled on. All of the outdoor shots of Harvard's [[Widener Library]] had the University of Minnesota's [[Northrop Auditorium]] in that role. The scene in which Simon Wilder and Professor Pitkannan debate the role of the president in American democracy was filmed in Lincoln Hall at Northwestern Law School.{{citation needed|date=June  2015}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received predominantly negative reviews from critics.
