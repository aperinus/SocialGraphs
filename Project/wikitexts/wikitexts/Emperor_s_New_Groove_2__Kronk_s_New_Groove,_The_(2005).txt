The film is the [[sequel]] and [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] to the 2000 animated film ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', and features reprises of the [[voice actor|roles]] of [[David Spade]], [[John Goodman]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Patrick Warburton]] and [[Wendie Malick]] from the first film, with new voices by [[John Mahoney]] and [[Tracey Ullman]]. It was also the last film to feature the voice of [[John Fiedler]], who died six months before it was released.\n\n==Plot==\nEmperor Kuzco ([[David Spade]]) narrates the story about [[Kronk Pepikrankenitz]] ([[Patrick Warburton]]), now chef and Head Delivery Boy of Mudka's Meat Hut, who is fretting over the upcoming visit of his father. Kronk's father always disapproved of young Kronk's culinary interests and wished that Kronk instead would settle down with a wife and a large house on a hill.\n\nIn a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]], Kronk tells the story of how he almost had both of these. As unwitting accomplice to [[Yzma]] ([[Eartha Kitt]]) \u2013 the villainess of the first film who turned into a cat at the end of the original, but is now human again despite still having a tail \u2013 he goes along with her plan to sell sewer slime as a youth potion. He makes enough money to buy the old folks' home from the old folks and put his large new home there. Eventually, Yzma is revealed as a fake and the old folks chase her down and corner her at a bridge over a river full of crocodiles. To prevent them from attacking her, she transforms herself into a rabbit, but is then caught and taken away by a condor. When Kronk realizes the old folks have sold everything they own in return for something which doesn't work, he gives his home back to them.\n\nKronk, as camp counselor of the Junior Chipmunks at Camp Chippamunka, falls in love with fellow counselor Miss Birdwell ([[Tracey Ullman]]); but when one of his Chipmunks, Tipo, pulls a prank to win the camp championships and is caught, Kronk, feeling responsible for the situation (due to having previously told his Chipmunks to do whatever it took to win), protects the boy at the cost of alienating his love.\n\nKronk's father ([[John Mahoney]]) arrives and confusion ensues as several supportive friends try to pass themselves off to him as Kronk's wife and kids. But in the end, Kronk realizes that his wealth is in his friendships, and this finally wins his father's thumbs up and Miss Birdwell's love.\n\nMeanwhile, just outside the house, Yzma is in the condor's nest with two eggs, which hatch and presumably attack her before the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The Emperor's New Groove characters}}\n\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as Kronk\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Miss Birdwell\n* [[Eartha Kitt]] as Yzma\n* [[David Spade]] as Kuzco\n* [[John Goodman]] as Pacha\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Chicha\n* [[John Mahoney]] as Papi\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Rudy\n* [[Bob Bergen]] as Bucky\n* Eli Russell Linnetz as Tipo\n* [[Patti Deutsch]] as Waitress\n* Jessie Flower as Chaca\n* Anthony Ghannam as Huayna\n* [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]] as Skinny Old Man / Stout Old Man / Gollum-Rudy\n* [[April Winchell]] as Hildy / Marge / Tina\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|0% approval rating]] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on {{RT data|count}} reviews and an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.<ref>{{cite Rotten Tomatoes |id=kronks_new_groove |title=Kronk's New Groove |type=m |access-date={{RT data|access date}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> Pam Gelman of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the film two out of five stars, stating that the film's story \"is disjointed with unnecessary attempts at humor that are clearly geared for parents\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/kronks-new-groove|title=Kronk's New Groove - Movie Review|date=10 February 2006|work=www.commonsensemedia.org|access-date=19 June 2020}}</ref> David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews states the main character \"works best in small doses; forced to carry an entire movie, Kronk becomes tedious and (unbelievable as it seems) unfunny.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reelfilm.com/empkronk.htm#kronk|title=The Emperor's New Groove & Kronk's New Groove - Reviews by David Nusair|work=www.reelfilm.com|access-date=19 June 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Annie Awards==\nThe film was nominated in 2006 for the following Annie Awards:<ref>{{cite web|title=33rd Annual Annie Nominations and Awards Recipients|url=http://annieawards.org/33rd-annie-awards|publisher=International Animated Film Society ASIFA Hollywood|access-date=January 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\n* Best Home Entertainment Production \n* Best Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production \n* Best Writing in an Animated Feature Production\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{official website|http://movies.disney.com/the-emperors-new-groove-2-kronks-new-groove}}\n* {{bcdb title|63399}}\n* {{IMDb title|0401398}}\n\n{{The Emperor's New Groove}}\n{{Disney direct-to-video animated features}}\n\n[[Category:2005 films]]\n[[Category:2005 animated films]]\n[[Category:2005 direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:2000s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:American sequel films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video sequel films]]\n[[Category:Disney direct-to-video animated films]]\n[[Category:DisneyToon Studios animated films]]\n[[Category:Films about sportspeople]]\n[[Category:Films about potions]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Tony Leondis]]\n[[Category:Indigenous cinema in Latin America]]\n[[Category:The Emperor's New Groove (franchise)]]\n[[Category:2005 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about witchcraft]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Jeanine Tesori]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mark Watters]]\n[[Category:Animated films about squirrels]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]"}]}}}}
