({{lang-de|Go for Zucker!}}) is a [[Cinema of Germany|German]] [[comedy film]], released internationally in 2004. It can be seen as part of the \"[[Ossi (East Germans)|Ossi]]-[[Wessi]]\" confrontation within Germany. Directed by [[Dani Levy]], the cast includes [[Henry H\u00fcbchen]], [[Hannelore Elsner]], [[Udo Samel]], [[Go\u0142da Tencer]] and [[Steffen Groth]].\n\nDirector Dani Levy, himself [[Jew]]ish, has made an ironic comedy about modern [[Jewish identity]] in present-day Germany. Henry H\u00fcbchen stars as Jaecki Zucker.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Henry H\u00fcbchen]] as Jakob \"Jaeckie Zucker\" Zuckermann\n* [[Hannelore Elsner]] as Marlene Zucker\n* [[Udo Samel]] as Samuel Zuckermann\n* [[Go\u0142da Tencer]] as Golda Zuckermann\n* [[Steffen Groth]] as Thomas Zuckermann\n* [[Anja Franke]] as Jana Zuckermann\n* [[Sebastian Blomberg]] as Joshua Zuckermann\n* [[Elena Uhlig]] as Lilly Zuckermann\n* [[Rolf Hoppe]] as Rabbi Ernst Ginsberg\n* [[Inga Busch]] as Irene\n* [[Andreas Herder]] as Gay male nurse\n* [[Renate Kr\u00f6\u00dfner]]\n* [[Klaus Wowereit]] as Himself\n\n== Plot and details ==\nJakob Zuckermann alias Jaeckie Zucker is Jewish. But he says he's got nothing to do with \"that club\", ever since his mother and his little brother left him behind the [[Iron Curtain]] in [[East Germany]] when he was young. Therefore, when he learns of the death of his mother, he does not care. However he has to care. His younger brother pays him a visit with his family, because according to Jewish tradition, they have to observe the seven-day [[Shiv'ah]] period of mourning, and their ''Mamme's'' will requires them to reconcile in the presence of the [[rabbi]] and the family. If they fail, her assets will be bestowed upon the Jewish community of Berlin, and not them.<ref name=\"filmportal\" />\n\nMost of the scenes were shot at [[Tegel Airport]], [[Karl-Marx-Allee]], [[Alexanderplatz]], [[Oranienburger Stra\u00dfe]] and the [[Jewish Cemetery Wei\u00dfensee]] in Berlin. The [[Mayor of Berlin]] [[Klaus Wowereit]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as himself.\n\n[[Poland|Polish]] actress [[Golda Tencer]] does not speak German, even though she spoke her own lines fluently. She had the German text written down on small pieces of paper, hidden in her purse. During the movie she can sometimes be seen looking down into her purse.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThe soundtrack by Niki Reiser is light and jovial, featuring some ''[[klezmer]]'' music as well.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe movie was co-funded by the television channels [[Arte]] and the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]]. It is one of the very few movies about German Judaism that does not have the [[Shoah]] in the centre, but is a comedy about the crazy twists and turns of fate that befall a family that finds itself again. The two Jewish families are more symbolic of the current problems and past tragedies of the division of Germany between East and West, and how the country and its people are struggling to find to each other again. This division affected every German, regardless of their religion. The film depicts in a comic manner the divisions within Judaism between a secularised Jew from the former GDR who has to reconcile himself with his Orthodox brother from the West.\n\nThe film has been termed \"an audacious, politically incorrect, self-ironical Jewish comedy\". It was critically acclaimed in Germany and won a number of awards, most notably the 2005 [[Deutscher Filmpreis]] in several categories.<ref name=\"filmportal\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist\n| refs =\n\n<ref name=\"filmportal\">\n{{cite news\n|url = http://www.filmportal.de/en/movie/alles-auf-zucker_ee07ac8225d6bc4ae03053d50b3715a6\n|title = Alles auf Zucker!\n|newspaper = filmportal.de\n|accessdate = 31 July 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0416331|title=Alles auf Zucker!}}\n* [http://www.artfilm.ch/allesaufzucker.php DVD] at artfilm.ch {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{German Film Award for Best Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alles Auf Zucker!}}\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Berlin]]\n[[Category:2000s German-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:2004 comedy films]]\n[[Category:German comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dani Levy]]\n[[Category:Cue sports films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
