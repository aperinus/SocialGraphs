Based on the play ''[[The Deputy]]'' by [[Rolf Hochhuth]], the film examines the political and diplomatic relationship between the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. It stars [[Ulrich Tukur]], [[Mathieu Kassovitz]], [[Sebastian Koch]], [[Ulrich M\u00fche]], [[Ion Caramitru]], and [[Marcel Iure\u015f]]. It was a co-production between French, German, and Romanian studios.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[52nd Berlin International Film Festival]], where it was nominated for the [[Golden Bear]]. It was nominated for seven [[C\u00e9sar Awards]], including for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won the award for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Adaptation|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Costa-Gavras and [[Jean-Claude Grumberg]]).\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring World War II, [[Kurt Gerstein]], a [[Waffen-SS]] officer employed in the SS Hygiene Institute, designs programs for the purification of water and the destruction of vermin. He is shocked to learn that the process he has developed to eradicate [[typhus]], by using a [[hydrogen cyanide]] mixture called [[Zyklon B]], is now being used for killing [[Jews]] and other \"undesirables\" in [[extermination camp]]s. Gerstein attempts to notify [[Pope Pius XII]] about the gassings, but is appalled by the lack of response he gets from the Catholic hierarchy. The only person moved is Riccardo Fontana, a young [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest. Fontana and Gerstein attempt to raise awareness about what is happening to the Jews in Europe but even after Fontana appealing to the pope himself, the Vatican makes only a timid and vague condemnation of Hitler and [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nEventually Gerstein travels to [[Rome]] to speak to the Pope himself but is not allowed. When he arrives the Germans are [[Operation Achse|taking control]] of Rome and begin rounding up the [[History of the Jews in Italy|Italian Jews]] to be sent to the death camps. Fontana begs the Pope to force the Germans to stop the deportation by appearing at the train station in person but the Pope refuses, saying that doing so will cause hardship for the Christians living under Nazi Germany. In disgust and sorrow Fontana puts the Jewish Star-of- David [[yellow badge]] on himself and presents himself to be taken on the train of Jews being deported to the death camps. When he arrives at the camp Fontana is interrogated by the head of the camp, a powerful 'friend' of Kurt Gerstein known simply as the Doctor, who despite knowing that the war is lost and that Fontana is a Catholic priest, allows Fontana to stay with the Jews and work in the crematorium, and eventually orders him gassed.\n\nGerstein attempts to save Fontana but he will not leave. The Doctor escorts Gerstein out of the camp as Fontana and the remaining Jews continue to be murdered. They drive by German soldiers digging up and burning the bodies of previously murdered Jews in a mass grave near the camp, and the Doctor asks Gerstein if he knows any contacts to help get him out of Germany. Gerstein returns home and gathers all his evidence that documents the Nazi atrocities and takes them to the Allies. Despite accepting his evidence he is still arrested and after reading the charges against him he is found hanged in his cell. Afterward the Doctor is seen speaking to a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] in Rome asking for help leaving the country saying \"I'm a doctor, just a physician\" and the cardinal agrees to help send him to [[Argentina]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Ulrich Tukur]] as [[Kurt Gerstein]]\n* [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] as Riccardo Fontana\n* [[Ulrich M\u00fche]] as The Doctor\n* [[Michel Duchaussoy]] as The Cardinal\n* [[Ion Caramitru]] as Conte Fontana\n* [[Marcel Iure\u015f]] as [[Pope Pius XII]]\n* [[Friedrich von Thun]] as Ludwig Gerstein\n* [[Antje Schmidt]] as Elfriede Gerstein\n* [[Hanns Zischler]] as [[Ernst-Robert Grawitz]]\n* [[Sebastian Koch]] as [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]]\n* [[Erich Hallhuber]] as Von Rutta\n* [[Angus MacInnes]] as Tittman\n* Bernd Fischerauer as [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Bishop von Galen]]\n* [[Pierre Franckh]] as Pastor Wehr\n* [[Richard Durden]] as Ambassador Taylor\n* [[Monica Bleibtreu]] as Mrs. Hinze\n* [[Justus von Dohn\u00e1nyi]] as [[G\u00f6ran von Otter]]\n* G\u00fcnther Maria Halmer as [[F.
