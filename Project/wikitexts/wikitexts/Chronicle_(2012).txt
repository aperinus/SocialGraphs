It follows three [[Seattle]] high school seniors, bullied Andrew ([[Dane DeHaan]]), his cousin Matt ([[Alex Russell (actor)|Alex Russell]]), and more popular Steve ([[Michael B. Jordan]]), who form a bond after gaining telekinetic powers from an unknown object and using them for fun, although Andrew begins going down a darker path.\n\n''Chronicle'' premiered at the G\u00e9rardmer Film Festival on January 28, 2012, and released in the United States on February 3, 2012 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film grossed $126.6 million at the international box office, against a budget of $15 million. The film received generally positive reviews with praise for the premise, and received a nomination for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] at the [[39th Saturn Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nFriendless [[Seattle]] teenager Andrew Detmer endures frequent abuse from bullies and his alcoholic father, Richard, while also coping with his loving mother Karen's battle with [[cancer]]. He begins to videotape his life. His cousin, Matt Garetty, invites him to a party to help him mingle, but his filming causes an altercation with an attendee who throws his drink in Andrew's face. Popular student Steve Montgomery finds a crying Andrew outside the party, and asks him to come record a large hole he and several partygoers came across in the woods. Accompanied by a drunken Matt, they journey through a small tunnel where they discover a glowing crystalline object, which causes inexplicable phenomena as they approach it. As the object begins to react violently, Matt is thrown backwards against a wall by an unseen force, Steve develops a [[nosebleed]] and the camera shorts out.\n\nWeeks later, Andrew, Matt, and Steve have developed [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities. They develop a close friendship, using their abilities to play and record pranks, which goes too far after Andrew telekinetically pushes a motorist off the road and into a nearby pond. After the trio barely manage to save the man's life, Matt realizes how dangerous their powers can be and insists that they restrict use of them, particularly against living beings or when they are angry. This traumatic event marks the first turning point in the film, specifically through the eyes of Andrew.\n\nAfter discovering they can fly, the friends agree to fly around the world together following graduation, with Andrew in particular desiring to visit [[Tibet]] because of its peaceful nature. Steve encourages Andrew to enter the school talent show, where the latter amazes his fellow students by disguising his powers as a magic act. Andrew relishes his newfound popularity at a house party, but the night ends in disaster when a drunken Andrew goes upstairs to have sex with a classmate who he subsequently vomits on. Steve, who has taken over the camera from Matt after the latter leaves the party with an old flame, films the aftermath of the incident as an angry and humiliated Andrew yells on.\n\nAs Karen's condition worsens, Andrew becomes increasingly withdrawn and aggressive. When Richard strikes him during an argument, Andrew violently repels him and flees the house. Steve and Matt suffer nosebleeds\u2014indicating when the others are overexerting their powers\u2014and Steve flies out to find Andrew sobbing in the middle of a storm. He attempts to console him, but Andrew becomes increasingly frustrated before Steve is suddenly struck by lightning and killed. Some days later, Andrew denies responsibility when confronted by Matt at Steve's funeral, but privately begs for forgiveness at Steve's grave the next day, believing that his powers are taking over him and he misses him.\n\nDue to the incident at the party as well as Steve's death, Andrew's relationship with Matt grows strained and he is once again ostracized at school. After using his powers to rip teeth out of a bully's mouth in front of a crowd of other students when he is taunted about the party, Andrew begins to identify as an [[apex predator]] and rationalizes that he should not feel guilty for using his powers to hurt those weaker than him. Desperate to pay for his mother's medication, Andrew disguises himself with his father's firefighter gear and uses his powers to steal money. While robbing a gas station, he inadvertently causes an explosion that puts him in the hospital. At his bedside, a distraught Richard informs an unconscious Andrew that Karen has died and angrily blames Andrew for her death. As his father is about to strike him, Andrew awakens and abruptly grabs his arm before blowing out the wall of the room.\n\nElsewhere, while at a birthday party, Matt experiences a severe nosebleed and senses Andrew is in trouble. Seeing a news alert on TV about a mysterious explosion downtown, he and his girlfriend, Casey, head to the hospital. As they arrive on scene, Andrew flies out of the hospital room, dangling his father before unceremoniously dropping him. Matt flies up and saves Richard, lowering him to the ground, before attempting to reason with Andrew. However, Andrew is too far gone in his rage and attacks Matt. Their fight takes them across the city, crashing through buildings and hurling vehicles. Eventually, the two exhaust themselves and wind up in a plaza where police surround them. Andrew's rage reaches a breaking point and he begins to destroy the buildings around him. Realizing that Andrew can't be stopped or reasoned with, Matt reluctantly impales Andrew with a spear from a nearby statue, killing him instantly. Despite his injuries, Matt is able to fly away before the police can reach him.\n\nSome time later, Matt lands in Tibet with Andrew's camera, tearfully apologizing to him and vowing to use his powers for good and find out what happened to them. He points the camera at a Tibetan monastery in the distance before flying away, leaving the camera behind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dane DeHaan]] as Andrew Detmer\n* [[Alex Russell (actor)|Alex Russell]] as Matt Garetty\n* [[Michael B.

Up-and-coming screenwriter [[Jeremy Slater]] had collaborated with Trank while working on an unmade [[spec script]]. By 2010, Slater had moved on, leading to Trank contacting [[Max Landis]], who agreed to co-write the film. The first draft of the script was written in three weeks after Landis had pitched the film behind Trank's back. Trank's original draft had the character of Steve being hit by a plane and dying in the middle of the second act. Landis removed this from his revisions, which \"solved the entire second act\". [[20th Century Fox]] bought the rights to the project and greenlit the film with Trank serving as director in January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patches|first=Matt|url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/5/21246679/josh-trank-capone-interview-fantastic-four-chronicle|title=The Post-Disaster Artist|date=May 5, 2020|website=Polygon|access-date=January 13, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nFor budgetary reasons, the film was shot primarily in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, with Film Afrika Worldwide, as well as in [[Vancouver]], Canada.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\">{{cite journal | last = Holben | first= Jay | date = March 2012 | title = Power Trip | journal = [[American Cinematographer]] | location = Hollywood, California | pages = 42\u201349 | publisher = ASC Holding Corp.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcontact.com/south-africa/cape-town-stars-location-us-box-office-smash-hits |title=Cape Town stars as the location for US box office smash hits |work=filmcontact.com |date=14 February 2012 |access-date=19 February 2012 |archive-date=17 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617052222/http://www.filmcontact.com/south-africa/cape-town-stars-location-us-box-office-smash-hits |url-status=dead }}</ref> Trank cited the films ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' and ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]'' as influences on ''Chronicle''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Woerner |first=Meredith |title=Chronicle captures every teen's fantasy of fighting back, say film's creators |url=http://io9.com/5881852/chronicle-is-a-movie-about-every-teens-fantasy-of-fighting-back |publisher=[[io9]] |access-date=25 May 2012 |date=February 2, 2012 }}</ref> Filming started in May 2011 and continued for eighteen weeks, ending in August 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcontact.com/south-africa/cape-big-star-us-film-crew-rolls |title=Cape the big star as US film crew rolls in |work=filmcontact.com |date=15 May 2011 |access-date=3 March 2012 |archive-date=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041417/http://www.filmcontact.com/south-africa/cape-big-star-us-film-crew-rolls |url-status=dead }}</ref> Cinematographer [[Matthew Jensen (cinematographer)|Matthew Jensen]] used the Arri Alexa video camera to shoot the film and Angenieux Optimo and Cook s4 lenses.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/> Postproduction techniques were used to give it a \"found footage\" look.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/> A cable cam rig was used for a shot in which the character Andrew levitates his camera 120 feet into the air.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/> The Arri Alexa camera was mounted on a skateboard to simulate Andrew's camera sliding across a floor.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/> Stuntmen were suspended from crane wire rigs for flying scenes, with green screen special effects used for closeups of the actors.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/> Andrew's video camera in the movie is a Canon XL1 MiniDV, and he later switches to an HD camera that resembles a Canon Vixia HF M30.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/> His \"Seattle\" bedroom is actually a set that was constructed on a film studio stage in Cape Town.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/> Because in South Africa, vehicles drive on the left side of the road and have steering wheels on the right side, American-style vehicles had to be shipped in for the production.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/> DVD dailies were provided to the director and cinematographer by the Cape Town firm HD Hub.<ref name=\"AmeriCinematographer\"/>\n\nAccording to Josh Trank, Max Landis was banned from set during production and Trank has not spoken to him since 2012.
