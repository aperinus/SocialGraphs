It tells the story of a nuclear coverup. It was adapted by Rama Stagner, Arlene Sarner and Jerry Leichtling. The original music score was composed by [[Jack Nitzsche]].\n\nFilmed from May 14 to July 16, 1990,<ref>[https://shotonwhat.com/blue-sky-1994 shotonwhat:Blue Sky (1994)] Retrieved April 4, 2017</ref> the film was completed in 1991, but because of the [[bankruptcy]] of [[Orion Pictures]], it sat on the shelf until 1994, three years after Richardson's death on November 14, 1991, making this his final film. Despite this, it won critical praise and Lange won the 1994 [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], along with the [[Golden Globe Award]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] award.\n\nThe film is based on Rama Stagner-Blum's real life and the relationship between her parents, Clyde and Gloria Lee Moore-Stagner, during the 1960s while her father was in the army. They later divorced and Gloria remarried before dying in 1982.<ref>[http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/1994/10/01/173135-a-life-magnified/ A life magnified] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012034833/http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/1994/10/01/173135-a-life-magnified/ |date=October 12, 2014 }} Retrieved July 30, 2015</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1962, [[Major]] Hank Marshall (Jones) and his wife, Carly (Lange), are having marital problems because of the pressures of his job and her [[mental illness]]. Hank is a [[nuclear engineering|nuclear engineer]] who favors underground [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testing]], an initiative code-named \"Blue Sky\", as opposed to above-ground, open-air detonations. Carly is a free spirit who appears to be mentally unbalanced and who is slowly being suffocated by domestic torpor and encroaching age. Her behavior embarrasses him, especially given the restrictions that prevail within a military base. Their move from [[Hawaii]] to an isolated base in [[Alabama]] alarms their oldest daughter, Alex (Locane), and sends Carly into a violent tantrum.\n\nThe following day, Hank has his first meeting with base commander [[Colonel]] Vince Johnson (Boothe), who rebuffs his underground testing initiative despite strong scientific support. Meanwhile, Vince's wife Vera (Snodgress) welcomes Carly and invites her to a party organized by the base officers' wives. Carly gets drunk at the party and demonstrates exotic dancing skills. Vera begs her husband to do something about her, to which Vince agrees but says he'll have to get Hank out of the way first.\n\nAlex starts dating Vince's son Glenn (O'Donnell) and on their first date finds what she takes to be a dud grenade. It explodes, alerting the whole base to their relationship and giving Vince more reason to get rid of Hank. Carly is invited by the other officers' wives to join them for a dance recital, and fills her time rehearsing for it. Hank is sent to the [[Nevada Test Site]] to supervise the first underground test under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Robert Jennings (McClendon).\n\nDuring the first test, Hank notices two [[cowboy]]s in the test area and attempts to have Robert abort the test, but Robert refuses, explicitly telling Hank that he is not concerned with the cowboys' health or their lives, and sends Hank back to Alabama. While Hank is away, Alex and Glen discover Vince sent Hank away just so he could have an [[affair]] with Carly.\n\nHank learns of the affair at the dance recital and reacts violently, which results in Carly being pushed out a window and requiring hospitalization.  Hank is arrested, and Vince offers Carly a choice: Hank can be [[court-martial]]ed or she can have him committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When Hank learns what his wife did, he explains to her that he wanted to be court martialed in order to bring the incident with the cowboys out in public.  He quickly realizes that Vince set him up, but MPs take him to the hospital before he can do anything about it.\n\nThe hospital keeps him so heavily sedated he is unable to leave. Carly, suspecting there is a reason for this, digs through Hank's papers and finds the report about the two cowboys. She drives across the country with her daughters and finds the cowboys with visible [[radiation sickness]]. She begs them to bring their story to the press, but the cowboys refuse, so she steals one of their horses and rides into the test site, intent on repeating their experience to get the attention of the press. She is arrested, which gets the attention of the press, and Robert is forced to let her, and Hank, go.\n\nShe returns home to find Hank waiting for her, having quit that morning, and that Vince has been relieved of his duties. Hank tells her he found a new engineering job in the [[private sector]] in California, and the family happily moves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Hank Marshall\n* [[Jessica Lange]] as Carly Marshall\n* [[Powers Boothe]] as Vince Johnson\n* [[Carrie Snodgress]] as Vera Johnson\n* [[Amy Locane]] as Alex Marshall\n* Anna Klemp as Becky Marshall\n* [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Glenn Johnson\n* [[Mitchell Ryan]] as Ray Stevens\n* [[Dale Dye]] as Col.
