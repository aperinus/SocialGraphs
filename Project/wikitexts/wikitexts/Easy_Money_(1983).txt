It was directed by [[James Signorelli]] and written by Dangerfield, Michael Endler, [[P. J. O'Rourke]] and [[Dennis Blair (comedian)|Dennis Blair]]. The original music score was composed by [[Laurence Rosenthal]].  [[Billy Joel]] performed the theme song \"Easy Money\" from his album ''[[An Innocent Man]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nMontgomery \"Monty\" Capuletti is a hard-living, heavy-drinking, pot-smoking, gambling family man who makes his living as a baby photographer in [[New Dorp, Staten Island]]. He loves his wife Rose but has a very tense relationship with his wealthy, snobbish mother-in-law, Mrs. Monahan, who runs a successful department store chain and hates the way Monty acts and lives.  There is an added ethnic rivalry between Monty and his wife's family, as he is Italian and they are Irish.\n\nThe irresponsible Monty cannot even pick up a [[wedding cake]] for his engaged daughter Allison without fouling up. He and his best friend Nicholas 'Nicky' Cerone are smoking marijuana while driving, and an accident destroys the cake. Allison's wedding to Julio goes off without a hitch, at least until the wedding night.\n\nAfter Mrs. Monahan dies unexpectedly, his family is in for an inheritance. Attorney Scrappleton reveals that Mrs. Monahan left a stipulation in her will that if Monty is able to curb his vices for a year by going on a diet and giving up drugs and gambling, he will receive $10 million. If not, the family gets nothing. Monty's gambling and drinking buddies are also interested in whether or not Monty can really give up everything and bet whether or not he will make it.\n\nMonty and Nicky go to the mother-in-law's department store and find awkward fashions, catering to a clientele which clearly do not include the likes of Nicky and Monty. Nicky argues that it may not be worth it to Monty if this is the kind of atmosphere he will be exposed to, but Monty points out he must tough it out to provide for his wife and daughters, not just him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Monahan's scheming nephew Clive Barlow does his best to undermine Monty's resolve so the money and department store can instead be left to him.\n\nMonty ultimately reforms. When the entire year is up, he and the family celebrate aboard a boat. To his chagrin though, Mrs. Monahan turns up. She had [[Faked death|faked her own death]] simply to persuade her slovenly son-in-law to straighten up. Ultimately though, she gives the money to Monty on the basis he upheld her stipulation. Now rich, Monty and his family live in a mansion. Still in control, Mrs Monahan denies Monty dessert and coffee then commands a beer she found in the refrigerator be thrown out. Monty gleefully agrees to each action then says he's heading out for a walk. Mrs. Monahan gloats about her actions and that she finally has Monty under control to her daughter's chagrin. However, Monty has actually proceeded to a hideaway under the house to join Nicky and his friends for pizza, poker, and beer.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rodney Dangerfield]] as Montgomery \"Monty\" Capuletti\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Nicky Cerone\n* [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]] as Mrs. Kathleen Monahan\n* [[Candice Azzara|Candy Azzara]] as Rose Monahan Capuletti\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Allison Capuletti Ocampo\n* [[Jeffrey Jones]] as Clive Barlow\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Julio Ocampo\n* [[Tom Noonan]] as Paddy\n* [[Val Avery]] as Louie, The Bartender\n* [[Tom Ewell]] as Daniel Scrappleton\n* [[Lili Haydn]] as Belinda Capuletti\n* [[Kimberly McArthur]] as Ginger Jones\n* [[Jeff Altman|Jeffrey Altman]] as Bill Jones\n* [[Arch Johnson]] as Armory Vendor\n* [[Mary Pat Gleason]] as Party Mother\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Easy Money'' opened theatrically on August 19, 1983 and earned $5,844,974 in its opening weekend, ranking number one at the domestic box office, toppling the prior three-week #1 run of ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1983&wknd=33&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for August 19-21, 1983 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=August 22, 1983}}</ref> By the end of its run, the film grossed $29,309,766.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=easymoney.htm | title=Easy Money (1983) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 64% approval rating based on 11 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1006425-easy_money/ | title=Easy Money (1983) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | access-date = 2022-04-08}}</ref>  Writing in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', critic [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film three stars out of four. He wrote that \"the big discovery in the comedy 'Easy Money' is that Rodney Dangerfield, unlike most stand-up comics, does not need dialogue to be funny. He is funny just standing still--or his version of standing still, which includes nervous twitching, profuse sweating, pained expressions and rolling of the eyes.\" Siskel also called ''Easy Money'' \"a film that's easy to like\" and also praised Pesci's performance, calling him \"the unsung hero of 'Easy Money,' an actor whose very appearance gives this little film a lot of class.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Gene |last=Siskel |title=Funny how Rodney Dangerfield strikes it rich in 'Easy Money' |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=D5 |date=August 19, 1983 }}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a mixed rating, 2.5 stars out of 4. While Dangerfield had many funny scenes, Ebert felt the film was poorly-edited and suffered by blunting the \"cynical and hard-edged\" elements of Dangerfield's stage persona in an attempt to make him more likable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/easy-money-1983|title = Easy Money movie review & film summary (1983) &#124; Roger Ebert}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1983]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0085470|Easy Money}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|1006425-easy_money}}\n*{{AFI film|id=57937|title=Easy Money}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Easy Money (1983 Film)}}\n[[Category:1983 films]]\n[[Category:1983 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films directed by James Signorelli]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Rodney Dangerfield]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Laurence Rosenthal]]\n[[Category:1983 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
