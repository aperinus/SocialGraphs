It stars [[Jamie Foxx]] in the [[title role]], along with [[Kerry Washington]], [[Clifton Powell]], [[Harry Lennix]], [[Terrence Howard]], [[Larenz Tate]], [[Richard Schiff]] and [[Regina King]] in supporting roles. Along with Hackford, the film was also produced by [[Stuart Benjamin]], [[Howard Baldwin]] and Karen Baldwin.\n\nIt was released on October 29, 2004, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Foxx's performance. It was also a commercial success, grossing $124.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $40 million.\n\n''Ray'' received [[List of accolades received by Ray (film)|many accolades and nominations]] and was nominated in six categories at the [[77th Academy Awards]]. For his performance, Foxx won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] as well as the [[62nd Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]], [[58th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], [[11th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild]], and [[10th Critics' Choice Awards|Critics' Choice]], becoming the second actor to win all five major lead actor awards for the same performance, and the only one to win the Golden Globe in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Musical or Comedy]] category, rather than in [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Drama]].\n\nCharles had planned to attend a screening of the completed film but died of liver disease in June 2004, months prior to the premiere.<ref name=\"MusicLegendRay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/music-legend-ray-charles-dies-73-wbna5182959 |title=Music legend Ray Charles dies at 73 |agency=Associated Press |date=October 10, 2004 |access-date=August 31, 2013}}</ref>\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nRay Charles Robinson is raised in poverty in [[Florida]] by his mother, Aretha. Learning to play piano at an early age, Ray is haunted by the accidental death of his younger brother George, who drowns in their mother's washbasin. Ray loses his vision and by age seven is completely blind. Aretha teaches him to be independent, eventually sending him to a school for the deaf and blind.\n\nIn 1946, Ray joins a white country band and wears sunglasses to hide his damaged eyes. Two years later, he travels to [[Seattle]] and joins a nightclub band, though the club's owner demands sexual favors and controls his money and career. After discovering he is being exploited, Ray signs his own record deal and leaves the band. Touring on the [[Chitlin' Circuit]] as \"Ray Charles\", he is introduced to [[heroin]].\n\nRay is discovered by [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of [[Atlantic Records]] and records his first hit with Ertegun's song \"[[Mess Around]]\". In [[Houston]], Ray falls in love with Della Bea, a preacher's daughter. Though she and others are unhappy about Ray mixing [[gospel music|gospel]] with his music, he marries Della and continues to gain fame with \"[[I Got a Woman]]\" and \"[[Hallelujah I Love Her So]]\".\n\nA pregnant Della finds Ray\u2019s drug kit and confronts him. They reconcile after the birth of their first child, but Ray begins an affair with singer [[Mary Ann (Ray Charles song)|Mary Anne Fisher]]. In 1956, as Ray's popularity grows, he hires a trio to become \"[[The Raelettes]]\" and immediately falls for lead singer [[Margie Hendrix]]. They begin their own affair, and a jealous Mary Anne leaves.\n\nA few years later, when Ray's band finishes a set early and the club\u2019s owner demands they play the remaining time, Ray performs \"[[What'd I Say]]\" on the spot. His popularity rises through the 1950s and he moves his family to [[Los Angeles]] but continues to use heroin, straining his relationships with Della and Margie. In 1960, he signs a better contract with [[ABC Records]], negotiating to own his [[mastering (audio)|master tapes]].\n\nRay continues to experiment with his music, writing such hits as \"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\". Margie reveals she is pregnant, and cuts off their affair when Ray demands she end the pregnancy. He writes \"[[Hit the Road Jack]]\" with a solo by Margie, who uses her newfound recognition to embark on a solo career, while Ray struggles with his addiction.\n\nIn 1961, Ray encounters civil rights protestors outside his concert in [[Augusta, Georgia]]. Deciding not to play at the segregated venue, he cancels the concert and is banned from playing in Georgia. After he allows black and white audience members to dance together onstage during a concert in [[Indianapolis]], his hotel room is raided by police. His arrest for heroin possession is made public, to Della\u2019s dismay, but his record label has the charges dismissed.\n\nIn [[St. Louis]], Ray performs the country-influenced \"[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]\" and is impressed by announcer [[Joe Adams (actor)|Joe Adams]], who joins his tour. Ray moves his family to [[Beverly Hills]], and learns that Margie has died of an overdose. Joe alienates Ray\u2019s band and his longtime friend and manager Jeff Brown, whom Ray fires.\n\nIn 1965, Ray returns from a concert in [[Montreal]] and is again arrested for heroin possession. Dismissing his excuses, Della pleads with him to overcome his habit, and he is sentenced to [[drug rehabilitation]]. Suffering vivid nightmares during withdrawal, Ray has a vision of George and their mother, who chastises him for letting his addictions cripple him.\n\nBy 1979, Ray has permanently quit heroin and receives an official apology from the state of Georgia, which names \"Georgia On My Mind\" the official state song. Ray goes on to have a long and successful career as a world-famous entertainer until his death in 2004.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits and order, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as [[Ray Charles Robinson]]\n** [[C.

Taylor Hackford said in a DVD bonus feature that it took 15 years to make the film; or more specifically, as he later clarified in the liner notes of the soundtrack album, this is how long it took him to secure the financing. It was made on a budget of $40 million.\n\nCharles was given a [[Braille]] copy of the film's original script; he objected only to a scene showing him taking up piano grudgingly, and a scene implying that Charles had shown mistress and lead \"Raelette\" Margie Hendricks how to shoot [[heroin]].<ref name=\"MusicLegendRay\" />\n\n[[Denzel Washington]] was offered to play the title role, but he passed on the project.<ref name=\":0\" /> As stated in the DVD commentary, Foxx does not sing as Charles with exception to cover versions Charles performs in his earlier years. [[Kanye West]] and [[Ludacris]] have since made songs with Foxx singing as Charles in their songs \"Gold Digger\" and \"Georgia\", respectively.\n\nHackford stated in the DVD commentary that while Anschutz said the film would be made, he demanded that it be PG-13, and this caused him to walk away from the film five times. Because of Charles and [[Ahmet Ertegun]] asked him to make the movie, he agreed to do the film as a PG-13 rating.  The film was rated PG-13 for \"depiction of drug addiction, sexuality and some thematic elements\".\n\nIn the DVD commentary, Hackford stated that no studio was interested in backing the movie. After it was shot independently, Universal Pictures stepped in to distribute it. Part of the reason Universal Pictures released it was because one of its executives used to hitchhike to Ray Charles concerts.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Ray (2004) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350258/trivia|access-date=2021-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe film's score was composed by [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]].
