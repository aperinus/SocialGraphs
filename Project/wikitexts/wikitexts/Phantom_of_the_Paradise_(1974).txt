In the film, a na\u00efve young singer-songwriter (played by [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]]) is tricked by legendary but unscrupulous music producer Swan (Williams) into giving up his life's work, a rock opera based on the [[Faust]] legend. The composer dons a bizarre new persona to terrorize Swan's new concert hall in revenge and to have his favorite singer, Phoenix (played by [[Jessica Harper]]), perform his music.\n\nThe story is a loosely adapted mixture of several classic European works: [[Gaston Leroux]]'s 1910 novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1890 ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', and ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' by [[Goethe]]/[[Christopher Marlowe]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Szpirglas |first1=Jeff |title=Looking back at Brian De Palma's Phantom Of The Paradise |url=https://denofgeek.com/us/movies/18364/looking-back-at-brian-de-palmas-phantom-of-the-paradise |website=Den of Geek! |publisher=Den of Geek}}</ref>\n\nThe film was a [[Box office bomb|box office failure]] and received negative reviews contemporaneously, while earning praise for its music and receiving [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations. However, over the years, the film has received much more positive reviews and has become a [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\nSinger-songwriter Winslow Leach is heard by acclaimed [[record producer]] Swan as Winslow plays an original composition following a set run through by the 1950s-style [[nostalgia]] band the Juicy Fruits, which Swan produces. Swan believes Winslow's music perfect to open The Paradise \u2014 Swan's highly anticipated new concert hall \u2014 and has his right-hand man Arnold Philbin steal it, under the guise of producing Winslow.\n\nOne month later, Winslow goes to Swan's Death Records to follow up about his music but is thrown out. He sneaks into Swan's private mansion and observes several women rehearsing his music for an audition. One is Phoenix, an aspiring singer whom Winslow deems perfect for his music. Winslow realizes Swan's plan to open the Paradise with his music after he is thrown out again. In response, he disguises himself as a woman to sneak in and try to speak to Swan. Swan has Winslow beaten and framed for drug dealing. Winslow is given a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] in [[Sing Sing]] prison and his teeth are extracted and replaced with metal ones as part of an experimental prisoner program to decrease infection amongst inmates, funded by the Swan Foundation.\n\nSix months later, Winslow hears that the Juicy Fruits have made an anticipated hit record of his music with Swan's backing. After a breakdown, he escapes prison in a delivery box and breaks into the Death Records building. A guard startles Winslow as he is destroying the records and presses, causing him to slip and fall face first into a record press, which crushes and burns the right half of his face, also destroying his [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]]. He barely manages to escape the studio, falling into the [[East River]] as the police arrive.\n\nA disoriented, and now deformed, Winslow sneaks into The Paradise's costume department and dons a long, black cape and a silver, owl-like mask, becoming the Phantom of the Paradise. He terrorizes Swan and his musicians and nearly kills the Beach Bums (formerly the Juicy Fruits, who have traded doo-wop for [[surf music]]) with a bomb while they are playing a heavily reworked version of Winslow's own Faust song. The Phantom confronts Swan, who recognizes him as Winslow and offers the composer a chance to have his music produced his way. In a specially built recording studio, Swan provides the Phantom with an electronic voice-box, enabling him to speak and sing. Swan asks Winslow to rewrite his cantata with Phoenix in mind for the lead. Although Winslow agrees and signs a contract in blood, Swan breaks the deal by telling Philbin that he resents Phoenix's perfection for the role. The Phantom completes ''Faust'', but Swan replaces Phoenix with a pill-popping male [[glam rock]] [[prima donna]] named Beef in the lead of Winslow's ''Faust'' and relegates Phoenix to backup.\n\nSwan steals the completed cantata and seals the Phantom inside the recording studio with a brick wall. Winslow escapes and confronts Beef, in a comic allusion to the shower scene in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', and threatens to kill him if he performs. Beef tries to flee, but is forced by Philbin to stay and play with the band the Undeads (the Juicy Fruits/Beach Bums rebranded again as a glam/goth act) who now all resemble Cesare the Somnambulist from ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''. As Beef performs, the Phantom, hidden in the rafters, strikes and electrocutes Beef with a stage prop. Horrified, Philbin orders Phoenix onstage and she is an immediate sensation.\n\nSwan seduces Phoenix in her dressing room after the show with promises of stardom. As she leaves, she is spirited away by the Phantom to the roof. The Phantom tells Phoenix his true identity and implores her to leave The Paradise so Swan won't destroy her too. But Phoenix does not recognize or believe him and flees. At Swan's mansion, the Phantom observes Swan and Phoenix in a tight embrace. Heartbroken, he stabs himself through the heart with a bowie knife. However, Swan tells the Phantom that he cannot die until Swan himself has died. The Phantom attempts to stab Swan, but Swan is unharmed. Looking down at Winslow, Swan hisses in an almost reptilian voice, \"I'm under contract, too.\"\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' announces the wedding between Swan and Phoenix during ''Faust''{{'}}s finale. The Phantom learns that Swan made a [[deal with the Devil|pact with the Devil]] in 1953: Swan will remain youthful forever unless the videotaped recording of his contract is destroyed, and photos age and fester in his place. The tape reveals footage of Winslow signing his contract with Swan and a new one Swan made with Phoenix. On a live television camera, the Phantom realizes Swan is planning to have Phoenix assassinated during the ceremony. He destroys all the recordings and heads off to the wedding.\n\nDuring the wedding, an extravaganza with dancing women dressed as black birds (alluding to ''[[Swan Lake]]''), the Phantom stops the assassin from hitting Phoenix, who instead shoots and kills the Pope-costumed Philbin. The Phantom swings onto the stage and rips off Swan's mask, exposing him as a decaying monster on live television. A crazed Swan attempts to strangle Phoenix but the Phantom intervenes and stabs him repeatedly. In doing so, the Phantom's own stab wound reopens and he starts bleeding. As he is dying, Swan is carried around by the audience, who join in the mania, stabbing him. The dying Winslow removes his mask to reveal his own face and holds out a hand to Phoenix. Swan dies, allowing Winslow to die of his own wound. As Winslow succumbs, Phoenix finally recognizes him as the kind man she met at Swan's mansion and embraces him as he dies.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[William Finley (actor)|William Finley]] as Winslow Leach / The Phantom \n* [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] as Swan / The Phantom's singing voice\n* [[Jessica Harper]] as Phoenix\n* [[Gerrit Graham]] as Beef\n* [[Raymond Louis Kennedy]] as Beef's singing voice\n* [[George Memmoli]] as Arnold Philbin (named in tribute to [[Mary Philbin]] who starred as Christine in the 1925 film version of ''[[Phantom of the Opera]]'')\n* [[Archie Hahn (actor)|Archie Hahn]], Jeffrey Comanor, and [[The Times Square Two|Peter Elbling]] (credited as Harold Oblong) as The Juicy Fruits / The Beach Bums / The Undead\n* [[Rod Serling]] (uncredited) as Introductory voice\n* [[Janus Blythe]] as Groupie \n* Mary Margaret Amato as Swan's Groupie\n*[[Rainbeaux Smith|Cheryl Smith]] as Groupie\n\n==Musical numbers==\nThe film's [[soundtrack album]] features all songs excluding \"Never Thought I'd Get to Meet the Devil\" and \"Faust\" (1st Reprise).

He was worried about whether the machine would be safe, and the crew assured that it was. The press was fitted with foam pads (which resemble the casting molds in the press), and there were [[Chock (wheel)|chocks]] put in the center to stop it from closing completely. Unfortunately, the machine was powerful enough to crush the chocks and it gradually kept closing. Finley was pulled out in time to avoid injury.\n\nThe electronic room in which Winslow composes his cantata, and where Swan restores his voice, is in fact the real-life recording studio [[Record Plant Studios|The Record Plant]]. The walls covered with knobs are in reality an oversize custom-built electronic synthesizer dubbed [[TONTO's Expanding Head Band#The TONTO synthesizer|TONTO]], which still exists to this day.\n\nThe City Center concert hall in New York City provided the exterior for The Paradise; interior concert scenes were filmed at the [[Majestic Theatre (Dallas, Texas)|Majestic Theater]] in Dallas, Texas.
