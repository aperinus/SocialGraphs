The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the [[River Thames]] at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband, Clem ([[Walter Pidgeon]]), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby ([[Christopher Severn]]) and Judy ([[Clare Sandars]]), and an older son, Vin ([[Richard Ney]]), a student at [[Oxford University]]. They have live-in staff: Gladys, the housemaid ([[Brenda Forbes]]), and Ada, the cook ([[Marie De Becker]]).\n\nAs [[World War II]] looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon ([[Teresa Wright]]), granddaughter of Lady Beldon ([[Dame May Whitty]]) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements\u2014mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism\u2014they fall in love. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \"do his bit\", and enlists in the [[Royal Air Force]], qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and can signal his safe return from operations to his parents by \"blipping\" his engine briefly (rapidly open and closing the throttle, which results in short, sharp roars of sound) as he flies over the house. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic, but more honest, proposal than he had envisioned. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat, the ''Starling'', to assist in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]].\n\nEarly one morning, Kay, unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded [[Nazi Germany|German]] pilot ([[Helmut Dantine]]) hiding in her garden, and he takes her to the house at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the [[Third Reich]] will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk.\n\nLady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her granddaughter's comparative youth at age eighteen. Kay reminds Her Ladyship that she, too, had been young\u2014sixteen, in fact\u2014when she married her late husband. Lady Beldon concedes defeat and realizes that it would be futile to try to stop the marriage. Vin and Carol marry; Carol has now also become a Mrs. Miniver, and they return from their honeymoon in [[Scotland]]. A key theme is that she knows Vin is likely to be killed in action, but their short love will fill her life. Later, Kay and her family take refuge in their [[Anderson shelter]] in the garden during an air raid, and attempt to keep their minds off the frightening bombing by reading ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', which Clem refers to as a \"lovely story\". They barely survive as a bomb destroys part of Starlings. The Minivers take the damage with nonchalance.\n\nAt the annual village flower show, Lady Beldon silently disregards the judges' decision that her rose is the winner. Instead, she announces that the rose entered by the local stationmaster, Mr. Ballard ([[Henry Travers]]), named the \"Mrs. Miniver\", as the winner, with her own Beldon Rose taking second prize. As air raid sirens sound and the villagers take refuge in the cellars of Beldon Hall, Kay and Carol drive Vin to join his squadron. On their journey home, they witness fighter planes in a dogfight. For safety, Kay stops the car, and they see a German plane crash. Kay realizes Carol has been wounded by machine-gun fire from the plane, and takes her back to Starlings. She dies a few minutes after they reach home. Kay is devastated. When Vin returns from battle, he already knows the terrible news. Ironically, he is the survivor, and Carol the one who died.\n\nThe villagers assemble at the badly damaged church where their vicar affirms their determination in a powerful sermon:\n\n{{blockquote|We in this quiet corner of England have suffered the loss of friends very dear to us, some close to this church. George West, choirboy. James Ballard, stationmaster and bellringer, and the proud winner only an hour before his death of the Beldon Cup for his beautiful Miniver Rose. And our hearts go out in sympathy to the two families who share the cruel loss of a young girl who was married at this altar only two weeks ago. The homes of many of us have been destroyed, and the lives of young and old have been taken. There's scarcely a household that hasn't been struck to the heart. And why? Surely, you must have asked yourselves this question? Why, in all conscience, should these be the ones to suffer? Children, old people, a young girl at the height of her loveliness? Why these? Are these our soldiers? Are these our fighters? Why should they be sacrificed?<p>I shall tell you why. Because this is not only a war of soldiers in uniform. It is the war of the people, of ''all'' the people. And it must be fought not only on the battlefield, but in the cities and in the villages, in the factories and on the farms, in the home and in the heart of every man, woman, and child who loves freedom. Well, we have buried our dead, but we shall not forget them. Instead, they will inspire us with an unbreakable determination to free ourselves, and those who come after us, from the tyranny and terror that threaten to strike us down. This is the People's War. It is ''our'' war. ''We'' are the fighters. Fight it, then! Fight it with all that is in us! And may God defend the right.}}\n\nA solitary Lady Beldon stands in her family's church pew. Vin moves to stand alongside her, united in shared grief, as the members of the congregation rise and stoically sing \"[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]\". The camera pans to empty sky showing through the gaping hole in the bombed church's roof.

Over the several months the screenplay was written, the U.S. moved closer to war. As a result, scenes were rewritten to reflect Americans' increasingly pro-British and anti-German outlooks. For example, the scene where Mrs. Miniver confronts a downed German flyer in her garden was made more confrontational with each new version.\n\nFollowing the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] that brought the U.S. into the war, the garden scene was re-filmed to reflect the tough, new spirit of a nation at war. The key difference was that in the new version of the scene, filmed in February 1942, Mrs. Miniver was allowed to slap the flyer across the face.
