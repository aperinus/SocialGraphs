The film stars [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Kathryn Erbe]], [[Illeana Douglas]] and [[Kevin Dunn]].\n\nIn the film, telephone worker Tom Witzky (Bacon) begins experiencing a series of frightening visions after insisting he was [[hypnotized]] by his sister-in law, Lisa (Douglas).\n\n''Stir of Echoes'' was released in the United States on September 10, 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nTom Witzky is a phone lineman living in a working-class neighborhood in [[Chicago]] with his pregnant wife Maggie and his son Jake, who possesses the ability to commune with the dead. At a party one evening, Tom challenges Maggie's sister, Lisa, who is a believer in [[paranormal activity]], to hypnotize him. After putting him under, Lisa plants a [[post-hypnotic suggestion]] in Tom urging him to \"be more open-minded\". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior.\n\nWhile Tom and Maggie attend a high-school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Tom senses Jake is in danger and sees strange flashes of red light that lead him to the [[Metra|Metra station]] where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake.\n\nWhen Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an [[intellectual disability]], with the mental capacity of an eight-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. After another prophetic vision in which Frank tells Tom that \"they're going to kill you and Maggie both,\" Tom finds that Adam has shot himself in Frank's home and is in critical condition.\n\nDuring an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; a policeman named Neil recognizes Jake's unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of like-minded people to learn more about what is happening to his son. Maggie goes to the meeting herself, and Neil tells her the spirit that contacted Tom has asked for something and will grow upset if it does not get done. As predicted, Samantha begins plaguing Tom, leading to his insomnia. Samantha tells him to dig. Tom complies and digs holes in the backyard and tears up the house in a desperate attempt to appease Samantha.\n\nWhile Maggie and Jake attend her grandmother's [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] at a relative's house, Tom inadvertently knocks down a shoddy brick wall in the basement and discovers Samantha's mummified remains. He receives a vision showing him that before his family moved in, Adam and Kurt lured Samantha into the house to rape her. When she resisted, they unintentionally suffocated her and hid her body. Tom brings Frank back to the basement to disclose to him the crime. Frank breaks down and admits that Adam and Kurt had already confided their secret to him and Harry. Frank pulls out a gun and demands to be alone. As Tom leaves, he hears a single shot.\n\nHarry and Kurt corner Tom with the intention of killing him, but Maggie interrupts. As Harry takes her hostage, Frank emerges and fatally shoots Kurt and Harry. Tom notices Samantha's spirit smile and disappear. Afterward, the family moves out of the house. Samantha's mother and sister are able to give her a proper burial. Jake covers his ears as his family approaches their new home, overwhelmed by all of the spirits that linger in the houses they pass by.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Tom Witzky \n* [[Kathryn Erbe]] as Maggie Witzky\n* Zachary David Cope as Jake Witzky\n* [[Illeana Douglas]] as Lisa \n* [[Jennifer Morrison]] as Samantha Kozac\n* [[Liza Weil]] as Debbie Kozac\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Frank McCarthy \n* [[Lusia Strus]] as Sheila McCarthy\n* Chalon Williams as Adam McCarthy\n* Conor O'Farrell as Harry Damon\n* Steve Rifkin as Kurt Damon\n* Eddie Bo Smith Jr. as Neil\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe novel ''[[A Stir of Echoes]]'' was written by [[Richard Matheson]], of whom director [[David Koepp]] is an avid fan. Koepp had decided he wanted his next project to be a horror film;<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Stir of Echoes  |type=audio commentary |people=[[David Koepp]] (director) |publisher=[[Artisan Entertainment]]}}</ref> his love for the screen-adapted ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' (1971), as well as Matheson's work on ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' (1959), contributed to his decision to purchase a copy of ''A Stir of Echoes'', which he bought from a [[used bookstore]].<ref name=\"fangoria\">{{cite magazine |last=Grey |first=Ian |date=September 1999 |title=''Stir of Echoes'': A Chicago Ghost Story |magazine=[[Fangoria]] |volume=186 |pages=20\u201324, 82 |issn=0164-2111}}</ref> Producer [[Gavin Polone]] then secured the rights to the book.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Koepp remembered being high-strung when approaching Matheson to ask for his thoughts on his script, terrified that the changes he made in the story may displease the author. Matheson, who expressed admiration for Koepp's directorial debut film ''[[The Trigger Effect]]'' (1996), responded positively to his draft and gave him his approval: \"I'm sure he's done a good job of it. I do know what he's done before, and it's quite good. He has a very good touch,\" he said. Among Koepp's influences for the film were [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), and [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983).<ref name=\"fangoria\"/>\n\nThe film was produced by [[Artisan Entertainment]] on a budget of $12 million.

Koepp felt that many hypnosis scenes in films are \"most skipped by\", so he came up with the idea of allowing viewers see through Bacon's point-of-view as he undergoes hypnosis to make the concept fresh. The theater from this sequence is located in [[Joliet, Illinois]].<ref name=\"commentary\"/> Bacon's tooth extraction scene, which was inspired by a nightmare Koepp had about dying of [[ageing|age]], was achieved with [[practical effect]]. Koepp told ''Entertainment Weekly'':\n\n{{blockquote|text=We blacked out Kevin's tooth and built a cap to go over it, so he's pulling out a cap that comes off fairly easily, and he gives some grunts and groans and we added grotesque, crunching flesh noises\u2026 while he's pulling out the tooth, he's [also] palming a real tooth in his other hand [to drop into the sink].
