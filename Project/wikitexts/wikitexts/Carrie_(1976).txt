Cohen]], adapted from [[Stephen King]]'s [[Carrie (novel)|1974 epistolary novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Sissy Spacek]] as [[Carrie White]], a shy 16-year-old who is consistently mocked and bullied at school. The film also features [[Piper Laurie]], [[Amy Irving]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], [[William Katt]], [[P. J. Soles]], [[Betty Buckley]], and [[John Travolta]] in supporting roles. It is the first film in the [[Adaptations of Carrie|''Carrie'' franchise]].\n\nThe film was based on King's first published novel. De Palma was intrigued by the story and pushed for the studio to direct it while Spacek was encouraged by her husband to audition. It is the first of [[List of adaptations of works by Stephen King|more than 100]] film and television productions adapted from, or based on, the published works of King.\n\nTheatrically released on November 3, 1976, by [[United Artists]], ''Carrie'' became critically and commercially successful, grossing over $33.8 million against its $1.8 million budget. It received two nominations at the [[49th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Spacek) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Laurie). Critics and audience members alike widely cite it as the best adaptation of the novel amongst the numerous films and television shows based on the character, as well as one of the best films based on King's publications.\n\nThe film has significantly influenced popular culture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classicfilm.about.com/od/earlysciencefiction/fr/CarrieReview.htm |title=Carrie Movie Review \u2013 Stephen King's Teen Horror Classic Carrie \u2013 the Movie |publisher=Classicfilm.about.com |date=April 10, 2012 |access-date=October 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503004000/http://classicfilm.about.com/od/earlysciencefiction/fr/CarrieReview.htm# |archive-date=May 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> with several publications regarding it as [[List of films regarded as the greatest ever|one of the greatest horror films ever made]].

When Carrie experiences her [[Menarche|first period]] in the school shower, she panics, having never been told about menstruation. Carrie's classmates throw tampons at her while chanting \"Plug it up!\" until the gym teacher, [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Collins]], intervenes. Following conversations with Miss Collins and the principal, Carrie is dismissed from school for the day. After arriving home, Margaret tells Carrie that her menstruation was caused by sin, and she locks Carrie in an altar-like \"prayer closet\" to pray for forgiveness. At school, Collins reprimands Carrie's tormentors, punishing them with a week-long detention during gym class. She threatens that those who skip the punitive measure will be suspended for three days and barred from the upcoming prom. However, Carrie's longtime bully, the wealthy and popular Christine \"Chris\" Hargensen, walks out and gets excluded from the prom.\n\nPlotting vengeance against Carrie, Chris and her boyfriend Billy Nolan break into a farm and kill pigs to drain their blood into a bucket, which they place above the school's stage in the gymnasium. Norma, Chris' best friend and a prominent figure in the school's student council regime, plans to rig the Prom Queen election in Carrie's favor to get her on the stage. Meanwhile, [[Sue Snell]], a deeply remorseful classmate, asks her handsome and popular boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to invite Carrie to the prom. Carrie believes the proposition is a prank, but he insists that it is genuine and she reluctantly accepts after Miss Collins consoles her. At home, she begins to discover that she has [[telekinesis]] as she shakes off her shyness. Despite Margaret's protests, Carrie puts on a flattering dress and hairstyle for the prom. Margaret sees Carrie's telekinetic powers and denounces her as a witch before Carrie leaves with Tommy.\n\nDuring the prom, Chris and Billy hide under the stage while the other conspirators switch the ballots to ensure that Carrie wins the Prom Queen title. As Carrie stands onstage with Tommy, finally beginning to feel accepted by her peers, Sue realizes Chris and Billy's plan, and begins to intervene. Miss Collins spots Sue and, thinking that she is up to no good, throws her out of the prom. Chris and Billy pull the rope attached to the bucket of pig blood, dousing Carrie; they then sneak out of the school. The empty bucket hits the outraged Tommy in the head, and he collapses. The crowd is left shocked and speechless at the prank, but Carrie hallucinates that everyone, even Miss Collins, is mocking her and, in a sudden outburst, telekinetically seals the exits and controls a fire hose, which injures several party-goers attempting to escape and sprays the overhead lights. Miss Collins is crushed by a falling basketball backboard and Carrie's principal and teacher are electrocuted, setting the gym on fire. Carrie exits the gym and seals the doors behind her, trapping staff and classmates. As Carrie walks home, Chris and Billy attempt to run her over with Billy's car but Carrie causes their car to overturn and explode, killing them.\n\nAfter Carrie bathes herself at home, Margaret reveals that Carrie was conceived when her husband was drunk, an act that Margaret shamefully admits she enjoyed. She comforts Carrie, and then stabs her in the back with a kitchen knife and begins chasing her through the house. Carrie levitates several sharp implements and sends them flying toward Margaret, crucifying her; then, she destroys the house and perishes.\n\nSome time later, Sue, the only survivor of the prom, has a nightmare in which she goes to lay flowers on the charred remains of Carrie's home, upon which stands a \"For Sale\" sign vandalized in black paint with the words: \"Carrie White burns in Hell!\". Suddenly, Carrie's bloody arm reaches from beneath the rubble and grabs Sue's forearm. Sue wakes up screaming and writhing in terror as her mother tries to comfort her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n<!-- The following are in the order the end credits.

In addition, Donaggio scored two pop songs (\"Born to Have It All\" and \"I Never Dreamed Someone Like You Could Love Someone Like Me\") with lyrics by Merrit Malloy for the early portion of the prom sequence. These songs were performed by Katie Irving (sister of Amy Irving and daughter of Priscilla Pointer).

The film updated the events of the story to modern-day settings and technology while simultaneously attempting to be more faithful to the book's original structure, story, and specific events. However, the ending was drastically changed: Instead of killing her mother and then herself, the film has Carrie killing her mother, being revived via [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] by Sue Snell and being driven to Florida to hide. This new ending marked a complete divergence from the novel and was a signal that the film served as a pilot for a ''Carrie'' television series, which never materialized. In the new ending, the rescued Carrie vows to help others with similar gifts to her own. Although Bettis' portrayal of Carrie was highly praised, the film was cited by most critics as inferior to the original.<ref name=\"million\">{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/news/sb/2002-11-04#tv5 |website=Internet Movie Database |title=TV Reviews: \"Carrie\" |date=November 4, 2002 |access-date=September 8, 2006 |archive-date=February 28, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228151951/http://imdb.com/news/sb/2002-11-04#tv5 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===2013 remake===\n{{main|Carrie (2013 film)}}\nIn 2011, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Screen Gems]] acquired the novel rights to adapt ''Carrie'' to film once more.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mgm-screen-gems-team-carrie-190369|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Borys|last=Kit|title=MGM, Screen Gems Team for 'Carrie' Remake|date=May 19, 2011|access-date=November 15, 2019|archive-date=November 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112054042/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mgm-screen-gems-team-carrie-190369|url-status=live}}</ref> Playwright [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] wrote the script as \"a more faithful adaptation\" of King's novel but shared a screenplay credit with the 1976 film's writer Lawrence D.
