The film follows three friends\u2014Thomas ([[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]]), Costa ([[Oliver Cooper]]) and J.B. ([[Jonathan Daniel Brown]])\u2014who plan to gain popularity by throwing a party, a plan which quickly escalates out of their control.\n\nThe title ''Project X'' was initially a placeholder for a final title, but interest generated by the secretive title kept it in place. A nationwide open casting call was employed to find fresh faces. The majority of the cast were sourced from this casting call, but a few with prior acting credits, such as Mann, were accepted after multiple auditions. Filming took place on sets in Los Angeles over five weeks on a US$12 million budget. The film is [[Found footage (film technique)|presented as a home video]] from the perspective of an attendee using a camera to document the night's events.\n\n''Project X'' was released in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom on March 2, 2012, and grossed over $100&nbsp;million worldwide during its theatrical run. Criticism focused on the \"loathsome\" behavior of the lead characters and the disregard for the effects of [[Recreational drug use|drug use]].<ref name=\"RevTelegraph\"/> Other reviews considered it funny and thrilling, and equated it to a modern incarnation of the 1978 comedy ''[[Animal House]]''. Following release, incidents of large-scale parties referenced or blamed the film as an inspiration.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- DO NOT remove this notice. TRY AND KEEP THIS SUMMARY AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE, WE DO NOT NEED A FULL FLEDGED PLOT SUMMARY -->\nIn [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], high school students Costa and J.B. plan to throw a party for their friend Thomas' 17th birthday, aiming to increase their popularity. Thomas' parents go away for the weekend, leaving him alone in the house, but warn him not to have too many people over, and not to drive his father's [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]]. Thomas is reluctant to have the party at his house, but Costa continues with his plan and hires A/V student Dax to chronicle the night's events. While Costa, J.B., and Dax advertise the party throughout the school, Thomas himself invites his best friend Kirby, who has a crush on him, and Alexis, a popular girl in their school that Thomas has his own crush on. Whilst shopping for party supplies, the boys have a chance encounter with [[Miles Teller]] (himself) and nervously invite him to the party only to discover that the celebrity has already heard about it through the grapevine and plans to attend.\n\nThe trio then visits drug-dealer T-Rick to buy [[marijuana]] wherein Costa steals his lawn gnome to use as a party mascot. As they leave, T-Rick discovers the theft and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, partygoers arrive en masse, Miles Teller included. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and pool house with the house guarded by Everett and Tyler, two young security guards hired by Costa. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on [[Craigslist]] and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend. Things escalate quickly as the party draws the ire of the neighbors and the police arrive, responding to a noise complaint. However the partygoers hide and remain silent, convincing the officers that the party has already ended. The police leave and the party resumes.\n\nMiles Teller smashes T-Rick's gnome, revealing that it contains large amounts of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] tablets, which are quickly consumed by the partygoers, including Thomas and his friends. Thomas kisses Kirby and reveals that he loves her. Alexis meanwhile flirts with Thomas throughout the night and eventually seduces him. Kirby walks in on the pair as they are about to have sex and leaves the party upset, as does Alexis, upset with Thomas running off and being secretly filmed. The noise and chaos of the party, including violence and mass property destruction, which has now spilled into the surrounding neighborhood, receives televised news coverage with helicopters flying over the house. A [[dwarfism|dwarf]] guest drives Thomas' dad's Mercedes into the pool after being put into an oven by other partygoers earlier.\n\nT-Rick arrives armed with a flamethrower, setting fire to trees, cars and houses in the neighborhood in search of Costa and in an attempt to reclaim his gnome, forcing the guests to flee and the party to end. The police shoot his flamethrower pack and it explodes. Thomas, Costa, J.B., and Dax flee with the other guests as Thomas' house (and the rest of the neighborhood) is left aflame and the [[SWAT]] team moves in to retake the neighborhood. By morning, the boys return to their respective homes to discover what punishment awaits them. After his parents return, Thomas' father commends him for throwing such a large party because he thought he was a loser, but reveals that Thomas is very much in deep trouble as his college fund will be used to pay for the damages. At school, the boys are cheered by the students and Thomas reconciles romantically with Kirby.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that T-Rick survived the explosion and is arrested for his actions; Thomas is convicted for disturbing the peace, contributing to the delinquency of minors, and inciting a riot, but is also voted as most likely to succeed by his classmates; while Costa and J.B. are acquitted; the former having a competent and expensive lawyer but awaits results of three separate paternity tests, and the latter's parents convincing the court that he is mentally incapable and unfit to stand trial but is forced to ride the short bus for the remainder of high school. Dax, meanwhile, is under investigation for the disappearance of his parents. In a television interview with [[Jillian Barberie|Jillian Reynolds]], Costa invites her to his next party instead of giving an apology.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]] as Thomas Kub<br />Mann had prior acting experience, in the feature film ''[[It's Kind of a Funny Story (film)|It's Kind of a Funny Story]]'' (2010), and was told he could not audition for ''Project X'' because the producers wished to cast only people without acting credits.

Actors were required to provide videos of themselves telling embarrassing or funny stories, or dancing.<ref name=\"ColliderApr20\"/> However, traditional casting was still employed to allow actors with little professional acting credits to audition.<ref name=\"ColliderApr20\"/><ref name=\"DeadlineApr19\"/> The process allowed traits of the selected actors to be incorporated into their characters, including in several cases, their respective characters taking the actors' names.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=4}} In casting the three leads, the production avoided solo casting and instead had a group of three actors auditioning together, switching out and adding different actors to see which group worked best together.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=5}}\n\nThe casting of low-profile actors aided in keeping the production budget low by avoiding the larger salaries attached to stars.<ref name=\"DeadlineApr112010\"/> To prepare for the role and create a believable friendship between the leads, Brown, Cooper, and Mann were sent to [[Disneyland]] together and spent a weekend in a cabin at [[Big Bear City, California]].<ref name=\"NextMovieFeb27\"/>{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=5}}\n\n===Principal photography===\n{{Quote_box|width=27%|align=right|quote=\"''Project X'' was filmed on eight different camera systems.

Many of the same extras were brought back for multiple nights of filming, and would continue to party between scenes. Periodic takes of up to 20 minutes were made of just extras dancing.<ref name=\"NextMovieFeb27\"/> During filming, Burbank police were called to the set concerning noise complaints made by nearby residents.<ref name=\"RedEye\"/>\n\n''Project X'' was filmed in [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] style, only displaying the events of the film through the first-person view of the cameraman observing the party, to create the effect of the audience being in attendance at the out of control party.<ref name=\"ColliderApr20\"/> Nourizadeh stated that the style allowed the film to seem \"real\" and \"show some of the realities of what kids do\". [[Cinematographer]] Ken Seng and Nourizadeh tested twelve different camera systems before choosing the digital-HD Sony F23 video camera, basing their decision on its ability to handle sudden extreme changes in lighting due to natural daylight and [[strobe light]]s.{{Sfn|Production|2011|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe film is primarily presented from the perspective of the character Dax and his camera, but Nourizadeh also obtained footage by providing the cast and extras with recording devices such as [[BlackBerry]]s and [[iPhone]]s to capture events occurring outside of the perspective or knowledge of the cameraman. This resulted in hours of unusable footage that had to be observed by Nourizadeh and his team to find segments that could be incorporated into the final film. Nourizadeh stated \"when you have real material being shot by real people, it then kind of feels like it is. It is found footage. I hated spending 10 hours looking through bits of flip footage \u2013 people didn't press stop, it's like in their pockets.

Hewitt labeled the characters \"unrepentant, nihilistic, vile, venal, animalistic, avaricious, charmless, entitled, sub-Kardashian, stunningly irresponsible brats\". Hewitt ended his review by stating that the film was \"possibly the worst film of the last 20 years. It's certainly the worst comedy of the last 20 years\".<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/> Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' was similarly critical, calling it \"grimly depressing, glumly unfunny teensploitation\", but admitted that it would \"enthrall a portion of the high school/college age demographic it depicts, just as it alternately outrages, confounds and disgusts other, presumably older audiences.\"<ref name=\"RevTHR\"/> ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Claudia Puig found the film treated female characters poorly, labeling it a \"heinous, misogynistic movie filled with faceless crowds and nary a character who resembles an actual human being\",<ref name=\"RevUSAToday\"/> a sentiment echoed by Melissa Anderson of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' who felt the film promoted \"skull-numbing hedonism without consequences\", and \"second-nature misogyny\", and that the only purpose of the male characters is to \"'get high, fuck bitches.'\"<ref name=\"RevVillage\"/>\n\nRobbie Collin of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' called the film \"flamboyantly loathsome on every imaginable level\" and was critical of the three lead characters, saying \"unlike ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''{{'}}s leads, these three are poisonously unpleasant, and the supposedly comedic banter between them comes off as bullying.\"<ref name=\"RevTelegraph\"/> ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}}s Robert Abele called the main trio \"numbingly predictable\" and the film itself \"unoriginal\", stating the film \"bears a cravenly piggish attitude toward rewarding socially unacceptable behavior that feels unseemly rather than exciting\".<ref name=\"RevLAT\"/>\n\n''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} Neil Genzlinger said that the funny script and skilled editing potentially made it the \"''[[Animal House]]'' of the iPhone generation\".<ref name=\"RevNYT\"/> Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the film for updating the clich\u00e9s of similarly themed films from the 1970s to the 1980s like ''Animal House'' and ''[[Risky Business]]'' \"so that they look just dangerous enough to make nostalgia feel naughty\", but stated that the film does not offer anything more outrageous than real parties, despite implying \"that it's breaking down bold new barriers of misbehavior\".<ref name=\"RevEW\"/> Gleiberman accused negative reviews of \"fulfilling the role of all those uptight parents in '50s news reports about the dangers of rock & roll\", by applying moral judgments to the events of the film.<ref name=\"RevEW2\"/> ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''{{'s}} Joshua Rothkopf gave the film four stars out of five, calling it \"brainless\", but feeling that the sheer anarchy of the film's events were \"thrilling\".<ref name=\"RevTimeOutNY\"/> Pete Travers of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised the film as \"gut-bustingly funny\" that appealed to a base youth element to become \"shitfaced and run amok\", and said that it puts its own spin on ''Animal House''. Travers gave particular mention to Mann as \"excellent\"; however, he also stated that Nourizadeh's filmmaking was a \"disaster\".<ref name=\"RevRollingStone\"/>\n\nSeveral reviewers were particularly critical towards Cooper and his character.

The party was dubbed \"Project M\" by Vasovski, and the invitation contained the address of a foreclosed home where the party would take place. By 9 a.m. on March 9, potential party-goers began arriving at the location, but by 11 a.m. the party had been officially cancelled after police began escorting people off of the premises.<ref name=\"CopyCat1\"/>  Based on his promotion job, Vasovski was offered a summer internship by [[Gawker Media]].<ref name=\"CopyCat3\"/>\n\nOn March 13, 2012, two separate parties were attempted in [[Miramar, Florida]], and [[Houston]], Texas. In Miramar, people were invited to a foreclosed home to recreate the film as \"Project X House Party 2\". The promoter was arrested and charged with $19,000 of criminal damage before the party had begun. Police claimed to have turned away 2,000 teenagers who approached the property unaware of the party's cancellation.<ref name=\"Copycat3\"/><ref name=\"Copycat4\"/> In Houston, 13 teenagers were arrested after successfully throwing a party and causing up to $100,000 of damage to an empty home. When police questioned the teens about their motivation, they claimed to have been inspired by the film.<ref name=\"Copycat5\"/> A second Houston party attracted between 500 and 1,000 guests, but resulted in the death of one person after an attendee started firing a gun when police attempted to break up the event.<ref name=\"Copycat9\"/>\n\nOn September 21, 2012, a party in the small Dutch town of [[Haren, Groningen|Haren]] spiraled out of control after a [[Facebook]] invitation. News reports indicated that \"There were multiple mentions of an American film called ''Project X''\",<ref name=\"Copycat10\"/> and that some revelers wore T-shirts marked '[[Project X Haren]]'.

There were go-go dancers, strippers, a fire thrower and two DJs reportedly hired for the party. Dozens of participants were taken to area hospitals after overdosing on drugs (particularly heroin) and alcohol including one reported sexual assault. Police from seven agencies who responded chose to manage the situation from the perimeter because of the risk of hundreds of intoxicated drivers fleeing the scene.
