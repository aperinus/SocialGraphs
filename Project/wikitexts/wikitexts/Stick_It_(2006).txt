It was produced by [[Touchstone Pictures]] and [[Spyglass Entertainment]] and was released in theatres on April 28, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nHaley Graham (Peregrym) is a rebellious 17-year-old who has a run-in with the law when she and two friends go biking through a residential construction site in [[Plano, Texas]]. Haley is arrested and forced by a judge to return to the regimented world of competitive gymnastics.\n\nHaley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the U.S. One year earlier, she made it to the [[World Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]], but she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed, making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics, if not the most hated.\n\nHaley goes to the elite Vickerman Gymnastics Academy (VGA) in [[Houston]], her ultimate nightmare, run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Bridges). Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again, at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts\u2014as well as her past\u2014causes conflicts.\n\nAt the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons why she retired to begin with: the flaws in judging. The panels do not look at the difficulty of the move nor do they look at the technique; they merely take deductions for unimportant minor errors. As Haley says, \"It doesn't matter how well you do. It's how well you follow ''their'' rules.\"\n\nIn addition, Haley is severely [[stress (medicine)|stressed]] by her domineering mother, Alice ([[Gia Carides]]), who has arrived to watch the meet. Her conduct at the World Championship (\"Worlds\") has not been forgotten by the other athletes and they treat her with open hostility. Haley finally breaks down in the middle of her balance beam routine and, in a repeat of the World Championships a year earlier, leaves the arena before completing the competition. However, before she leaves, she reveals to Vickerman the reason why she walked out of Worlds, singlehandedly costing the American team the gold medal in the process: she had just discovered that her mother was having an affair with her previous coach and her parents got divorced as a result.\n\nHaley then goes back to the judge who sentenced her to the gymnastics academy to inform her that she has dropped out and wants to be sent to either a juvenile hall or military academy, but the judge tells Haley that someone (obviously Vickerman) had just paid off all of her debt for the property damages in her incident with the law, meaning she is no longer under any legal issues and having jerks for parents doesn't need to ruin her life.\n\nHaley then approaches Vickerman, who confirms it by claiming that he used the money that her father had paid him for her gymnastics training. Vickerman persuades Haley to remain with the academy a while longer so she can continue with her training to reach Nationals. Although she did not complete the invitational, Haley continues to train and, with three of her teammates Mina Hoyt ([[Maddy Curley]]), Wei Wei Yong ([[Nikki SooHoo]]) and Joanne Charis (Lengies), qualifies for the National Championships.\n\nThe biased judging leaves her far back in the all-around standings, but this does not keep her out of the event finals. In the first event final, [[vault (gymnastics)|vault]], Mina executes an extremely difficult maneuver perfectly but receives a low score (9.5 out of 10). When Vickerman questions the judges, he learns that Mina was penalized on the technicality of showing a bra strap. Haley is next up. However, instead of vaulting, she shows her bra strap to the judges and forfeits her turn in disgust (otherwise known as a \"scratch\"). One by one, the other gymnasts follow suit, earning a string of zeroes and forcing the judges to award Mina the vault gold medal anyway.\n\nHaley's bold action sparks a movement. The gymnasts talk among themselves and realize that if they could choose the winner, the judging would be fair. They convince all the others in the competition to do the same, choosing one person from each event who they, by consensus, deem the best to be the \"winner\".\n\nThe winner completes her routine; the others jump on and off the apparatus and scratch. It seems the movement will be ruined when Tricia Skilken ([[Tarah Paige]]), a longtime judges' favorite and Haley's former teammate and best friend, arrives and threatens the choice of winners by competing herself, but Tricia ends up joining the movement and scratches in the last event as well. What started out as a gymnastics competition turns into a small revolution for the rules and Haley, whose talents are recognized once more and her future seems to be set with numerous colleges offering her [[athletic scholarship]]s to compete in [[NCAA Women's Gymnastics championship|NCAA gymnastics]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Missy Peregrym]] as Haley Graham\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Burt Vickerman\n* [[Vanessa Lengies]] as Joanne Charis\n* [[Maddy Curley]] as Mina Hoyt\n* [[Nikki SooHoo]] as Wei Wei Yong\n* [[Kellan Lutz]] as Frank\n* [[John Patrick Amedori]] as Poot\n* [[Tarah Paige]] as Tricia Skilken\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Brice Graham\n* [[Gia Carides]] as Alice Graham\n* [[John Kapelos]] as Chris DeFrank\n* [[Julie Warner]] as Phyllis Charis\n* [[Andrea Bendewald]] as Madison's Mom\n\n'''Doubles'''\n* [[Isabelle Severino]]&nbsp;\u2013 Missy Peregrym's gymnastics double (main)\n* Jessica Miyagi&nbsp;\u2013 Missy Peregrym's gymnastics double (beam routine&nbsp;\u2013 IG Classic)\n* Annie Gagnon&nbsp;\u2013 Vanessa Lengies's gymnastics double\n* Kate Stopper&nbsp;\u2013 Maddy Curley's gymnastics double\n* Tacia Van Vleet&nbsp;\u2013 Nikki SooHoo's gymnastics double\n\n'''Cameos'''\n* [[Tim Daggett]]&nbsp;\u2013 Himself\n* [[Elfi Schlegel]]&nbsp;\u2013 Herself\n* [[Bart Conner]]&nbsp;\u2013 Himself\n* [[Carly Patterson]]&nbsp;\u2013 Herself\n* [[Nastia Liukin]]&nbsp;\u2013 Herself\n* [[Valeri Liukin]]&nbsp;\u2013 Himself (Nastia Liukin's spotter in her uneven bars routine)\n* [[Mohini Bhardwaj]]\n* [[Allana Slater]]\n* [[Yang Yun (gymnast)|Yang Yun]]\n\n==Soundtrack==\n# [[We Run This]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Missy Elliott]] (Stick It Edit)\n# [[Abra Cadabra]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Talib Kweli]]\n# [[Beware of the Boys]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Panjabi MC]] (Mundian To Bach Ke)\n# [[Fire Fire]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Fannypack]]/[[Mr. Vegas]]\n# [[Dance Commander]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Electric Six]]\n# Game, The&nbsp;\u2013 [[Jurassic 5]]\n# If I Only Knew&nbsp;\u2013 [[Lisa Lavie]]\n# Breakdown&nbsp;\u2013 The Toques featuring [[Mark Foster (singer)|Mark Foster]]\n# [[Nu Nu|Nu Nu (Yeah Yeah)]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Fannypack]] (Double J & Hayze Extended mix)\n# [[Crowded (song)|Crowded]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Jeannie Ortega]]/[[Papoose]]\n# Anthem Part Two&nbsp;\u2013 [[Blink-182]]\n# Hittin' The Bars&nbsp;\u2013 [https://www.mikesimpson.com/film-tv/film-scores/stick-it.html Mike Simpson]\n# [[Come Baby Come]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[K7 (musician)|K7]]\n# Outta My Way&nbsp;\u2013 [[Damone (band)|Damone]]\n# Love Song&nbsp;\u2013 J.P.
