It is based on the 1846 novella ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], about a man driven to breakdown when he is usurped by a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]].<ref name=\"thr120201\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jesse-eisenberg-mia-wasikowska-the-double-286385 | title=Jesse Eisenberg, Mia Wasikowska Join ''The Double'' Cast | last=Kemp | first=Stuart | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] | date=1 February 2012 | access-date=23 July 2013}}</ref> It was produced by [[Alcove Entertainment]], with [[Michael Caine]], Graeme Cox (Attercop), Tessa Ross ([[Film4]]) and Nigel Williams as executive producers.\n\n==Plot==\nDowntrodden Simon James ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) has worked at his office for seven years, but he is ignored by his boss, named The Colonel, and colleagues. From his apartment he spies on a beautiful co-worker he admires, Hannah ([[Mia Wasikowska]]), who lives in the apartment opposite him. He sees her throwing away art and secretly retrieves and admires it. One night, Simon sees a man jump to his death from the floor above Hannah's apartment. He talks to detectives, who explain that if the man had jumped a few feet to the right, he would have been badly hurt but would have survived.\n\nSimon's boss ([[Wallace Shawn]]) announces the arrival of a new employee, James Simon (also played by Eisenberg), who looks identical to Simon, which causes Simon to faint upon first glance. Assertive and charming, James is Simon's polar opposite. Much to Simon's annoyance, James not only gets respect from their co-workers but no one seems to notice that they are identical in appearance. James, on the other hand, does notice this and sees Simon's pain. Out of pity, he decides to buddy-up with Simon and give him advice about how to seduce Hannah. Hannah then asks James on a date through Simon. On the date, Simon pretends to be James, with the real James giving him instructions via earpiece. When Simon becomes nervous, the two swap places and James kisses Hannah, angering Simon. James asks Simon to take an aptitude test in his place and seduces their boss's surly, rebellious daughter, Melanie ([[Yasmin Paige]]), whom Simon was instructed to tutor, something he is reluctant to do.\n\nSimon gets his revenge on James by revealing to Hannah that James is cheating on her with Melanie. Furious, James blackmails Simon for his apartment keys using explicit photos he took of himself with Melanie, knowing their boss will believe it is Simon in the photos. At work, Simon accuses James of being an imposter and is fired after going on a maniacal tirade. As he is about to kill himself, he sees Hannah lying unconscious in her apartment. He calls an ambulance and accompanies her to the hospital, where it is revealed that she not only overdosed but also miscarried (she had become pregnant after a sexual encounter with James). Simon then takes Hannah back home, relieved that she has survived. Still upset, however, Hannah states that she wanted to die and she suggests that Simon kill himself. She goes through Simon's jacket pockets and discovers earrings he had bought for her and her salvaged art.\n\nSimon learns his mother has died and finds James at her funeral. Simon punches him and discovers that they share injuries; as James's nose bleeds, so does Simon's. He finds Hannah and tells her he wants to be noticed. He goes to his apartment and handcuffs the sleeping James to his bed, then goes to the ledge above Hannah's apartment, steps to the right, and jumps. He is badly hurt. Hannah runs to him and an ambulance arrives. Lacking medical attention, the handcuffed James appears to be on the brink of death as he lies motionless on the apartment floor.\n\nInside the ambulance, The Colonel ([[James Fox]]) and Hannah watch over Simon. The Colonel tells Simon that he is \"special\", to which the latter responds with a half-smile, \"I'd like to think I'm pretty unique\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Simon James/James Simon<ref name=\"Simon\">{{cite news | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/richard-ayoade-starts-production-on-new-project-the-double-this-month | title=Richard Ayoade Starts Production On New Project ''The Double'' This Month | work=The Playlist | publisher=[[IndieWire]] | date=11 May 2012 | access-date=23 July 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as Hannah\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Papadopoulos\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Harris\n* [[Yasmin Paige]] as Melanie Papadopoulos\n* [[James Fox]] as The Colonel\n* [[Cathy Moriarty]] as Kiki\n* [[Phyllis Somerville]] as Mrs. James\n* [[Kobna Holdbrook-Smith]] as Guard / Doctor\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n* [[Tony Rohr]] as Rudolph\n* [[Susan Blommaert]] as Liz\n* [[Jon Korkes]] as Detective\n* [[Tim Key]] as Care Worker\n* [[Lloyd Woolf]] as Investigator\n* Lydia Ayoade as Test Invigilator\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Receptionist at Ball\n* [[Saul Williams]] as Security at Ball\n* [[J Mascis]] as Janitor\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n* [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Christopher Morris]] as Official\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Nurse\n* [[Craig Roberts]] as Young Detective\n* [[Kierston Wareing]] as Funeral Date\n* [[Paddy Considine]] as Jack as PT Kommander\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as Glamorous Judge\n* [[Rade Serbedzija]] as Frightening Old Man\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn February 2012 it was reported that [[Richard Ayoade]] would direct ''The Double'', starring [[Jesse Eisenberg]] and [[Mia Wasikowska]], in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"thr120201\" /><ref name=\"thr120209\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/berlin-2012-studiocanal-takes-uk-288422 | title=Berlin 2012: Studiocanal Takes U.K. Rights to Richard Ayoade's ''The Double'' | last=Kemp | first=Stuart | date=9 February 2012 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] | access-date=9 February 2012 }}</ref> Principal photography began on 20 May 2012 in [[London]].<ref name=\"Simon\" /><ref name=\"aap120521\">{{cite news | url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/8470628/wasikowska-makes-cannes-touchdown | title=Wasikowska makes Cannes touchdown | last=Drummond | first=Andrew | work=[[Australian Associated Press]] | publisher=[[ninemsn]] | date=21 May 2012 | access-date=23 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522014137/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/8470628/wasikowska-makes-cannes-touchdown | archive-date=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe [[Film score|score]] by [[Andrew Hewitt]] features a recurring progression of heavy chords played by strings.

The way he re-imagined and modernized [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s novella ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'', is a pure artistic vision. The dark tones are only enhanced by the light notes of humor throughout the film. Ayoade's avant garde, experimental style and minimalist set design sound like an odd couple, but they actually work great together.</blockquote>\n\nHe also goes on to praise Eisenberg's performance, saying:\n\n<blockquote>In his best work since ''[[The Social Network]]'', Eisenberg portrays the polarized personalities of Simon and James with such ease. The story basically rests on his shoulders as we follow him on his descent into madness. In between the fast-paced dialogue and front-lit shots there is also a very complex story that leaves the ending open to interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Estrada |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.theyoungfolks.com/review/jons-vod-pick-of-the-week-the-double/32687 |title=Jon's VOD Pick of the Week: The Double |publisher=The Young Folks |date=2014-05-12 |access-date=2014-08-07}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://magpictures.com/thedouble}}\n* {{IMDb title|1825157|The Double}}\n* {{Box Office Mojo|double2014|The Double}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|the_double_2013|The Double}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=The Double}}\n\n{{Richard Ayoade}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Double, The}}\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:2013 black comedy films]]\n[[Category:2013 independent films]]\n[[Category:2010s comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:British black comedy films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:British comedy thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Ayoade]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films about mental health]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Andrew Hewitt]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s British films]]"}]}}}}
