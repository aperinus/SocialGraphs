One day, she saves a cat from being hit by a truck on a busy road. The cat she saved turns out to be Lune, Prince of the Cat Kingdom. As a thanks, the cats give Haru gifts of [[catnip]] and mice, and she is offered the Prince's hand in marriage. Her mixed reply is taken as a yes.\n\nWanting none of this, Haru hears a kind female voice which tells her to seek out Muta, a large white cat, and to get directions to the Cat Bureau from him. Muta leads her there to meet Baron Humbert von Gikkingen (the same Baron from ''[[Whisper of the Heart]]''), who is a cat figurine given life by the work of his artist, and Toto, a stone raven who comes to life much like the Baron. Soon after meeting them, Haru and Muta are forcefully taken to the Cat Kingdom, leaving Toto and the Baron in the human world to follow the group from the air; they find the entrance to the Cat Kingdom on Earth: five lakes forming a cat's paw.\n\nHaru is treated to a feast at the castle of the Cat King. She begins to slowly turn into a cat (with tan paws, ears, nose, tail, and whiskers; (for a second, she also gets fangs), though she still remains mostly human. The King hopes that she will make a suitable bride for the Prince. At the feast, the Baron (in disguise) dances with Haru as part of the entertainment. He reveals to her that the more she loses herself in the kingdom, the more cat-like she will become, and that she has to rediscover her true self. When the Baron is discovered and is forced to fight the guards, he and Haru are helped by Yuki, a white cat maiden in the palace who had previously tried to warn Haru to leave the Cat Kingdom. After Yuki shows them an escape tunnel, Haru, the Baron, and Muta move through a maze to a tower, which contains a portal to Haru's world. The King goes through a series of efforts to keep them in the kingdom long enough for Haru to remain trapped in her cat- form; his ultimate plan is still to force her to become his daughter-in-law.\n\nPrince Lune and his guards return to the Cat Kingdom, revealing the King was not acting on his behalf and that he planned on proposing to Yuki. Muta is revealed to be Renaldo Moon, a notorious criminal in the Kingdom (having devoured a whole lake of fish in one session). Haru learns that the strange voice who had advised her to go to the Cat Bureau was Yuki's. In her childhood, Haru had saved Yuki from starvation by giving her the [[fish crackers]] she was eating, and thus, Yuki has now repaid her kindness. After she rejects the King's marriage proposal outright, Muta tells Haru, \"I respect a woman who stands up for herself,\" and proceeds to help her escape from the King's soldiers.\n\nEventually, the Baron, Haru and Muta escape the cats' realm, with the aid of Prince Lune and Toto, and Haru discovers her true self, telling the Baron how much she has come to like him. He tells her the doors of the Cat Bureau will be open for her again if the need ever arises. Haru returns to the human world with more self-confidence; after learning from her friend, Hiromi, that her former crush has broken up with his girlfriend, she simply replies \"it doesn't matter anymore.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Although the girl's life had no magical elements, the film featured short fantasy scenes depicting that the girl was writing of the Baron, a character of her novel, which were so popular that an indirect sequel was made, featuring the Baron and another girl, a high school student, named Haru. Muta also returned. ''The Cat Returns'' began as the \"Cat Project\" in 1999. Studio Ghibli received a request from a Japanese theme park<!-- Which one? --> to create a 20-minute short starring cats. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] wanted three key elements to feature in the short &mdash; these were the Baron, Muta (Moon) and a mysterious antique shop. Hiiragi was commissioned to create the manga equivalent of the short, which is called {{nihongo|Baron: The Cat Returns|\u30d0\u30ed\u30f3 \u732b\u306e\u7537\u7235|Baron: Neko no Danshaku|lit. ''Baron: The Cat Baron''}} and is published in English by [[Viz Media]]. The theme park later canceled the project. Miyazaki then took the existing work done by the \"Cat Project\" and used it as testing for future Ghibli directors &mdash; the short was now to be 45 minutes long. Responsibility was given to Hiroyuki Morita, who had started as an animator in 1999 for the film ''[[My Neighbors the Yamadas]]''. Over a nine-month period he translated Hiiragi's ''Baron'' story into 525 pages of storyboards for what was to be ''The Cat Returns''. Miyazaki and [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] decided to produce a feature-length film based entirely on Morita's storyboard; this was partly because Haru, the main character, had a \"believable feel to her\". It became the second theatrical (third overall) Studio Ghibli feature to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or [[Isao Takahata]]. [[TMS Entertainment|Telecom Animation Film]], [[Production I.G]], and [[DR Movie]] helped animate the film.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nThe film was released on July 20, 2002 as the highest-grossing domestic film at the Japanese box office in 2002<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eiren.org/toukei/img/eiren_kosyu/data_2002.pdf|script-title=ja:2002\u5e74\uff08\u5e73\u621014\u5e74\uff09\u8208\u53ce10\u5104\u5186\u4ee5\u4e0a\u756a\u7d44|access-date= January 9, 2015|work= www.eiren.org|publisher= Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan, Inc.|language= ja}}</ref> and the 7th highest-grossing film of the year overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/japan/yearly/?yr=2002&p=.htm|title=2002 Japan Yearly Box Office Results|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> As of January 5, 2015, it is the [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|86th highest-grossing film in Japan]], with [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]6.46 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kogyotsushin.com/archives/alltime/|script-title=ja:\u6b74\u4ee3\u8208\u53ce\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8100|date= January 5, 2015|access-date= January 9, 2015|work= www.kogyotsushin.com|publisher= Kogyo Tsushinsha|language= ja}}</ref> The film grossed a total of {{US$|65 million|long=no}} at the box office.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQPqZsrDi20C&pg=PA39 |title=\u6f2b\u753b\u52d5\u753b\u5ba3\u4f1d\u8cbc\u672d\u82b8\u8853 : \u65e5\u672c\u306e\u6620\u753b\u9928\u304b\u3089\u98db\u3073\u51fa\u3057\u305f\u5091\u4f5c\u3084\u4ee3\u8868\u4f5c\u306e\u6570\u3005: Japan's Movie House Masterpieces |date=2003 |publisher=DH Publishing Inc |isbn=978-0-9723124-4-8 |pages=39}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 91% of 23 critic reviews are positive for ''The Cat Returns'', and the average rating is 7.0/10.

The story in the manga is largely the same as in its film adaptation, with a few minor differences, including a comedic ending in which the cat Natoru comes into Haru's room and pesters her, as well as a mildly dark revelation involving Haru's cat friend from childhood, Yuki (that Yuki was struck and killed by a vehicle and is in a kind of cat heaven, helping Haru out of gratitude for feeding her fish crackers when she was a little girl). The visual design for Baron, as originally illustrated by Hiiragi in the manga, featured him as a dark gray cat with large blue eyes and long pointed ears, while in the Studio Ghibli version, Baron is orange-and-yellow with smaller green eyes and shorter ears, a design change carried over from the way Baron was visually portrayed in the film adaptation of ''Whisper of the Heart''. Haru's hair was visually longer and darker in Hiiragi's illustrations, although the character Muta retained his general appearance from the manga in the film adaptation. Muta is a side protagonist in both Hiiragi's manga and the film adaptation, while in ''Whisper of the Heart'', he is an antagonistic villain called \"Moon\". Hiiragi alluded to this in the manga, which was mildly referenced in the film; Muta in the film was said to have been a morbidly obese cat who ate every fish in the kingdom, as rogue outlaw \"Renaldo Moon\", a fact he uses to frighten the Cat Kingdom into leaving Haru alone so she can run away and escape. The film portrays the Cat Kingdom as a physically real dimension parallel to Haru's home city, whereas Hiiragi portrays the Cat Kingdom as a heaven for cats who have passed away.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cat Returns|last=Hiiragi|first=Aoi|publisher=Viz Media LLC|year=2002|isbn=9781591169567|edition=English Translation}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n'''Anime'''\n* {{Cite news |last=Arnold |first=Adam |url=http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/03/review/02.php |title=The Cat Returns |work=Animefringe |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=18 |date=March 2005 }}\n* {{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Tim |url=http://www.themanime.org/editorials.php?id=23 |title=Tim's Top 20 Favorite Anime of the 00's |work=[[THEM Anime Reviews|T.H.E.M.
