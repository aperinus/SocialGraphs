Please do not expand it beyond 700 words. -->\nFund manager Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father of his daughter Su-an, who wants to spend her [[birthday]] with her mother in [[Busan]]. Seok-woo sees a video of Su-an attempting to sing \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\" at her singing recital and succumbing to stage fright as a result of his absence. Overcome with guilt, he decides to grant Su-an's birthday wish. The next day, they board the [[Korea Train Express|KTX]] 101 at [[Seoul Station]], en route to Busan. Other passengers include Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, [[Chief operating officer|COO]] Yon-suk, a high school baseball team including player Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, train attendant Ki-chul, and a traumatized homeless stowaway hiding in the bathroom. As the train departs, an ill young woman runs onto the train unnoticed. She turns into a zombie and attacks a train attendant, who also turns. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the train.\n\nThe group escapes to another car and locks the doors. Internet reports and phone calls make it known that an [[epidemic]] is spreading southward across the country. After the train stops at [[Daejeon Station]], the surviving passengers find the city overrun by zombies and hastily retreat back to the train, splitting up into different train cars in the ensuing chaos. Seok-woo learns by phone that his company is indirectly involved in the disaster. The military establishes a quarantine zone near Busan, to which the engineer sets a course. Seok-woo, Sang-hwa and Yong-guk - who have become separated from their loved ones - fight their way to where Su-an and Seong-kyeong are hiding with In-gil and the homeless man. Once regrouped, they struggle through the zombie horde to the front train car - where the rest of the passengers are sheltered. At the prompting of Yon-suk and Ki-chul, the passengers prevent the survivors from entering, fearing that they are infected. Sang-hwa sacrifices himself to give the others time to force open the door and enter the car, but In-gil is killed. Yon-suk and the passengers demand that the survivors isolate themselves in the front vestibule. However, Jong-gil \u2013 disgusted at the passengers and despairing for the loss of her sister \u2013 deliberately opens the other door and allows the zombies to enter and kill the rest of the car's passengers. Yon-suk and Ki-chul escape by hiding in the bathroom.\n\nA blocked track at the [[Dongdaegu station|East Daegu train station]] forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. Yon-suk escapes after pushing Ki-chul into the zombies, then later does the same with Jin-hee when they run into each other on the tracks. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee until she turns and kills him. The train conductor starts a locomotive on another track, but is also thrown to the zombies while trying to save an injured Yon-suk. A flaming locomotive derails and traps the remaining survivors, but Seok-woo finds a way out. The rest of the group is trapped again by falling debris. The homeless man sacrifices himself to buy time for Seok-woo to clear the debris and Su-an and Seong-kyeong to escape onto the new locomotive. After fighting off zombies hanging onto the locomotive, they encounter Yon-suk, who is on the verge of turning into a zombie and is begging for help, having been bitten when the conductor saved him. Seok-woo manages to throw him off, but is bitten. He puts Su-an and Seong-kyeong inside the engine room, teaches Seong-kyeong how to operate the train, and says goodbye to his daughter before throwing himself off the locomotive. Due to another train blockage, Su-an and Seong-kyeong are forced to stop the train at a tunnel just prior to Busan. The two exit the train and continue following the tracks on foot through the tunnel. [[Sniper]]s are stationed on the other side of the tunnel and are prepared to shoot at what they believe to be zombies, but they lower their weapons and rush towards them to help them when they hear Su-an singing \"[[Aloha \u02bbOe]]\".\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Gong Yoo]] as Seok-woo, a fund manager whose wife left him because of his selfishness.\n* [[Jung Yu-mi (actress born 1983)|Jung Yu-mi]] as Seong-kyeong, Sang-hwa's pregnant wife\n* [[Ma Dong-seok]] as Yoon Sang-hwa, husband of Seong-kyeong\n* [[Kim Su-an]] as Su-an, daughter of Seok-woo who wants to see her mom in [[Busan]] for her [[birthday]].\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Min Yong-guk, a high school baseball player\n* [[Ahn So-hee]] as Kim Jin-hee, Yong-guk's girlfriend\n* [[Kim Eui-sung]] as Yon-suk, a business executive\n* [[Choi Gwi-hwa]] as a homeless man\n* [[Jang Hyuk-jin]] as Ki-chul, a train attendant\n* Park Myung-sin as Jong-gil, In-gil's younger sister\n* [[Ye Soo-jung]] as In-gil, the older sister of Jong-gil\n* Jeong Seok-yong as the captain of the [[KTX]]\n* Han Seong-soo as the [[KTX]] train Team Leader\n* Kim Chang-hwan as Deputy Kim Jin-mo\n* [[Shim Eun-kyung]] as a runaway girl\n* Lee Joo-shil as Seok-woo's mother and Su-an's grandmother\n\n==Production==\nThe film team tried to reference the movements of the zombies in the game ''[[7 Days to Die]]'' and the movements of the dolls from ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', and also reviewed the movements from the nurses in ''[[Silent Hill]]''.<ref name=\"cine21\"/> The film was filmed in various stations from Daejeon, Cheonan and East Daegu.<ref name=\"cine21\"/> The water deer in the movie was created using real videos of water deer and 3D modelling.<ref name=\"cine21\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cine21.com/news/view/?mag_id=84792|title=[\uc2a4\ud398\uc15c] <\ubd80\uc0b0\ud589> \uc2a4\ud0ed\ub4e4\uc774 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud55c \uc601\ud654 \ucd2c\uc601\ud604\uc7a5|website=Cine 21|date=27 July 2016}}</ref> The scenery that is seen outside the train in the film was shot with an LED plate rear screen technique behind the set and by focusing on the characters.<ref name=\"cine21\"/> The blood vessels of the zombies were drawn with an airbrush.
