His publisher, Arthur Planck ([[Bob Balaban]]), assigns penniless, lovelorn illustrator Lucy Reilly ([[Mandy Moore]]) to work with Henry. She's being wooed by her ex-boyfriend Jeremy ([[Martin Freeman]]), who dumped her two years ago but shows up [[apologetic]], having dedicated his new book to her. Lucy and Henry go to their publisher's beach house to work on the book. Will love bloom amid the rocks, or is Henry a bump on Lucy's road to Jeremy? Rudy's voice, from the grave, gives Henry counsel.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Rudy Holt\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Henry Roth\n* [[Christine Taylor]] as Allison\n* [[Bob Balaban]] as Arthur Planck\n* [[Catherine Lloyd Burns]] as Mother in Bookstore\n* [[Amy Sedaris]] as Cassidy's Mom\n* Cassidy Hinkle as Cassidy\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Lucy Reilly\n* [[Jeremy Shamos]] as Matthew\n* [[Christopher Fitzgerald (actor)|Christopher Fitzgerald]] as Robin\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Carol\n* [[Jicky Schnee]] as Mandy the Waitress\n* John Ellison Conlee as Man at Lucy's Apartment\n* [[Martin Freeman]] as Jeremy\n* Christopher Grey Misa as Abused Kid\n* [[Catherine Kellner]] as Abusive Mom\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Don Meyers\n* [[Peter Bogdanovich]] as Roger Spade\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Lawyer on phone\n\n==Production==\nFilmed in the New York City, [[Wantagh, New York|Wantagh]], and [[Glen Cove, New York|Glen Cove]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://glencoverecordpilot.com/glen-cove-in-pop-culture/|title=Glen Cove In Pop Culture|first=Jill|last=Nossa|date=July 27, 2017|work=[[List of newspapers in New York (state)#Weekly and other newspapers|Glen Cove Record Pilot]]|publisher=[[Anton Media Group]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200815171302/https://glencoverecordpilot.com/glen-cove-in-pop-culture/|access-date=January 20, 2021|archive-date=2020-08-15}}</ref> Gay pornographic actor [[Erik Rhodes (pornographic actor)|Erik Rhodes]] filmed a cameo role for the film but his scenes were ultimately edited out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.friskyfans.org/profiles/erik_rhodes.htm|title=Porn Stars: Erik Rhodes|work=Frisky Fans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318164039/http://www.friskyfans.org/profiles/erik_rhodes.htm|access-date=January 20, 2021|archive-date=2018-03-18}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened on August 24, 2007 in two theaters, earning an average of $5,958 per theater.\n\nIt added two additional theaters the following week, but in its third week (September 7), it left one of the initial screens.
