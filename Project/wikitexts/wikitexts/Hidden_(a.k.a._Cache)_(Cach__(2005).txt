The plot follows an upper-middle-class French couple, Georges (Auteuil) and Anne (Binoche), who are terrorised by anonymous tapes that appear on their front porch and seem to show the family is under surveillance. Clues in the videos point to Georges's childhood memories, and his resistance to his parents' adopting an Algerian orphan named Majid, who was sent away. The tapes lead him to the now-grown Majid ([[Maurice B\u00e9nichou]]).\n\nShot in Paris and Vienna in 2004, the film is an [[Co-production (media)|international co-production]] of [[Cinema of France|France]], [[Cinema of Austria|Austria]], [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]] and [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]]. Haneke wrote the screenplay with Auteuil and Binoche in mind, and with a concept of exploring guilt and childhood. When he learned of the French government's decades-long denial of the [[Paris massacre of 1961|1961 Seine River massacre]], he incorporated memories of the event into his story.\n\n''Cach\u00e9'' opened at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] to critical acclaim for the performances and Haneke's direction. Its plot ambiguities raised considerable discussion. The film has been interpreted as an allegory about [[collective responsibility|collective guilt]] and [[collective memory]], and as a statement on France's [[Algerian War]] and [[colonialism]] in general. While presented as a mystery, the film does not explicitly reveal which character sends the tapes. Haneke regarded that as of secondary importance to the exploration of guilt and left the question up to viewer interpretation.\n\nThe film won three awards at Cannes, including [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]]; five [[European Film Awards]], including [[European Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]]; and [[List of accolades received by Cach\u00e9|other honours]]. It was controversially disqualified for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. ''Cach\u00e9'' has been regarded in the years since its release as one of the greatest films of the 2000s, included in [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]].\n\n==Plot==\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n!

Puzzled about its origin, they debate its purpose, considering whether it might be a practical joke played by friends of their 12-year-old son, Pierrot, or the work of fans of Georges, who hosts a literary television show. A second tape arrives, accompanied by a childlike drawing of a person with blood streaming out of his mouth. Similar drawings are mailed to Georges's workplace and Pierrot's school. Disturbed, the Laurents turn to the French police, who determine the tapes are too harmless to be considered criminal activity. The Laurents host a dinner party that is interrupted by the delivery of another videotape, with a crude drawing of a chicken bleeding at its neck. When Anne discloses the stalking to their friends, Georges puts the tape in the [[VCR]], and finds it shows the estate where he grew up.\n\nGeorges begins to have vivid dreams about Majid, a boy he knew in childhood. Majid's [[Algerians in France|Algerian]] parents worked as farmhands on Georges's family estate but disappeared in the [[Paris massacre of 1961]]. Feeling responsible for Majid, Georges's parents intended to adopt him, but the process was never finalised. Suspecting Majid might be responsible for the tapes, Georges visits his ailing mother, who surprisingly professes not to remember Majid well. When the Laurents receive another tape, revealing a low-income housing ([[HLM]]) apartment, Georges tells Anne he has a suspect in mind, but will not say who until he can confirm his suspicion. Anne responds with shock at what she sees as his lack of trust.\n\nFollowing the last tape's clues, Georges locates the apartment off Avenue L\u00e9nine in [[Romainville]] and finds Majid there. Majid denies knowledge of the tapes or drawing, but Georges does not believe him and threatens him. A hidden camera recorded the conversation with Majid, who breaks down crying after Georges leaves, and tapes of the encounter are sent to Anne and Georges's employer. Georges explains to Anne that he was six when his parents were planning to adopt Majid and that he did not want it to happen; he told lies about Majid, who was sent away. When Pierrot disappears, the Laurents frantically contact the police, who check Majid's apartment and arrest Majid and Majid's son, though they deny involvement in kidnapping. Pierrot returns to his family, having spent time with friends, and hints to Anne that he thinks she is too close to Pierre, a family friend.\n\nMajid calls Georges and asks him to come back to the apartment. When Georges arrives, Majid denies having sent the tapes, says he wanted Georges present, and kills himself by slashing his throat. Georges confesses to Anne that as a boy, he had claimed Majid was coughing up blood and convinced Majid to kill the family's rooster, falsely claiming his father wanted him to. The police confirm the cause of death as suicide, but Majid's son appears at Georges's workplace to confront him. Believing the son is responsible for the tapes, Georges threatens him to cease surveillance, but the son replies he was not involved with the tapes and wanted to know how Georges felt about being responsible for a death. Later, Majid's son converses with Pierrot after school.\n\n==Production==\n===Historical background===\n{{see also|Paris massacre of 1961}}\n[[File:\u0646\u0635\u0628 \u062a\u0630\u0643\u0631\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0641\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u0627 \u0636\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0627\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0633.JPG|thumb|A commemorative plaque to the massacre at [[Pont Saint-Michel]].]]\nA basis for the story was the massacre that took place in Paris on 17 October 1961, referenced by the character Georges:{{sfn|Crowley|2010|p=267}}\n{{blockquote|In October '61, the FLN called all Algerians to a demonstration in Paris.

Celik.{{sfn|Celik|2010|p=60}} Scholar Susannah Radstone argues that while critics focused on the film as a statement on the Algerian War in particular, the story is generally about \"the trauma of violence perpetuated upon the colonized and the guilt that now ought rightfully to be acknowledged by the colonial power\".{{sfn|Radstone|2013|pp=18\u201319}} The French people refusing to accept the full truth of a moment of shame, the Paris massacre, underlines the scene where Georges tells Anne about Majid, according to academic Elsie Walker, with the pauses punctuating Georges's monologue belying the shame. After stating the date, Georges adds \"Enough said\", indicating the event was better-known by 2005, but also seemingly affirming silence about it; Walker points out that Georges ironically follows this with details.{{sfn|Walker|2017|pp=125\u2013151}} Professor Russell J.A. Kilbourn writes that Georges had suppressed his memories and his sense of guilt and that for Haneke, trauma is lived in the present through memory.{{sfn|Kilbourn|2013|pp=193\u2013194}} Georges's dream, in which he sees young Majid kill the rooster, and then menace him with the ax, \"presents a spectacle of real death in the place of any simulation or reconstruction of the events of October 1961\", author Michael Lawrence writes.{{sfn|Lawrence|2010|p=74}}\n\nPresent-day conflicts such as the [[Iraq War]] and the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] are depicted through a [[Euronews]] broadcast seen in the film.
