A remake of the 1997 Norwegian [[Insomnia (1997 film)|film of the same name]], it stars [[Al Pacino]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Hilary Swank]] with [[Maura Tierney]], [[Martin Donovan]], [[Nicky Katt]], and [[Paul Dooley]] in supporting roles. The film follows two [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles homicide detectives]] investigating a murder in [[Nightmute, Alaska]]. It is the only film by Nolan that he did not write or co-write.\n\nReleased on May 24, 2002, ''Insomnia'' grossed more than $113 million worldwide against a production budget of $46 million, and received critical praise, including for Pacino's and Williams' performances.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the small fishing town of [[Nightmute, Alaska]], 17-year-old Kay Connell is found murdered. [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are sent to assist the local police with their investigation. They do so at the request of police chief Nyback, an old colleague of Dormer. Ellie Burr, a young, local detective who is also a fan of Dormer's investigative work, picks them up when they arrive.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] is investigating one of Dormer's past cases. While in the restaurant of their hotel, Eckhart reveals that he is going to testify against Dormer in exchange for immunity. Dormer responds by noting that many criminals whom he helped to convict using [[False evidence|questionable evidence]] could go free if their cases are reopened.\n\nDormer cleverly attracts the murderer to the scene of the crime, but the suspect flees into the fog, shooting one of the police officers through the leg. Dormer spots a figure in the fog and fires with his backup weapon when his primary jams. Rushing to the fallen figure, Dormer picks up a .38 pistol the suspect has dropped. He then discovers that he has shot Eckhart. Eckhart recognizes him, and dies believing Dormer shot him on purpose.\n\nBecause of Eckhart's pending testimony, Dormer knows that Internal Affairs will never believe the shooting was an accident, so he claims that Eckhart was shot by the suspect. He does not mention that he has the .38 pistol. Burr is put in charge of the shooting investigation, and her team finds the [[.38 Special|.38 caliber]] bullet that hit the officer. That night, Dormer walks to an alley and fires the .38 pistol into an animal carcass, then retrieves and cleans the bullet. At the morgue, the pathologist hands him the bagged bullet retrieved from Eckhart's body, but she is unfamiliar with its type. Dormer leaves and switches the .38 bullet for the 9&nbsp;mm slug from Eckhart's body.\n\nOver the next few days, Dormer is plagued by insomnia, brought on by his guilt over killing Eckhart and exacerbated by the [[Midnight sun|perpetual daylight]]. Dormer starts receiving anonymous phone calls from the killer, who claims to have witnessed Dormer kill his partner. When the police learn that Kay was a fan of local crime writer Walter Finch, Dormer breaks into Finch's apartment in the nearby village of [[Umkumiut]]. Finch arrives at home, realizes the police are present, and evades Dormer after a chase. Dormer returns to Finch's apartment and plants the .38 to frame Finch.\n\nFinch contacts Dormer and arranges a meeting on a ferry. Finch wants help in shifting suspicion to Kay's abusive boyfriend Randy Stetz and in return will stay silent about the Eckhart shooting. Dormer gives advice on handling police questioning. After Finch leaves Dormer on the ferry, he shows the detective a tape recorder he used to record the conversation.\n\nFinch calls Dormer and tells him that Kay's death was \"an accident\"; he beat her to death in a fit of rage after she laughed at his sexual advances. The next day, Finch gives false testimony at the police station. When Finch claims Randy has a gun, Dormer realizes Finch has discovered his plant and has hidden it at Randy's home. Randy is arrested when the gun is found at his house. Finch asks Burr to come to his lake house the next day to collect letters indicating that Randy abused Kay.\n\nBurr returns to the scene of Eckhart's death and finds a [[9 mm caliber|9&nbsp;mm]] shell casing, which conflicts with the bullet type from Eckhart's body. She reads her own case study from an investigation Dormer was involved in and learns he has carried a 9&nbsp;mm, leading her to suspect that he shot Eckhart. Meanwhile, on his last night staying in the hotel, Dormer confides in the hotel owner, Rachel Clement, about the Internal Affairs investigation: He fabricated evidence to help convict a pedophile he was certain was guilty of murdering a child and who would have walked if Eckhart had testified.\n\nDormer learns that Burr has gone to Finch's. He finds Kay's letters in Finch's apartment and realizes that Finch intends to kill Burr. He learns of Finch's lake house and rushes there. At the house, Finch knocks Burr unconscious just as Dormer arrives, and takes Burr's gun. Dormer is too disoriented from lack of sleep to fight off Finch. Burr revives and saves Dormer, while Finch escapes. Burr reveals she knows Dormer shot Eckhart, and he admits that he is no longer certain if it was an accident. From his shed, Finch shoots at them with a shotgun, and Burr returns fire with Dormer's gun while Dormer sneaks around to Finch's location. After a scuffle in which Dormer grabs Finch's shotgun, Finch shoots Dormer with Burr's gun, and Dormer shoots and kills Finch with the shotgun.\n\nBurr rushes to the fatally wounded Dormer and comforts him by affirming that Eckhart's shooting was accidental, then moves to throw away the 9&nbsp;mm shell casing to preserve Dormer's reputation. Dormer stops her, however, urging her not to lose her integrity as he had. Dormer says his last words \"just let me sleep\" and dies just as Burr puts the bullet back in the evidence bag.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Detective Will Dormer\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Walter Finch \n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Detective Ellie Burr\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Rachel Clement\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Detective Hap Eckhart\n* [[Nicky Katt]] as Detective Fred Duggar \n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Chief Charlie Nyback\n* [[Crystal Lowe]] as Kay Connell\n* [[Jay Brazeau]] as Officer Francis\n* [[Larry Holden]] as Officer Farrell Brooks\n* Kerry Sandomirsky as Trish Eckhart\n* [[Lorne Cardinal]] as Officer Rich\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Tanya Francke\n* [[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]] as Randy Stetz\n* [[Paula Shaw]] as The Coroner\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n[[Jonathan Demme]] was originally attached to direct the film and considered [[Harrison Ford]] for the role of Will Dormer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/08/is-harrison-ford-up-for-a-case-of-insomnia|title = Is Harrison Ford up for a Case of Insomnia?|date = September 8, 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n''Insomnia'' has Robin Williams playing a villain, deviating from the comedic roles for which  he was earlier known.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-robin-williams-dies-memorable-movie-roles-20140811-story.html|title=Robin Williams: Seven of his most memorable movie roles|first=Oliver|last=Gettell|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 12, 2014|access-date=May 21, 2019|archive-date=August 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810110843/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-robin-williams-dies-memorable-movie-roles-20140811-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Regarding his decision to cast Williams, Nolan said: \"I think [audiences] will come away feeling like they have seen a 'new' Robin Williams.
