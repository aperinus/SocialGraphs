Nick loses his temper with Hechtor ([[Larry Pine]]), the detective in charge, and gets suspended. Nick's partner Ed ([[Seymour Cassel]]) pretends to be Nick's dad to enroll him as a student. Matt gives Nick pointers to get people to talk to him. Nick deals with bullies, girls with crushes on him, teachers and staff who range from quirky to bizarre, and a teacher, Robin Torrence ([[Suzy Amis]]), to whom he is attracted who thinks he is a teen. The turning point in his popularity (and therefore his ability to get information) happens in the classroom metaphor scene, in which [[E.E. Cummings]]' poem ''she being brand new'', is used in its entirety.\n\nAlong the way, Nick and Ed narrow the probable motives down to jealousy (Bradwood was trading grades for sex with Dawn-Marie Zeffer ([[Alexandra Powers]]), the girlfriend of Kyle Kerns ([[Peter Dobson]]), the leader of the bullies) or self-preservation (Bradwood was blackmailing some staff about running a real estate scam on the other teachers). Nick's identity is discovered by Jane Melway ([[Diane Ladd]]), one of the con artist's gang, and it all comes to a head at the Pagan May Fest (the school's mascots are the Pagans). Nick and Ed find out that they are probably on the wrong track - Chet Butler ([[George Wendt]]), one of the gang's members is missing and an emotional confession from Melway points to Butler as the murderer - not to stop the blackmail, but because Bradwood was engaged to Melway, with whom Butler used to have an affair and whom he still loves. Bradwood also found the love letters in which Butler claims to have killed Melway's husband.\n\nButler appears and implicates himself with words and actions. A chase ensues, ending with Nick being cornered finding the evidence that cements Butler's guilt. Nick is saved twice in quick succession, once by a schoolmate's opportune distraction, and once by an excellent shot of Ed's at the perfect time. Nick makes a date with Robin Torrence, who now knows he is an adult, and the real-estate scammers are arrested. Hector looks very foolish. Matt is released from jail and can't wait to get back to school.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Nick Dunbar\n* [[Suzy Amis]] as Robin Torrence\n* [[George Wendt]] as Chet Butler\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Jane Melway\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Ed Malmburg\n* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Mr. Wiseman\n* [[Robert Stack]] as Mr. Gardner\n* [[Larry Pine]] as Dave Hechtor\n* [[Alexandra Powers]] as Dawn-Marie Zeffer\n* [[Peter Dobson]] as Kyle Kerns\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Simon Feck\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Matt Dunbar\n* [[Reginald VelJohnson]] as Captain Graff\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Carter\n* [[Phoebe Augustine]] as Girl at Fair\n\n== Reception ==\n''Plain Clothes'' was not widely distributed or reviewed, with critics responding negatively to the film. In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, \"''Plain Clothes'' tries to combine a police investigation story with the usual classroom and locker-room stuff. Less would not necessarily have been more, but it would have been shorter.\"<ref name=\"maslin\">{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |title=An Undercover Return to High School |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages=18 |date=April 16, 1988 }}</ref> In his review for the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', Juan Carlos Coto wrote, \"Potentially hilarious moments seem to straggle by like students playing hooky, and the whodunit plot gets dumber and more contrived at every turn.\"<ref name=\"coto\">{{cite news |last=Coto |first=Juan Carlos |title=''Plain Clothes'' Needs Dressing Up |work=[[Miami Herald]] |pages=3 |date=April 16, 1988 }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0095875|title=Plain Clothes}}\n* {{Amg movie|38283|Plain Clothes}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=plain_clothes|title=Plain Clothes}}\n* {{Mojo title|plainclothes}}\n\n{{Martha Coolidge}}\n{{Scott Frank}}\n\n[[Category:1988 films]]\n[[Category:1988 comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Paramount Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Scott Frank]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Martha Coolidge]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
