Starring [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Emily Watson]], and [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], the film centers on the life of a [[boxing|boxer]] and former [[Provisional IRA]] volunteer Danny Flynn, played by Day-Lewis, who is trying to \"go straight\" after his release from prison. The film is the third collaboration between Sheridan and Day-Lewis, and portrays the increase of splinter groups within the IRA.<ref name=\"mov\">{{cite magazine | title = Wettbewerb/In Competition |magazine=[[Moving Pictures (magazine)|Moving Pictures]], Berlinale Extra |page=12 | location = Berlin | date = 11\u201322 February 1998 }}</ref> In preparation for the role, Daniel Day-Lewis trained as a boxer in Ireland for a year.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer Irish [[Boxing|pugilist]] and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] member Danny Flynn ([[Daniel Day-Lewis]]) returns home to [[Belfast]] from a 14-year stint in prison at the age of 32. Weary of the unbroken cycle of violence in Northern Ireland, he attempts to settle down and live in peace. After meeting his drink-sodden old trainer Ike ([[Ken Stott]]), Danny starts up a [[Nonsectarian|non-sectarian]] boxing club for boys in an old gymnasium.\n\nWhile fixing up the old building, however, he runs across a cache of [[Semtex]] hidden underneath the stage. He throws the cache into the river.\n\nDanny's action infuriates Harry ([[Gerard McSorley]]), a bitter and ruthless IRA lieutenant. Danny reconnects with an old flame, Maggie ([[Emily Watson]]), now married to an imprisoned IRA man and required by IRA code to remain faithful to him. Their relationship dominates much of the film.\n\nHarry sees Danny and Maggie's relationship as a way to undermine the authority of her father, Joe Hamill ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]), the grim but war-weary local IRA commander who is working for peace. Harry feuds with Danny, assassinating the kindly police officer who donates equipment to the boxing club. The murder causes a riot at one of Danny's boxing matches. During the riot, the gymnasium is burnt down by Liam, the young son of Maggie, who thinks Danny and his mother are going to elope.\n\nEventually, Harry and some other IRA men kidnap Danny and take him away to be executed. Then, in a last-minute twist, the IRA gunman shoots Harry instead of Danny, thus eliminating a rogue agent. With her son Liam in the car, Maggie picks up Danny and they all drive home together.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Danny Flynn\n*[[Emily Watson]] as Maggie\n*[[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Joe Hamill\n*[[Ken Stott]] as Ike Weir\n*[[Gerard McSorley]] as Harry\n*[[Ian McElhinney]] as Reggie Bell\n*[[Ciar\u00e1n Fitzgerald]] as Liam\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film opened in 3 theaters in the United States on 31 December 1997.
