It stars [[Billy Crystal]] as Harry and [[Meg Ryan]] as Sally. The story follows the title characters from the time they meet in Chicago just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years of chance encounters in New York City. The film addresses but fails to resolve questions along the lines of \"Can men and women ever just be friends?\"\n\nIdeas for the film began when Rob Reiner divorced from Penny Marshall. An interview Ephron conducted with Reiner provided the basis for Harry. Sally was based on Ephron and some of her friends. Crystal came on board and made his own contributions to the screenplay, making Harry funnier.  Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. The soundtrack consists of standards from [[Harry Connick Jr.]], with a [[big band]] and [[orchestra]] arranged by [[Marc Shaiman]]. For his work on the soundtrack, Connick won his first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male|Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance]].\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released ''When Harry Met Sally...'' in selected cities, letting [[Word-of-mouth marketing|word of mouth generate interest]], before gradually expanding distribution. The film grossed $92.8 million in North America, and was released to critical acclaim. Ephron received a [[43rd British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Award]], an [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay#1980s|Oscar nomination]], and a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nomination for her screenplay. The film is ranked 23rd on [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs]] list of the top comedy films in American cinema and number 60 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] \"100 Funniest Movies\". In early 2004, the film was adapted for the stage in a production starring [[Luke Perry]] and [[Alyson Hannigan]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1977, Harry Burns and Sally Albright graduate from the [[University of Chicago]] and share the drive to New York City, where she is beginning journalism school and he is starting a career. Harry has been dating Sally's friend Amanda Reese.\n\nDuring the drive, Harry and Sally discuss their differing ideas about relationships; she disagrees with his assertion that men and women cannot be friends as \"the sex part gets in the way\". At a diner, Harry tells Sally she is very attractive, and she angrily accuses him of making a pass at her. They part in New York on unfriendly terms.\n\nFive years later in 1982, Harry and Sally find themselves on the same flight. It turns out Sally is dating Harry's neighbor Joe, and Harry is engaged to a woman named Helen, which surprises her, as it seems uncharacteristically optimistic of him. Harry suggests they become friends, forcing him to qualify his previous position about the impossibility of male-female friendships. They separate, concluding that they will not be friends.\n\nFive years later in 1987, Harry and Sally run into each other again in a bookstore. They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships; Sally and Joe broke up because she wanted a family and he did not want to marry, and Helen left Harry for another man. They take a walk and agree to pursue a friendship. They have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend time together discussing their love-lives.\n\nDuring a New Year's Eve party, Harry and Sally find themselves attracted to each other, even sharing a quick kiss as a New Year's formality. Even though they remain friends, they set each other up with their respective best friends, Marie and Jess. When the four go to a restaurant, Marie and Jess quickly fall for each other and later become engaged.\n\nOne night while talking on the phone, Sally tearfully tells Harry that her ex is getting married. He goes to her apartment to comfort her and in Sally's vulnerable state, they begin kissing and have sex. Harry leaves the next morning, feeling awkward and filled with regret. Their friendship cools until they have a heated argument at Jess and Marie's wedding dinner in which Sally angrily slaps Harry. He attempts to mend their friendship, but Sally feels that they cannot be friends.\n\nAt a 1988 New Year's Eve party, Sally feels lonely without Harry. He starts to spend New Year's alone, watching [[Dick Clark]]'s 16th annual New Year's Rockin' Eve. Before midnight, he walks around the city. As Sally decides to leave the party before midnight, Harry appears and declares his love for her. She argues that the only reason he is there is that he is lonely, but he lists the many things he loves about her. They then have a New Year's midnight kiss. Harry and Sally marry three months later, exactly 12 years and three months after their first meeting.\n\nThe film contains several interspersed segments of older couples discussing how they met. The true stories, gathered by Nora Ephron, are narrated by actors. The final couple interviewed, before the closing credits, is Harry and Sally.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Harry Burns\n* [[Meg Ryan]] as Sally Albright\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as Marie \n* [[Bruno Kirby]] as Jess \n* [[Steven Ford]] as Joe\n* [[Lisa Jane Persky]] as Alice\n* [[Michelle Nicastro]] as Amanda Reese\n* [[Kevin Rooney (comedian)|Kevin Rooney]] as Ira Stone\n* [[Harley Jane Kozak|Harley Kozak]] as Helen Hillson\n* [[Estelle Reiner]] as Female Customer\n\n==Production==\nIn 1984, director Rob Reiner, producer Andy Scheinman and writer [[Nora Ephron]] met over lunch at the [[Russian Tea Room]] in [[New York City]] to develop a project.<ref name=\"keyser\">{{cite news | title=It's Love at the box office for ''Harry Met Sally...'' | work=[[Washington Times]] | date=July 25, 1989 | last=Keyser | first=Lucy}}</ref> Reiner pitched an idea for a film that Ephron rejected.<ref name=\"dvd1\">{{cite news | title=It All Started Like This | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] | work=When Harry Met Sally...
