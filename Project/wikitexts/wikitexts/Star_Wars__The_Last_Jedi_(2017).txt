Produced by [[Lucasfilm]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is the second installment of the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy]], following ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), and the eighth episode of the nine-part \"[[Skywalker saga]]\". The film's [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Mark Hamill]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Adam Driver]], [[Daisy Ridley]], [[John Boyega]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Domhnall Gleeson]], [[Anthony Daniels]], [[Gwendoline Christie]], [[Kelly Marie Tran]], [[Laura Dern]], and [[Benicio del Toro]].<!-- Order based on the billing. --> ''The Last Jedi'' follows [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] as she seeks the aid of [[Luke Skywalker]], in hopes of turning the tide for the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] in the fight against [[Kylo Ren]] and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]], while [[Princess Leia|General Leia Organa]], [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], and [[Poe Dameron]] attempt to escape a First Order attack on the dwindling Resistance fleet. The film features the first posthumous film performance by Fisher, who died in December 2016, and the film is dedicated to her.<ref name=\"CarrieFisherDedication\" />\n\n''The Last Jedi'' is part of a new trilogy of films announced after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. It was produced by Lucasfilm president [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Ram Bergman]] and executive produced by ''The Force Awakens'' director [[J.&nbsp;J. Abrams]]. [[John Williams]], composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi (soundtrack)|the score]]. A number of scenes<!-- This was not second-unit, the director and at least two of the main cast were involved --> were filmed at [[Skellig Michael]] in Ireland during pre-production in September 2015, but [[principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England in February 2016 and wrapped that July.\n\n''The Last Jedi'' premiered in Los Angeles on December 9, 2017, and was released in the United States on December 15.

Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\nShortly after the battle of [[Starkiller Base]],{{efn|As depicted in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015)}} General [[Leia Organa]] is leading the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] forces in evacuating their base when the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] fleet arrives. Against Leia's orders, [[Poe Dameron]] leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. [[Kylo Ren]] hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia's presence on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is dragged into [[Outer space|space]] but survives by using [[the Force]]. While Leia recovers, [[Vice-Admiral Holdo]] assumes command of the Resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order.\n\nOn [[Ahch-To]], [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] attempts to recruit [[Luke Skywalker]] to the Resistance. Under self-imposed exile, Luke refuses to help and says that the [[Jedi]] should end. After encouragement from [[R2-D2]], he agrees to give Rey three lessons in the ways of the Force. Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, which puzzles them both. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power. Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that [[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]] was corrupting him, which prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library but hesitates. The [[Force ghost|spirit]] of Luke's master [[Yoda]] appears and destroys the library by summoning a bolt of [[lightning]]. He encourages Luke to learn from his failure.\n\nMeanwhile, Poe entrusts [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], mechanic [[Rose Tico|Rose]], and [[BB-8]] with a secret mission to disable the First Order's tracking device. [[Maz Kanata]] directs them to the casino town of [[Canto Bight]], where they meet the hacker [[DJ (Star Wars)|DJ]]. Pursued by the local security, they escape Canto Bight with the help of stablehand children and [[riding animal|racing animal]]s they set free. Finn, Rose, and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship but are captured by [[Captain Phasma]]. Rey also infiltrates the flagship and is captured by Kylo, who brings her before Snoke. Snoke reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts.\n\nHoldo plans to evacuate the remaining members of the Resistance using small transport vessels. Believing her plan cowardly and futile, Poe leads a mutiny. A recovered Leia stuns Poe with a [[blaster (Star Wars)|blaster]] and proceeds with the evacuation. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on [[Crait]]. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to [[General Hux]], and the First Order fleet begins firing on the evacuation transports, destroying many.\n\nOrdered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the dark side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she battles him for control of Luke's lightsaber, bisecting the weapon. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose; they defeat Phasma and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and [[Chewbacca]] draw [[TIE fighter]]s away in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon.\n\nLuke appears and confronts the First Order, allowing the surviving Resistance to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, but they fail to harm him. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes that Luke is not physically present, but [[Astral projection|projecting]] his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the ''Falcon''. Exhausted, Luke dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again.\n\nAt Canto Bight, the stablehands recount the story of Luke Skywalker; afterward, one of them moves a broom with the Force and gazes into space.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Order based on the credits billing-->\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n*[[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]], a powerful [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] who has been in self-imposed exile on the planet [[Ahch-To]].<ref name=\"Hamill\" /><ref name=\"TFACastReturn\" />\n** Hamill voices Dobbu Scay, named after the film's editor, [[Bob Ducsay]].

J. Abrams]] was named director of the first episode in the trilogy, ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', in January 2013.<ref name=\"EpisodeVIINamedDirector\" /> In June 2014, director Rian Johnson was reported to be in talks to write and direct its sequel, ''Episode VIII'', and to write a [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the third film, ''Episode IX'', with Ram Bergman producing both films.<ref name=\"JohnsonTalks1\" /><ref name=\"JohnsonTalks2\" /> Johnson confirmed in August that he would direct ''Episode VIII''.<ref name=\"THRJohnson\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that ''Episode VIII'' would be released in 2017.<ref name=\"EpisodeVIII-IXReleaseDatesConfirmed\" /> In December, Lucasfilm president [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] said that the film had not been mapped out and that Abrams was collaborating with Johnson, who would in turn work with (then) ''Episode IX'' director [[Colin Trevorrow]] to ensure a smooth transition.<ref name=\"Variety7Dec2015\" /> Additionally, Abrams served as an executive producer along with Tom Karnowski and Jason McGatlin.<ref name=\"BFI\" /> In January 2017, Lucasfilm announced the title for ''Episode VIII'' as ''Star Wars: The Last Jedi''.<ref name=\"Title\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe ''Last Jedi'' story begins immediately after ''The Force Awakens''.<ref name=\"StarWarsCelebrationUK\"

Samurai]]'' (1964), ''[[Sahara (1943 American film)|Sahara]]'' (1943), and ''[[Letter Never Sent (film)|Letter Never Sent]]'' (1960) for inspiration while developing ideas.<ref name=\"StarWarsCelebrationUK\" /><ref name=\"ClassicWarFilm\" /> He felt it was difficult to work on the film while ''The Force Awakens'' was being finished.<ref name=\"StarWarsCelebrationUK\" />\n\nJohnson wrote the scene with the mirrored versions of Rey to symbolise her search for identity; when she asks for a vision of her parents, she sees only herself.<ref name=\"SpoilerReyParents\" /> Rey learns that her parents were \"nobodies\" as it would be \"the hardest thing\" she and the audience could hear; Johnson likened the scene to Luke Skywalker learning that [[Darth Vader]] is his father in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980).<ref name=\"SpoilerReyParents\" /> During production, Hamill expressed disagreement with the direction of his character, Luke, feeling his character's disillusioned state was at odds with his character.<ref name=\"AVClubRegret\" /> Hamill later said he regretted making his initial misgivings public and compared his disagreements to his clashes with George Lucas during the filming of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983).<ref name=\"AVClubRegret\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2015, Disney shortlisted the female cast members to [[Gina

Ultimately, 125 sets were created on 14 [[sound stage]]s at Pinewood Studios.<ref name=\"THRSetAmounts\" />\n\nAccording to creature designer [[Neal Scanlan]], ''The Last Jedi'' has more practical effects than any ''Star Wars'' film, with 180 to 200 creatures created with practical effects, some cut from the final edit.<ref name=\"PracticalCreatures\" /> For Yoda's appearance in the film as a [[The Force#Depiction|Force ghost]], the character was created using puppetry, as was done in the original [[Star Wars original trilogy|''Star Wars'' trilogy]] (as opposed to [[computer-generated imagery]], which was used to create Yoda in most of the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]]).<ref name=\"YodaProduction\" /> [[Rian Johnson]] explained the decision was because he felt a
