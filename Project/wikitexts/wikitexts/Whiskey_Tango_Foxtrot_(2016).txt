It is based on the memoir ''[[The Taliban Shuffle|The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan]]'' by [[Kim Barker]]. The film stars [[Tina Fey]], [[Margot Robbie]], [[Martin Freeman]], [[Christopher Abbott]], [[Alfred Molina]], and [[Billy Bob Thornton]]. It was released on March 4, 2016, by [[Paramount Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics who praised the acting, but criticized the predictable screenplay and execution. The movie grossed $24.9 million against its $35 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2003 New York City, Kim Baker ([[Tina Fey]]) is a television journalist who is dissatisfied with the state of her career covering low-profile stories. She decides to take a short assignment as a [[war correspondent]] in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], to the disappointment of her boyfriend Chris ([[Josh Charles]]), who spends a lot of time traveling. Assigned to low-budget living quarters with other international journalists, she develops a friendship with noted BBC correspondent Tanya Vanderpoel ([[Margot Robbie]]) and lecherous Scottish freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie ([[Martin Freeman]]). After a period of adjustment, aided by her Afghan \"[[fixer (journalism)|fixer]]\" Fahim Ahmadzai ([[Christopher Abbott]]), she begins taking well to the assignment. She elicits frank remarks on camera from soldiers questioning the value of their assignment there and puts herself in harm's way to capture combat incidents on video. American Marine commander General (previously Colonel) Hollanek ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]) sees her as an inexperienced nuisance.\n\nDespite the danger, Kim stays in Afghanistan for months, then years, beyond her original assignment. She catches Chris unprepared with a middle-of-the-night video call and finds him with another woman, ending their relationship. Against her better judgment, she begins a sexual relationship with Iain, which over time also develops into a more personal one. Although her status as a woman presents challenges in an Afghan Islamic society which places restrictive roles on women, she also uses it to her advantage. Kim gains access to women in a village who explain that they have been sabotaging the US-built [[Water well|well]] because they welcome the daily walk to the river away from the men. She also walks a tightrope, taking advantage of the thinly-veiled sexual interest of Afghan Attorney General Ali Massoud Sadiq ([[Alfred Molina]]) to use him as a source. Fahim \u2013 who treated [[opium]] addicts before the war \u2013 cautions her, pointing out that danger can be like a drug.\n\nDespite their mutual friendliness, Kim remains in competition with other journalists for stories and resources from their employers back home. After three years in Afghanistan, Kim flies to New York to argue for more support from her network's new boss, only to discover that Tanya is slated to take over from her. Meanwhile, Iain is kidnapped for ransom while traveling cross-country to cover a developing story that he had earlier offered to bring Kim in on. She returns \"home\" to Afghanistan, where she blackmails her \"special friend,\" Ali, for information about Iain's whereabouts, and impresses upon Hollanek the political value to him of rescuing Iain. The mission \u2013 accompanied by Kim's cameraman \u2013 is a success, both militarily and journalistically. However, shortly after Iain's rescue Kim becomes disillusioned with both her tentative relationship and her station. She then bids farewell to her colleagues and Fahim and returns to the U.S. to stay.\n\nAfter returning, she looks up a Marine ([[Evan Jonigkeit]]) who was transferred, apparently because of his on-camera comments to her, and subsequently lost both of his legs to an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]. She tries to apologize for the consequences of her actions, but he refuses to let her take the blame. She moves on to an on-camera desk job, where she finds herself interviewing Iain, who is going to be in New York soon as part of a tour for his new book, and who invites her to meet him for coffee.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tina Fey]] as Kim Baker,<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" /> a cable news reporter.\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as Tanya Vanderpoel,<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" /> a British [[BBC News]] TV journalist whom Kim admires and befriends.\n* [[Martin Freeman]] as Iain MacKelpie,<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" /> Kim's unexpected love interest and a dedicated Scottish photojournalist.\n* [[Christopher Abbott]] as Fahim Ahmadzai,<ref name=\"AbbottCast\" /> who acts as driver, translator, and all-around handyman for reporters.\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] later [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] Hollanek, [[US Marine Corps]], a military man who initially scares Kim.<ref name=\"FourCast\" />\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Ali Massoud Sadiq,<ref name=\"FourCast\" /> a local official who has a romantic interest in her.\n* [[Sheila Vand]] as Shakira El-Khoury,<ref name=\"DeadlineCast\" /> a Lebanese reporter who works alongside Kim and Tanya.\n* [[Nicholas Braun]] as Tall Brian,<ref name=\"BraunCast\" /> Kim's cameraman.\n* [[Steve Peacocke]]<ref name=\"PeacockeCast\" /> as Nic, Kim's alpha male bodyguard.\n* [[Evan Jonigkeit]]<ref name=\"FourCast\" /> as Lance Corporal Coughlin, a member of [[3rd Battalion, 5th Marines]] when Baker is embedded.\n* [[Scott Takeda]]<ref>Linda Ge, [https://www.thewrap.com/scott-takeda-joins-tina-fey-and-margot-robbie-in-paramounts-middle-east-comedy-exclusive/ \"Scott Takeda Joins Tina Fey and Margot Robbie in Paramount's Middle East Comedy,\"] TheWrap, February 13, 2015.</ref> as Ed Faber.\n* [[Josh Charles]]<ref name=\"Sneider\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/tina-feys-untitled-movie-based-on-taliban-shuffle-lands-release-date/|title=Tina Fey's Untitled Movie Based on 'Taliban Shuffle' Lands Release Date|publisher=[[TheWrap]]|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|date=November 9, 2015|access-date=November 10, 2015}}</ref> as Chris, Kim's boyfriend back in the States.\n* [[Cherry Jones]] as Geri Taub.\n* [[Sterling K.
