A. Pennebaker]] that documents the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]] of 1967. Among Pennebaker's several camera operators were fellow documentarians [[Richard Leacock]] and [[Albert and David Maysles|Albert Maysles]]. The painter [[Brice Marden]] has an \"assistant camera\" credit, and [[Bob Neuwirth]], who figured prominently in Pennebaker's [[Bob Dylan]] documentary ''[[Dont Look Back]]'', acted as stage manager. Titles for the film were by the illustrator [[Tomi Ungerer]]. Featured performers include [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] with [[Janis Joplin]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Hugh Masekela]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[the Mamas & the Papas]], [[The Who]] and [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], whose [[Jimi Hendrix|namesake]] set his guitar on fire, broke it on the stage, then threw the neck of his guitar in the crowd at the end of \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\".\n\nIn 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-144/library-of-congress-national-film-registry-turns-30/2018-12-12/|title=Library of Congress National Film Registry Turns 30|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\n==Performers and songs==\nSongs featured in the film, in order of appearance:\n#[[Scott McKenzie]]{{snd}}\"[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]\"*\n#[[The Mamas & the Papas]]{{snd}}\"[[Creeque Alley]]\"{{big|'''*'''}} and \"[[California Dreamin']]\"\n#[[Canned Heat]]{{snd}}\"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\"\n#[[Simon & Garfunkel]]{{snd}}\"[[The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)]]\"\n#[[Hugh Masekela]]{{snd}}\"[[Grazing in the Grass|Bajabula Bonke (The Healing Song)]]\"\n#[[Jefferson Airplane]]{{snd}}\"[[High Flying Bird (song)#Recordings and popular versions|High Flying Bird]]\" and \"[[Today (Jefferson Airplane song)|Today]]\"\n#[[Big Brother and the Holding Company]]{{snd}}\"[[Ball and Chain (Big Mama Thornton song)|Ball and Chain]]\"\n#[[Eric Burdon & The Animals]]{{snd}}\"[[Paint It Black]]\"\n#[[The Who]]{{snd}}\"[[My Generation]]\"\n#[[Country Joe and the Fish]]{{snd}}\"Section 43\"\n#[[Otis Redding]] (backed by [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]){{snd}}\"[[Shake (Sam Cooke song)|Shake]]\" and \"[[I've Been Loving You Too Long]]\"<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/booker-t-talks-emotional-return-to-monterey-pop-festival-50-years-later-202719/ Silvers, Emma. \"Booker T.

Additionally, many artists who appeared at the festival were not included in the original cut of the film.\n\n==Production==\nThe American Broadcasting Company put up a $200,000 advance to get a film made about the Monterey Pop Festival for its new [[ABC Movie of the Week]] series. However, ''Monterey Pop'' never aired on ABC, a decision made by [[Thomas W. Moore]], the head of ABC at the time and, according to Lou Adler, \"a very conservative Southern gentleman.\" \"We showed him Jimi Hendrix fornicating with his amp and we said 'What do you think?' \" Adler recalls. \"And he said 'Keep the money and get out.'

Unveiled in 1968, Pennebaker's vision of the 1967 event was instrumental in convincing potential organizers and participants that music was the healthiest way to crystallize the energy of a [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] that by then seemed both blessedly inevitable and dangerously embattled.\"<ref>{{cite news | author-link= Robert Christgau | last = Christgau | first= Robert (| date= January 14, 1997 | url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/wight-96.php | title = Found Weekend | work = [[The Village Voice]] | access-date= March 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[French New Wave]] director [[Jean-Luc Godard]] was so taken with Jefferson Airplane's performance in ''Monterey Pop'' that later in 1968 he set out to make a never-finished film titled ''[[One A.M. (unfinished film)|One A.M.]]'' (for \"One American Movie\") in collaboration with Pennebaker and Leacock. Godard shot a sequence of the Airplane, (included on the 2004 ''Fly Jefferson Airplane'' DVD), playing at high noon on a business day on the roof of a New York hotel across the street from the Leacock-Pennebaker offices, with the tower of [[Rockefeller Center]] in the background. Attracted by the extremely high volume of the music, the police arrived and put an end to the shooting.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brophy |first1=Richard |title=In Memoriam: Richard Leacock |journal=New Yorker |date=11 March 2011 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/in-memoriam-richard-leacock |access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe screening of ''Monterey Pop'' in theaters helped raise the festival to mythic status, rapidly swelled the ranks of would-be festival-goers looking for the next festival, and inspired new entrepreneurs to stage more and more of them around the country.<ref>Mankin, Bill (March 4, 2012).

Rosenman had watched ''Monterey Pop'' the day before meeting with Lang and Kornfeld and, impressed by the film, agreed, with Roberts to bankroll Lang and Kornfeld in an effort that morphed into the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0064689}}\n* {{YouTube|xNrygTqx0FA|Monterey Pop Official Trailer}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/231-monterey-pop-the-first-rock-festival ''Monterey Pop: The First Rock Festival''] an essay by [[Michael Lydon]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* [http://www.bcx.news/photos/events/concerts/montereypop/ Monterey Pop (35mm and Russian slit-scan photos) on bcx.news]\n\n{{D.
