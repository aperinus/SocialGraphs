The film is an Italian\u2013American<ref name=lum/> venture produced by [[The Ladd Company]], [[Regency Enterprises|Embassy International Pictures]], [[Producers Sales Organization|PSO Enterprises]], and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] Based on [[Harry Grey]]'s novel ''The Hoods'', it chronicles the lives of best friends [[David \"Noodles\" Aaronson]] and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of [[Jewish]] [[ghetto]] youths who rise to prominence as [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish gangsters]] in [[New York City]]'s world of [[organized crime]]. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, together with the rise of [[mobster]]s in American society.\n\nIt was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third film of Leone's ''Once Upon a Time Trilogy'', which includes ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968) and ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/fistful-dynamite-duck-you-sucker-sergio-leone |title=The Film with Three Names \u2013 in Praise of Sergio Leone's Neglected Spaghetti Western |website=British Film Institute |date=24 April 2018 |access-date=2 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602154820/https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/fistful-dynamite-duck-you-sucker-sergio-leone|archive-date=2 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The cinematography was by [[Tonino Delli Colli]], and the film score by [[Ennio Morricone]]. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes (2 hours and 19 minutes), and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement.\n\nThe shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes that were made. The original \"European cut\" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]], especially in the gangster genre.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--DO NOT add any additional detail-->\n<!--- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], 4 hour movie with [[Nonlinear narrative]] gets some leeway to extend beyond 700 word max for plot \"summary\" --->\n\nIn 1933, three thugs search for a man named \"Noodles\", torturing people for information. They enter a [[wayang]] theater, where the proprietors slip into a hidden [[opium den]] within the building and warn Noodles. He is apathetic, drugged and grasping a newspaper featuring the demise of [[Rum-running|bootleggers]] Patrick Goldberg, Philip Stein and Maximilian Bercovicz. He recalls observing police removing their corpses, Max's burned beyond recognition. Noodles evades capture and leaves the city alone and penniless.\n\nIn 1918, [[David \"Noodles\" Aaronson]] and his friends \"Patsy\" Goldberg, \"Cockeye\" Stein and Dominic struggle as street kids in Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]], committing petty crimes for local boss Bugsy. Max foils one of their robberies but has the booty stolen from him by a corrupt police officer, Whitey. Later, they blackmail the officer, catching him having sex with Peggy, a prostitute, and the five youngsters start a gang with the same level of police protection as Bugsy. Max and Noodles become best friends.\n\nThe group rises through the ranks after implementing Noodles' idea to hide bootleg liquor. They stash half their earnings in a railway station locker, giving the key to \"Fat Moe\", a friend not directly involved in their activities. Noodles is in love with Moe's sister, Deborah, who dreams of becoming a dancer and actress. Bugsy, now a rival, eventually ambushes the boys and shoots Dominic, who dies in Noodles' arms. In a fit of rage, Noodles kills Bugsy and injures a police officer, and is sentenced to prison.\n\nNoodles is released in 1930 and rejoins his friends, now prosperous bootleggers during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. His first job with them is a diamond heist using a jewelry employee and occasional prostitute named Carol as their informant. During the robbery, Carol goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later goes on to become Max's [[Moll (slang)|moll]]. That the job had been commissioned by a [[National Crime Syndicate|Syndicate]] figure to eliminate the competition sits badly with Noodles who, unlike Max, dislikes hierarchy and lacks political ambition. The gang provides protection for [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters' union]] boss Jimmy O'Donnell, but Noodles later rejects Max's plan to deepen those ties.\n\nSeeking to form a genuine intimacy with Deborah, Noodles takes her on a lavish date, where she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood. On their drive back, Noodles rapes her in the limousine. He is later met with Deborah's aloofness when he watches her board the train to California.\n\nThe gang's success ends with the 1933 repeal of Prohibition. Max suggests a [[New York Federal Reserve Bank]] heist, which Noodles and Carol deem a suicide mission. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max's ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max knocks him out during a seemingly impromptu argument. This leads to the events shown in the prologue: upon regaining consciousness and learning that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by the police, a guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the opium den. He saves Moe but finds out that his new girlfriend Eve has been murdered and the railway locker money has disappeared. With his gang killed and himself hunted by Syndicate thugs, Noodles settles in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] under an alias.\n\nIn 1968, Noodles is belatedly informed that the Beth Israel Cemetery is being redeveloped, and asked to rebury any loved ones. Upon inquiry, the [[rabbi]] who had sent the letter informs him that the bodies of his three dead friends have since been relocated to [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]]. Realizing that someone has deduced his identity, Noodles returns to [[Manhattan]] and stays with Moe. Inside the Riverdale mausoleum, Noodles finds a key to the railway locker. The caption on the [[commemorative plaque]] falsely states that the mausoleum was erected by Noodles himself.\n\nThe locker reveals a suitcase full of money, and a note stating this is a downpayment on his next job. Noodles watches news of an assassination attempt on controversial [[United States Secretary of Commerce|U.S. Secretary of Commerce]] Christopher Bailey. The report shows Jimmy O'Donnell, still a Teamsters boss, distancing himself from the Bailey corruption scandal. Noodles finds Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and [[Suicide by cop|opened fire first]], wishing to die young rather than in an insane asylum like his father.\n\nAfter spotting her in the retirement home's dedication photo, Noodles tracks down Deborah, still an actress.{{efn|Though every other character are shown to be elderly during 1968, Deborah is depicted as uncannily younger. \"Age cannot wither her{{nbsp}}... ({{Folger inline|Ant|2|2|276\u2013277|bare=true}}) It's like the play was written for you\", Noodles tells her after reading the theater poster of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', which Deborah had just acted in.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Tony |last=Sokol |date=September 7, 2021 |title=''Once Upon a Time in America'' Is Every Bit as Great a Gangster Movie as ''The Godfather''|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/once-upon-a-time-in-america-every-bit-as-great-the-godfather/amp |magazine=[[Den of Geek]] |access-date=October 2, 2021 |archive-date=3 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003010731/https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/once-upon-a-time-in-america-every-bit-as-great-the-godfather/?amp |url-status=live }}</ref>}} He tells her about his invitation to a party at Bailey's mansion. Deborah admits to being Bailey's lover and begs Noodles to leave before he is confronted with hurtful revelations. Ignoring Deborah's advice, Noodles sees Bailey's son just outside, who evidently looks like a younger Max.\n\nAt the party, Noodles meets Bailey, who reveals he is actually Max and that he faked his death with the help of the police and Syndicate, stole the gang's money and reinvented himself as a self-made, Teamsters-connected politician. He confirms that he made Deborah his mistress years earlier. Faced with ruin and the specter of a Teamster assassination, Max reveals the job he has for Noodles is to kill him. Noodles, obstinately referring to him by his Bailey identity, refuses, explaining that in his eyes, Max died with the gang. As Noodles leaves the estate, a garbage truck starts up and a man resembling Max walks from the entrance toward Noodles until the truck passes between them. Noodles sees the truck's [[auger conveyor]] grinding down rubbish, but Max is nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe epilogue returns to 1933 with Noodles entering the opium den after his friends' deaths, taking the drug and broadly grinning.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast per tombstone opening credits and order, roles per closing credits scroll, add \"young\" versions and oft-seen \"Peggy\" --->\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[David \"Noodles\" Aaronson|Noodles]]\n** [[Scott Schutzman|Scott Tiler]] as Young Noodles\n* [[James Woods]] as Max\n** [[Rusty Jacobs]] as Young Max/David Bailey\n* [[Elizabeth McGovern]] as Deborah\n** [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Young Deborah\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Frankie Monaldi\n* [[Burt Young]] as Joe\n* [[Tuesday Weld]] as Carol\n* [[Treat Williams]] as Jimmy O'Donnell\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Police Chief Aiello\n* [[Richard Bright (actor)|Richard Bright]] as Chicken Joe\n* [[James Hayden]] as Patsy\n** [[Brian Bloom]] as Young Patsy\n* [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]] as Cockeye\n** Adrian Curran as Young Cockeye\n* [[Darlanne Fluegel]] as Eve\n* [[Larry Rapp]] as Fat Moe\n** Mike Monetti as Young Fat Moe\n* [[Richard Foronjy]] as Whitey\n* [[Robert Harper (actor)|Robert Harper]] as Sharkey\n* Dutch Miller as Van Linden\n* Gerard Murphy<!--- not the Irish-born actor from \"Waterworld\" ---> as Crowning\n* Amy Ryder as Peggy\n** [[Julie Cohen]] as Young Peggy\n* [[Estelle Harris]] as Peggy's mother\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe cast also includes Noah Moazezi as Dominic, [[James Russo]] as Bugsy, producer [[Arnon Milchan]] as Noodles' chauffeur, [[Marcia Jean Kurtz]] as Max's mother, [[Joey Faye]] as an \"Adorable Old Man\", and [[Olga Karlatos]] as a wayang patron.

In an interview by No\u00ebl Simsolo published in 1987, Leone confirms the validity of this interpretation, saying that the scenes set in the 1960s could be seen as an opium dream of Noodles'.{{sfn|Simsolo|1987|page=}} In the DVD commentary for the film, [[film historian]] and critic [[Richard Schickel]] states that opium users often report vivid dreams, and that these visions have a tendency to explore the user's past and future.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Once Upon a Time in America |first=Richard |last=Schickel |author-link=Richard Schickel |medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nThe ending in which Max appears as Noodles is leaving Bailey's mansion and then suddenly disappears behind a truck only for Noodles to see the blades of the truck spinning, was reportedly left ambiguous on purpose. James Woods, who played Max, stated that he does not know if Max jumped in the truck or just disappeared. Critic Carlo Affatigato described this twist as a \"[[paradox]],\" postulating that the whole film is about how Noodles spends the second half of his life seeking out the truth of what happened, only to discover it, not accept it, and not investigate what happens to Max in the end. Noodles only wants to believe the reality he has created for himself, not an objective one. Affatigato also believes this could point to it all being the imagination of Noodles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Affatigato|first=Carlo|url=https://auralcrave.com/en/2018/08/16/the-mysterious-ending-of-once-upon-a-time-in-america/|title=The mysterious ending of ''Once Upon a Time in America''|work=Auralcrave|date=2018|access-date=October 1, 2021|archive-date=31 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831172239/https://auralcrave.com/en/2018/08/16/the-mysterious-ending-of-once-upon-a-time-in-america/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMany people (including Schickel) assume that the 1968 [[Frisbee]] scene, which has an immediate cut and gives no further resolution, was part of a longer sequence.<ref>{{cite video |title=Once Upon a Time in America|type=DVD audio commentary}}</ref> Ebert stated that the purpose of the flying disc scene was to establish the 1960s time frame and nothing more.<ref name=\"Ebert84\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of films cut over the director's opposition]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Eberwein |first2=Rebecca |last2=Bell-Metereau |title=Acting for America: Movie Stars of the 1980s |year=2010 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4760-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3mDAWRO4fkgC }}\n* {{cite book |last=Frayling|first=Christopher|author-link=Christopher Frayling|title=Sergio Leone: Something to Do with Death |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0816646838 |location=Minneapolis }}\n* {{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Howard |year=2006 |title=Crime Wave: The Filmgoers' Guide to the Great Crime Movies |location=New York City |publisher=I.
