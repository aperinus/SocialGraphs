The [[sequel]] to 2009's ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'', the film was directed by [[Cody Cameron]] and [[Kris Pearn]] with [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]] returning as executive producers. [[Bill Hader]], [[Anna Faris]], [[James Caan]], [[Andy Samberg]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], and [[Benjamin Bratt]] reprise their roles from the first film, while [[Will Forte]], who voiced Joseph Towne in the first film, voices Chester V in this film.

This article is at 685, add nothing without making sure of wordcount/necessity of addition first, please. Thanks!-->\nAfter scientist Flint Lockwood saved his island Chewandswallow from his invention, the \"Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator\" (aka the FLDSMDFR), Chester V, the CEO of \"Live Corp\" and Flint's childhood idol, offers his company's services to help clean the food off the island. He hires Flint, but during his short tenure at Live Corp, Flint enters a competition for a promotion, only to publicly humiliate himself by accident via an invention of his called a \"Party in a Box\", which prematurely goes off when he does not win.\n\nLater on, Chester informs Flint that the FLDSMDFR is still functioning and creating sentient food creatures known as foodimals, one of which attacked his employees stationed on Swallow Falls. Chester tells Flint that he needs to travel alone to the island, find the FLDSMDFR, and insert a [[USB flash drive]]-like device known as the \"BS-USB\" to shut it down. However, Flint takes his pet monkey Steve, his meteorologist girlfriend Sam Sparks, her cameraman Manny, police officer Earl Devereaux, and former mascot of Chewandswallow \u201cChicken\u201d Brent McHale. Flint also grudgingly accepts the help of Tim, his widowed father, who takes them to the island using his fishing boat. When Chester learns that Flint is not alone, he and his much-abused orangutan assistant Barb gather some of their employees and follow.\n\nWhile Tim stays on the boat and makes friends with some living pickles, Flint and his friends work their way through the jungle-like environment of food that now completely covers the island. They encounter many foodimals, including a living [[strawberry]] Sam names \"Barry\". A Cheespider, the foodimal that attacked Chester's employees, chases Flint and the gang, but Chester arrives, scaring it off and joining the mission. Sam becomes suspicious of Chester's motives, as his claims about the foodimals being dangerous do not align with what they have observed. Flint is too afraid of failure to listen, eventually leading Sam, Earl, Manny and Brent to strike out on their own. They re-encounter and befriend the Cheespider, discovering that it was only acting hostile toward people wearing Live Corp gear. When the group deduces that the foodimals have realized something sinister about the company, as the \"live\" part of its name is an [[anagram]] of \"evil\", they are then captured by Chester's employees when they attempt to go back and warn Flint.\n\nFlint, Chester, and Barb track down the FLDSMDFR, but after meeting and befriending some living marshmallows it created, Flint defies Chester and refuses to use the BS-USB. However, Chester inadvertently inserts the device into the machine himself, revealing it to be a hacking device designed to reprogram it. With the FLDSMDFR now under his control, Chester disposes of Flint and starts capturing foodimals, intent on using them as the key ingredients for Live Corp's upcoming line of food bars, as he discovered that the FLDSMDFR's food tastes better than average food. The marshmallows rescue Flint and reunite him with Tim. The duo realize that, without the FLDSMDFR, the existing foodimals will die out. As Flint offers his condolences, he is surprised to discover that the foodimals, having watched archive footage of him creating the FLDSMDFR, revere him as their creator. Inspired, Flint vows to save the island.\n\nTim and the foodimals catapult Flint and Barry into the unfinished Live Corp base. Some captive foodimals are freed by Barry, and they help fight off the company's employees. Flint confronts Chester, who threatens to turn his friends into food bars as well. When Barb begins to show reluctance, Chester dismisses her and battles Flint alone. Flint uses his \"Party in a Box\" invention to defeat him and save his friends. Chester attempts to escape with the FLDSMDFR, and is pursued by the foodimals and Flint's group. Barb turns on Chester for his abuse and steals the machine back, while Chester is eaten by the Cheespider. Flint returns the FLDSMDFR to where it was found, frees it from Chester's control, and reconciles with his friends. The residents of Swallow Falls return to their proper homes, adapting to the altered ecosystem and happily continuing their lives. The FLDSMDFR continues creating foodimals, which live and co-exist peacefully alongside the islanders.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{multiple image\n|footer = Bill Hader, Anna Faris and Terry Crews at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] promoting ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2''.\n|footer_align = center\n|image1=Bill Hader, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width1=70\n|image2=Anna Faris, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width2=70\n|image3=Terry Crews, 2013 San Diego Comic Con-cropped.jpg\n|width3=70\n|header_align=center\n}}\n[[File:Anna Faris, Benjamin Bratt on Dulce Osuna.jpg|right|thumb|Anna Faris, Benjamin Bratt interviewed about ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2'' in 2013]]\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Flint Lockwood: an [[inventor]] and Sam's boyfriend.<ref name=PRNewswireCast /> \n** Hader also voices the FLDSMDFR, as he did in the first film.\n*** [[Bridget Hoffman]] as the young Flint.
