His best friend is Luke, a drug dealer living with his drug-addicted father. The two boys find themselves entranced by Michelle, a beautiful and charismatic teen who has just moved from London to live with her father, Dave.\n\nLuke and Malachy attempt to win Michelle's affections by outdoing each other on a wild ride of sex, drugs, vandalism, shoplifting, and fighting. However, all three teens find that they are in over their heads when they throw a party in the Titanic Leisureplex, which turns disastrous when Dave walks in to find his place trashed. Blaming Malachy, he almost beats him to death. Malachy is saved by Luke, who smacks Dave over the head with a pole. Stunned, Dave slowly turns to look at Luke, and receives a second blow to the head. While Malachy is covered in blood and bruises, he gets up and tells Luke that he does not want to leave, since Michelle is grieving for her dead father. Luke, being a \"supportive\" friend, stays with Malachy until the paramedics and police show up and take them in for questioning.\n\nThe ending of the film turns out to be the opening sequence to the film. Although we only see bits and pieces of the ending interrogation, the audience gets to hear of Malachy's and Luke's final words on the incident before the film cuts out.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flixster.com/movie/cherrybomb-2009# |title=Flixster |access-date=2010-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105084802/http://www.flixster.com/movie/cherrybomb-2009/# |archive-date=2016-01-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as Malachy McKinney\n* [[Robert Sheehan]] as Luke\n* [[Kimberley Nixon]] as Michelle\n* [[James Nesbitt]] as Dave, Michelle's father\n* Niamh Quinn as Donna\n* [[Paul Kennedy]] as Chris\n* [[Conor MacNeill]] as Fanta\n* Greer Ellison as Bun\n* Kat Kirk as Sharon\n* [[Kathy Kiera Clarke]] as Emma\n* [[Lalor Roddy]] as Smiley\n* Paul Garrett as Bob\n* Paul Caddell as Swimming Instructor\n* [[Richard Orr]] as Uncle Joe\n* Bronach Lawlor as Jessica\n* Maggie Hayes as Aunt Maggie\n\n==Reception==\n{{As of|2020|06}}, the film holds a 42% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on twelve reviews with an average rating of 4.67/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cherrybomb|title=Cherrybomb (2009)|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2020|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.cherrybombmovie.net/}}\n* {{IMDb title|1248971|Cherrybomb}}\n{{Barros D'Sa and Leyburn}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cherrybomb}}\n[[Category:2000s coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:2009 independent films]]\n[[Category:2000s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:British coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:British teen drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language Irish films]]\n[[Category:Films about drugs]]\n[[Category:Films set in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Northern Ireland]]\n[[Category:Irish coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:Irish independent films]]\n[[Category:Irish teen drama films]]\n[[Category:Northern Irish films]]\n[[Category:2009 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:2009 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Holmes (musician)]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
