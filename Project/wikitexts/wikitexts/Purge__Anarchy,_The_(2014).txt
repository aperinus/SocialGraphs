A [[sequel]] to 2013's ''[[The Purge (2013 film)|The Purge]]'' and the second installment in the [[The Purge|''Purge'' franchise]], the film stars [[Frank Grillo]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Zach Gilford]], [[Kiele Sanchez]], and [[Michael K. Williams]]. [[Edwin Hodge]] reprised his role from the first film. It was released worldwide on July 18, 2014.\n\nThe film grossed over $111&nbsp;million and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised it as an improvement over its predecessor, but criticized its clich\u00e9d formula and screenplay. While the first film was set largely in one house, ''Anarchy'' takes place around the [[Greater Los Angeles]] area and shows more of what happens to the surroundings during the event. A third film in the series, ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'', was released on July 1, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=November 2022}}\nIn a dystopian United States ruled by a totalitarian government known as the New Founding Fathers, the annual Purge, a 12-hour event that legalizes all crimes without authorities intervening, is credited as having saved the country's collapsing economy. While everyone across the United States prepares for the carnage, the nation's impoverished population is no longer seen as people, but as living garbage, whom the wealthy denounce as only living to serve their needs. However, before the sixth annual Purge begins on March 21, 2023, a successful anti-Purge [[Resistance movement|resistance group]] led by Carmelo Johns and his partner, the Stranger from the [[The Purge|first film]], hijack government feeds to denounce the New Founding Fathers and their actions.\n\nIn [[Los Angeles]], working-class [[waitress]] Eva Sanchez returns home to her 17-year-old daughter Cali and terminally ill father Rico, who also despise the New Founding Fathers. As Eva and Cali prepare to barricade themselves into their apartment, Rico retires to his room to be alone as the Purge starts. As the Purge alarm sounds, Rico slips out to a waiting [[limousine]], leaving a note for his family revealing that he has sold himself as a Purge offering to a rich family in exchange for $100,000 to be paid to Eva and Cali after the Purge. Eva and Cali are distraught by this situation.\n\nEstranged married couple Shane and Liz visit a grocery store, only to be harassed by a masked gang of bikers. As they drive away to avoid them, their car breaks down; the biker gang had cut their fuel line. Meanwhile, an off-duty [[Los Angeles Police Department]] sergeant, Leo Barnes, plots to kill Warren Grass. Grass had inadvertently run down and killed Barnes's son, Nicholas, while [[Driving under the influence|driving drunk]] the day before the previous year's Purge; Grass was acquitted of the crime on a legal technicality due to Nicholas having died of his injuries on Purge night. Despite pleas from his ex-wife Janice to abandon his plans, Barnes drives out into the streets with an armored car and several weapons, posing as a [[vigilante]].\n\nAs Shane and Liz try to find a safe hiding place, the Purge commences. Eva and Cali notice NFFoA paramilitary amassing in the street below, and they hear a bang, and Eva asks are they in the apartment and chided by Cali that they havent entered the building, it turns out to be intruding [[incel]] [[Building superintendent|superintendent]] Diego, who's enraged by Eva for not considering him and now intends to [[Sexual assault|assault]] her. Diego is gunned down by a paramilitary platoon, which captures the women to offer them to their leader, Big Daddy, for his own personal purge. Leo passes by the scene and rescues Eva and Cali after killing the troops and wounding Big Daddy. They find Shane and Liz hiding in Leo's car. The group flees just as Big Daddy fires at them, damaging the vehicle. After Leo's car breaks down, the group flees on foot, and Eva promises Leo a new car from her co-worker, Tanya, in exchange for Leo\u2019s protection.\n\nAs the group navigates the hostile streets, they find evidence that the anti-Purge group has been gaining the upper hand against the Purgers, discovering a paramilitary van surrounded by soldiers who were shot to death by the resistance fighters. After freeing Shane from a trap and taking guns from the abandoned truck, they head to the subways. Chaos ensues when a [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnic]] Purging gang invades the subways and sets the tunnel ablaze. Shane is wounded, but the group manages to escape after he and Liz destroy the gang's [[all-terrain vehicle]] and its [[propane]] tank with the salvaged [[submachine gun]]s, killing the entire gang.\n\nThe group returns to the streets, but as they near Tanya's apartment building, Eva unknowingly signals a [[traffic camera]] to identify them to the paramilitary troops who pick up the apartment's location. They reach Tanya's house, where Eva confesses she lied to Leo about the car, as her co-worker does not have one. Tanya's family takes them in, offering dinner and medicine. However, Tanya's sister Lorraine proceeds to [[Sororicide|murder her sister]] for sleeping with her husband. The group leaves the family to their fate, only to be captured by the masked gang who ambushed Shane and Liz earlier. This gang reveals that they had no intention to kill the group and are selling them off to an auction, taking them to a theater where upper-class Purgers bid on them for [[human hunting]]. After the group is forced into the arena, Leo subdues and kills a Purger, taking his weapon and [[night vision device|night-vision glasses]], using the devices to overpower and kill several other attackers, and providing their arms to Shane and the others before the head Purger calls in security to suppress the uprising. Shane is shot and killed by security forces. As Liz mourns Shane\u2019s death, the anti-Purge group attacks the compound, killing the security forces and remaining Purgers; Liz chooses to stay with the resistance fighters to retaliate against Shane's murderers, while Leo, Eva and Cali leave. Leo [[carjacking|carjacks]] the auctioneer, holding her at gunpoint and threatening her before leaving in her car.\n\nLeo, Eva, and Cali drive up to a suburban neighborhood and stop at the home of Warren Grass at 6:55 A.M, five minutes before the end of the purge. After telling the story of his son's death, he ventures into the house despite Eva and Cali's pleas, threatening Warren and his wife. Later, Leo exits the house covered in blood, only to be shot by Big Daddy, who reveals that the New Founding Fathers have secretly dispatched [[death squad]]s to increase the body count because the purge eliminates too few of the lower class, due to most of the Purgers murdering those they have personal grudges against and not just random people, which was the NFFA's original intentions when the Purge was conceived. Just as Big Daddy is about to kill Leo, Warren appears and kills Big Daddy with a single shot from a handgun, revealing that Leo chose to forgive and spare him. As Big Daddy's death squad appears while Eva, Cali, and Warren prepare to defend themselves, sirens blare to signal the end of the purge (making Big Daddy's death legal and sparing Leo). Warren drives Eva, Cali, and Leo to the hospital as news and police helicopters fly over the city.\n\nAt the end of the film, it is shown that it is 7:09 on the morning of March 22 and that there are 364 days until the next purge.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Frank Grillo]] as [[Sergeant Leo Barnes|Leo Barnes]] (credited as the \"Sergeant\"),<ref>{{cite news|last1=DeMonaco|first1=James|title=Behind the Anarchy (Blu-Ray Documentary)|publisher=Universal Pictures|date=2014}}</ref><ref>The character's name was revealed to be \"Leo Barnes\" in ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]''.</ref> an off duty [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] [[Police Sergeant]] who goes out on Purge Night to find Warren Grass so he can avenge his son's death.\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Eva Sanchez, a waitress\n* [[Zach Gilford]] as Shane, estranged husband of Liz\n* [[Kiele Sanchez]] as Liz, estranged wife of Shane\n* [[Zo\u00eb Soul]] as Cali Sanchez, Eva's 17-year old daughter\n* [[Justina Machado]] as Tanya, friend of Eva and co-worker\n* [[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]] as Papa Rico Sanchez, father of Eva and Cali's grandfather\n* [[Jack Conley (actor)|Jack Conley]] as Big Daddy, leader of a Death Squad\n* [[Noel Gugliemi|Noel G.]] as Diego, an obsessed building caretaker at Eva and Cali's residence\n* [[Castulo Guerra]] as Barney, father of Tanya and Lorraine\n* [[Michael K.
