The film was [[film director|directed]] by [[Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m]] and stars [[Clive Owen]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[David Morrissey]], [[Rza|RZA]] and [[Xzibit]]. The story is based on the [[Badger game|Badger Game]] con. This was the first film to be released by [[The Weinstein Company]] in the United States. \n\n== Plot ==\nChicago advertising executive Charles Schine lives with his wife Deanna and their daughter Amy, who suffers from [[type 1 diabetes]], which requires expensive medication.\n\nOn a commuter train to work one morning, Charles meets Lucinda Harris, a financial advisor who is also married with a daughter. A mutual attraction develops and the two begin meeting frequently. They soon decide to consummate their affair in a run-down motel. As Lucinda is unzipping Charles' pants, they are interrupted by an armed man who beats Charles and brutally rapes Lucinda. Not wanting their spouses to learn of their affair, Charles and Lucinda agree not to report the crime and then go their separate ways.\n\nDays later, the man, who identifies himself as Philippe LaRoche, contacts Charles and threatens to kill his family if he does not pay him $20,000. A month later, LaRoche calls again, this time demanding $100,000. Charles explains his situation to his work colleague Winston, an ex-con who works as a repairman in his building. Winston offers to scare off LaRoche for ten percentage of the payout. Charles embezzles $10,000 from his company and he and Winston plot to get the drop on LaRoche at his specified meeting location. However, LaRoche surprises him, shoots Winston dead and takes the money. Charles disposes of Winston's body and gives a false alibi when questioned by Detective Franklin Church.\n\nCharles later receives a call from LaRoche; he is holding Lucinda hostage and will kill her if he does not deliver the $100,000. Charles takes the money from an account meant for his daughter's medical treatment and makes the payoff to LaRoche and his partner Dexter. Charles then visits Lucinda at work and discovers she is actually called Jane, who worked there briefly as a temp. He goes to Jane's apartment, which is being shown to prospective renters, and finds that Jane's photograph of her supposed daughter is actually a cut-out of a stock picture from a brochure.\n\nCharles tracks Jane down and sees her kissing LaRoche, learning she was in on the scam. He also observes her seducing another unsuspecting businessman, Sam. Charles rents a room at the same motel as before and waits for Jane to go there with Sam. Determined to retrieve his stolen money, Charles knocks LaRoche unconscious outside the hotel room door, disarms him, and reveals to Sam the scheme he has been set up for. Dexter arrives to back up LaRoche and a gunfight ensues; nearly everyone is fatally shot but Charles, who returns to his room and convinces the police he was just a bystander. Before leaving, Charles claims his briefcase and gets back the money.\n\nLater, Charles is suspended from work for the embezzlement and is sentenced to six months of [[community service]], teaching in a prison. During one of his classes, he comes across a notebook containing a story about him written by one of the students. Charles finds LaRoche, who had survived the gunfight. LaRoche threatens to continue to disrupt Charles' life but Charles reveals that he has planned their encounter and then stabs LaRoche to death with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shank]].\n\nCharles walks away from the encounter by claiming to Detective Church that LaRoche attacked him and he reacted in [[self-defence]]. He returns to his family.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Clive Owen]] as Charles Schine\n*[[Jennifer Aniston]] as Jane (\"Lucinda Harris\")\n*[[Vincent Cassel]] as Philippe LaRoche\n*[[Melissa George]] as Deanna Schine\n*[[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Detective Franklin Church\n*[[Rza|RZA]] as Winston Boyko\n*[[Xzibit]] as Dexter\n*[[Addison Timlin]] as Amy Schine\n*[[Tom Conti]] as Eliot Firth\n*[[Rachael Blake]] as Susan Davis\n*[[Denis O'Hare]] as Jerry the Lawyer\n*[[Georgina Chapman]] as Candy\n*[[David Morrissey]] as Sam Griffin\n*[[David Oyelowo]] as Patrol Officer\n*[[Danny McCarthy]] as Correctional Officer Hank\n*[[Ortis Deley]] as Cop\n*[[Richard Leaf]] as Night Clerk Ray\n*[[Catherine McCord]] as Avery Price Receptionist\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''Derailed'' opened in 2,443 theaters for an opening weekend gross of $12,211,986. The film made a domestic gross of $36,024,076 and an international gross of $21,455,000, giving it a worldwide gross of $57,479,076.<ref name=BOM/>\n\n=== Critical response ===\n''Derailed'' received mainly negative reviews and has a \"rotten\" score of {{RT data|score}} on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}. The critical consensus states \"With miscast stars, a ludicrous plot and an obvious twist, ''Derailed'' embodies its name all too aptly.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/derailed|title=Derailed|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|access-date={{RT data|access date}}}}{{RT data|edit}}</ref> The film also has a score of 40 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 34 critics indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/derailed Metacritic]</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film two and a half out of four stars and believed that Owen's and Aniston's performances were intriguing. Ebert said, \"Clive Owen was my candidate for James Bond, and can play hard and heartless rotters (see ''[[Closer (2004 film)|Closer]]''), but here he is quiet and sad, with a sort of passivity. He lets his face relax into acceptance of his own bad fortune. Jennifer Aniston does that interesting thing of not being a stereotyped sexpot but being irresistibly intriguing. That works with a man like Charles. Happily married, in debt, worried about his daughter and his job, he would be impervious to a sexy slut.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051110/REVIEWS/51107004|title=Derailed|author-link=Roger Ebert|author=Ebert, Roger|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|access-date=July 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Derailed OST\n| type         = film score\n| artist       = [[Ed Shearmur]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = November 8, 2005\n| genre        = [[Film score|Score]]{{*}}Various\n| length       = 38:40\n| label        = [[Wu Music Group]]\n| producer     = \n| prev_title   = [[The Skeleton Key]]\n| prev_year    = 2005\n| next_title   = [[The Ex (2006 film)|The Ex]]\n| next_year    = 2006\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = [[Ed Shearmur]]\n| title1 = Winston's Theme (Orchestral)\n| length1 = 2:18\n| title2 = Charles' Theme (Orchestral)\n| length2 = 1:29\n| title3 = \n| length3 = \n| title4 = \n| length4 = \n| title5 = \n| length5 = \n| title6 = \n| length6 = \n| title7 = \n| length7 = \n| title8 = \n| length8 = \n| title9 = \n| length9 = \n| title10 = \n| length10 = \n| title11 = \n| length11 = \n| title12 = \n| length12 = \n| title13 = \n| length13 = \n| title14 = \n| length14 = \n| title15 = \n| length15 = \n| title16 = \n| length16 = \n| title17 = \n| length17 = \n| title18 = \n| length18 = \n| title19 = \n| length19 = \n| title20 = \n| length20 = \n| total_length = 3:47\n}}\n\n=== Additional music by ===\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = \n| title1 = [[Johnny]]\n| length1 = 4:05\n| music1 = [[Flemming Rasmussen]]\n| title2 = I Love You\n| length2 = 3:32\n| music2 = [[RZA]]\n| title3 = [[Sabotage]]\n| length3 = 4:02\n| music3 = Hot Will ft.
