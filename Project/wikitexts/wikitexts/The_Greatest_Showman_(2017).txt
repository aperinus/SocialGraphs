Barnum]] and his tailor father Philo work for the Hallett family. Barnum falls for the Halletts\u2019 daughter, Charity. When Charity attends [[finishing school]], she and Barnum write to each other until reuniting as adults. They eventually marry and raise two daughters Caroline and Helen in [[New York City]]. They live a humble life and though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more.\n\nBarnum loses his shipping clerk job when the company goes bankrupt, due to a typhoon that sank all the firm's cargo vessels. He later secures a bank loan, deceptively using his former employer's lost ships as \"collateral\". He opens [[Barnum's American Museum]] in downtown [[Manhattan]] which features various wax figures. Ticket sales are slow, so Caroline and Helen suggest showcasing something \"alive\". Barnum adds \"freak\" performers, such as [[bearded lady]] Lettie Lutz and [[dwarfism|dwarf]] man [[Tom Thumb|Charles Stratton]]. This garners higher attendance, but also protests and poor reviews from well-known critic [[James Gordon Bennett Sr.|James Gordon Bennett]].\n\nBarnum renames his venture, \"Barnum's Circus\" and recruits playwright Phillip Carlyle to help generate publicity. Phillip is mesmerized by the African American trapeze artist, Anne Wheeler, but he hides his feelings. Phillip arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet [[Queen Victoria]]. Barnum persuades famed Swedish singer [[Jenny Lind]] to tour America, with him as her manager. Lind's American debut is a success. During her song, Phillip's parents see him and Anne holding hands. As Barnum gains favor with aristocratic patrons, he distances himself from his troupe, advising them to work without him. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local harassers.\n\nWhen Phillip and Anne attend the theater together, they run into Phillip's parents. They chastise him for \"parading around with the help\". Phillip tries to convince Anne that they can be together, but she disagrees saying they will never be accepted socially. As Barnum takes Lind on a U.S. tour, Charity, who stays home with the girls, feels isolated from her husband. While on tour, Lind becomes romantically attracted to Barnum. When he rebuffs her, she threatens to quit and later retaliates with a surprise kiss at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press.\n\nBarnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between protesters and the troupe. Phillip runs into the burning building to save Anne, not knowing that she has already escaped. He suffers serious injuries before Barnum rescues him. Bennett tells Barnum that the culprits have been caught and that Lind has cancelled her tour after Barnum's \"scandal\". Barnum's mansion is foreclosed and Charity takes the girls to her parents' home.\n\nDevastated, Barnum retreats to a local bar. His troupe finds him there and say that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family. Inspired, he resolves to build a new show and not let ambition rule him. Phillip awakens in a hospital with Anne by his side, while Barnum and Charity reconcile.\n\nA recovering Phillip offers his share of the profits to help Barnum rebuild the circus in exchange for becoming a full partner, which Barnum readily accepts. To economize, Barnum transforms the enterprise into an open-air tent circus.\n\nThe revamped circus is a huge success and Barnum has Phillip take his place as the ringmaster so the former can spend more time with his family. Barnum leaves the circus early and arrives on an elephant to attend Caroline and Helen's ballet recital.\n\nThe movie ends with a quote from P.T. Barnum that reads \"The noblest art is that of making others happy\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[P.&nbsp;T.

Barnum isn't the hero the 'Greatest Showman' wants you to think\", highlighting that \"his path to fame and notoriety began by exploiting an enslaved woman, in life and in death, as entertainment for the masses\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mansky |first1=Jackie |title=P.T.

At the time it was illegal to own slaves in New York but Barnum got around this by \"renting\" Ms. Heth. Barnum also falsely claimed that she had raised George Washington. After Heth died in 1836, Barnum arranged a public autopsy, which he charged admission for. In her book ''Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present'', Harriet Washington included this as an example of the way African Americans were treated as subhuman in terms of medical procedures and testing.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Washington |first1=Harriet |title=Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present |date=January 8, 2008 |publisher=Anchor; Illustrated edition |isbn=978-0767915472}}</ref> Another Barnum hoax was the ''Fiji Mermaid'' which in reality was the body of a monkey and the tail of a fish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kunhardt |first1=Philip B.

Two of the lead characters, Phillip Carlyle and Ann Wheeler, were completely fictional. The character of Jenny Lind is portrayed as a glamorous woman who becomes infatuated with Barnum and, when he doesn't respond to her overtures, quits the show. In her final performance, she lures Barnum out to the stage for a public kiss in an attempt to flame rumors about their romance. In reality, Lind dressed plainly and was known for her charitable donations both in her home country and to various charities in the US. Neither Lind nor Barnum displayed any romantic interest in each other. Lind found Barnum to be crude and Barnum was more interested in money than romance. Lind broke off her successful tour with Barnum early because she was unhappy with Barnum's marketing.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Golden Kellem |first1=Betsy |title=The Greatest Showman: The True Story of P.T.
