It stars [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Willem Dafoe]] as two [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents investigating the disappearance of three civil rights workers in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi, who are met with hostility by the town's residents, local police, and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].\n\nScreenwriter [[Chris Gerolmo]] began the script in 1985 after researching the 1964 murders of [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]]. He and producer [[Frederick Zollo]] presented it to [[Orion Pictures]], and the studio hired Parker to direct the film. The writer and director had disputes over the script, and Orion allowed Parker to make uncredited rewrites. The film was shot in a number of locations in Mississippi and [[Alabama]], with [[principal photography]] from March to May 1988.\n\nOn release, ''Mississippi Burning'' was criticized by activists involved in the [[civil rights movement]] and the families of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner for its fictionalization of events. Critical reaction was generally positive, with praise aimed towards the performances of Hackman, Dafoe and [[Frances McDormand]]. The film grossed $34.6 million in North America against a production budget of $15 million. It received seven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. The plot summary is recommended to be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1964, three civil rights workers \u2013 two Jewish and one black \u2013 go missing while in Jessup County, Mississippi, organizing a voter registry for [[African Americans]] after having being shot dead in their car by pursuants. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sends Alan Ward and Rupert Anderson to investigate. Ward is a Northerner, senior in rank but much younger than Anderson, and approaches the investigation by the book. In contrast, Anderson, a former Mississippi sheriff, is more nuanced in his approach. The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies influence the public and are linked to a branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered and their bodies buried in an [[Embankment dam|earthen dam]]. Pell beats his wife brutally in retribution after discovering her betrayal.\n\nWard and Anderson's different approaches spill over into a physical fight which Ward wins but concedes his methods have been ineffective and gives Anderson carte blanche to deal with the problem his way. Anderson devises a plan to indict members of the Klan for civil rights violations, instead of murder, as civil rights are federal charges where conviction is more certain compared to a state-level charge of murder. The FBI arranges a kidnapping of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack, where he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he speaks out. Tilman gives him a complete description of the killings, including the names of those involved. The abductor is revealed to be an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman. Although the obtained information is not admissible in court due to [[coercion]], it does prove valuable to the investigators.\n\nAnderson and Ward concoct a plan, luring identified Klan collaborators to a bogus meeting, but the men soon realize they have been set up and leave without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrates on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest who exhibits a nervous demeanor, which the agents believe might yield a confession. The Feds pick him up and interrogate him. Anderson stages a tussle with Pell at the local barbershop in retaliation for the attack of his wife and takes off. Later, Cowens is at home when a shotgun blast shatters his window. After seeing a [[burning cross]] on his lawn, he attempts to flee in his truck but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The team arrives to rescue him, having staged the entire scenario where the hooded men are revealed to be other FBI agents.\n\nCowens, believing that his fellow rednecks have threatened his life because of his admissions to the FBI, incriminates his accomplices. The Klansmen are all charged with civil rights violations, as this can be prosecuted at the federal level. Most of the perpetrators are convicted, while Stuckey is acquitted of all charges. Tilman is later found dead by the FBI from suicide. Mrs. Pell returns to her home, which has been completely ransacked by vandals. She resolves to stay and rebuild her life, free of her husband. Before leaving town, Anderson and Ward visit an integrated congregation, gathered at an African-American cemetery, where the black civil rights activist's desecrated gravestone reads, \"Not Forgotten.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as FBI Agent Rupert Anderson (based on [[John Proctor (FBI agent)|John Proctor]])\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as FBI Agent Alan Ward (based on [[Joseph Sullivan (FBI agent)|Joseph Sullivan]])\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Mrs. Pell (based on [[Cecil Price|Conner Price]])\n* [[Brad Dourif]] as Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell (based on [[Cecil Price]])\n* [[R.

Gerolmo and Parker have admitted taking [[artistic license]] with the source material describing it as essentially a <nowiki>''work of fiction''</nowiki>. The killing itself, as portrayed in the film, differed from the actual events in several ways.  In the film, during the car stop precipitating the murder, the driver is white (presumably either Andrew Goodman or Michael Schwerner), and the black civil rights volunteer (presumably James Chaney) is in the back seat.  In reality, James Chaney had been driving the car because he was familiar with the area.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web |title=True Crime Story: Mississippi Burning (Crime Documentary) {{!}} Real Stories |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8cVY-E5eyg&t=2395s&ab_channel=RealStoriesRealStories |website=Youtube |access-date=22 May 2021}}</ref>  The film presents the murders as having been committed at the scene of the stop while the victims were in their car, beginning with Frank Bailey putting a revolver to the temple of the car's driver and shooting.  In reality, all three victims were removed from the car and driven to another location, where both Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were shot once in the heart, followed by James Chaney who had been shot three times.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> Much of the violence and intimidation of the black people in the film is drawn from events that occurred at the time, although not necessarily in relation to this investigation.
