He also talks about his love for poetry, his friendship with Jada, what his lyrics mean, and about the negative resentment the media has had on him. This documentary then details his shooting, his reaction to getting shot, his paranoia after getting shot, and ultimately his death. The documentary ends with Tupac coming to terms with his life and his past, understanding the wrongs that he has done, as well as giving a monologue about stereotypes of Black men, telling Blacks to not give in to stereotypes and to control themselves, and it also shows the impact Tupac has had on the entire world.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n''Tupac: Resurrection'' has an approval rating of 78% on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 90 reviews, and an average rating of 6.75/10.
