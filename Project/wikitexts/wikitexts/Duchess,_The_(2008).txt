It is based on [[Amanda Foreman (historian)|Amanda Foreman]]'s biography of the late-18th century [[British aristocracy|English aristocrat]] [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]]. She was an ancestor of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], where the quote \u2018There were three people in her marriage\u2019 in the promotional poster comes from. It was released in September 2008 in the United Kingdom. The film won the [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe young [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Georgiana]] is contracted in marriage to [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire|William Cavendish]], Duke of Devonshire, with the expectation that she produce his male heir. Georgiana is quickly disillusioned by her husband, especially when Charlotte, an illegitimate child fathered by William whose mother has died, comes to live with them while Georgiana is pregnant. William expects Georgiana to tolerate the child's presence. He also suggests that she \"practise mothering\" on the young girl. When Georgiana gives birth to a girl, William is displeased. In his mind, he has fulfilled his obligations to her as her husband but, by failing to provide him with a legitimate male heir, she has failed in her obligations as his wife.\n\nGeorgiana socialises with the young [[Elizabeth Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Lady Bess Foster]] at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and invites her to live with them since Bess has nowhere else to go. William has an affair with Bess, causing Georgiana to feel robbed of her only friend and betrayed by Bess. Bess tells Georgiana that her motive is to regain her three sons (whom her husband has taken from her), so she continues to live with them.\n\nGeorgiana starts an affair with [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]]. William is outraged when Georgiana suggests that since he has Bess, she should be allowed Charles. William rapes Georgiana; a [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|male child]] is the product. Bess encourages the affair between Georgiana and Charles after the birth of Georgiana's son. Soon, the whole of London society learns of Georgiana's affair. William threatens to end Charles's political career and forbid Georgiana from seeing her children again if she does not end the relationship. After initially refusing, Georgiana ends her relationship with Grey but tells William that she is pregnant with Charles' child. She is sent to the countryside where she gives birth to her daughter with Grey, [[Eliza Courtney]], who is given to the Grey family to raise as Charles' niece.\n\nGeorgiana finds comfort in Bess's friendship during her time of giving birth to Eliza. Georgiana and William come to terms with one another and, along with Bess, continue their lives together.\n\nThe after-credits reveal Georgiana secretly visits her daughter Eliza. Eliza goes on to name her own daughter Georgiana, after her mother. Charles later becomes Prime Minister under [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. Before she dies, Georgiana permits William and Bess to marry.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]]\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Elizabeth Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Lady Elizabeth 'Bess' Foster]]\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as [[Georgiana Spencer, Countess Spencer]], Georgiana's mother\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey]]\n* [[Aidan McArdle]] as The Right Honourable [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]\n* [[Simon McBurney]] as The Right Honourable [[Charles James Fox]]\n* Sebastian Applewhite as [[Augustus Clifford|Sir Augustus Clifford, 1st Baronet]]\n* [[Calvin Dean (II)|Calvin Dean]] as Devonshire House Servant\n* Emily Jewell as Nanny\n* [[Richard McCabe]] as Sir James Hare\n* [[Bruce Mackinnon]] as actor playing Sir Peter Teazle in ''[[The School for Scandal]]''\n* [[Alistair Petrie]] as Heaton\n* [[Georgia King]] as actress playing Lady Teazle in ''[[The School for Scandal]]''\n* [[Camilla Arfwedson]] as Lady Charlotte\n\n== Production ==\n''The Duchess'' was produced by British [[Qwerty Films]] and American Magnolia Mae Films, with financial support from [[BBC Films]], French [[Path\u00e9]] and Italian [[:it:BiM Distribuzione|BIM Distribuzione]].<ref>Dawtrey, Adam (29 July 2007) [https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117969388.html?categoryId=13&cs=1 Keira Knightley set for ''Duchess'': Actress to play the controversial blueblood], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''</ref> The film was shot at [[Twickenham Film Studios]] and on location at [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Holkham Hall]], [[Clandon Park]], [[Kedleston Hall]], [[Somerset House]], [[King's College London]] and the [[Old Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich, England|Greenwich]].\n\nRegarding lead [[actress]] [[Keira Knightley]], [[Film director|director]] [[Saul Dibb]] said ''The Duchess'' was \"a chance to take a character from late childhood&nbsp;&ndash; she's married at 17&nbsp;&ndash; into full adulthood, 10 years later.\"<ref name=\"EW Fall Preview\">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20219070_20219072_20218882,00.html| title=2008 Fall Movie Guide: Preview: ''The Duchess''| magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| issue=1007/1008| date=22\u201329 August 2008| page=50| access-date=2008-10-02}}</ref> It was also a chance for Knightley to work with [[Ralph Fiennes]], whom she regarded as one of her most accomplished co-stars to date; Dibb said, \"When I said, 'We've got Ralph interested in playing the Duke,' we both took a gulp and went, 'F---.' {{sic}} ...
