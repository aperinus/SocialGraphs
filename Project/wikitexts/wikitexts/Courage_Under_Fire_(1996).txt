It is the second collaboration between Washington and director Zwick. The film was released in the United States on July 12, 1996, to positive reviews and grossed $100 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile serving in the [[Gulf War]], Lieutenant Colonel Serling accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing nighttime battle, killing his friend, Captain Boylar. The [[United States Army]] covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job.\n\nLater, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden should be the first woman to receive ([[posthumous award|posthumously]]) the [[Medal of Honor]]. She was the commander of a [[Medevac]] [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey]] helicopter sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopter. When Walden encountered a [[T-54]] enemy tank, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a [[flare gun]]. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and when the survivors were rescued the next day, Walden was reported dead.\n\nSerling notices inconsistencies among the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic, praises Walden strongly. However, Staff Sergeant John Monfriez claims that Walden was a coward and that he led the crew in combat and improvised the fuel bladder weapon. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and unconscious throughout. Furthermore, the crew of the Black Hawk claim that they heard firing from an [[M16 rifle|M16]], but Ilario and Monfriez claim it was out of ammo.\n\nSerling is under pressure from the [[White House]] and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg, to wrap things up quickly. To prevent another [[cover-up]], Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner. When Serling grills Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.\n\nSerling tracks Ilario down, and Ilario finally tells him the truth. Monfriez wanted to flee, which would mean abandoning Rady. When Walden refused, he pulled a gun on her. Walden then shot an enemy who suddenly appeared behind Monfriez, but Monfriez thought Walden was firing at him and shot her in the stomach, before backing off. The next morning, the enemy attacked again as a rescue party approached. Walden covered her men's retreat, firing an M16. However, Monfriez told the rescuers that Walden was dead, so they left without her. [[Napalm]] was then dropped on the entire area. Altameyer tried to expose Monfriez's lie at the time, but was too injured to speak, and Ilario remained silent, scared of the court-martial Walden had threatened them with.\n\nSerling presents his final report to Hershberg. Walden's young daughter receives the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony. Later, Serling tells the truth to the Boylars about the manner of their son's death and says he cannot ask for forgiveness. The Boylars forgive him and tell him he must release his burden at some point.\n\nIn the last moments, Serling has a flashback of when he was standing by Boylar's destroyed tank and a medevac Huey was lifting off with his friend's body. Serling suddenly realizes Walden was the pilot.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Denzel Washington]] as Lieutenant Colonel Nathaniel Serling\n*[[Meg Ryan]] as Captain Karen Emma Walden\n*[[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as Staff Sergeant John Monfriez\n*[[Matt Damon]] as Specialist Andrew Ilario\n*[[Bronson Pinchot]] as Bruno, a White House aide\n*[[Seth Gilliam]] as Sergeant Steven Altameyer\n*[[Regina Taylor]] as Meredith Serling\n*[[Michael Moriarty]] as Brigadier General Hershberg\n*[[\u017deljko Ivanek]] as Captain Ben Banacek\n*[[Scott Glenn]] as Tony Gartner, a ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran\n*[[Tim Guinee]] as Warrant Officer One A.
