The film was released one month before Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced the [[perestroika]] reforms.\n\n==Plot==\nChuck Murdock (Joshua Zuehlke), a 12-year-old boy from [[Montana]] and the son of a military jet pilot, becomes anxious after seeing a [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman missile]] on a school field trip, which is intensified by a nightmare of a fork dropping after being told that the speed and effectiveness would be done \"before a dropped fork hits the floor\". Chuck protests the existence of [[nuclear weapons]] by refusing to play baseball, which results in the forfeit of a [[Little League]] game by his team.\n\n\"Amazing Grace\" Smith, a fictional [[Boston Celtics]] player (played by [[NBA]] star [[Alex English]]), catches a blurb about the story in his newspaper and decides to emulate Chuck, saying he will no longer participate in professional basketball unless there are no more nuclear weapons. This gives it nationwide coverage, inspiring more pro athletes to join the protest against nuclear weapons. Smith then moves to Montana to meet with Chuck and buys an old barn, which he and the other athletes renovate into their residence. Smith's agent, Lynn ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) is unsure about what he hopes to accomplish but decides to support him and Chuck.\n\nThe film reaches a climax when the [[President of the United States]] ([[Gregory Peck]]) personally meets with Chuck, admiring his resolve but at the same time explaining the practical difficulties of disarmament.\n\n==Cast==\n* Dean Alexander as Sports Broadcaster\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Lynn Taylor\n* Jim Allen as Missile Soldier\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as President\n* [[William Petersen]] as Russell\n* [[Red Auerbach]] as Himself\n* [[Lee Richardson (actor)|Lee Richardson]] as Jeffries\n* Joshua Zuehlke as Chuck Murdock\n* [[Alex English]] as Amazing Grace Smith\n* [[Alan Autry]] as George\n* [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] as Hot Dog\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Pamela\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0092545|Amazing Grace and Chuck}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|amazing_grace_and_chuck}}\n* {{Mojo title|amazinggraceandchuck}}\n\n{{Mike Newell}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amazing Grace And Chuck}}\n[[Category:1987 films]]\n[[Category:1980s sports drama films]]\n[[Category:American baseball films]]\n[[Category:American basketball films]]\n[[Category:American sports drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein]]\n[[Category:Films about fictional presidents of the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mike Newell]]\n[[Category:Films set in Montana]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Montana]]\n[[Category:TriStar Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1987 drama films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]\n\n\n{{1980s-drama-film-stub}}\n{{sport-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
