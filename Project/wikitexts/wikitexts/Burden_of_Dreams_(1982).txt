Blank said that he felt \"unconnected to the people around me\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blank|first1=Les|author-link=Les Blank|last2=Bogan|first2=James|title=Burden of dreams : screenplay, journals, reviews, photographs|year=1984|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-0-938190-17-2|pages=86}}</ref> Keeping up with the antics of Herzog and [[Klaus Kinski]] (the film's star) proved difficult for the reserved, introverted Blank. By the last week of production, he was so burnt out that he feared coming out of production \"like some Viet Nam veterans, horribly calloused\". He wrote in his journal, \"I'm tired of it all and I couldn't care less if they move the stupid ship \u2013 or finish the fucking film\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blank|first1=Les|last2=Bogan|first2=James|title=Burden of dreams : screenplay, journals, reviews, photographs|year=1984|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0-938190-17-2|pages=112, 114}}</ref>\n\nBlank would often ask Herzog to repeat statements while being filmed that he originally made off-camera. In a 2009 interview with Jesse Pearson for ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine, Blank was asked to recall a scene in the documentary showing Herzog delivering a monologue about the violence and destruction of the jungle around him. Blank says that the scene originally took place in the middle of a canoe ride, away from cameras, but he liked the speech enough to coax it out of Herzog again. \"When the moment was right,\" Blank told ''Vice'', \"I pulled him aside and said, 'Can I do a little interview?' And he said, 'Sure.'\" A friend of Blank's \"led [Herzog] around to something that sparked him off on that tangent again. That's how we got the speech.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=2009-09-01 |author1=Jesse Pearson |author2=Jerry Hsu |title=Les Blank |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/avjgbk/les-blank-127-v16n9 |website=Vice.com }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 17 critics.<ref>{{Rotten tomatoes|burden_of_dreams}}</ref>\n \n[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film a full four stars, writing that \"Blank [...] is unafraid to ask difficult questions and portray Herzog, warts and all\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/burden-of-dreams-1982 |title=Burden of Dreams Movie Review (1982) |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=13 December 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe film received the 1983 [[British Academy Film Award]] for Best Documentary and was named Best of Festival at the [[San Francisco Film Festival]] the same year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://playbackonline.ca/2013/02/05/hot-docs-to-honor-blank/|title=Hot Docs to honour Blank|last=Benzine|first=Adam|date=5 February 2013|work=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]]|publisher=Brunico Communications}}</ref>\n\nThe film poster was created by Montana artist [[Monte Dolack]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Burden of Dreams |website=Monte Dolack Fine Art |url=https://www.dolack.com/collections/posters-archive/products/movie-burden-of-dreams |access-date=20 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Preservation==\nThe [[Academy Film Archive]] preserved ''Burden of Dreams'' in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=&filmmaker=Les+Blank&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\nOther documentaries about troubled movie productions:\n* ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'', about the making of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''\n* ''[[Lost Soul (2014 film)|Lost Soul]]'', about the making of the 1996 version of ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996 film)|The Island of Dr. Moreau]]''\n* ''[[Lost in La Mancha]]'', about the failed attempt to make ''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]''\n* ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]'', about the troubled pre-production and unsuccessful adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''\n* ''[[Empire of Dreams]]'', about the complicated production of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0083702}}\n* {{Amg movie|7569}}\n* {{tcmdb title|id=482012}}\n* {{AFI film|56737}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/367-burden-of-dreams-in-dreams-begin-responsibilities ''Burden of Dreams: In Dreams Begin Responsibilities''] an essay by [[Paul Arthur]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n* [http://www.cswap.com/1982/Burden_of_Dreams The captions of ''Burden of Dreams''] (English only) at CSwap - Browsable and searchable ([[JavaScript]] required)\n\n{{Les Blank}}\n{{BAFTA Award for Best Documentary}}\n{{Werner Herzog}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burden Of Dreams}}\n[[Category:1982 films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about film directors and producers]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Les Blank]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Amazonas (Brazilian state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Manaus]]\n[[Category:1982 documentary films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Werner Herzog]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
