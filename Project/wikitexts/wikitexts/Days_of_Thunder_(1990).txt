The cast includes [[Tom Cruise]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Randy Quaid]], [[Cary Elwes]], [[Caroline Williams]], and [[Michael Rooker]]. The film also features appearances by real life [[NASCAR]] racers, such as [[Richard Petty]], [[Rusty Wallace]], [[Neil Bonnett]], and [[Harry Gant]]. Commentator Dr. [[Jerry Punch]], of [[ESPN]], has a [[cameo appearance]], as does co-producer Don Simpson.\n\nThis is the first of three films to star both Cruise and Kidman (the other two being ''[[Far and Away]]'' and ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''). The film received mixed reviews, with criticism aimed at its unrealistic special effects, characters, screenplay, acting, dialogue and similarities to ''[[Top Gun]]'', but was widely praised for its action sequences, Hans Zimmer's musical score, fast pace, and the performances of Cruise and Kidman.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung racer Cole Trickle, from [[Eagle Rock, California]], has years of experience in [[Open wheel car|open-wheel racing]], winning championships with the [[World of Outlaws]]. Originally setting his sights on the [[Indianapolis 500]], Cole realizes that \"to win in [[IndyCar|Indy]] I'd need a great car, but stock cars are all the same\". [[Chevrolet]] dealership tycoon Tim Daland recruits him to race for his team in the [[NASCAR Cup Series]], bringing former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge out of retirement to lead Cole's pit crew (Harry had left NASCAR a year prior to avoid investigation involving the death of driver Buddy Bretherton). After Cole sets a fast time in a private test at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], Hogge builds him a new [[Chevrolet Lumina]].\n\nCole makes his first start at [[Phoenix Raceway|Phoenix]], where he has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew, while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion and dirty driver Rowdy Burns; these obstacles, combined with crashes and blown engines, prevent Cole from finishing the next three races at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]], [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]], and [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]]. Cole confesses to Harry that he does not understand any common NASCAR terminology, leading Harry to put him through rigorous training. This pays off at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], when Cole uses a [[Drafting (aerodynamics)#Stock car racing|slingshot maneuver]] from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race.\n\nThe rivalry between Cole and Rowdy intensifies throughout the season until the [[Coke Zero Sugar 400|Firecracker 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], where both drivers are seriously injured after being caught in \"[[The Big One (motorsport)|The Big One]]\". Recovering in [[Daytona Beach]], Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki, a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] at a local hospital. NASCAR President Big John brings Rowdy and Cole together in a meeting and warns them that he and his sport will no longer tolerate any misbehavior from the two rivals. The two bitter rivals soon become close friends after having dinner and settling their differences by smashing rental cars in a race on the beach, per Big John's persuasion.\n\nDaland hires hot-shot rookie Russ Wheeler to fill Cole's seat until Cole returns, and then expands his team, with Daland now fielding two teams \u2013 the second car driven by Wheeler, of which Harry disapproves. Though Cole shows signs of his old self, he falls into a new rivalry with Russ, leading to an engine failure at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]]. Daland offers no help to Cole or his team, as he is defensive of his new driver. At [[North Wilkesboro Speedway|North Wilkesboro]], Russ blocks Cole's path during their pit stop, and later forces Cole into the outside wall on the last lap to win the race. Cole retaliates by crashing into Russ' car after the race, leading to a fight between Harry, Daland, and both of Cole and Russ's pit crews, with Daland firing both Cole and Harry in the process.\n\nRowdy learns he has to undergo brain surgery to fix a broken blood vessel, and asks Cole to drive his car at the [[Daytona 500]] so his sponsor will pay for the year. Cole reluctantly agrees and convinces Harry to return as his crew chief. Hours prior to the race, Harry discovers metal in the oil pan, a sign of engine failure, and manages to procure a new engine from Daland, who still believes in his former driver's promise. During the race, Cole's car is spun out by Russ and suffers a malfunctioning transmission, but the combined efforts of Harry's and Daland's pit crews manage to fix the problem and get Cole back on the lead lap. On the final lap, Russ predicts that Cole will attempt his signature slingshot maneuver from outside, but Cole tricks him with a crossover, overtaking him from the inside to win his first Daytona 500.\n\nCole drives into Victory Lane, where he and his pit crew celebrate with Claire. He approaches Harry, sitting alone, who is lost for words. Cole asks Harry to walk with him and Harry agrees, challenging him to a foot race to Victory Lane.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:ColeTrickle46DaysofThunderCar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|No. 46 City Chevrolet used by Cole Trickle.]]\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as Cole Trickle, a young race car driver out to make a name for himself in NASCAR.

The studio's willingness to indulge director [[Michael Cimino]] on that film, as other studios had been doing up to that point, led to a backlash where studios favored producers like Simpson and Bruckheimer whose films bore far more of their imprint than any director who worked for them. ''Crimson Tide'', made several years after ''Days of Thunder'', was the critical and commercial success it was, Metcalf says, because after similar excesses on the producers' part like those that occurred on ''Thunder'' directors were allowed to reassert themselves.<ref name=\"Slate Metcalf piece\" />\n\n[[Quentin Tarantino]] said the film was his favorite big budget racing movie:\n<blockquote>Yeah, yeah, you laugh but seriously I\u2019m a big fan. To me ''Days of Thunder'' is the movie ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' and ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'' should have been. Sure, it had a big budget, big stars and a big director in Tony Scott, but it had the fun of those early [[American International Pictures|AIP]] movies.
