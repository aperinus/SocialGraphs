His father, Clarence Sr., wants to be master of his house, but finds his wife, Vinnie, and his children ignoring him until they start making demands for him to change his life. The story draws largely on Clarence Sr.'s stubborn, sometimes ill-tempered nature and Vinnie's insistence that Clarence Sr. be baptized.  It stars [[William Powell]] and [[Irene Dunne]] as Clarence Sr. and his wife, supported by [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Edmund Gwenn]], [[ZaSu Pitts]], [[Jimmy Lydon]] and [[Martin Milner]].<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=24789 \"Life with Father (1947)\"], [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM), Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc., New York, N.Y.; retrieved February 25, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nStockbroker Clarence Day is the benevolent curmudgeon of his 1880s New York City household, striving to make it function as efficiently as his Wall Street office but usually failing. His wife Vinnie is the real head of the household. In keeping with Day's actual family, all the children (all boys) are redheads. The anecdotal story encompasses such details as Clarence's attempts to find a new maid, a romance between his oldest son Clarence Jr. and pretty out-of-towner Mary Skinner, a plan by Clarence Jr. and his younger brother John to make easy money selling [[patent medicines]], Clarence's general contempt for the era's political corruption and the trappings of organized religion, and Vinnie's push to get him baptized so he can go to heaven.<ref>Erikson, Hal.

It was directed by [[Michael Curtiz]].\n\nDue to the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] standards of the day, the play's last line (in response to a policeman asking Mr. Day where he is going) \"I'm going to be baptized, dammit!\" had to be rewritten for the film, with the final word omitted. Mr. Day's frequent outbursts of \"Oh, God!\" were changed to \"Oh, gad!\" for the same reason.\n\n==Reception==\nLeading film critics in 1947 gave ''Life with Father'' high marks, especially with regard to the quality of Warner Bros.' screen adaptation of the popular Broadway play and the quality of the cast's performances. ''The New York Times'' in its review directed special attention to William Powell's portrayal of Clarence Day:\n\n{{blockquote|A round-robin of praise is immediately in order for all those, and they were many indeed, who assisted in filming ''Life with Father''. All that the fabulous play had to offer in the way of charm, comedy, humor and gentle pathos is beautifully realized in the handsomely Technicolored picture, which opened yesterday at the Warner (formerly the Hollywood) Theatre. William Powell is every inch Father, from his carrot patch dome to the tip of his button-up shoes. Even his voice, always so distinctive, has taken on a new quality, so completely has Mr. Powell managed to submerge his own personality. His Father is not merely a performance; it is character delineation of a high order and he so utterly dominates the picture that even when he is not on hand his presence is still felt.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E00E7D81631E13BBC4E52DFBE66838C659EDE \"'Life with Father,' Starring William Powell, Irene Donne, Recaptures Charm That Made the Lindsay-Crouse Play a Hit\"], movie review, ''The New York Times'' archives, August 16, 1947; retrieved February 23, 2018.</ref>}}\n\n''[[Film Daily]]'' summarized ''Life with Father'' as \"one of the finer examples of film making in Technicolor\" that provides \"a delightfully different insight into the human comedy of another day.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/filmdaily92wids#page/n297/mode/2up \"Reviews Of New Films: 'Life With Father'\"], ''Film Daily'' (New York, N.Y.), August 15, 1947, page 6; retrieved February 25, 2018.</ref> ''Variety'' complimented Irene Dunne's restrained performance as Vinnie as well as the work of the film's supporting players and the production's cinematography and overall direction:\n\n{{blockquote|Miss Dunne and Powell have captured to a considerable extent the play's charm...Miss Dunne compares very favorably with the [[Dorothy Stickney]] original role, exacting the comedy from the part without overplaying it...\n\nElizabeth Taylor, as the vis-a-vis for Clarence Day, Jr., is sweetly feminine as the demure visitor to the Day household, while Jimmy Lydon, as young Clarence, is likewise effective as the potential Yale man. Edmund Gwenn, as the minister, and ZaSu Pitts, a constantly visiting relative, head the supporting players who contribute stellar performances.\n\nIt's a superlative production all the way, and no less important than any other feature of the pic is the photography. Michael Curtiz' direction is excellent, though unable to achieve, because of the very nature of the pic, anything more than a pedestrian pace.<ref name=Variety1947/>}}\n\n===Box office===\nAccording to Warner Bros., the film earned them $5,057,000 in the U.S. and $1,398,000 in other markets, for a total of $6,455,000 against a production budget of $4,710,000.<ref name=\"warners\">Warner Bros financial information in The William Shaefer Ledger.
