The film is narrated by [[Joaquin Phoenix]], features music by [[Moby]], and was directed by [[Shaun Monson]], executive produced by Libra Max and co-produced by [[Maggie Q]]. A sequel titled ''[[Unity (film)|Unity]]'' was released in 2015.<ref name=Variety>{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Dave |title=Documentary 'Unity' Set for Aug. 12 Release with 100 Star Narrators|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/documentary-unity-set-for-aug-12-release-with-100-star-narrators-1201477200/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=May 1, 2015|date=April 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nCovering [[factory farms]], [[pet store]]s, [[puppy mill]]s, [[animal experimentation]], ''Earthlings'' includes footage obtained through the use of hidden cameras to chronicle the day-to-day practices of some of the largest industries in the world, all of which rely on animals. Then, the film draws parallels between [[speciesism]] and racism, sexism, and more.\n\n==Production==\nThe film started off as footage that writer, director, and producer [[Shaun Monson]] had shot at animal shelters around [[Los Angeles]] in 1999. Monson originally shot the footage for PSAs on spaying and neutering pets, but what he saw moved him so much that he turned it into a documentary. The film would take another six years to complete because of the difficulty of obtaining footage within these industries.<ref>{{cite web|title=About |url=http://earthlings.com/?page_id=10 |work=Earthlings.com |access-date=25 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625060234/http://earthlings.com/?page_id=10 |archive-date=June 25, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\n[[Joaquin Phoenix]] commented on the documentary, \"Of all the films I have ever made, this is the one that gets people talking the most.
