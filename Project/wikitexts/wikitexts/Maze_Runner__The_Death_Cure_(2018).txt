Nowlin]], based on the 2011 novel ''[[The Death Cure]]'' written by [[James Dashner]]. It is the sequel to the 2015 film ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]'' and the third and final installment in the [[Maze Runner (film series)|''Maze Runner'' film series]]. The film stars [[Dylan O'Brien]], [[Kaya Scodelario]], [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], [[Dexter Darden]], [[Nathalie Emmanuel]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Walton Goggins]], [[Ki Hong Lee]], [[Jacob Lofland]], [[Katherine McNamara]], [[Barry Pepper]], [[Will Poulter]], [[Rosa Salazar]], and [[Patricia Clarkson]].\n\n''Maze Runner: The Death Cure'' was originally set to be released on February 17, 2017, in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]], but the studio rescheduled the film's release for January 26, 2018, allowing time for O'Brien to recover from injuries he sustained during filming. The film received mixed reviews from critics with praise for the cast performances, action sequences and visual effects but criticism for the storyline and character development. The film grossed over $288&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nThomas, Newt and Frypan are the last of the free \"Gladers\". They and the Right Arm resistance retrieve other Immunes from a carriage of a train operated by WCKD, an organization responsible for capturing and experimenting on immune children. They discover that Minho, their remaining Glader friend whom WCKD had captured, was on a different carriage, which is headed to the \"Last City\", WCKD's base of operations. Against the orders of Vince, the leader of the Right Arm, the three head to Last City to rescue Minho, who is being tortured by WCKD in the hope of developing a cure for the virus. The group is attacked by Cranks, humans infected with the Flare. However, they are saved by Jorge and Brenda, who join them.\n\nThe group makes it to the wall of the Last City, which protects the city from Cranks. Outside the wall, people are rallying in protest to be let into the city. When WCKD opens fire at the protesters, the group is captured and taken to a hideout by a crew wearing gas masks. One of the members is revealed to be Gally, who survived Minho's attack. Gally takes them to see Lawrence, a rebellion leader, who helps Thomas, Newt and Gally enter the Last City. Gally leads Thomas and Newt through to the city and, after spotting Teresa, tells Thomas that he can get them into WCKD headquarters. Newt then confides to Thomas that he is infected. Promising to cure him, Thomas and Gally capture Teresa.\n\nDisguised as WCKD soldiers, Thomas, Newt and Gally escort Teresa inside WCKD headquarters and toward the location of the Immunes. Gally looks after the Immune children and stays to find a serum that slows the Flare. Thomas, Teresa and Newt go to find Minho, but are discovered and chased by Janson. Teresa lets them escape to find Minho before rushing to do a blood test on Thomas's blood, obtained when she was removing trackers from the Gladers. After delivering the Immune children and the serum to Brenda, Gally returns to WCKD headquarters to find Thomas. Brenda is forced to flee with the Immune children to avoid capture. Thomas and Newt reunite with Minho in the medical wing. Teresa discovers that Thomas's blood can cure the Flare. She shares her discovery with WCKD's leader, Ava Paige, both of whom agree that they must find Thomas. Brenda and the Immune children escape WCKD with Frypan's help.\n\nMeanwhile, Lawrence rallies his rebels outside the city before he blows a hole in the city wall and sacrifices himself to allow his allies and the infected people to storm the city. Gally saves Thomas, Newt, and Minho from WCKD soldiers. While Minho and Gally go to get the serum from Brenda, Thomas gets a pendant from Newt before Newt passes out. Teresa transmits her voice throughout the city and tells Thomas that his blood can save Newt if only he will return to WCKD. Newt, nearly consumed by the Flare, regains consciousness, attacks Thomas, and begs Thomas to kill him. When Thomas refuses, Newt stabs himself in the chest. Thomas returns to the WCKD facility and confronts Paige. While she talks with him, Janson, having caught the Flare, kills her and uses a sedative on Thomas. Thomas wakes up inside the facility. Teresa successfully removes some of his blood. She hears that Janson is interested only in curing himself and others whom he deems worthy. Teresa attacks Janson and frees Thomas, who fights with Janson. The fight ends when Thomas releases two Cranks, who kill Janson. With the building on fire, Thomas and Teresa escape to the roof. The rest of the team arrives on a berg. Thomas climbs aboard, but Teresa dies when the platform gives way as the building caves in.\n\nThe group escapes with the rest of the Immunes and the Right Arm to a safe haven, where the remaining population lives in safety. Thomas discovers that the pendant that Newt gave him had a note in it. He reads the note in which Newt tells him to look after everyone before he thanks Thomas for being his friend.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dylan O'Brien]] as Thomas\n* [[Kaya Scodelario]] as Teresa\n* [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]] as Newt\n* [[Dexter Darden]] as Frypan\n* [[Nathalie Emmanuel]] as Harriet\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Jorge\n* [[Aidan Gillen]] as Janson\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Lawrence\n* [[Ki Hong Lee]] as Minho\n* [[Jacob Lofland]] as Aris\n* [[Katherine McNamara]] as Sonya\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Vince\n* [[Will Poulter]] as Gally\n* [[Rosa Salazar]] as Brenda\n* [[Patricia Clarkson]] as Ava Paige\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn March 2015, it was confirmed that [[T.S.
