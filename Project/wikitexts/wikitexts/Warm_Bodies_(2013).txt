R and M achieve rudimentary communication with grunts and moans and occasional near-words. As a zombie, R does not have a heartbeat and constantly craves human flesh, especially brains, because he is able to \"feel alive\" through experiencing the victims' memories when he eats them.\n\nWhile R and a pack of zombies are hunting for food, they encounter Julie Grigio and a group of her friends, who were sent by Julie's father from a walled-off human enclave to recover medical supplies. R sees Julie and is drawn to her; his heart beats for the first time. After being shot in the chest by Julie's boyfriend, Perry, R kills him and eats his brain while Julie is distracted. Perry's memories increase R's attraction to Julie. He rescues her from the rest of the pack by wiping some zombie blood on her face, masking her scent, and takes her to an airplane he resides in to keep her safe.\n\nJulie is terrified of R and suspicious of his intentions. She starts trusting him after he rescues her during a failed escape attempt and finds food for her. R insists that Julie stay with him for a few days, until he deems it safe enough for her to leave. The two bond, listening to [[LP records]] and playing games to kill time, causing R to begin to come to life; his heart starts beating, and he is slowly able to communicate with more words.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tikkview.com/movies/3360-warm-bodies |title=Warm Bodies |work=tikkview.com |date=February 6, 2013 |access-date=February 23, 2013}}</ref> After a few days, Julie gets restless, and tries to return home, yet attracts swarms of zombies. After fending off a group including M, who is confused by R's actions, R decides to return her to the human enclave.\n\nOn the way, R reveals to Julie that he killed Perry, prompting her to abandon him and return home alone. R begins making his way back to the airport, heartbroken. He discovers that M and other zombies are also showing signs of life, making them targets for the Boneys \u2013 skeletal zombies who, having lost their humanity, have shed their flesh and prey on anything with a heartbeat. R and M lead a group to the human enclave, where R sneaks inside the wall.\n\nR finds Julie and meets her friend Nora, who is shocked to see R in the territory and notices R's growing humanity. When R reveals that the other corpses are also coming back to life, the three of them attempt to tell Colonel Grigio, Julie's father and the leader of the survivors. Colonel Grigio dismisses them and threatens to kill R, stopping only when Nora pulls a gun on him. Julie and R escape to a baseball stadium where the rest of R's group is waiting but find themselves under attack by Boneys.\n\nWhile M and his gang of zombies square off against the Boneys, Julie and R run but find themselves trapped. Taking the only escape route, R jumps with Julie into a pool far below, shielding her from the impact. After Julie pulls R from the bottom of the pool, they kiss. Colonel Grigio arrives and shoots R in the shoulder without warning. Julie attempts to persuade him that R has changed when she notices that he is bleeding from his wound \u2013 revealing that he has completely revived and is human once more. The humans and zombies combine forces and kill most of the Boneys while the rest perish from starvation, as the zombies slowly come back to life and assimilate into human society. Later, a fully human R and Julie watch the wall surrounding the city being demolished, signifying the end of the apocalypse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as R\n* [[Teresa Palmer]] as Julie\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as M\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Perry\n* [[Lio Tipton]]{{efn|name=Lio}} as Nora\n* [[Cory Hardrict]] as Kevin\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Colonel Grigio\n\n== Production ==\nThe studio [[Summit Entertainment]] backed the film,<ref>{{Cite news |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=May 2, 2011 |title=UK actor Nicholas Hoult starring in zombie romance |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/film-us-hoult-idUKTRE7210UL20110302 |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> which was produced by Bruna Papanadrea, [[David Hoberman]], and Todd Lieberman and executive produced by Laurie Webb and Cori Shepherd Stern.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=September 7, 2011 |title=John Malkovich Joining Zombie Movie 'Warm Bodies' |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/john-malkovich-joining-zombie-movie-232326 |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> The zombies can barely talk in the film, so extensive [[voice-over]]s were used to express their thoughts.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Steve |last=Weintraub |date=November 5, 2011 |title=Producers David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman Talk THE FIGHTER Sequel, WARM BODIES, and the Live-Action/Animation PHINEAS AND FERB Movie |work=collider.com |url=http://collider.com/david-hoberman-todd-lieberman-fighter-2-phineas-ferb-movie/124987/ |access-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWriter and director [[Jonathan Levine]] said even though this is a love story that involves zombies, he hoped people would not try to put the film into one category and zombie enthusiasts would be open to a new twist on the genre. \"I think this movie takes the mythology in a different direction, and I think there is a lot there for die-hard zombie fans,\" he explained. \"We're encouraging people to be open-minded, because it does take some liberties with the mythology, but at the same time, it's very grounded in the science of zombie-ism and uses that as a springboard for a more fantastical story.
