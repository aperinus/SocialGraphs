The film is based on the 1960 British film ''[[School for Scoundrels (1960 film)|School for Scoundrels]]''. The remake was released on September 29, 2006.\n\nThe remake has a similar theme to the original film, but a noticeably different plot and tone.\n\n==Plot==\nRoger is a downtrodden [[Meter maid|meter reader]], subject to ridicule from co-workers and regular denizens, who dreams of dating the [[Foreign exchange student|foreign graduate student]] who lives in his building, Amanda. To overcome his lack of self-esteem, he signs up for a course taught by Dr. P where Roger and his classmates are constantly bullied by Dr. P and his assistant Lesher, who likes to use outrageous and unethical methods on them, including humiliation. Some tasks they are required to do are quite cruel and primitive \u2013 like the task to start a conflict or even a fight with somebody they meet just to prove they are fearless. However, nobody intends to quit the course because Dr. P says he won't give a refund of $5,000 to anyone who quits or disobeys the orders given to them. The classmates even warn Roger that Dr. P will destroy him if his progress is too fast, just like he has done to one of his former students.\n\nWhile participating, Roger begins to develop a sense of personal pride and finally asks Amanda for a date where he uses tricks he learned during the course. Wanting to prove that he's still got his edge, Dr. P starts competing with Roger for Amanda. He approaches her with a false story that he is a successful and child-loving surgeon whose wife has died, and Amanda, who is a voluntary caretaker for animals, is immediately attracted and starts dating him. When Roger begins to see what's happening, he decides to take action to get Amanda back, although his actions are futile. After a competitive tennis match in which Roger humiliates him, Dr. P enlists the talents of Roger's classmates to break into Amanda's apartment and paint graffiti on the walls so he could frame Roger as a [[Stalking|stalker]]. Roger uses his authority as a meter reader to impound Dr. P's car, and in retaliation Dr. P gets Roger fired from his job.\n\nRoger learns of Dr. P's plans for Amanda, from Lonnie, a depressed former student, whose girlfriend was also led astray when he was humiliated by Dr. P. Lonnie shows Roger a [[fascicle (publishing)|fascicle]] full of evidence that Dr. P is a fraud, who uses [[Multiple identity|multiple identities]] and false stories to attract or distract his victims. After learning that Dr. P invited Amanda to Miami, Roger is determined to stop him once for all. He heads for the airport where Dr. P tells him he is a winner and grants him two tickets \u2013 one for him and one for Amanda. However, Roger at first doesn't know that Dr. P has sent him to the wrong gate. After realizing he was again tricked by Dr. P, Roger heads to the right gate and boards the plane to Miami in the last moment. With the aid of Lonnie and classmates, he finally exposes Dr. P's duplicity, it's revealed that Dr. P isn't a doctor or surgeon (he wanted to use a [[defibrillator]] on Roger who just fainted, but was truly faking) and that his wife is still alive. Amanda finally realizes she was wrong and returns to Roger. When meeting Roger after some time, Dr. P grants him a diploma for passing his course \u2013 the first diploma ever issued by him. He also invites Roger to attend one of his future courses as a guest, but Roger refuses. The film closes with a summary of what happened to most characters after the film's events.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] \u2013 Dr. P / Dennis Sherman\n* [[Jon Heder]] \u2013 Roger\n* [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] \u2013 Lesher\n* [[Jacinda Barrett]] \u2013 Amanda\n* [[Sarah Silverman]] \u2013 Becky\n* [[Ben Stiller]] \u2013 Lonnie\n* [[David Cross]] \u2013 Ian\n* [[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]] \u2013 Walsh\n* [[Horatio Sanz]] \u2013 Diego\n* [[Todd Louiso]] \u2013 Eli\n* [[Jon Glaser]] \u2013 Ernie\n* [[Paul Scheer]] \u2013 Little Pete\n* [[Dan Fogler]] \u2013 Zack\n* [[Luis Guzm\u00e1n]] \u2013 Sergeant Moorehead\n* [[DeRay Davis]] \u2013 Bee Bee\n* [[Joanne Baron]] \u2013 Lois\n* [[Andrew Daly]] as classmate\n* [[Jim Parsons]] as classmate\n* [[Aziz Ansari]] as classmate\n* [[Joseph Nunez]] as classmate\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Similarities between original and remake==\nThe character of Dr. P is a homage to the headmaster of the fictional Yeovil College of Lifemanship, Stephen Potter, in the original 1960 film.
