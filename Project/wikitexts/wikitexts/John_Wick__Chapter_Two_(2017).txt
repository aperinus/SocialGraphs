It is the second installment in the [[John Wick|''John Wick'' franchise]] and the sequel to the 2014 action film ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]''. It stars [[Keanu Reeves]] in the lead role, [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Riccardo Scamarcio]], [[Ruby Rose]], [[John Leguizamo]], and [[Ian McShane]]. The plot follows retired hitman John Wick (Reeves), who is forced back into his old life to fulfill a blood oath to an Italian crime lord. [[Principal photography]] began on October 26, 2015, in [[New York City]].\n\nThe film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on January 30, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 10, 2017. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences, direction, editing, visual style and the performances of the cast, particularly Reeves. The film grossed $171.5 million worldwide against its $40 million budget, twice the $86 million gross of the original film.<ref>{{cite Box Office Mojo |id=2911666 |title=John Wick |access-date=February 16, 2021}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum]]'', was released on May 17, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[John Wick (character)|John Wick]] recovers his stolen [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]] from Abram Tarasov, brother of the late Viggo.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2014 film ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]''.}} John dispatches Tarasov's men in a violent rampage that heavily damages the Mustang, but spares Tarasov under the promise of peace, and returns home. John is visited by the [[Camorra]] crime boss Santino D'Antonio, who reminds him that he was the one who helped John complete his \"impossible task\", which allowed John to retire and marry Helen. In return, John swore to a \"marker\", an unbreakable vow symbolized by a \"[[oath|blood oath]]\" medallion. Santino presents the marker to demand services from John, who declines. Santino retaliates by destroying John's house with a grenade launcher. John survives and travels to the Continental Hotel in [[New York City]] where Winston reminds John that if he rejects the marker, he will be violating one of the two unbreakable rules of the underworld: no killing on Continental grounds, and honoring every marker. John reluctantly accepts his commitment and meets with Santino, who tasks him with assassinating his sister, Gianna, so he can claim her seat at the \"High Table\", a council of twelve high-level crime bosses. Santino sends Ares, his [[muteness|mute]] bodyguard, to observe John's mission.\n\nIn [[Rome]], Italy, John infiltrates Gianna's [[coronation]] and confronts her in a dressing room. Faced with certain death, Gianna chooses to [[Suicide|take her own life]] by slitting her wrists. As Gianna dies, John shoots her in the head both to fulfill the marker and as a [[Declaration on Euthanasia|mercy]] [[Mercy killing|killing]]. As John leaves, Gianna's bodyguard, Cassian, recognizes John and upon realizing that he was sent to kill Gianna, attacks him. John flees to the [[catacombs]], where he is double-crossed by Ares and Santino's henchmen, who intend to tie up \"loose ends\" by killing him. After killing most of the henchmen, John is again pursued by Cassian. Their fight leads them into the reception area of the Rome Continental Hotel, which, like the New York Continental, prohibits conducting any \"business\" on its grounds. As the two share a drink, John explains his reason for killing Gianna. Nevertheless, Cassian promises John a quick and clean death as a sign of professional respect.\n\nAs John returns to New York City, Santino opens a [[Contract killing|contract]] for $7 million to kill John under the guise of avenging his sister, leading numerous assassins to unsuccessfully attack John. Cassian confronts John in the [[New York City Subway|subway]] and, after a vicious fight, is left with a knife stuck in his [[aorta]]. The badly injured John seeks help from an underground crime boss known as the [[Bowery]] King, whose subordinates treat John's injuries. Intrigued by John's intent to kill a member of the High Table, the Bowery King sportingly gives him a gun with only seven bullets, one for each million of the contract, and directs John to an art museum where Santino holds a gala. John pursues Santino throughout the museum, killing his remaining henchmen and Ares, but Santino manages to escape to the Continental, where he intends to remain indefinitely in its sanctuary. Despite Winston's warnings, the exasperated John shoots and kills Santino in the Continental lounge.\n\nThe next day, Winston meets with John and explains that, per the High Table, the contract on John has been doubled and offered globally. As a further consequence of killing Santino on Continental grounds, Winston declares John \"[[excommunication|excommunicado]]\", terminating all his access and privileges to underworld resources. However, Winston delays announcing John's excommunication by one hour to give him a head start and provides him with a marker for future use. Before leaving, John advises Winston to tell every other assassin for the High Table that when they try to hunt him, they will all be killed. John departs with his dog as Winston makes a call enacting John's \"excommunicado\" to be activated in one hour. As the contract is activated and cellular phones begin to ring all around him, John begins to run.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[John Wick (character)|Jardani Jovanovich / Johnathan \"John\" Wick]]\n* [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Cassian, Gianna's chief bodyguard<ref name=\"CommonCast\" />\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as \"The Bowery King\", an underground crime lord<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/john-wick-chapter-2-movie-update-keanu-reeves-talks-about-laurence-fishburnes-role/321468|title='John Wick: Chapter 2 Movie Update: Keanu Reeves Talks About Laurence Fishburne's Role|date=January 8, 2017|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108184734/http://www.movienewsguide.com/john-wick-chapter-2-movie-update-keanu-reeves-talks-about-laurence-fishburnes-role/321468|archive-date=January 8, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as Santino D'Antonio, an Italian [[Camorra]] boss who forces Wick to perform an assassination<ref name=\"NovemberCast\" />\n* [[Ruby Rose]] as Ares, an assassin and Santino's mute security enforcer<ref name=\"NovemberCast\" />\n* [[Lance Reddick]] as Charon, the concierge at the Continental Hotel in New York<ref name=\"NovemberCast\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]]<ref name=\"NovemberCast2\">{{cite news |last=Jaafar |first=Ali |url=https://deadline.com/2015/11/john-wicks-2-keanu-reeves-ian-mcshane-common-lionsgate-summit-basil-iwanyk-1201615113/|title='John Wick 2' Fills Out Cast, Old Favorites Return|date=November 9, 2015|access-date=November 9, 2015|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref> as Abram Tarasov, Viggo's brother, Iosef's uncle and a deskbound Russian gangster\n* [[Bridget Moynahan]] as Helen Wick, John's deceased wife<ref name=\"NovemberCast\" />\n* [[Franco Nero]] as Julius, the owner and manager of the Continental Hotel in Rome\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as Aurelio, the owner of a high-end [[chop shop]]<ref name=\"NovemberCast\" />\n* [[Ian McShane]] as Winston Scott, the owner and manager of the Continental Hotel in New York, a key underworld figure<ref name=\"McShaneCast2\">{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/keanu-reeves-john-wick-2-834725|title=Ian McShane Returns for Keanu Reeves' 'John Wick 2' (Exclusive)|date=October 26, 2015|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Claudia Gerini]] as Gianna D'Antonio, Santino's sister\n* Wass Stevens as Consiglieri\n* [[Peter Serafinowicz]] as The Sommelier, a weapons supplier in Hotel Continental\n* Luca Mosca as an Italian tailor who is responsible for fashion and body armor service in Hotel Continental\n* [[Tobias Segal]] as Earl, the Bowery King's \"homeless\" criminal\n* [[Thomas Sadoski]] as Jimmy, a police officer who is John Wick's friend\n* [[Chuk Iwuji]] as Mr. Akoni, who is in debt to or part of the High Table\n* [[Yamamotoyama Ry\u016bta]] as Rajah\n* [[Erik Frandsen]] as The Numismatic\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn February 2015, directors [[Chad Stahelski]] and [[David Leitch]] stated that a ''John Wick'' sequel had begun development.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Guerrasio|first1=Jason|title='John Wick' Directors Are Already Working on a Sequel (Exclusive)|url=http://www.movies.com/movie-news/john-wick-sequel/17849|access-date=October 27, 2015|publisher=[[Movies.com]]|date=February 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=John Wick Sequel Already In The Works|url=http://www.finalreel.co.uk/john-wick-sequel-in-the-works/|publisher=Final Reel|date=February 5, 2015|access-date=October 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924013020/http://www.finalreel.co.uk/john-wick-sequel-in-the-works/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the same month, [[Jon Feltheimer]], CEO of [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], stated during a conference call that \"We see ''John Wick'' as a multiple-title action franchise\".

While very few of these customs are explicitly explained, there are still enough hints about the inner functionings of the various entities presented, giving us enough puzzle pieces to put together a loose sketch of this mysterious world of assassins\".<ref>Stephen M.
