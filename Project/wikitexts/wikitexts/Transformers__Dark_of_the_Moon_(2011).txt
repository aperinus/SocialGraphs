It is the third installment in the live-action [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]], and is the sequel to ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Revenge of the Fallen]]'' (2009). It is also the first Transformers film in 3-D. The film stars [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Josh Duhamel]], [[John Turturro]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Kevin Dunn]], [[Julie White]], [[John Malkovich]], and [[Frances McDormand]]. Set four years after ''Revenge of the Fallen'', it shows the final days of the war between [[Autobot]]s and [[Decepticon]]s as they battle to possess powerful technology abandoned on the [[Moon]], in order to restore Cybertron on Earth. Returning Transformers include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Wheelie, Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, and Barricade.\n\nThe script was written by [[Ehren Kruger]]. ''Dark of the Moon'' employed both regular [[35 mm movie film|35 mm film]] cameras and specially-developed [[3-D film|3-D]] cameras, with filming locations in [[Chicago]], [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Milwaukee]], Moscow, and Washington, D.C. The film was [[3D rendering|3-D rendered]] specifically for 3-D, and the visual effects involved more complex robots which took longer to render. ''Dark of the Moon''{{'s}} release date was moved from July 1 to June 29, in order to monitor an early response to footage.\n\nExclusive early premieres in both [[RealD Cinema|RealD 3-D]] and [[IMAX|IMAX 3-D]] theaters took place on June 28, 2011, one night before worldwide release in 2-D and 3-D (including [[IMAX|IMAX 3-D]]) formats each featuring [[Dolby Surround 7.1]] surround sound. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the film's visuals and action sequences, while criticizing the length, performances and writing.<ref name=\"tomatoes\" /> ''Dark of the Moon'' grossed $1.124 billion worldwide, and it was the [[List of highest-grossing films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

Please do NOT adjust!--> highest-grossing film of all time]] and the [[2011 in film#Highest-grossing films|second highest-grossing film of 2011]]. Like the [[Transformers (film)|first film]], it was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] at the [[84th Academy Awards]]. The sequel, ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Age of Extinction]]'', was released in June 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn 1961, the ''Ark'', a Cybertronian spacecraft carrying an invention capable of ending the war between the [[Autobot]]s and the [[Decepticon]]s, crash lands on the [[Far side of the Moon|dark side of Earth's Moon]]. The crash is detected on Earth by [[NASA]], and President [[John F. Kennedy]] authorizes a mission to put a man on the [[Moon]] as a cover for investigating the spacecraft. In 1969, the crew of [[Apollo 11]] lands on the Moon and secretly inspect the Ark before heading home. President [[Richard Nixon]] orders them to keep the details of this mission secret.\n\n<!-- DO NOT CHANGE, SEE TALK -->In the present day, four years after Egypt,<!-- DO NOT CHANGE, SEE TALK -->{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2009 film ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.}} the Autobots assist the humans in preventing major conflicts. During a mission to the site of the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] in [[Ukraine]] to investigate suspected alien technology, the Autobots are attacked by Decepticon scientist [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] and his giant worm Driller. After the two escape, [[Optimus Prime]] discovers that the technology is a fuel cell from the ''Ark'', thought to have been lost after escaping Cybertron. After learning of the top-secret mission to the Moon, the Autobots travel there and discover Sentinel Prime\u2014Optimus's predecessor as leader of the Autobots\u2014in a comatose state, as well as five Pillars he created as a means of establishing a \"Space Bridge\", which is a [[wormhole]] that can be used to teleport matter between two points. Upon returning to Earth, Optimus uses the energy of the [[Matrix of Leadership]] to revive Sentinel Prime.\n\nMeanwhile, [[List of Transformers film series characters|Sam Witwicky]] lives with his new girlfriend, [[Carly Witwicky|Carly Spencer]] but is unable to work with the Autobots or find a job. After Sam finds a job, his co-worker, Jerry Wang provides him information about the ''Ark'', before Jerry is assassinated by the Decepticon [[List of The Transformers (TV series) characters|Laserbeak]]. Sam contacts Seymour Simmons, and they realize the Decepticons are murdering people connected to the American and Soviet space missions to the ''Ark''. They locate two surviving cosmonauts, who reveal satellite photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. Sam realizes that the Decepticons raided the ''Ark'' long before the Apollo 11 mission and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars for the Autobots to find, as they know that Sentinel is the key to activating the Pillars. The Autobots fight off the pursuing Decepticons and rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection, but Sentinel betrays them and kills Ironhide, revealing that he had made a deal with [[Megatron]] to ensure Cybertron's survival.\n\nSentinel uses the Pillars to transport hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. [[List of Transformers film series cast and characters|Dylan Gould]], Carly's boss, is revealed to be working with the Decepticons after he captures Carly with the help of [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], who had been masquerading as a [[Mercedes SLS AMG]] he gifted to Carly. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons, but as their ship leaves Earth, it is destroyed by [[Starscream]], seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons invade [[Chicago]] as they place Pillars around the world to begin transporting their homeworld Cybertron to the Solar System, and then use Earth's resources to rebuild their world, including humans, who will be used as [[slave labor]]. Sam teams up with former soldier Robert Epps to go into Chicago to save Carly and arrest Dylan, but they are nearly killed by the Decepticons before the Autobots intervene, revealing that the Autobots concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.\n \nThe Autobots, along with NEST teams and [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]], manage to rescue Carly and begin fighting off the Decepticons. Soundwave and the Decepticons temporarily incapacitate and capture a few Autobots, killing Que. However, the miniature Autobots Wheelie and Brains sabotage a Decepticon ship, creating a distraction and allowing the Autobots to escape, with Bumblebee killing Soundwave in the process. Many other Decepticons, including Laserbeak, the Driller, Starscream, and Shockwave, are killed in the battle.\n\nSam fights Dylan and knocks him into the Pillar, electrocuting and killing him. [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] and Ratchet destroy the Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to be destroyed after being imploded. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron that he will be replaced by Sentinel as the leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel gains the upper hand against Optimus but is incapacitated by Megatron, who is determined to regain his leadership. Megatron then falsely offers a truce, but Optimus refuses to accept his surrender and decapitates him. Optimus then executes Sentinel with Megatron's shotgun for betraying his own teachings. Carly and Sam are reunited, and the Autobots remain on Earth as their permanent home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Transformers film series cast and characters}}\n\n===Humans===\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Sam Witwicky: A recent college graduate who is once again tied to the fate of Earth's survival.\n* [[Josh Duhamel]] as [[Colonel]] William Lennox: A  U.S. Army Special Forces officer who commands the classified strike team NEST, an international joint task-force battling Decepticons with the Autobots.\n* [[John Turturro]] as Seymour Simmons: Former agent in charge of the terminated Sector 7 unit and now a successful professional writer.\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as Retired U.S. Air Force Chief Master Sergeant Robert Epps: The former NCO-in-Charge of the NEST strike team who now works at [[Kennedy Space Center]].\n* [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]] as [[Carly Witwicky|Carly Spencer]]: Sam's new girlfriend.\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Dylan Gould: A wealthy car collector and Carly's employer who is secretly working with the Decepticons.\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Ron Witwicky: Sam's father.\n* [[Julie White]] as Judy Witwicky: Sam's mother.\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Bruce Brazos: Sam's employer and boss at Accuretta Systems.\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Charlotte Mearing: The [[Director of National Intelligence]].\n* [[Keiko Agena]] as the aide and assistant of Charlotte Mearing.\n* [[Lester Speight]] as \"Hardcore\" Eddie: A former member of NEST.\n* [[Josh Kelly (actor)|Josh Kelly]] as Stone, a former member of NEST.\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Dutch Gerhardt: Simmons' personal assistant.

ILM digital production supervisor Nigel Sumner explained: \"We did a lot of tests early on to figure out how to break the building apart, exploring a lot of the procedural options. A building that's 70 feet tall\u2014to go in and hand-score the geometry so when it fractures or falls apart\u2014would be a time-consuming, laborious process. The floor of a building may be made of concrete. How does concrete fracture when it tears apart? The pillars would be made of a similar material but made of rebar or other engineering components.

Farrar was always fascinated with the idea of shooting on location and then blending the film with Computer-generated imagery. He said: \"We try and shoot everything real. You may have seen some films recently where the entire city has been destroyed and it's entirely CGI. Well, for a ''Transformers'' film, it's different because we actually went to Chicago. If you start with the real thing, you have a lot more to work with to make it look real. So for a couple of months there, I was in a helicopter shooting aerial plates of the real buildings. And we'd add destruction to all the backgrounds \u2013 smoke, fire, debris, fighter planes, war, battles, torn up streets \u2013 to real cityscapes.\"<ref name=ILM3-D/> Four ILM employees also traveled to Chicago and photographed buildings from top to bottom at six different times of the day in order to create a digital model of the city to be used in certain scenes.<ref name=awn/> ILM's crew designed many major action scenes,<ref name=awn/> with many of the Chicago battle concepts coming from the helicopter shooting of the aerial plates.<ref name=ILMpanel/>\n\nAnimator Scott Benza said Sentinel Prime had a face \"more human-like than any of the other robots\", with a more complex frame and \"a greater number of plates\" so it could be more expressive.<ref name=awn/> ILM had based most of Sentinel Prime's features on [[Sean Connery]], and after Leonard Nimoy was cast to voice the role, the effects were altered to incorporate Nimoy's acting as well. Every robot would take approximately 30 weeks to build visually. Originally, the fight between Sentinel Prime, Optimus Prime, and Megatron was considered to be on water in the [[Chicago River]], but the budget was cut and ILM realized that they would not want to present that version of the final battle to Bay, so they decided to have the battle take place on the bridge over the river.<ref name=ILMpanel/> For a sequence where Bumblebee catches Sam and Lennox while transforming in mid-air, a digital double of Shia LaBeouf was combined with footage of the actor in high speed so that the effects team could time it for slow-motion.<ref name=ILM3-D/>\n\nSince Bay shoots all his films in [[anamorphic]] format, ''Dark of the Moon''{{'s}} representation would be \"squeezed in\" to distort the image, and ILM would add in the robots and \"un-distort\" the image.<ref name=ILMpanel/> The ample variety of filming formats used\u2014single camera, 3-D [[Stereoscopy|stereo]] rigs with two cameras, anamorphic and [[spherical lens]]es\u2014proved a challenge, especially as ILM had a deadline to deliver the 3-D plates to the companies responsible for the 3-D conversion.<ref name=awn/> ILM made 600 3-D shots, and Digital Domain had under 200,<ref name=ILMpanel/> while Legend3-D, the lead 3-D conversion company of the film, completed 78 minutes of work on the film and finalized the work of approximately 40 minutes of challenging non-visual effects and 38 minutes of visual effects shots.<ref name=Legend3-D>{{cite web|url=http://www.legend3D.com/film/transformers-dark-moon|title=Transformers: Dark of the Moon in Legend 3-D|date=July 1, 2011|access-date=July 30, 2011|publisher=Legend3-D|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130127180204/http://legend3d.com/film/transformers-dark-moon |archive-date=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{see also|Transformers: Dark of the Moon \u2013 The Album|Transformers: Dark of the Moon \u2013 The Score}}\n{{listen\n| filename= StevejablonskyDOTM.ogg\n| title= Steve Jablonsky \u2013 \"It's Our Fight\"\n| description= A 27 second sample of Steve Jablonsky's \"It's Our Fight\".
