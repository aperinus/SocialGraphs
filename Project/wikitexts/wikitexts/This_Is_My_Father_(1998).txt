Kieran Johnson grew into adulthood unaware of his parents' story or of the tragic events that caused his mother to leave Ireland on her own while [[pregnancy|pregnant]].\n\nThe story highlights the issues of [[prejudice]], [[classism]], [[alcoholism]] and social and [[religion|religious]] conservatism in rural 1930s Ireland.\n\n==Cast==\n'''Main cast'''\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Kieran O'Dea\n* [[James Caan]] as Kieran Johnson\n* Moya Farrelly as Fiona Flynn\n* [[Jacob Tierney]] as Jack\n* [[Gina Moxley]] as Widow Flynn\n\n'''Supporting Cast'''\n* [[Colm Meaney]] as Seamus (Bed and Breakfast Owner)\n* [[Moira Deady]] as Mrs. Kearney\n* [[John Cusack]] as Eddie Sharp (Pilot)\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Garda Jim\n* [[Pat Shortt]] as Garda Ben\n* Maria McDermottroe as Mrs. Maney\n* [[Donal Donnelly]] as John Maney\n* [[Eamon Morrissey (actor)|Eamon Morrissey]] as Father Mooney\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Mission Priest\n* [[John Kavanagh (actor)|John Kavanagh]] as Liam Finneran \n* Karen Ardiff as Young Mrs. Kearney\n* Sheila Flitton as Mrs. Madigan\n* Pauline Hutton as Maria\n* [[Fiona Glascott]] as Nuala\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]] given the film 3 out of 4 stars and compared it to his own visit to Ireland in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/this-is-my-father-1999|author=[[Roger Ebert]]|title=This Is My Father|accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0120865}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|this_is_my_father}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:Canadian romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:Irish romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:English-language Irish films]]\n[[Category:1998 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]\n\n\n{{Ireland-film-stub}}\n{{1990s-romantic-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
