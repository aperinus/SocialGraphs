It takes place 17 years after [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s 111th birthday party and just before [[Frodo Baggins]] leaves the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] for [[Rivendell]] (an interval which was not outlined in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|motion picture based on that story]]).  The wizard [[Gandalf]] fears that [[Gollum]] may reveal information about the [[One Ring]] to the [[Dark Lord of Mordor|Dark Lord]] [[Sauron]], and sends the Ranger [[Aragorn]], heir of [[Isildur]], on a quest to find him.\n\nThe story opens with a brief prologue about the ring's disappearance before cutting to Aragorn (Adrian Webster) and Gandalf (Patrick O'Connor) at an inn (presumably the [[Prancing Pony]]) in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf explains his concerns about Gollum's knowledge of the Ring falling into enemy hands, and asks Aragorn to find the creature with his tracking skills. After initially having little luck, Aragorn crosses paths with a fellow ranger and distant kinsman named Arithir (Arin Alldridge), a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger of the North]], who reports hearing rumours about a creature that has been stealing fish from open windows in local villages; the movie cuts to a scene of Gollum doing just that, and eating his ill-gotten gain atop the roof.\n\nAragorn and Arithir part ways, and Aragorn encounters and kills a pair of [[orc]] scouts in the forest. He soon locates Gollum by a fish pond afterwards and captures the creature in a [[snare trap]]. Having secured the whining and protesting Gollum inside a sack, Aragorn sets out for [[Mirkwood]]. On the way, he briefly spots one of the nine [[Nazg\u00fbl|Ringwraiths]] in the woods, but avoids it. Later that same day, he is attacked by an orc [[squad]] and defeats them, but is hit by a poison dart which takes effect after he dispatches his last attacker. He collapses beside a patch of Athelas flowers and has a [[hallucination|vision]] of [[Arwen]] (Rita Ramnani) in [[Rivendell]].\n\nAragorn regains consciousness at dusk and discovers that Gollum has escaped from the sack. He seeks the creature well into the night, but finally finds him hiding up in a tree. Gollum fearfully explains that a Ringwraith is coming&nbsp;\u2014 seconds later, a Ringwraith indeed does appear and attacks Aragorn. After a short but intense duel, the Ringwraith flees from a bright light created by the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of Mirkwood, who recapture Gollum and guide Aragorn back to their fortress.\n\nThe scene cuts to Gandalf emerging from Mirkwood's dungeons after interrogating Gollum. Gandalf tells Aragorn that Gollum knows of [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]], and explains that he must now go there to warn Frodo. Aragorn suggests sending Frodo to meet him in Bree, and Gandalf readily agrees. The film ends with Gollum speaking to himself in the dungeon, where he vows to kill \"Bagginses\" and reclaim his \"Precious\".\n\n==Cast==\n*Adrian Webster as [[Aragorn|Aragorn II Elessar]], a [[D\u00fanedain]] [[Ranger (Middle-earth)|ranger]], the descendant of Isildur, and heir to [[Gondor]]'s throne.
