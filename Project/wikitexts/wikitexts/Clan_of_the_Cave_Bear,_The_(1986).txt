Auel]]. The film stars [[Daryl Hannah]], [[Pamela Reed]], [[James Remar]], and [[Thomas G. Waites]].\n\nBased on [[The Clan of the Cave Bear|the novel of the same name]], a young [[Cro-Magnon]] woman named [[Ayla (Earth's Children)|Ayla]] ([[Daryl Hannah]]) is separated from her family and orphaned during an earthquake. She is found by a group of [[Neanderthals]] and raised as one of their own.  Unfortunately, as the years go by, her own intelligence causes disaster for the entire tribe, especially its future chief, Broud ([[Thomas G. Waites]]).\n\nDialogue is conducted mostly through a form of sign language which is translated for the audience with [[subtitles]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter losing her mother in an [[earthquake]] in [[Paleolithic Europe]], 5-year-old [[Cro-Magnon]] Ayla (Emma Floria) is left alone in the woods. She then \nsuffers a severe injury to her legs from a nearby [[Panthera spelaea|cave lion]]. After suffering from starvation, exhaustion, and infection of her wounds, she collapses, on the verge of death. She is rescued by Iza ([[Pamela Reed]]), the healer of a group of [[Neanderthal]]s who call themselves \"The Clan\", against the orders for her to be left to die by the clan's chief, Brun (John Doolittle), because she is clearly a member of \"the Others\", the distrusted antagonists of the Clan. Brun refuses to accept Ayla when Iza adopts her, only allowing her to stay with the Clan because Iza refuses to abandon her. The Clan calls her \"Ayla\", the closest they can come to pronouncing her birth name.\n\nThrough meditation, Iza's brother, Creb (the group's [[shaman]]), comes to believe that the child may be protected by the spirit of the cave lion, a powerful \"totem\" that is never given to a woman and very few men. He cites the cave lion attack the girl experienced shortly before being discovered as proof that its spirit marked her so that she could be adopted into the Clan. After traveling with them for a while and starting to heal, Ayla wanders away from the group when they stop to discuss what they should do and she discovers a huge, beautiful cave, perfect for their needs; many of the people begin to regard Ayla as lucky, especially since good fortune continues to come their way as they begin to accept her in the fold.\n\nAyla's different thought processes lead her to break important Clan customs, particularly the [[taboo]] against females handling weapons. She is self-willed and spirited, but tries hard to fit in with the Neanderthals, although she has to learn everything first-hand; she does not possess the ancestral memories of the Clan which enable them to do certain tasks after being shown only once.\n\nIza trains Ayla as a [[Medicine man|medicine woman]] \"of her line\", the most prestigious line of medicine women out of all of the Clans. It takes her much longer to train Ayla than it will her own daughter, Uba ([[Lycia Naff]]), since Ayla does not possess the memories of the Clan. Iza is concerned that when Ayla grows up nobody will want her as their mate, making her a burden to the Clan. So she trains Ayla to be a highly respected medicine woman who will have her own \"status\" and will not have to rely on the status of a mate.\n\nMeanwhile, Broud ([[Joey Cramer]]), the son of Brun, disdains Ayla and when they both reach adulthood, Broud ([[Thomas G. Waites]]) brutally rapes Ayla ([[Daryl Hannah]]) in an impulsive bid to demonstrate his control over her. Broud continues to assault Ayla multiple times daily leaving her despondent, and she soon becomes pregnant. Iza explains to Ayla that her unusual appearance compared to the rest of the Clan will likely preclude her from obtaining a mate before she gives birth, a circumstance Iza's people believe will bring bad luck to their settlement. Ayla witnesses Broud trying to master a ((slingshot)) with no success, she then takes it and soon becomes skilled with it. The clan are then attacked by a pack of wolves and Ayla saves a child from being killed with the slingshot, the clan then decide to banish her from their settlement, she finds shelter in another cave. Following a difficult pregnancy and a near-fatal labor, Ayla rejoices in the birth of a son but, due to his appearance being an [[Interbreeding between archaic and modern humans|amalgamation of Clan and Other features]], he is considered deformed and almost taken away from her, but because she has proven to have survived on her own and be a skilled hunter, she is allowed to keep him, and is given the name Durc.\n\nAfter Iza's death, Broud is named chief by Brun. Broud's first order is to take Ayla for himself and separate her from her son, giving him to another couple, and he also exiles the already elderly Creb as there's another shaman in charge. Ayla opposes and fights Broud, defeating him. Thus a humiliated Broud agrees to keep Creb with the clan, but Ayla still chooses to leave, saying goodbye to her son, in search of her own people.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as [[Ayla (Earth's Children)|Ayla]]\n* [[Pamela Reed]] as Iza\n* [[James Remar]] as Creb\n* [[Thomas G.
