It is based on the book of the same name by [[Eric Williams (writer)|Eric Williams]], who also wrote the screenplay.<ref>Williams, Eric, ''The Wooden Horse'' (Collins, 1949)</ref>\n\nThe film depicts the true events of [[Stalag Luft III#First escape (1943)|an escape attempt]] made by [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] in the German prison camp Stalag Luft III. The wooden horse in the title of the film is a piece of exercise equipment the prisoners use to conceal their escape attempt as well as a reference to the [[Trojan Horse]] which was also used to conceal men within.\n\n''The Wooden Horse'' was shot in a low-key style, with a limited budget and a cast including many amateur actors.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|1=section|date=January 2022}}\nThe somewhat fictionalised version of the true story is set in [[Stalag Luft III]] \u2014 the same [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp where the real events depicted in the film ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' took place, albeit from a different compound \u2013 and involved Williams, [[Michael Codner]] and [[Oliver Philpot]], all inmates of the camp. In the book and film, the escapees are renamed \"Flight Lieutenant Peter Howard\", \"Captain John Clinton\" and \"Philip Rowe\".\n\nThe prisoners are faced with the problem of digging an escape tunnel despite the accommodation huts, within which the tunnel entrance might be concealed, being a considerable distance from the [[perimeter fence]]. They come up with an ingenious way of digging the tunnel with its entrance located in the middle of an open area relatively near the perimeter fence and using a [[vault (gymnastics)|vaulting horse]] (constructed largely from plywood from Canadian [[Red Cross]] parcels), to cover the entrance.\n\nRecruiting fellow-prisoners to form a team of vaulters, each day they carry the horse out to the same spot, with a man hidden inside. The prisoners begin [[gymnastics|gymnastic]] exercises using the vaulting horse, while the concealed man digs down below it. At the end of the session, the digger places wooden boards, cut to fit the aperture, in the hole, and fills the space with sandbags and dry sand kept for the purpose \u2013 wet sand taken from below the surface would be darker and hence give away the tunneling activity.\n\nAs the tunnel lengthens, two men are eventually hidden inside the horse while a larger group of men exercise, the two men continue to dig the tunnel. At the end of the day, they conceal the tunnel entrance once more and hide inside the horse while it is carried back to their hut. They also devise a method of disposing of the earth coming out of the tunnel. They recruit a third man, Phil, to assist them, with the promise that he will join the escape.\n\nAt the final break-out, Clinton hides in the tunnel during an ''Appell'' (roll call), before three men are carried out in the horse: the third to replace the tunnel trap.\n\nHoward and Clinton travel by train to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] port of [[L\u00fcbeck]]; (in fact, they travelled via [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] to Stettin). Phil elects to travel alone, posing as a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[margarine]] salesman and travelling by train via [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (now [[Gda\u0144sk]]). He was the first to get to neutral territory.\n\nOn the docks Howard and Clinton are forced to kill a German sentry who surprised the hiding men;<ref>In the book the two POWS are forced to kill a German sentry who surprised them as they tried to cross the German/Denmark border</ref> and they contact French workers, through which they meet \"Sigmund\", a [[Denmark|Danish]] resistance worker who smuggles them onto a Danish ship. They then have to transfer to a fishing boat and arrive in [[Copenhagen]], before being shipped to neutral [[Sweden]]. There they are reunited with Phil, who arrived earlier.\n\nSome details from Williams' book were not used in the film, e.g. the escaped POWs discussing the possibility of visiting potentially neutral brothels in Germany, an idea that was abandoned because of the fear that it might be a trap.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Leo Genn]] as Peter Howard\n* [[David Tomlinson]] as Philip Rowe\n* [[Anthony Steel (actor)|Anthony Steel]] as John Clinton\n* [[David Greene (director)|David Greene]] as Bennett\n* [[Peter Burton]] as Nigel\n* [[Patrick Waddington]] as the Senior British Officer\n* [[Michael Goodliffe]] as Robbie\n* [[Anthony Dawson]] as Pomfret\n* [[Bryan Forbes]] as Paul\n* [[Dan Cunningham]] as David\n* [[Peter Finch]] as the Australian in hospital\n* Philip Dale as Bill White\n* [[Russell Waters]] as 'Wings' Cameron\n* Ralph Ward as the Adjutant\n* [[Lis L\u00f8wert]] as Kamma\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a book by Eric Williams which was published in 1949.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18466209 |title=The Wooden Horse |newspaper=[[The Sunday Herald (Sydney)]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 April 1949 |access-date=27 June 2020 |page=1 (Novel) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18466532 |title=The Wooden Horse |newspaper=[[The Sunday Herald (Sydney)]] |issue=13 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=17 April 1949 |access-date=27 June 2020 |page=1 (Novel) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>  The book was re-issued in 1980.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article137009514 |title='GREATEST ESCAPE' |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=55 |issue=16,186 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=19 January 1980 |access-date=27 June 2020 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIan Dalrymple and Jack Lee read the book and bought the film rights.
