Soraya has two sons whom Ali wants. After a woman dies, Ali asks Zahra to persuade Soraya to care for the woman's now-widowed husband. Soraya starts working for the widower, and Ali uses this situation to spread lies that Soraya is being unfaithful to him so that she will be stoned and he can remarry. Ali knows if Soraya were dead, he would not have to pay [[child support]] either. Ali and the mullah start a rumor about her [[infidelity]] so they can charge her with [[adultery]]. They need one more witness to her \"infidelity\" to be able to formally charge her. They manipulate and threaten the widower into backing up their story. Ali then drags Soraya through the streets, beating her and publicly declaring that she has been unfaithful. Zahra intervenes, and takes her niece, Ali, and the mayor to talk privately. They bring the widower to the home, and, after he lies as instructed, a trial is pursued. Only men, including Soraya's father, are allowed while Soraya is confined in Zahra's house. She is quickly convicted. Zahra tries to flee with her and after realizing she cannot, pleads with the mayor for her life, even offering to switch places with Soraya. The conviction is upheld.\n\nSoraya's father is given the first stone to throw, but he misses her repeatedly. A woman in the crowd pleads to the mayor that the stones missing are a sign that Soraya is innocent, but none of the men listen. Ali takes up stones and throws them himself. Her two sons are also forced to throw stones.<ref name=\"screenrant\" /><ref name=\"catholicnews\" /> The widower is given stones as well but instead walks away in tears. The crowd finally joins in and Soraya is stoned to death.\n\nIn the present, the widower informs the journalist that his car is fixed. The mullah and the widower are informed by Ali that his marriage to the teenage girl is off, implying that he could not spare her father from execution. Angry at Ali and the mullah, the widower admits that he lied. As the journalist attempts to leave, the mullah orders a [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guard]] to stop him at gunpoint. They seize his tape recorder and destroy the tapes. Zahra then appears with the true tape in her hand. Men attempt to run after the car as the journalist drives away and escapes. Zahra triumphantly declares that now the whole world will know of the injustice that has happened.<ref name=\"screenrant\" /><ref name=\"catholicnews\" />\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mozhan Marn\u00f2]] as [[Soraya Manutchehri]]\n* [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] as Zahra\n* [[James Caviezel|Jim Caviezel]] as [[Freidoune Sahebjam]]\n* [[Parviz Sayyad]] as Hashem\n* [[Vida Ghahremani]] as Mrs. Massoud\n* [[Navid Negahban]] as Ali\n* Vachik Mangassarian as Morteza Ramazani, Soraya's father\n* Bita Sheibani as Leila\n* [[Noor Taher]] as Kataneh\n* David Diaan as Ebrahim, the mayor\n* Ali Pourtash as the mullah\n* Laila Qutub as Mehri, the 14-year-old girl\n\n==Book==\nThe international best-seller book tells the story of one of the victims of [[stoning]] in modern Iran.<ref name=\"neurope\">{{cite web|url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/iran-death-penalty-stoning|title=Iran Death penalty by stoning|website=New Europe|date=March 28, 2013|access-date=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/08/iran-death-stoning-adultery|title=Iranians still facing death by stoning despite 'reprieve'|website=The Guardian|date=July 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"iran-e-azad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-e-azad.org/stoning/|title=Stoning to Death in Iran: A Crime Against Humanity Carried Out By the Mullahs' Regime}}</ref>\n\nSoraya Manutchehri's husband Ghorban-Ali was an ambitious man, prone to fits of rage.
