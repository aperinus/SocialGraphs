It is based on the 1994 novel ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'' by [[Louis de Berni\u00e8res]]. The film pays homage to the thousands of Italian soldiers executed at the [[Massacre of the Acqui Division]] by German forces in [[Cephalonia]] in September 1943, and to the people of Cephalonia who were killed in the post-war earthquake. The novel's protagonists are portrayed by actors [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]].\n\n==Plot==\nGreece's [[Ionian Islands]] are [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied]] by the [[Royal Italian Army|Italian Army]] when it brings a large [[garrison]] along with a few Germans to the tranquil island of [[Cephalonia]], whose inhabitants surrender immediately. Captain Antonio Corelli, an officer of the Italian [[33rd Mountain Infantry Division Acqui|33rd Acqui Infantry Division]], has a jovial personality and a passion for the [[mandolin]], and trains his battery of men (who have never fired a shot) to [[choir|choral sing]]. Initially he alienates a number of villagers, including Pelagia, the daughter of the village doctor. She is an educated and strong-willed woman. At first offended by the Italian soldier's behaviour, she slowly warms to Corelli's charm, and mandolin playing, as they are forced to share her father's home after the doctor agrees to put him up in exchange for medical supplies.\n\nWhen Pelagia's fianc\u00e9, Mandras, a local fisherman, heads off to war on the mainland, the friendship between Antonio and Pelagia grows. Her beauty and intelligence have captured Corelli's heart, and his fondness for the village's vibrant community has caused him to question his reasons for fighting. Corelli, and his battery of musical troops, becomes a part of the villagers' lives; but the moment is fleeting. As the war grows closer, Antonio and Pelagia are forced to choose between their allegiances and the love they feel for one another.\n\n[[Armistice of Cassibile|The Italian government surrenders to the Allies]], and the Italian troops happily prepare to return home. However, their erstwhile allies, the Germans, insist on disarming them, intemperately and violently. The Greeks are also exposed to the brutality of the incoming Germans, and arrange with the Italians to use their arms in a brief but futile resistance. For this, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] has thousands of the Italian troops [[Massacre of the Acqui Division|shot as traitors]]. Corelli survives when one of his soldiers shields him from the fusillade of the German executioners' bullets with his body, and falls dead on top of him.  Mandras finds Corelli, still alive among the pile of massacred soldiers, and takes him to Pelagia and the doctor for treatment and recovery, and then to a boat to escape the island. As a result of Pelagia's questioning, Mandras admits that he rescued Corelli from the heap of dead soldiers because he wanted to re-kindle their love. But it does no good and the couple part. Earlier, on one of Mandras's return visits to Cephallonia, he admits to Pelagia that the reason he never replied to her many love letters is that he is illiterate.\n\nIn 1947, Pelagia receives a parcel from Italy containing a record of the tune Corelli wrote for her, but no note. An [[1953 Ionian earthquake|earthquake]] destroys much of the village including the doctor's house; but island life continues, and, soon after, Corelli returns to Pelagia.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Captain Antonio Corelli\n* [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] as Pelagia\n* [[John Hurt]] as Dr. Yiannis\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Mandras\n* [[David Morrissey]] as Captain G\u00fcnther Weber\n* [[Irene Papas]] as Drosoula\n* Piero Maggio as Carlo\n* [[Gerasimos Skiadaressis]] as Mr. Stamatis\n* Aspasia Kralli as Mrs. Stamatis\n* [[Michael Yannatos]] as Kokolios\n* Dimitris Kaberidis as Father Arsenios\n* Pietro Sarubbi as Velisarios, The Strongman\n* Viki Maragaki as Eleni, Pelagia's friend\n* Joanna-Daria Adraktas as Young Lemoni\n* Ira Tavlaridis as Older Lemoni\n* [[Katerina Didaskalou]] as Lemoni's mother\n* Emilios Chilakis as Dimitris\n* Panagis Polichronatos as Partisan\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Colonel Johannes Barge\n* George Kotanidis as Mayor\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $13.8 million in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=7|date=24 December 2001|title=Homegrown pix gain in Europe|last=Dawtrey|first=Adam}}</ref> The film opened at number six at the US box office, taking in $7,209,345 in its opening weekend and went on to gross $25,543,895 in the United States and Canada.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 28% based on reviews from 117 critics, with an average rating of 4.45/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"The cinematography is gorgeous, but the movie plays it fast and loose with history and the novel it was adapted from. Mostly, the movie fails because the romance between the leads strains credulity and the story is largely uninvolving.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_corellis_mandolin/ |title=Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=2020-10-10 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 36 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/captain-corellis-mandolin |title=Captain Corelli's Mandolin Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=March 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Derek Elley]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the beautiful on location shoot, but was critical of the film and wrote that it \"Strikes too many false notes on the dramatic side to add up to a satisfying emotional experience.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=24 April 2001 |last=Elley |first=Derek |title=Captain Corelli's Mandolin |url=https://variety.com/review/VE1117797870 |website=Variety }}</ref>\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 2 out of 4, and suggested the film might have worked better with subtitles, pointing out the absurdity of one scene \"where something is said in English pronounced with one accent, and a character asks, ''What did he say?'' and he is told -- in English pronounced with another accent.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=August 17, 2001 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |title=Captain Corelli's Mandolin movie review (2001) |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/captain-corellis-mandolin-2001 |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Tibbetts, John C., and James M.
