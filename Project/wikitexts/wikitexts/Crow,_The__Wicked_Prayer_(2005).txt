It is the fourth installment of [[The Crow (franchise)|''The Crow'' film series]]. The film was filmed in the summer of 2003. It had a one-week theatrical premiere on June 3, 2005 at AMC Pacific Place Theatre in [[Seattle, Washington]] before being released to video on July 19, 2005. Like the other sequels to the [[cult film]] ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', it had a poor critical reception.\n\n==Plot==\nJames \"Jimmy\" Cuervo, paroled after serving a prison sentence for killing a [[rape|rapist]] in a fight, lives with his dog in a [[mobile home]] in Lake Ravasu on the Raven [[Aztec]] [[Indian reservation|reservation]]. Jimmy plans to start a new life with his girlfriend, Lily, and permanently leave the town, but her father, pastor Harold, and brother, local cop Tanner, both despise Jimmy.\n\nThe town is home to a [[Satanism|Satanic]] biker gang led by escaped convict Luc \"Death\" Crash and his fianc\u00e9e Lola Byrne. Along with their three confederates \"Pestilence\", \"Famine\" and \"War\", Luc and Lola murder the pair in a brutal ritual that they hope will reawaken the [[Antichrist]], which includes removing Lily's eyes \u2014 bestowing [[precognition|precognitive]] powers upon Lola \u2014 and Jimmy's heart. They dump the bodies inside an old freezer.\n\nThe Crow then appears and revives Jimmy, who discovers his newfound invincibility after attempting to shoot himself. He takes Lily's body and leaves it on her bed so it can be found. Tanner and Harold find the body and assume Jimmy killed Lily.\n\nOn the night of a local festivity, Jimmy dons a [[Goth fashion|gothic]] costume and make-up he wore to the celebration a previous year. He finds and kills Pestilence in a bar. He then seizes the hearse carrying Lily's body, and buries her near the tree where he carved a love symbol for them both. Jimmy goes to a casino and kills Famine in front of Luc. During an ensuing fight between Jimmy and Luc, the crow, Jimmy's power source, is injured, thereby weakening Jimmy. Tanner finds and accuses Jimmy of killing Lily, but Jimmy shows Tanner [[telepathy|telepathically]] what really happened.\n\nLuc and Lola visit El Ni\u00f1o, the head of their order, at a Catholic church which has been abandoned by Christians and has been modified for use by the satanic cult. Tanner and Harold and a group of men assemble outside to confront them. As El Ni\u00f1o is performing the marriage ceremony that will bring Luc closer to the power he craves, Jimmy, Tanner, Harold, and the other men arrive and shoot War. El Ni\u00f1o completes the ceremony as Jimmy enters the church. Luc, now a host for [[Lucifer]] himself [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] hangs Jimmy from a cross, while Lola kills El Ni\u00f1o. Luc and Lola leave the church and head to a nearby graveyard where they must consummate their ritual before sunrise in order for Lucifer to fully manifest.\n\nHarold, Tanner, and the others free Jimmy, who tells them the crow is dying. To heal the bird and restore Jimmy's powers, Harold performs the Crow Dance. Weakened, Jimmy heads to the graveyard and stops Luc from having sex with Lola. Luc and Jimmy engage in a fight and the revived crow returns, restoring Jimmy's invulnerability. The sun rises, halting Luc's ritual. Jimmy then kills Luc by impaling him on a wooden spike and cutting his throat. Lola loses her sight and unsuccessfully attempts repentance by praying to the [[Virgin Mary]], but it is too late; Harold apprehends her and takes her to prison. Jimmy and Lily's spirits find each other in the afterlife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as [[Crow (comics)#James .22Jimmy.22 Cuervo|James \"Jimmy\" Cuervo / The Crow]], A young man who served in prison for killing a rapist.
