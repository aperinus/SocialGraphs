A film adaptation of the 1885 [[King Solomon's Mines|novel of the same name]] by [[Henry Rider Haggard]], the film was produced by the [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont British Picture Corporation]] at [[Lime Grove Studios]] in [[Shepherd's Bush]]. Sets were designed by [[art director]] [[Alfred Junge]]. Of all the novel's adaptations, this film is considered to be the most faithful to the book.<ref>http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80378/King-Solomon-s-Mines/articles.html {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1882, Irish dream chaser Patrick \"Patsy\" O'Brien and his daughter Kathy have failed to strike it rich in the diamond mines of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]] (then the [[Cape Colony]]). They persuade a reluctant [[Allan Quatermain|Allan Quartermain]] to drive them to the coast in his wagon.\n\nAlong the way, they encounter another wagon carrying two men in bad shape. Umbopa recovers, but Silvestra Getto dies after boasting to Quartermain that he has found the way to the fabled mines of [[Solomon]]. Patsy finds the dead man's map and sneaks off during the night, unwilling to risk his daughter's life. Kathy is unable to persuade  Quartermain to follow him; instead, they rendezvous with Quartermain's new clients, Sir Henry Curtis and retired naval commander John Good, who are hunting for big game.\n\nKathy steals Quartermain's wagon to pursue her father. When they catch up with her, she refuses to return with them, so they and Umbopa accompany her across the desert and over the mountains shown on the map. During the arduous trek, Curtis and Kathy fall in love. On the other side of the mountains, they are surrounded by unfriendly natives and taken to the [[kraal]] of their chief Twala to be questioned. Twala takes them to see the entrance of the mines that are guarded by the feared [[witch doctor]] Gagool.\n\nThat night, Umbopa reveals that he is the son of the former chief who was treacherously killed by the usurper Twala. He meets with dissidents, led by Infadoos, who are fed up with Twala's cruel reign. Together, they plot an uprising for the next day during the ceremony of the \"smelling out of the evildoers.\" However, Umbopa needs Quartermain to devise a plan that the natives think will counter Gagool's magic.\n\nDuring the rite, Gagool chooses several natives who are killed on the spot. Recalling having made a bet on the previous year's [[Epsom Derby|Derby Day]], Good notices in his diary that there will be a total [[solar eclipse]] that day at exactly 11:15&nbsp;a.m. The quick-thinking Quartermain predicts the eclipse as Gagool approaches Umbopa. Umbopa reveals his true identity to the people during the height of the eclipse and the rebellion erupts. Both sides gather their forces, and during the ensuing battle, Curtis kills Twala, ending the civil war.\n\nIn the fighting, Kathy slips away to the mine to look for her father. She finds him inside, immobilised by a broken leg but clutching a pouch full of diamonds. Quartermain, Curtis and Good follow her, but Gagool sets off a rockfall to seal them in. Umbopa pursues Gagool back into the mine, where the witch doctor is crushed by falling rocks. The new chief manages to free his friends and gives them an escort to help them cross the desert.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Robeson]] as Umbopa\n* [[Cedric Hardwicke]] as [[Allan Quatermain|Allan Quartermain]] \n* [[Roland Young]] as Commander John Good\n* [[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]] as [[Sir Henry Curtis]]\n* [[Anna Lee]] as Kathy O'Brien\n* Arthur Sinclair as Patsy O'Brien\n* [[Robert Adams (actor)|Robert Adams]] as Twala\n* [[Arthur Goullet]] as Sylvestra Getto\n* Ecce Homo Toto as Infadoos\n* Makubalo Hlubi as Kapse\n* Mjujwa as Scragga\n* [[Sydney Fairbrother]] as Gagool (uncredited)\n* [[Frederick Leister]] as Diamond Buyer (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n[[Gaumont-British]] announced the film in 1935<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article204352397 |title=THEATRE and SCREEN |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=25,022 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=26 June 1935 |access-date=4 December 2017 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article234611930 |title=Through \"Smith's\" Private Projector |newspaper=[[Smith's Weekly]] |volume=XVII |issue=30 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=21 September 1935 |access-date=4 December 2017 |page=23 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and [[Paul Robeson]] was signed in 1936.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 August 1936|title=Features Of The Latest Shows|page=51 (FIRST EDITION)|newspaper=[[Weekly Times]]|issue=3592|location=Victoria, Australia|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article223872304|access-date=4 December 2017|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Filming began in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London in November 1936, and the unit then travelled to Africa for a further eight weeks of work.<ref>{{cite news|date=3 November 1936|title=Stage and Screen Personalities|page=9 (Women's Supplement)|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|issue=30,838|location=New South Wales, Australia|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17288648|access-date=4 December 2017|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Bennett (screenwriter)|Charles Bennett]] is credited as one of the writers, but he claimed that he \"didn't really\" contribute to the screenplay.
