[[Metallica v. Napster, Inc.|Their lawsuit against file sharing service Napster]] has caused a fan backlash, longtime bassist [[Jason Newsted]] has quit the group, and relations between the band members are at an all-time low. They are working with \"performance enhancement coach\" Phil Towle to deal with their growing tensions. Newsted says that singer and guitarist [[James Hetfield]] would not let him pursue his [[side project]], [[Echobrain]], and calls the band's decision to bring in a [[therapy|therapist]] \"really fucking lame and weak\".\n\nMetallica begins work on a new studio album, using an empty [[barracks]] at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] as a recording studio and drafting [[Bob Rock]], their longtime [[record producer]], to play bass on the recordings. The process is more collaborative than usual; songs are written from scratch in the studio, the members and Rock contributing equally to music and lyrics. \"[[Some Kind of Monster (song)|Some Kind of Monster]]\" and \"My World\" result from these sessions. Six weeks in, Hetfield and drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] have an argument during a recording session and Hetfield storms out. He enters [[drug rehabilitation]] to undergo treatment for [[alcoholism]] and other addictions, putting the album on hold. Ulrich previews some of the new recordings for [[Torben Ulrich|his father]], who says the new material \"doesn't cut it\".\n\nAfter three months without Hetfield, the band's future is in doubt. Ulrich, Rock, and guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] continue their sessions with Towle. Hammett, who has battled his own addictions in the past, retreats to his northern California ranch, hopeful that things will work out. As part of the therapy process, Ulrich meets with Metallica's original lead guitarist, [[Dave Mustaine]], who was fired from the band in 1983. Mustaine says that despite the success of his band [[Megadeth]], he has always felt second best to Metallica and carries a deep resentment toward them. Ulrich, Hammett, and Rock attend an Echobrain concert, after which Ulrich laments his inability to keep his own band together. As Hetfield's absence extends past six months, Metallica gives up their lease at the Presidio.\n\nIn April 2002, Hetfield exits rehab and returns to the band, whom resume recording at their new studio, \"HQ\", developing the song \"[[Frantic (song)|Frantic]]\". As part of his recovery, Hetfield may only work for four hours each day, and he asks that the others not work on, listen to, or even discuss recorded material without him present. Frustrated by these restrictions, Ulrich accuses Hetfield of being too controlling, culminating in an intense band meeting in which Ulrich vents his frustrations. The relationship between the two founding Metallica members becomes further strained while working on \"[[The Unnamed Feeling]]\". Hetfield reflects that his need to control the band stems from a fear of abandonment originating from his childhood. Hammett, who sees himself as a calm counterpoint to his bandmates' warring [[Id, ego and super-ego|egos]], is upset by their insistence on excluding [[guitar solo]]s from the album.\n\nThe band members bristle against their management's insistence that they record a [[promo (media)|promo]] for a radio contest, and their resentment informs the song \"Sweet Amber\". Their productivity increases, and Ulrich works his feelings about the Napster lawsuit into lyrics for \"Shoot Me Again\". While deciding which songs will make the album, the members feel that their chemistry has improved. They begin to reject Towle's methods and feel that he has insinuated himself too closely into the band. When they propose curtailing their relationship with him, Towle becomes defensive.\n\n[[File:Robert Trujillo Madrid 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Trujillo performing with Metallica in 2009. The film documents his audition with Metallica and hiring into the band.]]\nMetallica is chosen to be recognized and perform at the upcoming ''[[MTV Icon]]'' tribute show, accelerating their search for a new bassist. After auditioning several bassists from other bands, they select [[Robert Trujillo]], whose abilities impress them and whose finger-style playing reminds them of their early bassist, [[Cliff Burton]], who died in a tour bus accident in 1986. They choose ''[[St. Anger]]'' as the title for their new album, and film the music video for [[St. Anger (song)|the title track]] at [[San Quentin State Prison]].
