To prepare to work at [[MGM Studios]], she rises at 4:00{{nbsp}}a.m., scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling water before plunging her face into a bowl of [[witch hazel]] and ice to close the pores. Helga, a new maid, thinks Joan's living room is spotless, but Joan finds a detail she overlooked and loses her temper.\n\nJoan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt, but her career is on a downswing. Despite wanting a baby, she cannot get pregnant; seven pregnancies when she was married to actor [[Franchot Tone]] ended in miscarriages. When denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl, Christina, and then a boy, Christopher. Joan lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with birthday gifts, Joan allows her to choose just one to keep and donates the rest to charity.\n\nWhen Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan beats Christina in a swimming pool race and laughs at her; when Christina reacts angrily, Joan becomes enraged and locks the child in the pool house. Later, when Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her, she takes offense and cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to punish her.\n\nJoan resents Gregg's allegiance to studio boss [[Louis B. Mayer]]. Arguing with Gregg, she downs glasses of vodka and throws a drink in his face. When Gregg breaks up with her, she cuts him out of photos. When Mayer forces Joan to leave MGM after theater owners brand her \"[[box-office bomb|box-office poison]]\", she hacks down her prized rose garden with a pair of gardening shears and an ax.\n\nJoan finds Christina's expensive dresses hanging from [[clothes hanger|wire hanger]]s, which she despises and prohibits. Enraged, Joan yanks dresses from Christina's closet, throwing them all over her room, and beats Christina with the metal hanger as she squeals. Declaring that the sparkling clean bathroom floor is dirty, Joan throws cleaning powder all over it before striking Christina across the back with the can and wailing for someone to clean it.\n\nJoan sends Christina to [[Chadwick School]]. Years later, when a teenage Christina is caught kissing a boy, Joan brings her home. Barbara Bennett, a reporter from ''[[Redbook]]'', is there, writing a [[puff piece]] on Joan's home life. After Joan lies about Christina, saying she got expelled, Christina confronts her in front of the reporter. Joan slaps Christina twice in the face. The confrontation ends with Joan tackling Christina to the floor and choking her. Christina thrashes around helplessly until Joan's live-in assistant and the reporter pull her away.\n\nJoan sends Christina to [[Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy]], where she is allowed no contact with the outside world. Joan marries [[Alfred Nu Steele|Alfred Steele]], CEO of [[PepsiCo|Pepsi Cola]], moves to New York City, and pressures him to go into debt to fund their lavish lifestyle. After his death, the Pepsi board of directors tries to force her to resign, but Joan threatens to publicly badmouth the product if they do not let her retain her position.\n\nAfter graduating from Flintridge, Christina rents an apartment in [[Manhattan]], and is acting in a soap opera. When Christina is hospitalized for an [[ovarian tumor]], she is temporarily replaced on the show by her visibly drunk mother. Joan dies of cancer in 1977, and Christina and Christopher learn she has disinherited them both. Christopher says their mother has the last word, as usual; Christina says, \"Does she?\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Faye Dunaway]] as [[Joan Crawford]]\n* [[Diana Scarwid]] as [[Christina Crawford]] (adult)\n** [[Mara Hobel|Mara Hobel (Mara Boyd)]] as Christina Crawford (child)\n* [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]] as Gregg Savitt\n* [[Howard Da Silva]] as [[Louis B.

In securing the rights to the book, Christina's husband David Koontz was given an executive producer credit, though he had no experience producing films. Dunaway likewise demanded that her own husband,  photographer [[Terry O'Neill (photographer)|Terry O'Neill]], be given a producer credit so  he could advocate for her on set. According to Yablans, the two husbands jostled over Dunaway's portrayal of Crawford: \"I had two husbands to deal with, David driving me crazy that Faye was trying to sanitize Joan, and Terry worried we were pushing Faye too far and creating a monster.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/you_must_remember_this/2016/09/faye_dunaway_in_mommie_dearest_the_real_story.html | title=The Illusion of Perfection: A new diary tells the story of what happened when Faye Dunaway played Joan Crawford in Mommie Dearest. | author=Karina Longworth | publisher=Slate Magazine | date=2016-09-16 | access-date=2017-05-17 | archive-date=May 1, 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501011937/https://slate.com/culture/2016/09/the-illusion-of-perfection.html | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, actress [[Rutanya Alda]] (Carol Ann) published a behind-the-scenes memoir, detailing the making of the film, ''The Mommie Dearest Diary: Carol Ann Tells All''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/leon-acord/whats-the-most-shocking-t_b_8713984.html | title=What's the Most Shocking Thing About Tell-All 'Mommie Dearest Diary'? | author=Leon Acord | publisher=Huffington Post | date=2015-12-04 | access-date=2017-05-17 | archive-date=January 27, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127090252/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leon-acord/whats-the-most-shocking-t_b_8713984.html | url-status=live }}</ref> In it, she describes the difficulty of working with Dunaway, whose [[method acting|method]] approach to playing Joan seemed to absorb her and make her difficult to the cast and crew.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/you_must_remember_this/2016/09/faye_dunaway_in_mommie_dearest_the_real_story.html | title=The Illusion of Perfection:A new diary tells the story of what happened when Faye Dunaway played Joan Crawford in Mommie Dearest. | author=Karina Longworth | publisher=Slate Magazine | date=2016-09-16 | access-date=2017-05-17 | archive-date=May 30, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530211735/http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/you_must_remember_this/2016/09/faye_dunaway_in_mommie_dearest_the_real_story.html | url-status=live }}</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'', Alda stated, \"People despised Faye...because she was rude to people.
