It is based on [[Elmore Leonard]]'s [[1989 in literature|1989]] [[Killshot (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The story follows a couple who, despite being in a [[Witness Protection Program]], are being chased and confronted by the criminal they outed.\n\n==Plot==\nArmand Degas, a [[hitman]] known as \"Blackbird\", accidentally shoots his younger brother during a job. Years later, he is hired by a [[Cosa Nostra|Mafia]] boss to assassinate the man's father-in-law at a hotel, but also kills a witness. Visiting [[Walpole Island]], Blackbird crosses paths with Lionel, a fellow [[Native Americans in the United States|First Nations]] member, and notices Wayne Colson, a recently fired ironworker. Separated from his wife Carmen, Wayne collects some belongings from their house in [[Michigan]].\n\nUnable to collect his payment for the hotel murder, Blackbird learns the Mafia boss wants him dead for needlessly killing the witness. He meets Richie Nix, a volatile young criminal, and joins his scheme to extort Carmen's boss, Nelson Davies. Visiting Carmen's office to ask for a job, Wayne is mistaken for Davies by Richie and Blackbird. Richie demands the money at gunpoint, but Wayne fends them off, throwing Richie out a window. As Wayne and Carmen see Blackbird's face before he escapes with Richie, he vows to kill them.\n \t\nBlackbird recognizes Wayne from Walpole Island, where he and Richie press Lionel for Wayne's whereabouts before killing him. Staying at the home of Richie's girlfriend Donna, Blackbird and Richie arrive at the Colsons' house just as Wayne drives off. Richie takes off after him, and Carmen confronts Blackbird with Wayne's shotgun before locking herself inside and calling the police. Richie shoots at Wayne inside a convenience store but he escapes, and Richie kills the clerk. In the morning, the Colsons learn about Blackbird from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and are placed in [[Witness Protection]].\n \t\nRichie tricks Carmen's mother into revealing the Colsons have moved to Missouri. Carmen suspects the FBI is using them as bait to find the killers, but reconnects with Wayne in their new life together. Blackbird coerces the Mafia boss into digging up his brother's body and burning it in a car with another corpse to fake Blackbird and Richie's deaths. [[DNA]] from the body is tested against Blackbird's other incarcerated brother, proving they are related. With the FBI convinced the killers are dead, Wayne and Carmen are allowed to return home. Jealous of Donna's advances toward Blackbird, Richie shoots her before they leave to kill the Colsons.\n\nAfter admitting to Wayne that she is not sure their marriage will survive, Carmen returns home alone, finding Richie and Blackbird waiting. Richie torments Carmen, spraying her with buck lure, forcing her to stay in her underwear, and putting a bullet in her mouth which she spits onto the floor. Losing his patience after Richie antagonizes him about Donna, Blackbird shoots Richie dead. Emptying Richie's pistol, he allows Carmen upstairs to get dressed. She finds another of Wayne's shotguns, but Blackbird disarms her.\n \nWayne arrives, and realizes Carmen is being held hostage. He retrieves his [[shotgun]] from his truck as Blackbird bursts outside. They exchange fire and Wayne is hit, losing his gun. As Blackbird moves in for the killshot, he turns to see Carmen aiming Richie's gun, which he reminds her is empty, but remembers the bullet she spat out earlier. While Blackbird is distracted, Wayne crawls to his shotgun, and he and Carmen shoot Blackbird at the same time. Blackbird falls dead, as Carmen and Wayne embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Diane Lane]] as Carmen Colson\n* [[Thomas Jane]] as Wayne Colson\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Armand \"The Blackbird\" Degas\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Richie Nix\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Donna\n* [[Hal Holbrook]] as \"Papa\"\n* [[Don McManus]] as Nelson Davies\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Lenore\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\nThe [[film adaptation]] of the 1989 novel ''[[Killshot (novel)|Killshot]]'' by [[Elmore Leonard]] began development as early as May 1997 under [[Miramax Films]],<ref>{{cite news | author=Joseph Steuer | title=Miramax Slate Includes Gooding, Kidman, Silverstone | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=1997-05-13 }}</ref> which had optioned Leonard's novel.<ref name=five>{{cite news | author=Carole E.
