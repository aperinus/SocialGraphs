It follows [[Kyle Reese]], a soldier in a post-apocalyptic war against [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], who is sent from 2029 to 1984 to prevent [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]]'s death. When Kyle arrives in the past, he discovers that [[Alternate history|the timeline has been altered]] by Skynet and that Sarah has been raised by a reprogrammed Terminator sent to protect her.\n\nSequels for ''Terminator Salvation'' were cancelled after [[The Halcyon Company]] faced legal issues and filed for bankruptcy. [[Megan Ellison]] and her production company, [[Annapurna Pictures]], acquired the franchise rights in May 2011. Skydance Productions, owned by Ellison's brother [[David Ellison|David]], collaborated the following year on a production of another installment in the series. The Ellisons consulted ''Terminator'' creator [[James Cameron]] and drew inspiration from ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and its sequel ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991). Principal photography took place primarily in [[New Orleans]], but also in [[San Francisco]]. Six companies handled the film's [[visual effects]], with its prosthetic make-up and animatronics created by [[Legacy Effects]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood on June 28, 2015 and was released in the United States on July 1, 2015.

Before the Resistance can triumph, Skynet activates a time machine and sends a [[Terminator (character)|T-800/Model 101 Terminator]] back to 1984, to kill John's mother [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah]]. John's right-hand man, [[Kyle Reese]], volunteers to travel back in time to protect her. As Kyle floats in the machine's magnetic field, he sees John being attacked by another Resistance soldier. This creates a [[temporal paradox]] that alters the timeline and causes Kyle to experience childhood memories from a parallel version of himself.\n\nWhen it arrives in [[Los Angeles]] 1984, Skynet's T-800 is disabled by Sarah and \"Pops\", a reprogrammed T-800. An unknown party had sent Pops to 1973 to protect Sarah when she was nine years old after her parents were killed by a [[T-1000]] sent by Skynet. When Kyle arrives in 1984, he is intercepted by the T-1000, which Sarah and Pops destroy with acid. Sarah and Pops have constructed a makeshift time machine like Skynet's and Sarah plans to stop Skynet by traveling to 1997, the year it becomes self-aware. However, realizing that the timeline has been altered, Kyle is convinced that the future has also changed. He recalls a warning he received in his childhood vision, convincing Sarah that they instead must travel to 2017 to stop Skynet. After fighting the T-1000, Pops has sustained exterior damages that prevent him from time-traveling. He stays in 1984 and plans to meet up with Kyle and Sarah in the future, preparing for their arrival in the meantime.\n\nIn 2017, Kyle and Sarah materialize in the middle of a busy [[San Francisco]] highway and are apprehended by [[San Francisco Police Department|city police]]. While they are treated for injuries, Sarah and Kyle learn that Skynet is called \"Genisys\"\u2014a soon-to-be-unveiled global [[operating system]] which is embraced by the public. John suddenly appears and rescues Sarah and Kyle. Pops arrives and unexpectedly shoots John, revealing that John is now [[T-3000|an advanced Terminator]]. {{efn|Identified offscreen as a [[T-3000]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Orange |first=B.

John, tasked with ensuring Skynet's creation, traveled back in time to assist [[Cyberdyne Systems]] with the development of Genisys, hence securing Skynet and its machines' rise. Pops fights John before trapping him long enough for them to escape.\n\nA day before Skynet's worldwide attack, Sarah, Kyle, and Pops retreat to a [[safe house]] and make final preparations to destroy Cyberdyne's Genisys mainframe. They head toward Cyberdyne's headquarters with John in close pursuit. During an airborne chase, Pops dive-bombs into John's helicopter and causes it to crash. John survives the crash and enters the Cyberdyne complex, where it advances the countdown from 13 hours to 15 minutes. Kyle, Sarah, and Pops plant bombs at key points in the facility while holding off John.\n\nIn a final battle, Pops traps John in the magnetic field of a prototype time machine. Both are destroyed, but just before the explosion the remains of Pops are [[Centrifugal force|flung out]] of the apparatus into a nearby experimental vat of [[Terminator (character concept)#Nanorobotic|mimetic polyalloy]]. Kyle and Sarah reach a bunker beneath the facility and the explosion sets off the bombs, preventing Genisys from coming online. Pops appears, upgraded with mimetic polyalloy components like that of the T-1000, and helps them escape from the debris.\n\nThe trio travels to Kyle's childhood home, where Kyle tells his younger self about Genisys and instructs him to repeat the warning to himself, securing the trio's arrival from 1984. Sarah, Kyle, and Pops drive off into the countryside. A [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] reveals that the system core of Genisys, located in a protected subterranean chamber, has survived the explosion.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{See also|List of Terminator (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''Terminator'' characters}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator / Pops]]:<br /> A reprogrammed T-800 Terminator who is Sarah's protector and mentor.\n** Brett Azar stood in on-set as the body double for the T-800 Terminator (of the [[The Terminator|first film]] who time-traveled to 1984) and the Young Guardian in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |last=Acuna |first=Kirsten |url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/terminator-genisys-arnold-schwarzenegger-body-double-2015-6 |title=Meet the bodybuilder who plays Arnold Schwarzenegger's body double in 'Terminator Genisys' |work=Business Insider |date=June 29, 2015 |access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as [[John Connor]]:<br /> The leader of the Resistance and Kyle's mentor, who was attacked by T-5000 and turned into a [[T-3000]] Terminator composed of machine phase matter.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Sperling|first1=Nicole|title=Jason Clarke and the reinvention of the Terminator's John Connor|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/26/terminator-genisys-jason-clarke-john-connor|access-date=December 28, 2015|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 26, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Emilia Clarke]] as [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]]:<br /> Pops' prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and destined to be John's mother.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hibberd |first=James |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/12/13/emilia-clarke-cast-as-sarah-connor/ |title='Game of Thrones' star Emilia Clarke cast as Sarah Connor in 'Terminator' reboot |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=December 13, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2014}}</ref>\n** Willa Taylor as Young Sarah\n* [[Jai Courtney]] as [[Kyle Reese]]:<br /> A Resistance soldier and John's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 destined to be John's father.\n** Bryant Prince as Young Kyle\n* [[J.

They agreed to write a ''Terminator'' film when Cameron, a friend of Kalogridis who worked with her in ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', gave it his blessing.\n\nThe starting point of the script was to retain Schwarzenegger as a central character, unlike the ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot with [[Leonard Nimoy]] as an older [[Spock]] in a minor role. They had to write in the actor (now 67 years old) and followed a suggestion by Cameron that the Terminator's living-tissue exterior was vulnerable to [[aging]] and their idea of Skynet sending a Terminator after an infant Sarah Connor. Kalogridis and Lussier extended this to the core characters of Kyle, Sarah and John Connor, despite each being from a different time period.\n\nAlthough the writers reportedly enjoyed ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', they opted to escape its suggestion that [[Terminator (franchise)#Judgment Day|Judgment Day]] is inevitable because of a [[causal loop]] in favor of all ''Terminator'' timelines existing simultaneously in a [[multiverse]]. To map out the timelines and plot, Kalogridis and Lussier had five [[whiteboard]]s \"covering every wall in the office\". They eventually reached a central plot thread in which the Skynet of one universe, defeated in several timelines, sent the T-5000 to the ''Genisys'' timeline hoping to defeat the humans by \"having the best weapon that humans have\": John Connor. The first draft of the screenplay, to attract a director, was delivered in July 2013.<ref name=\"Screenwriters hired\" /><ref name=Crave>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/873983-exclusive-terminator-genisys-screenwriters-reveal-big-secret#S69fldlY16wsSpau.99|last=Bibbiani |first=William |date=July 2, 2015 |title=Interview: 'Terminator Genisys' Screenwriters Reveal a Big Secret |work=CraveOnline |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215195855/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/873983-exclusive-terminator-genisys-screenwriters-reveal-big-secret |archive-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref><ref name=den>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/terminator-genisys/247414/terminator-genisys-writers-we-have-unanswered-questions|title=Terminator Genisys Writers: 'We Have Unanswered Questions'|work=Den of Geek|date=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Few changes were made to the script from that point onward.

The T-1000 was built from [[fluid simulation]]s, their environments filmed with high-resolution cameras to ensure proper reflection.
