Tina, a stripper/prostitute, is accidentally killed by Michael in the bathroom. Soon after, a security guard comes to investigate the ruckus and discovers Tina's corpse. In desperation, Robert stabs the guard to death. He then convinces the group to dismember the bodies, bury them in the desert, and never speak of it again.\n\nAt the rehearsal dinner, Adam cracks under the pressure from guilt, leading to a confrontation with Michael outside, with Adam threatening to turn him over to the police. Michael is convinced to leave, however while leaving, he turns to ram Adam's beloved minivan. Adam runs in front of his van and is crushed in the collision. In the hospital, Adam whispers something to his wife Lois before dying, as Robert looks on through a glass window.\n\nLois demands answers about what happened in Las Vegas when she finds a written confession by Adam. Kyle makes up a story about Adam sleeping with a prostitute. Robert, suspecting she does not believe them, kills Lois, later framing Michael by luring him to Lois' house, where he kills him. He concocts a story about a Michael/Lois/Adam love triangle to answer any interrogation by police. After these events and being named beneficiary of Adam and Lois' estate, Kyle breaks down and confesses the story to his fianc\u00e9e Laura, who demands that her dream wedding proceed as planned.\n\nOn the wedding day, Robert confronts Kyle, demanding the money from Adam's life insurance policy. He refuses and a fight ensues which ends with Laura bludgeoning Robert.  During the ceremony, Kyle and Charles realize that Robert has the wedding rings. Charles goes to retrieve them, opening a door that knocks Robert down a stairwell where he dies. Laura demands Kyle bury his body in the desert and then ensure no loose ends remain by killing Charles. Ultimately, he cannot go through with it and as he drives home, he crashes into an oncoming car.\n\nAfter the collision, Kyle's legs are amputated below the knee and Charles is a quadriplegic confined to a motorized wheelchair, leaving Laura to care for both of them, in addition to raising Adam and Lois's sons. As Laura watches Kyle with the two boys, it hits her that her life and dreams are totally ruined and has a nervous breakdown as she runs out of the house and collapses screaming in the street.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christian Slater]] as Robert Boyd\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as Laura Garrety-Fisher\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Kyle Fisher\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Adam Berkow\n* [[Jeremy Piven]] as Michael Berkow\n* [[Leland Orser]] as Charles Moore\n* [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] as Lois Berkow\n* [[Joey Zimmerman]] as Adam Berkow Jr.\n* [[Kobe Tai]] as Tina\n\n==Production==\n''Very Bad Things'' was noted for having a very similar plot setup to ''[[Stag (film)|Stag]]'', a film which originally aired on [[HBO]] in June 1997. Director [[Peter Berg]] told ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' in 1998, \"See, the first time I'd ever heard about ''Stag'' was after I had finished writing the screenplay for ''Very Bad Things''. When we were at the point of getting the film financed, we had a lawyer look over the script and the film to make sure there weren't too many similarities. I mean, there were things we had to change; for example, one of the characters in the movie was a baker, and there was also a baker in our script, so we had to change some very minor things. But as far as I understand it, the two films take very different approaches to the material. I will say this: I think it would be interesting to get, like, three different directors\u2014say, [[Steven Soderbergh|Soderbergh]], [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]], and [[Francis Ford Coppola|Coppola]]\u2014and have them all tell the exact same story in a different way.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Peter Berg |url=https://www.avclub.com/peter-berg-1798207956 |website=[[The A.V.

In a retrospective for Daily Grindhouse, [[Preston Fassel]] praised the film as a critique of [[bro culture]], writing \"it\u2019s the perfect deconstruction of the responsibility-free bro-comedy, a movie that looks at the real-life consequences of so much 'innocent' bad behavior,\" comparing its philosophy to the [[Homer's Enemy]] episode of [[The Simpsons]] and calling it \"the brilliant anti-comedy we need today.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Preston Fassel |title=Very Good Comedy: Why 'Very Bad Things' is the Brilliant Anti-Comedy We Need Today |website=Daily Grindhouse |url=http://dailygrindhouse.com/thewire/very-good-comedy-why-very-bad-things-is-the-brilliant-anti-comedy-we-need-today/ }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0124198|title=Very Bad Things}}\n* {{Amg movie|173513|Very Bad Things}}\n* {{mojo title|id=verybadthings|title=Very Bad Things}}\n\n{{Peter Berg}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1998 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s black comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American black comedy films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Crimes against sex workers in fiction]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about murderers]]\n[[Category:Films about prostitution in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about weddings in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Berg]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stewart Copeland]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Las Vegas Valley]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Peter Berg]]\n[[Category:Initial Entertainment Group films]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:Necrophilia in film]]\n[[Category:PolyGram Filmed Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
