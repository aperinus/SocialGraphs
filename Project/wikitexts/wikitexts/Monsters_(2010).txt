Edwards also served as the cinematographer, production designer, and a visual effects artist. The film takes place years after a [[NASA]] probe crashed in Mexico, which leads to the sudden appearance of giant tentacled monsters. It follows Andrew Kaulder ([[Scoot McNairy]]), an American photojournalist tasked with escorting his employer's daughter Samantha Wynden ([[Whitney Able]]) back to the United States by crossing through Mexico's \"Infected Zone\", where the creatures reside.\n\nEdwards conceived the idea for the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to [[Vertigo Films]], who suggested he watch ''[[In Search of a Midnight Kiss]]'', a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. [[Principal photography]] lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.\n\n''Monsters'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on 13 March 2010. Hours later, [[Magnolia Pictures|Magnet Releasing]] acquired the rights to distribute it in North America. It had a [[limited release]] there, beginning on 29 October 2010, followed by a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2010. The film received generally positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing {{USD}}4.2&nbsp;million against a budget of less than $500,000. ''[[Monsters: Dark Continent]]'', a sequel, was released in the UK on 1 May 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a [[NASA]] space probe (sent to verify the existence of extraterrestrial life in the solar system) crash-lands in Mexico, [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] life forms spread throughout the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] region, leading to the quarantine of the northern half of Mexico. US and Mexican troops battle to contain the creatures, and a huge wall stretching along the border ostensibly keeps the US protected.\n\nAmerican [[photojournalist]] Andrew Kaulder ([[Scoot McNairy]]) receives a call from his employer, who tells Andrew to find his daughter, Samantha Wynden ([[Whitney Able]]), and escort her back to the US. Andrew locates Samantha in a Mexican hospital and the pair board a train, until learning the tracks ahead have been damaged. They discover that if they do not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked for six months. Andrew and Samantha decide to [[Hitchhiking|hitchhike]] their way to the coast. Andrew buys Samantha an expensive ferry ticket for the next morning. After enjoying the local nightlife together, Andrew sleeps with a local woman who steals their passports. Unable to board the ferry, Samantha is forced to [[barter]] her engagement ring for passage through the quarantine zone.\n\nThey travel by riverboat until being transferred to a group of armed escorts who are to lead them overland to the Mexico\u2013US border. The convoy is attacked by the creatures. Andrew and Samantha escape, but none of the guards survive. Pressing on, they discover the bodies of dead travellers and bond at the top of an ancient pyramid in sight of the US border wall. By the time they reach the border, the creatures have crossed into the United States. Andrew and Samantha travel through a severely damaged, evacuated town in Texas, find an abandoned gas station with power and call the army for help.\n\nWhile waiting for help to arrive, they make phone calls to their families. A lone creature silently approaches the station. Hiding, Samantha observes several tentacles exploring the inside of the store, seemingly soaking up a television's light. Samantha quickly unplugs the television and the creature loses interest. Another creature appears and they communicate with one another and possibly mate via light impulses. The creatures leave as the military arrives. Samantha and Andrew kiss before they are rushed into different vehicles. The chronological ending takes place at the beginning of the film, filmed in green night vision sight, when the military rescue team is attacked by a creature.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n\n[[File:Gareth Edwards by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Gareth Edwards, who wrote, directed, and shot ''Monsters'']]\nWhile studying at university in 1996, Edwards made a short [[monster movie]] set in [[suburbia]]. He initially wanted to expand the idea but after the release of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'', he believed it was \"not going to be special any more\". Considering that the film would have to be low-budget, Edwards decided to embrace the [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] style of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and mix that element with his original concept. After learning about ''[[Cloverfield]]''{{'s}} similar premise, he abandoned this idea and moved on to a concept where a \"war [is] going on somewhere on the other side of the world and no one cares\".<ref name=\"DenofGeek\" />\n\nEdwards conceived the film while watching some fishermen struggling to haul in their net and imagining a monster inside of it. He had the idea to make a monster movie set \"years after most other monster movies end, when people aren't running and screaming but life is going on\" and \"where a giant, dead sea monster is considered completely normal\".<ref name=\"Empire\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nEdwards pitched his idea to [[Vertigo Films]], where producer James Richardson asked him to watch ''[[In Search of a Midnight Kiss]]'' for an example of low-budget film making. It starred Scoot McNairy and had been made for $15,000. Edwards was impressed by McNairy but wanted a real couple to portray the lead characters.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/article/889705--interview-whitney-able-and-scoot-mcnairy | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Linda | last=Barnard | title=Interview: Whitney Able and Scoot McNairy | date=2010-11-12}} Retrieved August 2011.</ref> McNairy sent Edwards a picture of his girlfriend, actress [[Whitney Able]], who Edwards initially thought was \"too good-looking\".

But ... we were in some of the most beautiful places I'd ever seen, being helped by the most generous people in the world.\"|source=\u2014Gareth Edwards, recalling events during filming in Central America<ref name=\"Empire\" />}}\n\nThe film was written and directed by Gareth Edwards, while [[Allan Niblo]] and James Richardson of [[Vertigo Films]] served as producers.<ref name=\"Magnet\" /> Edwards did not storyboard or script the film but wrote a treatment of the story and outlines that detailed points that needed to be hit in dialogue.<ref name=\"Ending\" /> The filming equipment cost approximately $15,000 and the production budget came in \"way under\" $500,000.<ref name=\"MSN\" /> The film was able to be made on such a low budget largely due to the production using consumer grade [[wikt:prosumer#Etymology 2|prosumer]] level equipment instead of professional paraphernalia. The film was shot using [[Digital cinematography|digital video cameras]] rather than the more expensive [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]] and was edited on a laptop computer.<ref name=\"Buy\"/> Many of the locations in the film were used without permission and most of the extras were people who were already at the locations.<ref name=\"Buy\" /><ref name=\"RoseExtras\" /> As the extras were non-actors who were persuaded to be in the film, their actions were improvised.<ref name=\"Empire\"/>\n\nThe film was shot in Belize, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and the United States over three weeks.<ref name=\"Empire\" /><ref name=\"ShootingLocations\" /> For about 90 per cent of the [[principal photography]], the crew consisted of seven people transported in one van: Edwards, Able, McNairy, sound operator Ian Maclagan, line producer Jim Spencer, Mexican [[Fixer (journalism)|fixer]] Verity Oswin and a driver.<ref name=\"Empire\" />\n\n===Editing and effects===\nEvery night after shooting, editor Colin Goudie and his assistant Justin Hall would download the footage so the memory sticks could be cleared and be ready for the next day.<ref name=\"Empire\"/> While new footage was being shot, the filmed footage was edited at the production team's hotel.<ref name=\"Buy\"/> After filming concluded, the crew had over 100 hours of footage. The original cut was over four hours long but was trimmed to 94 minutes after eight months of editing.<ref name=\"Empire\"/> Edwards originally had the ending of the film both at the beginning and the end. He and the producers disagreed about the placement, so he decided to put the chronological ending of the film at the beginning and end the film immediately after Andrew and Samantha kiss.<ref name=\"Ending\" />\n\nEdwards created the visual effects using off-the-shelf [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] software, [[ZBrush]] and [[Autodesk 3ds Max]]. He had five months to create all 250 visual effects shots, a process he undertook in his bedroom. He produced two shots a day until he reached the first creature shot, when \"suddenly two months went by and [he] still hadn't finished a single creature shot\"; Edwards stated that the creatures' visual effects were the most challenging element of production. Due to time constraints, the sound effects had to be produced before the visual effects.<ref name=\"Empire\"/>\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Monsters'' premiered at the [[South by Southwest]] Film Festival on 13 March 2010.<ref name=\"SXSW\" /> In May, the film was screened at the [[March\u00e9 du Film|Cannes Film Market]].<ref name=\"Cannes\" /> It also screened as part of the 64th [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] on 18 June 2010,<ref name=\"Edinburgh\" /> and screened twice at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] on 23 and 26 June.<ref name=\"LAFF\" /> The film was first released in Russia on 30 September 2010.<ref name=\"RussiaRelease\" /> ''Monsters'' later released in the United States on 29 October,<ref name=\"Magnolia\" /> in Canada on 5 November,<ref name=\"DFilms\" /> and the United Kingdom on 3 December.<ref name=\"BBFC\" /> In the weeks leading up to the UK release, a marketing campaign using social network [[Foursquare (social networking)|Foursquare]] was announced.

On 26 December 2010, the film concluded its nine-week run with a gross of $237,301.<ref name=\"BOMweekendsUS\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n''Monsters'' received generally positive reviews from critics. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 73% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 159 reviews, with an average rating of 6.61/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"It doesn't quite live up to its intriguing premise, but ''Monsters'' is a surprising blend of alien-invasion tropes, political themes, and relationship drama.\"<ref name=\"Rotten\" /> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 63 based on 26 reviews, which is considered to be \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\" />\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, praising its focus on \"characters, relationships, fear and mostly unseen menace\" rather than its visual effects, as well as the acting. He also commended Edwards for \"evoking ... awe and beauty\" and for the creature designs.<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> [[Peter Bradshaw]], writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', gave it four stars out of five, described the film as a \"terrifically exciting sci-fi movie\" and concluded that Edwards \"channels the upriver nightmares of [[Werner Herzog|[Werner] Herzog]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola|[Francis Ford] Coppola]], with a strong streak of [[Steven Spielberg|Spielbergian]] wonder at the sight of two aliens apparently dancing\".<ref name=\"Bradshaw\" /> [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' was critical of the performances but praised the film's \"considerable, crafty virtues\", its premise, and its ending.<ref name=\"Phillips\" /> Jeanette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"wondrously atmospheric\" and \"effortlessly compel[ling]\", and praised Edwards' \"beautiful, otherworldly\" visual effects.<ref name=\"Catsoulis\" /> Dan Jolin of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' echoed the comparison to Herzog, opining that the film \"exhibits the lyrical surrealism of [his] jungle excursions\". He also praised the visual effects, Edwards' cinematography, and the \"simmering\" chemistry between McNairy and Able, concluding that the film was \"both shoestring and sci-fi filmmaking at its best\".<ref name=\"Jolin\" /> Michael Rechtshaffen of the [[Associated Press]] praised Edwards for \"add[ing] original touches to the genre\" and for his production design. He criticised the \"tentative\" and \"alienating\" performances of McNairy and Able, but stated that \"the overall picture still impresses\".<ref name=\"Rechtshaffen\" /> Jennie Punter of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' disagreed, comparing the lead actors' chemistry to [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Julie Delpy]] in  ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' and praising the pacing.<ref name=\"Punter\" /> Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B+, also praising the performances of McNairy and Able and commending Edwards' work.<ref name=\"Collis\" />\n\nConversely, [[Ty Burr]] of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' gave the film a mixed review, granting it two and a half stars out of five. Though he praised the score, he stated that it is \"more fascinating for its ambitions than for what it accomplishes\" and criticised the main characters for being \"too shallow\" and unengaging.<ref name=\"Burr\" /> Robert Abele of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' criticised the \"weak plot, forgettable dialogue and sloppy politics\" and called the lead characters \"empty-headed blanks\".<ref name=\"Abele\" /> Amy Biancolli of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called McNairy and Able a \"semi-interesting\" pair, but disliked the lack of monsters in the film, the dialogue, and the familiarity of the story.<ref name=\"Biancolli\" /> Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the film \"a less-than-compelling relationship drama\", criticising it for being unoriginal and predictable, and that hiding the monsters made them less frightening.<ref name=\"O'Sullivan\" />\n\n===Accolades===\nAt the [[British Independent Film Awards 2010|13th British Independent Film Awards]], ''Monsters'' was nominated in six categories including Best Picture, Best Director for Edwards, and [[BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film|Best Actor]] for McNairy. The film won for Best Director, Best Technical Achievement, and Best Achievement in Production.<ref name=\"BIFAnom\" /><ref name=\"BIFAwin\" /> At the [[64th British Academy Film Awards]], Edwards was nominated for Outstanding Debut by a British Director, but lost to [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] for ''[[Four Lions]]''.<ref name=\"BAFTAnom\" /> It won Best Independent Movie at the [[2011 Scream Awards]], and was nominated for Best Science Fiction Movie.<ref name=\"ScreamWin\" /><ref name=\"ScreamNom\" /> The film also won Best International Film at the [[37th Saturn Awards]].<ref name=\"Saturn\" /> The [[National Board of Review]] named the film one of the top ten independent films of 2010,<ref name=\"NBR\" /> and it placed third on [[Moviefone]]'s Top 10 Sci-Fi Movies of 2010 list.<ref name=\"MFtop10\" />\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Monsters: Dark Continent}}\n\nA sequel, ''[[Monsters: Dark Continent]]'', started filming in March 2013 in Jordan and Detroit, with Tom Green directing and Jay Basu writing.
