It tells the story of Zack Mayo (Gere), a [[United States Navy]] [[Officer candidate#U.S. Navy|Aviation Officer Candidate]] who is beginning his training at [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)#AOCS|Aviation Officer Candidate School]]. While Zack meets his first true girlfriend during his training, a young \"townie\" named Paula (Winger), he also comes into conflict with the hard-driving [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Emil Foley (Gossett) training his class.\n\nThe film was written by [[Douglas Day Stewart]] and directed by [[Taylor Hackford]]. Its title is an old expression from the [[Royal Navy]] and later from the U.S. [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]'s charge of \"[[conduct unbecoming|conduct unbecoming an Officer and a Gentleman]]\" (from 1860). The film was commercially released in the U.S. on August 13, 1982. It was well received by critics, with a number calling it the best film of 1982. It also was a financial success, grossing $190 million against a budget that was between $6-$7 million.<ref name=\"Solomon, Aubrey 1989 p. 198\">Solomon, Aubrey (1989).

After his mother's suicide while he was a child, he moved to the [[Philippines]] to live with his father, Byron, a US Navy [[Boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|Boatswain's Mate]] [[Petty officer first class|First Class]], an alcoholic, and a womanizer. Zack grows up as a [[Navy brat]] at [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay]] and is now determined\u2014despite his father's disapproval\u2014to become a Navy pilot.\n\nUpon arrival at AOCS, Zack and his fellow AOCs are shocked by the harsh treatment they receive from their head [[drill instructor]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley. He tells them that he will eliminate OCs who are found to be mentally or physically unfit for commission as an ensign in the U.S. Navy, which will earn them flight training worth over $1,000,000. \n\nFoley also warns the male candidates about \"Puget Sound Debs\", local girls who dream of marrying a [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] and who will feign pregnancy or stop using birth control to trap a man. Zack and fellow candidate Sid Worley meet two local factory workers, Paula Pokrifki and Lynette Pomeroy, at a Navy Ball. Zack begins a relationship with Paula, while Sid dates Lynette.\n\nFoley runs the program mercilessly, and Recruit Topper Daniels drops out after nearly drowning during a [[ditching]]-escape exercise. He believes Zack lacks motivation and is not a team player, and when he discovers Zack has been selling pre-shined shoes and belt buckles, he punishes him with an entire weekend of hazing to make him quit the program. Zack refuses, and Foley tells him he will expel him. Upon hearing this, Zack breaks down and admits that he has no options in civilian life. Satisfied that he has come to a crucial self-realization, Foley relents.\n\nThe next weekend, Zack learns that Paula's real father, an officer candidate like him, got Paula's mother pregnant and refused to marry her. Shortly after, as it nears time for him to move to another academy for the next part of training, he breaks up with her, which she reluctantly accepts. \n\nDuring his last obstacle-course run, Zack has a chance to break the course record, but instead stops to encourage his teammate, Casey Seeger, to succeed. He attends a dinner with Sid and his parents and learns that his friend has a long-time girlfriend who was his late brother's, and whom he is planning to marry once he receives his commission. Meanwhile, Lynette has been hinting to Sid that she may be pregnant with his child.\n\nAfter having a severe [[anxiety attack]] during a high-altitude simulation in a [[Hypobaric chamber|pressure chamber]], Sid quits. He goes to Lynette's house to propose marriage but she rejects him, telling him she wants to marry a naval aviator, and that she got her period and so is not pregnant. After Sid leaves, Zack shows up with Paula looking for him; after Lynette recaps the conversation with Sid, Zack accuses her of making up the pregnancy, which she denies. \n\nZack and Paula go looking for Sid and discover that he has [[suicide by hanging|hanged himself]]. Zack blames himself and heads back to base, intending to quit, but Foley will not let him. They fight, with Zack landing several blows on a surprised Foley before the latter ends the fight and tells Zack he can quit if he wants.\n\nZack completes the training and is commissioned as an officer; following tradition, he receives his first salute from Foley in exchange for a US [[dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]]. Zack thanks Foley for not giving up on him, saying he would have never made it without him. \n\nZack finds Paula at the factory and declares his love to her, then picks her up and walks out with her in his arms to the applause of all her colleagues, including Lynette.\n\n== Cast ==\n(in credits order)\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Richard Gere]] as [[Officer candidate#U.S. Navy|Aviation Officer Candidate]] Zack Mayo\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Paula Pokrifki\n* [[David Keith (actor)|David Keith]] as AOC Sid Worley\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as [[Boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|Boatswain's Mate]] Byron Mayo (Zack's father)\n* [[Lisa Blount]] as Lynette Pomeroy\n* [[Lisa Eilbacher]] as AOC Casey Seeger\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as [[Gunnery Sergeant]] Emil Foley, [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]\n* [[Tony Plana]] as AOC Emiliano Santos Della Serra\n* [[Harold Sylvester]] as AOC Lionel Perryman\n* [[David Caruso]] as AOC Topper Daniels\n* [[Victor French]] as Joe Pokrifki (Paula's stepfather)\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Esther Pokrifki (Paula's mother)\n* [[Tommy Petersen]] as Young Zack\n* [[Elizabeth Rogers]] as Betty Worley\n* [[John Laughlin (actor)|John Laughlin]] as Troy\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Altitude Chamber Instructor (voice)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Locations ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date= May 2012}}\nThe film was shot in late 1981 on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], at [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]] and [[Fort Worden]].  The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] did not permit filming at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]] in the  [[Florida Panhandle|Florida panhandle]], the site of the actual [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Navy)#AOCS|Aviation Officer Candidate School]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Pensacola-Florida-270656.html |title= Fun Trivia |access-date= August 10, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130609022801/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Pensacola-Florida-270656.html |archive-date= June 9, 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref> in 1981.  Deactivated U.S. Army base [[Fort Worden]] stood in for the location of the school, an actual Naval Air Station in the Puget Sound area, [[NAS Whidbey Island]].\n\nA motel room in Port Townsend, ''The Tides Inn'' on Water Street ({{coord|48.1105|-122.765}}), was used for the film.<ref name=waflmloc>{{cite news |url=https://sites.google.com/site/wafilmlocations/filmsblog/an-officer-a-gentleman-1982 |work=Washington film locations |title=An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) |access-date=August 27, 2016 |archive-date=October 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011035121/https://sites.google.com/site/wafilmlocations/filmsblog/an-officer-a-gentleman-1982 |url-status=live }}</ref> There was a plaque outside the room noting it as a filming location, although the room has been extensively refurbished. Some early scenes of the movie were filmed in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], with ships of the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in the background.\n\nThe \"[[Dilbert Dunker]]\" scenes were filmed in the swimming pool at what is now Mountain View Elementary School (Port Townsend Jr High School during filming).<ref name=waflmloc/>  According to the director's commentary on the DVD, the dunking machine was constructed specifically for the film and was an exact duplicate of the actual one used by the Navy.  {{As of|2010}}, Mountain View Elementary is closed and is home to the Mountain View Commons, which holds the police station, food bank, and the YMCA, the latter of which holds the pool.\n\nThe filming location of Paula Pokrifiki's house was 1003 Tremont in Port Townsend.<ref name=waflmloc/>  As of 2009, the house was shrouded by a large hedge, and the front porch had been remodeled.  The neighboring homes and landscape look identical to their appearance in the film, including the 'crooked oak tree' across the street from the Pokrifiki home.  This oak tree is visible in the scene near the end of the film in which Richard Gere returns to the home to request Paula's help in finding his friend Sid.  In the film, the plot has Paula leaving on a ferry ride away from the naval base.  In reality, Paula's home is located approximately 8 blocks from Fort Worden.\n\nLynette Pomeroy's house was located on Mill Road, just west of the main entrance of the Port Townsend Paper Corp. mill. The house no longer exists, but the concrete driveway pad is still visible.\n\nThe interior of the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] building at Fort Worden State Park was used for the reception scene near the beginning of the film.\n\n[[File:Fort Worden Battery Kinzie pano 01.jpg|thumb|Battery Kinzie, scene of \"I got nowhere else to go!\"]]\nThe concrete structure used during the famous Richard Gere line \"I got nowhere else to go!\" is the Battery Kinzie located at Fort Worden State Park.  The scene was filmed on the southwest corner of the upper level of the battery.  The 'obstacle course' was constructed specifically for the film and was located in the grassy areas just south and southeast of Battery Kinzie.\n\nThe decompression chamber was one of the only sets constructed for the film and {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, it is still intact in the basement of building number 225 of the Fort Worden State Park. It can be seen through the windows of the building's basement.\n\nBuilding 204 of Fort Worden State Park was used as the dormitory and its porch was used for the film's closing 'silver dollar' scene.\n\nThe [[blimp]] hangar used for the famous fight scene between Louis Gossett Jr. and Richard Gere is located at Fort Worden State Park and {{as of|2013|lc=y}} is still intact, but has been converted into a 1200-seat performing arts center called the McCurdy Pavilion.\n\nThe filming location for the exterior of 'TJ's Restaurant' is located at the Point Hudson Marina in Port Townsend. The space is now occupied by a company that makes sails. The fictional \"TJ's\" is an homage to the Trader Jon's bar in Pensacola, Florida, as a naval aviator hangout until it closed later in November 2003. For years, it was traditional for graduating Aviation Officer Candidate School classes to celebrate their commissioning at \"Trader's.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>{{Cite news|title=Trader Jon: Unofficial Curator of Naval Aviation|last=Edman|first=Carter|date=1996|work=Naval Aviation News|hdl = 2027/uiug.30112105167453}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nOriginally, [[folk music]] singer and occasional actor [[John Denver]] was signed to play Zack Mayo.

However, Taylor Hackford instead cast [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] and had Ermey coach him for his role as the film's technical advisor. It was there where the \"steers and queers\" comment from Gossett's character in the 1982 movie came from, which was later used for Ermey's role in the 1987 film ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Krane |first=Jonathan D. |title=The Art & Science of Moviemaking (Part I) |pages=98\u2013100 |date= September 7, 2012 |publisher= Polimedia Publishing }}{{ISBN needed}}</ref>\n\nHackford kept Gossett Jr. in separate living quarters from other actors during production so Gossett could intimidate them more during his scenes as drill instructor.<ref name=\"making of a new\">{{cite news | title = The making of a new D.I.: Director separated Gossett, Gere to sustain intensity | newspaper = The Lakeland Register | date= August 20, 1982 | pages = 1\u20132C | first = Judy | last= Klemesrud }}</ref> In addition to R.

Gere thought the ending would not work because it was too sentimental. Director [[Taylor Hackford]] agreed with Gere until, during a rehearsal, the extras playing the workers began to cheer and cry. When Gere saw the scene later, with a portion of the score (that was used to write \"[[Up Where We Belong]]\") played at the right tempo, he said it gave him chills. Gere is now convinced Hackford made the right decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/gere-begged-director-not-to-shoot-romantic-scene_1029465 |title=Gere begged director not to shoot romantic scene |publisher=PR Inside |date=April 29, 2007 |access-date=December 31, 2012 |archive-date=June 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605232058/http://www.contactmusic.com/news/gere-begged-director-not-to-shoot-romantic-scene_1029465 |url-status=live }}</ref> Screenwriter [[Michael Hauge]], in his book ''Writing Screenplays That Sell'', echoed this opinion: \"I don't believe that those who criticized this [[Cinderella]]-style ending were paying very close attention to who exactly is rescuing whom.\"{{citation needed|reason=book reference page numbers and ISBN needed|date=September 2021}}\n\n== Release ==\nTwo versions of the film exist. The original, an uncensored R-rated cut and an edited-for-broadcast television cut (which first aired on [[NBC]] in 1986) are nearly identical. The main difference is that the nudity and a majority of the foul language are edited out when the film airs on regular television.  However, the group marching song near the beginning of the film and Mayo's solo marching song are not voiceover edits; they are reshoots of those scenes for television.
