As [[class president]], he has raised $25,000 in order to bring a brilliant [[Cambodia]]n student, Samnang, to study in the United States, but otherwise has found little else memorable about his high school experience. His friends, perverted film student Eli, and shy and awkward Klitz, rebuff his displeasure with their lack of risky behavior. His life suddenly changes when a young woman, Danielle, moves in next door. When Matthew witnesses her undressing, she sees him and storms over. Introducing herself to his parents, they suggest to Matthew that he show Danielle around town. During the car ride, Danielle coerces him into taking his clothes off and forces him to run naked down the street.\n\nMatthew and Danielle bond through a series of flirtatious dares. At a raucous party thrown by a classmate, Matthew finally finds the courage to kiss Danielle. The following day, Matthew's reverie is shattered when Eli informs him that Danielle is a former adult film actress.\n\nOn Eli's advice, Matthew takes Danielle to a motel and treats her coolly. Danielle, insulted, abruptly ends their relationship. Matthew attempts to apologize, but Danielle decides to return to the adult industry. Matthew, Eli, and Klitz go to an [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo|adult film convention]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] where Kelly, an adult film producer and Danielle's ex-boyfriend, menacingly warns Matthew not to interfere with his business. Matthew ignores him, convincing Danielle to leave her past behind.\n\nDays later, an enraged Kelly abducts Matthew from school and physically assaults him, saying that he cost him $30,000. Kelly offers to let Matthew erase his debt by stealing an award from his former partner, Hugo Posh. Once Matthew enters the house, Kelly calls the police and leaves. Matthew narrowly escapes and rushes to an important [[scholarship]] award dinner. High on [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] that Kelly tricked him into taking, he improvises a sentimental speech. Although he endears himself to Danielle, he does not win the scholarship.\n\nKelly exacts further revenge by posing as Matthew's student advisor and stealing the money raised for Samnang. Matthew fears that he will be implicated in the fraud. He turns to Danielle for help, and she calls Hugo Posh; they agree to make a pornographic film on [[prom]] night with Danielle's former colleagues and Matthew's classmates as actors. Eli directs the production, and when no-one is able to perform an important scene, Klitz finds the confidence to undertake it. They celebrate the successful shoot; Matthew and Danielle have sex for the first time.\n\nThe next morning, Eli calls Matthew, informing him that the tape has been stolen. Matthew enters his house to find Kelly, in possession of the tape, talking with his parents and [[school principal|principal]]. Kelly demands Matthew's half of the eventual profits. When Matthew refuses, Kelly plays the tape for the group, who are surprised to find that Matthew and his friends have made a modern [[sexual education]] film.\n\nHugo Posh and Matthew make millions, and Posh pays for Samnang's trip. Eli becomes a successful filmmaker, Klitz attends college and is pleased to learn that his classmates revel at his scene in the film, and Matthew attends Georgetown, bringing Danielle with him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as Matthew Kidman\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Danielle/Athena\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Kelly\n* [[James Remar]] as Hugo Posh\n* [[Chris Marquette]] as Eli Brooks\n* [[Paul Dano]] as Tim Klitz\n* Ulysses Lee as Samnang\n* Harris Laskawy as Principal Salinger\n* [[Autumn Reeser]] as Jane\n* [[Olivia Wilde]] as Kellie\n* [[Amanda Swisten]] as April\n* [[Sung-Hi Lee]] as Ferrari\n* [[Timothy Bottoms]] as Mr. Kidman\n* Donna Bullock as Mrs. Kidman\n* [[Jacob Young]] as Hunter\n* [[Luther Reigns]] as Mule\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $14,589,444 in the US, plus $15,821,739 outside the US, for a combined gross of $30,411,183.<ref name=\"mojo\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 56% approval rating based on reviews from 159 reviews, with an average rating of 5.60/10.
