It was adapted by [[Leslie Bricusse]] from the [[Doctor Dolittle|novel series]] by [[Hugh Lofting]]. The screenplay primarily fuses three of the books, ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]'' (1920), ''[[The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle]]'' (1922), and ''[[Doctor Dolittle's Circus]]'' (1924).\n\nVarious attempts to adapt the ''Doctor Dolittle'' series began as early as the 1920s. In the early 1960s, actress-turned-producer Helen Winston acquired the film rights in an attempt to produce a film adaptation to no success. In 1963, producer [[Arthur P. Jacobs]] subsequently acquired the rights and recruited [[Alan Jay Lerner]] to compose the songs and Rex Harrison to star in the project. After numerous delays, Lerner was later fired and replaced by Leslie Bricusse. The film encountered a more notoriously protracted production with numerous setbacks along the way such as complications from poorly chosen shooting locations, creative demands from Harrison, and the numerous technical difficulties inherent with the large number of animals required for the story. The film exceeded its original budget of $6&nbsp;million threefold.\n\n''Doctor Dolittle'' premiered in [[London]] on December 12, 1967, where it eventually recouped $9&nbsp;million during its theatrical run,<ref name=\"numbers\" /> earning only $6.2&nbsp;million in [[Gross rental|theatrical rentals]] and becoming a [[box-office bomb]].{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=230}} The film received negative critical reviews, but through the studio's intense lobbying,{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}} it earned nine [[Academy Awards]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won awards for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The film eventually became a [[cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn early [[Victorian period|Victorian England]], Matthew Mugg ([[Anthony Newley]]) takes his young friend Tommy Stubbins (William Dix) to visit eccentric Doctor John Dolittle ([[Rex Harrison]]) for an injured duck that Matthew had acquired from a local fisherman. Dolittle, a former medical doctor, lives with an extended [[menagerie]], including a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] named Chee-Chee, a [[dog]] named Jip, and a talking [[blue-and-yellow macaw]] named Polynesia (the uncredited voice of [[Ginny Tyler]]). Dolittle claims that he can talk to animals. In a flashback, he explains that he kept so many animals in his home that they created havoc with his human patients, who took their medical needs elsewhere. His sister, who served as his housekeeper, demanded that he dispose of the animals or she would leave; he chose the animals. Polynesia taught him that different animal species can talk to each other, prompting Dolittle to study animal languages so that he could become an animal doctor. He is planning his latest expedition: to search for the legendary Great Pink [[Sea snail]].\n\nThe next day, while treating a horse for nearsightedness, Dolittle is accused by the horse's owner, General Bellowes ([[Peter Bull]]), of stealing his horse, and putting bifocals on the horse's eyes to make it see more clearly. In the process, a fox, who had been one of the doctor's patients, flees from Bellows hounds and runs into a nearby barn. The hounds go into the barn only to immediately leave in panic, due to a group of skunks living there. The doctor explains to Bellows that each fox travels with a skunk for its own protections. Bellowes' niece, Emma Fairfax ([[Samantha Eggar]]), offended by his lack of human empathy, chides Dolittle for his rudeness to her uncle, while he states his contempt for her and other humans who hunt animals, causing her to storm off. Matthew falls in love with her at first sight.\n\nAn American Indian friend of Dolittle's sends him a rare [[Pushmi-pullyu]], a creature that looks like a [[llama]] with a head on each end of its body, so that Dolittle can earn money for his expedition. Dolittle takes the creature to a nearby [[circus]], run by Albert Blossom ([[Richard Attenborough]]), where the Pushmi-Pullyu becomes the star attraction. The doctor befriends a circus [[Pinniped|seal]] named Sophie who longs to return to her husband at the [[North Pole]]. Dolittle smuggles her out of the circus, disguises her in women's clothing to convey her to the coast, and then throws her into the ocean. Fishermen mistake the seal for a woman and have Doctor Dolittle arrested on a charge of murder.\n\nGeneral Bellowes is the [[magistrate]] in his case, but Dolittle proves he can converse with animals by talking with Bellowes' dog and revealing details that only Bellowes and the dog could know. Although Dolittle is acquitted on the murder charge, the vindictive judge sentences him to a [[Mental institution|lunatic asylum]].\n\nDolittle's animal friends engineer his escape, and he, Matthew, Tommy, Polynesia, Chee-Chee and Jip set sail in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail. Emma, by this time fascinated by Dolittle, stows away, seeking adventure. They randomly choose their destination: Sea-Star Island, a floating island currently in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The ship is torn apart during a storm.\n\nEveryone washes ashore on Sea-Star Island, where Emma and Dolittle admit they have grown to like each other. The party is met by the island's [[Indigenous peoples|natives]], whom they mistake for hostile savages. The populace are in fact highly educated and cultured from reading books that have washed ashore from innumerable shipwrecks. Their leader is [[William Shakespeare]] the Tenth ([[Geoffrey Holder]]); his name reflects the tribe's tradition of naming children after favorite authors. William explains that they are wary of strangers coming to the island, and that the tropical island is currently endangered because it is drifting north into colder waters and all the animals on the island have caught colds. Mistrust leads the islanders to blame the doctor and his party. Dolittle persuades a [[whale]] to push the island south, but this causes a balancing rock to drop into a volcano, fulfilling a prophecy that dooms Dolittle and party to die \"the death of 10,000 screams\". The push by the whale also causes the island to rejoin the unknown mainland, fulfilling another prophecy that dictates that the doctor and his friends be heralded as heroes and they are freed.\n\nWhile treating the animals on the island, Dolittle receives a surprise patient \u2013 the Great Pink Sea Snail, which has also caught a severe cold. Dolittle discovers that the snail's shell is watertight and can carry passengers. Dolittle sends Matthew, Tommy, Emma, Polynesia, Chee-Chee, and Jip back to England with the snail. Emma wishes to stay on the island with him, but the Doctor is adamant that a relationship would never work. She finally admits her feelings for the Doctor, and kisses him goodbye. Dolittle cannot go back because he is still a wanted man. Furthermore, he wishes to investigate the natives' stories of another creature, the Giant Luna Moth. After his friends have left, Dolittle realizes painfully that he has feelings for Emma.\n\nSometime later, Sophie the seal arrives accompanied by her husband. They bring a message: the animals of England have gone on [[Strike action|strike]] to protest his sentence and Bellowes has agreed to pardon him. Dolittle and the islanders construct a saddle for the Giant Luna Moth and Dolittle rides the creature back to England.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rex Harrison]] as [[Doctor Dolittle|Doctor John Dolittle]], an eccentric scientist and veterinarian who has unique abilities of communicating with animals with variety of creature languages.\n* [[Samantha Eggar]] as Emma Fairfax, a victorian woman who at first despises and eventually befriends Doctor Dolittle by falling in love with him.

Decades later, [[Walt Disney]] had sought to obtain the rights to make a film adaptation of the novels. The Disney studios wanted Lofting to surrender the ancillary rights in exchange for a [[flat rate|flat fee]] of $7,500, but a suitable contract reached an impasse.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=30}} In 1960, Lofting's widow Josephine gave a short-term option of the film rights to Helen Winston, a Canadian actress who had produced the film ''[[Hand in Hand (film)|Hand in Hand]]'' (1960). In April 1962, 20th Century Fox signed a multi-picture production deal with Winston's company, Luster Enterprises, with plans to commence production in the following months. She also stated she had actor [[George Gobel]] in mind to portray the eponymous character.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Connelly |first=Mike |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/88386625/ |title=In Hollywood |date=June 30, 1961 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |access-date=January 21, 2020 |page=11 |url-access=subscription |archive-date=July 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729235937/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/88386625/ |url-status=live }}</ref> By June 1962, she had completed a script with writer Larry Watkin,{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=30\u20131}}<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hopper |first=Hedda |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/374675461/ |title=Woman Producer Gets Doolittle Story |date=August 7, 1962 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=January 21, 2020 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription |archive-date=July 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729225741/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/374675461/ |url-status=live }}</ref> but the studio decided to cancel the option two months later.\n\nPrior to the release of ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964), producer [[Arthur P. Jacobs]] first heard that the film rights were available on December 5, 1963. Jacobs met with the Loftings' attorney Bernard Silbert in which he told him of his intentions to produce ''Dr. Dolittle'' as a musical with lyricist [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and actor [[Rex Harrison]] attached. On Christmas Day 1963, Jacobs acquired the rights, but he was given the condition to find a distributor within six months.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=32}} In January 1964, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Alan Jay Lerner had signed on to write the script and compose the songs.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/06/archives/lerner-to-write-a-movie-musical-will-do-script-and-lyrics-for-dr-do.html |title=LERNER TO WRITE A MOVIE MUSICAL; Will Do Script and Lyrics for 'Dr. Dolittle' Stories |date=January 6, 1964 |work=The New York Times |access-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819032026/https://www.nytimes.com/1964/01/06/archives/lerner-to-write-a-movie-musical-will-do-script-and-lyrics-for-dr-do.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In the following March, Jacobs pitched his project to studio executive [[Darryl Zanuck]], in which 20th Century Fox signed on as the distributor.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=45\u20136}} On March 22, it was reported that Rex Harrison had also signed to star as Doctor Dolittle.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/22/archives/harrison-and-lerner-reunited-star-lyricist-todo-new-musicalwallis.html |title=Harrison and Lerner Reunite; Star, Lyricist to Do New Musical |date=March 22, 1964 |work=The New York Times |access-date=January 21, 2020}}</ref> Because Lerner's collaborator [[Frederick Loewe]] had retired, Jacobs hired [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] to compose the musical score.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=45\u20136}}\n\nUpon numerous delays to produce a script draft, Lerner was fired from the project on May 7, 1965 due to his endless procrastination stretching over a year as well wanting to continue work on the Broadway musical, ''[[On a Clear Day You Can See Forever]]''.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=77\u201380}} Following Lerner's departure, Jacobs considered hiring the [[Sherman Brothers]], who had just won for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), but they were still under contract to Disney. Jacobs then hired [[Leslie Bricusse]], who was in high demand after his success with the musical ''[[Stop the World \u2013 I Want to Get Off]]''. Determined to make a good impression for his first screenplay commission, Bricusse proved agreeably productive from the start for Jacobs, suggesting numerous story ideas and adding a female leading character to the film during their first meeting on May 6, 1965. Zanuck signed Bricusse on for a trial run, hiring him temporarily to complete two songs for the film and the first twenty pages of a script. Two weeks after he was brought on to the project, Bricusse presented the song \"Talk to the Animals\" composed especially for Harrison.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=90\u20131}} By July 1965, Bricusse followed up with a full script that included various song suggestions while effectively blunting the book's racist content in an adaptation that was met with approval from Josephine Lofting.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=124\u20135}}\n\nFor the director, [[Vincente Minnelli]] was initially attached to the project, but left before Bricusse was hired.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=123}} [[William Wyler]], [[George Roy Hill]], and [[John Huston]] were considered, but [[Richard Zanuck]] settled on [[Richard Fleischer]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=39}}\n\n===Casting===\nLerner's replacement by Bricusse gave Harrison the chance to sit out his contract. For the role of Bumpo, [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] was hired, but Rex Harrison demanded that Davis be fired from the project as he wanted to work with \"a real actor, not a song-and-dance man\".{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=40}} In his place, he suggested [[Sidney Poitier]] despite the fact that Poitier was not a musical performer. Jacobs and Fleischer flew to New York to meet with Poitier who accepted the part only on one condition: to personally meet with Bricusse.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=127\u201328}} The two then met with Davis who was performing at the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]] to inform him that he would be released from his contract. Angered at the casting change, Davis threatened to go public and personally sue Harrison. The next day, Poitier considered leaving the role as he did not want to betray Davis, but eventually stayed in the role.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=128}}\n\nFor the role of Matthew, [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Danny Kaye]] were on the shortlist, but [[Anthony Newley]] was cast, which angered Harrison because he had suggested [[David Wayne]]. Harrison later showed contempt for Bricusse's script and lyrics and demanded to sing live on set instead of lip-syncing to pre-recorded tracks. Shortly after, Harrison was fired from the project. In his place, [[Peter Ustinov]], [[Alec Guinness]], and [[Peter O'Toole]] were considered. Instead, they hired [[Christopher Plummer]] as a replacement,{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=130\u20134}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=40\u20131}} but when Harrison agreed to stay, the producers paid Plummer his agreed-upon salary to leave the production.\n\nFor the role of Emma Fairfax, Harrison suggested [[Maggie Smith]], his co-star in ''[[The Honey Pot]]''.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=128}} [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Hayley Mills]] were approached for the role, but salary negotiations broke down. The role eventually went to [[Samantha Eggar]].{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=128, 157}} Her singing voice was overdubbed by Diana Lee (the daughter of playback singer [[Bill Lee (singer)|Bill Lee]]). Just when shooting was to commence, in order to save thousands on the project, Fleischer and Zanuck decided to reduce Bumpo's role, which was drastically increased due to Poitier's casting. They regrettably informed Poitier that he would be released from his contract before he started filming his scenes.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=43\u20134}} [[Geoffrey Holder]] was cast as his replacement.\n\n===Filming===\nIn June 1966, [[principal photography]] was underway with the village scenes being shot in [[Castle Combe]] in [[Wiltshire]]. The producers did not anticipate that the trained animals for the production would be quarantined upon entering the United Kingdom, forcing replacement of the animals at considerable extra expense to meet deadlines. The producers chose to ignore reports of the area's frequently rainy summers, and the resulting weather continually interfered with shooting and caused health problems for the animals. All modern technologies such as cars, television antennas, and [[Coca-Cola]] promotional signs were removed or hidden, which irritated the locals.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=199\u2013200}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=44\u20135}} An artificial dam built by the production unit was controversially destroyed by British Army officer (and future explorer) [[Ranulph Fiennes]] because he believed it ruined the village.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/oct/05/features11.g21 |title=I am not a madman |date=October 5, 2007 |work=The Guardian |access-date=January 4, 2010 |archive-date=February 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211130352/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/oct/05/features11.g21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Budget woes continued to worsen in which production costs soared to $15&nbsp;million. For the role of Albert Blossom, [[Richard Attenborough]] was hired at the last minute to replace [[Hugh Griffith]] during the shoot.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=199\u2013200}}\n\nIn October 1966, scenes were later shot in [[Marigot Bay]], [[Saint Lucia]]; this location was equally problematic, and problems with insects and frequent tropical storms delayed filming and left eight crew members bedridden due to vomiting, diarrhea, and high fever.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=46\u20137}} The final scene with a giant snail was complicated not only by the poor design of the large prop, but because the island's children had recently been struck by a gastrointestinal epidemic caused by freshwater snails, and mobs of angry locals threw rocks at it. Within a month, filming had fallen 39 days behind schedule in which the production crew had to decamp back to [[California]] for reshoots.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=242\u20133}}\n\nIt was noted that several of the animals bit Rex Harrison during the filming.\n\n====Personality conflicts====\nPersonality conflicts added to the tension during the production. Anthony Newley was incensed by comments made by Harrison that he deemed [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]. Harrison was apparently jealous of his Jewish co-star's participation, and demanded Newley's role be reduced and disrupted scenes featuring Newley.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=242}} Geoffrey Holder received racist abuse from Harrison's entourage.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=242\u20133}} The younger cast members grew to loathe Harrison for this abuse and they retaliated by antagonizing him.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=242}}\n\n====Animal issues====\nAdditionally, over 1,200 live animals were used in the film including dogs, pigs, birds, and even giraffes, all of which required understudies. There are anecdotes of a goat who ate Fleischer's script and a parrot that learned to yell \"cut.\"{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=44}} In one instance, ducks for the film were placed on a lake, but had apparently forgotten how to swim and began to sink, and crew members had to jump into the water to save them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Animals also bit and defecated on the cast and crew, including Harrison.\n\n====Location issues====\nBecause of the troublesome location shoots, the production sets were later reconstructed on the Fox studio lot in California.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=45}} By then, the production budget had reached $17&nbsp;million. Four months later, when filming had finished, Harrison insisted on re-recording his songs live on set. This infuriated conductor [[Lionel Newman]], but he gave into Harrison's demands which proved to be tedious as the orchestral arrangements had to be added later. Filming was finished by April 1967.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=282\u20133}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=45\u20136}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Doctor Dolittle Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = August 28, 1967<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Sternfield |first=Aaron |date=August 19, 1967 |title=ABC Parley Bows 18-LP Release Spearheaded by 'Dolittle' Push |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ykEAAAAMBAJ&q=doctor+dolittle+ABC+Records&pg=PA3 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=3 |issn=0006-2510 |access-date=January 21, 2020 |via=[[Google Books]] |archive-date=June 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603102102/https://books.google.com/books?id=9ykEAAAAMBAJ&q=doctor+dolittle+ABC+Records&pg=PA3 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| recorded   = 1966\u20137\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 45:18\n| label      = [[20th Century Fox Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe lyrics and score music for ''Doctor Dolittle'' was composed by [[Leslie Bricusse]] and conducted by [[Lionel Newman]]. Following a test screening in Minneapolis, preview audiences wrote on their comment cards that the film was too long. Before the film was screened again in San Francisco, several verses of the songs were dropped to improve the film's pacing including \"Something in Your Smile\".{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=356}} Additional edits were made including the removal of \"Where Are the Words?\" and \"Beautiful Things\" was shortened.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=95\u20136}} In the original cut of the movie, Dr. Dolittle and Emma did eventually begin a relationship in which he sang \"Where Are the Words?\", when he realizes he is falling in love with her, but in a revised version, it's actually Matthew who falls for Emma and it is his recording of the song which is featured on the soundtrack album. Both versions were filmed and both actors recorded their respective versions, but the footage for both, as well as the vocal track by Rex Harrison have been lost.\n\nIn both scenarios, \"Something in Your Smile\" is sung by Dolittle when he realizes he himself has fallen for Emma; although Harrison's vocal for the song survives, the footage does not exist. Ultimately, the version screened in [[San Jose, California]], which ran 151 minutes, became the final cut of the film.{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=356}}\n\nThe soundtrack release was accompanied by an enormous media blitz, with half a million copies of the mono and stereo LP [[soundtrack]] being issued in retail stores four months before the premiere.{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|p=98}} The song, \"Talk to the Animals\", was recorded internationally by [[Bobby Darin]], [[Andy Williams]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]], and [[Andre Kostelanetz]].

failure. The audience consisted mainly of adults, who were not the primary target audience. The general audience response was muted during the screening and comment cards rated it poorly, with frequent complaints about the film's length. A shorter edit of the film with a younger audience previewed in San Francisco was no more successful; a still shorter edit previewed in San Jose was well enough received to be approved as the final cut.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=353\u201357}}\n\nIn October 1967, as the film's release approached, Helen Winston sued 20th Century Fox for $4.5&nbsp;million alleging that the plot point about animals threatening to go on strike on Dolittle's behalf was plagiarized from her screenplay. Bricusse, who had read Winston's script, assumed it was from the books and included it in his own treatment by mistake. Because the producers only had rights to the content of the original books, they had no legal defense and were forced to settle out of court. The animal strike is mentioned in the movie but was not actually filmed.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=357\u20138}}\n\nThe film had its official Royal World Charity Premiere on December 12, 1967 at the [[Odeon Marble Arch]] in London, with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in attendance. On December 19, the film had a reserved-seating premiere at the [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]] in [[New York City]]. Two days later, the film opened at the [[Paramount Theatre (Los Angeles)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] as a benefit for the [[Motion Picture Relief Fund]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2014|pp=96\u20137}}\n\n===Marketing===\nThirteen months before the film's release, Fox began an extensive marketing campaign to promote the film. On September 30, 1966, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine ran a cover of Harrison in character as Dr. Dolittle riding a giraffe accompanied with a piece documenting its production.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Movies / The classic Dolittle tales are finally put on film |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVUEAAAAMBAJ |magazine=Life |date=September 30, 1966 |issn=0024-3019 |page=122 |via=[[Google Books]] |access-date=January 22, 2020 |archive-date=June 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603102125/https://books.google.com/books?id=kVUEAAAAMBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> The release was accompanied with 50 licensees ready to spend $12&nbsp;million in advertising.
