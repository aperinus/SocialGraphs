She believes Kane accepted a [[suicide mission]] because she [[adultery|cheated]] on him.\n\nKane suddenly reappears at home, then starts convulsing. Lena calls an ambulance but government forces divert it to a secret facility. A [[psychologist]] named Dr. Ventress tells her a mysterious zone called the \"Shimmer\" has been expanding from a fallen [[meteor]] for three years. Kane's team explored the Shimmer, but only he returned, and he is now comatose. She wants Lena to join a new expedition to the lighthouse where the meteor landed. Lena joins to find answers for Kane's coma. Ventress also recruits the [[physicist]] Josie Radek, the [[geomorphology|geomorphologist]] Cassie \"Cass\" Sheppard, and the paramedic Anya Thorensen.\n\nAfter entering the Shimmer, the group wakes up and realizes they already travelled several days but have no memory of the journey. All wildlife in the Shimmer has mutated. An alligator with shark teeth attacks Josie but the group saves her.\n\nThe group reaches a military base. They find a video of Kane cutting open a soldier to reveal moving intestines, and later find the soldier\u2019s corpse overgrown by alien [[fungus|fungi]]. At night, a mutant bear kills Cass.\n\nThe survivors discover plants shaped like humans, leading Josie to theorize the Shimmer distorts information like a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] refracts light, intermixing the wildlife's [[DNA]]. Anya realizes they are also mutating and ties up the others in a panic. Anya then hears Cass's voice and runs to it, only to be devoured by the mutant bear. Josie frees herself and shoots the bear. Ventress reveals she has cancer and leaves hurriedly for the lighthouse so she can study it before she dies or mutates. Josie realizes the Shimmer mixed pieces of the dying Cass into the bear, and willfully mutates into a plant to avoid a similar fate.\n\nLena arrives at the lighthouse and discovers a video camera next to a burnt corpse. The footage shows Kane telling the cameraperson to find Lena, then killing himself with a [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus]] [[grenade]]. The footage then shows that the cameraman shares Kane's face. Lena descends into the meteor crater and finds Ventress, who explains the Shimmer will eventually swallow everything. She disintegrates into a pulsing [[Mandelbulb]] that absorbs blood from Lena, creating a humanoid that mimics Lena\u2019s motions. Unable to escape the creature, Lena tricks it into accepting a phosphorus grenade as it transforms into her [[doppelg\u00e4nger]]. Lena flees, but her doppelg\u00e4nger calmly allows the grenade to burn it along with the lighthouse. The Shimmer collapses.\n\nBack at the facility, Lena tells an interrogator that the Shimmer did not seek to destroy, but to \"make something new.\" She asks Kane, who is now awake, if he is really Kane; he replies, \"I don't think so\". He asks if she is really Lena, but she does not answer. They embrace and their [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] shimmer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Lena\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Dr. Ventress\n* [[Gina Rodriguez]] as Anya Thorensen\n* [[Tessa Thompson]] as Josie Radek\n* [[Tuva Novotny]] as Cassie \u201cCass\u201d Sheppard\n* [[Oscar Isaac]] as Kane\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as Lomax\n* [[Sonoya Mizuno]] as Katie\n**Also plays a motion captured role as the Humanoid\n* [[David Gyasi]] as Daniel\n* Sammy Hayman as Mayer\n* Josh Danford as Shelley\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n=== Development ===\n[[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Scott Rudin]] acquired the [[film rights]] to ''[[Annihilation (VanderMeer novel)|Annihilation]]'', the then-unpublished first novel in [[Jeff VanderMeer]]'s ''[[Southern Reach Trilogy]]'', on March 26, 2013.<ref name=\"rudin\">{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Mike Jr. |title=Paramount, Scott Rudin land 'Annihilation', First Installment of Southern Reach Trilogy |url=https://deadline.com/2013/03/paramount-scott-rudin-land-annihilation-first-installment-of-southern-reach-trilogy-461655/ |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=March 26, 2013 |access-date=January 11, 2022}}</ref> Rudin and [[Eli Bush]] were set to [[Film producer|produce]] the film,<ref name=\"rudin\" /> and [[Alex Garland]], who had previously worked with Rudin and Bush on ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'', was hired to write and direct the film in October 2014.<ref>{{cite news |last=McNary |first=Dave |title='Annihilation' Movie Gains Momentum at Paramount with Alex Garland |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/annihilation-alex-garland-1201343824/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 31, 2014 |access-date=January 11, 2022}}</ref>\n\nGarland explained that his adaptation was necessarily based on only the first novel in the trilogy: \"At the point I started working on ''Annihilation'', there was only one of the three books.
