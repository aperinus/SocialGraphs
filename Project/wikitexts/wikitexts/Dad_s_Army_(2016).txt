It is directed by [[Oliver Parker]] and set in 1944, after the events depicted in the television series. [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] plays an elegant German spy, posing as a journalist, reporting on the [[Walmington-on-Sea]] [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] [[platoon]].\n\nThe platoon members are played by [[Toby Jones]] (Captain Mainwaring) (based on [[Arthur Lowe]]), [[Bill Nighy]] (Sergeant Wilson), (based on [[John Le Mesurier]]), [[Tom Courtenay]] (Lance Corporal Jones) (based on [[Clive Dunn]]), [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]], (Private Frazer) (based on [[John Laurie]]), [[Michael Gambon]] (Private Godfrey), (based on [[Arnold Ridley]]), [[Blake Harrison]] (Private Pike), (based on [[Ian Lavender]]) and [[Daniel Mays]] (Private Walker), (based on [[James Beck]]).\n\nThe [[production design]] was by [[Simon Bowles]] and the [[cinematography]] by Christopher Ross. The film was released on 5 February 2016 in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. DVD and Blu-ray released in the [[United Kingdom]] on 13 June 2016. It received mostly negative reviews from critics. When the film was released in the United Kingdom, it reached second place in the box-office charts, behind ''[[Goosebumps (film)|Goosebumps]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20160205|title=UK Weekend Box Office 5th February 2016 - 7th February 2016|work=25th Frame|access-date=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the spring of 1944, German forces work to secure intelligence about the upcoming [[invasion of Normandy|Allied invasion]], after one of their spies is intercepted in London by MI5 agents, Major Cunningham and Captain Meeks. Meanwhile, [[Captain Mainwaring]] finds his [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] in the coastal town of [[Walmington-on-Sea]] suffer from a lack of appreciation for their work in contributing to the war effort. Things change when the platoon, during an exercise, accidentally force Rose Winters, an elegant journalist, off the road. When they learn she intends to write a report about them for a national magazine, the men feel delighted, but also are charmed by her presences, causing them to have feuds with the townsfolk, and especially with their wives. The matter is further complicated when [[Sergeant Wilson]] develops a friendship with Winters after recognising her as a student he once tutored at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\nUnknown to the platoon, Rose is actually the spy sent by Germany to investigate the Allied invasion plans, but a transmission she sends by radio is detected by Cunningham and Meeks, who travel there to seek her out. After meeting with Mainwaring and informing him of the situation, he takes delight in using this as a means to save his platoon from being disbanded by the Home Guard's senior officer, Colonel Theakes, after a disaster during an important patrol near [[Dover]]. Rose swiftly joins the patrol through Private Joe Walker, after discovering his illegal bootlegging business, and uses the next patrol to discover important details on the Allies' plan, including where the invasion will take place. As the platoon work to find the spy on Mainwaring's orders, Rose deceives him in believing the spy is Wilson, who is promptly arrested.\n\nWhile Mainwaring decides to meet with Rose to thank her for her assistance, the rest of the platoon detain Wilson for questioning, until evidence is brought to their attention that Rose is the spy they were seeking. Tracking her down, they quickly find her holding Mainwaring prisoner with a [[Wehrmacht]] landing party, after he discovered the truth upon seeing a German [[U-boat]] appear in a nearby bay. However, the platoon help to rescue him with the aid of their wives, and manage to capture the landing party and Rose, causing the U-boat to flee. Cunningham and Meeks swiftly arrest her, ensuring her intelligence doesn't return, while Theakes commends the platoon, saving them from being disbanded. Mainwaring and Wilson reconcile, and both men join their platoon for a parade through Walmington-on-Sea.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Toby Jones]] as [[Captain George Mainwaring|Captain Mainwaring]]\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as [[Sergeant Arthur Wilson|Sergeant Wilson]]\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Rose Winters\n* [[Tom Courtenay]] as [[Lance-Corporal Jones]]\n* [[Blake Harrison]] as [[Private Frank Pike|Private Pike]]\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Private Charles Godfrey|Private Godfrey]]\n* [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]] as [[Private James Frazer|Private Frazer]]\n* [[Daniel Mays]] as [[Private Walker]]\n* [[Sarah Lancashire]] as [[List of Dad's Army characters#Mrs. Mavis Pike|Mrs Pike]]\n* [[Mark Gatiss]] as Colonel Theakes\n* [[Mark Tandy (actor)|Mark Tandy]] as Major Cunningham, MI5\n* [[Andrew Havill]] as Captain Meeks, MI5\n* [[Emily Atack]] as Daphne\n* [[Alison Steadman]] as [[Mrs Fox]]\n* [[Holli Dempsey]] as Vera Shilton\n* [[Annette Crosbie]] as Cissy Godfrey\n* [[Ian Lavender]] as Brigadier Pritchard\n* [[Frank Williams (actor)|Frank Williams]] as [[List of Dad's Army characters#The Reverend Timothy Farthing MA (Oxon)|the Reverend Timothy Farthing]] (Credited only as 'The Vicar')\n* [[Felicity Montagu]] as Mrs Mainwaring\n* [[Martin Savage (actor)|Martin Savage]] as [[Chief ARP Warden Hodges|Warden Hodges]]\n* [[Oliver Tobias]] as [[Admiral Canaris]]\n* [[Julia Foster]] as Dolly Godfrey\n* [[Jacqueline Tong]] as Mrs Todd\n{{Div col end}}\n\n[[Ian Lavender]] makes a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] as Brigadier Pritchard, providing a link with the original series,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11246784/Pictured-Ian-Lavender-plays-cameo-role-in-new-Dads-Army-film.html|title=Pictured: Ian Lavender plays cameo role in new Dad's Army film|website=The Telegraph|date=21 November 2014|access-date=8 May 2016}}</ref> and [[Frank Williams (actor)|Frank Williams]] reprises his role as the vicar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/dads-army-star-frank-williams-7252185|title=Dad's Army star Frank Williams: It was extraordinary playing scenes with the characters again|author=Boudicca Fox-Leonard|website=Mirror|date=26 January 2016|access-date=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe regular series character of the verger Maurice Yeatman was not recreated for the film.
