Filmed from a screenplay by Altman and Frank Barhydt, it is inspired by nine [[Short story|short stories]] and a poem by [[Raymond Carver]]. The film has a [[Los Angeles]] setting, which is substituted for the [[Pacific Northwest]] backdrop of Carver's stories. ''Short Cuts'' traces the actions of 22 principal characters, both in parallel and at occasional loose points of connection. The role of chance and luck is central to the film, and many of the stories concern death and infidelity.\n\nThe film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Matthew Modine]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Anne Archer]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Madeleine Stowe]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Lori Singer]], [[Andie MacDowell]], [[Buck Henry]], [[Lily Tomlin]], actress and singer [[Annie Ross]], and musicians [[Huey Lewis]], [[Lyle Lovett]], and [[Tom Waits]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=October 2021}}\nA fleet of helicopters sprays for [[medfly|medflies]] and reveals all the characters along the path of their flight. Dr. Ralph Wyman and his wife, Marian, meet another couple, Stuart and Claire Kane\u2013an out-of-work salesman and a party clown respectively\u2013at Zoe Trainer's cello concert and make a spontaneous Sunday dinner date.\n\nMarian's sister, Sherri, is married to philandering cop Gene, who invents unbelievable stories to hide his affair with Betty Weathers. Betty is in the process of divorcing one of the helicopter pilots, Stormy. Waitress Doreen Piggot is married to an alcoholic limo driver, Earl.\n\nTelevision commentator Howard Finnigan lives with his wife, Anne, and their young son, Casey, next door to Zoe and her mother, cabaret singer Tess. Their pool cleaner is Jerry Kaiser, whose wife, Lois, works from home as a phone sex operator, tending to the children while she talks off strange men. Jerry and Lois are friends with Doreen's daughter, Honey, and her husband, Bill, who works as a makeup artist.\n\nThe day before Casey's eighth birthday, Doreen hits him with her car as he is running to school. Casey appears fine and refuses Doreen's offer of a ride home, as she is a stranger. His mother Anne comes home from ordering his birthday cake to find him slumped lethargically on the couch. His father Howard convinces her to take Casey to the hospital, where he remains unconscious. The baker, Andy Bitkower, calls the next day to inform Ann that the cake is ready, but Howard, wanting to keep the line free, briskly ends the conversation. The baker immediately calls back, incensed at being hung up on. While the Finnigans maintain their vigil, Bitkower continues to call and harass the couple. Howard's estranged father Paul turns up at the hospital and recalls that Casey's hospitalization reminds him of the day that Howard was in a car accident as a boy. When Howard's mother went to her sister's house, she found her undressed in the presence of her husband, who she was attempting to seduce. That led to the estrangement between father and son.\n\nStuart and his two friends, Gordon and Vern, harass Doreen at the diner before they head out on their three-day fishing trip. On the first day, they find a young woman's body, submerged near some rocks. After some debate, they decide to tie her to the rocks, continue fishing, and report the body when they are done. When he comes home, Stuart eventually admits to Claire what they had done, and she is disgusted that they could fish for days with the woman's body nearby. The body is identified as a 23-year-old woman who was raped and murdered, and Claire visits the funeral home out of a sense of guilt.\n\nStormy visits Betty's house while she is away with their son Chad (Jarrett Lennon), ostensibly to pick up his mother's clock, but instead spends the day destroying her belongings. Bill and Honey entertain themselves in the apartment that they are watching while its owners are on vacation by taking some pictures of Honey in which Bill has made her up to look as if she has been brutally beaten. Gene abandons the family dog on a strange street because he cannot endure its barking, but after several days of his distraught children's inquiries, he returns to the neighbourhood and retrieves the dog, who has been picked up by Vern's family. The Wymans get into a massive argument just before their dinner party with the Kanes. Marian admits to an affair. Both couples alleviate their stress by drinking heavily, and the party lasts all night long.\n\nOne day, Casey's eyes begin to flutter. Anne's excitement grows, but just as he appears to be waking, he suddenly dies. Seeing that and being overwhelmed, Howard's father and the boy's grandfather, Paul, leaves the hospital while the distraught couple returns home and informs Zoe of Casey's death. The next day, they go to the bakery to shame Bitkower over his abuse of them. When he learns why they never picked up the cake, he asks them to stay and gives them baked goods. Zoe, worn to the breaking point by her mother's alcoholism, the little boy's death and her isolation, commits suicide by starting her car engine inside the garage; she plays the cello as she asphyxiates from carbon monoxide. Later that day, her mother discovers Zoe dead and drinks herself into a stupor.\n\nWhen Honey picks up the pictures from the fotomat, they are mixed up with Gordon's. He is horrified to see the pictures of Honey, who appears to have been beaten badly, and she is horrified by the pictures Gordon took of the submerged body on his fishing trip. They walk away from each other, memorizing each other's license plates. While at a picnic in the park with their wives and kids, Jerry and Bill meet two young women they encountered earlier, and Bill quickly makes an excuse to divvy up into couples. As he and one of the girls walk away from Jerry and the other girl (Susie Cusack), they hear her scream. They turn around to see Jerry hitting her in the head repeatedly with a rock, killing her, just before a major earthquake strikes. In the aftermath, it appears that Jerry's murder of the girl may be attributed to a rock falling during the earthquake.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Ann Finnigan\n* [[Bruce Davison]] as Howard Finnigan\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as Marian Wyman\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Dr. Ralph Wyman\n* [[Anne Archer]] as Claire Kane\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Stuart Kane\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Lois Kaiser\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Jerry Kaiser\n* [[Lili Taylor]] as Honey Piggot Bush\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Bill Bush\n* [[Madeleine Stowe]] as Sherri Shepard\n* [[Tim Robbins]] as Gene Shepard\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as Doreen Piggot\n* [[Tom Waits]] as Earl Piggot\n* [[Frances McDormand]] as Betty Weathers\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as Stormy Weathers\n* [[Annie Ross]] as Tess Trainer\n* [[Lori Singer]] as Zoe Trainer\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Paul Finnigan\n* [[Lyle Lovett]] as Andy Bitkower\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Gordon Johnson\n* [[Huey Lewis]] as Vern Miller\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as Wally Littleton\n* [[Michael Beach]] as Jim Stone}}\n\n==Production==\nAccording to associate producer Mike Kaplan, the screenplay was first written in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/21/short-cuts-altman-mike-kaplan|title=Bob Altman's big Short Cuts gamble|first=Mike|last=Kaplan|date=21 October 2009|access-date=25 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> Filming primarily took place in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].
