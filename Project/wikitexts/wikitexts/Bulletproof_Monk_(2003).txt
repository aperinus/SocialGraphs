Forgoing his name, the monk is entrusted with guarding a scroll with the power to keep whoever possesses it powerful, young, and immune to injury, yet could bring about disaster in the wrong hands. The monk is forced to flee when Nazi German soldiers, led by Colonel Strucker, attack his temple and murder his master.\n\nSixty years later, the nameless monk witnesses a young pickpocket named Kar fleeing from police, as well as members of a local gang who do not like him pickpocketing on their turf. When the pair collide with a young girl and put her into the path of an oncoming train, Kar and the monk rescue her. After the pair introduce themselves, Kar steals the scroll from the monk and runs away. The monk pursues Kar, believing he may have fulfilled the first prophecy. When Kar finds himself fighting the local gang's leader, he meets a roguish young woman among them named Jade, whom he falls in love with.\n\nThe following day, Jade attends a museum exhibition where she meets the director of the organization; a woman who is later revealed to be Strucker's young and equally vile granddaughter, Nina. Using the museum as a cover, Nina secretly spearheads Strucker's ongoing hunt for the scroll. Later, Jade chances upon Kar being lectured by the monk and asks him to return her necklace, which he had stolen to earn her esteem. The meeting is interrupted when the monk is forced to run from Strucker's mercenaries, dragging Kar along with him.\n\nWith Kar's help, the monk arrives at a laundromat that secretly houses a group of monks who provide him shelter, and the monk offers to train him as thanks. Later, while training in an abandoned warehouse, Strucker's mercenaries come down on them in force. In the ensuing chase, Kar accidentally drops the scroll from the rooftop, where it is taken by a delighted Nina; however, she later discovers the scroll is a fake. The monk reveals to Kar that the scroll's true text has been tattooed onto his body all along. Angered, Nina visits Kar's home to track the pair down, murdering his employer.\n\nThe monk abandons Kar out of shame, but Kar, filled with newfound purpose, reunites with him at the laundromat. The pair are forced to flee when an ambitious monk betrays their location on Nina. The monks are taken to Strucker's secret facility beneath the museum, where they are forced into Strucker's memory-extracting torture devices; the monk who betrayed them is killed.\n\nSeeking help, Kar and the monk visit Jade at her home, learning that she is the daughter of an imprisoned crime lord. The monk realizes that this fact, coupled with a small scuffle between Kar and Jade inside the house, has fulfilled the second prophecy. A moment later, Nina and her men breach the windows, shooting the monk with a tranquilizer dart and taking him back to the museum. Recognizing Nina from that morning, Jade surmises where the monk was taken and chooses to help rescue him. Meanwhile, Nina suggestively scans the monk's tattoos and inputs the compiled text into Strucker's computer.\n\nStrucker begins reading from the scroll but is interrupted when Jade and Kar breach the gates and launch an explosive attack, wiping out most of Strucker's guards. The pair then make their way into the facility through an underground water main, where they become separated. Jade is intercepted in the sewers by a smug and cavalier Nina, overconfident due in part to her ignorance of Jade's fighting skill. In the ensuing melee, Jade outmaneuvers Nina and breaks her leg with a well-placed kick, following up with a well-deserved beating before taking up the crippled Nina from behind and snapping her neck.\n\nStrucker, dressed in his old uniform, regains his youth after reading from the scroll; however, he finds that the scroll's last verse, which the monk reveals he memorized, is missing. Before Strucker can scan the monk's brain for it, Kar arrives and distracts him, allowing the monk to break free. While Jade works to free the other monks, the nameless monk fights Strucker alongside Kar, knocking him off of the roof and onto live electrical wires.\n\nBelieving that Strucker has been dealt with, the pair reunites with Jade. The contents of the scroll transfer to Kar, as he has fulfilled the third prophecy. Strucker, still alive, attempts to kill Kar but is killed himself by a falling statue. Kar is surprised to find Jade alive after seemingly being shot by Strucker; like Kar, she also fulfilled the three prophecies, and the scroll's power transferred to her as well, thus making both of them a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] of the scroll. The monk, now aged, meets with Kar and Jade the next day, giving each one half of the final verse, deeming them inseparable. The pair wish him a good vacation from his duties before departing to fulfill their new roles.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as Monk with No Name\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Kar\n* [[Jaime King]] as Jade \"Bad Girl\" Kerensky\n* [[Karel Roden]] as Strucker\n* [[Victoria Smurfit]] as Nina Strucker\n* [[Roger Yuan]] as Brother Tenzin\n* [[Mako (actor)|Mako]] as Mr. Kojima\n* Marcus Jean Pirae as \"Funktastic\"\n\n== Production ==\nIn May 2000, it was announced MGM had paid high six figures against a potential seven-figure deal to turn the cult comic \u201cBulletproof Monk\u201d into a live-action film that would star Chow Yun-fat as the title character with John Woo and Terence Chang\u2019s Lion Rock Productions producing.<ref name=\"ChowWooZenLion\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/chow-woo-putting-zen-in-lion-s-den-1117781466/|title=  Chow, Woo putting Zen in Lion\u2019s den |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 23, 2021}}</ref> Seann William Scott was cast in November 2001.<ref name=\"ScottMonkMGM\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/scott-will-don-monk-robe-for-mgm-1117856053/|title=   Scott will don \u2018Monk\u2019 robe For MGM  |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=July 23, 2021}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film grossed approximately $23 million in the United States, with a worldwide total of $37 million, less than the production budget of $52 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web | url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bulletproofmonk.htm | title=Bulletproof Monk (2003) | work=Box Office Mojo | publisher=Amazon| access-date=2010-06-01 }}</ref>\n\n=== Critical response === \n{{Anchor|Critics|Critical reception}}\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of {{RT data|score}} based on {{RT data|count}} reviews.
