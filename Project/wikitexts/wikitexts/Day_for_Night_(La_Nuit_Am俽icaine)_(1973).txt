The original French title, '''''La Nuit am\u00e9ricaine''''' (\"American Night\"), refers to the French name for the filmmaking process whereby sequences filmed outdoors in daylight are shot with a filter over the camera lens (a technique described in the dialogue of Truffaut's film) or also using [[film stock]] balanced for tungsten (indoor) light and underexposed (or adjusted during post-production) to appear as if they are taking place at night. In English, the technique is called [[day for night]].\n\nThe film premiered out of competition at the [[1973 Cannes Film Festival]] and won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] the following year.<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2290/year/1973.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Day for Night |access-date=18 April 2009 |publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926005005/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2290/year/1973.html |archive-date=26 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Day for Night'' chronicles the production of ''Je Vous Pr\u00e9sente Pam\u00e9la'' (''Meet Pamela'', or literally ''I Introduce You to Pamela''), a clich\u00e9d [[melodrama]] starring aging screen icon Alexandre, former diva S\u00e9verine, young heartthrob Alphonse and British actress Julie Baker, who is recovering from both a nervous breakdown and the controversy over her marriage to her much older doctor.\n\nIn between are several vignettes chronicling the stories of the crew members and the director, Ferrand, who deals with the practical problems of making a film. Behind the camera, the actors and crew experience several romances, affairs, break-ups and sorrows. The production is especially shaken up when one of the supporting actresses is revealed to be pregnant. Later, Alphonse's lover leaves him for the film's stuntman, which leads Alphonse into a palliative one-night stand with an accommodating Julie; thereupon, mistaking Julie's pity for true love, the infantile Alphonse informs Julie's husband of the affair. Finally, Alexandre dies on the way to hospital after a car accident.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as Julie Baker\n* [[Valentina Cortese]] as S\u00e9verine\n* [[Dani (singer)|Dani]] as Liliane\n* [[Alexandra Stewart]] as Stacey\n* [[Jean-Pierre Aumont]] as Alexandre\n* [[Jean Champion]] as Bertrand\n* [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]] as Alphonse\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] as Ferrand, the director\n* [[Nike Arrighi]] as Odile\n* [[Nathalie Baye]] as Jo\u00eblle\n* Maurice S\u00e9veno as TV reporter\n* [[David Markham]] as Dr. Nelson\n* [[Bernard M\u00e9nez]] as Bernard, the prop man\n* Gaston Joly as Gaston\n* [[Z\u00e9na\u00efde Rossi]] as Madame Lajoie\n* [[Xavier Saint-Macary]] as Christian, Alexandre's lover\n* Jean Panisse as Arthur (uncredited)\n* [[Claude Miller]] as hotel guest invited to cast dinner (uncredited)\n* Christophe Vesque as boy in Ferrand's dream (uncredited)\n* Marcel Berbert as insurer (uncredited)<ref>{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Don |title=Finally Truffaut |location=New York |publisher=[[Beaufort Books]] |year=1985 |page=234 |isbn=978-0-8253-0335-7}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Cast notes:'''\n* Author [[Graham Greene]] makes a cameo appearance as an insurance company representative, billed as \"Henry Graham\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/jul/25/philip-french-10-best-movie-cameos | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=The 10 best movie cameos | first=Philip | last=French | date=25 July 2010}}</ref> On the film's DVD, it was reported that Greene was a great admirer of Truffaut, and had always wanted to meet him, so when the small part came up where he actually talks to the director, he was delighted to have the opportunity. It was reported that Truffaut was disappointed he was not told until later that the actor playing the insurance company representative was Greene, as he would have liked to have made his acquaintance, being an admirer of Greene's work.\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on an original idea by Truffaut who said he wanted the picture to do for film what ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' did for books \"to show why it is good to love the cinema\". The film was shot in [[Nice]] on an enormous set for a Paris street originally built by an American company and used for ''[[Lady L]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot (film)|The Madwoman of Chaillot]]'' (1969). Truffaut got the idea while editing ''[[Two English Girls]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Bart |title=Tho audiences may be jaded, Truffaut will remain Truffaut |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=6 August 1972 |page=i13 |issn=1085-6706}}</ref>\n\nTruffaut used international actors because he felt French cinema did not have the mythological aspect he wanted. He said the film was influenced by ''[[The Golden Coach]]'' and ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (both 1952); the latter was his favourite film about filmmaking because it showed everyone involved in a film, not just the director and star.<ref name=\"los\">{{cite news |last=Blume |first=Mary |title=Movies: Francois Truffaut's Real Love Affair With Film-making |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=14 January 1973 |page=22 |issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\nBisset was cast in part because she spoke French. \"I was so flattered when he [Truffaut] called\", said Bisset. \"It's wonderful to work with someone who likes working with women\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Kramer |first=Carol |title=Movies: The decisive, decorative, diplomatic Miss Bisset |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=11 March 1973 |page=E6 |issn=1085-6706}}</ref>\n\nThe film was dedicated to the Gish sisters, whom Truffaut called \"the first two actresses of the cinema\"; he said the film was made in \"the spirit of friendship for all the people in the movie business\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Kramer |first=Carol |title=Movies: Truffaut on film, in sharp focus |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=7 October 1973 |page=E13 |issn=1085-6706}}</ref>\n\nTruffaut took a sabbatical after making the film.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sweeney |first=Louise |title=Profile: Francois Truffaut |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=18 June 1973 |page=7 |issn=0882-7729}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nOne of the film's themes is whether cinema is more important than life to those who make it. It makes many allusions both to filmmaking and to movies themselves, perhaps unsurprisingly since Truffaut began his career as a film critic who championed cinema as an art form. The film opens with a picture of [[Lillian Gish|Lillian]] and [[Dorothy Gish]], to whom it is dedicated. In one scene, Ferrand opens a package of books he has ordered on directors such as [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Ernst Lubitsch]], [[Roberto Rossellini]] and [[Robert Bresson]]. The film's French title could sound like ''L'ennui am\u00e9ricain'' (\"American boredom\"): Truffaut wrote elsewhere of the way French cinema critics inevitably make this pun of any title that uses ''nuit''. Here, he deliberately invites his viewers to recognise the artificiality of cinema, particularly American-style studio film, with its reliance on effects such as day for night, that ''Je Vous Pr\u00e9sente Pam\u00e9la'' exemplifies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Truffaut |first=Fran\u00e7ois |author-link=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |title=Hitchcock by Truffaut: The Definitive Study |edition=updated |publisher=[[Paladin Books|Paladin]] |year=1986 |pages=111\u2013112 |isbn=978-0-5860-8653-7}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film is often considered one of Truffaut's best.
