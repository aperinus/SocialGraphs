It was written by Philip and Belinda Haas with [[A. S. Byatt]] after her 1992 novella ''[[Morpho Eugenia]]'' (included in her book ''Angels and Insects''). The film received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\nWilliam Adamson ([[Mark Rylance]]), a [[natural history|naturalist]], returns to [[Victorian England]], staying with his benefactor, Sir Harold Alabaster ([[Jeremy Kemp]]), a wealthy [[Baronet]]. He has lost his possessions in a [[shipwreck]], returning from an extended expedition to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. Now dependent upon his patron, William is employed to catalog Sir Harold's specimen collection and teach his younger children the natural sciences, assisting their governess, the unassuming Matty Crompton ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]).\n\nWilliam becomes enamoured of Sir Harold's eldest daughter, Eugenia ([[Patsy Kensit]]). Eugenia is softly spoken, anxious, and mourning the recent death of her fianc\u00e9. Despite his impoverishment, Eugenia proves receptive and accepts his marriage proposal. Although Sir Harold grants his approval, Eugenia's snobbish and spoilt brother, Edgar, ([[Douglas Henshall]]) dislikes William's humble origins.\n\nSoon after the marriage, Eugenia becomes pregnant. Eugenia's behaviour alternates between coldness, locking William out of her room, and intense sexual passion. The couple has four more children. She calls the one son, 'Edgar', in the family tradition, annoying William. He spends much of his time with the Alabaster children and Matty, observing an [[ant colony]] in the forest, with a view to writing a book. Returning via the stables from an excursion, William discovers Edgar raping a teenage servant. Edgar tells William that she consented, but she is clearly terrified. William forms a bond with Matty, who encourages his scientific activities and displays a strong intelligence. The book is successfully published.\n\nOne day, William is summoned from the hunt to the house by a servant who claims Eugenia wants him. Entering the bedroom, he finds Eugenia and Edgar engaging in [[incest]]uous sex. Eugenia confesses that this has occurred since childhood and that her fianc\u00e9 committed suicide in consequence. She says that when it started she was too young to understand but, after she saw herself through the eyes of her fianc\u00e9, she felt guilty. In tears, Eugenia explains that she tried to stop, but that Edgar's will was too strong. William realises that he has been used to conceal the incest and that the children (who bear no resemblance to him) are Edgar's.\n\nMatty reveals her knowledge of the affair to William during a [[Scrabble]]-like game. Later, she explains that the servants were also aware and arranged for him to find out. Expressing frustration at her life and dependency on the Alabasters, Matty reveals that she has published her own book on the insects and has bought tickets for a ship for the Amazon. William is reluctant; despite his attraction, he feels that the [[rain forest]] is unsuitable for a woman. After she assures him of her strength and love for him, William acquiesces.\n\nBefore leaving, William meets Eugenia and tells her he intends never to return but will continue to financially support their children. He also promises to keep her secret, for fear of injuring her ailing father, and hopes she may find a way to live with her guilt. William and Matty depart in a coach for [[Liverpool]], eager to begin their new adventure and leave the past behind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mark Rylance]] as William Adamson\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] as Matty Crompton\n* [[Patsy Kensit]] as Eugenia Alabaster Adamson\n* [[Jeremy Kemp]] as Sir Harald Alabaster\n* [[Douglas Henshall]] as Edgar Alabaster\n* [[Annette Badland]] as Lady Alabaster\n* [[Chris Larkin]] as Robin\n* [[Anna Massey]] as Miss Mead\n* [[Saskia Wickham]] as Rowena Alabaster\n* Lindsay Thomas as Lady Alabaster's Maid\n* [[Michelle Sylvester]] as Margaret Alabaster\n* [[Clare Lovell]] as Elaine Alabaster\n* Jenny Lovell as Edith Alabaster\n* [[Oona Haas]] as Alice Alabaster\n* [[Angus Hodder]] as Guy Alabaster\n* [[John Veasey]]  as Arthur\n\n==Production==\nThe film was made on location at [[Arbury Hall]] in [[Nuneaton, Warwickshire]], the home of the [[Francis FitzRoy Newdegate, 3rd Viscount Daventry|3rd Viscount Daventry]].<ref>{{cite AV media| title=Angels and Insects End Credits| publisher=Sony Pictures Classics| date=1995}}</ref> The costumes worn by Kensit and the other actresses were designed in bright colors and bold patterns to evoke the appearance of insects, which would earn the film an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112365/awards | title=Awards | publisher=IMDb | access-date=2017-05-08}} {{unreliable?|date=July 2019}}</ref> In the marriage proposal scene, Patsy Kensit's gown was treated with [[Sex steroid|female sex hormones]] to attract the moths to her. 6,000 ants were brought in initially for the forest colony scenes, but they walked off before filming.
