Starring [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Justin Long]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Seann William Scott]] and [[John Cleese]], the film follows an astronaut who lands on an alien planet, as one of the aliens helps him return to his ship while evading the military.\n\nAn [[co-production (media)|international co-production]] by Spain, United Kingdom, United States, and Canada, with the studios [[Ilion Animation Studios]] based in Madrid, and [[HandMade Films]] in London, the film was originally acquired for [[United States|North American]] distribution by [[New Line Cinema]], but then sold to [[Sony Pictures]] before completion.<ref name=\"lumiere\">{{cite web|title=Planet 51 (EN)|url=http://lumiere.obs.coe.int/web/film_info/?id=32228|website=Lumiere|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Planet 51 (2009) |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8d88c642 |website=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=28 August 2022}}</ref><ref name=VarietyNewLine /><ref name=VarietySonyOrbit /> Originally titled ''Planet One'',<ref name=TrailerAddict>[http://www.traileraddict.com/content/new-line-cinema/planet51.jpg *\"Planet One Poster\"] from ''TrailerAddict'', 12 December 2007.</ref> and later named as an allusion to [[Area 51]], the film was completed on a $70 million budget, which, as of 2010, was the most expensive film produced in Spain.<ref name=DeadlineSpanishLaw>{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Tim|title=New Spanish Film Law Bad for Hollywood|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/04/new-spanish-film-law-bad-for-hollywood/|access-date=17 December 2013|newspaper=Deadline|date=4 April 2010}}</ref> \n\n''Planet 51'' was released on 20 November 2009 in the United States and Canada by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]'s [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[Remstar Media Group|Remstar Media Partners]] respectively, on 27 November in Spain by DeAPlaneta Distribuci\u00f3n, and 4 December in the United Kingdom by [[HandMade Films International]]. The film grossed $105.6 million in the worldwide box office. It received generally negative reviews from critics, but earned the [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] in Spain.\n\n== Plot ==\nOn Planet 51{{#tag:ref|The name of the planet is never mentioned in the film, only the title suggests what it's called.|group=N}}, green extraterrestrials live peacefully in a society reminiscent of the United States during the [[1950s]], although the planet's and their nature provide notable differences from [[Earth]] and, notably, ignorance about [[astronomy]] leads to believing that the whole Universe extends for almost 500 miles.\n\nOne day, a mysterious spacecraft lands in the city of Glipforg. [[NASA]]{{#tag:ref|Although the NASA logo is shown in the film, posters and covers show a fictional \"Space Agency\" logo.|group=N}} astronaut Charles \"Chuck\" Baker emerges from it and is shocked to find the planet inhabited. Panicked, Chuck escapes to the town's [[planetarium]], where he meets teenage alien Lem, who works there part-time. Chuck convinces Lem to help return him to his spacecraft before command module ''Odyssey'' in Planet 51's orbit departs for Earth in three days and leaves him stranded. Planet 51's army, led by the paranoid General Grawl, arrives to inspect and deduces that the astronaut is an alien invader bent on turning the planet's population into [[zombie]]s, similar to how invaders are depicted in media, and a [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] ensues.\n\nLem enlists the help of his best friend Skiff, an eccentric [[science fiction]] aficionado with [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about the so-called \"Base 9\" (Planet 51's equivalent of [[Area 51]]), to hide Chuck away from the army. During his efforts to conceal Chuck, Lem inadvertently upsets his neighbor and crush Neera, who believes the alien is friendly, and is also fired from his job when his boss discovers Chuck. In Lem's room, Chuck reunites with a dog-like NASA probe called [[Rover (space exploration)|Rover]], which freed itself from the army's base after tracking Chuck with a GPS and headed for the city and which befriends a small, domesticated [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorph]]. After the army searches Lem's home for traces of the alien, Lem and Skiff move Chuck to a comic book store Skiff works at, where the news station manages to capture Chuck acting out references to Earth's pop culture, which is misinterpreted as alien threats. After escaping the store from the invading army, Grawl has Chuck's spacecraft moved to a secret location. Chuck is later captured by Grawl's forces during a festive movie premiere in town, and is slated to have his brain removed by alien scientist Professor Kipple. When Lem defends Chuck, Kipple deems him a zombie minion. Resigned to his fate, Chuck pretends to release Lem from his \"mind control\" and is taken away with Rover to Base 9.\n\nLem gets his job back, but is determined to rescue Chuck. Joined by Skiff, Neera, her younger brother Eckle, and Rover, Lem tracks down Base 9's location in the desert to a gas station where Skiff inadvertently opens a gate to the underground base. They free Chuck from Kipple and find his spacecraft, but they are cornered by Grawl and his forces. Bent on eliminating the human, Grawl reveals he has the base rigged to explode. Lem attempts to reason with The General to not shoot Chuck but inadvertently activates the countdown. Enraged, Grawl attempts to shoot Lem, but Eckle tosses a hook to him and ignites an explosive, causing him to be trapped under debris. Chuck rescues him before launching his spacecraft into Planet 51's orbit, escaping Base 9's destruction. After admiring Planet 51's view from space, Lem successfully asks Neera out on a date, while Grawl expresses his gratitude to Chuck for saving him. Chuck returns his friends home and allows Rover to stay behind with Skiff, who has bonded with the probe, and bids Lem and the rest of the town farewell before launching back into space, but the last seconds of the film reveal that the little Xenomorph pet befriended by Rover is on board.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Kipple climbs out of the underground base, but is taken back to his own lab for [[brain surgery]] by two of his own patients, whom he wrongly deemed to be mind controlled by Chuck earlier in the movie. Meanwhile, Chuck is stuck being licked by the alien pet as he comments that 'this is going to be a long trip'.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Justin Long]] as Lem Kerplog, a teenage boy living in Glipforg on Planet 51.\n** Long also voices Rover, a robotic vehicle probe that studies the planet (mostly rocks).\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Captain Charles T. \"Chuck\" Baker, a human NASA-astronaut.\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as Neera, a teenage girl and Lem's love interest.\n* [[Seann William Scott]] as Skiff, Lem's best friend, who works at a comic-book store.\n* Freddie Benedict as Eckle, Neera's younger brother.\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as General Grawl of the Army of Planet 51, who fear an alien invasion.\n* [[John Cleese]] as Professor Kipple, a scientist and Grawl's right-hand man.\n* [[Mathew Horne]] as Soldier Vesklin, a gullible soldier.\n* [[James Corden]] as Soldier Vernkot, another gullible soldier.\n* [[Alan Marriott (voice actor)|Alan Marriott]] as Glar, a ukulele-playing hippie.\n* [[Rupert Degas]] as Chief Gorlock.\n\n== Production ==\n''Planet 51'' is based on the original idea by Jorge Blanco, Marcos Mart\u00ednez, Ignacio P\u00e9rez Dolset and Javier Abad.

They made contact with the film's producers early on to resolve the trademark and brand confusion issues. The Spanish film company behind it, Ilion Animation Studios, made an offer to the existing entity for all ownership rights to their \"Planet One\" trademarks and related website URLs. Planet One chose not to take that offer and to protect their brand and trademarks that had been active for many years. As a result, the film's producers chose to rename the film ''Planet 51'': a reference to the top-secret military base, [[Area 51]], where [[conspiracy theorist]]s claim that data and specimens from a [[space alien]] that landed on Earth in 1947 are stored.\n\nThe character of Lem was named by screenwriter [[Joe Stillman]] after Polish science-fiction writer [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]]. Since the film was intended to be a parody of American [[pulp magazine|pulp]] science fiction shot in Eastern Europe, Stillman thought it would be hilarious to have the name hint about a writer whose works have nothing to do with \"[[little green men]]\" stereotypes.<ref>[http://wyborcza.pl/duzyformat/1,127290,7504865,Lem_wsrod_zielonych_ludzikow.html Lem w\u015br\u00f3d zielonych ludzik\u00f3w]</ref>\n\n== Release ==\nIn November 2007, [[New Line Cinema]] had picked up the United States distribution rights; the studio itself was to release the film in the summer of 2009.<ref name=VarietyNewLine>{{cite news|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=New Line lands on 'Planet 51\u2032|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/new-line-lands-on-planet-51-1117976579/|access-date=17 December 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=27 November 2007}}</ref> However, [[TriStar Pictures]] became the film's home after [[New Line Cinema]] sold the rights to them through [[Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group]].<ref name=VarietySonyOrbit /> According to the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, New Line Cinema's owner, [[Time Warner|Warner]], \"decided to let the pic go after the producers insisted on a November release, when Warner is releasing its [[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (film)|sixth Harry Potter pic]].\"<ref name=VarietySonyOrbit /> The new distributor moved the U.S. release date from the summer of 2009 to November of that year.<ref name=VarietySonyOrbit>{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana|last2=McNary|first2=Dave|title='Planet 51\u2032 heads into Sony orbit|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/news/planet-51-heads-into-sony-orbit-1117988625/|access-date=17 December 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=8 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe movie was released in the US on 20 November 2009.\nThe movie was then released a week later in Spain, on 27 November 2009, where it was distributed by DeAPlaneta.\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was released by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on 9 March 2010; it would also see various other rereleases alongside other animated and/or family films by Sony Pictures afterwards, including as part of a triple pack with ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' and ''[[The Pirates!
