It stars [[Emilio Estevez]], [[Kiefer Sutherland]], [[Lou Diamond Phillips]], and [[Christian Slater]], and features [[William Petersen]] as [[Pat Garrett]]. It was written by [[John Fusco]] and directed by [[Geoff Murphy]].\n\nIt follows the life of [[Billy the Kid]] (played by Emilio Estevez), in the years following the [[Lincoln County War]] in which Billy was part of \"The Regulators\"&nbsp;\u2013 a group of around six highly skilled gunmen avenging the death of [[John Tunstall]]&nbsp;\u2013 and the years leading up to Billy's documented death. The film, however, is told by [[Ollie P. Roberts|Brushy Bill Roberts]], a man who in 1950 appeared claiming to be the real Billy the Kid.\n\nWhile the film takes some creative license, it does show some of the main events leading up to Billy's documented death, including his talks with Governor [[Lew Wallace]], his capture by friend-turned-foe Pat Garrett, his trial, and his subsequent escape in which he killed two deputies.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1950, attorney Charles Phalen is contacted by an elderly man named \"Brushy Bill\" Roberts. Brushy Bill tells Phalen that he is dying and wants to receive a pardon that he was promised 70 years before by the governor of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], claiming that he is really William H. Bonney aka \"Billy The Kid\", whom \"everyone\" knows to have been shot and killed by [[Pat Garrett]] in 1881. Phalen then asks if Bill has any proof that he is the famous outlaw.\n\nBrushy Bill's story begins with the remaining Regulators having gone their separate ways. Billy has become part of a new gang with \"Arkansas\" [[Dave Rudabaugh]] ([[Christian Slater|Slater]]) and [[Pat Garrett]] ([[William L. Petersen|Petersen]]). The New Mexico governor has issued warrants for the arrests of those involved in the Lincoln County Wars, including Billy, Doc Scurlock ([[Kiefer Sutherland|Sutherland]]), and Jose Chavez y Chavez ([[Lou Diamond Phillips|Phillips]]), who are dragged into town and imprisoned to await hanging.\n\nMeanwhile, Billy meets with the new governor Lew Wallace who agrees to pardon Billy if he testifies against the Dolan-Murphy faction. Billy soon finds out that he was tricked into being arrested with no chance of testifying against his old enemies. After escaping, Billy along with the help of Rudabaugh and Garrett, pose as a lynch mob to spring Doc and Chavez from jail. When the gang successfully escape Lincoln, Billy mentions the Mexican Blackbird (a broken trail only a few others and he know that leads to Mexico). Garrett decides not to go with the gang, and instead, opens a boarding house. Rudabaugh, clearly in competition with Billy, wants to lead the gang. As they make a run for the border along with farmer Hendry William French ([[Alan Ruck]]) and 14-year-old Tom O'Folliard ([[Balthazar Getty]]), cattle baron John Simpson Chisum ([[James Coburn]]) and Governor Wallace approach Garrett to offer him the job as [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]] [[sheriff]] and $1000 to use whatever resources he needs to hunt Bonney down and kill him. Garrett agrees, and forming a posse, begins his pursuit of the gang. Chisum was approached by Billy earlier in the film, and Chisum refused to help. So, Billy steals some of his cattle to get money they can use to get to Mexico.\n\nBilly and the gang soon come to the town of White Oaks, where they meet with former companion, Jane Greathouse ([[Jenny Wright]]), who runs a local [[Brothel|bordello]]. Later that night, the town lynch mob comes for the gang and is intent on a hanging. Deputy Carlisle tries to negotiate a deal, \"the Indian\" (Chavez) for a safe ride out. Billy refuses the offer and pushes the deputy out the door, who is then accidentally killed by the lynch mob. Garrett soon tracks Billy to the bordello, but is too late. In response to rebuffs by Jane, Garrett uses his newfound power as Lincoln County sheriff to declare her bordello a \"house of sin\", and burns it down. Jane decides to strip naked to humiliate the townsfolk and leave town. Meanwhile, Billy and his gang are continuously tracked by Garrett's posse, narrowly evading capture, but Tom (being mistaken for Billy) is soon shot dead by Garrett. As they hide out, Billy admits that the Mexican Blackbird does not exist; it was just a ruse to get the gang back together and to keep riding. Doc is angered and tries to leave for home, but he is shot by one of Garrett's men and sacrifices himself to enable his friends to escape an ambush.\n\nBilly the Kid is soon brought back into Lincoln by Garrett and is sentenced to death by hanging. He is then visited by Jane Greathouse, who arranges to leave a pistol in an outhouse. Billy uses the pistol to kill two guards and escapes to Old [[Fort Sumner]]. By the time he arrives, Dave has abandoned the group to make his way to Mexico, and Chavez is dying from a bullet wound he sustained during the ambush that killed Doc. During the night, Garrett finds Billy unarmed. Billy asks Garrett to let him run to Mexico and tell the authorities that he killed him. Garrett declines because he believes Billy would not be able to resist coming back to the United States (which would lead to Garrett's death for lying). Billy turns around, forcing Garrett to have to shoot him in the back, which he does not. In the morning, a fake burial is staged for Billy, and Garrett's horse is seen being taken by an unknown figure (implied to be Billy). Brushy Bill admits he never stole a horse from someone he did not like, and further admits he did not just like Garrett, he loved him. Phalen, convinced that Brushy Bill is Billy the Kid, agrees to help him.\n\nThe epilogue reveals that Arkansas Dave was beheaded once he reached Mexico to discourage more outlaws from crossing the border; Garrett's book detailing his pursuit of Billy was a dismal failure and he is eventually shot and killed in 1908; Brushy Bill met with the governor of New Mexico, but despite corroboration from several surviving friends of the Kid, he was discredited and died less than a month later; whether or not Brushy Bill was Billy the Kid remains a mystery. The final shot shows Billy pointing his gun at an off-screen target, saying to the target \"I'll make you famous\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Emilio Estevez]] as [[Billy the Kid|William H. \"Billy the Kid\" Bonney]] and [[Ollie P.

Fusco also appears as the \"Branded Man\" in the prison pit escape scene alongside [[Jon Bon Jovi]]. The cattle brand on Fusco's face reads J.C. for cattle rancher John Chisum.\n\nJohn Chisum, played by [[James Coburn]], in the film convinces Pat Garrett to accept a job as the new Lincoln County Sheriff. Coburn himself played Garrett in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973).\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nThe historical [[Doc Scurlock|Josiah \"Doc\" Scurlock]] lived to the age of 80 and died a respectable man in Eastland, Texas in 1929.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://truewestmagazine.com/doc-scurlock-2/|title = The Real Doc|date = May 31, 2019}}</ref> The film's original screenplay accurately portrays Scurlock as heading to Texas with his bride. It has been reported that [[Kiefer Sutherland]], faced with scheduling conflicts, refused to return to the Young Guns franchise unless his character died in the movie's \"Stinking Springs Shoot Out\". Writer [[John Fusco]] fought against this demand but ultimately rewrote the scene to accommodate Sutherland's schedule.\n\nSimilarly, [[Jos\u00e9 Chavez y Chavez]]'s death in the movie is also an inaccurate portrayal. The real Chavez y Chavez also lived to be an old man and passed away at the age of 72 in 1924. In both Young Guns I and II, he fights mainly with knives but historical records show that he was as skilled a gunman as the others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.desertusa.com/desert-people/chavez.html|title=Jos\u00e9 Chavez y Chavez DesertUSA}}</ref><ref>See also Lou Diamond Phillips audio commentary on Young Guns DVD</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Tom O'Folliard]] was indeed shot by Pat Garrett, he was not from Pennsylvania and nor was he a young boy.
