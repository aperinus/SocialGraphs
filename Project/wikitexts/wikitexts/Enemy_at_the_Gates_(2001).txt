Forced into a suicidal charge without a rifle, he hides while a tank shell incapacitates a car. The occupant, [[Political commissar in the Soviet Union|Commissar]] Danilov, hides among numerous bodies, coincidentally next to Vasily, who uses his exceptional marksmanship to kill the German soldiers nearby.\n\n[[Nikita Khrushchev]] demands ideas from his subordinates on morale. Danilov, now a senior lieutenant, suggests that the people need \"an example to follow\" and recommends Zaitsev for the job. Soon after, Danilov begins publishing heroic tales of Vasily's exploits in the army's newspaper. Vasily is transferred to the [[sniper]] division and becomes friends with Danilov. Both also become romantically interested in [[Tania Chernova]], a private in the local militia. In fear for her safety, Danilov has her transferred away to an intelligence unit, ostensibly to make use of her [[German language|German]] skills in translating radio intercepts.\n\nWith the Soviet snipers taking an increasing toll on the German forces, German Major [[Erwin K\u00f6nig]] is deployed to kill Vasily and crush Soviet morale. When the Red Army command learns of K\u00f6nig's mission, they dispatch K\u00f6nig's former student Koulikov to help Vasily kill him. K\u00f6nig, however, outmaneuvers Koulikov and kills him, shaking Vasily's spirits. Khrushchev pressures Danilov to bring the sniper standoff to a conclusion. Sasha, a young Soviet boy, volunteers to act as a [[double agent]] by passing K\u00f6nig false information about Vasily's whereabouts. Vasily sets a trap for K\u00f6nig and manages to wound him with help of Tania, who has come to rescue Vasily. During a second attempt, Vasily falls asleep, and his sniper log is stolen by a looting German soldier. The German command takes the log as evidence of Vasily's death and plans to send K\u00f6nig home, but K\u00f6nig does not believe that Vasily is dead.\n\nThe German general takes K\u00f6nig's dog tags to prevent Soviet propaganda from profiting if K\u00f6nig is killed. K\u00f6nig gives the general a [[War Merit Cross]] that was posthumously awarded to K\u00f6nig's son, who was a lieutenant in the [[116th Infantry Division (Germany)|116th Infantry Division]] and killed in the early days of the battle. K\u00f6nig tells Sasha where he will be next, suspecting that the boy will tell Vasily. Tania and Vasily have meanwhile fallen in love. That night, Tania secretly goes to the Soviet barracks and makes love with Vasily. The jealous Danilov disparages Vasily in a letter to his superiors.\n\nK\u00f6nig spots Tania and Vasily waiting for him at his next ambush spot, confirming his suspicions about Sasha. He then kills the boy and hangs his body to bait Vasily. Vasily vows to kill K\u00f6nig and sends Tania and Danilov to evacuate Sasha's mother. Tania is wounded by shrapnel en route to the boats. Thinking she is dead, Danilov regrets his jealousy of Vasily and expresses disenchantment over his previous ardour for communism. Finding Vasily waiting to ambush K\u00f6nig, Danilov intentionally exposes himself in order to provoke K\u00f6nig into shooting him and revealing his position, sacrificing his life. Thinking that he has killed Vasily, K\u00f6nig goes to inspect the body and is then in Vasily's sights. Accepting his fate, K\u00f6nig turns to face Vasily, who shoots him squarely in the eye and takes his rifle. Two months later, after Stalingrad has been liberated and German forces have surrendered, Vasily finds Tania recovering in a [[field hospital]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)|Vasily Zaitsev]]\n** Alexander Schwan as young Vasily\n* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as [[Commissar]] Danilov\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Tania Chernova]]\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Nikita Khrushchev]]\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Major [[Erwin K\u00f6nig]]\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as Koulikov\n* [[Eva Mattes]] as Mother Filippova\n* [[Gabriel Marshall-Thomson]] as [[Sasha Filippov]]\n* [[Matthias Habich]] as General [[Friedrich Paulus]]\n* [[Sophie Rois]] as Ludmilla\n* [[Ivan Shvedoff]] as Volodya\n* Mario Bandi as Anton\n* [[Gennadi Vengerov]] as Starshina\n* Mikhail Matveyev as Grandfather\n* [[Clemens Schick]] as Voigt\n* Hans Martin Stier as General Prudius\n* [[Gennadi Vengerov]] as Kushnir\n* [[Robert Stadlober]] as Spotter\n* [[Holger Handtke]] as Baumann\n* [[Werner Daehn]] as Anosov\n* [[Birol \u00dcnel]] as Kuklin\n* [[Valentin Platareanu]] as General [[Arthur Schmidt (soldier)|Arthur Schmidt]]\n* [[Tom Wlaschiha]] as Soldier\n* [[Lenn Kudrjawizki]] as Comrade in Train\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe filming of ''Enemy of the Gates'' took place in Germany. The crossing of the [[Volga River]] was shot on the [[Lusatian Lake District|Altd\u00f6berner See]], a man-made lake near the village of [[Altd\u00f6bern|Pritzen]], in the south of [[Brandenburg]]. A derelict factory in the village of [[R\u00fcdersdorf]] was used to recreate the ruins of Stalingrad's tractor factory.

It was a former ''Wehrmacht'' riding school that had served as a Soviet barracks during the [[Cold War]].

While in the film there appears two women snipers, they never shoot at anyone when in fact Soviet women snipers have been credited with killing over ten thousand enemies in combat.<ref name=\"Reese 2014\"/>\n\nThe film's first scene shows new Soviet troops, including Zaitsev, arriving at the Stalingrad front, where they are screamed at, threatened, and in general humiliated by their commanders. They are then transported and locked in crowded boxcars to stop them from deserting. According to military historian [[Boris Yulin]], this was forbidden and is unrealistic to have really happened, as the soldiers would have been killed in case of a German air raid or shelling.<ref name=\"Timofeychev 2019\"/> According to historian Alexey Isaev, who has written several books about the Battle of Stalingrad, [[blocking detachments]] were mostly used in Stalingrad as \"usual combat regiments\", while the film emphasizes the message that \"most Soviet soldiers needed a literal gun in the back in order to go into battle\". As there were many cases of heroism, it is argued it was unlikely that Soviet soldiers were motivated only by fear.<ref name=\"Timofeychev 2019\"/> In regards to lack of weapons, which happened early in the war and changed by 1942, Isaev said: \"There were no unarmed soldiers sent to the attack...
