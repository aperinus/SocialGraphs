Retrieved: October 27, 2010.</ref>  While it received negative reviews, being unfavorably compared to the similarly-themed ''[[Top Gun]]'' released the same year, the film earned $24,159,872 at the U.S. box office. ''Iron Eagle'' was followed by three sequels: ''[[Iron Eagle II]]'', ''[[Aces: Iron Eagle III]]'', and ''[[Iron Eagle on the Attack]]'', with Gossett being the only actor to appear in all four films.<ref>Orriss 2018, p. 180.</ref>\n\nThe basis of the story relates to real life attacks by the United States against [[Libya]] over the [[Gulf of Sidra]], in particular the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|1981 Gulf of Sidra incident]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nDoug Masters, son of veteran [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilot Col. Ted Masters, is a hotshot civilian pilot, hoping to follow in his father's footsteps. His hopes are dashed when he receives a notice of rejection from the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]]. Making matters worse is the news that his father has been shot down and captured by the fictional Arab state of Bilya while patrolling over the [[Mediterranean Sea]].\n\nDespite the incident occurring over [[international waters]], the Arab state's court finds Col. Masters guilty of trespassing over their territory and sentences him to [[Hanging|hang]] in three days. Seeing that the U.S. government will do nothing to save his father's life, Doug decides to take matters into his own hands and come up with his own rescue mission. He requests the help of Col. Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair, a [[Vietnam veteran]] pilot currently in the [[Air Force Reserve]], who, while not knowing Col. Masters personally, had a favorable run-in with him years prior to meeting Doug and \"knew the type.\" Chappy is skeptical at first; but Doug convinces him that, with his friends, he has full access to the airbase's intelligence and resources and can give him an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 fighter]] for the mission. To Doug's surprise, Chappy had already begun planning a rescue operation himself after he learned the outcome of Col. Masters' trial. The combined efforts of Chappy and Doug's team result in a meticulously planned mission and the procurement of two heavily armed F-16B jets, with Doug flying the second unit.\n\nOn the day of Col. Masters' scheduled execution, Doug and Chappy fly their jets to the Mediterranean Sea and cross into Bilyan airspace. The Bilyan military responds, and in the ensuing battle Doug and Chappy take out three [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]] fighters and destroy an airfield, with Chappy's plane being hit by anti-aircraft fire. He tells Doug to climb to a high altitude and play the tape he made him the night before, then his engine fails, and Doug listens as Chappy's fighter goes down. Chappy's recorded voice gives Doug encouragement and details that help him to complete the mission and rescue his father. Making the enemy believe he is leading a [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]], Doug threatens the enemy state into releasing his father for pickup.\n\nBefore Doug lands his F-16, Col. Masters is shot by a sniper, causing Doug to destroy the airbase and engulf the runway with [[napalm]] to keep the army at bay while he lands and picks up his wounded father. Just as they take off, Doug and his father encounter another group of MiGs led by Col. Akir Nakesh, himself an [[ace pilot]]. The lone F-16 and Nakesh's MiG engage in a [[dogfight]] until a missile from Doug finishes off Nakesh. Low on fuel and ammunition, the F-16 is pursued by the other enemy MiGs when a squadron of U.S. Air Force F-16s appear, warding off the MiGs before escorting Doug and his father to [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[West Germany]].\n\nWhile Col. Masters is being treated for his wounds, Doug is reunited with Chappy, who had ejected from his plane and was picked up by an [[Egypt]]ian [[fishing trawler]]. The two are summoned by an Air Force judiciary panel for their reckless actions. Seeing that any form of punishment for the duo would expose an embarrassing lapse in Air Force security, the panel forgoes prosecution as long as Doug and Chappy never speak of their operation to anyone. In addition, Chappy convinces the panel to grant Doug admission to the Air Force Academy. Days later, a plane assigned by the President returns to the U.S., reuniting Doug, Chappy, and Col. Masters with family and friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] as Colonel Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair\n* [[Jason Gedrick]] as Doug Masters\n* [[David Suchet]] as Ministry of Defense Colonel Akir Nakesh\n* [[Shawnee Smith]] as Joenie\n* [[Melora Hardin]] as Katie\n* [[Larry B.

Furie]], the film's working title was ''Junior Eagle''. The script was turned down by every studio before it was picked up by Joe Wizan, former head of [[20th Century Fox]]. Wizan then handed the script to producer [[Ron Samuels]], who likened it to the old [[John Wayne]] westerns.<ref name=\"L.A. Times\"/> Pre-production work began in late 1984.<ref>Orris 2018, p. 180.</ref>\n\nAlthough their F-16s are featured in the movie poster, the [[United States Air Force]] has a long-standing policy about not cooperating on any film involving the theft of an aircraft.<ref>Powell, Larry. \"The Making of Iron Eagle.\" ''Air Classics'', Volume 22, No. 2, February 1986, p. 72.</ref> Consequently, the filmmakers turned to the [[Israeli Air Force]] for the necessary aerial sequences. The filming in [[Israel]] took six weeks, with the flight sequences choreographed by Jim Gavin, whose earlier works include ''[[Blue Thunder]]''.<ref name=\"L.A. Times\"/>\n\nFilming took place at both California and Israeli locales. To simulate the above-ground facilities of a typical USAF base, a combination of hangars and barracks at [[Camarillo, California|Camarillo]] and the [[Planes of Fame Air Museum]] at [[Chino, California]] were employed. Most Israeli airbases are situated in underground hangars, maintenance shops and crew quarters.<ref>Powell, Larry. \"The Making of Iron Eagle.\" ''Air Classics'', Volume 22, No. 2, February 1986, p. 73.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft used for both the American and the Bilyan air forces were Israeli jets: single-seat F-16As, two-seat F-16Bs, and [[IAI Kfir|F-21/C-2 Kfir]]s simulating MiG-23s, painted with fictional national markings.<ref>Beck 2016, p. 122.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The F-16s were given American national roundels and tail codes that only superficially resembled actual USAF markings, but retained their Israeli desert camouflage, a paint scheme that has never been used on USAF F-16s.|group=N}} {{#tag:ref|The cockpit displays depicted in the film were all simulated, and did not bear any resemblance to an early model F-16's actual instrumentation (with the exception of the heads-up display, which was somewhat accurate).|group=N}} The \"Hades\" bomb employed by Masters against the Bilyan airfield was a fictional weapon, although its effects were similar to real-life [[napalm]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\nThe character of Colonel Charles \"Chappy\" Sinclair was likely inspired by the real life U.S. Air Force General [[Daniel James Jr.|Daniel \"Chappie\" James, Jr]]. James was a member of the famed all-black [[Tuskegee Airmen]], and also flew fighter jets in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He later became the first black four-star general in U.S. history.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Iron Eagle (soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack album was issued by [[Capitol Records]] on LP and cassette, and later on compact disc.
