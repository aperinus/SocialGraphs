The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Kevin Kline]], [[Joan Allen]], [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Glenn Fitzgerald]], [[Jamey Sheridan]], and [[Sigourney Weaver]]. Set during [[Thanksgiving]] 1973, ''The Ice Storm'' is about two dysfunctional [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], upper-class families who are trying to deal with tumultuous social changes of the early 1970s, and their [[escapism]] through alcohol, adultery, and sexual experimentation.\n\nThe film opened in the United States on September 27, 1997. Its limited release ultimately grossed US$8&nbsp;million on a budget of US$18&nbsp;million. Critical response to the film was positive, and it was selected to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]]. Schamus received the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Screenplay]], and Weaver won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet over [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend, 1973, the film centers around two families: \n* the Hoods (Ben and Elena and their children, Paul and Wendy) \n* their neighbors, the Carvers (Jim and Janey, and their children, Mikey and Sandy)\n\nBen Hood (dissatisfied in his marriage, and with the futility of his career) is having an affair with Janey Carver. His wife, Elena, is bored with her own life, and looking to expand her thinking (though unsure of how to do so). The young Wendy Hood enjoys sexual games with the Carver boys and with her school peers. Paul Hood has fallen for Libbets, a classmate, at the boarding school he attends. (His roommate Francis is also interested in her.)\n\nOn [[Black Friday (shopping)|the Friday night after Thanksgiving]], the Hoods have an argument, upon her learning of his affair with Janey. Nevertheless they go ahead with their plans to attend a neighborhood party. It turns out to be a \"[[Group sex#Keyparty|key party]]\", in which married couples \"swap\" sexual partners, by means of each woman selecting a set of keys, from a bowl to which each man has contributed one set.\n\nJim and Janey Carver also are there; as the party progresses, Ben becomes drunk. Janey chooses the keys of a handsome young man. This surprises Ben and he trips, knocking his head on the coffee table. In his [[embarrassment]], he retreats to the bathroom, remaining there for the rest of the evening.\n\nThe other key party participants are paired off and leave, until only Jim and Elena remain. She retrieves Jim's keys from the bowl and returns them to him. After debating the issue, Jim and Elena leave together, engaging in a quick, clumsy sexual encounter in the front seat of Jim's car. Jim \u2013 regretting the line that he and Elena have just crossed \u2013 offers to drive her home.\n\nWendy decides to make her way to the Carvers' to see Mikey, but he has decided to go out into the ice storm; she and Sandy climb into bed together and remove their clothes. After they drink from a bottle of vodka, and Wendy tries to seduce him, they both fall asleep.\n\nPaul is invited to Libbets' apartment in Manhattan, though upon arriving, is disappointed to learn that Francis was also invited. The three drink beer and listen to music; Francis and Libbets also take prescription pills found in Libbets' mother's medicine cabinet, causing them, eventually, to  pass out. Paul decides to leave, and just narrowly makes the train to [[New Canaan]], [[Connecticut]].\n\nMeanwhile, Mikey, out walking in the storm, is enchanted by the beauty of the trees and fields covered in ice. He slides down an icy hill then sits on a guardrail to rest. A moment later a power line is broken by a falling tree, and connects with the guardrail, electrocuting him.\n\nJim and Elena also become stuck, due to a downed tree, and return to the Carvers' house as dawn is breaking; Elena walks in on her daughter and Sandy in bed, and tells her to get dressed; Janey returns home; curling up  in the fetal position, on her bed, still in her party clothes.\n\nBen, having sobered up by this time, begins driving home. He discovers Mikey's body on the side of the road, and carries it back to the Carvers' house. The two families are drawn together by Mikey's death, and Wendy hugs the shocked and numbed Sandy in an attempt to comfort him. Jim is devastated, while Janey remains asleep and oblivious to the recent events. Ben, Elena, and Wendy then drive to [[New Canaan station|the train station]] to pick up Paul, whose train was delayed by the ice and by the power failure caused by the downed wire. Once all four are together in the car, Ben breaks down, sobbing uncontrollably at the wheel as Elena comforts him while Paul watches with no emotions.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Ben Hood\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Elena Hood\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Wendy Hood\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as Paul Hood\n* [[Jamey Sheridan]] as Jim Carver\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Janey Carver\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Mikey Carver\n* [[Adam Hann-Byrd]] as Sandy Carver\n* [[Henry Czerny]] as George Clair\n* [[Michael Cumpsty]] as Philip Edwards\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Francis Davenport\n* [[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]] as Dorothy Franklin\n* [[Katie Holmes]] as Libbets Casey\n* [[Glenn Fitzgerald]] as Neil Conrad\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dot Halford\n* [[Larry Pine]] as Dave Gorman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Ice Storm'' was first brought to the attention of producer [[James Schamus]] by his wife, literary scout [[Nancy Kricorian]], who knew [[Rick Moody]] from [[Columbia University]]'s MFA program. Schamus has said, \"It's an astonishingly cinematic book... But, because of its truly literary qualities, people may have missed its extraordinary cinematic possibilities.\"<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/theicestorm |title=''The Ice Storm'' |publisher=Fox Searchlight |access-date=2012-08-02}}.</ref> Philosopher [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] has stated that Schamus was also inspired by one of \u017di\u017eek's books{{Which|date=August 2015}} at the time of writing the screenplay: \"When James Schamus was writing the scenario, he told me that he was reading a book of mine and that my theoretical book was inspiration.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqpxT_iJ8Mc |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211213/OqpxT_iJ8Mc |archive-date=2021-12-13 |url-status=live|title=Slavoj \u017di\u017eek - DVD Picks|last=criterioncollection|date=September 26, 2014|access-date=October 8, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nSchamus brought the book to filmmaker [[Ang Lee]], who was the first and only contender to turn the book into a film, and with whom Schamus and partner Ted Hope had already made four films, including ''[[The Wedding Banquet]]'' in 1993. Despite the obvious appeal of Moody's comedy of familial errors, Lee stated that what attracted him to the book was its climax: the scene where Ben Hood makes a shocking discovery in the ice, followed by the emotional reunion of the Hood family on the morning after the storm. \"The book moved me at those two points\", says Lee. \"I knew there was a movie there.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nTo prepare for the film, Lee let the cast members study stacks of magazine cutouts from the early 1970s. Moody was reportedly very pleased with the final version \u2013 and reportedly \"sobbed\" during the end credits.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} He also expressed his happiness that the success of the film brought more attention to his novel, leading to more book sales.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\nThe film's release was limited, and it grossed US$7.8 million against a production budget of US$18 million.<ref>{{mojo title|icestorm|The Ice Storm}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Critical response}}\nFilm critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film \"Two Thumbs Up\", with Ebert calling it Lee's best work yet, and Siskel calling it his favorite film of 1997. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 86% based on 70 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Director Ang Lee revisits the ennui-laden decadence of 1970s suburban America with deft humor and gripping pathos\".<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|ice_storm|The Ice Storm}} Retrieved on September 30, 2022.</ref> [[Andrew Johnston (critic)|Andrew Johnston]], writing in ''[[Time Out New York]]'', stated: \"The 1970s have long been written off as a goofy embarrassment to our country, quite possibly because the actual details of the decade are too painful to us to remember, no matter how old or young we were at the time. Ang Lee's film of Rick Moody's novel cuts through the kitsch to explore the emotional black hole at the heart of the period, the result being an utterly devastating and truly adult drama of the first order.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Andrew|date=October 2, 1997|title=The Ice Storm|journal=Time Out New York|pages=70}}</ref>\n\nThe film was entered into the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]], where [[James Schamus]] won the award for [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Screenplay]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4799/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Ice Storm |access-date=September 21, 2009|work=Festival-cannes.com}}</ref> He was nominated for three other awards: [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay \u2013 Adapted]] at the [[51st British Academy Film Awards]], [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] at the [[50th Writers Guild of America Awards]], and [[Satellite Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay, Adapted]] at the [[2nd Golden Satellite Awards]].
