It also features [[Gene Kelly]], [[Dick York]], [[Harry Morgan]], [[Donna Anderson]], [[Claude Akins]], [[Noah Beery Jr.]], [[Florence Eldridge]], and [[Jimmy Boyd]].\n\nThe script was adapted by [[Nedrick Young]] (originally as Nathan E.

Another television [[Inherit the Wind (1988 film)|remake]] which starred [[Jason Robards]] and [[Kirk Douglas]] aired in 1988. Once again, it was [[Inherit the Wind (1999 film)|remade]] for television in 1999, co-starring [[Jack Lemmon]] as Drummond and co-starring [[George C. Scott]] as Brady.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the small Southern town of Hillsboro, in the 1920s, a school teacher, Bertram Cates, is about to stand trial for teaching [[Darwinism]], which is a violation of state law. Cates is denounced by town leaders including Reverend Jeremiah Brown.\n\nThe town is excited because Matthew Brady, a noted statesman and three-time presidential candidate, will be assisting in the prosecution of Cates. A staunch foe of [[evolution]] and a Biblical scholar, Brady will sit beside prosecuting attorney Tom Davenport, in the courtroom of Judge Coffey.\n[[File:Inherit the Wind trial.jpg|thumb|left|Spencer Tracy, Harry Morgan, and Fredric March during the questioning of Brady by Drummond]]\nThe teacher's defense is to be handled by the equally well-known Henry Drummond, one of America's most controversial legal minds and a long-standing acquaintance and adversary of Brady. An influential newspaperman, E.K. Hornbeck of the ''Baltimore Herald'', has persuaded Drummond to represent Cates, and ensured that his newspaper and a radio network will provide nationwide coverage of the case.\n\nRev. Brown publicly rallies the townspeople against Cates and Drummond. The preacher's daughter Rachel is conflicted because she and Cates are engaged. When Rachel cries out against her father's condemnation, Brady admonishes Brown by quoting [[Proverbs 11:29]]: \"He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind.\"\n\nThe courtroom takes on a circus atmosphere with radio broadcasting, newspaper photography and spectator outbursts during the trial. Each time Drummond calls a scientist or authority figure to discuss Darwin's theories, the judge sustains the prosecution's objections and forbids such testimony, ruling that Cates, not evolution, is on trial. Drummond grows frustrated, feeling the case has already been decided. When he asks to withdraw from the case, the judge holds Drummond in [[contempt of court]], orders him jailed, and tells Drummond to [[show cause]] the next morning why he should not be held in contempt of court. John Stebbins offers his farm as collateral for Drummond's [[bail]]. Stebbins' son was a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Cates who drowned after developing a cramp while swimming. Brown had said the child was damned to hell because he was not baptized. This led to Cates abandoning the church, as he felt it was not fair that a child could not enter Heaven due to an action that was beyond his control.\n\nThat night, mocking crowds go by the jail and then to the hotel where Drummond is staying. Drummond is trying to decide how to present his defense without his witnesses and states that he needs a miracle. Hornbeck throws him a Bible from Brady, stating \"There are plenty in there.\" As Hornbeck pours some drinks and turns to Drummond, he is surprised by Drummond holding the Bible and smiling.\n\nDrummond calls Brady himself to the witness stand. Brady's confidence in his Biblical knowledge is so great that he welcomes this challenge, but becomes flustered under Drummond's cross-examination, unable to explain certain Biblical events, until he is forced to confess that at least some Biblical passages cannot be interpreted literally. Drummond hammers home his point \u2014  that Cates, like any other man, demands the right to think for himself, and those citing divine support as a rationale to silence him are wrong.\n\nThe jury finds Cates guilty, but, the judge, concerned with political embarrassment, fines him only $100 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100|1925|fmt=c}}}} in current dollars). Brady is furious and tries to enter a speech into the record, but Drummond persuades the judge to disallow it as the trial has concluded. As court adjourns, Brady tries to give his speech but most ignore him outside of his wife and his opponents at the defense table \u2014 Cates, Rachel, Hornbeck, and Drummond. As he becomes increasingly hysterical, he suffers a \"busted belly\" and dies.\n\nAfter the crowd has cleared out, Hornbeck talks with Drummond, wanting to use the Bible quotation from Brown's rally, where Brady had quoted the \"inherit the wind\" verse because Rev. Brown was about to damn his own daughter to hell. Drummond quotes the verse verbatim, shocking Hornbeck, who states, \"Well, we're growing an odd crop of agnostics this year!\" They argue over Brady's legacy, Drummond accuses Hornbeck of being a heartless cynic, and Hornbeck walks out, leaving Drummond alone in the courtroom. Drummond picks up the Bible and Darwin's book (''[[On the Origin of Species]]''), balancing them in his hands before walking out with both of them.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Spencer Tracy]] as Henry Drummond (patterned after [[Clarence Darrow]])\n*[[Fredric March]] as Matthew Harrison Brady (patterned after [[William Jennings Bryan]])\n*[[Gene Kelly]] as E.

The characters of Matthew Harrison Brady, Henry Drummond, Bertram Cates and E. K. Hornbeck correspond to the historical figures of [[William Jennings Bryan]], [[Clarence Darrow]], Scopes, and [[H. L. Mencken]], respectively.

In a 1996 interview, Lawrence stated that the play's purpose was to criticize [[McCarthyism]] and defend [[intellectual freedom]].
