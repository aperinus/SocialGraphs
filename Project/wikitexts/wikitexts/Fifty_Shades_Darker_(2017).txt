Meanwhile, Ana begins a new job as an assistant to Jack Hyde, an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP) whose last three assistants all quit within only 18 months.\n\nAna runs into Christian at the opening of her friend Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez's photography exhibit. She is dismayed Christian bought all of Jos\u00e9's portraits of her. He wants her back and agrees to \u201cno rules, no punishments, and no more secrets\u201d terms. He also tells her that his birth mother was a crack-addicted sex worker.\n\nAs Jack and Ana head for an after-work drink, she is approached on the street by a young woman resembling her. Christian arrives at the bar and is cool towards Jack, then quickly departs with Ana. She dismisses Christian's warning about his reputation, and is annoyed that he is considering buying SIP. Jack tells Ana he expects her to accompany him on a New York book expo trip, but after speaking with Christian, she agrees not to go.\n\nShortly after, Ana again sees the same woman watching them from afar. Christian avoids answering about her identity, but later explains she is Leila Williams, a former submissive. After their contract ended, she wanted more, but he didn't. Leila married a man who later died, causing a nervous breakdown. She has been stalking him ever since.\n\nPrior to the Grey family's annual charity ball, Christian takes Ana to Esclava, a beauty salon owned by Elena Lincoln. A family friend, she is also Christian's former dominant who introduced him to the [[BDSM]] lifestyle by sexually assaulting him when he was a minor. Ana is furious that Christian took her there, and that they are business partners after all that. At the ball, Christian's sister Mia mentions that he was expelled from four different schools for brawling.\n\nChristian tells Ana that his biological mother overdosed and died. He was alone with her body for three days before being taken to the hospital where Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey worked; she cared for and later adopted the young boy. During the ball, Ana rebuffs Elena's demand that she leave Christian, warning Elena to stay away. Arriving home, she and Christian discover Leila has vandalized Ana's car.\n\nWhen Ana tells Jack she won't be attending the expo with him, he attempts to sexually assault her while they are alone at work, but she evades him and escapes. Christian exerts his influence to have Jack fired, and Ana is promoted to acting editor in his place. Christian asks Ana to move in with him and she agrees.\n\nAt Ana's apartment, Leila, there waiting for her, threatens her with a gun. Christian and his driver/bodyguard, Jason Taylor, enter and Christian disarms Leila by becoming her dominant once more. Ana, deeply disturbed seeing his need to be dominant, leaves, returning several hours later. Christian is furious at her unexpected absence, but Ana needs time to consider their relationship. He, distraught at the idea of Ana leaving him, submissively drops to his knees, confessing he is not a dominant, but a sadist who enjoys hurting women who look like his birth mother (like Ana). He insists he wants to change. Christian later proposes, but Ana needs time to consider this before accepting.\n\nChristian leaves on a business trip, piloting his own helicopter. An engine failure occurs over Mt. St. Helens, forcing him to ditch the craft in a heavily forested area. A massive search and rescue ensues. As Ana fearfully awaits news, he arrives home safely. Ana, realizing how much she loves him, accepts his marriage proposal.\n\nAt Christian's birthday, Elena accuses Ana of being a gold digger. Ana orders her to stop interfering. Christian overhears and dismissively tells Elena she taught him \"how to fuck\" <!-- Do not change or remove this part. Wikipedia is not censored (see WP:CENSORED) and this part is essential to the film and book series. Please take it to the talk page if you have concerns. --> while Ana taught him \"how to love\". Grace overhears the conversation and demands Elena leave for good; Christian also cuts all ties with her. Later that evening, Christian formally proposes to Ana, this time with a ring, and she accepts. As fireworks erupt in the sky, Jack Hyde watches the festivities from afar, silently swearing revenge against them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele\n* [[Jamie Dornan]] as Christian Grey\n* [[Eric Johnson (actor)|Eric Johnson]] as Jack Hyde, Ana's boss at SIP and stalker.\n* [[Eloise Mumford]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh, Anastasia's best friend and roommate, who is in a relationship with Christian's older brother, Elliot Grey.\n* [[Bella Heathcote]] as Leila Williams, one of Christian's former submissives.\n* [[Rita Ora]] as Mia Grey, Christian's adoptive younger sister.\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Carla Wilks, Anastasia's mother (Unrated Edition).\n* [[Luke Grimes]] as Elliot Grey, Christian's adoptive older brother.\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez, one of Anastasia's friends.\n* [[Max Martini]] as Jason Taylor, Christian's bodyguard and head of security.\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Jerry Roach, president of SIP.\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Elena Lincoln, Christian's business partner and former lover.\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Grace Trevelyan-Grey, Christian's adoptive mother.\n\n==Production==\n[[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and [[Focus Features]] secured the rights to the trilogy in March 2012,<ref>{{cite web |last=Fleming|first=Mike Jr. |url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/03/universal-pictures-and-focus-features-win-50-shades-of-grey/|title=Universal Pictures and Focus Features win ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]].

Once again, the story involves the on-and-off, tie-her-up, tie-her-down romance between Anastasia Steele (Ms. Johnson) and her billionaire boyfriend, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), a guy with sculptured muscles, expensive playthings and dreary issues. Stuff and kink happens: A gun is fired, a would-be rapist is punished and Anastasia is bound hand and foot. Mostly, she advances and retreats (repeat), mewls and moans, and registers surprise each time Christian tries to dominate her outside the bedroom, evincing the kind of stalkerlike behavior that usually leads to restraining orders.<ref>Manohla Dargis. The New York Times, Feb 9, 2017. [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/movies/review-fifty-shades-darker-dakota-johnson.html?_r=0].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRichard Brody of ''The New Yorker'' described the film as inferior to the first, and found fault in the change in directors, stating:\n\n<blockquote>Some of the greatest Hollywood melodramas (such as [[Douglas Sirk]]'s [[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|''Magnificent Obsession'']]) featured plotlines of an even more extravagant absurdity than that of ''Fifty Shades Darker''. Their extreme artifice became a framework for extreme ideas and extreme emotions, even in an era of extreme public reticence about what goes on in the bedroom. The freedom of the current age of sexual explicitness invites realms of characterization\u2014and of intimate imagination\u2014that the first film in the ''Fifty Shades'' series hints at and the second one utterly ignores. ''Fifty Shades Darker''{{'}}s indifference to its characters' identities, conflicts, and desires is matched by its indifference to its own cinematic substance. The film's bland impersonality is grotesque; its element of pornography isn't in its depiction of sex but in its depiction of people, of relationships, of situations that, for all their unusualness, bear a strong psychological and societal resonance. There's nothing wrong with ''Fifty Shades Darker'' that a good director couldn't fix.<ref>Richard Brody, ''The New Yorker'', Feb 9, 2017.
