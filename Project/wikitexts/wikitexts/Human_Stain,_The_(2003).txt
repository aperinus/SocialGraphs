Its screenplay, by [[Nicholas Meyer]], is based on the [[The Human Stain|novel of the same name]] by [[Philip Roth]]. The film stars [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Gary Sinise]], and [[Ed Harris]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 1990s, writer [[Nathan Zuckerman]] ([[Gary Sinise]]) has settled in a lakeside [[New England]] cabin following his second divorce and a battle with [[prostate cancer]]. His quiet life is interrupted by Coleman Silk ([[Anthony Hopkins]]), a former dean and professor of classics at local Athena College, who was forced to resign after being accused of making a [[racist]] remark in class. Coleman's wife died suddenly following the scandal, and he wants to avenge his loss of career and companion by writing a book about the events with Nathan's assistance.\n\nThe project is placed on the back burner when Coleman has an affair with Faunia Farley ([[Nicole Kidman]]), a considerably younger, semi-literate woman who supports herself by working menial jobs, including at the college. Their relationship is threatened by the faculty members who forced Coleman from his job and by Faunia's ex-husband Lester ([[Ed Harris]]), a mentally unbalanced [[Vietnam War]] veteran who blames her for the deaths of their children in an accident. Flashbacks of Coleman's life reveal to the audience his secret: he is an African-American who has \"[[passing (sociology)|passed]]\" as a white Jewish man for most of his adult life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Coleman Silk\n** [[Wentworth Miller]] as young Coleman Silk\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Faunia Farley\n* [[Gary Sinise]] as Nathan Zuckerman\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Lester Farley\n* [[Jacinda Barrett]] as Steena Paulsson\n* [[Mimi Kuzyk]] as Delphine Roux\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as Nelson Primus\n* [[Anna Deavere Smith]] as Dorothy Silk\n* [[Phyllis Newman]] as Iris Silk\n** [[Mili Avital]] as young Iris Silk\n* [[Harry Lennix]] as Clarence Silk\n* [[Tom Rack]] as Bob Cat\n* [[Lizan Mitchell]] as Ernestine Silk\n* Danny Blanco-Hall as Walter Silk\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Ellie\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Psychologist\n\n==Release==\nThe film debuted at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. It was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], the [[Bergen International Film Festival]], and the Hollywood Film Festival before its theatrical release in the US.\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed $5,381,908 in the US and $19,481,896 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $24,863,304 against a budget of $30 million.<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=humanstain.htm ''The Human Stain''] Box Office Mojo</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|Reception|Critics}}\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Human Stain'' received mixed reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 42% of 155 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.48/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Though the acting is fine, the leads are miscast, and the story is less powerful on screen than on the page.\"<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/human_stain/ \"The Human Stain\"], Rotten Tomatoes</ref>\n\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', A.O. Scott called it \"an honorable B+ term paper of a movie: sober, scrupulous and earnestly respectful of its literary source \u2026 The filmmakers explicate Mr. Roth's themes with admirable clarity and care and observe his characters with delicate fondness, but they cannot hope to approximate the brilliance and rapacity of his voice, which holds all the novel's disparate elements together. Without the active intervention of Mr. Roth's intelligence \u2026 the story fails to cohere \u2026 At its best \u2013 which also tends to be at its quietest \u2013 ''The Human Stain'' allows you both to care about its characters and to think about the larger issues that their lives represent. Its deepest flaw is an inability to link those moments of empathy and insight into a continuous drama, to suggest that the characters' lives keep going when they are not on screen.\"<ref>{{cite web |author= A.O.

Not many movies probe into matters of identity or adaptation. Most movie characters are like [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]] and [[comic book]] heroes: We learn their roles and powers at the beginning of the story, and they never change. Here are complex, troubled, flawed people, brave enough to breathe deeply and take one more risk with their lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-human-stain-2003|title=The Human Stain Movie Review & Film Summary (2003) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] called it \"a mediocre movie \u2026 [that] falls victim to a fatal lack of narrative drive, suspense and drama. Kidman and Hopkins are wrong for their roles, and that, combined with a pervading inevitability, cuts the film off from any sustained vitality. The result is something admirable but lifeless.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/10/31/DD231134.DTL|title='Human Stain' doesn't quite wash / Philip Roth adaptation a nice effort but ultimately unbelievable}}</ref>\n\n[[David Stratton]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as \"an intelligent adaptation of Philip Roth's arguably unfilmable novel powered by two eye-catching performances \u2026 A key problem Benton is unable to avoid is that Hopkins and Miller don't look (or talk) the least bit like one another. Miller, who gives a strong, muted performance, convinces as a light-skinned African-American in a way Hopkins never does, which is not to suggest that the Welsh-born actor doesn't give another intelligent, powerful portrayal. It's just that the believability gap looms large.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921675.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0|title=Review: 'The Human Stain'|first=David|last=Stratton|date=3 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] said, \"Hopkins and Kidman \u2026 are both as mesmerizing as they are miscast \u2026 ''The Human Stain'' is heavy going. It's the flashes of dramatic lightning that make it a trip worth taking.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/_/id/5947821/rid/5947822/|title=Movie Review|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] }}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Times]]'' of London called it \"sapping and unbelievable [[melodrama]] \u2026 an unforgivably turgid lecture about [[political correctness]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7943-971961,00.html|title=The Times & The Sunday Times}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n* [[American Film Institute Awards 2003|American Film Institute Award for Best Movies of 2003]] ('''winner''')\n* [[Washington D.C.
