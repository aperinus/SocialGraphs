It was filmed in [[70mm]] on location in [[Tanzania]]'s [[Serengeti National Park]] and [[Kenya]]'s [[Masai Mara]]. This documentary film is narrated by [[James Earl Jones]]. It was originally released to [[IMAX]] theaters in 1994.\n\nThe film features nature cinematography during a year at East Africa's [[Serengeti]] plain. The Serengeti is a huge area of grassland in Tanzania. Once a year, in time of drought, animals travel north in order to survive. This \"great migration\", an event in which millions of [[wildebeest]]s, [[zebra]]s, and [[antelope]] travel several hundred miles across the plain, while [[lion]]s and other dangers await them along the way, is considered one of the great wonders of the world.<ref>{{cite news | title = Film reviews| publisher = RottenTomatoes.com| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/imax_africa_the_serengeti/}}</ref>\n\n[[Hans Zimmer]], composer of ''[[The Lion King]]'' (where Jones lent his voice to Mufasa), contributed to the film soundtrack. Casey followed this film with another nature documentary, ''[[Alaska: Spirit of the Wild]]''.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0109049|Africa: The Serengeti}}\n* [http://www.mos.org/media/docs/1763_script-africa.pdf ''Movie Script''] from [http://www.mos.org/educators/field_trip_resources/field_trip_activities/imax&d=253 '' Museum of Science - Boston'']\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110518215933/http://www.aim4africa.com/great_migration.html Witnessing the Great Migration on Safari in Serengeti and Masai Mara]\n\n[[Category:1994 short films]]\n[[Category:1994 films]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:IMAX short films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Tanzania]]\n[[Category:Films set in Africa]]\n[[Category:Films set in Kenya]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about nature]]\n[[Category:1994 documentary films]]\n[[Category:IMAX documentary films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Hans Zimmer]]\n[[Category:Films about lions]]\n[[Category:Swahili-language films]]\n[[Category:The Lion King (franchise)]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{nature-documentary-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
