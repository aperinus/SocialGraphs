According to Strieber, the story is a real-life account of his own encounter with \"visitors\", with Walken playing the role of the author.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1985, New York based author Whitley Strieber [[Christopher Walken|(Walken)]] lives with his wife and child in Manhattan and seems to be successful.  However, he is woken at night by paranoid dreams that someone else is in the room.\n\nOn a trip to the family cottage in the woods, on the first night the intruder alarm is triggered and Strieber sees a face watching him from the doorway.  Bright light fills the cottage windows and wakes his son and two other family friends but his wife remains asleep.\n\nDisturbed by this they all return to New York and life seemingly returns to normal but Strieber finds that his work and personal life are becoming affected by recurring nightmares and visions of strange alien beings including [[Grey aliens|greys]], blue doctors and [[Insectoid aliens|bugs]]. This upsets his son and puts strain on his marriage.\n\nAfter an incident at their cottage in which Strieber is so convinced that there are alien beings inside the home that he pulls his gun out and almost shoots his wife, and signs that his son is beginning to have the same visions, he is finally convinced to see a psychiatrist specialising in [[hypnotic regression]] therapy [[Frances Sternhagen|(Sternhagen)]].\n\nThe therapy confirms that he has possibly been abducted by unknown beings and experiments have been performed on him; however, he is still skeptical about it and reluctantly attends a group therapy session of fellow 'abductees'.\n\nEventually he realizes he has to confront his visions, real or not, and returns to the cottage where most of the incidents seem to occur. He interacts with the alien beings and realizes he has been in contact with them his whole life and it was passed on from his father and he will, in turn, pass it on to his son.\n\nMaking up with his family Strieber comes to accept the alien visitors as part of his life and in the last scene he sits in his office and embraces the face of a 'grey' alien.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Whitley Strieber]]\n* [[Lindsay Crouse]] as Anne Strieber\n* [[Frances Sternhagen]] as Dr. Janet Duffy\n* [[Andreas Katsulas]] as Alex\n* Joel Carlson as Andrew Strieber\n\n==Reception==\nIt received a mostly negative reaction and was panned by Strieber himself due to its non-factual portrayal of him. The film was considered a box office failure. It has subsequently picked up a moderate cult following.{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}} On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 33% approval rating based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Communion |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/communion |access-date=April 2, 2022 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>\n\nSome critics praised Walken's performance as the highlight of the film. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called his performance \"terrific\" and added: \"Walken dazzles, giving us an intelligent, talented man caught in a nightmare and fearing for his sanity.\"<ref>{{cite web |date=10 November 1989 |author1=Kevin Thomas |title=MOVIE REVIEW : Walken Has Purported Close Encounter in 'Communion' |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-11-10-ca-984-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe score was composed by [[Eric Clapton]], though no official [[soundtrack album]] was ever released. In 2010, the Main Theme and End Credit theme were released by film composer and former [[Oingo Boingo]] guitarist [[Steve Bartek]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0097100|title=Communion}}\n* {{Amg movie|10589|Communion}}\n\n{{Philippe Mora}}\n{{Whitley Strieber}}\n\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:Alien abduction films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:1989 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Philippe Mora]]\n[[Category:Biographical films about writers]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1985]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Whitley Strieber]]\n[[Category:1980s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1980s American films]]"}]}}}}
