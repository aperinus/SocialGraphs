[[Beyonc\u00e9]] did not return for the sequel. [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] appears as the criminology expert Sonia Solandres. [[Andy Garc\u00eda]], [[Yuki Matsuzaki]] and [[Alfred Molina]] round out the cast as detectives, Italian Inspector Vincenzo Brancaleone, Japanese Inspector Kenji Mazuto and British Chief Inspector Randall Pepperidge. It was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on June 23, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen \u201cThe Tornado\u201d, a master thief, steals priceless artifacts from around the world, the French government assembles a \u201cDream Team\u201d of investigators to solve the case. Meanwhile, Inspector Clouseau is reassigned from his task as a parking officer by Chief Inspector Dreyfus to join the detectives in Japan, site of the Tornado's latest heist. After Clouseau crosses the borders of France, news breaks that the Pink Panther diamond has been stolen, prompting Clouseau to gloat that his presence has kept the diamond safe and that he had known it would happen all along.\n\nClouseau meets the other members of the Dream Team: Detective Randall Pepperidge from Great Britain; Vincenzo Brancaleoni from Italy; Kenji Mazuto, an electronics specialist from Japan; and Sonia Solandres, a researcher and criminology expert from India. The team then goes to Rome to investigate a black market fence, Alonso Avellaneda. Assuming Avellaneda is the Tornado, the Dream Team question him while Clouseau snoops around. Avellaneda demonstrates that he lacks a characteristic bullet wound the Tornado received years ago; after the detectives leave, Avellaneda then meets with the real Tornado.\n\nThat night, Clouseau and his partner Ponton spy on Avellaneda at a restaurant using an [[covert listening device|audio bug]]. The mission is compromised when they find Vincenzo and Nicole, Clouseau's girlfriend, together at the restaurant. Banned from the restaurant for burning it down months earlier, Clouseau disguises himself as a dancer and switches the bug to Nicole's table, burning down the restaurant again in the process. Meanwhile, the Tornado steals the [[Ring of the Fisherman|Pope's ring]], souring public opinion against the Dream Team.\n\nWhen Clouseau's incomptence aggravates the situation, he is voted off the team. Clouseau is later called to an office and finds that the Tornado has apparently killed himself, leaving a suicide note claiming he destroyed the Pink Panther \u2013 considering it so beautiful that he could not allow anyone else to own it \u2013 and left the other treasures to be recovered. Examining a key found in the Pope's Chambers, the Dream Team match the dead man's [[DNA]] with DNA recovered from when the Tornado was shot, and believe they have solved the case, but Clouseau remains unconvinced.\n\nA celebration is thrown in the Dream Team's honor, although Clouseau is uninvited. While wandering near the celebration, he realizes something after seeing the license plate of Sonia's car and calls Ponton. Clouseau tries to tell Dreyfus that the real thief is still at large, but is ignored. Dreyfus announces to the group that Clouseau believes Sonia was the thief, and the detectives jokingly work out a plausible explanation: as the Tornado's ex-lover, she would have in-depth knowledge of his methods, and could have drawn attention to the thefts of the other artifacts, leaving her free to sell the Pink Panther. Nicole, realizing Clouseau could be correct, asks Sonia to empty her purse. After initially trying to leave, Sonia ultimately pulls out a gun, threatening to shoot Nicole, before shooting Clouseau, but the bullet ricochets off his [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] medal. A chase ensues, with the Dream Team suffering due to various accidents caused by Clouseau's clumsiness.\n\nFinally cornered, Sonia threatens to destroy the Pink Panther and, goaded by Clouseau, she does. Before she can escape however, Sonia is knocked out by Ponton and arrested. Clouseau reveals that Sonia destroyed a fake gem, as Clouseau kept the real diamond in his possession in order to protect it, while the Pink Panther at the museum was swapped with a replica he was given before leaving France. Furthermore, The Tornado, an expert on gems, would have recognized the fake Pink Panther, allowing Clouseau to deduce that his suicide note was forged and that he was murdered. Clouseau then reveals that he had given a ticket to Sonia's car two days before the Pink Panther was stolen \u2013 contradicting her alibi of being delayed to the original crime scene by her flight \u2013 which confirmed to him that Sonia was the culprit and that she used the Dream Team as a strategic cover. Dreyfus tries to claim credit for having appointed Clouseau to his parking job, which Clouseau, remembering Dreyfus told him to deny this to anyone who asked, rebukes.\n\nLater, Clouseau marries Nicole in a ceremony officiated by Dreyfus and attended by the Dream Team, ending in chaos when Dreyfus accidentally destroys a security camera with a champagne cork, summoning the [[Black Berets]]. Clouseau and Nicole leave for their honeymoon as the animated Pink Panther watches, before closing the doors and winking at the camera.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Steve Martin]] as [[Inspector Jacques Clouseau]] <br />  A clumsy police officer and now-recognized \"Protector of the Pink Panther\", who joins the Dream Team to bring the Tornado to justice and recover the Pink Panther once more.\n* [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Sonia Solandres/The Tornado<br /> An Indian criminologist and a member of the Dream Team.
