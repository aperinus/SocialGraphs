The residents are curious about their new neighbour, Edwina, but information is not available about her, even for the leader of the place, Mrs. Doyle Counihan, whose son is busy attempting to attract Edwina. Miss O'Hare and Edwina immediately dislike each other, however, and soon some accidental encounters begin to look like Edwina is trying to ruin her new rival. The problems escalate and the town is in an uproar, but they get no closer to solving the mystery of the newcomer.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ed Sutton|title= Widows' Peak Summary |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111712/plotsummary|website=imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n== Production notes ==\n\nThe film was mainly shot on location in the counties of [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], [[County Dublin|Dublin]] and [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]]. The house used during production was that of Stonehurst, Killiney Hill Road, Co. Dublin. The concept for the film came from its co-producer [[Prudence Farrow]]. While it had been intended for her mother [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] to play the role of Miss O'Hare, the part went to O'Sullivan's daughter and Prudence's sister [[Mia Farrow]]. O'Sullivan declined the part due to her advanced age and dwindling stamina.\n\nSet in the 1920s, the film's period wardrobe needs were handled by [[Angels and Bermans]] as well as [[Costumi d'Arte]] and [[European Costume Company]]. [[Consolata Boyle]] was the costume designer.\n\nThe film grossed $6.2 million in U.S. theatrical release.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was well received by critics and the public. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said, the film \"uses understated humor and fluent, witty speech; it's a delight to listen to, as it gradually reveals how eccentric these apparently respectable people really are.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Widows' Peak|date=25 May 1994 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/widows-peak-1994|work=rogerebert.com}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1995, the actress [[Natasha Richardson]] received the [[Crystal Globe (Karlovy Vary International Film Festival)|Crystal Globe]] award at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]], Czech Republic, for her role in this film.
