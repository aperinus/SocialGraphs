Selznick]]. The [[screenplay]] was written by Selznick and an uncredited [[Ben Hecht]], from an adaptation by [[Alma Reville]] and [[James Bridie]] of the 1933 [[The Paradine Case (novel)|novel of the same title]] by [[Robert Smythe Hichens]].<ref name=imdb /> The film stars [[Gregory Peck]], [[Ann Todd]], [[Alida Valli]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Charles Coburn]], [[Ethel Barrymore]], and [[Louis Jourdan]]. It tells of an English [[barrister]] who falls in love with a woman who is accused of murder, and how it affects his relationship with his wife.\n\n==Plot==\nIn London, Maddalena Anna Paradine ([[Alida Valli]]) is a very beautiful and enigmatic young Italian woman who is accused of poisoning her older, blind husband, a wealthy retired colonel. It is not clear whether she is a grateful and devoted wife who has been falsely charged or a calculating and ruthless [[femme fatale]].\n\nMrs. Paradine's solicitor, Sir Simon Flaquer ([[Charles Coburn]]), hires Anthony Keane ([[Gregory Peck]]), a brilliant and successful barrister, to defend her in court. Although Keane has been happily married for 11 years, he instantly becomes deeply infatuated with this exotic, mysterious, and fascinating client. Keane's kind-hearted wife, Gay ([[Ann Todd]]), sees his obsession, and although he offers to relinquish the case, presses him to continue. She knows that a \"guilty\" verdict, followed by Mrs. Paradine's hanging, will mean that she will lose her husband emotionally forever. The only way that she can regain her husband's love and devotion is if he is able to obtain a \"not guilty\" verdict for Mrs. Paradine.\n\nMeanwhile, Keane himself starts to focus his legal efforts on Colonel Paradine's mysterious servant, Andr\u00e9 Latour ([[Louis Jourdan]]). Consciously or subconsciously, Keane sees Latour as a suitable scapegoat on whom he can pin the crime of murder, but this strategy backfires. After Keane has pressured Latour in court, triggering an angry outburst, word comes that Latour has killed himself. Mrs. Paradine is coldly furious that Keane has destroyed Latour, who was, in fact, her lover. On the witness stand, she tells Keane that she hates him and that he has murdered the only person she loved. She goes so far as to say that she poisoned her husband in order to be with Latour.\n\nKeane is overwhelmed, physically, intellectually, and emotionally. Attempting to summarize, he improvises a brief and faltering speech, admitting how poorly he has handled the case, but cannot continue speaking, and has to leave the court. He stays overnight at Sir Simon's office, feeling that his career is in ruins. His wife finds him there; she offers reconciliation, and hope for the future.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gregory Peck]] as Anthony Keane, counsel for the defence\n* [[Ann Todd]] as Gay Keane\n* [[Alida Valli]] as Mrs. Maddalena Anna Paradine\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as Judge Lord Thomas Horfield\n* [[Charles Coburn]] as Sir Simon Flaquer, solicitor for the defence \n* [[Joan Tetzel]] as Judy Flaquer, daughter of Simon Flaquer\n* [[Ethel Barrymore]] as Lady Sophie Horfield\n* [[Louis Jourdan]] as Andr\u00e9 Latour, Col.

''The Paradine Case'' was also the American film debut of [[Louis Jourdan]].<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=86212&category=Notes Notes]</ref> Both Valli and Jourdan hoped that the film would give them the status in the U.S. that they enjoyed in their home countries (Italy and France, respectively), but that did not happen, though Jourdan later made many U.S. films.<ref name=tcmart/>\n\n==Production==\n[[David O. Selznick]] had purchased the rights to [[Robert Smythe Hichens]]' novel in 1933, before it was published, when Selznick was still at [[MGM]], with [[Greta Garbo]] in mind to star &ndash; indeed, Garbo was Hichens' inspiration for the creation of Mrs. Paradine. Garbo did consider doing the film, but ultimately turned it down, as she decided to retire from acting.<ref name=tcmnotes /><ref name=osborne>Osborne, Robert. Comments on [[Turner Classic Movies]] broadcast of ''The Paradine Case'' on June 28, 2007</ref> (Garbo had also turned down ''[[I Remember Mama (film)|I Remember Mama]]'' at about the same time, and is reputed to have said \"No murderesses, no mamas\".<ref name=imdb />)\n\n[[Howard Estabrook]] was assigned to write the script at that time, and it was announced that [[John Barrymore]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Diana Wynyard]] would star in the film. A draft of the script was submitted by MGM to the censors at the [[Hays Office]], who warned that the script would likely be rejected since Mrs. Paradine was guilty of murder, adultery and perjury, and later committed suicide. They also objected to the judge being portrayed as a sadist who enjoyed sending people to their deaths. A new draft of the script was submitted, but not for some years, in 1942, and this script was approved. In 1946, another version was sent in, and this was also approved after the suicide was removed from the story.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nIn 1946, it was announced that [[Alfred Hitchcock]] would direct the film, and that [[Laurence Olivier]] would star as the barrister,<ref name=tcmnotes /> but Olivier eventually turned the project down, as he was preparing for his production of ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]''.<ref name=osborne /> Hitchcock was interested in [[Ronald Colman]] for the part as well as Garbo (who had not yet turned down the project) or [[Ingrid Bergman]] for Mrs. Paradine. Other actors who were considered for the film include: [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Alan Marshal (actor)|Alan Marshal]], [[James Mason]] for Anthony Keane; [[Hedy Lamarr]] for Mrs. Paradine; [[Claude Rains]] for Lord Thomas Horfield; and [[Robert Newton]] for Mrs. Paradine's lover.<ref name=tcmnotes /> In the end, Hitchcock pushed for Gregory Peck, then at the peak of his box-office appeal, Ann Todd was loaned from the [[Rank Organisation]] to play his wife, and Selznick settled on Alida Valli, considered one of the more promising actresses in the Italian cinema for Mrs. Paradine.<ref name=tcmart />\n\n[[Image:Paradine Case Hitchcock Peck.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Alfred Hitchcock and Gregory Peck in discussion on the set of ''The Paradine Case'']]\n\n''The Paradine Case'' was the last film made under Hitchcock's seven-year contract with Selznick, and it has been suggested that Hitchcock was tired of the association by that time. In an interview with [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], Hitchcock said that he and his wife [[Alma Reville]] wrote the first draft of the script together, before bringing in Scottish playwright [[James Bridie]] to do a polishing &ndash; but Selznick was dissatisfied with the result, and would view the previous day's rushes, do a rewrite, and send the new scenes to the set to be shot.<ref name=tcmnotes /><ref name=tcmart>Steinberg, Jay S. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=86212&category=Articles \"The Paradine Case\" (TCM article)]</ref>  According to his biographer [[Donald Spoto]] \"...Hitchcock's disgust with the content and method that were forced upon him conspired to produce an uneasy atmosphere from which Hitchcock could scarcely wait to extricate himself.\"  Gregory Peck said of the director, \"He seemed really bored with the whole thing...\"<ref>Spoto, Donald.

Although some external shots show the [[Lake District]] in Cumbria, the rest of the footage was shot entirely on three sets at Selznick's Culver City, California, lot, a first in Selznick's career as an independent producer.<ref name=tcmnotes /> Selznick reportedly spared no expense:<ref name=osborne /> the set for the courtroom scenes exactly duplicated a courtroom in London's [[Old Bailey]], photographed, with permission, by unit manager Fred Ahern, and built in 85 days at the cost of $80,000. Unusually, the set had ceilings to allow for low camera angles.<ref name=tcmnotes />\n\nFor the courtroom sequence, Hitchcock used a new technique by using four cameras shooting simultaneously, each focused on one of the principal actors in the scene &ndash; multiple camera photography had been used in the past, but only to shoot the same subject.<ref name=tcmnotes /> This set-up, including elaborately choreographed crane shots, allowed Hitchcock to shoot long 10-minute takes, something he would push to the limit on his next two films, ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949).<ref name=amgbio>Erickson, Hal [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:37223~T0 \"The Paradine Case\" (Allmovie)]</ref>\n\nThe completed film cost an estimated $4,258,000 to make, almost as expensive as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Selznick maintained close supervision on the production, and interfered with Hitchcock's normally carefully budgeted process by insisting on extensive re-takes. When Hitchcock insisted on receiving his contractual $1000/day fee, Selznick took over post-production, supervising the editing and the scoring of the film.<ref name=imdb>{{IMDb title|0039694}}.</ref> The producer went through eighteen different title changes for the picture before rechristening it ''The Paradine Case,'' just hours before the premiere.<ref>Spoto, p. 296</ref>\n\n''The Paradine Case'' had its world premiere in Los Angeles on December 29, 1947, opening simultaneously in two theaters across the street from each other in Westwood, California.<ref name=tcmnotes /> It then had its New York City premiere on January 8, 1948.<ref name=tcmnotes /><ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=86212&category=Overview Overview]</ref><ref>IMDB [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039694/releaseinfo Release dates]</ref> On its initial release, the film was 132 minutes long, due to Selznick's editing of Hitchcock's rough cut, which ran almost three hours. After the film's premieres, Selznick pulled the film from distribution and re-cut it for general release, bringing it down to 114 minutes, which is currently the length of the film on DVD release. In 1980, a flood reportedly destroyed the uncut original version of the film, making a restoration of that version unlikely.<ref name=imdb />\n\n''The Paradine Case'' was not a box office success: worldwide receipts barely covered half of the cost of production.<ref name=tcmart />\n\nAlmost every Hitchcock film has a [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo appearance by Alfred Hitchcock]]. In this film, he can be seen leaving the [[Cumberland]] train station, carrying a cello, at about 38 minutes into the film.\n\nHitchcock described ''The Paradine Case'' as \"...a love story embedded in the emotional quicksand of a murder trial\".\n\n===Production credits===\nThe production credits on the film were as follows:\n* Director - [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\n* Producer - [[David O.

Selznick and Alfred Hitchcock have put upon the screen a slick piece of static entertainment in their garrulous ''The Paradine Case''... Gregory Peck is impressively impassioned as the famous young London barrister who lets his heart, cruelly captured by his client, rule his head. And Ann Todd, the pliant British actress, is attractively anguished as his wife. Alida Valli, an import from Italy, makes the caged Mrs. Paradine a compound of mystery, fascination and voluptuousness with a pair of bedroom eyes, and Louis Jourdan, a new boy from Paris, is electric as the badgered valet.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9906E2D81E39E33ABC4153DFB7668383659EDE&oref=slogin Crowther, Bosley].
