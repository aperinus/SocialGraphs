The documentary boasts extensive underground footage shot during the height of the hardcore movement.  It features exclusive interviews with early hardcore punk music artists from bands such as Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains, and many more.<ref>[https://www.avclub.com/american-hardcore-1798202048 AV Club]</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot and edited for 5 years with many clips of 80s hardcore bands being sent in by the bands themselves. Some of the footage was shot by director Paul Rachman in the 80s with the most notable piece of footage being the final show of [[Negative FX]] which spawned a riot after the power was cut mid-song.\n\nMany of the interviews were actually done in both Paul Rachman's and Steven Blush's apartments in different areas to make it seem like they were done in different locations.\n\nThe film also features the photography of [[Edward Colver]] notably and principally, and his shot of Danny Spira from [[Wasted Youth (American band)|Wasted Youth]] covered in blood was used for the book cover.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = American Hardcore OST\n| type       = studio\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      = \n| caption    = \n| alt        =\n| released   = 10 October 2006\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hardcore punk]], [[thrashcore]]\n| length     = 37:01\n| label      = [[Rhino Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>Unterberger, Richie.
