It features regular team members [[Sid James]], [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Jim Dale]], [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]], and [[Joan Sims]]. Set in France and England in 1789 during the [[French Revolution]], it is a parody of [[Baroness Orczy]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]''.\n\nThe first ''Carry On'' to be produced by the [[Rank Organisation]], ''Don't Lose Your Head,'' was not conceived as a part of the series and was first released without the ''Carry On'' prefix. However, the ongoing popularity of the series persuaded Rank to add the prefix to the titles of this and the following film, ''[[Follow That Camel]]'', when they were re-released.\n\nFrench actress [[Dany Robin]] makes here her only ''Carry On'' appearance.\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the time of the French Revolution. Whilst the French aristocracy is losing their heads (literally), two bored English noblemen, Sir Rodney Ffing (pronounced \"Effing\") and his best friend Lord Darcy Pue (played by [[Sid James]] and [[Jim Dale]] respectively), bored with the endless rounds of country pursuits, decide to have some fun and save their French counterparts from beheading by the guillotine.\n\nThe enraged and incompetent revolutionary leader, Citizen Camembert ([[Kenneth Williams]]), and his toadying lackey, Citizen Bidet ([[Peter Butterworth]]), scour France for the elusive saviour of the nobles, who is nicknamed \u201cThe Black Fingernail\u201d after his calling card of \u201ctwo digits rampant\u201d. After a series of audacious rescues, the Fingernail succeeds in rescuing the Duc de Pommfrit ([[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]]) whilst disguised as an insurance salesman, and in the process, tricks Camembert into guillotining his own executioner. Camembert is chastised by his superior [[Maximillien Robespierre]] ([[Peter Gilmore]]) and threatened with the guillotine, unless he captures the Fingernail.\n\nDuring his escape from France, Sir Rodney meets his true love, Jacqueline ([[Dany Robin]]), leaving her with a silver locket containing a set of his mother\u2019s false teeth. On discovering Jacqueline, Camembert and Bidet imprison her. Using the locket as a trap, they travel to England to uncover the real identity of The Black Fingernail. They are accompanied by Camembert\u2019s lover, Desir\u00e9e ([[Joan Sims]]), who is on the lookout to marry a man with a title, disguised as the Comte and Comtesse de la Plume de ma Tante. Desir\u00e9e pretends to be Camembert's flamboyant sister, whilst wearing the locket.\n\nAfter a series of intrigues at a ball at Ffing House, everyone\u2019s identity is unknowingly revealed. Foppish Sir Rodney challenges Camembert to a rigged duel in order to get a head start on his journey to Paris to rescue Jacqueline. Desir\u00e9e is now herself in love with the hero and will do all she can to save him from the guillotine in return for his promise that she will marry her titled man.\n\nOn arrival in Paris, the Fingernail discovers that Jacqueline has been moved from the Bastille to the Ch\u00e2teau Neuf ([[Waddesdon Manor]]), the former home of an avid art collector and member of the aristocracy, recently presented to Citizen Camembert - by himself. Ffing, Lord Darcy, and the Duc de Pommfrit travel there to rescue her. During the ensuing fight between the rescuers and the French soldiers, most of Camembert\u2019s new art collection is destroyed. With the help of Desir\u00e9e, Jacqueline is rescued. All five flee the collapsing ch\u00e2teau to safety, whilst Camembert and Bidet attempt to stop it from falling down.\n\nFor their incompetence, Robespierre orders the execution of Camembert and Bidet on a double guillotine. They are relieved to know that the Fingernail is not there to see it, until the executioner reveals that he ''is'' The Black Fingernail himself. Afterwards, in England, Ffing marries Jacqueline, who becomes Lady Ffing, whilst he keeps his promise to Desir\u00e9e, who has married the Duc de Pommfrit (as he has a title), much to her own chagrin.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Sid James]] as Sir Rodney Ffing/The Black Fingernail\n*[[Kenneth Williams]] as Citizen Camembert\n*[[Jim Dale]] as Lord Darcy Pue\n*[[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] as Duc de Pommfrit\n*[[Joan Sims]] as Desiree Dubarry\n*[[Peter Butterworth]] as Citizen Bidet\n*[[Dany Robin]] as Jacqueline\n*[[Peter Gilmore]] as [[Maximilien Robespierre]]\n*[[Marianne Stone]] as Landlady\n*[[Michael Ward (actor)|Michael Ward]] as Henri\n*[[Leon Greene]] as Malabonce\n*[[Richard Shaw (actor)|Richard Shaw]] as Captain\n*[[David Davenport (actor)|David Davenport]] as Sergeant\n*[[Jennifer Clulow]] as 1st lady\n*[[Valerie Van Ost]] as 2nd lady\n*[[Jacqueline Pearce]] as 3rd lady\n*[[Hugh Futcher]] as Guard (uncredited)\n*[[Nikki van der Zyl]] as Messenger (uncredited)\n*[[Julian Orchard]] as Rake (uncredited)\n*[[Elspeth March]] as Lady Binder (uncredited)\n*[[Joan Ingram (actress)|Joan Ingram]] as Bald dowager (uncredited)\n*[[Michael Nightingale]] as \"What locket?\" man (uncredited)\n*[[Diana MacNamara]] as Princess Stephanie (uncredited)\n*[[Ronnie Brody]] as Little man (uncredited)\n*[[Billy Cornelius (actor)|Billy Cornelius]] as Soldier (uncredited)\n*[[Patrick Allen]] as Narrator (uncredited)\n*[[Monica Dietrich]] as Girl (uncredited)\n*[[Anna Willoughby]] as Girl (uncredited)\n*[[Penny Keen]] as Girl (uncredited)\n*[[June Cooper]] as Girl (uncredited)\n*[[Christine Pryor]] as Girl (uncredited)\n*Karen Young as Girl (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Filming and locations==\n*Filming dates \u2013 12 September\u201328 October 1966\n\n'''Interiors''':\n* Marble Hall, [[Clandon House]], [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], England\n* [[Pinewood Studios]], Buckinghamshire\n\n'''Exteriors''':\n* [[Clandon House]], [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], England\n* [[Claydon House|Claydon Park]], Claydon, [[Buckinghamshire]], England\n* [[Cliveden]], Buckinghamshire, England, UK\n* [[Waddesdon Manor]], Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, England, UK\n* [[Black Park]], Buckinghamshire, England, UK\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last1=Bright|first1=Morris |last2=Ross |first2=Robert |title=Mr Carry On \u2013 The Life & Work of Peter Rogers |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=978-0563551836}}\n*{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Andy |title=Carry On Confidential |publisher=Miwk |location=London |year=2012 |isbn=978-1908630018}}\n*{{cite book |last=Eastaugh |first=Kenneth |title=The Carry On Book |publisher=David & Charles |location=London |year=1978 |isbn=978-0715374030}}\n*{{cite book |last=Hibbin |first=Sally & Nina |title=What a Carry On |publisher=Hamlyn |location=London |year=1988 |isbn=978-0600558194}}\n*{{cite book |last=Hudis |first=Norman |title=No Laughing Matter |publisher=Apex |location=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-1906358150}}\n*{{cite book |last=Rigelsford |first=Adrian |title=Carry On Laughing \u2013 a celebration |publisher=Virgin |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=1-85227-554-5}}\n*{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Robert |title=The Carry On Companion |publisher=Batsford |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=978-0713487718}}\n*{{cite book |last=Sheridan |first=Simon |title=Keeping the British End Up \u2013 Four Decades of Saucy Cinema |publisher=Reynolds & Hearn Books |year=2007|edition=third }}\n*{{cite book |last=Sheridan |first=Simon |title=Keeping the British End Up \u2013 Four Decades of Saucy Cinema |publisher=Titan Books |location=London |year=2011 |isbn=978-0857682796}}\n*{{cite book |last=Webber |first=Richard |title=50 Years of Carry On |publisher=Arrow |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0099490074}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0060330}}\n\n{{Carry On Films}}\n{{Gerald Thomas}}\n\n[[Category:1966 films]]\n[[Category:British parody films]]\n[[Category:British historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Carry On films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gerald Thomas]]\n[[Category:Scarlet Pimpernel films]]\n[[Category:1960s parody films]]\n[[Category:1960s historical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1780s]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Peter Rogers]]\n[[Category:1960s British films]]"}]}}}}
