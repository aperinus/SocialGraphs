The climax includes a thinly disguised version of the [[Second Raid on Schweinfurt|Black Thursday]] strike against [[Schweinfurt]].\n\nThe film was adapted by [[Sy Bartlett]] and [[Beirne Lay, Jr.]], with uncredited contributions by director [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], from the 1948 novel ''12 O'Clock High'' by Bartlett and Lay. It stars [[Gregory Peck]], [[Hugh Marlowe]], [[Gary Merrill]], [[Millard Mitchell]], and [[Dean Jagger]].\n\nThe film was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] and won two: Dean Jagger for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], and [[Thomas T.

Convinced that it is the same jug which used to stand on the mantel of the airfield's officers' club, he buys it and journeys to the derelict airfield, where he reflects on his wartime experiences.\n\nIn a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], the setting shifts to 1942, when the 918th Bomb Group at Archbury has gained a reputation as the \"hard luck group\". After a particularly disastrous mission, group commander Colonel Keith Davenport appears exhausted and demoralized. His defeatist attitude spreads to other senior leaders of the group, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day, at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at [[VIII Bomber Command]]. Later, Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become emotionally too close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission's heavy losses. Pritchard realizes that Savage is right: Davenport has become over-protective and is unwilling to discipline his men, even for costly mistakes. Davenport is relieved of command and Savage is asked to take over.\n\nSavage takes a harsh approach to restoring the group's discipline and morale. He begins by reprimanding Gately, demoting him to aircraft commander and insisting that he henceforth fly every mission. Savage assigns Gately only the most incompetent crewmen, ordering him to paint the name \"Leper Colony\" on his airplane. Rough-and-ready Major Cobb impresses Savage with his independent spirit and replaces Gately as Air Exec. Savage conducts a series of training missions and waits for an opportunity to restore the group's pride in its abilities. Upset by the contrast of Savage's stern leadership with Davenport's easygoing ways, all of the group's pilots apply for transfers. Savage asks the Group [[Adjutant]], Major Stovall, to delay processing their applications to buy him some time. An attorney in civilian life, Stovall knows how to use bureaucratic [[red tape]] to his advantage.\n\nWhen the group returns to combat, all the groups are ordered to abort their mission due to heavy weather. Savage ignores the recall order. The 918th successfully bombs the target and is the only group to do so. All of its crews return safely. Though Pritchard is furious, Savage claims that he did not hear the recall due to a radio malfunction and instead persuades Pritchard to recommend the group for a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]]. Savage also acquires a surrogate son in Lieutenant Jesse Bishop, a [[Medal of Honor]] recipient who is Savage's eyes and ears among the combat aircrews.\nWhen the [[Inspector General]] arrives to investigate the pilots' transfer requests, Savage packs his belongings, expecting to be relieved of command and possibly court-martialed. But, led by Bishop, the pilots withdraw their requests. Savage also softens his attitude towards the men as he becomes more closely involved with them. Gately goes on to win Savage's respect and admiration by demonstrating extraordinary leadership and courage in combat.\n\nWith enemy resistance intensifying as the air war advances deeper into Germany, missions become longer and riskier and many of Savage's best men are shot down or killed. Pritchard tries to get Savage to return to a staff job at VIII Bomber Command, but Savage feels that the 918th is not yet ready to do without him. Reluctantly, Pritchard leaves him in command. Ordered to return to the same target after a particularly brutal raid on a [[ball bearing]] factory, Savage finds himself physically unable to haul himself up into his B-17. Gately takes his place as lead pilot and strike commander for the mission. While waiting for the group's return, Savage becomes [[catatonic]]. Only as they return to Archbury does he regain his composure and fall asleep.\n\nThe story then returns to 1949, as Stovall pedals away from Archbury.\n\n==Cast==\nAs appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041996/fullcredits \"Twelve O'Clock High Full credits.\"] ''IMDb''.

Many of the training and disciplinary scenes in ''Twelve O'Clock High'' derive from that experience.\n\nTowards the end of the film, the near-catatonic [[Combat stress reaction|battle fatigue]] that General Savage suffered and the harrowing missions that led up to it were inspired by the experiences of Brigadier General Newton Longfellow. The symptoms of the breakdown were not based on any real-life event, but instead were intended to portray the effects of intense stress experienced by many airmen.<ref name=Osprey/>\n\nMajor General Pritchard was modeled on the VIII Bomber Command's first commander, [[Ira C. Eaker|Major General Ira C. Eaker]].<ref name=AFMag/>\n\nColonel Keith Davenport was based on the first commander of the 306th Bomb Group, Colonel Charles B. Overacker, nicknamed \"Chip\".<ref name=AFMag/> Of all the personalities portrayed in ''Twelve O'Clock High'', that of Colonel Davenport most closely parallels his true-life counterpart. The early scene in which Davenport confronts Savage about a mission order was a close recreation of an actual event, as was his relief.\n\nMajor (later Lieutenant Colonel) Harvey Stovall, who is a former [[World War I]] [[U.S. Army Air Service]] pilot who has returned to active duty as a nonflying adjutant, was modeled on [[William Howard Stovall]], a World War I [[flying ace]] who returned to active duty as a major in the USAAF the week following Pearl Harbor, and served as the nonflying deputy chief of staff for personnel for the 8th Air Force in England for his World War I comrades, Brigadier General [[Frank O'Driscoll Hunter]] and General [[Carl Spaatz]].\n\nSecond Lieutenant Jesse Bishop (played by Robert Patten), who belly-lands in the B-17 next to the runway at the beginning of the film and was nominated for the Medal of Honor, had his true-life counterpart in Second Lieutenant [[John C. Morgan]].<ref name=AFMag/> The description of Bishop's fight to control the bomber after his pilot was hit in the head by fragments of a 20&nbsp;mm cannon shell is taken almost verbatim from Morgan's Medal of Honor citation. Details may be found in ''The 12 O'Clock High Logbook''. Patten had been a USAAF navigator in World War II, the only member of the cast with aircrew experience.\n\nSergeant McIllhenny was drawn from a member of the 306th Bomb Group, Sgt [[Donald Bevan]],<ref name=AFMag>Correll, John T.

Bevan had received publicity as a [[stowaway]] gunner (similar to McIllhenny in the film), though in reality, he had been invited to fly missions.

At the Eighth Air Force headquarters, Bartlett had worked closely with Colonel Armstrong, who was the primary model for the character General Savage.

Eventually, the role went to [[Gregory Peck]], who initially turned it down because the script was similar to ''Command Decision''.  Peck changed his mind because he was impressed with director Henry King, finding his empathy with the material and the cast and crew appealing. The two made more films together: ''[[The Gunfighter]]'' (1950), ''[[David and Bathsheba (film)|David and Bathsheba]]'' (1952), ''[[The Bravados]]'' (1958), and ''[[Beloved Infidel]]'' (1959).<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Matheis|title=The 12 O'Clock High Logbook: The Unofficial History of the Novel, Motion Picture, and TV Series|publisher=McFarland|year=2005|isbn=978-1593930332}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nVeterans of the heavy bomber campaign frequently cite ''Twelve O'Clock High'' as the only Hollywood film that accurately captured their combat experiences.<ref>Duffin, Allan T. and Paul Matheis.

As producers, writers Lay and Bartlett reused major plot elements of ''Twelve O'Clock High'' in later films featuring the U.S. Air Force, the 1950s-era ''[[Toward the Unknown]]'' and the early 1960s [[Cold War]]-era ''[[A Gathering of Eagles]]''.\n\n[[Paul Mantz]], Hollywood's leading stunt pilot, was paid the then-unprecedented sum of $4,500 to crash-land a B-17 bomber for one early scene in the film.<ref>[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/94088/twelve-oclock-high#trivia \"Trivia: Twelve O'Clock High.\"] ''Turner Classic Movies''.

Thus \"twelve o'clock high\" meant the attacker was approaching from directly ahead and above. This location was preferred by German fighter pilots because, until the introduction of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress variants#B-17G|Bendix chin turret]] in the B-17G model, the nose of the B-17 was the most lightly armed and vulnerable part of the bomber. Enemy fighter aircraft diving from above were also more difficult targets for the B-17 gunners due to their high closing speeds.\n\nBartlett's wife, actress [[Ellen Drew]], named the story after hearing Bartlett and Lay discuss German fighter tactics, which usually involved head-on attacks from \"twelve o'clock high\".<ref name=AFMag/>\n\n==Radio and television==\n{{Main|Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)}}\nGregory Peck repeated his role as General Savage on a ''[[Screen Guild Players]]'' radio broadcast on September 7, 1950.<ref name=tcmnotes/>\n\n''Twelve O'Clock High'' later became a television series [[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|of the same name]] that premiered on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network in 1964 and ran for three seasons.

The airfield itself was used in the immediate postwar period as a dump for soon-to-be-scrapped fighters and bombers, and was used for the penultimate scene in ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' when Dana Andrews relives his wartime experiences and goes on to rebuild his life.<ref>Orriss, Bruce.
