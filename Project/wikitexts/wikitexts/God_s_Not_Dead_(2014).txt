The film was released theatrically on March 21, 2014, by [[Pure Flix Entertainment]].<ref name=\"HR\">{{Cite web |last=Farber |first=Stephen |date=March 21, 2014 |title=God's Not Dead: Film Review |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/gods-not-dead-film-review-690393 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325112944/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/gods-not-dead-film-review-690393 |archive-date=March 25, 2014 |access-date=April 26, 2014 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\nWritten by Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman, and based on Rice {{not a typo|Broocks'}} book ''God's Not Dead: Evidence for God in an Age of Uncertainty'', the film follows a Christian college student (Harper) whose faith is challenged by an atheist philosophy professor (Sorbo), who declares God a pre-scientific fiction. It was heavily panned by critics but grossed over $62 million on a $2 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\" /> The film was criticized for its screenplay, Cronk's directing, performances, mean-spirited tone, characters, and use of [[straw man]] arguments and common stereotypes of atheists, instead of any actual debate.<ref name=HR /><ref name=av /><ref name=variety /><ref name=\"PsychToday\">{{Cite magazine |title=God's Not Dead?

Radisson demands his students sign a declaration that \"[[God is dead]]\" to pass. Josh is the only student who refuses. Radisson requires Josh to debate the topic with him but agrees to let his other students decide the winner.\n\nIn the first two debates, Radisson has counter-arguments for all of Josh's points. Josh's girlfriend Kara demands Josh either sign the statement or drop Radisson's class because standing up to Radisson will jeopardize their academic future. When Josh refuses, Kara breaks up with him.\n\nIn the final debate, Josh halts his line of debate to ask Radisson: \"Why do you hate [[God]]?\" Radisson explodes in rage, confirming he hates God for his mother's death. Josh asks Radisson how he can hate someone that does not exist. Martin, a Chinese student whose father forbids him from talking about God to avoid jeopardizing his brother's chance at overseas study, stands up and says, \"God's not dead.\" Most of the class follows Martin's lead, and Radisson leaves the room in defeat.\n\nRadisson dates Mina, an evangelical whom he belittles in front of his fellow atheist colleagues. Her brother Mark, a successful businessman and atheist, refuses to visit their mother, who suffers from dementia. Mark's girlfriend Amy is a left-wing blogger who writes articles critical of ''[[Duck Dynasty]]''. When Amy is diagnosed with cancer, Mark dumps her. A Muslim student, Ayisha, secretly converts to Christianity and is disowned by her infuriated father when he finds out.\n\nJosh invites Martin to attend a [[Newsboys]] concert. Radisson reads a letter from his late mother and is moved to reconcile with Mina. Amy confronts the Newsboys in their dressing room but asks them to help guide her in converting to Christianity. On his way to find Mina, Radisson is struck by a car and fatally injured. A reverend waiting at the intersection tends to Radisson and helps him as he dies. Mark, at last, visits his mother, but mocks her for her faith; she responds that his financial success was given to him by Satan to keep him from turning to God, then she doesn't remember his name. At the concert, the Newsboys show a video clip of [[Willie Robertson]] congratulating Josh on standing up to Radisson and encourages the audience to text \"God's Not Dead\" as a message to others. The Newsboys begin to play their song \"[[God's Not Dead (Like a Lion)|God's Not Dead]]\", dedicating it to Josh.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Shane Harper]] as Josh Wheaton, an evangelical college student\n* [[Kevin Sorbo]] as Professor Jeffrey Radisson,  Josh's philosophy class teacher who is an atheist.\n* [[David A.
