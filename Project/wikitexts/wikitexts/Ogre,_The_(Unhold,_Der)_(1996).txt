It was written by [[Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re]] and Schl\u00f6ndorff, based on the novel ''[[The Erl-King (novel)|The Erl-King]]'' by [[Michel Tournier]]. The story follows a simple man who recruits children to be [[Nazi]]s in the belief that he is protecting them.\n\n== Plot ==\nAbel Tiffauges ([[John Malkovich|Malkovich]]) is a simple Frenchman at the start of [[World War II]] who loves animals and children. The first part of the film recalls his childhood at a sadistic Catholic school for boys where he prays to [[Saint Christopher]] that the school, which he sees as a prison, be burned down. By chance, while Abel is being disciplined for spilling lamp oil on the chapel floor, his friend Nestor accidentally sets fire to the building, burning it down as he wished. From that day on, Abel is convinced that fate is on his side, and that it will protect him from anything.\n\nIt is 1940 as Abel now narrates, and he is working as a car mechanic in Paris. His hobby is photography, and he befriends and photographs the local children. However, on one occasion a girl named Martine takes his camera; he tells her off and upsets her. She then falsely accuses him of assaulting her. The police believe her, and he is put on trial. Fortunately for Abel, a war against [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] has broken out, and soldiers are urgently needed on the front. As a punishment for his supposed crime, he is sent to the army to fight off the invader.\n\nHowever, it is not long before France surrenders, and Abel and his comrades are sent to a camp in [[East Prussia]]. Abel is often able to sneak away from the camp to a hunting cabin in the forest where he feeds a blind moose. One day, he encounters a German officer  who is curious about his affinity for animals and tells him that the moose is known as The Ogre to the local peasants before telling him to return to the camp and to stop visiting the cabin. \nSeveral weeks later, the officer returns to Abel, and removes him from the camp. He takes him to [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]'s hunting lodge where he is the Chief Forester and gives him a job looking after the animals on the estate. \nWhen G\u00f6ring ([[Volker Spengler|Spengler]]) arrives, he first seems cheerful and friendly, but it is soon clear that he is sadistic, bombastic and mentally unstable. After hearing news that he is needed in Berlin because of the failure of the German Army at Stalingrad on the Russian Front, he dismisses the whole company at the lodge - including Abel. Before leaving, however, the now-former Chief Forester arranges for Abel to be given a new job at the nearby Kaltenborn Castle, a [[National Political Institutes of Education|military academy]] for boys.\n\nAt the castle, he instantly proves popular with the boys, and is treated by the staff as a privileged servant. One day, he is out riding, and comes across a group of boys on holiday. He tells them of life in the castle and they follow him back. An SS officer, [[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]] Raufeisen, is impressed and gives him the job of recruiting local boys into the academy. Although he is successful and means well in his efforts, Abel soon learns from the castle housekeeper, Mrs. Netta, that the locals are afraid of him for taking the boys, and that they have published pamphlets telling parents to watch out for \"The Ogre\", his newly-acquired nickname. Abel begins to develop doubts about his work. Several days later, one of the boys he recruited is left horribly burned during training from standing behind another boy as he fires a [[Panzerfaust]], making Abel yet more uncertain of the Nazis. Soon after, the owner of the academy, Count Kaltenborn ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl|Mueller-Stahl]]), is revealed to have been part of a plot to kill [[Hitler]]. He is arrested and taken away in a car, and is never seen again. Meanwhile, news has broken out that the [[Red Army]] has crossed the border, and the officers in charge of the castle, as well as the oldest boys training there, are sent out to the front line.\n\nOne night while out riding, Abel finds a column of prisoners being taken through the forest, and sees one being shot by a German soldier. When they have gone he approaches the road and finds that it is littered with dead bodies. Under the pile of corpses, he finds a boy named Ephraim who is barely alive and takes him to the castle where he hides him in the attic. With all the officers dead or at the front, Abel and Frau Netta are now in charge of the castle. Frau Netta stays on, trying to look after the boys, but Abel realizes that Hitler and the Nazis have lied - there will be no victory, and a last stand at the castle would be pointless. Abel gathers the remaining cadets and orders them to prepare to evacuate. Caught up in a patriotic fervor, they deem Abel a traitor and knock him unconscious. Shortly afterward, a group of German veterans arrives. Led by Raufeisen, they take command of Kaltenborn Castle, promising the boys a victorious battle for the Fatherland.\n\nThat night, Abel regains consciousness and returns to the attic. The Russians soon arrive, and a senior officer demands the castle's surrender. Abel tries to surrender the castle, but Raufeisen nearly shoots him with a rifle and the boys open fire on the Russians. As the battle begins, Abel finds Ephraim and leaves the castle with him. The castle catches fire during the fighting; it burns down and none of the defenders survive. They escape across the marshes safely, with Abel recalling the tale of [[St. Christopher]], and the scene fades to black.\n\n== Production ==\nSchl\u00f6ndorff's idea to create the film originally stemmed from his desire to create a sequel to his 1979 film ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'', since the film only covered part of the [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] novel on which it was based, but the main cast member [[David Bennent]] had grown out of the role and Schl\u00f6ndorff was unwilling to recast the role. Schl\u00f6ndorff decided that Tournier's novel reflected his specific interest in the war in particular. \nFilming began in 1995 on location in [[Malbork]] and [[Paris]], with Ezio Frigerio as production designer, who intentionally made the sets look as if they were from a fairytale.<ref>Michael Nyman Soundtrack \"The Ogre\" information sheet</ref> [[Michael Nyman]] wrote the soundtrack, three years after his huge international success with ''[[The Piano (soundtrack)|The Piano]]''.\n\n== Reception ==\nAlthough filmed in English, ''The Ogre'' was not initially released in the United Kingdom or the U.S. It had a limited theatrical release in the U.S. in 1998-1999<ref>{{cite news |last=Stack|first=Peter| title=Haunting 'Ogre' of Innocence, Evil| work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=August 13, 1999| url=http://m.sfgate.com/movies/article/Haunting-Ogre-of-Innocence-Evil-2914507.php |access-date=2014-08-31}}</ref> and was made available on DVD by [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]].
