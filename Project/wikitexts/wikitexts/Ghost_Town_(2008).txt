It stars English comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] in his first leading feature-film role, as a [[dentist]] who can see and talk with ghosts, along with [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as a young widow and [[Greg Kinnear]] as her recently deceased husband. Gavin Polone produced the film for [[Spyglass Entertainment]] and Pariah, and it was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] under the [[DreamWorks Pictures]] label.\n\n==Plot==\nIn New York City, Frank Herlihy is accidentally killed by getting hit by a bus while trying to buy an apartment for his mistress. A short time later, anti-social dentist Bertram Pincus is [[Hospital emergency codes#Code Blue|dead]] for seven minutes under general anesthesia during a colonoscopy.\n\nAfterwards, Bertram can see and communicate with ghosts, who pester him to help them with unfinished personal business. Frank promises to keep the other ghosts away if Bertram breaks up an engagement between his widow Gwen, a professional [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], and Richard, a human-rights lawyer who Frank says is dishonest. Bertram eventually agrees, trying to woo Gwen away from Richard. His past cold-hearted behavior towards Gwen makes it difficult, but he attracts her interest by analyzing the teeth of a mummified Egyptian Pharaoh she has been studying.\n\nBertram has dinner with Gwen and Richard, deciding that he is not so bad, but he himself begins to fall in love with her, and she enjoys his sense of humor. As Richard has a work emergency, Bertram and Gwen walk her dog and go for a drink. They share their sad stories of their last relationships, and Gwen reveals that she learned of Frank's mistress the day he died.\n\nWhen Richard visits Bertram for some dental work, he learns Gwen has broken their engagement. Frank doesn't understand why he is still on Earth if his \"unfinished business\" was to break up Richard and Gwen. Gwen, no longer engaged to Richard, accepts work at an archaeological dig in the [[Valley of the Kings]] for six months. As a going-away present, Bertram gets her a key chain from a fancy jeweler's, but he mistakenly reveals information about her that only Frank could have known. Gwen demands the truth, and Bertram tells her the whole story about the ghosts. She doesn't believe him and demands to know what Frank's worst nightmare was, and Frank lies to Bertram, leading Gwen to cuts him off.\n\nBertram sinks into a deep depression and his colleague Dr. Prashar convinces him that his life would be better if he decided to stop being cynical and start helping people. Bertram begins helping the ghosts around him with their \"unfinished business\" on Earth, bringing comfort to people they left behind and enabling the ghosts to depart. As he does this he realizes that the ghosts were still on Earth not because they had unfinished business, but because the people they were close to were not finished with them.\n\nRealizing Frank cannot leave because Gwen has not let him go, Bertram confronts her and while trying to persuade her to believe him about the ghosts, gets hit by a bus. Now a ghost, he watches with Frank as a crowd forms and Gwen sobs over him, and Richard arrives to perform CPR. Seeing how upset Gwen is and realizing she cares about Bertram, Frank gives him a piece of advice and finally leaves earth.\n\nSome time later, Gwen comes into Bertram's office for an appointment with Dr. Prashar but finds Bertram's office. He tells her of Frank's real nightmare\u2014that of losing his way home, which was the advice Frank told him. He then assures her that Frank has \"found his way home\".<ref name=Ghost />\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Bertram Pincus, a disillusioned dentist who gains the ability to communicate with ghosts.<ref name=Ghost>{{cite magazine\n| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966495 \n| author=Mcclintock, Pamela\n| title=Tea Leoni wanders into 'Town'\n| magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\n| date=2007-06-07\n| access-date=2022-01-01\n}}</ref>\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Gwen, an Egyptologist and Frank's widow.\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as Frank Herlihy, an unscrupulous ghost who enlists Bertram's help.\n* [[Billy Campbell]] as Richard, Gwen's love interest, whom Frank warns is a \"bad man\".\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Bertram's self-involved surgeon.\n* [[Dana Ivey]] as Marjorie Pickthall\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Dr. Prashar, Bertram's colleague.\n* [[Alan Ruck]] as the ghost of a family man; he competes with Frank for Bertram's attention.\n* [[Betty Gilpin]] as [[World War II]] Nurse\n* [[Brian d'Arcy James]] as Irish Eddie\n* [[Brian Tarantina]] as Ghost Cop\n* [[Jeff Hiller]] as a naked ghost.\n* [[Michael-Leon Wooley]] as a medical attorney.\n* [[Aaron Tveit]] as the anesthesiologist.\n* [[Bridget Moloney]] as the receptionist.\n* [[Joey Mazzarino]] as food delivery guy.\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place on the [[Upper East Side]] of New York City.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/movies/19ghos.html|title=Ricky Gervais Stars in a Comedy About the Afterlife|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=2008-09-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-01 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/greg-kinnear-ricky-gervais-haunt-ghost-town-article-1.323553|title=Kinnear and Gervais haunt 'Ghost Town'|last=Huguenin|first=Patrick|date=17 September 2008|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}</ref> Regarding his character, lead actor Ricky Gervais said, \"Just what America wants: a fat, British, middle-aged [[comedian]] trying to be a semi-romantic lead.\"<ref name=\"EW Fall Preview\">\"Fall Movie Summer Preview, September: Ghost Town.\" ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Iss. #1007/1008, August 22/29, 2008, pg.55.</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n# \"I'm Still In Love (w/You)\" \u2013 written and performed by Dusty Wright (aka Mark J.
