It is based on [[Don Winslow]]'s [[Savages (2010 novel)|novel of the same name]]. The screenplay was written by [[Shane Salerno]], Stone, and Winslow. The film was released on July 6, 2012 to mixed reviews and grossed $83 million worldwide. It stars [[Taylor Kitsch]], [[Blake Lively]], [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[Emile Hirsch]] and [[John Travolta]].\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Chon and Ben are [[marijuana]] growers in [[Laguna Beach]]. Chon, a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]], smuggled the seeds for the plants out of [[Afghanistan]]. Ben, a [[University of California, Berkeley]] graduate in business and botany, cultivates marijuana. The seeds yield a particularly potent strain, which develops a wide customer base. Chon and Ben become wealthy, and Ben devotes time and money to charity work in Africa and Asia. They are both [[Polyamory|openly]] in a relationship with Ophelia Sage.\n\nThe trio receives a video from Mexican drug-cartel enforcer Miguel \"Lado\" Arroyo of severed heads and a chainsaw, and Arroyo demands a meeting at which the cartel offers a partnership. Although Chon and Ben offer to hand over their network and get out of the business, the cartel wants their expertise and insists on a partnership. Chon and Ben make plans with Ophelia to go to [[Indonesia]] for a year, not telling her that they are fleeing the cartel. They speak to corrupt [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent Dennis Cain, who is on the take from them and who urges them to join the cartel. Ophelia is kidnapped by Lado's gang; Chon and Ben are notified of the kidnapping by a video call from cartel leader Elena S\u00e1nchez, who threatens to harm Ophelia if they decline the partnership.\n\nThey discuss the situation with Dennis, who tells them that Elena is facing the loss of her political connections in Mexico (foiling her efforts to move into the U.S.). Since she has already lost most of her family, Dennis says that he has nothing on her that can help them. Chon stabs Dennis in the hand and demands DEA intelligence so they can attack Elena. With help from Chon's Navy SEAL friends, he and Ben attack a cartel money convoy and kill seven of Elena's men.\n\nOphelia, held in horrible conditions, demands to speak to whoever is in charge. Lado drugs and rapes her in retaliation for going over his head. Elena, traveling to the U.S. to visit her daughter and deal with the escalating situation, has Ophelia brought with her. Chon and Ben frame high-ranking cartel member Alex as an agent of Elena's rival, El Azul. With Dennis' help, they falsify evidence and give it to Lado. Lado tortures Alex to force a confession. After Alex confesses, Lado covers him with petrol and forces Ben to ignite the petrol; Ophelia is forced to watch. Lado double-crosses Elena and begins working with El Azul.\n\nBen and Chon pay Dennis $3 million for information about Elena's daughter, Magda, and the name of his informant in Elena's cartel. They kidnap Magda and video-call Elena to establish that they are now in control. With Elena at their mercy, they arrange a desert meeting to exchange Ophelia and Magda at which snipers from both sides are in position. Elena asks who revealed her daughter's location, and Chon tells her it was Lado. She tries to kill Lado, but he shoots her first. A firefight erupts, and Chon is shot several times. Lado is shot in the back by Ben, but shoots him in the neck before Ophelia kills him. Ben is mortally wounded, and Chon injects him, Ophelia, and himself with a fatal overdose so they can die together.\n\nOphelia wakes from a nightmare. At the meeting, Lado steals Elena's car and escapes as Dennis leads DEA agents to the scene. Everyone but Lado and Magda is arrested. Because Ben has incriminating information about Dennis, Dennis identifies Ben and Chon as his informants in the cartel and they are released. Elena is sentenced to thirty years in prison, and El Azul and Lado create a new cartel called the Azulados. Ben, Chon, and Ophelia leave the country and live in a beachside hut, possibly in Indonesia. Ophelia tells us that they are living like savages.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as John \"Chon\" McAllister Jr. \n* [[Blake Lively]] as Ophelia \"O\" Sage\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] as Ben Leonard\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Miguel \"Lado\" Arroyo\n* [[John Travolta]] as DEA Agent Dennis Cain\n* [[Salma Hayek]] as Elena \"La Reina\" S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]] as Alex Reyes\n* [[Sandra Echeverr\u00eda]] as Magdalena S\u00e1nchez\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as \"Spin\"\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Cos\u00edo]] as \"El Azul\"\n* [[M\u00eda Maestro]] as Dolores Arroyo\n* [[Shea Whigham]] as Chad\n* [[Joel David Moore]] as Craig\n* Amber Dixon as Soph\u00eda\n* Diego Cata\u00f1o as Est\u00e9ban\n* [[Leonard Roberts]] as Frankie\n* [[Trevor Donovan]] as Matt\n* [[Ralph Echemendia]] as Wiley\n* [[Jake McLaughlin]] as \"Doc\"\n* Alexander Wraith as Sam\n* Antonio Jaramillo as Jaime\n* Leana Chavez as Gloria\n* Elena Varela as Maria\n* Lexi Jourden as Hannah \n* [[Sean Stone]] as Eric\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Claire\n\n==Production==\n{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=We had two weeks rehearsal, so we talked about it until we were about to pass out.
