The film stars [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Seann William Scott]] as two best friends who find themselves unable to remember where they parked their vehicle after a night of recklessness. Supporting cast members include [[Kristy Swanson]], [[Jennifer Garner]], and [[Marla Sokoloff]].\nThough the film was panned by most critics, it was a [[box office]] success and has managed to achieve a [[Cult film|cult status]], partially from frequent airings on cable television. The film's title became a minor pop culture saying, and was commonly reworked in various pop cultural contexts during the 2000s.\n\n==Plot==\nBest friends Jesse and Chester awaken with hangovers and no memory of the previous night. Their television is on, showing a program about [[Tool use by animals|animals using twigs and rocks as tools to get food]]. In the program is a monkey nicknamed Andrew. Their refrigerator is filled with containers of [[chocolate pudding]], and the answering machine contains an angry message from their twin girlfriends Wilma and Wanda as to their whereabouts. The two also learn they have almost been fired from their jobs. They emerge from their home to find Jesse's car missing, and with it their girlfriends' first-anniversary presents. This prompts Jesse to ask the film's titular question: \"Dude, where's my car?\"\n\nBecause the girls have promised them a \"special treat\", which Jesse and Chester take to mean sexual intercourse, the men are desperate to retrieve their car. The duo begins retracing their steps in an attempt to discover where they left the car. Along the way, they encounter a [[transgender]] stripper, a belligerent speaker box operator at a Chinese restaurant's drive-through, two tattoos they discover on each other's backs, UFO cultists led by Zoltan (who later hold the twins hostage), a [[Cantonese]]-speaking Chinese tailor, the [[Zen]]-minded Nelson and his [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-loving dog Jackal, beautiful Christie Boner, her aggressive jock boyfriend Tommy and his friends, a couple of hard-nosed police detectives, and a reclusive French [[ostrich]] farmer named Pierre. They also meet two groups of aliens, one group being five gorgeous women, the other being two Norwegian men, searching for the \"Continuum Transfunctioner\": an extraterrestrial device that the boys accidentally picked up last night.\n\nAfter Pierre releases the duo for correctly answering a question about ostriches, Jesse and Chester head over to a local arcade named Captain Stu's Space-O-Rama. Once inside, they encounter Zoltan and his cultists who give them Wilma and Wanda in exchange for a toy that Jesse and Chester try to pass off as the Transfunctioner. Tommy, Christie, and the jocks arrive along with Nelson and his dog, whom they release after Tommy snatches the fake Transfunctioner from Zoltan. The two sets of aliens arrive and notify everyone of the real Continuum Transfunctioner: a [[Rubik's Cube]] that Chester has been working hard to solve. He then solves it on the spot, causing the device to shapeshift into its true form.\n\nThe boys are warned that once the five lights stop flashing, the universe will be destroyed. Jesse and Chester must determine which group of aliens is there to protect the universe and which is there to destroy it. Both claim to be the protectors of the universe, stating that they were with Jesse and Chester the previous night, which Jesse and Chester still cannot remember anything, and ask for the Transfunctioner. The two correctly choose the men, who answer their question about the previous night by stating they got a hole in one at the 18th hole at the arcade's [[miniature golf]] park and won a lifetime supply of pudding. At the last second, they deactivate the Transfunctioner, saving the universe.\n\nEnraged, the five alien women merge to transform into its true form, a beautiful [[giantess]] clad in a purple bra and miniskirt. She devours Tommy alive in front of Christie, who reacts with indifference. The giantess then crawls out of the amusement center and chases Jesse and Chester. The cultists tell them to activate the Photon Accelerator Annihilation Beam on the Transfunctioner. However, the button that activates it is too far in to reach. At the last second, Chester remembers the nature show with the tool-using [[chimpanzee]]s and uses a straw to push the recessed button, thus destroying the alien. Tommy survives, but Christie breaks up with him in favor of Nelson.\n\nThe protectors thank Jesse, Chester and the twins for saving the world, and erase their minds concerning the events. The protectors park the duo's car, a [[Renault 5|Renault Le Car]], behind a mail truck for them to find the following morning. Jesse and Chester salvage their relationships with the twins and discover the special treat from the girls turns out to be matching berets with Jesse and Chester's names embroidered in the front. The protectors leave a gift for their girlfriends (and, for the two men): [[Breast implant|Breast Enhancement]] Necklaces. The film ends with Jesse, Chester, and the twins going out for Chinese food in Jesse's car, while arguing about what their tattoos say.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ashton Kutcher]] as Jesse Montgomery III\n*[[Seann William Scott]] as Chester Greenburg\n*[[Jennifer Garner]] as Wanda\n*[[Marla Sokoloff]] as Wilma\n*[[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] as Zelmina\n*[[Kristy Swanson]] as Christie Boner\n*[[David Herman]] as Nelson\n*[[Hal Sparks]] as Zoltan\n*[[Charlie O'Connell]] as Tommy\n*Teressa Tunney as Tania\n*[[Freda Foh Shen]] as Chinese Foooood Lady (voice)\n*John Toles-Bey as Mr. Pizzacoli\n*James Vincent as Jeff\n*[[Keone Young]] as Mr. Lee\n*[[Erik Aud\u00e9]] as Musclehead\n*[[Brent Spiner]] as Pierre (uncredited)\n*[[Andy Dick]] as Mark (uncredited)\n*[[Jodi Ann Paterson]] as Super Hot Giant Alien (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Seth Rogen]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] both auditioned for the lead roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2013/02/the-lost-roles-of-seth-rogen.html|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Seth Rogen|website=Vulture|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=August 14, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/639002/dude-wheres-my-car-facts|last=O'Brien|first=Jon|title=20 Facts About Dude, Where's My Car?|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]|date=December 15, 2020|accessdate=August 13, 2021}}</ref> [[Jason Reitman]] turned down to direct the film twice.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shoard|first=Catherine|title=Jason Reitman: 'Growing up sucks, doesn't it?'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/19/jason-reitman-young-adult|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 19, 2012|accessdate=August 14, 2021}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] took place in [[North Hollywood]], [[Santa Clarita]], and [[Glendale, California]].
