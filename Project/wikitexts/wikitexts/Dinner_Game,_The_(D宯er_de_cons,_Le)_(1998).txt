At the end of the dinner, the evening's \"champion idiot\" is selected.\n\nWith the help of an \"idiot scout\", Brochant manages to find a \"gem\", Fran\u00e7ois Pignon, a sprightly employee of the [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|Finance Ministry]] (which Brochant, a [[Tax fraud|tax cheat]], loathes). Pignon has a passion for building [[matchstick model|matchstick replicas]] of famous landmarks. Shortly after inviting Pignon to his home, Brochant is suddenly stricken with [[back pain]] while playing golf at his exclusive [[country club]]. His wife, Christine, leaves him shortly before Pignon arrives at his apartment, as she realizes that he still wants to go to the \"idiots' dinner\". Brochant initially wants Pignon to leave, but instead becomes reliant on him, because of his back problem and his need to resolve his relationship problems.\n\nHe solicits Pignon's assistance in making a series of telephone calls to locate his wife, but Pignon blunders each time, including revealing the existence of Brochant's mistress, Marlene Sasseur (thinking that she is Brochant's sister, since her name sounds like \"''sa s\u0153ur''\"), to his wife Christine and inviting tax inspector Lucien Cheval to Brochant's house, where Brochant is forced quickly to hide most of his valuables in an attempt to disguise his tax evasion.\n \nIn the meantime, Brochant is able to make amends with an old friend, Juste Leblanc, from whom he stole Christine, and through the evening's events is forced to reassess his mistakes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jacques Villeret]] as Fran\u00e7ois Pignon\n* [[Thierry Lhermitte]] as Pierre Brochant\n* [[Francis Huster]] as Juste Leblanc\n* [[Daniel Pr\u00e9vost]] as Lucien Cheval\n* [[Alexandra Vandernoot]] as Christine Brochant\n* [[Catherine Frot]] as Marl\u00e8ne Sasseur\n* [[Edgar Givry]] as Jean Cordier\n* [[Daniel Russo]] as Pascal Meneaux\n** [[Bernard Alane]] as Pascal Meneaux's voice\n* Christian Pereirra as Dr. Sorbier\n* P\u00e9tronille Moss as Mademoiselle Blond\n\n==Critical response==\nThe film was positively received by critics.
