The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Meryl Streep]], and [[Chris Cooper]], with [[Cara Seymour]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Ron Livingston]], and [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] in supporting roles.\n\nKaufman based ''Adaptation'' on his struggles to adapt [[Susan Orlean]]'s 1998 nonfiction book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' while suffering from [[writer's block]]. It involves elements adapted from the book, plus fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche. It culminates in completely invented elements, including versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events of ''The Orchid Thief''.\n\n''Adaptation'' was praised for its direction, screenplay, humor, and the performances of Cage, Cooper, and Streep. It received awards at the [[75th Academy Awards]], [[60th Golden Globe Awards]], and [[56th British Academy Film Awards]], with Cooper winning the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and Kaufman winning the [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. A [[British Film Institute]] poll ranked it one of the thirty best films of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49593 |title=Sight & Sound's films of the decade |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=December 14, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322225244/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49593 |archive-date=March 22, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSelf-loathing screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]] is hired to write the screenplay adaptation of [[Susan Orlean]]'s ''[[The Orchid Thief]]''. He struggles with anxiety, social phobia, depression, and low self-esteem. His twin brother, Donald, has moved into his house and is freeloading there. Donald decides to become a screenwriter like Charlie and attends seminars by screenwriting guru [[Robert McKee]].\n\nCharlie, who rejects formulaic scriptwriting, wants to ensure that his script is a faithful adaptation of ''The Orchid Thief'' but comes to feel that the book does not have a usable narrative and is impossible to turn into a film, which leaves him with a serious case of [[writer's block]]. Already well past his deadline with [[Columbia Pictures]] and despairing of writing his script with [[self-reference]], Charlie travels to New York City to discuss the screenplay with Orlean directly. Too shy and socially awkward to speak with her upon arriving at her office and after he received the surprising news that Donald's [[spec script]] for a clich\u00e9d psychological thriller, ''The 3'', is selling for six or seven figures, Charlie resorts to attending McKee's seminar in New York and asks him for advice. Charlie ends up asking Donald to join him in New York to assist with the story structure.\n\nDonald, who is confident socially, pretends to be Charlie and interviews Orlean but finds her responses suspicious. He and Charlie follow Orlean to Florida, where she meets [[John Laroche]], the orchid-stealing protagonist of her book and her secret lover. It is revealed that the [[Seminole]] wanted the [[Dendrophylax lindenii|ghost orchid]] to manufacture a mind-altering drug that causes fascination. Laroche introduces the drug to Orlean. After Laroche and Orlean catch Charlie observing them taking the drug and having sex, Orlean decides that Charlie must be killed to prevent him from potentially exposing them.\n\nOrlean forces Charlie to drive to the swamp at gunpoint, intending to kill him. Charlie and Donald escape and hide in the swamp, where they resolve their differences. Laroche accidentally shoots Donald. Charlie and Donald drive off but collide head-on with a ranger's truck. Donald is ejected through the windshield and dies moments later, but Charlie is saved by the airbag and runs into the swamp to hide. There he is spotted by Laroche, who is killed by an alligator before he can kill Charlie.\n\nOrlean is arrested. Charlie reconciles with his mother as he calls to inform her of Donald's death. He later tells his former love interest, Amelia, that he loves her. She responds that she loves him too. Charlie finishes the script, which ends with him announcing in a [[voice-over]] that the script is finished and that for the first time, he is filled with hope.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Doncage.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nicolas Cage portrays Charlie and Donald Kaufman through [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screen photography]].]]\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[Charlie Kaufman|Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman]]\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Susan Orlean]]\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as [[John Laroche]]\n* [[Cara Seymour]] as Amelia Kavan\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as [[Robert McKee]]\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Valerie Thomas\n* [[Ron Livingston]] as [[Temple Hill Entertainment|Marty Bowen]]\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Caroline Cunningham\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Alice\n* [[Bob Yerkes]] as [[Charles Darwin]]\n* [[Jim Beaver]] as Ranger Tony\n* [[Gary \"Litefoot\" Davis|Litefoot]] as Russell\n* [[Jay Tavare]] as Matthew Osceola\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as [[Augustus Raymond Margary|Augustus Margary]]\n* [[Peter Jason]] as Defense Attorney\n* [[Gary Farmer]] as Buster Baxley\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Tom Hanks]] was originally set for the double role of Charlie and Donald Kaufman.

In 2012, she said, \"[reading the screenplay] was a complete shock. My first reaction was 'Absolutely not!' They had to get my permission and I just said: 'No! Are you kidding? This is going to ruin my career!' Very wisely, they didn't really pressure me. They told me that everybody else had agreed and I somehow got emboldened. It was certainly scary to see the movie for the first time. It took a while for me to get over the idea that I had been insane to agree to it, but I love the movie now.\"\n\nOrlean called Streep's portrayal of her \"one of my favorite performances by her\" and appreciated that her version of the character was based not on the real Orlean but on how Streep imagined Orlean based on ''The Orchid Thief''. Despite the film's fictional parts, Orlean praised its fidelity to the book's spirit: \"What I admire the most is that it's very true to the book's themes of life and obsession, and there are also insights into things which are much more subtle in the book about longing, and about disappointment.\"<ref>Kevin Perry. \"[http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2012-04/16/susan-orlean-adaptation-orchid-thief-rin-tin-tin The New Yorker's Susan Orlean on crafting a story and being played by Meryl Streep in Adaptation]\".
