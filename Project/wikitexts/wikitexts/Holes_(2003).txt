The film stars [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]] and [[Shia LaBeouf]] in his film debut.\n\nThe film was produced by [[Chicago Pacific Entertainment]] in association with [[Phoenix Pictures]], presented by [[Walden Media]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=April 16, 2003|title=Holes|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/holes-2-1200542162/|url-status=live|access-date=August 10, 2021|website=Variety}}</ref> and distributed in many markets by the [[Film distributor|distribution company]] [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista]].\n\n''Holes'' was released in the United States on April 18, 2003, earning $71.4 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its cast, faithfulness to its source material, and sense of nostalgia.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> The film is dedicated to [[Scott Plank]], who died in a car accident six months before the film's release in October 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2002/scene/people-news/scott-plank-1117875953/|title=Scott Plank|website=variety.com|date=November 12, 2002|access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn [[Texas]], the Yelnats family has been cursed to be unlucky, which they blame on their ancestor Elya's failure to keep a promise to fortune teller Madame Zeroni over a century earlier in [[Latvia]]. One day, Stanley Yelnats IV is wrongfully convicted of stealing a pair of sneakers that were donated to charity by [[baseball]] player Clyde \"Sweet Feet\" Livingston, and is sentenced to 18 months at Camp Green Lake, a [[Youth detention center|juvenile detention camp]], in lieu of jail time.\n\nStanley arrives to find that the camp is a dried-up lake run by warden Louise Walker, her assistant Mr. Sir, and camp counselor Dr. Pendanski. Prisoners, known by their nicknames\u2014including Zero, Zig-Zag, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray, and Magnet\u2014spend each day digging holes in the desert; they may earn a day off if they find anything interesting inside the holes. One night, Mr. Sir rescues Stanley from a yellow-spotted lizard, which he warns Stanley are aggressive, venomous, and lethal. After finding a golden lipstick tube initialed K.B. and a fossil, Stanley is accepted into the group and given the nickname Caveman.\n\nAfter taking the blame for Magnet's stealing of Mr. Sir's sunflower seeds, Stanley is taken to the warden's house, where old wanted posters and newspapers lead him to realize that \"KB\" stands for Katherine \"Kissin' Kate\" Barlow, a schoolteacher turned outlaw from the past. Walker asks Stanley to grab her box of nail polish and mentions that it contains rattlesnake venom. After he and Mr. Sir explain what happened with the sunflower seeds, Walker injures Mr. Sir and allows Stanley to return to his hole.\n\nCamp Green Lake's history is revealed in a series of flashbacks as a flourishing lakeside community in the 19th century. Barlow is wooed by the wealthy Charles \"Trout\" Walker, whom she rejects, and by an [[African-Americans|African-American]] onion seller named Sam, whom she loves. One night, the jealous, racist Walker and the town's citizens burn down the schoolhouse and murder Sam. In retaliation, Barlow kills the local sheriff, who ignored her pleas for help, and becomes an outlaw hunting down Walker's men; at one point, she steals a chest of gold from Stanley Yelnats Sr., Elya's son. Twenty years later, the now-bankrupt Walkers track Barlow down and tell her to hand over her treasure. Barlow refuses and tells them to dig for it, after which she dies from a lizard bite and the Walkers set about digging for the treasure.\n\nIn the present, when Pendanski mocks Zero, whose name is actually Hector Zeroni, the latter hits Pendanski with a shovel and runs off. After some deliberation, Stanley searches for Hector. The pair have difficulty surviving in the desert without water. Eventually, Stanley carries the ailing Hector up the mountain, where they find a wild field of onions and a source of water, helping them regain strength; at the same time, Stanley unknowingly fulfills his ancestor's promise to the fortune teller and breaks the curse. While camping on the mountain, Hector tells Stanley that he stole Livingston's sneakers and threw them over the bridge to evade the police, only for them to inadvertently hit Stanley's head.\n\nReturning to the camp, Stanley and Hector investigate the hole where Stanley found the lipstick and discover a chest before they are discovered by Walker, Mr. Sir, and Pendanski. They soon realize that Walker, who is Trout's granddaughter, is using the inmates to search for Barlow's treasure. The adults are unable to steal the chest from the boys, as the hole has swarmed with lizards, which do not bite Stanley and Hector due to the onions they ate earlier. The adults, puzzled, wait for the lizards to kill the boys. The next morning, the attorney general and Stanley's lawyer arrive, accompanied by [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]; the chest Stanley found is discovered to have belonged to his namesake great-grandfather. Walker; Mr. Sir, who is revealed to be a paroled criminal named Marion Sevillo; and Pendanski, who is a criminal impersonating a doctor, are arrested. Stanley and Zero are released and it rains in Green Lake for the first time in over 100 years. \n\nThe Yelnats family claims the chest, which contains jewels, deeds, and promissory notes, which they share with Hector, who uses it to hire private investigators to find his missing mother, and both families live a life of financial ease as neighbors.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Stanley \"Caveman\" Yelnats IV\n* [[Khleo Thomas]] as Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni\n* [[Brenden Jefferson]] as Rex \"X-Ray\" Washburn\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Warden Louise Walker\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Marion \"Mr. Sir\" Sevillo\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Katherine \"Kissin' Kate\" Barlow\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Dr. Kiowa \"Mom\" Pendanski\n* Jake M.

[[Shia LaBeouf]], who ended up receiving the role, read the script before reading the [[Holes (novel)|original novel]]. In the original book, Stanley is depicted as obese, shedding considerable weight as the book progresses. The filmmakers chose to drop this aspect from the movie, as they believed it would have been difficult to convincingly portray the loss of weight in a live-action film.\n\nThe film was shot in several locations, including [[Ridgecrest, California]]. LaBeouf was simultaneously doing work for the [[Disney Channel]] show ''[[Even Stevens]]'', and worked on the film after taping ''Even Stevens''. To show the seven kids' holes being dug gradually throughout the day, different \"phases\" were used, for each of which the seven holes were given different levels of depth. For the yellow spotted lizards, fourteen [[Pogona|bearded dragon]]s were used, four of which were used for the main parts, and the rest used as \"background atmosphere lizards\".\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released theatrically in the United States on April 18, 2003, by [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]].\n\n==Music==\nThe film's music includes the [[Grammy]]-winning single \"Just Like You\" by [[Keb Mo']], and \"Dig It\" by The D Tent Boys (the actors portraying the D Tent group inmates), which included a video that was played regularly on the [[Disney Channel]].
