During the collision, elderly professor Coleman Ettinger ([[Jason Robards]]) is performing a meditation exercise in the yard with his wife Gena ([[Piper Laurie]]), theorizing that if he and his wife can enter a meditative alpha state together voluntarily, they will be able to live together forever.  However, just as the Ettingers are on the verge of completing their meditation experiment, the teenagers' collision renders both teens unconscious, enacting a type of body switch between the four characters.\n\nBobby wakes up in his bedroom to find his best friend Dinger ([[Corey Haim]]) and his parents asking him if he's okay, but \"Bobby\" has no idea who these people are because he is actually Coleman trapped in Bobby Keller's body. Coleman leaves the house to find his wife but returns when he cannot find her or make any sense of the situation. On his return to Bobby's home, Coleman plays up the role of Bobby for his family and friend, just wanting to go to sleep to see if the alpha state he attains in dreams will give him any clue to what has gone wrong with the experiment.\n\nIn his dream, Coleman is greeted by the real Bobby, who appears to be trapped in a dream partially generated by Coleman's own subconscious. Coleman discovers that Gena, skeptical of her husband's \"dream state\" theory from the beginning, is also trapped in the dream but is unable to communicate with him because part of her mind has been transferred to Lainie's body. Bobby informs Coleman that he has very little time to prevent what's left of his wife from forgetting about him and becoming lost in the dream forever.\n\nBobby claims to know the secret to switch them all back, yet is reluctant to help Coleman do so, finding the dream-world he now inhabits to be more satisfying than the physical world in which he existed as a troubled teen. Coleman realizes he only has a few days (while pretending to be Bobby) to overcome generation gaps, high-school bullies, Lainie's violent and unstable boyfriend Joel, and Lainie's bitter and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] divorced mother in order to improve Bobby's grades, love-life, relationships with his family and friends, and connect with Lainie (who is not particularly fond of Bobby) enough to convince her to recreate the meditation experiment that might save his beloved wife.\n\n==Cast==\nSource<ref>{{IMDb title|0097236}}</ref>\n{{castlist|\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as Bobby Keller\n* [[Corey Haim]] as Dinger\n* [[Meredith Salenger]] as Lainie Diamond\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Coleman Ettinger\n* [[Piper Laurie]] as Gena Ettinger\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Ike Baker\n* [[William McNamara]] as Joel\n* [[Susan Blakely]] as Cherry Diamond\n* [[Alex Rocco]] as Gus Keller\n* [[Victoria Jackson]] as Kit Keller\n* [[Matt Adler]] as Dumas\n* Ria Pavia as Maureen\n* [[Lala Sloatman|Lala]] as Shelley\n* Laura Lee Norton as Marge\n* John Ward as Derek\n* [[Josh Evans (film producer)|Josh Evans]] as Low Life #1\n* Jody Smith as Low Life #2\n* [[Kent Faulcon]] as Low Life #3\n* Russell Livingstone as Neighbor Next Door\n* Mickey Thomas as Mr. Pattison\n* Fran Taylor as Sheila Baker\n* Jon Grissom as P.E.
