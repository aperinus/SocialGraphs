It was dubbed into English and released by [[Funimation]] in 2003.\n\nThe antagonist [[Broly]] was created by Takao Koyama and was designed by series creator [[Akira Toriyama]].<ref name=\"Movies\">{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL \u5927\u5168\u96c6 6: MOVIES & TV SPECIALS|language=ja|publisher=Shueisha|pages=212\u2013216|year=1995 |isbn=4-08-782756-9}}</ref> This film is the first of three titular films featuring the character, followed by ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Broly \u2013 Second Coming|Broly \u2013 Second Coming]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly|Bio-Broly]]'' in 1994. The character also appeared in ''Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4-D at Super Tenkaichi Budokai'', a cinematic attraction at [[Universal Studios Japan]] in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] film titled ''[[Dragon Ball Super: Broly]]'' was released and served as a retelling of Broly's origins and character arc, taking place after the conclusion of the ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' anime.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words -->\n[[King Kai]] senses the destruction of the south galaxy by a Super Saiyan and realizes that the [[Milky Way|north galaxy]] will be targeted next. He [[telepathically]] contacts [[Goku]] who begins tracking the Super Saiyan's [[qi|energy]].\n\nOn Earth, a spaceship interrupts a picnic and army of [[humanoid]] alien soldiers greet [[Vegeta]] as their [[king]]. Their leader is revealed to be Saiyan named Paragus who claims that he has created a New Planet Vegeta and wishes for Vegeta to assume the Saiyan throne. Vegeta agrees after Paragus tells him that the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\" is running rampant throughout the galaxy and must be stopped. [[Gohan]], [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Future Trunks]], [[Krillin]], [[Master Roshi]], and [[Oolong (Dragon Ball)|Oolong]] accompany Vegeta onto the ship.\n\nOn New Vegeta, Vegeta meets Paragus' son, [[Broly]], who joins him in tracking the Super Saiyan on other planets. Gohan, Trunks, and Krillin explore New Vegeta and discover that it is uninhabited except for the alien slaves who reveal that a Super Saiyan obliterated their civilization. The slave masters begin to abuse them but they are defended by Gohan and Krillin. Goku arrives and is greeted by Paragus, who invites them to dinner at the palace. Broly appears agitated at the mere sight of Goku. Paragus calms his son by using a device on his bracelet that syncs to Broly's headband. Despite this, Broly attacks Goku in the middle of the night requiring Paragus to calm his son once again. Goku suspects that Broly is a Super Saiyan and Paragus contemplates the mind-control device and suspects that it is malfunctioning due to Broly responding aggressively to Goku. Paragus theorizes that Broly's violent Saiyan instincts are awakening as a result of Goku's power, then remembers they were born on the same day in an attempt to explain their fated encounter after all these years.\n\nGoku and the others confront Paragus upon learning the truth about Broly as his aggression toward Goku swells to the point of breaking free of the mind control device and he finally transforms into a rage filled behemoth - the Legendary Super Saiyan. Broly attacks Goku who is defended by Trunks and Gohan while a fearful Vegeta loses his will to fight. Paragus taunts Vegeta while revealing that Broly was born with a power level of 10,000 and was feared by King Vegeta to the point that he ordered the infant's [[execution]]. Paragus failed to persuade King Vegeta to spare Broly, who was pierced in the abdomen by a knife and left for dead with his father, while [[Frieza]] destroyed the planet that same day. Broly's survival instincts caused him to shield himself and Paragus and they soared off into space protected by Broly's power. Broly grew unstable and sadistic as he aged, and Paragus was forced to use a mind-control device to pacify his son, but planned to use him to exact his revenge on King Vegeta's bloodline, and convert the Earth into new Planet Vegeta. Paragus reveals that a [[comet]] is currently on approach toward New Vegeta, and will destroy it upon impact.\n\nGoku, Gohan, and Trunks are dominated by Broly until [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] arrives and heals them with Senzu beans. They engage Broly again, but continue to be severely outmatched. After being scolded by Piccolo, Vegeta's pride returns and he confronts Broly but is quickly incapacitated. Paragus prepares to escape the doomed planet in a small space pod before he is confronted by Broly and killed. Despite Broly's power continuing to increase, Goku manages to challenge him yet again and he is mercilessly beaten as he asks his allies to lend him their energy. After much reluctance, Vegeta finally gives Goku his energy who is able to use it to strike a piercing blow into Broly, causing the Legendary Super Saiyan's power to become unstable and he explodes.\n\nJust as the comet strikes and destroys New Vegeta, Goku, his allies, and the slaves cheer as they manage to escape in Piccolo's spaceship.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Japanese voice actor\n! colspan=\"2\" |English voice actor\n|-\n! <small>Chinkel Post-Production/[[AB Groupe]] ({{circa|2003}})</small><ref name=\"Big Green\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614 |title=Behind the Voice Actors |access-date=2015-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008214441/http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15614 |archive-date=2015-10-08 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! <small>[[FUNimation]] (2003)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Goku|Goku/Kakarot]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Masako Nozawa]]|| [[David Gasman]]<br>Jodi Forrest <small>(baby)</small>|| [[Sean Schemmel]] <br>[[Stephanie Nadolny]] <small>(baby)</small>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gohan]] \n| Jodi Forrest || [[Stephanie Nadolny]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Toshio Furukawa]]\n! <small>Big Green</small>\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Christopher Sabat|Christopher R.
