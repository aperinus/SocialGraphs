A reimagining of [[L. Frank Baum]]'s classic 1900 children's novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' featuring an all-Black cast, the film was loosely adapted from the [[The Wiz|1974 Broadway musical of the same title]]. It follows the adventures of [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], a shy, twenty-four year old [[Harlem]] schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy [[Land of Oz]], which resembles a dream version of [[New York City]]. Befriended by a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], a [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]] and a [[Cowardly Lion]], she travels through the city to seek an audience with the mysterious [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wiz]], who they say is the only one powerful enough to send her home.\n\nProduced by [[Universal Pictures]] and [[de Passe Entertainment|Motown Productions]], filming took place in Queens, New York from October to December 1977, with a cast starring [[Diana Ross]], [[Michael Jackson]], in his feature film debut, [[Nipsey Russell]], [[Ted Ross]], [[Mabel King]], [[Theresa Merritt]], [[Thelma Carpenter]], [[Lena Horne]] and [[Richard Pryor]]. Its story was reworked from [[William F. Brown (writer)|William F. Brown]]'s Broadway [[libretto]] by [[Joel Schumacher]], and [[Quincy Jones]] supervised the adaptation of [[Charlie Smalls]] and [[Luther Vandross]]' songs for it. A handful of new songs, written by Jones and the songwriting team of [[Ashford and Simpson|Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson]], were added for the project.\n\n''The Wiz'' was theatrically released on October 24, 1978 to critical and [[Box office bomb|commercial failure]], marking the end of the resurgence of African-American films that began with the [[blaxploitation]] movement of the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Moon 1997 xii\">{{cite book | last =Moon | first =Spencer | author2 =George Hill | title =Reel Black Talk: A Sourcebook of 50 American Filmmakers | publisher =Greenwood Press | year =1997 | isbn =0-313-29830-0 | no-pp =true | page =xii | url =https://archive.org/details/reelblacktalksou00moon }}</ref><ref name=\"benshoff\">{{cite book | last =Benshoff | first =Harry M. |author2=Sean Griffin | title =America on Film: Representing Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality at the Movies | publisher =Blackwell Publishing | year =2004 | isbn = 0-631-22583-8 | page =88}}</ref><ref name=\"George\" /> Despite its initial failure, it became a [[cult classic]] among black audiences, Jackson's fanbase and Oz enthusiasts.<ref name=\"cultclassic1\" /><ref name=\"cultclassic2\" /> Certain aspects influenced ''[[The Wiz Live!]]'', a live television adaptation of the musical, aired on [[NBC]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Ne-Yo (actor) |date=November 25, 2015 |title=\"The Wiz LIVE!\" Cast! |medium=live television interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0A1nIcM5dw&t=3m53s  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211214/S0A1nIcM5dw |archive-date=2021-12-14 |url-status=live|access-date=December 29, 2015 |quote=\"This is a kind of blend of the Broadway musical and the movie, so it's like both of them combined.\"}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA crowded [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] dinner brings a host of family together in a small [[Harlem]] apartment, where shy, twenty-four-year-old elementary schoolteacher [[Dorothy Gale]] lives with her [[Aunt Em]] and [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]] (\"The Feeling That We Once Had\"). Extremely introverted, she is teased by Aunt Em for having delayed moving out to start her life as an adult (\"Can I Go On?\"). While Dorothy cleans up after the meal, her dog [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] runs out the open kitchen door into a snowstorm. She succeeds in retrieving him but finds herself trapped in the storm. A magical whirlwind made of snow materializes and transports them to the realm of Oz, depicted as a dystopian version of New York City.\n\nAs Dorothy descends from the atmosphere she smashes through an electric \"Oz\" sign, which falls upon and kills Evermean, the [[Wicked Witch of the East]] who rules [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]]. As a result, she frees the [[Munchkin]]s who populate the playground into which she lands. Dorothy soon meets the Munchkins' main benefactress, Miss One, the [[Good Witch of the North (Baum)|Good Witch of the North]], a magical [[Numbers game|\"numbers runner\"]] who gives her Evermean's charmed silver slippers. Dorothy declares she just wants to get home to Aunt Em. Miss One urges her to follow the [[yellow brick road]] to the [[Emerald City]] and seek the help of the powerful \"[[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wiz]]\" (\"He's the Wiz\"). After telling her never to take the silver shoes off, Miss One and the Munchkins disappear and Dorothy is left to search for the road on her own (\"Soon As I Get Home\").\n\nThe next morning, Dorothy happens upon a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]] made of garbage and saves him from being teased by a group of humanoid crows (\"[[You Can't Win (song)|You Can't Win]]\"). The Scarecrow hopes the Wiz might be able to give him the one thing he feels that he lacks: a brain. They discover the yellow brick road and begin to \"[[Ease on Down the Road]]\". Along the way, they meet the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]] in an abandoned amusement park (\"If I Could Feel\"/\"Slide Some Oil to Me\") and a [[Cowardly Lion]], banished from the jungle (\"I'm a Mean Ol' Lion\"). The Tin Man and Lion join them on their quest to find the Wiz, hoping to gain a heart and courage, respectively. En route to the Emerald City, the adventurers escape from a haunted subway station and a group of flamboyant prostitutes known as the \"Poppy Girls\", who seduce the Lion. The Lion feels deeply ashamed of leading Dorothy into a trap, but she and the rest of the gang cheer him up (\"Be a Lion\").\n\nFinally reaching the Emerald City, the four friends are granted an audience with the Wiz, who appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene, the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the [[Winged monkeys|Flying Monkeys]] to capture them (\"Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News\").\n\nVengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and hangs the Lion up by his tail in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch. The sprinklers put out the fire and melt Evillene. With Evillene dead, her spells lose their power (\"[[A Brand New Day (The Wiz song)|A Brand New Day]]\").\n\nThe Flying Monkeys give Dorothy and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City, where they discover that the Wiz is actually Herman Smith, a failed politician from [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are distraught that they will never receive their brain, heart, and courage, but Dorothy makes them realize that they already have had these things all along (\"Believe in Yourself\") even as she fears she will never find her own way home. Glinda appears and implores her to use the magic of the silver slippers (\"Believe in Yourself (Reprise)\"). After thanking Glinda and saying goodbye to her friends, she reminisces about \"[[Home (The Wiz song)|Home]]\". She clicks her heels together three times and discovers she is back near home with Toto in her arms.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Diana Ross]] as [[Dorothy Gale]]\n* [[Michael Jackson]] as [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]]\n* [[Nipsey Russell]] as [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]]\n* [[Ted Ross]] as [[Cowardly Lion]] / Fleetwood Coupe DeVille\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Herman Smith / The Wiz]]\n* [[Lena Horne]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda The Good Witch of the South]]\n* [[Mabel King]] as Evillene The [[Wicked Witch of the West]]\n* [[Thelma Carpenter]] as Miss One the [[Good Witch of the North (Baum)|Good Witch of The North]]\n* [[Theresa Merritt]] as Shelby Gale / [[Aunt Em]]\n* Stanley Greene as [[Uncle Henry (Oz)|Uncle Henry]]\n* Derrick Bell, Roderick-Spencer Sibert, Kashka Banjoko and Ronald \"Smokey\" Stevens as The Four Crows\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|The Wiz (soundtrack)}}\nAll songs written by [[Charlie Smalls]], unless otherwise noted.\n{{track listing\n| extra_column    = Artist\n| total_length    =\n| title1          = Overture Part I\n| writer1         =\n| length1         = 2:36\n| title2          = Overture Part II\n| writer2         =\n| length2         = 1:57\n| title3          = The Feeling That We Had\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          = [[Theresa Merritt]] and Chorus\n| length3         = 3:26\n| title4          = Can I Go On?\n| writer4         = [[Quincy Jones]], [[Ashford & Simpson|Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson]]\n| extra4          = [[Diana Ross]]\n| length4         = 1:56\n| title5          = Tornado / Glinda's Theme\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 1:10\n| title6          = He's the Wizard\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          = [[Thelma Carpenter]] and Chorus\n| length6         = 4:09\n| title7          = Soon As I Get Home / Home\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          = Ross\n| length7         = 4:04\n| title8          = [[You Can't Win (song)|You Can't Win]]\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          = [[Michael Jackson]] and The Four Crows\n| length8         = 3:14\n| title9          = [[Ease on Down the Road]] #1\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          = Ross and Jackson\n| length9         = 3:55\n| title10         = What Would I Do If I Could Feel?\n| writer10        =\n| extra10         = [[Richard Pryor]]\n| length10        = 2:18\n| title11         = Slide Some Oil to Me\n| writer11        =\n| extra11         = Pryor\n| length11        = 2:51\n| title12         = Ease on Down the Road #2\n| writer12        =\n| extra12         = Ross, Jackson and Pryor\n| length12        = 1:31\n| title13         = I'm a Mean Ole Lion\n| writer13        =\n| extra13         = [[Nipsey Russell]]\n| length13        = 2:24\n| title14         = Ease on Down the Road #3\n| writer14        =\n| extra14         = Ross, Jackson, Pryor and Russell\n| length14        = 1:26\n| title15         = Poppy Girls Theme\n| writer15        = [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]]\n| length15        = 3:27\n| title16         = Be a Lion\n| writer16        =\n| extra16         = Ross, Jackson, Pryor and Russell\n| length16        = 4:04\n| title17         = End of the Yellow Brick Road\n| writer17        =\n| length17        = 1:01\n| title18         = Emerald City Sequence\n| writer18        = (music: Jones, lyrics: Smalls)\n| extra18         = Chorus\n| length18        = 6:44\n| title19         = Is This What Feeling Gets?

Gordy originally wanted the teenaged future [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer [[Stephanie Mills]], who had originated the role on Broadway, to be cast as Dorothy. When Motown star [[Diana Ross]] asked Gordy if she could be cast as Dorothy, he declined, saying that Ross\u2014then 33 years old\u2014was too old for the role.<ref name=\"dreamgirl\">{{cite book | last =Adrahtas | first = Thomas | title = A Lifetime to Get Here: Diana Ross: The American Dreamgirl | publisher = AuthorHouse | year = 2006 | pages =163\u2013167 | isbn = 1-4259-7140-7}}</ref> Ross went around Gordy and convinced executive producer [[Rob Cohen]] at [[Universal Pictures]] to arrange a deal where he would produce if Ross was cast as Dorothy. Gordy and Cohen agreed to the deal. [[Pauline Kael]], a film critic, described Ross's efforts to get the film into production as \"perhaps the strongest example of sheer will in film history.\"<ref name=\"dreamgirl\" />\n\nAfter filmmaker [[John Badham]] learned that Ross was cast as Dorothy, he decided not to direct, and Cohen replaced him with [[Sidney Lumet]].<ref name=\"dreamgirl\" /> Of his decision not to direct ''The Wiz'', Badham recalled telling Cohen that he thought Ross was \"a wonderful singer.

By the start of development, he and his brothers [[The Jackson 5|The Jacksons]] had left Motown for [[Epic Records]] after the release of their tenth album ''[[Moving Violation]]'', though Jackson had yet to make a solo album since his fourth album ''[[Forever, Michael]]''. Cohen, head of Motown Productions, thought Jackson would be perfect for the role of the Scarecrow, and approached Gordy with the idea, who agreed, though Lumet was harder to convince.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://time.com/4135018/the-wiz-michael-jackson/|title=Behind the Scenes of The Wiz With Michael Jackson|magazine=Time}}</ref> Lumet wanted [[Jimmie Walker]], star of [[CBS-TV]]'s ''[[Good Times]]'', telling Cohen \u201cMichael Jackson\u2019s a Vegas act. The Jackson 5\u2019s a Vegas act.\u201d [[Quincy Jones]] was also skeptical of Jackson, but after Cohen arranged a meeting, flying 19-year-old Jackson to New York, Lumet and Jones saw the qualities that Cohen saw. Jackson's father, [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph]], was wary of the project and saw it as a threat to the Jacksons group cohesion. Cohen moved Michael and his sister [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] into a Manhattan apartment, allowing him to be on his own for the first time. During production, he became a frequent visitor to New York's famous [[Studio 54]]. Jackson was dedicated to the Scarecrow role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part.<ref name=\"quincy\" /> The long hours of uncomfortable prosthetic makeup by [[Stan Winston]] did not bother him. During production, Jackson asked [[Quincy Jones]] who he would recommend as a producer on a yet unrecorded solo album project. Jones, impressed by Jackson's professionalism, talent and work ethic, offered to be producer of what became ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson song)|Off The Wall]]'' (1979), then later on the hugely successful albums ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982) and ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987).\n\n[[Ted Ross]] and [[Mabel King]] were brought in to reprise their respective roles from the stage musical, while [[Nipsey Russell]] was cast as the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]].
