Directed by Gregor Nicholas, it stars Aleksandra Vuj\u010di\u0107, [[Julian Arahanga]], [[Marton Csokas]], and [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nNina is the daughter of Ivan, a fierce Croatian patriarch whose family immigrated to [[Auckland]], New Zealand to escape the war. She works as a waitress in a restaurant and falls in love with Eddie, a M\u0101ori chef, despite her father's objections. For a price, she agrees to marry a Chinese co-worker so that he (and his Chinese wife) can establish permanent residency. The money gives her the independence she needs to leave her parents' house and move in with Eddie. Complications arise when Eddie realises the depth of her father's fury and the strength of Nina's family ties.\n\n==Cast==\n* Aleksandra Vuj\u010di\u0107 as Nina\n* [[Julian Arahanga]] as Eddie\n* [[Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija]] as Ivan\n* [[Marton Csokas]] as Darko\n* Madeline McNamara as Mira\n* Jing Zhao as Clara\n* Li Yang as Wu\n* Elizabeth Mavric as Vanya\n\n==Production==\nAleksandra Vuj\u010di\u0107 had never acted before and was discovered in an Auckland bar.<ref>[http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=369&s=Interviews Andrew L Urban, \"VUJCIC, ALEKSANDRA: BROKEN ENGLISH\", ''Urban Cinefile''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201201845/http://urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=369&s=Interviews |date=1 December 2012 }} accessed 4 December 2012</ref>\n\n==NC-17 rating==\nOn September 20, 1996, ''Broken English'' received an [[List of NC-17 rated films|NC-17 rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association|Motion Picture Association of America]]. Sony Pictures Classics attempted to appeal the rating to R, but the original rating was upheld. An edited R-rated version was released alongside the unedited NC-17 cut.<ref name=\"NC-17\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sonyclassics.com/broken/nc17.html |title=NC-17 Controversy |website=Broken English |publisher=[[Sony]] |access-date=October 4, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Broken English|url=https://www.filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=broken+english&x=0&y=0|website=Filmratings.com|publisher=[[MPAA]]|access-date=October 4, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the MPAA's decision, Nicholas released an official statement detailing his experience with their Appeals Board:\n\n{{blockquote\n|quote = My encounter with the MPAA Appeals Board made it very clear to me that there is a perception in this country that a depiction of an intimate expression of love--or in this case \"buttock thrusting,\" as it was described by one board member--is more dangerous to the youth of America than graphic scenes of violence, torture, rape and murder which they can see in any number of mainstream movies.\n\nTo me, there is something wrong with the system which tells us that exposure to acts of violence will leave young audiences untainted while exposure to acts of love will somehow corrupt them.\n\nAt the appeal, I sat in a kind of incredulous daze as I heard apparently educated people comment soberly that I \"could have shot it another way, like from the waist up\" and that \"we've got to draw the line somewhere.\" I looked around the room and realized I was seriously outnumbered. Then came the clincher: \"We can't expose the youth of America to buttock thrusting of this type.\" Clutching at straws I quickly speculated to myself as to what other kinds of buttock thrusting there were and whether or not they might be more acceptable. Was it the speed that was a problem? Was the thrusting too slow, too fast? I looked around again and it dawned on me: the thrusting was too real! These people were used to watching love scenes in which the actors looked like they were pretending to make love whereas we, in striving for realism, had created a scene in which two people appeared to be ''actually'' making love.\n\nWhether they were or not will remain our secret...<ref name=\"NC-17\"/>\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Broken English'' received generally positive reviews, currently holding an 82% 'fresh' rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 17 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.83/10.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|broken_english-1996|Broken English}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0115760|Broken English}}\n* {{mojo title|brokenenglish97|Broken English}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|broken_english-1996|Broken English}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Broken English (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1996 romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Croatian-language films]]\n[[Category:M\u0101ori-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Japanese-language films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Auckland]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:New Zealand independent films]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures Classics films]]\n[[Category:1996 independent films]]\n[[Category:1996 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:New Zealand multilingual films]]\n[[Category:New Zealand romantic drama films]]"}]}}}}
