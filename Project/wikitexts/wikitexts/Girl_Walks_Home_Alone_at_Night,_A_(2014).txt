They are harassed by a cruel, [[Drug dealer|drug-dealer]] [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.\n\nSaeed comes across a strange young woman in a [[chador]] at night. She persuades Saeed to take her back to his apartment. While there, she grows long [[fang]]s and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his [[Lock and key|car keys]] along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a [[costume party]] at a [[Nightclub|night club]] dressed up as [[Count Dracula|Dracula]], where he is persuaded by Shaydah into taking one of the [[MDMA|ecstasy]] pills he is selling. Under the influence, he becomes disoriented, and ends up lost at night on the street.\n\nThe woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, [[skateboarding]], or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and \u2013 at her request \u2013 pierces her ears with a [[safety pin]], but she eventually leaves.\n\nAtti, a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.\n\nSuffering from [[heroin withdrawal]], Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells the woman to take the cat and leave.\n\nThe following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and undecided about what to do. He eventually gets back in the car and the two continue their trip onwards.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sheila Vand]] as The Girl\n* Arash Marandi as Arash\n* [[Marshall Manesh]] as Hossein\n* [[Dominic Rains]] as Saeed\n* [[Mozhan Marn\u00f2]] as Atti\n* Rome Shadanloo as Shaydah  \n* Masuka as the cat<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kay |first=Linda |date=2015-09-12 |title=A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) |url=https://cinemacats.com/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-2014/ |access-date=2022-10-19 |website=Cinema Cats |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\nDirector Ana Lily Amirpour, regarding the mythology of the vampire, has stated that: \"A vampire is so many things: serial killer, a romantic, a historian, a drug addict \u2013 they're sort of all these things in one.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite magazine|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|date=2014-02-05|title=Meet the Woman Who Directed the World's Only Iranian Vampire Western|magazine=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/girl-walks-home-alone-at-night/|access-date=2020-04-30|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The film examines these facets of a vampire as described by Amirpour in a variety of ways.\n\nThe film's protagonist, The Girl, is a sort-of [[antihero]] vigilante with a taste for bad men.

In this way, the film has feminist leanings.\n\nRockabilly, a gender-bending, minor background character who exists on the fringe of Bad City throughout the duration of the movie, acts as a silent observer to the events around them.
