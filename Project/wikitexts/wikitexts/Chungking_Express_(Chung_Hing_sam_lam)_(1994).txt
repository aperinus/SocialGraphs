The first story stars [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] as a cop obsessed by his breakup with a woman named May, and his encounter with a mysterious drug smuggler ([[Brigitte Lin]]). The second stars [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]] as a police officer roused from his gloom over the loss of his flight attendant girlfriend ([[Valerie Chow]]) by the attentions of a quirky snack bar worker ([[Faye Wong]]).\n\n\"[[Chungking]]\" in the title refers to [[Chungking Mansions]] in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], [[Hong Kong]], where Wong grew up in the 1960s. \"Express\" refers to the food stand Midnight Express, located in [[Lan Kwai Fong]], an area in [[Central, Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Poet of time: Wong Kar-Wai on Chungking Express {{!}} from the Sight & Sound archive |url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/archives/wong-kar-wai-chungking-express |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=British Film Institute |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Then and Now: Iconic locations from Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express |url=https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/film/then-and-now-iconic-locations-from-wong-kar-wais-chungking-express |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=Time Out Hong Kong |language=en-GB}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Plot==\n===First story===\n[[Taiwan]]-raised cop He Qiwu is dumped by his girlfriend named May on 1 April. To verify her earnestness in breaking up with him, Qiwu chooses to wait for a month.<ref name=\"nottingham.ac.uk\">https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/scope/documents/2003/november-2003/gan.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> Every day he buys a tin of pineapples with an expiration date of 1 May, because May enjoyed pineapples and 1 May was his birthday. Meanwhile, a woman in a blonde wig tries to survive in the drug underworld after a smuggling operation goes sour.\n\nOn 1 May, Qiwu approaches the woman in the blonde wig at the [[Bottoms Up Club]]. However, she is exhausted and falls asleep in a hotel room, leaving him to watch old films and order food. He shines her shoes before he leaves her sleeping on the bed. She leaves in the morning and shoots the drug baron who set her up. Qiwu goes jogging and receives a message from her on his pager wishing him a happy birthday. He visits his usual snack food store where he collides with a new staff member, Faye.\n\n===Second story===\nAnother police officer is also dealing with a breakup\u2014with a flight attendant. Faye secretly falls for him. One day, the flight attendant visits the store and waits for the man. She learns he is on his day off and leaves a letter for him with the snack bar owner containing a set of keys to the officer's apartment.\n\nFaye tells him of the letter, but he delays reading it and asks the snack bar to keep it for him. Faye uses the keys to repeatedly enter the man's apartment to clean and redecorate. Gradually, her ploys help him cheer up. He finds Faye coming to his apartment and realises that she likes him; he arranges a date at a restaurant named California. Faye does not arrive, and the snack bar owner, her cousin, goes to the restaurant to tell him that Faye has left for the US state of California. She leaves him a [[boarding pass]] drawn on a paper napkin dated one year later.\n\nFaye, now a flight attendant, returns to Hong Kong. She finds that the man has bought the snack bar and is converting it into a restaurant. He asks her to stay for the grand opening, and asks her to send him a postcard if she leaves. As Faye is about to leave, he presents the boarding pass, wrinkled and water-stained, and she writes him a new one. She asks him where he wants the destination to be, to which he replies, \"Wherever you will take me.\"\n\n==Theme==\n* \"Chungking Express tells its story of love, loss, and memory through the romance of goods\". In the first story, He Qiwu desires closer social contacts but can only depend on desperate phone calls to May's parents and cans of pineapples (May's favourite food) as substitutes for actual physical and emotional contact and intimacy. \n* \"At our closest point, we were just 0.01&nbsp;cm apart from each other.\" 0.01&nbsp;cm is an urban space of possibilities\u2014separation or connection, strangers or friends. This is a form of urban space that is of interest to Wong\u2014that physical gap between busy passers-by in the city. \n* \"In the first story, Wong suggests that the sharing of 0.01&nbsp;cm in a busy city can produce an [[affect (psychology)|affect]]. In the second, the possibility of sustaining a relationship through the non-simultaneous sharing of space is posited.\"<ref>[https://gw2jh3xr2c.search.serialssolutions.com/?sid=sersol&SS_jc=TC0001409785&title=The%20sensuous%20cinema%20of%20Wong%20Kar-wai%20film%20poetics%20and%20the%20aesthetic%20of%20disturbance Bettison, Gary.

Lafrance, 'Cinematic Pleasures: Chungking Express'], ''Erasing Clouds'' 23 (2004)</ref> and that \"After the very heavy stuff, heavily emphasized in ''Ashes of Time'', I wanted to make a very light, contemporary movie, but where the characters had the same problems.\" Originally, Wong envisioned the stories as similar but with contrasting settings: one in [[Hong Kong Island]] in daylight, and the other in [[Kowloon]] at night. He felt that \"despite the difference, they are the same stories\": one was about encountering love in the tight city, the other was about the keeping love without physical connection.<ref name=\"erasingclouds\" /><ref name=\"nottingham.ac.uk\"/>\n\nThe screenplay was not finished by the time filming began; Wong finished it when filming paused over New Year. He wrote the second story in a single day.<ref name=\"erasingclouds\" /> He developed a third story, about a love-sick hitman, but as he felt it would make ''Chungking Express'' overlong, he produced it as a separate film, ''[[Fallen Angels (1995 film)|Fallen Angels]]'' (1995).\n\nWong wanted to film in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], since he grew up in the area and felt a strong connection to it. He described it as \"an area where the Chinese literally brush shoulders with westerners, and is uniquely Hong Kong.\" He was drawn to [[Chungking Mansion]] for its many lodgings, mix of cultures, and its significance as a crime hotspot; he felt that, as a \"mass-populated and hyperactive place\", it worked as a metaphor for Hong Kong itself.<ref name=\"erasingclouds\" />\n\nThe director once talked about his inspiration by the works of [[Haruki Murakami]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2022}} As an example, the original title of the film is \"\u91cd\u6176\u68ee\u6797\", while the Chinese title of Haruki Murakami's \"[[Norwegian Wood (novel)|Norwegian Wood]]\" (1987) is \"\u632a\u5a01\u7684\u68ee\u6797\".\n\nThe second story was shot in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], including [[Lan Kwai Fong]], near a popular fast food shop called Midnight Express.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkonghustle.com/movies/435/wong-kar-wai-faye-wong-chung-king-express-film/ |title=\"Wong Kar Wai's Midnight Express\u2026 now a 7\u201311?\", hongkonghustle.com, August 4, 2008 |publisher=Hongkonghustle.com |date=4 August 2008 |access-date=3 February 2012}}</ref> \"In this area, there are a lot of bars, a lot of foreign executives would hang out there after work,\" Wong remembers.

It's not a movie for casual audiences, and it may not reveal all its secrets the first time through . . .\n\nIf you are attentive to the style, if you think about what Wong is doing, ''Chungking Express'' works. If you're trying to follow the plot, you may feel frustrated&nbsp;... When Godard was hot, in the 1960s and early 1970s, there was an audience for this style, but in those days, there were still film societies and repertory theaters to build and nourish such audiences. Many of today's younger filmgoers, fed only by the narrow selections at video stores, are not as curious or knowledgeable and may simply be puzzled by ''Chungking Express'' instead of challenged.
