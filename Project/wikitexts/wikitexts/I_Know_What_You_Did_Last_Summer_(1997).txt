The film centers on four young friends who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer one year after covering up a car accident in which they supposedly killed a man. The film also draws inspiration from the [[urban legend]] known as \"[[The Hook]]\" and the 1980s slasher films ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980) and ''[[The House on Sorority Row]]'' (1982).\n\nPrior to [[Scream (1996 film)|''Scream'']] Williamson was approached to adapt Duncan's source novel by producer [[Erik Feig]]. Where Williamson's screenplay for ''Scream'' contained prominent elements of [[satire]] and self-referentiality, his adaptation of ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' reworked the novel's central plot to resemble a straightforward 1980s-era slasher film.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=183}} After the success of ''Scream'', the film was rushed into production.\n\n''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' was released theatrically on October 17, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was commercially successful, grossing $125 million worldwide on a budget of $17 million, and remaining number 1 at the U.S. [[box office]] for three consecutive weeks. It was also nominated for and won multiple awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119345/awards |title=I Know What You Did Last Summer - Awards |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date=2018-07-01 |archive-date=2019-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908064357/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119345/awards |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe film was followed by two sequels, ''[[I Still Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1998) and ''[[I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (2006). ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' has also been parodied and referenced in popular culture,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wayans Brothers' Comedy Style A Hit In 'Scary Movie' |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |volume=98 |page=58 |date=August 14, 2000}}</ref> and credited alongside ''Scream'' with revitalizing the [[slasher film|slasher genre]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Shary|2012|p=62}}\n\n==Plot==\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], 1996, in [[Southport, North Carolina]], Julie James and her friends Ray Bronson, [[Helen Shivers]], and Barry Cox drive to the beach. While driving along a coastal byway, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie's friend Max Neurick passes by them on the road. Julie reassures Max of their well-being, and he leaves. The group decides to dump the body in the water, but the pedestrian wakes up and attacks Helen. She struggles and he falls into the water. The group flees the docks and swears to never discuss what happened.\n\nA year later in 1997, Julie returns home from college for the summer. The friends have gone their separate ways. Julie receives a letter with no return address, stating, \"I know what you did last summer!\" Julie tracks down Helen, and they take the note to Barry, who suspects Max. They confront Max on the docks, and Barry threatens him with a hook. Julie meets Ray, who now works as a fisherman. Later, Max is killed by a figure in a [[raincoat|rain slicker]] wielding a hook. Later that night, Barry discovers a picture of his car in his gym locker with the words \"I KNOW\" written on the back of it. He is then ambushed by the same assailant stealing and driving his car.\n\nJulie researches newspaper articles, believing that the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen and Julie meet with David's sister Missy at her home. Missy explains that their family was devastated by David's death and that a friend of his named Billy Blue visited her to pay his respects. That night, the killer sneaks into Helen's house, cuts off her hair while she sleeps and writes \"SOON\" in lipstick on her mirror.\n\nThe following morning, Julie finds Max's corpse wearing Barry's stolen jacket and covered in [[crabs]] in the trunk of her car. When she calls the others, the body and the crabs are missing. Julie, Helen and Barry confront Ray about the recent events. The latter claims to also have received a threatening letter. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen participate in the [[Independence Day (United States)#Customs|4th of July parade]]. Missy reveals David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend, Susie Willis, in a car accident and shows David's suicide note to Julie. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie realizes it was not a suicide note, but a death threat.\n\nAt the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry being murdered on the balcony. She rushes upstairs with a police officer, but finds no sign of the killer or Barry. The police officer is escorting Helen home when the killer lures him into an alley and murders him. Helen runs to her family's store, where her sister Elsa is closing for the night. The killer enters the store and murders Elsa. Helen is chased upstairs and escapes through a window, falling to an alleyway. She runs toward the street, but the killer stops her and slashes her to death, her screams unheard by the ongoing parade.\n\nJulie finds an article mentioning Susie's father, Ben Willis, and realizes Ben was the man that they ran over, moments after he killed David to avenge his daughter. She goes to the docks to tell Ray, but notices Ray's boat is called ''Billy Blue'' and flees from him. A fisherman appears and knocks Ray unconscious, inviting Julie to hide on his boat. On the boat, she finds photos and articles about her and her friends, and pictures of Susie. The boat leaves the docks, and the fisherman is revealed to be Ben Willis. He chases Julie below deck, where she uncovers the bodies of his victims, including Helen, and Barry, in the boat's icebox. Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie. He ultimately uses the [[rigging]] to sever Ben's hand and send him overboard. When Julie and Ray are questioned by the police, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but are relieved not to have actually killed anyone, and reconcile.\n\nA year later in 1998, Julie is in college in [[Boston]]. As she enters the shower, she notices the words \"I still know\" written in the steam on the shower door. Moments later, a dark figure crashes through it as Julie screams.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] as Julie James\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Helen Shivers]]\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Barry Cox\n* [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] as Ray Bronson\n* [[Bridgette Wilson]] as Elsa Shivers\n* [[Anne Heche]] as Melissa \"Missy\" Egan\n* [[Muse Watson]] as Ben Willis / The Fisherman\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Max Neurick\n* [[Stuart Greer]] as Officer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' was a screenplay penned by Kevin Williamson several years beforehand, which was then rushed into production by Columbia Pictures upon the success of the Williamson-written ''Scream'' (1996).<ref>{{cite web|author=Gary Susman|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2017/10/17/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-movie-trivia/|title=14 Things You Never Know About 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'|work=MovieFone|date=17 October 2017|access-date=19 February 2018|archive-date=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220212250/https://www.moviefone.com/2017/10/17/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-movie-trivia/|url-status=live}}</ref> It was based on [[I Know What You Did Last Summer (novel)|the 1973 novel of the same name]] by Lois Duncan, a youth-oriented suspense novel about four young people who are involved in a [[hit-and-run]] accident involving a young boy.<ref name=now/> Producer Erik Feig pitched the idea of a screen adaptation to [[Mandalay Entertainment]], and subsequently appointed Williamson to retool the core elements of Duncan's novel, rendering a screenplay more akin to a 1980s slasher film{{sfn|Harper|2004|p=26}}<ref name=now>{{cite AV media|title=Now I Know What You Did Last Summer|people=Gillis, Michael (prod., dir.)|medium=Documentary short|year=2008|work=I Know What You Did Last Summer|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Inspired by his father, who had been a commercial fisherman, Williamson changed the setting of the novel to a small fishing village, and made the villain a hook-wielding fisherman.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=183}}\n\nThe killer's arming of himself with a hook is a reference to the urban legend \"The Hook\", which the four main characters recount at the beginning of the film around a campfire.<ref name=now/> According to Williamson, he wrote the scene as a way of indicating what was to come: \"Basically what I was doing was I was setting the framework to say, 'All right, audience: That's that legend. Now here's a new one.'\"<ref name=now/> Unlike Williamson's screenplay for the film's contemporary, ''Scream'', which incorporated satire of the slasher film, ''I Know What You Did Last Summer'' was written more as a straightforward slasher film.<ref name=now/> Gillespie commented in 2008: \"The joy of this film for me as a filmmaker was in taking [the] elements that we've seen before, and saying to the audience: 'Here's something you've seen before'\u2014knowing that they're saying 'We've seen this before'\u2014and still getting them to jump.\"<ref name=now/> Gillespie also claimed that he felt Williamson's screenplay did not resemble a \"slasher horror movie\" and that he saw it rather as simply \"a really good story\" with a [[morality]] tale embedded within it.<ref name=now/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nAccording to producer Stokely Chaffin, the producers sought out actors who were \"beautiful, but likable\".<ref name=now/> Director Gillespie recalled that, though he had been unfamiliar with the screenplay's source material, that \"roughly 60 to 65%\" of the young women auditioning had read the novel as children.<ref>[[#Gillespie|Gillespie & Mirkovich 1998]] (0:08:46)</ref> Jennifer Love Hewitt, who at the time was mainly known for her role on the television series ''[[Party of Five]]'', was cast in the lead of Julie James based on her \"ability to project vulnerability\", which the producers, director Gillespie and writer Williamson unanimously agreed upon.<ref name=now/> Initially, Hewitt was considered for the role of Helen.<ref name=now/> [[Melissa Joan Hart]] was offered a role, but she turned it down, because she felt that the film was a rip-off of ''Scream''.<ref>{{Cite

\"{{convert|6|ft|2|in|abbr=on}} [[quarterback]]\" appearance, as the character had been written as an intimidating figure.<ref name=now/> Ryan Phillippe was ultimately cast in the part based on his audition, despite the fact that he was not as physically tall as the script had called for.<ref name=now/> Director Gillespie chose Freddie Prinze Jr. for the role of Ray, because he felt Prinze himself had an \"everyman\" quality much like the character.<ref name=now/>\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar was the last of the lead performers to be cast in the role of Helen.<ref name=now/> Like Hewitt, Gellar was also known to American audiences at the time for her roles in television, primarily as the titular [[Buffy Summers]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.<ref name=now/> Gillespie commented on casting Gellar: \"I wanted an actress that had a warmth to her, but could still come off as being a bitch.\"<ref name=now/> For the supporting role of Missy, Gillespie sought an actress with significant screen presence, as the character, despite appearing in only two scenes, is central to several major plot points.<ref name=now/> Anne Heche was cast in the role, which she recalled as being two days' worth of work that required her to \"be scary\".<ref name=now/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Kolmer2.jpg|thumb|The cliff and rock shown at the beginning of the film, shot at Kolmer Gulch near [[Jenner, California]]]]\nScottish director Jim Gillespie was hired to direct the film after being suggested by writer Williamson.<ref name=\"now\" /> Star Hewitt would later state in 2008 that Gillespie was to date her \"favorite director [she's] ever worked with.\"<ref name=\"now\" /> Principal photography began on March 31, 1997{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=184}} and took place over a period of

Gillespie says was difficult for the cast and crew, and also created commotion in primary small-town locations in which they shot.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=184}} Gillespie devised a color scheme with cinematographer [[Denis Crossan]] which was marked by heavy [[blue]]s throughout and a notable lack of bright colors.<ref>[[#Gillespie|Gillespie & Mirkovich 1998]] (0:24:27)</ref>\n[[File:KolmerCurve.jpg|thumb|The blind curve where the car accident occurs early in the film, shot at Kolmer Gulch near Jenner, California]]\nFor the beginning of the film, coastal areas of [[Sonoma County, California]] stood in for North Carolina, where the film is set.

The scene in which the four friends are seated around a campfire on the beach next to a wrecked boat was inspired by a painting Gillespie had seen in a reference book; to achieve the image, the art department purchased an old boat in [[Bodega Bay]], cut it in half and placed it at the beach location.<ref>[[#Gillespie|Gillespie & Mirkovich 1998]] (0:09:58)</ref>\n[[File:Southport from the Water.JPG|thumb|The majority of the film was set in Southport, North Carolina]]\nThe remaining scenes were filmed primarily around the town of Southport, North Carolina.<ref name=locations/> Specific sites included the Amuzu Theater, where the beauty pageant is held, the Old Yacht Basin and Southport Fish Company.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.southport-oakisland.com/listing/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-1997.html| title=I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)| publisher=Southport-OakIsland.com| access-date=February 19, 2018| archive-date=February 20, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220212206/https://www.southport-oakisland.com/listing/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-1997.html| url-status=live}}</ref> Julie's house is on Short Street just north of Southport Marina.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.southporttimes.com/featured/200407.html| title=Movies Filmed in Southport, North Carolina| newspaper=Southport Times| access-date=February 19, 2018| archive-date=October 18, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018104148/http://www.southporttimes.com/featured/200407.html| url-status=live}}</ref> The daytime sequences shot on the marina show multiple vessels traversing the water; though real vessels, the boat traffic was orchestrated by a marine traffic coordinator to make the waterway appear lively.<ref>[[#Gillespie|Gillespie & Mirkovich 1998]] (0:36:57)</ref> The Shivers Department Store setting in the film was discovered on location in Southport by director Gillespie, who was so impressed by the location that he reworked elements of the script in order to incorporate it into the film; it eventually became the primary setting for Helen's extended chase sequence with the killer.<ref name=now/> The exterior sequences of Julie's Boston college campus were in fact shot at [[Duke University]],<ref>[[#Gillespie|Gillespie & Mirkovich 1998]] (0:24:51)</ref> while the hospital sequence was filmed at Southport's [[Dosher Memorial Hospital]] in an unused wing of the hospital.<ref>[[#Gillespie|Gillespie & Mirkovich 1998]] (0:43:00)</ref>\n\nThe final sequence on the boat was shot on an actual water-bound vessel on the [[Cape Fear River]], which proved difficult for the actors and crew.<ref name=now/> According to Gillespie, the filmmakers nearly lost the boat while attempting to dock it due to the volatile waters, after which they were forced to leave and shoot other footage until the following day.<ref name=now/>\n\n===Post-production===\nGillespie chose to film virtually no onscreen blood as he did not want the film to be overly gratuitous in terms of violence.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=184}}<ref name=now/> The scene in which Elsa has her throat slashed while standing against a glass door had originally been shot from behind without any blood appearing on the glass. However, producer Feig worried that the scene appeared \"medically impossible\" after which Gillespie re-shot it (post-principal photography) with a visual effect of blood spattering across the glass.<ref name=now/> Upon test screenings of the film, Gillespie and the producers decided that a death sequence needed to occur earlier in the film to establish a sense of legitimate danger for the main characters.<ref name=now/> The scene in which Max is murdered in the crab factory was subsequently filmed and implemented into the final cut to achieve this (in the original script, his character was not killed).<ref name=now/>\n\nThe original ending of the film featured a sequence in which Julie receives an [[email]] reading: \"I Still Know\".{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=184}} This ending was scrapped for the more dramatic ending featured in the final cut of the film, in which Julie finds the same message scrawled on a shower stall just before the killer comes crashing through the glass.{{sfn|Rockoff|2016|p=184}} This footage was also shot after principal photography, on a soundstage next-door to where Hewitt was filming ''Party of Five''.<ref>[[#Gillespie|Gillespie & Mirkovich 1998]] (1:35:29)</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe film produced two soundtracks.
