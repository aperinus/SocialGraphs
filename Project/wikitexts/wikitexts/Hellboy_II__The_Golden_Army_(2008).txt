The film was written and directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]] from a story by him and Mignola, and is a [[sequel]] to the 2004 film ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'', which del Toro also directed. [[Ron Perlman]] reprises his starring role as the eponymous character. ''Hellboy II: The Golden Army'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nThe film grossed over $168 million, against a production budget between $82.5\u201385 million. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the fantasy atmosphere of the film, as well as Perlman and the other cast's acting performances. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]].\n\n==Plot==\nDuring Christmas 1955, a young [[Hellboy]] is told a bedtime story by his adoptive father, [[Trevor Bruttenholm]], of an ancient war between human and magical creatures. After the magical creatures are driven back by the humans, the goblin blacksmiths extend an offer to Balor, king of the elves, to build him an indestructible mechanical army. Encouraged by his son Prince Nuada, Balor accepts; the Golden Army subsequently devastates humanity. Regretting his actions, Balor forms a truce with the humans, that they will keep to the cities and the magical creatures to the forests. The crown to command the Golden Army, which can only be worn by one of royal blood, is split into three pieces. Nuada, disagreeing with the truce, leaves in exile.\n\nIn the present, a year after the evil sorcerer [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]]'s plans to summon his eldritch masters, the [[Ogdru Jahad]], to enact Armageddon were foiled, Nuada returns and begins gathering the pieces of the crown. He collects the first piece from an auction, unleashing [[Tooth fairy#In film and television|tooth fairies]], voracious flying creatures that eat the crowd alive, and kills his father for the second piece. His twin sister Princess Nuala escapes with the final piece.\n\nMeanwhile, at the [[B.P.R.D.]], demonic special agent Hellboy is having issues with his girlfriend [[Liz Sherman|Liz]], and dislikes that their organization must operate in secrecy. Investigating the auction slaughter, Hellboy allows himself to be revealed to the world. In the commotion, [[Abe Sapien]] discovers Liz is pregnant but she swears him to secrecy.\n\nFurious at Hellboy's actions, [[Tom Manning (comics)|Tom Manning]]'s superiors send the [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasmic]] medium [[Johann Krauss]] to rein him in. With Krauss in charge, the team tracks the tooth fairies to a secret market under the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. Abe finds Nuala, who has obtained a map leading to the Golden Army, and falls in love with her. Hellboy fights and kills Nuada's accomplice Wink and an [[elemental]] forest god that Nuada summons against him. During the fight, Nuada questions why he fights for the humans when they have driven the magical creatures into hiding, of which he too is one. Nuala is taken under the B.P.R.D.'s protection.\n\nNuada tracks his sister to the B.P.R.D. headquarters using their magical bond, which causes them to share wounds and read each other's thoughts. Nuala hides the final crown piece before Nuada finds her, and he battles Hellboy. Nuada critically wounds Hellboy with his spear and abducts Nuala, promising her return in exchange for the crown piece. Unable to remove the spear shard in his wound, Liz and Abe decide to take Hellboy to the Golden Army's location in the [[Giant's Causeway]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. Krauss comes along, as he sympathizes with Liz, revealing that he too lost his wife in the accident that caused the loss of his own body.\n\nThey encounter the Bethmoora goblin master blacksmith who brings them before the Angel of Death to retrieve the spear shard. Though warned that Hellboy will doom humanity if he lives and that she will suffer the most from it, Liz pleads for Hellboy's life. The Angel removes the shard from Hellboy's chest and tells Liz to give him a reason to live. She reveals to Hellboy that he will be a father and he recovers.\n\nThe goblin leads the team to the resting place of the Golden Army, where Nuada awaits them. Abe gives him the last piece of the crown, and Nuada awakens the Golden Army and commands them to kill the team. Hellboy challenges Nuada for the right to command the army; as Hellboy is a member of Hell's royal family, Nuada must accept the challenge. Hellboy defeats Nuada and spares his life, but Nuada tries stabbing him. Nuala commits suicide to stop her brother; the dying Nuada tells Hellboy he will have to choose whether humanity or magical beings must die. Abe psychically shares his feelings with Nuala before she dies. Liz uses her [[pyrokinesis]] to melt the crown, deactivating the Golden Army.\n\nHellboy, Liz, Abe, and Johann resign from the B.P.R.D., and Hellboy contemplates his future life with Liz and their baby. Liz corrects \"babies\", revealing that she is pregnant with twins.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Hellboy 2 Shot 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Foreground, from left to right: [[Johann Krauss]], [[Abe Sapien]], [[Hellboy]], and [[Liz Sherman]]; Background: Prince Nuada, Princess Nuala]]\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as [[Hellboy]]: An immensely powerful demon who works for the government organization [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]] (B.P.R.D.).

I was really eager to come and play Liz with a little more vibrancy.\" Blair also had short hair for her role, avoiding long hair from her portrayal in the first film, which she felt \"brought her face down\". The actress emphasized Liz Sherman's growth in the sequel, \"She's looking to the future much more, and things are happening in this one that she has to buck up... I think you're dealing with a lot knowing this young girl that we last saw as very damaged, and now she's with this guy, and all these people around her, I think, we've really had to step up a strength, and a confidence in her so that I don't look like the little baby kid sister tagging along.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Edward | last=Douglas | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=6742 | title=Selma Blair Returns as Liz Sherman | work=[[Superhero Hype!]] | publisher=Coming Soon Media, L.P | date=February 1, 2008 | access-date=July 8, 2008}}</ref>\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as three characters:\n** [[Abe Sapien]]: An ichthyo sapien empath who works for B.P.R.D. with Hellboy.

Wink was sculpted by Mario Torres, and the costume was worn by Brian Steele. In the film, Wink's right arm has a giant metal fist. The fist was designed by filmmakers to be made of heavy plastic to stay light enough for motors to operate the mechanical fingers. The fist could also be physically detached and used as a projectile without any computer-generated imagery used.<ref name=creatures/> Several of Mike Mignola's comics characters wield similar mechanical fists on chains, including the Kriegaffes used by [[Herman von Klempt]].

I loved working for Legendary and I know for Guillermo working on ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' was one of his greatest experiences. The reason I loved working for them is because Guillermo was so happy. I came in six months into the shoot and he seemed as fresh as a daisy, simply because he was working for someone who appreciated and supported his outlandish visions of what he wanted to put on the screen.

He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity, but at the same time he becomes a much darker being. It's a very interesting ending to the series, but I don't think it will happen. ... We have gone through basically every studio and asked for financing, and they are not interested. I think that the [[Hellboy (2004 film)|first movie]] made its budget back, and a little bit of profit, but then it was very very big on video and DVD. The story repeated itself with the second already, it made its money back at the box office, but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print, but was very very big on DVD and video. Sadly now from a business point of view all the studios know is that you don't have that safety net of the DVD and video, so they view the project as dangerous.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2agklw/i_am_guillermo_del_toro_director_writer_producer/ciuvi56 |title=GuillermoDelToroHere comments on I am Guillermo del Toro, director, writer, producer.

Briggs began work on an outline with co-writer Aaron Mason. Titled ''Hellboy: Silverlance'', the script was a [[B.P.R.D.]] story featuring Abe Sapien as the main character with Hellboy in a supporting role. Moving into the new B.P.R.D. headquarters in Colorado, Abe is troubled by his psychic connection with Princess Nuala, and begins researching the elves' history. The film would have shown Nuada's adventures throughout history, including his rivalry with a fairy courtier who orchestrates Nuada's exile in hopes of marrying Nuala and seizing control of the fairy kingdom; Nuada first meeting Mister Wink by saving him from a troupe of soldiers during the [[Spanish Inquisition]]; and Nuada in [[Nazi Germany]], engineering a pact to keep various supernatural entities safe during [[World War II]] (with Nuada and Kroenen fighting in a \"friendly\" match for Project Ragnarok men.) Doug Jones would have played both Abe and the Angel of Death, who strikes a bargain with Nuada. [[Rupert Evans]]'s Agent Myers would also have returned. The story climaxed at the new B.P.R.D. headquarters, with the return of [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Rasputin]]'s summoning gauntlet. Universal wanted to proceed with the project, but it emerged that del Toro's ''Hellboy 3'' was still a possibility, so ''Silverlance'' was shelved.<ref name=\"silverlance\">{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/05/original-hellboy-writer-talks-hellboy-silverlance-the-abe-sapien-spin-off-movie-that-never-happened/|title=Original Hellboy writer talks Hellboy: Silverlance, the Abe Sapien spin-off movie that never happened|last=Jones|first=Jordan|publisher=Flickering Myth|date=May 10, 2017|access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Briggs received another call from Universal, saying that ''Hellboy 3'' had been cancelled and asking him and Mason to return for a reworked ''Silverlance'', with producer [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] involved.
