Based on [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], the film stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[James Earl Jones]] and tells the story of a barbarian warrior named Conan (Schwarzenegger) who seeks vengeance for the death of his parents at the hands of [[Thulsa Doom]] (Jones), the leader of a snake cult.\n\nIdeas for a Conan film were proposed as early as 1970; executive producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] and associate producer [[Edward Summer]] began a concerted effort to get the film made in 1975. It took them two years to obtain the film rights, after which they recruited Schwarzenegger for the lead role and Stone to draft a script. Pressman lacked capital for the endeavor. In 1979, after having his proposals for investments rejected by the major studios, he sold the project to [[Dino De Laurentiis]]; his daughter [[Raffaella De Laurentiis|Raffaella]] produced the film. Milius was appointed as director and he rewrote Stone's script. The final screenplay integrated scenes from Howard's stories and from the Japanese films ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' (1965). Filming took place in Spain over five months in the regions around [[Madrid]] and the [[province of Almer\u00eda]]. The sets, designed by [[Ron Cobb]], were based on [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] cultures and [[Frank Frazetta]]'s paintings of Conan. Milius eschewed optical effects, preferring to realize his ideas with mechanical constructs and optical illusions. Schwarzenegger performed most of his own stunts, and two types of sword, costing $10,000 each, were forged for his character. The editing process took over a year, and several violent scenes were cut out.\n\n''Conan the Barbarian'' was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] in North America and [[20th Century Fox]] in other territories. It premiered on March 16, 1982 in Spain and May 14, 1982 in North America. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike, mainly positive for its action sequences, production design, directing, visual style, and effects, but negatively received for its violent content and screenwriting, as well as some substandard performances. Despite this, the film became a commercial success for its backers, grossing between $68.9 million and $79.1 million at box offices around the world against its budget of only $20 million. However, the revenue fell short of the level that would qualify the film as a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]].\n\nThe film earned Schwarzenegger worldwide recognition. ''Conan the Barbarian'' has been frequently released on [[home video]], the sales of which had increased the film's gross to more than $300&nbsp;million by 2007. In the years following its release, it became a [[cult film]], and its success spawned a sequel, titled ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' (1984). It ultimately led to the production of a 2011 [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] [[Conan the Barbarian (2011 film)|of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nA blacksmith forges a sword and shows it to his son, Conan, as he tells him of the \"Riddle of Steel\", an [[aphorism]] on the importance of the metal to their people, the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians]]. One day, a band of raiders, led by [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]], massacre the Cimmerians; dogs kill Conan's father, and Doom takes the sword and decapitates Conan's mother. The children are taken into slavery and chained to work a large mill, the Wheel of Pain. Conan survives into adulthood, becoming a massive, muscular man. His master trains him to be a [[gladiator]]. After winning countless fights and receiving training and education in the East, Conan is freed. He is soon chased by wild dogs and seeks refuge in an Atlantean colonist warrior's tomb, where he retrieves an ancient sword. Conan wanders the world, encountering a prophetic witch in a hut and then befriends Subotai, a Hyrkanian thief and archer.\n\nFollowing the witch's advice, Conan and Subotai go to the city of Zamora to seek out Doom. There, they meet [[Valeria (Conan the Barbarian)|Valeria]], a female brigand. They raid the Tower of the Serpent, stealing jewels and other valuables (Including the greatest jewel of all: The Eye of the Serpent) from a shrine, and slaying a giant snake in the process. After escaping with their loot, the thieves celebrate, and Conan has sex with Valeria. The city guards capture the trio and bring them to King Osric, who requests they rescue his daughter, Princess Yasimina\u2014now a zealot in Doom's cult\u2014for a handsome reward. Subotai and Valeria refuse to take up the quest; Conan, however, motivated by his hatred for Doom and his desire for vengeance, sets off alone to the villain's Temple of Set, also known as the Mountain of Power.\n\nDisguised as a priest, Conan infiltrates the temple, but he is discovered, captured, and tortured. Doom lectures him on the power of flesh, which he demonstrates by hypnotically enticing a girl to leap to her death. He then orders for Conan to be [[crucifixion|crucified]] on the Tree of Woe. The barbarian is on the verge of death when he is discovered by Subotai and brought to Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds, who lives on a burial site for warriors and kings (and who narrates the movie as Conan's chronicler). The wizard summons spirits to heal Conan and warns that they will \"extract a heavy toll\", which Valeria is willing to pay. These spirits also try to abduct Conan, but he is restored to health after Valeria and Subotai fend them off.\n\nSubotai and Valeria agree to help Conan complete Osric's quest and infiltrate the Temple of Set. As the cult indulges in a cannibalistic orgy, the thieves attack and flee with the princess, but Conan is unable to engage Doom, who has magically transformed into a large snake and slithered away. Valeria is mortally wounded by Doom after he shoots a stiffened snake as an arrow at her. She dies in Conan's arms, acknowledging the price of the \"toll\" forewarned by the wizard in exchange for Conan's life, and is cremated at the Mounds, where Conan prepares with Subotai and the wizard to battle Doom. Conan asks Crom, the god of his people, to grant him revenge. By using booby traps and exploiting the terrain, they manage to slay Doom's warriors (including Thorgrim) when they arrive. Just when Doom's lieutenant, Rexor, is about to overcome Conan, Valeria reappears for a brief moment as a [[Valkyrie]] to save him from the mortal blow. After losing his men, Doom shoots a stiffened snake-arrow at the princess, but Subotai blocks the shot with his shield and the villain flees to his temple. The battle ends with Conan having recovered his father's sword from his enemies, a sword splintered by his own hand in battle.\n\nConan and princess Yasimina (who is no longer under Doom's spell and wants revenge for him trying to kill her) sneak back to the temple where Doom is addressing the members of his cult. Conan confronts Doom, who receives him with open arms and attempts to mesmerize him, but the barbarian resists and uses his father's broken sword to behead his nemesis. After the disillusioned cultists disperse, Conan burns down the temple and returns the princess to King Osric.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- This section is not a full expose on the characters in the film. -->\n<!-- It is a summary of published relevant real world information on the characters. -->\n<!-- In-universe items, if included, are only to support the above critical commentary. -->\n<!-- Unrelated in-universe items are trivial and undue for mention. -->\n<!-- Relevant rules: [[WP:WAF]], [[WP:MOSFILM]], [[WP:NOT]] -->\n\nThe character, Conan, and the world of Hyboria were based on the [[Conan the Barbarian|creations]] of pulp-fiction writer Robert E. Howard from the 1930s. Published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'', his series about the barbarian was popular with the readership; the barbarian's adventures in a savage and mystical world, replete with gore and brutal slayings, satisfied the reader's fantasies of being a \"powerful giant who lives by no rules but his own\".{{Sfn|Gunden|1989|p=28}} From the 1960s, Conan gained a wider audience as novels about him, written in imitation of Howard's style by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], were published. [[Frank Frazetta]]'s cover art for these novels cemented Conan's image as a \"virile, axe-wielding, fur-bearing, cranium-smashing barbarian\".{{Sfn|Helman|2003|p=276}} John Milius, the film's director, intended the film's Conan to be \"a Northern European mythic hero\".{{Sfn|Williams|2010|p=116}} [[Danny Peary]] described Conan as \"muscular, majestic, brainy, yet with ambivalent scruples\".{{Sfn|Peary|1986}} [[Maltese Falcon Society|Don Herron]], a scholar on Howard and his stories, disagreed, noting that the personality of Conan in the film differs greatly from that of the literature. The Conan in the books detests restrictions to his freedom and would have resisted slavery in a violent fashion, whereas the film version accepts his fate and has to be freed.{{Sfn|Herron|2000|p=177}} Robert Garcia's review of the film in his ''American Fantasy'' magazine states, \"this Conan is less powerful, less talkative, and less educated than Howard's\".{{Sfn|Gunden|1989|p=14}}\n\nThe female lead, Valeria, has her roots in two strong female characters from Howard's Conan stories.{{Sfn|Herron|2000|pp=125, 173}} Her namesake was Conan's companion in \"[[Red Nails]]\", while her personality and fate were based on those of [[B\u00ealit (Robert E. Howard)|B\u00ealit]], the pirate queen in \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\".{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=37}} According to Kristina Passman, an assistant professor of classical languages and literature, the film's Valeria is a perfect archetype of the \"good\" [[Amazons|Amazon]] character, a fierce but domesticated female warrior, in cinema.{{Sfn|Passman|1991|pp=90, 93}}{{Sfn|Schubart|2007|p=36}} [[Rikke Schubart]], a film scholar, said Valeria is a \"good\" Amazon because she is tamed by love and not because of any altruistic tendencies.{{Sfn|Schubart|2007|p=232}} Valeria's prowess in battle matches that of Conan, and she is also depicted as his equal in capability and status. The loyalty and love she displays for Conan makes her more than a companion to him;{{Sfn|Passman|1991|pp=91\u201393}} she represents his \"possibilities of human happiness\".{{Sfn|Passman|1991|p=104}} Her sacrifice for Conan and her brief return from death act out the heroic code, illustrating that self-sacrificing heroism brings \"undying fame\".{{Sfn|Passman|1991|pp=91\u201393}} Valeria's name is spoken in the film only after her death.\n\nMilius based Conan's other companion, Subotai, on [[Genghis Khan]]'s main general, [[Subutai|Subotai]], rather than on any of Howard's characters.{{Sfn|Sammon|1981|p=33}} According to film critic [[Roger Ebert]], Subotai fulfills the role of a \"classic literary type\u2014the Best Pal.\"{{Sfn|Ebert|1982}} He helps the barbarian to kill a giant snake and cuts him down from crucifixion; the thief also cries for his companion during Valeria's cremation, with the explanation that \"(h)e is Conan, a Cimmerian. He won't cry, so I cry for him.\"{{Sfn|Gunden|1989|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nConan's enemy, Thulsa Doom, is an amalgamation of two of Howard's creations. He takes his name from the villain in Howard's [[Kull (short story collection)|Kull of Atlantis]] series of stories, but is closer in character to [[Thoth-Amon]], a Stygian sorcerer in \"[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]\".{{Sfn|Williams|2010|p=116}} The Doom in the film reminded critics of [[Jim Jones]], a cult leader whose hold on his followers was such that hundreds of them obeyed his orders to commit suicide.{{Sfn|Ebert|1982}}{{Sfn|Kroll|1982}} Milius said his research on the ancient orders of the [[Order of Assassins|Hashishim]] and the [[Thuggee]] was the inspiration for Doom's snake cult.{{Sfn|Gallagher|Milius|1989|pp=177\u2013178}} In the original Howard stories, the worship of Set, though all too fearsome, is no sect; rather, it is the centuries-old formalized state religion of Stygia (which is virtually a [[theocracy]]).\n\n==Production==\n<!-- This section is not for personal theories and observations about the production. -->\n<!-- It is a summary of published relevant real world information. -->\n<!-- Simple associations are trivial and undue for mention. -->\n<!-- Relevant rules: [[WP:OR]], [[WP:MOSFILM]], [[WP:NOT]] -->\n\n=== Background ===\nFrom the 1970s, licensing problems had stood in the way of producing film versions of the Conan stories. [[Lancer Books]], which had acquired the rights in 1966,{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=31}}{{Sfn|Ashley|2007|p=138}} went into receivership, and legal disputes existed over their disposition of the publishing rights, which ultimately led to them being frozen under injunction.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=31}}{{Sfn|Turan|1980|pp=60\u201361}} [[Edward Summer]] suggested Conan as a potential project to executive producer Edward R. Pressman in 1975, and after being shown the comics and Frazetta's artwork, Pressman was convinced.{{Sfn|Sammon|2007|pp=98\u2013100}} Two years were needed to secure the film rights.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=31}} The two main parties involved in the lawsuit, [[Glenn Lord]] and de Camp, formed [[Conan Properties International|Conan Properties Incorporated]] to handle all licensing of Conan-related material, and Pressman was awarded the film rights shortly afterwards.{{Sfn|Sammon|2007|pp=100\u2013101}} He spent more than US$100,000 in legal fees to help resolve the lawsuit, and the rights cost him another $7,500.{{Sfn|Carney|1987|p=72}} The success of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977 increased Hollywood's interest in producing films that portray \"heroic adventures in supernatural lands of fables\".{{Sfn|Hunter|2007|p=156}} The film industry's attention was drawn to the popularity of Conan among young male Americans, who were buying reprints of the stories with Frazetta's art and [[Conan (comics)#Marvel Comics|adaptations by Marvel Comics]].{{Sfn|Turan|1980|p=62}}\n\n=== Development ===\nJohn Milius first expressed interest in directing a film about Conan in 1978 after completing the filming of ''[[Big Wednesday]]'', according to Buzz Feitshans, a producer who frequently worked with Milius.{{Sfn|Sammon|1981|p=25}} (Milius had long been an admirer of films like 1958's ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MILIUS: MIGHT MAKES A RITE: JOHN MILIUS|author=Pollock, Dale|date=May 14, 1982|work=Los Angeles Times|page=h1}}</ref>) Milius and Feitshans approached Pressman, but differences over several issues stopped discussions from going further.{{Sfn|Sammon|1981|p=25}}\n\n[[File:Oliver Stone 01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A man, wearing a coat and scarf, furrows his brow.|Oliver Stone (1987 photograph) was brought on to the project as a \"name screenwriter\".]]\n[[Oliver Stone]] joined the Conan project after [[Paramount Pictures]] offered to fund the film's initial $2.5 million budget if a \"name screenwriter\" was on the team.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=32}} After securing Stone's services, Pressman approached Frank Frazetta to be a \"visual consultant\", but they failed to come to terms.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=30}} The producer then engaged [[Ron Cobb]], who had just completed a set design job on ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979).{{Sfn|Sammon|Cobb|1982|p=65}} Cobb made a series of paintings and drawings for Pressman before leaving to join Milius on another project.{{Sfn|Sammon|1981|p=26}}\n\nThe estimates to realize Stone's finished script ran to $40&nbsp;million; Pressman, Summer, and Stone could not convince a studio to finance their project.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=32}} Pressman's production company was in financial difficulties and in order to keep it afloat he borrowed money from the bank.{{Sfn|Carney|1987|p=74}} The failure to find a suitable director was also a problem for the project. Stone and [[Joe Alves]], who was the [[second unit]] director on ''[[Jaws 2]]'', were considered as possible co-directors, but Pressman said it \"was a pretty crazy idea and [they] didn't get anywhere with it\".{{Sfn|Riordan|1994|p=99}} Stone also said that he asked [[Ridley Scott]], who had finished directing ''Alien'', to take up the task, but was rejected.{{Sfn|McGilligan|Stone|2001|p=18}}\n\nCobb showed Milius his work for ''Conan'' and Stone's script, which according to him, reignited Milius's interest; the director contacted Pressman,{{Sfn|Sammon|1981|p=26}} and they came to an agreement: Milius would direct the film if he were allowed to modify the script.{{Sfn|Gunden|1989|p=20}} Milius was known in the film industry for his macho screenplays for ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971) and ''[[Magnum Force]]'' (1973).{{Sfn|Beaver|1994|p=50}}{{Sfn|Gunden|1989|p=21}} He was, however, contracted to direct his next film for [[Dino De Laurentiis]],{{Sfn|Sammon|1981|p=25}} an influential producer in the fantasy film industry.{{Sfn|Nicholls|1984|pp=86\u201388}} Milius raised the idea of taking on ''Conan'' with De Laurentiis,{{Sfn|Sammon|1981|p=25}} and after a year of negotiations, Pressman and De Laurentiis agreed to co-produce.{{Sfn|Carney|1987|p=72}} De Laurentiis took over the financing and production, and Pressman gave up all claims to the film's profits, though he retained approval over changes to the script, cast, and director.{{Sfn|Carney|1987|p=72}} Dino De Laurentiis assigned the responsibility for production to his daughter, [[Raffaella De Laurentiis|Raffaella]], and Feitshans.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=31}} Milius was formally appointed as director in early 1979, and Cobb was named as the production designer.{{Sfn|Bruzenak|1981|p=53}} De Laurentiis convinced [[Universal Pictures]] to become the film's distributor for North America.{{Sfn|Sammon|2007|p=103}} The studio also contributed to the production budget of $17.5&nbsp;million and prepared $12&nbsp;million to advertise the film.{{Sfn|Flynn|1996|p=45}}\n\n===Casting===\n<!-- This section is not for personal theories and observations on the actors. -->\n<!-- It is a summary of published relevant real world information. -->\n<!-- Simple associations are trivial and undue for mention. -->\n<!-- Relevant rules: [[WP:OR]], [[WP:MOSFILM]], [[WP:NOT]] -->\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Summer said they considered [[Charles Bronson]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], comedian and ex-rugby player [[Jethro (comedian)|Jethro]] and [[William Smith (actor)|William Smith]]\u2014all of whom had played tough figures,{{Sfn|Sammon|2007|p=100}} but in 1976, the two producers watched a rough cut of the bodybuilding film, ''[[Pumping Iron]]'', and agreed that Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect for the role of Conan due to his huge, muscular frame.{{Sfn|Sammon|2007|p=101}} According to Schwarzenegger, Pressman's \"low-key\" approach and \"great inner strength\" convinced him to join the project.{{Sfn|Turan|1980|p=63}} Paul Sammon, writer for ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', said that the former champion bodybuilder was practically the \"living incarnation of one of Frazetta's paperback illustrations\".{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=30}} Schwarzenegger was paid $250,000 and placed on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]];{{Sfn|Andrews|1995|p=101}} the terms of the contract restricted him from starring in other sword-and-sorcery films.{{Sfn|Gallagher|Milius|1989|p=26}} Schwarzenegger said ''Conan'' was his biggest opportunity to establish himself in the entertainment industry.{{Sfn|Turan|1980|pp=63, 66}}\n\nThanks to Pressman's firm belief in him, Schwarzenegger retained the role of Conan even after the project was effectively sold to De Laurentiis.{{Sfn|Carney|1987|p=72}} Milius wanted a more athletic look on his lead actor, so Schwarzenegger undertook an 18-month training regimen before shooting began. Besides running and lifting weights, his routines included rope climbing, horseback riding, and swimming.

A more elaborate head was used for the close-up shots; this prop spurted blood and the movements of its eyes, mouth, and tongue were controlled by cables hidden beneath the snow.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|pp=42, 45}}\n\nAllder created a $20,000 {{convert|36|ft|adj=on}} mechanical snake for the fight scene in the Tower of Serpents. The snake's body had a diameter of {{cvt|2.5|ft}}, and its head was {{cvt|2.5|ft}} long and {{cvt|2|ft}} wide. Its skeleton was made from [[duralumin]] (an alloy used in aircraft frames) and its skin was vulcanized foam rubber. Controlled by steel cables and hydraulics, the snake could exert a force between 3.5 and 9.0&nbsp;tons. Another two snakes of the same dimensions were made, one for stationary shots and one for decapitation by Schwarzenegger.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=46}} The immense size of the mechanical snake meant that it did not fully fit onto the set, so only the front of it could be shown in the film.<ref name=Cinema&SorceryBook /> To create the scene at the Tree of Woe, the crew tethered live vultures to the branches, and created a mechanical bird for Schwarzenegger to bite. The dummy bird's feathers and wings were from a dead vulture, and its control mechanisms were routed inside the false tree.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|pp=51, 55}}\n\nAccording to Sammon, \"one of the greatest special effects in the film [was] Thulsa Doom's onscreen transformation into a giant snake\".{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=56}} It involved footage of fake body parts, live and dummy snakes, miniatures, and other camera tricks combined into a flowing sequence with [[lap dissolve]]. After Jones was filmed in position, he was replaced by a hollow framework with a rubber mask that was pushed from behind by a snake head-shaped puppet to give the illusion of Doom's facial bones changing. The head was then replaced with a {{convert|6|ft|adj=on}} mechanical snake; as it moved outwards, a crew member pressed a foot pedal to collapse the framework. For the final part of the sequence, a real snake was filmed on a miniature set.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|pp=57, 59}}\n\n====Optical effects====\n[[File:Opticalprinter.jpg|thumb|alt=Two camera, several reels, gauges and various block housings are mounted on a metal frame to form a machine.|VCE's special effects were composited with the live-action reels through a two-headed optical printer to create the final print.]]\nFew optical effects were used in ''Conan the Barbarian''. Milius professed ambivalence to fantasy elements, preferring a story that showcases accomplishments realized through one's own efforts without reliance on the supernatural. He also said that he followed the advice of Cobb and other production members on the matters of special effects.{{Sfn|Sammon|Milius|1982|p=26}}{{Sfn|Sammon|1981|p=36}} Peter Kuran's Visual Concepts Engineering (VCE) effects company was engaged in October 1981 to handle postproduction optical effects for ''Conan''. VCE had previously worked on films such as ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ''Dragonslayer''. Among their tasks for ''Conan'' were adding glint and sparkle to the Eye of the Serpent and Valeria's Valkyrie armor.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|pp=55, 63}} Not all of VCE's work made it to the final print; the flames of Valeria's funeral pyre were originally enhanced by the company, but were later restored to the original version.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=60}}\n\nFor the scene in which Valeria and Subotai had to fend off ghosts to save Conan's life, the \"boiling clouds\" were created by [[George Lucas]]\u2019s [[Industrial Light and Magic]], while VCE was given the task of creating the ghosts. Their first attempt filming strips of film emulsion suspended in a vat of a viscous solution\u2014elicited complaints from the producers, who thought the resulting spirits looked too much like those in a scene from ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', so VCE turned to animation to complete the task. First, they drew muscular warriors in ghostly forms onto [[cel]]s and printed the images onto film with an Oxberry [[animation stand]] and [[contact print]]er. The Oxberry was fitted with a used lens that introduced [[lens flare]]s to the prints; VCE's intention with using the old lens was to make the resultant images of the ghosts seem as if they were of real-life objects filmed with a camera. The final composite was produced by passing the reels of film for the effects and the live-action sequences through a two-headed [[optical printer]] and capturing the results with a camera.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|pp=55, 63}}\n\n==Music==\n\n<!-- This section is not for personal theories and observations on the music. -->\n<!-- It is a summary of published relevant real world information. -->\n<!-- Simple associations are trivial and undue for mention. -->\n<!-- Relevant rules: [[WP:OR]], [[WP:MOSFILM]], [[WP:NOT]] -->\n{{Listen\n| filename    = Anvil of Crom (sample) by Basil Poledouris.ogg\n| title       = Anvil of Crom\n| description = Blaring French horns and pounding drums distinguish ''Conan the Barbarian''{{'}}s main theme.\n| pos         = right\n}}\nMilius recruited his friend, [[Basil Poledouris]], to produce the score for ''Conan''; they had had a successful collaboration on ''Big Wednesday''.{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=291\u2013292}}{{Sfn|Thomas|1997|pp=324\u2013325}} The film industry's usual practice was to contract a composer to start work after the main scenes had been filmed, but Milius hired Poledouris before principal photography had started. The composer was given the opportunity to compose the film's music based on the initial storyboards and to modify it throughout filming before recording the score near the end of production.{{Sfn|Thomas|1997|p=328}} Poledouris made extensive use of Musync, a music and tempo editing hardware and software system invented by Robert Randles (subsequently nominated for an Oscar for Scientific Achievement), to modify the tempo of his compositions and synchronize them with the action in the film. The system helped make his job easier and faster; it could automatically adjust tempos when the user changed the positioning of beats. In the montage where Conan grows up, for example, Poledouris had Randles prepare, over the phone, a long accelerando that landed on precise moments in the picture along the way. Poledouris would otherwise have had to conduct the orchestra and adjust his compositions on the fly.{{Sfn|ASC|1982}} ''Conan'' is the first film to list Musync in its credits.{{Sfn|ASC|1982|p=783}}\n\nMilius and Poledouris exchanged ideas throughout production, working out themes and \"emotional tones\" for each scene.{{Sfn|Cook|1983|p=120}} According to Poledouris, Milius envisioned ''Conan'' as an opera with little or no dialogue;{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=292}} Poledouris composed enough musical pieces for most of the film (around two hours' worth).{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=294}} This was his first large-scale orchestral score,{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=294}} and a characteristic of his work here was that he frequently slowed down the tempo of the last two [[Bar (music)|bars]] (segments of beats) before switching to the next piece of music.{{Sfn|ASC|1982|p=785}} Poledouris said the score uses a lot of fifths as its most primitive [[interval (music)|interval]]; thirds and sixths are introduced as the story progresses.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|pp=171\u2013172}} The composer visited the film sets several times during filming to see the imagery his music would accompany. After principal photography was completed, Milius sent him two copies of the edited film: one without music, and the other with its scenes set to works by Richard Wagner, [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Sergei Prokofiev]], to illustrate the emotional overtones he wanted.{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nPoledouris said he started working on the score by developing the melodic line\u2014a pattern of musical ideas supported by rhythms. The first draft was a poem sung to the strumming of a guitar, composed as if Poledouris was a bard for the barbarian.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=171}} This draft became the \"Riddle of Steel\",{{Sfn|Larson|2006}} a composition played with \"massive brass, strings, and percussion\",{{Sfn|Thomas|1997|p=326}} which also serves as Conan's personal theme.{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=292}} The music is first played when Conan's father explains the riddle to him. Laurence E. MacDonald, Professor of Music at [[Mott Community College]], said the theme stirs up the appropriate emotions when it is repeated during Conan's vow to avenge his parents.{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=292}} The film's main musical theme, the \"Anvil of Crom\",{{Sfn|Thomas|1997|p=326}} which opens the film with \"the brassy sound of 24 French horns in a dramatic intonation of the melody, while pounding drums add an incessantly driven rhythmic propulsion\" is played again in several later scenes.{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=292}}\n\nPoledouris completed the music that accompanies the attack on Conan's village at the beginning of the film in October 1981.{{Sfn|ASC|1982|p=786}} Milius initially wanted a chorus based on [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' to herald the appearance of Doom and his warriors in this sequence. After learning that ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1981) had used Orff's work, he changed his mind and asked his composer for an original creation. Poledouris's theme for Doom consists of \"energetic choral passages\",{{Sfn|Thomas|1997|p=326}} chanted by the villain's followers to salute their leader and their actions in his name. The lyrics were composed in English and roughly translated into Latin;{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=293}} Poledouris was \"more concerned about the way the Latin words sounded than with the sense they actually made.\"{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|pp=170\u2013171}} He set these words to a melody adapted from the 13th-century Gregorian hymn, ''[[Dies irae]]'',{{Sfn|Larson|1985|p=349}} which was chosen to \"communicate the tragic aspects of the cruelty wrought by Thulsa Doom.\"{{Sfn|Thomas|1997|p=326}}\n\nThe film's music mostly conveys a sense of power, energy, and brutality, yet tender moments occur.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=167}} The sounds of oboes and string instruments accompany Conan and Valeria's intimate scenes, imbuing them with a sense of lush romance and an emotional intensity. According to MacDonald, Poledouris deviated from the practice of scoring love scenes with tunes reminiscent of [[Romantic music|Romantic period]] pieces; instead, Poledouris made Conan and Valeria's melancholic love theme unique through his use of \"minor-key harmony\".{{Sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=293}} David Morgan, a film journalist, heard Eastern influences in the \"lilting romantic melodies\".{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=167}} Page Cook, audio critic for ''Films in Review'', describes ''Conan the Barbarian''{{'}}s score as \"a large canvas daubed with a colorful yet highly sensitive brush. There is innate intelligence behind Poledouris's scheme, and the pinnacles reached are often eloquent with haunting intensity.\"{{Sfn|Cook|1983|p=120}}\n\nFrom late November 1981, Poledouris spent three weeks recording his score in Rome.{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=62}}{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=228}} He engaged a 90-instrument orchestra and a 24-member choir from the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] and the [[RAI National Symphony Orchestra]],{{Sfn|Koppl|Poledouris|2009}} and conducted them personally.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=228}} The pieces of music were [[Orchestration|orchestrated]] by Greig McRitchie, Poledouris's frequent collaborator.{{Sfn|Cook|1983|p=120}} The chorus and orchestra were recorded separately.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|p=175}} The 24&nbsp;tracks of sound effects, music, and dialog were [[downmixing|downmixed]] into a [[Monaural|single-channel]],{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|pp=172\u2013173}} making ''Conan the Barbarian'' the last film released by a major studio with a mono soundtrack.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|pp=167\u2013168}} According to Poledouris, Raffaella De Laurentiis balked at the cost ($30,000) of a [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] soundtrack and was worried over the lack of theaters equipped with stereo sound systems.{{Sfn|Morgan|2000|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\n==Release==\nIn 1980, the producers began advertising to publicize the film. Teaser posters were put up in theaters across the United States. The posters reused Frazetta's artwork that was commissioned for the cover of ''Conan the Adventurer'' (1966).{{Sfn|Heritage Auctions|2010|p=118}}{{Sfn|Sammon|2007|pp=26\u201327}} Laurentiis wanted ''Conan the Barbarian'' to start playing in cinemas at Christmas, 1981,{{Sfn|Segaloff|1981}} but Universal executives requested further editing after they previewed a preliminary version of the film in August. A Hollywood insider said the executives were concerned about the film's portrayal of violence. The premiere was delayed until the following year so changes could be made.{{Sfn|Churcher|1981|p=12}} Many scenes were excised from Thulsa Doom's attack on Conan's village, including the close-up shots on the severed head of Conan's mother;{{Sfn|Sammon|1982a|p=62}} the late notice of the changes forced Poledouris quickly to adjust his score before recording music for the sequence.{{Sfn|ASC|1982|p=786}} Other scenes of violence that were cut included Subotai's slaying of a monster at the top of the Tower of Serpents and Conan chopping off a pickpocket's arm in a bazaar.{{Sfn|Gunden|1989|p=27}} Milius intended to show a 140-minute story; the final release ran 129&nbsp;minutes (trimmed to 126 minutes in the United States).{{Sfn|Sammon|1982b}} According to Cobb, the total production expenses approached $20&nbsp;million by the time the film was released.{{Sfn|Mitchell|Ferguson|Cobb|1982|p=20}}\n\nThe United States' public was offered a sneak preview on February 19, 1982, in Houston, Texas. In the following month, previews were held in 30&nbsp;cities across the country. In Washington, D.C., the mass of moviegoers formed long lines that spanned streets, causing traffic jams. Tickets were quickly sold out in Denver, and 1,000&nbsp;people had to be turned away in Houston.

[[David Denby]] wrote in his review for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine that the action scenes were one of the film's few positive features; however, exciting as the scenes were, those such as the decapitation of Conan's mother seemed inane.{{Sfn|Denby|1982|p=68}} On the other hand, [[Vincent Canby]], [[Carlos Clarens]], and [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]] were unanimous in their opinion that the film's depicted violence failed to meet their expectations: the film's pacing and Howard's stories suggested more gory material.{{Sfn|M\u00e9rigeau|1982}}{{Sfn|Canby|1982a}}{{Sfn|Clarens|1982|p=28}} According to Paul Sammon, Milius's cuts to assuage concerns over the violence made the scenes \"cartoon-like\".{{Sfn|Sammon|1982b}}\n\nComparison with the source material also produced varying reactions among the critics. Danny Peary and Schickel expected a film based on pulp stories and comic books to be light-hearted or corny, and Milius's introduction of [[Nietzschean]] themes and ideology did not sit well with them.{{Sfn|Peary|1986}}{{Sfn|Schickel|1982}} Others were not impressed with Milius's handling of his ideas; James Wolcott called it heavy-handed and Kroll said the material lacked substance in its implementation.{{Sfn|Kroll|1982}}{{Sfn|Wolcott|1982|p=160}} The themes of individualism and paganism, however, resonated with many in the audience; the concept of a warrior who relies only on his own prowess and will to conquer the obstacles in his way found favor with young males.{{Sfn|Richards|1997|p=170}} Wolcott wrote in ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' that these themes appeal to \"98-pound&nbsp;weaklings who [[Charles Atlas#\"The Insult that Made a Man out of Mac\"|want to kick sand into bullies' faces]] and win the panting adoration of a well-oiled [[Beach bunny (surf culture)|beach bunny]]\".{{Sfn|Wolcott|1982|p=160}} Kroll's opinion was that the audience loved the violence and carnage but were cynical about the \"philosophical bombast.\"{{Sfn|Kroll|1982}} While popular with audiences, the theatrical treatment of the barbarian was rejected by certain hardcore fans and scholars of Howard's stories. A particular point of contention was the film's version of Conan's origin, which is at odds with Howard's hints about the character's youth.{{Sfn|Sammon|2007|pp=103\u2013104, 108}} Their point of view is supported by Kerry Brougher,{{Sfn|Brougher|1982|p=103}} but Derek Elley, Clarens, and Sammon said Milius was faithful to the ideology behind Howard's work.{{Sfn|Elley|1984|p=151}}{{Sfn|Sammon|2007|p=108}}{{Sfn|Clarens|1982|p=27}}\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's performance was frequently mentioned in the critiques.{{Sfn|Flynn|1996|p=48}} Clarens, Peary, Gunden and Nigel Andrews were among those who gave positive assessments of the former bodybuilder's acting: to them, he was physically convincing as the barbarian in his body movements and appearance.{{Sfn|Peary|1986}}{{Sfn|Clarens|1982|p=28}}{{Sfn|Gunden|1989|pp=15\u201316, 26}}{{Sfn|Andrews|1995|pp=100, 105\u2013106}} Andrews added that Schwarzenegger exuded a certain charm\u2014with his accent mangling his dialog\u2014that made the film appealing to his fans.{{Sfn|Andrews|1995|p=106}} [[Fanfare (magazine)|''Fanfare'']]'s Royal S.

At the start of the film, Conan's father tells his son to learn the secret of steel and to trust only it. Initially believing in the power of steel, Thulsa Doom raids Conan's village to steal the Master's sword. Subsequently, the story centers on Conan's quest to recover the weapon in which his father has told him to trust.{{Sfn|Grindley|2004|p=159}} Weaponry fetish is a device long established in literature; Carl James Grindley, an assistant professor of English, said ancient works such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', the [[Old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', and the 14th-century tale of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' pay detailed attention to the arsenal of their heroes.{{Sfn|Grindley|2004|pp=151\u2013155}} Grindley further said that ''Conan the Barbarian'', like most other contemporary action films, uses weapons as convenient plot devices rather than as symbols that mark the qualities of the hero.{{Sfn|Grindley|2004|pp=155, 159}} <!-- The Master's sword is unsound in its construction and impractical in use.  Similarly, the Atlantean sword cannot be used in combat, has no discernible history, and is engraved with nonsense.{{Sfn|Grindley|2004|pp=159\u2013160}} --> James Whitlark, an associate professor of English, said the Riddle of Steel makes the film's emphasis on the swords ironic; it gives the illusion that the weapons have powers of their own, but later reveals them to be useless and dependent on the strength of their wielders.{{Sfn|Whitlark|1988|p=115}} In the later part of the film, Doom mocks steel, proclaiming the power of flesh to be stronger. When Conan recovers his father's sword, it is after he has broken it in the hands of Doom's lieutenant during their duel. According to Grindley, that moment\u2014Conan's breaking of his father's sword\u2014\"[fulfills] a snickering spectrum of Oedipal conjecture\" and asserts Homer's view that \"the sword does not make the hero, but the hero makes the sword.\"{{Sfn|Grindley|2004|p=160}} The film, as Whitlark says, \"offers a fantasy of ''human'' power raised beyond mortal limits.\"{{Sfn|Whitlark|1988|p=115}} Passman and other authors agree, stating the film suggests that human will and determination are in a Nietzschean sense stronger than physical might.{{Sfn|Wolcott|1982|p=160}}{{Sfn|Hoberman|2000|p=30}}{{Sfn|Passman|1991|p=92}}\n\nAnother established literary trope found in the plot of ''Conan the Barbarian'' is the concept of death, followed by a journey into the underworld, and rebirth. Donald E. Palumbo, the Language and Humanities Chair at [[Lorain County Community College]], noted that like most other sword-and-sorcery films, ''Conan'' used the motif of underground journeys to reinforce the themes of death and rebirth.{{Sfn|Palumbo|1987|p=212}} According to him, the first scene to involve all three is after Conan's liberation: his flight from wild dogs sends him tumbling into a tomb where he finds a sword that lets him cut off his chains and stand with newfound power. In the later parts of the film, Conan experiences two underground journeys where death abounds: in the bowels of the Tower of Serpents where he has to fight a giant snake and in the depths of the Temple of Set where the cultists feast on human flesh while Doom transforms himself into a large serpent. Whereas Valeria dies and comes back from the dead (albeit briefly), Conan's ordeal from his crucifixion was symbolic. Although the barbarian's crucifixion might evoke Christian imagery,{{Sfn|Palumbo|1987|pp=213\u2013214}} associations of the film with the religion are roundly rejected. Milius stated his film is full of pagan ideas, a sentiment supported by film critics such as Elley{{Sfn|Elley|1984|p=151}} and [[Jack Kroll]].{{Sfn|Kroll|1982}} George Aichele, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religion at [[Adrian College]], suggested the filmmaker's intent with the crucifixion scene was pure marketing: to tease the audience with religious connotations.{{Sfn|Aichele|2002|pp=7\u20138}} He suggested, however, that Conan's story can be viewed as an analogy of Christ's life and vice versa.{{Sfn|Aichele|2002|p=8}} Nigel Andrews, a film critic, saw any connections to Christianity related more to the making of the film.{{Sfn|Andrews|1995|p=104}} The crucifixion is also reminiscent of Odin being nailed to [[Yggdrasil]] or the Titan [[Prometheus]] chained to the mountainside of the Caucasus.\n\n[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 056.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A man dressed in furs plunges his sword into the neck of a large four-legged snake-like creature.|Conan's slaying of Doom's giant snake in the Tower of Serpents recalls Siegfried's slaying of [[Fafnir]] the dragon (illustrated) in Wagner's ''Der Ring des Nibelungen''.]]\n\nMilius's concept of ''Conan the Barbarian'' as an opera was picked up by the critics; Elley and Huckvale saw connections to Wagner's operas.{{Sfn|Elley|1984|p=151}}{{Sfn|Huckvale|1994|p=133}} According to Huckvale, the film's opening sequence closely mirrors a sword forging scene in ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]''. Conan's adventures and ordeals seem to be inspired by the trials of the opera's [[Sigurd|titular hero]]: witnessing his parents' deaths, growing up as a slave, and slaying a giant serpent\u2014dragon. Furthermore, Schwarzenegger's appearance in the role of Conan evoked images of Siegfried, the role model of the \"Aryan blonde beast\", in the lecturer's mind.{{Sfn|Huckvale|1994|p=133}} The notion of racial superiority, symbolized by this Aryan hero, was a criticism given by [[J. Hoberman]] and [[James Wolcott]]; they highlighted the film's Nietzschean epigraph and labeled its protagonist as Nietzsche's [[\u00fcbermensch]].{{Sfn|Wolcott|1982|p=160}}{{Sfn|Hoberman|2000|p=30}} Ebert was disturbed by the depiction of a \"Nordic superman confronting a black\", in which the \"muscular blond\" slices off the black man's head and \"contemptuously [throws it] down the flight of stairs\".{{Sfn|Ebert|1982}} His sentiment was shared by Adam Roberts, an Arthurian scholar, who also said ''Conan'' was an exemplar of the sword-and-sorcery films of the early 1980s that were permeated in various degrees with fascist ideology. According to Roberts, the films were following the ideas and aesthetics laid down in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s directorial efforts for [[Nazi Germany]]. Roberts cautioned that any political readings into these sword-and-sorcery films with regards to fascism is subjective.{{Sfn|Roberts|1998|pp=110\u2013111}} Film critic [[Richard Dyer]] said that such associations with ''Conan'' were inaccurate and influenced by misconceptions of Nietzschean philosophies,{{Sfn|Dyer|2002|p=265}} and scholars of philosophy said that the film industry has often misinterpreted the ideas behind the \u00fcbermensch.{{Sfn|Jovanovski|2008|p=105}}{{Sfn|Solomon|2003|p=33}}\n\n''Conan'' is also seen as a product of its time: The themes of the film reflect the political climate of the United States in the 1980s. [[Ronald Reagan]] was the country's president and the ideals of [[individualism]] were promoted during his two terms in office. He emphasized the moral worth of the individual in his speeches, encouraging his fellow Americans to make the country successful and to stand up against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.{{Sfn|Shaw|2007|pp=267\u2013269}}{{Sfn|Saunders|2009|pp=48\u201349}}<!-- Hunter simply ascribed those films as having anarcho-individualism as a theme.--> Dr. Dave Saunders, a film writer and lecturer at [[South Essex College|South Essex College of Further and Higher Education]], linked facets of ''Conan the Barbarian'' to aspects of Reaganism{{Sfn|Saunders|2009|p=51}}\u2014the conservative ideology that surrounded the president's policies.{{Sfn|Kellner|2004|p=73}} Saunders likened Conan's quest against Doom to the Americans' crusades,{{Sfn|Saunders|2009|p=51}} his choice of weaponry\u2014swords\u2014to Reagan's and Milius's fondness of resisting the Soviets with only spirit and simple weapons,{{Sfn|Saunders|2009|pp=51\u201352}} and Doom's base of operations to [[Moscow Kremlin|the Kremlin]].{{Sfn|Saunders|2009|p=57}} Conan, in Saunder's interpretation, is portrayed as the American hero who draws strength from his trials and tribulations to slay the evil oppressors\u2014the Soviets\u2014and crush their un-American ways.{{Sfn|Saunders|2009|pp=53\u201358}} [[Douglas Kellner]] and his fellow academic Michael Ryan proposed another enemy for the American individual: an overly domineering federal government.{{Sfn|Ryan|Kellner|1990|p=226}} The film's association with individualism was not confined to the United States; Jeffrey Richards, a cultural historian, noticed the film's popularity among the youths of the United Kingdom.{{Sfn|Richards|1997|pp=23, 170}} [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]], a film critic, suggests that in most cases, there is only a thin veneer between individualism and fascism; he also said that ''Conan'' is the only film in that era to dispense with the disguise, openly celebrating its fascist ideals in a manner that would delight Riefenstahl.{{Sfn|Wood|2003|p=152}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |title =\n |quote = \"''Conan'' shows a world where there are two kinds of men\u2014one of which has long hair and gorgeous tits.\"{{Sfn|Schubart|2007|p=18}}\n |source = \u2014[[F.

Sandahl Bergman's Golden Globe for her role as Valeria marks her greatest achievement in the film industry; her later roles failed to gain her further recognition.{{Sfn|Flynn|1996|pp=79\u201380}} Dino De Laurentiis had produced a string of box office failures since the success of ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' in 1976; it appeared ''Conan the Barbarian'' might be a turning point in his fortunes.

Although the toy company abandoned the license after its executives decided ''Conan'' was \"too violent\" for children, Pressman convinced them to let him produce a film based on their new [[Masters of the Universe]] toy line.{{Sfn|Carney|1987|p=74}} [[Masters of the Universe (film)|The eponymous film]] cost $20&nbsp;million to produce and grossed $17&nbsp;million at the United States box office in 1987.{{Sfn|Twitchell|1992|p=248}}{{Sfn|Rossen|2008|p=169}}\n\nThose who benefited most from the project were Basil Poledouris and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

A planned third entry in the trilogy, ''Conan the Conqueror'', was previewed at the end of ''Destroyer''. The film had been planned for a 1987 release, with the intended director being either [[Guy Hamilton]] or [[John Guillermin]]. Arnold Schwarzenegger was committed to the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and De Laurentiis's contract with the star had expired after his obligation to [[Red Sonja (1985 film)|''Red Sonja'']] and [[Raw Deal (1986 film)|''Raw Deal'']], and he was not keen to negotiate a new one. The third ''Conan'' film fell into [[development hell]], and a derivation of the script eventually was adapted into ''[[Kull the Conqueror]]'', released in 1997.<ref name=PopCultureMedia-2007-05-20>{{cite web |url= http://popculture.com/entertainment/2017/05/20/arnold-schwarzenegger-conan-the-conqueror/ |title= Arnold Schwarzenegger Updates Status Of Next Conan Movie |author= Jamie Lovett |date= 20 May 2007 |publisher= Pop Culture Media |access-date= October 21, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190331204610/https://popculture.com/entertainment/2017/05/20/arnold-schwarzenegger-conan-the-conqueror/ |archive-date= March 31, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref name=MTV-2008-11-27>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/2760904/erics-bad-movies-kull-the-conqueror-1997/ |title= Eric's Bad Movies: Kull the Conqueror (1997) |author= Eric Snider |publisher= MTV |date= 27 November 2008 |access-date= October 21, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190916064745/http://www.mtv.com/news/2760904/erics-bad-movies-kull-the-conqueror-1997/ |archive-date= September 16, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, [[Universal Pictures]] announced plans for Schwarzenegger to return to the role of Conan for the film ''The Legend of Conan''.
