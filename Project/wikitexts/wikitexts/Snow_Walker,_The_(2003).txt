Based on the short story ''Walk Well, My Brother'' by [[Farley Mowat]], the film is about a Canadian bush pilot whose life is changed through an encounter with a young Inuk woman and their challenge to survive the harsh conditions of the Northwest Territories following an aircraft crash.{{#tag:ref|Farley Mowat's ''The Snow Walker'' is an anthology of Mowat short stories including \"The Snow Walker\", not related to the film.<ref>Mowat 2004, p. 125.</ref> |group=N}} The film won six [[Leo Awards]], including Best Lead Performance by a Male (Barry Pepper), and was nominated for nine [[Genie Awards]], including Best Motion Picture, Best Performance by an Actor (Barry Pepper), Best Performance by an Actress (Annabella Piugattuk), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Charles Martin Smith).<ref name=\"imdbawards\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337721/awards \"Awards for The Snow Walker.\"] ''IMDb''.

They are traveling with a sick young woman, Kanaalaq, and they ask Charlie to fly her to a hospital. Charlie suspects she has [[tuberculosis]]. At first he refuses, but when they offer him two valuable [[Walrus ivory|walrus tusks]] for his help, he reluctantly agrees to take her to Yellowknife.\n\nDuring the flight, his [[Noorduyn Norseman]] aircraft develops engine trouble, and they crash land near the shore of a glacial lake. Charlie and Kanaalaq are unharmed, but the aircraft is disabled. They are in the middle of a vast [[tundra]] in the [[Northwest Territories]], the radio is broken, and they have a meager amount of supplies. To make matters worse, he is hundreds of miles from the route he submitted in his original flight plan, so any rescue operation would not know where to look. Charlie is overwhelmed with a sense of doom, and he sees his Inuit companion as an unwelcome burden.\n\nCharlie estimates they are about 100 miles from the closest town. Believing their chances of survival are slim if they both wait with the aircraft, Charlie leaves Kanaalaq behind to look for help on his own. He soon learns, however, that he is unprepared for the challenges presented by this harsh and unforgiving land. One morning he awakens surrounded by a swarm of mosquitoes, which cause him to flee shoeless across the jagged rocks before collapsing unconscious. Kanaalaq appears above him and begins treating his wounds and bites with mud and moss. He awakes later, and is startled to find her. She feeds him and continues to care for him. Gradually, Charlie regains his strength and is healed through Kanaalaq's patient care. Charlie comes to appreciate this young woman's gifts, and together they learn to communicate with each other.\n\nAfter hearing the sound of a distant aircraft, Charlie realizes they never should have abandoned the crash site. He decides they should return to their aircraft, which he believes has surely been discovered by now. They set out together, but this time he is much better equipped with the watertight boots that Kanaalaq made for him. Along the way, the ailing young Inuit woman teaches the hot-tempered pilot the way to live in the tundra, and the two form a bond of respect and friendship. When they discover the ruins of another aircraft crash, Kanaalaq shows Charlie how to prepare a corpse for the afterlife in a stone burial cairn with the person's tools placed inside. She tells him that when a person is called to the afterlife, where there is much wildlife for hunting, they need the appropriate tools.\n\nWhen Charlie and Kanaalaq arrive back at the crash site, they discover no sign of rescuers, and Charlie becomes deeply depressed, convinced they will not survive the oncoming winter. Kanaalaq, however, understands how to survive in this harsh land, and she prepares a [[caribou]] hunt. She places [[inuksuit]] \u2014 multiple stone structures used by the Inuit to guide caribou into areas where hunters can easily harvest them. She is able to elicit Charlie's help, and together they kill three caribou, which will provide sufficient food and pelts for the winter.\n\nOne night, Kanaalaq reveals how her father died in a snowstorm, and how her mother wandered off to die so that her children would have enough food to live.  After Kanaalaq uses the pelts to create suitable winter clothing for Charlie, Charlie and Kanaalaq set out together across the tundra hoping to reach an Inuit camp or village to the north. In the coming days, Kanaalaq's condition worsens, and Charlie is forced to carry her on a sleigh he built using the valuable walrus tusks.  One morning, Charlie discovers that Kanaalaq too has wandered off so that he might live.  He follows her tracks in the snow, which lead to a [[Snowy Owl|white owl]]. He builds a stone burial cairn for Kanaalaq, placing her hunting and fishing tools, and the valuable walrus tusks inside for the afterlife.\n\nIn a snowstorm, Charlie approaches a small Inuit village, where he is welcomed.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as Charlie Halliday\n* [[Annabella Piugattuk]] as Kanaalaq\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Walter \"Shep\" Shepherd\n* [[Kiersten Warren]] as Estelle\n* [[Jon Gries]] as Pierce\n* [[Robin Dunne]] as Carl\n* Malcolm Scott as Warren\n* [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]] as Hap\n* [[Brad Sihvon]] as Mr. Izzard\n{{col-break}}\n* Greg Spottiswood as Mr. Moss\n* Samson Jorah as Sammy\n* William MacDonald as Miner in Bar\n* Mariano Aupilardjuk as Elder Inuk\n* Peter Henry Arnatsiaq as Young Inuk\n* Peter Ipkornerk as Inuit Snow Camper\n* Yvo Samgushak as Inuit Snow Camper\n* Michael Wallace as Inuit Snow Camper\n* Albert Kimaliakyuk as Inuit Snow Camper\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Screen shot The Snow Walker.png|thumb|A combination of full-scale aircraft and miniatures was used in ''The Snow Walker''.]]\nWriter-director Charles Martin Smith had played Farley Mowat in his autobiographical story ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]''. The Hollywood-shy author Mowat invited Smith to adapt any of his works. Smith chose the short story \"Walk Well, My Brother\" because of its simplicity, placing two people against the elements of the Northwest Territories, but incorporated elements from \"The Blood in their Veins\" and other, closely related Mowat stories in his screenplay.<ref>Mowat 2003, p. ix.</ref> Mowat later re-released in 2003, ''The Snow Walker'', an anthology of earlier short stories that included \"Walk Well, My Brother\" and featured a preface by Smith.<ref>Mowat 2004, pp. iX\u2013xi.</ref>\n\n''The Snow Walker'' cast Canadian actors in the primary roles, and numerous Inuit, including the lead actress [[Annabella Piugattuk]]. She was selected after the casting director reviewed hundreds of young women, many of whom were, like Piugattuk, non-actors. She was chosen for her fluency in both her native language and English, as well as her knowledge of native hunting and survival techniques, which brought verisimilitude to her role. Additionally, co-producer [[John Houston (filmmaker)|John Houston]] grew up in an Inuit village.\n\n''The Snow Walker'' was filmed entirely in Canada in the following locations:\n* [[Churchill, Manitoba]] (tundra scenes)\n* [[Merritt, British Columbia]] (caribou hunt)\n* [[Rankin Inlet]], [[Nunavut]]\n* [[Thompson-Nicola Regional District]], [[British Columbia]]<ref name=\"imdblocations\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337721/locations \"Filming locations for The Snow Walker.\"] ''IMDb''.

Showbiz'', Bruce Kirkland called it a \"powerful, poignant and transcendent film\", writing, \"''The Snow Walker'' is wonderfully acted, especially by Pepper\u2014who is as technically proficient as any young actor in Canada\u2014and by Piugattuk, who had never acted before, but displays a naturalism that allows her to display the emotional and spiritual nature of her people while still being an eccentric and intriguing individual. She is flesh-and-blood, not a type ... All the elements are subtly brought together under Smith's strong hand as director.\"<ref name=\"jam\">Kirkland, Bruce.
