It is based on [[Herman Wouk]]\u2019s [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning 1951 [[The Caine Mutiny|novel of the same name]].\n\nSet in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]], the film depicts the events on board a fictitious [[U.S. Navy]] [[destroyer-minesweeper]] and the subsequent [[court-martial]] of its executive officer for [[mutiny]].\n\nThe film was well-received by critics and was the second highest-grossing film in the United States in 1954.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''Variety Weekly'', January 5, 1955</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDuring World War II, newly commissioned Ensign Willis Seward \"Willie\" Keith reports to the [[Destroyer minesweeper|minesweeper]] USS ''Caine,'' commanded by Lieutenant Commander William De Vriess, also meeting the [[executive officer]] (XO), Lieutenant Stephen Maryk, and the communications officer, Lieutenant Thomas Keefer. De Vriess, popular with the men but disliked by Keith, is relieved by Lieutenant Commander Queeg. Keith is freshly out of college and officer candidate school and is courting May Wynn, who is not approved by his mother. Maryk is a career officer and Keefer is an aspiring novelist.\n\nQueeg attempts to instill strict discipline on the ''Caine's'' lax crew, which makes him unpopular with the officers and men.\n\nAfter a day of gunnery target towing, Queeg orders a turn to head back to [[Pearl Harbor]], but distracts himself by berating Keith and Keefer over a crewman's appearance. Ignoring the helmsman's repeated warnings, he allows the ''Caine'' to turn in a full circle and cut the towline, setting the target adrift. Queeg tries to cover up the incident.\n\nDuring a shore leave, May breaks off her relationship with Keith after she asks him to essentially choose between her and his mother, and he makes the wrong choice. Keith returns to the ship for its next assignment. \n\n[[File:Strawberry investigation - Caine Mutiny.jpg|thumb|left|275px|The \"strawberry investigation\".]]\n\nAssigned to escort a group of [[landing craft]] during an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|invasion of a small Pacific island]], Queeg abandons his mission before he reaches the designated departure point, and instead orders the dropping of a yellow dye marker, leaving the landing craft to fend for themselves. Queeg asks his officers for their support, but they remain silent and nickname him \"Old Yellowstain\", which implies cowardice.\n\nKeefer, believing Queeg to be [[Paranoia|paranoid]], encourages Maryk to consider relieving Queeg on the basis of mental incapacity under Article 184 of [[United States Navy Regulations|Navy Regulations]]. Though Maryk angrily rejects that possibility, he does begin keeping a medical log documenting the captain's behavior.\n\nWhen strawberries go missing from the officers' mess, Queeg convenes an elaborate investigation to determine the culprit. The investigation involves searching the ship and stripping all crew members. Convinced of Queeg's instability, Maryk asks Keefer and Keith to go with him to see [[William Halsey Jr.|Admiral Halsey]] about the matter. Arriving aboard Halsey's flagship, Keefer backs down and they return to the ship.\n\nAt the height of a typhoon, Maryk urges the captain to reverse course into the wind and take on ballast, but Queeg refuses. Maryk, supported by Keith, relieves Queeg of command under Article 184. The ''Caine'' returns to San Francisco, where Maryk and Keith face a [[court-martial]] for [[mutiny]]. Wounded [[Naval Aviator]], Lieutenant Barney Greenwald, an attorney before entering the Navy, becomes Maryk's defense counsel.\n\nAt the court-martial, Keefer claims he never observed any mental illness in Queeg and was \"flabbergasted\" when he was relieved. Under Greenwald's relentless cross-examination, Queeg exhibits odd behavior on the stand, and Maryk is acquitted.\n\nFollowing the acquittal, the officers of the ''Caine'' hold a party, where Keefer receives a frosty reception from Maryk. A drunken Greenwald arrives and berates all the officers for not appreciating Queeg's long service and failing to give him the support he asked for, instead deriding him as an incompetent, and claims their mistreatment of Queeg, who had been suffering from \"[[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder|battle fatigue]]\" from his previous tour in the Atlantic, caused the captain to ultimately become indecisive during the typhoon. He denounces Keefer as the real \"author\" of the mutiny and throws a glass of champagne, the \"yellow wine\", in Keefer's face. The rest of the officers walk out, leaving Keefer alone in the room.\n\nKeith, now married to May Wynn, is assigned to a new destroyer commanded by now Commander De Vriess.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Queeg_B.jpg|thumb|275px|The act of mutiny: Maryk's relief of Captain Queeg during the typhoon.|alt=]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Humphrey Bogart]] as [[Lieutenant Commander|LCDR]] Philip Francis Queeg\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as [[Lieutenant|LT]] Barney Greenwald\n* [[Van Johnson]] as LT Steve Maryk\n* [[Fred MacMurray]] as LT Tom Keefer\n* [[Robert Francis (actor)|Robert Francis]] as [[Ensign|ENS]] Willis Seward \"Willie\" Keith\n* [[May Wynn]] as May Wynn{{efn|Wynn\u2019s birth name was \u201cDonna Lee Hickey;\u201d she adopted her [[stage name]] from the character in Wouk\u2019s original novel.}}\n* [[Tom Tully]] as LCDR (later, CDR) William H.

He replaced the novelist with [[Stanley Roberts (screenwriter)|Stanley Roberts]], an experienced screenwriter. Roberts later quit the production after being told to cut the screenplay so the film could be kept to two hours. The 50 pages worth of cuts were made by [[Michael Blankfort]], who received an \"additional dialog\" credit.<ref name=tcmarticle />\n\nThe film differs from the novel, which focused on the Keith character, who became secondary in the film. The film instead focuses on Queeg.<ref name=\"Hischak\" /> Kramer \"mollified the Navy\" by modifying the Queeg characterization to make him less of a madman, as portrayed by Wouk, and more a victim of battle fatigue.<ref name=\"Johnson bio\" /> Studios did not want to purchase the film rights to Wouk's novel until cooperation of the U.S. Navy was settled.<ref name=\"tcmnotes\">TCM [https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/25162/the-caine-mutiny#notes Notes]</ref> Independent producer Stanley Kramer purchased the rights himself for an estimated $60,000 \u2013 $70,000. The Navy's reluctance to cooperate led to an unusually long pre-production period of fifteen months. Principal photography took place between June 3 and August 24, 1953 under the initial working title of ''Authority and Rebellion''.<ref name=\"tcmoverview\">TCM [https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/25162/the-caine-mutiny#overview Overview: ''The Caine Mutiny''], Turner Classics Movies (TCM)</ref>\n\n===Casting and director===\nStanley Kramer and Columbia Pictures intended  to cast Humphrey Bogart as Philip Queeg. [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Harry Cohn]] knew that Bogart wanted the part and took advantage of that fact, and he was eventually able to force Bogart to settle for much less than his usual $200,000 salary. \"This never happens to [[Gary Cooper|Cooper]] or [[Cary Grant|Grant]] or [[Clark Gable|Gable]], but always to me\", Bogart complained to his wife, [[Lauren Bacall]].<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">McGee, Scott [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/25162/The-Caine-Mutiny/articles.html \"The Caine Mutiny\" (TCM article)]</ref>\n\n[[Van Johnson]] was loaned to Columbia by MGM, where he was under contract. Being cast as Maryk was a breakthrough for the actor, who felt that he had been in a \"rut\" by being typecast in light roles. During the filming of the scene off Oahu in which Maryk swims fully clothed to retrieve a line, his character is warned that there are sharks in the water; these sharks do not appear on camera, but the actor's life was saved when a real-life Navy rifleman shot one which was approaching.<ref name=\"Johnson bio\">{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Ronald L.|title=Van Johnson: MGM's Golden Boy|date=2016|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781496803856|pages=159\u2013161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RG2PFR0tFSAC&pg=PA159|access-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> [[Lee Marvin]] was cast as one of the sailors, not only for his acting, but also because of his knowledge of ships at sea. Marvin had served in the [[U.S. Marines]] from the beginning of American involvement in [[World War II]] through the [[Battle of Saipan]] in 1944, during which he was wounded. As a result, he became an unofficial technical advisor for the film.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\" />\n\nBefore choosing Dmytryk for ''The Caine Mutiny,'' Kramer had hired the director for three low-budget films. Dmytryk had previously been [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]], and the success of the film helped revive his career.<ref name=\"Dmytryk memoir\"/>\n\nThe {{USS|Rodman|DD-456|6}}, a {{sclass|Gleaves|destroyer|0}} [[destroyer minesweeper]], was one of the ships chosen to represent the USS ''Caine'' in the film. The ''Rodman'' had one less smokestack than the actual {{sclass|Clemson|destroyer|1}}s on which Wouk served, and had more anti-aircraft guns. Completed in 1941, she was a much more modern ship than the 1918-manufactured ''Clemson''-class destroyer minesweepers had been. True to the theme of the novel, the actual minesweepers of Wouk's service, the {{USS|Zane|DD-337|2}} and the {{USS|Southard|DD-207|2}}, were both outdated ships by the time the film was made. The ''Zane'' was retired shortly after the war, and the ''Southard'' was scuttled in October 1945 after running aground in Okinawa with Wouk serving as Executive Officer. One of the primary inspirations for the book and the movie came from Wouk's experience as second in command of the ''Southard'' when she ran aground in Okinawa as a result of [[Typhoon Ida (1945)|Typhoon Ida]] in September 1945.<ref>{{cite web|title=USS Rodman|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/r/rodman.html|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|access-date=14 May 2020}}</ref><ref name=Janes-73>{{cite Jane's||310|1973 ships}}</ref><ref>Description of the ship Southard in the typhoon in Wouk, Herman, ''The Caine Mutiny,'' (1953) Little, Brown and Company, Boston, New York, London, pp. 344\u201357</ref><ref>Wouk ran aground on the ''Southard'' in Okinawa in 1945 in Carpenter, Frederick I., \"Herman Wouk\", College English, January, 1956, vol. 17, no. 4, 1956, pp. 211\u2013215.

After Stanley Roberts' shooting script was completed and approved by the Navy after 15 months of negotiations, the Department agreed to cooperate with [[Columbia Pictures]] by providing access to its ships, planes, combat boats, [[Pearl Harbor]], the port of [[San Francisco]], and [[Naval Station Treasure Island]] for filming. Dmytryk recalled in his memoir that after \"noisy\" protests from the Navy subsided, the film production received wholehearted cooperation.<ref name=\"Dmytryk memoir\" /> This included the conversion of two soon to be decommissioned destroyer/destroyer minesweepers, [[USS Thompson (DD-627)|USS ''Thompson'' (DD-627/DMS-38)]] and [[USS Doyle (DMS-34)|USS ''Doyle'' (DD-494/DMS-34)]], as facsimiles to portray the USS ''Caine''.<ref>[http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,806878-4,00.html \"Cinema: The Survivor\"], TIME Magazine, June 7, 1954</ref><ref>[https://www.destroyers.org/ships/dd-627/ USS THOMPSON (DD-627)] Destroyers.org</ref>\n\nAn epigraph appears on screen immediately following the opening credits that reads: \"There has never been a mutiny in a ship of the United States Navy.

Perhaps a dozen copies survive. [[RCA Victor]] planned an [[LP album|LP]] release with musical excerpts on the first side and the complete dialogue of the climactic court-martial scene on side two, but Herman Wouk believed that including this scene was an infringement on his recently opened [[The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial|Broadway play]] dealing with the court-martial. He threatened to prohibit Columbia Pictures from making any further adaptations of his work. According to Wouk, \"Columbia head Harry Cohn looked into the matter, called me back, and said in his tough gravelly voice, 'I've got you beat on the legalities, but I've listened to the record and it's no goddamn good, so I'm yanking it.'\"{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Max Steiner's score was finally released by [[Intrada Records]] in 2017 as Special Collection Volume ISC 382.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.10886/.f?sc=13&category=22848 |title=The Caine Mutiny; Original Music from the Motion Picture|work=store.intrada.com|access-date=August 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe film premiered in [[New York City]] on June 24, 1954, and went into general release on July 28.

The accompanying cover story (\"Cinema: The Survivor\") praised Bogart's portrayal of Queeg as \"a blustering, secretive figure in Navy suntans, who brings the hollow, driven, tyrannical character of Captain Queeg to full and invidious life, yet seldom fails to maintain a bond of sympathy with his audience. He deliberately gives Queeg the mannerisms and appearance of an officer of sternness and decision, and then gradually discloses him as a man who is bottling up a scream, a man who never meets another's eyes. In the courtroom scene, Bogart's Queeg seems oblivious of his own mounting hysteria. Then, suddenly, he knows he is undone; he stops and stares stricken at the court, during second after ticking second of dramatic and damning silence.\"<ref name=\"TIME\">\"Cinema: The Survivor\", TIME Magazine, June 7, 1954</ref>\n\nDirector Edward Dmytryk felt ''The Caine Mutiny'' could have been better than it was and should have been three and a half to four hours long to fully portray all the characters and complex story, but Columbia's Cohn insisted on a two-hour limit.<ref name=tcmarticle /> Reviewing the film in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Bosley Crowther wrote that the job of condensing Wouk's novel to two hours had been achieved \"with clarity and vigor, on the whole.\" His reservations concerned the studio's attempt to \"cram\" in \"more of the novel than was required\", such as the \"completely extraneous\" love affair between Keith and May Wynn, which Crowther found to be a plot diversion that weakened dramatic tension. Although he doubted whether the novel had a structure suited for film, he noted that Roberts had \"endeavored to follow it faithfully.\" The result, he argued, was that the court-martial became \"an anticlimax\" as it repeated Queeg's visible collapse seen in the typhoon but still considered the core of the film \"smartly and stingingly played\" and \"though somewhat garbled\" was still \"a vibrant film.\"<ref name=NYT>{{cite web |last1=Crowther |first1=Bosley |title=''The Caine Mutiny (1954) The Screen: 'Caine Mutiny' Arrives; Vibrant Depiction of Novel Is at Capitol'' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE1DB1438E23BBC4D51DFB066838F649EDE |work=New York Times |access-date= April 6, 2015 |date=June 25, 1954}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIt received seven nominations for the [[27th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Bogart), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Tom Tully]]), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].<ref name=\"Oscars1955\">{{Cite web|title=The 27th Academy Awards (1955) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1955|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706093921/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/27th-winners.html|archive-date=6 July 2011|access-date=2011-08-20|work=oscars.org}}</ref> Dmytryk was nominated for a [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].

He was later told by his agent that another actor was already using the same name, and that he had to come up with a new one immediately.
