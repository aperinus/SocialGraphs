The film was written and directed by John Payson, with computer-animated sequences supervised by [[Chris Wedge]] through [[Blue Sky Studios]]. It was the only MTV Films production not to involve [[Paramount Pictures]] (''[[Eli (2019 film)|Eli]]'', which was distributed by [[Netflix]], still had the involvement of Paramount).\n\nThe main focus of the story is the fact that, unbeknownst to many humans, [[cockroach]]es can talk, but prefer not to, as humans \"smush first and ask questions later\". They also sing (as they do many times in the movie) and even have their own [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channel. Actors providing the roaches' voices included [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]] (in his feature film debut), [[Jim Turner (comedian)|Jim Turner]], [[Rick Aviles]] (in his final film role before his death), [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[BD Wong]], and [[Dave Chappelle]]. Critical reception was largely negative, and the film was a [[box office bomb]].\n\n== Plot ==\nPenniless and straight out of the [[University of Iowa]], Joe ([[Jerry O'Connell]]) moves to New York needing an apartment and a job. With the fortuitous death of Mrs. Grotowski, an artist named Walter Shit ([[Jim Turner (comedian)|Jim Turner]]) helps Joe to take over the last [[rent controlled]] apartment in a building slated for demolition by convincing everyone that Mrs. Grotowski was Joe's mother. If Senator Dougherty ([[Robert Vaughn]]) can empty the building, he can make way for the prison he intends to build there, and uses thug Alberto Bianco ([[Don Ho]]) and his nephews, Vlad (Shiek Mahmud-Bey) and Jesus (Jim Sterling), to [[Landlord harassment|intimidate tenants]].\n\nJoe discovers he has twenty to thirty thousand roommates, all of them talking, singing cockroaches grateful that a slob has moved in. Led by Ralph ([[Billy West]]), the sentient, tune-savvy insects scare away the thugs in an act of [[enlightened self-interest]] that endears them to their human meal ticket. Tired of living on handouts from mom back in Iowa and after a series of dead-end jobs ruined by his well-intentioned six-legged roomies, Joe finds himself the unskilled drummer in Walter Shit's band. Hanging posters for SHIT, he encounters Senator Dougherty's daughter Lily ([[Megan Ward]]) promoting her own project, a community garden to occupy the vacant site surrounding Joe's building.\n\nA gift to Lily while working on her garden is enough to woo her back to Joe's apartment. However, the cockroaches break a promise to keep out of his business and a panicked Lily flees, only to discover the garden she'd worked on has been burned to the ground. During a fight with his roommates over his spoiled romantic evening, the building suffers the same fate as the garden. A mutual truce between the hapless and now homeless roommates leads the cockroaches to \"call in favors from every roach, rat and pigeon in New York City\" to try to make amends to Joe. Overnight, the roaches scour New York to gather materials to convert the entire area into a garden and take care of all the necessary paperwork to ensure harmony reigns over all.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Joe (AKA Joe F.

Payson said he was inspired by a 1987 short film called ''Those Damn Roaches'' and the 1987 Japanese film ''[[Twilight of the Cockroaches]]'', the latter crossing hand-drawn animation and live action. After the short received a [[CableACE Award]], MTV executives were impressed enough to discuss producing a feature adaptation with Payson. In 1993, MTV made a deal with [[The Geffen Film Company|Geffen Pictures]] during development to produce films based on the network's properties and release them through [[Warner Bros.]] While ''Joe's Apartment'' was put into production with a $13 million budget, a [[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America|feature film adaptation]] of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' was also put into development.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Marx |url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/geffen-and-mtv-pair-on-apartment-108474/ |title=Geffen and MTV pair on 'Apartment' |publisher=Variety |date=1993-07-07 |access-date=2015-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-17/business/fi-19392_1_david-geffen |title=The Geffen Camp Heh-Hehs All the Way to the Bank |publisher=latimes.com |date=1997-01-17 |access-date=2015-11-08 |archive-date=2015-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122073822/http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-17/business/fi-19392_1_david-geffen |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''Joe's Apartment'' was the first feature film [[Blue Sky Studios]] was involved in, having produced company logos and animated commercials before. Under [[Chris Wedge]]'s supervision, Blue Sky produced [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] sequences of the cockroaches. The film also blended them with scenes of puppetry, real cockroaches, and [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] animation (including the TV roach porn). Executives at [[20th Century Fox]] were impressed enough with ''Joe's Apartment'' to acquire Blue Sky, and eventually the studio became a feature-animation company.\n\n== Reception ==\nEven with the enthusiastic billing as \"MTV's first feature movie\" and the support of the company, ''Joe's Apartment'' [[Box-office bomb|bombed]] when it opened on July 26, 1996. Opening to 1,512 theaters but earning a dismal $1.8 million, the film closed all screenings in the middle of August and finished with only $4.6 million. Warner sold distribution rights for later MTV Film productions back to MTV's parent company, [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], not long after.\n\nReviews were almost universally negative, mostly distaste at the blending of grimy gross-out gags and up-beat musical humor. [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film one star out of four, stating \"''Joe's Apartment'' would be a very bad comedy even without the roaches, but it would not be a disgusting one. No, wait: I take that back. Even without the roaches, we would still have the subplot involving the pink disinfectant urinal cakes.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Ebert |date=2 August 1996 |title=Film Review: \"Joe's Apartment\" |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/joes-apartment-1996 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |access-date=11 June 2014}}</ref> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade of \"B+\" on a scale of A+ to F.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |title= Cinemascore |url-status = dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181220122629/https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/index/title/ |archive-date= 2018-12-20|access-date=2020-07-21 }}</ref> ''Joe's Apartment'' has an approval rating of {{RT data|score}} based on {{RT data|count}} professional reviews on the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average rating of {{RT data|average}}.
