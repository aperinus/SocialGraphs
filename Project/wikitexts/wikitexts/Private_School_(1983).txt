Meanwhile, three students of the nearby Freemount Academy for Men, including Jim Green (Matthew Modine) and his overweight, slobbish friend Bubba Beauregard ([[Michael Zorek]]), sneak into Cherryvale to [[voyeurism|peek]] on the girls. Jordan Leigh-Jensen (Betsy Russell), showering at the time, sees that the boys are peering at her and enlists Chris and Betsy's help to drive them away; the three boys fall off the side of the building. In response to being disturbed, the roommates light a bag of horse manure on fire and put it in front of Jordan's door.\n\nLater that night, at a co-ed dance, Chris reveals that Jim is her boyfriend; as the couple dance, Chris tells Jim that she has decided she wants to surrender her virginity to him. After a speech by headmistress Miss Dutchbok ([[Fran Ryan]]), the band plays a slow song while Jordan dances alone and conspires against Chris. Bubba, sporting an erection from slow dancing, sneaks off to the headmistress' office with Betsy to drink and have sex; however, the two are caught in the act by the headmistress and her friends. The following day, after morning aerobics and a sex education class, Chris books a hotel for Jim and herself.\n\nAfter another period of time, students of the two schools are riding horses together. Jordan trots past where Chris and Jim are talking and [[Exhibitionism|flashes her breasts]] at Jim. In revenge, Betsy steals Jordan's shirt, forcing the latter to ride topless in front of the headmistress ''et alumni''. That weekend, Jim goes to buy condoms, but is confused by the pharmacist ([[Martin Mull]] in an uncredited role) and ends up buying dental hygiene products; when Chris goes to buy the protection herself, she is distracted and eventually seen by Miss Dutchbok.\n\nAfter playing video games for a while in the arcade, Jim is embarrassed to talk romantically over the phone to Chris, while Jordan swears greater revenge. During the night, Betsy retaliates against Betsy and her roommate Rita ([[Kari Lizer]]) by snipping the stitches of their cheerleading uniforms. The next day, Coach Whelan ([[Julie Payne]]) accidentally grabs Jordan's top and during a cheer routine Rita and the coach are embarrassed when they each expose a breast to the laughter of their classmates and the catcalls of the boys' football team. As punishment for the prank, an angered Miss Dutchbok confines Jordan, Rita, Betsy, and Chris to campus for a week. That night, Jim, Bubba, and another friend [[Cross-dressing|dress as women]] and sneak into the girl's dorm. Jim is caught by Jordan, who teases him with a cold bottle and forces him to give her a massage. Meanwhile, Bubba meets up with Betsy for a tryst, but he leaves to smoke a cigarette before they have sex. As Bubba is on the ledge outside of Betsy's bathroom, he peers into Jordan's dorm room where Jim is massaging her on the bed. When Betsy goes to look for him, he is startled and falls off the ledge. Meanwhile, after Jim confesses to Jordan that he is in fact really a boy (which was already known to Jordan), she pretends to scream and kicks him out of the room, leading to Chris finding out about their indiscretion. Chris leaves the girl's sorority house, embarrassed and heartbroken.\n\nAfter several days of unsuccessfully trying to get Chris back, Jim asks Chris' father for his help in the matter during parent visitation day. After Betsy and he tells Chris to take Jim back, she does. Meanwhile, Jordan's father ([[Frank Aletter]]) has sex with her new stepmother while the chauffeur Chauncey ([[Ray Walston]]) listens in. Not long afterward, Miss Dutchbok, who has mistaken Chauncey for Mr. Leigh-Jensen (Jordan's father), has sex with him in the back of Leigh-Jensen's car. Bubba and Betsy, looking to have another tryst, climb into the front seat and turn on the loudspeakers, ensuring that the chauffeur and Ms. Dutchbok's indiscretion is known by everyone present at the program. Upon realizing what Bubba has done, Miss Dutchbok lunges at him, eventually resulting in the car rolling out of control down a hill, and going into the pool. Chris and Jim then leave for their night of romance at the hotel. After failing to have sex that night because Chris finds the hotel too kitschy, as well as getting sick from the room-service food and champagne, they have sex on the beach in the morning. Meanwhile, Bubba begins hitting on Jordan, eventually leading to Jordan paying him a midnight visit; when Betsy catches them together, she is apoplectic. The film ends with graduation day, where the graduating girls in the first-row moon the headmistress, Miss Dutchbok.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as Christine Ramsey\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as Jordan Leigh-Jensen\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Jim Green\n* [[Michael Zorek]] as Bubba Beauregard\n* [[Fran Ryan]] as Miss Dutchbok\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Betsy\n* [[Ray Walston]] as Chauncey\n* [[Sylvia Kristel]] as Ms. Regina Copoletta\n* [[Jonathan Prince]] as Roy\n* [[Kari Lizer]] as Rita\n* [[Julie Payne (actress, born 1946)|Julie Payne]] as Coach Whelan\n* [[Frank Aletter]] as Mr. Leigh-Jensen\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Birdie Fallmouth\n* [[Lynda Wiesmeier]] as Schoolgirl\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Drug Store Clerk (uncredited)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Private School'' was initiated in the wake of the surprise success of ''[[Private Lessons (1981 film)|Private Lessons]]'' in 1981.
