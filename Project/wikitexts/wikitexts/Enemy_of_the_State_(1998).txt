The film stars [[Will Smith]] and [[Gene Hackman]] and features an [[ensemble cast|ensemble supporting cast]] consisting of [[Jon Voight]], [[Lisa Bonet]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Dan Butler]], [[Loren Dean]], [[Jack Black]], [[Jake Busey]], [[Barry Pepper]], and [[Regina King]]. The film tells the story of a group of corrupt [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) agents conspiring to kill a congressman and the cover-up that ensues after a tape of the murder ends up in the possession of an unsuspecting lawyer.\n\n''Enemy of the State'' was released on November 20, 1998 by [[Buena Vista Pictures]] through its [[Touchstone Pictures]] label. The film grossed $250.8 million worldwide, and garnered positive reviews from film critics and audiences, with many praising the writing and direction as well as the chemistry between Smith and Hackman.\n\n==Plot==\nNSA official Thomas Brian Reynolds meets with Congressman Phil Hammersley to discuss a new piece of [[counterterrorism]] legislation that dramatically expands the surveillance powers of intelligence agencies over individuals and groups. Hammersley remains committed to blocking its passage, wanting to protect U.S. citizens' privacy. Reynolds, wanting the bill passed to obtain a long-delayed promotion, has Hammersley murdered, making it appear he suffered a heart attack. Meanwhile, labor lawyer Robert Clayton Dean is involved in a case implicating mobster Paulie Pintero. Dean meets with his ex-girlfriend, Rachel Banks; Rachel works for \"Brill,\" who Dean sometimes uses for undercover surveillance but has never met in person. She delivers a tape incriminating Pintero for labor racketeering, which Dean threatens him with.\n\nAs police investigate Hammersley's murder scene, Reynolds and his team notice a biologist swapping out a tape from a remote wildlife camera stationed across the lake. They identify the biologist as Daniel Zavitz. When Zavitz views footage of the murder, he immediately contacts a journalist to publicize the tape. Reynolds' team intercepts the call and rush to Zavitz's apartment. Zavitz transfers the video to a disc and hides it in an [[NEC]] [[TurboExpress]] game console before fleeing. He bumps into Dean, his old college friend. Panicked, Zavitz slips the disc into Dean's shopping bag without his knowledge. He runs into the path of an oncoming fire truck and is killed instantly, while Reynolds has Zavitz's journalist contact murdered.\n\nReynolds' team identify Dean and visit him disguised as cops. When Dean refuses to let them search his belongings, they later plant surveillance devices in his house and on his clothes. They also dissiminate false evidence that Dean is secretly on Pintero's payroll, laundering money and having an affair with Rachel. The subterfuge destroys Dean's life: he is fired from his law firm, his bank accounts are frozen, and his wife, Carla, throws him out. Dean asks Rachel to contact Brill for help. Reynolds intercepts the call and sends one of his men to impersonate Brill. The real Brill rescues Dean and warns him that the NSA is responsible for ruining his life. After Dean manages to evade the team, he is horrified to find Rachel shot dead in her home.\n\nDean finds the disc and shows it to Brill, who identifies Reynolds. The NSA agents raid Brill's hideout; Brill and Dean escape but the disc is destroyed. Brill reveals that his real name is Edward Lyle, a former NSA communications expert stationed in [[Iran]] during the [[Iranian Revolution]]. His partner, Rachel's father, was killed, but Lyle escaped and has been working covertly ever since, employing Rachel as a courier to watch over her. Lyle urges Dean to start a new life, but he insists on clearing his name. Dean and Lyle trail Congressman Sam Albert, a key supporter of the bill, and record a videotape of him with his mistress. Dean and Lyle hide an NSA listening device in Albert's hotel room, knowing that he will find it and then demand an internal investigation. Lyle then hacks into Reynolds' personal bank account and deposits large sums of money to make it look like he's being paid to blackmail Albert.\n\nA meeting is arranged with Reynolds to exchange the video and to get Reynolds to incriminate himself. Reynolds' men instead ambush the meeting and hold Lyle and Dean at gunpoint, demanding the tape. Dean, anticipating this, lies and says that the evidence is hidden at Pintero's restaurant, which is currently under [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] surveillance. He then tricks Pintero and Reynolds into believing that the other man has the \"tape\". The encounter quickly escalates into a deadly close-quarters firefight when a gangster shoots an NSA agent in the back; Pintero, his men, Reynolds, and the agents are  killed. During this ordeal, Lyle sends the FBI a live feed of the incident to trigger a raid on the restaurant before slipping out in disguise. Dean is rescued, and the conspiracy is exposed.\n\nCongress abandons the bill to avoid a national scandal, covering up the NSA's involvement to preserve the agency's reputation. Dean is cleared of all charges and reconciles with Carla. Lyle sends Dean a \"farewell\" message via his TV, partially showing himself relaxing on a tropical island with his cat.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as Robert Clayton Dean\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Edward \"Brill\" Lyle\n* [[Jon Voight]] as NSA Department Head Thomas Brian Reynolds\n* [[Regina King]] as Carla Dean\n* [[Loren Dean]] as NSA Agent Loren Hicks, Reynolds' [[aide-de-camp]]\n* [[Jake Busey]] as Krug, ex-[[USMC]] hired by NSA\n* [[Barry Pepper]] as NSA Agent David Pratt\n* [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] as Daniel Leon Zavitz\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as NSA Agent \"Fake Brill\"\n* [[Lisa Bonet]] as Rachel Banks\n* [[Jack Black]] as NSA Agent Fiedler\n* [[Jamie Kennedy]] as NSA Agent Jamie Williams\n* [[Scott Caan]] as Jones, ex-[[USMC]] hired by NSA\n* [[James LeGros]] as Jerry Miller, attorney \n* [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]] as Congressman Sam Albert\n* [[Ian Hart]] as NSA Agent John Bingham\n* [[Jascha Washington]] as Eric Dean\n* [[Anna Gunn]] as Emily Reynolds\n* [[Grant Heslov]] as Lenny Bloom\n* [[Bodhi Elfman]] as NSA Agent Van\n* [[Dan Butler (actor)|Dan Butler]] as [[Director of the National Security Agency|NSA Director]] Admiral Shaffer\n* [[Jason Robards]] as Congressman Phillip Hammersley\n* [[Seth Green]] as NSA Agent Selby\n* [[Tom Sizemore]] as Paulie Pintero, mob boss\n* [[Philip Baker Hall]] as Mark Silverberg, attorney \n* [[Brian Markinson]] as Brian Blake, attorney \n* [[Larry King]] as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe story is set in both [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Baltimore]], and most of the filming was done in Baltimore.

[[George Clooney]] was also considered for a role in the film. [[Sean Connery]] was considered for the role that went to Hackman.
