She also earned her third [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama]] award (her eighth [[Golden Globe Award]] win overall), and her second [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]]. The film also won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair]].\n\nThe film was loosely based on John Campbell's biography ''The Iron Lady: Margaret Thatcher, from Grocer's Daughter to Prime Minister''.<ref name=upppava>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/29/144449825/how-accurate-is-the-iron-lady|title=How Accurate Is 'The Iron Lady'?|newspaper=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with Thatcher in the present, then in a series of flashbacks, the audience is presented with a young Margaret Roberts working at the family grocer's shop in [[Grantham]], listening to the political speeches of her father, whom she idolised{{spaced ndash}} it is also hinted that she had a poor relationship with her mother, a housewife.  We learn she has won a place at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], revealing her struggle, as a young lower-middle-class woman, attempting to break into a snobbish male-dominated [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and find a seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], along with businessman [[Denis Thatcher]]'s marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a \"Lady Member\" of the House, and as [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]] in [[Edward Heath]]'s Cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with [[Airey Neave]], her decision to stand for [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]], her eventual victory, including her voice coaching and image change.\n\nFurther flashbacks examine historical events during her time as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], after winning the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget (over the misgivings of \"[[wets and dries|wet]]\" members of her Cabinet \u2013 [[Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar|Ian Gilmour]], [[Francis Pym]], [[Michael Heseltine]], and [[Jim Prior]]), the [[1981 Brixton riot]], the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|1984\u20131985 UK miners' strike]], and the [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing in Brighton]] of the [[Grand Brighton Hotel|Grand Hotel]] during the 1984 [[Conservative Party Conference (UK)|Conservative Party Conference]], when she and her husband were almost killed. Also shown is her decision to retake the [[Falkland Islands]] following the islands' invasion by [[Argentina]] in 1982, the sinking of the [[ARA General Belgrano|ARA ''General Belgrano'']] and Britain's subsequent victory in the [[Falklands War]], her friendship with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and emergence as a world figure, and the economic boom of the late 1980s.\n\nBy 1990, Thatcher is shown as an imperious but aging figure, ranting aggressively at her cabinet, refusing to accept that the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|\"Poll Tax\"]] is unjust, even while it is causing riots, and fiercely opposed to [[European integration]]. Her deputy, [[Geoffrey Howe]], resigns after being humiliated by her in a cabinet meeting, Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership, and her loss of support from her cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but reluctantly to resign as Prime Minister after eleven years in office. A teary-eyed Thatcher exits [[10 Downing Street]] for the last time as Prime Minister with Denis comforting her. She is shown as still disheartened about it almost twenty years later.\n\nEventually, Thatcher is shown packing up her late husband's belongings, and telling him it's time for him to go. Denis' ghost leaves her as she cries that she actually is not yet ready to lose him, to which he replies \"You're going to be fine on your own... you always have been\" before leaving forever. Having finally overcome her grief, she contentedly washes a teacup alone in her kitchen.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as [[Margaret Thatcher]]\n** [[Alexandra Roach]] as young Margaret Thatcher\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[Denis Thatcher]]<ref name=\"not2like\"/>\n** [[Harry Lloyd]] as young Denis Thatcher\n* [[Iain Glen]] as [[Alfred Roberts]], Margaret's father\n* Emma Dewhurst as Beatrice Roberts, Margaret's mother\n* Victoria Bewick as Muriel Roberts, Margaret's sister\n* [[Olivia Colman]] as [[Carol Thatcher]]\n* [[Anthony Head]] as [[Geoffrey Howe|Sir Geoffrey Howe]]\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as [[Airey Neave]]\n* [[Richard E.
