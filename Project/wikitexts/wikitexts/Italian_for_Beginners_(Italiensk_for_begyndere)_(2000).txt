Berthelsen]], Lars Kaalund and [[Peter Gantzler]], together with [[Ann Eleonora J\u00f8rgensen]], [[Anette St\u00f8velb\u00e6k]] and Sara Indrio Jensen. The film was made by the austere principles of the [[Dogme 95]] movement, including the use of handheld video cameras and natural lighting, and is known as ''Dogme XII''.{{r|LAnn\u00e9e du cin\u00e9ma 2002}}{{r|Willis 2003}} However, in contrast to most Dogme films which are harsh and serious in tone, ''Italian for Beginners'' is a light-hearted comedy.{{r|Mckiernan 2008}} It was made on a $600,000 budget{{r|Damon 2003}}, and went on to gross over 27 times that.{{r|boxofficemojo}}\n\nAfter the film's release, significant similarities between its plot and that of the novel ''[[Evening Class (novel)|Evening Class]]'' by [[Maeve Binchy]] were identified. The distributor, [[Zentropa]], paid an undisclosed sum in compensation to Binchy.{{r|Politiken 2010}}\n\n== Plot ==\nAndreas, a widowed pastor, arrives in a Danish suburb to take over religious duties from the previous pastor who, due to a crisis of faith after his own wife's death, has become irreligious and even punched the organist, causing him to be hospitalized. Believing his stay will be temporary, Andreas stays in the local hotel where he meets one of the employees, J\u00f8rgen Mortensen, who is suffering a crisis as he has been asked to fire the temperamental Hal-Finn who works in the hotel restaurant and is also his best friend. Hal-Finn goes to visit hairdresser Karen and is immediately attracted to her, though his visit is cut short when she must go to the hospital to attend to her alcoholic mother.\n\nMeanwhile, clumsy baker Olympia tends to her disabled and abusive father, who constantly berates her. Olympia decides to join a beginner Italian class in order to feel closer to her Italian mother, but the night she joins the class, the instructor dies. She returns home to find that her own father has died as well. Sometime later she learns that her estranged mother has died as well. At her funeral, she meets Karen, and the two discover that they are sisters and that their parents split them up when they divorced. In order to protect Olympia, Karen does not tell her that their mother was not Italian and was an alcoholic.\n\nAfter finally being fired for being rude to customers, Hal-Finn becomes the Italian teacher and Olympia persuades both Andreas and her sister to join. Karen and Hal-Finn begin a romantic affair but during Christmas Karen overhears Hal-Finn disparaging her mother, and angrily ends their relationship. J\u00f8rgen approaches Andreas for advice about his impotence and his trouble talking to Hal-Finn's Italian friend Giulia, and decides to ask her out for a walk.\n\nIn the meantime Olympia receives a letter from the bank telling her of a large inheritance from her father. She decides to spend it taking the Italian class to Venice. In Venice, J\u00f8rgen proposes to Giulia who accepts, Karen forgives Hal-Finn after he cuts off his too-long bangs, and Andreas suggests that Olympia, whose clumsy behaviour has caused her to be fired from 43 jobs, come to work as a chorister. He then reveals that he plans to stay in the parish.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Anders W.

Discussing the plot before the script was put into production, Scherfig said, 'My film is about people deciding that they have the possibility of becoming very happy and taking that chance. So it's the anatomy of a happy ending, you could say' (Kelly, 2000, pp. 126-7). Scherfig's critics were quick to point out that this does not seem very provocative.\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Politiken 2010\">{{cite web\n  | url         = http://politiken.dk/kultur/film/article973436.ece\n  | title       = Dansk succesfilm var kopi af irsk bog - Politiken.dk\n  | access-date  = 17 May 2010\n  | url-status     = dead\n  | archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100519104409/http://politiken.dk/kultur/film/article973436.ece\n  | archive-date = 19 May 2010\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Willis 2003\">{{cite book\n  | last        = Willis\n  | first       = J.A.\n  | title       = John Willis' Screen World\n  | publisher   = Applause Books\n  | year        = 2003\n  | url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=ub4zAQAAIAAJ\n  | language    = fi\n  | access-date = 20 February 2018\n  | page        = 239\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* Mette Hjort, ''Lone Scherfig's Italian for Beginners'', Museum Tusculanum Press, 2010. {{ISBN|978-87-635-3483-3}}.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0243862}}\n* {{DNFt|30937}}\n* [http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9C06E4DD123DF931A35753C1A9679C8B63  FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; \"Finding the Right Spark for a Guy With a Problem\"] [[New York Times]] 2 October 2001\n\n{{Lone Scherfig}}\n{{Festroia Best Film}}\n{{Warsaw Film Festival Audience Award}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Camcorder films]]\n[[Category:2000s Danish-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about language]]\n[[Category:Films based on Irish novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lone Scherfig]]\n[[Category:Films set in Venice]]\n[[Category:2000s Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:2000 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Danish multilingual films]]\n[[Category:Danish romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Dogme 95 films]]"}]}}}}
