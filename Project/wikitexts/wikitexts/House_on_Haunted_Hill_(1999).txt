The plot follows a group of strangers who are invited to a party at an abandoned insane asylum, where they are offered $1 million each by an amusement park [[Magnate|mogul]] if they are able to survive the night. Produced by [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[Joel Silver]], it is a [[remake]] of the [[House on Haunted Hill|1959 film of the same title]] directed by [[William Castle]], and features special effects by famed make-up artists [[Greg Nicotero|Gregory Nicotero]] and [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]].\n\n''House on Haunted Hill'' marked the producing debut of [[Dark Castle Entertainment]], a [[production company]] that went on to produce numerous other horror films, including additional remakes. ''House on Haunted Hill'' premiered on Halloween weekend in 1999.\n\nIn the tradition of William Castle's theater gimmicks, Warner Bros. Pictures supplied promotional [[scratchcards]] to cinemas showing the film, offering ticket buyers a chance to win a money prize, similar to the movie's characters. The film received middling reviews from major critics, but was a commercial success, opening number one at the [[box office]] and grossing $43 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2007, the film was followed by a direct-to-DVD sequel, ''[[Return to House on Haunted Hill]]'', which was released in both rated and unrated editions.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1931, the patients at the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane revolt against the staff headed by the sadistic Dr. Richard B. Vannacutt. The patients start a fire which engulfs the building, killing all of the inmates and all but five of Vannacutt\u2019s staff.\n\nIn 1999, Evelyn Stockard-Price is in a disintegrating marriage with Steven Price, an [[amusement park]] mogul. At Evelyn's insistence, Price stages her birthday party at the long-abandoned hospital. The building's owner, Watson Pritchett, is convinced it is evil, having lived there as a child when it was converted to a private residence. Five guests arrive for the party: film producer Jennifer Jenzen; baseball player Eddie Baker; former television personality Melissa Marr; Donald Blackburn, a physician; and Pritchett himself. The guests are not the ones Price invited and neither of the Prices know who they are. Despite this, Price continues the party's advertised theme, offering $1 million to each guest who remains in the house until morning; those who flee forfeit their $1 million to the others.\n\nThe building's security system is mysteriously tripped, locking everyone inside &ndash; a stunt which Price blames on Evelyn. Jennifer, Eddie and Pritchett search the basement for the control panel. While exploring the labyrinthine basement, Jennifer confesses to Eddie that her real name is Sara Wolfe, the recently fired assistant to the real Jennifer. She impersonated Jennifer hoping to win the prize money. Shortly after, Sara is nearly drowned in a tank of blood by a ghost impersonating Eddie, but the real Eddie arrives in time to save her. Melissa subsequently disappears, leaving behind a massive trail of blood. Price visits his assistant Schechter, who is supposed to be managing the party stunts, but finds him horribly mutilated. On the surveillance monitor he sees the ghost of Dr. Vannacutt walking around with a bloody saw.\n\nEvelyn seemingly dies in front of the others, strapped to an [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] table. Price pulls a gun on the guests, demanding to know who killed his wife. Eddie knocks him out and they lock Price in the \"Saturation Chamber\", an archaic [[zoetrope]] device that Vannacutt used to treat [[schizophrenia|schizophrenics]]. Blackburn volunteers to guard Price. When the others leave, he turns the chamber on, leaving Price to be tortured by the moving images and ghostly hallucinations. In Vannacutt's office, Sara and Eddie find a portrait of the hospital's head staff and realize that the party guests are descendants of the five survivors of the 1931 fire. Pritchett deduces that the spirits themselves hacked the guest list on Price's computer. The only exception is Blackburn, whose name does not appear among the staff.\n\nBlackburn is revealed as Evelyn's lover. They have faked Evelyn's death, plotting to frame Price for the murders, hoping one of the guests will kill him in self-defense. Evelyn heartlessly kills Blackburn, adding another victim, then releases a delirious Price from the chamber. Sara finds Price, covered in blood and with Blackburn's severed head nearby, and shoots him. Eddie and Pritchett arrive and bring Sara upstairs, after which Evelyn approaches Price to gloat. Price, protected by a [[bulletproof vest]] and posing as dead, attacks Evelyn. As they scuffle, Evelyn is thrown through a decaying door, revealing the evil entity of the house &ndash; The Darkness.\n\nThe shape-shifting creature, composed of the spirits in the house, consumes Evelyn, adding her spirit to its mass. Price then discovers Melissa's body. Shortly after, Pritchett is also killed by The Darkness, allowing Price to flee. Price tells Sara and Eddie that the only escape is through the attic. The Darkness seeps through the house, following them. Price opens a window in the attic, then sacrifices himself to give the others time to escape. Sara gets out, but The Darkness closes an iron gate, trapping Eddie.\n\nAs The Darkness entity prepares to assimilate Eddie, he reveals that he is adopted, and not a true descendant of the original staff. Pritchett's ghost appears and opens the iron gate. The Darkness is distracted by Pritchett long enough for Eddie to escape. Pritchett's ghost and The Darkness fades away as Sara and Eddie watch the sun rise. They find an envelope on the ledge, containing all five checks, made out to cash.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], a black and white film is shown, depicting the spirits of the 1931 patients torturing the Prices for eternity.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Steven H.

Warner Bros.

Two versions of the scene were shot, both taking place on a film set where Wolfe hands Jenzen a bag delivered for her; inside is a music box with a [[Jack-in-the-box|jack-in-a-box]]-trigger which cuts the handler's finger. Jenzen throws the box in the garbage, and Wolfe discovers the invitation to Price's party inside of it.<ref name=\"deleted\"/> This is why in the final cut of the film, Wolfe hesitantly introduces herself to Price as Jennifer Jenzen; in the final cut of the film, she later confesses to Eddie Baker about posing as Jenzen in order to receive her $1,000,000, but details surrounding the circumstances in which she received the invitation are sparsely revealed.<ref name=\"deleted\"/>\n\nAnother scene removed from the film last-minute, according to director Malone, was a scene in which Wolfe falls through a collapsing floor when she and Baker are being chased by the Darkness.<ref name=\"deleted\"/> After falling two stories below, Wolfe awakens in a subterranean [[cremation|crematorium]] filled with the ashes and corpses of the hospital's dead patients. There, she is attacked by reanimated corpses who rise out of the ashes, terrorizing her and tearing off her overcoat.<ref name=\"deleted\"/> As a result of the scene's removal, there remains a [[continuity editing|continuity]] error in the final cut of the film, in which Wolfe's overcoat disappears from her body in-between scenes.<ref name=\"deleted\"/>\n\nA final epilogue scene completing the Jennifer Jenzen story arc was also filmed, featuring Jenzen arriving at the house with a realtor, which she was claimed to now inherited. As she enters the front door, a bloodcurdling scream is heard, and the realtor is revealed to be Dr. Vannacutt.<ref name=\"deleted\"/> Director Malone said the scene ultimately was removed after the cutting of Jenzen's exposition scene, as well as for having a comical tone that did not fit with the rest of the film.<ref name=\"deleted\"/>\n\nAll three deleted scenes from the film were included on the 2000 Warner Bros.
