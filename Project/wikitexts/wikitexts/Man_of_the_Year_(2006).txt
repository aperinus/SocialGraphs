Robinson]], and starring [[Robin Williams]]. The film also features [[Christopher Walken]], [[Laura Linney]], [[Lewis Black]], and [[Jeff Goldblum]]. In the film Williams portrays Tom Dobbs, the host of a comedy/political talk show, based loosely on the real-life persona of [[Jon Stewart]]. With an offhand remark, he prompts four million people to e-mail their support; then he decides to campaign for [[President of the United States|President]]. The film was released theatrically on October 13, 2006, and was filmed in [[Toronto]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and in parts of [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"hamfilm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&&locations=Hamilton,+Ontario,+Canada |title=Internet Movie Database \u2013 List of Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario|access-date=2008-01-29}}</ref> ''Man of the Year'' received mostly negative reviews and earned $41.2 million on a $20 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nTom Dobbs is host of a [[news satire|satirical news program]], tapping into public frustrations with divisive, [[Special Interest Group|special interest]]-driven politics. Dobbs laughs off an audience suggestion that he run for president, but following online support, he announces his campaign on air. He gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in a national debate with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent, President Kellogg, and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Senator Mills.\n\nEleanor Green works at the Delacroy voting machine company, which will provide machines for the Presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings, via an e-mail that he deletes.\n\nDobbs takes the campaign a bit too seriously, to the chagrin of his manager, Jack Menken, and his show's producer, Eddie Langston. The night of the presidential debates, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs shifts back into comedy, keeping the audience laughing while making serious points. He continues his showman persona on the campaign trail, shaking up the political landscape and surging in the polls, but remains well behind Kellogg and Mills.\n\nOn Election Day, early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere, exactly as Eleanor predicted the voting system would report. Dobbs sweeps the 13 states in which he is on the ballot, taking enough electoral votes to be elected president. When Eleanor confronts Hemmings about the Delacroy computer error, senior executive Stewart turns her aside. While Dobbs and his team move from shock to celebration, Eleanor is attacked in her home and given an injection. The next day, she displays erratic behavior and is sent to the hospital, where tests reveal high levels of illegal drugs. Her workmate Danny visits and reveals he has been promoted, which she thinks is an effort to buy him off. He tries to convince her that she has a drug habit and that no one will listen if she goes public, but she decides that Dobbs will believe her.\n\nTraveling to Washington and impersonating an FBI agent, Eleanor explains to Dobbs that she was recently fired by Delecroy, but he is pulled away before she can explain the election results. Dobbs tries to contact Eleanor by calling Delacroy's headquarters, and Hemmings explains Eleanor was fired due to a drug problem.\n\nEleanor figures out the flaw in Delacroy's system \u2013 no matter the actual results, the system declares the winner as the name with double letters, in alphabetical order, so that Do\u2019\u2019bb\u2019\u2019s beats Kello\u2019\u2019gg\u2019\u2019, which beats Mi\u2019\u2019ll\u2019\u2019s. Eleanor calls Dobbs and he whisks her off to a Thanksgiving celebration with his friends. Smitten with her, he says he already knows about her drug problem, which she denies and tells him that the election result was wrong before leaving. Dobbs calls Eleanor, telling her that he will break the news the next day. She calls Danny, who informs Stewart, who preempts Dobbs' public announcement by announcing that Eleanor was caught attempting to manipulate the election for Dobbs but that her efforts had no impact on the polls. Dobbs' team turns against Eleanor, except for Dobbs. Eleanor becomes increasingly concerned for her safety, and sees Delacroy agents break into her motel room and take her computer.\n\nShe flees to a crowded mall, but is followed and apprehended by a Delacroy agent. She escapes and calls Dobbs from a pay phone, but another Delacroy agent drives his truck into the phone booth. Dobbs goes to the scene and talks with the injured Eleanor in her ambulance, where she convinces him of the truth.\n\nDobbs\u2019 friends encourage him to remain president, with polls showing that 60% of the nation wants him in office. That night, invited onto the [[Weekend Update]] segment of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', Dobbs announces that the Delacroy vote system was flawed, that Eleanor told her bosses but they covered it up and silenced her, and that he will not run in the new election that must now take place.\n\nPresident Kellogg wins a second term, Dobbs returns to hosting his satirical news program, with Eleanor as his producer and later his wife, and the Delacroy executives are arrested. [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] chooses Dobbs as [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Tom Dobbs\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Jack Menken\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Eleanor Green\n* [[Lewis Black]] as Eddie Langston\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Stewart\n* [[David Alpay]] as Danny\n* [[Rick Roberts (actor)|Rick Roberts]] as James Hemmings\n* [[Karen Hines]] as Alison McAndrews\n* [[Linda Kash]] as Jenny Adams\n* David Nichols as President Kellogg\n* [[David Ferry (actor)|David Ferry]] as Senator Mills\n* [[Jacqueline Pillon]] as Security Tech\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Tina Fey]] and [[Amy Poehler]] make cameo appearances as themselves as part of the [[Weekend Update]] skit on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nDirector [[Barry Levinson]] originally wanted [[Howard Stern]] for the starring role of Tom Dobbs, which would have been his second movie role after starring as himself in ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.
