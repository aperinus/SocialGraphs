The film stars [[Mike Vogel]], [[Vince Vieluf]], [[Adam Brody]] and [[Joey Kern]] as four teenage aspiring amateur skaters trying to make it in the world of pro skateboarding by pulling insane stunts in front of their pro skater idol. It was critically panned and [[box office bomb|flopped at the box office]], but has been received more positively by audiences.\n\n==Plot==\nFollowing high school graduation, skateboarder Eric Rivers and his best friends, goal-oriented workaholic Dustin Knight and misfit slacker Matt Jensen, have one last summer road trip together to follow their dream of getting noticed by the pro skater world \u2014 and getting paid to skate. When the legendary Jimmy Wilson's demo tour comes through, the boys figure that as soon as he sees their fierce tricks, he'll sign them up for his renowned team immediately, right? Unfortunately, the guys are intercepted by Wilson's road manager and can't get their foot in the door, much less their boards. Following their dream \u2014 and Wilson's national tour \u2014 the trio start their own skate team, reluctantly sponsored by Dustin and his college fund.\n\nAfter recruiting laid-back ladies man \"Sweet\" Lou Singer to join their crew and provide the van for their tour, team Super Duper launches the ride of their lives in an outrageous road trip from Chicago to Santa Monica. The professional scene doesn't exactly welcome nobody, but these outsiders stick together through extreme misadventures. In their quest to go pro, they meet professional vert skating champions Bucky Lasek, Bob Burnquist and Pierre Luc Gagnon, skate pro Bam Margera and his crew Preston Lacy, Ehren Danger McGhehey and Jason Wee Man Acu\u00f1a, as well as sexy skate chick Jamie as they grind handrails across America and force the skateboarding world to give 'em a piece of the action.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338077/plotsummary Plot Summary for 'Grind' (2003)].
