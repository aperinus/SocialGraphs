Ward]], and starring [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Lauren Holly]], and [[Rob Schneider]]. Co-starring [[Bruce Dern]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[William H. Macy]], and [[Rip Torn]], the film focuses on Lieutenant Commander Thomas Dodge, a capable (if somewhat unorthodox) [[U.S. Navy]] officer who fights to save his career after being saddled with a group of misfit seamen who have been brought together as the crew of his first command, USS ''Stingray'', a rusty, obsolete [[World War II]]-era diesel submarine that is the focus of a special naval [[military exercise|war game]], supervised by a bitter rival who is fighting to bury his career by any means necessary.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Thomas Dodge is being considered for a third time to captain a submarine. He has been previously passed over because of his unorthodox command methods that include a \"brushing\" incident with a [[Russian Navy|Russian]] submarine near the port of Murmansk, Russia, and a genital tattoo reading \"Welcome Aboard\" that he acquired afterward while drunk on [[shore leave]]. Another denial will result in Dodge's dismissal from the Navy's submarine command program. \n\n[[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] Yancy Graham, who dislikes Dodge, speaks out against Dodge's promotion, but [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] Dean Winslow, [[COMSUBLANT|Commander, Submarine Force Atlantic]], who likes Dodge and his methods, selects him to participate in a [[Military exercise|war game]] to test the Navy's defenses against attack from [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered submarines. Russia has been selling off their diesel fleet to America's adversaries, so Dodge is given command of the World War II-era {{Sclass|Balao|submarine|0}} diesel-powered submarine, USS ''Stingray''. His orders are to \"invade\" [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] harbor without being detected, and if successful, to sink a dummy warship in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] harbor with two live torpedoes. Though initially reluctant to participate, Dodge offers Winslow a wager: if he successfully completes both tasks, Winslow will give him a nuclear submarine to command. Winslow agrees to consider it, instructing Dodge to \"think like a pirate\" during the exercise.\n\nGraham, boasting that he has never lost a war game and motivated by his own ambition, handpicks \"the crew from hell\" for ''Stingray'': hot-tempered, uptight Lieutenant Martin G. Pascal as the [[executive officer]]; crusty civilian naval contractor Howard as the Chief Engineer; rebellious Engineman 1st Class Brad Stepanak; ultra sharp-eared Sonarman 2nd Class E.T. \"Sonar\" Lovacelli; compulsive gambler Seaman Stanley \"Spots\" Sylvesterson; former losing college basketball player Seaman Jefferson \"Stoneball\" Jackson; shock-prone (and shock-addled) [[Electrician's mate|Electrician's Mate]] Michael Nitro; and not-so-[[Culinary Specialist (United States Navy)|Culinary Specialist]] Second Class Buckman as ''Stingray''{{'}}s cook. Additionally, Graham assigns Lieutenant Emily Lake as the sub's Diving Officer, part of a \"special program\" to see if women can successfully serve aboard submarines.\n\nUsing a storm off the Carolina coast as a diversion, Dodge and his crew take full advantage of the gale. To offset their technological disadvantage, they use deception to sneak into Charleston Harbor and set off signal flares. Upset at losing the first part of the war game and desperate to defeat Dodge, Graham halves the game's containment area without Winslow's authorization. Running into trouble on their first attempt at Norfolk harbor, Dodge leaves the containment area and heads out to sea, cutting off all contact with the Navy. Irate at this lapse in protocol, the zealous by-the-book Pascal openly accuses Dodge of hijacking his own boat and attempts to relieve him of command. ''Stingray''{{'}}s crew, weary of Pascal's berating and harassment, refuse to support his action, and Dodge charges Pascal with attempted [[mutiny]]. On deck, Lake looks on as Dodge and the crew, wearing makeshift buccaneer outfits and [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day|speaking like pirates]], commit a [[mock execution]] by blindfolding Pascal and making him [[Walking the plank|walk the plank]] into the raised net of a waiting fishing trawler that will take him ashore.\n\nDuring the Stingray's second attempt at Norfolk, Graham, hellbent on stopping Dodge, assumes command of the {{Sclass|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} attack submarine USS ''Orlando'', headed by Commander Carl Knox. Dodge employs an incredibly dangerous maneuver: passing ''Stingray'' between the huge propellers of a commercial supertanker to avoid sonar detection by the naval ships and aircraft protecting the approach to Norfolk. ''Orlando'' eventually locates and chases down the ''Stingray''. By the time his boat is targeted, Dodge has fired two live torpedoes at {{convert|900|yd|m}} into a target ship anchored in Norfolk harbor, thereby winning the war game.\n\nAfter Dodge's crew returns to port, Winslow chastises Graham for attempting to undermine Dodge's success and also denies Graham's promotion.  He then goes on to congratulate Dodge and informs him that he will now be given command of a new {{Sclass|Seawolf|submarine|1}}, along with a proper crew to man her. Dodge respectfully requests that his entire ''Stingray'' crew be transferred with him, to which Winslow agrees, also revealing that crewman Stepanak is his son. After Dodge dismisses his crew to begin a well-earned shore leave, Lake casually asks him as both of them leave the dock, \"What exactly is this tattoo I keep hearing about?\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kelsey Grammer]] as Lieutenant Commander Thomas \"Tom\" Dodge, Commanding Officer, USS ''Stingray''\n*[[Lauren Holly]] as Lieutenant Emily Lake, Diving Officer\n*[[Rob Schneider]] as Lieutenant Martin G. \"Marty\" Pascal, Executive Officer\n*[[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Howard, Chief Engineer of ''Stingray''\n*[[Rip Torn]] as Vice Admiral Dean Winslow, Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Navy [[Atlantic Fleet (United States)|Atlantic Fleet]] ([[COMSUBLANT]])\n*[[Bruce Dern]] as Rear Admiral Yancy Graham, Blue Team leader of the war game\n*[[William H.

The target ship that is torpedoed and sunk, ending the film's war game, is both naval stock footage of the {{USS|Fletcher|DD-445|6}} and a prop shooting miniature.

It\u2019s good-natured, innocuous frivolity that should raise a few smiles...\" However, [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt, \"The tone of the acting, which is set by Mr. Grammer's blandly laid-back performance, is all wrong for a genre that demands over-the-top hamming\". Holden also wrote that the film does manage to provide \"a couple of amusing bits\", but \"The energy level of ''Down Periscope'' is so low that moments like these, which should flare hilariously, reach a wan flicker\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980DE5DF1E39F932A35750C0A960958260 | title=Down Periscope | work=[[The New York Times]] | access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* ''[[Operation Petticoat]]'' (1959)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0116130}}\n* {{AllMovie title|136093}}\n* {{TCMDb title|443012}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|down_periscope}}\n* {{Mojo title|downperiscope}}\n* {{Metacritic film}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n\n{{David S.
