It stars [[Danny McBride]], [[James Franco]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Zooey Deschanel]] and [[Justin Theroux]]. Written by McBride and [[Ben Best]], the film was released on April 8, 2011.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1240982/releaseinfo Release dates for ''Your Highness'']. [[IMDb]]. Retrieved August 23, 2009.</ref> It follows an arrogant prince and his brother on a quest to kill the sorcerer and save the bride and their father's kingdom. The film received negative reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing $28 million worldwide against a $50 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nThadeous and Fabious are sons of King Tallious in the Kingdom of Mourne. Fabious is dashing and skilled and Thadeous is lazy and ineffectual. While celebrating victory over the evil sorcerer, Leezar, who has been ravaging Tallious's kingdom, Fabious presents the virgin Belladonna whom he has freed from a tower and wishes to marry.\n\nThough his brother makes him best man, Thadeous skips the wedding after overhearing Fabious' Knights Elite, led by Boremont, talk about him negatively. The wedding is then crashed by Leezar, who admits being the one who placed Belladonna in the tower. Leezar re-kidnaps her and flees. Returning to the castle with his servant and best friend Courtney, Thadeous is given an ultimatum: join Fabious on his quest to rescue Belladonna or be banished.\n\nVisiting the Great Wize Wizard, Thadeous and Fabious learn that Leezar's goal is to fulfill a prophecy: a warlock having sex with a virgin when the two moons converge, will impregnate her with a dragon that will allow him to take over King Tallious' kingdom. To destroy Leezar, they are given a magic compass that will lead them to the Blade of Unicorn, located within a labyrinth. On the way there, they learn Fabious's eunuch slave, Julie, has been informing Leezar of their progress and the Knights Elite are serving the warlock.\n\nAfter the knights are killed and he escapes, Fabious sends his mechanical bird Simon to warn the king of the betrayal by the Knights Elite, requesting reinforcements. Thadeous, Fabious and Courtney are captured by wild women led by the savage warlord Marteetee, who imprisons them in an arena, where Fabious kills off Marteetee's finest warrior. In retaliation, Marteetee summons a [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]]-like monster to kill them. The brothers are rescued by Isabel, a warrior seeking revenge for her father's murder at Marteetee's hands.\n\nLater that night, Thadeous learns Isabel is also after Leezar to avenge the slaughter of her brothers. The next day, the party learns too late that Isabel stole the compass from Thadeous. Fabious, finally angered by his brother's selfishness, decides to find the Blade of Unicorn alone. Thadeous and Courtney go to a tavern, where they find Isabel and retrieve the compass. Finding that his brother has been captured by Leezar's men, Thadeous wins Isabel over as they join forces, entering the labyrinth where they encounter a [[Minotaur]].\n\nAfter becoming separated from the others, Thadeous retrieves the Blade of Unicorn and slays the Minotaur. Thadeous and his group make their way to Leezar's castle and free Fabious, giving him the Blade. As the others kill off Julie, Boremont and his men and Leezar's three witches, Fabious impales Leezar with the Blade of Unicorn, preventing him from raping Belladonna.\n\nAfter their victory, Isabel leaves for another quest and the heroes return home. Some time later, Fabious and Belladonna marry, while Thadeous is approached by a returning Isabel, who reveals that she has fallen in love with him. However, for them to have sex, he must first slay the witch who has cast a spell on her, locking her in a [[chastity belt]]. Though not in the mood to go out, Isabel's suggestion convinces him to go on a new adventure.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Prince Thadeous\n* [[James Franco]] as Prince Fabious\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Isabel\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Belladonna\n* [[Justin Theroux]] as Leezar\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Julie\n* [[Damian Lewis]] as Boremont\n* [[Rasmus Hardiker]] as Courtney\n* [[Caroline Grace-Cassidy]] as Handmaiden\n* [[Simon Farnaby]] as Manious the Bold\n* [[Deobia Oparei]] as Thundarian\n* [[Charles Dance]] as King Tallious\n* [[John Fricker]] as Marteetee\n* Matyelok Gibbs, [[Angela Pleasence]] and Anna Barry as Helinda, Sariah and Marlyne, Leezar's three Mothers\n* [[Charles Shaughnessy]] as Narrator / Soul of the Labyrinth\n* [[Rhian Sugden]], [[Amii Grove]] and [[Madison Welch]] as Forest Women\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film had been a passion project of Green's for a long time, with him later calling it, \"an entirely self-indulgent dream project for the 11-year-old in me.\"<ref name=\"IWire\">{{cite web|last1=Perez|first1=Rodrigo|title=David Gordon Green \"Embraces The Cliches\" Of Mainstream Comedy; Says 'The Sitter' DVD Will Have Some Wild, Dark & Absurd Extras|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2011/12/david-gordon-green-embraces-the-cliches-of-mainstream-comedy-says-the-sitter-dvd-will-have-some-wild-dark-absurd-extras-114175/|website=Indiewire|access-date=20 March 2017|date=December 8, 2011}}</ref> Although marketed as a [[Parody|spoof]] of '80s fantasy movies,<ref name=\"IWire\"/> Green has said that this was not his intent.
