It is the third [[film adaptation]] of the [[Morton Freedgood|John Godey]] novel [[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (novel)|of the same name]] (following the [[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974 film)|1974 theatrical film]] and [[The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1998 film)|1998 television film]]). The film is about a [[train dispatcher]] ([[Denzel Washington]]), who is pressed into the role of negotiator after a criminal ([[John Travolta]]) hijacks a subway car of passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=37612|title=The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three|work=ComingSoon.net|access-date=December 25, 2008}}</ref> The film was released on June 12, 2009. It grossed $150 million against a production budget of about $100 million and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nA man calling himself Ryder and his accomplices \u2013 Bashkin, Emri, and former train operator Phil Ramos \u2013 hijack Pelham 123, a [[New York City Subway]] [[6 (New York City Subway service)|6 train]], at [[77th Street station (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|77th Street]]. Uncoupling the front car of the train below [[Lexington Avenue/51st Street station|51st Street]], they take the passengers hostage. [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] employee Walter Garber, working the Rail Control Center as a train dispatcher, receives a call from Ryder, demanding $10 million in cash to be paid within 60 minutes. Ryder warns that every minute he waits past the deadline, he will kill a hostage.\n\nBashkin kills a suspicious [[New York City Transit Police]] officer, and all the passengers not in the front car, except the motorman, are released. Garber reluctantly negotiates with Ryder as Ramos and Emri set up Internet access in the tunnel. On his laptop, Ryder watches the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] plunge nearly 1,000 points in response to the hijacking. A hostage's laptop also connects to the Internet, and its [[webcam]] allows the control center to observe Ryder and Ramos. Lieutenant Camonetti of the [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit]] takes over negotiations, which infuriates Ryder, who kills the train's motorman to force Camonetti to bring Garber back.\n\nCamonetti learns that Garber is being investigated for allegedly accepting a $35,000 bribe over a contract for new Japanese subway cars. Ryder also discovers the allegations online and forces Garber to confess by threatening to kill a passenger. To save the hostage, Garber claims that he was offered the bribe while deciding between two companies, using the money to pay for his child's college tuition, and insists he would have made the same decision regardless. The mayor agrees to Ryder's ransom, ordering the police to deliver it. En route, the police car is involved in an accident and fails to deliver the money in time. Garber attempts to bluff Ryder that the ransom has arrived, unaware he has been monitoring events on his laptop. Ryder threatens to execute a child's mother, but another hostage, a former soldier, sacrifices himself and is killed. A brief gunfight erupts after an Emergency Services Unit sniper is bitten by a rat and discharges his weapon, killing Ramos.\n\nBased on clues from Garber's conversations, the police discover that Ryder is Dennis Ford, a manager at a private equity firm who was sentenced to prison for [[securities fraud|investment fraud]]. Ford had agreed to a plea bargain to serve three years, but received ten years instead. One of the mayor's aides mentions the extreme drop in the major stock indexes, and the mayor deduces that Ryder is attempting to manipulate the market via [[put option]]s. Ryder demands that Garber deliver the ransom money himself to avoid coming in contact with the police. Garber is flown to the terminal, where he is given a pistol for protection. Ryder brings Garber aboard and orders him to operate the train down the tunnel below [[33rd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line station)|33rd Street]], where Garber and the hijackers exit, rigging the train to go on without them. Garber manages to separate himself at a railway crossing and then follows Ryder to [[Track 61 (New York City)|Track 61]] underneath [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria hotel]]. Ryder parts from Bashkin and Emri, who are shot dead after being surrounded by police and provoking [[deadly force]] in an apparent [[suicide-by-cop]]. The train comes to a screeching halt safely just before [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue station|Coney Island]] ([[West Eighth Street\u2013New York Aquarium station|West 8th Street-New York Aquarium]]), and the police discover that Ryder is no longer on board.\n\nRyder hails a taxi, with Garber following him on-foot, and finds out that his scheme has amassed $307 million. Garber steals a car and pursues Ryder. After a brief chase, they reach the [[Manhattan Bridge]]'s pedestrian walkway, where Garber catches up with Ryder and holds him at gunpoint. Ryder gives him a 10-second ultimatum to pull the trigger, and in the final seconds, pulls out his own gun and forces Garber to shoot him. Telling Garber in his final breath, \"You're my goddamn hero\", Ryder collapses and dies (as Garber solemnly looks on while Camonetti observes approvingly from a chopper).\n\nThe mayor thanks Garber and assures him the city will \"go to bat\" for him over his bribery admission. The film concludes as Garber returns home to his wife with groceries he had promised to pick up.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Denzel Washington]] as Walter Garber, an [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] subway dispatcher, who is negotiating with the hijackers.

In December 2007, [[David Koepp]], who adapted the novel for Scott and Washington said:<ref name=\"mtvblog\">{{cite news|first=Shawn|last=Adler|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/12/27/taking-of-pelham-not-as-easy-as-123-says-screenwriter/|title ='Taking Of Pelham' Not As Easy As '123,' Says Screenwriter|work=MTV Movies Blog|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=December 27, 2007|access-date=July 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I wrote many drafts to try and put it in the present day and keep all the great execution that was there from the first one. It\u2019s thirty years later so you have to take certain things into account. Hopefully we came up with a clever way to move it to the present.</blockquote>\n\nKoepp's drafts were meant to be \"essentially familiar\" to those who read the novel, preserving the \"great hero vs. villain thing\" of the original.<ref name=\"mtvblog\" /> Brian Helgeland, the only one who received credit for the screenplay, took the script in a different direction, making the remake more like the 1974 film than the novel and, as Helgeland put it, making it about \"two guys who weren't necessarily all that different from each other\".<ref name=\"sfgate\">{{cite news |last=Ordo\u00f1a |first=Michael|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/06/05/PKGJ17TOMJ.DTL|title='Taking of Pelham 123' stars Travolta, Denzel|newspaper= San Francisco Chronicle |date= June 7, 2009|access-date= June 8, 2009}}</ref> As writer Michael Ordo\u00f1a describes it:<ref name=\"sfgate\" />\n\n<blockquote>Whereas the novel is told from more than 30 perspectives \u2014 keeping readers off balance because it is unknown which characters the writer might suddenly discard \u2014 the two films focus on the lead hijacker and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee with whom he communicates by phone. The new version sharpens that focus until it's almost exclusively a duel between disgraced MTA dispatcher Walter Garber and manic gunman Ryder.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the book and original film, Ryder is \"cold-blooded and calculating\", but in the 2009 film, he is a \"loose cannon willing to kill innocents not out of necessity but out of spite\".<ref name=\"sfgate\" /> Also, Ryder in the original film and book is portrayed as a normal-looking businessman, while in the 2009 film, he looks as if he has adopted prison life, sporting very visible prison tattoos, and the laid-back style of a biker.\n\nIn the 1974 film, the main character (played by [[Walter Matthau]]) is named Zachary Garber and is a lieutenant in the transit police; in the 2009 film, the main character (played by [[Denzel Washington]]) is named Walter Garber and works as a subway train dispatcher.\n\nRyder also demands $10 million instead of $1 million as in the original film and book or $5 million in the made-for-TV film. Ryder does not use the \"Mr. Blue\" nickname as in the original film. Instead, Ryder is a nickname adopted by Dennis Ford.\n\nIn the 1974 film, the train-operating hostage-taker is the only member of the group to live long enough to see himself behind bars, while all of the hostage-takers die in the 2009 film.\n\n==Production==\nProduction began in March 2008 with all cast and crew being required to attend a track safety course taught by [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] personnel, as much of the filming would take place in the subway on active tracks.<ref>{{cite journal |first1= Leslie |last1= Simmons |last2= Nordyke |first2 = Kimberly|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i8549911074ed04d4737b9c5860a5136b |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910171050/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i8549911074ed04d4737b9c5860a5136b |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |title= Escape Artists ramp up for pics, Sony deal |journal= The Hollywood Reporter |publisher= Nielsen Company |date=January 15, 2008|access-date=March 7, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Randy|last=Kennedy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/movies/03kenn.html|title='Manhattan Transfer: Remaking 'Pelham'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 1, 2009|access-date=June 4, 2009}}</ref> For the initial hijack sequence at [[Grand Central (IRT Flushing Line)|Grand Central]] on the [[IRT Flushing Line|Flushing Line]], the crew used the westbound track during late night hours while regular [[7 (New York City Subway service)|7 train]] service operated in both directions on the eastbound track.
