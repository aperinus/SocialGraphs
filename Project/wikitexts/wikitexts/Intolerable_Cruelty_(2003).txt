The script was written by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone and Ethan and Joel Coen, with the latter writing the last draft of the screenplay. The film stars [[George Clooney]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Edward Herrmann]], [[Paul Adelstein]], [[Richard Jenkins]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]]. It premiered at the [[60th Venice International Film Festival]] and was released in the United States on October 10, 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nDonovan Donaly, a TV [[soap opera]] producer, walks in on his wife Bonnie being intimate with an ex-boyfriend. He files for divorce, and Bonnie hires Miles Massey, a top divorce attorney and the inventor of the \"Massey pre-nup\", a completely foolproof [[prenuptial agreement]]. Miles wins a large property settlement against Donaly, leaving him broke.\n\n[[Private investigator]] Gus Petch tails the wealthy and married Rex Rexroth on a drunken night out with a blonde. When they stop at a motel, Gus catches their tryst on video. He takes the video to Rex's wife, Marylin Rexroth, a marriage-for-money predator. She files for divorce, demanding a large property settlement. Unable to afford a divorce settlement, Rex hires Miles to represent him. Marylin's friend, serial divorc\u00e9e Sarah Sorkin warns Marilyn that Miles will be a dangerous opponent.\n\nMarylin and her lawyer, Freddy Bender fail to reach an agreement with Miles and Rex. Bored Miles asks the fascinating Marylin to dinner, where they flirt. While they are out, Petch breaks in and copies her address book for Miles, who has his assistant search among the names for Marylin's accomplice in predatory marriage. In court, Marylin feigns an emotional breakdown over Rex's infidelity, professing that she loved Rex unconditionally at first sight. Miles then calls \"Puffy\" Krauss von Espy, a Swiss hotel concierge located by his assistant. Puffy testifies that Marylin asked him to find her a marriage target who was very rich, foolish, and a philanderer whom she could easily divorce, and that he pointed her to Rex. The divorce is granted, but Marylin gets nothing.\n\nSeeking revenge against Miles, Marylin finds the now-penniless Donaly living on the street, still clutching his [[Emmy award|Emmy]] statuette, and offers him a chance to reclaim his lost glory. Soon after, Marylin shows up at Miles' office with her new fianc\u00e9, oil millionaire Howard D. Doyle. Marylin insists on the Massey prenup, which will make it absolutely impossible for her to claim any of her fianc\u00e9e's assets in the event of a divorce, over both Howard and Miles's objections. However, Howard destroys it during the wedding, as a demonstration of love.\n\nSix months later, Miles goes to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] to give the keynote address at a convention for divorce attorneys. He encounters Marylin, who has divorced Howard and presumably collected a sizable share of the Doyle Oil fortune. However, she admits that she is disenchanted with her wealthy but lonely life. Miles marries her on the spur of the moment, and signs the Massey prenup to prove that he has no interest in her fortune, but she tears it up. The next morning, Miles tells the convention that love is the most important thing, and that he is giving up divorce for ''[[pro bono]]'' work.\n\nShortly afterwards, Miles discovers that \"Howard D. Doyle\" is just an actor from one of Donaly's soap operas; Marylin tricked him, leaving ''his'' considerable wealth at risk. Desperate to save the firm's reputation, Miles' boss, Herb Myerson suggests hiring hitman \"Wheezy Joe\" to kill Marylin. Miles then learns that Marylin's ex-husband Rex has died without changing his will, leaving her his entire fortune. Since she is now the wealthier of the two parties, his assets are no longer at risk. A repentant Miles rushes to save Marylin from Joe, but Marilyn has already offered to pay him double to kill Miles instead. In the confusion of the ensuing struggle, Joe mistakes his gun for his [[asthma]] inhaler and accidentally kills himself.\n\nLater, Miles, Marylin and their lawyers meet to negotiate a divorce. Miles pleads for a second chance and retroactively signs a Massey prenup. Realizing her own feelings for him, she tears it up, and they kiss. Marylin reveals that to get Donaly's help for supplying Howard, she gave him an idea for a hit TV show, restoring his fortunes in the process: ''America's Funniest Divorce Videos'', with Gus as the host.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[George Clooney]] as Miles Massey\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Marylin Hamilton Rexroth Doyle Massey\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Donovan Donaly\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Gus Petch\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] as Rex Rexroth\n* [[Paul Adelstein]] as Wrigley\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Freddy Bender\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Howard D.
