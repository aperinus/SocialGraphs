It is a sequel to the 1961 film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]''. The parts of Mallory and Miller are played by [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] (who died before the film was released), and [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]], succeeding in the roles originally portrayed by [[Gregory Peck]] and [[David Niven]]. It was directed by [[Guy Hamilton]] and also stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Carl Weathers]], [[Barbara Bach]], [[Franco Nero]] (in a \"plastic surgery\" role previously played by [[Tutte Lemkow]]), and [[Richard Kiel]].\n\nThe film gets its title from the Alistair MacLean [[Force 10 from Navarone|book of the same name]], but bears little resemblance to the narrative of the novel. The differences are so apparent that MacLean would go on to loosely adapt part of the screenplay into his 1982 book ''[[Partisans (novel)|Partisans]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1943, Major Keith Mallory and Sergeant Donovan \"Dusty\" Miller from [[British Commandos]] are sent to find and eliminate Nicolai, a German spy who previously betrayed the Navarone mission to the Germans and is now believed to have successfully infiltrated the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] as \"Captain Lescovar\". To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \"Force 10\", an American [[sabotage]] unit led by [[US Army Rangers]] Lieutenant Colonel Mike Barnsby and steal a [[Lancaster bomber|bomber]]. They are joined by Weaver, a [[US Army Medical Corps|Medical Corps]] [[sergeant]] arrested by the [[Military Police]], and escape, only to be shot down by the [[Luftwaffe]]. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Lieutenant Doug Reynolds ([[Angus MacInnes]]) escape the crippled plane.\n\nThe survivors come upon a band of men they believe to be partisans but are later revealed as [[collaborationist]] [[Chetniks]] led by Captain Drazak. Taken prisoner, they tell the German commander in control of the area, Major Schroeder, that they are deserters. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's explosives suitcase, Mallory claims it contains the new drug \"[[penicillin]]\" which will spoil if exposed. The next morning the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. They improvise an excuse, \"admitting\" they buried the samples. Schroeder sends Barnsby and Mallory to retrieve them under the guard of his [[concubine]] Maritza and three soldiers. Miller, Weaver, and Reynolds are left in camp.\n\nFar from camp, Maritza kills the Germans, revealing herself to be a partisan and the person who hid the explosives. She directs Mallory and Barnsby towards the partisan camp under the command of her father, Major Petrovich. Mallory and Barnsby escape and meet a patrol of real Yugoslav partisans led by Lescovar, who has gained Petrovich's trust. Mallory and Barnsby are taken to the camp, which lies near a [[hydroelectric dam]]. An [[arch bridge]] spanning the river ravine is set to be used by a German force for an impending assault on the partisans, who have been unable to destroy the bridge. Barnsby reveals that the bridge is Force 10's target.\n\nMallory convinces Petrovich to mount a rescue mission of demolitions expert Miller, using Lescovar and Marko, a loyal partisan. The four re-enter the camp at night, with Mallory and Barnsby posing as captives, and Lescovar and Marko disguised as Chetniks. Drazak discovers that Maritza must have helped Miller and Mallory escape, and begins beating her viciously. Schroeder and Reynolds are killed in a gun battle, but the others escape with a badly beaten Maritza and the recovered explosives.\n\nMiller reveals that the bridge is impregnable, which Barnsby refuses to accept. Mallory hits upon the idea of destroying the upstream dam, to use the sudden onrush of millions of gallons of water to destroy the bridge. A night-time air drop is arranged to replace Force 10's lost supplies, but Lescovar, revealed to be the saboteur, calls in German planes to stop the drop. Maritza catches Lescovar in the act, but he kills her before she can warn the others, and German planes bomb the illuminated drop zone, killing numerous partisans.\n\nPetrovich, angered by the botched air drop, orders the men to be sent to [[Marshal Tito]]'s headquarters for transport back to Italy. Accompanied by Lescovar and Marko, the team instead infiltrates the German marshaling yards at [[Mostar]] to steal explosives. Lescovar again betrays them, alerting a German sergeant to their presence. Marko sacrifices himself to save the others, who escape with Lescovar aboard a train leaving for [[Sarajevo]]. Lescovar is questioned by the others, who have grown suspicious of him. Lescovar initially denies the accusations, but gives himself away and is shot dead by Barnsby, who then asks Mallory to return the favour by helping him accomplish Force 10's mission.\n\nJumping the train near the dam, the team splits up: Miller and Weaver run a diversion, while Mallory and Barnsby sneak into the dam. Weaver runs into Captain Drazak and kills him in a knife fight. Mallory and Barnsby set their charges within the dam; its structural integrity compromised by the blast, the [[Dam failure|dam wall bursts]], releasing a torrent of water that topples the bridge. The German assault is thwarted, saving Petrovich and the partisans.\n\nMallory and Barnsby rejoin Miller and Weaver, but Mallory reminds the others they are trapped on the wrong side of the river. As the credits roll, the men begin a strenuous journey back to friendly lines.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Major Keith Mallory\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Lieutenant Colonel Mike Barnsby\n* [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Staff Sergeant John Miller\n* [[Barbara Bach]] as Maritza Petrovi\u0107\n* [[Franco Nero]] as Captain Lescovar / Colonel Von Ingorslebon, a German [[Abwehr]] intelligence officer\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as Sergeant Olen Weaver\n* [[Richard Kiel]] as Captain Dra\u017eak\n* [[Alan Badel]] as Major Petrovi\u0107\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Major Schroeder\n* [[Philip Latham]] as Commander Jensen\n* [[Angus MacInnes]] as Lieutenant Doug Reynolds\n* [[Michael Sheard]] as Sergeant Bauer\n* Petar Buntic as Marko\n* Paul Humpoletz as Sergeant Bismark\n* Ramiz Pasic as Mallory's Boy\n\n==Production==\n===Initial Development===\nInitially there had been plans to produce the film shortly after the 1961 original with Gregory Peck and David Niven reprising their roles. Following the success of the original film, producer [[Carl Foreman]] asked MacLean to write a hardcover sequel novel on which a follow-up film would be based, but the author was reluctant to write an entire novel and instead delivered a screen treatment.\n\nIn April 1967 Carl Foreman announced he would make ''After Navarone'' with [[Anthony Quinn]], Gregory Peck and David Niven reprising their roles and [[J Lee Thompson]] returning as director. The film would be made by Columbia.<ref>Second 'Navarone' Film Set\nMartin, Betty.

The novel became a best seller.<ref>Best Sellers 1969\nNew York Times 28 Dec 1969: BR23.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s Foreman tried to get financial backing for the film.

Columbia Pictures advanced $2,900,000 and agreed to pay $1,100,000 more after delivery of the film in return for the exclusive and perpetual distribution rights in all territories outside the United States and Canada.
