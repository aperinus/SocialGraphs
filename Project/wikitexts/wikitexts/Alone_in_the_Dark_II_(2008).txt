Shaffer wrote: \"[[Uwe Boll]]'s ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'' did not require a sequel. Critics hated the film. Fans hated the film. ... Thankfully though, ''Alone in the Dark II'' is actually a much better film than the first. It's a touch light on action, and the setting is far more limited in terms of production design, but the tone is a little more in keeping with the ideas of the game franchise. ... Look at ''Alone in the Dark II'' more as a reboot than a sequel and it plays OK\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/25/alone-in-the-dark-ii-dvd-review|title=Alone in the Dark II DVD Review|first=R.
