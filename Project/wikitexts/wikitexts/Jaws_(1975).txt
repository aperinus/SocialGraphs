It stars [[Roy Scheider]] as police chief Martin Brody, who, with the help of a marine biologist ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]), hunts a man-eating [[great white shark]] that attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town. [[Murray Hamilton]] plays the mayor, and [[Lorraine Gary]] portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer [[Carl Gottlieb]], who rewrote the script during [[principal photography]].\n\nShot mostly on location on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]], ''Jaws'' was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, and consequently had a troubled production with issues such as going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided mostly to suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer [[John Williams]] to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]' release of the film to over 450 screens was an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture at the time, and it was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that heavily emphasized television spots and tie-in merchandise.\n\nRegarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, ''Jaws'' was the prototypical summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], and won several awards for its music and editing. It was the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]] until the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' two years later; both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple [[High concept|high-concept]] premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and advertised heavily. ''Jaws'' was followed by [[Jaws (franchise)|three sequels]] (none of which involved Spielberg or Benchley) and many imitative thrillers, and in 2001, the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries, usually for popular films, are set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn the [[New England]] beach town of Amity Island, an attractive blonde young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes [[skinny dipping]] in the ocean one evening during a beachside party. While she is treading water, an unseen force attacks her and pulls her under the water. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. After the medical examiner concludes she was the victim of a shark attack, police chief Martin Brody decides to close the beaches, but Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner tentatively concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident, and Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until the shark kills a young boy, Alex Kintner, in front of a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy, and eccentric and roughened local professional shark fisherman Sam Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, confirming that an unusually large shark killed her.\n\nWhen local fishermen catch a [[tiger shark]], the mayor proclaims that the beach is safe. Mrs. Kintner, Alex's mother, confronts Brody and blames him for her son's death. Hooper doubts that the tiger shark caused the attacks, and his suspicions are confirmed when no human remains are found inside its stomach after dissection. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper removes a sizable great white shark's tooth from the boat's hull, but fearfully drops it after discovering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a huge [[great white shark]] caused the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank with a fake shark, the real shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to immediately hire Quint.\n\nDespite instant tension between Quint and Hooper, they set out with Brody on Quint's boat, the ''Orca'', to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a [[Chumming|chum]] line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. When the shark suddenly appears behind the boat, Quint, estimating that it is {{convert|25|ft|m}} long and weighs {{convert|3|t}}, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but it pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\n\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the attack on the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he overtaxes the damaged engine and it fails.\n\nAs the ''Orca'' slowly sinks, the trio attempts a riskier approach. Hooper enters the water in a [[shark-proof cage]], intending to lethally inject the shark with [[strychnine]] via a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark breaks free and leaps onto the boat, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth and climbs onto the crow's nest. He shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, killing the shark with the resulting explosion. Hooper resurfaces and paddles back to Amity Island with Brody, clinging to the remaining barrels.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], producers at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], independently heard about Peter Benchley's novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]''. Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', then edited by his wife, [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment \"might make a good movie\".<ref name=\"Prigg\u00e96\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=6}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scanlon|2009|p=197}}</ref> The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was \"the most exciting thing that they had ever read\" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished.<ref name=jawschap1>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|type=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans-title=\"From Novel to Script\"}}</ref> They purchased the film rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 ({{Inflation|US|175000|1973|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"Brode 50\">{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=50}}</ref> Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.<ref name=\"McBride 231\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=231}}</ref>\n\nTo direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker [[John Sturges]]\u2014whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included another maritime adventure, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]''\u2014before offering the job to [[Dick Richards]], whose directorial debut, ''[[The Culpepper Cattle Co.]]'', had come out the previous year.<ref name=\"McBride232\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=232}}</ref> They soon grew irritated by Richards's habit of describing the shark as a whale and dropped him from the project.<ref name=\"McBride232\"/> Meanwhile, [[Steven Spielberg]] very much wanted the job.

At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated.<ref name=\"Brode 50\"/> He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' in that both deal with \"these leviathans targeting [[everyman|everymen]]\".<ref name=jawschap1/> He also revealed in \"The Making of ''Jaws''\" documentary on the 2012 DVD release that he directly referenced ''Duel'' by repurposing the sound of the truck being destroyed as the death roar of the shark. After Richards's departure, the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June 1973, before the release of ''The Sugarland Express''.<ref name=\"McBride232\"/>\n\nBefore production began, Spielberg grew reluctant to continue with ''Jaws'', in fear of becoming typecast as the \"truck and shark director\".<ref name=biskind264/> He wanted to move over to [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Lucky Lady]]'' instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure.<ref name=\"McBride240\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=240}}</ref> Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project, saying that \"after [''Jaws''], you can make all the films you want\".<ref name=biskind264/> The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5&nbsp;million and a shooting schedule of 55&nbsp;days.

The character of Quint strongly resembles [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]], the obsessed captain of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' who devotes his life to hunting a [[sperm whale]]. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after the only [[killer whale|natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Lemkin|1984|pp=277\u2013289}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick'']]; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from the film's star, [[Gregory Peck]], its copyright holder.<ref name=jawschap1/> Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'': \"''Jaws'' is&nbsp;... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"<ref name=baer209>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|page=209}}</ref>\n\nThe underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=99}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=129}}</ref> Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\";<ref name=biskind290>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=290}}</ref> and ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]'', where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\".

When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play\".<ref name=\"Sinyard32\"/>\n\n===Scholarly criticism===\n''Jaws'' has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent [[Watergate scandal]]. He argues that Brody represents the \"white male middle class\u2014[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film\", who restores public order \"with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=510}}</ref> Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine ''Jaws'' as a signal example of the film as \"industrial product\" that sells on the basis of \"the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of ''Jaws'' is to be the most profitable movie)\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=514}}</ref>\n\nAndrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it \"a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence.\" He suggests that the experience of the film is \"inconceivable\" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=237}}</ref> In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that \"individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change\".<ref name=Britton239>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=239}}</ref> [[Peter Biskind]] argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by [[New Hollywood]] filmmakers of the era\u2014involving Us vs. Them, hip counterculture figures vs. \"[[The Man]]\"\u2014the overarching conflict in ''Jaws'' does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.<ref>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=279}}</ref>\n\nWhereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,<ref name=Britton239/> Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman's \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening&nbsp;... irrational and out of control\". Hooper, meanwhile, is \"associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency\"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Biskind |title=''Jaws'': Between the teeth |journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |pages=1\u201329 |year=1975 |url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC09folder/Jaws.html |issue=9 |access-date=February 6, 2021 |archive-date=May 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514191519/http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC09folder/Jaws.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Britton sees the film more as concerned with the \"vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them\", which in turn helps generate a \"pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=238}}</ref>\n\n[[Fredric Jameson]]'s analysis highlights the [[polysemy]] of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read\u2014from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very \"polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones&nbsp;... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=26\u201327}}</ref> He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, [[New Deal]] America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an \"allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations&nbsp;... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[Neal Gabler]] analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody).
