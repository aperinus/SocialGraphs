Produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and filmed in [[Technicolor]], it was directed by [[Mervyn LeRoy]] from a screenplay by [[S. N. Behrman]], [[Sonya Levien]], and [[John Lee Mahin]]. It is the fourth screen adaptation of Sienkiewicz's novel. The film stars [[Robert Taylor (American actor)|Robert Taylor]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Leo Genn]], and [[Peter Ustinov]], and features [[Patricia Laffan]], [[Finlay Currie]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Marina Berti]], [[Buddy Baer]], and [[Felix Aylmer]]. Future Italian stars [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Carlo Pedersoli|Bud Spencer]] appeared as uncredited extras. The score is by [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa]] and the cinematography by [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert Surtees]] and [[William V. Skall]].\n\nThe story, set between 64\u201368 AD, combines both historical and fictional events and characters, and compresses the key events of that period into the space of only a few weeks. Its main theme is the [[Roman Empire]]\u2019s conflict with [[Christianity]] and persecution of Christians in the final years of the [[Julio-Claudian]] line. Unlike his illustrious and powerful predecessor, Emperor [[Claudius]], Nero proved corrupt and destructive, and his actions eventually threatened to destroy Rome's previously peaceful social order. The title refers to an incident in the apocryphal [[Acts of Peter]].<ref>The words \"quo vadis\" as a question occur [https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/search.cfm?Criteria=%22quo+vadis%22&t=VUL five times] in the Latin Bible \u2013 in Genesis 16:8, Genesis 32:17, Judges 19:17, John 13:36, and John 16:5.</ref>\n\nThe film was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and it was such a huge box office success that it was credited with single-handedly rescuing MGM from the brink of bankruptcy. Peter Ustinov won the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Motion Picture]], and [[Robert Surtees (cinematographer)|Robert Surtees]] and [[William V. Skall]] won the award for Best Cinematography.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Plot ==\n[[File:Quo Vadis (1951) trailer 8.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Scene from ''Quo Vadis'']]\nMarcus Vinicius is a Roman military commander and the [[legatus|legate]] of the [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV Gemina]]. Returning from wars in Britain and Gaul, he falls in love with Lygia, a devout Christian; in spite of this, he continually tries to win her affections. Though she grew up as the foster daughter of [[Aulus Plautius]], a retired Roman general, Lygia is legally a [[Lygians|Lygian]] hostage of Rome in the old general's care. [[Petronius]], Marcus' uncle, persuades Nero to give her to his nephew as a reward for his services. Lygia resents this arrangement, but eventually falls in love with Marcus.\n\nMeanwhile, Nero's atrocities become increasingly outrageous and his behavior more irrational. After Nero [[Great Fire of Rome|burns Rome]] and blames the Christians, Marcus sets out to rescue Lygia and her family. Nero arrests them, along with all the other Christians, and condemns them to be slaughtered in his Circus; some are killed by lions. Petronius, Nero's most trusted advisor, warns him that the Christians will be celebrated as martyrs, but he cannot change the emperor's mind. Then, tired of Nero's insanity and suspecting that he may be about to turn on him, too, Petronius composes a letter to Nero expressing his derision for the emperor (which he previously had concealed to avoid being murdered by him) and commits suicide by severing an artery in his wrist. His slavegirl Eunice (who has fallen in love with him) elects to die with him, despite being freed. The Christian apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]] has also been arrested after returning to Rome in response to a sign from the Lord, and he marries Marcus and Lygia in the Circus prisons. Peter is later [[Cross of Saint Peter|crucified upside-down]], a form of execution conceived by Nero's Praetorian Guard as an expression of mockery.\n\n[[Poppaea]], Nero's wife, who lusts after Marcus, devises a diabolical revenge for his rejection of her. Lygia is tied to a stake in the Circus and a wild bull is released into the arena. Lygia's bodyguard Ursus must attempt to kill the bull with his bare hands to save Lygia from being gored to death. Marcus is taken to the emperor's box and forced to watch, to the outrage of his officers, who are among the spectators. Ursus is able to topple the bull, though, and break its neck. Massively impressed by Ursus's victory, the crowd exhorts Nero to spare the couple. He refuses to do so, even after four of his courtiers, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], architect [[Phaon (freedman)|Phaon]], poet [[Lucan]], and musician Terpnos [[Pollice verso|add their endorsement]] of the mob's demands. Marcus then breaks free of his bonds, leaps into the arena, and frees Lygia with the help of the loyal troops from his own legion. Marcus accuses Nero of burning Rome and announces that General [[Galba]] is at that moment marching on the city, intent on replacing Nero, and hails him [[Year of the Four Emperors|as new Emperor of Rome]].\n\nThe crowd revolts, now firmly believing that Nero, not the Christians, is responsible for the burning of Rome. Nero flees to his palace, where he strangles Poppaea, blaming her for inciting him to [[scapegoat]] the Christians. Then [[Claudia Acte|Acte]], Nero's discarded mistress who is still in love with him, appears and offers him a dagger to end his own life before the mob storming the palace kills him. Nero cannot do it, so Acte helps him to push the dagger into his chest, and he dies.\n\nMarcus, Lygia, and Ursus are now free, and they leave Rome for Marcus' estate in Sicily. By the roadside, Peter's [[Crozier|crook]], which he had left behind when he returned to Rome, has sprouted blossoms. A radiant light appears and a chorus intones, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life,\" words spoken by Jesus ([[Gospel of John|John]] 14:6, [[New Testament]]).\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Taylor (American actor)|Robert Taylor]] as Marcus Vinicius\n* [[Deborah Kerr]] as Lygia\n* [[Leo Genn]] as [[Petronius]]\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as [[Nero|Emperor Nero]]\n* [[Patricia Laffan]] as [[Poppaea Sabina]]\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as [[Saint Peter]]\n* [[Abraham Sofaer]] as [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]\n* [[Marina Berti]] as Eunice\n* [[Buddy Baer]] as Ursus\n* [[Felix Aylmer]] as [[Aulus Plautius|Plautius]]\n* [[Nora Swinburne]] as [[Pomponia Graecina|Pomponia]]\n* [[Ralph Truman]] as [[Tigellinus]]\n* [[Norman Wooland]] as [[Nerva]]\n* [[Peter Miles (American actor)|Peter Miles]] as Nazarius\n* Geoffrey Dunn as Terpnos\n* [[Nicholas Hannen (actor)|Nicholas Hannen]] as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]\n* [[D.

(At the same time they had to buy the 1924 silent screen version.) The company originally intended to make the film in Italy, but the outbreak of WWII caused it to be postponed. After the war, production was restarted. A lease was obtained on the huge [[Cinecitta]] Studios, eight miles outside Rome, with its 148 acres and nine soundstages.\n\nAfter months of preparation, the art director, costume designer, and set decorator arrived in Rome in 1948. Construction of the outdoor sets began at once: the huge [[Circus of Nero]] and exterior of Nero's palace, a whole section of Ancient Rome, a great bridge, and the Plautius villa. The manufacture of thousands of costumes for extras began, along with drapes and carpets, metal and glass goblets, and 10 chariots. Official permission was granted to refurbish a section of the [[Appian Way]]. One of Hollywood's foremost animal experts began to procure lions, horses, bulls, and other animals from around Europe. Well in advance of filming, the producer, director, chief cinematographer, and casting director arrived in Rome. The film finally went into production on Monday, May 22, 1950.<ref name=\"Bro\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Deborah Kerr 5.jpg|thumb|[[Deborah Kerr]] as Lygia]]\n[[File:Leo Genn.jpg|thumb|[[Leo Genn]] as Petronius]]\n[[File:Peter Ustinov 2.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Peter Ustinov]] as Nero]]\n[[File:Patricia Laffan.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Patricia Laffan]] as Sabina]]\n[[File:Marina Berti (Quo Vadis).jpg|thumb|200px|Publicity photo of [[Marina Berti]] as Eunice]]\nThe film was originally cast in 1949 with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] as Lygia and [[Gregory Peck]] as Marcus Vinicius. When the production changed hands the following year, the roles went to Deborah Kerr and Robert Taylor. Elizabeth Taylor had an uncredited cameo role as a Christian in the Circus prisons.\n\nAlthough most of the cast was British and a few Italian (Marina Berti, Alfredo Varelli, Roberto Ottaviano), Robert Taylor was certainly not the only American. Others included Buddy Baer (Ursus), Peter Miles (Nazarius), Arthur Walge (Croton), and William Tubbs (Anaxander). Also, several were among the uncredited cast; perhaps the most notable of these was 70-year-old Irish-American character actor [[Richard Garrick]] as the public slave who stands behind Marcus in his [[Roman triumph|Triumph]] chariot, holding a victory laurel above his head, and repeating \"Remember thou art only a man.\" Ustinov recalled how he was cast as Nero in 1949: \n\"An exciting proposition came my way when I was 28 years old. MGM were going to remake ''Quo Vadis'', and I was a candidate for the role of Nero. [[Arthur Hornblow Jr.|Arthur Hornblow]] [Jr] was to be the producer, and I was tested by [the director] [[John Huston]]. I threw everything I knew into this test, and to my surprise, John Huston did little to restrain me, encouraging me in confidential whispers to be even madder. Apparently the test was a success, but then the huge machine came to a halt, and the project was postponed for a year. At the end of the year, the producer was Sam Zimbalist and the director Mervyn LeRoy. They also approved my test, but warned me in a wire that I might be found to be a little young for the part. I cabled back that if they postponed again, I might be too old, since Nero died at 31. A second cable from them read 'Historical Research Has Proved You Correct Stop The Part Is Yours'.<ref name=\"Ust\">Peter Ustinov: ''Dear Me'' (William Heinmann \u2022 London \u2022 1977) pp217-244</ref>\n\n[[Clark Gable]] turned down the role of Marcus Vinicius very early in the film's production history because he thought he would look ridiculous in Roman costumes.\n\n[[Sophia Loren]] appeared in the film as an extra. Italian star Bud Spencer (real name: [[Carlo Pedersoli]]) also had an uncredited extra role as a Praetorian guardsman inside Nero's summer palace at Antium. (He answers Nero, but his voice may be dubbed.)\n\n[[Audrey Hepburn]], still widely unknown when the film was released, was considered for the part of Lygia. Director Mervyn LeRoy wanted to cast her,<ref name=\"LeRoy\">Mervyn LeRoy: ''Take One'' (W H Allen \u2022 London \u2022 1974)</ref> but the role went to established MGM contract star Deborah Kerr, instead. Wardrobe stills of her in costume for the film still exist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spoto|first1=Donald|title=Enchantment: The Life of Audrey Hepburn|date=2006|publisher=Hutchinson|isbn=978-0-09-179655-6|location=London|page=48}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Photo|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K1Mw9-Lf1ZA/T-8cUmf5GRI/AAAAAAAAFT8/F3X73lBHA1U/s1600/ah_qv1.jpg|website=2.bp.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\nPatricia Laffan was selected by the producer and director for the major role of Poppaea after they watched a screen test she made for a smaller part in the film.<ref>\"The Life Story of Patricia Laffan\" ''[[Picture Show (magazine)|Picture Show]]'' Vol63 No1832, July 10th, 1954 ([[Amalgamated Press]], London) p12</ref>\n\nAt 107 years of age (on 31 August 2021), Italian actor [[Alfredo Varelli]] (Lucan) may be the oldest surviving person associated with the film.<ref>https://westernsitaliana.blogspot.com/2014/08/happy-100th-birthday-alfredo-varelli.html{{Dead link|date=May 2020}}</ref>\n\nUstinov relates in his autobiography ''Dear Me'' that director Mervyn LeRoy summarized the manner in which he envisioned Ustinov should play the Emperor Nero, very salaciously, as\n\n<blockquote>Nero ... The way I see him ... He's a guy plays with himself nights.... At the time I thought it a preposterous assessment, but a little later I was not so sure. It was a profundity at its most workaday level, and it led me to the eventual conviction that no nation can make Roman pictures as well as the Americans ... The inevitable vulgarities of the script contributed as much to its authenticity as its rare felicities. I felt then as I feel today, in spite of the carping of critical voices, that ''Quo Vadis'', good or bad according to taste, was an extraordinarily authentic film, and the nonsense Nero was sometimes made to speak was very much like the nonsense Nero probably did speak.<ref name=\"Ust\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Filming ===\nProduced for $7 million, it was the most expensive film ever made at the time. It became MGM's largest grosser since ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939).  Filmed at the sprawling Cinecitta Studios that had been opened by [[Benito Mussolini]] in 1924 as part of the dictator's master plan to make Rome the pre-eminent world capital. (Mussolini and Hollywood producer [[Hal Roach]] later negotiated to form the R.A.M. [\"Roach and Mussolini\"] Corporation, which was ultimately aborted. This business alliance with the Fascist state horrified 1930s Hollywood moguls and ultimately led to Roach defecting from his MGM distribution deal to [[United Artists]] in 1937.)\n\nFilming in postwar Italy offered American studios immense facilities and cheap Italian labor and extras, of which thousands were required. Hollywood returned to Cinecitta often, producing many of its biggest spectacles there, including ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963) \u2013 the latter two dwarfing ''Quo Vadis'' in scale. The studio would later be used by many Italian producers and directors, including [[Federico Fellini]]. The first use of the phrase \"[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]\", which has come to refer to a golden era of American [[runaway film production]] in Italy, was as the title of a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''  article in the issue dated June 26, 1950, published while ''Quo Vadis'' was being shot in Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wrigley|first1=Richard|title=Cinematic Rome|date=2008|publisher=Troubador|isbn=978-1-906510-28-2|location=Leicester|page=52}}</ref>\n\nNumerous Italian locations \u2013 as many as 10 \u2013 were used in the film. With the exception of the [[Appian Way]],<ref name=\"Bro\" /> most of these have not been identified, but the final stage of the chariot chase was filmed along [[Bolgheri]]'s 2000-year-old ''Viale dei Cipressi'' (Avenue of Cypresses). This famous landmark in [[Province of Livorno|Livorno, Tuscany]], is easily recognizable.<ref>\"The cypress tree-lined road of Bolgheri\" on YouTube</ref>\n\nComposer Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa said that he wrote most of his score at the Culver City studios while the film was being shot in Italy:\n\n<blockquote>[The] rushes were being sent back to Hollywood for cutting at the same time as they were being cut back in Rome ... I set to work so that at least something was ready, even if it had to be modified later. I worked with the chief supervising editor, [[Margaret Booth]], whose technical knowledge is incomporable ... Finally, the Rome contingent arrived home with their version. It wasn't so very different from the one that Margaret had put together, and there were no insuperable problems. Sam Zimbalist was amazed and delighted that I had all the music ready in three weeks, thanks to the work Margaret and I had already done.<ref name=\"Roz\">Miklos Rozsa: ''Double Life'' (The Baton Press \u2022 Tunbridge Wells, UK \u2022 1982) pp144-155/p216.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the summer of 1950, when ''Quo Vadis'' was in production, Rome was in the grip of an intense heatwave, as Peter Ustinov recalled: \"Rome was in the throes of [[Holy Year]], and bursting with pilgrims. It was also one of the hottest summers on record.\"<ref name=\"Ust\" /> The heat affected not only the cast and crew, but also the lions. Mervyn LeRoy recalled that because of the heat, the lions were reluctant to enter the arena.<ref name=\"LeRoy\" /> Due to equipment shortages in Italy, MGM had to import a reported two hundred tons of generators, lights and other electrical equipment from [[Culver City]].<ref>Steinhart, Daniel.

Since no Ancient Roman music had survived, R\u00f3zsa incorporated a number of fragments of Ancient Greek and Jewish melodies such as the [[Seikilos epitaph]], the ''Hymn to Nemesis'' and ''Hymn to the Sun'' by [[Mesomedes]]<ref name=\"Vendries\">{{cite journal |last1=Vendries |first1=Christophe |title=La musique de la Rome antique dans le p\u00e9plum hollywoodien (1951-1963) |journal=M\u00e9langes de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome - Antiquit\u00e9 |date=29 April 2015 |issue=127\u20131 |doi=10.4000/mefra.2791 |url=https://journals.openedition.org/mefra/2791#tocto2n8 |access-date=19 July 2022 |language=fr |issn=0223-5102}}</ref> into his own choral-orchestral score.<ref name=\"Roz\" />\n* In 1950, before film production began, R\u00f3zsa made prerecordings of numerous fanfares, marches, songs and dances with the M-G-M Studio Orchestra in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], and these survive. In 1951, he recorded the full score at M-G-M's British studios with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], but these recordings were reportedly lost later on in a fire at the Culver City studios. However, 'dubdowns' of all of those recordings that were used in the film (about two-thirds with added sound effects) do survive. In 1951, [[MGM Records]] issued gramophone discs, in three different editions and speeds, of 12 tracks from the original soundtrack music (without sound effects). Consequently, much of the original recorded score is still available in various formats.<ref name=\"FSM\" /> In 2009, [[Film Score Monthly]] collected and issued these elements on two CDs.<ref>''Miklos Rozsa Treasury'' (Audio CD \u2022 FSM Box 4 \u2022 2009)</ref>\n* In 1963, MGM  Records brought out a stereo compilation of excerpts from R\u00f3zsa's film scores played by the Symphony Orchestra of Rome, conducted by R\u00f3zsa and [[Carlo Savina]].<ref>''Great Movie Themes composed by Miklos Rozsa'' (Vinyl LP \u2022 M-G-M E-SE-4112 \u2022 1963)</ref> Rozsa conducted the Triumphal March from ''Quo Vadis''.<ref name=\"Roz\" />\n* In 1967, R\u00f3zsa conducted the [[Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra]] in a stereo compilation of excerpts from his epic film scores.

This included several pieces of music that were originally recorded by R\u00f3zsa, but not used on the film's soundtrack.<ref>''Quo Vadis \u2013 Miklos Rozsa: world premiere recording of the complete film score'' (Audio CD \u2022 Prometheus Records \u2022 2012)</ref>\n\nAt the end of the film, a triumphal march heralds the success of the armies of the new emperor, [[Galba]]. This theme would be reused by R\u00f3zsa in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959) as the brief \"Bread and Circuses March\" preceding \"The Parade of the Charioteers\", prior to the famous [[Ben-Hur (1959 film)#Chariot race sequence|chariot race]].<ref>''Ben-Hur \u2013 Miklos Rozsa: original motion picture soundtrack'' (Audio CD \u2022 Sony Music \u2022 1996)</ref>\n\nIn his 1982 autobiography, Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa expressed his regret at the way his score was handled by producer Sam Zimbalist, 'a dear personal friend': \"[He] didn't use the music in any way as effectively as he might have done. After all the trouble I went to, much of my work was swamped by sound effects, or played at such a low level as to be indistinguishable ... It was a great disappointment to me.\" However, he was mistaken when he wrote: \"''Quo Vadis'', because it was produced abroad, was completely boycotted by Hollywood and received no Academy nominations.\"<ref name=\"Roz\" /> Although it did not win any Academy Awards, it did, in fact, receive eight nominations \u2013 including one for R\u00f3zsa's score.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-11|title=The 24th Academy Awards (1952)|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1952|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>\n\nR\u00f3zsa's love theme for Lygia (\"Lygia\") was set to words by Paul Francis Webster and [[Mario Lanza]] sang it for the first time on his radio show broadcast of January 1952.\n\n== Home media ==\n* A two-disc special edition of the movie was released on DVD in the U.S. on November 11, 2008, after a long photochemical restoration process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080721005147/en/Quo-Vadis-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Restored-Remastered |title=Quo Vadis Two-Disc Special Edition: Restored and Remastered Classic Finally Comes to DVD November 11 from WHV |publisher=Business Wire |date=2008-07-21 |access-date=2017-02-11}}</ref> A high-definition [[Blu-ray]] version was released March 17, 2009.<ref>{{Citation |last=LeRoy |first=Mervyn |title=Quo Vadis |url=https://www.amazon.com/Quo-Vadis-Blu-ray-Robert-Taylor/dp/B001ECQ6E2 |language=English |access-date=2022-03-09}}</ref>\n\n== Comic-book adaptation ==\n* ''Thriller Comics'' No 19, July 1952 ([[Amalgamated Press]], London) Full-color photo-cover [image reversed] \u2022 64 pages in black-and-white (Adapted by Joan Whitford \u2022 Drawn by [[Geoff Campion]]) [Remarkably faithful to the look of the film.
