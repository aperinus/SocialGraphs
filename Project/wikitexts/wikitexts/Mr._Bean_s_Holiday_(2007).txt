Based on the [[British sitcom]] series ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' created by [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Richard Curtis]], it is a [[Sequel|standalone sequel]] to [[Bean (film)|''Bean'']] (1997). The film stars Atkinson in the [[Mr. Bean (character)|title role]], with [[Maxim Baldry|Max Baldry]], [[Emma de Caunes]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Karel Roden]] in supporting roles. In the film, Mr. Bean wins a trip to [[Cannes]], [[France]], but on his way there, he is mistaken for both a kidnapper and an award-winning filmmaker when he travels with both a Russian filmmaker's son and an aspiring actress in tow.\n\nProduced by [[StudioCanal]], [[Working Title Films]] and [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Films]], the film was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2007 and in the United States on 24 August 2007 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, though it was generally considered to be an improvement over its predecessor. The film was also a commercial success, having grossed $232.2 million worldwide against a $25 million budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007)|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bean2.htm|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nOn a rainy day in [[London]], [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] wins a holiday trip to [[Cannes]], a [[video camera]], <!--the brand is irrelevant -->and [[Euro|\u20ac]]200 in a raffle.<!--IT'S A SUMMARY, NOT A COMPETITION TO SEE WHO CAN REMEMBER THE MOST DETAIL --> Upon arriving in France, Bean causes chaos while trying [[French cuisine|French]] [[seafood]] cuisine at [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|Le Train Bleu]] and asks Russian film director, Emil Duchevsky, to film him boarding his train using his video camera at the [[Gare de Lyon]]. However, the two keep doing retakes at Bean's request until the train leaves with Bean and Duchevsky's son, Stepan, onboard and Duchevsky left behind.\n\nBean and Stepan bond and get off together at the next station, where Duchevsky's train passes through the station without stopping; he holds up a sign with a mobile phone number written on it for Stepan to call, but due to inadvertently obscuring the last two digits, Bean unsuccessfully calls the number numerous times. Bean and Stepan board the next train stopping, but are ejected as Bean had accidentally left his wallet, passport and ticket on the telephone booth.\n\nTo earn money, Bean busks as a mime/singer and buys himself and Stepan food and bus tickets to Cannes. However, Bean's ticket gets caught in the wind and into the foot of a chicken, which is then packed into a truck that Bean chases via bicycle to a farm, where he is unable to retrieve his ticket due to the large number of chickens there. Deciding to continue his journey alone on foot, Bean wakes up on a quaint French village under attack from [[Wehrmacht|Nazi]] soldiers, which is revealed to be the set of a yogurt commercial directed by American filmmaker Carson Clay. Bean briefly stars in the commercial as one of the soldiers before being dismissed for showing his video camera in the advert, and accidentally causes the set to explode while recharging his camera.\n\nContinuing to hitchhike, Bean is picked up by a [[Mini]] identical to his own driven by aspiring actress Sabine, who is on her way to the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where her debut film directed by Carson, ''Playback Time'', is to be presented. The pair stop at a caf\u00e9, where Bean reunites with Stepan and Sabine decides to take him with them, believing Stepan to be Bean's son. The next morning, the trio arrive in Cannes thanks to Bean driving through the night after Sabine falls asleep.\n\nAt a petrol station, Sabine sees on the news that she and Bean are suspected of kidnapping Stepan. In a rush to ''Playback Time'''s premiere which is starting in merely an hour, she decides not to head to the police to clear the misunderstandings and instead has Bean and Stepan disguised as her mother and daughter to avoid detection at the festival. During the premiere, the audience initially showcases disinterest in the film, and Sabine discovers that her role has been cut, prompting Bean to plug his video camera into the projector and replace the film's visuals with his video diary. The camera's footage of Bean's shenanigans surprisingly align well with the film's narration, and Carson, Sabine and Bean all receive a standing ovation while Stepan is reunited with his parents.\n\nBean exits through the theatre's back door and finally arrives at the [[Promenade de la Croisette|Cannes beach]] as desired, where he, Sabine, Stepan and a group of other people mime a large musical finale to the song \"[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:RowanAtkinsonMar07.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rowan Atkinson]] at a premiere for the film in 2007]]\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]]\n* [[Emma de Caunes]] as Sabine\n* [[Maxim Baldry|Max Baldry]] as Stepan Duchevsky\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as Carson Clay\n* [[Jean Rochefort]] as the Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel\n* [[Karel Roden]] as Emil Duchevsky\n* [[Steve Pemberton]] as The Vicar\n* [[Catherine Hosmalin]] as Ticket Inspector\n* [[Urbain Cancelier]] as Bus Driver\n* [[St\u00e9phane Debac]] as Traffic Controller\n* [[Julie Ferrier]] as The First AD\n* Lily Atkinson as Lily\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2020}}\nPlans for a second ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' film were first revealed in February 2001, when [[Rowan Atkinson]] - who was filming ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' at the time - was lured into developing a [[sequel]] to ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]'' (1997), from a script written by ''Mr. Bean'' co-creator [[Richard Curtis]] that would have followed Mr. Bean heading to [[Australia]] under the [[working title]] ''Down Under Bean''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.com/news/item/2868/bean-down-under-for-rowan-atkinson.phtml|title=Bean Down Under For Rowan Atkinson|publisher=cinema.com|date=7 February 2001|access-date=19 December 2015}}</ref> No further announcements regarding the film were made until in early 2005.\n\nIn March 2005, the film was officially announced, then titled ''Bean 2'', with [[Simon McBurney]], co-founder and artistic director of the [[Complicit\u00e9|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Complicit\u00e9]] theatre company, writing the film's script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/rowan-atkinson-to-return-in-bean-2/|title=Rowan Atkinson to return in Bean 2|publisher=Movieweb.com|date=28 March 2005|access-date=3 April 2022}}</ref> In December of that year, Atkinson announced that he would script the film himself alongside Curtis, though the final screenplay was instead written by [[Robin Driscoll]] (a writer on the TV series) and [[Hamish McColl]], while McBurney wrote the film's story and served as one of the [[executive producer]]s on the film alongside Curtis.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[Principal photography]] for the film began on 15 May 2006 and took place on location across [[England]] and [[France]], particularly during the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shreya |first=Kumari |date=2022-06-02 |title=Where Was Mr. Bean\u2019s Holiday (2007) Filmed? |url=https://thecinemaholic.com/where-was-mr-beans-holiday-2007-filmed/ |access-date=2022-09-20 |website=The Cinemaholic |language=en-US}}</ref> At that point, the film's title was changed from ''Bean 2'' to ''French Bean'', and later to ''Mr. Bean's Holiday'', a reference to the 1953 French comedy film ''[[Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot|Monsieur Hulot's Holiday]]'', whose [[Monsieur Hulot|title character]] served as an inspiration to the character of Mr. Bean.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAtkinson reflected in 2022 that since he was neither an athlete nor a cyclist, he found the cycling sequence to be the most difficult thing he had ever done as Mr. Bean.<ref>{{cite web |last1=GQ |title=From Mr Bean to Blackadder, Rowan Atkinson breaks down his most iconic characters |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq2T1h6tgDY |website=YouTube |access-date=28 June 2022}}</ref>\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nThe film features twelve [[deleted scene]]s, all of which are included in the film's home media releases:\n* On the train, Bean accidentally spills some coffee on a laptop in front of two sleeping men. He cleans it up by wiping the keyboard with his hands, leaving just as one of the two men wakes up and blames the other for destroying his laptop. This scene was featured on trailers and TV spots for the film, while the European release of the film has it in place of the vending machine scene. \n* An extended version of Bean's walk across France where he sees Stepan for the first time looking out a car window.\n* Bean tricks a man to get a train ticket for himself and staying with Stepan on the train.\n* Bean carries Stepan on his back all the way through a French plaza. \n* Bean continues his journey on foot through a large field of sunflowers, which then transitions to the scene where he tries to hitchhike. In an extended version of that scene, he films himself doing silly moves in the middle of the road using his video camera (which is later shown in Carson Clay's ''Playback Time'' in the film's final cut).\n* Taking place before the scene where he gets picked up by Sabine, Bean performs [[shadow play]] on the road.\n* An extended version of Bean's car ride with Sabine where the latter leaves her Mini emotionally and almost gets run over by a truck after lying down on the road. \n* An extended version of the caf\u00e9 scene where Bean mimes his journey to Stepan prior to reuniting with him, which transitions to the scene where Sabine meets Stepan and the group dances at the cafe.\n* Taking place in the scene where Sabine stops at a petrol station to change for the premiere, Bean tricks a man into making the cost of his car's refueling higher, by immediately getting the fuel nozzle once the man places it back on the gas pumps (unbeknownst to the man) and plugging it into Sabine's Mini.\n* Taking place during the premiere of ''Playback Time'', Bean enters the projection room, where he falls asleep while sitting down to watch the film. He then leans on the rolling projector's wheel, causing it to stop and the film to stop rolling, get tangled up and cut, which causes Bean to wake up and try sticking the film back together. After initially succeeding in fixing the film, Bean then accidentally causes the projector to lower down. This is then followed by Carson discovering the film roll accumulating in the projection room and trying to fix the film and lower the projector back up. The damaged film is still seen lying next to the projector in the final cut, though it remains unexplained. \n* The original ending of the film had Bean dancing at the beach with a band, which was replaced by Bean, Sabine, Stepan and the rest of the film's characters singing \"[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]\".\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed and conducted by [[Howard Goodall]], who also composed the original ''Mr. Bean'' series, although the original ''Mr. Bean'' theme was unused. In contrast to the series' use of simple musical repetitions, the film uses a symphonic [[orchestra]]tion, which is a sophisticated score that features catchy [[leitmotif]]s for particular characters or scenes. The film's theme song was \"[[Crash (The Primitives song)#Matt Willis version|Crash]]\" by [[Matt Willis]].\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' served as the official film for [[Red Nose Day 2007]], with money made from the film going to the telethon's charity [[Comic Relief]]. Prior to the film's release, a new and exclusive Mr. Bean sketch titled  ''Mr. Bean's Wedding'' was broadcast on the telethon for Comic Relief on [[BBC One]] on 16 March 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW1tjCI4w7Efeature=youtu.be|title = Mr Bean's Wedding |website = [[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nThe official [[premiere]] of the film took place at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on Sunday, 25 March and helped to raise money for both Comic Relief and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital|Oxford Children's Hospital]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Universal Pictures released a [[Teaser campaign|teaser trailer]] for the film in November 2006 and launched an official website online the following month.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\n===Home media===\n''Mr. Bean's Holiday'' was released on both [[DVD]] and [[HD DVD]] on 27 November 2007.
