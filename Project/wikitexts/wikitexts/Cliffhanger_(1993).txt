Based on a concept by climber [[John Long (climber)|John Long]], the film follows Gabe (Stallone), a [[Mountaineering|mountain climber]] who becomes embroiled in a [[Robbery|heist]] of a U.S. Treasury plane flying through the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The film premiered at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]], and was released in the United States on May 28, 1993, by [[TriStar Pictures]]. It earned $255&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- See [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding plot.  Plots should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nRangers Gabriel \"Gabe\" Walker and Jessie Deighan are dispatched to rescue their friend Hal Tucker and his girlfriend, Sarah, after Hal suffered a knee injury and stranded them on a peak in the [[Southern Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rockies]]. As they try to rescue Sarah, part of her harness breaks. Although Gabe is initially able to grab her, her gloved hand slips out and she falls to her death. Hal blames Gabe for Sarah's death and Gabe is overcome with guilt, taking an extended leave.\n\nEight months later, Gabe returns to the ranger station to gather his remaining possessions and persuade Jessie to leave with him. While there, they receive a distress call from a group of stranded climbers. Hal goes to locate the climbers and Jessie is able to persuade Gabe to help out. Hal remains bitter towards Gabe over Sarah's death, at one point threatening to push Gabe off a ledge. When they find the climbers, they discover the distress call was a fake and are taken prisoner by a ruthless gang of international thieves led by psychotic former Military Intelligence operative Eric Qualen. The surviving thieves are the brutal Kynette, sadistic Delmar and pilot Kristel. Qualen, along with [[turncoat]] [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] agent Richard Travers, were able to steal three suitcases full of uncirculated bills valuing over $100&nbsp;million from a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 on a mid-air transfer to a Lockheed Jetstar. Their escape plan backfired when a supposedly dead FBI agent shoots and damages the hydraulics, sending their plane crashing into the mountain, and they now require Gabe and Hal's help to locate the cases with the help of [[emergency position-indicating rescue beacon|beacon locators]].\n\nAt gunpoint, Hal and Gabe lead them to the first case, located upwards on a steep rock face. Gabe is tethered and forced to climb up the face to reach the case, but when Qualen plans to have Gabe killed once he's got the case, Hal warns him not to come down. Before Delmar pulls him back and hold him at gunpoint, Qualen orders Kynette and one of the thieves try to yank him down, prompting Gabe to sever the rope. Qualen orders one of the thieves to open fire on Gabe, causing an avalanche that kills one of their members. When they see the money from the first case fluttering away, Qualen believes Gabe is dead, and orders Hal to lead them onward. Gabe races ahead to find Jessie at an abandoned cabin. They recover old mountaineering gear to reach the second case before Qualen does. By the time Qualen arrives, Gabe and Jessie have emptied the case and left only a single bill with the taunting message \"Want to trade?\" on it. Qualen orders his men to split up, allowing Gabe to impale Kynette on a stalactite in an underground cavern. Gabe attempts to call for help from Frank, their rescue helicopter pilot, on one of the mercenaries' radios, but Hal alerts him to explosives Qualen has rigged above them on the mountain. Gabe and Jessie escape the falling debris in time. Elsewhere, when Hal sees two friends, Evan and Brett, he warns them away before Qualen orders his men to open fire. Brett is killed while Evan is wounded, though he manages to ski off the mountain and parachute to safety. Night falls on the mountain and both groups take shelter. Frank, having not heard from Gabe or the others, scouts the mountain in the helicopter, spots Evan's parachute, and is able to get him to safety while contacting the authorities.\n\nWhen morning breaks, Gabe and Jessie beat Qualen to the last case. Meanwhile, the mercenaries flag down Frank in the helicopter, but by the time he realizes it's a trap it is too late and he is fatally shot by Delmar. While hugging Frank's body, Hal discreetly grabs Frank's knife. As the mercenaries split up to look for the other case, Hal is able to use the knife to stab Delmar, kill him with his own shotgun, and escape. Travers sees Gabe and gives chase. While on the surface of a frozen river, Travers observes Gabe under the ice and tries to kill him, but Gabe uses his bolt gun to shoot Travers and his lifeless body is carried away by the river current. However, at the same time, Qualen takes Jessie hostage when she waves down the helicopter, believing that Frank was flying it. Qualen tells Gabe and Hal over the radio that he is holding Jessie captive on board the helicopter, demanding Gabe and Hal to surrender the money from the third case at a high elevated rendezvous point and threatens to kill her should they refuse to cooperate.\n\nGabe and Hal agree, and they meet at a cliff side bridge. However, Qualen tries to challenge Gabe into throwing the case into the helicopter, but when he also threatens to kill Jessie again, Gabe orders Qualen to free her at a safe distance away from the cliff. Qualen reluctantly agrees, and uses a winch to lower Jessie to the ground. Once Jessie is safely down, however, Gabe throws the bag of money into the helicopter's rotors, shredding the money. Enraged, Qualen attempts to use the helicopter to kill Gabe, but Gabe has used the winch cable to tether the helicopter to a steel ladder up the cliff face. Hal arrives and helps via shooting the helicopter down. The ladder snaps and leaves Gabe and Qualen atop the wreckage of the helicopter hanging by the cable. Gabe fights Qualen and manages to climb to safety as the wreckage snaps off the cable and falls to the bottom of the mountain, killing Qualen. Gabe reunites with Jessie and Hal as they are found by Treasury agents led by Walter Wright in a helicopter.  Wright arranges to send a rescue helicopter as Gabe, Hal, and Jessie are seen sitting on top of a mountain peak, reminiscent of Gabe, Hal, and Sarah at the beginning.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Ranger Gabriel \"Gabe\" Walker, a former mountain climber and rescue ranger haunted by his failure to save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker\n* [[John Lithgow]] as Eric Qualen, a psychotic British former military intelligence officer, now leader of the gang of thieves trying to rob $100&nbsp;million from the U.S. Treasury\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Ranger Harold \"Hal\" Tucker, Gabe's best friend and a mountain ranger who blames Gabe for failing to save Sarah\n* [[Janine Turner]] as Ranger Jessica \"Jessie\" Deighan, a helicopter pilot and Gabe's girlfriend working in the same mountain search-and-rescue group and whom Gabe has become distant from since failing to save Sarah\n* [[Rex Linn]] as Richard Travers, a U.S. Treasury agent who is a double agent working for Qualen\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as Kristel, Qualen's pilot and companion\n* [[Leon Robinson]] as Kynette, Qualen's brutal second-in-command\n* [[Craig Fairbrass]] as Delmar, Qualen's sadistic ex-English football player-turned-henchman.\n* [[Gregory Scott Cummins]] as Ryan, Qualen's henchman\n* [[Denis Forest]] as Heldon, Qualen's henchman\n* Michelle Joyner as Sarah, Hal's ill-fated girlfriend who falls to her death after Gabe failed to save her\n* [[Paul Winfield]] as Walter Wright, A U.S. Treasury agent who discovered Qualen's plot to rob the money from the U.S. Treasury\n* [[Ralph Waite]] as Ranger Frank, a search-and-rescue pilot working for Gabe, Jessie and Hal\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Evan, a thrill-seeking young man who is friends with Gabe and Hal\n* Trey Brownell as Brett, Evan's friend who is also a thrill-seeker\n* [[Vyto Ruginis]] as Matheson, an undercover FBI agent who foils the mid-air robbery\n* [[John Finn]] as Agent Michaels\n* [[Bruce McGill]] as Treasury Agent\n* [[Jeff McCarthy]] as Pilot\n* [[Wolfgang G\u00fcllich]] as Gabe Walker (stunt double)\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and writing ===\n[[Carolco Pictures]] had originally signed [[Sylvester Stallone]] to appear opposite [[John Candy]] in a comedy about feuding neighbors titled ''[[John Hughes' unrealized projects|Bartholomew Vs. Neff]]'', which was going to be written and directed by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. When that project was dropped, Stallone became involved in two other Carolco projects. The first one was the futuristic science-fiction horror film ''Isobar'', which was about a genetically-created monster who breaks free on a high-speed runaway train. Between 1987, when Carolco first bought the original script by [[Jim Uhls]] for $400,000, and 1991, directors [[Ridley Scott]] and [[Roland Emmerich]] were each at different points in time attached to direct the film which would have had a $90&nbsp;million budget with Stallone and [[Kim Basinger]] playing the main roles. However, due to disagreements between them and Carolco and producer [[Joel Silver]] about the script changes and lack of artistic freedom, both Scott and Emmerich gave up on the project, which in the end was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-09-24-9003190988-story.html|title=Money talks State Senate President Phil Rock is...|website=Articles.chicagotribune.com|access-date=30 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/scifi?category=0&id=37195|title=SCI FI Wire - The News Service of the SCI FI Channel - SCIFI.COM|date=3 September 2007|access-date=30 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903164714/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=37195|archive-date=3 September 2007}}</ref><ref>The Greatest Sci-fi Movies Never Made by David Hughes</ref>\n\nThe second Carolco project in which Stallone was involved was an action disaster thriller entitled ''Gale Force'', described as \"''[[Die Hard]]'' in a hurricane\", which [[Renny Harlin]] was going to direct, and in which Stallone would play an ex-[[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] who has to fight against a group of modern pirates who attack a coastal town during a large, catastrophic hurricane. The first version of the script for the film was written by [[David Chappe]] in 1984, who then wrote six more drafts between 1987 and 1989, and after his final draft received some praise and following the bidding war between several studios for it in 1989, Carolco bought his final draft for $500,000, with a promise of an additional $200,000 if the movie were made. Harlin was paid $3&nbsp;million for directing the film, but because his contract also gave him full control of the project, he demanded many re-writes of the script to, amongst other things, increase the number of action sequences and make them bigger. Between 1990 and 1991 while they were working on the project, Carolco spent over $4&nbsp;million on all the different screenwriters and versions of the script. One of the screenwriters who worked on it, [[Joe Eszterhas]], was paid $500,000 to write his version. He re-wrote it as an erotic thriller, similar to his previous screenplays, so it was rejected.\n\nCarolco, believing the intended $40&nbsp;million budget would be too big, and unable to figure out how to make special effects for the film, cancelled that project two weeks before production was supposed to begin. But Harlin still kept his $3&nbsp;million, and he and Stallone and everyone else involved in it then moved on to ''Cliffhanger'', another Carolco project, which had a budget of $70&nbsp;million, almost double that of ''Gale Force''.<ref>{{cite news|title= Troubled Route to Pirate Epic 'Cutthroat'; Movies: As the swashbuckling adventure starring Geena Davis, directed by her husband, Renny Harlin, opens this weekend, financial woes surround its release.|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1995-12-21|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-12-21-ca-16222-story.html|access-date=2010-10-27|first=Judy|last=Brennan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-08-03-8901010972-story.html|title=How Deals Get Done Over A Hot Script|website=Article.latimes.com|access-date=30 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1991/10/04/sylvester-stallones-gale-force/|title=Sylvester Stallone's ''Gale Force''|date=4 October 1991|website=Ew.com|access-date=30 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-04-ca-273-story.html|title=Renny Harlin Finds Plenty of Action in Hollywood : Movies: With 'Die Hard 2' and 'Ford Fairlane' opening almost simultaneously, the Finnish director of adventure films is taking the industry by storm.|first=CHRIS|last=WILLMAN|date=4 July 1990|website=Articles.latimes.com|access-date=30 September 2017|via=LA Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/13/movies/at-the-movies.html|title=AT THE MOVIES|first=Lawrence Van|last=Gelder|date=13 July 1990|website=Nytimes.com|access-date=30 September 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|title=Total Free Fall|date=8 March 1992|website=Europe.newsweek.com|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nBefore production began, Stallone rewrote [[Michael France]]'s script.

For example, the bridge scene was shot on [[Monte Cristallo]] in the [[via ferrata]] [[VF Ivano Dibona]], which was reconstructed immediately after the movie. The climbing was mostly on the [[Tofane]] cliffs, and in some scenes toward the end of the movie the audience clearly sees the three [[Tofane]], the Croda da Lago, and the town of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo|Cortina]]; the location of this is on top of Mount [[Faloria]], at the arrival of the funivia Faloria. In other scenes are the sentiero ferrato Astaldi, over the Rifugio Dibona. The small house has been constructed on the sand of the river Boite, in Fiames, close to the heliport. Some filming took place in [[Durango, Colorado]]. The credits of the film also thank the [[Ute Tribe]] for filming in the [[Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation|Ute Mountain reservation]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Making a Movie Out of a Mountain : Climbers Give High Marks to 'Cliffhanger's' Realistic High-Altitude Action Sequences|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1993-06-02|url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-06-02-ca-42466-story.html|access-date=2010-11-08|first=Bill|last=Stall}}</ref>\n\n''Cliffhanger'' is in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for the costliest aerial stunt ever performed.
