The original version was narrated by [[David Attenborough]], whilst some international versions used alternative narrators.\n\nThe series has eleven episodes, each of which features a global overview of a different [[biome]] or [[habitat]] on [[Earth]]. At the end of each fifty-minute episode, a ten-minute featurette takes a behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of filming the series.\n\nTen years later, the BBC announced a six-part sequel had been commissioned, titled ''[[Planet Earth II]]'', the first television series produced by the BBC in [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra-high-definition]] ([[Ultra-high-definition television|4K]]). David Attenborough returned as narrator and presenter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/planet-earth-two|title=Sir David Attenborough to present brand new landmark natural history series for BBC One|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=22 February 2016|access-date=22 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/planet-earth-2-release-date-start-time-episodes-david-attenborough-bbc-one-a7401286.html|title=Everything you need to know about David Attenborough's Planet Earth 2|date=6 November 2016|work=The Independent|access-date=9 October 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> A second sequel, ''Planet Earth III'' is currently announced and planned to air in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Your first look|url=https://www.bbcearth.com/planet/|access-date=2021-02-04|website=BBC Earth|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 2001 the BBC broadcast ''[[The Blue Planet]]'', a series on the natural history of the world's oceans. It received critical acclaim, high viewing figures, audience appreciation ratings, and many awards. It also became a hugely profitable global brand, eventually being sold to 150 countries worldwide. Feedback showed that audiences particularly liked the epic scale, the scenes of new and unusual species and the cinematic quality of the series. Programme commissioners were keen for a follow-up, so [[Alastair Fothergill]] decided that the Natural History Unit should repeat the formula with a series looking at the whole planet. The idea for ''Planet Earth'' was born, and the series was commissioned by [[Lorraine Heggessey]], then Controller of BBC One, in January 2002.<ref name=\"DNL\">{{cite book |last=Nicholson-Lord |first=David |title=Planet Earth: The Making of an Epic Series |publisher=BBC Books |location= London| year=2006}}</ref>\n\nA [[feature film]] version of ''Planet Earth'' was commissioned alongside the television series, repeating the successful model established with ''The Blue Planet'' and its companion film, ''Deep Blue''. ''[[Earth (2007 film)|Earth]]'' was released around the world from 2007 to 2009. There was also another accompanying television series, ''[[Planet Earth: The Future]]'', which looked at the [[Environmentalism|environmental problems]] facing some of the [[species]] and habitats featured in the main series in more detail.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Broadcast==\n''Planet Earth'' premiered on BBC One on 5 March 2006 in the United Kingdom. On the same day or in the subsequent weeks or months, the series also began airing in several other countries.\n\nInternational broadcasters carrying Planet Earth include Australia on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[GEM (Australian TV Channel)|GEM]], Canada on [[CBC Television|CBC]] and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], New Zealand on [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime]], the Philippines on [[GMA Network]] and [[GMA News TV]], the U.S. on [[Discovery Channel]], [[Velocity (TV channel)|Velocity]], [[Science (TV network)|Science]], [[Animal Planet]], [[Destination America]] and [[BBC America]].\n\n===British television===\nThe episodes are each an hour in length, comprising the main programme and a 10-minute featurette called ''Planet Earth Diaries'', which details the filming of a particular event. In the UK, ''Planet Earth'' was split into two parts, broadcast in spring and autumn 2006. The first five episodes premiered on [[BBC One]] at 9:00&nbsp;pm on Sundays, beginning on 5 March 2006. The programmes were repeated the following Saturday in an early evening slot on [[BBC Two]]. Along with its 2005 dramatisation of ''[[Bleak House]]'', the [[BBC]] selected ''Planet Earth'' for its trial of [[high-definition television|high-definition]] broadcasts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4753607.stm |title=BBC steps up high-definition plan|work=[[BBC News]] |date=9 May 2006|access-date=13 March 2007}}</ref> The opening episode was its first-ever scheduled programme in the format, shown 27 May 2006 on the [[BBC HD]] channel.\n\nThe first episode in the autumn series, ''[[Great Plains]]'', received its first public showing at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] on 26 August 2006. It was shown on a giant screen in Conference Square.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/edinburghinternationaltelevisionfestival/A-vote-for-Independence.2805140.jp |title=A vote for Independence |author=Edwards, Gareth |newspaper=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=25 August 2006}}</ref> The remaining episodes were broadcast from 5 November 2006 in the same primetime [[BBC One]] slot, following a further repeat run of the spring programmes on [[BBC Four]]. The autumn episodes were broadcast simultaneously on [[BBC HD]] and were repeated on [[BBC Four]] the following week.\n\nBesides being [[BBC One]]'s featured ''One to Watch'' programme of the day, ''Planet Earth'' was heavily trailed on the BBC's television and radio channels both before and during its run. The music that was featured in the [[BBC]] trailers for the series is the track \"[[Hopp\u00edpolla]]\" from the album ''[[Takk...]]'' by [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] [[post-rock]] band [[Sigur R\u00f3s]]. Following the advertisements, interest was so widespread that the single was re-released.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nme.com/news/sigur-ros/22716 |title=Sigur R\u00f3s re-release single due to public demand |publisher=NME.com |date=6 April 2006}}</ref> In the United States, the series was promoted using \"The Time Has Come\" from [[trailer music]] company Epic Score,<ref>[http://www.epicscore.com/ Epic Score]</ref> composed by Gabriel Shadid and Tobias Marberger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/?cid=P&mid=29360 |title=''Planet Earth'' trailer |website=Soundtrack.net}}</ref> The [[Australia|Australian]] trailers initially used ''Jupiter: The Bringer of Jollity'' from [[Gustav Holst]]'s orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'', but later reverted to \"[[Hopp\u00edpolla]]\".\n\n===International===\nThe [[BBC]] pre-sold the series to several overseas broadcasters,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2005/04_april/planet_earth_presales.shtml |publisher=BBC press office |title=New Zealand and Scandinavian pre-sales for ''Planet Earth'' |date=11 April 2005}}</ref> including the [[Discovery Channel]] for the United States, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], [[China Central Television]], [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] for Germany, Discovery Channel for [[India]], [[Prime Television]] for New Zealand, and C1R for Russian broadcasts. The series was eventually sold to 130 countries.<ref name=\"radiotimes\">''[[Radio Times]]'': 4\u201310 November 2006</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 2007, the series began its run on American television on the [[Discovery Communications|Discovery]] network, premiering on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Discovery HD Theater]]. There were a number of revisions to the original British programme. Actress and conservationist [[Sigourney Weaver]] was brought in to replace [[David Attenborough]] as narrator, as it was thought her familiarity to American audiences would attract more viewers. The Discovery programmes also used a slightly different script to the British original. The series was broadcast on Sundays in one 3-hour block followed by four 2-hour blocks. The ''Planet Earth Diaries'' segments were not shown immediately after each episode, but collectively in ''Planet Earth: The Filmmakers' Story'', a two-hour special which was broadcast after the series had finished its initial network run. Edited versions were later broadcast on [[The Science Channel]], [[Animal Planet]], and [[Planet Green]].\n\nIn Canada, the series did not air on the Canadian Discovery Channel, as it is owned by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] rights were exclusively sold to the [[CBC Television|CBC]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/23/AR2007032301868.html|title=Tom Shales - Wonders Never Cease On 'Planet Earth'|last=Shales|first=Tom|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2007-03-24|access-date=2019-10-20|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n<!-- Please note that this article uses British spelling throughout: so \"instalment\" and not \"installment\", and \"programme\" rather than \"program\".

During [[Antarctica]]'s winter, [[emperor penguin]]s endure four months of darkness, with no food, in temperatures of {{convert|-70|C|F|lk=on}}. Meanwhile, as spring arrives in the [[Arctic]], [[polar bear]] cubs take their first steps into a world of rapidly thawing ice. In northern Canada, 3 million [[caribou]] complete an overland migration of {{convert|3200|km|mi}}, longer than that of any animal, and are hunted by wolves during their journey. The forests of eastern Russia are home to the [[Amur leopard]]; with a population of just 40 individuals in the wild, it is now the world's rarest cat. This is primarily because of the destruction of its habitat, and Attenborough states that it \"symbolizes the fragility of our natural heritage\". However, in the [[tropics]], the jungle that covers 3% of the planet's surface supports 50% of its species. Other species shown include [[New Guinea]]'s [[birds of paradise]], [[African wild dog|African hunting dogs]] in their efficient pursuit of [[impala]], [[African elephant|elephants]] in Africa migrating towards the waters of the [[Okavango Delta]], a seasonal bloom of life in the otherwise arid [[Kalahari Desert]], and 300,000 migrating [[Baikal teal]], containing the world's entire population of the species in one flock. The episode ends with Antarctica where the male Emperor penguins nurture their newly young chicks after four months of the Antarctic polar night.\nThe ''Planet Earth Diaries'' segment shows how the wild dog hunt was filmed unobtrusively with the aid of the ''[[Heligimbal]]'', a powerful, [[gyroscope|gyro]]-stabilised camera mounted beneath a [[helicopter]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=From Pole to Pole |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Mark Linfield |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-03-05}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Mountains\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|12|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 25 March 2007\n |Viewers         = 8.57\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Baltoro glacier from air.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Baltoro Glacier]] in the [[Karakoram]], Pakistan]]\nThe second instalment<!-- Note \"instalment\" is the correct British spelling. Please do not edit, thanks --> focuses on the [[mountain]]s. All the main ranges are explored with extensive [[aerial photography]]. [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Erta Ale]] is the [[Volcano#Active|longest continually erupting]] [[volcano]]\u2014for over 100 years. On the nearby highlands, [[gelada]]s (the only primate whose diet is almost entirely grass) inhabit precipitous slopes nearly five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) up, in troops that are 800-strong: the most numerous of their kind. Alongside them live the [[critically endangered species|critically endangered]] [[walia ibex]], and both species take turns to act as a lookout for predatory [[Ethiopian wolf|Ethiopian wolves]]. The [[Andes]] have the most volatile weather and [[guanaco]]s are shown enduring a flash blizzard, along with an exceptional group sighting of the normally solitary [[Cougar|puma]]. The [[Alps|Alpine]] summits are always [[snow]]-covered, apart from that of the [[Matterhorn]], which is too sheer to allow it to settle. [[Grizzly bear]] cubs emerge from their den for the first time in the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], while [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] inhabitants include [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] [[markhor]] and the rare [[snow leopard]]. At the eastern end of the range, the [[giant panda]] cannot hibernate due to its poor nutriment of [[bamboo]] and one of them cradles its week-old cub. Also shown is the Earth's biggest mountain [[glacier]]\u2014the [[Baltoro Glacier|Baltoro]] in [[Pakistan]], which is {{convert|70|km|mi}} long and visible from space. The episode ends with the flock of [[Demoiselle crane]]s flying across the Himalayan mountain peak to avoid the hostile air currents and predatory [[Golden eagle]]s that threaten their migration.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' explains how difficult it was to get close-up footage of [[snow leopards]]; it was a three-year process and is the world's first-ever video footage of snow leopards.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Mountains |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Vanessa Berlowitz |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-03-12}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Fresh Water\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|19|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 15 April 2007\n |Viewers         = 8.83\n |ShortSummary    = The [[freshwater|fresh water]] programme<!-- Note \"programme\" is the correct British spelling. Please do not edit, thanks --> describes the course taken by [[river]]s and some of the species that take advantage of such a habitat. Only 3% of the world's water is fresh, yet all life on land ultimately depends on it. Its journey begins as a stream in the mountains, illustrated by [[Venezuela]]'s [[Tepui]], where there is a tropical downpour almost every day. It then travels hundreds of kilometers before forming [[rapids]]. With the aid of some expansive helicopter photography, one sequence demonstrates the vastness of [[Angel Falls]], the world's highest free-flowing [[waterfall]]. Its waters drop unbroken for nearly 1,000&nbsp; meters (3,000&nbsp; feet) and are blown away as a mist before they reach the bottom. In Japan, the water is inhabited by the biggest amphibian, the two-meter long [[giant salamander]], while in the Northern Hemisphere, [[salmon]] undertake the largest freshwater migration, and are hunted en route by grizzly bears. The erosive nature of rivers is shown by the [[Grand Canyon]], created over five million years by the [[Colorado River]]. Also featured are [[smooth coated otter]]s repelling [[mugger crocodile]]s and the latter's [[Nile crocodile|Nile cousin]] ambushing [[wildebeest]] as they cross the [[Mara River]]. East African rift valley holds three of the world's largest lakes: [[lake Malawi|Malawi]], [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], and [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]]. Lake Malawi contains 850 different [[Cichlid]]s that originated from their same ancestors that were isolated thousands of years ago, along with nocturnal predatory dolphin fish. Deep in the dead zone of Malawi, swarms of fly midges emerge from larvae during the rainy season and began their process of mating. In lake Baikal of Eastern Siberia, [[Baikal seal]] and freshwater sponges thrive here despite the ice sheet that covers the lake. The [[Amazon river]], the biggest river in the world, flows from the Andes toward the Atlantic oceans carrying a billion tonnes of sediments. Its tributary,[[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], contains a mixture of sediments and saltwater where it supports [[Amazon river dolphin|boto]]s feeding habit. Between the border of Brazil and Argentina lies [[Iguassu Falls]], which is the widest waterfall ever known. In [[Pantanal]] wetlands, 300 species of fish breed here, including the [[Red-bellied piranha]]s and [[Salminus brasiliensis|Dorado]]s. Along with fish, [[Roseate spoonbill]]s are numerous in the [[Pantanal]] and are prey to [[spectacled caiman]] waiting for the chicks to fall from the tree. In [[Bangladesh]], the [[Ganges]] and [[Brahmaputra]] join together to form the world's [[Ganges delta|largest river delta]] and create the largest mangrove forest known as the [[Sundarban]]s. The mangroves of [[Indonesia]] provide a home to [[crab-eating macaque]]s for their aquatic lifestyle. The programme ends in North America where 400000 [[snow geese]] settle in the estuaries to rest and refuel on their long migrational journey.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' shows how a camera crew filmed a piranha feeding frenzy in [[Brazil]]\u2014after a two-week search for the opportunity.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Fresh Water |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Mark Brownlow |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-03-19}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Caves\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|3|26|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 22 April 2007\n |Viewers         = 8.98\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Lechuguilla Cave Pearlsian Gulf.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The [[Lechuguilla Cave]]]]\nThis episode explores \"Planet Earth's final frontier\": [[cave]]s. At a depth of 400 metres (1,300&nbsp; ft), Mexico's [[Cave of Swallows]] is Earth's deepest [[Pit Cave]] freefall drop, allowing entry by [[BASE jumper]]s. Its volume could contain [[New York City]]'s [[Empire State Building]]. In this episode divers explore the otherworldly [[cenotes]] of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], appearing to be flying in water (because it is so clear), allowing viewers a glimpse of the hundreds of kilometers of caves that have already been mapped. The [[Waitomo Caves]] with the ''[[Arachnocampa luminosa]]'' is also shown. Also featured is [[Borneo]]'s [[Deer Cave]] and [[Gomantong Cave]]. Inhabitants of the former include three million [[wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat]], which have deposited [[guano]] on to an enormous mound. In [[Gomantong Cave]], guano is many metres high and is blanketed with hundreds of thousands of [[cockroaches]] and other invertebrates. Also depicted are eyeless, subterranean creatures, such as the [[Texas blind salamander]] and (bizarrely) a species of [[crab]]. [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] is featured with its calcite formations. Mexico's [[Cueva de Villa Luz]] is also featured, with its flowing stream of [[sulphuric acid]] and [[snottite]] formations made of living bacteria. A fish species, the shortfin molly, has adapted to this habitat. The programme ends in [[New Mexico]]'s [[Lechuguilla Cave]] (discovered in 1986) where sulphuric acid has produced unusually ornate, [[gypsum]] crystal formations.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' reveals how a camera team spent a month among the cockroaches on the guano mound in Gomantong Cave and describes the logistics required to photograph Lechuguilla. Permission for the latter took two years and local authorities are unlikely to allow another visit.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Caves |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Huw Cordey |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-03-26}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Deserts\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|4|2|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 1 April 2007\n |Viewers         = 9.23\n |ShortSummary    = This instalment<!-- Note \"instalment\" is the correct British spelling.

Due to [[Siberia]]n winds, [[Mongolia]]'s [[Gobi Desert]] reaches extremes of temperature like no other, ranging from \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to +50&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F to 122&nbsp;\u00b0F). It is home to the rare [[Bactrian camel]], which eats snow to maintain its fluid level and must limit itself to {{convert|10|L|U.S.gal impgal}} a day if it is not to prove fatal. [[Africa]]'s [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]] is the size of the United States, and just one of its severe [[dust storm]]s could cover the whole of [[Great Britain]]. While some creatures, such as the [[dromedary]], take them in their stride, for others the only escape from such bombardments is to bury themselves in the sand. Few rocks can resist them either and the outcrops shown in [[Egypt]]'s [[Farafra, Egypt|White Desert]] are being inexorably eroded. The biggest dunes (300&nbsp;m or 1,000&nbsp;ft high) are found in [[Namibia]], while other deserts featured are [[Death Valley]] in [[California]] and [[Nevada]], the [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]] in [[Arizona]], the deserts of [[Utah]], all in the United States, the [[Atacama Desert|Atacama]] in [[Chile]], and areas of the Australian outback. Animals are shown searching for food and surviving in such an unforgiving habitat: [[African elephant]]s that walk up to {{convert|80|km|mi}} per day to find food; [[lion]]s (hunting [[oryx]]); [[red kangaroo]]s (which moisten their forelegs with saliva to keep cool); nocturnal [[fennec fox]]es, acrobatic [[flat lizard]]s feeding on [[black fly|black flies]], and duelling [[Nubian ibex]]. The final sequence illustrates one of nature's most fearsome spectacles: a billion-strong plague of [[desert locust]]s, destroying all vegetation in its path.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' explains how the hunt for the elusive Bactrian camels necessitated a two-month trek in Mongolia.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Deserts |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Huw Cordey |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-04-02}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = #00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Ice Worlds\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|11|5|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 1 April 2007\n |Viewers         = 6.37\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Polarlicht 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[aurora borealis]] in [[Alaska]]]]\nThe sixth programme<!-- Note \"programme\" is the correct British spelling. Please do not edit, thanks --> looks at the regions of the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. The latter contains 90% of the world's ice, and stays largely deserted until the spring, when visitors arrive to harvest its waters. [[Snow petrel]]s take their place on [[nunatak]]s and begin to court, but are preyed on by [[south polar skua]]s. During summer, a pod of [[humpback whale]]s hunt [[krill]] by creating a spiralling net of bubbles. The onset of winter sees the journey of [[emperor penguin]]s to their breeding grounds, {{convert|160|km|mi}} inland. Their eggs transferred to the males for safekeeping, the females return to the ocean while their partners huddle into large groups to endure the extreme cold. At the northern end of the planet, Arctic residents include [[musk ox]]en, who are hunted by [[Arctic fox]]es and [[Arctic wolf|wolves]]. A female [[polar bear]] and her two cubs head off across the ice to look for food. As the sun melts the ice, a glimpse of the Earth's potential future reveals a male polar bear that is unable to find a firm footing anywhere and has to resort to swimming\u2014which he cannot do indefinitely. His desperate need to eat brings him to a colony of [[walrus]]. Although he attacks repeatedly, the herd is successful in evading him by returning to the sea. Wounded and unable to feed, the bear will not survive. Meanwhile, back in Antarctica, the eggs of the emperor penguins finally hatch while two adult Polar bear cubs from Arctic travels onward as they wander across vast track of frozen ocean independently from their mother.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' tells of the battle with the elements to obtain the penguin footage and of unwelcome visits from polar bears.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Ice Worlds |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Vanessa Berlowitz |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-11-05}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Great Plains\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|11|12|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 8 April 2007\n |Viewers         = 6.72\n |ShortSummary    = This episode deals with [[savanna]], [[steppe]], [[tundra]], [[prairie]], and looks at the importance and resilience of [[grasses]] in such treeless ecosystems. Their vast expanses contain the largest concentration of animal life. In [[Outer Mongolia]], a herd of [[Mongolian gazelle]] flee a [[wildfire|bush fire]] and is forced to find new grazing, but grass self-repairs rapidly and soon reappears. Over Africa's savanna, a swarm of 1.5&nbsp;billion [[red-billed quelea]]s are caught on camera, the largest flock of birds ever depicted.<ref>{{cite web| title= Red-billed quelea|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00381fg|publisher=[[BBC One]]|access-date=17 May 2010}}</ref> On the Arctic tundra during spring, millions of [[bird migration|migratory]] [[snow goose|snow geese]] arrive to breed and their young are preyed on by Arctic foxes. Meanwhile, [[time-lapse photography]] depicts moving herds of caribou as a calf is brought down by a chasing wolf. On the [[North America]]n prairie, [[American bison|bison]] engage in the ritual to establish the dominant males. In [[Veld]] of [[South Africa]], flowers began to openly bloom every summer allowing [[Ostrich]]es and [[springbok]]s to thrive before nightfall. The [[Tibetan Plateau]] is the highest of the plains and despite its relative lack of grass, animals do survive there, including [[yak]] and [[kiang|wild ass]]. However, the area's most numerous resident is the [[pika]], whose nemesis is the [[Tibetan fox]]. In tropical India, the tall grasses hide some of the largest creatures,such as [[Indian Elephants]] and [[Indian rhinoceros]], and also the smallest, such as the [[pygmy hog]] and [[Lesser florican]]. The final sequence depicts [[African bush elephant]]s that are forced to share a waterhole with a pride of thirty lions. The insufficient water makes it an uneasy alliance and the latter gain the upper hand during the night when their hunger drives them to hunt and eventually kill one of the pachyderms.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' explains how the lion hunt was filmed in darkness using [[infrared]] light.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Great Plains |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Jonny Keeling |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-11-12}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Jungles\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|11|19|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 15 April 2007\n |Viewers         = 7.04\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Red eyed tree frog edit2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Costa Rican [[tree frog]]]]\n\nThis episode examines [[jungle]]s and [[tropical rainforest]]s. These environments occupy only 3% of the land yet are home to over half of the world's species. [[New Guinea]] is inhabited by almost 40 kinds of [[birds of paradise]], which avoid conflict with each other by living in different parts of the island. Some of their elaborate courtship displays are shown. Within the dense [[canopy (forest)|forest canopy]], [[sunlight]] is prized, and the death of a [[tree]] triggers a race by saplings to fill the vacant space. [[Ficus|Fig]]s are a widespread and popular food, and as many as 44 types of [[bird]] and [[monkey]] have been observed picking from a single tree. The sounds of the jungle throughout the day are explored, from the early morning calls of [[siamang]]s and [[orangutan]]s to the nocturnal cacophony of courting [[tree frog]]s. The importance of [[fungus|fungi]] to the [[Amazon rainforest]] is illustrated by a sequence of them fruiting, including a [[parasitism|parasite]] that infested on insects is called [[cordyceps]]. In [[Borneo]], nocturnal [[colugo]] is one of the rare species ever discovered and travels two miles while foraging for young leaves.The mutual benefits of the relationship between carnivorous [[pitcher plant]]s and red [[crab spider]]s is also discussed. In the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], roaming [[African forest elephant|forest elephants]] are shown reaching a clearing to feed on essential [[clay]] minerals within the mud. Finally, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s are one of the few jungle animals able to traverse both the forest floor and the canopy in search of food. In [[Uganda]], members of a 150-strong community of the primates mount a raid into neighbouring territory in order to gain control of it.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' looks at filming displaying birds of paradise, focusing mainly on the filming of the [[parotia|six-plumed bird of paradise]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Jungles |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Huw Cordey |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-11-19}}</ref> \"Jungles\" served as a major inspiration in developing the video game ''[[The Last of Us]]'', which features a mutated strain of the cordyceps fungus infecting humans and almost destroying mankind.\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = Shallow Seas\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|11|26|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 8 April 2007\n |Viewers         = 7.32\n |ShortSummary    = This programme<!-- Note \"programme\" is the correct British spelling. Please do not edit, thanks --> is devoted to the shallow seas that fringe the world's [[continent]]s. Although they constitute 8% of the oceans, they contain most marine life. As [[humpback whales]] return to breeding grounds in the tropics, a mother and its calf are followed. While the latter takes in up to 500 litres of milk a day, its parent will starve until it travels back to the poles to feed\u2014and it must do this while it still has sufficient energy left for the journey. The coral reefs of [[Indonesia]] are home to the biggest variety of ocean dwellers, including the [[Pygmy seahorse]]s, and [[Limaria fragilis|file clam]]. Other ocean dwellers such as banded sea [[bungarus|krait]]s, which ally themselves with [[goatfish]] and [[white trevally|trevally]] in order to hunt. Beyond the coral stretches the world of shifting sands, ocean dwellers, such as [[Gurnard]], [[Jawfish]], [[Green sea turtle]], and [[Wonderpus octopus]], are forced to cope with their environment through crucial camouflage and foraging where they have nowhere else hide. In [[Shark Bay]] of [[Western Australia]], [[Dugong]]s forage across the largest aquatic grassland  eating tons of seagrasses a day while [[bottlenose dolphin]]s perform their \"hydroplane\" in the shallowest waters to catch a meal. Meanwhile in the desert shores of [[Bahrain]], 100,000 [[Socotra cormorant]]s rely on [[shamal (wind)|shamal]]s that blow sand grains into the nearby [[Persian Gulf]], transforming it into a rich fishing ground. The appearance of [[algae]] in the spring starts a food chain that leads to an abundant harvest of [[Salp]]s, [[Krill]]s, and [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]]. As shoals of migratory fish feasts on the krills, [[sea lion]]s and [[dusky dolphin]]s are among those taking advantage of it. Within the coastline of [[California]], [[Macrocystis pyrifera|Giant kelp]]s fertilizes algaes making them the tallest kelps ever recorded which causes group of [[Sea urchin]]s to infest them creating urchin barrens. Within the urchin barrens, group of [[starfish]]es, [[sand dollar]]s, and [[brittle star]]s scavenge across the barrens while facing against their fierce predator, [[Sunflower sea star]]. In [[Southern Africa]], as [[squid|chokka squid]] are preyed on by [[short-tail stingray]] and [[sand tiger shark]], the [[Cape fur seal]]s that share the waters are hunted by the world's largest predatory fish\u2014the [[great white shark]]. On [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], a group of [[king penguin]]s must cross a beach occupied by neighboring [[Elephant seals]] that are harmless and predatory [[Fur seals]] that do not hesitate to attack them. In spring, The humpback whales ended their winter migration as they travel to the polar seas of the [[Bering Sea]] along with five million [[shearwaters]], migrated from Australia, as they flourish across the shallow waters for krills. The programme ends with the mother and calf, who is now old enough to separate with its mother and continues its epic journey across the ocean.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' shows the difficulties of filming the one-second strike of a great white shark, filmed by [[Simon King (television)|Simon King]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Shallow Seas |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Mark Brownlow |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-11-26}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |Title           = Seasonal Forests\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|3|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 22 April 2007\n |Viewers         = 7.42\n |ShortSummary    = [[File:Trees and sunshine.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A stand of giant [[redwoods]]]]\n\nThe penultimate episode surveys the [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] and [[deciduous]] seasonal [[woodland]] habitats\u2014the most extensive forests on Earth. Conifers begin sparsely in the [[subarctic]] but soon dominate the land, and the [[taiga]] circles the globe, containing a third of all the Earth's trees. Few creatures can survive the Arctic climate year round, but the [[moose]], [[capercaillie]], and [[wolverine]] are exceptions. {{convert|1600|km|mi}} to the south, on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of North America, conifers have reached their full potential. These include some of the world's [[List of tallest trees|tallest trees]]: the [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]]s. Here, a [[American marten|pine marten]] is shown stalking a [[western gray squirrel|squirrel]], and [[great grey owl]] chicks take their first flight. Further south still, in [[Chile]]'s [[Valdivian temperate rain forests|Valdivian forests]], a population of smaller animals exist, including the [[pud\u00fa]] and the [[kodkod]]. During spring in a European broad-leafed forest, a [[mandarin duck]] leads its day-old family to leap from its tree trunk nest to the leaf litter below. The [[Bialowieza Forest]] typifies the habitat that characterised Europe around 6,000 years ago: only a fragment remains in [[Poland]] and [[Belarus]]. On a summer night on North America's east coast, [[Magicicada|periodical cicada]]s emerge en masse to mate\u2014an event that occurs every seventeen years. After revisiting Russia's [[Amur leopard]]s in winter, a time-lapse sequence illustrates the effect of the ensuing spring on the deciduous forest floor. In India's teak forests, a [[grey langur|langur monkey]] strays too far from the [[chital]] that act as its sentinels and falls prey to a [[tiger]]. In [[Madagascar]], [[grey mouse lemur|mouse lemurs]] feed on the nectar of flowering [[Adansonia|baobab]] trees.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' explains how aerial shots of the [[Adansonia|baobab]] were achieved by the use of a [[cinebulle]], an adapted [[hot air balloon]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Seasonal Forests |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Mark Linfield |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-03-03}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 11\n |Title           = Ocean Deep\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|10|df=y}}\n |AltDate         = 25 March 2007\n |Viewers         = 6.02\n |ShortSummary    = The final instalment<!-- Note \"instalment\" is the correct British spelling. Please do not edit, thanks --> concentrates on the least explored area of the planet\u2014the [[deep ocean]]. It begins with a [[whale shark]] used as a shield by a shoal of [[bait fish]] to protect themselves from [[yellowfin tuna]]. Also shown is an [[oceanic whitetip shark]] trailing rainbow runners. Meanwhile, a 500-strong school of [[dolphin]]s head for the [[Azores]], where they work together to feast on [[mackerel scad|scad mackerel]] along with a flock of [[shearwater]]s. Down in the ocean's furthest reaches, some creatures defy classification. Beneath the dark seafloor, [[Deep sea creature]]s such as the [[sea spider]] filtering on marine snow, [[sawtooth eel]] gazing upward for prey shimmering from above the surface, [[Dumbo octopus]] roaming through the dark void, [[Vampire squid]] performing a special display of defense and predation, [[Monkfish]] luring prey for necessities, and the [[Japanese spider crab|spider crab]] bid their time, awaiting carrion from above along with eels and [[woodlice]]s.  The volcanic mountain chain at the bottom of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] also sustains life through the bacteria that surround its sulphide vents which allows shrimps to feed. Within the Western Pacific bordering [[Japan]] lies the Dragon chimneys erupted from thermal vents where different forms of baterias thrives. In [[Atlantic]], [[Squat lobster]]s settle near the hydrothermal vents grazing on bacterias. From the depths of Galapagos Island at the site of the Nine North, the chimneys provides energy for [[Riftia pachyptila|tube worms]] to grow and support settlement, but after nine months the chimneys turns cold causing the tube worms to wither and extinguished. There are thought to be around 30,000 [[undersea volcano]]es, some of them taller than [[Mount Everest]]. Their sheer cliffs provide anchorage for several corals and sponges. Nearer the surface, the currents that surround these [[seamount]]s force nutrients up from below and thus marine life around them is abundant, which allows the [[Nautilus]] to forage freely before retreat to the depth. Thirty miles away, the shoal of squids jets upwards to the stream to hunt small fish and planktons while avoiding the [[pantropical spotted dolphin|pacific spotted dolphin]]s as they use sonar to confuse their prey. The giant [[Mola Mola]] settle at reef for cleaning via [[butterfly fish]] feeding parasites and cool temperature. [[Ascension Island]] is a nesting ground for [[frigatebird]]s and [[green turtle]]s. Off the [[Mexico|Mexican]] coast, a large group of [[sailfish]] feed on another shoal of bait fish, changing colour to signal their intentions to each other, allowing them to coordinate their attack. The last sequence depicts the largest animal on Earth\u2014the [[blue whale]], of which 300,000 once roamed the world's oceans with 3000 individuals roam the planet which they are now fewer than 3% remain.\n''Planet Earth Diaries'' shows the search in the [[Bahamas]] for oceanic whitetip sharks.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Ocean Deep |series=Planet Earth |credits=Produced by Andy Byatt |network=BBC |station=BBC One |airdate=2006-03-10}}</ref>\n |LineColor       = 00B050\n}}\n}}\n\n{{quotation|\"Our planet is still full of wonders.
