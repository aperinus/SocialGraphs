It stars [[Danny DeVito]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Judge Reinhold]], [[Anita Morris]], and [[Helen Slater]], with [[Bill Pullman]] in a supporting role in his film debut. The film is the story of a couple who kidnap their ex-boss's wife to get revenge and extort money from him. They soon realize he does not want her back and was planning to kill her himself.  Meanwhile, the boss's mistress plans a blackmail attempt on him which also fails to go as planned.\n\nThis was the last film released under the Touchstone Films name before it was renamed to Touchstone Pictures by Disney.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] fashion tycoon Sam Stone despises his wife, Barbara, having married her for her family wealth, and plans to murder her so he can inherit her $15{{nbsp}}million{{efn|Barbara Stone's family wealth of $15{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|15000000|1986}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} fortune and retire with his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] Carol. He returns home armed with chloroform but finds Barbara is missing and receives a call from her abductor, demanding $500,000 for her return and threatening to kill her if the police or media are involved. Hoping to get Barbara killed, Sam deliberately ignores the demands.\n\nThe abductors, Ken and Sandy Kessler, are a [[American lower class|lower-class]] couple targeting Sam because he built his business using the Kesslers' life savings and fashion designs he stole from Sandy. They detain Barbara in their basement but she proves difficult to control, and Sandy feels guilty about their actions. Intending to financially blackmail Sam, Carol sends her lover Earl to film Sam at the cliff from which he intended to dispose of Barbara, but, unaware of Sam's appearance, Earl unwittingly films a man having sex with a prostitute, mistaking her screams for Barbara dying. Without watching the tape, Carol forwards a copy to Sam who assumes it is a seductive birthday present, and she interprets his lewd response as a threat, causing her and Earl to go into hiding.\n\nBored and overweight, Barbara begins following television exercise programs. She is eventually overjoyed to realize she has lost {{convert|20|lbs|kg|sigfig=1}} and bonds with Sandy after being impressed by her fashion ideas and dress designs, in which she now can fit. Meanwhile, Ken repeatedly drops the ransom price, eventually reaching $10,000, but Sam refuses to pay and encourages Ken to kill Barbara. Although Ken is confronted as a suspect because of tire tracks at the Stone residence, the investigation is redirected when Carol, hoping to incriminate Sam, sends another copy of the tape to police chief Henry Benton, unaware he is the man on the tape. Assuming he is being blackmailed, Benton has Sam investigated and arrested following the discovery of the chloroform and photos of him with Carol.\n\nRealizing he is incapable of being a ruthless criminal, Ken returns home to collect Sandy and flee to [[Mexico]]. He learns that Sandy has released Barbara and they want to work together to develop and sell Sandy's fashion designs. The Bedroom Killer, a notorious local serial killer, invades their home and confronts them and Barbara as she returns, leading to an altercation in which he dies after falling down the basement stairs. Realizing that Sam wanted her dead and having learned of his affair, Barbara collaborates with Ken and Sandy to take revenge by blackmailing him for his entire personal fortune worth over $2.2{{nbsp}}million.{{efn|Sam Stone's personal wealth of $2{{nbsp}}million is equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|2200000|1986}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US}}.}} After being bailed out of jail, Sam reluctantly collects the ransom in a briefcase, desperate to prove his innocence in Barbara's disappearance. Carol finally views the tape and, realizing Earl's mistake, reconnects with Sam to learn when the ransom handover will take place and that the police, now distrustful of Sam, will not accompany him.\n\nEarl ambushes Sam and a masked Ken at the exchange, but they are surrounded by scores of police, and Earl is arrested. Ken warns the police that Barbara will be killed if they try to stop him, and drives off followed by a police convoy. Cornered, he drives off the end of the [[Santa Monica Pier]] and seemingly drowns. The police recover the body of the Bedroom Killer, disguised as Ken, from the car but are unable to locate the ransom money. Despite his loss, Sam is elated that Barbara must be dead until she arrives on the pier, identifies the Killer as her abductor, and throws Sam into the water. Elsewhere, Ken emerges from the ocean in scuba gear, carrying the ransom money, and celebrates with the waiting Sandy and Barbara.\n\n==Cast==\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:DannyDeVito-camerimage.jpg|alt=Danny DeVito|Danny DeVito<br />''(pictured in 2019)''\nFile:BetteMidler90cropped.jpg|alt=Bette Midler|Bette Midler<br />''(pictured in 1990)''\n\nFile:Judge Reinhold at the 47th Emmy Awards afterparty cropped and airbrushed.jpg|alt=Judge Reinhold|Judge Reinhold<br />''(pictured in 1994)''\nFile:10.17.09HelenSlaterByLuigiNovi.jpg|alt=Helen Slater|Helen Slater<br />''(pictured in 2009)''\n</gallery>\n\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Sam Stone\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Barbara Stone\n* [[Judge Reinhold]] as Ken Kessler\n* [[Helen Slater]] as Sandy Kessler\n* [[Anita Morris]] as Carol Dodsworth\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Earl Mott\n* [[William G.

However, they were contacted by [[Michael Eisner]], who became head of Disney after working with the trio at Paramount. According to David Zucker, Eisner \"said he had a script that we wouldn't be able to turn down and he was right. It was too good. It was very well written with great characters.

One of the delights of the movie is that its script dares to complicate what could have been a much more straightforward yarn. Danny DeVito's character of Sam Stone, a vulgar, wealthy, Bel Air dress manufacturer, is a hard-nosed classic, admitting in the film's opening sequence that he married his wife because she was very, very rich and her wealthy father was very, very sick.
