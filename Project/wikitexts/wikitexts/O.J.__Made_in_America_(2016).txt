The series also received a [[Peabody Award]] for its work.\n\n==Premise==\nThrough interviews, news footage, and archival audio and video, ''O.J.: Made in America'' traces the life and career of [[O. J. Simpson]], starting with his arrival at the [[University of Southern California]] as an emerging football superstar and ending with his incarceration in [[O. J. Simpson robbery case|2007 for robbery]].  Throughout the documentary, Simpson's life \u2013 the football success, television & acting career, relationship with [[Nicole Brown Simpson|Nicole Brown]], the domestic abuse, Nicole and [[Ron Goldman]]'s murder, [[O. J. Simpson murder case|the trial]] \u2013 runs parallel to the larger narrative of the city of [[Los Angeles]], which serves as host to mounting racial tensions, and a volatile relationship between the city's [[Los Angeles Police Department|police department]] and the African American community. Footage from the Watts Riots was used as well as the entire Rodney King video, which most news outlets and documentaries only use in parts. Both of these events are used to set up and explain what happened during the Simpson murder trial.\n\nTelevision critic [[James Poniewozik]] described the director's technique in his ''New York Times'' review: \"Ezra Edelman pulls back, way back, like a news chopper over a freeway chase. Before you hear about the trial, the documentary says, you need to hear all the stories \u2013 the stories of race, celebrity, sports, America \u2013 that it's a part of.\"<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title= Television: Two Astonishing Views of O.J.

J. Simpson murder case#Arrest|police chase of O. J. Simpson]].<ref name=\"June171994\" /> ESPN Films executive producer [[Connor Schell]] said, \"If you are going to do O. J. Simpson, you are going to cover June 1994 to Oct. 1995 \u2013 it is unavoidable. But if you are interested in things that came before it and after it, then it has to be longer than the traditional two-hour form.\" This led to a meeting between Schell and director [[Ezra Edelman]] in February 2014, where Schell expressed interest in creating a five-hour documentary on Simpson. Edelman initially declined, as he felt \"there was nothing left to say about him\". Edelman eventually agreed to the project, realizing that [[O. J. Simpson murder case|Simpson's trial]] did not have to be the focus, or if he was innocent or guilty, rather, Edelman \"could use that canvas to tell a deeper story about race in America, about the city of Los Angeles, the relationship between the black community and the police, and who O. J. was and his rise to celebrity. That's the story I wanted to tell.\"<ref name=\"SIReview\" />\n\nThroughout the 18-month process from conception to completion, Edelman conducted 72 interviews for the documentary, \"including key players from the prosecution ([[Marcia Clark]], [[Gil Garcetti]] and [[William Hodgman (prosecutor)|Bill Hodgman]]), Simpson's defense team ([[F. Lee Bailey]], [[Carl E. Douglas]] and [[Barry Scheck]]), childhood friends of Simpson (Joe Bell and Calvin Tennyson), relatives of Simpson (cousin Dwight Tucker), fellow football players ([[Jim Brown]] and Earl Edwards), jurors from the criminal trial (Carrie Bess and Yolanda Crawford), former LAPD detectives involved in the case ([[Mark Fuhrman]] and Tom Lange) and African-American civil rights activists ([[Harry Edwards (sociologist)|Dr. Harry Edwards]], [[Danny Bakewell]] and [[Cecil Murray]])\", and people who could speak on behalf of Ron Goldman (his father Fred Goldman) and Nicole Brown Simpson (her sister Tanya Brown, her friends David LeBon and Robin Greer, and her boyfriend Keith Zlomsowitch). Edelman also reached out to Simpson through a letter, which was never answered; he had also hoped to include Simpson's first wife, Marguerite L. Whitley, who could not be contacted, and former L.A. County district attorney [[Christopher Darden]], who declined participation. Despite envisioning the project as a five-hour documentary, the final film was screened to ESPN Films executives at 7.5 hours in length, to which Schell said they would figure out the programming end, as they were \"going to give Ezra the time he needs to tell this story\".<ref name=\"SIReview\" /> The initial plan was to break the film into three parts \u2013 \"everything leading up to the murder and then the trial and then everything after the trial\" \u2013 before a five-part format was settled on.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oj-made-america-director-reveals-made-part-documentary/story?id=39766136|title=''OJ: Made in America'' Director Reveals How He Made the 5-Part Documentary|last=Messer|first=Lesley|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=June 11, 2016|access-date=June 19, 2016}}</ref> In January 2016, ESPN Films announced ''O.J.: Made in America'' for part of their ''30 for 30'' series.<ref name=\"Announcement\" />\n\n[[Ishmael Reed]] was interviewed by director Ezra Edelman for ''O.J.: Made in America'', however his interview wasn't used in the documentary.<ref name=\"counterpunch.org\">{{cite web |last=Reed|first=Ishmael|author-link=Ishmael Reed|title= OJ and Jeffrey Toobin: Black Bogeyman Auctioneer|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/07/01/oj-and-jeffrey-toobin-black-bogeyman-auctioneer/|website=counterpunch|date=July 1, 2016 |access-date=October 29, 2022|language=en}}</ref> Reed was critical of the documentary in an article he wrote for the magazine [[CounterPunch]].<ref name=\"counterpunch.org\"/> He stated, \u201cIn the series, other prosecutors yammered on and on about theories that were disproven in court.

I would have watched it for another eight hours...

O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt the film \"has the grandeur and authority of the best long-form nonfiction. If it were a book, it could sit on the shelf alongside ''[[The Executioner's Song]]'' by [[Norman Mailer]] and the great biographical works of [[Robert Caro]]. It's very much a film, though, a feat of tireless research, dogged interviewing and skillful editing.\" However, Scott felt a \"significant blind spot\" for the film was its \"predominance of male voices among the interview subjects, and the narrowness of the film's discussion of domestic violence... [T]he film, which so persuasively treats law enforcement racism as a systemic problem, can't figure out how to treat violence against women with the same kind of rigor or nuance\", adding that \"O. J. Simpson is viewed as a symbol\" while \"Nicole Brown Simpson's fate, in contrast, is treated as an individual tragedy, and there seems to be no political vocabulary available to the filmmakers to understand what happened to her. The deep links between misogyny and American sports culture remain unexamined.\"<ref name=\"NYTReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n!
