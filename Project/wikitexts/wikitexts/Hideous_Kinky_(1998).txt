Based on [[Esther Freud]]'s semi-autobiographical 1992 [[Hideous Kinky|novel of the same name]], it follows a young [[England|English]] mother who moves from [[London]] to [[Morocco]] with her two young daughters in the early 70s. The film stars [[Kate Winslet]] and French-Moroccan actor [[Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui]]. The soundtrack mixes original music with songs from the 60s, including tracks from [[Canned Heat]], [[Richie Havens]] and [[The Incredible String Band]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1972, disenchanted about the dreary conventions of English life, 25-year-old Julia (Winslet) heads for [[Morocco]] with her daughters, six-year-old Lucy and eight-year-old Bea. Living in a low-rent [[Marrakech]] hotel, the trio survive on the sale of hand-sewn dolls and money from the girls' father, a London poet who also has a child from another woman.\n\nAfter the girls match their mother with gentle Moroccan acrobat and [[confidence trick|conman]] Bilal, sexual gears are set in motion. He eventually moves in with them and serves as a surrogate father. Julia's friend Eva urges Julia to study in Algiers with a revered [[Sufi]] master at a school of \"the annihilation of the ego\". In another sequence, European dandy Santoni invites Julia and the girls to his villa. As finances dwindle, Bilal's philosophy is \"God will provide\", although usually it is Bilal himself who provides. Sometimes he also disappears. At one point Bea contracts a [[streptococcus]] infection while he is gone and nearly dies. Bilal returns only to disappear again, but he has a plan. They discover that three return tickets that suddenly appear have been bought by him with money he got from the sale of his uniform. In the end, Julia and the girls board a train back to London.\n\n==Reception==\nKate Winslet's performance won praise from many reviewers. In ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Lisa Schwartzbaum argued that Winslet \"perfectly projects that naive self-centeredness with which a Woodstock generation of young wanderers, seeking spiritual revelation, made their way to cultures as exotic as their thumbs could take them\". In ''Variety'', critic Lisa Nesselson also praised the \"radiant\" and \"sturdy\" Winslet for her performance, and argued that the film was \"filtered through a sober and intelligent artistic eye\". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Craig Mathieson called the film \"a compelling authentic journey\".\n\n==Main cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Julia\n* [[Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui]] as Bilal\n* Bella Riza as Bea\n* Carrie Mullan as Lucy\n* [[Pierre Cl\u00e9menti]] as Santoni\n* Sira Stampe as Eva\n* [[Abigail Cruttenden]] as Charlotte\n* [[Amidou]] as Sufi Sheikh\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Patricia\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0136244|title=Hideous Kinky}}\n* {{Amg movie|173744|Hideous Kinky}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|id=hideous_kinky|title=Hideous Kinky}}\n\n{{Gillies MacKinnon}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 drama films]]\n[[Category:1998 independent films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n[[Category:1990s Arabic-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about sisters]]\n[[Category:Films based on biographies]]\n[[Category:Films set in Morocco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1970s]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gillies MacKinnon]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1998 multilingual films]]\n[[Category:British multilingual films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
