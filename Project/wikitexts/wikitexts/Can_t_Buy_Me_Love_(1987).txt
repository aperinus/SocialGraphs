The film takes its title from a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song of the [[Can't Buy Me Love|same title]].\n\n==Plot==\nRonald Miller is a typical high school nerd living in suburban [[Tucson, Arizona]]. He has spent all summer mowing lawns to save up for a [[telescope]]. At an opportune moment, he makes a deal with next-door neighbor and popular [[cheerleader]] Cindy Mancini. She had borrowed her mother's expensive suede outfit without permission to wear to a party, only to have wine accidentally spilled on it. Cindy reluctantly agrees to help Ronald look \"cool\" by posing as his girlfriend for a month for $1,000 (which was used to replace the ruined outfit), although she already has a boyfriend, Bobby, who is attending the [[University of Iowa]].\n\nRonald then trades his nerdy, yet loyal, friends for the popular but shallow students, and undergoes a complete clothing and hair makeover under Cindy's direction. Over time, a bond develops between them. Cindy has Ronald read a secret poem she wrote that means a great deal to her. In turn, Ronald reveals his interests in [[astronomy]] and [[spaceflight|space travel]]. On their last date that Ronald paid for, Cindy begins to have real feelings for him and hints that she would like to kiss him, but he misunderstands. The next day at school, they stage a breakup in front of a crowd, but Ronald takes things too far and says some hurtful things about Cindy in front of her friends. She remains calm and distant, but informs Ronald that popularity is hard work and that he needs to make sure that he \"stays himself.\" The next day, Cindy notices him behaving arrogantly at school, and becomes jealous when she sees him flirting with her best friends Barbara and Patty.\n\nRonald takes Patty to a school dance, where he performs a dance he learned from an African cultural show on public television he mistakenly thought was the latest dance craze performed on ''[[American Bandstand]]''. At first, the other kids are mystified, but they soon join in, and Ronald's new \"trendy\" dancing further increases his popularity. On [[Halloween]] night, he and some jocks drive to the house of Kenneth, Ronald's best friend, where the jocks test his loyalty by coercing him to hurl dog feces at Kenneth's house. Kenneth is lying in wait and catches Ronald, but lets him go before his father can call the police. Kenneth ignores him the next day at school.\n\nAt a New Year's Eve party at Big John's house, Ronald starts drinking and has a romantic tryst with his date, Iris, in the bathroom. Cindy walks by and hears Ronald reciting her special poem to Iris. Devastated, Cindy starts drinking even more. Later, Cindy's boyfriend, Bobby, unexpectedly shows up at the party. After Bobby learns about Cindy's \"relationship\" with Ronald, he breaks up with her. Cindy tries to explain that Ronald paid her to pretend they were dating, but Bobby does not believe her and walks out on her. In a drunken rage, Cindy reveals the truth about her and Ronald to the partygoers, and Ronald is immediately ostracized. Dejected, he leaves and spends the night in his garage crying himself to sleep. When school resumes, he finds himself a social outcast, by both the jocks and the nerds. His attempts to reconcile with both Cindy and Kenneth are rebuffed.\n\nRonald gets an opportunity to redeem himself at lunch when he sees Quint, a jock, bullying Kenneth after noticing Kenneth helping Patty with her math homework. Quint threatens Kenneth with physical violence if Kenneth does not go back to \"his side of the cafeteria.\" Ronald intervenes, threatening to break Quint's pitching arm if he does not leave Kenneth alone. Ronald points out that the three were all friends at one time: when they were nine, Quint fell out of their treehouse and broke his arm and Kenneth and Ronald carried him twelve blocks to the hospital. Ronald confesses he was desperate to run with the popular crowd but had messed up by trying to buy his way in (unlike Kenneth, who was helping Patty out of a genuine interest in her), that the clique dynamic is \"all bullshit\" and that it is tough enough just being yourself, and walks away. Quint apologizes to Kenneth and they shake hands as the whole school applauds. Ronald officially redeems himself with his friends and Cindy.\n\nRecognizing Ronald's worth, Cindy chooses to spend an evening with him rather than hang out with her friends, hopping on the back of his riding lawnmower. Ronald then asks Cindy to prom, and they kiss for the first time, as the Beatles' title song plays. The new couple then ride off into the sunset on the lawnmower.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Patrick Dempsey]] as Ronald Miller\n* [[Amanda Peterson]] as Cindy Mancini<ref name=cast/>\n* Tina Caspary as Barbara\n* [[Darcy DeMoss]] as [[Patty]]<ref name=cast>{{Cite journal |last=Earle |first=William James |date=2013-04-18 |title=Can't Buy Me Love |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phil.12010 |journal=The Philosophical Forum |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=179\u2013201 |doi=10.1111/phil.12010 |issn=0031-806X}}</ref>\n* [[Cort McCown]] as Quint\n* [[Eric Bruskotter]] as Big John\n* [[Gerardo Mej\u00eda]] as Ricky\n* [[Courtney Gains]] as Kenneth Wurman\n* [[Seth Green]] as Chuck Miller\n* [[Sharon Farrell]] as Mrs. Mancini<ref name=cast/>\n* [[Dennis Dugan]] as David Miller\n* Cloyce Morrow as Judy Miller\n* [[Devin DeVasquez]] as Iris\n* [[Ami Dolenz]] as Fran\n* Will Hannah  as Camera Salesman\n* Lisa Givens as Bambi La Brock\n* [[Max Perlich]] as Lester\n}}\n\n==Production notes==\nThe film was shot on location in Tucson, Arizona, at [[Tucson High Magnet School]] (then known as Tucson High School).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edweb.tusd.k12.az.us/thms/site/HistoryR.html |title=THMS History |access-date=12 Feb 2014 |last=Huestis |first=Lucy |publisher=Tucson Unified School District |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222022407/http://edweb.tusd.k12.az.us/thms/site/HistoryR.html |archive-date=2014-02-22 }}</ref> The [[choreography]] is by [[Paula Abdul]], who makes an uncredited appearance as a dancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092718/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title=Can't Buy Me Love (1987) - Full Cast & Crew |access-date=12 Feb 2014 |publisher=IMDb }}</ref>\n\nOn a date where the main characters begin to bond, they jump the perimeter wall and explore the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group]] Aircraft Bone Yard on [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]] that contains 4,400 aircraft.\n\nThe film was originally titled ''Boy Rents Girl'' but was changed when rights to The Beatles song of the same name were obtained.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Can't Buy Me Love'' received mixed reviews from critics. Caryn James, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that the film missed its mark and traded its potential originality for a bid at popularity: {{cquote|Michael Swerdlick, the writer, and Steve Rash, the director ... waste a chance to make the much deeper, funnier movie that strains to break through.... [The film] ... has an identity crisis that's a mirror-image of Ronald's own. He thinks he wants popularity at any price, though he's really a sincere guy. The film thinks it wants to be sincere, when all it truly wants is to be popular, just like the other kids' movies, so it sells off its originality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE5DD1F3FF937A2575BC0A961948260|title=Film: 'Can't Buy Me Love'|first=Caryn|last=James|access-date=29 June 2018}}</ref>}}\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a half star out of a possible 4: {{cquote|If \"Can't Buy Me Love\" had been intended as a [[satire|satirical]] attack on American values \u2013 if cynicism had been its target \u2013 we might be on to something here.
