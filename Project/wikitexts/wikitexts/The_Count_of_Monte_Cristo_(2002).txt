[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] is in exile on the island. Having kept his guardians from killing the pair, Bonaparte privately requests that Edmond deliver a letter to the mainland in exchange for his physician\u2019s services. Edmond is sworn to secrecy, but Fernand witnesses the exchange. In [[Marseille]], the company owner, Morrell, commends Edmond for his bravery, promoting him to captain over [[first mate]] Danglars, who had given Edmond explicit orders not to land at Elba. Edmond thereafter states his intention to marry his girlfriend, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, whom Fernand lusts after.\n\nEnvious of Edmond\u2019s good fortune, Fernand and Danglars inform on Edmond regarding Bonaparte's letter, which reveals information that could be used to aid Bonaparte's escape from Elba. Villefort, the city's chief magistrate, has Edmond arrested, but initially prepares to exonerate him until he learns the letter is addressed to his own father, Monsieur Clarion, a [[Bonapartist]]. He burns the letter and orders Edmond imprisoned in the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'If]]. Edmond escapes from Villefort and goes to Fernand for help, but Fernand instead turns him over to the pursuing gendarmes. Edmond is consigned to the island prison and its sadistic warden, Armand Dorleac. In exchange for persuading Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s that Edmond has been executed for treason and that she should take comfort in Fernand, Villefort has Fernand assassinate his father.\n\nSix years later, Edmond is startled in his cell by an eruption in the ground revealing another prisoner, [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]], who has been imprisoned for 11 years after refusing to tell Bonaparte the whereabouts of the treasure of the Spada family. Faria has been digging an escape tunnel, but upon seeing that he is in Edmond's cell, he realizes he dug in the wrong direction. In exchange for Edmond's help digging a new tunnel, Faria educates him in a wide array of academic and martial disciplines. Faria is fatally injured in a tunnel cave-in, but before dying he gives Edmond a map to the treasure and implores him to use it only for good. Edmond escapes the prison by taking Faria's place in the disposal of his corpse, and is thrown into the sea, pulling Dorleac along with him and drowning him.\n\nWading ashore, Edmond encounters a band of pirates preparing to execute one of their own, Jacopo. Their leader, Luigi Vampa, decides justice and entertainment would be better served by pitting Edmond against Jacopo in a knife fight. Edmond wins but spares Jacopo, who swears himself to Edmond for life. They both work with the pirates until they arrive in Marseille. Edmond learns from Morrell, who does not recognize him, that Fernand and Danglars were complicit in his betrayal, and that Fernand and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s wed shortly after Edmond was imprisoned. With Faria's map, he and Jacopo locate the treasure on the island of [[Montecristo]]. With his newfound wealth and comprehensive education, Edmond establishes himself in Parisian society as \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" with Jacopo as his manservant, and swears vengeance on those who conspired against him.\n\nEdmond ingratiates himself to the Mondegos by staging the kidnap and rescue of their son, Albert. He lures Fernand, Villefort, and Danglars into a trap by letting slip the notion that he has located the treasure of Spada, and is shipping it through Marseille. His plans result in Danglars being caught red-handed in the act of theft, and Villefort being tricked into revealing his role in his father's death; both are arrested. Fernand is brought to financial ruin as Edmond has his gambling debts called in. Even though his appearance has changed dramatically, Edmond is recognized by Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. Eventually, she softens him, and they rekindle their relationship. As Fernand prepares to flee, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s reveals the only reason she married him was that she was pregnant with Albert, who is actually Edmond\u2019s son.\n\nEdmond ambushes Fernand in the ruins of his family's country estate, having led him to believe that the treasure of Spada would be waiting for him. Albert intervenes when Edmond attempts to kill Fernand, but Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s tells him of his true parentage. Fernand attempts to flee, but changes his mind upon realizing that Edmond has everything and he has nothing, and challenges Edmond to a fight to the death; Edmond prevails. \n\nEdmond purchases Ch\u00e2teau d'If, intending to raze it, but instead leaves it standing as he swears to Faria to use his vast resources for good and departs with his new family.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material.
