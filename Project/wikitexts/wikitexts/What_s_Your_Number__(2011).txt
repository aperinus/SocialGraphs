Written by Gabrielle Allan and [[Jennifer Crittenden]], it is based on [[Karyn Bosnak]]'s book ''20 Times a Lady''. It was released on {{nowrap|September 30}}, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Boston]], Ally Darling is a thirty-something woman, struggling to make better life decisions. Her boyfriend Rick breaks up with her when she asks him to attend her sister Daisy's wedding, and she then gets laid off. On the subway home, Ally comes across a ''Marie Claire'' magazine article entitled \"What's Your Number?\", which says that women who have more than twenty lovers in their lifetime have difficulty finding a husband.\n\nAfter making a list of all the men she slept with, she realizes she's at 19, making her decide not to have sex with anyone else until she finds \"the one\". This lasts all of a few hours when she wakes up after Daisy's bachelorette party and discovers that she hooked up with her ex-boss Roger while drunk.\n\nHoping to avoid an awkward confrontation, Ally lets her musician neighbor Colin Shea into her apartment so that Roger will leave. It turns out that Colin was only over to avoid a girl he just slept with, because he doesn't want to give the women he sees any expectations.\n\nAlly then runs into \"Disgusting Donald\", her once overweight ex-boyfriend, now successful and attractive with his fianc\u00e9e. She decides to track down all her exes hoping that one will have grown into the man she wants to marry, and therefore the number of men she has slept with won't ever increase. She gets help from Colin, who is skilled in \"digging up dirt\", to find all her exes in exchange for letting him stay in her place after his one-night stands, telling Colin to pay particular attention to one ex Jake Adams, who Ally sees as \"the one that got away\".\n\nThings do not quite work as Ally hoped and, one-by-one, she remembers why it didn't work out with each. It ranged from one being in the same job since their break-up to another requiring her to pretend to be British. Depressed after the failed meetings, Ally has a night out with Colin culminating in their growing closer and almost having sex. She stops him, but decides to take him as her date to Daisy's wedding. Daisy and Ally's friends worry she is falling for him, warning and reminding her of his promiscuous nature. She is later infuriated to find out Colin had found Jake Adams' contact details but withheld them, believing they were going to become an item, and they have a falling-out.\n\nAlly successfully contacts Jake, and they begin to date again. She takes him to her sister's wedding while Colin and his band perform at a different one. Dancing with her dad at the reception, he makes her realize that her happiness lies in being herself. (Not pleasing her mom, who wants her to marry Jake Adams.) Dancing with Jake, Ally confesses her \"number\" (\"body count\") to Jake, and he, thinking she is joking, expresses disgust at the thought. Ally quickly realizes her true feelings lie with Colin and she and Jake are incompatible, so she breaks it off with him. In doing so, she casts aside her fears (in principle) over her number. Ally then goes around the city to numerous weddings to find Colin and confesses her feelings.\n\nWaking up with Colin the next morning, Ally gets a call from an old fling telling her that they in fact did not sleep together. Ally rejoices in the fact that Colin is indeed the 20th and last (ongoing) man, with whom she will ever be.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Ally Darling\n**Nadine Jacobson as Ally (age 14)\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Colin Shea\n* [[Ari Graynor]] as Daisy Anne Darling\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Ava Darling\n* [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] as Mr. Darling\n* [[Oliver Jackson-Cohen]] as Eddie Vogel\n* [[Dave Annable]] as Jake Adams\n**Colby Parsons as Jake (age 14)\n* [[Heather Burns]] as Eileen\n* [[Eliza Coupe]] as Sheila\n* Kate Simses as Katie\n* [[Tika Sumpter]] as Jamie\n* [[Joel McHale]] as Roger the Boss\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Disgusting Donald\n* [[Denise Vasi]] as Cara\n* [[Zachary Quinto]] as Rick\n* [[Mike Vogel]] as Dave Hansen\n* [[Martin Freeman]] as Simon\n* [[Andy Samberg]] as Jerry Perry\n* [[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]] as Dr. Barrett Ingold\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Tom Piper\n* [[Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107]] as Jacinda\n* [[Aziz Ansari]] as Jay\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release, reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''What's Your Number?'' grossed $14 million in the U.S. and Canada and $16.4 million in other territories, for a total gross of $30.4 million against a budget of $20 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=whatsyournumber.htm |title=What's Your Number |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=2011-10-02 |access-date=2011-12-02}}</ref> It grossed $5.4 million in its opening weekend, finishing 8th at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weekend Box Office Results for September 30-October 2, 2011|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2011&wknd=39&p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=2011-10-03|access-date=2012-01-21}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n''What's Your Number?'' received negative reviews from critics.
