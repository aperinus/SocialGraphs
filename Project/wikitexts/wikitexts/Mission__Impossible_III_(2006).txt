J. Abrams]] in his directorial debut and produced by, and starring, [[Tom Cruise]], from a screenplay by Abrams, [[Alex Kurtzman]] and [[Roberto Orci]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' (1996) and ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'' (2000) and the third installment in the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. It also stars [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]], [[Keri Russell]], [[Maggie Q]] and [[Laurence Fishburne]]. In ''Mission: Impossible III'', retired [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) agent and trainer [[Ethan Hunt]] (Cruise) is forced to return to active duty to capture elusive arms dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman).\n\nDevelopment for a third ''Mission: Impossible'' film began in 2002, with [[David Fincher]] slated to direct; he and his eventual replacement [[Joe Carnahan]] both departed by 2004, both citing creative differences. Abrams was hired months later at the behest of Cruise, who was a fan of Abrams' ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' (2001\u20132006), but this further delayed production on the film due to Abrams' contractual obligations for ''Alias'' and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' (2006\u20132010), and caused prospective cast additions [[Kenneth Branagh]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], and [[Scarlett Johansson]] to depart the film. Principal photography began in July 2005 and lasted until that October, with filming locations including [[Shanghai]], [[Berlin]], [[Rome]], [[Los Angeles]], and the [[Vatican City]].\n\n''Mission: Impossible III'' premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] on April 26, 2006, and was released in the United States by [[Paramount Pictures]] on May 5, 2006. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its pacing, Hoffman's performance, and action sequences, and considered it an improvement over its predecessor. The film grossed $399 million worldwide, becoming the [[2006 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of 2006]]. The sequel, ''[[Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol]]'', was released in 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots are between 400 and 700 words only. As of January 2021, this is 650 words. If you add words, cut other words out-->\n[[Ethan Hunt]] has retired from fieldwork for the IMF. He instead trains recruits while settling down with his fianc\u00e9e, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan's real job. He is approached by IMF Assistant Director of Operations John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner [[Luther Stickell]].\n\nThe team rescues Lindsey in [[Berlin]] and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it kills her. IMF Director Theodore Brassel reprimands Ethan and Musgrave. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic [[microdot]] under the stamp.\n\nIMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in [[Vatican City]] to obtain a mysterious object codenamed the \"Rabbit's Foot.\" Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel. The team infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian.\n\nEthan threatens to drop Davian from the plane on the return flight as he interrogates him about the Rabbit's Foot, but Davian refuses to reveal anything. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot from Lindsey contains a warning that Brassel is seemingly working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel]] is ambushed by German-speaking mercenaries, who extract Davian while deploying a [[MQ-9 Reaper]] [[missile]]-armed drone. Realizing Julia is also in danger, Ethan races to Julia's workplace to discover she has already been kidnapped. Davian calls Ethan and gives him 48 hours to recover the Rabbit's Foot in exchange for Julia's life. Before Ethan can, he is captured by the IMF.\n\nMusgrave takes part in Ethan's interrogation. He discreetly mouths that the Rabbit's Foot is located in [[Shanghai]] and assists Ethan in escaping. Ethan is declared an enemy of the state and placed on Interpol's most-wanted list. Ethan secretly travels to Shanghai, where Declan, Zhen, and Luther, sent by Musgrave under the guise of another operation, assist him in acquiring the Rabbit's Foot. As he delivers the Rabbit's Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he regains consciousness, a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. Restrained, Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint, tied up and gagged in a chair. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit's Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves the room.\n\nMusgrave arrives and reveals himself as the actual IMF traitor; he explains that Julia is still alive. The woman killed was Davian's translator disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of the Rabbit's Foot. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit's Foot and sell it to a terrorist group so that IMF would have reason to launch a preemptive strike to increase the American military presence in the Middle East. When Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan knocks him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgrave's phone to track the last call's location to find Julia. With help from Benji on the phone, he locates the place but encounters Davian and some of his henchmen. Ethan kills the henchmen, but Davian arms the explosive in Ethan's head. Ethan fights and kills Davian. He comes back to free Julia and jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Julia fights off and kills a henchman, then Musgrave, who is carrying the Rabbit's Foot. She resuscitates Ethan, who finally explains his IMF career to her.\n\nBack in the US, Brassel and others congratulate Ethan as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, the three \u201cwith\u201d and roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Ethan Hunt]], an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) and protagonist of the film.\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as [[Luther Stickell]], a computer hacker and IMF agent.\n* [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] as Owen Davian, an arms dealer who looks for the Rabbit's Foot.\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Julia Meade, Ethan's fianc\u00e9e and a nurse.\n* [[Maggie Q]] as Zhen Lei, an IMF Agent who assists Ethan at the Vatican and Shanghai.\n* [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] as Declan Gormley, an IMF Agent who assists Ethan at Vatican & Shanghai.\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as John Musgrave, the IMF Assistant Director who recruits Ethan to find Farris, later to be found working with Davian\n* [[Keri Russell]] as Lindsey Farris, an IMF agent held captive at Berlin.\n* [[Simon Pegg]] as Benjamin \"Benji\" Dunn, an IMF agent and technician.\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Theodore Brassel, the IMF Director who recruits Ethan to find Davian.\n* [[Bahar Soomekh]] as Davian's translator\n* [[Jeff Chase]] as Davian's bodyguard\n* [[Michael Berry Jr.]] as Julia's kidnapper\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Brownway\n* [[Bellamy Young]] as Rachael\n* [[Carla Gallo]] as Beth\n* [[Greg Grunberg]] as Kevin\n* [[Rose Rollins]] as Ellie\n* [[Sasha Alexander]] as Melissa Meade\n* [[Aaron Paul]] as Rick Meade\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=\"I think the problem with third movies is the people who are financing them are experts on how they should be made and what they should be.
