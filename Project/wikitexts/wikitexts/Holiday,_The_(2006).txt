Co-produced by [[Bruce A. Block]], it was filmed in both California and England, and stars [[Kate Winslet]] and [[Cameron Diaz]] as Iris and Amanda, two lovelorn women from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, who arrange a [[home exchange]] to escape heartbreak during the [[Christmas and holiday season]]. [[Jude Law]] and [[Jack Black]] were cast as the film's [[Leading man|leading men]] Graham and Miles, with [[Eli Wallach]], [[Shannyn Sossamon]], [[Edward Burns]], and [[Rufus Sewell]] playing key supporting roles.\n\n''The Holiday'' premiered in [[New York City]] on November 29, 2006, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom and United States on December 8, 2006. The film was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]] in North America and by [[Universal Pictures]] overseas. It grossed over $205 million worldwide against a budget of $85 million. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, with critics praising its visual [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] design and the cast's performances, though regarded the plot as predictable.\n\n== Plot ==\nIris Simpkins, a society columnist for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in London, is still madly in love with her ex, Jasper Bloom, despite the fact that he cheated on her and is emotionally needy. Devastated to discover he is engaged, she decides to get away for the holidays.\n\nAmanda Woods, a movie trailer producer in Los Angeles, breaks up with her film composer boyfriend, Ethan, after he admits to cheating on her. Coming across Iris's listing of her cottage on a home swap website, she messages her. They agree to switch houses for two weeks starting the next day.\n\nIris happily settles into Amanda's large house, but Amanda decides she has made a mistake and plans to return home the next day. That night, Iris's handsome book editor brother, Graham, drops by after drinking too much at the local pub, asking to spend the night. Amanda agrees and after they talk Graham unexpectedly kisses her on the lips; she suggests they have sex as she does not expect to see him ever again. The next morning, despite having enjoyed their time together, they go their separate ways. That evening Graham meets friends at the pub for dinner, as he had mentioned to Amanda, and he sees Amanda there, she having decided to stay.\n\nIris meets Arthur Abbott, Amanda's elderly neighbor and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar-winning]] screenwriter from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Film]]. Over dinner, Iris tells him about her troubles with Jasper. He gives her a long list of movies with strong female characters to watch so she can become \"the leading lady of her own life.\"\n\nIris persuades Arthur to be the keynote speaker at a [[Writers Guild of America West]] gala and exercises with him so he can walk on stage without his walker. She also befriends Miles, a colleague of Ethan's who is dating aspiring actress Maggie. While at the video store looking for one of the movies on Arthur's list, he catches Maggie with another man. Iris explains her troubles with Jasper and they have dinner together to bring each other's spirits up on Christmas Eve.\n\nAmanda opens up to Graham, telling him she has not cried since her parents divorced when she was 15. Surprising him at his house, she discovers he is a widower with two young daughters. He kept his daughters a secret because compartmentalizing his life helps him deal with the overwhelming responsibility of being a single working father, and he does not want to bring a woman into the girls' lives unless the relationship definitely has a future. They begin to think their relationship is more complicated than they can handle.\n\nOn the day of the screenwriter's gala, Maggie asks Miles to take her back, but he refuses. Jasper surprises Iris by showing up at Amanda's but, drawing on the example of the women from Arthur's films, she kicks him out. At the gala, Arthur walks onstage unassisted and Miles asks Iris out on a date for New Year's Eve. She agrees and kisses him.\n\nMeanwhile, Graham tells Amanda he has fallen for her and while she says she does not return the sentiment, they agree to try to make a long-distance relationship work. While heading to the airport, Amanda breaks down crying. She runs back to the cottage and she and Graham make plans to spend New Year's Eve together with his daughters.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Iris, Amanda, Miles, and Graham, with his daughters, all happily celebrate at Graham's house.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Kate Winslet]] as Iris Simpkins:  <br /> Iris is a society columnist, writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref name=\"movonl\" /> Winslet was hand-picked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind.
