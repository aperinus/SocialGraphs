The film chronicles the life of Anthony Curtis ([[Larenz Tate]]), focusing on his teenage years as a high school graduate and his experiences during the [[Vietnam War]] as a [[Marine Division Reconnaissance|Recon Marine]]. As he returns to his hometown in [[The Bronx]], Curtis finds himself struggling to support himself and his family, eventually turning to a life of crime.\n\n''Dead Presidents'' is based partly on the real-life experiences of Haywood T. Kirkland (aka Ari S. Merretazon), whose true story was detailed in the book ''Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans '' by [[Wallace Terry]]. Certain characters from the film are based on real acquaintances of Kirkland, who served time in prison after committing robbery in [[facepaint]].<ref name=\"WP\">{{cite web |last=Masters |first=Kim |author-link=Kim Masters |date=October 15, 1995 |title='Dead Presidents' Precedent: The Heist Is Only Half of the Story, Says the Man Who Pulled It Off |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1995/10/15/dead-presidents-precedent/aab9754e-310e-4e3c-a762-2969c0eca92e/ |access-date=July 25, 2022 |website=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> The film also is loosely based on several incidents involving the [[Black Liberation Army]], notably the [[Brink's robbery (1981)|Brink's armored truck robbery]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the North East section of the Bronx, New York during the spring of 1969, Anthony Curtis is about to graduate from high school, and decides to enlist in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] rather than go to college. He is [[Vietnam War|sent to Vietnam]], leaving behind his [[middle-class]] family, his girlfriend Juanita, and small-time crook Kirby, who is like a second father. Anthony's close friend, Skip, later joins Curtis' [[Marine Division Reconnaissance|Recon]] squad after deciding not to go to [[Hunter College]] and his other friend Jose, is drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. Once in Vietnam, Curtis and his squad lose several fellow Marines during combat, and commit several atrocities of their own, such as executing enemy prisoners and beheading corpses for war trophies.\n\nWhen Anthony returns to [[the Bronx]] in 1973, he finds returning to \"normal\" life impossible. He finds Skip now an [[Agent Orange]] victim and [[heroin]] addict, Jose is an [[amputee]] with a prosthetic hand and [[pyromaniac]] who now works as a postman at the [[James A. Farley Building]], and Cleon, a religious but homicidal individual that was his squad\u2019s Staff Sergeant, who is now a devoted minister in [[Mount Vernon, New York]].\n\nAfter being laid off from his job at a butcher shop, Anthony finds himself unable to support Juanita (who had an affair with a pimp while he was on duty) or his daughter. After an argument with Juanita, Anthony meets his girlfriend's sister, Delilah, who is now a member of the \"[[Nat Turner]] Cadre\", a revolutionary communist militant group. Anthony, Kirby, Skip, Jose, Delilah, and Cleon devise a plan to rob an [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] making a stop at the Noble Street [[Federal Reserve Bank]] of the Bronx.\n\nThe next day, the group strategically position themselves around the street, armed with weapons and disguised with face paint, ready to ambush the truck. The plan goes awry when Cleon is approached by a black [[NYPD]] officer (who was also a former Marine) who unknowingly stumbles upon the robbery, leading to Kirby being shot in the arm and Skip killing the officer when Cleon freezes up (a role reversal to what happens to Skip and Cleon earlier). At the same time, Anthony and Jose are spotted by the driver, causing a large shootout with the security guards.\n\nJose (a demolition expert in the army) plants an explosive device on the escaping truck to blow off the door, but instead it destroys the whole vehicle. Delilah saves Anthony's life by killing one of the guards. A second guard appears and gets into a shootout with Delilah; he shoots her multiple times killing her. As the group collects what cash they can from the burning wreckage, they flee and split up to escape the police. Jose gets cornered in an alley by an approaching police car. When Jose shoots the driver, he is hit by the car and killed as the police car crashes into a wall, crushing Jose.\n\nNot long after the heist, Kirby hears that Cleon has been giving out $100 bills and has bought himself a new Cadillac that he can barely afford. Anthony drives over to Cleon's church to speak to him, only to find him being led out the front door in handcuffs by two detectives. Cleon gives up the other robbers as part of a plea bargain due to his remorse in the death of the earlier officer. [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] officers storm Skip's apartment only to find that he has died of a heroin overdose. As Kirby and Anthony prepare to flee to Mexico, police raid the bar. Kirby tries to distract the officers to allow Anthony to flee, but it is to no avail, as multiple officers corner Anthony and arrest him.\n\nAnthony is convicted by a judge. His lawyer asks the court to show mercy, as Anthony served his country faithfully in the Marines and earned a Silver Star. However, the judge was a Marine in [[World War II]], and proclaims that Anthony has forgotten the values that the Marines have taught him and that the Vietnam War wasn't even a real war to begin with and had no purpose, before sentencing him to fifteen years to life. Anthony, furious at his sentence in spite of his years of service, throws a chair at the judge before being escorted away. The film ends with Anthony looking out the window of his prison bus.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Larenz Tate]] as Anthony Curtis \n* [[Keith David]] as Kirby\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Skip\n* [[Bokeem Woodbine]] as Cleon\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodr\u00edguez]] as Jose \"Joe\"\n* Rose Jackson as Juanita Benson\n* [[N'Bushe Wright]] as Delilah Benson\n* [[Alvaleta Guess]] as Mrs. Benson\n* [[James Pickens Jr.]] as Mr. Curtis\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Mrs. Curtis\n* [[Michael Imperioli]] as D'Ambrosio\n* [[Clifton Powell]] as \"Cutty\"\n* [[Elizabeth Rodriguez]] as Marisol\n* [[Terrence Howard]] as \"Cowboy\"\n* [[Jaimz Woolvett]] as Lieutenant Dugan \n* [[Tony Sirico]] as Officer Spinelli\n* [[Robert LuPone]] as Attorney Salvatore Rizzo\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as The Judge (''uncredited'')\n}}\n\n== Themes ==\nThe film depicts the struggle of returning war veterans of color who are neglected by the US government and the mistreatment of Vietnam veterans.
