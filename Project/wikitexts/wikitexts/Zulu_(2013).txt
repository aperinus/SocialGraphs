Fleeing his father's murderers and on the run, a police dog hunts down Ali, leading to him being rendered a eunuch with active support of one of three white South African policemen.\n\nIn present day, Ali is a homicide detective of the [[South African Police Service|South African Police]], partnered with fellow detectives Brian Epkeen (Orlando Bloom) and Dan Fletcher (Conrad Kemp). The men are called to investigate the murder of Judith Botha, a young woman found in the local Botanical Gardens, only to uncover that Judith was alive and her best friend Nicole Weiss is the victim, however who was found with Judith\u2019s ID. She had been beaten to death. While interviewed, Judith claims that Nicole previously spent the evening with her boyfriend. Ali encounters two young boys violently fighting, both flee after Ali defuses the fight. Ali finds a white substance at the scene, a new form of [[Cannabis (drug)|toke]], a psychologically manipulating drug with severe effects depending on dosage, as well as other factors. Meanwhile, Brian is revealed to be in the process of divorce from his Ruby, his ex-wife, whom he had betrayed, in turn leading to her engaging with a rich dentist. Brian's teenage son David also grew distant from him. Brian lives a bachelor lifestyle, seems always broke, and is a functioning alcoholic.\n\nAli confronts exotic dancer Zina at her club \"Sundance\", who identifies Nicole's boyfriend as Stan Kwalana, a local drug dealer. At the same time, the department secretary Janet traces Nicole's phone to Muizenberg Beach. Upon arriving, Ali, Brian and Dan are attacked by a band of criminals, who proceed to mortally wound Dan with a machete, though Ali and Brian kill the remnants; Dan later dies in hospital, leaving his wife Claire grief stricken. Following Dan's funeral, Ali is assigned by CTPD Captain Paul Kruger to investigate Cat, a crime lord with connections to Dan's killers. Cat denies knowledge of the crime, however is later revealed to be the distributor of the toke and Stan, having overdosed on the drug had unintentionally killed Nicole in a fit of blind rage, was his unwilling accomplice.\n\nThe following day, another woman, Kate Montgomery, is found dead in the same fashion as Nicole on Long Island Beach; Ali and Brian uncover the Zulu warrior message \"Bazukala\" carved upon her chest. Later that same day, Stan's severed head is recovered. Ali and Brian once again confront Cat. Surprisingly, the surviving criminals from Muizenberg Beach attack Cat's hideout, killing several of his men. Ali and Brian pursue the criminals, but they are killed by Cat's thugs and Ali is wounded during the pursuit. Brian returns to the precinct and uncovers that Stan has, in the meanwhile, been labelled as Nicole's and Kate's killer, but Brian refuses to believe the case is closed. Following a lead, Brian runs into local ranger Tara, who reveals she saw a black jeep parked outside Muizenberg Beach at the time of Dan's murder.\n\nWithout support of the CTPD, Brian and Janet privately continue to investigate together, uncovering the identity of Doctor Joost Opperman, a former scientist of \"Project Coast\", which intended to unleash [[Biological agent|biological weaponry]] to be used against the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. Many scientists had also vowed to eradicate the [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|black population]] of South Africa, claiming they were simply following orders. Brian suspects Opperman had invented the toke to achieve the renewed goal of decimating the black population. Aware of their connections to Project Coast, Brian infiltrates the headquarters of the DPS, a [[Private army|private militia]] headed by Frank De Beer; Brian labels one of the vehicles as the same one found at Muizenberg Beach the day of Dan's death, confirming their involvement with Opperman. Later that day, Josephine, Ali's mother, is murdered in her home by Cat, having been informed of the investigation by Ali and, unwittingly, following the hottest lead regarding how the toke was distributed among the population in the township. Upon hearing of his mother's death, Ali learns from Cat's mistress that Cat retreated to the [[Namib desert|Namib Desert]] with Opperman; fuelled with rage, Ali flies to [[Namibia]] to hunt down Cat.\n\nUpon gathering the evidence to prosecute Opperman, Brian received word that Ruby and her husband Rick had been taken captive by De Beer, demanding Brian relinquish the evidence in exchange for their lives. Upon arriving, Brian is captured and beaten. Rick shows his character, attempting to bribe his own freedom, but gets shot by De Beer. After De Beer departs for Namibia, Brian breaks free and kills the resident agent, saving Ruby; the evidence confirms that De Beer murdered Kate, who actually overdosed the toke while hanging out with Stan; Cat later kills Stan. Ali and Brian arrive outside Oppermn's headquarters in the Namib Desert, where a revenge shootout happens; Brian captures and arrests De Beer, and Ali shotguns Cat, but his wound opens again in the process. Opperman flees across the desert, Ali pursues him on feet until morning; both men lead each other to exhaustion. Upon capturing him, Ali bludgeons Opperman to death, before succumbing to his wound and dying. Brian arrives on the scene, searching for Ali with a helicopter, but can only recover Ali's body.\n\nUpon returning to Cape Town, Brian buries Ali and has his father's tombstone repaired, pointing to a possible father issue of Brian.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Orlando Bloom]] as Brian Epkeen\n* [[Forest Whitaker]] as Ali Sokhela\n* [[Tanya van Graan]] as Tara\n* Natasha Loring as Marjorie\n* Sven Ruygrok as David Epkeen\n* Adrian Galley as Nils Botha\n* Conrad Kemp as Dan Fletcher\n* Roxanne Prentice as Judith Botha\n* [[Tinarie Van Wyk-Loots]] as Claire Fletcher\n* Dean Slater as Rick\n* Kelsey Egan as Nicole Weiss\n* [[Khulu Skenjana]] as Themba\n* [[Hennie Bosman]] as Shaved Head\n* [[Joelle Kayembe]] as Zina\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] on 26 May as the closing night film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/global/zulu-to-close-cannes-film-festival-1200353633/|title='Zulu' to Close Cannes Film Festival|first=Elsa|last=Keslassy|date=12 April 2013|access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref> It later opened in France on 4 December 2013.
