It is produced by [[Syncopy Inc.]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]] Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Fionn Whitehead]], [[Tom Glynn-Carney]], [[Jack Lowden]], [[Harry Styles]] in his film debut, [[Aneurin Barnard]], [[James D'Arcy]], [[Barry Keoghan]], [[Kenneth Branagh]], [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Mark Rylance]], and [[Tom Hardy]].\n\n''Dunkirk'' portrays the evacuation with little dialogue, as Christopher Nolan sought instead to create suspense from [[cinematography]] and [[Film score|music]]. Filming began in May 2016 in [[Dunkirk]] and ended that September in [[Los Angeles]], when [[post-production]] began. Cinematographer [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] shot the film on [[IMAX]] [[65 mm]] and 65&nbsp;mm [[large format|large-format]] [[film stock]]. ''Dunkirk'' has extensive [[practical effect]]s, and employed thousands of extras as well as historic boats from the evacuation, and period aeroplanes.\n\nDistributed by [[Warner Bros.]], the film premiered on 13 July 2017 at [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in [[London]], and was released in the United Kingdom and United States on 21 July. It is the highest-grossing World War II film, making $527 million worldwide. ''Dunkirk'' received praise for its screenplay, direction, musical score, sound effects, and cinematography; some critics called it Nolan's best work, and one of the greatest war films. The film received [[List of accolades received by Dunkirk|various accolades]], including eight nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Nolan's first directing Oscar nomination); it went on to win for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1940, during the [[Battle of France]], [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers have retreated to [[Dunkirk]]. Tommy Jensen, a young British private, is the sole survivor of a [[Nazi Germany|German]] ambush. At the beach, he finds thousands of troops awaiting evacuation and meets Gibson, an aloof soldier who is burying a body. After a [[Luftwaffe]] [[dive bomber]] attack, they attempt to get aboard a hospital ship but are ordered off. The ship is sunk by dive bombers; Tommy saves Alex, another soldier.\n\nWith a single, vulnerable [[Mole (architecture)|mole]] available for embarking on deep-[[Draft (hull)|draft]] ships, the [[Royal Navy]] requisitions civilian vessels in Great Britain that can get to the beach. In [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], a civilian sailor Dawson, with his son Peter, sets out on his boat ''Moonstone'', rather than let the Navy commandeer her. Their teenage hand George impulsively joins them. At sea, they rescue a shivering [[Shell shock|shell-shocked]] soldier from a wrecked ship. When he realises that Dawson is sailing for Dunkirk, the soldier demands that they turn back and tries to wrest control of the boat; in the scuffle, George suffers a head injury that renders him blind. Elsewhere, three [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], tasked with defending the evacuation, cross the English Channel. After their leader is shot down in a [[dogfight]], one of the pilots, Farrier, assumes command, but the other Spitfire is hit and [[Water landing|ditches]]. Its pilot, Collins, is rescued by ''Moonstone''.\n\nTommy, Alex and Gibson are picked up by a British [[destroyer]], but it is sunk by a [[torpedo]] en route to Britain; Gibson narrowly saves Tommy and Alex from drowning, and the three are forced to return to Dunkirk. Later, the three join some soldiers of a [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Highlanders regiment]] and hide inside a beached trawler in the [[intertidal zone]] outside the Allied perimeter, waiting for the rising tide to refloat it. During the wait, German troops start shooting at the boat for target practice, and water enters through the bullet holes. Alex, hoping to lighten the boat, accuses Gibson, who has stayed silent, of being a German spy. Gibson reveals he is French; he stole the identity of the dead British soldier he buried, hoping to be evacuated with the British. The group abandons the boat when it begins to sink, but Gibson is entangled in a chain and drowns. When a nearby [[minesweeper]] is sunk by a bomber, ''Moonstone'' manoeuvres to take on those in the water, including Tommy and Alex. Peter discovers that George is dead. Asked by the shell-shocked soldier, he lies and says that George will be fine.\n\nFarrier reaches Dunkirk just as his fuel runs out. Gliding over the beach, he shoots down a dive-bomber, saving ships and troops, and lands beyond the perimeter. He sets fire to his plane before being taken [[Prisoner of war|prisoner]] by the Germans. In all, over 300,000 men are evacuated. Royal Navy Commander Bolton stays to oversee the evacuation of the French. Arriving back in Weymouth, the shell-shocked soldier sees George's body being carried away. Peter arranges for a local reporter to publish a story about George's role in the evacuation, calling George a hero, which he shows to his father the next day. Tommy and Alex board a train and receive a hero's welcome when the train arrives in [[Woking]]. Tommy reads [[We shall fight on the beaches|Churchill's address]] to the House of Commons citing the \"miracle of deliverance\" in Dunkirk.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Fionn Whitehead]] as Tommy Jensen\n* [[Tom Glynn-Carney]] as Peter Dawson\n* [[Jack Lowden]] as Collins (Fortis 2)\n* [[Harry Styles]] as Alex\n* [[Aneurin Barnard]] as Gibson\n* [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] Winnant\n* [[Barry Keoghan]] as George Mills\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] Bolton\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Shivering Soldier\n* [[Mark Rylance]] as Mr. Dawson\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as Farrier (Fortis 1)\n* [[Michael Caine]] as Fortis Leader (uncredited). \n* [[Elliott Tittensor]] as Highlander 2\n* [[Will Attenborough]] as Second Lieutenant \n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=\"The empathy for the characters has nothing to do with their story.

As the original heavy wool fabric had not been produced since 1940, it was made from scratch, tailored for the main cast and over a thousand extras. Uniforms were made in a factory in Pakistan and the boots by a shoemaker in Mexico. The costume department then spent three weeks ageing them at [[Longcross Studios]]. Each garment was made to look distinct in regiment and personality: Tommy wears a large [[greatcoat]], while Alex dons the Highlander cut. Kurland found references at museums, in contemporary magazines, photo archives, and books. The mole was rebuilt over four months from the original blueprints.{{#tag:ref|The construction came at a cost of $900,000.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporter-Jan2018\" />|group=nb}} Sand was brought from Dunkirk to create make-up consistent with the environment.

It accurately depicts a few [[Royal Air Force]] aeroplanes dogfighting the Luftwaffe over the sea, limited to one hour of operation by their fuel capacity. The combat however is portrayed at much lower altitude than the reality. In 1940, destroyers and fighter aircraft were indeed held back from battle, as the Royal Navy and Air Force would have been the sole defenders against invasion. There was indeed a temporary withdrawal of destroyers during the early stages after considerable losses; however, an appeal to the Admiralty by Admiral Ramsay reversed that decision. Also noted were the accurate depictions of how a small boat attempted to evade aerial attack, and of how soldiers returning to England saw a civilian population largely unaware of or unaffected by the war.<ref name=\"Broich-2017\" /><ref name=\"Montefiore-2017\" /> British officers did initially refuse to evacuate French soldiers, although Churchill later insisted that the French be evacuated alongside the British.<ref name=\"Broich-2017\" /> The realism of the film was acknowledged by Dunkirk veterans, although Branagh said that some thought it was \"louder than the battle\".<ref name=\"Mosbergen-2017\" />\n\n[[File:Hispano HA.1112M1L Buchon 'Black 2' (G-AWHK) (36053481566).jpg|thumb|200px|Hispano Buchon masquerading as a Bf 109E, wearing a temporary paint scheme for the film<ref name=\"WarbirdsNews-2016\" />]]\n\nAlthough some events are based on true history, the characters and the storyline are fictional; Branagh's role is a [[composite character]].<ref name=\"Alexander-2017\" /> When the beach scenes were shot, the weather was worse than during the real evacuation; Nolan explained that this helped to understand the danger faced by the [[pleasure boats]].<ref name=\"Savignac-2017\" /> In one scene, a non-commissioned officer gives a salute without wearing his [[military beret]], which a veteran pointed out as inaccurate protocol.<ref name=\"TheJournal-2017\" /> To differentiate the German aeroplanes, their noses were painted yellow; this was not actually done until a month after Dunkirk. Contemporary shots were used for aerial views of the town, whereas Dunkirk was in ruins by the time of the evacuation.
