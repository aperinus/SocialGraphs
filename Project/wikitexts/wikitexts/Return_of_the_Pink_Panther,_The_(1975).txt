This film replaced Sellers with [[Alan Arkin]] in the title role and did not involve Blake Edwards. --> in ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' series. The film stars [[Peter Sellers]] returning to the role of [[Inspector Clouseau]] for the first time since ''[[A Shot in the Dark (1964 film)|A Shot in the Dark]]'' (1964), after having declined to reprise the role in ''[[Inspector Clouseau (film)|Inspector Clouseau]]'' (1968). The film was a commercial hit and revived the previously dormant series and with it Peter Sellers' career.\n\n[[Herbert Lom]] reprises his role as Chief Inspector [[List of The Pink Panther characters|Charles Dreyfus]] from ''A Shot in the Dark''; he remained a regular thereafter. The character of Sir Charles Litton, the notorious Phantom, is played by [[Christopher Plummer]]. [[David Niven]], who played the part in ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (1963), was unavailable. The Pink Panther diamond once again plays a central role in the plot.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the fictional country of Lugash, a mysterious thief seizes the Pink Panther diamond and leaves a white glove embroidered with a gold \"P\". With its national treasure once again missing, the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of [[Inspector Clouseau]] ([[Peter Sellers]]) of the [[S\u00fbret\u00e9]], as Clouseau had recovered the diamond the last time it was stolen (in [[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]). Clouseau has been temporarily demoted to beat cop by his boss, Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus ([[Herbert Lom]]), who despises him to the point of obsession, but the [[Government of France|French government]] forces Dreyfus to reinstate him. Clouseau joyously receives the news and duly departs for Lugash, but not before fending off a surprise attack from his servant Cato ([[Burt Kwouk]]), who had been ordered to do so to keep the Inspector on his toes.\n\nUpon examining the crime scene in the national museum \u2014 in which, due to his habitual clumsiness, he wrecks several priceless antiques \u2014 Clouseau concludes that the glove implicates Sir Charles Litton ([[Christopher Plummer]]), alias \"the notorious Phantom,\" as the thief. After several catastrophic failures to stake out Litton Manor in [[Nice]], Clouseau believes a mysterious assassin is attempting to kill him. He follows Sir Charles' wife, Lady Claudine Litton ([[Catherine Schell]]), to the [[Gstaad Palace]] hotel in [[Switzerland]] in search of clues to her husband's whereabouts, and repeatedly bungles the investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Charles is teased about the theft by his wife, and realizes he has been framed. Arriving in Lugash to clear his name, Sir Charles barely avoids being murdered and sent to the Lugash secret police by his associate known as the \"Fat Man\" ([[Eric Pohlmann]]), who explains that with the leading suspect dead, the secret police will no longer have an excuse to continue purging their political enemies. Escaping to his suite, Litton finds secret police Colonel Sharki ([[Peter Arne]]) waiting for him, who implies the Fat Man's understanding is correct, but reminds him the diamond must be recovered eventually. Sir Charles pretends to cooperate, but is unable to hide his reaction when he recognizes a face on the museum's security footage. He avoids another plot by the Fat Man and his duplicitous underling Pepi ([[Graham Stark]]) and escapes from Lugash, secretly pursued by Sharki, who believes Sir Charles will lead him to the diamond.\n\nIn [[Gstaad]], Clouseau, still tailing Lady Claudine, is suddenly ordered by Dreyfus over the telephone to arrest her in her hotel room. However, when Clouseau calls back to clarify the order, he is told that Dreyfus is on vacation. Sir Charles, who in the meantime has chartered a private flight out of Lugash, arrives at the hotel and is first to confront his wife. Lady Claudine admits she stole the jewel to spark excitement in their lives. Colonel Sharki shows up, but just as he prepares to kill them both, Inspector Clouseau barges in. Sir Charles explains things to Clouseau, and Sharki is about to kill the three of them. However, Dreyfus has followed Clouseau and is outside the hotel room with a rifle \u2014 Dreyfus is in fact the \"mysterious assassin\" who has been trying to kill Clouseau all this time \u2014  and just as Dreyfus shoots at Clouseau, the Inspector ducks to check if his fly is undone, and the shot kills Sharki instead. The other three take cover, while Dreyfus, insanely enraged by his latest failure to kill Clouseau, goes berserk until he is arrested.\n\nFor once again recovering the Pink Panther, Clouseau is promoted to Chief Inspector, while Sir Charles resumes his career as a jewel thief. At a [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese restaurant]] in the epilogue, Cato unexpectedly attacks Clouseau again and triggers a massive brawl, destroying the premises. Dreyfus is committed to a lunatic asylum for his actions, where he is straitjacketed inside a padded cell and vows revenge on Clouseau. The film ends when the Pink Panther (in cartoon form) enters Dreyfus' cell and films him writing \"The End\" on the wall with his foot.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as [[Inspector Jacques Clouseau]]\n* [[Catherine Schell]] as Lady Claudine Litton\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Sir Charles Litton\n* [[Peter Arne]] as Colonel Sharki\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Maranne]] as Fran\u00e7ois\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire Aslan]] as Chief of Lugash Police\n* [[David Lodge (actor)|David Lodge]] as Mac\n* [[Burt Kwouk]] as Cato Fong\n* [[Graham Stark]] as Pepi\n* [[Mike Grady (actor)|Mike Grady]] as Bell Boy\n* [[Peter Jeffrey]] as General Wadafi\n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] as The Fat Man \n* [[Victor Spinetti]] as Hotel Concierge\n* [[John Bluthal]] as Blind Beggar\n* [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]] as Psychiatrist\n}}\n\n== Production ==\nIn the early 1970s, Blake Edwards wrote a 15\u201320 page outline for another ''Pink Panther'' film and presented it to series producer [[Walter Mirisch]]. The producer loved the idea, but the franchise's distributor and main backer, [[United Artists]], rejected the film as they had no interest in working with Edwards nor Peter Sellers, whose careers had declined.<ref name=\"walter\"/>\n\nBritish producer [[Lew Grade]] agreed to finance two films for Blake Edwards as part of a deal to get Edwards' wife, [[Julie Andrews]], to appear in a TV special for him. The first movie was ''[[The Tamarind Seed]]''. Edwards wanted to make a project set in Canada called ''Rachel and the Stranger,'' but Grade disliked the idea and offered to buy Edwards out of the second commitment. Edwards wanted to make a second movie, however; in order to help restore his tainted reputation in Hollywood. Grade said he then suggested making a new Pink Panther film and Edwards agreed, if Sellers would also agree to do it. Grade managed to talk Sellers into it and the project was on.<ref name=\"grade\">Lew Grade, ''Still Dancing: My Story'', William Collins & Sons 1987 p 227\u2013228</ref> UA agreed to give ''The Return of the Pink Panther'' to Grade in exchange for world distribution and a share of the profits;<ref name=\"walter\">Mirisch, Walter (2008).

Williams got help animating this from two noted animators, [[Ken Harris]] and [[Art Babbitt]].\n\n[[Carol Cleveland]], best known for her regular appearances on ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', has a small part as a swimming pool diver.\n\nA [[soundtrack album]], featuring [[Henry Mancini]]'s score for the film, was released by [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Henry-Mancini-Blake-Edwards-The-Return-Of-The-Pink-Panther/release/7329460|title = Henry Mancini \u2013 Blake Edwards' the Return of the Pink Panther (1975, Vinyl)|website = [[Discogs]]}}</ref> A novelization, written by the film's co-writer, Frank Waldman, was belatedly published by [[Ballantine Books]] in March 1977 ({{ISBN|0345251237}}).{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical reception ===\nIn ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] gave the film a positive review, writing, \"Clouseau is the very special slapstick triumph of Mr. Sellers and Mr. Edwards.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |author-link=Vincent Canby |date=May 22, 1975 |title=Distraction Stalks Inspector Clouseau |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E3D9113FE53BBC4A51DFB366838E669EDE |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=32 }}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"another very funny film about the eternal gumshoe bungler, Inspector Clouseau.

Reputedly, the film shows Schell attempting to stifle laughter at Sellers's performance in many of her scenes. Schell has maintained in interviews that she considered it in character for Lady Lytton to be amused by Clouseau, whom she does not see as a serious threat. Schell appeared with Sellers again in ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1979 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1979), one of his last films.\n\n== Home media release ==\nThe film had been released on VHS, Betamax, [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]] and Laserdisc in the 1980s by [[Magnetic Video]], [[CBS/Fox Video]], and [[J2 Communications]] respectively.\n\nIn 1993 and 1996, [[Artisan Entertainment|LIVE Home Video]] under the Family Home Entertainment label re-released the film on VHS as part of the Family Home Entertainment Theater lineup and on a Widescreen Laserdisc. In 1999, [[Artisan Entertainment]] (LIVE's successor) re-released the film on VHS and debuting on DVD for the first time in the original widescreen format. The only bonus material seen on this release were cast filmographies, production notes and the film's original theatrical trailer.\n\nIn 2006, rights holder Granada (owners of the ITC catalog) sub licensed the film to [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment|Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] under [[Focus Features]] for distribution in the US and UK, with a new, bare-bones release featuring an anamorphic widescreen transfer being released in 2006 by Universal in both territories. In 2015, the 2006 UK DVD was reissued by Fabulous Films still under licence from Universal and ITV Studios (who acquired Granada and the ITC library), followed by a UK Blu-ray release by Fabulous in 2016.\n\nAs [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] has since acquired US theatrical rights, along with worldwide television and digital distribution rights,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/posts/4260687/|title=Official KINO Insider Announcements Thread: STRICTLY MODERATED: READ GUIDELINES}}</ref> Universal/Focus and ITV still have all remaining worldwide rights for the film.
