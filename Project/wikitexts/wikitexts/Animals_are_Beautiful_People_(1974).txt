It was filmed in the [[Namib Desert]], the [[Kalahari Desert]] and the [[Okavango River]] and [[Okavango Delta]]. It was the recipient of the 1974 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Animals Are Beautiful People|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/film/animals-are-beautiful-people|website=GoldenGlobes.com|publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]|access-date=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film, a critical and commercial success, was independently made by Uys, also known for his later African comedy ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'' (1980).\n\n==General description==\n\nThe film begins in the Namib desert, with the narrator saying: \"You'd think nobody could make a living here.\" But the film proves the opposite and shows the lives of the animals that live there.\nThe narrator concludes: \"But to the [[Oryx]] and the little creatures of the Namib, this waterless, hostile desert is paradise.\"\n\nThe second third of the film shows the rich life in the [[Okavango River]] and [[Okavango Delta]] (see [[#Marula|Marula]], below), and the last third of the film focuses on life in the Kalahari desert.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\nOne scene depicts [[baboon]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[warthog]]s and other African animals eating rotten, fermented fruit of the [[Sclerocarya birrea|Marula]] tree. The animals are then intoxicated, and they stagger around to comic effect, before nightfall comes and they fall asleep. In the morning, we see one baboon wake up, disheveled, next to a warthog, and quietly exit the burrow, as not to wake her. Some experts have claimed that some scenes were likely staged; elephants would be too large, for example, and drink too much water (diluting the alcohol) to get intoxicated.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Morris |author2=David Humphreys |author3=Dan Reynolds |title=Myth, marula, and elephant: an assessment of voluntary ethanol intoxication of the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) following feeding on the fruit of the marula tree (Sclerocarya birrea) |journal=[[Physiological and Biochemical Zoology]] |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=363\u20139 |year=2006 |pmid=16555195 |doi=10.1086/499983 |s2cid=36629801 }}</ref>\n\n==Classical music==\n\nThe film uses [[classical music]] and especially well-known pieces to support a scene.
