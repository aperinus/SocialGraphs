The film was directed by [[Julie Anne Robinson]] in her [[List of directorial debuts|feature film directorial debut]] and co-written by Sparks and Jeff Van Wie. ''The Last Song'' stars [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Liam Hemsworth]], and [[Greg Kinnear]], and follows a troubled teenager as she reconnects with her estranged father and falls in love during a summer in a quiet Southern United States beach town.\n\nSparks was approached to write both the film's screenplay and the novel. Sparks completed the screenplay in January 2009, prior to the completion of the novel, making ''The Last Song'' his first script to be optioned for film. The setting, originally in [[North Carolina]] like the novel, relocated to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] after the states had campaigned for months to host production. Upon beginning production in [[Tybee Island, Georgia]], and nearby [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], ''The Last Song'' became the first movie to be both filmed and set in Tybee Island. Filming lasted from June 15 to August 18, 2009, with much of it occurring on the island's beach and pier.\n\n''The Last Song'' was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]] on March 31, 2010, and was later released on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD on August 17, 2010. The film garnered negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing the script and Cyrus's performance, who felt she was miscast in the role. In spite of this, it grossed $89 million worldwide against a $20 million budget making it a box office success.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|section|date=October 2022}}\nAt 17, Veronica \"Ronnie\" Miller remains as rebellious as she was the day her parents divorced and her father moved to Georgia three years prior. She had been caught shoplifting in [[New York City]], where she lives. Once a classical piano child prodigy under her father, Steve Miller, Ronnie now ignores the instrument in and has not spoken with him since he left. [[Juilliard School]] has been interested in her since she was young, but she refuses to attend as she resents her father.\n\nKim Miller sends the teen and her younger brother, Jonah to spend the summer with Steve in Georgia and reconnect. A former Juilliard School professor and concert pianist, Steve lives a quiet life in Wrightsville Beach, the small town in Georgia where he grew up, working on a [[stained-glass]] [[window]] for the local church to replace the one the church lost in a fire. Locals believe Steve had (accidentally) set fire to the church one night.\n\nAfter arrival, Ronnie is miserable, defiant, and defensive toward all those around her, including handsome, popular Will Blakelee. They meet when he crashes into her during a volleyball match, spilling Ronnie's shake all over her. She shrugs him off and meets Blaze, an outcast who lives with her boyfriend Marcus. With them at a beach campfire, Marcus hits on Ronnie and Blaze mistakenly thinks it's the other way around. As revenge, Blaze later gets Ronnie arrested for shoplifting.\n\nLater on, Ronnie discovers a [[loggerhead sea turtle]] nest at the beach by her dad's, and while protecting it from raccoons, she meets Will again as he is an aquarium volunteer. After a night of staying up to defend the turtle eggs from predators with Will, she discovers he is deeper than she expected, and they connect.\n\nThe next day, Will takes Ronnie to the aquarium. Later, on the beach, Ashley tells Ronnie about Will's past relationships and going to the aquarium is part of his routine. Doubting Will, he finds her at the turtle's nest and they argue about his past. When Ronnie says she does not want to be just another girl and they should end it, Will embraces her and they kiss passionately, becoming a couple. \n\nWill takes Ronnie to his home under the impression that his parents are not home. Ronnie finds out that Will is rich after seeing he lives in a large, gated mansion. Ronnie ends up meeting Will\u2019s parents due to them returning home earlier than expected. The pair then have an awkward dinner with Will\u2019s parents. It is revealed that Will had a brother that passed away the previous year. Will and Ronnie profess their love for each other, with Ronnie revealing that she is a talented piano player. \n\nDuring Will\u2019s volleyball game, Ronnie soon hears the rumor that her father burned down the church from some locals, but ignores it. Ronnie is finally invited to Will\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding after being upset over not being told about the wedding by Will. She then meets her father in the burnt church to show him the invitation where they talk about what caused the fire. Distraught about what information her father disclosed, she goes to Will and laments about it. While working, Will speaks with Scott about telling the truth about what happened to the church, with Scott refusing. \n\nRonnie is preparing to go dress shopping when she sees Marcus breaking up with Blaze and leaving her essentially homeless. Ronnie then leaves all the money given to her by Steve, which causes Jonah to help her pay for her dress, which he also helps her pick out. The wedding day arrives, with Ronnie and Will enjoying themselves amongst other guest. Ronnie sees Blaze, who thanks her and tells her that she has left Marcus and moved back in with her mother. Marcus suddenly arrives and causes issues at the wedding. Will ends up attacking him after he insults Ronnie. \n\nWhen Will and Ronnie arrive back at Steve\u2019s home, Jonah excitedly tells them that Steve believes the turtle eggs will hatch. As they are watching the eggs hatch, Steve collapses and has to be brought to the hospital, revealing that he has terminal cancer that has spread to his lungs and that was the reason for Ronnie and Jonah\u2019s presence for the summer. \n\nRonnie spends time with Steve in the hospital while Jonah and Will continue to work on the stain glass window. Steve\u2019s cancer news progressively gets worse and he eventually requests to be returned home, as he does not want to die at the hospital. Will and Jonah finished the window and took Steve by to view it being placed in the church. Beginning the feel more pressure and discomfort from knowing that truth about the church burning, Will asks Scott one more time to tell the truth, to which Scott agreed. \n\nScott and Will came to Steve\u2019s home and finally told the truth: Scott, Will, and other friends were behind the church horse playing when Marcus and his friends showed up. Will then left, while Scott stayed with Marcus and his friends, who then began to play with fire, causing the church to catch fire. Scott allowed Steve to take the blame, but Will wanted to report the crime to the police, but did not due to his friendship with Scott. Steve did not want this to be reported to the police and was fine with taking the blame. Ronnie overhears this and breaks up with Will. \n\nKim arrives after learning the kids know of Steve\u2019s condition. Jonah and Steve has a tearful moment before Jonah goes home to New York for the school year while Ronnie stays to take care of their father. Leading a slow life, she tries to make up for the time lost with her father. She continues working on his composition for him (titled \"For Ronnie\"), as his hands are painful due to his illness. As he is sitting on the couch listening to her play, he dies just as she finishes.\n\nAt his funeral, she declares that no words could ever be able to show how wonderful her father really was. Instead, she decides to share with them the song she helped finish. Before sitting down to play, sunlight shines through the stained-glass window. Ronnie smiles and says \"Hi, Daddy,\" remembering her father saying that whenever light shines through the window, it is him.\n\nBlaze and other townsfolk offer their condolences after the funeral outside, Will included. He says that he liked the song she played and that he knows her dad did, too, disappearing in the crowd. Having decided to attend Juilliard, Ronnie is packing up to return to New York when she sees Will standing outside. He apologizes to her for everything that had happened, surprising Ronnie by revealing that he will be transferring to [[Columbia University]] to be with her and they passionately kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:BarnettLashawayChaikin.jpg|thumb|right|225px|From left to right, cast members Adam Barnett, Nick Lashaway, and Carly Chaikin make their way to the filming of the bonfire scene under the Tybee Island pavilion on July 30, 2009]]\n* [[Miley Cyrus]] as Veronica \"Ronnie\" L.
