He is propositioned by his friend and former partner-in-crime, Billy Norton, to live in a nice \"acquired\" apartment, but on condition he work for Billy's criminal boss. On his way to a \"welcome back\" party, Mitchel saves a woman, Penny, from being mugged.\n\nAt the party, Billy propositions Mitchel again. Mitchel is told by Billy and their contact, Danny, that his sister, Briony, is in the basement, and he \"saves\" her from being raped by a drug addict.  Mitchel meets Penny for a drink elsewhere, and she offers him a job to help her friend, a reclusive famous \"retired\" young actress, Charlotte.\n\nMitchel goes to a railway station to visit his friend Joe, a blind homeless [[Big Issue]] salesman and gives him a knife to protect himself. The next day, Mitchel meets Charlotte and her friend, Jordan. Charlotte is constantly hounded by the paparazzi perpetually stationed outside her home, taunting and photographing anyone who enters or leaves.\n\nMitchel is offered the job to \"assist\" and Jordan gives him a tour of the mansion, including a collection of paintings that look like [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]'s [[Study after Vel\u00e1zquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X|studies on Velazquez screaming Popes]] and a garage full of Charlotte's ex-husband Tim's cars. At his apartment, corrupt police Detective Bailey visits Mitchel and tells him to avoid Billy and forces a small bribe from Mitchel.\n\nMitchel talks to Billy about Detective Bailey, whom Billy cannot stand. Joe is mugged, then brutally beaten by two 16 year old footballers from the estate and left for dead; and one of the boys takes Joe's knife. At the hospital, Dr Sanji Raju lets Mitchel visit Joe, who wants Mitchel to avenge his death.\n\nThe next day, Billy tells Mitchel that he knows about the car collection and that his boss wants to steal them. At Joe's funeral, Dr Raju tells Mitchel that he wants to date Briony, which Mitchel accepts. Mitchel goes to the pub and asks Danny to find out as much as he can about the two footballers. That night, Mitchel is kidnapped by Billy and taken to his boss, Rob Gant, who insists that Mitchel collect money for him.\n\nCharlotte and Mitchel escape from the paparazzi to her mansion in the countryside. Charlotte mentions to Mitchel that something happened to her in Italy, which is implied to be a drug overdose. Jordan reveals to Mitchel that in this incident she was raped by a drug addict, who never got caught but is currently on life support after overdosing on [[quaaludes]], administered by Jordan.\n\nGant threatens Detective Bailey to stop him making Mitchel pay bribes. Later that evening, Mitchel and Billy meet Gant in a garage, where Gant shoots a black man, whom Gant was led to believe by Billy to be one of the [[Nation of Islam]] members who beat up Mitchel and scared off Billy while earlier collecting for Gant. Gant yells at Billy, but Mitchel protects Billy and yells at Gant, who claims Mitchel said to kill anyone. Gant tells Mitchel he is now an 'accessory' to the killing, and to meet him at [[Criterion Restaurant]] the next night, for an unknown arrangement.\n\nCharlotte tells Mitchel she loves him. Later, Mitchel and Gant meet and Gant assigns Mitchel to collect money in [[Streatham]], [[Clapham]] and [[Kennington]]. Gant reveals that the main mugger footballer has a future and is being scouted by professional teams, and implies that Mitchel had best leave him alone.\n\nMitchel tells Gant that if he ''were'' a gangster, Gant would be the first person he would kill and would take everything Gant has, but claims he is not a gangster and walks away. Gant, to put Mitchel in trouble, waylays the doctor who owns Mitchel's apartment and after Gant rapes him, he orders his henchmen, Fletcher and Beaumont to kill him. Mitchel learns who the footballer is and follows him into a tunnel, planning to shoot him, but has a change of heart at the last moment, and lets the young man walk away unaware.\n\nMitchel visits Charlotte and tells her that he loves her; the two sleep together. Mitchel sees Billy's van and attacks Billy, who says that Gant sent him to kill Mitchel; he warns Mitchel to look for \"a big Bosnian fucker\". Mitchel borrows one of Charlotte's husband's [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls Royce]]s and confronts Billy at a pub. He beats Billy, who says Gant will kill everyone whom Mitchel loves, and Mitchel steals the money Billy collected for Gant.\n\nMitchel meets his sister at a restaurant to persuade her to get out of the country and out of Gant's reach. He gives her a train ticket and money, but she ignores the warning, resulting in her and Dr. Raju being killed by Gant. Mitchel and Jordan find Billy's dead body in the front garden of Charlotte's home and the Bosnian, named Storbor, lurking outside the gate.\n\nMitchel asks Jordan to help him kill Storbor and the two follow Storbor to a nightclub where they meet him and the drug addict from the party named Whiteboy. Mitchel kills Gant and it looks to be a happy ending. But when Mitchel walks out to the street on his way to go to America, the young kid he let live stabs him several times in the side and leaves him to die.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Harry Mitchel, an ex convict<ref name=london/><ref name=trio/>\n* [[Keira Knightley]] as Charlotte, a reclusive young actress<ref name=london/><ref name=trio/>\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Jordan, Charlotte's [[agoraphobic]] business manager, who soon befriends Mitchel and helps him out during the film.<ref name=trio/>\n* [[Anna Friel]] as Briony Mitchel, Mitchel's \"wild\" sister who meets and later dates Dr Raju.<ref name=trio/>\n* [[Ben Chaplin]] as Billy Norton, a none too smart criminal and friend of Mitchel's<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3id2aff40c7008d416af28e160e88626c5 |author=Stuart Kemp |title=Two join trek down 'London Boulevard' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619225634/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3id2aff40c7008d416af28e160e88626c5 |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Rob Gant, a crime boss and homosexual rapist<ref name=trio/>\n* [[Velibor Topic]] as Storbor\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as DS Bailey, a corrupt cop who is following Jordan and bribing Mitchel, causing him to get into trouble with Gant.\n* [[Sanjeev Bhaskar]] as Sanji Raju, a friend of Mitchel's who begins to court Briony.\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as Danny, a contact of Mitchel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ia0e58e69829af2a9c1ee614b5322da03 |author=Steven Zeitchik |title=Stephen Graham off to 'London' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=14 July 2009 |accessdate=28 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n* [[Ophelia Lovibond]] as Penny, Charlotte's friend\n* [[Simon Grover]] as the Porter at Storage.\n* [[Gerald Home]] as the Undertaker.\n* [[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]] as Fletcher, one of Gant's henchmen.\n* [[Alan Williams (actor)|Alan Williams]] as Joe, a homeless man who is friendly with Mitchel.\n\n==Production==\n\nThe film is set in London, which is where the majority of the scenes were filmed, with some scenes shot at [[Ealing Studios]].
