The film was written by husband-and-wife team Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner.\n\nThe film was a box office success and received positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (Turner), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. In addition, Turner was nominated for Best Foreign Actress at the [[Sant Jordi Awards]].\n\nThe title of the movie and the name of the main character refer to the 1959 [[Buddy Holly]] [[Peggy Sue Got Married (song)|song of the same name]], which is played over the film's opening credits.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1985, Peggy Sue Bodell attends her 25-year high school reunion, accompanied by her daughter, Beth, rather than her husband, Charlie, who was her high-school sweetheart. She and Charlie married right after graduation when Peggy Sue became pregnant, but have recently separated due to Charlie's infidelity.\n\nAt the reunion, Peggy reconnects with her old high school girlfriends, Maddy and Carol. She ignores Charlie when he unexpectedly arrives. The emcee then announces the reunion's \u201cking and queen\": Richard Norvik, the former class geek who is now a billionaire inventor, and Peggy Sue. Overwhelmed, she faints onstage while being crowned.\n\nPeggy Sue awakens, only it is now 1960, her senior year of high school. Confused and disoriented, she decides to go home to her parents and act like everything is normal. Hoping that Richard Norvik can shed light on her situation, she befriends him and relates what happened. He disbelieves her story until Peggy Sue begins giving details about the future. She later decides to break up with Charlie. However, she wants to sleep with him after a party, but he panics and reminds her that she rebuffed him the weekend before. He takes her home, but instead of going inside, she goes to an all-night caf\u00e9 where she sees fellow student Michael Fitzsimmons, an artsy loner who she always wished she had slept with. As they sit and talk, Peggy Sue learns they have much in common. They leave on his motorcycle and later have sex under the stars.\n\nThe next night at a music bar, Michael wants Peggy to go to Utah with him and another female for a polygamous relationship where the two women support him while he writes. She declines, telling him to use their night together as inspiration for his writing. Charlie happens to be singing at the bar, and she sees there is more to him than she realized. Charlie comes off the stage and speaks to a music agent who is there to evaluate him but is unimpressed.\n\nThe next day, Peggy Sue tries to talk to Charlie but he lashes out, upset over failing to secure a record deal. She leaves to say goodbye to Richard, stating that she wants to stop ruining her life and everyone's around her, especially Charlie's, since the reason he stopped singing is because she got pregnant. Richard proposes, but she turns him down, not wanting to marry so young or derail his future. Peggy Sue visits her grandparents on her 18th birthday. Upon learning that her grandmother is psychic, she tells them her story. Her grandfather takes her to his [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lodge, where the members perform a ritual to return her to 1985. Charlie enters the lodge and\u2014when lights go out\u2014picks up and runs out with Peggy Sue, leaving everyone inside believing the ritual worked.\n\nCharlie tells her that he has given up singing and has been given 10% of the family business. He then proposes and gives her the locket she was wearing at the beginning of the film. She looks inside and sees baby pictures of herself and Charlie, which resemble their children. Peggy Sue realizes they love each other. They have sex, proving that she would make the same choices again.\n\nPeggy Sue awakens in a hospital back in 1985, with Charlie at her side. He deeply regrets his infidelity and wants her back.  Peggy Sue and Charlie reconcile.\n\nMichael has written a book dedicated to Peggy and a starry night, indicating that Peggy possibly did travel back in time.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kathleen Turner]] as Peggy Sue Kelcher-Bodell\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as Charlie \"Crazy Charlie\" Bodell\n* [[Barry Miller (actor)|Barry Miller]] as Richard Norvik\n* [[Catherine Hicks]] as Carol Heath\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Maddy Nagle\n* [[Kevin J.
