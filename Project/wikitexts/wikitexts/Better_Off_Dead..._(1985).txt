It stars [[John Cusack]] as high school student Lane Myer, who becomes [[Suicide crisis|suicidal]] after his girlfriend breaks up with him shortly before Christmas.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the town of Greendale{{efn|name=\"Greendale\"|The \u201cGreendale\u201d in the film is fictional. There is an unincorporated community in Yolo County in Northern California called \u201cGreendale\u201d; the real-life Greendale is not the setting for the film.}} in [[Northern California]], high school student Lane Myer's two main interests are skiing and his girlfriend of six months, Beth Truss. Shortly before Christmas, Beth dumps Lane for the handsome and popular captain of the ski team, Roy Stalin. Roy is an arrogant bully who unfairly rejects Lane at ski team tryouts. Beth also criticizes Lane's car, an old station wagon. Although Lane also owns a 1967 [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]], he has not been able to get it running and it sits in the driveway in a dilapidated state.\n\nLane lives in a suburban development with his mother, Jenny, a ditzy housewife who routinely concocts creepy (and creeping) family meals; his genius little brother, Badger, who never speaks but at the age of \"almost 8\" can build powerful lasers and attract trashy women from \"How-to\" books; and his lawyer father, Al, who daily tries to stop the menacing paperboy, Johnny Gasparini, from breaking his garage door windows with thrown newspapers. Furthermore, Johnny claims that the Myers owe him two dollars for newspapers, and persistently hounds Lane, yelling \"I want my two dollars!\" Lane also regularly encounters two Korean [[drag racing|drag racers]], one of whom learned to speak English by listening to [[Howard Cosell]].\n\nLane cannot get past Beth's rejection and decides that death is the only way out of his misery. He makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, which all comically fail. With the help of his best friend, Charles de Mar (who in lieu of not being able to get \"real drugs\" in their small town, constantly inhales everyday substances like [[Jell-O]], snow, and [[nitrous oxide]] from a whipped cream can), Lane tries to ski the K-12, the highest peak in town, in hopes of getting Beth back, but wipes out. Lane is further embarrassed when he gets fired from his humiliating fast food job at Pig Burgers in front of Roy and Beth, who are there on a date. To top it all, he increasingly begins to suffer from neurotic hallucinations owing to the mounting frustrations in his life.\n\nAs Lane attempts to either end his life or win back his ex-girlfriend, he gradually gets to know a new girl: a French foreign-exchange student named Monique Junot, who has a crush on him. She is staying with Lane's overbearing neighbor Mrs. Smith, who continually tries to force Monique into being a girlfriend for her socially awkward son Ricky.  The pair are so annoying that she pretends she cannot speak English.  Monique, a [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] fan, turns out to be an excellent auto mechanic and skier who helps Lane fix his Camaro and tries to build his confidence. When Roy insults Monique, Lane challenges him to a ski race down the K-12, with the winner to be captain of the ski team. Monique helps Lane prepare for the race, which he ultimately wins despite losing a ski and being pursued by Johnny. Beth rushes to embrace Lane at the finish line, but he rejects her and after besting Ricky (who attempts to keep Lane from rescuing Monique from the restraints of his mother) in a ski-pole swordfight, drives off with Monique in his Camaro. Lane and Monique are last seen kissing on home plate at [[Dodger Stadium]], with Johnny bicycling towards them, while in a mid-credit scene Badger launches a homemade space shuttle from his room through the roof of the house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[John Cusack]] as Lane Myer\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Al Myer\n* [[Diane Franklin]] as Monique Junot\n* [[Kim Darby]] as Jenny Myer\n* [[Curtis Armstrong]] as Charles De Mar\n* [[Amanda Wyss]] as Beth Truss\n* Aaron Dozier as Roy Stalin\n* Demian Slade as Johnny Gasparini\n* Scooter Stevens as Badger Myer\n* [[Yuji Okumoto]] as Yee Sook Ree\n* Brian Imada as Chen Ree\n* Laura Waterbury as Mrs. Smith\n* [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]] as Ricky Smith\n* [[Chuck Mitchell]] as Rocko\n* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as Mr. Kerber\n* [[Taylor Negron]] as Mailman\n* [[Rick Rosenthal]] as Smitty\n* [[E.
