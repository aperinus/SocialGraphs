Directed by Landis, the film stars Aykroyd and [[John Goodman]], with [[cameo appearance]]s by various musicians. The film is dedicated to [[John Belushi]], [[Cab Calloway]], and [[John Candy]], cast members from the original film who had died prior to the sequel's production, as well as [[Junior Wells]], who died one month before it was released.\n\n==Plot==\nElwood Blues is released from prison after serving eighteen years for the events of the [[The Blues Brothers (film)|previous film]] and is informed that his brother, \"Joliet\" Jake Blues has died. He is picked up by Matara, a friend who works for his former drummer [[Willie Hall (drummer)|Willie Hall]] who wants to help him get back on his feet.\n\nBefore meeting up with Willie, Elwood asks to be dropped off to see Mother Mary Stigmata who is now working at a hospital after the orphanage was closed. She informs him that Curtis has also died but fathered an illegitimate son, Cabel Chamberlain, who is an [[Illinois State Police]] commander, and introduces him to an orphan, Buster, to suggest mentoring him.\n\nAgainst Stigmata\u2019s advice, Elwood tracks down Cabel at his police headquarters to inform him of his real father and asks him to join [[The Blues Brothers Band]], which he plans on reforming. Cabel, upset by the news and offended by the suggestion to join him after seeing Elwood's and Jake's criminal histories, throws him out of the building, where Buster steals his wallet; it contains enough money for Elwood to purchase a new [[Bluesmobile]].\n\nElwood and Buster begin tracking down members of the former band to recruit them from their current jobs. Willie runs a strip club and joins after it is burned down by the Russian mafia because Elwood enlisted the help of Willie\u2019s barman \"Mighty\" Mack McTeer to try and convince them to leave the club alone. Another member, [[Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy]], joins again at the advice of his wife, with whom he now runs a [[Mercedes-Benz]] dealership. Three members work at a radio station and quickly agree to join, and finally, [[Murphy Dunne]] joins after his boss at a call center gives him permission.\n\nThe newly-reformed band uses their old agent to book them a show. On the way to the show, they are followed by Cabel and the Illinois state police, who are now looking for Elwood for stealing Cabel\u2019s wallet earlier, and believing that he has kidnapped Buster. While avoiding the police, Elwood interrupts a militia group meeting, unintentionally destroying their boat full of explosives they planned to use.\n\nThe band arrives at the show to find they have been mistakenly booked as a [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass band]], but perform anyway. Afterwards, they evade capture by the police, but they catch up with them at a [[tent revival]] where Reverend Cleophus James is preaching. Before Cabel can arrest them, he has an epiphany brought on by Reverend Cleophus that he should join the band instead of being a police officer. The band evades capture once more, now with Cabel joining them, who the police believe is brainwashed.\n\nThe band continues on to their next booking, an audition for a [[Battle of the Bands]] put on by Queen Mousette who Mack informs is allegedly a 130-year-old voodoo witch. Queen Mousette requests the band play something [[List of Caribbean music genres|Caribbean]]; when Elwood explains they don\u2019t play Caribbean music, she casts a spell on them to play anyway. Mousette accepts the band into the battle; however Elwood, Mack, and Cabel are turned into statues.\n\nAt the show, Queen Mousette undoes the spell to allow the Blues Brothers to play against the Louisiana Gator Boys, a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] of blues musicians who win the battle. After the battle, the show is interrupted by the arrival of the Russian mafia and the militia group from earlier; they are turned into rats by Queen Mousette. The Illinois state police arrive, but stand down after Cabel informs them that he is all right. Elwood suggests that the two bands jam together on stage, and uses the performance as cover when Mother Mary Stigmata arrives to say goodbye to Cabel and Mack and escape with Buster, with the police giving chase.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Bands and musical guests===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====The Blues Brothers Band====\n{{Main|The Blues Brothers}}\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Elwood J.

[[Nia Peeples]] portrays a state police officer, [[Darrell Hammond]] a militia member, [[John Lyons (actor)|John Lyons]] a Russian thug, and [[Paul Shaffer]] as Queen Moussette's majordomo. The film is dedicated to [[John Belushi]], [[Cab Calloway]], and [[John Candy]], cast members from the original film who had died prior to the sequel's production.\n\n==Production==\n''Blues Brothers 2000'' made it into the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]] for the biggest car pile-up, a record previously held by the original film. 63 cars were used in the scene after Elwood says to the band, \"Don't look back.\" Inevitably, everyone looks back and sees the massive pile-up. Portions of this scene were filmed in [[Niagara Falls]], Ontario.\n\nThe movie held the record for Most Cars Destroyed in the course of production for nine years at 104, one more than was wrecked in ''The Blues Brothers'', until ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]'' surpassed it in 2009 with 112 cars destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/419907/leading-movies-most-vehicle-damaged/|title=Movies with most cars destroyed 2013 - Statistic|author=|date=|website=Statista|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nThe film was originally intended to include Brother Zee Blues ([[Jim Belushi]], brother of John Belushi). But due to an already existing television deal (Belushi had been cast in the ABC drama ''[[Total Security (TV series)|Total Security]]''), Belushi was unable to appear and the script was altered to include Cab Blues ([[Joe Morton]]). This character was named Cabel as an homage to [[Cab Calloway]], who died four years prior to the film's release. (His character Curtis was revealed to have died in the film along with Jake.)\n\nThe Blues Brothers' original keyboardist, [[Paul Shaffer]], had been committed to [[Gilda Radner]]'s one-woman show on Broadway and was therefore unable to appear in the first film. He was replaced by actor-musician [[Murphy Dunne]]. Shaffer does appear in ''Blues Brothers 2000'', taking a week off from ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to film his role as Queen Moussette's majordomo and emcee of the Battle of the Bands ([[Warren Zevon]] took his place that week on Letterman's show). Shaffer shaved his head for the role, a change in appearance he chose to retain permanently.\n\nDuring the \"Funky Nassau\" number, Shaffer in his character of \"Marco,\" asks to cut in on keyboards, which Murph allows. This marks the first time on-screen that the Blues Brothers Band played with their original keyboardist.\n\nSeveral cast members from the first film reprised their characters, including [[Frank Oz]], [[Jeff Morris (actor)|Jeff Morris]], [[Steve Lawrence]], [[Kathleen Freeman]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and [[James Brown]].\n\n==Release==\n''Blues Brothers 2000'' was screened out of competition at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4901/year/1998.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Blues Brothers 2000 |accessdate=October 4, 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film grossed a little over $14 million in box office sales in North America.<ref name=\"BOM2\">{{cite web | title=Box Office Mojo | work=Blues Brothers 2000 | url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bluesbrothers2000.htm | accessdate=December 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received mixed reviews, averaging a 46% positive rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 46 reviews, and a critical consensus that reads \"Braving onward without the late John Belushi, ''Blues Brothers 2000'' gets the band back together with a spirited soundtrack, but a mission that's far less divine\".<ref name=\"rt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blues_brothers_2000/ |title=''Blues Brothers 2000'' (1997) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}</ref> It earned a D score from [[Entertainment Weekly]].<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/article/1998/02/20/blues-brothers-2000/ |title=''Blues Brothers 2000'' |last=Sinclair |first=Tom |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Warner |date=February 20, 1998 |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 stars, saying, \"The film is lame comedy surrounded by high-energy blues (and some pop, rock and country music).\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/blues-brothers-2000-1998 |title=''Blues Brothers 2000'' Movie Review (1998) |last=Ebert |first=Roger |work=RoberEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |date=February 26, 1998 |accessdate=May 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAudiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |title=Home - Cinemascore |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |website=Cinemascore |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Video game==\n{{main|Blues Brothers 2000 (video game)}}\nA ''Blues Brothers 2000'' video game was released for the [[Nintendo 64]] on November 17, 2000, two years after the film's release.
