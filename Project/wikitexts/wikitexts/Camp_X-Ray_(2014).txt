It stars [[Kristen Stewart]] and [[Peyman Moaadi]] with [[John Carroll Lynch]], [[Lane Garrison]], and [[Joseph Julian Soria]] in supporting roles. The film premiered on January 17, 2014, at [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]] in the U.S. dramatic competition category<ref>{{cite news|title=Sundance 2014 Competition Lineup Includes SKELETON TWINS with Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, CAMP X-RAY with Kristen Stewart, and More|url=https://collider.com/sundance-2014-lineup-camp-x-ray-skeleton-twins/|accessdate=December 5, 2013 |publisher=collider.com |date=December 5, 2013}}</ref> and released on October 17, 2014, by [[IFC Films]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins with the [[September 11 attacks]] shown on television when Ali Amir enters a house and begins to perform [[salah]] (Islamic prayer) when he is kidnapped and taken to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], specifically [[Camp Delta]].\n\nEight years later, Army Private first-class Amy Cole is placed as a guard at Guantanamo. Upon arrival, she volunteers for the [[Initial Reaction Force|IRF]] (the riot squad) and is cold towards the detainees, despite her contempt for the facility's handling of detainees. While on duty, Ali tries to make conversation, but Cole is annoyed by his persistence and rebuffs his advances; in return, Ali throws his feces at her and is sent to the [[Frequent flyer program (Guantanamo)|frequent flyer program]] (sleep deprivation punishment). Corporal \"Randy\" Ransdell also takes an interest in Cole, going as far as to attempt to have sex with her in a bathroom.\n\nCole enters Ali's cell while it is being searched and notices suicide-prevention pamphlets on the floor. She finds Ali's file, which reveals that he has a history of self-harm and discipline, becoming more and more violent as time passed. When Ali returns to his cell, he apologizes to Amy for his actions. He confides to her that he was born in [[Bremen, Germany]] and was not involved with terrorist groups, and a relationship forms between the two.\n\nEight months later, Ransdell lies to Cole and orders her to watch Ali shower, violating [[Standard operating procedure|SOP]] (Standard Operating Procedure) and Arabic social norms. Upon discovering that Ransdell lied, Cole files a report with her commanding officer, Colonel James Drummond. Drummond talks to Ransdell, who makes (unspecified) counter-accusations, and dismisses Cole's complaint because Ransdell is her superior. Ransdell and Cole must both attend a board of inquiry (not shown nor later referred to). Cole begins to become more isolated from the other guards and is reassigned to the night shift.\n\nOne night, near the end of Cole's tour at Guantanamo, Ali takes a blade hidden in his Quran and is about to commit suicide, but is talked down by Cole, who tells him her name and where she's from (also violations of SOP). At this point, it is clear that her feelings towards the detainee have softened as she is distressed by the possibility of him dying. As Cole leaves Guantanamo teary-eyed, Ali discovers the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Harry Potter book]] he had been hoping for over two years, finding she had written a note inside saying:  \"To Ali, I don't know if [[Severus Snape|Snape's]] a good guy. But I know you are. Love, Blondie\u201d.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kristen Stewart]] as PFC Amy Cole / Referred to as \"Blondie\" by Ali throughout the film.
