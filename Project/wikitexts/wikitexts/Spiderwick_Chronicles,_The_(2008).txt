After finishing the Book, he hides it away for fear of Mulgarath, a [[shapeshifting]] [[ogre]] who plans to use the Book's secrets for evil.\n \t\nEighty years later, recently divorced Helen Grace inherits and moves into the abandoned Spiderwick estate with her children, daughter Mallory and [[identical twin|twin]] sons Jared and Simon. Jared is angry about the move and would rather live with his father, Richard Grace. After uncovering a hidden dumbwaiter, Jared discovers Arthur's study where he finds the Field Guide. When Jared explains his discovery of the Book and the existence of magical creatures, his family doesn't believe him.\n \t\nThe next morning, Jared meets a [[brownie (mythology)|brownie]] named Thimbletack, who is initially angry with Jared for having opened the book that Thimbletack was supposed to be protecting from the shape-shifting ogre Mulgarath. Jared placates him with crackers and honey, and Thimbletack gives Jared a [[adder stone|holed stone]] that allows Jared to see the normally invisible faeries by looking through it. Thimbletack tells him about the protective [[fairy ring|mushroom circle]] surrounding the house.\n \t\nJared then witnesses Simon's abduction by [[goblins]], led by [[Redcap]]. Simon is taken to the goblins' campsite where he is confronted by Mulgarath who is disguised as an old man. Jared sneaks into the campsite to save him where he meets Hogsqueal, a [[hobgoblin]], who gives Jared the ability to see faeries without the stone by spitting in his eyes so that he can help him get revenge on Mulgarath for killing his family. Mulgarath releases Simon so he can fetch the Book for him. Jared finds Simon and both fight over the Book before they are chased by the goblins. The twins flee back to the house, and Mallory, upon almost being ambushed by the goblins, which cause her to realize Jared was right, fights them off with her [[sabre (fencing)|fencing sabre]].\n\t\nAfter failing to try and burn the Book due to a protective spell over it, the children decide to visit Arthur's daughter, their great-aunt Lucinda Spiderwick, for advice. While Simon distracts the goblins, Mallory and Jared, taking the Book with, escape through an underground tunnel. Chased by a [[troll]] sent by Redcap, they narrowly escape when it is struck and killed by an oncoming truck. Jared and Mallory meet the elderly Lucinda in the [[psychiatric hospital]] where she lives, surrounded by [[sprite (folklore)|sprites]]. She tells the children that they need to find her father and have him destroy the Book and that, for eighty years, Arthur has been held captive by the [[sylphs]]. At that moment, Redcap and his goblins attack them through the window and manage to tear off several pages from the Book before being driven off. Among the stolen pages, Mulgarath is pleased to find information on how to break the protective circle.\n \t\nWhile Helen is driving Jared and Mallory home, she and Jared argue over her disbelief; Jared angrily tells Helen that he hates her and doesn't want to live with her anymore. Later, Hogsqueal, having overheard Mulgarath's plan, informs the children while also giving Simon and Mallory the ability to see faeries as well. Jared then tries to call his father again, but a sympathetic Mallory tells him that their father has moved in with another woman after his and Helen's divorce and won't be coming for him, causing a heartbroken Jared to regret his angry words to Helen earlier. Jared, Simon, and Mallory then use the Book to summon a [[griffin]], which takes them to the sylphs' realm. There, they meet Arthur, who has not aged and is unaware of the time he has spent there. Jared asks him to destroy the Book only to find out that Thimbletack had switched the pages with a cookbook and kept the real Book. Arthur is relieved until Jared tells him that Mulgarath knows how to break the protective circle. Arthur informs Jared that the sylphs won't allow them to leave as they, like him, know too much about the faeries. Arthur helps them escape by distracting the sylphs with the fake book.\n\t\nAt home, the children finally convince Helen of the truth when they save her from the goblins' attempted ambush and then her seeing Thimbletack upon her return home. Meanwhile, the goblins finish spreading their potion, which successfully breaks the circle as the full moon rises. The family defend themselves with kitchen knives and tomato sauce/salt bombs (ingredients deadly to goblins) that Simon and Thimbletack made earlier and manage to kill Redcap and the goblins in an explosion of tomato sauce. Suddenly, Richard appears, claiming that he has decided to come back and stay with them; however, Jared, having remembered what Mallory told him earlier, stabs him, revealing him to be Mulgarath in disguise. Mulgarath then pursues Jared and the Book throughout the house before cornering him on the roof. Jared tosses the Book and Mulgarath transforms into a raven to catch it, but he is suddenly grabbed and eaten by Hogsqueal. Afterwards, Jared and his mother reconcile, with Jared deciding to live with her and they help Simon, Mallory, and Hogsqueal gather the Book's scattered pages.\n \t\nSeveral weeks later, the family brings Lucinda to visit Thimbletack and the house. The sylphs then arrive with Arthur, allowing him to briefly visit now that the Book is safe. However, Arthur cannot stay long as he will turn to dust if he remains. Lucinda asks to go with him and is transformed back into a child. The Grace family watch as the sylphs spirit Arthur and Lucinda away before resuming their normal lives with Thimbletack, Hogsqueal, and the griffin.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as the Grace twins\n** Jared Grace: The angry one and is the most reluctant about moving from New York. \n** Simon Grace: Jared's identical twin brother and a [[Pacifism|pacifistic]] animal lover.\n* [[Sarah Bolger]] as Mallory Grace: Jared and Simon's older sister.\n* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Helen Grace: the children's overprotective mother.\n* [[Andrew McCarthy]] as Richard Grace: Jared, Simon, and Mallory's divorced and neglectful father.\n** McCarthy also portrays Mulgarath's disguise of Richard.\n* [[Joan Plowright]] as Lucinda Spiderwick, the daughter of Arthur Spiderwick and of Constance Spiderwick.\n** Jordy Benattar as Young Lucinda Spiderwick\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Arthur Spiderwick, the author of the guide and former owner of the mansion.\n* Lise Durocher-Viens as Constance Spiderwick, the wife of Arthur spiderwick and mother of Lucinda Spiderwick \n* [[Tod Fennell]] as Helen Grace's co-worker\n* Mariah Inger as Nurse\n* Jeremy Lavalley as Tow Truck Driver\n\n'''Voice cast''' -\n* [[Nick Nolte]] as Mulgarath, an evil shapeshifting [[ogre]] and the leader of the goblins.\n** Nolte also portrays Mulgarath in his human form. \n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Hogsqueal, an unintelligent bird-eating [[hobgoblin]] who seeks revenge against Mulgarath for killing his family.\n* [[Martin Short]] as Thimbletack, a loyal house [[Brownie (folklore)|brownie]] who [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifts]] into an aggressive [[boggart]] when he becomes angry.\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as [[Redcap]], Mulgarath's aggressive and loyal general of his goblin army.
