[[Frank Langella]], [[Kevin Dunn]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[Charles Grodin]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] appear in supporting roles.\n\n==Plot==\nDave Kovic runs a [[Temporary work|temporary employment agency]] in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]]  and impersonates [[President of the United States|President]] Bill Mitchell as a side job. [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Duane Stevenson recruits him to impersonate Mitchell after a speech, ostensibly as a security precaution, but in reality to cover up Mitchell\u2019s affair with a staffer. Dave\u2019s appearance goes well, but Mitchell suffers a major [[stroke]] while having sex, leading [[White House Chief of Staff]] Bob Alexander and [[White House Communications Director|Communications Director]] Alan Reed to ask Dave to continue in his role. Bob\u2019s scheme is to force [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Gary Nance, a good man, to resign after purposefully embroiling him in a [[savings and loan crisis|savings and loan scandal]], and then have Dave, acting as Mitchell, appoint Bob as vice president, whereupon they will reveal Mitchell\u2019s incapacity and Bob will become president. Alan is initially reluctant to agree to the plan, but eventually acquiesces and tells the [[White House press corps|press corps]] the stroke was minor. Dave agrees to keep impersonating Mitchell and Nance is sent on a good will tour of [[Africa]].\n\nDave's charm and enthusiasm for life changes Mitchell\u2019s previously grumpy image and increases his popularity. [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] Ellen Mitchell, who has been privately estranged from her husband for years, is initially convinced that Dave is her husband and treats him with contempt on the few occasions they see each other. When Dave accompanies her to a [[homeless shelter]], for which she is a staunch advocate, she sees his empathy towards a shy boy and begins to soften towards him. Her fury returns, though, after Bob [[Forgery|forges]] Mitchell\u2019s signature on the [[Veto#United States|veto]] of a public works bill that included funding for the shelter. Dave, after consulting his [[accountant]] friend Murray Blum, works with the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] to restore the funding. A furious Bob threatens to destroy Dave, but Alan vows to expose their scheme if he does.\n\nEllen, having witnessed Dave's considerable efforts to save the shelter, confronts Dave and he admits he is an impostor. Dave has Duane escort them to the secret hospital room beneath the White House, where Mitchell remains in a coma. They both resolve to leave the White House, but become closer after spending a night out alone together. Ellen tells Dave she's gone along with the charade of being happily married to Bill because she thought she could help people as First Lady. Dave tells her he wishes he could do the same. They begin to fall in love and choose to stay.\n\nThe next day, Dave calls a [[press conference]] and, when Bob fires him, threatens to tell the press corps the truth about Mitchell. He orders Bob to resign and announces a plan to provide a job to every American who wants one.\n\nNance returns from Africa and pleads his innocence of the scandal to Dave, who hears about Bob\u2019s plot from Alan. To get back at Dave, Bob reveals evidence implicating Mitchell in the scandal, which Alan admits is true. Despite talk of [[impeachment]], Dave refuses to back off his jobs plan.\n\nDuring a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]], Dave admits that Bob\u2019s allegations are true and takes responsibility for the scandal. He produces proof, furnished by Alan, that shows Bob was directly involved and Nance is innocent. As he continues his speech, he fakes another stroke and switches bodies with Mitchell on the way to the hospital, enabling him to resume his previous life. The hospital pronounces the \"second\" stroke as major and Mitchell continues to lie in a [[coma]] for several more months before dying. Nance becomes president, Bob and several administration officials are eventually indicted, and the jobs plan becomes law.\n\nDave runs for [[Government of the District of Columbia#Council|city council]] with the help of Murray and his staff at his employment agency. Dave is surprised one day when Ellen visits. He escorts her into his office where they share their first kiss. Dave closes the shades to give them privacy and Duane steps in front of the door, wearing one of Dave\u2019s campaign buttons.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Dave Kovic/President William Harrison Mitchell\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Ellen Mitchell\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Bob Alexander\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as Alan Reed\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Duane Stevensen\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as Vice President Gary Nance\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Murray Blum\n* [[Faith Prince]] as Alice\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Randi\n* [[Tom Dugan (American actor)|Tom Dugan]] as Jerry\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Don Durenberger\n* [[Ralph Manza]] as White House Barber\n* [[Bonnie Hunt]] as White House Tour Guide\n* [[Anna Deavere Smith]] as Mrs. Travis\n* [[Charles Hallahan]] as Policeman\n* [[Stefan Gierasch]] as House Majority Leader}}\n\n===Cameos===\n{{castlist|\n;Politicians\n* [[Chris Dodd|Senator Christopher Dodd]]\n* [[Tom Harkin|Senator Tom Harkin]]\n* [[Howard Metzenbaum|Senator Howard Metzenbaum]]\n* [[Abner J.

Ross wrote the script while working on the [[Michael Dukakis]] [[Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential campaign|presidential campaign]] during the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 election]], and he was inspired by the [[Iran\u2013Contra affair|Iran-contra affair]]. Ross also received advice from First Lady [[Barbara Bush]]'s press secretary Anna Perez. Shuler-Donner approved it, but her employer [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] refused to release it while a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] such as [[Ronald Reagan]] or [[George H. W. Bush]] held the presidency. [[Warner Bros.]] bought the project with the intent to have it directed by Shuler-Donner's husband [[Richard Donner]], but he decided against continuing with the project in 1990.  Production was delayed by three years to wait for Shuler Donner to be released from her contract with Disney and for director [[Ivan Reitman]] to become available.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to Reitman, Warner Bros. wanted a box office star to portray the lead role and that one executive even suggested [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] to play the part.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dave: Kevin Kline and Ivan Reitman|date=12 October 1993|publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/11702339998/dave-kevin-kline-and-ivan-reitman|access-date=4 February 2018}}</ref>  [[Michael Keaton]] was briefly cast in the role but had to drop out. Both [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Kevin Costner]] were also considered for the role.<ref name=\":0\" /> In fact, it was Beatty who brought ''Dave'' to Reitman's attention.

Reitman then called [[Sigourney Weaver]], with whom he had worked in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', for the First Lady role.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ivan Reitman and Lauren Shuler Donner DAVE Blu-ray Interview | url=http://collider.com/ivan-reitman-lauren-shuler-donner-dave-blu-ray-interview/ | website=Collider  |access-date=10 May 2013}}</ref> Ross was present for production, as he was interested in starting a directing career as well.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Prigg\u00e9 | first=Steven | title=Movie Moguls Speak: Interviews with Top Film Producers | publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] | location=Jefferson, North Carolina | year=2004 | isbn=0-7864-1929-6 | page=92}}</ref>\n\nFilming began on August 13, 1992, in Los Angeles and Washington D.C.

Ebert praised the film's acting and wrote, \"''Dave'' takes that old plot about an ordinary person who is suddenly thrust into a position of power, and finds a fresh way to tell it. [...] When I first heard this story line, I imagined that ''Dave'' would be completely predictable. I was wrong. The movie is more proof that it isn't what you do, it's how you do it: Ivan Reitman's direction and Gary Ross's screenplay use intelligence and warmhearted sentiment to make ''Dave'' into wonderful lighthearted entertainment. [...] Both Kline and Weaver are good at playing characters of considerable intelligence, and that's the case here. The movie may be built on subtle variations of the [[Idiot plot|Idiot Plot]] (in which the characters skillfully avoid tripping over obvious conclusions), but they bring such particular qualities to their characters that we almost believe them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dave-1993|title=Dave Movie Review & Summary (1993)|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|date=7 May 1993|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThen-President [[Bill Clinton]] approved of the film, and gave Ross a framed script, which Clinton had autographed, writing that it was a \"funny, often accurate lampooning of politics.\" Clinton also gave Ross a picture of himself holding a ''Dave'' mug.<ref>{{cite web | author=Scott Kaufer | title=Strange Bedfellows | work=Los Angeles Magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XF8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66 | date=March 2000 | access-date=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
