Green stars in the film as a childish [[slacker]] who wishes to become a professional cartoonist while dealing with his abusive father's behavior. Its plot resembles Green's struggles as a young man trying to get his television series picked up, which would later become the [[MTV]] series ''[[The Tom Green Show]]''. The title of the film refers to a plot point where Green's character falsely accuses his father of sexually abusing his brother, the eponymous Freddy.\n\nReleased on April 20, 2001, by [[20th Century Fox]], ''Freddy Got Fingered'' was critically panned at the time of its release, with many considering it as one of the [[List of films considered the worst#Freddy Got Fingered (2001)|worst films of all time]]. It was also a [[Box-office bomb|box office disappointment]], grossing only $14.3 million worldwide, slightly above its $14 million budget. It received five [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s of its [[22nd Golden Raspberry Awards|eight nominations]], as well as a [[Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association]] Award for Worst Picture. However, the film quickly developed a [[cult film|cult following]] after its release on home video and has earned some critical reevaluation.\n\n==Plot==\nUnemployed 28-year-old [[cartoonist]] Gordon \"Gord\" Brody leaves his parents' home in [[Portland, Oregon]], to pursue his lifelong ambition of obtaining a contract for an animated television series. His parents, Jim and Julie, give him a [[Chrysler LeBaron]] which he drives to [[Los Angeles]] and starts work at a cheese sandwich factory to make money. Gord shows his drawings to Dave Davidson, the CEO of a major animation studio; Davidson commends the artwork but calls the concepts depicted, including a vigilante \"X-Ray Cat\", nonsensical. Disheartened, Gord quits his job and returns to his parents.\n\nJim constantly insults and belittles Gord following his return, telling him to forget about being an animator and \"get a job\". When Gord pressures his friend Darren into skating on a wooden half-pipe he has built outside the Brody home, Darren falls and breaks his leg. At the hospital, Gord impersonates a doctor, delivers a baby, and meets an attractive nurse named Betty, who uses a wheelchair, has an obsessive penchant for [[fellatio]], and wants to create a rocket-powered wheelchair. Gord lies to his father that he has got a job in the computer industry and goes out to a restaurant with Betty, pretending he is at work. However, Jim sees him there and disparages Betty due to her disabilities. After a fight in the restaurant, Gord is arrested and Betty bails him out. Following her advice, Gord attempts to continue drawing; however, he gets into an argument with Jim, who then smashes Gord's half-pipe. Gord and his parents then go to a family therapy session, where Gord falsely accuses Jim of \"[[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]]\" Gord's younger brother, Freddy. The 25-year-old Freddy is sent to a home for sexually molested children despite looking nothing like a child while Julie, being fed up with his abusive behavior and short temper, leaves Jim and ends up dating the basketball player [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. While in a drunken stupor, Jim tells Gord how much of a disappointment he is to him. Affected by his father's words, Gord decides to abandon his aspirations to be a cartoonist and gets a job at a local sandwich shop.\n\nAfter seeing a television news report on Betty's successful rocket-powered wheelchair, Gord is inspired to pursue his dreams once again. He returns to Hollywood with a concept based on his relationship with his father: an animated series called ''Zebras in America''. Jim follows Gord there after threatening Darren into revealing his whereabouts. While Gord is pitching the show to Davidson, Jim bursts in and trashes Davidson's office. Thinking Jim's actions are part of Gord's pitch, Davidson greenlights ''Zebras in America'' and gives Gord a million-dollar check. Gord spends a tenth of that money on an elaborate thank you to Betty for inspiring him, and the remainder to relocate the Brody house to [[Pakistan]] with his father inside, unconscious\u2014a response to Jim's earlier put-down that \"If this were Pakistan, you would have been sewing soccer balls when you were four years old!\"\n\nGord and Jim soon come to terms but are then abducted and held hostage. The kidnapping becomes a news item, as Gord's series has already become popular. After 18 months in captivity, Gord and Jim return to America, where a huge crowd, including Betty and Darren, welcomes them home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tom Green]] as Gordon Brody, a childish 28-year-old slacker cartoonist who dreams of having his own cartoon show.\n* [[Rip Torn]] as Jim Brody, Gord's verbally and emotionally abusive father whom Gord falsely accuses of [[Rape|sexually abusing]] [[Incest|Freddy]] by [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] him.\n* [[Marisa Coughlan]] as Betty Menger, Gord's [[Autosadism|auto-sadistic]] wheelchair-bound girlfriend who dreams of developing a rocket-powered wheelchair and is obsessed with giving [[fellatio]].\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as Freddy Brody, Gord's younger brother.
