Combining live-action sequences directed by the [[Farrelly brothers]] and animation directed by Piet Kroon and [[Tom Sito]], the film stars the voices of [[Chris Rock]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[David Hyde Pierce]], [[Brandy Norwood]], and [[William Shatner]] alongside [[Molly Shannon]], [[Chris Elliott]], and [[Bill Murray]] in live-action roles. It follows the title character, an anthropomorphic [[white blood cell]], as he teams up with a [[Capsule (pharmacy)|cold pill]] to protect his unhealthy human host from a deadly virus.\n\nThe film premiered on August 7, 2001, and was released theatrically three days later. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the world building, the animation, story, and voice performances, but criticized the inconsistent tone of the live-action portions and overuse of [[Gross out|gross-out humor]]. The film was also a [[box-office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing $14 million worldwide against a $70 million budget. Despite the poor financial response, the film was followed by the animated television series ''[[Ozzy & Drix]]'', which aired on [[Kids' WB]] from 2002 to 2004.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], DO NOT take this summary over 700 words. Current wordcount is 607. Thanks!-->\n\nFrank DeTorre is an unhealthy, lazy [[zookeeper]] at Sucat Memorial Zoo in [[Rhode Island]]. He copes with the death of his wife Maggie by overeating and foregoing basic hygiene, much to his daughter Shane's embarrassment. Inside his body, called the \"City of Frank\" by its anthropomorphic inhabitants, [[white blood cell]] Osmosis \"Ozzy\" Jones is a [[Maverick (animal)|maverick]] officer of the Frank Police Department.\n\nDesperate to be re-elected, the corrupt Mayor Phlegmming doubles down on his [[junk food]] policies, ignoring their effect on Frank's health. This induces Frank to eat a [[boiled egg]] that fell into a [[chimpanzee]]'s habitat, allowing Thrax, a [[virus]] known as \"La Muerte Roja\" (\"The Red Death\"), to enter his body. To placate his secretary Leah Estrogen, Phlegmming instructs Frank to take a [[capsule (pharmacy)|cold pill]], Special Agent Drixenol \"Drix\" Drixobenzometaphedramine, who disinfects the throat but unknowingly covers up evidence of Thrax's arrival. Ozzy is ordered to assist Drix's investigation while Thrax takes over a gang of sweat germs run by local [[crime boss]] [[List of Osmosis Jones and Ozzy & Drix characters#Scabies|Scabies]] and attacks the [[dam]] in Frank's nose, nearly killing Drix before Ozzy rescues him.\n\nOzzy and Drix get into an argument, but after Ozzy reveals Thrax and his gang as the cause of the mucus dam breakage, Drix sticks with Ozzy. Ozzy tells Drix the reason for his \"record\": Ozzy induced Frank to vomit a [[food spoilage|contaminated]] [[oyster]] onto Shane's teacher, Mrs. Boyd, causing Frank to be fired from his previous job at the [[pea soup]] factory and banned from visiting Shane's school, and Ozzy was demoted to patrol duty in the mouth for his role in the public humiliation. Drix agrees with Ozzy, and the duo pays a visit to Ozzy's [[informant]], Chill, a [[Influenza vaccine|flu vaccine]] cell who directs them to Thrax's hideout \u2013 a germ-ridden nightclub in a large [[Pimple|zit]] on Frank's forehead. Ozzy goes undercover and infiltrates the gang, learning that Thrax, wanting to be known as the most dangerous virus in medical history, intends to masquerade as a [[common cold]] and use his knowledge of [[DNA]] to kill Frank within forty-eight hours. When Ozzy is discovered, Drix comes to his aid, causing a brawl which culminates in the zit being popped by a [[grenade]]. The pus lands on Mrs. Boyd's lip during a conversation with Frank, foiling his chance to apologize. Furious, Phlegmming closes the investigation, dismisses Ozzy from the force, and orders Drix to leave.\n\nHaving survived the zit's destruction, Thrax kills his remaining henchmen, [[List of Osmosis Jones and Ozzy & Drix characters#Bruiser|Bruiser]] and [[List of Osmosis Jones and Ozzy & Drix characters#Joe Cramp|Joe Cramp]], and attacks the [[hypothalamus]], stealing a crucial [[nucleotide]] before abducting Leah and preparing to flee via the mouth. His actions cause Frank to develop a high [[fever]], prompting his brother, Bob, to take him to the hospital, to Phlegmming's dismay. Ozzy discovers Thrax is alive and convinces Drix to stay. They reach Thrax in the [[uvula]] and rescue Leah, but Thrax uses [[Pollen allergy|pollen]] to induce Frank to sneeze him out of the mouth. Drix launches Ozzy after him, and they land on Shane's [[cornea]]. As they fight, falling onto one of Shane's [[Eyelash extensions|false eyelashes]], Ozzy tricks Thrax into trapping his hand in the lash and escapes as the lash falls into a beaker of [[rubbing alcohol]], dissolving Thrax.\n\nAs Frank's temperature surpasses [[Fever#Hyperpyrexia|{{cvt|108|F}}]], he goes into [[cardiac arrest]]. Riding one of Shane's tears back to Frank's body, Ozzy revives him with the stolen nucleotide. Congratulated as a hero and welcomed back into the police force, Ozzy enters a relationship with Leah, while Drix is allowed to stay as his new partner. Frank commits to a healthier lifestyle, leading Phlegmming to lose the election in a [[landslide election|landslide]] to his opponent, Tom Colonic. Reduced to janitorial duty in the bowels, Phlegmming foolishly ignores a notice not to push a button that triggers Frank's [[flatulence]], ejecting himself from the body.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Osmosis Jones and Ozzy & Drix characters}}\n===Voice Cast===\n* [[Chris Rock]] as Osmosis \"Ozzy\" Jones, a quick-witted [[white blood cell]] with an impulsive personality.\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Thrax, an extremely deadly [[Infectious disease|pathogenic agent]].\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Special Agent Drixenol \"Drix\" Drixobenzometaphedramine, a by-the-book cold pill who becomes Ozzy's partner.\n* [[Brandy Norwood]] as Leah Estrogen, Mayor Phlegmming's secretary and Ozzy's love interest.\n* [[William Shatner]] as Mayor Phlegmming, the arrogant, incompetent and corrupt mayor of the City of Frank.\n* [[Ron Howard]] as Tom Colonic, Phlegmming's rival for the mayoralty of the City of Frank.\n\n[[Kid Rock]], [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Twisted Brown Trucker]] members Kenny Olson, Jason Krause, [[Joe C.]], Stefanie Eulinberg, [[Jimmie \"Bones\" Trombly]], and [[Uncle Kracker]] provide the voices of the fictional band \"Kidney Rock\".

The animated sequences, directed by [[Tom Sito]] and Piet Kroon, went into production as planned even being completed ahead of schedule, but acquiring both a director and a star actor for the live-action sequences took a considerable amount of time, until [[Bill Murray]] was cast as the main character of Frank, and [[Peter Farrelly|Peter]] and [[Bobby Farrelly]] stepped in to direct the live-action sequences. As part of their contract, the Farrelly brothers are credited as the primary directors of the film, although they did no supervision of the animated portions of the film. [[Will Smith]] was interested in the part of Ozzy, but in the end his schedule would not permit it.\n\nPrincipal photography on the live-action scenes took place from April 2 to June 19, 2000 in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]].\n\n''Osmosis Jones'' was originally rated PG-13 by the [[Motion Picture Association|MPAA]] for \"crude language\" and \"bodily humor\" in 2000. However, Warner Bros. edited the film to make it family-friendly; and in 2001 when it was released, the film was re-rated PG on appeal for \"bodily humor\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nThe first trailer for ''Osmosis Jones'' was released in front of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon 3: The Movie]]'' on April 6, 2001, and contains a classical masterpiece from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.\n\n=== Home media ===\n''Osmosis Jones'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] on November 13, 2001.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Osmosis Jones'' had its world premiere screening on August 7, 2001, at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]] before being widely released on August 10, 2001, in 2,305 theaters worldwide. Upon its original release, the film was a financial stump and was the penultimate project produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation#1991-2004: Warner Bros. Feature Animation|Warner Bros. Feature Animation]] (preceded by ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' and followed by ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', which both also failed at the box office upon their original releases). The film opened at #7 in its first opening weekend at the U.S. box office, accumulating $5,271,248 on its opening week. The film soon grossed $13,596,911.<ref name=numbers/> The film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], unable to recover its $70 million production budget.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Osmosis Jones'' has an approval rating of 56% based on 111 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10.
