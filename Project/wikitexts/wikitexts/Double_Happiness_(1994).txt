The film stars [[Sandra Oh]] as Jade Li, an actress struggling to assert her independence from the expectations of her [[Chinese Canadian]] family. [[Callum Keith Rennie]] also stars as Mark, Jade's love interest.\n\nIt was one of Oh's earliest performances; she received critical acclaim for her performance,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/double-happiness-1995|work=The Chicago Sun-Times|title=Double Happiness Movie Review|author=Ebert, Roger|date=August 25, 1995|access-date=April 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE6DB103BF93BA15754C0A963958260&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes|work=The New York Times|author=Maslin, Janet|date=July 28, 1995|access-date=April 16, 2016|title=FILM REVIEW; A Delicate Asian Flower In a Motorcycle Jacket}}</ref> and won the [[Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role]] for the film.\n\n==Plot==\nJade Li ([[Sandra Oh]]) is a feisty, 22-year-old Chinese-Canadian aspiring actress who lives at home with her traditional Chinese family: her strict father (Stephen Chang), her dutiful mother (Alannah Ong), and her sweet younger sister, Pearl (Frances You). Their older brother, Winston, has been disowned\u2014a fate Jade is not eager to share, both for her own sake and to spare her family pain.\n\nHer family tries to put on the perfect public persona at all costs so as to maintain their dignity as well as uphold their traditional Chinese values. One primary part of this persona is prosperity. Jade's father hopes that true financial prosperity will become reality through penny stocks. Jade, meanwhile, tries to achieve that happy medium between giving in to her parents' wishes and fulfilling her own needs and desires - double happiness. Therefore, although she manages to land a few bit parts on camera, Jade spends most of her time working in the shop owned by a family friend, performing the duties of a respectful daughter and suffering through arranged dates with prosperous young Chinese men (Including one who is [[gay]].). An adept cultural chameleon, though, she also leads a double life, hanging out with best friend Lisa (Claudette Carracedo).\n\nWhen her father's childhood friend arrives for a visit, Jade must juggle her competing identities even more carefully than usual, lest her choice of professions\u2014and boyfriends\u2014shame her father. Because of its instability, Jade's parents don't understand or widely publicize Jade's aspirations to be an actress. Their main want for Jade is to date and marry a nice Chinese boy, a goal for which Jade's extended family also strives as they are always trying to introduce her to Chinese boys. Initially, they believe that ''the'' boy is Andrew, with who Jade even agrees to go out. But Jade, beyond wanting to be an actress, wishes her family had more western sensibilities. She is attracted to a slightly awkward but persistent Caucasian English graduate student named Mark. Jade has to figure out how to both please her family, who would not approve of her dating a Caucasian, and be true to herself. Her older brother is already out of the picture for that very reason. Naturally, something must give sooner or later, and the facade of the perfect Chinese daughter soon begins to crumble.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Sandra Oh]] as Jade Li \n*Stephen Chang as Dad Li (Lead) (as Stephen M.D. Chang) \n*Alannah Ong as Mom Li\n*Frances You as Pearl Li\n*Johnny Mah as Andrew Chau \n*[[Callum Keith Rennie]] as Mark\n*Claudette Carracedo as Lisa Chan \n*Greg Chen as Uncle Bing \n*Mimi Mok as Mrs. Mar \n*Lesley Ewen as Carmen the Casting Director \n*Donald Fong as Ah Hong \n*Nathan Fong as Dr. Ming Chu/Bartender \n*Dennis Foon as Director  \n*Tosca Chin Wah Leong as Linda Taylor Wong, Ch. 4 News \n*Estelle Coppens as Lead Woman in Scene with Jade \n*Kevin Kelly as Lead Man in Scene with Jade\n*[[Gene Kiniski]] as Man at Bus Stop\n}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
