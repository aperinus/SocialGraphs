Jones]] with story by [[Nancy Dowd]]. It stars [[Jane Fonda]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Penelope Milford]], [[Robert Carradine]] and [[Robert Ginty]]. The film's narrative follows a perplexed woman, her [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] husband and a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] [[Vietnam War]] veteran with whom she develops a romantic relationship, while her husband is deployed in Vietnam.\n\n''Coming Home'' was theatrically released on February 15, 1978 to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised its direction, screenplay and performances, while the film grossed $36 million worldwide against its $3 million budget, becoming the [[1978 in film|15th highest-grossing film of 1978]]. It also premiered at the [[1978 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]], with Voight winning the [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Prize]].\n\nThe film received various awards and nominations. At the [[36th Golden Globe Awards]], it received six nominations including for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], with Voight and Fonda winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Best Actress]] respectively. At the [[51st Academy Awards]], it received eight nominations including for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning three; [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] with Voight and Fonda winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] respectively.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1968 [[California]], Sally ([[Jane Fonda]]), a loyal and conservative military wife, is married to Bob Hyde ([[Bruce Dern]]), a captain in the [[United States Marine Corps]], who is about to be deployed to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. As a dedicated military officer, Bob sees the deployment primarily as an opportunity for career progress. At first, Sally dreads being left alone, but after a while, she feels liberated. Forced to find housing away from the base, she moves into a new apartment by the beach and buys a sports car. With nothing else to do, she decides to volunteer at a local [[Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Administration (VA)]] hospital, partially inspired by her bohemian friend Vi Munson, whose brother Billy ([[Robert Carradine]]) has come home with [[Psychological trauma|grave emotional problems]] after just two weeks in Vietnam and now resides in the VA hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, Sally meets Luke Martin ([[Jon Voight]]), a former high-school classmate. Like his friend Billy, Luke had gone to Vietnam but came back wounded. He is recuperating at the hospital from the injuries he sustained, which left him a [[paraplegic]]. Filled with pain, anger and frustration, Luke is now [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposed to the war]]. He is at first a bitter young man, but as he is increasingly thrown into contact with Sally, a relationship starts to develop. Eventually, Luke is released from the hospital, and, newly mobile with his own wheelchair, begins to rebuild his life. His relationship with Sally deepens. She is also transformed by him, and her outlook on life starts to change. They have happy times, play at the beach and fall in love. Meanwhile, Billy, traumatized by his experiences at war, commits suicide by injecting air into his veins. Driven by Billy's suicide, Luke chains himself to the gates of a local recruitment center in a vain attempt to stop others from enlisting.\n\nSally and Luke eventually make love, confronting his handicap, with Sally experiencing her first [[orgasm]]. However, she does not seek a divorce from her husband, and both she and Luke know that their relationship will have to end when Bob returns home. Bob does return, too soon, claiming that he had accidentally wounded himself in the leg. He is also suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] stemming from what he has seen in combat. Bob discovers Sally's affair from [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]], who have been spying on Luke since the gate incident, and both Sally and Luke agree that Sally should try to patch things up with Bob. Bob loses control, confronting the lovers with a loaded rifle, but ultimately turns away. The film ends with Luke speaking to young men about his experience in Vietnam, intercut with scenes of Bob placing his neatly folded [[Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps#Dress uniform|Marine dress uniform]] on the beach, taking off his wedding ring, and swimming naked out into the ocean to commit suicide.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Sally Hyde\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Luke Martin\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as Captain Bob Hyde\n* [[Penelope Milford]] as Vi Munson\n* [[Robert Carradine]] as Bill Munson\n* [[Robert Ginty]] as Sergeant Dink Mobley\n* Mary Gregory as Martha Vickery\n* [[Kathleen Miller (actress)|Kathleen Miller]] as Kathy Delise\n* Beeson Carroll as Captain Earl Delise\n* [[Willie Tyler]] as Virgil\n* Lou Carello as Bozo\n* [[Charles Cyphers]] as Pee Wee\n* [[Olivia Cole]] as Corrine\n* [[Tresa Hughes]] as Nurse Degroot\n* [[Bruce French (actor)|Bruce French]] as Dr. Lincoln\n* [[Mary Jackson (actress)|Mary Jackson]] as Fleta Wilson\n* Tim Pelt as Jason\n* [[Richard Lawson (actor)|Richard Lawson]] as Pat\n* [[Rita Taggart]] as Johnson\n* Claudie Watson as Bridges\n* Sally Frei as Connie\n* Tony Santoro as Porsche salesman\n* [[Pat Corley]] as Harris\n* Gwen Van Dam as Mrs. Harris\n* Jim Klein as Willie Malone\n* Tokyo Ernie as Tokyo Ernie\n* Raul Bayardo as mechanic in wheelchair\n* Stacey Pickren as Sophie\n* James Kindelon and Joey Faustine as Marines at gate\n* Arthur Rosenberg as Bruce\n* [[David Clennon]] as Tim\n* Kimberly Binion as waitress go-go\n* Kirk Raymond, Bill Hale as surveillance men\n* Danny Tucker as Monty\n* Ned Van Zandt, Dennis Rucker, [[Jonathan Banks]], James Richardson as Marines at party\n* Gary Downey as intelligence officer\n* George Roberts, Bob Ott as FBI agents\n* Gary Lee Davis as Marine recruiter\n* [[Marc McClure]] as high school class president\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Coming Home'' was conceived by [[Jane Fonda]] as the first feature for her own production company, IPC Films (for Indochina Peace Campaign), with her associate producer Bruce Gilbert, a friend from her protest days. Fonda wished to make a film about the [[Vietnam War]] inspired by her friendship with [[Ron Kovic]], a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran, whom she had met at an antiwar rally.<ref name=\"Chong2011\">{{cite book|last=Chong|first=Sylvia Shin Huey|title=The Oriental Obscene: Violence and Racial Fantasies in the Vietnam Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__L1EVYu35wC&pg=PT164|date=9 November 2011|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4854-2|page=164}}</ref> At that time, Kovic had recently completed his autobiographical book ''[[Born on the Fourth of July]]'', which later became an Oscar-winning [[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|motion picture of the same name]] directed by [[Oliver Stone]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] as Kovic.\n\nIn 1972, Fonda hired [[Nancy Dowd]], a friend from her days in the feminist movement, to write a script about the consequences of the war as seen through the eyes of a military wife.<ref name=\"HillstromHillstrom1998\">{{cite book|last1=Hillstrom|first1=Kevin|last2=Hillstrom|first2=Laurie Collier|title=The Vietnam Experience: A Concise Encyclopedia of American Literature, Songs, and Films|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamexperienc0000hill|url-access=registration|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30183-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/vietnamexperienc0000hill/page/76 76]}}</ref> Originally, Dowd's story, tentatively titled ''Buffalo Ghosts'', focused on two women, volunteers at a veterans' hospital, who must come to grips with the emotional toll that the war takes on its casualties and their families. The project dragged on for six years until Gilbert and producer [[Jerome Hellman]] took it. The screenplay was reshaped significantly by the circle of talent who eventually brought it to the screen: Fonda, Ashby, Wexler, Jon Voight, producer Hellman and screenwriters [[Waldo Salt]] and [[Robert C. Jones]]. They were united by their opposition to the Vietnam War and by their concern for the veterans who were returning to America and facing difficulties adapting to life back home. [[Rudy Wurlitzer]] contributed uncredited work to the script.<ref name=\"Dawson2009\">{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Nick|title=Being Hal Ashby: Life of a Hollywood Rebel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nOQCqPz2_roC&pg=PT372|date=30 June 2009|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-3919-7|page=372}}</ref>\n\n[[John Schlesinger]], who had worked with producers Hellman and Voight on ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', was originally named the director, but he left the project after feeling uncomfortable with the subject matter.<ref name=\"Medavoy2013\">{{cite book|last=Medavoy|first=Mike|title=You're Only as Good as Your Next One: 100 Great Films, 100 Good Films, and 100 for Which I Should Be Shot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQe4nFeemPMC&pg=PA56|date=25 June 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-1813-9|page=56}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Hal Ashby]]. Fonda was cast from the beginning as Sally Hyde, the housewife. A top box-office star was sought for the male lead to offset the grim nature of the story.

Voight had participated in the anti-war movement and was a friend of Fonda, who was instrumental in helping him land the role, even though he had fallen from popularity since his ''Midnight Cowboy'' heyday. [[Bruce Dern]], long stereotyped in sadistic roles, was chosen as the husband. The screenplay was written and rewritten until the project could wait no longer. Jane Fonda, who just finished ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977), was soon to star in [[Alan J. Pakula]]'s ''[[Comes a Horseman]]'' (1978). For director Ashby, this was his second film about the 1960s, in addition to his 1975 film ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]''.\n\nAshby had cast singer-songwriter Guthrie Thomas to portray the role of Bill Munson after reviewing Thomas' screen test. Thomas joined his close friend Ashby and the entire cast at a restaurant by [[Malibu, California|Malibu Beach]] before the start of production. Thomas had been previously cast in a previous Ashby film, ''Bound for Glory'', starring [[David Carradine]]. Upon completion of the cast meeting, Thomas privately spoke with Ashby and told him, \"Hal, I am a singer-songwriter as you know and not an actor. In all fairness to you and this amazing cast you need an extremely talented actor for this role and not a poor singer. I recommend either [[Robert Carradine|Bobby Carradine]] or [[Keith Carradine]].\" Robert Carradine was cast and portrayed the role of Bill Munson.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\n* [[The Beatles]]: [[Hey Jude]], [[Strawberry Fields Forever]]; ([[EMI]] Records Inc.)\n* [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] Featuring [[Janis Joplin]]: Call On Me; ([[Columbia Records]])\n* [[Tim Buckley]]: [[Once I Was]]; ([[Elektra Records]])\n* [[Buffalo Springfield]]: [[Expecting to Fly (song)|Expecting to Fly]], [[For What It's Worth]]; ([[Atlantic Records]])\n* [[The Chambers Brothers]]: [[Time Has Come Today]]; (Columbia Records)\n* [[Bob Dylan]]: [[Just Like a Woman]]; (Columbia Records)\n* [[Aretha Franklin]]: Save Me; (Atlantic Recording Corporation)\n* [[Richie Havens]]: Follow; (M&M Records Inc.)\n* [[Jimi Hendrix]]: [[Manic Depression (song)|Manic Depression]]; (Warner Bros.

It proved popular with audiences and received generally good reviews. Charles Champlin of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented that: \"Despite an over-explicit soundtrack and some moments when the story in fact became a sermon, the movie effectively translated a changed national consciousness into credible and touching personal terms.\" The ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' called the film \"''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' c. 1978 with the same high standards and the same lofty morals of an earlier era.\"\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 28 reviews, with a rating average of 7.4/10.
