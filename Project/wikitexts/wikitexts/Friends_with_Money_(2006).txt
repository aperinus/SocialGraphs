It opened the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, 2006, and went into limited release in [[North America]] on April 7, 2006.\n\n==Plot==\nOlivia is a single, always broke woman who cleans houses in [[Los Angeles]] to make ends meet.  She is in a group of wealthy friends consisting of: Franny &ndash; a stay at home mom with a large [[trust fund]], Christine &ndash; a television writer, Jane &ndash; a fashion designer, and their husbands.\n\nWhile the disparity in financial situations between Olivia and her friends creates some friction, each woman is facing her own individual struggles. Olivia can't seem to find love or money.  Franny's inheritance sometimes causes tension between her and her accountant husband, who likes to spend it. Christine's marriage is falling apart. Jane is increasingly unpleasant because she's not growing old gracefully. Together, these women attend charity benefits, have lunch, lean on each other, and wade their way through life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Jennifer Aniston]] as Olivia\n*[[Catherine Keener]] as Christine\n*[[Frances McDormand]] as Jane\n*[[Joan Cusack]] as Franny\n*[[Jason Isaacs]] as David\n*[[Scott Caan]] as Mike\n*[[Simon McBurney]] as Aaron\n*[[Greg Germann]] as Matt\n*[[Marin Hinkle]] as Maya\n*[[Timm Sharp]] as Richard\n*[[Jake Cherry]] as Wyatt\n*[[Ty Burrell]] as Other Aaron\n*[[Bob Stephenson (actor)|Bob Stephenson]] as Marty\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Box office==\nIn its opening weekend in wide release, the film grossed a total of $4.96 million, ranking tenth at the North American [[box office]], this soon became $13,367,101 domestically and $18,245,244 worldwide even though it received a limited release in most weeks (under 600 screens).\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics.
