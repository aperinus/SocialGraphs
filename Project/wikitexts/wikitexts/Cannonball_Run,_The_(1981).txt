Filmed in [[Panavision]], it features an all-star ensemble cast, including [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Roger Moore]], [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Dean Martin]]. The film is based on the 1979 running of an [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash|actual cross-country outlaw road race]] in the United States, beginning in [[Connecticut]] and ending in [[California]].\n\nIt was one of 1981's most successful films at the box office. It was followed by ''[[Cannonball Run II]]'' (1984), and ''[[Speed Zone]]'' (1989). ''Cannonball Run'' and the 1984 sequel were the final film appearances of actor Dean Martin. It also featured Jackie Chan in his second Hollywood role.\n\n==Plot==\nRace teams have gathered in Connecticut to start a cross-country car race. One at a time, teams drive up to the starters' stand, punch a time card to indicate their time of departure, then take off.\n\nAmong the teams:\n* JJ McClure, a famous racing driver and team owner, and Victor Prinzi, his chief mechanic and occasional co-driver, drive a [[Dodge B-series van|Dodge Tradesman]] [[ambulance]] fitted with a NASCAR engine.\n* Former F1 icon (and Scotch-swilling) Jamie Blake and his (gambling-obsessed) teammate Morris Fenderbaum, dressed as Catholic priests, drive a red [[Ferrari 308 GTB|Ferrari 308 GTS]] 1979. \n* Jill Rivers and Marcie Thatcher, two attractive women who use their looks to their advantage, start the race in a black [[Lamborghini Countach]].\n* Two drivers race in a high-tech, computer-laden [[Subaru Leone#2nd generation|Subaru GL 4WD]] hatchback with a rocket booster engine.\n* A pair of good ol' boys, drive a street-legal replica of [[Donnie Allison]]'s [[Hawaiian Tropic]]-sponsored [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup Series]] [[Chevrolet]] [[stock car]] owned by [[Hoss Ellington]]. \n* Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., a rich British playboy who believes himself to be [[Roger Moore]], who drives a silver [[Aston Martin DB5]].\n* A wealthy oil-rich Middle-Eastern [[sheikh]], driving a white [[Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow]].\n\nAt the starting line, observing from the shadows, is Mr. Arthur J. Foyt, a representative of the \"Safety Enforcement Unit\", who tries to stop the race because of its environmental effects and safety issues. In the car with Foyt is a photographer and tree lover, Pamela Glover.\n\nBeyond the starting line, JJ and Victor (driving their ambulance) come across Foyt and Glover, who have been involved in a minor accident. Glover implores JJ and Victor to help, but when they tell Foyt to enter the ambulance through the back door, they kidnap Glover and take off without Foyt.\n\nAs the race progresses, Victor occasionally turns into his alter ego, superhero \"Captain Chaos\". Dr. Van Helsing and his huge hypodermic needle are also in the ambulance to \"help\" keep Glover quiet during the race.\n\nVarious teams are shown either evading law enforcement, most of which deal with talking their way out of a possible ticket, or concocting crazy schemes to outmaneuver their opponents.\n* Jill and Marcie use sex appeal as their weapon, unzipping their race suits to display copious amounts of cleavage during traffic stops. \n* In New Jersey, the ambulance is pulled over by state troopers. Dr. Van Helsing drugs Glover, and JJ and Victor are able to convince the troopers that they are rushing \"the Senator's wife\" to [[UCLA]] for medical treatment (offering the theory, which to JJ and Victor's happy surprise is Van Helsing's idea, that her condition prevents them from flying, or from even driving through [[Denver]]).\n* The Subaru team is able to turn off their car's headlights and use infrared sensors for racing at night.\n* Seymour Goldfarb is frequently shown evading police by using various James Bond-type gadgets, such as oil slicks, smoke screens, switchable license plates, all installed in his [[Aston Martin DB5]].\n* Mr. Compton and \"Super Chief\" Finch disguise themselves as a newlywed couple on a motorcycle, but Finch's extra weight forces the two to ride cross-country in a continuous [[wheelie]].\n\nThe primary rivalry is between the ambulance and the Ferrari. In Ohio, Fenderbaum and Blake are able to convince Victor to stop the ambulance in order to bless the patient on board. While Blake administers the blessing, Fenderbaum flattens one of the ambulance's rear tires. JJ achieves revenge in Missouri by convincing a nearby police officer that the two men dressed as priests are actually Communists and sex perverts who are responsible for the [[Indecent exposure|flashing]] victim in the ambulance.\n\nThe leading teams find themselves stopped on a desert highway, waiting for construction workers to clear the road. A biker gang arrives and harasses Compton and Finch. It quickly escalates into a melee. \"Captain Chaos\" emerges to fight the bikers. The Subaru team also joins the fight. The construction crew announces that the road is open, so the teams sprint back to their cars to resume the race.\n\nThe ambulance falls behind the pack until Victor once again becomes Captain Chaos. The vehicles all arrive at the final destination at the same time, resulting in a foot race to the finish line. JJ hands his team's time card to Victor, then ambushes the remaining racers, leaving only Victor and one of the Lamborghini women, Marcie. Just when it appears Victor will reach the time clock first, a spectator shouts that her \"baby\" has fallen into the water. Victor, still in his Captain Chaos persona, rushes to save the baby (later revealed to be the spectator's dog), allowing Marcie to clock in first and win the race.\n\nJJ is furious and never wants to see Captain Chaos again, but Victor replies that he does not care, becoming the persona he really wants to be, Captain USA. JJ laughs and hugs him. Foyt reappears and blames everyone for ruining the American highway. Seymour offers a cigar and tells Foyt to use the lighter in his car, which activates an [[ejection seat]] when pushed. Nothing happens at first, but when Seymour presses the button, he (Seymour) goes flying into the water.\n\n==Cast==\n''Cannonball Run'' featured an all-star [[ensemble cast]], including these actors:<ref>{{cite book|title=Film and Television In-Jokes|author=Bill van Heerden|page=318|year=1998|publisher=McFarland & Co.|isbn=978-0-7864-3894-5}}</ref>\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Dom DeLuise]] as racer J.J. McClure and his buddy, mechanic Victor Prinzi, a.k.a. Captain Chaos.\n* [[Roger Moore]] as Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., a self-parody of his role as [[James Bond]]. His car, an [[Aston Martin DB5]], displays the UK registration plate 6633 PP, although Moore's Bond never actually drove an Aston Martin in any of his seven Bond appearances. The original UK registration plate was BMT 216A before being sold to businessman Gavin Keyzar. [[Molly Picon]] portrays his mother. Several women ride with Seymour, including model [[Lois Hamilton]], billed as Lois Areno.\n* [[Farrah Fawcett]] as tree-loving photographer Pamela Glover. J.J. calls her \"Beauty\".\n* [[Dean Martin]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] as race car driver Jamie Blake and scam artist Morris Fenderbaum, disguised as Catholic priests. [[Jimmy Snyder (sports commentator)|Jimmy \"The Greek\" Snyder]] plays himself as Fenderbaum bets on his success (Snyder was Dean Martin's neighbor when both were growing up in [[Steubenville, Ohio]]). Blake's car, a [[Ferrari 308 GTS]] 1979, is the same as the model in the TV series TV ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''.\n* [[George Furth]] as Arthur J. Foyt, the insipid, uptight main antagonist of the film, who tries to have the race stopped.\n* [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Michael Hui]] as drivers of a [[Subaru GL]] filled with gadgets. In the opening part of the film, Chan and Hui are introduced on a talk show (hosted by [[Johnny Yune]]) as the operators of Japan's entry into the race. Both Chan and Hui are actually Chinese. \n* [[Jamie Farr]] as Sheik Abdul ben Falafel, a wealthy [[Arab]]ian potentate determined to win the race, even if he has to buy it. [[Bianca Jagger]] makes a brief appearance as his sister. Farr's car is a [[Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow]]. The Sheik is the only character to appear in all three ''Cannonball Run'' films.\n* [[Mel Tillis]] and [[Terry Bradshaw]] are Mel and Terry, a couple of \"[[wikt:good old boy|good ol' boys]]\" driving a 1976 Chevrolet Chevelle Laguna NASCAR Hawaiian Tropic replica, then, at the start of the race they have a Monte Carlo.\n* [[Adrienne Barbeau]] and [[Tara Buckman]] as Marcie Thatcher and Jill Rivers, satin-[[Spandex]]-clad \"hotties\" in a black [[Lamborghini Countach]]. The same Lamborghini was used in the film's opening credits as it was being pursued by a [[Nevada Highway Patrol]] car. Their character names are not mentioned during the story but appear in the end credits. Their names return in the sequel, though the parts were re-cast. \n* [[Valerie Perrine]] has a cameo as a state trooper. \n* [[Peter Fonda]] has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo role]] referencing his character in ''[[The Wild Angels]]''. The appearance of Fonda and his motorcycle gang during a halt in the race offered an excuse for Chan to demonstrate his martial arts skills during the fight sequence. Fonda's big, bald biker buddy is played by [[Robert Tessier]].\n* [[Bert Convy]] as wealthy but bored executive Bradford Compton, who planned to run the Cannonball by motorcycle with the help of an old friend, Shakey Finch ([[Warren Berlinger]]), once the world's greatest cross-country motorcyclist. The two planned to disguise themselves as newlyweds. Compton's now portly ally forced them into a [[wheelie]] for the entire race.\n* [[Jack Elam]] as Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, same name as the [[Abraham Van Helsing|famous vampire hunter]]. This Van Helsing is a [[Colorectal surgery|proctologist]] and graduate of the [[University of Yangon|University of Rangoon]], and the Knoxville, Tennessee College of [[Faith healing|Faith Healing]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Girardot|first=Frank|title=Frank Girardot: Jackson's 'doctor' embodies wrong prescription|url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_18998780|access-date=27 March 2012|newspaper=Pasadena Star News|date=2011-09-28|quote=\"I'm Dr. Nicholas Van Helsing, doctor of proctology and other related tendencies.

[[Jackie Chan]] says this inspired him to do the same at the end of most of his films.\n\n===Original race===\nThe film is based on the 1979 running of the [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]], an actual cross-country outlaw road race held four times in the 1970s, starting at the Red Ball Garage on 31st Street in New York City (later the Lock, Stock and Barrel Restaurant in Darien, [[Connecticut]]) and ending at the Portofino Inn in [[Redondo Beach, California]], in Los Angeles.\n\nThe screenwriter was automotive journalist [[Brock Yates]], who had conceived the real-life Cannonball Baker event. Yates had originally proposed the race as a writer for ''[[Car and Driver]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webspace.webring.com/people/wb/belialprod/brockyates.htm|title=Brock Yates|access-date=2011-05-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921032725/http://webspace.webring.com/people/wb/belialprod/brockyates.htm|archive-date=2012-09-21}}</ref> The race had only one rule: \"All competitors will drive any vehicle of their choosing, over any route, at any speed they judge practical, between the starting point and destination. The competitor finishing with the lowest elapsed time is the winner\".\n\nYates' team was the only participant in the original 1971 running, which was named after the driver Ernest \"Cannonball\" Baker, who drove across country in 1927 and made it in 60 hours. Yates wrote a book about it called ''The Sunday Driver''. In 1973 it was reported [[John G. Avildsen]] and writer Eugene Price was to make a film based on the book called ''The Cannonball-Baker-Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Richard Goes to Lilliput|author=Weiler, A H.|work=The New York Times|date=Jan 21, 1973|page=A13}}</ref> The film was not made but the race did inspire the (unrelated) 1976 films ''[[Cannonball (film)|Cannonball]]'' and ''[[The Gumball Rally]]''.\n\n====1979 race====\nIn the March 1979 race Yates formed one of 46 teams with director Hal Needham to compete with a 150-MPH van converted into an ambulance, with LA doctor Lyell Royer, and Brock's second wife, Pamela Reynolds, riding as the patient on the gurney.

The ambulance was stopped once, in Pennsylvania; that event made it into the movie, as did a cop stopping traffic in Kansas, exiting from a rodeo, to let the ambulance pass unimpeded.<ref>''Hollywood Stuntman Hal Needham Plays Not My Job'', National Public Radio's 'Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me', April 30, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe Right Bra team was put together by rail-thin auto writer Judy Stropus, race driver [[Donna Mae Mims]] and Peggy Niemcek, whose husband was part of another entry, driving a Cadillac limo. In the movie, it became a two-woman team led by buxom [[Adrienne Barbeau]] driving a Lamborghini, but as auto writer Stropus said decades later, \"a little editorial license never hurt anyone\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/features/the-cannonball-run-turns-35.html|title=35 Years Ago, the Original Cannonball Run Took The Green Flag|access-date=2011-05-14|archive-date=2011-09-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916080646/http://www.insideline.com/features/the-cannonball-run-turns-35.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Yates points out in his book ''Cannonball!''<ref>Cannonball! by Brock Yates, MotorBooks International, 2003</ref> that Stropus's version of the race does not mention the baptism with green fluid from the porta-potty the three girls experienced when the limo overturned.\n\n===Script===\nThe characters J.J. and Victor participate in the Cannonball Run in an [[ambulance]]: a heavily modified [[Dodge Ram van|Dodge van]]. In the beginning, J.J. says to himself \"we could get a black [[Pontiac Trans Am|Trans Am]]\", then answers his own question with \"Nah that's been done\", a reference to the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' films of Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham.\n\nIn an attempt to appear legitimate to law enforcement, the team of J.J. and Victor hires Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing, a frightening, yet friendly, [[physician]] of questionable skill played by [[Jack Elam]]. They kidnap attractive young photographer Pamela Glover ([[Farrah Fawcett]]) \u2014 whom they nickname \"Beauty\" \u2014 to be their cover patient. Beauty vehemently opposes her kidnapping first, but eventually comes to sympathize with her captors and fall for J.J.\n\n===Development===\nYates and Needham worked on a script and Al Ruddy became attached as producer. They wanted Reynolds to star, but he was reluctant to make more car-themed films. He was eventually persuaded by Needham's promise to keep the actor's schedule to only 14 days of filming, and a fee of $5 million plus a percentage of the profits. Finance came from [[Raymond Chow]] of Golden Harvest, who requested that Jackie Chan be included in the cast.\n\nReynolds later said: \"I did that film for all the wrong reasons. I never liked it. I did it to help out a friend of mine, Hal Needham. And I also felt it was immoral to turn down that kind of money. I suppose I sold out so I couldn't really object to what people wrote about me\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Burt Reynolds: --Getting Behind the Camera Burt Reynolds Behind The Lens|author=STEPHEN FARBER|date=Dec 20, 1981|work=The New York Times|page=D17}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Anchor|Box office}}\n\n===Box office===\nA huge commercial success, ''The Cannonball Run'' opened June 19, 1981 on 1,673 screens and grossed $11,765,574 in its opening weekend,<ref name=\"mojo\"/> the fourth highest opening of all-time, but this was not enough to beat ''[[Superman II]]'' that opened the same weekend with a record-breaking $14,100,523.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=October 27, 1987|page=46|title=Biggest North American Film Boxoffice Weekends In History|last=Murphy|first=A.D}}</ref> The film went on to gross $72,179,579 in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cannonballrun.htm |title= Cannonball Run |publisher= IMDB |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= March 9, 2012 |archive-date= January 29, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120129193652/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=cannonballrun.htm |url-status= live}}</ref> making it the [[1981 in film|sixth highest-grossing film of 1981]], behind ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'', ''Superman II'', ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'', and ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&sort=gross&order=DESC&&p=.htm |title= 1981 Domestic Grosses |publisher= IMDB |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= March 9, 2012 |archive-date= January 30, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120130131002/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&sort=gross&order=DESC&&p=.htm |url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIt was also successful overseas.

The original stunt person had left the production to attend an emergency family illness, and the stunt coordinator [[Bobby Bass]] called his then-fianc\u00e9e von Beltz to the set for a stunt that he said was to be \"a piece of cake\". The car was to be driven by stuntman Jimmy Nickerson, and required him to weave between oncoming vehicles. Meanwhile, von Beltz was asked to ride in the passenger seat, operating a smoke machine, giving the impression the car was on fire.\n\nThe car, an Aston Martin, had been beset with mechanical problems, including defective steering, clutch, and speedometer. It also had bald tires and no seat belts. Nickerson asked for repairs to the car, and while some were done, other things were left unfixed, including the lack of seatbelts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/10/heidi-von-beltz-dead-stuntwoman-paralyzed-cannonball-run-crash-1201597841/|title=Heidi von Beltz Dies: Stuntwoman Paralyzed In 'Cannonball Run' Crash Was 59|access-date=2016-03-07|archive-date=2016-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224041356/http://deadline.com/2015/10/heidi-von-beltz-dead-stuntwoman-paralyzed-cannonball-run-crash-1201597841/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/suffering-continues-paralyzed-ex-stuntwoman-24670|title=Suffering continues for paralyzed ex-stuntwoman|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=2016-03-07|archive-date=2016-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318173905/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/suffering-continues-paralyzed-ex-stuntwoman-24670|url-status=live}}</ref> During the planned stunt the car collided head-on with a van, breaking von Beltz's neck and leaving her quadriplegic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exponent.com/cannonball_run/|title=Cannonball Run Accident|access-date=2011-04-25|archive-date=2011-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927100328/http://www.exponent.com/cannonball_run/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen it became clear that von Beltz's personal injury lawsuit would exceed all available primary insurance coverage, the production's excess insurer, Interstate Fire (a subsidiary of Hollywood's favorite insurer, [[Fireman's Fund Insurance Company]]) sued von Beltz and her employer, Stuntman Inc., for a declaratory judgment that von Beltz's lawsuit was not covered under its policy. In 1988, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled that there ''was'' a [[duty to defend]], and that there was also a duty to indemnify to the extent that von Beltz was seeking recovery for mental injuries (the exclusion for bodily injuries was ruled to be enforceable).<ref>''Interstate Fire & Cas.
