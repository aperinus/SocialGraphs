The film stars [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as writer [[Dorothy Parker]] and depicts the members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]], a group of writers, actors and critics who met almost every weekday from 1919 to 1929 at Manhattan's [[Algonquin Hotel]].\n\nThe film was an Official Selection at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. The film was a critical but not a commercial success. Leigh won the [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress]].\n\n[[Peter Benchley]], who plays editor [[Frank Crowninshield]], was the grandson of humorist [[Robert Benchley]], who once worked underneath Crowninshield.

He began work on a screenplay with novelist and former ''[[The Washington Star|Washington Star]]'' journalist Randy Sue Coburn about legendary writer [[Dorothy Parker]]. In 1992, Rudolph attended a Fourth of July party hosted by filmmaker [[Robert Altman]] who introduced him to actress [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Rudolph was surprised by her physical resemblance to Parker and was impressed by her knowledge of the [[Jazz Age]]. Leigh was so committed to doing the film that she agreed to make it for \"a tenth of what I normally get for a film\".<ref name=\"carpenter\" />\n\nThe screenplay originally focused on the platonic relationship between Parker and Robert Benchley, but this did not appeal to any financial backers.<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> There still was no interest even when Altman came on board as producer. The emphasis on Parker was the next change to the script, but Rudolph still had no luck finding financing for \"a period biography of a literate woman.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Altman used his clout to persuade [[Fine Line Features]] and [[Miramax]]\u2014two studios he was making films for\u2014to team, with the former releasing ''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' domestically and the latter handling foreign distribution.<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Altman claimed that he forced the film to be made by putting his own money into it, adding,  \"I put other projects of mine hostage to it. I did a lot of lying\".<ref name=\"weinraub\">{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | title = Robert Altman, Very Much A Player Again | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 29, 1993 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/movies/robert-altman-very-much-a-player-again.html?scp=3&sq= | accessdate = 2010-05-26 }}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nRudolph shot the film in [[Montreal]] because the building facades in its old city most closely resembled period New York City.<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Full financing was not acquired until four weeks into principal photography.<ref name=\"EW\" />\n\nThe film's large cast followed Leigh's lead and agreed to work for much lower than their usual salaries. Rudolph invited them to write their own dialogue, which resulted in a chaotic first couple of days of principal photography. Actor [[Campbell Scott]] remembered \"Everyone hung on to what they knew about their characters and just sort of threw it out there.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> Actress [[Jennifer Beals]] discussed this in her appearance on the [[Jon Favreau]] program ''[[Dinner for Five]]'', where she stated that while much dialogue was improvised in the style of the real-life characters the actors were playing, many of these characters were not integral to the plot. As such, many of the actors had much larger parts that were edited down to nearly nothing in the film\u2019s final cut. \n\nDuring the film\u2019s 40-day shoot, the cast stayed in a run-down hotel dubbed Camp Rudolph and engaged in all-night poker games. Leigh chose not to participate in these activities, preferring to stay in character on and off camera. She did a great amount of research for the role and said \"I wanted to be as close to her as I possibly could.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" /> To this end, Leigh stayed at the [[Algonquin Hotel]] for a week and read Parker's entire body of work. In addition, the actress listened repeatedly to the two existing audio recordings of Parker in order to perfect the writer's distinctive voice. Leigh found that Parker \"had a sensibility that I understand very, very well. A sadness. A depression.\"<ref name=\"carpenter\" />\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has a {{RT data|score}} approval rating based on {{RT data|count}} reviews, with an average score of {{RT data|average}}.\nA rough cut of ''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' was screened at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]] where it divided film critics.
