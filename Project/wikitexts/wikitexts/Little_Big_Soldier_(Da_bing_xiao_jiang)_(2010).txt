Millions of lives perished, and those who survived had only two choices \u2013 kill or be killed.\n\nThe battalions of warring states [[Wei (state)|Liang]] and [[Wey (state)|Wey]] collided in a bloodbath that lasted from dawn until dusk. Only two men were left standing \u2013 a foot soldier from Liang and the rival General from Wey. The Soldier survived because he is an expert in playing dead, with a device strapped on his body which protruded like an arrowhead for added realism.\n\nThe Soldier captured the wounded General, hoping to use the enemy as his ticket to freedom \u2013 by handing the General to the Liang warlord, the Soldier could be honorably discharged and return home to his peaceful life. The young General, though taken captive, was condescending towards the Soldier.

[[Joan Lin]], Chan's wife, suggested their son [[Jaycee Chan]], but Chan was highly against it.
