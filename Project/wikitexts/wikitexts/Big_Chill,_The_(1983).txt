The plot focuses on a group of [[baby boomer]]s who attended the [[University of Michigan]], reuniting after 15 years when their friend Alex dies by suicide. [[Kevin Costner]] was cast as Alex, but all scenes showing his face were cut. It was filmed in [[Beaufort, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite news |last=McDermott |first=John |title=South Carolina mansion featured in \"Big Chill,\" \"Great Santini\" is sold |url=http://www.postandcourier.com/business/south-carolina-mansion-featured-in-big-chill-great-santini-is/article_a0edcc1e-2140-11e7-a55a-837c6fca43e4.html |work=Post and Courier |date=October 29, 2017 |access-date=October 29, 2017}} It was also filmed in Hampton County, SC.</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack features [[soul music|soul]], [[R&B]], and [[pop-rock]] music from the 1960s and 1970s, including tracks by [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[The Temptations]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[Three Dog Night]].\n\n''The Big Chill'' was adapted for television as the short-lived series ''[[Hometown (American TV series)|Hometown]]''. Later, it influenced the TV series ''[[thirtysomething]]'' and ''[[A Million Little Things]]''.<ref name = museum>{{cite news |title=Thirtysomething |first=Susan |last=Emmanuel |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/T/htmlT/thirtysomethi/thirtysomethi.htm |publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] |access-date=May 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter Alex Marshall commits suicide, his fellow [[University of Michigan]] alumni and close friends attend his funeral at the Tidalholm plantation in [[Beaufort, South Carolina]]. During the visit, everyone stays with Sarah and Harold Cooper.\n\nThe other friends; Sam Weber, a television actor; Meg Jones, once a [[Public defender (United States)|public defender]] and now a real estate attorney; Michael Gold, a journalist for [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]; former talk-radio psychologist Nick Carlton, an impotent [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam vet]] perpetually either stoned or high on drugs; and Karen Bowen, an unfulfilled writer unhappily married to Richard, a stuffy advertising executive. Also present is Chloe, Alex's younger girlfriend of four months.\n\nWhile out jogging early the next morning, Harold, violating [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] rules, tells Nick that a large corporation is about to buy his small company, which will make him rich and triple the value of the stock. He told Alex, making it possible for him to buy property in the area. Harold suggests Nick use the tip to get into a new line of work. During their conversation, it is revealed that Sarah and Alex had a brief affair five years earlier, which all the friends knew about. Nick comforts Harold by saying she didn't marry Alex. Harold, Sarah, and Alex moved past it, but Sarah tells Karen her friendship with Alex was harmed by the affair.\n\nRichard goes home the next day, but Karen stays. Harold, Nick, Michael, and Chloe drive out to see the old house that Chloe and Alex were renovating. Meanwhile, Meg tells Sarah she is fed up with failed relationships and intends to have a child on her own. Believing she is ovulating, she plans to ask Sam to be the father of her child. (She approaches Nick first, thus becoming the last to know about his war wound.) Michael, who continually flirts with Chloe, needs investors for a New York nightclub. At dinner, Sarah becomes tearful and wonders if their fervent '60s idealism was \"just fashion.\" Later that night, Meg approaches Sam, but he declines, feeling fatherhood is too great a responsibility as he already has an estranged child. Nick shares his drugs, with varying effects.\n\nThe next day, Harold buys running shoes for everyone. Nick goes to the old house and sits on the porch for hours, missing the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan football]] game. Michael offers to sire Meg's child, alluding to their one time encounter in college.\n\nDuring a half-time game of touch football, a local police officer escorts a sullen Nick back to the house after he runs a red light and becomes belligerent. Recognizing Sam, the officer offers to drop charges if he will hop into Nick's [[Porsche 911]] the way his J.T. Lancer character does on TV. Sam tries and fails, injuring himself slightly. Nick angers Harold by accusing him of being friendly with cops. Harold chastises Nick, reminding him that this is his home and Nick's recklessness could put his reputation in danger.\n\nKaren tells a surprised Sam that she is in love with him and wants to leave Richard. He tells her his first marriage failed because of boredom and he doesn't want her to make the same mistake. Feeling led on, Karen angrily stomps off.\n\nMeg tells Sarah that Michael is the wrong choice. Sarah observes the warm phone conversation between her young daughter and Meg. Later, the group, confused over Alex's death, regrets losing touch with him. To everyone but Sam, it seems that Alex withdrew deliberately. Nick is particularly cynical and bitter about life, love, and friendship. Karen follows Sam outside to mollify him, and they have sex. Sarah pulls Harold aside, embracing him, telling him she has a favor to ask: \"It's about Meg...\" Meg goes to him and they make love, tenderly. Chloe asks Nick to spend the night in the room she shared with Alex.\n\nThe next morning, Harold announces that Nick and Chloe will stay on to renovate the old house. Karen packs to return home to Richard. Michael ditches his nightclub plans. Nick shows everyone an old column that Michael wrote about Alex declining a prestigious fellowship. As the friends prepare to depart, Michael jokingly tells the Coopers they have taken a secret vote: They are never leaving.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Sam Weber\n* [[Glenn Close]] as Dr. Sarah Cooper\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Michael Gold\n* [[William Hurt]] as Nick Carlton\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Harold Cooper\n* [[Mary Kay Place]] as Meg Jones\n* [[Meg Tilly]] as Chloe\n* [[JoBeth Williams]] as Karen Bowens\n* [[Don Galloway]] as Richard Bowens\n* James Gillis as minister\n* Ken Place as Peter, the cop\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Alex Marshall (the unseen dead friend)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nLawrence Kasdan and Barbara Benedek began writing ''The Big Chill'' in September 1980 after seeing ''[[Return of the Secaucus 7]]''. They wrote the screenplay as a semi-autobiographical story inspired by their optimistic political activism while attending university in the 1960s and then their disillusionment at society in the 1970s. They wrote the screenplay while Kasdan was directing ''[[Body Heat]]'', and many of the cast members from that film agreed to appear in ''The Big Chill'' if it was completed. Kasdan first pitched the story to [[The Ladd Company]] but was rejected. Richard Fischoff unsuccessfully tried to convince [[Paramount Pictures]] to film the screenplay after reading it in the summer of 1982. When this failed he turned the screenplay to [[Marcia Nasatir]], who had recently departed her executive positions at [[United Artists]] and [[Orion Pictures]] to cofound [[Carson Productions]] with [[Johnny Carson]]. Fischoff convinced Nasatir to finance the film as the studio's first production, and took over as supervising producer after she left the studio to work at [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=The Big Chill|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/57852|access-date=2022-02-10|website=catalog.afi.com}}</ref>\n\nProduction on the film began on November 8, 1982, in [[Atlanta]]. Filming primarily took place at the Edgar Fripp House (called \"Tidalholm\") in downtown Beaufort, South Carolina, where the film was set.<ref name=\":0\" /> JoBeth Williams later recalled filming a scene flashing back to the characters in 1968. \"It was just wonderful to shoot\", she said. \"They rented this big house in Atlanta and installed bead curtains, rock posters, incense, 1968 ''Life'' magazines\u2014it was a real time warp.\" Williams says that, in the scene, her character was living with William Hurt's character and ignoring Tom Berenger's. The Alex character, played by [[Kevin Costner]] \"looking like a scruffy [[James Dean]]\", was also in the scene. \"That turned out to be the problem... Nobody could live up to that role after the build-up through the film, and audiences said they didn't want to see anybody try. So the last 10 minutes of the film were just cut out.\"<ref>\"Thrills, chills & spills\", Godfrey, Stephen, ''The Globe and Mail'', October 20, 1984: E.1.</ref> Filming concluded on February 7, 1983.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', the film has an approval rating of 71% based on reviews from 41 critics, with an average rating of 6.2/10.

Right Now: give me peace, give me justice, gimme good lovin'. For them, in the voluptuous bloom of youth, the '60s was a banner you could carry aloft or wrap yourself inside. A verdant anarchy of politics, sex, drugs, and style carpeted the landscape. And each impulse was scored to the rollick of the new music: folk, rock, pop, R&B. The armies of the night marched to Washington, but they boogied to Liverpool and Motown.

Alex was a charismatic prodigy of science and friendship and progressive hell raising who opted out of academe to try social work, then manual labor, then suicide.

It has all the right moves. It knows all the right words. Its characters have all the right clothes, expressions, fears, lusts, and ambitions. But there's no payoff and it doesn't lead anywhere.
