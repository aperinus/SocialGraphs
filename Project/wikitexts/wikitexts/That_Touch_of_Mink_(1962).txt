There, she is subjected to the unwanted advances of Beasley, the clerk she deals with who only wants to bed her. She meets Philip Shayne after his [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls Royce]] splashes her dress with mud while she is on her way to a job interview. Philip sees her outside and wants to make up for the incident.\n\nPhilip proposes a romantic affair, while Cathy is holding out for marriage. Watching from the sidelines are Philip's financial manager, Roger, who sees a therapist, because he feels guilty about helping his boss with his numerous conquests, and Cathy's roommate, Connie Emerson, who knows what Philip is seeking. In a minor subplot, Roger discusses the events as they occur to his therapist Dr. Gruber, who is not in the room when Cathy is mentioned. As a result, his therapist believes that Roger is considering a homosexual relationship with Philip.\n\nPhilip wines and dines Cathy. He takes her to see the [[New York Yankees]] play baseball. They watch from the Yankees dugout (he owns part of the team). Cathy's complaints about the umpire while seated alongside [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Roger Maris]], and [[Yogi Berra]] (playing themselves) cause umpire [[Art Passarella]] to throw all of them out of the game.\n\nPhilip's conscience weighs on him, so he withdraws an invitation to [[Bermuda]], which only serves to make Cathy, indignant about the assumption that she would not go, agree to. While in Bermuda, anxiety-ridden over the evening's sexual implications, Cathy comes down with a nervous rash, much to her embarrassment and his frustration.\n\nThe Bermuda trip is repeated, but this time Cathy drinks to soothe her nerves and ends up drunk. While intoxicated, Cathy falls off the balcony onto an awning below. She is then carried in her pajamas through the crowded hotel lobby.\n\nAt the urging of Roger and Connie, who are convinced that Philip is in love with her, Cathy goes on a date with Beasley, whom she dislikes, to make Philip jealous. Her plan succeeds and she and Philip get married. On their honeymoon, he breaks out in a nervous rash himself. The film ends with Cathy and Philip months later, walking with their baby and Roger through a park. The two leave Roger alone with the baby for a few moments, during which time Dr. Gruber approaches him to ask how things are going with Philip. In response, Roger joyously displays the baby, causing another misunderstanding with his therapist.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Philip Shayne\n* [[Doris Day]] as Cathy Timberlake\n* [[Gig Young]] as Roger\n* [[Audrey Meadows]] as Connie\n* [[Alan Hewitt]] as Dr. Gruber, Roger's therapist\n* [[John Astin]] as Everett Beasley\n* [[Dick Sargent|Richard Sargent]] as Harry Clark\n* [[Joey Faye]] as short man\n* [[Laurie Mitchell]] as showgirl\n* [[John Fiedler]] as Mr. Smith\n* [[Willard Sage]] as Tom Hodges\n* [[Jack Livesey]] as Dr. Richardson\n* [[Yogi Berra]] as himself (uncredited)\n* [[Mickey Mantle]] as himself (uncredited)\n* [[Roger Maris]] as himself (uncredited)\n* [[Dorothy Abbott]] as stewardess (uncredited)\n* [[Richard Deacon (actor)|Richard Deacon]] as Mr. Miller (uncredited)\n* [[William Lanteau]] as Leonard (uncredited)\n* [[Ralph Manza]] as cab driver (uncredited)\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCary Grant was a big fan of ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Audrey Meadows in particular, and was responsible for getting her the part of Connie.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\nIn her autobiography, Doris Day wrote that Cary Grant was very professional and exacting with details, helping her with her wardrobe choices for the film and decorating the library set with his own books from home. However, he was a completely private person, totally reserved, and very distant. Their relationship on this film was amicable, but totally devoid of give-and-take.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n[[File:Citro\u00ebn DS19 Cabriolet par Chapron - 1961 - Mondial de l'Automobile de Paris 2018 - 001.jpg|thumb|right|190px|1961 [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] 19 D\u00e9capotable Usine]]\nWhen Roger (Gig Young) is showing Cathy (Doris Day) the list of potential husbands for her, one of the names on the list is [[Rock Hudson]], Day's co-star in ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'', ''[[Lover Come Back (1961 film)|Lover Come Back]]'', and ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]''.

In any event, the novel is written in the first person, from the POV of Doris Day's character Cathy Timberlake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1962]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0056575}}\n* {{AllMovie title|49292}}\n* {{AFI film|18745}}\n* {{TCMDb title|92724}}\n\n{{Delbert Mann}}\n{{GoldenGlobeBestMotionPictureMusicalComedy 1961-1980}}\n\n[[Category:1962 films]]\n[[Category:1962 romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s English-language films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy films]]\n[[Category:Best Musical or Comedy Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Delbert Mann]]\n[[Category:Films scored by George Duning]]\n[[Category:Films set in Bermuda]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Bronx]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:1960s American films]]"}]}}}}
