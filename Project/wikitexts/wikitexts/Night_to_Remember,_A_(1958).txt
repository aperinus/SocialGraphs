Among the passengers boarding for her maiden voyage to New York are first class passengers Sir Richard and Lady Richard, second class passengers Mr. Clarke and Mrs. Clarke, a young newlywed couple, and steerage passengers Pat Murphy, Martin Gallagher and James Farrel. On 10 April, ''Titanic'' sails from Southampton. On 14 April, in the Atlantic, the ship receives a number of ice warnings from other steamers. Only a few of the messages are relayed to Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]], who orders a lookout.\n\nLater that night, the [[SS Californian|SS ''Californian'']] spots float ice in the distance, and tries to send a message to ''Titanic''. Meanwhile, steerage passengers on ''Titanic'' enjoy a party in Third Class where Murphy becomes attracted to a young Polish girl and dances with her. In the wireless room, operators [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] and [[Harold Sydney Bride]] are changing shifts. Phillips receives an ice warning, but when more messages arrive for him to send out, the warning is lost under them. On the ''Californian'', field ice is spotted. The ship stops due to the danger, and a message is sent to ''Titanic''. Because the ''Californian'' is so close, the message is very loud, and Phillips cuts it off abruptly. ''Titanic''{{'}}s passengers begin to settle in for the night.\n\nSuddenly, the vessel collides with an iceberg. Captain Smith sends for [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], the ship's builder, to inspect the damage. Andrews determines that ''Titanic'' will sink within two hours, and quickly realizes it lacks sufficient [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] capacity. Distress signals are sent out, but the ''Californian''{{'}}s radio operator is off duty. 58 miles away, the {{RMS|Carpathia}} radio operator receives the distress call and alerts Captain [[Arthur Rostron]], who orders the ship to turn around. Unfortunately, it will take around four hours to reach ''Titanic''. Seeing the ''Californian'' on the horizon 10 miles away, ''Titanic'' begins to signal the ship, but the ''Californian''{{'}}s crew fails to comprehend why a ship they are in sight of is firing rockets.\n\nCaptain Smith orders Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]] to start lowering the lifeboats. In the [[Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic|Grand Staircase]], passenger Robbie Lucas is told the truth by Andrews. Lucas gets his wife and children safely in a boat. Murphy, Gallagher and Farrel help the Polish girl and her mother through the ship and get them to a boat. The Richards and Hoyle are admitted to a boat by Murdoch. Yates gives a female passenger a note to send to his sister. [[Ida Straus]] and [[Isidor Straus]] refuse to be separated, inadvertently setting an example for Mrs. Clarke, who decides to stay with her husband until Andrews advises them on how to survive.\n\nAs the crew struggles to hold back the third-class passengers, most first- and second-class passengers board lifeboats and row away. As ''Titanic'' lists, passengers begin to realize the danger; when the third-class passengers are finally allowed up, chaos ensues. [[White Star Line]] Chairman [[J. Bruce Ismay]] steps into one of the last lifeboats. The ''Titanic''{{'}}s bow submerges, and only two collapsible lifeboats are left. Lightoller and other able seamen struggle to free them, as Captain Smith gives the order to abandon ship.\n\nThe Clarkes use a rope to get down the ship's side as the orchestra performs \"[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]\". Smith returns to the bridge to [[the captain goes down with the ship|go down with his ship]]. ''Titanic'' begins its final plunge; Lightoller and many others are swept off. Andrews awaits his fate in the first-class smoking room, while passengers, among them Murphy, Gallagher and Farrel, retreat towards the stern as it rises into the air. A kindly steward comforts a lost boy separated from his mother. Lucas looks out towards the lifeboats, realizing he will never see his family again, while the Clarkes, struggling in the water, are killed by a falling funnel. The passengers pray as the stricken liner rapidly sinks into the icy sea.\n\nMany people, including Lucas and Farrel, die of hypothermia. One of the collapsibles is floating overturned. Yates, unwilling to overcrowd the boat, swims away to his death. Lightoller takes charge on the boat as Murphy and Gallagher make it aboard, Murphy swimming about with a dead child in his arms - possibly the lost boy who was comforted by the ship's steward. Chief Baker [[Charles Joughin]], after having given up his lifeboat seat and turning to the bottle to ease his ailments, also climbs aboard. The men are eventually saved by another boat. In the boat, a female passenger mentions her baby in a cracking voice, implying she was the lost boy's mother.\n\nThe ''Carpathia'' arrives and rescues the survivors. On the ship, Murphy and Gallagher are reunited with the Polish girl and her mother, while Mrs. Farrel and Mrs. Lucas mourn the loss of their husbands. After a group prayer, Rostron informs Lightoller how many were saved (705) and lost (1,500). The ''Carpathia'' receives a message from the ''Californian'', which heard of the disaster, but informs them that anything humanly possible has been done. A shaken Lightoller tells Col. Gracie, \"It's still unbelievable. I don't think I'll ever feel sure again about anything.\"\n\nThe film's closing message states: \"But this is not the end of the story - for their sacrifice was not in vain. Today there are lifeboats for all. Unceasing radio vigil and, in the North Atlantic, the International Ice Patrol guards the sea lanes making them safe for the peoples of the world.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kenneth More]] as Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller|Charles Herbert Lightoller]] \n* [[Michael Goodliffe]] as shipbuilder [[Thomas Andrews]]\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J.

Lord dated the genesis of his interest in the subject to childhood. So did producer MacQuitty, who had vivid memories of, as a boy of six, watching the launch of the ''Titanic'' at the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in Belfast on 31 May 1911 and seeing it depart on its maiden voyage the following year.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=31}}\n\n===1956 television adaptation===\n{{Main|A Night to Remember (Kraft Television Theatre)}}\nThe book had previously been adapted as a live American TV production, screened by [[NBC]] and sponsored by [[Kraft Foods]] as part of the ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'' series on 28 March 1956.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=97}} It has been described as \"the biggest, most lavish, most expensive thing of its kind\" attempted up to that point, with 31 sets, 107 actors, 72 speaking parts, and 3,000 gallons of water and costing $95,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US-GDP|95000|1956|r=-3}}}} at {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} prices). [[George Roy Hill]] directed and [[Claude Rains]] narrated{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}} \u2013 a practice borrowed from radio dramas, which provided a template for many television dramas of the time.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=98}} It took a similar approach to the book, lacking dominant characters and switching between a multiplicity of scenes. Rains' narration was used \"to bridge the almost limitless number of sequences of life aboard the doomed liner\", as a reviewer put it,{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=160}} and closed with his declaration that \"never again has Man been so confident. An age had come to an end.\"{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=161}}\n\nThe production was a major hit, attracting 28 million viewers, and greatly boosted the book's sales.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}} It was rerun on [[kinescope]] on 2 May 1956, five weeks after its first broadcast.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=97}}{{sfn|Rasor|2001|p=119}}\n\n==Development==\nThe film adaptation came about after its eventual director, [[Roy Ward Baker]], and its producer, Belfast-born [[William MacQuitty]], both acquired copies of the book -\u2013 Baker from his favorite bookshop and MacQuitty from his wife \u2013 and decided to obtain the film rights. MacQuitty succeeded in raising finance from John Davis at the Rank Organisation, who in the late 1950s were expanding into bigger-budgeted filmmaking. The job of directing was assigned to Roy Baker, who was under contract to Rank, and Baker recommended Ambler be given the job of writing the screenplay.{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=29}} Lord was brought on board the production as a consultant.{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=149}}\n\nIn addition to basing the script \u2013 both in action and dialogue \u2013 on Lord's book, the filmmakers achieved nuanced performances and authentic atmosphere by consulting several actual ''Titanic'' survivors, who served as technical advisors. Among them were [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall]] and passengers [[Edith Rosenbaum|Edith Russell]] and [[Lawrence Beesley]].{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=226}} One day during shooting, Beesley famously gatecrashed the set. He infiltrated the set during the sinking scene, hoping to 'go down with the ship', but was discovered by the director, who ordered him off and vetoed this unscheduled appearance due to actors' union rules. Thus, as [[Julian Barnes]] puts it, \"for the second time in his life, Beesley left the ''Titanic'' just before it was due to go down.\"{{sfn|Barnes|2010|p=175}} Charles Lightoller's widow Sylvia Lightoller was also consulted during production, at one point visiting Pinewood Studios and meeting with Kenneth More, whom she introduced to her children on set. Sylvia commended More for his portrayal of her husband.<ref name=\"sylvia\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/widow-titanic-officer-visits-chorley.html|title=Widow of Titanic Officer visits Chorley|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Titanica]]|date=30 January 2005|access-date=2 September 2017}}</ref> Helen Melville Smith, Captain Smith's daughter, approved of Laurence Naismith for the role of her father.\n\nThere were numerous changes made to the real events to increase the drama and appeal, however. For example, there is a limited involvement of American passengers (with the exception of the Strauses, Guggenheim, Molly Brown and Colonel Gracie), and several characters based on Americans are depicted as being British. When questioned as to why he did this, Roy Baker noted that \"it was a British film made by British artists for a British audience\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=bZs5LJAU0l8C&pg=PA298 The Titanic on Film: Myth versus Truth] [[Linda Maria Koldau]]; McFarland, 2012 307 pages, page 139</ref> Also, the film diverges from both the book and the NBC TV adaptation in focusing on a central character, Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]], who does and says some things that other crewmembers are reported to have done and said during the actual disaster. Its conclusion reflects Lord's world-historical theme of a \"world changed for ever\" with a fictional conversation between Lightoller and Colonel [[Archibald Gracie IV|Archibald Gracie]], sitting on a lifeboat. Lightoller declares that the disaster is \"different ... Because we were so sure. Because even though it's happened, it's still unbelievable. I don't think I'll ever feel sure again. About anything.\"{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=161}}  Rank wanted a star for the part, so it was offered to Kenneth More, who accepted. It was the first movie he made under a new contract with Rank to make seven films in five years at a fee of \u00a340,000 a film (about \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK-GDP|40000|1957|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK-GDP}} terms, with a total of \u00a36,600,000 for all seven films).{{sfn|Richards|2001|pages=35-36}}\n\nProducer MacQuitty had originally contracted with [[Shaw, Savill & Albion Line]] to use its former flagship {{ship|QSMV|Dominion Monarch}} to shoot scenes for the film, but the company pulled out of the production at the last minute, citing that they did not want to use one of their liners to recreate the ''Titanic'' sinking. However, according to MacQuitty, the Shaw Savill Line at the time was managed by Basil Sanderson, son of Harold Sanderson, the White Star Line's director in the U.S. at the time of the sinking. Harold Sanderson would later succeed [[J. Bruce Ismay]] as president of the [[International Mercantile Marine Company]], [[J.P. Morgan]]'s shipping conglomerate that owned the White Star Line. This connection to White Star, according to MacQuitty, is what actually led the Shaw Savill Line to pull out of the film. MacQuitty eventually got permission from Ship Breaking Industries in [[Faslane]], Scotland to film scenes aboard {{RMS|Asturias|1925|6}}, a 1920s ocean liner that the company was [[Ship breaking|scrapping]]. The liner's port side had been demolished, but its starboard was still intact, so MacQuitty got art students to paint the liner the White Star Line colors and used mirrors to recreate scenes that took place on the port side. 30 sets were constructed using the builders' original plans for ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Aldridge|2008|p=89}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming began 15 October 1957 at Pinewood Studios. It went until 5 March 1958.\n\n[[Kenneth More]] recalled the production of the film in his autobiography, published 20 years later in 1978. There was no tank big enough at [[Pinewood Studios]] to film the survivors struggling to climb into lifeboats, so it was done in the open-air swimming bath at [[Ruislip Lido]], at 2:00 am on an icy November morning. When the extras refused to jump in, More realised he would have to set an example. He called out: \"Come on!\"\n\n{{blockquote|I leaped. Never have I experienced such cold in all my life. It was like jumping into a deep freeze. The shock forced the breath out of my body. My heart seemed to stop beating. I felt crushed, unable to think. I had ''rigor mortis'', without the ''mortis''. And then I surfaced, spat out the dirty water and, gasping for breath, found my voice.\n\n\"Stop!\" I shouted. \"Don't listen to me! It's bloody awful!

The accepted view at the time and the result of the inquiries was that she sank intact; it was only confirmed that she split after the wreck was found in 1985.)<ref name=\"Michael Janusonis 2003\">Michael Janusonis, \"VIDEO \u2013 Documentary just the tip of the iceberg for ''Titanic'' fans\", ''The Providence Journal'' (5 September 2003), E-05.</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117339997 | title=Titanic | work=Variety | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> Lightoller's widow Sylvia Lightoller praised the film's historical accuracy in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', stating \"The film is really the truth and has not been embroidered\".<ref name=\"sylvia\"/>\n\nWhile some events are based on true history, some of the characters and their storylines are fictional or dramatised; the characters of Mr. Murphy, Mr. Hoyle, and Jay Yates being [[composite character|composites]] of several men.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\">The Goofs of A Night To Remember (1958, Rank Pictures)</ref> Murphy, who leads the steerage girls to the lifeboat, is a composite of several Irish emigrants.

[[Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon]] and [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]] are depicted as Sir Richard and Lady Richard (Lady Duff's secretary Miss Francatelli is completely omitted) and Bruce Ismay is referred to throughout only as \"The Chairman\".\n\nThe film omits several key historical figures, including [[John Jacob Astor IV]], the wealthiest passenger aboard ''Titanic'', and [[Stoker (occupation)|Stoker]] [[Frederick Barrett]], with 2nd Engineer Officer John Henry Hesketh's role being expanded to include duties and actions that were performed by Barrett and others.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\"/>\n\nIn reality, the American gambler Jay Yates (played as British by the distinctive British actor Ralph Michael), travelling under the name of J.H. Rogers, was never on board the ''Titanic'' and the note he was said to have handed to a passenger was a hoax. Yates wrote the note in New York and then had a woman accomplice pose as a survivor and deliver the note to the newspaper. Yates did this in order to make the police think he was dead. They didn't fall for the ruse, though, and Yates was captured a couple of months after the sinking. (He was wanted on federal charges connected with postal thefts.) Michael performs the real life role of an unknown swimmer who came near the capsized and overcrowded Collapsible B, who survivor fireman Walter Hurst thought was Captain Smith.<ref name=ANTR>[https://books.google.com/books?id=67R5gy-fZhEC&pg=PT87&lpg=PT87 A Night to Remember]</ref>\n\nThe film was also clearly intended as a vehicle for its main star, Kenneth More, who played Lightoller. Throughout the sinking, Lightoller is shown personally loading nearly every lifeboat. In reality, many of Lightoller's actions were performed by other officers.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\"/><ref name=\"seaofglass\">ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\" by Tad Fitch, J.

This was an error made by Walter Lord in his research, which he acknowledged in the documentary ''The Making of A Night to Remember''.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=155}}<ref>{{harvnb|Lord|1988|p=113}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2004|p=177}}</ref>\n\nThe first scene of ''A Night to Remember'' depicts the christening of the ship at its launch. However, the ''Titanic'' was never christened, as it was not the practice of the White Star Line to stand on this sort of ceremony, and this has come down in popular lore as one of the many contributing factors to the ship's \"bad luck\".\n\nStanley Lord was upset over his negative portrayal by the actor [[Russell Napier]], which depicted him as in his warm cabin in his pyjamas in bed asleep when ''Titanic'' was sinking. Stanley Lord was sleeping in the chart room with his uniform on at the time of the disaster.\n\nLightoller is depicted nearly being crushed by the fourth funnel falling in the ship's last moments. It was actually the first funnel that fell near Lightoller.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=299}}<ref name=\"Remember 1958\"/>\n\nMurphy and Gallagher make it to the overturned Collapsible B with a child in their arms, which they pass to Lightoller. Lightoller takes one look inside the child's hood, realises it is dead and sets it adrift in the ocean. This was inspired by several accounts that Captain Smith reportedly carried a child to the boat, which later died. Along with these accounts being of dubious nature, Lightoller never reported receiving a child on Collapsible B.<ref name=\"lifeboats\">''On A Sea of Glass: The Life & Loss of the R.M.S.

It is an account of the casualness and flippancy of most of the people right after the great ship has struck (even though an ominous cascade of water is pouring into her bowels); of the slow accumulation of panic that finally mounts to a human holocaust, of shockingly ugly bits of baseness and of wonderfully brave and noble deeds.</blockquote>\n\nThe film won numerous awards, including a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film|Best English-Language Foreign Film]], and received high praise from reviewers on both sides of the Atlantic.{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=151}}\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was one of the twenty most popular films of the year in Britain according to ''[[Motion Picture Herald]]'', but it was only a modest commercial success due to the size of its original budget and its relative underperformance at the American box office.{{sfn|Richards|2001|p=98}}\n\n''[[Kinematograph Weekly]]'' listed it as being \"in the money\" at the British box office in 1958.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Kinematograph Weekly|date=18 December 1958|first=Josh|last=Billings|page=7|title=Others in the Money}}</ref>\n\nBy 2001, it had still not made a profit, in part because it was issued as part of a slate of ten films and all of its profits were cross-collateralised.{{sfn|Richards|2001|p= 98}}\n\n===Reputation today===\nAccording to Professor Paul Heyer, the film helped to spark the wave of [[disaster film]]s that included ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974).{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=151}} Heyer comments that it \"still stands as the definitive cinematic telling of the story and the prototype and finest example of the disaster-film genre.\"{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=104}} On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a \"certified fresh\" score of 100% based on 20 reviews, with an average score of 8.71/10.<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1015079_night_to_remember A Night To Remember] ''Rotten Tomatoes''</ref> It is considered \"the best ''Titanic'' film before ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997)\", \"the most ''accurate'' of all ''Titanic'' films\",<ref name=\"Michael Janusonis 2003\"/> and \"the definitive ''Titanic'' tale\",<ref>Howard Thompson, \"Movies This Week\", ''The New York Times'' (9 August 1998), p. 6, col. 1.</ref> especially for its social realism, reflecting, in the words of one critic, \"the overwhelming historical evidence that the class rigidity of 1912, for all its defects, produced a genuine sense of behavioural obligation on the ''Titanic'' among rich and poor alike; that the greatest number of people aboard faced death or hardship with a stoic and selfless grace that the world has wondered at for most of this century.\"<ref>Ken Ringle, \"Integrity Goes Down With the Ship; Historical Facts, Including True-Life Gallantry, Lost in ''Titanic''\", ''The Washington Post'' (22 March 1998), p.
