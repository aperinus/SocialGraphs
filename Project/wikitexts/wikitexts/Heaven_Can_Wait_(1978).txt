It was the second film adaptation of [[Harry Segall]]'s play of the same name, the first being ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' (1941).\n\nWarren Beatty was also influenced by his sister's, the actress [[Shirley MacLaine|Shirley Maclaine]], mysticism and beliefs of [[reincarnation]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nThe film was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]]. The cast includes Beatty, [[Julie Christie]], and [[Jack Warden]], all of whom had appeared in ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975).\n\nIn 2001, a third film adaptation of the play was done, titled ''[[Down to Earth (2001 film)|Down to Earth]]'', sharing its name with the sequel to ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' (1941).\n\n==Plot==\nJoe Pendleton, a backup quarterback for the American football team [[Los Angeles Rams]], is looking forward to leading his team to the [[Super Bowl]]. While he is riding his bicycle through a tunnel, an overzealous guardian angel on his first assignment, known only as The Escort, sees a large truck heading into the other end of the tunnel towards Joe. The Escort plucks Joe out of his body early in the mistaken belief that Joe was about to be killed.\n\nOnce in the afterlife, Joe refuses to believe that his time was up, and upon investigation, Mr. Jordan (the Escort's supervisor) discovers that Joe was going to just narrowly miss the truck and he was not destined to die until March 20th, 2025 at 10:17 AM. Unfortunately, his body has already been cremated, so a new body must be found for him. After rejecting several possible men who are about to die, Joe is persuaded to accept the body of a multi-millionaire industrialist. Leo Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating [[gold digger]] wife Julia Farnsworth and her lover Tony Abbott, Farnsworth's personal secretary.\n\nJulia and Tony are confused when Leo reappears alive and well, and Farnsworth's domestic staff is confused by the changes in some of his habits and tastes. Still obsessed with his football destiny, Farnsworth/Joe buys the Rams to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince and then secure the help of, a longtime friend and trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with Betty Logan, an environmental activist, whom he met when she came to his doorstep to protest the original Farnsworth's corporate policies.\n\nWith the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl, all the characters face a crisis. Mr. Jordan informs Joe that he must give up Farnsworth's body as well. Joe resists but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else, possibly another quarterback, and should think of him. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott finally shoots Farnsworth/Joe dead. The Rams are forced to start Tom Jarrett, another quarterback in the climactic game. A detective, Lieutenant Krim, interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on television. With the help of Corkle, he gets Julia and Abbott to incriminate each other.\n\nAfter a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is killed. With Mr. Jordan's help, Joe occupies Jarrett's body and leads the Rams to victory. During the team's postgame celebration, Corkle finds Joe, and when he realizes that it is him, they share an emotional embrace. As Joe is being interviewed on television, Mr. Jordan tells him that, to live as Tom Jarrett, he will have to lose the memories of his life as Joe Pendleton. As Mr. Jordan disappears, Tom/Joe becomes disoriented. Corkle goes to find Joe later and is crestfallen to realize that Joe has \"left\" Tom. \n \nTom bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium. They strike up a conversation, and each appears to recognize the other, but they do not know how. The lights go out in the stadium as they exit the venue, and Tom says something that reminds Betty of Farnsworth/Joe. Looking into his eyes, Betty remembers what he said to her before and whispers \u201cYou\u2019re the quarterback.\u201d Tom asks her to go with him for coffee, and she accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Warren Beatty]] as Joe Pendleton\n* [[Julie Christie]] as Betty Logan\n* [[James Mason]] as Mr. Jordan\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Max Corkle\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Tony Abbott\n* [[Dyan Cannon]] as Julia Farnsworth\n* [[Buck Henry]] as The Escort\n* [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Krim\n* [[Joseph Maher]] as Sisk\n* [[Hamilton Camp]] as Bentley\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as Everett\n* [[Stephanie Faracy]] as Corinne\n* [[Jeannie Linero]] as Lavinia\n* [[Larry Block]] as Peters\n* [[Frank Campanella]] as Conway\n* [[Dick Enberg]] as TV Interviewer\n* [[Dolph Sweet]] as Head Coach\n* [[R.G.

[[Curt Gowdy]] and [[Al DeRogatis]] can be heard doing the Super Bowl play-by-play commentary. [[Dick Enberg]] conducts an abortive postgame interview of Joe Pendleton/Tom Jarrett.\n\nBeatty lobbied hard for [[Cary Grant]] to accept the role of Mr. Jordan, going so far as to have Grant's ex-wife, Dyan Cannon, who stars as Julia Farnsworth, urge him to take the role. Although Grant was tempted, he ultimately decided not to end his retirement from film-making.\n\n==Production==\nBeatty initially wanted [[Muhammad Ali]] to play the central character, but because of Ali's continued commitment to boxing, Beatty changed the character from a boxer to an American football player, and played the character himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD9ZvZkdYs |title=YouTube |website=YouTube |access-date=2010-12-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712044054/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGD9ZvZkdYs |archive-date=July 12, 2015 }}</ref> The type of instrument he played was also changed; in ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'', Pendleton assays \"[[The Last Rose of Summer]]\" on the alto saxophone, and in the 1978 film, he plays \"[[Ciribiribin]]\" on a soprano sax. The music during the comic training scene with Joe and the servants at the Farnsworth mansion, as well as the later training session with the Rams is Handel's Sonata No. 3 in F Major, performed by Paul Brodie (sopranino saxophone) and Antonin Kubalek (piano). The main theme is the song \"Heaven Can Wait\" performed by [[Dave Grusin]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. [[Neil Diamond]] composed a song titled \"Heaven Can Wait\" specifically for the film that he thought would be a good theme song, but Beatty declined to use it. The [[Paul McCartney and Wings]] song \"Did We Meet Somewhere Before?\" was considered as a theme song for the film, but was ruled out. It later appeared in the film ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'' (1979).\n\nThe Super Bowl game (Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Rams) was filmed during halftime of the San Diego Chargers vs. Los Angeles Rams preseason game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on September 1, 1977. (About a year and a half after the film's release, in January 1980, the Rams and Steelers met in real life in [[Super Bowl XIV]].)\n\nThe estate used as Farnsworth mansion was filmed at [[Filoli]], located in [[Woodside, California]], south of [[San Francisco]]. Another filming location, albeit brief, was at Evergreen Cemetery in Los Angeles on the grounds beside the Gothic stone chapel in the scene where Joe discovers his body was cremated and scattered on the cemetery grounds.\n\nThe football stadium used in the film was the home of the Los Angeles Rams team at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at 3911 South Figueroa Street, Exposition Park in Los Angeles.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 87% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10.

Part IV, p. 1.</ref> Gary Arnold of ''The Washington Post'' wrote \"''Heaven Can Wait'' is easily the most appealing new American movie on the market. It manages to preserve much of the charm and romantic fantasy that worked for its predecessor, the 1941 crowd-pleaser ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'', while freshening up some of the settings and details and tailoring the roles to a different cast.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (June 28, 1978). \"Here Comes a Spirited Fantasy\".
