It stars [[Paul Giamatti]] and [[Paul Rudd]], with [[Sally Hawkins]] and [[Amy Landecker]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film debuted at the 2013 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], with a [[video on demand]] release following on September 10, 2013.

He also discovers his old friend and former accomplice Rene (Rudd) is in a relationship with his ex.\n\nDennis has a brief fit of rage at Therese and later lands one punch on Rene. Homeless and desperate for work as there is a recession, he reluctantly asks Rene if he can go with him to sell Christmas trees in New York City. Dennis wants to make enough money to buy his estranged daughter the piano she has always wanted.\n\nIn [[Brooklyn]], Dennis gets thrown out of a caf\u00e9 and the following day has an altercation with another tree salesman. Finally Olga, a Russian-born woman, buys the first tree and they gradually start hustling and moving their trees.\n\nOlga asks Dennis to straighten the tree as an excuse, to the house where she cleans for a couple of dentists, offering him food and a shower. The next day the men are hit with a tree selling rush. Amidst the sales, Rene's wife Marie calls, letting him know she wants him to sign divorce papers. Upset, he takes off for a few days, so Dennis is left in charge.\n\nWhen Rene reappears, he has an engagement ring for Therese. Dennis becomes irate, telling two guys looking to buy a tree that his friend stole his wife from him while he was in prison. He becomes inspired to call his ex collect, but she doesn't accept the charges. Distraught, he visits Olga the next day and asks her to help him find his daughter a piano.\n\nOlga visits them at their tree-selling lot with vodka, and she, Rene, Dennis and Nzomo, an African who had helped with the tree selling, drink through the night. The next day, as Dennis and Rene are robbed by a supposedly blind man who had bought a tree from them, Dennis convinces Olga to help them take the dentists' Steinway.\n\nReturning to their small Quebec town, Dennis watches from a distance as Michi plays her new piano, then hugs her mom and Rene happily.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Dennis\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Rene\n* [[Sally Hawkins]] as Olga\n* [[Amy Landecker]] as Therese\n* [[Peter Hermann (actor)|Peter Hermann]] as Monsieur Tremblay\n* [[Emory Cohen]] as Lou\n* [[Halley Feiffer]] as Claire\n* [[Colman Domingo]] as Nzomo\n\n==Production==\nThe opening of the movie is set in Quebec, Canada, and appears to have been shot in Quebec, Canada.
