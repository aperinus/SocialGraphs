The film grossed $6.5 million in the United States.<ref name=bomojo />\n\n== Plot ==\nA female [[unicorn]] learns from two hunters and a [[butterfly]] that she is the last of her kind since a malevolent entity called the Red [[Cattle|Bull]] has herded unicorns to the ends of the earth. The Unicorn journeys to find them.\n\nThe Unicorn is captured by the [[Witchcraft|witch]] Mommy Fortuna and displayed in her Midnight Carnival. Most of the attractions are normal animals enhanced by illusions to appear as mythical beasts. Fortuna uses a spell to create another horn on the unicorn's head, as the carnival visitors cannot see her real form. Fortuna keeps the immortal [[harpy]] [[Celaeno]] captive as well, deeming the risk secondary to the deed's prestige. The unicorn is befriended by Schmendrick,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/schmendrick | title=Dictionary.com | publisher=Harper Collins Publishers | work=Online Etymology Dictionary | access-date=April 16, 2017 | author=Harper, Douglas | pages=1}}</ref> an incompetent [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] in the service of Mommy Fortuna. With the help of Schmendrick, the Unicorn escapes, in the process freeing Celaeno, who kills Fortuna. The Unicorn and Schmendrick gain a second traveling companion with Molly Grue, the careworn lover of Captain Cully (the disappointing reality behind the myth of ''[[Robin Hood]]'').\n\nWhen the Unicorn nears the seaside castle of King Haggard, keeper of the Red Bull, she encounters the beast, a monstrous [[Elemental|fire elemental]]. Before she can be captured, Schmendrick uses his unpredictable magic, transforming her into a woman. The Red Bull loses interest in her and departs, but the Unicorn is shocked by the sensation of mortality. Schmendrick promises to return her to normal after the quest is complete.\n\nSchmendrick, Molly Grue, and the now-human Unicorn proceed to the castle. Haggard is at first unwelcoming. Schmendrick introduces the Unicorn as Lady Amalthea, and requests that they become members of Haggard's court, only to be told that the only occupants of the castle are Haggard, his adopted son Prince L\u00edr and four ancient men-at-arms. Haggard consents to lodge the trio, replacing his more competent wizard, Mabruk, with Schmendrick, and setting Molly Grue to work in his [[Scullery (room)|scullery]]. Mabruk leaves after recognizing \"Amalthea\" for what she truly is, jeering that by allowing her into his castle Haggard has invited his doom. Due to her new human emotions, Amalthea begins forgetting her true self and falls in love with Prince L\u00edr, and considers abandoning her quest in favor of mortal love. Haggard confronts Amalthea, hinting at the location of the unicorns, yet from the waning magic in her eyes, has doubts regarding his suspicions that she is more than she seems.\n\nMolly finally learns the location of the Red Bull's lair from the castle's cat. Molly, Schmendrick, and Amalthea are joined by L\u00edr as they enter the bull's den, and are trapped there by Haggard. Schmendrick explains to L\u00edr what they are looking for and reveals Amalthea's true identity. L\u00edr declares that he loves her anyway. This makes Amalthea want to abandon the quest and marry L\u00edr, but L\u00edr dissuades her. The Red Bull appears, no longer deceived by Amalthea's human form, and chases after her. Schmendrick turns Amalthea back into the Unicorn, but she is unwilling to leave L\u00edr's side. The Bull begins driving her toward the ocean just as he had driven the other unicorns. L\u00edr tries defending her, but is killed by the Bull. Enraged, the Unicorn turns on the Bull and forces him into the sea. Carried on the incoming tides, the missing hundreds of unicorns emerge from the raging sea. With their release, Haggard's castle collapses into the sea, and Haggard, watching all from the battlements, falls to his death.\n\nOn the beach, the Unicorn magically revives L\u00edr before she leaves him. Schmendrick assures L\u00edr he gained much by winning the love of a unicorn, even if he is now alone. The Unicorn later says goodbye to Schmendrick, who laments he wronged her by burdening her with regret and the taint of mortality, which could make her unable to properly rejoin her kind. She disagrees about the importance of his actions, as they had helped restore unicorns to the world and made her experience [[regret]] and [[love]]. Schmendrick and Molly watch the Unicorn depart for her forest home.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as the Unicorn/Lady Amalthea, the eponymous \"last unicorn\" who, in her search for the other unicorns, is transformed into a young woman and learns about regret and love.\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Schmendrick, a magician who accompanies the Unicorn on her quest to find others like her. Beagle commented that he was a bit \"disappointed\" by the way Arkin approached the character because it seemed \"too flat\".<ref name=toonzone />\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Prince L\u00edr, King Haggard's adopted son who falls in love with Lady Amalthea. Although he is later told by Schmendrick that she is a unicorn, his feelings for her remain unchanged, as he says emphatically, \"I ''love'' whom I ''love''\".\n* [[Tammy Grimes]] as Molly Grue, the love of Captain Cully who joins Schmendrick and the Unicorn. While explaining that there was no particular reason that he did not write a detailed background for Molly Grue's character, Beagle stated that he has \"always been grateful\" to Grimes because she \"brought such vocal life to the character that she covered things I didn't do.\"<ref name=toonzone />\n* [[Robert Klein]] as The Butterfly, the creature that gives the Unicorn a hint as to where to find the other unicorns.\n* [[Angela Lansbury]] as Mommy Fortuna, a witch who uses her illusory magic to run the Midnight Carnival, which showcases mythical creatures that are, in truth, just normal animals. Later, the harpy Celaeno, one of the two ''real'' mythical creatures, kills her and her henchman, Ruhk.\n* [[Christopher Lee]] as King Haggard, the ruler of a dreary kingdom, who has never been happy, save for when he looks at unicorns. Beagle described Lee as \"the last of the great 20th Century actors, and either the most-literate or second-most literate performer I've ever met.\"<ref name=tludeluxebeagle>{{cite book | last = Beagle | first = Peter S. | author-link = Peter S.

Those who expressed interest included [[Lee Mendelson]] and [[Bill Melendez]] of the [[Peanuts animated specials|''Peanuts'' television specials]], though Beagle had been convinced by one of their partners' wives that they were \"not good enough\", as well as former [[20th Century Fox]] animator Les Goldman. At the time, Beagle believed that \"animated was the only way to go\" with regard to the film, and had never thought of making it into a live-action film. [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]]' New York-based production company, [[Rankin/Bass Productions]], had been the last studio that the film's associate producer, Michael Chase Walker, approached, and Beagle was \"horrified\" when he was informed that they had made a deal with Walker. Beagle stated that he has \"\u2026come to feel that the film is actually a good deal more than I had originally credited\", and went on to say \"There is some lovely design work \u2013 the Japanese artists who did the concepts and coloring were very good. And the voice actors do a superb job in bringing my characters to life\u2026\"<ref name=toonzone />\n\nWhile Rankin/Bass provided the film's dialogue and story based on Beagle's work, the animation was done at [[Topcraft]] in Tokyo, Japan, headed by former [[Toei Animation]] employee Toru Hara, with Masaki Iizuka being in charge of the production. The studio, which previously animated ''[[Frosty's Winter Wonderland]]'' (1976), ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977), ''[[The Stingiest Man in Town]]'' (1978), ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980) and other cel-animated projects from Rankin/Bass, would later be hired by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] to work on ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]'', and their core members eventually went on to form [[Studio Ghibli]].<ref name=\"hairston\">{{cite web | last =Hairston | first =Marc | title =The Last Unicorn | work =utd500.utdallas.edu | date =November 2001 | url =https://utd500.utdallas.edu/~hairston/lastunicorn.html | access-date =2007-09-09 | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070827153814/http://utd500.utdallas.edu/~hairston/lastunicorn.html | archive-date =2007-08-27 }}</ref> According to Beagle, the final film ended up being \"remarkably close\" to his original script, although one scene at the end involving an encounter with a princess was \"animated but eventually cut.\"<ref name=toonzone>{{cite web |url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=14847  |title=Peter S.
