Gr\u00f6ss, played by actor Michael Carr. The narrator presents the viewer with a variety of footage showing different gruesome ways of dying  from a variety of sources. Some of the most iconic scenes were faked for the film, while most of the film is preexisting video footage of real deaths or aftermath of death.\n\n''Faces of Death'' received generally negative reviews, but was a huge success at the box office, reportedly grossing over $35 million worldwide. It gained a [[cult following]], was eventually deemed artistically significant to film and also spawned several sequels, the first of which, ''[[Faces of Death II]]'', was released in 1981. All of the following sequels either contained less or no fake footage.\n\n==Plot==\nOn an operating table, an unnamed patient undergoes [[open heart surgery]]. The titles run over footage of fresh and rotten cadavers, and footage of a complete organ harvesting where a patient received the heart. After cleaning himself up, [[pathologist]] Francis B. Gr\u00f6ss states to the viewer that he has become interested with the transitional periods of life and death thanks to a recurring dream. He describes the dream as one that featured grotesque deaths, but wasn't a nightmare as his experience as a surgeon allowed him to accept the events as they are. He has accrued footage either himself or from several parts of the world in an effort to better understand and study the many \"faces of death\".\n\nAn examination in natural and unnatural animal death takes place, footage of a chicken being beheaded at a farm and graphic slaughterhouse footage is shown. In Mexico, Gr\u00f6ss has captured the mummified corpses of the deceased inhabitants of [[Guanajuato City|Guanajuato]], as well as footage of a [[dog fighting|dog fight]] between two [[pit bull]]s. He next examines the natural predators of the [[Amazon rainforest]] and the ways in which they kill their prey. Footage of a monkey being killed and [[Monkey brains|its brain being eaten]] by guests of a banquet is also shown. A man is killed by an alligator, an act that Gr\u00f6ss calls a \"violent retaliation from a creature who has suffered continued abuse from mankind\".\n\nGr\u00f6ss next narrates over recordings of human deaths, namely assassinations, stating that [[homo sapiens]] are the only species to kill for greed. Assassin Fran\u00e7ois Jordan is interviewed, admitting that he kills solely for payment, not for \"political\" or \"social value\". Next, Gr\u00f6ss introduces \"another type of killer\", \"the one who kills for no apparent reason\". A gunfight ensues between a [[SWAT]] team and an armed murderer who is shot, after which the team enters the killer's house to find his family stabbed to death; Gr\u00f6ss questions whether the man's actions were caused by society. Soon after, Gr\u00f6ss shows footage of criminal Larry DeSilva being executed by [[electric chair]].\n\nOne sequence involves cryogenic patient Samuel Berkowitz, who was frozen in July 1978 and stored in northern California. Graphic images and brief footage of the cryogenic process of replacing bodily fluids with a liquid with a low freezing point, to prevent freezer burn on the corpse. Gr\u00f6ss goes on to explain the purpose of this process is to preserve the body for future sciences to revive him, asking \"imagine what it would be like to die in 1980, and wake up hundreds of years into the future\".\n\nThe next segment displays war and atrocities in history, including [[the Holocaust]]. Horrific acts during said period are displayed and analyzed in full detail, and how desperate [[Adolf Hitler]] became during the latter years of the war. The segment ends with Nazis being obliterated in battle by land and sea, with Gr\u00f6ss adding, \"Hitler soon lost control not only of his army, but of his mind\".\n\nFootage of several more tragic accidents is shown, both animal and human, culminating in a segment focusing on vehicle accidents, including a vehicle stunt for a film gone wrong, a cyclist having her head crushed by a semi truck, and a scene in which a [[Wing walking|wing walker]] attempts a parachute jump from his plane but dies after the parachute fails to open properly. Gr\u00f6ss disputes the notion that this death was quick and painless, as the jumper would have been conscious and aware for the entire fall to the ground. The segment ends with photographs, footage and [[air traffic control]] audio from the crash of [[PSA Flight 182]] and its grisly aftermath of scattered mutilated body parts and numerous destroyed houses. Gr\u00f6ss states that to this day (at the time of the film's release), the neighborhood smells like \"rotting bodies and jet fuel\", and claims that a mutilated body with only its torso and right hand \"is the worst face of death\".\n\nGr\u00f6ss introduces his next topic, the role that supernatural forces might play in death. He meets with architect Joseph Binder, whose wife and son both died under tragic circumstances.  He confides to the viewer that he believes his deceased family remain as ghosts in his house and are attempting to communicate with him. Gr\u00f6ss enlists the services of [[Parapsychology|parapsychologists]] to verify this, and the team later takes photographs of footprints and two apparitions. Binder then communicates with the spirits of his family through a [[Mediumship|medium]], seemingly confirming the existence of life after death.\n\nGr\u00f6ss remarks that after studying Binder's case, he has concluded even \"when we die, it isn't really the end\" as \"the soul in each of us remains a traveller forever\". Gr\u00f6ss ends by questioning whether death is \"the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end\" and leaves the footage he has shown to the viewer's interpretation. Immediately after Gr\u00f6ss's final dialogue, the film ends with peaceful music, footage of a baby's birth and photos of the child growing up happily.\n\n==Cast==\n* Michael Carr as Francis B. Gr\u00f6ss\n* Samuel Berkowitz as victim\n* Mary Ellen Brighton as suicide victim\n* [[Thomas Noguchi]] as Chief Medical Examiner Coroner\n\n== Production ==\nThe movie was written and directed by John Alan Schwartz (credited as \"Alan Black\" for writing and as \"Conan LeCilaire\" for directing). Schwartz also took credit as [[second unit]] [[Film director|director]], this time as \"Johnny Getyerkokov\". He also appears in one of the segments of the film, as the leader of the alleged flesh eating cult in [[San Francisco]] and has brief appearances in several other movies of this series. Schwartz wanted to depict very real death with \"an analytical view, rather than a purely exploitive purpose\", but the films inclusion of fake scenes have brought this to debate. The movie features Michael Carr as the [[narrator]], and 'creative consultant' called \"Dr. Francis B. Gr\u00f6ss\", whose voice is reminiscent of [[Leonard Nimoy]] in the popular TV show ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]''. John Alan Schwartz has said that this movie's budget was $450,000 and there are estimates that it has grossed more than $35 million worldwide in theatrical releases, not including rentals.<ref name=\"Independent\"/>\n\nAlthough several of the human death scenes and one depicting a monkey being killed are obvious fakes<ref name=faces>{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=David Ray|editor1-last=Cline|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Weiner|editor2-first=Robert J.|title=From the Arthouse to the Grindhouse: Highbrow and Lowbrow Transgression in Cinema's First Century|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|chapter=It's Only A Movie?

Schwartz became aware of this after the victim's sister (unsure if she's featured) protested the use of this footage.\n\nAccording to Schwartz, the scene in the film wherein a murderer is executed by electric chair was achieved with the use of a fake chair built in a friend's loft and toothpaste to emulate saliva. Electric \"zapping\" sounds were added in post-production. He was inspired to make the scene after reading about a recent execution by electric chair and was surprised to find it still in practice.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Does Snuff Exist?|series=The Dark Side of Porn|series-link=The Dark Side of Porn|network=[[Channel 4]]|date=April 18, 2006|season=2}}</ref>\n\nThe infamous Flight 182 crash happened no less than 2 weeks before the film's release, and graphic footage depicting the crash aftermath, destroyed houses and scattered body parts were included into the film near the climax. Still images and air traffic audio were used for the crash itself, because no actual footage is known to exist. According to Schwartz, the film was pretty much completed, but reworked immediately after the crash occurred.\n\n==Censorship==\nDue to its graphic content, ''Faces of Death'' was banned and censored in many countries.

As I said it's not a film that holds up very well at all, but considering how groundbreaking it was for its time, I doubt anyone will ever forget it.

''Faces of Death II'', ''Faces of Death III'', and ''Faces of Death IV'', as well as ''Faces of Death: Fact or Fiction?'' (a documentary on the making of the series) were written and at least partially directed by John Alan Schwartz. ''Faces of Death V'' and ''Faces of Death VI'' were released in the mid-90s, and are compilations made up entirely of highlights from the first four movies, with no new footage, released in some countries where the original movies were banned. The first three featured Carr as \"Dr. Gr\u00f6ss\", although ''The Worst of Faces of Death'' (released between installments ''III'' and ''IV'' and consisting of highlights from the first three installments) instead featured Schwartz's brother, James Schwartz, as \"Dr. Louis Flellis\". Flellis explains that he accidentally killed \"Dr. Gr\u00f6ss\" while operating on him the prior week. However, in ''Faces of Death IV'', Flellis explains the absence of Dr. Gr\u00f6ss by stating that he had killed himself, having been driven insane as a result of witnessing so much death.\n\nAlso released with the title ''Faces of Death VII'', was a condensed version of [[Anton LaVey]]'s 1989 film ''[[Death Scenes]]''; and another assemblage of stock footage titled ''Faces of Death part 7'' was released as an online file sometime during the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n''Faces of Death 8'' followed soon after. Released only in Germany, and made by unknown individuals, it is a collection of mostly unrelated gore scenes from around the world, with no narration, and no on-screen credits, aside from its title.\n\nIn May 2021, it was reported that [[Legendary Entertainment]] had purchased the rights to the film, and a remake was in development, with filmmakers [[Isa Mazzei]] and Daniel Goldhauber attached to direct.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/faces-of-death-legendary-remake-1234949947/|title=Cult Horror Movie 'Faces of Death' Getting 21st Century Reimagining Via Legendary (Exclusive)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Borys|last=Kit|date=May 7, 2021|accessdate=May 11, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Legal cases==\nIn June 1985, mathematics teacher Bart Schwarz showed the film to his class at [[Escondido High School]] in [[Escondido, California]].
