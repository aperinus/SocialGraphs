By 2022, the [[United States]] is said to have become virtually crime-free, with legal unemployment rates having dropped to 1%.\n\nJames Sandin returns to his home in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] [[gated community]] to wait out the Purge with his wife Mary and their children, Zoey and Charlie. The family is assured the security system manufactured by James' company will keep them safe, while Zoey meets her boyfriend Henry. As the year's Purge begins, James enables the security system and the family disperses to go about their normal routines. Zoey returns to her room and finds Henry, who had snuck in before the security system was engaged, planning on confronting her father about their relationship. Meanwhile, Charlie watches the security monitors and sees a wounded man calling for help. He temporarily disables the system to allow the man inside, but James races to re-engage the system and holds the man at gunpoint. Henry comes downstairs and points a pistol at James and opens fire, but then James returns fire and mortally wounds Henry. During the chaos, the stranger disappears.\n\nThrough the surveillance cameras, the family sees a gang of masked, heavily armed people arriving at the front lawn. The leader demands the homeless man, warning that failure to comply will result in an invasion. When Mary asks about the security system, James admits it is incapable of withstanding a determined assault. The family find and capture the stranger to give him to the gang, only to realize that they would not be any better if they did and choose to defend him and themselves. After the deadline passes, the gang breaks into the house. James fights back and kills several of them before the leader stabs him. Charlie notices the neighbors leaving their homes on the monitors before the neighbors enter and kill the remaining gang members. Mary is ambushed by two of the Purgers and gets restrained, but the neighbors save her. The leader attempts to kill the family, but is killed by Zoey while James dies from his injuries.\n\nMary starts to thank the neighbors for saving them, but their leader, Grace Ferrin, reveals her group's hatred for the Sandins due to their wealth being acquired at the neighbors' expense. They capture the Sandins and prepare to kill them, but the stranger returns, kills one of the neighbors, and holds Grace hostage to force them to free the Sandins. Mary stops him from killing the remaining neighbors, deciding that they will all peacefully wait out the remainder of the Purge.\n\nThe next morning, Grace attempts to seize control, but Mary wounds her in retaliation. As sirens sound to signal the end of the Purge, she forces the neighbors to leave and thanks the stranger for his help. He bids the Sandins luck before leaving as well.\n\nTelevision news reports state this year's Purge was the most successful to date. Other stations report that the [[stock market]] is booming due to the massive sales of weapons and security systems. A man\u2019s voice speaks of the loss of his patriotism after the death of his sons the night before.\n\n==Cast==\n===The Sandin family===\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as James Sandin\n* [[Lena Headey]] as Mary Sandin\n* [[Max Burkholder]] as Charlie Sandin\n* [[Adelaide Kane]] as Zoey Sandin\n\n===The Neighbors===\n*[[Arija Bareikis]] as Grace Ferrin\n* Tom Yi as Mr. Cali\n* [[Chris Mulkey]] as Mr. Halverson\n* Tisha French as Mrs. Halverson\n* Dana Bunch as Mr. Ferrin\n\n===The Purgers===\n* [[Rhys Wakefield]] as Polite Leader\n* John Weselcouch as Interrupting Freak Purger\n* Alicia Vela-Bailey as Blonde Female Freak Purger\n* Mickey Facchinello as Brunette Freak Purger\n* Boima Blake as Freak Purger\n* Nathan Clarkson as Freak Purger\n* Jesse Jacobs as Freak Purger\n* Aaron Kuban as Freak Purger\n* [[Chester Lockhart]] as Freak Purger\n* Tyler Osterkamp as Freak Purger\n* R.
