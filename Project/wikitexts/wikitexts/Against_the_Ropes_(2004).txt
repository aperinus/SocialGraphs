Dutton]] (in his [[List of directorial debuts|feature film directorial debut]]) and starring [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Omar Epps]]. The story is a fictionalized account of [[boxing]] manager [[Jackie Kallen]], the first woman to achieve success in the sport. Kallen has a bit part in the film playing a reporter, and a few lines in the scene where the press interviews the principal characters.\n\nThe film was shot primarily at the  [[Wolstein Center]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], Canada at the [[Copps Coliseum]].<ref name=hamfilm>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&&locations=Hamilton,+Ontario,+Canada |title=Internet Movie Database - List of Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario|accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref> ''Against the Ropes'' grossed less than $6 million in the US and was panned by critics for its resemblance to other boxing films.\n\n==Plot==\n{{cleanup-PR|section|date=March 2015}}\nAt a young age, Jackie Kallen learns about boxing with her father and uncle in a small gym. Later, she becomes assistant to a [[Cleveland]] boxing promoter. Her boss then begins doing business with Sam LaRocca, a sports manager, during a middleweight championship fight.\n\nChallenged  after the contest to demonstrate an understanding of the fight game, she proceeds to embarrass LaRocca, who then offers to sell the loser's contract to her for the price of one dollar. She accepts, only to discover upon visiting the fighter in his home that he is addicted to drugs and enmeshed in a dangerous and self-destructive lifestyle.\n\nEnter Luther Shaw, a small-time hood. Kallen watches in horror and fascination as Shaw pummels the former [[middleweight]] champ. She offers to manage him professionally. Shaw is at first hesitant, but eventually signs on with her.\n\nBecause of LaRocca's influence, Kallen can't find Shaw a fight anywhere in [[Ohio]], so the two are forced to go on the road until Shaw makes a name for himself. Jackie begins to get swept up in all the attention she gets for being the first female boxing manager. Her attention eventually shifts from Shaw to her own media persona as her fighter's number of wins continues to climb.\n\nFinally realizing that she is not paying enough attention to her only client, Kallen agrees to sell Shaw's contract to LaRocca on the condition that he be given a championship fight. LaRocca agrees, setting Shaw up for a shot at the title before he could be ready. Kallen arrives at the fight and stands in Shaw's corner as he pulls off an upset and wins the championship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Meg Ryan]] - [[Jackie Kallen]]\n*[[Omar Epps]] - Luther Shaw\n*[[Tony Shalhoub]] - Sam LaRocca\n*[[Tim Daly]] - Gavin Reese\n*[[Kerry Washington]] - Renee\n*[[Charles S.
