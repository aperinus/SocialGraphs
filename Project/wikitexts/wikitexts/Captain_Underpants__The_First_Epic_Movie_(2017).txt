It was directed by [[David Soren (animator)|David Soren]] from a screenplay by [[Nicholas Stoller]], and stars the voices of [[Ed Helms]], [[Kevin Hart]], [[Thomas Middleditch]] and [[Nick Kroll]]. The film marked the 20th anniversary of the [[Captain Underpants]] series. In the film, two fourth graders, George Beard and Harold Hutchins accidentally hypnotize their mean principal, Mr. Krupp, into thinking he is the titular \"Captain Underpants\", a [[superhero]] who fights crime while wearing only [[Undergarment|underwear]] and a cape, thinking he has [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]].\n\n''Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie'' premiered on May 21, 2017, at the [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Regency Village Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]], and was released in the United States on June 2, in 3D and 2D formats. The film received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the animation, humor, faithfulness and references to its source material, and voice acting, particularly from Helms. It grossed $125 million worldwide against a budget of $38 million, the lowest budget for a DreamWorks Animation feature film until ''[[Spirit Untamed]]'' was released in 2021 at a budget of $30 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Amidi|first1=Amid|title='Captain Underpants' Could Dramatically Alter The U.S. Feature Animation Industry|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/business/captain-underpants-dramatically-alter-u-s-feature-animation-industry-151318.html|access-date=June 3, 2017|work=[[Cartoon Brew]]|publisher=Cartoon Brew, LLC|date=June 2, 2017}}</ref> A [[Netflix]] television series, ''[[The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants]]'' was released on July 13, 2018, and aired for 4 seasons with 45 episodes and 3 specials. It was the final Dreamworks film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox. A spin-off film based on ''[[Dog Man]]'', another book series by Pilkey, has been announced.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words -->\nIn [[Piqua, Ohio]], George Beard and Harold Hutchins are two fourth-grade friends and next-door neighbors who often bring joy to their school, [[Curly Howard|Jerome Horwitz]] Elementary School, by excessively pranking the staff at the school, especially their cruel [[principal (education)|principal]], Mr. Benjamin \"Benny\" Krupp, which puts them at odds with him. The duo also creates [[comic book]]s about a superhero named Captain Underpants, a character who has superpowers yet merely wears underwear and a cape. They sell these to their schoolmates through a comic company called \"Treehouse Comix Inc.\", located in their treehouse. George and Harold's pranks come to an apparent end when they are caught tampering with a toilet invention, the Turbo Toilet 2000, made by their tattletale classmate, Melvin Sneedly. Mr. Krupp decides to put the boys in separate classes, believing that he can end their friendship with it.\n\nTo prevent this, George [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] Mr. Krupp with a \"3-D Hypno-Ring\" he received out of a cereal box, the boys notice that Mr. Krupp bears a resemblance to Captain Underpants and command him to be so. The boys soon learn the severity of this when Captain Underpants begins causing trouble around Piqua and thus decide to take him to their treehouse. There, they discover that they can turn Captain Underpants back into Mr. Krupp by splashing water on him and back into Captain Underpants by snapping their fingers. Realizing that Mr. Krupp will continue trying to separate them, they decide to settle with Captain Underpants yet insist that he be dressed up as Mr. Krupp under the pretense of a \"secret identity\", to which Captain Underpants agrees. His sudden personality change even manages to attract the attention and affection of the school's shy lunch lady, Edith.\n\nJust when George and Harold believe that their troubles have ended, an odd scientist named Professor Pee-Pee Diarrheastein Poopypants Esq. visits Jerome Horwitz Elementary School, whom Captain Underpants (still disguised as Mr. Krupp) hires to be the new science teacher, but George and Harold are suspicious due to his short-tempered and violent behavior. As it turns out, Poopypants is seeking to get rid of laughter altogether due to people never taking him seriously for years because of his name.\n\nWith Captain Underpants as the principal, the school is a more lively place, with a [[fair]] being set up in the yard. However, a rainstorm occurs and Captain Underpants turns back into Mr. Krupp, who finally finishes the paperwork to put George and Harold into separate classes. Meanwhile, Poopypants recruits Melvin into his plan, as he has no sense of humor and does not find his name funny. Soon, Poopypants tries to take over the town with a giant version of Melvin's Turbo Toilet 2000, fueled by the school cafeteria's toxic leftovers left out by Edith and uses Melvin's brain as the power source to a [[zombie]]-ray to turn the children into dull and humorless zombies. Captain Underpants tries to stop them, but due to having no actual superpowers, he's effortlessly defeated and thrown into the toxic pool. George and Harold are captured and turned into zombies but are able to escape when their laughter from a joke that made them friends in kindergarten overloads the zombie-ray, which damages the Turbo Toilet 2000's computer and returns the kids to normal. Upon consuming the toxic leftovers, Captain Underpants acquires superpowers and, with George and Harold's help, defeats and shrinks Poopypants, who escapes on a bee shortly thereafter.\n\nKnowing that they can't control Captain Underpants forever, George and Harold destroy the Hypno Ring in order to permanently change him back into Mr. Krupp. Also realising that they can still be best friends whilst being in seperate classed, the boys do an oath to declare themselves as friends forever. Feeling that Mr. Krupp would be a lot nicer if he had friends, the boys set him and Edith up on a date, making Mr. Krupp have a change of heart and return the comics he confiscated from George and Harold. However, the toxic waste from the Turbo Toilet 2000 transforms all the toilets at a scrap yard into an army of Talking Toilets, which attack the restaurant where Mr. Krupp and Edith are dining. Upon snapping his fingers accidentally, Mr. Krupp once again becomes Captain Underpants, carrying George and Harold away to help them fight the Toilets to Edith's surprise and admiration.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], George and Harold realize that Mr. Krupp's secretary Miss Anthrope, whom they put on the phone via a false competition for $1 billion, has been on the phone for the entire film, prompting them to shut off the call to her dismay.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Mr. Benjamin \"Benny\" Krupp / [[Captain Underpants]], the grumpy and mean principal of [[Curly Howard|Jerome Horwitz]] Elementary School, who gets [[hypnotized]] into becoming the [[superhero]] created by George and Harold, in order to stop him from putting them in separate classes.<ref name=PRCast />\n* [[Kevin Hart]] as George Beard, a fourth-grade student who is best friends with Harold who make comic books, George writes stories while Harold illustrates them.

He was relieved that Soren was directing since he was a fan of ''Turbo''. In an interview with ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Pilkey said: \"Once I met David, it was like a huge load fell off my back; I was like, 'I don't even have to think about this anymore. Just send me a couple of tickets to the premiere.'\"<ref name=\"PilkeyLA\" /> Commenting back, Soren said, \"In a way, the controversy over the books ended up being liberating for the film. Normally on an animated movie, you're trying to appeal to every possible demographic, and often that results in your content being watered down a little bit. Obviously, we hope we get as wide of an audience as possible. But it's likely that if people have issues with the books they may have issues with the movie too, and we didn't feel like we needed to waste a lot of time trying to rope them in. It allowed us to make the purest version of the movie.\"<ref name=\"PilkeyLA\" /> Soren also said that he took inspiration from [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] films. In an interview with MovieFreak, he mentioned,\n{{blockquote|text=... we actually looked at a lot of John Hughes movies for inspiration, like ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' and ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]''. John Hughes had this great knack for making comedies like this. Both of those movies have great friendships at the center of them. He seemed to be able to tap into the voice of a generation. They're very funny, all of his movies, but they are also poignant and they actually have meaningful things to say, which I think is why they have stood the test of time. So there's timelessness to his work that we were attempting to go for with this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviefreak.com/captain-underpants-interview-2017-david-soren/#.WrME7jYpDxA |title= \"CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS: THE FIRST EPIC ADVENTURE\" \u2013 Interview with DAVID SOREN |author= Sara Michelle Fetters |date= June 16, 2017 |access-date= March 22, 2018}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nAlthough it is a CG-animated feature, the film includes scenes that are [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]], [[flash animation|flash animated]], a short [[cutout animation]] segment, and a [[sock puppet]] sequence created by [[Screen Novelties]].\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] wrote and performed the theme song for the film (which is possibly because in [[The Adventures of Captain Underpants|the book]], George and Harold \"play \"Weird Al\" Yankovic music 6 hours full blast\"), which was featured in a lyric video.
