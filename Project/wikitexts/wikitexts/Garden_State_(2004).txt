The film centers on Andrew Largeman (Braff), a 26-year-old actor/waiter who returns to his hometown in [[New Jersey]] after his mother dies. Braff based the film on his real life experiences. It was filmed in April and May 2003 and released on July 28, 2004. New Jersey was the main setting and primary shooting location.<ref name=\"rt\">[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/garden_state/ \"Garden State (2004)\"]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved December 18, 2013.</ref>\n\n''Garden State'' received positive reviews and  was a box office success. It was an official selection of the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film also spawned [[Garden State (soundtrack)|a soundtrack]] for which Braff, who picked the music himself, won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]].\n\n== Plot ==\nStruggling actor Andrew Largeman wakes up from a dream\u2014in which he apathetically sits on a crashing plane\u2014to a telephone message from his father, telling Andrew that he needs to return home because his mother has died.\n\nAndrew leaves [[Los Angeles]] and returns home to [[New Jersey]] to attend the funeral. He recognizes the grave-diggers as old friends Mark and Dave, who invite him to a party that night. At home, Andrew's father gets him a doctor's appointment for headaches that he's been having.\n\nLater that night, Andrew goes to the party where he meets up with Mark, Dave, and Jesse, an old friend who has just earned a fortune after creating silent [[Velcro]]. After smoking [[marijuana]] and taking [[MDMA|ecstasy]] at the party, he still remains detached.\n\nThe morning after the party, Andrew proceeds to the appointment. In the waiting room, he meets a young woman named Sam, who is a [[pathological lying|pathological liar]]. She later explains that most times she does not know why she lies and will always admit to them afterward. In Andrew's meeting with his doctor, it is revealed that Andrew has been on [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] and other [[mood stabilizer]]s, as well as [[antidepressant]]s, since the age of 10, but has recently stopped taking them. He also says that his father, who is his [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]], put him on the medication. Andrew finds Sam outside the office and offers her a ride home. Sam invites him into her house, and he meets her mother, who inadvertently reveals that Sam has [[epilepsy]]. Andrew tells Sam of his mother's death, and Sam tearfully eulogizes her hamster. After returning home, Andrew's father confronts him and is insistent that they have a talk before Andrew leaves.\n\nLater, Andrew and Jesse sit in the cemetery as Mark digs another grave. Andrew observes Mark stealing jewelry from the corpse he is burying. Andrew then returns to Sam's house, and the two spend the rest of the day together, joining his friends later at Jesse's mansion. Andrew tells Sam that he pushed his mother in frustration when he was nine years old, knocking her over a broken dishwasher in an accident that left her [[paraplegia|paraplegic]]; he says that his father blames him for his mother's [[paralysis]] and put him on his medications to \"curb the anger\" he supposedly harbors. Sam listens, and Andrew then admits his feelings for her.\n\nThe next day, Mark tells Andrew that he needs help \"tracking down\" a going-away present for him. Sam, Andrew, and Mark spend the day together, ending it in a [[quarry]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] where Mark talks to a man named Albert, who is employed in keeping intruders out of the quarry. The three visitors discuss the reasons for which Albert and his wife choose to live in the quarry. Albert explains that living there and exploring the quarry is \"doing something that's completely unique, that's never been done before,\" mirroring an earlier speech by Sam. Finally, Albert explains that what actually matters is living with his family. Andrew is inspired by the conversation, and outside in the rain, he climbs atop a derelict crane and screams into the quarry, joined by Sam and Mark. He and Sam then share a kiss.\n\nWhen Sam and Andrew look at the gift later on, it turns out to be Andrew's mother's favorite pendant, one of the items Mark stole from her grave, sold, and subsequently located. Andrew eventually talks with his father, and states that he was not to blame for his mother's accident and that he will live the rest of his life without medications. He forgives his father and says he wants to build a better relationship with him.\n\nThe morning after, Andrew says his goodbyes to Sam at the airport, while she begs him not to leave. He acknowledges that she has changed his life but also recognizes that he still has to fix his personal problems before continuing the relationship. Andrew boards the flight, and Sam is left crying in a telephone booth. Andrew then returns, saying that he doesn't want to waste any more of his life without Sam. He wonders what to do next, and the two then kiss.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Zach Braff]] as Andrew Largeman, a [[clinical depression|depressed]], heavily medicated, struggling young actor who waits tables for a [[Vietnam]]ese restaurant. When he was nine years old, he accidentally paralyzed his mother by pushing her over a dishwasher door. He has not cried or felt any significant emotions for several years, mainly as a result of the medication he's been supplied with by his estranged father.\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Samantha \"Sam\", an eccentric epileptic and [[Pseudologia fantastica|compulsive liar]], who openly admits to her casual dishonesty and frequently ponders what makes her do it.
