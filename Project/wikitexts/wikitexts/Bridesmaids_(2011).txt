Her [[bakery]] failed during a recent [[Great Recession|recession]], wiping out her savings, and her boyfriend subsequently left her. Having lost her passion, she works at a [[jewelry store]] and shares an apartment with eccentric [[British people|British]] immigrant siblings Gil and Brynn. Annie has a [[casual sex]]ual relationship with the wealthy and self-absorbed Ted, but hopes for something more from him. The only positive presence in her life is her lifelong best friend Lillian. When Lillian becomes engaged to her boyfriend Doug, she asks Annie to be her [[maid of honor]].\n\nAt the [[engagement party]], Annie meets Lillian's bridesmaids: Lillian's long-married and cynical cousin Rita; Lillian's na\u00efve newlywed coworker Becca; Doug's blunt, foul-mouthed but friendly sister Megan; and the wealthy and snobby Helen, Doug's boss' [[trophy wife]]. Annie and Helen are instantly jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian and become increasingly competitive for her attention.\n\nAnnie takes the bridal party to a [[Churrascaria|Brazilian steak restaurant]] before visiting an upscale bridal shop, where Helen uses her influence to gain entry as Annie failed to make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the entire party \u2013 except Helen, who chose not to eat \u2013 begins [[vomiting]] and experiencing uncontrollable [[diarrhea]] from [[food poisoning]], with Lillian voiding her bowels in the middle of the street while wearing a wedding dress.\n\nAnnie's suggestion for a [[bachelorette party]] at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a [[Las Vegas]] trip planned by Helen. Unable to afford a [[First class (aviation)|first-class]] ticket and too proud to allow Helen to pay, Annie books a ticket in economy class. Annie accepts a sedative and liquor from Helen to calm her massive [[fear of flying]] and she begins to hallucinate, ending in a paranoid outburst leading to her being apprehended by a [[U.S. Air Marshal]]. The plane makes an [[emergency landing]] and the party takes a bus back home. Annie apologizes, but Lillian decides it's best if Helen takes over planning the [[bridal shower]] and wedding.\n\nAnnie grows close with Nathan Rhodes, an [[Irish-American]] [[Wisconsin State Patrol]] officer who lets her off without a ticket for broken brake lights. Nathan, who had been a customer at Annie's bakery, repeatedly encourages her to open a new bakery. After a romantic night together, Nathan surprises her with baking supplies, but Annie is annoyed and leaves.\n\nAnnie is fired from the jewelry store for having a profanity-laden argument with a teenage customer and is then kicked out by her roommates, forcing her to move in with her mother. She then travels to Helen's home in [[Chicago]] for the extravagant bridal shower, which is [[Paris]]ian-themed - an idea of Annie's that Helen had previously rejected. After Helen upstages her heartfelt gift by gifting Lillian a trip to Paris, an enraged Annie throws a tantrum and destroys the outside d\u00e9cor; angry that Annie has now ruined every event in her wedding, Lillian kicks her out of the shower and the wedding. Driving home, Annie's still-broken taillights result in a car accident but the other driver flees. Nathan arrives on the scene and admonishes Annie for not fixing her tail lights or taking responsibility for her life. Ted arrives to give Annie a ride, causing Nathan to storm off. When Ted suggests Annie perform oral sex on him in the car, she demands he let her get out and she walks home.\n\nAnnie becomes reclusive, but Megan arrives and motivates her to take control of her life. Annie resumes baking, gets her car fixed, and tries to make amends with Nathan, who ignores her. On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annie's doorstep begging for help finding Lillian, who has disappeared. Helen apologizes to Annie, revealing that people only involve her in their lives because she is good at planning events, but she does not have any true friends and she finds herself alone a lot. Enlisting Nathan's help, they find Lillian at her own apartment, having become overwhelmed by Helen's extravagant wedding planning and fear of leaving her life in Milwaukee. Annie reconciles with Lillian, and resumes her role as maid of honor.\n\nAfter the wedding, Annie and Helen reconcile and agree to become friends. Annie also reconciles with Nathan, and they ride away in his police car.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 168\n   | footer    = Top to bottom: ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' alumnae [[Kristen Wiig]] and [[Maya Rudolph]] star in the film.\n   | image1    = Kristen Wiig SXSW 2011.jpg\n   | alt1      =\n   | caption1  =\n   | image2    = Maya Rudolph.jpg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  =\n  }}\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Annie Walker\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Lillian Donovan\n* [[Rose Byrne]] as Helen Harris III\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Megan Price\n* [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Rita\n* [[Ellie Kemper]] as Becca\n* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as Officer Nathan Rhodes\n* [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Judy Walker \n* [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] as Gil\n* [[Rebel Wilson]] as Brynn\n* [[Michael Hitchcock]] as Don\n* [[Tim Heidecker]] as Douglas \"Doug/Dougie\" Price\n* [[Ben Falcone]] as Air Marshall Jon\n* Dana Powell as Flight Attendant Claire\n* [[Mitch Silpa]] as Flight Attendant Steve\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Rodney\n* [[Jillian Bell]] as Girl at Shower\n* [[Franklyn Ajaye]] as Lillian's father\n* [[Matt Bennett]] as Helen's Stepson\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe cast features brief appearances by several actors from the television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', including [[Jessica St. Clair]], [[Nancy Carell]], [[Hugh Dane]] and [[Andy Buckley]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Jordan |date=2021-06-29 |title=Bridesmaids: Every Actor From The Office Who Appears In The Movie |url=https://screenrant.com/bridesmaids-movie-office-actors-roles/ |access-date=2022-08-24 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Wilson Phillips]] makes a cameo where they sing their hit single \"[[Hold On (Wilson Phillips song)|Hold On]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wieselman |first=Jarett |date=2011-05-27 |title=The story behind Wilson Phillips' 'Bridesmaids' cameo |url=https://pagesix.com/2011/05/27/the-story-behind-wilson-phillips-bridesmaids-cameo/ |access-date=2022-08-24 |website=Page Six |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMajor uncredited appearances include: [[Jon Hamm]] as Ted, Annie's sex buddy;<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Jordan |date=2021-07-19 |title=Why Jon Hamm Is Uncredited In Bridesmaids (Despite Having A Big Role) |url=https://screenrant.com/bridesmaids-jon-hamm-role-uncredited-why/ |access-date=2022-08-24 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> [[Grammy Award]]-winning accordionist, pianist, and composer [[Nick Ariondo]] as the accordion player;<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bridesmaids |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/jots.200161504/ |access-date=2022-08-24 |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref> and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] and Grammy Award winner [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as the old woman in the car.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 31, 2022 |title=Pat Carroll, Voice of Ursula in Disney's Little Mermaid, Dead at 95 |url=https://comicbook.com/movies/news/pat-carroll-dies-95-voice-ursula-disney-the-little-mermaid/ |access-date=2022-08-24 |website=comicbook.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film's co-writers, Wiig and [[Annie Mumolo]], appear together when Mumolo plays the credited role of Nervous Woman on Plane,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rubin |first=Rebecca |date=2021-02-12 |title='Bridesmaids' Duo Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo on 'Barb and Star,' the Antidote to COVID Blues |url=https://variety.com/2021/film/features/kristen-wiig-annie-mumolo-barb-and-star-bridesmaids-1234903488/ |access-date=2022-08-24 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref> while the film's director, [[Paul Feig]], appears uncredited as one of the wedding guests.\n\n[[Paul Rudd]] was to appear as a man who Annie goes on a blind date with, but the scene was cut from the final film.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sperling |first=Nicole |date=April 3, 2017 |title='Bridesmaids' Director Paul Feig Explains Cutting Paul Rudd Out of the Movie |url=https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/03/bridesmaids-paul-rudd-deleted-scene/ |access-date=2022-08-24 |website=EW.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=It was only after the movie was completed that anyone said this had any significance.

McCarthy dispelled the rumors that she would consider returning for a sequel without Wiig saying, \"God, I wouldn't want to. I would never want to. I think it's a terrible idea. I don't know anything about it. But I know that nobody wants to do it unless it's great.
