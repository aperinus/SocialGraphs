It is an adaptation of the novel ''[[Tsotsi (novel)|Tsotsi]]'' by [[Athol Fugard]] and is a South African/UK co-production. Set in the [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra slum]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], it stars [[Presley Chweneyagae]] as David/Tsotsi (''[[Tsotsitaal and Camtho|Tsotsitaal]]'', meaning \"criminal\"), a young street thug who steals a car only to discover a baby in the back seat. It also features [[Kenneth Nkosi]], [[Jerry Mofokeng]], and [[Rapulana Seiphemo]] in supporting roles.<ref>{{Citation|title=Tsotsi|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468565/|access-date=2020-08-13}}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack for the film features [[Kwaito]] music performed by South African artist [[Zola (entertainer)|Zola]] and Afro-pop group [[Mafikizolo]], as well as a score by Mark Kilian and [[Paul Hepker]] featuring the voice of South African [[Protest song|protest singer]] and [[poet]] [[Vusi Mahlasela]].\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with praise primarily aimed at its writing, direction, and performances, particularly Chweneyagae's and Pheto's, [[cinematography]] and emotional weight. It went on to win the 2006 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and was nominated for the [[Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film]], becoming the first [[List of South African films|South African film]] and first African film not made in [[French language|French]] to win the former.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2006-03-06|title=Oscar Win for South African Film|url=http://blog.sa-venues.com/miscellaneous/oscar-win/|access-date=2020-08-13|website=South Africa Travel Blog|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Tsotsi wins Academy Award {{!}} South African History Online|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/tsotsi-wins-academy-award|access-date=2020-08-13|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=HuffPost is now a part of Verizon Media|url=https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=1_cc-session_216ca1a0-a86c-4b4e-a2e3-d18a78c7c33b&lang=en-gb&inline=false|access-date=2020-08-13|website=consent.yahoo.com}}</ref> In 2009, it was unofficially remade in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[Yogi (2009 film)|Yogi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/aug-08-04/ameer-27-08-08.html|title=Ammer's inspiration from South Africa film!|work=behindwoods.com|date=2008-08-27|access-date=2009-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAs his mother is dying of disease, David (Benny Moshe) runs away from an abusive father and lives with other homeless children in a series of large concrete construction pipes. A few years later, David, who now goes by Tsotsi ([[Presley Chweneyagae]]), is the leader of a gang that includes his friends Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe), Aap (Kenneth Nkosi), and Boston (Mothusi Magano).\n\nAfter getting involved in a murder committed by Butcher during a mugging, Tsotsi and Boston get into a fight that leaves Boston badly injured. Tsotsi later shoots Pumla (Nambitha Mpumlwana), a young woman, while [[carjacking|stealing her car]], only to discover a three-month-old in the back seat. Tsotsi hastily strips the car of its valuables and takes the baby back to his shack. Pumla survives the attack and works with a police artist to create a [[Facial composite|composite sketch]] of Tsotsi's face, which is then run in the newspapers.\n\nRealizing that he cannot properly care for the baby on his own, Tsotsi spots Miriam ([[Terry Pheto]]) with a young child strapped to her back, collecting water from a public tap. He follows her to her shack and forces her at gunpoint to feed the kidnapped child. Meanwhile, rich gang leader Fela ([[Zola (entertainer)|Zola]]) begins attempting to recruit Aap, Boston, and Butcher to work for him. When Tsotsi takes the child to Miriam a second time, she asks him to leave the boy with her so that she can care for him on Tsotsi's behalf, and Tsotsi agrees.\n\nTsotsi decides to take care of the injured Boston, and has Aap and Butcher take Boston to his shack. Boston, who is called Teacher Boy by his friends, explains that he never took the teachers' examination. Tsotsi tells him that the gang will raise the money so that Boston can take the exam, which means that they will have to commit another robbery.\n\nTsotsi and Aap go to Pumla's house. When Pumla's husband John (Rapulana Seiphemo) returns from the hospital, they follow him into the house and tie him up. Aap is assigned to watch John while Butcher ransacks the bedroom and Tsotsi collects items from the baby's room.\n\nWhen Aap goes to raid the fridge, John activates the [[Burglar alarm|alarm]]. In a panic, Butcher attempts to kill John with John's pistol that he found. Tsotsi shoots and kills Butcher with his pistol. He and Aap escape in John's car moments before the security company arrives.\n\nTraumatized by Tsotsi's killing of Butcher and fearing that Tsotsi will one day harm him too, Aap decides to leave the gang and quit as Tsotsi's friend. When Tsotsi goes back to Miriam's house, she reveals that she knows where he got the baby, and begs him to return the child to his parents.\n\nTsotsi sets off to return the baby. He reaches John's house and tells John over the [[intercom]] that he will leave the child outside the gate. Meanwhile, an officer stationed at the house alerts Captain Smit ([[Ian Roberts (South African actor)|Ian Roberts]]), who rushes to the scene, arriving just as Tsotsi is about to walk away.\n\nThe police train their guns on Tsotsi, ordering him to return the baby. However, John urges them to lower their weapons so that he can retrieve the baby himself. As Tsotsi holds the baby in his arms, John convinces him to give up the baby. Tsotsi emotionally hands the baby to John, then is told to put up his hands and turns himself in as the film ends.\n\n===Alternate endings===\nThe film ends with Tsotsi raising his hands, and does not disclose what happens thereafter. Two unused endings were shot for the film, which can be seen on the ''Tsotsi'' DVD. In one, Tsotsi is shot in the shoulder, and while the officers are shocked at what happened, he escapes through a large field back to the Alexandra slums after avoiding another shot from the chief police officer. In the other, Tsotsi is shot in the chest while reaching for a milk bottle he brought. He collapses and dies while John and Pumla look on in horror.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Presley Chweneyagae]] as David / Tsotsi: The [[anti-heroic]] leader of a gang of small-time thugs. His name, in [[Tsotsitaal]], means \"thug\" or \"criminal\".\n* [[Mothusi Magano]] as Boston / Teacher boy: A member of Tsotsi's gang and a [[alcoholism|heavy drinker]], Boston was studying to be a teacher before he quit college and moved to the shacks.  He frequently pleads for decency and moderation in the gang's dealings.\n* [[Kenneth Nkosi]] as Aap: Tsotsi's childhood friend. Aap is obedient and happy-go-lucky, and relies on Tsotsi heavily, rarely thinking for himself. His name, in Afrikaans and Tsotsitaal, means \"monkey\".\n* [[Zenzo Ngqobe]] as Butcher: The fourth member of Tsotsi's gang, and the most violent, Butcher is a cheat and a loose cannon who does not hesitate to commit murder.\n* [[Jerry Mofokeng]] as Morris: A [[beggar]] who worked in the [[gold mine]]s until he was permanently crippled when a beam fell on his legs.\n* [[Terry Pheto]] as Miriam: A widow with a young son who lives near Tsotsi in the slum.\n* Nambitha Mpumlwana as Pumla Dube: The mother of the kidnapped child.\n* [[Rapulana Seiphemo]] as John Dube: The father of the kidnapped child.\n* Ian Roberts as Captain Smit: An [[Afrikaner]] police captain.\n* Thembi Nyandeni as Soekie:  Owner of the criminals' local bar.\n* Israel Makoe as Tsotsi's father\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in a [[limited release]] in North America on 24 February 2006 in 6 theatres and ultimately was shown in 122 theatres for a lifetime worldwide gross of $11.54 million.<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics and has a \"certified fresh\" score of 82%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tsotsi/reviews/|title=Tsotsi (Thug) \u2013 Movie Reviews \u2013 Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 131 reviews with an average score of 7.41 out of 10. The critical consensus states: \"Chweneyagae's powerful performance carries this simple yet searing tale of a shantytown teenager's redemption.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tsotsi/|title=Tsotsi (Thug)}}</ref> The film also has a score of 70 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 35 critics indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tsotsi|title=Tsotsi}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a four out of four star rating and stated:<blockquote>How strange, a movie where a bad man becomes better, instead of the other way around. ''Tsotsi'', a film of deep emotional power, considers a young killer whose cold eyes show no emotion, who kills unthinkingly, and who is transformed by the helplessness of a baby. He didn't mean to kidnap the baby, but now that he has it, it looks at him with trust and need, and he is powerless before eyes more demanding than his own. [...] How the story develops is for you to discover. I was surprised to find that it leads toward hope instead of despair; why does fiction so often assume defeat is our destiny?<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/tsotsi-2006|title=Tsotsi Movie Review & Film Summary (2006) \u2013 Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|publisher=rogerebert.com}}</ref></blockquote>''Tsotsi'' won the 2006 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/17/2 |title = Tsotsi |access-date = 27 April 2009 |author = Bradshaw, Peter |author-link = Peter Bradshaw |date = 17 March 2006 |work = [[The Guardian]] }}</ref> and was nominated for the [[Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.timeout.com/film/news/809/golden-globe-nominations-announced.html |title = Golden Globe nominations announced |access-date = 27 April 2009 |date = 14 December 2005 |work = [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090428235248/http://www.timeout.com/film/news/809/golden-globe-nominations-announced.html |archive-date = 28 April 2009 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nGavin Hood was also nominated for the 2005 Non-European Film \u2013 Prix Screen International at the European Film Awards for his work on the film.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.indiewire.com/article/11_films_vying_for_best_non-european_film/ |title = 11 Films Vying for Best non-European film |access-date = 27 April 2009 |author = Hernandez, Eugene |date = 15 November 2005 |publisher = [[indieWire]] }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Tsotsi\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 16 February 2006\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Kwaito]] <br/> [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]]<br />[[African popular music|Afro-pop]]\n| length       = 1:08:15\n| label        = [[Milan Entertainment]]\n| producer     = Emmanuel Chamboredon\n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        =\n| total_length    = 1:08:15\n| extra_column    = Performed by\n| title1        = Mdlwembe\n| writer1       = Kabelo \"Kaybee\" Ikaneng\n| extra1        = [[Zola (entertainer)|Zola]]\n| length1       = 4:17\n| title2        = Bhambatha\n| writer2       = Thabiso Tsotetsi\n| extra2        = Zola\n| length2       = 4:22\n| title3        = Zingu 7\n| writer3       = Kabelo \"Kaybee\" Ikaneng\n| extra3        = Zola\n| length3       = 2:43\n| title4        = Matofotofo\n| writer4       = Composed by Cleopas Monyepao, Lyrics by T.
