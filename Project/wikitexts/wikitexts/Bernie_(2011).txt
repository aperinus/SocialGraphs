The townsfolk consider her cold and unpleasant. Tiede, in his late 30s, and the elderly Nugent quickly become inseparable, frequently traveling and lunching together. Tiede's social life suffers because of Nugent's constant demands for his attention.\n\nTiede murders Nugent after growing weary of the emotional toll of her possessiveness and persistent nagging. For nine months, Tiede excuses her absence in the community with few questions while using her money to support local businesses and neighbors. Finally, Nugent's stockbroker uses Tiede's neglect of previously agreed-upon payments to enlist the help of her estranged family. This results in an authorized police search of her house, which concludes with the discovery of Nugent's corpse in a freezer chest.\n\nThe local [[district attorney]], Danny Buck Davidson, charges Tiede with [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|first-degree (premeditated) murder]]. Tiede is arrested and he soon confesses that he killed Nugent, while claiming her [[emotional abuse]] as a [[mitigating circumstance]]. Despite this confession, many citizens of Carthage still rally to Tiede's defense, with some asserting that Nugent deserved to die. Davidson successfully requests a [[change of venue]] to the town of [[San Augustine, Texas|San Augustine]], 50 miles away, to avoid selecting a biased jury. Despite the absence of evidence of [[premeditation]], Tiede is found guilty as charged and [[Life sentence|imprisoned for life]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Black]] as [[Bernie Tiede]]\n* [[Shirley MacLaine]] as Marjorie \"Margie\" Nugent\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Danny Buck Davidson\n* Brady Coleman as Scrappy Holmes\n* Richard Robichaux as Lloyd Hornbuckle\n* Rick Dial as Don Leggett\n* Brandon Smith as Sheriff Huckabee\n* Larry Jack Dotson as the Rev.
