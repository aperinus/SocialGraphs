Set before and after [[World War I]], it describes a tragic [[love triangle]] involving French [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] Jim ([[Henri Serre]]), his shy [[Austria]]n friend Jules ([[Oskar Werner]]), and Jules's girlfriend and later wife Catherine ([[Jeanne Moreau]]).<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news |last1=Bradshaw |first1=Peter |title=Jules et Jim review \u2013 Truffaut's love triangle is a whirlwind masterpiece |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/jules-et-jim-review-truffauts-love-triangle-is-a-whirlwind-masterpiece |access-date=6 June 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=2 February 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe film is based on [[Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9]]'s 1953 semi-[[autobiographical novel]] describing his relationship with young writer [[Franz Hessel]] and Helen Grund, whom Hessel married.<ref>[http://www.telerama.fr/idees/stephane-hessel-un-homme-engage-j-ai-toujours-ete-du-cote-des-dissidents,29906.php \"St\u00e9phane Hessel, un homme engag\u00e9 : 'J\u2019ai toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des dissidents'\"] T\u00e9l\u00e9rama (March 12, 2011).

He later befriended the elderly Roch\u00e9, who had published his first novel at the age of 74. The author approved of the young director's interest in adapting his work to another medium.\n\nThe film won the 1962 Grand Prix of French film prizes, the \u00c9toile de Cristal, and Jeanne Moreau won that year's prize for best actress.\nThe film ranked 46 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010.<ref>{{cite web \n| title = The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema \u2013 46.

Jules ([[Oskar Werner]]) is a shy writer from [[Austria]] who forges a friendship with the more extroverted Frenchman Jim ([[Henri Serre]]). They share an interest in the world of the arts and the [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] lifestyle. At a slide show, they become entranced with a bust of a goddess and her serene smile and travel to see the ancient statue on an island in the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\nAfter encounters with several women, they meet the free-spirited, capricious Catherine ([[Jeanne Moreau]]), a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] for the statue with the serene smile. The three become inseparable. Although she begins a relationship with Jules, both men are affected by her presence and her attitude toward life. Jim continues to be involved with his girlfriend Gilberte, usually seeing her apart from the others. A few days before war is declared, Jules and Catherine move to Austria to get married. Both men serve during the war, on opposing sides; each fears throughout the conflict the potential for facing the other or learning that he might have killed his friend.\n\nAfter the wartime separation, Jim visits, and later stays with, Jules and Catherine in their chalet in the [[Black Forest]]. Jules and Catherine by then have a young daughter, Sabine. Jules confides the tensions in their marriage. He tells Jim that Catherine torments and punishes him at times with numerous affairs, and she once left him and Sabine for three months.\n\nShe flirts with and attempts to seduce Jim, who has never forgotten her. Jules, fearful that Catherine might leave him forever, gives his blessing for Jim to marry Catherine so that he may continue to visit them and see her. For a while, the three adults live happily with Sabine in the chalet, until tensions between Jim and Catherine arise because of their inability to have a child.\n\nJim leaves Catherine and returns to Paris. After several exchanges of letters between Catherine and Jim, they resolve to reunite when she learns that she is pregnant. The reunion does not occur after Jules writes to tell Jim that Catherine suffered a miscarriage.\n\nAfter a time, Jim runs into Jules in Paris. He learns that Jules and Catherine have returned to France. Catherine tries to win Jim back, but he rebuffs her, saying he is going to marry Gilberte. Furious, she pulls a gun on him, but he wrestles it away and flees. He later encounters Jules and Catherine in a famous (at that time) movie theater, the Studio des Ursulines.\n\nThe three of them stop at an outdoor cafe. Catherine asks Jim to get into her car, saying she has something to tell him. She asks Jules to watch them and drives the car off a damaged bridge into the river, killing herself and Jim. Jules is left to bury the ashes of his friends in the [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery]] [[columbarium]]; Catherine wanted her ashes to be scattered in the wind from a hilltop, but at the time it wasn't legal.<ref>Fry, Nicholas (translator).

The critic [[Ginette Vincendeau]] has defined this as, \"beautiful, but in a kind of natural way; sexy, but intellectual at the same time, a kind of cerebral sexuality\u2014this was the hallmark of the ''nouvelle vague'' woman.\" Though she isn't in the film's title, Catherine is \"the structuring absence.
