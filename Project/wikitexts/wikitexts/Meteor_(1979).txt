The film was a [[box office flop]] and received negative reviews,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/8333-REVIEW-METEOR-1979-STARRING-SEAN-CONNERY,-NATALIE-WOOD,-BRIAN-KEITH-AND-KARL-MALDEN,-BLU-RAY-RELEASE-FROM-KINO-LORBER-STUDIO-CLASSICS.html|title=REVIEW: \"METEOR\" (1979) |publisher=www.cinemaretro.com|access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref> but it was nonetheless nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Sound]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter the asteroid [[3361 Orpheus|Orpheus]] in the [[Asteroid Belt]] is hit by a [[comet]], dozens of asteroid fragments are sent on a collision course towards Earth, along with a five-mile fragment which will cause an [[Extinction event|extinction-level event]]. While the United States government engages in political maneuvering, the smaller asteroid fragments preceding the main body wreak havoc on the planet, revealing the threat. The United States has a secret [[orbit]]ing [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] platform satellite named ''Hercules'', which was designed by Dr. Paul Bradley ([[Sean Connery]]). It was intended to defend Earth against a threat like Orpheus, but instead was commandeered by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] to become an orbiting weapon now aimed at the Soviet Union. After many calculations, it is determined that the fourteen nuclear missiles on board Hercules are not enough to stop the asteroid.\n\nThe United States has known that the Soviet Union also has a similar weapons satellite called ''Peter the Great'' in orbit, with its sixteen nuclear warheads pointed down at the United States.  Needing the additional firepower to stop Orpheus, the President ([[Henry Fonda]]) goes on national television and reveals the existence of ''Hercules'', explaining it was created to meet the threat that Orpheus represents.  He also offers the Soviets a chance to save face by announcing they, too, had the same program and their own satellite weapon.  To coordinate the counter-effort between the two countries, Bradley requests a Soviet scientist named Dr. Alexei Dubov ([[Brian Keith]]).\n\nBradley and Harry Sherwood ([[Karl Malden]]) of [[NASA]] meet at the control center for ''Hercules'', located beneath [[195 Broadway]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. Major General Adlon ([[Martin Landau]]) is the commander of the facility. Dubov and his interpreter Tatiana Donskaya ([[Natalie Wood]]) arrive, and Bradley gets to work on breaking the ice between them. Since Dubov cannot admit the existence of the Soviet device, he agrees to Bradley's proposal that they work on the \"theoretical application\" of how a \"theoretical\" Soviet space platform's weapons would be coordinated with the American platform.\n\nMeanwhile, more meteorite fragments strike Earth (one inside [[Siberia]]), and the Soviets finally agree to join in the effort. Both satellites are coordinated, and turned towards the incoming large asteroid as smaller fragments continue to strike the planet, causing great damage, including a deadly [[avalanche]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] and a [[tsunami]] which devastates Hong Kong. With hours remaining prior to Orpheus' impact, as planned, ''Peter the Great''{{'}}s missiles are launched first because of its relative position to the asteroid, with ''Hercules''{{'}}s missiles timed to be fired 40 minutes later.\n\nImmediately prior to ''Hercules''{{'}}s missiles being launched, a splinter fragment is discovered to be heading towards the command center in New York City.  If the center is destroyed, ''Hercules'' will not be able to launch.  With seconds to spare, ''Hercules'' receives the signal to fire from the command center, and launches its missiles.  The splinter impacts the city, destroying the top half of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] twin towers in a direct hit, and creating a large crater in [[Central Park]]. Several workers inside the control center are killed when the facility is partially destroyed by the collapse of the building above, and the survivors are forced to work their way out of the control center by going through the [[New York Subway System|New York subway system]], which becomes a trap due to water from the [[East River]] flooding the tunnels. Meanwhile, the two flights of missiles link up into three successively larger waves. The ''Hercules'' crew reaches a crowded subway station and waits while others try to dig them out.\n\nEventually, the missiles reach the meteoroid. The first wave of missiles strikes the rock, causing a small explosion, the second wave follows with a larger blast, and the third wave creates an enormous explosion. When the dust clears, the asteroid appears obliterated. In New York City, the radios broadcast the good news: Orpheus is no longer a danger to Earth. Just then, the subway station occupants are rescued.\n\nLater, at an airport, Dubov, Tatiana, Bradley and others exchange goodbyes before Dubov and Tatiana depart on a plane for the Soviet Union.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Sean Connery]] as Dr. Paul Bradley\n* [[Natalie Wood]] as Tatiana Donskaya \n* [[Karl Malden]] as Harry Sherwood \n* [[Brian Keith]] as Dr. Alexei Dubov \n* [[Martin Landau]] as General Adlon \n* [[Trevor Howard]] as Sir Michael Hughes \n* [[Richard Dysart]] as Secretary of Defense \n* [[Henry Fonda]] as The President \n* [[Joseph Campanella]] as General Easton \n* [[Bo Brundin]] as Rolf Manheim \n* [[Roger Robinson (actor)|Roger Robinson]] as Bill Hunter \n* [[Michael Zaslow]] as Sam Mason \n* [[Bibi Besch]] as Helen Bradley\n* [[Sybil Danning]] as Girl Skier\n}}\n\n==Production==\nTheodore R. Parvin received the idea for the story from a ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' article by Isaac Asimov about a meteor hitting a major city in the United States. Parvin hired [[Edmund H. North]] to write the screenplay, who took further inspiration from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[Project Icarus (asteroid defense)|Project Icarus]]. However, Ronald Neame and Sean Connery disliked both North's script and a rewrite by [[Steven Bach]], and so hired [[Stanley Mann]] to completely re-write the screenplay. This led to a Writers Guild of America dispute over whether North should be credited as a co-writer.<ref name=\"afi\" />\n\nDuring the writing of the North's first draft, Parvin secured financing and investment from the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]], [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[Nippon Herald Films]], and [[American International Pictures]].<ref name=\"afi\" /> The film was an [[American International Pictures]] co-production with the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] in [[British Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite news|author=Cohen, Jerry|author2=Soble, Ronald L.|title='Meteor'--How a Movie Came to Be: HOW 'METEOR' BECAME A MOVIE A Movie Is Born; a Meteor Is the Star A Meteoric Idea Becomes a Movie MOVIE-MAKING|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 2, 1978|page=a1}}</ref> $2.7 million of the budget came from AIP.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cohen, Jerry; Soble, Ronald L.; Film Casting: Finding the 'Horse for the Course': Casting: High Stakes Gamble Assembling 'Meteor' Cast: Ticklish Job in a Multimillion-Dollar Movie Project CASTING FOR MAJOR FILM--WAGERING IN MILLIONS CASTING FOR MOVIE CASTING FOR HIGH-COST FILM|work=Los Angeles Times|date=4 July 1978|page=a1}}</ref>\n\nNeame cast Natalie Wood as Tatiana because she was the daughter of [[Russian Americans|Russian immigrants]], and she worked with George Rubinstein to perfect a Leningrad accent.
