The film stars Khan himself, along with [[Darsheel Safary]], [[Tanay Chheda]], Sachet Engineer, [[Vipin Sharma]] and [[Tisca Chopra]]. The film explores the life and imagination of Ishaan (Safary), an 8-year-old boy. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to a [[boarding school]]. Ishaan's new art teacher Nikumbh (Khan) suspects that he is [[dyslexic]] and helps him to overcome his reading disorder.\n\nCreative director and writer [[Amole Gupte]] initially developed the idea with his wife [[Deepa Bhatia]], who served as the film's editor. [[Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy]] composed the film's score, and [[Prasoon Joshi]] wrote the lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in [[Mumbai]] and in [[Panchgani]]'s [[New Era High School]], and some of the school's students make appearances.\n\n''Taare Zameen Par'' made its theatrical debut in India on 21 December 2007, earning {{INR}}1.35&nbsp;billion worldwide, thus proving to be a commercial success. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its novel story, screenplay, direction, dialogues, soundtrack and performances of the cast. The film also proved to be vital in raising awareness about dyslexia.\n\nA recipient of [[List of accolades received by Taare Zameen Par|several accolades]], ''Taare Zameen Par'' was India's official entry at the [[81st Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best Foreign Film]], but did not proceed further. At the [[55th National Film Awards]], it won 3 awards \u2013 [[National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare|Best Film on Family Welfare]], [[National Film Award for Best Lyrics|Best Lyrics]] ([[Prasoon Joshi]] for \"Maa\") and [[National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer|Best Male Playback Singer]] ([[Shankar Mahadevan]] for \"Maa\"). At the [[53rd Filmfare Awards]], it received a leading 11 nominations, including [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Safary), [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Aamir Khan) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Chopra), and won a leading 5 awards, including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Aamir Khan) and [[Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist|Best Lyricist]] (Joshi for \"Maa\"). \n\n[[UTV Motion Pictures|UTV Home Entertainment]] released a DVD for Indian audiences in 2008. [[Disney]]'s later release of the international edition DVD marked the first purchase of distribution rights for an Indian film by a global company.\n\n== Plot ==\nIshaan Awasthi is an 8-year-old boy who has trouble following school, though he is assumed by all to hate learning, and is belittled for it. His imagination, creativity, and talent for art and painting are often disregarded. His father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects his sons to excel, and his mother, Maya Awasthi, is a housewife frustrated by her inability to educate Ishaan. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohan Awasthi, is an exemplary student in whose shadow Ishaan remains. One day, Ishaan and his parents are called by Ishaan's principal to discuss his failures in class. Fed up of hearing Ishaan's failures and lack of improvement, Nandkishore sends Ishaan, mid-term, to a [[boarding school]]. Alone there, he rapidly sinks into a state of fear, anxiety, and [[depression (mood)|depression]], which is only worsened by the teachers there and their strict and abusive regime. His only friend is Rajan Damodaran, a physically disabled boy who is one of the top students and resides with his family there, as his father is part of the school's board. Ishaan contemplates suicide one day, but Rajan prevents him.\n\nRam Shankar Nikumbh, a cheerful and optimistic instructor at the Tulips School for young children with [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], joins the boarding school the same day, replacing the authoritarian Mr. Holkar, the school's former art teacher. Ram's teaching style is markedly different from that of Holkar's, and he quickly notes Ishaan's unhappiness that day after he fails to draw anything during the class. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of [[dyslexia]]. Ram then visits the Awasthis in [[Mumbai]], where he is surprised to discover Ishaan's hidden interest in art. Flustered, he demonstrates to Maya and Yohan how Ishaan has extreme difficulty in understanding letters and words due to dyslexia, and his poverty in sports skills stems from his poor motor ability. Nandkishore labels it as an intellectual disability and dismisses it as laziness.\n\nBack at school, Ram brings up the topic of dyslexia in a class by offering a [[List of people with dyslexia|list of famous dyslexic people]]. He comforts Ishaan, telling him how he struggled as a child as well. Ram obtains the principal's permission to become Ishaan's tutor. With gradual care, he works to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using [[Dyslexia#Management|remedial techniques]] developed by dyslexia specialists. Eventually, both Ishaan's demeanor and his grades improve. One day Nandkishore visits the school and tells Ram that he and his wife have read up on Dyslexia and understand the condition. Ram mentions that what Ishaan needs more than understanding is that someone loves him. Outside Nandkishore sees Ishaan reading from a board. With teary eyes, he is unable to face his son and walks away.\n\nAt the end of the school year, Ram organises an arts and crafts contest for the staff and students, judged by artist [[Lalita Lajmi]]. Ishaan's work makes him the winner and Ram, who paints Ishaan's portrait, is declared the runner-up. The principal announces that Ram has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school, they are left speechless by the transformation in him. Overcome with emotion, Nandkishore thanks Ram. Before leaving, Ishaan runs toward Ram, who lifts him high up in a hug.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:DarsheelSafary.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A smiling, young Indian boy wearing a red T-shirt, blue and white jacket, and red hat.|165px|right|[[Darsheel Safary]]'s initial screentest lacked dialogue.

Their initial work began as a short story that evolved into a screenplay over seven years. Deepa Bhatia later stated in an interview with ''[[The Hindu]]'' that her original inspiration was not dyslexia but rather the childhood of Japanese filmmaker [[Akira Kurosawa]], who performed poorly in school. Her goal was thus to explore the story of \"a child who did not fit into the school stream.\" She referenced a specific moment in Kurosawa's biography where he began to excel after meeting an attentive art teacher, and noted that this scene \"became the inspiration for how a teacher could transform the life of a student\".<ref name=\"leap\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008020350030200.htm&date=2008/02/03/&prd=mag& |title=A leap of faith |last=Vij |first=Gauri |date=3 February 2008 |website=The Hindu |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407235243/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008020350030200.htm&date=2008%2F02%2F03%2F&prd=mag& |archive-date=7 April 2008 |access-date=11 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of developing the character of a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the subject children's identities in the final version of the script.<ref name=leap />\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"While Amole has written what I think is a brilliant and moving script, his contribution towards the film is not limited to that of a writer.

This subplot, which was filmed but later cut, would have tied into the original ending for the movie. In this planned ending, a \"ghost image\" separates from Ishaan after the art competition and runs to the sports field; the film would end on a freeze frame of Ishaan's \"ghost image\" successfully making the leap. Aamir Khan, however, disliked this proposed ending and convinced Gupte to rewrite it.\n\nWith the working title no longer relevant,<ref name=\"deleted\">{{cite video |people=Khan, Aamir |date=12 January 2010 |title=Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: Deleted Scenes |medium=DVD |publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment}}</ref> Khan, Gupte, and Bhatia discussed several alternatives,<ref name=proud /> eventually deciding on ''Taare Zameen Par.''

Event occurs at approximately 15:15</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Khan also made use of illusory camera tricks. For example, the opening scene of Ishaan collecting fish outside his school was shot on location and at [[Film City, Mumbai|Film City]]. Shots focusing on Ishaan took place at the former, while those involving the gutter [[Vivarium|terrarium]] were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tank's water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film.<ref name=\"2:45\">''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 2:45</ref> The film's next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the \"absolutely petrified\" Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 8:30</ref> Ishaan's nightmare\u2014he becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowd\u2014was filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set.

Event occurs at approximately 48:00</ref>\n\nAll the school sequences were filmed on location. The production team searched for a Mumbai school with an \"oppressive\" feel to establish the \"heaviness of being in a metropolitan school\",<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''.

The production staff placed acrylic sheets invisible to the naked eye on the classroom windows to mask the sounds of nearby crowds and helicopters.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 23:00</ref> [[New Era High School]] served as Ishaan's boarding school. The change of setting was a \"breath of fresh air\" for the production crew, who moved from Ishaan's small house in Mysore Colony, [[Chembur]] to the \"vast, beautiful environs\" of [[Panchgani]].<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 11:00</ref>\n\nProduction relied on [[stock footage]] for the brief scene of a bird feeding its babies. Khan carefully selected a clip to his liking, but learned three weeks before the film's release that the footage was not available in the proper format. With three days to replace it or else risk delaying the release, Khan made do with what he could find. He says that he \"cringes\" every time he sees it.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:00:15</ref>\n\n=== Children ===\nReal schoolchildren participated throughout the movie's filming. Khan credited them with the film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them.<ref name=bends /> Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and went to great lengths to attend to them.<ref name=proud /> The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''.

Event occurs at approximately 35:00</ref> Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate.<ref name=\"bumbum\">''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:11:30</ref> To fill in the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''.

Event occurs at approximately 2:14:00</ref>\n\nNew to acting, the children often made errors such as staring into the camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised that this would be a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to \"bore the hell out of [them]\", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 21:00</ref> A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people with dyslexia, and the children's responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3\u20134&nbsp;days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were \"jaded\". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:49:00</ref> The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was {{convert|15|ft}} deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:56:00</ref>\n\nKhan found it important that the audience connect the film to real children, and had Pandey travel throughout India filming documentary-style footage of children from all walks of life. Those visuals were integrated into the end credits.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''.

Halfway through its creation, however, Khan felt it was not turning out as he had envisioned it.

A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence\u2014this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan\u2014but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he is different from the rest. This concept is furthered by [[Slow motion#In action films|speed ramping]] and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 17:30</ref> The twilight scenes of \"Maa\" were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample\u2014they planned to replace him with another singer\u2014but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''.

In his opinion, the accompanying song should focus on what a child wants\u2014to be free\u2014and be told from the first-person perspective instead of \"Kholo Kholo{{\"'}}s second person. When Khan took over as director, he opted to use \"Mera Jahan\"\u2014a song written by Gupte\u2014and moved \"Kholo Kholo\" to the art fair. Viewers of test screenings were divided over the truancy scene. Half thoroughly enjoyed it but the rest complained that it was too long, did not make sense, and merely showed \"touristy\" visuals of Mumbai. Khan nevertheless kept the scene, because he \"connected deeply\" with it and felt that it established Ishaan's world.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''.

Instead of using a studio, he and the trio [[Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy]] recorded it at Khan's home in Panchgani, to clear their heads and not be in the mindset of the city. As they watched the film, Khan pointed out when he wanted music to begin and of what type. Ehsaan Noorani noted that this strategy allowed the score to have a \"spontaneity to it.\"<ref>''Like Stars on Earth Bonus Disc: The Making...''. Event occurs at approximately 55:00</ref>\n\nDifferent styles of background music were used to convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes.<ref name=\"2:45\" /> The music of the opening scene\u2014the recurring \"Ishaan's Theme,\" which represents the character's peace of mind\u2014overpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after he snaps back to reality.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 4:30</ref> But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaan's family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his son's dilemma. The almost seven-minute long scene scarcely used any background music, to slow the pace and make it seem more realistic.<ref>''Like Stars on Earth DVD commentary''. Event occurs at approximately 1:38:30</ref>\n\n=== Promotional material ===\nWhen filming part of the montage that details Ishaan's tutoring by Nikumbh, Khan immediately decided it would be the \"key art of the film\".

Though Chakravarty was puzzled by Ishaan's trouble in simple arithmetic\u2014a trait of [[dyscalculia]] rather than dyslexia\u2014he reasoned it was meant to \"enhance the image of [Ishaan's] helplessness and disability\". Labeling Ishaan an example of \"dyslexic savant syndrome\", he especially praised the growth of Ishaan's artistic talents after receiving help and support from Nikumbh, and deemed it the \"most important (and joyous) neurocognitive phenomenon\" of the film. This improvement highlights cosmetic neurology, a \"major and therapeutically important issue\" in [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[neuropsychology]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chakravarty |first=Ambar |year=2009 |title=Taare Zameen Par and dyslexic savants |journal=Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=99\u2013103 |doi=10.4103/0972-2327.53077 |pmc=2812748 |pmid=20142854}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, in their article \"Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'\" for the ''Indian Journal of Psychiatry'', T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna wrote that the film \"deserves to be vastly appreciated as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life\". They also felt it blended \"modern professional knowledge\" with a \"humane approach\" in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the \"present age where everyone is in a restless hurry\". The pair wrote, \"This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading to a state of mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?\" The film depicts how \"threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children\", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan \"dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities\". Overall, the pair found a \"naive oversimplification\" in the film. With India \"only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability\", however, they \"easily [forgave the film's fault] under artistic license\".<ref name=\"ground\">{{Cite journal |last1=Rao |first1=T.
