The film also features supporting performances from [[Roberts Blossom]] and [[Kelly Preston]].\n\nWritten by Bill Phillips and based on [[Stephen King]]'s [[Christine (novel)|1983 novel of the same name]], the movie follows the changes in the lives of Arnie Cunningham, his friends, his family, and his teenage enemies after Arnie buys a classic red and white 1958 [[Plymouth Fury]] (for 250 dollars) named Christine, license plate CQB 241, a car that seems to have a mind of its own and a jealous, possessive personality, which has a bad influence on Arnie.\n\nUpon its release, the film grossed $21 million at the US box office. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and has since become a [[cult classic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticmass.net/cult/christine-movie-1984/|title=Christine|last=Suckley|first=Jamie|date=July 31, 2013|website=Static Mass Emporium|access-date=September 27, 2016|archive-date=October 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031152743/http://staticmass.net/cult/christine-movie-1984/|url-status=live}}</ref> A remake is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=August 2022}}\nIn September 1957, at a [[Chrysler Corporation]] [[assembly plant]] in [[Detroit]], the hood of a newly assembled, red-and-white 1958 [[Plymouth Fury]] abruptly slams down and crushes the hand of a line worker inspecting its front end. Another worker climbs in to sit behind the wheel, letting the ash from his cigar fall on the front seat. At the end of the shift, the line supervisor notices the car's radio is playing music; when he opens the door to shut it off, the worker's corpse falls out onto the floor.\n\nTwenty-one years later, in September 1978, awkward and unpopular teenager Arnold \"Arnie\" Cunningham lives in Rockbridge, California, with only one friend, football player Dennis Guilder. Arnie's life begins to change when he buys the used, dilapidated Fury from George LeBay, whose late brother Roland had originally owned it. George tells Arnie several details about the Fury, including its name: \"Christine\". Since his hostile and strict parents will not let him keep the vehicle at their house, Arnie starts restoring Christine at a do-it-yourself garage and junkyard owned by Will Darnell.\n\nAs Arnie spends more time with Christine, he discards his glasses, dresses more like a 1950s' [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]], and develops an arrogant, paranoid personality. Unbeknownst to Arnie, his mother Regina tells Dennis that Roland actually committed suicide in Christine. Confronted by Dennis, George admits that Roland's daughter had choked to death inside the car and that his wife also committed suicide in it. George forced Roland to get rid of Christine after his wife's death, but it   returned to him after three weeks.\n\nDuring a football game, Dennis becomes distracted upon noticing Arnie kissing his new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, in front of a now-perfect Christine and is tackled, suffering a career-ending injury. One of Christine's windshield wipers stops working while the pair are on a date at a drive-in movie theater. When Arnie gets out to fix it, Leigh begins to choke on a hamburger as an oldies [[rock and roll]] song starts to play on the radio. The doors lock themselves, leaving Arnie unable to help her, but she frees herself and is saved when a man in a nearby car administers the [[Heimlich maneuver]]. Soon afterward, school bully Buddy Repperton \u2013 angry with Arnie over being expelled after a confrontation in shop class \u2013 vandalizes Christine along with his gang (Peter \"Moochie\" Welch, Don Vandenberg, and Richie Trelawney). Devastated and determined to repair Christine, Arnie encourages her to repair herself, which she does.\n\nChristine then seeks out the vandals; crushing Moochie in an alley, triggering a gas station explosion that kills Don and Richie and sets her on fire, and finally running down and killing Buddy himself. After the badly burned Christine returns to Darnell's garage, Darnell opens the driver's door to find it empty. Darnell sits in the driver's seat and is crushed to death against the steering wheel when Christine pushes the seat forward, as another oldies song plays on the radio. The next morning, Christine is back in her slot and fully repaired, with Darnell's body still in the driver's seat. State police detective Rudolph Junkins becomes suspicious of Arnie, having discovered paint from Christine at the scenes of two gang members' deaths. However, he has no direct evidence to implicate Arnie, who has an alibi and denies all involvement.\n\nJunkins either is unaware or doubtful that Christine can drive herself. Following the choking incident and Christine's initial vandalization, Leigh breaks up with Arnie. Dennis and Leigh - who have both become aware of Christine's supernatural and sinister nature - conclude that the only way to save Arnie from the car's influence is to destroy it. They set a trap for Christine at Darnell's garage: Dennis waits at the controls of a bulldozer while Leigh stands ready to close the garage doors and cut off Christine's retreat once it enters. However, having hidden under a pile of debris in the garage the entire time, Christine strikes when Leigh assumes her position at the door controls. Attempting to kill Leigh, Christine crashes through Darnell's office. Arnie, who has  been driving the car himself and was possessed, is thrown through the windshield and fatally impaled on a shard of glass. Christine plays another oldies song as Arnie lays dying.\n\nDennis and Leigh attack Christine with the bulldozer, but she continually repairs herself and retaliates. The battle continues until they repeatedly drive back and forth over Christine, damaging her so much that she is unable to immediately regenerate. The next day, Dennis, Leigh and Junkins watch as Christine's remains are compacted by a [[car crusher]] in a junkyard and dropped on the ground as a solid block. Junkins praises the teens for defeating the demonic vehicle, despite them mourning Arnie's death and their inability to save him from Christine's corruption. As the camera zooms in slowly on the car's remains, a portion of the front grill twitches slightly before going still.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Keith Gordon]] as Arnie Cunningham\n* [[John Stockwell (actor)|John Stockwell]] as Dennis Guilder\n* [[Alexandra Paul]] as Leigh Cabot\n* [[Robert Prosky]] as Will Darnell\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Detective Rudy Junkins\n* [[Christine Belford]] as Regina Cunningham\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as George LeBay\n* William Ostrander as Clarence \"Buddy\" Repperton\n* [[David Spielberg]] as Mr. Casey\n* [[Malcolm Danare]] as Peter \"Moochie\" Welch\n* Steven Tash as Richie Trelawney\n* [[Stuart Charno]] as Don Vandenberg\n* [[Kelly Preston]] as Roseanne\n* Marc Poppel as Chuck\n* Robert Darnell as Michael Cunningham\n*Jack Faust as referee\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Conception===\nProducer Richard Kobritz had previously produced the [[miniseries]] ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]'', also based on a Stephen King novel.

John Carpenter placed ads throughout [[Southern California]] searching for models of the car, and was able to purchase twenty-four of them in various states of disrepair, which were used to build a total of seventeen copies of the film car.{{sfn|Von Doviak|2014}} All cars were two door hardtops.\n\nTotal production for the 1958 Plymouth Fury was only 5,303, and they were difficult to find and expensive to buy at the time. In addition, the real-life Furys only came in one color, \"Sandstone White\" with a \"Buckskin Beige\" interior, seen on the other Furys on the assembly line during the initial scenes of the movie, though the car in King's novel was ordered with a red-and-white custom paint job.{{Sfn|Benjaminson|1994|p=124}} The original Furys had anodized gold trim on the body and Fury script on the rear fender. In order to bypass the problem of obtaining the rare trim, the cars featured the more common Belvedere \"Dartline\" trim. Several vehicles were destroyed during filming, but most of the cars were Savoy and Belvedere models dressed to look like the Fury. At least one '57 Savoy was used, its front end modified to look like a '58.\n\nSome of King's details about the car were incorrect in the novel. The 1956-1958 Plymouth Fury was only available as a two-door coupe, while the book described it as a four-door sedan, which would have made it a Savoy or Belvedere model. During Leigh's choking scene, Christine is shown to have common vertical lock \"buttons\" on the inside door panels. Chrysler vehicles of this era were not equipped with such buttons. To lock the door, the door handle has to be pushed downward. King also mentions a shift lever for the automatic transmission, but in real life it had push-button controls.\n\nOriginally, Carpenter had not planned to film the car's regeneration scenes, but gave special effects supervisor Roy Arbogast three weeks to devise a way for the car to rebuild itself. Arbogast and his team made rubber molds from one of the cars, including a whole front end. One of the cars was stripped of its engine to accommodate internally-mounted [[hydraulic]]s that pulled the framework inward, crumpling the car, with the shot then run backwards in the final film.<ref name=\"fast\"/>\n\nTwenty-three cars were used in the film.<ref name=\"Muir\"/> Initially sold as scrap metal after filming ended, one of the best known surviving vehicles was eventually rescued from the junkyard and restored. It was subsequently bought by collector Bill Gibson of [[Pensacola, Florida]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ciccicioppo |first1=Andrea |title=Film star on display at All-Chrysler Nationals |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AWNB&req_dat=0F974815D238C2C9&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F13CD4DCD64C2CC10 |access-date=27 October 2021 |work=The Sentinel |date=July 11, 2008 |location=Carlisle, PA |via=NewsBank |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nOne of the Christines was auctioned off at an auto-auction in Florida in January 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Connolly |first1=Patrick |title=THE WHEEL DEAL - Highlights not to be missed at world's largest collector car auction |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AWNB&req_dat=0F974815D238C2C9&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F17853029F3A74058 |access-date=27 October 2021 |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=January 4, 2020 |page=1A |via=NewsBank |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=1958 PLYMOUTH FURY |url=https://www.mecum.com/lots/FL0120-397333/1958-plymouth-fury/ |website=Mecum Auctions |access-date=27 October 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Christine'' was released in North America on December 9, 1983, to 1,045 theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=christine.htm|work=Box Office Mojo|access-date=November 28, 2015|title=Christine (1983)|archive-date=December 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208061027/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=christine.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn its opening weekend ''Christine'' brought in $3,408,904 landing at #4.
