It stars [[William Hurt]], [[Marlee Matlin]] (in her film debut), [[Piper Laurie]], and [[Philip Bosco]]. The film's narrative follows two employees at a [[Schools for the deaf|school for the deaf]]: a [[deaf]] custodian and a hearing speech teacher, whose conflicting ideologies on speech and deafness create tension and discord in their developing romantic relationship.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/children-lesser-god|title=Children of a Lesser God |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=2019-02-04|archive-date=2019-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020051/https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/children-lesser-god|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crilley|first=Mariah|date=2013-01-01|title='individual yet as one': Performing Deafness and Performing Community in Mark Medoff's Children of a Lesser God|url=https://dsc.duq.edu/etd/443|journal=Electronic Theses and Dissertations|access-date=2019-02-04|archive-date=2019-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208004120/https://dsc.duq.edu/etd/443/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Children of a Lesser God'' premiered at the [[37th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Golden Bear]], while Haines received a [[Silver Bear|Special Silver Bear]]. It was theatrically released on October 3, 1986, by [[Paramount Pictures]] to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Haines's direction, the screenplay, and particularly the performances of Hurt, Matlin, and Laurie. The film grossed $101.5 million worldwide on a $10.5 million budget. It received five nominations at the [[59th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Hurt), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Laurie), [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Matlin). At age 21, Matlin became [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest winners 3|the youngest Best Actress winner]] as well as the [[List of Academy Award records|first deaf winner in Oscar history]].<ref name=\"hollywoodspeaks\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nAn energetic new teacher, James Leeds ([[William Hurt]]), arrives at a school for the deaf and hard of hearing in [[New England]]. He soon sees a young deaf woman working as a [[janitor]]. The woman, Sarah Norman ([[Marlee Matlin]]), a former top student, is not well-regarded by the hearing staff, but seems to integrate well with the deaf students. James begins to try to talk with her, arranging a meeting through her boss, pursuing her after school while she is attempting to clean, and persisting despite being rejected several times. She eventually agrees to go to dinner, and he watches her dance from the sidelines.\n\nSarah does not want to vocalize, and James eventually agrees not to try to force her to\u2014a promise he later breaks. He finds out that Sarah refuses to visit her home, and assumes her mother ([[Piper Laurie]]) has stopped reaching out. Through her mother, James finds out that Sarah and her sister Ruth were popular, and according to her mother her peers treated Sarah as if she weren't different from other women. Unfortunately, Sarah later reveals that she was sorely used by the unnamed \"boys\", and may have been a victim of sex abuse. Such treatment has led Sarah to mistrust men and resist interacting with anyone.  Later, in a pool scene, he walks in on her swimming nude. James confesses that he is falling in love with Sarah. She seems to be afraid. He falls into the pool on purpose, which changes the mood of the interaction.  They share a passionate kiss in the water, then James undresses. It is implied that they had sex that night for the first time.\n\nThe relationship between James and Sarah develops. The school superintendent warns James that he doesn't believe the relationship will work, but James is adamant that he will stay with Sarah because he loves her. James choreographs a dance with his deaf students, in which they lip-sync to a song on a stage in front of their parents. Sarah sees this performance and becomes upset. The conflict between James and Sarah persists as she thinks James hates her for not speaking. James convinces Sarah to leave her job and move in with him, although it is not clear what her plans for the future are. James's determination to hear Sarah speak and his inability to help her to develop individual pursuits frustrates her, and she feels he is patronizing her. They split up shortly after.\n\nSarah leaves James and goes to live with her estranged mother, reconciling with her in the process. James chases her, but she refuses to see him. After inquiring about her, James learns Sarah is working as a manicurist. Eventually, she and James reconcile at the [[school prom]]. They decide to learn how to stay connected in-between the world of silence and the world of sound.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[William Hurt]] as James Leeds\n* [[Marlee Matlin]] as Sarah Norman\n* [[Piper Laurie]] as Mrs. Norman\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Dr. Curtis Franklin\n* Allison Gompf as Lydia\n* Bob Hiltermann as Orin\n* [[Linda Bove]] as Marian Loesser\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\nAfter meeting deaf actress [[Phyllis Frelich]] in 1977 at the [[University of Rhode Island]]'s New Repertory Project, playwright Medoff wrote the play ''Children of a Lesser God'' to be her [[star vehicle]].<ref name=\"play\" /> Based partially on Frelich's relationship with her hearing husband Robert Steinberg,<ref name=\"deafpersons\" /> the play chronicles the tumultuous relationship and marriage between a reluctant-to-speak deaf woman and an unconventional speech pathologist for the deaf. With Frelich starring, ''Children of a Lesser God'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1980, received three [[Tony Award]]s, including [[Tony Award for Best Play|Best Play]], and ran for 887 performances before closing in 1982.<ref name=\"ibdb\" />\n\nFollowing the vast success of his Broadway debut, Medoff, with fellow writer Anderson, penned a screenplay adapted from the original script. Though many changes were made, the core love story remained intact.<ref name=\"ebert_review\" /> The title of the film comes from the eleventh chapter (\"The Passing of Arthur\") of [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.<ref name=\"Sherrod-tcm\" /><ref name=\"Tennyson\" />\n\n===Filming===\nThe movie was shot primarily in and around [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], during the autumn of 1985, with the [[Rothesay Netherwood School]] serving as the main set. Aside from locations in Saint John and Rothesay Netherwood School, sets were constructed by Saint John local Keith MacDonald.\n\n==Release==\nThe adaptation premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 1986, and was [[Wide release|released widely]] in the United States on October 3 of the same year. Like its source material, the film generally gained praise from the hearing and deaf communities alike.<ref name=\"ebert_review\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at number 5 at the box office in the United States and Canada with an opening weekend gross of $1,909,084.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Children of a Lesser God'' holds an approval rating of 80% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10.

[[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said of Matlin, \"she has an unusual talent for concentrating her emotions--and an audience's--in her signing.

The film is not subtitled (neither the spoken dialogue nor the signing); instead, as Ebert observed, the signed dialogue is repeated aloud by Hurt's character, \"as if to himself\".<ref name=\"ebert_review\" />\n\n===Awards and nominations===\nThe film received five [[Academy Award]] nominations, with Marlee Matlin winning for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].<ref name=\"oscar\" /> Marlee Matlin was 21 years-old when she won, making her the [[List of superlative Academy Award winners and nominees|youngest Best Actress winner]] to date and the first deaf Academy Award winner.<ref name=\"oscarstats\" /> ''Children of a Lesser God'' was the first ever female-helmed film to be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-21/entertainment/ca-256_1_patients-as-people-first-randa-haines-lesser-god|title=What Took So Long?|last=Michaelson|first=Judith|date=21 July 1991|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=27 March 2017|archive-date=28 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328105304/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-21/entertainment/ca-256_1_patients-as-people-first-randa-haines-lesser-god|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
