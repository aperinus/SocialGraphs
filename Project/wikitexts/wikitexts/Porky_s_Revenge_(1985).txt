It was directed by [[James Komack]].<ref name=\"miami\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the semi-final basketball game, the cheerleaders promise the team an orgy if they win. The boys do so. After the game, they are led to one of the girls' homes, and everyone strips down to their underwear and jumps in a swimming pool. In it, the girls throw their underwear out. The boys do likewise, and swim toward the girls. Soon, but too late, they realize the girls are clothed after all and wind up parading nude before the clothed girls and their parents.\n\nPorky now owns a riverboat with a casino and strip club. According to Brian, he is extorting money from Coach Goodenough because he has a gambling debt. The gang decide to go to the boat to take pictures of the illegal casino to give to the [[District attorney|D.A.]] During this time, Meat runs into Porky's sex-crazed daughter, Blossom, who forces herself on him. The boys' plan fails because Porky catches them in the act and is about to kill them. But when they mention the State Championship game, he realizes that they could help him out by throwing the game so he can bet against them.\n\nLater at school, Meat is unable to dissect a frog in science class. Fearing he could become academically ineligible to play in the championship game, the gang goes to Miss Webster's apartment to get a copy of the final exam. They discover her and Mr. Dobish, the school's guidance counselor, having rather kinky extramarital relations.\n\nA letter is written to Ms. Balbricker arranging a rendezvous at a motel with an old boyfriend of hers, while Pee Wee is enticed to the same room by the promise of a night of passion with a beautiful Swedish exchange student. Tommy tricks Pee Wee into going to another location while he heads to the room. Ms. Balbricker arrives first followed by Tommy, and they are horrified to find themselves unclothed and in bed with each other. To make up for their prank on Ms. Balbricker, the gang contacts her old boyfriend and actually gets them together.\n\nBefore the final game, Meat is benched because Miss Webster intentionally failed him. Mr. Dobish discovers the blackmail photos and a note and shows Miss Webster, causing her to change her mind. The second half resulted in a victory for Angel Beach while Porky is outraged. Blossom tells him that Meat is her boyfriend and they \"went all the way,\" infuriating him even more. He then suggests to his two subordinates that Meat and Blossom be married.\n\nDuring the senior prom, Meat is abducted by Porky and his men. The gang goes after them. Just as the wedding is about to start, the power goes out and Meat is liberated by Billy and Brian. They begin their escape in a motorboat, with Porky's boat chasing them closely. The chase ends after they make it through a drawbridge, with Pee Wee then lowering it, resulting in the destruction of Porky's boat.\n\nAt graduation, the guys trick Pee Wee into taking off all his clothes, except the graduation gown. As he's about to get his diploma, Principal Carter steps on the gown, causing it to come off and reveal Pee Wee in his nudity, just as he dreamed at the beginning of the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Dan Monahan]] as Edward \"Pee Wee\" Morris\n* [[Mark Herrier]] as Billy McCarty\n* [[Wyatt Knight]] as Tommy Turner\n* [[Kaki Hunter]] as Wendy Williams\n* [[Tony Ganios]] as Anthony \"Meat\" Tuperello\n* [[Scott Colomby]] as Brian Schwartz\n* [[Nancy Parsons]] as Ms. Beulah Balbricker\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Mr. Carter\n* [[Chuck Mitchell]] as \"Porky\" Wallace\n* [[Kimberly Evenson]] as Inga\n* Nancy Hassinger as Pee Wee's Grandmother\n* Rose McVeigh as Miss Webster\n* Wendy Feign as Blossom\n* Fred Buch as Mr. Dobish\n* Ilse Earl as Mrs. Morris\n* [[Bill Hindman]] as Coach Goodenough\n* Ron Campbell as Crutcher\n* Mal Jones as Bridge Guard\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's budget was nearly $8 million, much of which was spent on building a large gambling boat. The producers used a $20 million Miami Island mansion, Vizcaya, as a key setting.<ref name=\"pork\"/>\n\nThe film was the directorial debut of James Komack, who stated \"I'm not going to whitewash the bawdiness or clean up the tone of their antics.\"<ref name=\"pork\"/>\n\nKomack thought the sequel, \"failed to understand their own formula. ''Porky's'' touched on reality, it presented a cross-section of adolescent sex life during a certain time frame. Bob apparently tried to elevate his big success and use it to portray a message. But the original was not a film about humanity; it was a film, pure and simple, about teen-age sex. The sequel, a whitewash of the original, didn't play.\"<ref name=\"pork\"/>\n\nNancy Parsons had lost a considerable amount of weight since the first film.

[[Record producer|Produced]] and assembled by [[Dave Edmunds]], it features new material from a wide spectrum of well-established [[rock and roll]] musicians, including [[Jeff Beck]], [[George Harrison]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Robert Plant]] & [[Phil Collins]] (under \"The Crawling King Snakes\" moniker), as well as then up-and-comers [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]].\n\nBesides George Harrison's recording of a previously unreleased [[Bob Dylan]] song (\"[[I Don't Want to Do It]]\") and Dave Edmunds' \"High School Nights\" and ''Porky's Revenge!'' theme music, it consists of newly recorded versions of classic rock and roll tunes (sometimes by their original author, in the case of Carl Perkins). [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] called it \"far more fun than the accompanying film\" and said, although disliking some of the 1980s production flourishes, \"it's far better to dwell on the fact that a third-rate sequel like ''Porky's Revenge!'' could produce a soundtrack this good, because that is a mystery for the ages.\"<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r84516|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic review]</ref>\n\n\"High School Nights\" b/w \"Porky's Revenge\" and \"Do You Want to Dance?\" b/w \"I Don't Want to Do It\" were released as singles.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline        =\n| extra_column    = Performer\n| title1 = High School Nights\n| extra1 = [[Dave Edmunds]]\n| writer1 = [[Dave Edmunds|Edmunds]], [[John David (musician)|David]], [[Steve Gould (musician)|Gould]]\n| length1 = 3:11\n| title2 = [[Do You Wanna Dance?|Do You Want to Dance?]]\n| extra2 = Dave Edmunds\n| writer2 = [[Bobby Freeman]]\n| length2 = 2:32\n| title3 = [[Sleep Walk|Sleepwalk]]\n| extra3 = [[Jeff Beck]]\n| writer3 = [[Santo & Johnny]]\n| length3 = 2:19\n| title4 = [[I Don't Want to Do It]]\n| extra4 = [[George Harrison]]\n| writer4 = [[Bob Dylan]]\n| length4 = 2:54\n| title5 = [[Stagger Lee (song)|Stagger Lee]]\n| extra5 = [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]]\n| writer5 =\n| length5 = 2:56\n| title6 = [[Blue Suede Shoes]]\n| extra6 = [[Carl Perkins]]\n| writer6 = Carl Perkins\n| length6 = 2:23\n| title7 = [[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn Theme]]\n| extra7 = [[Clarence Clemons]]\n| writer7 = [[Henry Mancini]]\n| length7 = 2:36\n| title8 = [[Queen of the Hop]]\n| extra8 = Dave Edmunds\n| writer8 = [[Bobby Darin]]\n| length8 = 2:15\n| title9 = [[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\n| extra9 = [[Willie Nelson]]\n| writer9 = [[Elvis Presley]], [[Ken Darby|Vera Matson]]\n| length9 = 2:32\n| title10 = Philadelphia Baby\n| extra10 = The Crawling King Snakes <!-- note10 = [[Robert Plant]] with [[Phil Collins]] on drums -->\n| writer10 = [[Charlie Rich]]\n| length10 = 2:18\n| title11 = Porky's Revenge!\n| extra11 = Dave Edmunds\n| writer11 = Dave Edmunds\n| length11 = 4:46\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = Original Master Recording Bonus Track\n| extra_column    = Performer\n| title12 = High School Nights\n| note12 = Reprise\n| extra12 = [[Dave Edmunds]]\n| writer12 = Dave Edmunds\n| length12 = 2:27\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = 2004 Reissue Bonus Tracks<!-- It looks like there is at least one other version with a single bonus track: \"Honey Don't\".
