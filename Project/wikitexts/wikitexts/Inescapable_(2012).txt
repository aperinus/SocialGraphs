The film stars [[Alexander Siddig]], [[Marisa Tomei]], and [[Joshua Jackson]]. Siddig plays Adib, a former Syrian [[intelligence officer]] who becomes embroiled in a cat and mouse chase while trying to locate his photographer daughter, Muna, in [[Damascus]]. After an assignment in [[Greece]], Muna takes a detour trip to [[Syria]], where she becomes wrongly accused of [[espionage]] and held hostage by corrupt government agents. ''Inescapable'' follows Adib's struggle to return to Syria after spending over 20 years in [[Canada]] trying to build a new life for himself.\n\n''Inescapable'' marks Nadda's sixth full-length film in her wide-ranging collection of feature and short films, all of which contain references to Islamic themes and Nadda's own Syrian and Palestinian roots.<ref name=\"arrazola\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nAdib Abdel-Kareem was an officer in the Syrian military force before being labeled a traitor and having to flee to Canada. With his wife, two daughters, and a steady job in [[Toronto]], Adib is confident he has put his past behind him. That is until he learns that his eldest daughter Muna has gone missing in Damascus, after taking a secret detour to Syria while on an assignment in Greece. 20 years after he escaped Syria, Adib is forced to return to rescue his daughter from corrupt government agents who wrongly hold her captive on the grounds of espionage. There, he teams up with his former fianc\u00e9, Fatima, and Canadian diplomat, Paul, to locate his daughter while evading former colleagues and the secret police. Both a mystery drama and a political thriller, ''Inescapable'' is an action-packed film driven by a father\u2019s selfless dedication to his daughter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/inescapable-toronto-review-369411|title=Inescapable: Toronto Review|last=Mintzer|first=Joshua|date=September 11, 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alexander Siddig]] as Adib Abdel-Kareem\n* [[Joshua Jackson]] as Paul\n* [[Marisa Tomei]] as Fatima\n* [[Oded Fehr]] as Sayid Abd Al-Aziz\n* Saad Siddiqui as Halim\n* Fadia Nadda as Lingerie Sales Girl\n* Bonnie Lee Bouman as Emily\n* [[Danny Keogh]] as Detlev\n* [[Hrant Alianak]] as Ali Homs\n* Jay Anstey as Muna\n* Amy Anstey as Leila\n* [[Carl Beukes]] as Peter \n* Rafiq Jajbhay as Sheikh Abu Mouhammad\n* Josette Eales as Paul's Wife\n* Ializa Knafo as Ali Homs's Daughter\n* Candice Smith as Nadia\n\n==Production==\n''Inescapable'' was produced by [[Daniel Iron]] and Lance Samuels, and executively produced by Killer Films' [[Christine Vachon]], Myriad's Kirk D'Amico, and Alliance Films' Mark Slone.<ref name=\"sneider\" />\n\n===Casting===\nMarisa Tomei plays Fatima, Adib\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, who still \"smolders with love and bitterness, but also knows that helping him is the right thing to do\".<ref name=\"schneller\">Schneller, Johanna.

Tomei admits that she became very emotionally involved with Fatima\u2019s role and even took some of her pain home, stating: \"This film packs a punch, and I am still reeling.\"<ref name=\"schneller\" /> Ruba Nadda sold Fatima to Tomei as \"feisty\"<ref name=\"schneller\" /> and \"outspoken\".<ref name=\"schneller\" /> However, Tomei reveals that \"for many reasons she cut those pieces out\",<ref name=\"schneller\" /> including passionate kisses, Adib telling Fatima he never stopped loving her, Fatima rending her clothing in despair, high-pitched curses in Arabic, and so on. She further adds: \"And the way I relate to those scenes being cut \u2013 in a small way, that's what happens to the women there. The big stuff gets crushed, suppressed. You can still smell it in the film, but you're not allowed to express it. The women there were given an education, then had it taken away; given a voice, then had it taken away. So now I've experienced that to a tiny degree. I feel for our sisters there.\"<ref name=\"schneller\" />\n\nAlexander Siddig plays Adib, a former Syrian militant who believes he has escaped his past until he is compelled to return to Syria to rescue his daughter, Muna. Siddig reveals that he agreed to do ''Inescapable'' because he knew it would be compared to popular films such as [[Frantic (film)|''Frantic'']], [[Taken (film)|''Taken'']], and ''[[Syriana]]'', stating: \"Men are often horribly misrepresented on film. We're not as capable as movie characters, and that emasculates us. Those butch men are as untrue as skinny models are to most women.\"<ref name=\"schneller\" /> Siddig further explains that: \"I needed to not betray the man, the father . . . because when kids dream of what their fathers should be like, it should be someone in the ballpark of a real human being. It's not a moral trip. I just can't compete with [[Liam Neeson]] or [[Harrison Ford]].\"<ref name=\"schneller\" />\n\nNadda praises Siddig's ability to convey intense emotions, stating: \"He's just honestly one of the most solid actors I've ever seen in my life, and so I thought if I'm going to blow my career, go down in flames, risk it all, I'm going to risk it all on Alexander\".<ref name=\"arrazola\">.

Paul has an ambiguous nature throughout most of the film as he helps Adib locate Muna, but then plays a more active and instrumental role during the final scenes. When Adib learns about Paul\u2019s relationship with Muna, Paul\u2019s motives finally become more clear. According to Jackson, this is what attracted him to Paul\u2019s character, stating that: \"I see a lot of scripts, and even the well-written characters usually go only from here to there . . . Paul gets an entire other direction. He\u2019s boyish in the beginning, then he tries to cover his ass and tries to get away with whatever he can, and then, when the situation spirals out of his control, instead of making a weak or childish choice, he makes a more interesting and difficult one.
