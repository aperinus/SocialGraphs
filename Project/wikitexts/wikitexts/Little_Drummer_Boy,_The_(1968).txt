It was first televised in [[Canada]] on December 15, 1968 on the [[CTV Television Network]], followed four days later by its American nationwide release on [[NBC]]. A sequel was broadcast in 1976.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crump |first1=William D. |title=Happy Holidays\u2014Animated!

On his birthday, Aaron's parents give him a drum as a gift, to which the animals dance when he plays it. One night, bandits from the desert steal their livestock, kill Aaron's parents, and burn the farm down. Emotionally scarred from the tragedy, Aaron begins to [[Misanthropy |hate all humanity]]. Because his drumming can make the three animals dance, Aaron is kidnapped and forced to join Ben Haramed's [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] with rather inept performers against his will. When performing in [[Jerusalem]], Aaron becomes infuriated by the townspeople's amusement and lashes out at them for being thieves and knaves.\n\nSome time later, the troupe comes upon the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] caravan who are following [[Star of Bethlehem|a bright star in the sky]]. Seizing his chance, Ben greedily attempts to perform for the Magi, but they are uninterested as they try to make haste to get to the star's destination. One of the caravan camels becomes too weak to continue traveling and the Magi has no extra camel, so Ben seizes Aaron and bargains with them that they use Joshua in exchange for some of their gold, but Aaron refuses to take any gold from Ben and leaves for [[Bethlehem]] with Samson and Baba. Later Aaron and his two remaining animal companions Samson and Baba escape, climb the tallest hill and join up with the Magi as they follow the star and then journey toward Bethlehem. There, upon recognizing Joshua and trying to reunite with him, Baba is struck by a Roman chariot. Aaron takes the injured lamb to the Magi to be healed. However, they can do nothing, but insist that maybe [[Jesus Christ|the baby]] can help. Having no gift to give to the baby, Aaron decides that his \"gift\" to Him and [[Mary, mother of Jesus|His]] [[Saint Joseph|parents]] will be his playing his drum for them. As a sign of gratitude, Baba is healed and rushes into Aaron's arms, filling Aaron's heart with joy at last.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063230/|title=The Little Drummer Boy|date=19 December 1968|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Greer Garson]] as the narrator\n* [[Teddy Eccles]] as Aaron\n* [[Jose Ferrer]] as Ben Haramad\n* [[Paul Frees]] as Ali, Aaron's father, Three Kings\n* [[June Foray]] as Aaron's mother\n* [[Vienna Boys' Choir|The Vienna Boys' Choir]] singing the title song.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Little Drummer Boy'' received an approval rating of 75% on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on thirteen reviews.
