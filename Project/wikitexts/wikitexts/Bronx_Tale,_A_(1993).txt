It tells the [[coming of age story]] of an [[Italian-American]] boy, Calogero, who, after encountering a local [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss, is torn between the temptations of organized crime and the values of his honest, hardworking father, as well as racial tensions in his community. The Broadway production was converted to film with limited changes, and starred Palminteri and De Niro.\n\nDe Niro, who first viewed the play in Los Angeles in 1990, acquired the rights from Palminteri, intent on making the play his directorial debut. The duo then worked heavily together on the screenplay, with Palminteri aiming to retain many of the aspects of the original script, as it was based largely on his own childhood. Production began in 1991, and was funded in collaboration with De Niro's [[TriBeCa Productions]] and [[Savoy Pictures]], as the first film released by each studio.\n\n''A Bronx Tale'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 14, 1993, and released in the United States on September 29, 1993. The film achieved limited commercial success, grossing over $17 million domestically. However, it fared much better with critics, who praised the performances of the leads, and launched Palminteri's acting career, while also helping De Niro gain acceptance as a director.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1960, Lorenzo works as an [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] bus driver in [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]], a working-class Italian-American neighborhood in [[The Bronx]], with his wife Rosina and their nine-year-old son Calogero. Calogero becomes enamored with the criminal life and [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] presence in his neighborhood, led by Sonny. One day, Calogero witnesses Sonny shooting and killing a man assaulting his friend. When Calogero chooses to keep quiet when questioned by NYPD detectives, Sonny takes a liking to him and gives him the nickname \"C.\" Sonny's men offer Lorenzo a better paying job but, preferring a law-abiding life as a bus driver, he politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and introduces him to his crew. Calogero earns tips working in Sonny's bar and [[craps|throwing dice]], and is admonished by Lorenzo when he discovers the cash. Lorenzo returns the money to Sonny, and warns him to keep away from Calogero.\n\nEight years later, a 17-year old Calogero has been visiting Sonny regularly without his father's knowledge. Calogero is also part of a gang of local Italian-American boys, which concerns Sonny. Later, Calogero meets a black girl, Jane, and they develop a tentative friendship. Despite the high level of racial tension and dislike between Italian-Americans and African-Americans in the neighborhood, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from both his father and Sonny, with the latter lending Calogero his car. Later, Calogero's friends beat up black cyclists who ride through their neighborhood, despite Calogero's attempts to defend them. One of the cyclists turns out to be Jane's brother, and he mistakes Calogero for one of the assailants and accuses him of beating him up when he and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation, and calls him a [[nigger]],<!-- Leave the slur name as is per WP:UNCENSORED --> which he instantly regrets. Jane leaves with her brother.\n\nAt home, Calogero is confronted by his father who had just seen him driving Sonny's car. An argument ensues and Calogero storms out. Shortly thereafter, Calogero is confronted by Sonny and his crew, who found a bomb on Sonny's car. Sonny confronts Calogero, and after he tearfully pleads his unwavering dedication to Sonny, he recognizes Calogero's innocence and allows him to leave. The black boys egg the Italian-American boys' usual spot in retaliation for the previous beating, and Calogero's friends make a plan to strike back using [[Molotov cocktail]]s. They force Calogero to participate, but while on their way, Sonny stops their car and orders Calogero out. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that her brother had later admitted that the boy who beat him up was not Calogero. Jane and Calogero make amends, but he suddenly remembers his friends' plans to attack Jane's neighborhood, and the two rush to stop them. During the attack, a black shopkeeper had thrown an unbroken Molotov cocktail back at the Italian-American boys' car which entered through the window igniting the other Molotov cocktails, resulting in an explosion that killed everyone inside. When Calogero and Jane arrive, they find the car engulfed in flames and the boys' dead bodies burned.\n\nCalogero leaves and rushes into Sonny's bar to thank him for saving his life, but among the crowd, an assailant shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the assailant was the son of the man he witnessed Sonny kill eight years earlier. At Sonny's funeral, countless people come to pay their respects. When the crowd disperses, a lone man, Carmine, visits the funeral, claiming that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the man being assaulted whom Sonny had defended when he committed the murder. Carmine tells Calogero that he is filling in for Sonny in the neighborhood for the time being, and promises Calogero help should he ever need. Carmine leaves just as Lorenzo unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny. Lorenzo thanks him for saving his son's life and admits that he had never hated him, but that he had resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero and his father walk home together as Calogero narrates the lessons he learned from his two mentors.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Lorenzo\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as \"Sonny\"\n* [[Lillo Brancato, Jr.]] as Calogero (age 17)\n** [[Francis Capra]] as Calogero (age 9)\n* [[Taral Hicks]] as Jane\n* [[Kathrine Narducci]] as Rosina\n* Clem Caserta as Jimmy \"Whispers\"\n* Frank Pietrangolare as Danny \"K.O.\"\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Carmine\n* Alfred Sauchelli Jr. as Bobby \"Bars\"\n* Robert D'Andrea as Tony \"Toupee\"\n* Eddie Montanaro as Eddie \"Mush\"\n* Fred Fischer as Joe \"Jo Jo The Whale\"\n* Dave Salerno as Frankie \"Coffeecake\"\n* Joe D'Onofrio as \"Slick\" (Age 17)\n* Louis Vanaria as Mario \"Crazy Mario\"\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Nicky \"Zero\"\n\n==Production==\nThe film is based on Chazz Palminteri's play [[A Bronx Tale (play)|original play]] of the same name, which was performed as a [[one-person show|one-man show]], being largely based on his own childhood, specifically the shooting Calogero witnesses as a child, as well as the occupation and name of his father.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2019/03/30/chazz-palminteri-and-real-life-inspiration-for-bronx-tale-are-forever-intertwined/dTk8xCYQtVJjVIC48gQVNO/story.html|title=Chazz Palminteri and the real-life inspiration for 'A Bronx Tale' are forever intertwined|publisher=bostonglobe.com|date=March 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, at a performance of ''A Bronx Tale'', [[Robert De Niro]] met with Palminteri in his dressing room after having seen the show.
