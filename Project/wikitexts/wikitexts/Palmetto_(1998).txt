After rejecting a bribe that would have ensured his silence, Harry finds the funds deposited into his bank account and he is promptly arrested.  Now, two years later, he is released when an ex-cop's testimony vindicates him.\n\nThough he is bitter against the town officials, Harry wanders back to Palmetto with his girlfriend Nina, who has been patiently waiting for him.  Unable to find a job, he spends his days lounging in a local bar. In walks Rhea Malroux, the very attractive femme, wife of the richest man in town, who offers him a job: help her and her daughter Odette scam the old man out of $500,000 with a bogus kidnapping scheme, in which Harry would receive a ten percent cut.\n\nTempted by both Rhea's seductive charms and the prospect of some quick cash, Harry goes along with the plan. First, he goes over to the Malroux mansion to check that his facts are in order, about who Rhea actually is. Then he agrees to meet with Rhea in private to iron out the details. And lastly, he asks to take a meeting with Odette, to make sure she is actually in on the plan. After all of these things seem to check out, Harry agrees.\n\nWhen Odette goes missing, (the plan is that she will stay out of town for a few days, until her father pays the money,) the story gets leaked to the police. The police then come to Harry, looking to offer him a job. His brother in law is a top detective, and knowing that Harry used to write for the paper, he believes Harry would be good at keeping the press informed, but also keeping them off the backs of the detectives who are working the case. So now Harry is part of the kidnapping, but he's also part of the police investigative team.\n\nWhen Harry shows up to his bungalow to find Odette dead one day, he realizes he's in a lot of trouble. He uses a tape recording he made, when ironing out the terms of the deal with Rhea Malroux to blackmail her. And so she sends her boyfriend to dispose of Odette's body. But then the real Odette turns up in Harry's bungalow, also dead, and things get even worse. This time, the police find out about it.\n\nThat leads to Harry working with the police to catch Rhea Malroux and her boyfriend. Harry goes to see Rhea's husband and tell him everything. He learns that the woman pretending to be Rhea is not this man's actual wife. Instead, she is the gardener. She and her boyfriend, Donnelly take Harry from the Malroux home to a garage, where they are also holding Nina. They plan to kill both of them by dipping them in a barrel of acid, but Harry is wearing a wire and the police arrive. Donnelly falls into the barrel of acid and the woman pretending to be Rhea Malroux is arrested.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Woody Harrelson]] as Harry Barber\n*[[Elisabeth Shue]] as Mrs. Donnelly/Rhea Malroux\n*[[Gina Gershon]] as Nina\n*[[Rolf Hoppe]] as Felix Malroux\n*[[Michael Rapaport]] as Donnelly\n*[[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]] as Odette\n*[[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as John Renick\n*[[Marc Macaulay]] as Miles Meadows\n*Joe Hickey as Lawyer\n*[[Ralph Wilcox (actor)|Ralph Wilcox]] as Judge\n*Peter Paul DeLeo as Bartender\n*Richard Booker as Billy Holden\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a 38% rating on review site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0120782|Palmetto}}\n*{{Amg movie|160263|Palmetto}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|palmetto|Palmetto}}\n* [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/20/entertainment/ca-20930 ''Palmetto'' film review] at the [[Los Angeles Times]]\n\n{{Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff}}\n\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:1990s mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:American crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:American mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:American neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:Films based on crime novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by James Hadley Chase]]\n[[Category:Films set in Florida]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Klaus Doldinger]]\n[[Category:Castle Rock Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Columbia Pictures films]]\n[[Category:German crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:German mystery thriller films]]\n[[Category:German neo-noir films]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n[[Category:1990s German films]]"}]}}}}
