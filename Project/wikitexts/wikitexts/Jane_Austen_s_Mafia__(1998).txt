It also parodies films in other genres, ranging from ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' to ''[[Il Postino]]'' and ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nLike the 1974 film ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', the narrative of ''Mafia!'' consists of a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s interwoven with the main plot. Tony is the son of a prominent Mafia don, Vincenzo Armani Windbreaker Cortino. As the film opens, Tony introduces the main thread when he exits a Vegas casino and walks to his car, accompanied by a voiceover explaining his philosophy of life. When he starts the car, [[Casino (film)|it explodes]].\n\nThe story then regresses more than half a century to describe the boyhood of Tony's father, Vincenzo, who was born in Italy, the clumsy son of a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] postman. One day, while making a delivery for his father, Vincenzo trips and the parcel bursts open, revealing a strange white powder. The parcel's recipient, concluding that the delivery boy has seen too much, tracks Vincenzo to a street fair, where he kills his father.  The boy escapes to America, where he grows to young manhood, marries, and struggles with poverty before finally finding his destiny as a mafia boss.\n\nThe film then visits the recent past; Tony has just returned from the [[Korean War]] and is bringing his idealistic Protestant girlfriend, Diane, to meet his family and friends at his big brother Joey's wedding reception (a parody of Connie Corleone's wedding in the beginning of the 1972 film ''[[The Godfather]]''). During the festivities, however, Vincenzo is shot 47 times in an attempted hit and nearly dies. Tony announces his intention to kill Gorgoni, a drug lord with whom Vincenzo had refused to do business before the attack. Diane leaves him, saying he's abandoned the peaceful ideals of his youth, and adding that she'll never be anything to his Sicilian family but \"that Protestant chick who never killed anyone.\" Tony avenges the attack, then goes into hiding in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where Cesar Marzoni offers him the opportunity to manage his casino, The Peppermill.  Tony accepts and his casino is a great success until he meets a [[femme fatale]], Pepper Gianini, hired by Marzoni as part of a deep-laid plan to distract him from his duties and to drive a wedge between him and Joey.\n\nVincenzo recovers from his 47 gunshot wounds and visits Las Vegas, where he officially names Tony his successor.  Joey, furious at being passed over, is told \"You get Wisconsin.\" The Don then returns home, where he falls victim to his 5-year-old grandson, Chucky, who assassinates him by spraying him with [[malathion]] (parody of Vito Corleone's heart attack in ''The Godfather''). The film returns to the present after Tony catches Joey and Pepper cavorting in a hotel room together and walks out in disgust - only to have his car explode.\n\nTony is horribly but temporarily disfigured, and attends his father's funeral in a wheelchair, where he spots the killers when he sees little Chucky taking a payoff. However, he decides to postpone vengeance until he can win back Diane's love and put his life in order. Diane has by this time become [[President of the United States]], and is on the brink of declaring total world disarmament when Tony goes looking for her. He persuades her to put world peace on the back burner until after their wedding. During the ceremony, with the help of Vincenzo's mother (Dukakis), several henchmen, and gangster Nick \"The Eskimo\" Molinaro, he settles the family's accounts in an orgy of slaughter (filmed similarly to the end of ''The Godfather''), even arranging [[anti-Barney humor|the harpooning of Barney the Dinosaur]] as a bonus.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jay Mohr]] as Anthony \"Tony\" Cortino\n* [[Lloyd Bridges]] as Vincenzo Armani Windbreaker Cortino\n** [[Louis Mandylor]] as young Vincenzo\n** [[Jason Fuchs]] as Vincenzo Cortino as a boy\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as Diane Steen\n* [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]] as Joey Cortino\n* [[Pamela Gidley]] as Pepper Gianini\n* [[Olympia Dukakis]] as Sophia Cortino\n** [[Sofia Milos]] as young Sophia\n* [[Joe Viterelli]] as Dominick Clamato\n* [[Tony Lo Bianco]] as Cesar Marzoni\n* Blake Hammond as Fatso Paulie Orsatti\n* [[Philip Suriano|Phil Suriano]] as Frankie Totino\n* [[Vincent Pastore]] as Gorgoni\n* [[Marisol Nichols]] as Carla\n* [[Carol Ann Susi]] as Mrs. Clamato\n* [[Gregory Sierra]] as Bonifacio\n* [[Catherine Lloyd Burns]] (''uncredited'') as Woman in Vegas Show\n* Steve Kruth as Lon Cortino\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\nIn its opening weekend the film took $6,577,961 in 1,942 theatres, averaging $3,387.

Now, countless movies later, many of the jokes seem recycled, even when they aren't. ... ''Mafia!'' ... has its funny moments, but, in the wake of the hilarious ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', it seems more than a little lame. ... The volume of jokes is extremely high, presumably as a form of insurance\u2014if one fails, maybe the next will succeed. The problem is, ''Mafia!'' contains too many duds. And, when you're not laughing, you start to realize how little this film has to offer beyond the diluted humor. ... ''Mafia!'' isn't a terrible film, and it will probably provoke at least a burst or two of laughter from even the most grim viewer. On the whole, however, it's a weak parody that is better suited to video viewing than a theatrical experience.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Berardinelli|author-link=James Berardinelli|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/m/mafia.html |title=Mafia!|website=Reelviews|access-date=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', who gave the film two out of four stars, wrote\n\n<blockquote>Yes, I laughed during Jim Abrahams' ''Mafia!,'' but even in mid-chortle I was reminded of the gut-busting experience last week of seeing ''There's Something About Mary.'' It is the new movie's misfortune to arrive after, instead of before, the funniest comedy of the year. ... ''Mafia!'' is the kind of movie that can never entirely fail, but can succeed to various degrees. It doesn't rank with Abraham's earlier efforts. And in a town where ''There's Something About Mary'' is playing, it's not the one to choose.<ref>{{cite news |first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980724/REVIEWS/807240302 |title=Mafia! |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=July 24, 1998|access-date=February 11, 2012 |via=rogerebert.com }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote\n\n<blockquote>There are a handful of laughs in ''Mafia!'', but most of the movie feels oddly repressed. ... The underworld gags are limited and repetitive, without the ripely promiscuous media-age lunacy that, in a comedy like ''The Naked Gun'', made you feel as if the film were tickling funny bones you never even knew existed. Jay Mohr, as the [[Michael Corleone]] surrogate, and Billy Burke, as his psycho-hothead brother, don't even look the part\u2014they're like preppies clowning in a Harvard spoof\u2014and so the film gets virtually no lift from its performers. ... Still, when Mohr's Anthony Cortino grabs his brother's head and gives him the kiss of death, leaving a bright red smear of lipstick ... well, we may all know this genre's tricks too well by now, but that doesn't mean they can't make you smile.<ref>{{cite news|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|author-link=Owen Gleiberman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,284230,00.html |title=Mafia!|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=July 31, 1998|access-date=February 11, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0120741|Jane Austen's Mafia!}}\n* {{allrovi movie|163036|Jane Austen's Mafia!}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|1083535-mafia|Jane Austen's Mafia!}}\n\n{{Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker}}\n{{Godfather}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mafia}}\n[[Category:1990s parody films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:American crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:American parody films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jim Abrahams]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Nevada]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Frizzell (composer)]]\n[[Category:Mafia comedy films]]\n[[Category:Parody films based on The Godfather]]\n[[Category:Touchstone Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Jim Abrahams]]\n[[Category:1998 comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Las Vegas Valley]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]"}]}}}}
