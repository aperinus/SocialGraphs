The screenplay, written by [[William Goldman]], is a fictionalized account of the [[Tsavo man-eaters]], a pair of male lions that terrorized workers in and around [[Tsavo]], [[Kenya]] during the building of the [[Uganda Railway|Uganda-Mombasa Railway]] in [[East Africa]] in 1898.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews and was considered a box office disappointment, having grossed only $75 million against a production budget of $55 million.<ref name=\"figures\"/> It won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] for supervising sound editor [[Bruce Stambler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1997|title=The 69th Academy Awards \u2013 1997|access-date=7 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1898, Robert Beaumont, the primary financier of a railway project in [[Tsavo]], [[Kenya]], seeks out the expertise of Lt. Colonel [[John Henry Patterson (author)|John Henry Patterson]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] British military engineer, to get the project on schedule. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, promising his wife, Helena, that he will complete the bridge and be back in London for the birth of their child. Shortly after his arrival, he meets British supervisor Angus Starling, Kenyan foreman Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne informs Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the undertaking.\n\nThat same night, Patterson ends the life of an approaching lion with a single gunshot, earning the respect of the laborers and allowing them to resume their activities safely. Only a few weeks after, however, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent. At sunrise, his mutilated body is recovered, and Patterson tries another night-time hunt, seeking to catch the lion that ate Mahina, but in the morning, he is informed by Starling that the corpse of a second worker has been found at the opposing end of the camp from his position.\n\nPatterson, heeding the advice of Samuel, employs the workers in building thorn fences around the tents in order to prevent any lions from entering. Several days later, in broad daylight, a lion assails the camp, killing another worker. As Patterson, Starling, and Samuel corner the lion while it is feasting on the body, another lion leaps upon them from the roof of a building, slicing Starling across the throat and injuring Patterson on the left arm. Patterson recovers and attempts to shoot them, but both lions escape. Samuel states that there has never been a pair of [[man-eater]]s before; they have always been solitary hunters.\n\nThe workers, led by a man named Abdullah, begin to turn on Patterson and, consequently, progress on the bridge comes to a halt. Patterson requests soldiers from England as protection, but he is denied. During a brief visit to the site, Beaumont threatens Patterson that, should his commission not be concluded on time, he will tarnish his reputation. He also announces that he will be contacting the famed hunter Charles Remington to help Patterson in eliminating the threat due to his past failures.\n\nA short time later, Remington reaches Tsavo with the company of skilled [[Maasai people|Maasai]] warriors, who dub the lions \"the Ghost\" and \"the Darkness\" because of their notorious methods. Remington\u2019s initial attempt to trap one lion in a thicket fails when Patterson's borrowed gun misfires. The warriors decide to leave, daunted by the beast, but Remington elects to stay behind. He constructs a new hospital tent for sick and injured workers and tempts the lions to the abandoned building with animal parts and blood. The man-eaters seemingly fall for the trap, but Remington and Patterson shoot at them, and they retreat to the new hospital, slaughtering many patients and Hawthorne.\n\nAbdullah and the workers depart, leaving Patterson, Remington, and Samuel alone. The former two locate the animals' lair and discover the bones of dozens of victims, leading Remington to the realization that the lions are acting as they have been merely for sport. Back at camp that evening, Patterson mounts a hunting stand in a clearing and lures one of the predators to his position using a baboon as bait. The plan goes awry after Patterson falls from the stand, but Remington manages to slay the feline before it can leap on Patterson. He, Patterson, and Samuel spend the remainder of the night drinking and celebrating, but the next morning, Patterson awakes to find that the remaining lion has devoured Remington as he and Samuel slept.\n\nThe two men cremate Remington\u2019s remains and burn the tall grass surrounding the camp, driving the surviving lion toward the trap that they have set there. It ambushes them on the partially constructed bridge and, after a lengthy chase, Patterson finally dispatches it with a double-rifle Samuel has thrown to him from a nearby tree. Abdullah and the workers return, and the bridge is completed on time. Patterson reunites with his wife and meets his son for the first time.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as Charles Remington\n* [[Val Kilmer]] as [[John Henry Patterson (author)|Colonel John Henry Patterson]]\n* [[John Kani]] as Samuel\n* [[Brian McCardie]] as Angus Starling\n* [[Bernard Hill]] as David Hawthorne\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Sir Robert Beaumont\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as Helena Patterson\n* [[Om Puri]] as Abdullah\n* [[Henry Cele]] as Mahina\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production ==\nThe film is based upon ''[[The Man-Eaters of Tsavo]]'' by [[John Henry Patterson (author)|Lieutenant Colonel John Henry Patterson]], the man who actually killed both real lions.\n\n===Screenplay===\n[[William Goldman]] first heard about the story when travelling in Africa in 1984, and thought it would make a good script. In 1989 he pitched the story to Paramount as a cross between ''Lawrence of Arabia'' and ''Jaws'', and they commissioned him to write a screenplay which he delivered in 1990.{{sfnp|Goldman|2000|pp=72\u201374}}\n\n\"My particular feeling is that they were evil,\" said Goldman of the lions. \"I believe that for nine months, evil popped out of the ground at Tsavo.\"<ref name=\"la\"/>\n\nThe script fictionalizes Patterson's account, introducing an American big game hunter called Charles Remington. The character was based on Anglo-Indian big game hunter Charles H. Ryall, superintendent of the Railway Police.<ref>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |title=The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaJs5YlW-RIC&q=Charles+Henry+Ryall |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw Hill Professional |isbn=978-0-07-136333-4 |page=33 }}</ref> In original drafts the character was called Redbeard, and Goldman says his purpose in the story was to create an imposing character who could be killed by the lions and make Patterson seem more brave; Goldman says his ideal casting for the role would have been [[Burt Lancaster]].{{sfnp|Goldman|2000|p=89}}\n\nAccording to Goldman, [[Kevin Costner]] expressed interest in playing Patterson, but Paramount wanted to use [[Tom Cruise]] who ultimately declined. Work on the film slowed until Michael Douglas moved his producing unit with partner Steven Reuther, Constellation Films, to Paramount. Douglas read the script and loved it, calling it \"an incredible thriller about events that actually took place.\"<ref name=\"la\"/> Douglas decided to produce and Stephen Hopkins was hired to direct.\n\n[[Val Kilmer]], who had just made ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and was a frequent visitor to Africa then expressed enthusiasm for the script, which enabled the project to be financed.\n\nThe part of Remington was originally offered to [[Sean Connery]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]] but both declined; the producers were considering asking [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] when Douglas decided to play the role himself. Stephen Hopkins later said he was unhappy about this.<ref name=\"hopkins\">{{cite news|title=Arts: Some of Stephen Hopkins's films are so bad he can't bear to watch them...

In Goldman's book ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'', the screenwriter argues that Douglas' decision ruined the mystery of the character, making him a \"wimp\" and a \"loser\".{{sfnp|Goldman|2000|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n===Locations===\nThe film was shot mainly on location at [[Songimvelo Game Reserve]] in South Africa, rather than Kenya, due to tax laws. Many [[Maasai people|Maasai]] characters in the film were actually portrayed by [[South Africa]]n actors, although the Maasai depicted during the hunt were portrayed by real Maasai warriors who were hired for the movie.\n\n===Filming===\nWhile the real man-eaters were, like all lions from the Tsavo region, a more aggressive, maneless variety, those used for filming were actually the least aggressive available, for both safety and aesthetic reasons. The film's lions were two male lions with [[Mane (lion)|manes]]. They were brothers named ''Caesar'' and ''Bongo'', who were residents of the [[Bowmanville Zoo]] in [[Bowmanville]], [[Ontario]], Canada, both of whom were also featured in ''[[George of the Jungle (film)|George of the Jungle]]''. The film also featured three other lions: two from France and one from the USA.\n\nDirector Stephen Hopkins later said of the shoot:\n<blockquote>We had snake bites, scorpion bites, tick bite fever, people getting hit by lightning, floods, torrential rains and lightning storms, hippos chasing people through the water, cars getting swept into the water, and several deaths of crew members, including two drownings.... Val came to the set under the worst conditions imaginable. He was completely exhausted from doing ''The Island of Dr. Moreau''; he was dealing with the unfavorable publicity from that set; he was going through a divorce; he barely had time to get his teeth into this role before we started; and he is in nearly every scene in this movie. But I worked him six or seven days a week for four months under really adverse conditions, and he really came through. He had a passion for this film.<ref name=\"la\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+LION+SLEEPS+TONIGHT+%3a+TROUBLES+ON+THIS+FILM+WEREN%27T+CAUSED+BY+THE...-a083970293 |title=The Lion Sleeps Tonight: Troubles on this film weren't caused by the cats or reputed bad boy Kilmer |first=Amy |last=Dawes |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News|Daily News]] |location=Los Angeles |date=10 October 1996|page= L.3 |via=The Free Library}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nDuring its opening weekend, ''The Ghost and the Darkness'' grossed $10.3 million.<ref name=\"figures\"/> The film ultimately grossed over $38.6 million domestically,<ref name=\"figures\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0116409/ |title=The Ghost and the Darkness (1996) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=July 23, 2021}}</ref> and $75 million worldwide.<ref name=\"figures 2\"/>\n\n===Critical response===\nThe film won the [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]] ([[Bruce Stambler]]) at the [[69th Academy Awards]].

Reviews were mixed, with [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a 51% rating based on 51 reviews.

Later on, the film is available as a one-disc [[DVD]]. There are no special features besides a theatrical trailer. The film was released on [[LaserDisc]] in 1997 as a one-disc, double-sided release featuring a [[Dolby Digital]] audio track.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n[[File:Lionsoftsavo2008.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The [[Tsavo Man-Eaters]] on display in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago]]\nAlthough Patterson claimed the lions were responsible for up to 135 deaths, a peer-reviewed paper on man-eating lions and the circumstances surrounding this notorious event states that about 28\u201331 killings can be verified (Kerbis Peterhans & Gnoske, 2001). However, one underlying assumption of the study was that the lions would eat all of the edible meat on a victim. In other words, the study's conclusion was that the lions ate the equivalent of 28-31 whole people. This obviously does not take into account that some victims may have been killed and either partially eaten or not eaten at all.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/man-eating-lions-not-as-many-dead.html |title=Man eating lions \u2013 not (as) many dead |journal=[[Railway Gazette International]] |date=November 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\nPatterson's 1907 book itself states that \"between them (the lions) no less than 28 Indian coolies, in addition to scores of unfortunate African natives of whom no official record was kept\" were killed. This lesser number was confirmed in the definitive paper on man-eating behavior and the Tsavo lions by Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske (2001)<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Science of 'Man-Eating' Among Lions (Panthera leo).
