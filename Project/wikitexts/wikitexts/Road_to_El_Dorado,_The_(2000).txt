It was the third animated feature produced by DreamWorks. The film was directed by [[Eric \"Bibo\" Bergeron]] and Don Paul (in their feature directorial debuts), with additional sequences directed by [[Will Finn]] and [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]]. The film stars the voices of [[Kenneth Branagh]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Rosie Perez]], [[Armand Assante]], and [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\nThe soundtrack features an instrumental score composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]], and songs written by [[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]]. John is also credited periodically narrating the story in [[Ballad|song]] throughout the film. The film follows two con artists who, after winning the map to [[El Dorado]] in [[Spain]], wash ashore in the [[Mesoamerica|New World]], where they use the map to lead them to the city of El Dorado, where its inhabitants mistake them for gods.\n\n''The Road to El Dorado'' was released on March 31, 2000 to mixed reviews from critics and was a disappointment at the box office, grossing $76 million worldwide on a production budget of about $95 million. Despite its initial reception, re-evaluation in later years has resulted in ''The Road to El Dorado'' gaining a [[cult following]].<ref name=\"Comic-Con\">{{cite web |last=Gramulgia |first=Anthony |url=https://www.cbr.com/the-road-to-el-dorado-cult-classic/ |title=The Road to El Dorado: How the Box-Office Bomb Became a Cult Classic |website=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] |date=March 14, 2020 |access-date=March 29, 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"Polygon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/1/21202735/the-road-to-el-dorado-characters-memes-dreamworks-movies |title=The Road to El Dorado survived bad reviews, financial failure, and shitposting |first=Petrana |last=Radulovic |date=April 1, 2020 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP: FILM PLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1519 [[Spain]], [[Confidence trick|con-artists]] Miguel and Tulio win a map to the legendary City of Gold, [[El Dorado]], in a rigged [[Dice#Loaded dice|dice]] [[Craps|gamble]] (though they ironically win the map fairly after Tulio was given normal dice from one of the opponents). After their con is exposed, the two evade the guards and accidentally stow away on one of the ships to be led by [[conquistador]] [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] for the [[New World]]. At sea, they are caught and imprisoned, but break free and steal a rowboat with the help of Cort\u00e9s' mistreated horse, Altivo.\n\nTheir boat reaches land, where Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a [[totem]] marker near a waterfall that Tulio believes is a dead end. As they prepare to leave, they encounter a [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|native]] woman, Chel, being chased by guards. When the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them and Chel to a secret entrance behind the falls, into El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kindhearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. The pair are mistaken for gods when a [[volcano]] coincidentally erupts but simultaneously stops during an argument between them and they are given luxurious quarters, along with the charge of Chel. She discovers that the two are conning her people, but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok, but disapprove of Tzekel-Kan attempting to [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] a civilian at the gods' ritual. Meanwhile, Cort\u00e9s and his men reach land.\n\nTulio and Miguel instruct Tannabok to build them a boat so that they can leave the city with all the gifts they have been given, under the ruse that they are needed back in the 'other world'. Chel gets romantically close to Tulio and Miguel explores the city, coming to appreciate the peaceful life embraced by the citizens; when Tzekel-Kan sees Miguel playing [[Mesoamerican ballgame|a ball game]] with children, he insists the \"gods\" demonstrate their powers against the city's best players. Tulio and Miguel are outmatched, but Chel replaces the ball with an [[armadillo]], allowing them to win. Miguel spares the ritual of sacrificing the losing team and berates Tzekel-Kan, to the crowd's approval and earning Tannabok's respect. Tzekel-Kan notices Miguel received a cut during the game and realizes the pair are not gods since gods do not bleed, hence the reason for the sacrifices. Afterward, Miguel, who has by then reconsidered leaving the city, overhears Tulio telling Chel that he would like her to come with them to Spain, before adding he would like her to come with specifically ''him'' and to forget Miguel \u2013 straining the relationship between the two. At a party being thrown for them, Miguel and Tulio begin to argue about Tulio and Chel's conversation and Miguel's desire to stay when Tzekel-Kan conjures a giant stone [[jaguar]] to chase them throughout the city. Tulio and Miguel manage to outwit the jaguar, causing it and Tzekel-Kan to fall into a [[cenote|giant whirlpool]], thought by the natives to be the entrance to [[Xibalba]], the spirit world. Tzekel-Kan then surfaces in the jungle, where he encounters Cort\u00e9s and his men. Believing Cort\u00e9s to be the real god, Tzekel-Kan offers to lead him to El Dorado.\n\nMiguel decides to stay in the city while Tulio and Chel board the completed boat, before they see smoke on the horizon and realize Cort\u00e9s is approaching. Knowing [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|what will happen if Cort\u00e9s discovers the city]], Tulio suggests using the boat to ram the rock pillars under the waterfall and block the main entrance to the city, despite knowing they will lose the gold in the process. The plan succeeds with the citizens pulling over a statue in the boat's wake to give it enough speed. As the statue starts to fall too quickly, Tulio has difficulty in preparing the boat's sail. Forfeiting his ability to stay in the city, Miguel and Altivo jump onto the boat to unfurl the sails, assuring the boat clears the statue in time. The group successfully crashes against the pillars, causing a cave-in, while losing all their gifts in the process. They hide near the totem just as Cort\u00e9s' men and Tzekel-Kan arrive. When they find the entrance blocked, Cort\u00e9s brands Tzekel-Kan a liar and leaves away by taking him as a slave. Tulio and Miguel, though disappointed they lost the gold (unaware that Altivo still wears the golden horseshoes with which he was outfitted in El Dorado), have appreciated the thrill of their adventure, and head in a different direction for a new adventure with Chel.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Miguel, a con artist and Tulio\u2019s friend. Miguel is more relaxed and laid-back in contrast to Tulio\u2019s more frantic nature. Miguel becomes accustomed to the peaceful life in El Dorado and values the city\u2019s people as opposed to the gold.\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Tulio, a con artist and Miguel\u2019s friend. He is the strategic planner, often becoming anxious and overthinking things. \n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Chel, a beautiful woman from El Dorado who discovers Tulio and Miguel's con and decides to play along in hopes of helping them escape El Dorado.\n* [[Armand Assante]] as Tzekel-Kan, the fanatically vicious [[high priest]] who has a religious fixation for human sacrifices. He initially believes Tulio and Miguel are gods until he discovers the truth.\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as Chief Tannabok, the skeptical, yet kind [[Tribal chief|chief]] of El Dorado who realizes that Tulio and Miguel aren't gods, but treats them with kindness and hospitality because of the good they show to his people.\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], the merciless and ambitious [[conquistador]] leader of the expedition to find the empires of the New World.\n** Cummings also voices the cook on Cort\u00e9s's ship, a warrior who gets stepped on by Tzekel-Kan's stone jaguar, and the native who warns Chief Tannabok about Cort\u00e9s. \n* [[Frank Welker]] as Altivo, Cort\u00e9s' horse who befriends Tulio and Miguel. \n** Welker also voices the Bull that chases Miguel and Tulio at the beginning of the movie.\n* [[Tobin Bell]] as Zaragoza, a sailor on the voyage to the New World of El Dorado and the original owner of the map, which he loses to Tulio and Miguel after a game of dice.\n* [[Elton John]] as The Singing Narrator.\n* [[Anne Lockhart (actress)|Anne Lockhart]] as Girl in Barcelona (uncredited)\n* [[Bob Bergen]] as Jaguar (uncredited)\n* Duncan Marjoribanks as Acolyte\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nShortly before the public announcement of DreamWorks SKG in October 1994, former [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] met with screenwriters [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] and gave them a copy of [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]]'s book ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortes and the Fall of Old Mexico'', desiring to make an animated film set in the [[Age of Discovery]]. By the spring of 1995, Elliott and Rossio devised a [[Film treatment|story treatment]] inspired by the [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]] ''[[Road to ...|Road to...]]'' films with self-interested, comedic anti-heroes who would set out to find the Lost City of Gold after acquiring a map to its location.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite interview|url=http://mjsimpson-films.blogspot.com/2013/04/interview-ted-elliott-and-terry-rossio.html|title=Interview: Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio|interviewer=MJ Simpson|via=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|date=April 27, 2013|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dreamworks\">{{cite book |last=Laporte |first=Nicole |date= May 4, 2010|title=The Men Who Would Be King: An Almost Epic Tale of Moguls, Movies, and a Company Called DreamWorks |chapter=Rolling |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_4hlDLco0AC&q=road+to+el+dorado+jeffrey+katzenberg&pg=PT229 |publisher=Mariner Books |pages=208\u20139 |isbn=978-0-547-52027-8 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> [[Will Finn]] and [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] were originally the film's directors with a tentative release scheduled for fall 1999.<ref name=LATHue>{{cite news|last1=Aleiss|first1=Angela|title=Animated Features of a Different Hue|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jan-24-ca-1004-story.html|access-date=June 24, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 24, 1999|quote=The movie features the voices of Edward James Olmos, Armand Assante and Rosie Perez and is tentatively scheduled for a fall release.}}</ref> Originally, the story was conceived as a dramatic film due to Katzenberg's penchant for large-scale animated films, which conflicted with the film's lighthearted elements.

A \"Cast & Crew Special Edition\" recording of the soundtrack exists, but was a promo-only release. It includes the theatrical versions of the songs, including \"It's Tough to Be a God\" recorded by [[Kevin Kline]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] (performed on the soundtrack by [[Elton John]] and [[Randy Newman]]), and several of the score tracks by [[Hans Zimmer]].
