The sequel to the 2010 film ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'' and the second film in the [[Percy Jackson (film series)|''Percy Jackson'' film series]], it is loosely based on the 2006 novel ''[[The Sea of Monsters]]'' by [[Rick Riordan]]. The film was released on August 7, 2013 in North America by [[20th Century Fox]].\n\nThe film continues the adventures of [[Percy Jackson]] ([[Logan Lerman]]) and his friends, as they search for the [[Golden Fleece]] at the [[Bermuda Triangle|Sea of Monsters]]. [[Brandon T. Jackson]], [[Alexandra Daddario]], and [[Jake Abel]] reprise their roles from the previous film, while [[Nathan Fillion]] and [[Anthony Head]] replace [[Dylan Neal]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]]. New additions to the cast include [[Leven Rambin]], [[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]], and [[Stanley Tucci]]. The film was produced by Karen Rosenfelt and [[Michael Barnathan]]. [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], who directed the first film, serves as executive producer. The plot centers on Percy and his friends as they journey to the eponymous Sea of Monsters to retrieve the [[Golden Fleece]] in order to save the tree (barrier) that protects their home.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews, with praise for its visuals and action, but criticism for its plot and characters. It grossed $200.9 million at the box office worldwide against a production budget of $90 million. The book series consists of five novels; a sequel based on ''[[The Titan's Curse]]'' was planned, but never produced. Following the [[acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] in 2019, Disney consequently gained the rights to the ''Percy Jackson'' novels, upon which Riordan pitched a new adaptation, set to be produced as a [[Percy Jackson and the Olympians (TV series)|TV series]] for [[Disney+]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n[[Percy Jackson]] recounts the story of [[Thalia Grace]]: Pursued by monsters on their way to Camp Half-Blood, a young Thalia sacrificed herself to save her friends, [[Annabeth Chase]], [[Luke Castellan]] and [[Grover Underwood]]. Her father [[Zeus]] honored her sacrifice by turning her into a tree, which forms a protective barrier around the camp, keeping everyone within a safe zone. In the present day, [[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief|Percy's quest for Zeus's bolt]] has faded in popularity and he is called a one-quest wonder by camp bully [[Clarisse La Rue]], but is still supported by Annabeth and Grover. He is joined at camp by a young [[Cyclopes|cyclops]] named Tyson, who was thought to be a regular mortal until revealed as a son of [[Poseidon]], and therefore his brother.\n\nAfter an attack by a [[Khalkotauroi|Colchis bull]], the campers discover Thalia's tree has been poisoned by Luke and the barrier is vulnerable. Percy consults the [[Oracle]], who tells him of a prophecy of a half-blood of the eldest gods either saving or destroying [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]. [[Chiron]] tells Percy that he is the only living, human half-blood of the eldest gods, so the Prophecy may refer to him. Annabeth and Grover learn about the [[Golden Fleece]], which has the power to heal anything, and propose a quest to retrieve the Fleece and use it to heal Thalia's tree. Counsellor Mr. D claims the idea as his and chooses Clarisse to lead the quest.\n\nPercy and Annabeth set off without being chosen, joined by Tyson. They leave camp on the Chariot of Damnation (a [[New York City cab]]), where the three drivers (the [[Graeae]]) tell Percy more about his prophecy and coordinates for the Sea of Monsters (the [[Bermuda Triangle]]). The group are ejected in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] for lacking [[Greek drachma|drachmas]], where Grover is kidnapped. The others, with the help of [[Hermes]], track him down to Luke's yacht, the ''Andromeda'', which they reach riding [[Hippocampus (mythology)|Hippokamposes]]. On board, Luke reveals his plan to have [[Cronus|Kronos]] the [[Titans|titan]] destroy Olympus by reviving him with the fleece and locks the group in the brig, but Percy uses his ability to manipulate water to break them free.\n\nEscaping the yacht, they are consumed by [[Charybdis]], where they discover Clarisse in the monster's stomach. Percy and Clarisse work together to escape Charybdis by shooting a hole through its gut, then chart a course to Circeland, off the coast of [[Florida]]. There they discover [[Polyphemus]]'s lair, where the fleece is kept and Grover is being held captive by the cyclops. They rescue Grover, retrieve the fleece and trap Polyphemus in his cave. Luke ambushes them and shoots at Percy with a crossbow for not handing over the fleece, but Tyson takes the bolt and falls into a roaring stream. Luke takes the fleece and the group hostage\n\nAs Luke begins reviving Kronos from his [[sarcophagus]], Annabeth encourages Percy to take leadership. The team escapes captivity and Percy grapples with Luke over the fleece, like the prophecy said they would. Luke gets Percy in submission but he is saved by Tyson, who survived his wound by being healed by the water, as he is Poseidon's son. Kronos rises from the sarcophagus and consumes Luke and Grover before battling Percy. Percy realizes that his sword is the \"cursed blade\" of the prophecy and slices Kronos into pieces and imprisons the titan in the sarcophagus once again, after regurgitating Grover and Luke, the latter landing in Polyphemus's Lair and is presumably eaten. Annabeth is stabbed in the back by the [[Manticore]] and dies in Percy's arms, but is resurrected by the fleece.\n\nPercy gives the fleece to Clarisse and they return to Camp Half-Blood, where she places it on Thalia's tree. The next day Thalia is found alive, as the fleece was powerful enough to resurrect and return her to human form. Percy realizes that Thalia, as the daughter of Zeus, is another possible child referred to in the prophecy about Olympus.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also| List of Percy Jackson & the Olympians cast members}}\n\n===Demigods===\n* [[Logan Lerman]] as [[Percy Jackson]], son of [[Poseidon]].<ref name=\"Anthony Head Chiron\" />\n* [[Alexandra Daddario]] as [[Annabeth Chase]], daughter of [[Athena]], and Percy's secret crush.<ref name=\"Anthony Head Chiron\" />\n** [[Alisha Newton]] portrays a younger Annabeth.\n* [[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]] as [[Tyson (Percy Jackson)|Tyson]], Percy's [[Cyclops]] [[Half-siblings|half-brother]].<ref name=\"Douglas Smith Negotiates Percy Sequel\">{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118050405|title='Percy' sequel zeroes in on Smith|date=February 16, 2012 |access-date=March 21, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Leven Rambin]] as Clarisse La Rue, daughter of [[Ares]].<ref name=\"ibtimes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/451671/20130329/logan-lerman-returns-percy-jackson-sea-monsters.htm#.UVc64_HMvaw |title=First Look: Logan Lerman Returns for 'Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters' with New Backup [PHOTOS&#93; |work=International Business Times |date=March 29, 2013 |access-date=July 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331004801/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/451671/20130329/logan-lerman-returns-percy-jackson-sea-monsters.htm#.UVc64_HMvaw |archive-date=March 31, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Brandon T.
