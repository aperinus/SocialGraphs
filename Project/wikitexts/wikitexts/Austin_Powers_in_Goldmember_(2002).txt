Goldmember developed a power unit for a [[tractor beam]] which Dr. Evil names \"[[Preparation H]]\" and he intends to use it to pull a [[meteor]] into the earth. [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]], in to watch production on a movie about his life, and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] invade the lair and arrest Dr. Evil and Mini-Me. Queen [[Elizabeth II]] [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knights]] Austin for his service, but Austin is disappointed when his father, the famous spy [[List of Austin Powers characters#Nigel Powers|Nigel Powers]], does not attend the event. During an after party, [[Basil Exposition]] informs Austin that Nigel has been kidnapped and the only clue is that the crew of his yacht have had their [[Goldfinger (film)|genitalia painted gold]].\n\nAustin seeks Dr. Evil's help to find the culprit, but the imprisoned Dr. Evil antagonizes Austin by reminding him that his father was also absent when he was given the title of \"International Man of Mystery\" during their British Intelligence academy graduation, an event that angered Dr. Evil due to him being the top of the class. He eventually tells him that Goldmember is behind the abduction so Austin time travels to 1975 and infiltrates Goldmember's [[roller disco]] club. He is reunited with his former lover, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[List of Austin Powers characters#Foxxy Cleopatra|Foxxy Cleopatra]] who is undercover. Austin locates his father but is unable to rescue him and Goldmember takes Nigel through Dr. Evil's time machine to 2002. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me instigate a riot in their prison, allowing them to escape. A British Intelligence [[mole (espionage)|mole]] named Number 3 informs Austin that Dr. Evil has moved to a new lair near [[Tokyo]].\n\nAustin, accompanied by Foxxy, travels to Tokyo and they confront [[Fat Bastard (character)|Fat Bastard]], who is now a [[sumo wrestling|Sumo wrestler]]. Fat Bastard reveals that businessman Mr. Roboto is working on a device for Dr. Evil and Goldmember. Austin and Foxxy meet with Roboto, who pleads ignorance. Austin and Foxxy infiltrate Roboto's factory where the command unit for the tractor beam is being loaded in Goldmember's car, and Roboto gives Goldmember a golden key needed to activate the beam. Foxxy confronts Goldmember while Austin attempts to free Nigel, but Goldmember escapes and flees to Dr. Evil's submarine. Scott Evil presents Dr. Evil with sharks with [[laser beams]] attached to their heads, [[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery|a request that had gone unfulfilled previously]]. Roboto then dies when Scott causes him to fall into the shark pool. Dr. Evil replaces Mini-Me with Scott as his favored son and the rejected clone defects and joins Austin and Foxxy.\n\nThe trio infiltrate the submarine but Austin is captured. Dr. Evil prepares to activate the tractor beam, but Foxxy steals the key and frees Austin. Austin prepares to shoot Dr. Evil, when Nigel appears and reveals that Austin and Dr. Evil are actually twin brothers. Confused, Dr. Evil explains that his parents died in a car accident and he was brought up by evil [[Belgians]], but Nigel reveals that the explosion came from an assassination attempt and he thought that only Austin survived. Dr. Evil (revealed to be named Dougie), Austin, Nigel, and Mini-Me embrace; enraging Scott, who leaves to pursue his own vengeance while Goldmember commandeers the tractor beam's controls, unzipping his trousers to reveal his gold-covered genitalia to be a spare key. Goldmember activates the tractor beam, but Austin and Dr. Evil work together to reverse its polarity, destroying the meteor and saving the world.\n\nGoldmember turns to the camera to reveal the entire story was [[story within a story|adapted into a film]] called ''[[Octopussy|Austinpussy]]'' and was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], starring [[Tom Cruise]] as Austin, [[Kevin Spacey]] as Dr. Evil, [[Danny DeVito]] as Mini-Me, and [[John Travolta]] as Goldmember. Upon exiting the cinema, Austin and Foxxy encounter Fat Bastard, now thin but with sagging flesh thanks to the [[Jared Fogle#Subway campaign|Subway diet]]. As Austin and Foxxy kiss, Scott Evil \u2013 now completely bald, dressed and behaving as his father, declares he will get his revenge against Austin before dancing like [[Michael Jackson]].
