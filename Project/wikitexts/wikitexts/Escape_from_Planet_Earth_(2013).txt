The film was released on February 15, 2013. ''Escape from Planet Earth'' received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics and  grossed over $74 million on a budget of $40 million.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Planet Baab, reckless astronaut Scorch Supernova works at BASA with his nerdy older brother, Gary. One day, Gary receives a message from the head of BASA, Lena, that Scorch will be sent to the \"Dark Planet\" (the Baabians' name for [[Earth]]) due to an SOS call. Gary opposes the idea, but Scorch accepts without his approval, leading for Gary to quit his job. Gary goes home to his wife, Kira, and his adventure-hungry son, Kip, only to find out that Scorch has already gone to the Dark Planet, via live TV.\n\nScorch arrives on Earth and finds a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store, where he is ambushed by the US Army, led by General William T. Shanker, and is taken to [[Area 51]]. Witnessing this, Kip wants to go rescue Scorch, but Gary discourages him, upsetting Kip. That night, Gary goes to Kip's room to apologize only to find that Kip has escaped. He rushes to BASA with Kira and arrives in time to cancel a launch sequence at the last second and save Kip. Gary, having a change of heart, re-activates the sequence so he himself can rescue Scorch. Gary then arrives at the same 7-Eleven that Scorch arrived at earlier and is shortly captured by Shanker's men, taking him to Area 51 as well.\n\nGary is taken to Shanker's office where he is quickly removed after he receives an incoming call from Lena, who is revealed to be Shanker's girlfriend, as she has sent him the most powerful energy source in the galaxy, known as \"blubonium\", via Scorch\u2019s robotic suit, not knowing Shanker only uses her to get the source. Gary is placed in a cell hall where he meets other aliens that were captured: a [[mouse]]-like alien named Doc, a [[cyclops]]-like alien named Io, and a [[slug]]-like alien named Thurman, who tell Gary that various human technology has been invented by them for Shanker to rip off and sell in exchange for their undetermined release from Area 51. Gary reunites with Scorch, but is again annoyed by his behavior. Meanwhile, Lena captures Kira, who stayed at BASA and tried contacting Gary on his rescue mission, while revealing her plan to give Shanker a lifetime supply of blubonium.\n\nThe aliens are directed to the base's \"peace shield\", with Shanker revealing the blubonium, and Gary unintentionally provoking Scorch into stealing and breaking it. Shanker places Scorch into a freezing chamber and orders Gary to fix the blubonium for his brother's release, revealing that he plans to destroy all alien planets with life on them, stemming from an incident which a trio of [[grey alien]]s' spaceship (accidentally) killed his father back in [[Roswell incident|1947]]. Gary fixes the ray with help from his new friends, but Shanker goes back on his deal and freezes him as well. The other aliens discover Shanker's true intentions when he attempts to destroy Baab with the laser, but it is revealed that Gary rigged the machine to malfunction, destroying itself, and causing Gary, Scorch and other imprisoned Aliens to be released from their icy prisons. The brothers along with their new friends, escape Area 51, and head for Baab after locating Scorch's spaceship.\n\nMeanwhile, back on Baab, Kip frees Kira, who subdues Lena after the latter takes off with a blubonium shipment. [[US Air Force]] jets chase the Scorch's ship, but Kip guides him through and manages to evade and destroy the jets. However, Shanker, wearing Scorch's robotic suit, uses a tractor beam to stop the ship in midair. Gary, followed by Scorch, jump out and manage to get the suit off Shanker which causes them all to plummet. While freefalling, Scorch and Gary reconcile before they and Shanker are rescued by the grey aliens, who previously helped Shanker due to their guilt of causing his father\u2019s death but now turn against him after discovering his true agenda. After Gary knocks out Shanker, the grey aliens take him away. Scorch and Gary return to Planet Baab where Gary is reunited with his family. Scorch is greeted as a hero, but gives the credit to his brother. To celebrate his return, Scorch marries his girlfriend, [[Journalist|anchorwoman]] Gabby Babblebrook, with Gary as his best man to Planet Baab.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Gary Supernova, Scorch\u2019s older brother, who is also the head of mission control at BASA.\n* [[Brendan Fraser]] as Scorch Supernova, an arrogant but benevolent space pilot, Gary\u2019s younger brother.\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Kira Supernova, Gary\u2019s wife, who worked 15 years at the BASA Academy as a [[test pilot]].\n* [[William Shatner]] as General William T.
