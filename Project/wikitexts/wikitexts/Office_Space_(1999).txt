It stars [[Ron Livingston]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Stephen Root]], [[David Herman]], [[Ajay Naidu]], and [[Diedrich Bader]].<ref>{{cite news| url= https://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/19/entertainment/ca-9435| title='Office' Puts Corporate Culture Through the Comedy Shredder| author=Kevin Thomas| date=February 19, 1999| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| access-date=April 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Office Space'' was filmed in [[Dallas]] and [[Austin, Texas]]. It is based on Judge's ''[[Milton (cartoon)|Milton]]'' cartoon series and was his first foray into live-action filmmaking and his second full-length motion picture release, following ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]''. The film's sympathetic depiction of ordinary [[information technology]] workers garnered a cult following within that field, but it also addresses themes familiar to [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] employees and the workforce in general. It was a box office disappointment, making $12.2 million on a $10 million production budget; however, after repeated airings on [[Comedy Central]], it sold well on home video, and has become a [[cult film]].<ref name=\"Doty\">{{cite news | last=Doty | first=Meriah |title=Film flops flourish on DVD, VHS | work=CNN | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/second.wind/index.html | date=March 4, 2003 | access-date=2008-09-18}}</ref>\n\nSeveral aspects of the film have become [[Internet meme]]s. A scene where the three main characters systematically destroy a dysfunctional printer has been widely parodied. [[Swingline]] introduced a red stapler to its product line after the Milton character used one painted that color in the film. Judge's 2009 film ''[[Extract (film)|Extract]]'' is also set in an office and was intended as a companion piece to ''Office Space''.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Gibbons is a frustrated and unmotivated programmer who works at Initech. Unable to stand up to his overcritical girlfriend, Anne, he is in love with local waitress Joanna but is afraid to speak to her. He is friends with co-workers Samir Nagheenanajar (who loathes that no one can ever say his last name correctly) and Michael Bolton (who loathes being associated with the [[Michael Bolton|famous singer of the same name]]). Another co-worker in the office is Milton Waddams, a meek collator who is mostly ignored by the rest of the office except Peter. Also, there is Tom Smykowski, a jaded man who helps engineers communicate with customers. Tom is routinely scared of being fired. The staff suffers under top-heavy, callous management, especially from Initech's vice president [[Bill Lumbergh]], whom Peter hates and avoids confronting. Lumbergh takes obvious delight in micromanaging all his staff, particularly Milton and Peter. He makes Milton move his desk constantly, takes his beloved red stapler, and makes him do more and more work, whilst making Peter work almost every weekend. \n\nAnne persuades Peter to attend an occupational hypnotherapy session led by Dr. Swanson. Swanson hypnotizes Peter and tells him to feel relaxed and stop caring about his job until he snaps his fingers. However, Swanson suddenly dies of a heart attack before snapping Peter out of his relaxed state. Peter sleeps soundly through most of the next day, ignoring phone calls from Lumbergh and Anne, who angrily breaks up with him while confirming suspicions that she has been cheating on him.\n\nPeter begins dating Joanna, who shares his loathing of management and love of kung fu movies. She is required to wear \"pieces of flair\" (buttons meant to allow employees to \"express themselves\"). Her boss often hassles her for not wearing more than the required minimum.\n\nMeanwhile, a pair of business consultants, Bob Slydell and Bob Porter (\"the Bobs\") are brought in to help the company [[layoff|downsize]]. Peter eventually shows up to work and casually disregards office protocol, violating the dress code and messily removing a cubicle wall blocking his view out the window. Impressed by Peter's frank insights into Initech's problems, the Bobs promote him despite Lumbergh's misgivings. Michael and Samir, however, are fired. Milton is also to be terminated, but it is learned that he was laid off five years ago but neither Milton nor the accounting department was notified. To avoid confrontation, the Bobs and Lumbergh tell accounting to cease Milton's salary payments without telling him. Milton is subjected to further mistreatment, including the confiscation of his stapler and the constant moving of his desk, eventually down to the basement.\n\nTired of being mistreated, Peter, Michael, and Samir decide to take revenge by infecting Initech's accounting system with a [[computer virus]] designed by Michael to divert huge numbers of fractions of pennies into a bank account (a technique that has long been known and described as [[Salami slicing tactics|salami slicing]]). Such transactions are small enough to avoid detection but will result in the accrual of a substantial amount of money over time. Peter successfully installs the virus and on Michael and Samir's last day, he steals a frequently malfunctioning printer, which the three proceed to destroy. At a party, Peter hears rumors from a colleague that Joanna had slept with Lumbergh. When Joanna confirms this, a heated exchange leads to them breaking up. Frustrated with her job, Joanna gives her boss [[the finger]] (in front of customers) and quits in response to another lecture about her lack of \"flair\".\n\nPeter discovers that a [[Software bug|bug]] in Michael's code has caused the virus to steal over $300,000 which is very conspicuous and guarantees they will be caught. The trio tries to devise a plan to [[Money laundering|launder the money]] to no avail. Peter decides to accept full responsibility for the crime. He writes a confession and slips it under Lumbergh's office door after hours, along with [[traveler's check]]s for the stolen money. Peter then learns that the \"Lumbergh\" that Joanna slept with was an ex-colleague unrelated to Bill Lumbergh. He meets Joanna, who has started a new job at another restaurant. He apologizes to her, and they reconcile.\n\nThe next morning, Peter drives to Initech expecting to be arrested but discovers that the building is on fire, which destroys all evidence of the scheme. He sees Milton at the scene, apparently having made good on repeated threats to burn down the building after being mistreated. Samir and Michael begin new jobs at Initech's rival Intertrode, while Peter's neighbor Lawrence helps him find a new job as a construction worker, an occupation which he enjoys. Milton, having found and taken the traveler's checks while searching for his stapler in Lumbergh's office, uses the money to vacation in [[Mexico]], where he threatens to put [[strychnine]] in the resort's guacamole after being neglected by staff. As he digs through the rubble that was once Initech's building, Peter finds the burnt remains of Milton's stapler, leading him to look to the sky and smile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing| <!-- opening title cards -->\n* [[Ron Livingston]] as Peter Gibbons\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as Joanna\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Milton Waddams\n* [[Gary Cole]] as [[Bill Lumbergh]]\n* [[John C.

They first aired on ''[[Liquid Television]]'' and ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]'', and later aired on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name=\"fierman\">{{cite magazine | last = Fierman | first = Daniel | title = Judge's Dread | magazine = Entertainment Weekly | date = February 26, 1999 | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274497,00.html | access-date = 2007-08-16 }}</ref> The inspiration came from a temp job which he had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders<ref name=\"beale\">{{cite news | last = Beale | first = Lewis | title = Mr. Beavis Goes to Work | work = [[New York Daily News]] | date = February 21, 1999 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/mr-beavis-work-irreverent-animator-s-newest-target-corporate-america-live-action-film-office-space-article-1.839280 | access-date =2013-05-03 }}</ref> and another job as an engineer for [[Parallax Graphics]] for three months in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] during the 1980s,<ref name=Leckart2014>{{cite magazine | last=Leckart | first=Steven | date=April 2, 2014 | url=http://www.wired.com/2014/04/mike-judge-silicon-valley/ | title=Mike Judge Skewers Silicon Valley With the Satire of Our Dreams | magazine=Wired | publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402203558/http://www.wired.com/2014/04/mike-judge-silicon-valley/ | archivedate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> \"just in the heart of [[Silicon Valley]] and in the middle of that overachiever [[yuppie]] thing, it was just awful\".<ref name=\"sherman\">{{cite news | last = Sherman | first = Paul | title = Humorist is a good Judge of office angst | work = [[Boston Herald]] | date = February 21, 1999 }}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Chernin]], head of [[20th Century Fox]], where Judge had a deal, wanted to make a film out of the Milton character,<ref name=\"EW oral history\">{{cite news|last=Hunt|first=Stacey Wilson|title=The oral history of 'Office Space': Behind the scenes of the cult classic|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/01/11/office-space-oral-history/|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 11, 2019|access-date=February 3, 2019}}</ref> inspired by a former coworker of Judge's in Silicon Valley who had threatened to quit if the company moved his desk again.<ref name=\"NYTmag Judge article\">{{cite news|last=Staley|first=Willy|title=The Bard of Suck|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/magazine/mike-judge-the-bard-of-suck.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=April 13, 2017|access-date=February 21, 2019}}</ref> \"You don't want to know what he does at home after work\", Judge replied.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" /> Instead he suggested an [[ensemble cast]]\u2013based film;<ref name=\"sherman\"/> someone at the studio responded with ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' but \"just set in an office\".<ref name=\"sherman\"/>\n\nMilton was not the only character inspired by someone from Judge's past. During his jobs in Silicon Valley, where he barely made enough to afford his rent, he had a neighbor who was an auto mechanic. Not only did the man make more money, he had flexible work hours and seemed to Judge to be much more content with his life and work than he himself was. The neighbor inspired Lawrence, Peter's neighbor in the film.<ref name=\"NYTmag Judge article\" />\n\nThe setting of the film reflects a prevailing trend that Judge observed in the United States. \"It seems like every city now has these identical office parks with identical adjoining chain restaurants\", he said in an interview.<ref name=\"fierman\"/> \"There were a lot of people who wanted me to set this movie in [[Wall Street]], or like the movie ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', but I wanted it very unglamorous, the kind of bleak work situation like I was in\".<ref name=\"beale\"/>\n\nJudge wrote a [[Film treatment|treatment]] in 1996, and the script after [[King of the Hill (season 1)|the first season]] of ''[[King of the Hill]]''.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" /> Fox president [[Tom Rothman]] was happy with the draft as he was looking for lighter material to balance the [[event movie]]s like ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' that dominated the studio's output at the time. He considered it \"the most brilliant workplace satire I'd ever read\".<ref name=\"EW oral history\" /> Despite that, Judge hated the ending and wished he could have completely rewritten the third act.<ref name=\"Valby\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Jennifer Aniston 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jennifer Aniston]] was cast in ''Office Space'' to feature a recognizable star.]]\n[[David Herman]] was the only actor Judge had in mind for a specific part: Michael Bolton. Herman had been trying to leave his seven-year contract at ''[[MADtv]]'', but the show would not let him. So, at its next [[table reading]], he managed to get himself fired by screaming all his lines. [[Greg Daniels]] said they could always find a place for him on ''King of the Hill'', where he had been doing some voice work; soon after he read Judge's ''Office Space'' script and was delighted with it.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nAt the first read-through of the script, Judge was pleased with Herman's performance, and felt Stephen Root improved on his own take on Milton, but was not happy with the rest of the cast. He considered abandoning the film, but Rothman said it worked and just needed the right actors.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" /> According to Judge, while Fox at first told him to just get the best actors possible since the film's budget would not be large enough to consider [[bankable star]]s, the studio soon changed its mind. In the wake of the success of ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', he was advised to get that film's stars, [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Matt Damon]]. Again, he almost changed his mind about the film (Rothman said in 2019 that while [[A-list]] stars are often unlikely to take roles in low-budget productions, those films should nevertheless make the effort to attract them). He had agreed to meet with Damon in New York, but then [[Ron Livingston]]'s agent asked if his client could audition for the lead. [[Casting director]] Nancy Klopper was impressed, and after Judge saw the video he told the studio that he wanted Livingston in the part.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\n[[Jennifer Aniston]] was cast to accommodate Fox's desire to have a recognizable star in the film, although they were concerned that her part was so small; the subplot involving her battle with her boss over her \"flair\" was added as a result and she was written out of the sex-dream sequence, along with dialogue indicating she actually had slept with Lumbergh. However, she had liked the script since she was not getting many other films like that at that point, and she had gone to the same high school as Herman. [[Kate Hudson]] also read for the part.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nAfter casting the [[Indian American]] [[Ajay Naidu]] as Samir, who had originally been written as [[Iranian American|Iranian]], the character was rewritten to be [[Jordanian American|Jordanian]], and Naidu worked with a [[dialect coach]] to get the accent right. [[John C. McGinley]] auditioned for Lumbergh, but was ultimately cast as Slydell. Judge says that after [[Gary Cole]] read for Lumbergh, there was no doubt as to who would play him. \"He made the character 10 times funnier.\" A casting search in Texas yielded [[Greg Pitts]] for Drew, but no one who could play the Tchotchkie's manager, so Judge took that role himself.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\n===Principal photography===\n\nJudge made the transition from animation to live-action with the help of [[Tim Suhrstedt]], the film's [[director of photography]], who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, \"I had a great crew, and it's good going into it not pretending you're an expert\".<ref name=\"beale\"/> [[Principal photography]] began in Texas in May 1998.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nSeveral issues arose during filming. By the third day of shooting, temperatures had risen over {{convert|100|F}}, and smoke from fires in Mexico was filling the sky over [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], making it white. Suhrstedt says that forced the postponement of the opening traffic-jam scene until it cleared.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nStudio executives who saw the [[dailies]] were not happy with the footage that Judge was getting. Judge quoted studio executies as stating, \"More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You're failing! You're failing!\"<ref name=\"Valby\">{{cite web |last1=Valby |first1=Kate |title=The Fax of Life |url=https://ew.com/article/2003/05/23/fax-life/ |website=EW.com |publisher=Entertainment Weekly` |access-date=10 August 2021 |ref=Valby |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622041815/https://ew.com/article/2003/05/23/fax-life/ |archive-date=June 22, 2019}}</ref> They also asked for Livingston to smile more. But at that point, only the early scenes had been filmed; Judge told the studio that happier scenes would come later. Livingston says he heard they believed he was on drugs and were considering firing him.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nIn addition, Fox did not like the [[gangsta rap]] music used in the film.<ref name=\"Valby\"/> Rothman told him he had to take it out, and Judge said after production he would do so if the next [[focus group]] also disliked it. A young man in that focus group said the fact that the characters worked in an office but listened to gangsta rap was one of the things he liked about the movie, and Rothman relented.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nThe scene where Peter, Michael and Samir take their office printer out into a field and batter it to pieces was inspired by Judge's experience with his own printer while writing ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]''. He told his cowriter [[Joe Stillman]] that he was so frustrated by it that when he was done with the script he planned to take it out into a field and destroy it while videotaping the process. Suhrstedt says the whole sequence was largely improvised, but Naidu adds that they were trying to do it in a way that evoked how the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] would do it to someone it wanted to punish or kill; Livingston thus played his part like the \"[[Boss (crime)|don]]\", circling behind Naidu and Herman while they struck the blows with bat, feet and fists. Years afterward, Naidu says, he met some actual mafiosi in New York who told him that they were huge fans of the film, and the scene was \"authentic\".<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nMcGinley says the film contains many improvised moments. \"It was like jazz on that set\". One example he recalled was when [[Paul Willson]] as Bob Porter cannot pronounce Samir's last name: \"Naga ... Naga ... well, not gonna work here anymore anyway.\" Naidu, for his part, improvised the [[break dancing]], which he did with local friends after shooting his scenes during the day.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nThe improvisation also helped solve some problems with the script. Originally Bolton was to refer to [[Michael Bolton|the singer he shared his name with]] as a \"no-singing asshole\". However, Herman recalled, it was decided that the film could not say that since it would imply he did not sing his own songs, so he came up with \"no-talent ass-clown\".<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\n===Production design===\n\nJudge was very exacting in his demands for how the Initech set looked; he said regularly that it had to seem \"oppressive\". The production went as far as [[screen test|screen-testing]] different types of gray [[cubicle]]s; Judge also wanted the cubicles to be tall so that Lumbergh would have to lean in to be seen from Peter's desk. Considerable effort was also expended to making sure the [[TPS report#In popular culture|TPS reports]] looked realistic.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nThe glasses Root wore to play Milton had lenses so thick that he had to wear [[contact lens]]es to see through them. Even so, he still had no [[depth perception]]; he had to practice reaching for the stapler and was as a result grateful it had been painted red. [[Swingline]] provided the stapler after the filmmakers could not get permission to use either the Boston or [[Bostitch]] brands from their manufacturer.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\n==Release==\n\n===Marketing===\nJudge hated the [[One sheet#Cinema|onesheet poster]] that the studio created for ''Office Space'', which depicted an office worker completely covered in [[Post-it notes]]. He said, \"People were like, 'What is this? A big bird? A mummy? A beekeeper?' And the tagline 'Work Sucks'? It looked like an [[Office Depot]] ad. I just hated it. I hated the trailers, too and the TV ads especially\".<ref name=\"Valby\"/> McGinley, too, felt it looked like [[Big Bird]] from the children's series ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and that he would not go to see such a film. For the home release Judge was upset that the same image was used, albeit with Milton peeking over the man from behind.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nThe studio also had a man live in a [[Plexiglas]] cube above [[Times Square]] for five days, who was broadcast live on the Internet as he answered calls and emails from people dissatisfied with their jobs.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2022-09-27|title=Office Guy: A Working Perspective|date=February 18, 1999|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/2/18/office-guy-a-working-perspective-p/|website=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}</ref> Livingston, when he visited the cube for press events, found that most reporters preferred to talk to the man in the cube and not him. He was not surprised, as tracking for the movie was not good and \"there was a foregone conclusion that it wasn't going to open well.\" Producer Michael Rotenberg elaborated that \"[i]t took a few research screenings to realize that audiences often have issues with satire.\"<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nAnother problem that Rothman later conceded was that they could not put Aniston on the poster due to her small role.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" /> Later he admitted that the marketing campaign did not work and said, \"''Office Space'' isn't like ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''. It doesn't have the kind of jokes you put in a 15-second television spot of somebody getting hit on the head with a frying pan. It's sly. And let me tell you, sly is hard to sell\".<ref name=\"Valby\"/>\n\n===Box office===\n''Office Space'' was released on February 19, 1999, at the end of the release calendar's \"[[dump months]]\", in 1,740 theatres, grossing $4.2 million on its opening weekend. That was eighth overall and second for new releases after ''[[October Sky]]''.<ref name=\"mojo opening weekend\">{{cite web|title=February 19-21, 1999|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1999&wknd=08&p=.htm|access-date=February 5, 2019}}</ref> Herman said he was elated after seeing the film in Los Angeles and hearing it had made $7 million, until friends more familiar with the movie business told him that was considered a poor performance.<ref name=\"EW oral history\" />\n\nSuhrstedt saw it later in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], and the theater was almost full. He assured Judge that [[word of mouth]] would slowly increase the audience. However, in early March, Fox pulled it from three-quarters of the screens it had been on after it barely made a million dollars that weekend. The movie's grosses continued to decline precipitously, and after the end of March, when it pulled in less than $40,000 from 75 screens, it was pulled from release altogether.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite news|title=Office Space|work=Box Office Mojo|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=officespace.htm|access-date=February 5, 2019}}</ref> According to Judge, a studio executive blamed the movie exclusively for the failure, telling him \"Nobody wants to see your little movie about ordinary people and their boring little lives\".<ref name=Extract>{{cite web| url = http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/Extract-BEHINDTHESCENES.php| title = Extract-Behind the Scenes| work = wildaboutmovies.com| author = Nasson, Tim| date = August 13, 2009| access-date = February 7, 2019| archive-date = June 30, 2017| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170630070806/http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/Extract-BEHINDTHESCENES/| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt went on to make $10.8 million in North America.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> The international release brought an additional $2 million.<ref name=\"thenum\" /> On home release, $8 million in DVD, [[Blu-ray Disc]] and VHS sales<ref name=\"thenum\" /> were sold at release as of April, 2006.<ref name=\"Numbers2\">{{cite web | url= https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Office-Space#tab=video-sales | title=Office Space - DVD sales | publisher=the-numbers.com | access-date=December 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 80% based on 102 reviews and an average rating of 6.84/10.

Fox suggested that next time, he pay more heed to the studio's casting suggestions. However, he soon learned that the film had not gone unnoticed within the industry. \"[[Jim Carrey]] invited me to his house. [[Chris Rock]] left me the best voicemail ever.
