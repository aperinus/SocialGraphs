It stars [[Eminem]] in his film debut, alongside [[Mekhi Phifer]], [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Anthony Mackie]], and [[Kim Basinger]]. The film, which contains autobiographical elements from Eminem's life, follows white rapper Jimmy Smith Jr. aka B-Rabbit (Eminem) and his attempt to launch a career in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], a [[music genre]] dominated by [[African Americans]]. The title is derived from [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|8 Mile Road]], the highway between the predominantly [[African American]] city of [[Detroit]] and the largely white suburban communities to the north that Eminem originally lived in.\n\n''8 Mile'' was a critical and box office success. It opened at {{Numero|1}} in the US with $51.3 million grossed in its opening weekend and an eventual total of $242.9 million worldwide.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\" /> The album's accompanying [[8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture|soundtrack]] was also a commercial success, being certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Soundtrack, 8 Mile|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=soundtrack&ti=8+Mile&format=Album&type=#search_section|website=[[RIAA]]|language=en-US|access-date=2022-09-07}}</ref> The film garnered numerous award nominations and wins, including an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Lose Yourself]]\" win for Eminem, [[Luis Resto (musician)|Luis Resto]] and [[Jeff Bass]] at the [[75th Academy Awards]]. ''8 Mile'' was named one of the best films of 2002 by several publications.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1995, Jimmy \"B-Rabbit\" Smith Jr. a 23-year old, unhappy [[blue-collar worker]] from a poor [[Missouri]] family who now are residing in a trailer park near [[Detroit]] in [[Warren, Michigan]]. Jimmy has moved back north of [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|8 Mile Road]] to the run-down trailer home in [[Warren, Michigan]], of his alcoholic mother Stephanie, his younger sister Lily, and Stephanie's abusive live-in boyfriend Greg. Although encouraged by his friends, Jimmy worries about his potential as a rapper. One night, Jimmy chokes during a [[Battle rap|rap battle]] at a local venue, the [[The Shelter (Detroit)|Shelter]], and he leaves the stage humiliated.\n\nDuring the day, Jimmy works at a car factory, after previously working at a  [[Little Caesars|Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza]] in Warren. Desperate for money, he asks for extra shifts, but his supervisor bluntly dismisses his request because of his habitual tardiness. Later on, Jimmy befriends a woman named Alex, and he begins to take more responsibility for the direction of his life.\n\nAt some point, Stephanie receives an eviction notice, as she cannot pay rent. Despite her best attempts to keep the eviction notice a secret, Greg discovers it and confronts Stephanie. When Jimmy punches Greg for pushing his mother to the ground, they fight, ending in Greg leaving Stephanie for good.\n\nJimmy's friendship with Wink, a radio DJ with ties to a record label promoter, becomes strained after he discovers that Wink does promotional work for Jimmy's rivals, a rap group known as the \"Leaders of the Free World\". At one point, Jimmy and his friends get into a violent brawl with the Free World crew, which is disrupted when Jimmy's friend Cheddar Bob pulls out a gun and accidentally shoots himself in the leg; he survives after being rushed to the hospital.\n\nDuring a lunch break at work, one of Jimmy's co-workers performs a freestyle rap insulting a gay co-worker, Paul. Jimmy raps a freestyle defending Paul. Alex arrives and is impressed by Jimmy's actions and they have sex. Wink arranges for Jimmy to meet with producers at a recording studio, but Jimmy finds Wink and Alex having sex. Enraged, Jimmy attacks Wink as Alex tries to break them up. In retaliation, Wink and the Leaders of the Free World assault Jimmy outside his trailer. The leader of the gang, Papa Doc, holds Jimmy at gunpoint and threatens to kill him, but Wink dissuades him. After the group has left Jimmy alone, his mother arrives with enough money to pay to avoid eviction, having won $3,200 at a bingo tournament.\n\nJimmy's best friend and battle host, Future, pushes him to get revenge by competing against the Leaders of the Free World at the next rap battle. Jimmy agrees, but his boss, having noticed improved effort at work, asks Jimmy to do a late-night shift. He agrees, but it conflicts with the battle at the Shelter. Alex unexpectedly visits Jimmy at work. She says goodbye, as she is going to New York, and she is hoping to see Jimmy at the Shelter later. This motivates Jimmy to do the battle. He asks Paul to cover the start of his shift as a favor while Jimmy goes to the battle.\n\nIn all rounds of the rap battle, Jimmy has to compete against one member of the Free World crew. After handily winning the first two rounds against Lickety-Split and Lotto, he faces Papa Doc. Going first, Jimmy pre-empts Papa Doc's potential insults, acknowledging his own \"white trash\" roots and difficult life, while also exposing that Papa Doc, despite posing as a thug, had a comparatively stable and even privileged upbringing. Embarrassed and with nothing to say in rebuttal, Papa Doc hands the microphone back to Future, conceding the battle.\n\nAfter being congratulated by Alex and her friends, Jimmy is offered a position by Future co-hosting battles at the Shelter. Jimmy declines, saying that hosting is Future's thing and he needs to do his own, and leaves alone to return to work.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eminem]] as Jimmy \"B-Rabbit\" Smith Jr.\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Stephanie Smith, Jimmy and Lily's mother\n* [[Mekhi Phifer]] as \"Future\", Jimmy's best friend and the rap battle host\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Alex Latourno, Jimmy's love interest\n* [[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones]] as Bob \"Cheddar Bob\", Jimmy's slow-witted yet loyal friend\n* [[Omar Benson Miller]] as Sol George, Jimmy's friend and Iz's brother\n* [[De'Angelo Wilson]] as \"DJ Iz\", Jimmy's friend and Sol's brother\n* [[Eugene Byrd]] as Wink Harris, a radio DJ\n* [[Taryn Manning]] as Janeane, Jimmy's ex-girlfriend\n* Larry Hudson as Bouncer\n* [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] as \"Lil' Tic\"\n* Mike Bell as Mike \"Shorty Mike\"\n* [[DJ Head]] as Battle DJ\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Greg Buehl, Stephanie's freeloading abusive boyfriend\n* Chloe Greenfield as Lily Smith, Jimmy's sister\n* Mary Hannigan as Mrs. Helgeland\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Clarence \"Papa Doc\", leader of the Free World\n* Gerald L. \"Strike\" Sanders as Lyckety-Splyt, the first rapper Jimmy battles against<ref>{{Cite web|last=NK|date=2019-10-18|title=Eminem Had To Bail Out A Rapper From Jail To Battle With In \"8 Mile\"|url=https://www.eminem.pro/en/bail-out-8-mile.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200827235124/https://www.eminem.pro/en/bail-out-8-mile.html|archive-date=2020-08-27|access-date=2020-08-27|website=Eminem.Pro|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Nashawn \"Ox\" Breedlove as \"Lotto\", the second rapper Jimmy battles against\n* Na'Keya Snoddy as Papa Doc's Girl, member of the Free World\n* Malik Barnhardt as \"Moochie\", member of the Free World\n* Day Golfin as \"Day\", member of the Free World\n* Allen Adams as Omar, member of the Free World\n* Hom as First Parking Lot Rapper\n* [[Obie Trice]] as Second Parking Lot Rapper\n* [[Njeri Earth]] as Third Parking Lot Rapper\n* Jennifer Kitchen as Willing Girl\n* Kyla Womack as Alex's Friend\n* Melissa Zaglanikzny as Christine\n* Rockey Black as Rocky\n* Craig Chandler as Paul, Jimmy's colleague\n* Paul Bates as Manny, Jimmy's foreman at the plant\n* Miz Korona as Vanessa, Female Lunch Truck rapper\n* [[Xzibit]] as Mike, Male Lunch Truck rapper\n* Abdul Salaam El Razzac as Joe Lee Patton\n* Steven Monroe as Plant Worker\n* John Smith, Jr. as Lobby Security Guard\n* Venicia Foreman as [[WJLB]] Receptionist\n* [[King Gordy|Waverly Alford III]] as \"Big O\", male rapper interviewed at the WJLB Radio Station\n* Bushman as WJLB DJ\n* Adam Brook as Roy Darucher\n* [[Brandon T.
