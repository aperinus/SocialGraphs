However, the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] informs McMahon that, because he requested more troops, and such a surge is incompatible with upcoming elections, McMahon's report will not be reviewed until after Afghanistan's [[2009 Afghan presidential election|presidential election]].\n\nCaptain Badi Basim, a member of the [[Afghan National Army]], joins McMahon's staff as a \"representative\" of the Afghan people. He arrives in civilian clothes as he does not wish to wear his uniform, which he has in a bag, because of the risk of being killed. Meanwhile, McMahon is informed that due to massive voter fraud in the recent election, a runoff election will have to be held, further delaying the review of the assessment. Fed up, McMahon secretly leaks the assessment to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and organizes an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', during which he reveals that, in the last 70 days he has only been granted one meeting with President Obama. \n\nIn response, Obama announces that he will send 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, but that all U.S. and coalition forces in the country will leave in 18 months, infuriating McMahon and his staff for telegraphing America's Afghan strategy to the Taliban in Afghanistan. To gather the remaining 10,000 troops needed for his strategy to work, McMahon and his men head to [[Paris]] to negotiate with the other coalition nations.\n\nIn Paris, McMahon learns that the President is in Denmark and wishes to meet with him. The ambassador to Afghanistan warns McMahon that he needs to understand President Obama's position: if McMahon continues to anger the President, he will be fired for insubordination. The President, however, merely shakes McMahon's hand as he climbs aboard [[Air Force One]], supposedly due to time constraints. McMahon and his staff attend a dinner in McMahon's honor, accompanied by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Sean Cullen, who intends to write a feature story about his performance for an upcoming issue. The next day, during their wedding anniversary dinner, McMahon's wife Jeanie confronts him about how much time he's been spending fighting abroad instead of being with his family back home.\n\nWhile en route to [[Berlin]] with McMahon's staff to continue negotiations, Cullen observes their behavior when \"out of country\" and concludes that they are arrogant, seem to care little about the growing public perception that the war is costly and unwinnable, and hold civilian leadership in contempt. At a conference to discuss his strategy, McMahon is confronted by a German official who criticizes the war and McMahon's strategy. Nevertheless, both the Germans and the French agree to furnish the troops needed for McMahon's planned offensive, codenamed \"[[Operation Moshtarak]]\", to proceed, with Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]]'s approval.\n\nThe operation launches, but soon runs into trouble when several civilians are accidentally killed. When McMahon holds a public meeting with locals to apologize for the incident and explain that the U.S. is fighting the war for the benefit of Afghans, the crowd grows hostile and asks McMahon and his troops to leave.\n\nMcMahon later learns that Cullen's article has been published, and realizes it paints a negative picture of him and his staff as openly speaking against the President and mishandling the war effort. The President calls McMahon to Washington. Knowing that he will be fired for his actions, McMahon returns to Washington and later takes a job as a civilian consultant.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cullen ponders the consequences of his article, noting that he wished McMahon's fall would finally convince the government to stop invading foreign countries and end the war in Afghanistan. Instead the government simply assigns a new general to replace McMahon.\n\n== Cast ==\n'''McMahon's Entourage'''\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as General Glen McMahon,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/181296_brad_pitt_looks_like_a_ken_doll_on_the_set_of_upcoming_netflix_drama_war_machine/|first=Zack|last=Seemayer|date=January 31, 2016|title=EXCLUSIVE: Brad Pitt Looks Like a Ken Doll on the Set of Upcoming Netflix Drama 'War Machine' \u2014 See the Pics!|website=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|publisher=[[CBS Television Distribution]]|access-date=May 6, 2017}}</ref> a character based on General [[Stanley A.
