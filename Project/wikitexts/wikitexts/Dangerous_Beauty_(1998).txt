Based on the non-fiction book ''[[The Honest Courtesan]]'' by Margaret Rosenthal, the film is about [[Veronica Franco]], a courtesan in sixteenth-century Venice who becomes a hero to her city, but later becomes the target of an inquisition by the Church for witchcraft. The film features a supporting cast that includes [[Fred Ward]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Moira Kelly]] and [[Jacqueline Bisset]]. The film was released as '''''A Destiny of Her Own''''' in some regions, and was retitled '''''The Honest Courtesan''''' for its UK video release.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Veronica Franco]] is an adventurous, curious, slightly tomboyish young woman in Venice. Her lover Marco, who will be a Senator like his father, cannot marry her because her family is too poor; he marries a foreign noblewoman instead. Veronica's mother plans for her family's financial security, as she still requires dowries for her younger daughters and money for her son's commission. Rather than go to a convent, Veronica's mother suggests she become a [[courtesan]], a highly paid, cultured prostitute like her mother and grandmother before her. At first Veronica is repelled by the idea, but once she discovers that courtesans are allowed access to libraries and education, she tentatively embraces the idea.\n\nVeronica quickly gains a reputation as a top courtesan, impressing the powerful men of Venice with her beauty, wit, and compassion. Marco finds it difficult to adjust to his new wife, who is nothing like Veronica, and becomes jealous as she takes his friends and relatives as lovers. After Marco's cousin Maffio, a poor bard who was once publicly upstaged by Veronica, attacks her, Marco rushes to her aid. They rekindle their romance, but Veronica refuses to stop seeing clients and accept his support. Nevertheless, she spends a great deal of time with Marco, neglecting her business and ignoring her mother's warnings that such a relationship is dangerous for her.\n\nThe [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u201373)|Fourth Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u201373)]] breaks out, and the city appeals to France for aid. Veronica is encouraged to seduce the [[Henry III of France|King of France]] and secures a military alliance. Marco accuses her of enjoying being a courtesan, implying she ought to have rejected the King despite the risk to Venice. Veronica points out that she sacrificed their love for the good of the city, while he only did it to protect his family's political standing, and Marco leaves for war angry. While the Venetians are fighting at sea, a plague hits the city. Religious zealots take the war and plague as punishment for the city's moral degradation, and Veronica's home is quarantined and almost ransacked by a mob.\n\nVeronica is summoned to appear before the [[Inquisition]] on charges of witchcraft and refuses to name her clients. When it appears that she will be executed, Marco publicly shames the Venetian ministers and senators into admitting their own adulteries and sins by standing up in the assembly. Bewildered by the extent of sin in the city, the Inquisitor drops the charges of witchcraft, and Marco and Veronica reconcile.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Catherine McCormack]] as [[Veronica Franco]]\n* [[Rufus Sewell]] as Marco Venier\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Maffio Venier\n* [[Fred Ward]] as Domenico Venier\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Giulia De Lezze\n* [[Moira Kelly]] as Beatrice Venier\n* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as Paola Franco\n* [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as Pietro Venier\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Laura Venier\n* [[Melina Kanakaredes]] as Livia\n* [[Daniel Lapaine]] as Serafino Franco\n* [[Justine Miceli]] as Elena Franco\n* [[Jake Weber]] as King Henry\n* [[Simon Dutton]] as Minister Ramberti\n* Grant Russell as Francesco Martenengo\n* [[Carla Cassola]] as Caterina\n* [[Ralph Riach]] as Lorenzo Gritti\n* [[Tim McMullan]] as Zealot\n* [[Richard O'Callaghan]] as Zealot\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film opened in limited release on 20 February 1998 to mixed but mostly positive reviews, receiving a 69 percent freshness rating on the movie critics website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].
