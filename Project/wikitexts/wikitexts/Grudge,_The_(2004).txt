A [[remake]] of Shimizu's 2002 [[Japanese horror]] film ''[[Ju-On: The Grudge]]'', it stars [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Jason Behr]], [[KaDee Strickland]], [[Clea DuVall]], and [[Bill Pullman]], and is the first installment in [[The Grudge (film series)|''The Grudge'' film series]], which is based on the Japanese [[Ju-On (franchise)|''Ju-On'' films]]. [[Takako Fuji]], Yuya Ozeki, and [[Takashi Matsuyama (actor)|Takashi Matsuyama]] portray the characters [[Kayako Saeki]], [[Toshio Saeki]], and [[Takeo Saeki]] from the original films. The plot is told through a [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinear]] sequence of events and includes several intersecting [[subplot]]s.\n\nAfter the success of American remake ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002), [[Sony Pictures]] had [[green-lit]] an American remake of ''Ju-On: The Grudge''. Shimizu, the writer and director of the original film, was hired to direct the film from a screenplay written by Susco. [[Principal photography]] on the film began on January 26, 2004 and wrapped in July 2004 in [[Tokyo, Japan]].\n\n''The Grudge'' was released in [[North America]] on October 22, 2004, by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film grossed $187 million against a $10 million budget and received mixed reviews from critics, who found it illogical and barely scary. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $39 million, becoming the first horror film since ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1999) to top the Halloween box office and, until the ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' remake in 2009, had the highest grossing opening weekend for a horror remake.\n\nThe film was followed by two sequels, theatrically-released ''[[The Grudge 2]]'' (2006) and straight-to-video ''[[The Grudge 3]]'' (2009). A remake, also entitled ''[[The Grudge (2020 film)|The Grudge]]'' (2020), takes place concurrently with the events of this film and its two sequels.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Grudge'' describes a curse that is born when someone dies in the grip of extreme rage or sorrow, created where the person died. Those who encounter the curse die, and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passing from victim to victim in an endless, growing chain of horror. The following events are explained in their actual order, however, the film is presented in a nonlinear narrative.\n\nIn 2001, [[Kayako Saeki]], a housewife living in suburban Tokyo, is in love with college professor Peter Kirk, obsessively writing about him in a diary. Her husband [[Takeo Saeki|Takeo]] becomes jealous as he discovers the diary and believes that Kayako is having an affair with another man. Takeo brutally murders her, and their young son [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]] for walking in on the murder, and the pet cat Mar in a fit of rage. After Takeo hides the bodies in the house, Kayako's ghost hangs him with her hair.\n\nAfter receiving a letter from Kayako, Peter visits the Saeki house only to find both her and Takeo's corpses along with Toshio's ghost. Shocked and horrified, he flees the scene and commits suicide the next day. The remainder of the Saeki family rise again as [[restless ghosts|ghosts]] due to the curse, notably Kayako, who appears as an ''[[onry\u014d]]''.\n\nIn 2004, the Williams family from America move into the Saeki house. While Matt is thrilled with the house, his wife Jennifer and dementia-ridden mother Emma feel uncomfortable. Matt and Jennifer are quickly consumed by the curse. Yoko, a care worker, arrives at the house to find Emma alone before she encounters Kayako, who drags her up into the attic.\n\nConcerned about Yoko's disappearance, her employer Alex sends another care worker, [[Karen Davis (The Grudge)|Karen Davis]], to take over the care of Emma. At the house, Karen discovers Toshio sealed up in a wardrobe and later on witnesses Kayako's spirit descending from the ceilings to claim Emma.\n\nAlex arrives at the house shortly after and finds Emma dead and Karen in a state of shock. Alex calls the police, with the presence of Detective Nakagawa. In the attic, Nakagawa and his partner Igarashi find Matt and Jennifer's bodies, along with a human's lower jaw. Meanwhile, Matt's sister, Susan, is pursued by Kayako around her office building. At home, Kayako attacks her and she vanishes. While leaving work, Alex is killed by Yoko's jawless corpse.\n \nKayako begins haunting Karen, who informs her boyfriend Doug of the situation. Karen researches the house, eventually confronting Nakagawa, who explains that three of his colleagues investigating the Saeki deaths were all consumed by the curse. That night, Nakagawa carries gasoline into the house in an attempt to burn it down, but is killed by Takeo. After learning that Doug has ventured to the Saeki house to look for her, Karen races there. She finds Doug paralyzed and attempts to flee with him. Kayako crawls down the stairs and latches onto Doug, who dies of shock. As Kayako closes in, Karen sees the gasoline and ignites it.\n\nKaren survives and in the hospital, she learns that the house also survived the fire. Visiting Doug's body, Karen realizes that she is still haunted by Kayako.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Grudge characters}}\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Karen Davis (The Grudge)|Karen Davis]], an exchange student\n* [[Jason Behr]] as Doug McCarthy, Karen's boyfriend, who attends the [[University of Tokyo]] and works at a local Tokyo restaurant as a waiter to make ends meet.\n* [[KaDee Strickland]] as Susan Williams, Matt's younger sister and a businesswoman who he joins in Tokyo along with his wife and mother. \n* [[William Mapother]] as Matthew \"Matt\" Williams, who relocates to Tokyo for a promotion\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Jennifer \"Jen\" Williams, Matt's wife\n* [[Grace Zabriskie]] as Emma Williams, Matt and Susan's mother and Jennifer's mother-in-law who has severe lethargy with [[dementia|mild dementia]].\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Peter Kirk, a college professor working in Tokyo and Kayako's secret love and obsession.\n* [[Rosa Blasi]] as Maria Kirk, Peter's wife\n* [[Ted Raimi]] as Alex Jones, the director of the care center where Yoko and Karen are stationed\n* [[Ryo Ishibashi]] as Det.

That same day, [[Takashi Shimizu]], the director and creator of the original film, was hired to direct the film, with [[Stephen Susco]] writing the screenplay, and [[Sam Raimi]] through its [[Ghost House Pictures]] banner producing the project, alongside [[Robert Tapert]] and Takashige Ichise. Shimizu was eager to work on a remake of his own film, as he saw it as an opportunity to improve and fix some of the perceived problems and flaws that were present in the original film.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\n\n[[Principal photography]] on the film began on January 26, 2004, with reshoots occurring in July 2004 in [[Tokyo, Japan]].
