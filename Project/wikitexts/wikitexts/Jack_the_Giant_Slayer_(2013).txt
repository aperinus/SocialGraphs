The film, based on the British fairy tales \"[[Jack the Giant Killer]]\" and \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]\", stars [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Eleanor Tomlinson]], [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Ian McShane]], [[Bill Nighy]], and [[Ewan McGregor]]. The film tells the story of [[Jack (hero)|Jack]], a young farmhand who must rescue a princess from a race of [[giant]]s after inadvertently opening a gateway to their land in the sky.\n\nDevelopment of ''Jack the Giant Slayer'' began in 2005, when Lemke first pitched the idea. [[D. J. Caruso]] was hired to direct the film in January 2009, but in September of that year, Caruso was replaced by Singer, who hired McQuarrie and Studney to rework the script. The main characters were cast between February and March 2011, and [[principal photography]] began in April 2011 in England with locations in [[Somerset]], [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Norfolk]]. Release of the film was moved back in [[post-production]] to allow more time for special effects and marketing.\n\n''Jack the Giant Slayer'' premiered on February 26, 2013, in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. It was released theatrically in the United States on March 1, 2013, receiving mixed reviews from critics and was a [[Box-office bomb|box office flop]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2022}}<!--- bloated 850 word \"synopsis\" versus 400-700 word norm --->\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\nIn the Kingdom of Cloister, [[Jack (hero)|Jack]], a young farm boy, is fascinated by the legend of Erik, an ancient king who defeated an army of invading [[giant]]s from a realm in the sky by controlling them with a magical crown. At the same time, Princess Isabelle becomes fascinated with the same legend.\n\nTen years later, Jack goes into town to sell his horse to support his uncle's farm. There, Jack spots Isabelle and becomes enamored with her after defending her honor from a group of hooligans. Meanwhile, Lord Roderick returns to his study, only to find that a monk has robbed him. The monk offers Jack some magic beans he stole from Roderick as collateral for Jack's horse. Back at the castle, Isabelle quarrels with her father King Brahmwell as she wants to explore the kingdom, but he wants her to stay and marry Roderick. Likewise, Jack's uncle scolds him for being foolish before throwing the beans on the floor and leaving the house.\n\nDetermined to be free, Isabelle sneaks out of the castle and seeks shelter from the rain in Jack's house. As it rains, one of the beans takes root and grows into a massive beanstalk that carries the house and Isabelle into the sky as Jack falls to the ground.\n\nJack, Roderick, and Roderick's attendant Wicke volunteer to join the king's knights, led by Elmont and his second-in-command, Crawe, and climb the beanstalk in search of Isabelle. As they climb, a lightning storm during the night knocks five knights from the beanstalk, and Roderick and Wicke cut the safety rope, intentionally sending them to fall to their deaths - the two claim the rope snapped. At the top, they discover the giants' realm and decide to split into two groups: one with Jack, Elmont, and Crawe, and the other including Roderick, Wicke, and one of the surviving knights, but not before Roderick hangs back and forcibly takes the remaining beans from Jack, issuing death threats to the boy if he ever tells anybody about the incident (although Jack manages to save one for himself).\n\nJack's group is trapped by a giant, who takes Elmont and Crawe prisoner while Jack, his scent hidden because he has gone underwater, escapes. Meanwhile, Roderick tricks the last knight close to the ledge and pushes him to his death, but then immediately encounters two other giants; one eats Wicke, but before the other can do the same to Roderick, Roderick dons the magical crown.\n\nJack follows the giant to their stronghold, where the two-headed giant leader, Fallon, has devoured Crawe for his defiance. Jack finds Isabelle and Elmont imprisoned there. As the giants prepare to kill their remaining prisoners, Roderick walks in and enslaves the giants with the crown. He tells the giants they will attack Cloister at dawn, also giving them permission to eat Isabelle and Elmont. One of the giants prepares to cook Elmont as a [[Pigs in blankets|pig-in-a-blanket]] and is about to chop Isabelle up when Jack, who is above him, impales his neck with a kitchen knife. The trio makes for the beanstalk, where Jack causes the giant sent to guard the beanstalk to fall off the realm's edge with wild honeybees. Seeing the giant's body, Brahmwell orders the beanstalk cut down to avoid an invasion by the giants, putting the safety of the Earth ahead of the possibility of Isabelle returning home.\n\nJack and Isabelle head down the beanstalk, during which they admit their growing feelings for each other, while Elmont stays to confront Roderick. Elmont kills Roderick, but Fallon takes the crown before Elmont can claim it, and Elmont is forced to escape down the falling beanstalk or be trapped in the giant's realm. Jack, Isabelle, and Elmont all survive the fall after the beanstalk is cut down. As everyone returns home, Jack warns that the giants are using Roderick's beans to create beanstalks to descend down to Earth and attack Cloister.\n\nThe giants chase Jack, Isabelle, and Brahmwell into the castle, where Elmont fills the moat with oil and sets it on fire. Fallon falls into the moat and breaks into the throne room from below. As the siege continues and both sides struggle for control of the drawbridge, Fallon captures Jack and Isabelle, but Jack throws the final bean down Fallon's throat before the giant can eat him, causing a beanstalk to rip apart his body. Jack takes the crown and just as the giants break into the courtyard, he takes control of them and sends the giants back to their realm to cut down the beanstalks themselves.\n\nAfter Brahmwell abolishes the law that the princess can't be with a commoner, Jack and Isabelle marry and tell the story of the giants to their children. As time passes, the magic crown is crafted into [[St Edward's Crown]] and is secured in the [[Tower of London]] while the giants' realm is shown to still exist above [[London]] in the modern day.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- [[WP:NOTDATABASE]] - cast and order per closing tombstone stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Jack (hero)|Jack]]\n* [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] as Isabelle\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Lord Roderick\n* [[Ian McShane]] as King Brahmwell\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as General Fallon\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Elmont\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Crawe\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Wicke\n* [[Ralph Brown]] as General Entin\n* [[John Kassir]] as General Fallon's small head\n* [[Ben Daniels]] as Fumm\n* [[Christopher Fairbank]] as Uncle\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{quote box|align =left|width=33%|quote=It's a very traditional fairytale, probably the most traditional thing I've ever done. But it'll also be a fun twist on the notion of how these tales are told ... Fairytales are often borne of socio-political commentary and translated into stories for children. But what if they were based on something that really happened?.. What if we look back at the story that inspired the story that you read to your kids? That's kind of what this movie's about. |source= \u2014[[Bryan Singer]], director of ''Jack the Giant Slayer'', about the film<ref name=\"Leyland2011\" />}}\n\n=== Development ===\nScreenwriter [[Darren Lemke]] first proposed the idea of contemporizing the \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]\" fairy tale with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] in 2005 before the release of other contemporary films based on fairy tales such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010), ''[[Red Riding Hood (2011 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' (2011) and ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'' (2012).<ref name=\"Sperling2013\" /> Lemke described the script as \"a male-oriented story of a boy becoming a man\" and drew a parallel between [[Jack (hero)|Jack]] and [[Luke Skywalker]] of ''Star Wars''.<ref name=\"Wloszczyna2013\" /> In January 2009, [[New Line Cinema]] hired [[D. J. Caruso]] to direct the script, which was subsequently rewritten by [[Mark Bomback]].<ref name=\"Flemming2009\" /> By August 2009, it was reported that [[Bryan Singer]] might be replacing Caruso; this became official in September 2009.<ref name=\"Boris2009\" /><ref name=\"Rappe2009\" />\n\nIn April 2010, Singer re-teamed with screenwriter [[Christopher McQuarrie]] to rework the screenplay. Singer and McQuarrie had previously collaborated on ''[[Public Access]]'', ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', ''[[Apt Pupil (film)|Apt Pupil]]'', and ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]''.<ref name=\"Susman2010\" /> Singer stated, \"Chris McQuarrie did a significant re-write for me. He brought a different structure. It was very much a page-one situation; a different storyline. It involved the same characters, but some we juggled around and switched around. He just brought a very different perspective\".<ref name=\"IGN2\" /> McQuarrie's re-write included a deeper back story for the giants and explanation of their relationship with the humans, which Singer considered a \"vast improvement\"; it also upped the budget. To get the budget back in line, Singer brought in television writer Dan Studney to work on the project.<ref name=\"Sperling2013\" />\n\nIn May 2010, ''[[ReelzChannel]]'' reported that production of the film would be delayed until February 2011. The report cited Singer's interest in being able to pre-visualize scenes with the digital giants in-camera with the live-action actors (''a la'' [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'') and the need for more time to work out the complex process as reasons for the delay.<ref name=\"Brentjs2010\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn October 2010, New Line gave Bryan Singer the [[green-light]] to begin [[pre-production]] work on ''Jack the Giant Killer'', with production scheduled to begin the following spring.<ref name=\"Flemming2010\" /> In November 2010, Singer began [[screen-test]]ing for the male and female leads. [[Aaron Johnson (actor)|Aaron Johnson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], and [[Aneurin Barnard]] were considered for the role of the young farmhand, and [[Adelaide Kane]], [[Lily Collins]], and [[Juno Temple]] tested for the princess role.<ref name=\"testing\" />\n\nIn December 2010, Singer said, \"I'm very much looking forward to using the [[Red Epic|EPIC Red]] for my next movie ''Jack the Giant Killer'' which will be shot in, what else, [[3D film|3D]]. The camera's incredibly compact size and extraordinary resolution are ideal for the 3D format. But more importantly ''Jack the Giant Killer'' is my first movie set in a time before electricity. The EPIC's extraordinary exposure latitude will allow me to more effectively explore the use of natural light\".<ref name=\"Connelly2010\" />\n\nIn February 2011, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that [[Stanley Tucci]] had been cast as the antagonist, the king's advisor who plans on taking over the kingdom, and [[Bill Nighy]] and [[John Kassir]] were cast as Fallon, the two-headed leader of the giants; Nighy would play the big head and Kassir would play the smaller head.<ref name=\"Tucci\" /> Also in February, Nicholas Hoult was offered the lead role.<ref name=\"Hoult\" /> Singer said he had liked him since ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' and was very supportive of his casting in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.<ref name=\"IGN2\" /> Later that month, [[Ewan McGregor]] joined the cast as the leader of the king's elite guard, who helps fight giants.<ref name=\"McGregor\" />\n\nIn March 2011, [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] was cast opposite Nicholas Hoult as the princess<ref name=\"Tomlinson\" /> and [[Ian McShane]] was cast to play her father, King Brahmwell.<ref name=\"McShane\" /> Two days later, New Line and Warner Bros. announced a release date of June 15, 2012.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on April 12, 2011, in the [[Great Britain|British]] countryside.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 15, 2011 |author1=merrick |title=A Snapshot of Ewan McGregor And Eddie Marsen From Bryan Singer's JACK THE GIANT KILLER!! |url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/49299 |website=[[Aint It Cool News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=28 May 2011 |author=BRENDAN BETTINGER |title=JACK THE GIANT KILLER Official Synopsis |url=https://collider.com/jack-the-giant-killer-synopsis/ |website=Collider }}</ref> In May 2011, production moved to [[Somerset|Somerset, England]] for two weeks with filming scheduled in [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]], [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]] and secret locations in the county including scenes filmed at [[Wells Cathedral]].<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Also in May, scenes were shot at [[Puzzlewood]] in the [[Forest of Dean]] near [[Coleford, Gloucestershire]]. Puzzlewood, which features unusual tree and rock formations, has previously been used for filming of the [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]''. The same forest is said to have inspired [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] to write ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=\"BBC2\" /> Later that month, filming took place at [[Norwich Cathedral]] in [[Norwich|Norwich, Norfolk]].<ref name=\"BBC3\" />\n\nAbout the [[Motion capture|performance-capture]] process Singer stated, \"It's fascinating ... It takes you back to play-acting as a kid in your living room because you are running around and having to imagine that you are in Gantua and imagine that there are these weapons and all these giant things. But there's nothing when you are there other than styrofoam and blocks. It forces the actors to regress to when they would play-act as kids or do minimalist theatre. But in that way it's fascinating - I can see why [[Robert Zemeckis]] and [[James Cameron]] have started to shoot pictures this way\".<ref name=\"IGN2\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\n[[File:Jack the Giant Slayer - Beanstalk.jpg|thumb|The giant beanstalk, before and after it was rendered with computer graphics]]\nIn January 2012, Warner Bros. moved back the release date by nine months, from June 15, 2012, to March 22, 2013. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated: \"Warner can likely afford the move because of [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', which opened in July. And moving the film back gives the studio more time for special effects, as well as a chance to attach trailers for it to [[Peter Jackson]]'s Christmas tentpole ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''\".<ref name=\"McClintock-Kit\" /> In October 2012, Warner Bros. again moved the release date, this time to March 1, 2013, three weeks earlier than the previous date. Warner Bros also changed the title of the film from ''Jack the Giant Killer'' to ''Jack the Giant Slayer''.<ref name=\"Deadline\" />\n\nThe film's special effects were completed by seven different [[visual effects]] houses: [[Digital Domain]], Giant Studios, The Third Floor, MPC, Soho VFX, [[Rodeo FX]] and Hatch Productions.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> Creating the giants took four main steps. The first step was Pre-Capture, in which [[performance capture]] was used to capture the actor's facial and body movements and render them in a real-time virtual environment. The second step took place during principal photography, where Simulcam technology was used to help the human characters virtually interact with the giants that were rendered earlier in Pre-Capture. The third step was Post-Capture, a second performance capture shoot to adjust giants' movements to seamlessly fit the live-action performances. The final step involved putting the finishing touches on the giant's animation, skin, hair and clothing, and composition in the shots.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> Creating the beanstalk involved two main requirements: [[set construction|set extension]] for shots of the actors interacting with the beanstalk, which were shot against a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]], and complete [[Computer graphics|CG]] renderings for shots of the beanstalk growing and extending from Earth into the world of the giants.<ref name=\"fxguide\" />\n\nSinger stated that he had to tone down the special effects to keep the film age-appropriate for children. He said, \"This movie probably has a bigger on-screen body count than any movie I've done before. It's done in a way that's fun, but it was a challenge to get away with that without it becoming upsetting to people ... It was about creating a tone like ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'' that allows you to get away with a lot of stuff because it feels like a movie.\"<ref name=\"Sperling2013\" />\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Jack The Giant Slayer: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[John Ottman]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = February 26, 2013\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Classical music|Classical]]\n| length     = 1:12:51\n| label      = [[WaterTower Music]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe film's soundtrack features music by [[John Ottman]], who also served as an editor and associate producer on the film.
