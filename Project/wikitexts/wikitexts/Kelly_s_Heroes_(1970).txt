Hutton]], about a motley crew of American [[GIs]] who go [[AWOL]] in order to rob a French bank, located behind German lines, of its stored [[Nazi]] gold bars. The film stars [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Telly Savalas]], and co-stars [[Don Rickles]], [[Carroll O'Connor]], and [[Donald Sutherland]] providing the comic absurdity, with secondary, comedic roles by [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[Gavin MacLeod]], [[Karl-Otto Alberty]], and [[Stuart Margolin]]. The screenplay was written by British film and television writer [[Troy Kennedy Martin]]. The film was a US-[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] co-production, filmed mainly in the [[Croatia]]n village of [[Vi\u017einada]] on the [[Istria]] peninsula.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a thunderstorm in early September 1944, units of the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Infantry Division]] are nearing the French town of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]. One of the division's mechanized reconnaissance platoons is ordered to hold their position when the Germans counterattack. The outnumbered platoon is also hit by [[friendly fire]] from their own mortars.\n\nPrivate Kelly, a former lieutenant scapegoated for a failed infantry assault, captures Colonel Dankhopf of [[Wehrmacht]] [[Abwehr|Intelligence]]. Interrogating his prisoner, Kelly notices the officer's briefcase has several gold bars disguised under lead plating. Curious, he gets the colonel drunk and learns that there is a cache of 14,000 gold bars, worth US$16 million (${{Inflation|US|16|1944|r=-1}}&nbsp;million today), stored in a bank vault {{convert|30|mi|km|round=5}} behind German lines in the French town of Clermont. When their position is overrun and the Americans pull back, a [[Tiger I]] tank kills Dankhopf.\n\nKelly decides to steal the gold. He recruits Supply Sergeant \"Crapgame\" in order to obtain the supplies and weapons that will be needed. A spaced-out tank commander known as \"Oddball\" overhears the heist plan and suggests his three unattached [[M4 Sherman]] tanks join the caper. With their commanding officer, Captain Maitland, preoccupied with visiting his uncle \"The General\" (and stealing a yacht), Kelly's platoon are all eager to join Kelly in the heist. After much argument, Kelly finally persuades cynical Master Sergeant \"Big Joe\" to go along.\n\nKelly decides that his infantrymen and Oddball's tanks and crew will proceed separately and meet near Clermont. The Shermans fight their way through the German lines, destroying a railway depot in the process, but the bridge they must cross is blown up by Allied fighter-bombers. Oddball contacts an engineering unit to build a [[Bailey bridge|bridge]] for the crossing, and the engineers in turn bring in even more men to supply support.\n\nAfter losing their jeeps and [[half-track]]s to friendly fire from an American fighter aircraft that mistakes them for Germans, Kelly and his men proceed on foot. They walk into a minefield, and Private Grace is blown up when he steps on a mine. The last two men still trapped in the minefield, PFC Mitchell and Corporal Job, are killed after being forced to engage a German patrol that suddenly arrives before Kelly and Big Joe can kill all the Germans.\n\nOddball links up with Kelly two nights later, bringing with him the extra troops that he has acquired. They battle their way across the river to Clermont. By this time, intercepted radio messages attract the notice of Major General Colt, who misinterprets them as efforts by an aggressive Army unit pushing forward on their own initiative. He immediately rushes to the new front to exploit this \"breakthrough.\"\n\nClermont is defended by three [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tanks of the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS Panzer Division]] and its infantry support. The Americans are able to eliminate the German infantry and two of the Tigers, but the final tank parks itself right in front of the bank after Oddball's last Sherman breaks down, leaving them stalemated. At Crapgame\u2019s suggestion, Kelly, Big Joe, and Oddball approach the Tiger and offer the commander and his crew \"a deal-deal\": equal shares of the gold if the Tiger will shoot the armored doors off the bank.\n\nAfter the Tiger blows the bank doors open, the Germans and Americans divide the spoils, each gold share amounting to US$875,000 (more than $14.3 million today). They go their separate ways, just barely ahead of the still-oblivious General Colt. His way into Clermont has been blocked by the joyous crowd of relieved French residents, who have been deceived by Big Joe into thinking that Colt is French Gen. [[Charles de Gaulle]].\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order and roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as Kelly\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as \"Big Joe\"\n* [[Don Rickles]] as \"Crapgame\"\n* [[Carroll O'Connor]] as General Colt\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as \"Oddball\"\n* [[Gavin MacLeod]] as Moriarty\n* Hal Buckley as Maitland\n* [[Stuart Margolin]] as Little Joe\n* [[Jeff Morris (actor)|Jeff Morris]] as \"Cowboy\"\n* [[Richard Davalos]] as Gutkowski\n* [[Perry Lopez]] as Petuko (often nicknamed on screen as \"Pachuco\").\n* [[Tom Troupe]] as Job\n* [[Harry Dean Stanton]] as Willard (credited as Dean Stanton)\n* Dick Balduzzi as Fisher\n* Gene Collins as Babra\n* [[Len Lesser]] as Bellamy\n* [[David Hurst]] as Colonel Dankhopf (credited on screen as \"Colonel Dummkopf\").\n* Fred Pearlman as Mitchell\n* Michael Clark as Grace\n* George Fargo as Penn\n* [[Dee Pollock]] as \"Jonesy\" Jones\n* [[George Savalas]] as Mulligan\n* John Heller as German Lieutenant\n* Shepherd Sanders as \"Turk\"\n* [[Karl-Otto Alberty|Karl Otto Alberty]] as German Tank Commander\n\n==Production==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Elliott Morgans letter to the Guinness Book of World Records.jpg|alt=Elliott Morgan's letter to the Guinness Book of World Records|thumb|Elliott Morgan's letter to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.

He relied on a true story,<ref>{{Cite web|title=32 things you didn't know about Kelly's Heroes \u2013 Donald Sutherland was ill, expected to die before his wife got to Yugoslavia|last=Dickson|first=Sam|date=31 Dec 2015|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2015/12/31/43655/|access-date=June 21, 2019|archive-date=June 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621044239/https://www.thevintagenews.com/2015/12/31/43655/|url-status=live}}</ref> featured as \"The Greatest Robbery on Record\" in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' from 1956 to 2000. On 4 December 1968, Elliott Morgan, MGM's Head of Research, wrote to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' requesting information on this entry: \"The greatest robbery on record was of the German National Gold Reserves in Bavaria by a combine of U.S. military personnel and German civilians in 1945\". On 10 December the editor, [[Norris McWhirter|Norris D. McWhirter]], wrote back to Morgan, stating that he had very little information and that he essentially suspected that there had been a cover-up, which required that the story should be subject to a \"restricted classification\". He closed by suggesting that until that security classification was changed, \"due to death or eflux ''[sic]'' of time, \"any film made will have to be an historical romance rather than history\".\n\nIn 1975 British researcher [[Ian Sayer]] began a nine-year investigation into the [[Guinness Book of World Records|Guinness]] entry. The results of his investigation, which confirmed a cover up by the U.S. government together with the involvement of U.S. military and former ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' and SS officers in the theft, were published in the 1984 book ''Nazi Gold&nbsp;\u2014 The Sensational Story of the World's Greatest Robbery&nbsp;\u2014 and the Greatest Criminal Cover-Up''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065938/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=IMDb 'Kelly's Heroes' Trivia|access-date=May 22, 2019|archive-date=January 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128081933/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065938/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|url-status=live}}</ref> The investigation finally led to two of the missing gold bars (valued in 2019 at over $1 million) being handed over by German officials to the U.S. government in a secret ceremony at Bonn on 27 September 1996. The bullion was transported to the [[Bank of England]] where it was held to the account of the [[Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold]] (TCRMG). The first disclosure that the Bank was holding the two bars (complete with Nazi markings) came from a press release issued by the bank on 8 May 1997 which confirmed that the two bars were those that had been identified as missing in the book ''Nazi Gold''. Sayer had given information to the [[United States Department of State]] concerning the two bars (amongst other things) in July 1978. In 1983 they finally agreed to investigate using Sayer's evidence. The State Department investigation did not conclude until 1997. On 11 December 1997 Sayer was invited, by the Secretary General of the TCRMG, to view the two bars in the gold bullion vaults of the Bank of England. In addition to being accorded this rare honour, he was also photographed holding the bars, which he had been instrumental in tracking down.\n\n===Filming===\nThe project was announced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in November 1968 under the title of ''The Warriors''.<ref>{{cite news|title=MGM Will Begin Nine Films in '69|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=30 Nov 1968|page= a5}}</ref> Filming commenced in July 1969 and was completed in December.<ref name=\"Hughes194\"/> The film was made and released during a time of great financial difficulties for MGM, in the early days of the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer#Kirk Kerkorian investment|turbulent ownership by Kirk Kerkorian]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Operating Loss of $l.9 Million Posted by MGM: Despite 2nd Period Deficit, Firm Earned $4.9 Million During 1st Half of Fiscal '70 Filming Costs Charged Off|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=22 April 1970|page= 5}}</ref> It was shot on location in the [[Istria]]n village of [[Vi\u017einada]] in [[Croatia]], in the ruins of the [[Beo\u010din]] palace in [[Serbia]], in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and finally in [[London]].<ref name=\"McGilligan183\">McGilligan (1999), p. 183</ref> One of the reasons for the selection of Yugoslavia as the main location was that, in 1969, it was one of the few nations whose army were still equipped with operating World War II mechanized equipment, both German and American, including in particular the [[M4 Sherman]] tank.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://graphics.latimes.com/towergraphic-tank-movies/ |title=From 'Patton' to 'Fury,' tank films that roll |first=Susan |last=King |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 10, 2014 |access-date=July 17, 2019 |archive-date=September 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911033206/http://graphics.latimes.com/towergraphic-tank-movies/ |url-status=live }}</ref> This simplified the film's logistics tremendously.<ref>[[Ben Mankiewicz]] introduction to ''Kelly's Heroes'', [[Turner Classic Movies]], 25 May 2015.</ref>\n\nDuring pre-production, [[George Kennedy]] turned down the role of Big Joe, despite an offered fee of $300,000, because he did not like the role.<ref>{{cite news|title='Cool Hand Luke' Gave Kennedy a Fair Shake: George Kennedy|last=Knapp|first= Dan|newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date=23 Nov 1969|page= c1}}</ref> The original script included a female role which was removed just before filming began.

The U.S. Sherman tanks were the [[M4 Sherman variants|M4A3E4 variant]]. Kelly's platoon also drove an [[M3 Gun Motor Carriage]] before it was destroyed on the hill, as well as several half-tracks. The Germans also drove a [[Volkswagen K\u00fcbelwagen|K\u00fcbelwagen]].\n\nKelly's men were armed with a mix of [[M1919 Browning machine gun|.30 caliber machine guns]], [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifles]], and [[Thompson submachine gun]]s, with few carbines and no [[M-1 rifle]]s. Gutkowski, the unit's sniper, was armed with a Soviet [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] M91/30 rifle. The German soldiers were armed almost exclusively with [[MP 40]] submachine guns.\n\nThe U.S. plane that attacked Kelly's group was a Yugoslavian [[Soko 522]] with a U.S. Army air force roundels.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nMGM cut approximately 20 minutes from the film before its theatrical release. Eastwood said later in interviews that he was very disappointed about the re-cut by MGM because he felt that many of the deleted scenes not only gave depth to the characters, but also made the movie much better.<ref>Conversations With Clint: Paul Nelson's Lost Interviews With Clint Eastwood, Pages 51 - 54</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinteastwood.org/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=17208a57971e1de0995b4d5f987f72c1&topic=3284.msg48301#msg48301 |title=Kelly's Heroes - cut scenes? |publisher=Clinteastwood.org |access-date=2016-11-06 |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104039/http://www.clinteastwood.org/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=17208a57971e1de0995b4d5f987f72c1&topic=3284.msg48301#msg48301 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some of the deleted scenes were shown on promotional stills and described in interviews with cast and crew for Cinema Retro's special edition article about ''Kelly's Heroes'':<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/5864-CINEMA-RETROS-KELLYS-HEROES-ISSUE-NOW-SHIPPING-WORLDWIDE!.html |title=Cinema Retro's \"Kelly's Heroes\" Movie Classics Special Edition Still a Top-seller! - Celebrating Films of the 1960s & 1970s |publisher=Cinemaretro.com |access-date=2016-11-06 |archive-date=January 26, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126103750/https://cinemaretro.com/index.php?%2Farchives%2F5864-CINEMA-RETROS-KELLYS-HEROES-ISSUE-NOW-SHIPPING-WORLDWIDE%21.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Oddball and his crew pack up to go across the lines to meet up with Kelly and others while local village girls are running around half naked.\n* The platoon encounters a group of German soldiers and naked girls swimming in a pool.\n* While they wait for Oddball in the barn at night, Kelly and Big Joe talk about their disillusionment with the war and why Kelly was made a scapegoat for the attack that resulted in his demotion.
