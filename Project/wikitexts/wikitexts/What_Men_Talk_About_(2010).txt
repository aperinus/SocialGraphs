Of course, women. But also about work, money, cars, football ... but in general about women. And if they have two days when they escape from their offices and families, to get away from all the cares and commitments \u2013 two days, eventful and adventurous \u2013 you can be sure that this time they will have time to discuss a lot of things ... And More. From these conversations \u2013 we know for sure \u2013 many women learn about themselves a lot of new things. \nFour friends are going to go to [[Odessa]] for the concert of a famous Russian band [[Bi-2]]. Two of them, Alexey and Sasha, have problems in the morning: one can not deal with things around the house, the other \u2013 cannot get rid of the annoying customers at work. When, finally, they join their other friends who already left, Camille and Slava, they begin to talk about all sorts of things. Thus, the first day on the road passes. They spend the night in a hotel village \u2018Beldyazhki\u2019. \nThe next day, the heroes continue to talk about life, passing through Kyiv, where they buy paintings by Tishchenko and at the same time discussing modern art. By the end of the movie 4 men get into a car accident, but still make it in time for the concert. \n\"What Men Talk About\" \u2013 this is the third, and by far, the best film of the cult theater \"Quartet\". Four middle-aged friends receive an invitation from their friend in Odessa to come to him for his birthday, and at the same time attend a concert of a famous Russian group \"B-2\". Each of them, like all of us, has a difficulty with time. One has work, the second \u2013 has his wife and children, the third \u2013 has both work and family, but still, with great a difficulty, they manage to escape for a few days. They sit in the car and go to the long journey. On the road, they have many adventures, many of which can knock a person out of a rut. But when you have people next to you with whom you can talk about everything, all the hardships of life become insignificant ... And real men are known to have a lot of different topics for discussion. Work, parties, money, music, clubs, and of course \u2013 women. If a man is still single, he is concerned about the issue \u2013 whether to get married. And married ones concern whether they can cheat on their wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Leonid Baratz]] \u2013 Lyosha\n*[[Aleksandr Demidov]] \u2013 Sasha\n*[[Kamil Larin]] \u2013 Kamil\n*Rostislav Khait  \u2013 Slava\n*[[Nonna Grishayeva]] \u2013 Slava's imaginary wife\n*[[Yelena Podkaminskaya]] \u2013 Nastya, Lyosha's wife\n*Veronica Amirkhanova \u2013 Lisa, Lyosha's eldest daughter\n*Valeria Usable \u2013 Eva, Lyosha's youngest daughter\n*Natalia Sigova \u2013 Grandma 1\n*Valentina Zubchenko \u2013 Grandma 2\n*Maria Bondarenko \u2013 Grandma 3\n*Maksim Vitorgan \u2013 Romeo\n*Yulia Pyznar \u2013 Juliet\n*[[Fyodor Dobronravov]] \u2013 a man who is in love with a sausage\n*[[Sergei Nikonenko]] \u2013 the captain of the ship\n*Maksim Nikitin \u2013 captain's assistant\n* [[Nina Ruslanova]] \u2013  hotel administrator\n* [[Jeanna Friske]], [[Andrey Makarevich]], [[Oleg Menshikov]], [[Vasily Utkin]],  [[Bi-2]] \u2013 cameo\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Music==\nThe soundtrack to ''What men talk about''\n<ref>http://rollingstone.ru/articles/8708 Rolling Stone \u2116 69, \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c 2010 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430</ref>\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| title1          = Scandal\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2          = River of Love\n| length2         = 4:08\n| title3          = Eternal ghostly counter\" \n| length3         = 5:11\n| title4          = Fair Bride\n| length4         = 5:27\n| title5          = Black Day\n| length5         = 3:44\n| title6          = Hit home\n| length6         = 7:34\n| title7          = When we become snow\n| length7         = 4:24\n| title8          = Faun Dj\n| length8         = 4:15\n| title9          = Her eyes (from William Shakespeare)\" \n| length9         = 4:52\n| title10         = Falling Snow\n| length10        = 4:04\n| title11         = Tango\n| length11        = 3:38\n| title12         = Fair Ska\n| length12        = 5:34\n| title13         = David Bowie\n| length13        = 4:55\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe Russian premiere took place on March 4, 2010.
