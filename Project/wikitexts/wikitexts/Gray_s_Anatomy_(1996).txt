The title is taken from the classic human anatomy textbook, ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', originally written by [[Henry Gray]] in 1858. It was shot in ten days in late January 1996<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/gray-s-anatomy-3-1200446852/|title=Gray's Anatomy|first1=Todd|last1=McCarthy|date=16 September 1996}}</ref> during a break Soderbergh had from post-production on his previous film, ''[[Schizopolis]]''.\n\nThe monologist film is about Spalding Gray, the main character, who is diagnosed with a rare ocular condition called [[Epiretinal membrane|macular pucker]]. After hearing all of his options, such as [[Christian Science]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[sweat lodge]]s, and the \"Elvis Presley of [[Psychic surgery|psychic surgeons]]\", and the dangers of what surgery could bring, he decides to go through the other forms of medicine provided. This in turn takes him on a journey around the world and steers him away from surgery more so because of religious reasons, often in a dramatic and humorous fashion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptsnob.com/2011/12/soderbergh-marathon-grays-anatomy-1996.html?m=1|title=Public Transportation Snob: Soderbergh Marathon: ''Gray's Anatomy'' (1996)|author=Dan|publisher=PTSnob.com|access-date=25 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis was the fourth and last of Gray's theatrically released monologue films, following ''[[Swimming to Cambodia]]'', ''[[Monster in a Box]]'', and ''[[Spalding Gray: Terrors of Pleasure|Terrors of Pleasure]]''.\n\nThe film is available on [[DVD]]. A remastered version was released by [[The Criterion Collection]] on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in June 2012.<ref>[http://www.criterion.com/films/28351-gray-s-anatomy \"''Gray's Anatomy'' (1997) \u2013 The Criterion Collection\"].

Gray's style as an actor was influenced by Allen Ginsberg, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, and the American Autobiographical movement. He mostly worked in experimental theater. In 1977, he co-founded the Wooster Theater Group in New York City. Two years later he performed his first monologue: ''Sex and Death at the Age of 14''. In the '80s Gray traveled to Thailand where he won two Independent Spirit Awards for the film ''[[Swimming to Cambodia]]''. He appeared in several independent films in the '90s before ''Gray's Anatomy'' was published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mubi.com/cast_members/16653|title=Spalding Gray|work=MUBI|access-date=25 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nJanet Maslin of the [[New York Times]] gave a positive review, calling it \"''A chatty, colorful, nicely sardonic account of how a crisis led Mr. Gray to assess his medical state, consider his mortality and take one more funny, self-dramatizing look at the eccentric world around him''.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grays_anatomy/reviews/?type=top_critics|title=Gray's Anatomy - Movie Reviews - Rotten Tomatoes|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}</ref>\n\nDesson Thomson of [[the Washington Post]] also reviewed the film positively, stating \"''Gray's Anatomy finds Spalding Gray turning a bout with a bizarre ocular condition into a dizzying, absorbing odyssey of the neurotic mind.''\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Digital Fix described ''Gray's Anatomy'' as \"very witty and a pleasure to listen to. As he passes fifty, Gray starts to worry about his own death before he finds the sight in his left eye is becoming distorted.
