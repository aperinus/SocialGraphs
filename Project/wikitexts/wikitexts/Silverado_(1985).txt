It stars [[Kevin Kline]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Danny Glover]] and [[Kevin Costner]].  The supporting cast features [[Brian Dennehy]], [[Rosanna Arquette]], [[John Cleese]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Lynne Whitfield]], and [[Linda Hunt]].\n\nThe film was produced by [[Columbia Pictures]] and Delphi III Productions, and distributed to theatres by Columbia, and by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment for home media. The original soundtrack, with a score composed by [[Bruce Broughton]], was released by [[Geffen Records]]. On November 12, 2005, an expanded two-disc version of the score was released by the [[Intrada Records]] label.\n\n''Silverado'' premiered in the United States on July 10, 1985. Through an 11-week run, the film was shown at 1,190 theaters at its widest release, and grossed $32,192,570 at the box office. Generally met with positive critical reviews, it was nominated for Best Sound and Best Original Score at the [[58th Academy Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nA cowboy named Emmett is ambushed by three armed men while he sleeps in an isolated shack and kills them. On a journey towards the frontier town of Silverado, he detours to another town called Turley to meet his brother, Jake. Along the way, Emmett finds a half-naked man, Paden, lying in the desert after being robbed and left to die. Paden chooses to travel with Emmett to Turley.\n\nArriving in town, Paden notices the man who stole his horse and saddle and buys a cheap gun to kill him. Soldiers attempt to arrest Paden until he shows that his name was on the saddle. The story is backed up by Cobb, an old friend of Paden's, who also loans him money to buy new clothes. Cobb wants to give Paden a job in Silverado, but he declines. The men run into a homesteader named Hobart, who mistakes them for two men named Baxter and Holly. The real Baxter and Holly show up to guide Hobart and his fellow settlers to Silverado. Later at a nearby saloon, Emmett and Paden witness a black cowboy, Mal, being harassed by several men and the racist saloon owner. Mal beats the men until Sheriff John Langston shows up and orders him to leave town.\n\nPaden and Emmett are questioned by Langston and learn that Jake is set to be hanged for murder. Paden learns Emmett intends to break his brother out of jail and decides to leave. That night, Paden kills another man to get back his hat and guns, and Langston throws him in jail along with Jake. The next morning, Emmett sets fire to the town gallows while Jake and Paden break out of jail. The three men escape, pursued by Langston and his posse. Mal ambushes them, revealing himself to be a crack shot, and the lawmen abandon their pursuit. Mal reveals he is also headed to Silverado to visit his elderly parents after quitting his job as a butcher in [[Chicago]].\n\nThe four soon encounter Hobart's wagon train. He reveals that Baxter and Holly betrayed them and ran off with their money box. Jake stays behind while the others, accompanied by a man named Conrad, retrieve the money from a gang of outlaws; Conrad is killed by a sharpshooter. With the money returned, Mal parts ways and leaves them while Emmett and Jake reunite with their sister and her family. It's revealed that Emmett spent five years in prison for killing a rancher named McKendrick after their families feuded over land rights. At the same time, Mal discovers his father, Ezra, living destitute in the hills and his ranch burned down; McKendrick's son Ethan seized their land and Mal's mother died of sickness. In town, Paden visits the saloon and meets the manager, Stella. Cobb, who turns out to be the owner, hires him as the new [[pit boss]] after revealing that he is also Silverado's sheriff.\n\nEmmett discovers that Ethan hired the gunmen who tried to murder him. Mal also learns his sister Rae is now the mistress of notorious gambler Calvin \"Slick\" Stanhope. Stanhope betrays Mal, who gets beaten by Cobb's deputies and put in jail. McKendrick's men murder Ezra, assault Emmett, burn his brother-in-law's land office, and kidnap Jake and Emmett's young nephew Augie. Stella, who knows Cobb is in Ethan's pocket, reveals to Paden that she despises what the two men have done to Silverado and urges him to make things right. Rae breaks her brother out but gets wounded in the process. The four men attack Ethan's ranch, kill most of his men, and rescue Jake and Augie while Ethan flees back to town. The group splits up: Jake outsmarts and kills Cobb's right-hand man Tyree, Mal rescues Rae from Stanhope and stabs him to death with his own knife, Emmett deals with the remaining corrupt deputies and guides his horse to kick Ethan in the head, breaking his neck, and Paden faces off with Cobb in a duel, outdrawing and killing him.\n\nAfter saying their goodbyes, Emmett and Jake are accompanied to the edge of town to say goodbye to their sister and her family before departing for [[California]], their long-stated goal. Mal and his sister reconcile and decide to rebuild their family's homestead. Meanwhile, Paden has found his true calling as the new sheriff of Silverado.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Kevin Kline]] as Paden\n* [[Scott Glenn]] as Emmett\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Jake\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Malachi \"Mal\" Johnson\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as Sheriff Cobb\n* [[Rosanna Arquette]] as Hannah\n* [[John Cleese]] as Sheriff John Langston\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as Calvin \"Slick\" Stanhope\n* [[Linda Hunt]] as Stella\n* [[Joe Seneca]] as Ezra Johnson\n* [[Ray Baker (actor)|Ray Baker]] as Ethan McKendrick\n* [[Thomas Wilson Brown]] as August \"Augie\" Hollis\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as Tyree\n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] as Rae Johnson\n* [[Amanda Wyss]] as Phoebe\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Kelly\n* [[Brion James]] as Hobart (uncredited)\n* [[James Gammon]] as Dawson\n* [[Sheb Wooley]] as Cavalry Sergeant\n* [[Earl Hindman]] as J.T.
