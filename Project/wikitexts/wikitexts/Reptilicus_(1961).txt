The original was filmed using the native Danish language and the second was filmed using the English language. Each version of the film featured the same actors, with the exception of Bodil Miller, who was replaced by actress Marla Behrens since the Danish actress could not speak English. However, the English version of the film was heavily edited, including altering footage to show Reptilicus vomiting acid venom, and the actors' voices dubbed over by [[American International Pictures]] for its release in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Reptilicus 1961 \u2013 Trivia \u2013 IMDb\">{{cite web |title=Reptilicus (1961) \u2013 Trivia \u2013 IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056405/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv |website=IMDb.com |publisher=IMDb.com |access-date=25 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nDanish [[miner]] Svend Viltorft digs up a section of a giant reptile's tail from the frozen grounds in [[S\u00e1pmi (area)|Lapland]], where he and other miners are drilling.  The section is flown to the [[Denmark's Aquarium]] in [[Copenhagen]], where it is preserved in a cold room for scientific study. But due to careless mishandling, the room is left open and the section begins to thaw, only for scientists to find that it is starting to regenerate.\n\nProfessor Otto Martens, who is in charge of the aquarium, dubs the reptilian species \"Reptilicus\" (upon a reporter's suggestion) and compares its [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] abilities to that of other animals like [[starfish]].\n\nOnce fully regenerated from the tail section, Reptilicus goes on an unstoppable rampage from the Danish countryside to the panic-stricken streets of Copenhagen (including one of its famous landmarks, [[Langebro]] Bridge). The monster is finally rendered unconscious by a sedative developed by ingenious scientists and shot into its mouth from a [[bazooka]] fired by Gen. Grayson.\n\nHowever, the film is left open-ended. A final shot shows one of Reptilicus' legs, which had been blown off earlier by the [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish Navy's]] depth charges, sitting on the sea floor, raising the possibility that it could regenerate into a new Reptilicus.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Carl Ottosen]] as General Mark Grayson\n* [[Ann Smyrner]] as Lise Martens\n* [[Mimi Heinrich]] as Karen Martens\n* [[Asbj\u00f8rn Andersen]] as Professor Otto Martens\n* Bodil Miller as Connie Miller (Danish version)\n* Marla Behrens as Connie Miller (American version)\n* [[Bent Mejding]] as Svend Viltorft\n* [[Povl W\u00f8ldike]] as Dr. Peter Dalby\n* [[Dirch Passer]] as Peterson\n* Ole Wisborg as Captain Brandt\n\n== Production ==\nThe original Danish-language version was directed by Danish director [[Poul Bang]] and released in Denmark on February 25, 1961.\n\nIn July, 1960 the American version started production.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Filmland Events|newspaper= The Los Angeles Times|location= Los Angeles, California|date= July 20, 1960}}</ref> This version was filmed in English with a nearly identical cast and was directed by the film's American producer-director [[Sidney W. Pink]]. Initially, this version was deemed virtually unreleasable by [[American International Pictures]] and had to be extensively reworked by the film's Danish-American screenwriter, [[Ib Melchior]], before being finally released in America in 1962. Pink was angry at the changes and wound up in a legal dispute with AIP.<ref name=\"AIP\" /> After Pink and others viewed the English-language version, however, the lawsuit was dropped.<ref name=\"White2013\">{{cite book |first=Mike |last=White |title=Cinema Detours |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jm0wBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA135 |year=2013 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-1-300-98117-6 |pages=135\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Praised Danish animators===\nPink returned to Hollywood praising Danish animation, saying \"Danish miniature work has surpassed that of Japan, up to generally acknowledged to be the finest in the world.
