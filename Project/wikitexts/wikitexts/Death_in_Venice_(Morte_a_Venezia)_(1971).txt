It stars [[Dirk Bogarde]] as Gustav von Aschenbach and [[Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen]] as Tadzio, with supporting roles played by [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]], [[Marisa Berenson]] and [[Silvana Mangano]]. It was filmed in [[Technicolor]] by [[Pasqualino De Santis]], with a soundtrack featuring classical composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Modest Mussorgsky]]. It is the second part of Visconti's thematic \"German Trilogy\"\u2014preceded by ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]'' (1969) and followed by ''[[Ludwig (film)|Ludwig]]'' (1973).\n\nThe film premiered in [[London]] on 1 March 1971, and was entered into the [[1971 Cannes Film Festival]]. It received positive reviews from critics and won several accolades, including [[BAFTA Awards]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]]. It was nominated for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for Dirk Bogarde. Visconti won the [[David di Donatello for Best Director]].\n\nIn 2012, ''Death in Venice'' was ranked the 235th greatest film of all time in the ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics' poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b0ce272/sightandsoundpoll2012|title=Votes for MORTE A VENEZIA (1971)|work=BFI|access-date=29 March 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the film was ranked the 14th greatest art house film of all time by ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/death-venice-arthouse|title=Death in Venice: No 14 best arthouse film of all time|work=The Guardian|date=20 October 2010|access-date=29 March 2022}}</ref> In 2016, it was ranked the 27th greatest ''[[LGBT]]'' film of all time in the [[British Film Institute]] poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/30-best-lgbt-films-all-time|title=The 30 Best LGBTQ+ Films of All Time|work=BFI|date=15 March 2016|access-date=29 March 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAt the turn of the century, composer Gustav von Aschenbach travels to [[Venice]] for rest, due to serious health concerns. In Venice, he becomes obsessed with the stunning beauty of an adolescent [[Poles|Polish]] boy named Tadzio, who is staying with his family at the same [[Grand H\u00f4tel des Bains]] on the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] as Aschenbach.\n\nWhile Aschenbach attempts to find peace and quiet, the rest of the city is gripped by a [[cholera]] epidemic. City authorities do not inform the holiday-makers of the problem, for fear that they will abandon Venice and leave; however, Aschenbach himself is dying from heart disease. Aschenbach suddenly decides to depart from Venice, but his trunk has left the train station without him. In a moment of impulse, he decides to stay longer, waiting until his trunk has been returned; in fact, he is happy to return to the Grand H\u00f4tel des Bains. Aschenbach continues to observe Tadzio whenever possible, even following him and his family through the narrow streets of Venice. Aschenbach soon realizes that something is seriously wrong, as a disinfectant wash is being applied to public places within the city. Later, when Aschenbach questions the hotel manager about it, the manager downplays the epidemic as nothing of concern.\n\nLater, rejuvenated by the continuing presence of Tadzio &ndash; though they never actually converse &ndash; he visits a barber who, in his words, \".....will restore what belongs to you immediately\", dyeing his grey hair black and whitening his face and reddening his lips to try to make him look younger. As he leaves the barber's shop the barber exclaims: \"And now the signore may fall in love as soon as he pleases\". Once again, Aschenbach follows Tadzio and his family through the tiny streets of Venice, gazing at Tadzio from afar, the latter becoming more aware that he is being gazed upon. Later that evening, Aschenbach dreams that he is conducting a work of his which is received with jeers and boos from an angry crowd.\n\nIn the climactic scene, Aschenbach sees Tadzio being beaten up on the beach by an older boy. When released, Tadzio walks away from him alone towards the horizon. He suddenly turns back to look at Aschenbach, then turns away to face the sun, and stretches his arm out towards it. Aschenbach too, stretches his hand as if to reach Tadzio, and at that very moment\u2014heightened by the crescendo in Mahler's ''[[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|Adagietto]]''\u2014he dies from a heart attack. A few people notice him collapsed on his chair and alert the hotel staff. They carry Aschenbach's body away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Dirk Bogarde]] as Gustav von Aschenbach\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen]] as Thaddeus \"Tadzio\"\n* [[Marisa Berenson]] as Frau von Aschenbach\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] as Alfred\n* [[Silvana Mangano]] as Tadzio's mother\n* [[Romolo Valli]] as the hotel manager\n* [[Nora Ricci]] as the governess\n* [[Leslie French]] as the travel agent\n* [[Franco Fabrizi]] as the barber\n* [[Carole Andr\u00e9]] as Esmeralda\n* {{ill|Sergio Garfagnoli|it}} as Jasiu\n* Luigi Battaglia as Scapegrace\n* Ciro Cristofoletti as the hotel clerk\n* [[Dominique Darel]] as an English tourist\n* [[Mascia Predit]] as a Russian tourist\n* [[Nicoletta Elmi]] as the redheaded girl\n* [[Marco Tulli]] as the fainting man\n}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nWhile the character Aschenbach in the novella is an author, Visconti changed his profession from writer to composer. This allows the musical score, in particular the [[Adagietto (Mahler)|Adagietto]] from the [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|Fifth Symphony]] by [[Gustav Mahler]], which opens and closes the film, and sections from Mahler's [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]], to represent Aschenbach's writing. Apart from this change, the film is relatively faithful to the book, but with added scenes where Aschenbach and a musician friend debate the degraded [[aesthetics]] of his music.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Visconti-andresen4.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right: [[Luchino Visconti]], Sergio Garfagnoli, [[Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen|Bj\u00f6rn Andresen]]]]\nIn the second volume of his autobiography, ''Snakes and Ladders'', Bogarde recounts how the film crew created his character's deathly white skin for the final scenes of the film, just as he dies. The makeup department tried various face paints and creams, none of which were satisfactory, as they smeared. When a suitable cream was found and the scenes were shot, Bogarde recalls that his face began to burn terribly. The tube of cream was found and written on the side was \"Keep away from eyes and skin\": the director had ignored this and had been testing it out, as small patches, on various members of the film crew, before finally having it applied to Bogarde's face.\n\nIn another volume of his memoirs, ''An Orderly Man'', Dirk Bogarde relates that, after the finished film was screened for them by Visconti in Los Angeles, the Warner Bros. executives wanted to write off the project, fearing it would be banned in the United States for obscenity because of its subject matter. They eventually relented when a gala premiere of ''Death in Venice'' was organized in London, with [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] attending, to gather funds for the sinking Italian city.\n\n=== Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen ===\nIn 2003, Andr\u00e9sen gave an interview to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in which he expressed his dislike of the fame ''Death in Venice'' brought him and how he sought to distance himself from the objectifying image he acquired from playing Tadzio.<ref>{{cite news |last=Seaton |first=Matt |date=2003-10-16 |title='I feel used': Bjorn Andresen \u2013 the beautiful Tadzio from Death in Venice, tells Matt Seaton why he is furious about being on the cover of Germaine Greer's new book |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/oct/16/gender.film |access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref> He stated that he now disapproves of the film's subject matter: \"Adult love for adolescents is something that I am against in principle. Emotionally perhaps, and intellectually, I am disturbed by it \u2013 because I have some insight into what this kind of love is about.\" He also recounted attending the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival: \"I was just 16 and Visconti and the team took me to a gay nightclub. Almost all the crew were gay. The waiters at the club made me feel very uncomfortable. They looked at me uncompromisingly as if I was a nice meaty dish...it was the first of many such encounters.\"\n\nIn 2021, Juno Films released ''[[The Most Beautiful Boy in the World]]'', a tell-all documentary in which Andr\u00e9sen recollects the years of [[Child grooming|predatory]] and [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] behavior he received from the cast, crew, and fans of the film.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Erbland |first=Kate |date=2021-01-29 |title='The Most Beautiful Boy in the World' Review: A Crushing Story of Innocence Destroyed by Stardom |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2021/01/the-most-beautiful-boy-in-the-world-review-bjorn-andresen-1234611909/ |access-date=2021-06-11 |website=[[IndieWire]]}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}\nThe film's score was performed by the Orchestra dell'Accademia de Santa Cecilia, conducted by [[Franco Mannino]], and subsequently released by [[EMI]]. In addition to the music of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s Third and Fifth Symphonies, which embodied the character and suffering of Aschenbach, Visconti included a number of pieces from other composers. Although overshadowed as they are by the dominance of Mahler, they play an important part in the film's narrative. One is the ballad by Armando Gil, sung by the strolling player, ''Chi con le donne vole aver fortuna'' (He who wants to be successful with the ladies). Another is [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s famous piano piece \"[[F\u00fcr Elise]]\", played by Claudio Gizzi. The third, which is particularly evocative, is [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s \"Lullaby\", which, in the film, heralds Ashenbach's death. It is sung by [[Mascia Predit]], an unforgettable soprano whom Visconti was happily surprised to discover among the extras when filming the last scene.\n\n* Hush, hush-a-bye, my little grandchild\n* Sleep in slumber deep, little peasant's son\n* Hush, hush-a-bye; our forefathers never saw such a misfortune\n* But misfortune has come, disaster upon disaster, . . .\n* Hush, hush, hush-a-bye!\n* Your small white body lies there in the cradle\n* Your soul flies in the heavens\n* Your quiet slumber is guarded by God himself\n* By your side stand bright angels\n* Bright angels!\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Luchino Visconti's ''Death in Venice'' is one of his emptier meditations on beauty, but fans of the director will find his knack for sumptuous visuals remains intact.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1005512_death_in_venice|title=Death in Venice (1971)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=27 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n[[Derek Malcolm]], in his 1971 review for [[The Guardian]] wrote, \"It is a very slow, precise, and beautiful film, ... an immensely formidable achievement, engrossing in spite of any doubts.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/04/death-in-venice-review-slow-precise-beautiful-film-1971|title=Death in Venice: 'a slow, precise, and beautiful film' \u2013 archive, 1971|work=The Guardian|date=4 March 1971|access-date=29 March 2022}}</ref>\n\nFilm historian [[Lawrence J. Quirk]] wrote in his study ''The Great Romantic Films'' (1974): \"Some shots of Bj\u00f6rn Andr\u00e9sen, the Tadzio of the film, could be extracted from the frame and hung on the walls of the [[Louvre]] or the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in Rome.\" He says Andr\u00e9sen did not represent just a pretty youngster as an object of perverted lust, but that novelist Mann and director-screenwriter Visconti intended him as a symbol of beauty in the realm of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' or [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', the beauty that moved [[Dante]] to \"seek ultimate aesthetic [[catharsis]] in the distant figure of [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]].\"{{sfn|Quirk|1974|p=[https://archive.org/details/greatromanticfil00quir/page/208/mode/2up 208]}}\n\nIn
