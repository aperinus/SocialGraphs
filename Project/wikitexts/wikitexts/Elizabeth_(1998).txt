It stars [[Cate Blanchett]] in the title role of [[Elizabeth I of England]], with [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Christopher Eccleston]], [[Joseph Fiennes]], [[John Gielgud]], and [[Richard Attenborough]] in supporting roles. The film is based on the early years of Elizabeth's reign, where she is elevated to the throne after the death of her half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], who had imprisoned her. As she establishes herself on the throne, she faces plots and threats to take her down.\n\n''Elizabeth'' premiered at the [[55th Venice International Film Festival]] on 8 September 1998 and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 23 October. The film became a critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Kapur's direction, costume design, production values and most notably Blanchett's titular performance, bringing her to international recognition, while the film grossed $82 million against its $30 million budget.\n\nThe film received three nominations at the [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], including for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], with Blanchett winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress]]. It received twelve nominations at the [[52nd British Academy Film Awards]], winning five awards, including [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Outstanding British Film]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress]] (for Blanchett). At the [[71st Academy Awards]], it received seven nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Blanchett), winning [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]]. In 2007, Blanchett and Rush reprised their roles in Kapur's follow-up film ''[[Elizabeth: The Golden Age]]'', which covers the later part of Elizabeth's reign.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1558, [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] ([[Kathy Burke]]) dies from a [[uterine cancer|cancerous tumour in her womb]]. Mary's heir and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] ([[Cate Blanchett]]), under house arrest for conspiracy charges, is freed and crowned the Queen of England.\n\nAs briefed by her adviser [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] ([[Richard Attenborough]]), Elizabeth inherits a distressed England besieged by debts, crumbling infrastructure, hostile neighbours, and treasonous nobles within her administration, chief among them the [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]). Cecil advises Elizabeth to marry, produce an heir, and secure her rule. Unimpressed with her suitors, Elizabeth delays her decision and continues her secret affair with [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Lord Robert Dudley]] ([[Joseph Fiennes]]). Cecil appoints [[Francis Walsingham]] ([[Geoffrey Rush]]), a Protestant exile returned from France, to act as Elizabeth's bodyguard and adviser.\n\n[[Mary of Guise]] ([[Fanny Ardant]]) lands an additional 4,000 French troops in neighbouring [[Scotland]]. Unfamiliar with military strategy and browbeaten by Norfolk at the war council, Elizabeth orders a military response, which proves disastrous when the professional French soldiers defeat the inexperienced, ill-trained English forces. Walsingham tells Elizabeth that Catholic lords and priests intentionally deprived Elizabeth's army of proper soldiers and used their defeat to argue for Elizabeth's removal. Realising the depth of the conspiracy against her and her dwindling options, Elizabeth accepts Mary of Guise's conditions to consider marrying her nephew [[Henry III of France|Henry of France]].\n\nTo stabilize her rule and heal England's religious divisions, Elizabeth proposes the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Act of Uniformity]], which unites English Christians under the [[Church of England]] and severs their connection to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. In response to the Act's passage, the Vatican sends a [[John Ballard (Jesuit)|priest]] to England to aid Norfolk and his cohorts in their growing plot to overthrow Elizabeth. Unaware of the plot, Elizabeth meets Henry of France but ignores his advances in favour of Lord Robert. William Cecil confronts Elizabeth over her indecisiveness about marrying and reveals Lord Robert is married to another woman. Elizabeth rejects Henry's marriage proposal when she discovers he is a [[cross-dressing|cross-dresser]] and confronts Lord Robert about his secrets, fracturing their idyllic affair and banishing him from her private residence.\n\nElizabeth survives an assassination attempt, whose evidence implicates Mary of Guise. Elizabeth sends Walsingham to meet with Mary secretly in Scotland, under the guise of once again planning to marry Henry. Instead, Walsingham assassinates Guise, inciting French enmity against Elizabeth. When William Cecil asks her to solidify relations with the Spanish, Elizabeth dismisses him from her service, choosing instead to follow her own counsel.\n\nWalsingham warns of another plot to kill Elizabeth spearheaded by the priest from [[Rome]] carrying letters of conspiracy. Under Elizabeth's orders, Walsingham apprehends the priest, who divulges the names of the conspirators and a Vatican agreement to elevate Norfolk to the English crown if he weds [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Walsingham arrests Norfolk and executes him and every conspirator except Lord Robert. Elizabeth grants Lord Robert his life as a reminder to herself how close she came to danger.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the divine, Elizabeth cuts her hair and models her appearance after the [[Virgin Mary]]. Proclaiming herself married to England, she ascends the throne as \"the Virgin Queen\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]]\n* [[Geoffrey Rush]] as [[Francis Walsingham]]\n* [[Joseph Fiennes]] as [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]]\n* [[Richard Attenborough]] as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]]\n* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]]\n* [[Kathy Burke]] as [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]]\n* [[Fanny Ardant]] as [[Mary of Guise]]\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]]\n* [[Eric Cantona]] as [[Paul de Foix]]\n* [[Emily Mortimer]] as [[Kat Ashley]]\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as [[Lettice Knollys|Isabel Knollys]]\n* [[John Gielgud]] as [[Pope Pius V]]\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[John Ballard (Jesuit)|John Ballard]]\n* [[James Frain]] as [[\u00c1lvaro de la Quadra]]\n* [[Edward Hardwicke]] as [[Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel]]\n* [[Jamie Foreman]] as [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex|Earl of Sussex]]\n* [[Terence Rigby]] as [[Stephen Gardiner|Bishop Stephen Gardiner]]\n* [[Angus Deayton]] as [[Armagil Waad]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]\n* [[Amanda Ryan]] as Lettice Howard\n* [[Kenny Doughty]] as Sir Thomas Elyot\n* George Yiasoumi as [[King Philip II of Spain]]\n* [[Wayne Sleep]] as Dance Tutor\n* [[Alfie Allen]] as Arundel's Son\n* [[Lily Allen]] as Lady-in-waiting\n* [[Valerie Gale]] as Mary's Lady-in-waiting\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe costuming and shot composition of the coronation scene are based on Elizabeth's coronation portrait.[[File:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This portrait \"The Coronation of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]\" was used as the basis for the photography and [[costume]] of [[Cate Blanchett]] during the [[coronation]] scene in the film.

However, plans changed when Kapur noted that many on set would probably be concerned that Brando would be sharing the set with them for two days. Later, when Gielgud had taken the role, Kapur at one point suggested (in vain) that the Pope's accent should be Italian; he added that every British actor within earshot was horrified that any director was asking Sir John Gielgud to speak in an accent that \"wasn't John Gielgud\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nA large proportion of the indoor filming, representing the royal palace, was conducted in various corners of [[Durham Cathedral]]\u2014its unique nave pillars are clearly identifiable.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elizabeth Film Locations |url=https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/e/Elizabeth.php |website=Movie-Locations |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Film & TV Locations |url=https://www.thisisdurham.com/inspire-me/durhams-top-10s/top-10-film-and-tv-locations |website=This Is Durham |access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n''Elizabeth'' received some criticism for factual liberties it takes and for its distortion of the historical timeline to present events which occurred in the middle to later part of Elizabeth's reign as occurring at the beginning.<ref name=\"Levin\"/><ref name=\"Carlson\">{{cite journal| title=Teaching and Technology: Teaching Elizabeth Tudor with Movies: Film, Historical Thinking, and the Classroom| author=Eric Josef Carlson| journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal| year=2007| volume=38| issue=2| pages=419\u2013428| doi=10.2307/20478367|jstor = 20478367}}</ref> In his entry for Elizabeth I in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Patrick Collinson]] described the film \"as if the known facts of the reign, plus many hitherto unknown, were shaken up like pieces of a jigsaw and scattered on the table at random.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/><ref>{{cite news| title=Elizabeth I (1553\u20131603)| author=Patrick Collinson| publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography| page=76}}</ref> Carole Levin, reviewing the film in 1999 for ''[[American Historical Association|Perspectives on History]]'', criticized the movie for portraying Elizabeth as \"a very weak and flighty character who often showed terrible judgment\", in contrast to historical descriptions of her as a strong, decisive, and intelligent ruler. In particular, Levin scrutinized the movie's portrayal of Elizabeth as dependent on Walsingham, in addition to the completely inaccurate portrayal of her relationship with Robert Dudley, as being instances in the film where the character appears weak and overpowered by the men around her.<ref name=\"Levin\">{{cite news| url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/april-1999/elizabeth-romantic-film-heroine-or-sixteenth-century-queen| title=Elizabeth: Romantic Film Heroine or Sixteenth-Century Queen?| author=Carole Levin| publisher=Perspectives on History| date=1 April 1999| access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThere are inaccuracies in the timeline of events prior to her accession. The film depicts [[Mary I of England]] as being pregnant prior to Elizabeth's imprisonment. In actuality, Elizabeth was imprisoned on 18 March 1554 and released in May; it was not announced that the Queen was believed to be pregnant until September of that same year.\n\nElizabeth was put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace, not Hatfield House, but did not remain there until her sister's death. On 17 April 1555, she was summoned to Hampton Court to be with Mary during the Queen's delivery. When the Queen did not deliver, Elizabeth remained at court through 18 October 1555 until after it had become apparent that Mary was not pregnant and after the Queen's husband [[Philip II of Spain]] had gone abroad. It was only after this time that Elizabeth was finally able to return to Hatfield.\n\n[[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester]] is wrongly depicted as having been a co-conspirator in the plot against Elizabeth. In fact, he remained one of Elizabeth's closest friends until his death in 1588, long after their romantic relationship had ended. The movie portrays Elizabeth as being ignorant of the fact that Dudley is married; it is her discovery of this fact that contributes to the breakdown of their relationship. In reality, Elizabeth was fully aware of Dudley's marriage to his first wife, [[Amy Robsart]], who lived in isolation in the country suffering from breast cancer. Robsart died from a fall down the stairs in 1560, two years into Elizabeth's reign, a fact never mentioned in the film.<ref name=\"Levin\"/> He never converted to Catholicism either, remaining a staunch Protestant and Puritan all his life.\n\nIn the film, England is forced to send young and untrained soldiers, including children, to fight in Scotland against the French Queen Regent, [[Mary of Guise]], who is said to be plotting to invade England, because the Catholic bishops spoke in the pulpits against raising a professional army. In truth, Mary of Guise was not planning on invading England, but was crushing a Protestant revolt amongst the Scots. Elizabeth had also had all the English Catholic bishops thrown in prison before the conflict even began, and the English actually did send professional soldiers to fight in Scotland. They were defeated in battle not because they were untrained children sabotaged by traitorous Catholic clergy, but because they were simply outfought by the French.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\n[[Mary of Guise]] was not assassinated by Walsingham, but died naturally from [[edema]] on 11 June 1560.<ref>CSP Scotland, vol. i (1898), 389 and CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol. ii (1865), 604, 29 April 1560.</ref>\n\n[[William Cecil, Baron Burghley]] was portrayed by the 75-year-old [[Richard Attenborough]] in the film, but the real Lord Burghley was only 37 years old when Elizabeth was crowned, thirteen years older than she.<ref name=\"Tunzelmann\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/sep/21/reel-history-elizabeth| title=Elizabeth I rules over time and space| author=Alex von Tunzelmann| newspaper=The Guardian| date=21 September 2011| access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> Likewise she never compelled him to retire, as is depicted in the film. He remained her chief advisor and was [[Lord High Treasurer]] from 1572 until his death in 1598.<ref name=\"Carlson\"/> Similarly, the film depicts Cecil being given the title Lord Burghley before the Northern Rising of 1569. In fact, he was given this title two years after this in 1571.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe film portrays [[Kat Ashley]], head lady-in-waiting to the Queen, as being the same age as Elizabeth, but in reality, at the time of the then-25-year-old Elizabeth's coronation, Ashley was around 57, and she died six years later in 1565.\n\n[[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]] was not a cold and calculating power-hungry mastermind, but a gullible co-conspirator in a couple of assassination plots.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}The first was the Northern Uprising, which alone was enough to get him jailed for nine months in the Tower of London, before Elizabeth released him to house arrest. The second, the [[Ridolfi plot]], was a plot to assassinate Elizabeth, place [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] on the English throne, and have her marry Norfolk. Norfolk was beheaded for his role in this plot as he had been bankrolling the conspirators.\n\nBishop [[Stephen Gardiner]] died in 1555, before Elizabeth came to the throne and thus cannot possibly have been involved in the Ridolfi plot. The Earl of Arundel was not executed for his role, but was instead imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he died as a political prisoner, and the Earl of Sussex was actually a loyal supporter of Elizabeth who would not have tried to overthrow her.\n\nJohn Ballard is introduced beating the young Sir Thomas Elyot to death with a rock, an event that cannot have occurred because Elyot died before Elizabeth even came to the throne, at the age of 55 or 56. Ballard was not in England to assassinate Elizabeth, although he did initiate the [[Babington plot]] to overthrow her (the movie treats both this and the separate [[Ridolfi plot]] as one scheme). He also had the cover story of being a soldier and well-dressed swashbuckler, while the movie portrays him as merely a drab, humourless fanatic. His death\u2014he was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] alive, along with some of the other conspirators in the Babington plot\u2014was also so shocking and brutal to witnesses that Elizabeth forbade that method being used again.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n\nAlthough the idea of marriage to [[Henry, Duke of Anjou]] (who was actually not Mary's nephew but the son of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]) was briefly entertained, Elizabeth never actually met him, and moreover there is no evidence that he was a cross-dresser, as depicted in the film. Further, the movie portrays the courtship as occurring at the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, when in fact it occurred in 1570, twelve years into her rule. The film also glosses over the considerable real-life age difference between the Queen and Henry (in 1570 she was 37 years-old and he 19).<ref name=\"Tunzelmann\"/> It was Henry's younger brother [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]], 22 years younger than Elizabeth, who seriously pursued the English queen beginning in 1578, when she was 45 years old and he was 23.\n\nAt the end of the film, Elizabeth is shown as having decided against marriage. In fact, she entertained the idea of marriage with several European monarchs well into middle age. Candidates included her former brother-in-law, [[Philip II of Spain]]; [[Charles II, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Charles of Austria]]; [[Eric XIV of Sweden]]; [[Adolphus, Duke of Holstein]]; and the [[House of Valois|Valois]] princes [[Francis II of France|Francis]] and [[Henry III of France|Henry]] (later King Henry III of France and Poland).<ref>\"The Tudor Age 1480\u20131603\" Guy, John.
