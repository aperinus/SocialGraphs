Set in early 20th-century [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the film centers on [[Tevye]], played by [[Chaim Topol|Topol]], a poor Jewish milkman who is faced with the challenge of marrying off his five daughters amidst the growing tension in his [[shtetl]]. The cast also features [[Norma Crane]], [[Leonard Frey]], [[Molly Picon]], [[Paul Mann]], [[Rosalind Harris]], [[Michele Marsh (actress)|Mich\u00e8le Marsh]], [[Neva Small]] and [[Paul Michael Glaser]]. The musical score, composed by [[Jerry Bock]] with lyrics by [[Sheldon Harnick]], was adapted and conducted by [[John Williams]].\n\nFilmed at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England and on-location in [[Yugoslavia]], ''Fiddler on the Roof'' was theatrically released on November 3, 1971, by [[United Artists]] to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Jewison's direction, the screenplay, and the performances of the cast, while the film grossed $83.3&nbsp;million worldwide on a $9&nbsp;million budget, becoming the [[1971 in film|highest-grossing film of 1971]]. \n\nThe film received a leading eight nominations at the [[44th Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and won three: [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score Adaptation]] (Williams), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Oswald Morris]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]] ([[Gordon K. McCallum]], [[David Hildyard]]).<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/25/obituaries/leonard-frey-actor-dies-at-49-was-in-fiddler-and-other-films.html| title=Leonard Frey, actor, Dies at 49; Was in 'Fiddler' and Other Films| first=Mel| last=Gussow| date=August 25, 1988| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| url-access=subscription| access-date=February 7, 2017| archive-date=May 6, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506050100/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/25/obituaries/leonard-frey-actor-dies-at-49-was-in-fiddler-and-other-films.html| url-status=live}}</ref> The film also won two [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globes]]: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] for Topol\n\n==Plot==\nThe film's plot largely follows that of [[Fiddler on the Roof|the musical]] from which it is adapted.\n\n===Act 1===\nIn 1905, Tevye, a poor Jewish [[Milk delivery|milkman]] living in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka, a typical [[shtetl]] in the [[Pale of Settlement]] of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], compares the lives of the Jews of Anatevka to a fiddler on the roof (who appears throughout the film in this metaphorical role), using tradition to \"scratch out a pleasant, simple tune\" without breaking their necks.\n\nIn town, Tevye meets Perchik, a radical [[Marxism|Marxist]] from [[Kyiv|Kiev]], who admonishes those for talking but doing nothing about news of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] banishing Jews from their villages. Tevye invites Perchik to stay with his family, offering him room and board in exchange for him tutoring his daughters.\n\nTevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel, to marry Lazar Wolf, a wealthy widowed butcher much older than she is. Tzeitel loves her childhood sweetheart, the poor tailor Motel Kamzoil, and frantically begs her father not to make her marry Lazar. Although initially angry, Tevye realizes Tzeitel loves Motel and, upon seeing that Motel is equally devoted to Tzeitel, and impressed with his maturity and work ethic (\u201cYour daughter will not starve\u201d) yields to his daughter's wishes.\n\nTo convince his wife Golde that Tzeitel should not marry Lazar, Tevye claims to have had a nightmare. He says that Golde's deceased grandmother told him Tzeitel is supposed to marry Motel, and that Lazar's late wife, Fruma-Sarah, threatened to kill Tzeitel if the two marry, along with Tevye and Golde. Golde concludes the dream was a message from their ancestors, and Tzeitel and Motel arrange to be married.\n\nMeanwhile, Tevye's second daughter, Hodel, falls in love with Perchik. They argue over the story of [[Leah]] and the place of old religious traditions in a changing world. The two dance together, which is considered forbidden by Orthodox Jewish tradition. Perchik tells Hodel that they just changed an old tradition.\n\nAt Tzeitel and Motel's wedding, an argument breaks out after Lazar presents the newlyweds with gifts. When Tevye tries to speak to Lazar about the Torah, Lazar refuses to listen, arguing that the wedding should have been his all along. Minutes later, another argument breaks out over whether a girl should be able to choose her own husband. Perchik addresses the crowd and says that, since they love each other, it should be left for the couple to decide. He creates further controversy by asking Hodel to dance with him.\n\nThe crowd gradually warms to the idea and Tevye and Golde, then Motel and Tzeitel, join in dancing. The wedding proceeds with great joy. Suddenly, the military presence in the town, along with the constable, arrive and begin a [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogrom]], the \"demonstration\" which he had earlier warned Tevye was coming. The constable stops the attack on the wedding celebration after Perchik is wounded in the scuffle with the Tsarist troops; however, he allows the men to continue destroying property in the village. Tevye and the immediate family stand still, until Tevye angrily orders them to clean up instead of standing around. Tevye silently asks why God allowed this to happen to them.\n\n===Intermission===\nIn its original [[theatrical release]], the film was shown with an intermission and [[entr'acte|entr'acte music]].<ref name=afi>{{cite web| title=Fiddler on the Roof (1971)| url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=54251| publisher=AFI Catalog of Feature Films| access-date=29 April 2018| archive-date=September 5, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905203426/http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=54251| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Act 2===\nMonths later, Perchik prepares to leave Anatevka for the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolution]]. He proposes to Hodel, and she accepts. When they tell Tevye, he is furious that they have decided to marry without his permission, but he again relents because they love each other. Tevye tells Golde his reasons for consenting to their daughter's marriage, which leads them to re-evaluate their own arranged marriage. Tevye and Golde ultimately realize that, despite having been paired by a matchmaker, and never having met before their wedding, they do love each other.\n\nWeeks later, Perchik is arrested in [[Kyiv|Kiev]] and is [[Katorga|exiled to Siberia]]. Hodel decides to join him there. She promises Tevye that she and Perchik will be married under a [[Chuppah|canopy]]. Meanwhile, Tzeitel and Motel become parents, and the latter finally buys the sewing machine for which he has long scrimped and saved.\n\nTevye's third daughter Chava falls in love with a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Christian named Fyedka. Tevye tells Chava to be distant friends with Fyedka, because of the difference in their religions. When Chava eventually works up the courage to ask Tevye's permission to marry Fyedka, Tevye tells her that marrying outside the family's faith is against tradition. He forbids her from having any contact with Fyedka or from even mentioning his name. The next morning, Fyedka and Chava elope and are married in a Russian Orthodox church.\n\nGolde learns of the marriage when she meets up with the priest. When a grief-stricken Golde tells Tevye about the marriage, he tells her that Chava is dead to the family and that they shall forget her altogether. Chava asks Tevye to accept her marriage. In a [[soliloquy]], Tevye concludes that he cannot accept Chava [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|marrying a non-Jew]]. He accuses her of abandoning the Jewish faith and [[Disownment|disowns]] her.\n\nOne winter day, the Jews of Anatevka are notified that they have three days to [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|leave the village or be forced out]] by the government. Tevye, his family and friends begin packing up to leave, heading for various parts of [[Europe]], Israel and the [[United States]].\n\nYente, the [[Shadchan|Matchmaker]], plans to emigrate to [[Jerusalem]], and says goodbye to Golde with an embrace before departing. Lazar plans to emigrate to [[Chicago]], to live with his former brother-in-law, whom he detests, but \"a relative is a relative\". Lazar and Tevye share one last embrace before departing.\n\nTevye receives letters from Hodel mentioning that she is working hard while Perchik stays in the Siberian prison. It is hoped that when Perchik is released, they will join the others in the United States. Chava and her husband Fyedka come to Tevye's house and tell the family that they are leaving for [[Krak\u00f3w]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], being unable to stay in a place that would force innocent people out. Tevye shows signs of forgiving Chava by murmuring under his breath \"And God be with you\", silently urging Tzeitel to repeat his words to Chava. Golde calls out to Chava and Fyedka, telling them they will be living in [[New York City|New York]] with a relative.\n\nThe Constable silently watches as the mass evacuation of Anatevka takes place. The community forms their circle at a crossroad one last time before scattering in different directions. Tevye spots the fiddler and motions to him to come along, symbolizing that even though he must leave his town, his traditions will always be with him.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Chaim Topol|Topol]] as [[Tevye]], the milkman of Anatevka\n* [[Norma Crane]] as Golde, his wife\n* [[Rosalind Harris]] as Tzeitel, the oldest daughter\n* [[Michele Marsh (actress)|Michele Marsh]] as Hodel, the second daughter\n* [[Neva Small]] as Chava, the third daughter\n* [[Molly Picon]] as Yente, the [[shadchan|matchmaker]]\n* [[Paul Mann]] as Lazar Wolf, the butcher, Tzeitel's older suitor\n* [[Leonard Frey]] as Motel Kamzoil, the tailor, Tzeitel's eventual husband\n* [[Paul Michael Glaser]]{{efn|Credited as 'Michael Glaser'.}} as Perchik, the [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary, Hodel's eventual husband\n* [[Ray Lovelock (actor)|Ray Lovelock]]{{efn|Credited as 'Raymond Lovelock'.}} as Fyedka, a Christian farmer, Chava's eventual husband\n* Elaine Edwards as Shprintze, the fourth daughter\n* Candy Bonstein as Bielke, the fifth daughter\n* Shimen Rushkin as Mordcha\n* [[Zvee Scooler]] as Rabbi\n* [[Louis Zorich]] as Constable\n* [[Alfie Scopp]] as Avram\n* [[Howard Goorney]] as Nachum\n* [[Barry Dennen]] as Mendel\n* [[Ruth Madoc]] as Fruma-Sarah, the butcher's late wife\n* [[Patience Collier]] as Grandmother Tzeitel\n* [[Arnold Diamond]] as Moishe\n* [[Marika Rivera]] as Rifka\n* [[Aharon Ipal\u00e9]] as Sheftel\n* [[Roger Lloyd-Pack]] as Sexton\n* [[Carl Jaffe]] as Isaac\n* [[Vernon Dobtcheff]] as Russian official\n* [[Tutte Lemkow]] as the fiddler<ref name=\"afi\" />\n}}\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n# \"[[Tradition (song)|Prologue / Tradition]]\" \u2013 Tevye and Company\n# \"[[Overture]]\"\n# \"[[Matchmaker, Matchmaker]]\" \u2013 Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze and Bielke \n# \"[[If I Were a Rich Man (song)|If I Were a Rich Man]]\" \u2013 Tevye \n# \"Sabbath Prayer\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde and Chorus\n# \"[[To Life (song)|To Life]]\" \u2013 Tevye, Lazar Wolf, Townsmen and Cossacks \n# \"Tevye's Monologue (Tzeitel and Motel)\" \u2013 Tevye\n# \"Miracle of Miracles\" \u2013 Motel\n# \"Tevye's Dream\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde, Grandmother Tzeitel, Rabbi, Fruma-Sarah and Ghostly chorus\n# \"[[Sunrise, Sunset]]\" \u2013 Tevye, Golde, Perchik, Hodel and Guests\n# \"Wedding Celebration / The Bottle Dance\"\n# \"[[Entr'acte]]\" \u2013 Orchestra\n# \"Tradition\" (Reprise) \u2013 Chorus\n# \"Tevye's Monologue (Hodel and Perchik)\" \u2013 Tevye\n# \"[[Do You Love Me?

The film's soundtrack release notably contained some of these omissions, indicating they were removed from the film during the editing process. These include Golde blessing herself before going back to sleep.\n\nChanges were also made in the song \"Tradition\", with the film omitting the dialogue between Reb Nachum the beggar (who, in the film, seems unable to speak, at least clearly) and Lazar Wolf as well as dialogue spoken by Yente and Avram. In addition, in the film, two men argue about whether a horse claimed to be six years old was actually twelve, rather than whether the horse was actually a mule. The LP film soundtrack retained their names, Yitzhak and Avram, however this was also omitted in the film's release. Instead, an on-set, improvised take of Topol (saying \"he sold him\"), rather than the recorded dubbing, was used.\n\nSeven additional scenes were added to the film:\n# The Constable gets orders from his superior for a \"demonstration\" against the Jews (referred to by the superior as \"Christ-killers\") in Anatevka.\n# Perchik is arrested at a workers' rally in Kiev.\n# Golde goes to the priest to look for Chava (described by her in the stage production). She is confronted there with Christian images (of historically Jewish individuals) in a juxtaposition with the synagogue montage at the start of the film.\n# Motel gets dressed for his upcoming wedding to Tzeitel.\n# The rabbi and his students inside the synagogue receive news of the arrival of Motel's new sewing machine.\n# The rabbi takes the Torah out of the ark inside the synagogue for the last time. He weeps and chants quietly about having to abandon the synagogue.\n# Tevye feeds his animals in the barn for the final time. He tells his lame horse to take care of his leg and to treat his new owner and master well.\n\nThe scene with Hodel and Perchik, where he plans to leave to start a revolution, was extended in the film. A new song sung by Perchik was recorded (\"Any Day Now\"), but was omitted from the final print; however, it was included in the 2004 reissue of the soundtrack. The song was later implemented in the 2018 Yiddish production as a song sung by Perchik to Shprintze and Bielke. When the film was re-released to theaters in 1979, 32 minutes were cut, including the songs \"Far from the Home I Love\" and \"Anatevka\".\n\nIn the film, Tevye and Lazar Wolf discuss Wolf's proposed marriage to Tzeitel in Wolf's home, then go to the tavern for a celebration drink. In the stage version, the two meet directly in the tavern. The film shows Wolf's home as filled with golden artifacts. Prior to Lazar Wolf entering the scene, Tevye speaks to a female servant, who tells him not to touch anything.\n\nAlthough a faithful adaptation of the original stage version, ''Fiddler'' scholar [[Jan Lisa Huttner]] has noted several differences between stage and screen.<ref name=\"Huttner\" /><ref>{{cite web |date=September 11, 2014 |title=My Kinda Town |url=http://ff2media.com/secondcitytzivi/2014/09/11/my-kinda-town/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045329/http://ff2media.com/secondcitytzivi/2014/09/11/my-kinda-town/ |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |access-date=September 7, 2015 |publisher=Second Avenue Tzivi}}</ref> She argues that changes in American culture and politics and developments in Israel led the filmmakers to portray certain characters differently and to offer a different version of Anatevka.<ref name=\"Huttner\" /> For example, the Broadway production cast [[Bea Arthur]] as a tall, booming Yente, while the film portrays Yente as tiny and timid. Huttner also notes that the \"[[Marc Chagall|Chagall]] color palette\" of the original Broadway production was exchanged for a grittier, more realistic depiction of the village of Anatevka.<ref name=\"Huttner\" />\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] was done at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England. Most of the exterior shots were done in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]\u2014specifically in [[Mala Gorica, Sisak-Moslavina County|Mala Gorica]], [[Lekenik]], and [[Zagreb]] within the Yugoslav constituent republic of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]. Though the area was under heavy snow during location scouting in 1969, during the filming the producers had to ship in marble dust to stand in for snow.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=ix}} Additional scenes were shot at the [[Jadran Film]] studios.<ref name=\"afi\" /> 300 extras conversant in various foreign languages were used, as were flocks of geese and pigs and their handlers.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|pp=ix, 124}} [[Isaac Stern]] performed the [[violin]] solos.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=ix}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe decision to cast Topol, instead of [[Zero Mostel]], as Tevye was a somewhat controversial one, as the role had originated with Mostel and he had made it famous. Years later, Jewison said he felt Mostel's larger-than-life personality, while fine on stage, would cause film audiences to see him as Mostel, rather than the character of Tevye.{{sfn|Bial|2005|pp=78\u201379}} Before Topol was cast, [[Orson Welles]], [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Marlon Brando]] were all considered.\n\n[[Rosalind Harris]], who played Tzeitel, was previously [[Bette Midler]]'s understudy in the role during the original Broadway production.<ref name=\"afi\" />\n\n[[Assi Dayan]], a well-known Israeli actor and filmmaker, was originally cast as Perchik, but couldn't handle the English dialogue and was replaced by [[Paul Michael Glaser]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Film director, actor Assi Dayan dead at 68 |url=https://www.jpost.com/arts-and-culture/arts/film-director-actor-assi-dayan-dead-at-68-350990 |access-date=2022-09-22 |website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com |language=en-US}}</ref> [[Rob Reiner]] auditioned for the role of Motel.<ref>{{Cite web |last=noah |date=2014-06-09 |title=6 Things About \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019 on 50th Anniversary |url=https://forward.com/schmooze/199570/6-things-about-fiddler-on-the-roof-on-50th-anniver/ |access-date=2022-09-22 |website=The Forward |language=en}}</ref> [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] was Jewison's choice to play Fyedka, but ultimately Italian actor [[Ray Lovelock (actor)|Ray Lovelock]] was cast in the part.

Williams also composed additional music and an original cadenza for [[Isaac Stern]]. The score was orchestrated by Williams and [[Alexander Courage]].\n\n==Release==\n===Roadshow presentation===\nBecause the film follows the stage musical so closely, and the musical did not have an [[overture]], the filmmakers chose to eliminate the customary film overture played before the beginning of most motion pictures shown in a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]]-style presentation. However, there is a [[Solo (music)|solo]] by the Fiddler played over the opening credits (after the conclusion of \"Tradition\"), an [[intermission]] featuring [[entr'acte]] music, and exit music played at the end after the closing credits.\n\n===Reception===\nThe film was a success, earning [[United Artists]] profits of $6.1&nbsp;million, plus distribution profits of $8&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"tino\">Tino Balio, ''United Artists: The Company That Changed the Film Industry'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1987, p. 194.</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an 83% rating based on 41 reviews, with an average of 7.80/10.

This was the first time the \"First Act Finale\" and \"Entr'acte\" were featured on CD. This release also included the previously unreleased \"Wedding Procession\" track. It also featured the demo of \"Any Day Now\", a song that was cut from the final film.\n\nOn December 7, 2021, La-La Land Records released a 3-disc limited edition soundtrack which featured alternate versions of songs, as well as unreleased instrumental score composed by Williams.\n\nIn February 2022, the [[University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance|University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre, & Dance]] presented a concert version of ''Fiddler'' using the arrangements written by John Williams for the film.
