It begins with [[Agony in the Garden|the Agony]] in the [[Garden of Olives]] (i.e., Gethsemane), continues with the betrayal of [[Judas Iscariot]], the brutal [[Scourging at the Pillar]], the suffering of Mary as prophesied by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion and death of Jesus]], and ends with a brief depiction of his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. However, the film also depicts flashbacks to particular moments in Jesus' life, some of which are biblically based, such as [[The Last Supper]] and [[The Sermon on the Mount]], and others that are artistic license, as when Mary comforts Jesus and when Jesus crafts a table.\n\nThe film was mostly shot in [[Italy]].<ref>[https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/Passion-Of-The-Christ.php. \"The Passion of the Christ\".] ''Movie-Locations''</ref> The dialogue is entirely in [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]], and reconstructed [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Aramaic]]. Although Gibson was initially against it, the film is subtitled.\n\nThe film was controversial and received polarized reviews, with some critics calling the film a religious and holy experience, while others found it [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]] and criticized the violence as extreme. The film grossed over $612 million worldwide<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Passion of the Christ|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0335345/|access-date=2020-11-04|website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> and became the [[2004 in film|fifth highest-grossing film of 2004]] internationally at the end of its theatrical run.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It is the highest-grossing (inflation unadjusted) [[Christian film industry|Christian film]] and independent film of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=christian.htm|title=Christian Movies at the Box Office|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Barker |first=Stephen |date=2020-10-17 |title=The 10 Highest-Grossing Independent Films Of All Time |url=https://screenrant.com/highest-grossing-independent-films-ever-indie-movies/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref> It received three nominations at the [[77th Academy Awards]] in 2005, for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Gibson|first=Mel|title=The Passion of the Christ|date=February 25, 2004|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335345/awards?ref_=tt_awd|access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Gethsemane]], [[Jesus]] prays in the night while his disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], James, and John sleep. [[Satan]] appears to Jesus in a hooded ghost-like [[androgynous]] form, and tempts him. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Hearing his disciples, he rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nBribed disciple [[Judas Iscariot]] leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest Jesus]], a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of [[Malchus]], one of the guards and a servant of the high priest [[Caiaphas]]. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the [[Sanhedrin]].\n\nJohn informs [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs two passing Roman officers to intervene but a temple guard claims she is unbalanced. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some priests who are expelled from the court, during which false accusations and witnesses are brought against Jesus. When Caiaphas asks him whether he is the [[Son of God]], Jesus replies, \"I am\". Caiaphas angrily tears his robes and Jesus is condemned to death for [[blasphemy]]. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for following Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by demons, he runs away from the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before [[Pontius Pilate]] to be condemned to death, but at the urging of Pilate's wife Claudia, who knows Jesus is a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of [[Herod Antipas]], as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of [[Nazareth]], Galilee. After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus simply be flogged. The Roman guards abuse, brutally scourge and mock Jesus before taking him to a barn where they place a [[crown of thorns]] on his head and tease him by saying \"Hail, king of the Jews.\" Bloodied, Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' verbal backing, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified and Barabbas released. Pilate reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' sufferings with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along to Golgatha, a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her cloth, to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified.\n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God asking forgiveness for his tormentors, and provides [[salvation]] to a criminal crucified beside him, for his strong faith and repentance. Succumbing, Jesus surrenders his spirit and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering an earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the [[Holy of Holies]] in two, as Satan screams in defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Jesus subsequently rises from the dead and exits the tomb resurrected, with wound holes visible on his palms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n*[[Maia Morgenstern]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Christo Jivkov]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n*[[Francesco De Vito]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n*[[Mattia Sbragia]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n*[[Toni Bertorelli]] as [[Annas|Annas ben Seth]]\n*[[Luca Lionello]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n*[[Hristo Shopov|Hristo Naumov Shopov]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n*[[Claudia Gerini]] as [[Saint Procula|Claudia Procles]]\n*Fabio Sartor as Abenader\n*Giacinto Ferro as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n*Olek Mincer as [[Nicodemus]]\n*Sheila Mokhtari as Woman in audience\n*[[Sergio Rubini]] as [[Saint Dismas|Dismas]]\n*Roberto Bestazoni as [[Malchus]]\n*[[Francesco Cabras]] as [[Gestas|Gesmas]]\n*Giovanni Capalbo as [[Longinus|Cassius]]\n*[[Rosalinda Celentano]] as [[Satan]]\n*[[Emilio De Marchi (actor)|Emilio De Marchi]] as Scornful Roman\n*Lello Giulivo as Brutish Roman\n*Abel Jafry as 2nd Temple officer\n*Jarreth Merz as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n*Rossella Vetrano as Veronica\n*Matt Patresi as [[Janus]]\n*Roberto Visconti as Scornful Roman\n*[[Luca De Dominicis]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod \u00c1ntipas]]\n*Chokri Ben Zagden as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]\n*[[Sabrina Impacciatore]] as [[St. Veronica]]\n*Pietro Sarubbi as [[Barabbas]]\n*[[Ted Rusoff]] as Chief Elder\n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''The Passion: Photography from the Movie \"The Passion of the Christ\"'', director Mel Gibson says, \"This is a movie about Love, Hope, Faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\"\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004 | url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040601072421/http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews | url-status = dead | archive-date = June 1, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film. Mary asks \"Why is this night different from other nights?\", and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: \"Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Rachel | title = Along came Mary; Mel Gibson was sold on Maia Morgenstern for 'Passion' at first sight | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 7, 2004 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/07/entertainment/ca-encounter7}}</ref>\n\nThe conflation of Mary Magdalene with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulteress saved from stoning]] by Jesus has some precedent in tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, [[Dismas]] and Gesmas (also [[Gestas]]).\n\nThe depiction of [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] wiping the face of Jesus is from a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] tradition and is based on a Catholic relic known as the [[Veil of Veronica]]. The film slightly showed the veil bearing the image of the face of Jesus. Its origin lies in the sixth Station of the Cross, in which Saint Veronica wipes Jesus's face with her veil after he encounters her along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Petty |first=Michael John |date=2022-05-13 |title=The Passion Of The Christ Scenes That Aren't In The Bible |url=https://www.looper.com/862656/the-passion-of-the-christ-scenes-that-arent-in-the-bible/ |access-date=2022-11-07 |website=Looper |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Script and language===\nGibson originally announced that he would use two [[Language death#Dead languages|old languages]] without subtitles and rely on \"filmic storytelling\". Because the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\"<ref name=\"Zenit interview 2003\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english| title=Mel Gibson's great passion: Christ's agony as you've never seen it|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=March 6, 2003|access-date=October 17, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815141913/http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english|archive-date=August 15, 2009}}</ref> The script was written in English by Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]], then [[translation|translated]] by [[William Fulco]], S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic. Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001196.php|title= Translating the passion|publisher=Language Hat|date=March 8, 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Matera boenisch nov 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Matera]], Italy]]\nThe film was produced independently and shot in Italy at [[Cinecitt\u00e0|Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios]] in Rome, and on location in the city of [[Matera, Italy|Matera]] and the ghost town of [[Craco]], both in the [[Basilicata]] region. The estimated US$30 million production cost, plus an additional estimated $15 million in marketing costs, were fully borne by Gibson and his company [[Icon Productions]]. According to the DVD special feature, [[Martin Scorsese]] had recently finished his film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', from which Gibson and his production designers constructed part of their set using Scorsese's set. This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.\n\nGibson's film was released on [[Ash Wednesday]], February 25, 2004. Icon Entertainment distributed the theatrical version of the film, and [[20th Century Fox]] distributed the VHS/DVD/Blu-ray version of the film.\n\nGibson consulted several theological advisers during filming, including [[Jonathan Morris (priest)|Fr. Jonathan Morris]], and a local priest, Philip J. Ryan, who visited the set daily to provide counsel, [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], and [[Holy Communion]] to [[Jim Caviezel]], and Masses were celebrated for cast and crew in several locations.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sede Vacante: The Life and Legacy of Archbishop Thuc|first=Edward|last=Jarvis|author-link=Edward Jarvis (author)|year=2018|publisher=The Apocryphile Press|location=Berkeley CA|isbn=978-1949643022|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> During filming, assistant director Jan Michelini was struck twice by lightning.

In the first, Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem (at the eighth station of the cross) and falls to the ground as the women wail around him, and [[Simon of Cyrene]] attempts to hold up the cross and help up Jesus simultaneously. Afterwards, while both are holding up the cross, Jesus says to the women weeping for him, \"Do not weep for me, but for yourselves and for your children\". In the second, Pilate washes his hands, turns to Caiaphas, and says: \"Look you to it\" (i.e., the Pharisees wish to have Jesus crucified). Pilate then turns to Abanader and says: \"Do as they wish\". The scene next shows Pilate calling to his servant, who is carrying a wooden board on which Pilate writes, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews\", in Latin and Hebrew. He then holds the board above his head in full view of Caiaphas, who after reading it challenges Pilate on its content. Pilate replies angrily to Caiaphas in non-subtitled Hebrew.

It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest [[Caiaphas]], who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archive-date=August 20, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\n<blockquote>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

According to Vermes, \"the real problem is not with his attitudes or avowed intentions, but with the lack of appropriate steps taken to prevent visual images from inspiring judeophobia. [[Caiaphas]] and his priestly colleagues often struggle not to smile when they see the defeat of Christ. In the film they allow their policemen to beat him up in open court without protest. In the Gospels itself they are depicted as doing things according to the book and reject the witnesses who testify against Jesus. This does not seem to be so in the film.

This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the historical objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group.
