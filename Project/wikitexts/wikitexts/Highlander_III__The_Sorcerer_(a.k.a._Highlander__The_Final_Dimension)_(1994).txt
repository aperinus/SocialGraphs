Set as an alternate sequel to the [[Highlander (film)|original film]], it is the final ''Highlander'' film that focuses on [[Connor MacLeod]] as the protagonist. In the film, Connor MacLeod is forced to face a new, dangerous enemy, a powerful sorcerer known as Kane who threatens to win the fabled \"Prize\" in order to gain world domination by eliminating MacLeod. It grossed $36.7 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nSome time after the death of his wife Heather in the 16th&nbsp;century, the immortal Scottish Highlander [[Connor MacLeod]] travels to [[Japan]] to train with an immortal named Nakano, a sorcerer (said to be a master of illusion) and old friend of the Highlander's late teacher [[Juan S\u00e1nchez-Villalobos Ram\u00edrez]]. In a cave in Mount Niri, Nakano teaches MacLeod how to fight with the [[katana]] that once belonged to Ram\u00edrez. He also warns of Kane, an evil immortal making his way across Asia with two immortal henchmen named Khabul Khan and Senghi Khan. After burning down a village, the three reach the cave. Kane beheads Nakano, taking his immortal [[Quickening (Highlander)|Quickening]] energy and power of illusion. The Highlander escapes and Nakano laughs as he dies, declaring that Kane will not be present at the time of the Gathering (when the last immortals fight) and implying he has planned one last trick. The release of his energy causes a cave in, trapping Kane and his henchmen.\n\nIn 1788 France, Connor meets and falls in love with Sarah Barrington, a visitor from England. During the [[French Revolution]], MacLeod is captured and sentenced to death for treason against King Louis XVI of France. His immortal friend Pierre Bouchet takes his place, claiming he is tired of his immortal life. Believing Connor is dead, Sarah marries another man. By the time MacLeod finds her, he discovers she now has a family and decides to let her continue believing he is dead.\n\nIn [[Highlander (film)|1985]], the Gathering occurs in [[New York City]] and MacLeod is seemingly the last immortal left alive. He and his new love Brenda Wyatt move to Scotland and are married. She is killed in a car accident in 1987 and he survives without any wounds, indicating he has not lost his immortality and may not have won the Prize. By 1994, Connor is living with his adopted son John in [[Marrakesh]]. Meanwhile, [[archeology|archaeologist]] Dr. Alexandra Johnson (a woman identical to Sarah Barrington) is part of a team excavating the legendary cave of Nakano. The excavation frees Kane, who beheads Senghi to gain a boost in power while his other soldier Khabul leaves to find Connor.\n\nSensing the release of the Quickening again, MacLeod realizes the Game is not over and realizes he must return to New York City. MacLeod leaves John in the care of his friend, Jack Donovan. Arriving in New York, MacLeod (using his old alias of \"Russell Nash\" again) faces and kills Khabul. NYPD Lt. John Stenn believes Khabul's headless body is proof that the \"headhunter\" killer of 1985 is loose again. He concludes the killer is Russell Nash, who was a suspect during the original case.\n\nAlex investigates a piece of kilt cloth found in the cave of Nakano, identifying it as branch of the MacLeod family, one where a clan member was banished for having unnatural powers. Learning that Russell Nash claims to be a descendant of this branch of the clan, Alex tracks him down and witnesses him battle Kane. The fight ends when MacLeod's blade shatters (possibly because their fight crossed into holy ground) and Kane flees.\n\nConnor returns to the [[Scottish Highlands]] to build another sword but is unsuccessful. Learning more and concluding that \"Nash\" is actually the banished Connor MacLeod, still alive, Alex tracks him down and gives him a bar of finely refined steel she found in Nakano's cave. Connor forges a new katana and admits his identity, and the two become lovers. MacLeod then learns Kane has abducted his son John.\n\nMacLeod meets Kane in an old church mission in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and follows him into an abandoned power plant for their final battle. After a brief battle, the Highlander decapitates Kane and truly wins the Prize, now possessing the full power of all immortals who ever lived. He returns to Scotland with Alex and John to live out the rest of his natural life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as [[Connor MacLeod|Connor MacLeod / Russell Nash]]\n* [[Mario Van Peebles]] as Kane\n* [[Deborah Kara Unger]] as Dr. Alexandra \"Alex\" Johnson; Sarah Barrington\n* [[Mako (actor)|Mako]] as Nakano\n* {{ill|Martin Neufeld|fr|Martin Neufeld}} as Lt.

The movie specifically states that Brenda Wyatt died in a car crash in 1987 and shows a version of 1994 where Earth's ozone layer is intact, whereas ''Highlander II'' depicts the ozone layer as being largely gone by 1994, causing many deaths by cancer and radiation poisoning, including Brenda's.\n\nIn a 1996 ''Cinefantastique'' interview, ''Highlander'' producer William Panzer mentioned that several references to the TV series' continuity were inserted into this film as a means of linking it to the TV universe. However, none of them have been acknowledged to each other between the third film and the TV series.\n\nMany of the locations in [[Scotland]] from the original film were revisited for this sequel. Several scenes were shot in the province of [[Quebec]]<ref name=\"playback shooting starts\">{{cite web|author1=<!-- staff writers -->|title=Shooting set to start on sequel to Au Nom du pere et du fils series|url=http://playbackonline.ca/1994/02/14/3238-19940214/|website=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]]|access-date=14 April 2017|location=Toronto|date=February 14, 1994}}</ref> in [[Canada]]: the medieval Japanese village and the building in which Nakano's cave is found were shot near [[Montreal]]. Plus, many sequences in New York were actually shot in Montreal, as well. Other scenes for this film were shot in [[Culture of Morocco#Movies in Morocco|Morocco]].\n\nThe U.S. theatrical release was rated PG-13, and a slightly-longer R-rated ''Special Director's Cut'' was later released on home video with two [[sex scenes]] trimmed from the theatrical release restored. On top of this, additional violence was reinstated, mainly the shot of Kane's head rolling off. The PG-13 theatrical cut originally only showed Kane's head wobbling from side to side, then cutting immediately to the extreme close-up on Connor saying, \"There can be only one.\"\n\nFurthermore, several enhanced visual effects shots are present in the American version, including Kane's arrival in [[New York City]] (via a teleportation portal, instead of stepping off of a freighter in the international version), as well as during the final Quickening sequence (where several additional shots of Connor levitating are seen, complete with new VFX work). Also, the American ''Final Dimension'' cut includes alternate musical tracks and cues (including the song \"God Took a Picture\" during the ending credits instead of [[Loreena McKennitt]]'s \"Bonny Portmore,\" and a rock-instrumental version of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s \"[[Dr. Feelgood (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce song)|Dr. Feelgood]]\" during the final battle between MacLeod and Kane).\n\n==Music==\nThe score was composed and conducted by [[J. Peter Robinson]]. The film marks the first use of \"[[Bonny Portmore]]\" in the ''Highlander'' films (it was also used in the [[Highlander: The Series|television series]]). The soundtrack features the following songs:\n\n* \"Ce He Mise le Ulaingt? The Two Trees\" by [[Loreena McKennitt]] available on her album ''The Mask and Mirror''\n* \"Bonny Portmore\" by [[Loreena McKennitt]], available on her album ''The Visit''\n* \"[[Suze DeMarchi#\"God Took a Picture\"|God Took A Picture]]\" by [[Suze DeMarchi]] (with [[Nuno Bettencourt]])\n* \"[[Bluebeard (song)|Bluebeard]]\" by [[Cocteau Twins]]\n* \"[[Dr. Feelgood (M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce song)|Dr. Feelgood]]\" by [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]] (instrumental riff)\n* \"Dummy Crusher\" by [[Kerbdog]]\n* \"Little Muscle\" by [[Catherine Wheel (band)|Catherine Wheel]]\n* \"Boom Boom\" by [[Definition Of Sound]]\n* \"Honest Joe\" by [[James (band)|James]]\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film opened at number one at the U.K. box office but with a disappointing gross of \u00a3864,000 ($1.3 million) in its opening week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=5 December 1994|title=International box office|page=18|quote=$1,347,798; \u00a31=$1.56}}</ref>\nThe film debuted at number 2 at the U.S. box office, grossing $5.6&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Legends' Refuses to Fall Back|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-31/entertainment/ca-26290_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=2012-06-07}}</ref> The following week it dropped to 7th place, taking in $2.9&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office : 'Legends' Gives a Boost to TriStar|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-07/entertainment/ca-28946_1_weekend-box-office|access-date=2012-06-07}}</ref> ''Highlander III: The Sorcerer'' finished its U.S. theatrical run with a gross of $13.7 million<ref name=numbers/> and grossed $23 million internationally for a worldwide gross of $36.7 million.<ref name=ww/>\n\n===Critical response===\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' remarked, \"How could an action-adventure film that cost $34 million, most of which clearly went into pyrotechnics, computerized special effects and scenic locations, end up looking cheap, silly and lifeless?
