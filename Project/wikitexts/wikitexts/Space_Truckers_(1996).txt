It was filmed at [[Ardmore Studios]], [[County Wicklow]], [[Ireland]].\n\nThe story concerns John Canyon, one of the last independent space transport entrepreneurs. Bad times have forced him to carry suspicious cargo to Earth without asking questions. During the flight, the cargo turns out to be a multitude of virtually unstoppable killer robots.\n\n== Plot ==\nAt a corporation's base on the [[Neptune|Neptunian]] moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], mercenaries are setting up a defense perimeter to try to hold off an unstoppable [[cyborg]] warrior. The company's CEO E.J. Saggs and chief scientist Dr. Nabel seal themselves inside the control room. The cyborg destroys the soldiers' tank and then attacks a helicopter, which crashes into the control room. The soldiers are killed one by one, until Nabel finally deactivates the cyborg with a remote control. The remaining corporate employees discover that the cyborg was created by Nabel for the company. Saggs takes the remote and reactivates the cyborg, ordering it to kill Nabel.\n\nMeanwhile, John Canyon, one of the last independent \"space truckers\", drops off his cargo of square pigs at a \"truck stop\" space station, but becomes embroiled in a brawl with the trucking company head, Keller, who is sucked out into space. He and his two passengers\u2014Cindy, a waitress who has promised to marry him in exchange for a ride to Earth to see her mother, and Mike, an up-and-coming trucker working for the company\u2014take on a deal to transport alleged [[sex doll]]s to Earth. Chased by police investigating Keller's death, John takes his rig into the \"scum zone\", a region controlled by pirates. The rig takes damage, leaving them adrift; they are soon captured by the pirate ship ''Regalia'', commanded by the company-hating Captain [[Macanudo (cigar)|Macanudo]]. Cindy agrees to have sex with him if he would take the cargo and let them go.\n\nThe captain is revealed to be Nabel, who rebuilt his grievously injured body and went into piracy as revenge against Saggs for betraying him. The cargo that John's rig is carrying is in fact a full supply of the cyborg warriors Nabel designed and built for Saggs' company. One of the cyborgs activates, kills most of the crew, and severely damages the ship. John, Cindy and Mike take their rig and escape as the ''Regalia'' explodes. As they make their way back to Earth, John and Mike find a mortally wounded Macanudo in the hold, who reveals the true nature of the cargo to them. John releases Cindy from any obligation of marrying him, and tells her and Mike to take the [[escape pod]] while he releases the cargo in the atmosphere, where it will burn up on re-entry. Cindy and Mike land safely, but the rig is unable to return to space and explodes in the sky; however, John is able to safely escape before the explosion.\n\nJohn, Cindy and Mike go to the hospital to see Cindy's mother, who became sick twenty years earlier and was [[suspended animation|frozen]] until a cure was found; John is smitten with her at first sight. Meanwhile, Saggs\u2014now President of Earth after the government was privatized\u2014visits John, Cindy and Mike in the hospital, where he offers John a new rig and gives the trio a suitcase full of money to keep them quiet about his cyborg invasion plan. John agrees to the deal, but Mike angrily throws the suitcase out the window. Below, Saggs re-enters his presidential limousine; having planted a bomb in the suitcase, he triggers the detonator just as the suitcase lands on his limousine's roof, killing him. With Saggs dead and Earth safe, Mike, Cindy, John and Cindy's mother blast off in their brand new rig.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dennis Hopper]] as John Canyon\n* [[Debi Mazar]] as Cindy\n* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Mike Pucci\n* [[Barbara Crampton]] as Carol\n* [[Charles Dance]] as Dr. Nabel / Captain Macanudo\n* [[George Wendt]] as Keller\n* Seamus Flavin as Chopper 4\n* [[Jason O'Mara]] as Chopper 3\n* [[Vernon Wells (actor)|Vernon Wells]] as Mr. Cutt\n* [[Sandra Dickinson]] as Betty \"Bitchin' Betty\"\n* [[Tim Loane]] as Trooper Officer\n* [[Ian Beattie]] as Trooper\n* [[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]] as Building Commander\n* [[Shane Rimmer]] as Commander E.J.
