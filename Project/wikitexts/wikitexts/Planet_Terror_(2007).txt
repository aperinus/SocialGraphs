Set in Texas, the film follows the survivors of a biochemical outbreak as they battle zombie-like creatures and a rogue military unit. It stars [[Rose McGowan]], [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]], [[Michael Biehn]], [[Jeff Fahey]], [[Josh Brolin]], and [[Marley Shelton]].\n\nThe film was originally released theatrically as part of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', a [[double feature]] that combined ''Planet Terror'' with [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Death Proof]]''. After ''Grindhouse'' underperformed at the domestic box office, ''Planet Terror'' was released as a standalone feature in other countries and on home media. It received positive reviews, with most critics considering it the superior of ''Grindhouse''{{'}}s two films.\n\n==Plot==\nIn rural Texas, [[go-go dancer]] Cherry Darling runs into her mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray at the Bone Shack, a restaurant owned by brothers J.T. and Sheriff Hague. Meanwhile, the demented Lt. Muldoon and his men make a transaction with chemical engineer Abby for mass quantities of DC2, a deadly biochemical agent. When Muldoon learns that Abby has an extra supply, he attempts to take Abby hostage, causing him to release the gas into the air, mutating most of the town's residents into deformed [[zombie]]s. The infected townspeople are treated by Dr. William Block and his unhappy, unfaithful, and bisexual anesthesiologist wife, Dakota at a local hospital.\n\nRandom attacks begin along the highway, causing El Wray and Cherry to crash. In the aftermath, several zombies tear off Cherry's right leg. At the hospital is Tammy, the former lover of Dakota, who Block recognizes. Upon realizing Dakota was about to leave him for Tammy, he stabs Dakota's hands with her [[anesthetic]] [[hypodermic|syringe]] needles repeatedly, rendering them useless, before locking her in a closet.\n\nEl Wray is detained by Sheriff Hague based on past encounters between the two. As the patients mutate, El Wray leaves the station and arrives at the hospital, attaching a wooden table leg to Cherry's stump. As El Wray and Cherry fight their way out of the hospital, Dakota manages to escape in her car. Meanwhile, Block becomes infected along with others, while Cherry and El Wray take refuge at the Bone Shack.\n\nDakota retrieves her son Tony and takes him to her estranged father, [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Earl McGraw. (Following a [[Planet Terror#Editing|\"missing reel\"]] segment) Dakota, Earl, Cherry's former boss Skip, and Tony's crazed babysitter twins arrive at the Bone Shack. With Hague badly injured, the group decides to flee to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexican border]], before being stopped by a large mass of zombies. Muldoon's men arrive, killing the zombies before arresting the group. Abby tells them that the soldiers are stealing the gas supply because they are infected and constant inhalation of the gas delays mutation. They also learn that some of the population is immune, hinting at the possibility of a cure.\n\nAs Cherry and Dakota are taken away by two soldiers, the others defeat the guards. J.T. sustains a gunshot wound in the process while the group searches for Muldoon. When he is found by El Wray and Abby, Muldoon explains that he killed [[Osama bin Laden]] before he and his men were infected and were ordered to protect the area before being killed by Abby and El Wray. Meanwhile, Cherry is held at gunpoint and forced to dance by a soldier who threatens to rape her. Eventually, she breaks her wooden leg across his face and stabs him in the eye. Dakota, after realizing her hands have regained feeling, uses her syringe launcher to subdue another soldier. El Wray and Abby arrive to rescue Cherry and Dakota; El Wray replaces Cherry's broken wooden leg with an assault rifle.\n\nJ.T. decides to stay behind to detonate explosives to eliminate the remaining zombies while the others flee. The survivors make plans to escape by stealing [[helicopters]] after fighting through a large group of zombies, but Abby dies in the process. While saving Cherry from a zombie, El Wray is fatally wounded. Cherry, now sporting a [[minigun]] leg, leads survivors to the [[Caribbean]] beach at [[Tulum]], where they start a peaceful new society during a worldwide zombie outbreak. It is also revealed that Cherry has given birth to her and El Wray's daughter.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tony is sitting on the beach at the survivor's \"base\" playing with his [[turtle]], [[scorpion]] and [[tarantula]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Rose McGowan]] as Cherry Darling\n* [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]] as \"El Wray\"\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as Dr. William Block\n* [[Marley Shelton]] as Dr. Dakota Block\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as J.T.

I had [a script] I\u2019d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [movie] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'\" The story was reapproached when the idea for ''Grindhouse'' was developed by Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.<ref name=\"Wizard\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004090803.cfm |title=House Party |access-date=2007-04-04 |last=Cotton |first=Mike |date=April 4, 2007 |publisher=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Universe]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194539/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004090803.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\n''Planet Terror'' is preceded by a fake trailer for a film titled ''Machete'', starring [[Danny Trejo]] and [[Cheech Marin]], as it had during the original \"double feature\" presentation of ''Grindhouse''. Rodriguez wrote ''Machete'' in 1993 as a full feature for [[Danny Trejo]]. \"I had cast him in ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and I remember thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of [[Mexploitation|Mexican exploitation]] movies like [[Charles Bronson]] or like [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]].' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from [[Mexico]] who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes [[FBI]] or [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.'

[[Harvey Weinstein]] did not want [[Rose McGowan]] to be cast in the film, after he allegedly sexually assaulted her years earlier and then blacklisted her from being in any Miramax-related movies. Robert Rodriguez was dating McGowan and cast her knowing that it would enrage Harvey (and also that [[Bob Weinstein]] would make Harvey get lost if he tried to screw with his Dimension label releases), though Rodriguez later said that Harvey deliberately slashed the ad budget for the film in a (successful) effort to hurt it at the box office.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bishop|first=Bryan|date=2017-10-27|title=Rose McGowan's role in Grindhouse was revenge on Harvey Weinstein|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16562260/rose-mcgowan-robert-rodriguez-harvey-weinstein-grindhouse-revenge|access-date=2021-01-13|website=The Verge|language=en|archive-date=2020-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112004850/https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16562260/rose-mcgowan-robert-rodriguez-harvey-weinstein-grindhouse-revenge|url-status=live}}</ref> McGowan accused Rodriguez of exploiting her,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=2018-01-03|title=Rose McGowan: Robert Rodriguez Filmed 'Planet Terror' Abuse Scene After She Told Him About Harvey Weinstein Rape|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/01/rose-mcgowan-robert-rodriguez-planet-terror-harvey-weinstein-rape-1201912923/|access-date=2021-01-13|website=IndieWire|language=en|archive-date=2021-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210123071710/https://www.indiewire.com/2018/01/rose-mcgowan-robert-rodriguez-planet-terror-harvey-weinstein-rape-1201912923/|url-status=live}}</ref> but Rodriguez noted that she signed on to the script that was filmed, and that sequences where McGowan's character was threatened with sexual assault were there to then set up her attacking and killing predatory men.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=2018-01-04|title=Robert Rodriguez Denies Playing Mind Games With Rose McGowan, Lists the Inaccuracies in Her 'Planet Terror' Story|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2018/01/robert-rodriguez-rose-mcgowan-planet-terror-mind-games-1201913279/|access-date=2021-01-13|website=IndieWire|language=en|archive-date=2020-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203144828/https://www.indiewire.com/2018/01/robert-rodriguez-rose-mcgowan-planet-terror-mind-games-1201913279/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\nThe film uses various unconventional techniques to make ''Planet Terror'' appear more like the films that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s.

During post-production, the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots and replaced it with computer-generated props\u2014first a table leg and then an assault rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion.<ref name=\"VFX\"/>\n\n===Editing===\nDuring pre-production, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up with the idea of inserting a \"missing reel\" into the film. \"[Quentin] was about to show an Italian crime movie with [[Oliver Reed]],\" Rodriguez recalls, \"and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we\u2019ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. ... The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway.\"<ref name=\"Wizard\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe music for ''Planet Terror'' was composed by Robert Rodriguez.
