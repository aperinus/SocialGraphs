He is in danger of losing his life's work because the Angels' new owner, Gil Lawrence (Kinney), is unhappy with the [[Farm team|farm system]] and threatening to eliminate the team's scouts.\n\nVirgil hasn't discovered a great young prospect for quite a while. One day, when the car that he and girlfriend Bobbie (Bracco), who also is employed by the team, are driving breaks down on a rural road, Virgil happens upon a country boy named Sammy Bodeen (Corbett) who has a pitching arm worthy of the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]].\n\nGreeted back in [[Anaheim]] with considerable skepticism, Virgil arranges a tryout for Sammy. The boy is wild at first and Virgil's great find appears to be a big joke. Once he calms down, however, Sammy proves to have everything it takes to make it big.\n\nTeam management, desperate for a new star, immediately begins to overplay the arrival of Sammy with wildly overblown hype. A public-relations blitz promotes the boy as baseball's next great star, even though he has yet to throw a pitch in a big-league game. By the time Sammy takes the mound for his first Angels game, expectations are so high that he cannot possibly live up to them.\n\nHe is roughed up by opponents in the first inning, humiliating the owner and making fans furious. But, gradually, with a surprise assist from Virgil on the field, Sammy settles down and begins to look like a star in the making.\n\n==Cast==\n{|\n|\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as Virgil Sweet\n* [[Lorraine Bracco]] as Bobbie\n* John E.
