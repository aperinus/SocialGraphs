Heller and [[Martha Scott]], directed by [[Ronald Neame]], that is based on the 1978 [[First Monday in October|play of the same name]] by [[Jerome Lawrence]] and [[Robert Edwin Lee|Robert E. Lee]]. The film stars [[Walter Matthau]] (for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]) and [[Jill Clayburgh]] (for which she was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]]). The cast also co-stars [[Jan Sterling]] in her final [[feature film]] role.\n\nParamount Pictures originally scheduled ''First Monday in October'' for release in February 1982, but President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s appointment of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] as the first female Supreme Court justice on July 7, 1981, forced the film's release a month after her nomination, in August 1981.\n\nThe film's title refers to [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|the day that the Supreme Court commences its annual term]], which continues until June or early July of the following year.\n\n==Plot==\nThe death of Stanley Moorehead, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has created a vacancy on the high court. The President's appointee turns out to be Ruth Loomis, a staunch [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] from [[Orange County, California]], who is confirmed as the first female Associate Justice.\n\nShe and Associate Justice Daniel Snow, a committed [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] who is many years older than Loomis and with many years on the Supreme Court, clash intellectually on just about every judicial issue before them. One case involves a pornographic film and involves arguments about [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]].\n\nAnother is a lawsuit, sent up from the lower court, brought by a company's stockholders regarding the suppression of a possibly revolutionary new power source, a [[reactionless drive|momentum engine]]. The patent is controlled by the board of directors of Omnitech International, and its CEO Donald Richards, who has not been seen in public for a decade and is unavailable by [[subpoena]].\n\nWith time, the two judges develop a liking and respect for each other. They realize this while Snow is recovering in the hospital from a \"heart episode\" suffered while he and Loomis were debating the complexities of the momentum engine/Omnitech case, after hours, in the courthouse.\n\nBased on something Snow intimated during their debate, Loomis returns to Orange County, overnight. There, in a records storage center, she discovers proof that her late husband and his law firm covered up the death of their client, Donald Richards. Because of her former association with the law firm, she concludes she has a serious conflict of interest on the Omnitech case, and must now resign her Associate Justice position. When Snow hears this, he leaves the hospital abruptly and after more debate, talks her out of resigning. They head by taxi to the Supreme Court to announce her discovery, one that will no doubt shake up the Omnitech case and get it on the docket for the high court to review.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Associate Justice Daniel Snow\n* [[Jill Clayburgh]] as Associate Justice Ruth Loomis\n* [[Barnard Hughes]] as Chief Justice James Jefferson Crawford\n* [[Jan Sterling]] as Christine Snow\n* [[James Stephens (actor)|James Stephens]] as Mason Woods\n* [[Joshua Bryant]] as Bill Russell\n* [[Wiley Harker]] as Associate Justice Harold Webb \n* F.J.

The film carries an average rating of 3.1/5.\n\n''New York Times critic'' [[Janet Maslin]] opened her review of the film with two questions: \u201cWhat if the latest Supreme Court Justice were a woman? And what if that woman were a terrible pill?\u201d concisely summarizing her problems with the film, which clearly showed signs of having been rushed to market. She praised Matthau's performance and found fault with the character of Justice Ruth Loomis but pointed to the screenplay as \u201cthe main source of difficulty. The authors' idea is to confront a crotchety liberal Justice, Dan Snow, with the sprightly, more conservative Ruth Loomis, and let the sparks fly. However, Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Lee have a way of mistaking hectoring, nagging and all-out nastiness for the stuff of which sparks are made.\u201d Director Ronald Neame came under fire for a variety of errors, including an August scene set with snow and slush and the discordant\u2014to her\u2014casting of  ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]'' star [[James Stephens (actor)|James Stephens]] in a role very similar to his one he played in the television series.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9C06E6DF1E38F932A1575BC0A967948260 | title=Movie Review: First Monday in October | work=New York Times | author=Janet Maslin | date=21 August 1981 | accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref>\n\n==Home video==\n''First Monday in October'' was first released on DVD by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Video]] on July 6, 2004.
