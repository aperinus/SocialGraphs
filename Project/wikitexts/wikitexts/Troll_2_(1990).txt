The plot concerns a family pursued by [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] [[goblin]]s who seek to transform them into plants so that they can eat them.\n\nProduction was rife with difficulties, largely due to the [[language barrier]] between the Italian-speaking crew and English-speaking cast, and producer [[Joe D'Amato]]'s approach to low-budget filmmaking. The resulting film is considered by some as one of the [[List of films considered the worst#Troll 2 (1990)|worst movies ever made]]. In subsequent years, the film gained a [[cult following]] and garnered a large fanbase. Though it was generally viewed as poorly made horror, the filmmakers stated that it was \"always intended to be a comic film\".<ref name=Guardian/> In 2009, Stephenson, the child star of the film, directed a critically acclaimed documentary about its production and subsequent popularity, humorously titled ''[[Best Worst Movie]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Harley |first=David |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18504 |title=Best & Worst of 2009: David Harley Picks His Top 10! |website=Bloody-disgusting.com |date=2009-12-24 |access-date=2015-10-25}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=July 2021}}\nMichael Waits has always dreamed of being a farmer and arranges a [[home exchange|home exchange vacation]] in which he and his family will move into a house in the rural farming community of Nilbog (\"goblin\" spelled backwards) for a month. The night before the family is scheduled to leave, Michael's son Joshua is contacted by the [[ghost]] of his dead grandfather, Seth, warning him that [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] [[goblin]]s want to transform him and his family into plants so that they can eat them. Seth tells Joshua that goblins can transform people into plants by feeding them poisoned food or drink.\n\nMeanwhile, Joshua's sister, Holly, receives a visit from her boyfriend Elliot Cooper. Holly accuses Elliot of being a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] since he seems to prefer spending time with his male friends. Elliot promises to show his devotion by accompanying the family on vacation.\n\nThe next morning, Elliot fails to arrive and the family leaves without him; they encounter him en route to Nilbog, riding in an RV with his friends Arnold, Drew, and Brent. Outside of Nilbog, Seth appears as a hitchhiker, who warns Joshua that Nilbog is the kingdom of the goblins and that if his family eats anything while they are there, they will be transformed into plants. The family disbelieves Joshua's warnings and continues on to Nilbog, where they meet their strange and aloof exchange family, the Presents. There, Joshua sets about destroying all of the food the family finds or acquires, such as by [[Urination|urinating]] over a feast prepared for them, with the help of Seth's ghost.\n\nArnold goes for a walk outside of Nilbog and encounters a girl being chased by goblins. When Arnold approaches them and insults them, they respond by throwing a spear into his chest. They flee to a [[chapel]] in the woods, where they encounter the goblins' queen, [[druid]] [[Witchcraft|witch]] Creedence Leonore Gielgud, who uses the \"[[Stonehenge]] Magic Stone\" to give the goblins power. Creedence tricks them into drinking a magic [[potion]] that dissolves the girl into vegetable matter which the goblins eat, a horrifying scene witnessed by Arnold that prompts him to scream helplessly only to be transformed into a tree.\n\nThe following morning, Michael and Joshua venture into town to buy some food, as there is none in their holiday home. When in town, they find the general store closed, and Michael falls asleep on a bench. Joshua enters the local church and eavesdrops on a goblin church [[sermon]], which bewails the \"evils\" of eating meat. The parishioners capture him after seeing his skateboard roll into the church and attempt to force-feed him poisonous ice cream; Michael walks in on the scene and becomes suspicious, taking Joshua home.\n\nLater, Drew goes to the town because there is no food or drinks in the RV. The sheriff Gene Freak takes him in his car and gives him a green hamburger. When he arrives in the town, Drew goes to the store and the owner offers him poisonous Nilbog milk. Feeling dizzy, he goes to a chapel and finds Arnold, who has transformed into a tree. Drew drags him out, but Creedence appears. She knocks him out and [[chainsaw]]s Arnold into pieces. Drew is then killed off-screen.\n\nAt the house, the family discovers that the townspeople have prepared them a surprise party to apologize for the events at the church. Joshua attempts to make contact with Seth, only for Creedence to appear in goblin form through the mirror and attack Joshua. Seth's ghost appears and chops her hand off with an ax. Creedence returns to her chapel, where she transforms herself into a beautiful woman in revealing clothes; she then travels to Elliot's RV, where she seduces Brent and drowns him in [[popcorn]].\n\nDuring the party, Seth and Joshua try to cause a distraction using a [[molotov cocktail]], but the Priest captures them, takes the cocktail, and recites a [[Incantation|spell]] that banishes Seth's soul to [[hell]]. However, before he vanishes, Seth summons a bolt of lightning from the sky, which ignites the cocktail and kills the Priest in a fiery explosion. When Michael extinguishes his burning corpse, his true Goblin form is revealed, and the villagers turn on the Waits, revealing themselves all as Goblins. The Waits and Elliot then retreat to the house, where the villagers surround them and hold them hostage.\n\nJoshua, Elliot, Holly, Michael, and Diana hold a [[s\u00e9ance]] to communicate with Seth, who returns from the dead and tells them that he can retain a physical form for exactly ten minutes before he has to return to the [[afterlife]]. Seth gives Joshua a paper bag containing a \"secret weapon\" to use against the goblins. The goblins break into the house and transport Joshua to Creedence's chapel, where Joshua opens the bag, revealing a \"double-decker [[bologna sandwich]]\". He eats the sandwich, making his body poisonous to the goblins; he then touches the Stonehenge Stone, along with his family and Elliot, which destroys Creedence and all of the Goblins present.\n\nThe family returns home, where Joshua's mother is seen eating food from the refrigerator. The food, unknown to the family, has been poisoned by the family of goblins which is very likely to be the Presents family, who took over their home during their exchange in the country. Joshua then walks in on a group of goblins eating his now-dead mother's green, bloated torso off of the kitchen counter and offering him a bite. Joshua screams in horror at the end.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Michael Stephenson (filmmaker)|Michael Stephenson]] as Joshua Waits\n* [[George Hardy (actor)|George Hardy]] as Michael Waits\n* Margo Prey as Diana Waits\n* [[Connie Young|Connie McFarland]] as Holly Waits\n* Robert Ormsby as Grandpa Seth\n* Deborah Reed as Creedence Leonore Gielgud\n* [[Jason F.

D'Amato worked under the pseudonym \"David Hills\". In keeping with D'Amato's production philosophy, many components of the film were created for little to no money, such as the costumes that were designed by D'Amato's longtime friend and frequent collaborator [[Laura Gemser]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Jon|date=2020-10-11|title=Why Troll 2 really is the best worst movie ever made|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/troll-2-halloween-horror-movie|access-date=2020-12-23|website=SYFY WIRE|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot on location in [[Morgan, Utah|Morgan]] and [[Porterville, Utah]] in the summer of 1989; a large \"M\" erected in the mountains outlying Morgan is visible in some shots. The production crew was made up almost entirely of non-English-speaking Italians brought to America by Fragasso; the only fluent English speaker on set was Gemser. Fragasso and his crew largely relied on a broken [[pidgin|pidgin English]] to communicate with the cast, who recalled not being able to understand much of what went on.<ref name=\"biasedbohemian.com\"/>\n\nThe cast had few experienced actors and was primarily assembled from residents of nearby towns who responded to an open casting call, hoping to win roles as extras. George Hardy was a dentist with no acting experience who showed up for fun, only to be given one of the film's largest speaking roles. Don Packard, who played the store owner, was actually a patient at a nearby mental hospital, and was cast for\u2014\u2060and subsequently filmed\u2060\u2014his role while on a day trip. He later recalled that he had smoked an enormous amount of marijuana prior to filming, had no idea what was happening around him, and that his disturbed \"performance\" in the film was not acting.<ref name=\"breakfastintheruins.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nDrudi and Fragasso have stated that their intentions have been misunderstood, as the strongly criticized aspects of the film are intentionally comic and exaggerated, such as Creedence's theatrical acting or the preacher's monologue on eating meat.<ref>[http://www.bizzarrocinema.it/interviste/altre-interviste/professione-sceneggiatore-intervista-esclusiva-a-rossella-drudi/ Bizzarro Cinema \u2013 Professione sceneggiatore: intervista a Rossella Drudi (Parte 1)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs neither Fragasso nor Drudi spoke fluent English, the shooting script was written in the same broken dialect in which they both spoke; the cast would later recall that the script was only given to them scene-by-scene and that they had difficulty understanding their dialogue as written. Some of the cast members offered to correct their lines to sound more grammatically and syntactically correct but said that Fragasso demanded they deliver their lines verbatim.<ref name=\"breakfastintheruins.blogspot.com\"/> Despite the majority of the cast attesting to the same story, Fragasso has vehemently denied their version of events, and once reacted angrily to a panel discussion being conducted by the cast, calling the actors \"dogs\" (Italian for \"bad actors\"<ref>[http://dizionari.repubblica.it/Italiano/C/cane.php cane], Garzanti linguistica</ref>) and accusing them of lying about their experiences.<ref name=\"breakfastintheruins.blogspot.com\"/>\n\n===Soundtrack===\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Carlo Maria Cordio and was played entirely on [[Roland D-50]] and [[Korg M1]] [[synthesizer]]s, consisting of a few brief themes repeated over and over, including a sped-up M1 demo track.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 2017, the complete score was released on CD, LP and cassette by Lunaris Records.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n{{Track listing\n|headline = CD track listing\n|title1 = Like an Emerald Green\n|length1 = 2:21\n|title2 = Goblins Are Coming\n|length2 = 1:16\n|title3 = Wrapped in Dreams\n|length3 = 1:26\n|title4 = Through the Mirror\n|length4 = 2:41\n|title5 = Green Nightmare\n|length5 = 2:51\n|title6 = Black Sense of the Fear\n|length6 = 2:21\n|title7 = Desperate Sprint in the Forest\n|length7 = 2:06\n|title8 = The Witch of Popcorn\n|length8 = 3:56\n|title9 = Na-Na Song\n|length9 = 4:06\n|title10 = Shadow in the House\n|length10 = 2:06\n|title11 = A Green Pottage\n|length11 = 1:06\n|title12 = They Are Not Farmers\n|length12 = 3:06\n|title13 = Wail of Terror\n|length13 = 1:11\n|title14 = Can I Help You\n|length14 = 1:11\n|title15 = Eaten Like Green Sauce\n|length15 = 2:21\n|title16 = Green Jam Sandwich\n|length16 = 1:01\n|title17 = Tennessee Roads\n|length17 = 3:51\n|title18 = The Welcome Cake of Prudence\n|length18 = 2:56\n|title19 = Grandpa Fairytales\n|length19 = 3:16\n|title20 = Carousel of Vegetables\n|length20 = 1:11\n|title21 = Do You Want Some, Joshua\n|length21 = 2:26\n|title22 = Don't Eat Green Food\n|length22 = 2:46\n|title23 = Tomorrow Nightmare\n|length23 = 3:01\n|title24 = The Horror of It All\n|length24 = 3:36\n|title25 = Goblin's World\n|length25 = 3:16\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=June 2019}}\n''Troll 2'' is widely considered to be of exceptionally poor quality, and has come to be regarded by the public as [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films ever made]].
