Starring [[Natalie Portman]] and [[Ashton Kutcher]], the film is about two friends who decide to make a pact to have a \"[[casual sex|no strings attached]]\" relationship, without falling in love with each other. The film was released in the [[United States]] on January 21, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter first meeting at a summer camp as teenagers, Emma Kurtzman and Adam Franklin run into each other a few times as young adults but never keep in touch. Emma is  a doctor in [[Los Angeles]], and Adam is a production assistant for a musical television show.\n\nSoon, Adam finds out that his father Alvin, the well-known star of a former hit television comedy series, has begun a romance with his ex-girlfriend, Vanessa. Devastated, a drunken Adam calls all his female contacts to hook up. The next morning, he wakes up on Emma's couch, with her friends and colleagues teasing and telling him that he was crying and passed out naked on the couch. She leads him to her room to find his pants, and they have sex.\n\nThey have sex again at Adam's house. Before Emma leaves, they agree to engage in a \"no strings attached\" relationship, where they just have sex. Soon, Adam finds himself getting jealous of Emma's co-worker Sam, and being an emotional person, he doubles his romantic attempts towards her. She feels awkward and thus ends their arrangement, only to end up missing him. She drunkenly crashes at his place, and they sleep together again.\n\nOn Adam's birthday, his father tells him he wishes to have children with Vanessa. Disgusted, Adam walks out, and Emma defends him. He asks her for one single date on [[Valentine's Day]], and it seems perfect till she awkwardly tells him she will not engage in an emotional relationship. He says he can't continue without progressing, so they agree to not see each other.\n\nSix weeks later, at her sister's wedding rehearsal dinner, Emma realizes she wants to be with Adam. She calls, saying that she misses him, but he shuts her down. She drives over to his place, only to see Adam and his colleague Lucy, who she thinks is his girlfriend, going inside together. She drives away, heartbroken.\n\nLater that same night, Adam and Lucy are awkwardly starting to get intimate when Vanessa calls to tell him his father is in the hospital. Adam rushes to the hospital, only to see Emma there as well, as her colleague Shira had informed her.\n\nAs Emma confesses her feelings to Adam, he asks her to pursue their relationship again, and she agrees. They are then shown to have breakfast, a sign of a \"strings attached\" relationship, as the movie ends it shows them in time for her sister's wedding.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Dr. Emma K.
