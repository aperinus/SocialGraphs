The film attracted a strong critical following in [[North America]] and helped to launch Owen's acting career there. It uses interior monologues in the style of many early noir detective films.\n\n''Croupier'' was released on DVD by Alliance Atlantis in Canada and Image Entertainment in the US. It was disqualified from the [[Academy Award]]s after it was shown on Dutch television.<ref name=Goldstein2000>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/14/entertainment/ca-51288 |title=An Oscar for ''Croupier'' Doesn't Seem in the Cards |work=Los Angeles Times |date=14 November 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109160838/https://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/14/entertainment/ca-51288 |archive-date=9 January 2019 |url-status=live |first=Patrick |last=Goldstein |author-link=Patrick Goldstein}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nJack Manfred is an aspiring but as yet unsuccessful writer. To make ends meet and against his better judgment, he takes a job as a [[croupier]] at a local casino. The interview was set up by his father, a small-time hustler back home in South Africa.\n\nJack finds himself drawn into the casino world, and the job gradually takes over his life. He goes drinking with Matt, a croupier who he knows is cheating the casino. He sleeps with a fellow croupier named Bella in violation of casino policy. His relationship with his girlfriend Marion begins to deteriorate when he lets her read part of his book about a cold, unfeeling croupier who enjoys seeing gamblers lose, a character transparently based on Jack himself. Bella confronts Jack at his apartment, accuses him of getting her fired, and tells Marion about the one-night stand.\n\nOne gambler, Jani, tries to befriend Jack, another serious violation of casino rules. Jani shows him bruises saying she got them from gambling creditors and asks Jack to be the inside man for a planned robbery at the casino. All he has to do is raise the alarm when a gambler cheats at his table. Jack eventually agrees and accepts a \u00a310,000 advance with an additional \u00a310,000 if all goes well. In doing so, Jack notices that Jani's injuries were faked.\n\nMarion reconciles with Jack but discovers that he is involved in something criminal and tries to foil it. She deletes a phone message for Jack alerting him that the robbery is on for Christmas Eve, and instead alerts a former colleague on the police. On the night of the robbery, Jack gets beaten by the gambler as a distraction while others try to grab the money. They fail, and Jack and Marion have an argument but she stays with him.\n\nWhen a late-night knock at the door comes, Jack assumes it to be the casino robbers demanding the return of their advance money. Instead, it is a policeman, who informs him that Marion has been killed in an apparent hit-and-run.\n\nJack finishes his book and gets it published anonymously. It is a big success, but he doesn't change anything about his life, continuing to work as a croupier and live in his basement flat, not even buying the new car he wanted.\n\nJack goes on with his life and gets another call, this one from Jani, who congratulates him on playing his part in the attempted robbery and implies that she benefited significantly. Then she puts his father on the phone, and he implies that he set up the croupier job for Jack in order to arrange for the attempted robbery, and he benefited as well. Stunned but amused, Jack hangs up. Just then, Bella appears from the bedroom and kisses him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Jack Manfred \n* [[Kate Hardie]] as Bella\n* [[Alex Kingston]] as Jani de Villiers\n* [[Gina McKee]] as Marion Nell\n* [[Nicholas Ball (actor)|Nicholas Ball]] as Jack Sr.\n* [[Alexander Morton]] as David Reynolds\n* [[Nick Reding (actor)|Nick Reding]] as Giles Cremorne\n* [[Paul Reynolds (actor)|Paul Reynolds]] as Matt\n* [[Barnaby Kay]] as Car Dealer\n\n==Production==\n''Croupier'' was commissioned by [[Film4 Productions|FilmFour]] and had a budget of \u00a33 million.<ref name=\"guardian1\">{{cite news |last1=Ellison |first1=Michael |title=When the chips are down |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/259627738/?terms=%22Clive%2BOwen%22%2BCroupier |accessdate=15 June 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=9 June 2000}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Croupier'' received a muted response upon its initial release in Britain.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/> It was not until its release in the United States that it received widespread critical praise.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/>\n\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave ''Croupier'' a 95% positive rating based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10.
