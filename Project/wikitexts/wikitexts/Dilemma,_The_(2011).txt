They are pursuing a project to make their firm famous. Ronny sees Nick's wife Geneva ([[Winona Ryder]]) kissing another man ([[Channing Tatum]]).

''The Dilemma'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States and Canada on January 14, 2011, to negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office, failing to recoup its $70 million production budget.\n\n==Plot==\nRonny and Nick are best friends and partners in a small auto design firm. Ronny is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend Beth while Nick is married to Geneva. The two have recently been given an opportunity to pitch an [[eco friendly]] car to Dodge.\n\nWhile at a botanical gardens planning a way to propose marriage to Beth, Ronny sees Geneva kissing a man named Zip. He comes home upset, but lies to Beth about the reason, causing her to worry that the stress of work has caused a recurrence of Ronny's [[gambling addiction]].\n\nRonny makes up his mind to inform Nick about Geneva's infidelity, but puts it off after Nick expresses stress about their work. He meets with Geneva, who promises that the affair is over and that she will tell Nick as soon as the big project is finished. Ronny subsequently discovers her and Zip continuing their relationship. Geneva then threatens to accuse Ronny of hitting on her and tell Nick about a fling they had had back in college.\n\nRonny follows Geneva to Zip's house and photographs the two of them together but becomes trapped inside and misses his in-laws' anniversary party. Ronny's increasingly erratic behavior leads his friends to think that he has begun gambling again. They hold an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] for him but Ronny explains the truth behind his actions and Geneva admits to both the affair and her fling with Ronny. While Nick is upset about both, he eventually forgives Ronny and divorces Geneva for her affair with Zip. Later, Nick and Ronny have their design accepted by Dodge and Ronny proposes to Beth.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per opening tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Vince Vaughn]] as Ronny Valentine\n* [[Kevin James]] as Nick Brannen\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Beth\n* [[Winona Ryder]] as Geneva\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Zip\n* [[Amy Morton]] as Diane Popovich\n* [[Queen Latifah]] as Susan Warner\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as Thomas Fern\n* Eduardo N.

The film was Howard's first comedy film since he directed ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 2000. The film was first announced in January 2010 as an untitled project when actor [[Vince Vaughn]] signed on for a starring role. The premise was conceived by producer [[Brian Grazer]], Howard's production partner at Imagine Entertainment; Loeb wrote the script.<ref name=\"cheating\">{{cite news | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6040VK20100106?type=peopleNews | title=Vince Vaughn, Ron Howard eye cheating picture | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref> Actor [[Kevin James]] was cast alongside Vaughn in February.<ref>{{cite news | last=Kit | first=Borys | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61M06420100223 | title=Kevin James to co-star in Ron Howard film | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=February 22, 2010 }}</ref> The film continues \"Vaughn's interest in tackling the dark areas of relationships\", following ''[[The Break-Up]]'' (2006) and ''[[Couples Retreat]]'' (2009).

I mean, not homosexual gay, but my-parents-are-chaperoning-the-dance gay.\" Universal said it contacted the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) about the line before the trailer was released, and GLAAD said the step indicated the studio knew the line was problematic. Universal received complaints when the trailer appeared online before in theaters, and the studio sought to work with GLAAD to prepare a new trailer. Before action was taken, the line was first publicly criticized by journalist [[Anderson Cooper]] in a story about gay bullying on his show ''[[Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0]]''. Universal and GLAAD disputed each other's actions toward remedy, and GLAAD requested for the trailer to be removed and for the line to be removed from the film itself. Ultimately, the studio released a new trailer without the offending line.<ref>{{cite news | last=Kilday | first=Gregg | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69B0HX20101012 | title='Dilemma' dispute hurts studio and gay rights group | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=October 12, 2010 }}</ref> Universal deferred to Howard, who had [[final cut privilege]], to decide about removing the line from the film, and the director chose to keep it.

It reported, \"Blink-and-you-miss-them television ads failed to convey the premise or provide laughs.
