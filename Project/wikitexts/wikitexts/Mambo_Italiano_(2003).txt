Both the play and the film are based on Galluccio's own life and experiences.\n\n==Plot==\nAngelo Barberini is the oddball son of [[Italian people|Italian]] immigrants Gino and Maria, who inadvertently ended up in Canada rather than the United States. Angelo shocks his parents&nbsp;\u2013 and his sister, Anna&nbsp;\u2013 by moving out on his own without getting married, and, shortly after that, shocks them further still when he [[Coming out|reveals]] he is [[homosexuality|gay]]. But his boyfriend (and childhood best friend), policeman Nino Paventi, isn't as ready to come out of the [[Coming out|closet]]&nbsp;\u2013 especially not to his busybody [[Sicily#People|Sicilian]] mother, Lina.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Luke Kirby]] as Angelo Barberini\n* [[Claudia Ferri]] as Anna Barberini\n* [[Peter Miller (actor)|Peter Miller]] as Nino Paventi\n* [[Paul Sorvino]] as Gino Barberini\n* [[Ginette Reno]] as Maria Barberini\n* [[Mary Walsh (actress)|Mary Walsh]] as Lina Paventi\n* [[Sophie Lorain]] as Pina Lunetti\n* Tim Post as Peter\n* Tara Nicodemo as Yolanda/Woman in Airplane/Jolene\n* [[Pierrette Robitaille]] as Rosetta\n* [[Dino Tavarone]] as Giorgio\n* [[Mark Camacho]] as Johnny Christofaro\n* Michel Perron as Father Carmignani\n* Lou Vani as Marco\n* Diane Lavall\u00e9e as M\u00e9lanie\n\n==Production==\nMambo Italiano was based on a play by Steve Galluccio, which was written based on his own real-life experiences growing up in an immigrant community in Montreal.<ref name=\"Ryll 2014\">{{cite web |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-mambo-italiano/ |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, Mambo Italiano |author=Alexander Ryll | publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Mambo Italiano'' received mixed to negative reviews, currently holding a 32% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the consensus states: \"A broad, shrill comedy that plays like a sitcom.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|mambo_italiano|Mambo Italiano}} Retrieved October 10, 2012</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 41/100 rating, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref>{{Metacritic film|title=Mambo Italiano}} Retrieved October 10, 2012</ref>\n\nScott Brown from [[Entertainment Weekly]] wrote \"This is feel-good filmmaking, to be sure, but the culture clash here is more than a meaningless vehicle for fizzy wish fulfillment.
