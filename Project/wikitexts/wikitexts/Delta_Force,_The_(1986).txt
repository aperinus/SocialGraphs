Directed, co-written and co-produced by [[Menahem Golan]], the film features [[Martin Balsam]], [[Joey Bishop]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]], [[Robert Forster]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[George Kennedy]], and an uncredited [[Liam Neeson]] in an early role.<ref name=\"The Delta Force\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24009/Delta-Force-The/|title=The Delta Force|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> It is the first installment in ''The Delta Force'' film series. Two sequels were produced, entitled ''[[Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection]]'' and the direct-to-video ''[[Delta Force 3: The Killing Game]]''. ''The Delta Force'' was \"inspired\" by the hijacking of [[TWA Flight 847]].<ref name=ebert/>\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1980, [[Operation Eagle Claw]] is aborted after a fatal helicopter crash, with the U.S. [[Delta Force]] evacuating to their [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] transports. Among them is Captain Scott McCoy, who, against orders, rescues his wounded comrade, Peterson, from the burning helicopter before the team finally evacuates. McCoy expresses his disgust for the politicians and the military hierarchy that forced the mission to launch despite the risks, and announces his resignation.\n\n5 years later, in 1985 a group of [[palestinian]] terrorists hijack American Travelways Airlines Flight 282, a [[Boeing 707]] flying from [[Cairo]] to [[New York City]] via [[Athens]] and [[Rome]]. Taking all 144 passengers and crew hostage on the Athens-Rome leg, the New World Revolutionary Organization, led by two terrorists named Abdul Rafai and Mustafa, force Captain Roger Campbell and his crew to fly the 707 to [[Beirut]], where they make demands to the United States government that, if not met, will result in the death of each of the hostages. During the crisis, they segregate the [[Jewish]] passengers from the Americans by forcing a reluctant flight purser of German heritage named Ingrid Harding to identify them. A Catholic priest, William O'Malley, joins the Jews in solidarity. Unbeknownst to the authorities, the Jewish hostages are then taken off the plane and transported to a militant-controlled area of [[Beirut]], while a dozen additional henchmen are brought on board.\n\nThe flight departs for [[Algiers]], where the terrorists release the female hostages and children. Meanwhile, Delta Force, led by Colonel Nick Alexander and a recalled-to-duty and newly promoted-to-Major McCoy are deployed to resolve the crisis. Once the female hostages are evacuated, they launch their assault, only to discover too late that there are additional hijackers on board. When the Delta Force blow their cover, Abdul kills a [[Navy diver (United States Navy)|U.S. Navy Diver]] named Tom Hale. He then forces the pilots to return to Beirut and takes the remaining male passengers with him.\n\nUpon returning to Beirut, the terrorists transport the passengers to a separate location, while the pilots and two male flight attendants remain in the 707. Working with a sympathetic [[Greek Orthodox]] priest, Israeli Army Intelligence prepares an operation to free the hostages. McCoy and Peterson are able to enter into Lebanon disguised as a [[Canadian]] television crew. In a prolonged campaign against the terrorists, the Delta Force bide their time to identify the terrorist leaders and locate the hostages. Once the hostages are located, Delta Force assaults the terrorist holdouts, freeing the hostages and evacuating them to the airport. During the battle, McCoy, Peterson, and their team hunt for Abdul and the Jewish hostages. They kill most of the militants but Abdul gravely injures Peterson and flees. While the commandos tend to Peterson, McCoy chases Abdul and tracks him down to an abandoned home. He then engages him in a vicious hand-to-hand fight, breaking Abdul's arm. As the terrorist leader prepares to shoot McCoy, he is killed when McCoy launches a rocket into his car.\n\nWith the hostages and rescue teams secured, the team seizes Flight 282 by secretly infiltrating the airfield through a cotton plantation. Using silenced weapons, Alexander and the Delta team kill the terrorist guards and save the crew. They board the 707 with all of the hostages, taking off to Israel just as McCoy storms the runway on his motorcycle; managing to board after destroying several terrorist jeeps. On board, the team tends to the wounded passengers and the dying Peterson. After having confirmed the hostages are safe and en route home, Peterson says his farewells to McCoy before succumbing to his wounds. In the main cabin the ex-hostages and Delta commandos join in a rousing rendition of \"America The Beautiful\", not knowing about Peterson's death, except for Alexander, Bobby, McCoy, and O'Malley. In Israel, the Boeing 707 lands safely and the hostages are greeted by their families, while Delta Force disembarks with Peterson's body in tow to their C-130. The team concludes their operation and departs for the United States amidst celebrations by the people.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[Image:Chuck Norris, The Delta Force 1986.jpg|thumb|upright=0.60|Chuck Norris on the film set.]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chuck Norris]] as Major Scott McCoy, the deputy commander of the Delta Force unit.\n* [[Lee Marvin]] as Colonel Nick Alexander, the commander of the Delta Force unit.\n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as General Woodbridge, US general, [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]].\n* [[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]] as Bobby, a member of the Delta Force unit and a friend of Scott.\n* William Wallace as Pete Peterson, a member of the unit who dies near the end of the film.\n* Jerry Weinstock as Dr. Jack, the military doctor of the unit.\n* [[Shaike Ophir]] as Father Nicholas, a Greek-Orthodox [[hieromonk]] who provides intelligence to the Israelis.\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as Delta Force member (uncredited extra)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warpedfactor.com/2016/03/1986-looking-back-at-delta-force.html |title = Looking Back At THE DELTA FORCE - Warped Factor - Words in the Key of Geek.}}</ref>\n* [[Mykelti Williamson]] as Delta Force member (uncredited extra)\n* [[Robert Forster]] as Abdul Rafai, the leader of the terrorist group.\n* David Menahem as Mustafa, member of the terrorist group.\n* Avi Loziah as Jaffar, another member of the terrorist group.\n* [[Uri Gavriel]] as Jamil Rafai, commander of the military terrorist group.\n* Adiv Gahshan as Salim, member of the military terrorist group.\n* [[Bo Svenson]] as [[John Leigh Testrake|Captain Roger Campbell]]\n* [[Hanna Schygulla]] as [[Uli Derickson|Flight purser Ingrid Harding]]\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Ben Kaplan\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Edie Kaplan\n* [[Joey Bishop]] as Harry Goldman\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Sylvia Goldman\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Father William O'Malley\n* [[Kim Delaney]] as Sister Mary\n* [[Chelli Goldenberg]] as Tina\n* [[Charles Grant (actor)|Charles Floye]] as U.S. Navy Diver Tom Hale\n* [[Howard Jackson (kickboxer)|Howard Jackson]] as Ed\n* Jerry Lazarus as Robert Levine\n* [[Susan Strasberg]] as Debra Levine\t\n* Natalie Roth as Ellen Levine\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAt the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, Cannon announced they would make ''Delta Force'' with their two most popular stars, [[Chuck Norris]] and [[Charles Bronson]].<ref>AT CANNES, AN AMERICAN RESURGENCE: [THIRD Edition]\nCarr, Jay.

The Athens, Beirut, Algiers, and Tel Aviv airport scenes were filmed at [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and its military portion, [[Lod Air Force Base]], although one Athens airport scene where an accomplice of the hijackers exits a taxi, was filmed at the eastern terminal of Ellinikon International Airport while the Athens airport concourse (interior) scenes were filmed in Ben Gurion's present-day Terminal (then the main terminal). [[Jaffa]] was used for scenes of the siege and hostage rescue in the Beirut countryside including midnight oceanic scenes.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The film's budget was $9 million.{{sfn|Andrew|1987|page=189}}\n\n===Vehicles===\nThe [[Lockheed C-130H Hercules]] in the film actually belonged to the [[Israeli Air Force]], registered as 89\u20139106. It was lent to the Golan-Globus company for filming after it was given a false registration, 14X-FBB and U.S. Air Force designs. Its lease arrangement was similar to [[Iron Eagle]], wherein the United States Air Force refused to participate due to a long-standing policy about not cooperating on any film involving the theft of an aircraft, causing the filmmakers to turn to the Israeli Air Force for the necessary aerial sequences. The army vehicles for the military and terrorists came from the [[U.S. Army]] and [[Israel Defense Forces]].\n\nThe Boeing 707-139(B) with the registration N778PA, was operated by several airlines including [[Olympic Airways]], [[Aer Lingus]], [[Saudia]], [[Turkish Airlines]], [[Pan American World Airways]], which operated it as Clipper Skylark from 1962 to 1976. Prior to filming in 1985, the aircraft had been operated by Israeli charter-operator MAOF Air and was retired from commercial service in December 1984. The aircraft was then leased to Golan-Globus Productions in late 1985 while in storage at Tel Aviv (just after the TWA-847 hijacking) and repainted with the fake airline name ''\"American Transworld Airlines\"'' while retaining the MAOF livery, but later changed to ''\"American Travelways Airlines\"'' to avoid confusion and legal action. Upon completion of the film, it was sold to Jet Avionic Systems Incorporated on May 28, 1985. Aerocar Aviation acquired it in January 1986 and sold it to Boeing Military Aircraft Company on March 20, 1986, to be used as a source of spares for the [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]] program. The [[U.S. Air Force]] acquired it later on and parted its vertical stabilizer and engines for the Boeing KC-135E Stratotanker. N778PA was destroyed by fire in a welding accident while in storage at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] in 1992. Portions of the airframe may still exist.\n\nThe 1985 Suzuki SP600 motorcycle used by Chuck Norris was designed by [[Suzuki]] specifically for the film. After modifying it and adding the weaponry, Suzuki America gave the bike to Golan-Globus production in Israel prior to filming.\n\n===Historical resemblances===\n\nThe film, although fiction, draws inspiration from two real-life events; the flight 847 hijacking and [[Operation Entebbe]]. Below are a key elements from both real-life and film.\n\n====TWA Flight 847====\n* The hijacked [[TWA 847]] took off from Athens on 14 June 1985; the film's ATW likewise departed Athens, on 19 July 1985.\n* The abbreviation of airline in the film, American Travelways Airlines, is ATW and is an anagram of [[Trans World Airlines]]. The film portrays the plane as a Boeing 707 while TWA used a [[Boeing 727]] for flight 847.\n* The airline's route is Cairo-Athens-Rome. While TWA 847 has stopovers in Boston and Los Angeles and ending in San Diego, the film's flight terminates in New York City.\n* Two terrorists hijack the flight; the third is arrested in Athens in both real-life and film.\n* The flight is managed by a [[German American]] flight purser, who is forced by the hijackers to segregate Jewish passengers from the non-Jews by identifying them through collected passports. Real-life flight attendant [[Uli Derickson]], who was the purser of TWA Flight 847, served as the basis for Ingrid Harding, the film's purser.\n* Three U.S. Navy members are onboard the flight and are held hostage; one is shot and dumped off the plane into the tarmac. While this incident happened at night in both real-life and film, the latter depicts the setting as Algiers as opposed to Beirut in the former.\n* Additional henchmen board the plane along with the released hijacker.\n\n=== Operation Entebbe ===\n* The hostage rescue scene when the commandos raid the terrorist quarters\n* A pregnant woman is on the flight.\n* A single casualty among the rescuers, near the end of the operation.\n\n==Music==\n[[Alan Silvestri]]'s electronic score gained a new life when [[ABC Sports]] used it to intro their [[List of Indianapolis 500 broadcasters|Indianapolis 500 broadcasts]] from [[1988 Indianapolis 500|1988]]\u2013[[1998 Indianapolis 500|1998]] and again in [[2001 Indianapolis 500|2001]]. It was also used for the intro of the [[Brickyard 400]] until ABC lost the race rights to [[NBC Sports]] in 2001. According to famous Indianapolis 500 anchor [[Paul Page]], he does not want any [[ESPN]]/ABC anchor to use this music in intros for the Indianapolis 500 and Brickyard 400 unless he narrates the intros himself. It is now used on the XM Satellite broadcasts of IndyCar racing events, of which Paul Page is the announcer.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe soundtrack album was initially released by Enigma Records, and later by [[Milan Records]] (minus \"The Rescue\") on an album paired with [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1985 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]''; in 2008 [[Intrada Records]] issued a limited edition CD with the entire score.
