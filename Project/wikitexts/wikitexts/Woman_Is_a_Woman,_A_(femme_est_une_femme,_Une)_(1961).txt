It is a tribute to American [[musical comedy]] and associated with the [[French New Wave]]. It is Godard's third feature film (the release of his second, ''[[Le petit soldat]]'', was delayed by censorship), and his first in color and [[Cinemascope]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film centers on the relationship of exotic dancer Ang\u00e9la and her lover \u00c9mile. Ang\u00e9la wants to have a child, but \u00c9mile is not ready. \u00c9mile's best friend Alfred also says he loves Ang\u00e9la, and keeps up a gentle pursuit. Ang\u00e9la and \u00c9mile argue about the matter; at one point they decide not to speak to each other, so continue their argument by pulling books from the shelf and pointing to the titles. Since \u00c9mile stubbornly refuses her request for a child, Ang\u00e9la finally decides to accept Alfred's plea and sleeps with him. This proves that she will do what she must to have a child. She and \u00c9mile finally reconcile, so he has a chance to become the father. The two have sex, then engage in a bit of wordplay that gives the film its title: an exasperated \u00c9mile says \"''Ang\u00e9la, tu es inf\u00e2me''\" (\"Angela, you are horrid\"), and she retorts, \"''Non, je suis une femme''\" (\"No, I am a woman\").<ref>{{cite book |title=Everything Is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf_uKU6bYRYC&pg=PA110 |first=Richard |last=Brody |year=2008|isbn = 9780805068863}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anna Karina]] as Angela\n* [[Jean-Claude Brialy]] as \u00c9mile R\u00e9camier\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Alfred Lubitsch \n* [[Henri Attal]] as false blind man #2 (uncredited)\n* [[Karyn Balm]] as (uncredited)\n* [[Doroth\u00e9e Blank]] as prostitute 3 (uncredited)\n* [[Marie Dubois]] as Angela's friend (uncredited)\n* [[Ernest Menzer]] as bar owner (uncredited)\n* [[Jeanne Moreau]] as woman in bar (herself)\n* [[Nicole Paquin]] as Suzanne (uncredited)\n* [[Gis\u00e8le Sandr\u00e9]] as prostitute 2 (uncredited)\n* [[Marion Sarraut]] as prostitute 1 (uncredited)\n* [[Dominique Zardi]] as false blind man #1 (uncredited)\n==Awards==\n* [[11th Berlin International Film Festival]]<ref name=\"berlinale 1961\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1961/03_preistr_ger_1961/03_Preistraeger_1961.html |title=Berlinale 1961: Prize Winners |access-date=2010-01-24 |work=berlinale.de |archive-date=2016-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322181439/https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1961/03_preistr_ger_1961/03_Preistraeger_1961.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n** [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]] (Karina - won)\n** Silver Bear Extraordinary Jury Prize (won)\n** [[Golden Bear]] (nominated)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0055572}}\n* {{AllMovie title|55077}}\n* [https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/330-a-woman-is-a-woman ''A Woman Is a Woman''], an essay by [[J.
