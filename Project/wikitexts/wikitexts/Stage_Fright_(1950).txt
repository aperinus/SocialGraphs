The cast also features [[Alastair Sim]], [[Sybil Thorndike]], [[Kay Walsh]], Hitchcock's daughter [[Pat Hitchcock]] in her film debut, and [[Joyce Grenfell]] in a [[Sketch comedy|vignette]].\n\nThe story was adapted for the screen by [[Whitfield Cook]] and [[Alma Reville]] (the director's wife), with additional dialogue by [[James Bridie]], based on the 1947 novel ''[[Man Running]]'' by [[Selwyn Jepson]].\n\n==Plot==\nEve Gill is an aspiring actress at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London. She is interrupted in rehearsal by her friend (and crush), actor Jonathan Cooper, the secret lover of flamboyant stage actress and singer Charlotte Inwood. Via a flashback, he says Charlotte visited him after killing her husband; she was wearing a bloodstained dress. Jonathan claims he went back to her house for another dress but was seen by Nellie Goode, Charlotte's [[Cockney]] maid and [[Dresser (theatre)|dresser]]. He escaped the police and needs help.\n\nEve takes him to her father's house on the coast to hide. Commodore Gill notices that the blood on Charlotte's dress has been smeared on deliberately; he and Eve think that Charlotte framed Jonathan. Jonathan angrily destroys the dress and, thus, the most useful piece of evidence.\n\nEve starts to investigate. She hears Charlotte's dresser Nellie Goode boasting about her newfound notoriety in a bar. While she is there, Eve meets Detective Inspector Wilfred O. Smith, and they become friendly. Eve then poses as a reporter; she bribes Nellie to tell Charlotte she is ill and introduce her cousin \"Doris Tinsdale\" as a replacement. Using her acting skills, Eve becomes \"Doris\" and starts working for Charlotte. Eve discovers Charlotte is having an affair with her manager Freddie Williams.\n\nEve and \"Ordinary\" Smith become more friendly. When Smith visits Charlotte, Eve has to disguise the fact that she is also \"Doris\", the maid. Smith makes a courtship visit to Eve and her mother at home, where the Commodore drops subtle hints that Jonathan has left the seaside house.\n\nDespite her widowed status, Charlotte continues to perform her [[West End theatre|West End]] musical show. Jonathan comes to her dressing room, asking her to accompany him abroad. She casually tells him no, but he says he still has the bloodstained dress. The police search for Jonathan and Eve again helps him escape. He hides at the Gills' London residence. He is grateful to Eve, but she is starting to fall in love with Detective Smith.\n\nSmith and Eve kiss in a taxi on the way to the RADA garden party, where Nellie Goode confronts Eve, demanding more blackmail money. Eve does not have enough, so Eve's father comes to give Nellie more cash. Freddie Williams spots Eve (thinking she is \"Doris\") and orders her to help Charlotte, who is to sing onstage in a tent. During the performance, Commodore Gill gets a small boy to carry a doll wearing a bloodstained dress onto the stage as Charlotte sings \"[[La Vie en rose]]\". Disturbed, Charlotte collapses, and \"Doris\" has to help.\n\nSeeing this, Smith confronts Eve and the Commodore, but Eve proclaims her true affection for Smith as well as Jonathan's innocence. They persuade Smith to set Charlotte up. Once the theatre has closed, they use a hidden microphone, and \"Doris\" tells Charlotte she has the bloodstained dress. Smith and his men listen using the theatre loudspeakers. Charlotte admits planning her husband's death but says that Jonathan actually committed the murder. Charlotte offers Eve [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]10,000 to keep quiet.\n\nEve sees that Jonathan has been brought to the theatre by the police, but he escapes. Charlotte realises her conversation with Eve was broadcast to the detectives and that she will be charged as an accessory to murder. Detective Smith tells the Commodore that Jonathan really did kill Mr. Inwood and that Jonathan killed before, though he got off on a plea of self-defense.\n\nHiding below the stage, Jonathan confesses to Eve that Charlotte goaded him into killing her husband. His flashback story was all lies, and he was the one who smeared more blood onto the dress. He alludes to killing Eve to justify a plea for insanity in court. Eve pretends to help Jonathan escape but locks him onto the stage and alerts the police about his presence. As Jonathan is pursued from all directions and cornered, he is killed by the stage's falling [[safety curtain]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jane Wyman]] as Eve Gill\n* [[Marlene Dietrich]] as Charlotte Inwood\n* [[Michael Wilding]] as Wilfred \"Ordinary\" Smith\n* [[Richard Todd]] as Jonathan Cooper\n* [[Alastair Sim]] as Commodore Gill\n* [[Sybil Thorndike]] as Mrs. Gill\n* [[Kay Walsh]] as Nellie Goode\n* [[Miles Malleson]] as Mr. Fortesque\n* Hector MacGregor as Freddie Williams\n* [[Joyce Grenfell]] as 'Lovely Ducks'\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Morell]] as Inspector Byard\n* [[Patricia Hitchcock]] as Chubby Bannister{{efn|Patricia Hitchcock also appears as a driving [[Stunt double|double]] for Wyman.<ref name=doc>{{cite AV media |title=Hitchcock and Stage Fright |publisher=[[Warner Bros.

The only members of the cast who are not British are the two top-billed stars: Wyman and Dietrich.\n\nDietrich's costumes were designed by [[Christian Dior]], and the production featured an original [[Cole Porter]] song, \"The Laziest Gal in Town\", performed by Dietrich in a sultry fashion. Dietrich also begins a performance of [[Edith Piaf]]'s \"[[La Vie en rose]]\", but her character is unable to finish it after being startled by a Boy Scout bringing a blood-stained doll to her.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sullivan |first=Jack |chapter=Marlene Dietrich's Cabaret Cinema: Stage Fright |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W2Atc7d4XLMC&pg=PA150 |title=Hitchcock's Music |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2006 |page=150 |isbn=978-0-3001-1050-0 |via=[[Google Books]] |quote=The camera tracks a Boy Scout bringing a blood-stained doll to Charlotte's attention during her performance of Edith Piaf's 'La Vie en rose,' ...}}</ref> Dietrich was allowed an unprecedented control of her shots by Hitchcock during the filming. When asked during the filming about working with the famously controlling, and technically adept Dietrich, Hitchcock replied, \"Everything is fine. Miss Dietrich has arranged the whole thing. She has told them exactly where to place the lights and how to photograph her.\" He later said of Dietrich, \"Marlene was a professional star. She was also a professional cameraman, art director, editor, costume designer, hairdresser, makeup woman, composer, producer and director.\"\n\n''Stage Fright'' garnered some adverse publicity upon its initial release due to the \"lying flashback\" seen near the beginning of the film. However, some film critics, including those of ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', see the flashback as simply being an illustration of [[Unreliable narrator|one person's version of the events]]: the events as recounted by the character whose voice-over we hear, which was presumably Hitchcock's intention. Hitchcock realized that the scene might be misinterpreted after seeing the film edited together, but it was too late to change; he would later maintain that it was one of his greatest mistakes.<ref name=doc/> Alternatively, modern filmmaker and Hitchcock devotee [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] described it as \"almost cutting edge mystery filmmaking\".<ref name=doc/>\n\nThe film has a few extra-long takes, reminiscent of those that Hitchcock used in ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), both films produced by Hitchcock for [[Transatlantic Pictures]] in partnership with [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] and released by Warner Brothers. ''Stage Fright'' was originally intended to be a Transatlantic release, but became a Warners release instead.\n\nAccording to the biography of Dietrich by her daughter [[Maria Riva]], Dietrich was not particularly fond of Jane Wyman, perhaps because they were such opposites.<ref>{{cite book |last=Riva |first=Maria |author-link=Maria Riva |title=Marlene Dietrich by Her Daughter |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-3945-8692-2}}</ref>\n\nHoward Maxford, author of ''The A\u2013Z of Hitchcock: The Ultimate Reference Guide'', notes that some aspects of the [[Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters]] case have similarities to the plot of ''Stage Fright''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maxford|first=Howard|title=The A\u2013Z of Hitchcock: The Ultimate Reference Guide|location=London|publisher=[[B.T. Batsford]]|year=2003|page=239|isbn=978-0-7134-8738-1}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between the film and the novel==\nAlthough ''Stage Fright'' is based on Selwyn Jepson's short story \"[[Man Running]]\" (also known as \"Outrun the Constable\"), it differs in some ways. In the original story, Freddie Williams is the actual murderer.\n\n==Hitchcock's cameo==\n[[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In ''Stage Fright'', he can be seen 39 minutes into the film as a man on the street turning to look at Eve as she rehearses her scripted introduction speech to Mrs. Inwood.\n\nIn the 4 June 1950 issue of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Hitchcock stated:\n:\"In ''Stage Fright'', I have been told that my performance is quite juicy. I have been told this with a certain air of tolerance, implying that I have now achieved the maximum limits of directorial ham in the movie sandwich. It isn't true. There may have been a '[[MacGuffin]]' in my film appearance, but not a ham.\"\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reaction===\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Hitchcock \"and his writers have contrived to give a fine cast of actors some slick and entertaining things to do. But we must quietly advise you that these things, while amusing separately, build up very little sustained excitement or suspense. They are simply a wild accumulation of clever or colorful episodes, tending for the most part to the comic, without any real anxiety.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/02/24/archives/the-screen-in-review-stage-fright-new-hitchcock-picture-made-in.html |date=24 February 1950 |title=The Screen In Review |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=27 |access-date=19 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026064522/https://www.nytimes.com/1950/02/24/archives/the-screen-in-review-stage-fright-new-hitchcock-picture-made-in.html |archive-date=26 October 2018}}</ref> [[John McCarten]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' agreed, writing that \"the picture doesn't lack for comic touches, but none of its episodes ties in very closely with the succeeding one, and the result is disappointing.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McCarten |first=John |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1950/03/04/1950-03-04-084-tny-cards-000034179 |date=4 March 1950 |title=The Current Cinema |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |page=85 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' printed a more positive review, reporting that Hitchcock \"has a choice cast to put through its paces, and there's not a bad performance anywhere.
