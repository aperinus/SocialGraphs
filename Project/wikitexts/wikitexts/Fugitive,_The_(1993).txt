The film was directed by [[Andrew Davis (director)|Andrew Davis]] and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Sela Ward]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Andreas Katsulas]], and [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]. The screenplay was written by [[David Twohy]] and [[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]] from a story by Twohy. After being framed for the murder of his wife and sentenced to death, Dr. Richard Kimble escapes from custody following a bus crash and sets out to find the real killer and clear his name while being hunted by the police and a team of [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]].\n\n''The Fugitive'' premiered in Westwood on July 29, 1993 and was released in the [[United States]] and [[Sweden]] on August 6, 1993. It was a critical and commercial success, spending six weeks as the #1 film in the United States, and grossing nearly $370 million worldwide against a $44 million budget. It was the [[1993 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 1993]] domestically with an estimated 44 million tickets sold in the U.S. It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]; Jones won for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. It was followed by a 1998 spin-off, ''[[U.S. Marshals (film)|U.S. Marshals]]'', in which Jones reprised his role as Deputy Marshal Gerard along with some others of his earlier Marshals team.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. -->\nProminent [[Chicago]] vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble arrives home to find his wife, Helen, fatally injured by a man with a prosthetic arm. Kimble struggles with the killer, who escapes. The lack of evidence of a forced entry, Helen's lucrative [[life insurance]] policy, and a misunderstood [[9-1-1|911]] call result in Kimble's wrongful arrest after the cops refuse to believe his story about the killer. He is then convicted of first-degree murder and receives a death sentence.\n\nWhile being transported by bus to [[death row]], Kimble's fellow prisoners attempt an escape. In the pandemonium, two prisoners and the driver are killed, sending the bus down a ravine and into the path of an oncoming train. Kimble saves a guard, escapes the collision, and flees as the train derails. An hour and a half later, U.S. Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard and his colleagues Renfro, Biggs, Newman, and Poole arrive at the crash site and launch a massive manhunt. Kimble sneaks into a hospital, where he obtains clothes and alters his appearance. He then drives off in an ambulance and is nearly captured in a highway tunnel but slips down a storm drain. Gerard follows and corners Kimble at the edge of a spillover above a dam; Kimble proclaims his innocence, leaps into the water below, and escapes.\n\nKimble returns to Chicago to hunt for the real murderer, acquiring some money from his friend and colleague, Dr. Charles Nichols. He rents a cheap apartment and assumes the identity of a janitor to infiltrate [[Cook County Hospital]]'s prosthetic department, where he makes a list of names of male patients with prosthetic arms matching the killer's. While there, Kimble forges new medical orders for a young trauma patient who was misdiagnosed, saving his life. Kimble escapes after a suspicious doctor confronts him and alerts the police.\n\nSpeculating that Kimble has returned to Chicago to search for the one-armed man, Gerard spots Kimble at [[Chicago City Hall]], where he is investigating a jailed man on his list. Kimble barely escapes the ensuing chase and disappears into the St. Patrick's Day parade. Kimble later breaks into the residence of Fredrick Sykes; seeing a photo of Sykes, Kimble recognizes him as his wife's murderer. Sykes, a former police officer, handles security for Devlin-MacGregor, a pharmaceutical company that is releasing a new drug called Provasic. Kimble had previously analyzed the drug's test samples and discovered it caused liver damage, which should have prevented [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval.\n\nKimble deduces that Dr. Nichols, who led the drug's development and has just become a board member of Devlin-MacGregor, arranged a cover-up by falsifying the findings to get Provasic approved. Nichols arranged for Sykes to kill Kimble in a staged burglary, only for him to be surprised by Helen, killing her. He also presumably had him kill Dr. Alec Lentz, who also worked on the drug's development and discovered its potential damage. Kimble phones Gerard, who conducts his own investigation into Sykes and Nichols, starting to have doubts about Kimble's guilt. Kimble then heads to a hotel conference where Nichols is presenting Provasic. Sykes is alerted that Kimble is in Chicago and arms himself to kill him. Sykes tracks down and attacks Kimble on an [[Chicago \"L\"|\"L\" train]]. In the struggle, Sykes fatally shoots a transit cop before Kimble subdues him and handcuffs him to a pole.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kimble, the officer's death is assumed to be his fault, and the [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago Police]] issue a shoot-to-kill order on him. At the conference, Kimble publicly confronts Nichols about the drug conspiracy and the murders, which results in a fight that spills on the roof. Gerard stops a police helicopter from sniping Kimble, while both men crash through a skylight onto a descending elevator. Nichols regains consciousness and attempts to escape through the laundry room, with Kimble following him. Gerard follows with Renfro and calls out to Kimble that he knows about the conspiracy and that Kimble is innocent. Nichols knocks out Renfro, takes his gun, and tries to shoot Gerard, but Kimble attacks Nichols from behind, saving Gerard's life.\n\nKimble surrenders to Gerard, while Sykes and Nichols are arrested. Kimble is escorted out through the hotel entrance as the press questions the police about the newly found suspects, indicating Kimble's innocence. In the back of a squad car, Gerard uncuffs Kimble and offers him an ice pack; the two men are driven away into the night, with Kimble\u2019s exoneration assured.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Andreas Katsulas.jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Katsulas]] portrayed Fredrick Sykes, also known as the \"[[The Fugitive (1963 TV series)#The one-armed man|one-armed man]]\".]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as Dr. Richard Kimble\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard\n* [[Sela Ward]] as Helen Kimble\n* [[Joe Pantoliano]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal Cosmo Renfro\n* [[Andreas Katsulas]] as Fredrick Sykes\n* [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as Dr. Charles Nichols\t\t\t\n* [[Daniel Roebuck]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal Bobby Biggs\n* [[Thomas Mills Wood|Tom Wood]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal Noah Newman\n* [[L.

Instead, a number of actors were auditioned for the part, including [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Kevin Costner]], and [[Michael Douglas]]. Nolte in particular felt he was too old for the role (though he is only a year older than Ford). Although the role of Gerard went to Tommy Lee Jones, [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Jon Voight]] were both considered for the role. The character of Dr. Nichols was recast for Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 after the original actor who landed the role, [[Richard Jordan]], fell ill with a brain tumor.

[[Cheoah Dam]] in [[Deals Gap (Swain County), North Carolina|Deals Gap]] was the location of the scene in which Kimble jumps from the dam.\n\nThe rest of the film was shot in Chicago, including some of the dam scenes, which were filmed in the remains of the [[Chicago Tunnel Company|Chicago freight tunnels]]. The city hall stair chase (where Kimble narrowly escapes being apprehended by Gerard) was filmed in the corridors and lobby of [[Chicago City Hall]]. The character Sykes lived in the historic [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]] neighborhood of Chicago. Harrison Ford uses the pay phone in the Pullman Pub, and then climbs a ladder and runs down the roofline of the historic rowhouses.<ref>{{cite AV media |year=1993 |title=The Fugitive |medium=dvd |time=1:26:15 |publisher=Warner Bros. |location=Chicago, Illinois }}</ref> According to [[Andrew Davis (director)|Andrew Davis]], it was Ford's idea to film in Chicago. \"Originally I wasn't even going to try to come to Chicago. I thought that the weather would be too cold and difficult for shooting. But Harrison, having seen several of my prior films shot in Chicago, suggested doing it here.\" Ford would later explain, \"I grew up in Chicago, went to college in Wisconsin, and came back to take summer jobs for three years. I felt this was the best possible option as a location...We could get the grittiness, we could get the flash of architecture, the charm of the lake.

According to Charles Geocaris, then head of the Chicago Film Office, both productions approached the film office in February about filming during the parade. Location managers and production managers for both films worked out the logistics with parade organizers, but according to Geocaris, the two camera crews would still occasionally run into each other during their shoots. Complicating matters was the weather which was fairly cold at 21 degrees Fahrenheit (below freezing) along with a windchill factor of minus 6. Nevertheless, disruption was at a minimum, with Geocaris recalling that \"people on the parade route were laughing as Tommy Lee Jones chased Harrison Ford...It was a fun thing for them.\"<ref name=\"Geocaris\">{{cite news|last=Warren |first=Ellen |title=The 1993 parade: 'Fugitive' vs. 'Blink' |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2002-03-15-0203150287-story.html |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=15 May 2002 |access-date=5 July 2021}}</ref>\n\nCinematographer [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]] credits Davis for the film's distinctive use of [[Chicago]], which drew much praise upon its release. \"A lot of it really feels like Chicago, because it just has a native's eye to it.

Howard wasn't confident that he could match the quality of those temporary cues, but he refused to quit, eventually conceding that his score would be a \"quasi-failure.\" He was particularly dissatisfied with his work on the chase scenes, believing his string arrangements were too awkward. When he was given an Academy Award nomination, Howard said \"I was completely shocked. I just didn\u2019t think [my score] was worthy of a nomination, but that\u2019s often what happens.
