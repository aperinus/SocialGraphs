The film is based on Farrar's 1997 novel ''Watch That Man'', and the title is a parody of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1934 film ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' and his 1956 [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|remake]] of the same title.\n\n==Plot==\nWallace Ritchie flies from [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], to [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], to spend his birthday with his brother, James. James is not expecting the visit and is hosting a business dinner that night; to keep Wallace entertained, he sets him up with an interactive [[Improvisational theatre|improv theatre]] business, the \"Theatre of Life\", which promises to treat the participant as a character in a crime drama. Before the night begins, James hands Wallace a pair of Ambassador [[cigar]]s, promising to \"fire them up\" before midnight in celebration of Wally's birthday. Wallace answers a phone call intended for a [[hitman]] at the same [[payphone]] that the Theatre of Life uses for its act.\n\nThe contact, Sir Roger Daggenhurst, mistakes Wallace for Spencer, the hitman he has hired and Wallace assumes the identity. The real Spencer picks up the phone call meant for Wallace and murders one of the actors, prompting a police investigation. Daggenhurst, his assistant Hawkins, British Defense Minister Gilbert Embleton, and [[Russians|Russian]] [[Espionage|intelligence agent]] Sergei plan to detonate an explosive device (hidden in a [[Matryoshka doll]]) during a dinner between British and Russian dignitaries, in order to rekindle the [[Cold War]] and replace their aging technology.\n\nStill believing he's acting with the Theatre of Life, Wally meets Lori, Embleton's call-girl. Lori plans to blackmail Embleton for a substantial amount of money using letters that detail the plot. Spencer was hired to eliminate her and destroy the letters. Wallace scares off Embleton when he arrives to look for them and drives off Spencer. Fearing their plot will be revealed, Daggenhurst hires two more hitmen, while Sergei hires now-inactive spy Boris \"The Butcher\" Blavasky to eliminate \"Spencer\". Boris succeeds in killing the real Spencer, but Wallace and Lori return, retrieving the letters.\n\nUsing Spencer's communicator, Wallace mentions lighting up some \"big Ambassadors, at 11:59,\" referring to James' cigars. Thinking the words refer to the assassination plot, both sides believe he is an American spy who has caught on to their scheme. Daggenhurst offers Wallace and Lori 3 million British pounds in return for the letters, to be exchanged at the same hotel where the dinner is taking place. This is a ruse to capture and kill them both. All the while Wallace gets close to his \"co-star\" Lori, who confesses she'd love to study acting once they're paid.\n\nWallace contacts James and tells him to meet him at the hotel \u2013 soon after, James sees an evening news report that Wallace has murdered an actor and police are searching for him, prompting James to abandon the business dinner. Wallace and Lori are caught and held captive. Boris opts for torture by Dr. Ludmilla Kropotkin, but Wallace and Lori separate and escape before she arrives. James is captured and sent to be tortured by Dr Kropotkin. Wallace evades the hitmen and finds himself part of a group of Russian folk dancers performing for the ambassadors. During the routine, he sees the Matryoshka doll bomb, unwittingly disarms it seconds before it goes off, blocks a poison dart from Boris with it, and steals the show with his improvised dancing.\n\nRealizing their plot has failed when the bomb fails to go off, Sergei and Daggenhurst bring out two bags containing the promised \u00a33 million for Wallace and Lori and release James, who is exhausted but otherwise fine after his torture session. Boris congratulates Wallace for his impressive covert skills and gives him a souvenir pistol, telling Wallace he will continue his butcher shop business. Sergei and Daggenhurst attempt to escape with half the money and discover Wallace's doll, which they believe is only a normal one he picked out for himself. They are proven wrong when they realign the doll, reactivating the bomb and blowing them up, just as Wallace and Lori share a kiss.\n\nSome time later, on an exotic beach, Wally unwittingly incapacitates a spy, passing a test by an unknown American espionage group. Believing he is capable of being a top agent, they offer him a position on \"the team\". Thinking that they wish to make him a movie star, Wallace accepts their offer.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|* [[Bill Murray]] as Wallace Ritchie\n* [[Peter Gallagher]] as James Ritchie\n* [[Joanne Whalley]] as Lori\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Boris \"The Butcher\" Blavasky\n* [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]] as Sir Roger Daggenhurst\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Dr. Ludmilla Kropotkin\n* [[John Standing]] as Gilbert Embleton\n* [[Anna Chancellor]] as Barbara Ritchie\n* [[Nicholas Woodeson]] as Sergei\n* [[Simon Chandler]] as Hawkins\n* [[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]] as Dimitri\n* [[Cliff Parisi]] as Uri\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as Otto\n* [[Sheila Reid]] as SS Cap Woman\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Mugger}}\n\n== Production ==\nThe story and script were derived from the novel ''Watch That Man'' by the film's co-writer [[Robert Farrar]]. Farrar got the idea from a chance remark at a dinner party. Farrar said, \"Somebody told me about these strange live theater performances which were all the rage in England in the '80s. The idea was to telephone for instructions if you wanted to take part. My immediate reaction was, 'Wouldn't it be fabulous if somebody got the wrong number, and it all went hopelessly wrong?'\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=The Man Who Knew Too Little |url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-the-man-who-knew-too-little-bill-murray/3620184 |access-date=August 14, 2022 |website=[[Barnes & Noble]] |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFilming took place at a variety of London locations, including Three Mills Studios in London's East End and Elstree Film Studios.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Release ==\nReleased to theaters nationally and internationally on November 14, 1997, ''The Man Who Knew Too Little'' was financed by [[Regency Enterprises]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |date=November 17, 1997 |title=Are These Guys Still Funny? |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-nov-17-ca-54642-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=August 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220814191002/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-nov-17-ca-54642-story.html |archive-date=August 14, 2022}}</ref>\n\n=== Box office ===\nOn its opening weekend, the film grossed $4.6 million<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Man Who Knew Too Little (1997) - Financial Information |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Man-Who-Knew-Too-Little-The |access-date=2020-04-30 |website=The Numbers}}</ref> and placed at the No. 5 spot,<ref name=\":1\" /> behind the films ''[[The Jackal (1997 film)|The Jackal]]'', ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'', Disney's re-release of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', and ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]''.

An obvious takeoff on '<nowiki/>''The Man Who Knew Too Much''<nowiki/>' -- the name of the twice-filmed Alfred Hitchcock thriller (1934 and 1956) about an ordinary family plunged accidentally into international intrigue -- the title is awkward, silly and unoriginal. Just like this movie. Despite a good cast and director (Jon Amiel of '<nowiki/>''[[Sommersby]]''<nowiki/>' and TV's '''[[The Singing Detective]]''<nowiki/>')...the writers take a half-baked premise and clumsily retool it into a Murray vehicle. But they've cheated their star. Here, it isn't Murray who seems trapped where he doesn't belong, but the whole movie. Terminally unfunny, lazily unsuspenseful, uncertainly directed and full of good but stranded actors, [the film] isn't just a 'wrong man' comedy thriller. It's the wrong movie. For Murray and for us.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wilmington |first=Michael |date=November 13, 1997 |title=Very few laughs in Bill Murray's 'Man Who Knew Too Little' |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-11-14-9711140022-story.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407011705/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-11-14-9711140022-story.html |archive-date=April 7, 2022 |access-date=April 30, 2020 |website=[[Chicago Tribune]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V.
