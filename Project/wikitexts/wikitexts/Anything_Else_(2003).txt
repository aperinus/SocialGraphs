The film was shown as the opening night selection at the 60th annual [[Venice International Film Festival]]. The film was released theatrically on September 19, 2003, to mixed reviews and commercial failure.\n\n==Plot==\nJerry Falk (Biggs), an aspiring writer living in [[New York City]], has a girlfriend, Brooke (Strickland). He falls in love with Amanda (Ricci) and has an affair with her. Brooke learns of Jerry's infidelity and leaves him. Amanda leaves her own boyfriend for Jerry. Jerry turns to aging, struggling artist David Dobel (Allen, loosely based on David Panich) who acts as his mentor, which includes trying to help sort out Jerry's romantic life. Dobel says that when he told a cab driver of all his anxieties and phobias in life, the cab driver told him, \"It's like anything else\".\n\nDobel tries to convince Jerry that his manager is only holding him back and his relationship with Amanda is the most destructive force in his life. Amanda continuously cheats on Jerry. Amanda leaves and then comes back. Jerry's neuroses start to worsen. Eventually, Jerry leaves town as Dobel gets him a job writing for television in California. Amanda has an affair with the doctor who was treating her and runs off with him. He sees them together laughing as she once did with him as the cab is taking him towards the airport. Jerry talks to the cabbie of love and relationships. The cabbie simply replies, \"It's like anything else\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as David Dobel\n* [[Jason Biggs]] as Jerry Falk\n* [[Christina Ricci]] as Amanda Chase\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Harvey Wexler\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Paula Chase\n* [[Jimmy Fallon]] as Bob Stiles\n* [[KaDee Strickland]] as Brooke\n* [[Erica Leerhsen]] as Connie\n* [[David Conrad]] as Phil Reed\n* [[Adrian Grenier]] as Ray Polito\n* [[Fisher Stevens]] as Manager\n* [[Diana Krall]] as Herself\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 40%, based on reviews from 137 critics.
