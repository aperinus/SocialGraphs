The [[United States]] still has a diplomatic compound, not an official consulate, open in the city. Less than a mile away is a top secret [[CIA]] base, \"the Annex,\" which is protected by a team of [[private military company|private military contractors]] from [[Global Response Staff]] (GRS). New to the detail is former [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEAL]] Jack Silva, who arrives in Benghazi and is picked up by fellow former [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEAL]] [[Tyrone S. Woods|Tyrone \"Rone\" Woods]], the commander of the GRS team and a personal friend of Silva. Arriving at the Annex, Silva is introduced to the rest of the GRS team: former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] Mark \"Oz\" Geist, John \"Tig\" Tiegen and Dave \"Boon\" Benton and former [[United States Army Rangers|US Army Ranger]] [[Kris Paronto|Kris \"Tanto\" Paronto]] and the CIA [[Chief of Station]], \"Bob\", who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens.\n\nPrior to the US Ambassador's arrival, the GRS team members visit the [[Diplomatic mission|Special Mission]], where the Ambassador will be staying. They review the location and warn [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) Agents Scott Wickland and Dave Ubben about the risk of minimal-security arrangements and the high probability of a surprise attack due its volatile circumstances. [[U.S. Ambassador to Libya|US Ambassador]] [[J. Christopher Stevens|Chris Stevens]] arrives in Benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections amid the political and social chaos, with limited protection from five DSS Agents, principally Wickland and Ubben, along with guards hired from the local [[February 17th Martyrs Brigade]] militia, nicknamed \"17-Feb.\" On the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]], Stevens notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. Back at the Annex, Silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.\n\nThat night, a group of militants from [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]] assault the compound. The 17-Feb guards are quickly overrun, which allows the attackers easy access to the compound. Wickland takes Stevens and [[Sean Smith (diplomat)|Smith]], an IT specialist, to the safe room. Unable to breach the safe room, the attackers set the building on fire hoping to burn the men out. Wickland escapes but loses both Stevens and Smith. At the Annex, the GRS team desperately wants to go to the compound to help, but the Chief refuses for fear that the team's departure would expose the Annex. However, the team dispatches to the compound anyway and meets up with the DSS Agents, with the team splitting up: Silva, Woods, and Tiegen head to the consulate, while Paronto and Benton head to the back gate, assisted by a few 17-Feb militants. Silva and Woods enter the building searching for Stevens and Smith but find only Smith's body. After an intense firefight inside the compound against the militants, the DSS team retreats in a car, but after a beat-up Wickland goes the wrong way, they are followed by militants on their way back to the Annex. Later, the GRS team also retreats to the Annex.\n\nKnowing that an attack by the militants is imminent, the CIA staff of the Annex makes several desperate calls for help, but only former [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEAL]] [[Glen Doherty|Glen \"Bub\" Doherty]], a GRS operator in [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]], helps. He forms a team, including two [[Delta Force]] operators, that flies to Benghazi after several delays. Meanwhile, the GRS team fends off the militants as they try to breach the Annex perimeter. After repelling the largest attack wave, the Annex receives word from [[intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance|ISR]] that help is coming.\n\nThe Tripoli GRS reinforcements arrive and begin to prepare the CIA and DSS staff for their departure to the airport. The militants launch a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attack in which Ubben and Geist are wounded, and Geist's left arm is partially severed. Woods rushes to aid Geist and is killed by another mortar round. Doherty is also killed when a third mortar detonates directly in front of him.\n\nWhile a wounded Geist and Ubben are being tended to, Delta Force operatives dispose of Woods' body, angering Silva. With the GRS team compromised and the Annex now vulnerable, the remaining GRS operators watch as a convoy of vehicles rolls toward the Annex. Fearing the worst, the operators prepare to make a [[final stand]] until it is revealed that the convoy is an element of the [[Libya Shield Force]] militia that is escorting the GRS reinforcements. They also find out that Stevens had been found behind the compound but was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nAt the airport, the CIA staff and the wounded Geist board the plane to Tripoli while the remainder of the GRS team waits for the next plane with the bodies of Stevens, Smith, Woods, and Doherty. Paronto is approached by his 17-Feb allies and gives them some keys to Gaddafi's old armored vehicles. Meanwhile, Silva speaks with his wife and tells her that he is finally coming home; however, he tearfully admits that Woods didn't make it and isn't coming home. Shortly after, he briefly recalls a conversation with Woods they had at the annex and zips his bodybag up. Closing titles reveal that all of the surviving members of the Annex security GRS team received contractor medals at a private ceremony, have since retired from the GRS team, and live with their families and that Geist was able to save his arm after several surgeries after re-enlisting.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== GRS Team ===\n* [[John Krasinski]]<ref name=\"KrasinskiCast\" /> as Jack Silva, newest member of the team and former [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEAL]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/01/13-hours-benghazi-fictionalized/ |title=Benghazi as Zombieland |publisher=National Review |date=January 15, 2016 |access-date=December 29, 2020 |archive-date=April 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423064412/https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/01/13-hours-benghazi-fictionalized/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[James Badge Dale]]<ref name=\"DaleCast\" /> as [[American fatalities and injuries of the 2012 Benghazi attack#Tyrone S.

In the film's most controversial scene, the CIA chief in Benghazi (identified only as \"Bob\") tells the military contractors there when they seek permission to go defend the embassy to \"stand down\" and thus denies them permission. The real-life CIA chief stated that there was no stand-down order, but multiple sources who were willing to identify themselves have refuted the still-unnamed CIA chief.<ref name=Beauchamp>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/15/10774928/13-hours-benghazi-michael-bay|title=Michael Bay's 13 Hours promotes some of the worst Benghazi conspiracy theories|first=Zack|last=Beauchamp|date=January 15, 2016|work=Vox|access-date=January 17, 2016|archive-date=January 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117050550/http://www.vox.com/2016/1/15/10774928/13-hours-benghazi-michael-bay|url-status=live}}</ref> However, no help was sent even though officials at the highest levels had found out about the attack within the first few hours out of the 13.
