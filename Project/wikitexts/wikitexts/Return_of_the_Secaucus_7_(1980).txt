Frances (Cousineau), now in medical school, drives in with her old boyfriend, wannabe folk singer J.T. (LeFevre), who she found hitchhiking to the gathering. Irene (Passanante), a speechwriter for a  Democratic U.S. senator, arrives with her conservative boyfriend, Chip (Clapp), who did not attend college with the others. Maura (Trott) says that she and Jeff (Arnott) are no longer a couple, which shocks the others and causes a somewhat uneasy first evening. Maura and J.T. are mutually attracted and have sex that night while Frances is nearby. The group attends a play that their old friend, Lacey, is acting in. Katie heckles Lacey, annoying Mike.\n\nJeff arrives and is apparently unaware that Maura has ended their relationship. This further strains the group's cohesion, especially when J.T. tells Jeff  he had sex with Maura, believing she was single. Jeff acknowledges being angry at J.T., but it does not end their friendship. After playing basketball and skinny-dipping with Mike's high school friends, Ron (Strathairn) and Howie (Sayles), the group goes to a bar. Jeff and Maura get into a loud argument and Ron make a pass at Frances, who is upset that J.T. and Maura were intimate. Ron and Frances leave for a local hotel, while Maura leaves by herself, and the rest of the group drives separately. Out on the road, the group come upon a deer carcass. An undercover cop arrests them on suspicion of illegal game hunting. While sitting in lock-up, the group recounts their various arrests during their college years and the formation of their nickname, the \"Secaucus 7\". A local drunk confesses to hitting the deer, and everyone is released. The following day, the group leaves one-by-one, and J.T. insists on hitchhiking to Boston, refusing money from Maura for a bus ticket. Jeff is left alone, and angrily chops wood on Mike's property. The film ends with Mike and Katie finding a farewell note from Jeff reading, \"I'm sorry. --Jeff\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Bruce MacDonald as Mike Donnelly\n* [[Maggie Renzi]] as Katie Sipriano\n* [[Adam LeFevre]] as J.T.\n* Maggie Cousineau as Frances Carlson\n* [[Gordon Clapp]] as Chip Hollister\n* [[Jean Passanante]] as Irene Rosenblum\n* Karen Trott as Maura Tolliver\n* Mark Arnott as Jeff Andrews\n* [[David Strathairn]] as Ron Desjardins\n* [[John Sayles]] as Howie\n* Marisa Smith as Carol\n* Amy Schewel as Lacey Summers\n* Carolyn Brooks as Meg\n* Eric Forsythe as Captain\n* Nancy Mette as Lee\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n[[Film criticism|Film critic]] Emanuel Levy liked the film and wrote, \"The movie became influential, launching a cycle of \"reunion\" films, which included ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' and the TV series ''[[Thirtysomething]]''. As a portrait of disenchantment, ''Return'' was more authentic and honest than Lawrence Kasdan's star-studded ''Big Chill''...A rueful movie about unexceptional lives that have prematurely grown stale, ''Secaucus'' is a bit commonplace, lacking genuine drama. But Sayles uses effectively a discursive, episodic format; he constructs strong scenes with resonant dialogue. The characters are complex and individually distinguished by speech, gesture, and manner.\"<ref>[http://emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=2363 Levy, Emanuel]. ''Emanuel Levy Film Reviews,'' 2004\u20132008. Accessed: February 25, 2008.</ref>\n\nCritic Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat wrote, \"Here's a nice little movie about the baby boom generation...Novelist John Sayles wrote, directed, and edited this movie. It is a labor of love. We watch these laidback individuals share their stories and reminisce about the past...But these baby boomers can't handle tension; the rift between Jeff and Maura sends tremors through the weekend. And although they put up a front of having a good time, one senses that things haven't turned out well for them \u2014 either in terms of meaningful relationships or in terms of personal fulfillment. ''Return of the Secaucus Seven'' leaves one with a rueful feeling about this generation.\"<ref>[http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/films.php?id=7652 Brussat, Frederic and Mary Ann].

Most $60,000 movies play at two film festivals, then end up on a 16-millimeter projector in their director's living room. ''The Return of the Secaucus Seven,'' about seven antiwar activists who spend a weekend together 10 years later, was the surprise hit of last spring's [[Los Angeles]] [[Filmex|Filmex festival]]. The movie was also selected as one of the 10 best films of 1980 by [[The Boston Globe]], [[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]] and [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]], and last week it was nominated by the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] as best comedy written directly for the screen. When it opened an unsuccessful commercial run in New York last September, [[Vincent Canby]], although expressing some reservations, praised the film as ''sweet and engaging'' and ''an honest, fully realized movie.''
