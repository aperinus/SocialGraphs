The film was directed by [[Daniel Mann]], written by Hal Fimberg and [[Ben Starr]] (from a story by Hal Fimberg), and starred [[James Coburn]] as master spy [[Derek Flint]]. The main premise of the film is that a trio of \"[[mad scientist]]s\" attempt to [[blackmail]] the world with a weather-control machine. A sequel, ''[[In Like Flint]]'', was released the following year, with Coburn reprising his role.\n\n==Plot==\nSpy extraordinaire [[Derek Flint]] is an ex-agent of Z.O.W.I.E. (Zonal Organization World Intelligence Espionage) who is brought out of retirement to deal with the threat of ''Galaxy'', a worldwide organization led by a trio of mad scientists: Doctor Krupov, Doctor Wu, and Doctor Schneider.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=107}}</ref> Impatient that the world's governments will never improve, the scientists demand that all nations capitulate to Galaxy. To enforce their demands, they initiate earthquakes, volcanoes, storms and other natural disasters with their climate-control apparatus, for the only purpose to bring the nations to give up weapons and nuclear energy.\n\nInitially reluctant, Flint decides to take them on after a preemptive assassination attempt by Galaxy's section head, Gila, who replaces a restaurant's harpist while Flint is dining with his four live-in \"playmates\"&nbsp;\u2014 Leslie, Anna, Gina, and Sakito. Gila uses a harp string as a bow to fire a poisoned dart, which misses Flint, but hits his former boss, Cramden.\n\nFlint squeezes the poison out of the wound, saving Cramden's life. A chemical trace on the dart directs Flint to [[Marseille]] for [[bouillabaisse]]. In one of Marseille's lowest clubs he stages a brawl to gain some useful information from \"famous\" Agent 0008, who is investigating the narcotics trade keeping Galaxy in business.\n\nGalaxy agent Hans Gruber is in the club enjoying his favorite soup while waiting to rendezvous with Gila. Gila sends Gruber to ambush Flint in the lavatory. Flint ends up killing Gruber in a toilet stall, while Gila escapes, leaving behind a [[cold cream]] jar she has [[Booby trap|booby-trapped]] with explosives. Flint detects the trap and chases the bystanders from the club before detonating the bomb.\n\nThe remains of the jar lead Flint to [[Rome]]. After investigating several cosmetic companies, Flint arrives at Exotica, where he actually meets Gila for the first time. Gila lets him come to her apartment for an exchange of information. Following their encounter, he steals the keys to Exotica and breaks into the company's safe, learning of Galaxy's location before being trapped inside by Gila's assistant, Malcolm Rodney. Malcolm and Gila assume that Flint will soon run out of air in the safe as they transport it to a waiting submarine. During the journey, Flint learns that his playmates have been kidnapped and taken to the headquarters on Galaxy Island in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHe then uses his power of self-induced [[suspended animation]] to fool his captors into thinking they have successfully killed him. Gila and Rodney take an evidence photograph of the \"body\", which they send to Cramden, then carry Flint back to headquarters on the submarine.\n\nFlint revives and sneaks into the Galaxy complex, but his infiltration is thwarted and he is taken before Galaxy's trio of leaders. Offered a chance to join their new order, he refuses, and is sentenced to death by disintegration.\n\nGila's failure to eliminate Flint results in her being stripped of her leadership role and reassigned to become a Pleasure Unit&nbsp;\u2013 a fate which has already befallen Flint's playmates. She then changes sides, slipping Flint his gadget-filled cigarette lighter before she is hauled away. With the help of the lighter, Flint again escapes, sabotages the machinery, rescues his playmates and Gila, and departs the island as it disintegrates.\n\nFlint and the women are picked up by a waiting American warship, as they watch a volcano erupt on the island. Gila presumably joins the other four women living with Flint. In the sequel, when Flint is again called out of retirement for a mission, he is living with three women, saying that \"five was just too many.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[James Coburn]] as Derek Flint\n* [[Lee J. Cobb]] as Cramden\n* [[Gila Golan]] as Gila\n* [[Edward Mulhare]] as Malcolm Rodney\n* [[Benson Fong]] as Dr. Schneider\n* [[Shelby Grant]] as Leslie\n* [[Sigrid Valdis]] as Anna\n* Gianna Serra as Gina\n* Helen Funai as Sakito\n* [[Michael St. Clair]] as Hans Gruber\n* [[Rhys Williams (Welsh actor)|Rhys Williams]] as Dr. Krupov\n* [[Russ Conway (actor)|Russ Conway]] as American General\n* Ena Hartman as [[Women's Army Corps|WAC]]\n* [[Bill Walker (actor)|William Walker]] as American Diplomat\n* [[Peter Brocco]] as Dr. Wu\n}}\n\nThe uncredited actor playing the overseer of the Pleasure Unit process is [[Dick Wilson]], who later gained fame as \"Mr. Whipple\" in a long string of commercials for [[Charmin]] toilet paper. The voice of then-President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was provided by [[Van Williams]], who provided the same voice over effect later that year, in the film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman: The Movie]]''.\n\n==Production==\nCoburn later said \"\u201cI credit the producer, Saul David, for the Flint films. He was responsible for the whole thing. He also cast me in the role. Of course, it was a spoof of the Bond and all the other spy films released at the time. What I liked about Flint was that he was his own man. He trained himself. We tried to work from that theme. It must have worked&nbsp;... after all the film was a very big hit.\u201d<ref>{{Cite magazine | magazine=Psychotronic Video|title=James Coburn Seven and Seven Is | first=Lowell|last=Goldman|number=9|date=Spring 1991|page=21|url=https://archive.org/details/Psychotronic_Video_09/page/n23/mode/1up?q=patman}}</ref>\n\n==Influences==\nThe film contains direct nods to [[James Bond]] in a comedic and outlandish style. Flint is initially offered a [[Walther PP#PPK|Walther PPK]] and an [[Briefcase|attache case]] with a concealed throwing knife with Flint dismissing both as \"crude\".\nDuring the French strip club sequence, Flint stages a mock brawl with a patron who is identified as Agent 0008, a British secret agent. Flint asks if [[SPECTRE]] (the criminal organization in the early Bond movies) is involved, to which Agent 0008 replies, \"It's bigger than SPECTRE!\" The actor playing the role is similar in appearance to [[Sean Connery]]. Later in the film, Gila is shown reading a 0008 novel, a reference to the James Bond novels.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n20th Century Fox's house composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]] composed the film's score. The film's original soundtrack LP were rerecorded slower arrangements of the score, a DVD of the surviving elements of the two Flint films were later released.\n\n[[Herbie Mann]] covered the title theme, \"Our Man Flint\" on his 1966 album, ''[[Our Mann Flute]]''. Many other [[cover version]]s of the theme music were recorded during the mid-1960s, including [[Roland Shaw]], [[Billy Strange]] and [[The Challengers (band)|The Challengers]] with [[Hugo Montenegro]]'s version including the Presidential telephone's ringtone. [[Wall of Voodoo]] used the theme tune in the 2nd half of their version of \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\".\n\n==Cultural legacy==\nThe distinctive [[ringtone]] of Cramden's \"presidential hotline\"<ref>{{YouTube | id=CokN5HgyfD8 | title=Flint presidential telephone ringtone SFX (clean)}}</ref> telephone was re-used in the films ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'', ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' and in Seattle children's television program, ''[[J. P. Patches|The J.P. Patches Show]]''. Popular Los Angeles [[KIIS-FM]] disc jockey [[Rick Dees]] used the sound effect as the \"hotline\" phone sound whenever the station manager would call and yell at him during his 1980s and 1990s shows.\n\nA 1965 [[novelization]] of the film by Jack Pearl includes much material not seen on the screen that may have been taken from an earlier draft of the screenplay.\n\nThe name Hans Gruber was reused in two later films, ''[[Re-Animator]]'' and ''[[Die Hard]]''.\n\nClips of audio from the film are sampled in [[The Desert Sessions]] song \"Sugar Rush\" on the album [[Volumes 3 & 4]].\n\n==Reception==\n''Our Man Flint'' received generally positive reviews, having a \"Fresh\" score of 77% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 30 critics.\n\n===Box office===\nAccording to Fox records, the film needed to earn $7,700,000 to break even and made $12,950,000 at the box office.<ref>{{cite book|page=325|title=The Fox that got away : the last days of the Zanuck dynasty at Twentieth Century-Fox|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M|year=1988|publisher=L.
