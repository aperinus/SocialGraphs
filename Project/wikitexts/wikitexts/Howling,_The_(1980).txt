It is based on the [[The Howling|novel of the same name]] by [[Gary Brandner]]. The film stars [[Dee Wallace]], [[Patrick Macnee]], [[Dennis Dugan]], and [[Robert Picardo]].\n\n''The Howling'' was released in the United States on March 13, 1981, and became a moderate success, grossing $17.9 million at the [[box office]]. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for the makeup special effects by [[Rob Bottin]]. The film won the 1980 [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] while still in development, and was one of the three high-profile werewolf-themed horror films released in 1981, alongside ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' and ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]''.\n\nIts financial success aided Dante's career, and prompted [[Warner Bros.]] to hire Dante (as director) and [[Michael Finnell]] (as producer) for ''[[Gremlins]]''. A [[The Howling (franchise)|series]] consisting of seven sequels arose from the film's success. A remake is in development, with [[Andy Muschietti]] set to direct.\n\n==Plot==\nKaren White is a [[Los Angeles]] television news anchor who is being stalked by [[serial killer]] Eddie Quist. In cooperation with the police, she takes part in a scheme to capture Eddie by agreeing to meet him in a sleazy [[Pornographic film|porn]] [[theater]]. Eddie forces Karen to watch a video of a young woman being bound and raped, and when Karen turns around to see Eddie, she screams. The police enter and shoot Eddie, and although Karen is safe, she suffers [[amnesia]]. Her therapist, Dr. George Waggner, decides to send her and her husband, Bill Neill, to the \"Colony\", a secluded resort in the countryside where he sends patients for treatment.\n\nThe Colony is filled with strange characters, and one, a sultry [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] named Marsha, tries to seduce Bill. When he resists her unsubtle sexual overtures, he is attacked and scratched on the arm by a werewolf while returning to his cabin. After Bill's attack, Karen summons her friend, Terri Fisher, to the Colony, and Terri connects the resort to Eddie through a sketch he left behind, having previously discovered that Eddie's body disappeared from the [[morgue]]. Karen begins to suspect that Bill is hiding a secret far more threatening than [[marital infidelity]]. Later that night, Bill meets Marsha at a campfire in the woods. While having sex in the moonlight, they undergo a frightening transformation into werewolves.\n\nWhile investigating the next morning, Terri is attacked by a werewolf in a cabin, though she escapes after cutting the monster's hand off with an [[ax]]. She runs to Wagner's office and places a phone call to her boyfriend Chris Halloran, who has been alerted about the Colony's true nature. While on the phone with Chris, Terri looks for files on Eddie Quist. When she finally finds the file in the filing cabinet, she is attacked by Eddie in werewolf form, and is killed when she is bitten on the [[jugular vein]]. Chris hears this on the other end and sets off for the Colony armed with [[silver bullet]]s.\n\nKaren is confronted by the [[resurrection|resurrected]] Eddie Quist once again, and Eddie transforms himself into a werewolf in front of her. In response, Karen splashes Eddie in the face with [[Corrosive substance|corrosive acid]] and flees. Later, as Chris arrives at the Colony, he is confronted by the horribly disfigured Eddie, who is fatally shot by Chris with a silver bullet when he attempts to transform. However, it turns out all the people in the Colony are werewolves and can [[shapeshift]] at will, without the need of a [[full moon]] to do so. Karen and Chris survive their attacks and burn the Colony to the ground. As they drive away, however, one werewolf breaks into their car and bites Karen before being shot by Chris, turning back into Bill as he dies.\n\nKaren resolves to warn the entire world about the existence of werewolves and begins a special worldwide [[broadcast]] announcement to the people around the world. Then, to prove her story, she herself transforms into a werewolf. She is shot at by Chris in front of a live viewing audience, although the people watching the transformation from their television sets around the world are amused, believing it to be just a stunt done with [[special effects]]. Marsha, who escaped the Colony herself completely unscathed, sits at a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] with a man who, while watching the special broadcast announcement, orders a [[pepper steak]] for himself and a [[Doneness|rare]] hamburger for Marsha after Karen's display cuts to a commercial break.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dee Wallace]] as Karen White\n* [[Patrick Macnee]] as Dr. George Waggner\n* [[Dennis Dugan]] as Chris Halloran\n* [[Christopher Stone (actor)|Christopher Stone]] as R.

Quist\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThough the film has been noted for its semi-humorous screenplay, it was adapted from a more straightforward novel by [[Gary Brandner]] which was first published in 1977. After drafts by Jack Conrad (the original director who left following difficulties with the studio) and [[Terence H. Winkless]] proved unsatisfactory, director [[Joe Dante]] hired [[John Sayles]] to completely rewrite the script. The two had collaborated before on Dante's 1978 film ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]''. Sayles rewrote the script with the same self-aware, satirical tone that he gave ''Piranha'', and his finished draft bears only a vague resemblance to Brandner's book. However, Winkless still received a co-writer's credit along with Sayles for his work on the screenplay.\n\nThe cast featured a number of recognizable character actors, such as [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], [[John Carradine]], [[Kenneth Tobey]] and [[Slim Pickens]], many of whom appeared in genre films themselves. Additionally, the film was full of [[in-joke]] references (see 'Tributes' below). [[Roger Corman]] makes a cameo appearance as a man standing outside a phone booth, as does John Sayles, appearing as a morgue attendant and James Murtaugh as one of the members of the Colony. [[Forrest J Ackerman]] appears in a brief cameo in an occult bookstore, clutching a copy of an issue of his magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]''.\n\n''The Howling'' was also notable for its special effects, which were state-of-the-art at the time. The transformation scenes were created by [[Rob Bottin]], who had also worked with Dante on ''Piranha''. [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] was the original effects artist for the film, but left the production to work on the [[John Landis]] film ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'', handing over the effects work to Bottin.<ref name=\"combustible\">{{cite web |url=http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/interviews/joedante.shtml |title=Howl Play: Interview with Joe Dante |work=Combustible Celluloid |date=September 30, 2003 |first=Jeffrey M. |last=Anderson |access-date=2016-08-05}}</ref> Bottin's most celebrated effect was the on-screen transformation of Eddie Quist, which involved [[Air bladder effect|air bladder]]s under latex facial applications to give the illusion of transformation. ''Variety'' claimed that ''The Howling''{{'}}s biggest flaw is that the impact of this initial transformation is never topped during the climax of the film.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> ''The Howling'' also features stop-motion animation by [[David W. Allen]], and puppetry intended to give the werewolves an even more non-human look.<ref name=\"combustible\"/> Despite most of the special effects at the time, the silhouette of Bill and Marsha having sex as werewolves is obviously a cartoon animation. Dante attributed this to budgetary reasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nDue to their work in ''The Howling'', Dante and producer [[Michael Finnell]] received the opportunity to make the film ''[[Gremlins]]'' (1984) for [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref name=Gremlins>DVD commentary; Steven Spielberg presents ''Gremlins''. Special Edition. Warner Home Video, 2002.</ref> That film references ''The Howling'' with a [[Smiley|smiley face]] image on a refrigerator door. Eddie Quist leaves yellow smiley face stickers as his calling card in several places throughout ''The Howling''. Also, Jim McKrell's character as news reporter Lew Landers appears in both ''The Howling'' and ''Gremlins''.\n\n===Music===\n[[Pino Donaggio]] composed the score which featured classic orchestral horror melodies with minimal synth sounds. Waxwork Records released the full [[soundtrack]] on a [[double LP]] in 2017. The album art was done by [[Francesco Francavilla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2016/12/09/the-howling-soundtrack-vinyl-waxwork-records/|title=Waxwork announce deluxe vinyl reissue of The Howling OST|location=Fact Magazine|author=Lobenfeld, Claire|date=9 December 2016 |access-date=14 August 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Differences from Brandner's novel===\n<!--Sources are the novel and the film. This does not consist of original research.-->\nThe plot and characters of the film deviate from the original novel in many ways:\n\n* In the novel, Karen White is called Karyn Beatty, her husband is called Roy Beatty (as opposed to Bill Neill in the film), and neither Karyn nor Roy work in television.\n* In the novel, Karyn is raped by a man in her apartment, whereas in the film she is saved by the police before being attacked by a werewolf in an adult bookstore.\n* In the novel, Karyn's psychiatrist is only briefly mentioned, while in the film he is a major character by the name of Dr. Waggner.\n* In the novel, Karyn goes to recuperate at Drago, a mountain village in California; in the film she goes instead to \"the Colony\", a health resort run by her psychiatrist Dr.\u2006\u2060Waggner.\n* Karyn's rapist in the novel is named Max Quist and he is an ex-con who has no involvement with the village of Drago or its inhabitants. In the film, Karen's (attempted) attacker is named Eddie Quist and is already affiliated with the Colony before he meets Karen.\n* Marsha Quist's name in the novel is Marcia Lura, a shopkeeper in Drago, and she is not a relative of Max Quist.\n* In the novel, Karyn and Roy bring their pet dog Lady with them to the village, and she is killed later on; in the film they have no dog, nor any pet.\n* The werewolves in the novel are described as resembling actual [[Wolf|wolves]] (but greater in both size and ferocity). The werewolves of the film are more [[anthropomorphic]], and can walk on their hind legs; standing over seven feet tall.\n* The werewolves in the novel are never seen in the daytime; in fact, they transform every night once the sun has gone down. The werewolves in the film can transform at will at any time of the day or night, and are indeed seen during daylight hours.\n* In the novel, the character Chris Halloran is Roy's best friend. In the film, Chris works with Karen and Bill at the television station. Karen's friend Terri (Chris' girlfriend, who also works at the station) is an original character for the film and is not featured in the novel at all.\n* In the novel, Karyn escapes from Drago physically unharmed (albeit mentally traumatized) and survives after being rescued by Chris Halloran. In the film, she gets bitten by her husband Bill after he transforms into a werewolf, prompting Karyn's later transformation into one herself and Chris' shooting her with a silver bullet, both on live television (leading to the film's ambiguous ending as to whether the shot struck true, as the television news program broadcasting these events to the public is cut at the critical moment).\n\n===Tributes===\nNotable for its semi-humorous screenplay, director Joe Dante put many [[in-joke]] references in the film, including numerous references to wolves: [[The Big Bad Wolf]] from [[Ub Iwerks]]' ''Little Boy Blue'' (1936) is seen on TV; Sheriff Newfield is seen eating [[Wolf Brand Chili]] and a similar can is seen on the counter in Eddie's cabin; a copy of the [[Allen Ginsberg]] book ''[[Howl (poem)|Howl]]'' appears; a mention of disc jockey [[Wolfman Jack]]; a bottle of Wolfen-brand medicine on the counter from which Karen picks up the acid; and in Karen and Bill's cabin there is a picture of a wolf who killed a sheep from within the flock.\n\nMany characters in the film are named after horror film directors who directed other films that featured werewolves, including [[George Waggner]], who directed ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941). Others include [[R. William Neill]] (''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', 1943), [[Terence Fisher]] (''[[The Curse of the Werewolf]]'', 1961), [[Freddie Francis]] (''[[Legend of the Werewolf]]'', 1975), [[Erle Kenton]] (''[[House of Dracula]]'', 1945, which co-stars [[John Carradine]], who plays Kenton in ''The Howling''), [[Sam Newfield]] (''[[The Mad Monster]]'', 1942), [[Charles Barton (director)|Charles Barton]] (''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'', 1948), [[Jacinto Molina]] (''[[The Mark of the Wolfman|La Marca del Hombre Lobo]]'', 1968) and [[Lew Landers]] (''[[The Return of the Vampire]]'', 1943).\n\nDick Miller's bookstore owner Walter Paisley gets his name from Miller's starring role in the low-budget horror film ''[[A Bucket of Blood]]'' (1959). Also present in the bookstore is the mummified grandmother in an armchair from the attic of the house in the original version of the film ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.\n\nThe film's screenwriter and future director John Sayles, Dante's former producer Roger Corman (who directed ''A Bucket of Blood''), and science fiction and horror film personality [[Forrest J Ackerman]] all have cameos.<ref name=vanHeerden>{{cite book |title=Film and Television In-Jokes |first=Bill |last=van Heerden |year=1998 |publisher=McFarland & Co. |isbn=978-0-7864-3894-5}}</ref>\n\n===Finance===\nIFI agreed to provide 50% of the finance.
