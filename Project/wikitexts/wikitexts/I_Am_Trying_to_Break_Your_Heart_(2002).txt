The film, distributed to theaters in the United States through [[Noah Cowan|Cowboy Pictures]], was released on July 26, 2002, three months after the album's retail release.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=I Am Trying to Break Your Heart|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_am_trying_to_break_your_heart|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=May 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nWith Wilco nearing completion of their album ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'', conflict arose between the band and its record label [[Reprise Records|Reprise]], a division of the [[Warner Music Group]]. Wilco's prior albums had not performed to Reprise's sales expectations and Reprise were concerned with how to market the new album. They consequently rejected the work and dropped Wilco from the label.\n\nWith a completed album and no contractual obligations to Reprise, Wilco made the album available to download on their website. Awareness of the new album became apparent and Wilco's profile was rising. In response, another record label, [[Nonesuch Records]], offered Wilco a new record contract. Nonesuch Records, like Reprise, is a division of Warner Music Group, so Wilco were essentially paid twice for the album by the same record company.\n\nOther scenes depicted the breakdown of the relationship between members [[Jeff Tweedy]] and [[Jay Bennett]], and Tweedy's debilitating [[migraine]]s.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Tweedy]]\n* [[John Stirratt]]\n* [[Leroy Bach]]\n* [[Glenn Kotche]]\n* [[Jay Bennett]]\n* [[Tony Margherita]]\n\n== Release ==\nIn addition to regular theatrical releases throughout the United States, the film was an official selection of the [[LA Film Festival|Los Angeles Film Festival]], where the film had its world premiere in June 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wilco Film Debuts This Month|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/wilco-film-debuts-this-month-246845/|last=Dansby|first=Andrew|date=June 4, 2002|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=May 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 60 reviews, and an average rating of 6.92/10.
