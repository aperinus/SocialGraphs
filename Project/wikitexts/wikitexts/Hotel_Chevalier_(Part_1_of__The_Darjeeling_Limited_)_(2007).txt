Starring [[Jason Schwartzman]] and [[Natalie Portman]] as former lovers who reunite in a [[Paris]] hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a [[prologue]] to Anderson's 2007 feature ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]''. It was shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew and self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone work. Its first showing was at the [[Venice Film Festival]] premi\u00e8re of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and it made its own debut later that month at [[Apple Store]]s in four U.S. cities.\n\nThe day after the film's premi\u00e8re, it was made freely available from the [[iTunes Store]] for one month, during which time it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. The film garnered acclaim from reviewers, who compared it favorably to ''The Darjeeling Limited'' and praised its richness, poignancy, and careful construction.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Prelude -->\nIn a hotel lobby, the [[concierge]] answers a phone call from a guest's room. Jack ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film ''[[Stalag 17]]'' and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from the concierge in broken [[French language|French]], he receives a call from Rhett, his ex-girlfriend. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, Jack consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room&nbsp;\u2013 pausing to play the opening bars of the song \"[[Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?]]\" by [[Peter Sarstedt]] on his stereo system&nbsp;\u2013 and runs a bath.\n\n<!-- Arrival -->\nJack is again lying on the bed, now in a gray suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before opening the door to Rhett ([[Natalie Portman]]). After staring at him for several seconds, Rhett breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and presents Jack with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it \"wasn't actually that hard\". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.\n\n<!-- Conflict -->\nStepping back into the bedroom, Rhett turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly \"what the fuck is going on?\" Jack motions for her to join him on the bed and at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing conversation that he has been living in the hotel room for \"more than a month\", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and Jack begins to undress Rhett. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when Jack notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, Rhett chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells Jack that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he \"will never be [her] friend\", but holds her when she embraces him. \"Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?\" starts again and Jack offers to show Rhett his view of Paris.\n\n<!-- D\u00e9nouement -->\nRhett is perched against an [[armoire]], Jack approaches and covers her naked body with the yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, Jack draws a toothpick from his pocket and hands it to Rhett with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Jack Whitman\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as Rhett\n\n==Background and production==\n[[File:H\u00f4tel Rapha\u00ebl, Paris 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A six-storey building at the corner of a terrace lined in front by bare trees |The H\u00f4tel Rapha\u00ebl in Paris, which was used as the Hotel Chevalier of the film's title and where all of the scenes were shot]]\n[[Wes Anderson]] first approached Schwartzman and Portman about ''Hotel Chevalier'' in 2005.<ref name=wsj/> Schwartzman and Anderson had previously worked on ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' (1998), Anderson's cult second feature, and had been living together in Schwartzman's Paris apartment in the months leading up to the shoot.<ref name=newyorker/> Portman was approached after the director obtained her email address from [[Scott Rudin]], executive producer of 2004's ''[[Closer (2004 film)|Closer]]'' in which she starred.<ref name=latimes/> The actors appeared for free,<ref name=variety/> and Anderson financed the remainder of the production himself.<ref name=hindu/>\n\nIt was filmed at the [[H\u00f4tel Raphael]] in Paris, on [[Avenue Kl\u00e9ber]], two blocks south-southwest of the [[Arc de Triomphe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leshotelsbaverez.com/en/home/raphael/location/ |title=H\u00f4tel Rapha\u00ebl: Location |publisher=Les Hotels Baverez |access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref> The H\u00f4tel Raphael had previously been used as a setting for the films ''[[Love in Paris]]'' (1996) and ''[[Place Vend\u00f4me (film)|Place Vend\u00f4me]]'' (1998).<ref name=raphael/> It was shot by a crew of 15 in Panavision and used props from Anderson's apartment.<ref name=latimes/><ref name=hindu/> Filming took two and a half days, and editing (done on Anderson's computer) another week.<ref name=wsj/> Despite his use of a wardrobe from prestigious fashion designer [[Marc Jacobs]] and a handmade suitcase from [[Louis Vuitton]], the director described the production as \"like making a student film\".<ref name=latimes/>\n\nAnderson initially intended it to be a stand-alone short film,<ref name=ifc/> but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Jack (Schwartzman) bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time.<ref name=wsj/><ref name=ifc/> That film would begin production a year later as ''The Darjeeling Limited''.<ref name=wsj/> ''Chevalier'' takes place two weeks before Jack joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in ''Darjeeling''.<ref name=latimes/> The dialogue between the characters at the end of ''Chevalier'' is recounted by Jack to his brothers at the close of the feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed.<ref name=corliss/> Rhett (Portman) has a brief cameo in the feature.<ref name=wsj/> [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the studio that backed ''Darjeeling'', was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no financial interest in it.<ref name=wsj/>\n\n==Release==\n{{quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=When it was all done, I didn't want to incorporate the short into the movie.

Gary Susman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described it as \"an exquisite short story where we learn not much but exactly enough about these two characters\", adding that \"''Chevalier'' sees Anderson working in his customary jewel-box/dollhouse mode, but the form and length really suit each other here.\"<ref name=\"susman\" /> [[Armond White]] of ''[[New York Press]]'' judged the short \"moving and genuinely contemporary\", citing its \"lost-girl poignancy\".<ref name=\"nyp\" /> The film drew some attention for Portman's brief, partial nude scene, and for her bruised body.<ref name=\"wsj\" /><ref name=\"breznican\" /><ref name=\"sequels\" /> Portman expressed disappointment at this undue focus, saying \"[i]t really depressed me that half of every review ... was about the nudity\". The episode made the actress reconsider the wisdom of this aspect of her performance,<ref name=\"cbsnews\" /> and she subsequently swore off nude appearances in film.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" />\n\nWhile ''The Darjeeling Limited'' did receive generally positive reviews\u2014having attained a 68% approval rating on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\u2014many of the champions of ''Hotel Chevalier'' tended to combine praise of ''Chevalier'' with subtle shots at ''Darjeeling''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/darjeeling_limited/ |title=The Darjeeling Limited - Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2014-04-08|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref>  Portman's performance as Rhett was praised by ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' reviewer [[Richard Corliss]], who declared her to be \"a comic actress in fresh bloom\" in the \"beguiling vignette\", and expressed his wish that her role in ''Darjeeling'' had been greater.<ref name=\"corliss\" /> The feature, he felt, lacked \"the feeling and wit of the short film\".<ref name=\"corliss\" /> [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' concurred, stating that \"the untold story of ''Hotel Chevalier'' is 10 times more interesting, and infinitely richer, than the one told outright in {{Italics correction|''The Darjeeling Limited''}}\", and calling the short \"very close to perfect\".<ref name=\"salon\" /> ''The Guardian'' columnist Danny Leigh contrasted the lukewarm reception of the feature among bloggers and critics with the \"genuine ardour\" that greeted the \"perfectly measured narrative\" of ''Chevalier''. He proposed that the constraints of the short-film format suited Anderson, whose trademark deadpan humor, idiosyncratic set designs and choice of soundtrack inclined to exhaust the viewers' patience in a feature-length work.<ref name=\"grauniad\" /> [[A. O. Scott]] of ''The New York Times'' hailed ''Chevalier'' as \"a small gem\" in comparison to the \"overstuffed suitcase\" of the feature, and wrote that \"It is worth seeking out, not only because it fleshes out part of the story of the Whitman brothers but also because, on its own, it is an almost perfect distillation of Mr. Anderson's vexing and intriguing talents, enigmatic, affecting and wry.\"<ref name=\"nyff\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"susman\">{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2007/10/02/hotel-chevalier/ |work=Popwatch |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |first=Gary |last=Susman |date=October 2, 2007 |title=Snap judgment: Wes Anderson's ''Hotel Chevalier'' |access-date=December 4, 2009}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/business/media/22darjeeling.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 22, 2007 |title='Darjeeling' to be paired with a short |first=Lia |last=Miller |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219190518/https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/business/media/22darjeeling.html | archive-date=2013-12-19 |url-status=live |access-date=March 8, 2022 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"salon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2007/09/28/darjeeling/ |work=[[Salon.com]] |title=The Darjeeling Limited |first=Stephanie |last=Zacharek |author-link=Stephanie Zacharek |date=September 28, 2007 |publisher=Salon Media Group |access-date=November 28, 2009}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119059131017936814 |title=Coming soon: a new take on the old double bill |first=Peter |last=Sanders |date=September 24, 2007 |access-date=July 30, 2010 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=Dow Jones & Company}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hindu\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200710261252.htm |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Despite notable year, mainstream success eludes short films |date=October 26, 2007 |access-date=November 28, 2009 |work=[[The Hindu]] |publisher=The Hindu Group |location=Chennai, India |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105142847/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/009200710261252.htm |archive-date=November 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972784 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=Reed Business Information |title='Hotel Chevalier' checks into iTunes |first=Sam |last=Thielman |date= September 26, 2007 |access-date=March 2, 2022 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"breznican\">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-10-22-darjeeling-mystery_N.htm |title='Darjeeling Limited' leaves mysteries in its path |first=Anthony |last=Breznican |work=USA Today |date=October 22, 2007 |access-date=November 28, 2009 |publisher=Gannett Company}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nyp\">{{cite web|date=March 26, 2008 |title=Asia Minor |url=http://nypress.com/asia-minor/ |first=Armond |last=White |author-link=Armond White|work=[[New York Press]] |access-date=November 28, 2009 |publisher=Manhattan Media}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"zoetrope\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.all-story.com/issues.cgi?action=show_story&story_id=364 |journal=Zoetrope: All-Story |publisher=American Zoetrope |title=Hotel Chevalier |first=Wes |last=Anderson |volume=11 |issue=4 |date=Winter 2007 |access-date=July 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519145835/http://www.all-story.com/issues.cgi?action=show_story&story_id=364 |archive-date=May 19, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nyff\">{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/09/28/movies/28darj.html |title=Brothers, and their baggage, in India |date=September 28, 2007 |first=A.
