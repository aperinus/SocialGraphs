However, elements within each country's military are vehemently opposed to such a plan, and determined to stop it at all costs.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] [[Master Sergeant#United States|Master Sergeant]] Johnny Gallagher is part of a U.S. Army unit patrolling outside a chalet in West Berlin, where the American President and the Soviet General Secretary are beginning talks for mutual [[nuclear disarmament]]. In another part of the chalet, high-ranking generals from the U.S. and Soviet militaries secretly agree to form a conspiracy to sabotage the talks. When U.S. General Carlson refuses to go along with the plot, he is assassinated outside the chalet by a pair of German hikers who slipped through the chalet's perimeter.\n\nGallagher is blamed for the disaster, and assigned as punishment to escort an Army sergeant named Walter Henke from West Berlin back to the United States for court martial. After landing at [[Dulles International Airport]], Gallagher is ambushed by an undercover team, who spirit Henke away. Gallagher tracks down Henke's wife and is surprised when she identifies a photo of a different man as her husband. After he leaves, the same undercover team kills Mrs. Henke and phones in an anonymous tip, identifying Gallagher as the killer, who is then is detained on suspicion of murder. Meanwhile, the real Walter Henke is approached in Germany by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Glen Whitacre, who tasks him with a top secret assignment to infiltrate a [[Neo-Nazi]] gang in his hometown of Chicago, who they believe are plotting to assassinate the President.\n\nWith the help of his ex-wife, Lt. Colonel Eileen Gallagher, and her assistant, Lt. Ruth Butler, Gallagher identifies the man he brought back from Germany as Thomas Boyette, a long-service Army veteran with a history of covert operations. Johnny asks why anyone would impersonate a soldier about to be court-martialed, and the explanation given is that Boyette was able to enter the country without a passport, meaning there is no record of his entry and no way to track his movements.\n\nWhen the same undercover team kills Butler and attacks Eileen, Johnny rescues her and escapes the base with the help of a friend. The two investigate the conspiracy on their own, starting with trying to find the real Walter Henke in Chicago, where the next phase of the planned peace talks will take place. Johnny approaches his military friend, Milan Delich, who allows the Gallaghers to hide at his house. At a diner, the same undercover team attempts to kill Delich, leaving him wounded. As Delich is taken away by ambulance, conspirators dressed as cops capture Johnny, who is then held in the basement of the safe house where Boyette is staying.\n\nAfter Boyette leaves for his assignment, Gallagher escapes and speeds toward downtown Chicago, using Boyette's surveillance photos from the basement as a guide to the planned assassination site. Meanwhile, the real Walter Henke is lured into an office building overlooking the site and killed by Boyette, the intention being to frame Henke for the assassination and make it look like he was killed later.\n\nFollowing a hotel luncheon, the Soviet Press Secretary, one of the conspirators, convinces the General Secretary to make an unplanned stop just outside the hotel's garage for a photo op with \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian families. Before the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] can reach the site, Boyette takes aim at the General Secretary with a sniper rifle, but Gallagher bursts into the room in the nick of time and shoots Boyette dead.\n\nOutside the room where he found Boyette, Gallagher confronts Whitacre and accuses him of trying to start a war for no reason. Angrily, Whitacre says that nuclear weapons [[Deterrence theory|are the only thing preventing war]], and he and his Soviet counterparts are just smart enough to realize that mutual disarmament would be disastrous for both countries. Gallagher promises to expose the conspiracy and storms away, ignoring Whitacre's threats. On the street, Gallagher reunites with Eileen and hugs her gratefully.\n\nAfter his confrontation with Gallagher, Whitacre enters a limousine with his Soviet counterpart, who asks him what their next step is. Before he can answer, their driver pulls over the car and shoots both colonels dead, thus ensuring that any blame will fall on them and the remaining conspirators will not be exposed.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--cast and order per opening  stand-alone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Johnny Gallagher\n* [[Joanna Cassidy]] as Eileen Gallagher\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Thomas Boyette\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Milan Delich\n* [[Reni Santoni]] as a [[Chicago Police]] Lieutenant\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Ruth Butler\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as General Hopkins\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Colonel Glen Whitacre\n* [[Ron Dean]] as Karl Richards\n* Kevin Crowley as Walter Henke\n* [[Thalmus Rasulala]]  as [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Commander\n* [[Marco St. John]] as Marth\n\n==Production notes==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\nAlthough the story takes place in [[Germany]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], and [[Chicago]], the film was shot entirely in Chicago and at the [[Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten)|Soviet War Memorial]] in Tiergarten, Berlin.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Package'' holds a 65% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 17 reviews.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/package/ ''The Package'' (1989)], Rotten Tomatoes</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three stars out of four, calling it \"smarter than most thrillers\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-package-1989| author=Roger Ebert| title=The Package| publisher=rogerebert.com| date=August 25, 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Home video==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\nThe film was first released on VHS by Orion Home Video in 1989.
