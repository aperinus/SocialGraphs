It stars [[Matt Lanter]], [[Vanessa Minnillo]], Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson, [[Crista Flanagan]], [[Nicole Parker]], [[Ike Barinholtz]], [[Carmen Electra]], [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]], and [[Kim Kardashian]] in her feature film debut. It was released on August 29, 2008 by [[Lionsgate]]. The film is a parody of the [[disaster film]] genre and [[pop culture]].\n\nThe film was panned by critics and audiences for its forced adult humor, excessive pop culture references, and poor directing, with many considering it to be even worse than the previous movies created by Seltzer and Friedberg,<ref name=\"CinemaScore\" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/25/decades.worst.movies.tomatoes/ | title=Site picks worst movies of the decade | work=CNN | date=September 25, 2009 | access-date=September 25, 2016}}</ref> as well as [[List of films considered the worst#Disaster Movie (2008)|one of the worst films of all time]].

It grossed nearly $35 million against a budget of $20 million.<ref name=\"bom\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year [[10,000 BC (film)|10,001 B.C.]], a [[caveman]] runs away from a predator through a plain and immediately gets into a fight with [[Michael Van Wijk|Wolf]]. After defeating him, the caveman then encounters the predator, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed]], [[gasoline]]-drinking [[Amy Winehouse]], who informs him that the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|world will end]] on August 29, 2008, and that their fate lies in a [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|Crystal Skull]].\n\nThe sequence is then revealed to be a dream of [[everyman]] Will in the present day. He then finds out that his girlfriend Amy is having an affair with [[Flavor Flav]], and she breaks up with Will because he is not admitting his true feelings for her.\n\nLater that day, Will has a \"[[My Super Sweet 16|Super Duper Sweet Sixteen]]\" party at his house, despite being 25. The guests include [[Juno (film)|Juney]], [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]], Will's best friend Calvin, and [[Anton Chigurh]], among others. During the party, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, a [[Calvin Klein]] underwear model. The party then comes to a halt when the room shakes and the lights go out. A bulletin on the radio claims there is a [[meteor shower]] and it is the end of the world. Soon after, the city starts to [[The Day After Tomorrow|freeze over]], and Will, Juney, Calvin, and Calvin's girlfriend Lisa retreat to a garage for shelter. When Juney mentions that the calamities are caused by [[global warming]], Will realizes his dream as a caveman could be related. Later, Will is chided by the others for not committing himself to his relationship with Amy.\n\nThe gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, where he admits his feelings for her before the call is dropped. He decides to go to rescue Amy. Lisa is later killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]], a prostitute, climbs out of a [[manhole]] and gets hit by a [[Taxicab|taxi]]. Calvin catches her, and they [[Love at first sight|immediately fall in love with each other]]. Giselle's [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Prince Edwin]], challenges Calvin to [[Step Up 2: The Streets|a dance fight]] for her love, but [[Twister (1996 film)|a tornado]] appears and Prince Edwin flees. [[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]], [[Hellboy II|Hellboy]], and [[The Incredible Hulk (film)|the Hulk]] attempt to fight it, but all are defeated by [[Cattle|cows]] thrown by the tornado. After taking shelter, Will, Juney, Calvin, and Giselle encounter [[Rabies|rabid]] knockoffs of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], who attack the gang and kill Juney. The \"Chipmunks\" then go after Will and Calvin, but they trap them in a trash can, fatally suffocating them as they attempt to escape.\n\nOn their way to the museum where Amy is trapped, the group runs into [[Batman]], who informs them that they must go to evacuation buses and that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. With time against them, Princess Giselle kills [[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]], and the group hijacks his [[Mach Five]] to drive to the museum. At the museum, they save Amy, who reveals that the Crystal Skull is the only thing that can stop the end of the world. Calvin and the Princess then find that the museum doors are closed and all of the artifacts have [[Night at the Museum|come alive]], including [[Po (Kung Fu Panda)|Po from Kung Fu Panda]], who fights Calvin but is defeated. When Calvin makes out with the Princess, Calvin accidentally pulls her [[wig]] and discovers that she is actually a [[Transvestism|transvestite]]. While this happens, \"Po\" takes out a [[katana]] and simultaneously kills Calvin and the Princess.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Amy run into a nude [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], who fights with Will. After Amy stabs \"Beowulf\" in the back, Will and Amy encounter [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]], who is revealed to be Will's father. \"Indy\" tries to put the Crystal Skull on the altar, but he flies through a stained glass window in the room. Will does it instead, and he averts further destruction. Will and Amy have a [[wedding]] ceremony performed by [[The Love Guru|\"The Guru Shitka\"]], which ends with a musical number about all of the characters in the film dating each other (having sex in the unrated version) parodying \"I'm Fucking Matt Damon\" by Sarah Silverman and the film closes with the \"Chipmunks\" getting crushed to death by a falling cow before the credits start to roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Lanter]] as Will\n* [[Vanessa Lachey|Vanessa Minnillo]] as Amy\n* Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson as Calvin\n* [[Crista Flanagan]] as [[Juno (film)|Juney]] / [[Miley Stewart|Hannah Montana]]\n* [[Nicole Parker]] as [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]] / [[Amy Winehouse]] / [[Jessica Simpson]]\n* [[Kim Kardashian]] as Lisa Taylor\n* [[Ike Barinholtz]] as [[Michael Van Wijk|Wolf]] / [[Anton Chigurh]] / [[Prince Caspian (character)|Prince Caspian]] / [[World Trade Center (film)|The Policeman]] / [[Hellboy]] / [[Batman]] / [[Beowulf (hero)|\"Beowulf\"]]\n* [[Carmen Electra]] as [[Wanted (2008 film)|The Beautiful Assassin]]\n* [[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]] as [[Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones]]\n* [[Tad Hilgenbrink]] as [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Prince Edwin]]\n* [[Nick Steele (actor)|Nick Steele]] as [[Calvin Klein|Underwear Model]]\n* Jason Boegh as [[Carrie Bradshaw]]\n* [[Valerie Wildman]] as [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]\n* [[John Di Domenico]] as [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] / [[The Love Guru|The Guru Shitka]]\n* Abe Spigner as [[Flavor Flav]]\n* Christopher Johnson as [[Michael Jackson]]\n* Jared S.
