The film stars [[Essie Davis]], Noah Wiseman, [[Daniel Henshall]], [[Hayley McElhinney]], Barbara West, and Ben Winspear. It is based on Kent's 2005 short film ''Monster'', which follows a [[Single parent|single mother]] who must confront her son's fear of a [[monster]] in their home.\n\nKent began developing the screenplay in 2009, intending to explore [[parenting]] and fear of madness in the film's story. Financing was secured through [[Film and television financing in Australia|Australian government grants]] and partly through [[crowdfunding]]. Filming took place in [[Adelaide]], where Kent drew from experiences as a production assistant on [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[Dogville]]''. During filming, the crew worked to ensure six-year old Wiseman was [[Child protection|protected]] from the challenging subject matter of the film. The titular monster and special effects were created with [[stop motion]] and handmade practical effects, and the score was composed by [[Jed Kurzel]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]] on 17 January,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.filmink.com.au/news/two-aussie-features-selected-for-sundance/ | work=[[Filmink]] | first=Eden | last=Caceda | title=Two Aussie Features Selected For Sundance | date=9 December 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627074856/http://www.filmink.com.au/news/two-aussie-features-selected-for-sundance/ | archive-date=27 June 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and was given a limited release in Australian [[Art film|art house]] cinemas beginning on 22 May 2014, initially failing to become a commercial success in its native country.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/oct/29/the-babadooks-monster-uk-box-office-success-highlights-problems-at-home|title=The Babadook's monster UK box office success highlights problems at home|work=The Guardian Australia|date=29 October 2014|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref> However, ''The Babadook'' generated wider attention internationally, grossing $10 million worldwide against a $2 million budget. The film received critical acclaim and was the best-reviewed horror film of [[2014 in film|2014]], with critics commending its scares, creature design, story and exploration of [[grief]]. It won three of its six nominations at the [[AACTA Awards]], including [[AACTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. It maintained a following in subsequent years, partly due to becoming an [[internet meme]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--  As of August 2016, this summary has over 708 words, is generic and DOES NOT EXCEED 400-700 WORDS per WP:FILMPLOT!! -->\nAmelia Vanek is a troubled and exhausted widow living in [[Adelaide]], who has brought up her six-year-old son Samuel alone. Her late husband, Oskar, was killed in a car accident that occurred as he drove Amelia to the hospital during labour. Sam begins displaying erratic behaviour: he becomes an insomniac and is preoccupied with an imaginary monster, which he has built weapons to fight. Amelia is forced to pick up her son from school after Sam brings one of the weapons there. One night, Sam asks his mother to read a [[Pop-up book|pop-up storybook]] called ''Mister Babadook''. It describes the titular monster, the Babadook, a tall pale-faced humanoid in a [[top hat]] with [[Claw|taloned]] fingers which torments its victims after they become aware of its existence. Amelia is disturbed by the book and its mysterious appearance, while Sam becomes convinced that the Babadook is real. Sam's persistence about the Babadook leads Amelia to often have sleepless nights as she tries to comfort him.\n\nSoon after, strange events occur: doors open and close mysteriously by themselves, strange sounds are heard and Amelia finds glass shards in her food. She attributes the events to Sam's behaviour, but he blames the Babadook. Amelia rips up the book and disposes of it. At her birthday party, Sam's cousin Ruby bullies Sam for not having a father, in response to which he pushes her out of her tree house; as a result she breaks her nose. Amelia's sister Claire admits she cannot bear Sam, to which Amelia takes great offence. On the drive home, Sam has another vision of the Babadook and suffers a seizure, so Amelia gets some sedatives from a paediatrician.\n\nThe following morning, Amelia finds the ''Mister Babadook'' book reassembled on the front door step. New words taunt her by saying that the Babadook will become stronger if she continues to deny its existence, containing pop-ups of her killing their dog Bugsy, Sam, and then herself. Terrified, Amelia burns the book and runs to the police station after a disturbing phone call. However, Amelia has no proof of the stalking, and when she then sees the Babadook's suit hung up behind the front desk, she leaves. That night, Amelia tries to fall asleep and watches the Babadook open her bedroom door, crawl up the ceiling and attack her. She then turns on all the lights in the house and falls asleep with Sam downstairs. After the attack, Amelia starts to become more isolated and shut-in, becoming impatient, shouting at Samuel for 'disobeying' her constantly, and having frequent visions of the Babadook once again. Her mental state slowly decays and she exhibits erratic and violent behaviour, including cutting the phone line with a knife and then waving the same knife aggressively at Sam without realizing it. This devolves into disturbing hallucinations, in which Amelia violently murders Sam.\n\nShortly after these visions, Amelia sees an apparition of Oskar, who offers to return to her if she \"brings the boy\" to him. Realizing that he is a creation of the Babadook, Amelia flees and is stalked through the house by the Babadook until it finally possesses her. Under its influence she breaks Bugsy's neck and attempts to kill Sam. Eventually luring her into the basement, Sam knocks her out. Tied up, Amelia awakens with Sam, terrified, nearby. When she tries to strangle him, he lovingly caresses her face, causing her to regurgitate an inky black substance, which seemingly expels the Babadook. When Sam reminds Amelia that \"you can't get rid of the Babadook,\" an unseen force drags him into Amelia's bedroom. After saving Sam, Amelia is forced by the Babadook to re-watch a vision of her husband's death. Furious, she confronts the Babadook, making the beast retreat into the basement, and she locks the door behind it.\n\nAfter this ordeal, Amelia and Sam manage to recover. Amelia is attentive and caring toward him, encouraging him with building his weapons and being impressed at Sam's magic tricks. They gather earthworms in a bowl, and Amelia takes them to the basement, where the Babadook resides. She places the bowl on the floor for the Babadook to eat. However, as the beast tries to attack her, Amelia calms it down, and it retreats to the corner, taking the earthworms with it. Amelia returns to the yard to celebrate Sam's birthday.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Essie Davis]] as Amelia Vanek\n*Noah Wiseman as Samuel Vanek\n*[[Hayley McElhinney]] as Claire\n*[[Daniel Henshall]] as Robbie\n*Barbara West as Gracie Roach\n*Ben Winspear as Oskar Vanek\n*Cathy Adamek as Prue Flannery\n*Craig Behenna as Warren Newton\n*Chloe Hurn as Ruby\n*Jacquy Phillips as Beverly\n*Bridget Walters as Norma\n*Adam Morgan as Sergeant\n*Charlie Holtz as Kid No. 2\n*Tim Purcell as the Babadook\n*Hachi as Bugsy\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Jennifer Kent, Paris Cin\u00e9ma 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Writer and director [[Jennifer Kent]]]]\nKent studied at the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA), where she learned acting alongside Davis, and graduated in 1991.<ref name=\"Lui\" /> She then worked primarily as an actor in the film industry for over two decades. Kent eventually lost her passion for acting by the end of the 1990s and sent a written proposal to Danish filmmaker [[Lars von Trier]], asking if she could assist on the film set of von Trier's 2003 drama film, ''[[Dogville]]'', to learn from the director.

In regard to parenting, Kent further explained in October 2014: \"Now, I'm not saying we all want to go and kill our kids, but a lot of women struggle.

Therefore, Kent sought her own \"family of collaborators to work with for the long term.\" Unable to find all of the suitable people within the Australian film industry, Kent hired Polish director of photography (DOP) Radek Ladczuk, for whom ''Babadook'' was his first-ever English language film, and American illustrator Alexander Juhasz.<ref name=\"San\" /> In terms of film influences, Kent cited 1960s, '70s and '80s horror\u2014including [[The Thing (1982 film)|''The Thing'']] (1982), [[Halloween (1978 film)|''Halloween'']] (1978), [[Eyes Without a Face (film)|''Les Yeux Sans Visage'']] (1960), [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'']] (1974), ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'' (1962) and [[The Shining (film)|''The Shining'']] (1980)\u2014as well as ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932), ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) and [[Let the Right One In (film)|''Let The Right One In'']] (2008).<ref name=\"Emp\" />\n\nAlthough the process was challenging and she was forced to reduce their total budget, producer Kristina Ceyton managed to secure funding of around A$2.5 million from government bodies [[Screen Australia]] and the [[South Australian Film Corporation|SAFC]]; however, they still required an additional budget for the construction of the film sets. To attain the funds for the sets, Kent and Causeway Films producer Kristina Ceyton launched a [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding campaign in June 2012, with a target of US$30,000.
