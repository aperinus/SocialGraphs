It tells the story of Elliott, a boy who befriends an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], dubbed E.T., who is left behind on [[Earth]]. Along with his friends and family, Elliott must find a way to help E.T. find his way home. The film stars [[Dee Wallace]], [[Henry Thomas]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Robert MacNaughton]] and [[Drew Barrymore]].\n\nThe film's concept was based on an imaginary friend that Spielberg created after his parents' divorce. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison and developed a new story from the unrealized project ''[[Night Skies]]''. In less than two months, Mathison wrote the first draft of the script, titled ''E.T. and Me'', which went through two rewrites. The project was rejected by [[Columbia Pictures]], who doubted its commercial potential. [[Universal Pictures]] eventually purchased the script for $1 million. Filming took place from September to December 1981 on a budget of $10.5 million. Unlike most films, ''E.T.'' was shot in rough chronological order to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast. The animatronics for the film were designed by [[Carlo Rambaldi]].\n\n''E.T.'' premiered as the closing film of the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] on May 26, 1982, and was released in the United States on June 11, 1982. The film was an immediate [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], surpassing ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' to become the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], a record it held for eleven years until Spielberg's own ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' surpassed it in 1993. ''E.T.'' was widely acclaimed by critics, and is regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]]. It received nine nominations at the [[55th Academy Awards]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]], and also won five [[Saturn Awards]] and two [[Golden Globe Awards]]. The film was re-released in 1985 and again in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, with altered shots, visual effects and additional scenes. It was also re-released in [[IMAX]] on August 12, 2022, to celebrate its 40th anniversary. In 1994, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]], who deemed it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n== Plot ==\nAlien botanists secretly visit Earth at night to gather specimens in a California forest. One of them separates from the group, fascinated by the distant city lights, but U.S. government vehicles arrive and chase the startled creature. The other aliens depart, abandoning him on Earth. In a nearby neighborhood in the [[San Fernando Valley]], ten-year-old Elliott Taylor's suspicions are roused when he pitches a baseball into a tool shed, and the ball is thrown back. Later that night, Elliott returns with a flashlight, discovering the creature among the cornstalks. He shrieks and flees the scene.\n\nDespite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves a trail of candy to lure the alien into his house. Before bed, he realizes the alien is imitating his movements. The next morning, Elliott feigns sickness to stay home from school and play with him. He can \"feel\" the alien's thoughts and emotions, shown when the alien accidentally opens an umbrella, startling him and simultaneously Elliott several rooms away.\n\nLater that day, Elliott introduces his older brother Michael and seven-year-old sister Gertie to the alien, deciding to keep him hidden from their mother, Mary. When the children ask the alien about his origins, he shows them by levitating several balls, representing his [[planetary system]] and demonstrates his powers by reviving dead [[chrysanthemum]]s. He demonstrates his healing power, through his glowing fingertip, on a minor cut on Elliott's finger.\n\n[[File:ET Communicator Cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Makeshift communicator used by E.T. to phone home. Among its parts is a [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]], an umbrella lined with aluminum foil, and a coffee can filled with other electronics.]]\n\nAt school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a much stronger empathic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because the alien is at Elliott's home, drinking beer and watching television) and freeing the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches [[John Wayne]] kiss [[Maureen O'Hara]] in ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' on television, Elliott kisses a girl he likes similarly and is sent to the principal's office.\n\nThe alien dubs himself \"E.T.\", reading a comic strip where [[Buck Rogers]], stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device, and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. gets Elliott's help to build a device to \"phone home\" by using a [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]]. Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as \"we\". Throughout this, the boys are unaware that E.T. is being tracked by government agents and all three of them are being spied on.\n\nOn [[Halloween]] night, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost to sneak him out. Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they successfully call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, finding E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his worried family. Michael discovers E.T. dying next to a [[culvert]] and takes him home to an also-dying Elliott. Mary becomes horrified upon discovering her son's illness and the dying alien, just as a group of government agents dressed in biohazard suits led by \"Keys\" invades the house.\n\nScientists set up a lab at the house, asking Michael, Mary and Gertie what they know about E.T. While the scientists are treating Elliott and E.T., the mental connection between Elliott and E.T. disappears. E.T. appears to die while Elliott recovers. Elliott is carried away, screaming that the doctors are killing E.T. as they try to revive him. When the doctors pronounce E.T. dead, Michael discovers that the chrysanthemums that E.T. previously revived are dying again. As Elliott recovers, the scientists first return him to his family, but then Keys leaves him alone with E.T. Elliott says a tearful goodbye, telling E.T. that he loves him before closing the case. E.T.'s heartlight begins to glow, and Elliott notices that the chrysanthemum is once again coming back to life and opens the case. E.T. reanimates and tells Elliott that his people are returning.\n\nElliott and Michael steal the van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them on bicycles, evading the authorities. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, E.T. helps them escape by using his [[telekinesis]] to lift them into the air and towards the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.\n\nStanding near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home, while Mary, Gertie, and Keys show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the flower he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him \"I'll be right here\", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He picks up the chrysanthemum and boards the spaceship. As the others watch it take off, the spaceship leaves a rainbow in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image|perrow=5|total_width=500\n| image1 = HenryThomas2019.png\n| image2 = Dee Wallace cropped.jpg\n| image3 = Peter Coyote at Durell Vineyard, Sonoma, April 2019.jpg\n| image4 = Robert Macnaughton London Zoo, Dec 1982.jpg\n| image5 = Drew Barrymore Berlin 2014.jpg\n| footer = [[Henry Thomas]] (left), [[Dee Wallace]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Robert MacNaughton]] and [[Drew Barrymore]] respectively play the roles of Elliott, Mary, Keys, Michael and Gertie.\n}}\n* [[Pat Welsh (actress)|Pat Welsh]], [[Steven Spielberg]], and Kayden Green as E.T.

On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia CEO [[Frank Price]] passed on the project, thus putting it in a [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], and Spielberg approached the more receptive [[Sid Sheinberg]], president of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], then the parent of [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]].<ref>{{Cite news| first = Deborah | last = Caulfield | title = E.T.

Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as he did not have enough time to perfect the animatronics. [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. The first flying sequence where Elliott and E.T. fly on their bicycle through the forest now had the cape of Elliott's Halloween costume flap in the wind as it appeared to have originally been intended to be, a change done to have the sequence, particularly the iconic shot of them flying past the moon, match the film's poster and the logo of Spielberg's production company [[Amblin Entertainment]]. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Mary's dialogue, during the offscreen argument with Michael about his Halloween costume, was altered to replace the word \"terrorist\" with \"hippie\". Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with [[walkie-talkie]]s.<ref name=\"20edition\"/>\n\nAt the premiere, John Williams conducted a live performance of the score.<ref>{{cite video | title = Live at the Shrine!
