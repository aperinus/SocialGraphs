This film's genesis lies with Rachel Pinchot who initially saw an article about the Whitwell Middle School in the Washington Post.  She took the idea of a film to her husband, Ari Pinchot, of The Johnson Group. The Johnson Group sent a team to Whitwell to film key moments, such as the arrival of several Holocaust survivors from New York who shared their experiences with the community. Out of that footage, Elliot Berlin created a seven-minute presentation. With help from Ergo Entertainment and its partners Donny Epstein, Yeeshai Gross, and Elie Landau (who joined the project as executive producers), this \"demo\" helped to convince the Miramax film company that this project was worth a full-length movie. It was described as being not yet another movie showing the tragedy, but a project of hope and inspiration. The movie features interviews with students, teachers, Holocaust survivors, and people who sent paper clips. It also shows how the railcar traveled from Germany to Baltimore, and then Whitwell. The creators had accumulated about 150 hours of footage. The movie was shown for the first time in November 2003 in Whitwell.\n\n==Awards==\n* Audience Choice Award - Jackson Hole Film Festival (2004), Marco Island Film Festival (2004), [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]] (2004), [[Rome International Film Festival]] (2004), [[Washington Jewish Film Festival]] (2004)\n* Cowboy Award - Jackson Hole Film Festival (2004)\n* NBR Award for Top Five Documentaries - [[National Board of Review]] (2004)\n* Best Overall Film, Best Director, Best Original Score - [[Rome International Film Festival]] (2004)\n* Nominated for an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Historical Programming (2006)<ref name=imdb>{{cite web|title=Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380615/awards|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Literature ==\n* Helene Meyers: ''The Unmarked Chains of Paper Clips'', in: [[Shofar (journal)|Shofar]], Vol. 32, No. 3 (Spring 2014), pp.&nbsp;30\u201349 (Purdue University Press)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0380615}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=paperclips|title=Paper Clips}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Paper Clips (film)}}\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:2004 documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about the Holocaust]]\n[[Category:American documentary films]]\n[[Category:Documentary films about education in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]"}]}}}}
