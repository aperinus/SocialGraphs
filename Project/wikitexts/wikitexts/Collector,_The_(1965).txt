Its plot follows a young Englishman who stalks a beautiful art student before abducting and holding her captive in the basement of his rural farmhouse. It is based on the 1963 [[The Collector|novel of the same title]] by [[John Fowles]], with the screenplay adapted by [[Stanley Mann]] and John Kohn. Wyler turned down ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' to direct the film.\n\nMost of the film was shot on soundstages in [[Los Angeles]], though exterior sequences were filmed on location in [[London]], [[Forest Row]] in [[East Sussex]] and [[Westerham]] in [[Kent]]. Filming occurred in the late spring and early summer of 1964. Wyler's original cut ran approximately three hours but was trimmed to two hours at the insistence of the studio and producer.\n\n''The Collector'' premiered at the [[1965 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1965, where both Stamp and Eggar won the awards for [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], respectively. Upon its theatrical release in June 1965, the film received largely favourable reviews. Eggar won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] for her performance, and was also nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], while Wyler received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]]. It was the last of Wyler's record 12 Academy Award nominations for Best Director.\n\n==Plot ==\nFreddie is a lonely, socially-awkward young man who purchases a farmhouse with winnings he has earned from the [[football pools]]. An amateur [[entomology|entomologist]], he spends his time capturing [[butterfly|butterflies]], of which he has a large [[insect collecting|collection]]. Frederick begins stalking a bourgeois London art student named Miranda Grey. One day, Frederick follows Miranda into a pub in [[Hampstead]] before abducting her on the street, incapacitating her with [[chloroform]].\n\nMiranda awakens inside the cavernous, windowless stone cellar of Freddie's 17th century farmhouse, which he has adorned with a bed, furnishings, clothing, painting tools, and an electric heater. Miranda assumes she has either been taken for [[ransom]] or to be used as a [[sexual slavery|sex slave]], and insists to Freddie that her father is not wealthy. Freddie explains he is not seeking sex or ransom; he explains that he and Miranda used to ride on the same bus years earlier in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and that he continued to follow her into London after she enrolled in art school. When Freddie proclaims his love for Miranda, she fakes [[appendicitis]] as a ploy to escape but is caught. Freddie agrees that he will free Miranda after four weeks, an allotted period he believes will allow her to \"get to know him\".\n\nFreddie gradually allows Miranda small luxuries, such as leaving the cellar to obtain sunlight and take baths in the house under his supervision. When Freddie fondles her aggressively, Miranda tells him she will not fight him should he rape her, but that she will lose all respect for him. During one of her baths, Freddie's neighbour, Colonel Whitcombe, arrives at the house to introduce himself, resulting in Frederick gagging Miranda and tying her to pipes in the bathroom. She floods the bathroom in an attempt to get Whitcombe's attention, but Frederick diverts him, claiming his girlfriend inadvertently left the tub running.\n\nFreddie recurrently mentions one of Miranda's boyfriends, with whom he observed her socialising on numerous occasions. He allows Miranda to write a letter to her mother, but discovers a small piece of paper in the envelope asking for help, and tears the letter apart in front of her. During a conversation about art and literature, Miranda further alienates Freddie, who accuses her of being an [[elitism|elitist]]. He proclaims that they could never be friends in \"the real world\". On the 30th\u2014and allegedly final day of her captivity, Freddie prepares a meal in the house for Miranda, and gives her a dress to wear for the occasion. Over dinner, he asks Miranda to marry him. She agrees, but Frederick senses her hesitation. She attempts to flee the house, but Freddie corners her in his study and chloroforms her before lying with her in an upstairs bedroom. When she regains consciousness in the cellar, Frederick assures Miranda he did not rape her. He tells her he intends to keep her until she \"tries\" to fall in love with him. After having a bath one night, Miranda unsuccessfully attempts to seduce him, but he senses her artifice and compares her to a prostitute.\n\nWhen he escorts her back to the cellar during a rainstorm, Miranda seizes a shovel, with which she strikes Freddie on the head. Though wounded, Freddie takes advantage of Miranda's subsequent hesitation and manages to drag her back into the cellar and she accidentally breaks the electric heater just after their struggle. Miranda remains locked in the cold cellar, soaking wet, while Frederick receives medical attention. He returns three days later to find Miranda ill with [[pneumonia]] and goes into town to get a doctor. When Freddie returns, having changed his mind about a doctor, he finds Miranda dead. Freddie buries Miranda's corpse under an oak tree on his property. A short time later, Freddie, convinced Miranda brought her fate on herself, again drives around, now stalking a young nurse in the hopes that he might have better success overall with a different sort of woman.\n\n==Production==\n===Screenplay===\nThe screenplay was written by Stanley Mann and John Kohn, based on the novel by [[John Fowles]]. However, [[Terry Southern]] contributed an uncredited script revision for Wyler after the producers became unhappy with the book's original darker ending; they wanted Miranda to escape. Southern's \"happier\" ending was rejected by Wyler.\n\n===Casting===\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n! style=\"font-size:100%;\"| Actor\n! class=\"unsortable\" |<!--non-semantic mimicry of film credit look -->\n! style=\"font-size:100%;\"| Character <!-- or \"Character\" -->\n|-\n| {{sortname|Terence|Stamp}}\n|\n| Frederick \"Freddie\" Clegg\n|-\n| {{sortname|Samantha|Eggar}}\n|\n| Miranda Grey\n|-\n| {{sortname|Mona|Washbourne}}\n|\n| Aunt Annie\n|-\n| {{sortname|Maurice|Dallimore}}\n| \n| Colonel Whitman\n|-\n| Allyson Ames\n|\n| First victim \n|-\n| {{sortname|Edina|Ronay}}\n| \n| Nurse / next victim\n|-\n|}\n\nWyler considered a number of performers for the two central roles of Freddie Clegg and Miranda Grey, around whom the film almost exclusively revolves.{{sfn|Monush|2009|pages=23\u201324}} [[Sarah Miles]] and [[Natalie Wood]] were considered for the role of Miranda, while [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Dean Stockwell]] were considered for the role of Freddie.{{sfn|Haun|2000|p=28}} Wyler ultimately chose English actors Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar because he felt that together they possessed the correct chemistry of sexual tension and awkwardness.{{sfn|Monush|2009|p=23}} Wyler was also aware that Stamp had been attracted to Eggar while the two were studying together at [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]].{{sfn|Warburton|2015|p=25}}\n\nThe supporting role of Aunt Annie was played by [[Mona Washbourne]], while [[Kenneth More]] was cast as George Paston, or \"G.P.\", a man in the source novel to whom Miranda writes to extensively, and whom she admires.
