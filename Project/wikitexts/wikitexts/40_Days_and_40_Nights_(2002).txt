The film depicts Matt Sullivan, a San Francisco web designer who has chosen to abstain from any sexual contact for the duration of [[Lent]].\n\n== Plot ==\nMatt Sullivan lives in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] with his roommate Ryan, working at a [[dot-com company]]. His obsession with his ex-girlfriend Nicole causes him [[sexual dysfunction]] with other women, which he confides to his brother John, a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priest]]-in-training. After disastrously trying to fake an orgasm with a date, Matt learns that Nicole is now engaged. Hoping to resolve his issues, he vows to [[chastity|abstain from sexual stimulation]], including masturbation, for the 40 days of [[Lent]].\n\nOn the first day of his celibacy, Matt purges his apartment of items of temptation and reminders of Nicole. He befriends a stranger named Erica at a laundromat, despite being unable to speak to her. Unbeknownst to Matt, his coworkers and Ryan start a [[betting pool|pool]] to bet on how long he can last, which soon spreads online. He revisits the laundromat to see Erica, who reveals she works as a \u201c[[content-control software|cyber nanny]]\u201d filtering internet pornography. They share an emotional connection, and Matt takes Erica on a date riding the city bus, but awkwardly avoids kissing her.\n\nThey both discover his coworkers\u2019 betting pool, complete with its own website. Matt tries to explain his intentions but Erica remains upset, and Matt\u2019s boss decides to join him in celibacy. Having fallen for Matt, she agrees to another date, where they run into Nicole and her fianc\u00e9. Frustrated by Matt\u2019s vow and his feelings for Nicole, Erica leaves him. Struggling with his urges, Matt is forced to endure his coworkers\u2019 attempts to sabotage him. He turns to his brother for help, but even a family dinner results in their parents discussing their own sex life.\n\nBy Day 35 of Matt\u2019s vow, the pool has reached $18,000, and a colleague convinces him to give in. As Matt marches into the bathroom to masturbate, he discovers his boss \u2013 who accidentally had a [[Sildenafil|Viagra]]-spiked drink intended for Matt \u2013 masturbating in the next stall. With the entire office waiting, Matt escapes through the bathroom window and goes to Erica. They reconcile, and spend a night of intimacy together without actual intercourse.\n\nOn Day 38, Matt has an inadvertent erection at work and is sent home. Nicole arrives at his apartment, having broken up with her cheating fianc\u00e9, but Matt rejects her advances and sends her away, which only excites her more. Overhearing the bet the next day, she goes to Matt\u2019s coworkers, adding her own $3,500 to the pot and discovering that Matt has plans to celebrate with Erica at midnight when his vow ends.\n\nOn Day 40, the long-suffering Matt is unable to stop picturing women naked. He walks in on his brother kissing a nun; tormented by Matt\u2019s exploits, John is taking a sabbatical from the priesthood. Fighting to contain himself, Matt has Ryan handcuff him to his bed, and awakens from an erotic dream to find Nicole has [[rape by gender#Rape of males by females|raped]] him while he was asleep, just before midnight. Arriving as Nicole is leaving, Erica assumes Matt was unfaithful and dishonored his vow, and storms out.\n\nDetermined to win Erica back, Matt gives her a box of moments they had shared; he finds her at the laundromat, and they finally kiss. As they consummate their relationship in Matt\u2019s bedroom for hours, Ryan and the coworkers wait outside and place new bets on how long he can last, until Matt kicks them all out.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as Matt Sullivan\n* [[Shannyn Sossamon]] as Erica Sutton\n* [[Paulo Costanzo]] as Ryan\n* [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] as Sam\n* [[Vinessa Shaw]] as Nicole\n* Adam Trese as John Sullivan\n* [[Griffin Dunne]] as Jerry Anderson\n* [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] as Mandy\n* [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] as Susie\n* [[Monet Mazur]] as Candy\n* [[Christine Chatelain]] as Andie\n* [[Mike Maronna]] as Bagel Boy\n* [[Stanley Anderson]] as Father Maher\n* Lorin Heath as Diana\n* [[Glenn Fitzgerald]] as Chris\n* [[Jarrad Paul]] as Duncan\n* [[Terry Chen]] as Neil\n* Kai Lennox as Nick\n* [[Chris Gauthier]] as Mikey\n* [[Barry Newman]] as Walter Sullivan\n* [[Mary Gross]] as Bev Sullivan\n* [[Dylan Neal]] as David Brokaw\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Anchor|Writing|Development|Filming}}\nWriter Rob Perez said they pitched the film to every studio in town, and eventually got a deal. Perez turned in the first draft a few months later and the film was [[greenlit]]. Thirteen months after having sold the pitch, filming began. The film was released a year-and-a-half later. \nIn retrospect Perez noted how lucky he was that the film got made: \"At the time I believed the film was made because of the script. However, in retrospect I believe it was made because of a confluence of a 20 completely random stars aligning. This included an influx of money at the studio from a new partnership; their recent films had been hits; young comedies like mine were connecting at the time; a few bankable actors in the age range wanted to play the lead; the executive(s) happened to like (or at least think it was commercial) the concept/script; and that the producer was hungry enough that when he hit road blocks, he found other ways to keep moving forward. I can go on, but hope this is enough to illustrate my point: the film was made because of 20 things that had nothing to do with the script.\"<ref name=\"filmmakermagazine\">{{cite web |date= September 9, 2009 |last=Guerrasio |first=Jason |title=From Hollywood to nobody |url=https://filmmakermagazine.com/4731-from-hollywood-to-nobody-by-rob-perez/ |website=Filmmaker Magazine |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130920184035/https://filmmakermagazine.com/4731-from-hollywood-to-nobody-by-rob-perez/ |archive-date= 2013-09-20 |url-status=live |access-date=2020-05-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot primarily in Vancouver, but also featured some San Francisco locations,<ref name=\"McCarthy\" /> including [[Potrero Hill, San Francisco]], [[California]].\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Anchor|Critics|Reception}} \nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 39% based on reviews from 137 critics, with an average rating of 4.90/10.
