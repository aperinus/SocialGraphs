It is one of three such prequels, alongside ''[[Blade Runner Black Out 2022]]'' and ''[[2036: Nexus Dawn]]''. The short was released on September 16, 2017, approximately three weeks before the release of the feature film, and features [[Dave Bautista]] as ''Blade Runner 2049'' character Sapper Morton, alongside [[Orion Ben]]. The film was written by [[Hampton Fancher]] and [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], who also wrote the feature film, and directed by [[Luke Scott (director)|Luke Scott]], whose father [[Ridley Scott]] directed the original ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and is executive producer on the sequel ''Blade Runner 2049''.\n\nThe film takes place in Los Angeles in 2048, one year before the events of ''Blade Runner 2049'', and tells the story of Morton's protecting of a mother and daughter from thugs, ultimately leading to his status as a replicant being reported.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Los Angeles]], in 2048, Sapper Morton is shown weeping hysterically into a mirror. He washes his face in a sink and puts on his glasses. Walking through a crowded street, he is briefly accosted by a group of thugs, whom he ignores. Greeted by Ella, he gives her the book ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'' to read, a book that he enjoyed. Leaving, Sapper goes to a market to sell [[leech]]es he has farmed, being paid $3,000, which is $1,000 less than Sapper needs. After leaving the market, Sapper sees Ella and her mother about to be sexually assaulted by the group of thugs he had earlier ignored. Angered, Sapper proceeds to savagely beat the group and kills most of them, demonstrating superhuman strength and endurance in the process. Seeing Ella and her mother terrified at the violence, a remorseful Sapper leaves the scene, having dropped his identification papers. A spectator, having watched Sapper earlier, calls the [[LAPD]] to inform them that he thinks he has found a rogue \"[[Replicant|skin-job]]\".\n\n===Chinese prologue===\n\nThe Chinese version of the film has a prologue consisting of a wall of text before the film begins. The text explains that replicant production was banned after \"the Blackout\" in 2022, leading to the bankruptcy of the Tyrell Corporation; additionally, the text explains that the Earth's ecosystem has been on the brink of collapse since the mid-2020s. Niander Wallace, the blind CEO of the Wallace Corporation, is explained to have acquired the Tyrell Corporation, and have begun to develop a new generation of replicants to serve as a slave force to help rebuild the Earth's environment. This prologue previously appeared before ''Blade Runner'' short film ''[[2036: Nexus Dawn]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StsX9bGRseo/|title=\u3010\u9280\u7ffc\u6bba\u624b 2049\u3011\u524d\u50b3\u5f71\u7247: \u8b1d\u6ce2\u6469\u9813\u7684\u771f\u5be6\u8eab\u5206|last=Sony Pictures Taiwan Youtube|date=September 15, 2017|access-date=October 4, 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Dave Bautista]] as Sapper Morton, a [[replicant|Nexus-8 replicant]].\n* Gerard Miller as Salt\n* Gaia Ottman as Ella\n* Bj\u00f6rn Freiberg as spectator\n* [[Orion Ben]] as Ella's mother\n* [[Adam Savage]] as shop patron (cameo)\n\n==Release==\nOn August 29, 2017, it was announced that [[Denis Villeneuve]] had selected various filmmakers to direct three short films exploring incidents that occurred between the events of ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]''.
