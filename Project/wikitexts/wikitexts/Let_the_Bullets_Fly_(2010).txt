Ma's train is derailed, killing both his bodyguards and his adviser, Counsellor Tang (\u6c64\u5e08\u7237 ''Tang-shiye''; [[Feng Xiaogang]]).  Ma has no money, having spent it all to bribe and buy his position.  To avoid being killed by Zhang's bandits, he lies to them claiming that he is Counsellor Tang and that his wife ([[Carina Lau]]) was the dead governor's wife.  He tells the bandits that, if they spare him and his wife, he will help Zhang to impersonate Ma and pilfer Goose Town's finances.\n\nAt Goose Town, Zhang's appointment is opposed by local mobster boss Master Huang (\u9ec4\u8001\u7237 ''Huang-laoye''; [[Chow Yun Fat]]), who lives in a fortified citadel.  Huang greets the governor's party by sending his best hat in a palanquin instead of himself.  Ma tells Zhang that previous governors would split with Huang the majority of taxes levied from the town residents. However, Zhang is not interested in taking money from the poor.\n\nChampion Wu (\u6b66\u4e3e\u4eba ''Wu-juren''; [[Jiang Wu]]), one of Huang's subordinates, severely injures a citizen, and as governor Zhang rules against Wu in the town court.  In retaliation, Huang frames Zhang's godson, Six (\u8001\u516d ''Lao-liu''), for theft.  Six kills himself in the process of proving his innocence.  Zhang vows to destroy Huang, but Ma advises him to use cunning rather than brute force.  Huang invites Zhang to a meal at his citadel, and there Huang pretends to have his subordinates killed as a sign of good faith.  Not realizing the governor is actually the bandit chief, Huang raises a plan to hunt down and kill Zhang Mazi.  Zhang pretends to agree to this plan, so long as Huang finances the expedition.\n\nThat night, Huang disguises his subordinates as Mazi's bandits and sends them to assassinate Zhang while he is asleep.  However, only Ma's wife is killed.  In grief, Ma reveals his true identity as governor to Zhang.  During the funeral for Ma's wife, Zhang has his bandits kidnap Huang and the heads of Goose Town's two leading families for ransom.  They quickly discover they have captured Huang's [[look-alike]].  The town raises the ransom money but Zhang refuses to take it, instead returning it to the townsfolk.  As they do so, Flora (\u82b1\u59d0 ''Huajie''), a young prostitute in Huang's custody, discovers their identity.  She is captured by Zhang's gang but becomes friendly with Two (\u8001\u4e8c ''Lao-er'') and Three (\u8001\u4e09 ''Lao-san'') and later stays on as a bandit member, helping them to guard Huang's look-alike.  Huang sends his own subordinates, also disguised as bandits, to retrieve the money handed back to the town.\n\nA random woman approaches Ma, claiming that he seduced her while in Shanxi, and that he is the father of her son. As compensation, Ma gives them two jewels.\n\nHuang tries to kill Zhang again by sending subordinates to his house, disguised as masked bandits. The plan fails and Huang's men are shot to death. As such, Huang is forced to supply the money for Zhang's Anti Bandit Expedition. When Huang's steward obtains a portrait of the real Governor Ma, and Huang confronts Zhang, Ma confesses that he is the real governor, and pretends that Zhang is his nephew. As the Expedition goes ahead, Huang employs a fake Zhang Mazi to kill Zhang, and also sends men to plant a landmine on the road. In the ensuing battle, Two is killed, but the fake Zhang Mazi is captured. To avoid death, he offers Zhang two jewels, and admits that he obtained them by robbing and killing a woman and her son. Ma recognizes the jewels, and is filled with grief, and tries to travel to Shanxi, but drives over the landmine and is killed.\n\nZhang vows revenge and returns to Goose Town for a showdown with Huang.  He scatters money to the townsfolk and Huang gathers it up the next day; then Zhang scatters firearms to the townsfolk and prevents Huang from gathering them.  Zhang and his bandits put on a show of attacking the citadel, then publicly beheads Huang's look-alike to convince the townsfolk that Huang is dead and the one in the citadel is the look-alike. The townsfolk are reassured and storm the citadel with their new weapons.  Zhang gives Huang a gun with one bullet left for his own suicide.  However, a moment later, Huang stands on top of his own citadel and fires the gun into the air to get Zhang's attention.  He throws a hat better than the one he originally sent to greet Zhang off the roof, as he promised.  He then walks back into the citadel, killing himself with his own landmine.\n\nThree intends to marry Flora and the surviving bandits leave for Shanghai to lead a more peaceful life.  They take the train through the mountains, Zhang riding after them.\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Jiang Wen]] went over 30 drafts of the film's script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2010-12/24/content_21612391.htm|title=Pulling out all the stops to Let the Bullets Fly|access-date=December 30, 2010|date=December 24, 2010|work=[[China Daily]]}}</ref>\n\nParts of the filming were done on location in the [[Kaiping]] [[diaolou]] in [[Guangdong]], China.<ref>[http://english.cri.cn/6566/2010/12/03/1881s608371.htm Kaiping \"Diaolou\" - Location of \"Let the Bullets Fly\"], CRI English.com, December 3, 2010</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Let the Bullets Fly'' was originally scheduled for a release in September 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/record-china-bo-already-being-targetted|title=Record China BO already being targetted|access-date=December 29, 2010|date=March 4, 2010|author=Frater, Patrick|work=Film Business Asia}}</ref> The release date was postponed as a spokesperson for [[Emperor Motion Pictures]] stated that \"There is a lot of post-production to be done and it has to be done properly.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/bullets-autumn-release-shot-down|work=Film Business Asia|title=Bullets autumn release shot down|date=June 9, 2010|access-date=December 30, 2010}}</ref> The film premiered in [[Beijing]] on December 6, 2010, with wide release in Mainland China on December 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/jiang-takes-new-aim-at-december|title=Jiang takes new aim at December|work=Film Business Asia|author=Frater, Patrick|date=July 12, 2010|access-date=December 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2010-12/08/content_21499994.htm|title=Let the Bullets Fly premieres in Beijing|work=China.org.cn|date=December 8, 2010|access-date=December 30, 2010}}</ref> ''Let the Bullets Fly'' was released in Hong Kong on January 13, 2011.<ref name=\"fba-review\">{{cite web|title=Let the Bullets Fly (\u8b93\u5b50\u5f48\u98db)|work=Film Business Asia|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/let-the-bullets-fly|author=Elley, Derek|date=January 3, 2011|access-date=January 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bullets-guns-chinese-box-office-61499|work=Hollywood Reporter|title='Bullets' Guns Down Chinese Box Office|date=December 19, 2010|access-date=December 30, 2010|author=Chu, Karen}}</ref> The film has become the highest grossing Chinese film, beating the record set by  ''[[Aftershock (2010 film)|Aftershock]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/bullets-shoots-bo-record-fires-up-on-line|work=Film Business Asia|title=Bullets shoots BO record, fires up on line|author=Frater, Patrick|date=January 21, 2011|access-date=January 21, 2011}}</ref>  Following ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]],'' this film is now the second highest-grossing film ever released in China.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?let_the_bullets_fly_becomes_highest_grossing_domestic_film_in_china_16401.aspx | title = Let the Bullets Fly becomes highest grossing domestic film in China | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = 2011-02-18 | access-date = 2011-02-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140911075743/http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?let_the_bullets_fly_becomes_highest_grossing_domestic_film_in_china_16401.aspx | archive-date = 2014-09-11 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n''Let the Bullets Fly'' had its American premiere at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in 2011.
