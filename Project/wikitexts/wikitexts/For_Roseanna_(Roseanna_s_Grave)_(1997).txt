But it's a small, sweet film that never tries for more than it's sure of, and the actors find it such a relief to be playing such goodhearted characters that we can almost feel it.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=July 25, 1997 |title=For Roseanna |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970725/REVIEWS/707250302/1023 |work=Chicago Sun-Times}} ''For Roseanna'' was the name given to the film in its festival release.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{No plot|date=August 2021}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Marcello\n* [[Mercedes Ruehl]] as Roseanna\n* [[Polly Walker]] as Cecilia\n* [[Mark Frankel]] as Antonio\n* [[Trevor Peacock]] as Fredo Iaccoponi\n* [[Fay Ripley]] as Francesca\n* [[George Rossi]] as Sergeant Baggio\n* [[Alfredo Varelli]] as Shop Owner (final film role)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0120034|title=Roseanna's Grave}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|for_roseanna|Roseanna's Grave}}\n*{{Mojo title|forroseanna|Roseanna's Grave}}\n\n{{Paul Weiland}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1990s romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American romantic comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:PolyGram Filmed Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:Fiction about cemeteries]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Trevor Jones]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Paul Weiland]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s American films]]\n\n\n{{1990s-comedy-drama-film-stub}}"}]}}}}
