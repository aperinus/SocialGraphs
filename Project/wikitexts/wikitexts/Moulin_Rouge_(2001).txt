It follows a young English poet, Christian, who falls in love with the star of the [[Moulin Rouge]], [[cabaret]] actress and [[courtesan]] Satine. The film uses the musical setting of the [[Montmartre|Montmartre Quarter]] of [[Paris]] and is the final part of Luhrmann's \"[[Red Curtain Trilogy]],\" following ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'' (1992) and ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' (1996). A co-production of Australia and the United States, it stars [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Ewan McGregor]].  [[John Leguizamo]], [[Jim Broadbent]], and [[Richard Roxburgh]] feature in supporting roles.\n\n''Moulin Rouge!'' premiered at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] and was  released in theaters on 18 May 2001 in North America and on 25 May 2001 in Australia. The film was praised for Luhrmann's direction, the performances of the cast, its soundtrack, costume design, and production values. It was also a commercial success, grossing $179.2 million on a $50 million budget. At the [[74th Academy Awards]], the film received eight nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won two ([[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]). In [[BBC]]'s 2016 poll of the 21st century's 100 greatest films, ''Moulin Rouge!'' ranked 53rd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|title=The 21st century's 100 greatest films|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=23 August 2016|access-date=14 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200515161006/https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|archive-date=15 May 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1900 in [[Paris]], Christian, a young writer in mourning for his deceased love, begins writing their story.\n\nA year earlier, he arrives in Paris to join the [[Bohemianism|Bohemian movement]]. He suddenly meets [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and his troupe of performers who are writing a play called ''Spectacular Spectacular''. After Christian helps them complete the play, they go to the [[Moulin Rouge]] where they hope Christian\u2019s talents will impress Satine, the star performer and [[courtesan]], and that she will in turn convince Harold Zidler, the proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, to let Christian write the show. However, Zidler plans to have a wealthy and powerful Duke sleep with Satine in exchange for the financing to convert the club into a theater.\n\nThat night, Satine mistook Christian for the Duke and tries to seduce him, but eventually Christian reveals himself. The Duke catches Christian with Satine. To prevent the Duke from leaving, Satine claims that the two of them and the Bohemians were rehearsing ''Spectacular Spectacular''. The Duke asks about the plot of the play, so Christian and the Bohemians improvise a story about a beautiful [[India]]n courtesan who falls in love with a poor [[sitar]] player she mistook for an evil [[maharaja]]. Approving the story, the Duke agrees to invest, but only if Satine and the Moulin Rouge are turned over to him. Later, Satine claims not to be in love with Christian, but he eventually wears down her resolve and they kiss.\n\nDuring construction at the Moulin Rouge, Christian and Satine\u2019s love deepens while the Duke becomes frustrated with all the time he thinks Satine is spending with Christian working on the play. To calm him, Zidler arranges for Satine to spend the night with The Duke and angrily tells her to end their affair. She misses the dinner when she falls unconscious, leading a doctor to diagnose a fatal case of [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. She does try to end things, but Christian writes a secret song to include in the show that affirms their love no matter how dire the circumstances.\n\nAt the final rehearsal, Nini hints to the Duke about Christian's and Satine's relationship. The Duke demands that the show ends with the courtesan marrying the maharaja, instead of Christian\u2019s ending where she marries the sitar player. Satine promises to spend the night with him after which they will decide on the ending. Ultimately, she fails to seduce the Duke due to her feelings for Christian, and Le Chocolat saves her from the enraged Duke attempting to rape her. Christian decides that he and Satine should leave the show behind and run away to be together while the Duke promises to kill Christian.\n\nZidler finds Satine in her dressing room packing. He tells her that her illness is fatal and that the Duke is planning on murdering Christian, and that if she wants Christian to live, she will cut him off completely and be with the Duke. Mustering all her acting abilities, she complies, leaving Christian devastated.\n\nOn the opening night of the show, in front of a full audience, Christian vows to leave Satine and give her to the Duke. Satine sings their secret song and he changes his mind. After the company thwarts several attempts to kill Christian, the show ends with Christian and Satine proclaiming their love. The audience erupts in applause, but Satine collapses after the curtains close. Before dying, she tells Christian to write their story so she will always be with him. The Duke leaves for good.\n\nIn the present, the Moulin Rouge is in disrepair, the Duke and the Bohemians are gone, and Christian finishes his and Satine\u2019s story, declaring their love will live forever.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Satine\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as Christian\n* [[Jim Broadbent]] as Harold Zidler\n* [[Richard Roxburgh]] as The Duke of Monroth\n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]\n* [[Jacek Koman]] as The Unconscious Argentinean{{efn|This character is often referred to as The Narcoleptic Argentinean, as he does not spend his entire time on screen unconscious.

How uncool they were \u2013 how their coolness had been ripped aside and how they were united in this singular sharing of the story. The thrill of thinking, 'Could we ever do that in the West? Could we ever get past that cerebral cool and perceived cool.' It required this idea of comic-tragedy. Could you make those switches? Fine in [[Shakespeare]] \u2013 low comedy and then you die in five minutes. . . . In ''Moulin Rouge!'', we went further.

The filmmakers projected the Orpheus figure onto Christian by characterizing the latter as a musical [[genius]] whose talent surpassed that of everyone else in his world. The film's use of songs from the mid- to late 20th century in the 1899 setting makes Christian appear ahead of his time as a musician and writer. ''Moulin Rouge!''\u2032s plot also parallels that of the myth: \"McGregor, as a poet who spouts deathless verse . . . , descends into a hellish underworld of prostitution and musical entertainment in order to retrieve Kidman, the singing courtesan who loves him but is enslaved to a diabolical duke.

Kathryn Conner Bennett and Mina Yang hold that the film satisfies the postmodern paradigm described by Jim Collins through its aesthetic expression. Elaborating on this, Conner Bennett states that ''Moulin Rouge!'' utilizes Collins' concept of \"the array,\" in which signs and symbols are recycled to engender \"postmodern cultural life.\"{{sfn|Conner Bennett|p=114}} She argues that Luhrmann's use of familiar \"narrative elements\" (such as popular songs) in the film requires viewers to employ \"[[hypertext (semiotics)|hypertextuality]]\"  to understand and interpret the work, and that not all audiences would be able to make the \"cognitive leap\" required to create meaning from the narrative.{{sfn|Conner Bennett|p=114-115}} According to Yang, ''Moulin Rouge!'' \"serve[s] as [a critique] of both [[avant-garde]] \u00e9litism and stuffy traditionalism\"<ref name=Yang>{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Mina|title=''Moulin Rouge!'' and the undoing of opera|journal=[[Cambridge Opera Journal]]|volume=20|issue=3|page=281|date=November 2008|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-opera-journal/article/abs/moulin-rouge-and-the-undoing-of-opera/F8AF8DD30AF79894B153E9BB13A24BE3|doi=10.1017/S095458670999005X|s2cid=194085131|issn=1474-0621}}</ref> by combining and alluding to different forms of \"\u00e9lite\" and \"pop\" art.{{sfn|Yang|p=269}}\n\nThe film's music forms the foundation of its postmodern aesthetic. Marsha Kinder and Mina Yang have noted ''Moulin Rouge!''\u2019s [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] as a movie musical, holding that the film incorporates a variety of genre conventions (including \"[[comedy]], [[parody]], and [[satire]]\"){{sfn|Kinder|p=52}} along with a significant amount of added [[irony]].{{sfn|Yang|p=269}} Notably, ''Moulin Rouge!'' combines mid-to-late 20th Century melodies and lyrics with a narrative set in ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' [[France]], a locale Kinder identifies as \"the proverbial international center for [[modernism]].\" \"The gap in historical periods (between the supposed vintage of [Luhrmann\u2019s] characters and the obvious youth of their songs) freely acknowledges the contemporary nature of this vision of Parisian modernism without any trace of nostalgia.\"{{sfn|Kinder|p=54}} Yang notes that Luhrmann \"delights in pointing out the difference between the original and the simulation\" with regard to the film's soundtrack.{{sfn|Yang|p=272}} Kinder contends that ''Moulin Rouge!''\u2019s \"renarrativized lyrics are never disturbing, for they are usually more innocent here than in their original source, and that\u2019s precisely the point.\"{{sfn|Kinder|p=54}} The use of famous popular songs in a new, original context requires audiences to reinterpret their significance within the framework of the narrative and challenge the assumption that music's symbolism is static.{{sfn|Conner Bennett|p=114}}{{sfn|Kinder|p=53-54}}\n\n''Moulin Rouge!'' also makes ample use of other postmodern filmmaking techniques, including fragmentation and [[juxtaposition]]. As the film's protagonist, Christian is the primary source of ''Moulin Rouge!''\u2019s story line and many portions of the story are told from his point of view. However, the narrative is fragmented on several occasions when the film deviates from Christian\u2019s perspective or integrates a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. ''Moulin Rouge!'' also juxtaposes a play-within-a-film (''Spectacular Spectacular'') with the film\u2019s events themselves to draw parallels between the plot of the play and the characters\u2019 lives. This culminates in the \"Come What May\" sequence, which reveals the development of Christian and Satine's relationship alongside the progression of ''Spectacular Spectacular''\u2019s rehearsals.{{sfn|Conner Bennett|p=115}}\n\nPostmodernism is also evident in ''Moulin Rouge!''\u2019s homage to \"the international scope of the musical,\" says Kinder, citing the influence of Bollywood [[masala film]]s alongside Western filmmaking genres on the film's overall style.{{sfn|Kinder|p=52}} The film is also heavily indebted to ''Strictly Ballroom,'' which she characterizes as a \"[[transculturalism|transcultural]] concoction.\"{{sfn|Kinder|p=52-53}} ''Moulin Rouge!''\u2019s celebration of the cross-cultural aesthetic \"also extends to globalizing postmodernist spin-offs like [the] [[music video]].\"{{sfn|Kinder|p=53}}\n\nYang states that the plot, style, and themes of ''Moulin Rouge!'' serve as a foundation for understanding ways in which \"sex, class, [[exoticism]], authorship and performance\" are represented in stage and film.{{sfn|Yang|p=271}} The film's blending of opera and Hollywood musical enables its interpretation through the \"[[feminism|feminist]], [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]], and [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]]\" lenses of contemporary opera scholarship.{{sfn|Yang|p=270-271}} Yet, despite the film's postmodern stylings, Conner Bennett argues that  ''Moulin Rouge!'' is not a feminist text because it \"ultimately upholds the [[patriarchy|patriarchical]] execution of the female muse, which allows the male artist to create art via her death.\"{{sfn|Conner Bennett|p=111}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\nThe film was selected by the [[National Board of Review]] as the best film of 2001.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web |title=Moulin Rouge named best film of 2001|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/dec/06/news1 |website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=6 December 2001|access-date=21 December 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221162142/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/dec/06/news1|archive-date=21 December 2019}}</ref> It picked up six [[Golden Globe]] nominations including Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy (for Nicole Kidman), Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy (for Ewan McGregor), Best Original Score (for Craig Armstrong), Best Director (for Baz Luhrmann) and Best Song (\"Come What May\").
