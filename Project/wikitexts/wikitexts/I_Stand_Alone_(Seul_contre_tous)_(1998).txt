The film, focusing on several pivotal days in the life of a butcher facing abandonment, isolation, rejection and unemployment, was the director's first feature-length production, and is a [[sequel]] to his 1991 [[short film]] ''[[Carne (film)|Carne]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens by revealing the history of the Butcher (who's given no other name) presented in narration which plays over a montage of still photographs: Orphaned at a young age, he was sexually abused by a priest. As a teenager, unable to have the opportunity to study and learn the profession of his choice, he reluctantly embraces the career of a butcher specializing in horse meat, a job already frowned upon at the time in France.\n\nAfter several years of hard work, he finally opens his own butcher shop while his girlfriend gives birth to a daughter. When the woman realizes the infant is not a boy, she leaves the young father alone with the child. Embracing it as fate, the Butcher decides to take care of his daughter alone. As the single father is consumed by loneliness, he starts to become overprotective and develops [[incest]]uous feelings for his child. One day, when he sees blood on her skirt, he thinks she's been raped and stabs the man he thinks is responsible only to find out it was only menstrual blood. He is sentenced to prison and forced to sell his shop to a Muslim butcher while his troubled daughter is sent to an institution.\n\nIn prison, the Butcher has sex with a cellmate and (upon his release) he vows to forget it all happened. He finds a job working as a bartender for the woman who owns the tavern where he was a regular customer. They begin dating and soon she becomes pregnant. As they start making plans for their future together, she sells her business and they move to northern France, where she said she would buy a butcher shop for him.\n\nThere, however, she backs out of their promise, which forces him to take up a job as a nightwatchman at a nursing home. During his job, he meets a young and caring nurse who's the complete opposite of his old, icy mistress. After he and the nurse witness the death of an elderly patient, the Butcher thinks back about the lack of affection throughout his life, from the orphanage to a life with an uncaring mistress who abuses the power she has over him because of her money. When his mistress unjustly accuses him of having an affair with the nurse, he snaps and punches her in the belly several times, very likely killing their unborn child, before fleeing the scene with a pistol.\n\nHe decides to return to Paris, where he rents the same [[flophouse]] room where he conceived his daughter and begins looking for a job as a horse meat butcher. Unfortunately, due to the changing tastes of customers during his time in prison, the market for horse meat winds up collapsing. Despite his patience, his job interviews consistently end up with rejection. He broadens his job search but is considered unskilled in terms of general butchery, forcing him to have to start all over again at the very bottom.\n\nHe starts looking outside his branch, but the more he broadens his searches, the more humiliating the job interviews become. He remains polite, but the more desperate he becomes, the more quickly he's rejected by managers. When he turns to his old friends for advice, they all reject him. After being turned away at a slaughterhouse that once did business with his shop, the Butcher decides to kill the slaughterhouse manager. He plots the murder at a local tavern but is ejected from the bar at gunpoint after squabbling with the owner's son. The Butcher finds that he has only three bullets in his gun and begins assigning them to the men he feels have humiliated him the most.\n\nFeeling more and more isolated, he decides to look for the only person he feels has ever loved him: His daughter. After meeting her at the asylum in which she is a patient, he takes her back to his room where he is prey to opposite feelings towards her. As he is about to lose his sanity, he contemplates having sex with his daughter before killing her. After the representation of this fantasy, the movie returns to the moment of the Butcher's hesitation. He decides to put the gun away, resolving to be good, and tearfully embraces his daughter. But he starts again to contemplate having sex with her in the same manner he did with her mother.\n\nStanding at a window, he unzips his daughter's jacket and begins fondling her. As he starts to abuse his daughter, the Butcher, between more and more incoherent thoughts, tries to justify his act by asserting that the world condemns his love for his daughter, surely not because it is evil but because it is too powerful.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Philippe Nahon]] as the Butcher\n* Blandine Lenoir as his daughter, Cynthia\n* Frankye Pain as his Mistress\n* Martine Audrain as his Mother-in-Law\n* Roland Gu\u00e9ridon as his Old Friend\n* A\u00efssa Djabri as Dr. Choukroun\n* G\u00e9rard Ortega as the Bar Owner\n* Alain Pierre as the Owner's Son\n* Zaven as the Man with Morality\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by Les Cin\u00e9mas de la Zone, a production company run by director No\u00e9 and his girlfriend [[Lucile Had\u017eihalilovi\u0107]]. It was shot in an unusual combination of [[16 mm film]] and the [[CinemaScope]] format. Recording took place sporadically over a period of two and a half years, with frequent budget problems. The fashion designer [[agn\u00e8s b.]] eventually granted a loan which No\u00e9 says saved his production company. The gimmick of having a warning text before the story's climax was borrowed from [[William Castle]]'s 1961 film ''[[Homicidal]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Travis|year=1999|title=Brace Yourself for 'I Stand Alone'|journal=[[Fangoria]]|publisher=[[Kerry O'Quinn|O'Quinn Studios]]|issue=182|pages=68&ndash;70|issn=0164-2111}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2010 interview, No\u00e9 came up with the idea of the butcher character following a conversation he had with his father as a teenager. The [[Argentinian]]-born No\u00e9 was traveling to his mother's native France for the first time, and upon landing in Paris, his father turned to him and said: \"They eat horses here\" (referring to the French consumption of [[horse meat]], which is unheard of in Argentina). No\u00e9 then decided that a horse meat butcher would make a great character in a film, and this formed the basis for his first short ''Carne''.\n\n==Style==\nMost of the film's script consists of the Butcher's [[internal monologue]], spoken in [[voice-over]].\n\nThe camera is usually stationary throughout the film, but this trend is sometimes contrasted by abrupt, rapid movements. The sudden movements are always accompanied by a loud sound effect, usually an explosive gunshot. A notable exception is the final [[crane shot]], which moves gently away from the Butcher's window and turns to look down an empty street.\n\nThe film frequently cuts to [[Intertitle|title cards]] that display a variety of messages. The cards often repeat a notable word spoken by the Butcher, such as \"Morality\" and \"Justice\". At the film's climax, a \"Warning\" title card counts down 30 seconds, gives viewers an opportunity to stop watching and avoid the remainder of the film.\n\n==Film connections==\nThe film is a [[sequel]] to No\u00e9's [[short film]] ''[[Carne (film)|Carne]]''. The Butcher also makes a [[cameo appearance]] at the beginning of ''[[Irr\u00e9versible]]'', Noe's follow-up to ''I Stand Alone''. In a drunken [[monologue]], the Butcher reveals that he was arrested for having sex with his daughter.\n\n==Accolades==\n* [[International Critics' Week]] Award at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]]\n* Official Selection of Telluride, Toronto, New York, Rotterdam, San Francisco, Sundance film festivals.\n* Selected as a favourite film by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] to present as his [[Maryland Film Festival#John Waters picks|annual selection]] within [[Maryland Film Festival]] 2003.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0157016}}\n* {{AllMovie title|162718}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|i_stand_alone}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160212081912/http://eltornillodeklaus.com/2012/09/02/gaspar-noe/ Gaspar No\u00e9, todo es cuesti\u00f3n de moral]\n\n{{Gaspar No\u00e9}}\n{{Heart of Sarajevo Best Film}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I Stand Alone}}\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1998 crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1998 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:1990s French films]]\n[[Category:1990s French-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Gaspar No\u00e9]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:French crime drama films]]\n[[Category:French psychological drama films]]\n[[Category:Heart of Sarajevo Award for Best Film winners]]\n[[Category:Incest in film]]"}]}}}}
