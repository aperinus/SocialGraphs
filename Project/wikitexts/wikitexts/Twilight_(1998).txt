The film's original score was composed by [[Elmer Bernstein]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb]],  grossing $15.1&nbsp;million against its $20&nbsp;million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nAging private detective Harry Ross, an ex-cop, is working on a case to return 17-year-old runaway Mel Ames to her parents' home. He tracks down Mel and her sleazy boyfriend, Jeff Willis, at a Mexican resort. During a struggle, Mel accidentally shoots Harry with his pistol, striking him in the upper thigh.\n\nThe plot picks up two years later, when Ross is living in Southern California in the guest quarters of Mel's wealthy parents, Jack and Catherine Ames. They are former movie stars, now in the twilight of their careers. Jack is dying of cancer, which is out of remission, and he and Ross pass time playing cards.\n\nOne day, Jack asks a favor of Harry: to deliver a package to an address in Los Angeles. It turns out to be the first development in a series of twists and turns in a 20-year-old case involving the disappearance of Catherine's ex-husband.\n\nWhen Harry arrives at the address, he encounters a man named Ivar, who has just been fatally shot and shoots at Harry. Harry is detained by police, including former colleague Lt. Verna Hollander. At the police station, he runs into another (now retired) old pal and colleague, Raymond Hope.\n\nVerna and Raymond are both sympathetic, as they had heard rumors that Harry suffered damage to his genitals when shot in Mexico. Harry explains that he was only shot in the thigh.\n\nHarry likes Catherine, who flirts with him from time to time. He acts as an agent for Jack and Catherine, who are being blackmailed by Jeff, now out of prison, and his parole officer Gloria Lamar.\n\nHarry and Catherine have sex for the first (and only) time. Jack angrily realizes this when he has a heart attack that same night, and Catherine responds to his call for help wearing Harry's shirt.\n\nHarry, meanwhile, is forced to acknowledge that his friends have deceived and manipulated him.\n\nRaymond tries to persuade Harry to get away from it all, but Harry has figured out that Raymond was a conspirator in the murder of Catherine's first husband 20 years before. Raymond shoots at Harry, but Harry kills him first. Following this shooting, Harry reconciles with Catherine and Jack. He leaves town with Verna.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Paul Newman]] as Harry Ross\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Catherine Ames\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Jack Ames\n* [[Reese Witherspoon]] as Mel Ames\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Lieutenant Verna Hollander\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Reuben Escobar\n* [[Liev Schreiber]] as Jeff Willis\n* [[Margo Martindale]] as Gloria 'Mucho' Lamar\n* [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as Captain Phil Egan\n* [[M.

While the film featured many notable [[A-list]] actors, ''Twilight'''s budget of $20&nbsp;million and gross revenue of $15,055,091 indicates that it was a [[box office bomb]] after being in theatres for eight weeks.<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, as it holds a 59% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 56 reviews. The consensus states: \"It suffers from a frustratingly deliberate pace, but with nuanced performances from Paul Newman, Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon and Reese Witherspoon to fall back on, ''Twilight'' can't help but be compelling\".\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] wrote,\n<blockquote>\"The reason to see the film is to observe how relaxed and serene Paul Newman is before the camera. How, at 73, he has absorbed everything he needs to know about how to be a movie actor, so that at every moment he is at home in his skin, and the skin of his character. It's sad to see all that assurance used in the service of a plot so worn and mechanical.\"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/twilight-1998 ''Twilight''], Roger Ebert, 6 March 1998,accessed 18 April 2016</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave the film a C+ grade. He wrote it was meant to be \"...about the relationship between a semiretired gumshoe (Paul Newman) and two veteran movie stars (Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon)...\" but was more \"...about the trio of aging stars who play them.\"<ref name=\"ew.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,282246,00.html|title=Twilight \u2013 Movie Review; Old Glory (1998)|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|author2=ew.com |date=March 13, 1998|publisher=Entertainment Weekly |pages=D|access-date=2009-01-23}}</ref>\n\nBarbara Shulgasser of the ''San Francisco Examiner'' said that it had a \"dazzlingly smart script by Benton and co-writer Richard Russo.\" She wrote further: \"''Twilight'' is as close to a perfect film as I've seen in a long while.\"<ref name=\"shoestring\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shoestring.org/mmi_revs/twilight98.html|title=Newman shines in \"Twilight\"|last=Shulgasser|first=Barbara|date=March 6, 1998|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|pages=D|access-date=2009-01-23}}</ref>\n\nHeather Clisby of ''Movie Magazine International'' described it as \"one of those films where everybody involved seems to have actually cared, thus we have a superb product with memorable characters brought to life by some of the finest actors of our time.\"<ref name=\"mmi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shoestring.org/mmi_revs/twilight98.html|title=MMI Movie Review: Twilight|last=Clisby|first=Heather|date=March 4, 1998|publisher=shoestring.org|access-date=2009-01-23}}</ref>\n\n== Home media ==\nThe DVD was released on October 7, 1998, in Widescreen.
