McGovern adapted Joseph Mckeown's novel ''Back Crack Boy'' for this emotionally raw meditation on innocence and pain. Frears in turn was influenced by [[James Joyce]]'s accounts of his stern childhood in late 19th century Catholic [[Dublin]].\n\n[[Megan Burns]] won the [[Marcello Mastroianni Award]] at the [[57th Venice International Film Festival]] for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}\nA family falls into poverty during the Depression.\n\nSet in [[Liverpool]] in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the story is told through the eyes of a boy, Liam Sullivan. Liam is taking instruction in preparation for his [[First Communion]]. His mother is a staunch [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. His father loses his job when his shipyard closes. Meanwhile, his sister, Teresa, has become a maid for the Jewish family who own the shipyard.\n\nLiam stutters badly under stress, and his strict religious education does not help. Teresa's mistress is having an affair, and the girl becomes an accomplice. Liam's father joins a group of [[Fascism|fascists]], who rail against rich Jews and cheap Irish labour. His brother secretly attends meetings with [[Socialism|socialists]]. All of this is a microcosm of a more general breakdown of society.\n\nLife becomes increasingly insecure and people retreat into their own belief systems. This leads to increasing conflict, leading inexorably to a single violent act {{clarify|date=July 2016}}.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ian Hart]] as Dad\n* Claire Hackett as Mum\n* Anthony Borrows as Liam\n* [[Megan Burns]] as Theresa\n\n==Reception==\nThe film grossed $91,000 in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=7|date=24 December 2001|title=Homegrown pix gain in Europe|last=Dawtrey|first=Adam}}</ref> It grossed $1 million in the United States and Canada and $1.9 million worldwide.<ref name=mojo/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0255321}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|liam}}\n* [[Salon.com]] Review: [http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/09/26/liam/ Charles Taylor]. \n* [[The Guardian]] Review: [http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,441474,00.html Peter Bradshaw]. \n* [[The Chicago Sun-Times]] Review: [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20011005/REVIEWS/110050302/1023 Roger Ebert].\n\n{{Stephen Frears}}\n{{Jimmy McGovern}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:2000 drama films]]\n[[Category:Adultery in films]]\n[[Category:British drama films]]\n[[Category:French drama films]]\n[[Category:German drama films]]\n[[Category:Italian drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language French films]]\n[[Category:English-language German films]]\n[[Category:English-language Italian films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Murphy (composer)]]\n[[Category:Films about fascists]]\n[[Category:Films based on multiple works]]\n[[Category:Films based on British novels]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stephen Frears]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1930s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Great Depression films]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Greater Manchester]]\n[[Category:American drama films]]\n[[Category:American films based on plays]]\n[[Category:French films based on plays]]\n[[Category:German films based on plays]]\n[[Category:French films based on novels]]\n[[Category:2000s American films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]\n[[Category:2000s French films]]\n[[Category:2000s German films]]"}]}}}}
