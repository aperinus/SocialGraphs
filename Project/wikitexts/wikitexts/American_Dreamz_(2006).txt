It satirizes both [[popular entertainment]] and [[United States|American]] [[politics]] during the second [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], called a \"cultural satire\" by Weitz.  Reviews were mixed and the film grossed just $16 million on a budget of $17 million.\n\n==Plot==\nOn the morning after his re-election, [[US President]] Joseph Staton ([[Dennis Quaid]]) decides to read the [[newspaper]] for the first time in four years. This starts him down a slippery slope. He begins reading obsessively, reexamining his \"black-and-white\" view of the world in a more \"gray-seeming\" way, and holing up in his bedroom in his [[pajamas]]. Frightened by the President's apparent [[nervous breakdown]], his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] ([[Willem Dafoe]]) pushes him back into the spotlight, booking him as a guest judge on the television ratings juggernaut (and the President's wife's personal favorite) [[talent show]] ''American Dreamz''. America cannot seem to get enough of ''American Dreamz'', hosted by self-aggrandizing, self-loathing Martin Tweed ([[Hugh Grant]]), ever on the lookout for the next insta-[[celebrity]]. His latest crop of hopefuls includes Sally Kendoo ([[Mandy Moore]]), a conniving steel magnolia with a devoted, dopey veteran boyfriend William Williams ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]), and Omer Obeidi ([[Sam Golzari]]).\n\nBecause Omer's mother died in the Middle East in an American attack, he joined a group of [[jihadist]]s. He was an actor in an instruction film for terrorists, but he was too clumsy, and his interest in show tunes was frowned upon. Therefore, he was sent to the U.S. to await further instructions, but the leaders expected they could not use him. He moved to [[Southern California]] to live with his extended family there, including his [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] cousin Iqbal ([[Tony Yalda]]) and Shazzy ([[Noureen DeWulf]]). Iqbal hoped to be selected to participate in ''American Dreamz'', but in a misunderstanding, Omer was selected instead. Iqbal becomes angered by this at first but later agrees to help Omer win and makes himself his manager.\n\nOmer's terrorist organization now sees an opportunity: Omer is instructed to make it to the finale, and kill the [[President of the United States|President]] in a [[suicide attack]]. He succeeds in getting to the finale. Security is bypassed by assembling the bomb after the security check, in the toilet, from small parts smuggled in (the smaller pieces of explosive are disguised as chewing gum). Omer agrees, but changes his mind and disposes of the bomb in the trash can.\n\nSally is the other finalist. Earlier in the film, she had dumped William because she believed that her life would've gone nowhere if she still had him for a boyfriend and that he'd only drag her down. This drove William to join the army, only to be wounded in Iraq and sent back to the U.S. For the purpose of the show and at the insistence of her agent, Chet Krogl ([[Seth Meyers]]), Sally has to pretend that she still loves William. On the eve of the ''American Dreamz'' finale, William proposes to Sally, which she rejects until Chet decides to boost Sally's popularity and chances of winning the show by asking William to do the proposal on air. However, William witnesses Sally having sex with Martin, and is furious. When he throws out the engagement ring, he finds the bomb Omer tossed in the trash can. He then comes out on stage and threatens to detonate it. While the other people evacuate, William starts singing and Martin, who refuses to let go of the camera, films it. As William reaches the end of the song, he detonates the bomb by walking into the camera, killing both himself and Martin. The film then cuts to shots of people dialing up their cell phones to vote in for the winner. It is eventually revealed that William Williams was voted the surprise winner of ''American Dreamz''.\n\nThe epilogue reveals what each of the characters went on to do after the end of last season. Omer went on to become a successful star of his own Broadway revue, where he is shown performing a scene from the musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', the President makes his wife his new chief of staff and Sally Kendoo becomes the new host of ''American Dreamz''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Martin \"Tweedy\" Tweed\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as President Joseph Staton\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as First Lady\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]]\n* [[Mandy Moore]] as Sally Kendoo\n* [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]] as William Williams\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Martha Kendoo\n* [[Sam Golzari]] as Omer Obeidi\n* [[Seth Meyers]] as Chet Krogl\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Deborah Accordo\n* [[John Cho]] as Frank Ittles\n* [[Tony Yalda]] as Iqbal Riza\n* [[Noureen DeWulf]] as Shabnam \"Shazzy\" Riza\n* [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]] as Nazneen Riza\n* [[Adam Busch]] as Sholem Glickstein\n* [[Jeff Ross]] as American Dreamz finale pre-show announcer (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\nAlthough the singing contest depicted in the film has been interpreted as a direct satire of ''[[American Idol]]'', Paul Weitz said in an interview that the similarities are almost accidental, and that the showrunner is not based on [[Simon Cowell]] but on Hugh Grant himself: \"a depressive, morbid but really funny, cynical guy ... too egotistical to have any other judges so it's just him kind of projected up on screen judging the contestants\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Rebecca|title=Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore and Writer/Director Paul Weitz Talk American Dreamz|url=http://movies.about.com/od/americandreamz/a/dreamzmm041206.htm|website=About Entertainment|access-date=28 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429000851/http://movies.about.com/od/americandreamz/a/dreamzmm041206.htm|archive-date=2017-04-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> Weitz went on to call the film a cultural rather than a political satire.\n\n== Reception ==\n===Box office===\n''American Dreamz'' grossed $7.2&nbsp;million in the United States, and $9.5&nbsp;million in other territories, for a worldwide total gross of $16.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=BOM>{{cite web|title= ''American Dreamz'' (2006)|url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0465142/?ref_=bo_se_r_4 |work= BoxOfficeMojo}}</ref>\n\nThe film opened on April 21, 2006 and made $3.7&nbsp;million in its first weekend, placing ninth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weekend Box Office Results for April 21\u201323, 2006 |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2006&wknd=16&p=.htm |work= BoxOfficeMojo}}</ref><ref>Solid ''Silent Hill,'' So-So ''Sentinel,'' Shattered ''American Dreamz''.\"[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2052&p=.htm] BoxOfficeMojo.com</ref>\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the film debuted at #7, dropping to #10 in its second week.
