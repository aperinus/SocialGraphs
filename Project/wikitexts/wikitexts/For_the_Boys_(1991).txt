It was directed by [[Mark Rydell]] and the original music score was composed by [[Dave Grusin]]. It stars [[Bette Midler]], [[James Caan]], [[George Segal]], [[Patrick O'Neal (actor)|Patrick O'Neal]], [[Arye Gross]], and [[Norman Fell]]. A then-unknown [[Vince Vaughn]] made his film debut as a cheering soldier in a crowd.\n\nAs in ''[[The Rose (film)|The Rose]]'', Midler's first starring role and also a large budget quasi-biopic, the film is fiction. However, actress and singer [[Martha Raye]] believed that Midler's character was based on many widely known facts about her life and career with the USO and pursued legal action based on that assumption. After a protracted legal engagement, Raye ultimately lost the case. The Caan character was generally believed to be based on [[Bob Hope]].\n\nFor her performance, Midler won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. [[For the Boys (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] features covers of many classic songs, including \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\", \"[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]\" by [[Frank Loesser]], \"[[P.S. I Love You (1934 song)|P.S. I Love You]]\", \"[[I Remember You (1941 song)|I Remember You]]\" and [[the Beatles]]' \"[[In My Life]]\". Five of the 13 songs have lyrics by [[Johnny Mercer]]. The soundtrack's first single, \"Every Road Leads Back to You,\" was an original written by [[Diane Warren]].\n\nDespite a mixed critical reception and [[box office bomb|box office failure]], the film was adapted for the [[musical theatre|musical stage]] in 2011 by Aaron Thielen and Terry James and debuted at the [[Marriott Theatre]] in [[Lincolnshire, Illinois]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/stage-musical-for-the-boys-with-michele-ragusa-and-timothy-gulan-opens-at-marriott-theatre-com-182061|title=Stage Musical For the Boys, With Michele Ragusa and Timothy Gulan, Opens at Marriott Theatre|last=Hetrick|first=Adam|date=August 26, 2011|website=Playbill|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201014012/http://www.playbill.com/article/stage-musical-for-the-boys-with-michele-ragusa-and-timothy-gulan-opens-at-marriott-theatre-com-182061|archive-date=December 1, 2018|access-date=2018-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marriotttheatre.com/show.aspx?show=45 |title=For the Boys |publisher=Marriott Theatre |access-date=October 13, 2011 |archive-date=November 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116002648/http://www.marriotttheatre.com/show.aspx?show=45 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1990s, retired entertainer Dixie Leonard has a commitment to attend a Hollywood ceremony being televised live to honor her and her longtime show-biz partner Eddie Sparks. When a young man from the TV show comes to pick her up, Dixie balks and explains what brought Eddie and her together, as well as what drove them apart. The majority of the film is an extended [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nDixie's story begins during [[World War II]] when she receives an offer to entertain the troops overseas as part of Eddie's act. Dixie is an instant hit with the boys in uniform, but Eddie wants her gone, ostensibly because he finds her kind of humor too coarse, but in actuality because she stole the show by topping his jokes. Dixie doesn't care for him much, either, but fellow entertainers and her joke-writer uncle Art persuade her to stay.\n\nEddie wins her over, particularly by reuniting Dixie with her soldier husband on stage. However, later in the war, Dixie's husband dies in battle.\n\nDespite her distaste for Eddie, Dixie continues working with him back in the States...mostly to support herself and her son Danny. Eddie is married with daughters, yet he becomes a proud surrogate father to Danny.\n\nAs the [[Korean War]] breaks out, Eddie announces on stage that he and Dixie will be performing for the U.S. troops there, without having told Dixie of his plans first. In revenge, Dixie announces that Eddie made a $100,000 donation (${{Inflation|US|100000|1951|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to the Red Cross. Reluctantly, she travels to Korea with him. On their way to the camp, they encounter a unit of soldiers that has been ambushed. Dixie cares for a wounded soldier but cannot save him: he is pronounced dead on arrival at the field hospital. Dixie and Eddie appear to spend the night together. At the Christmas dinner, a fight ensues after Art announces to everybody that Eddie has fired him for being a communist sympathizer.\n\nIn the meantime, Danny has grown up to be a soldier like his father, and is deployed to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. At Art's suggestion, Dixie eventually agrees to perform there for Christmas with Eddie. On their way to the camp, the performers are warned of the camp possibly being attacked, because of which they are to be flown out immediately after their performance. Before going on stage, Dixie and Eddie meet Danny, who reveals to them the barbarity that is spreading among his comrades. The show begins with the performance of a dancer, who starts getting harassed by the soldiers, and only Eddie's intervention prevents the situation from getting out of control. Dixie comes on stage and makes some cynical remarks about the soldiers, then sings \u201c[[In My Life]]\u201d. While she is still on stage, the camp is attacked in a mortar barrage. Dixie and Eddie find shelter, but Danny is killed right in front of them; both mourn deeply for him.\n\nDixie has not forgiven Eddie for his part in all this, and they have another heated argument in the dressing room. Eddie goes out on stage alone. But, at the last minute, because he speaks of their joint loss in Vietnam, Dixie joins him on stage for one last song and dance, before appearing to accept their mutual love for one another.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Bette Midler]] as Dixie Leonard\n*[[James Caan]] as Eddie Sparks\n*[[George Segal]] as Art Silver\n*[[Patrick O'Neal (actor)|Patrick O'Neal]] as Shephard\n*[[Christopher Rydell]] as Danny Leonard\n*[[Brandon Call]] as teenage Danny Leonard\n* [[Jameson Rodgers]] as young Danny Leonard\n*[[Arye Gross]] as Jeff Brooks, the young man who comes to escort Dixie\n*[[Norman Fell]] as Sam Schiff\n*[[Rosemary Murphy]] as Luanna Trott, a journalist\n*[[Bud Yorkin]] as Phil\n*[[Dori Brenner]] as Loretta, Dixie's friend on the road\n*[[Jack Sheldon]] as Wally Fields\n*Karen Martin as Victoria Lee, the dancer\n*Shannon Wilcox as Margaret Sparks, Eddie's wife\n*[[Michael Greene]] as Maj.
