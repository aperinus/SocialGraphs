After reading the letter, Danny decides to change his way of life. He travels to New Jersey to attempt to connect for the first time with his grown son, Tom Donnelly, born from a casual relationship with a woman who died 10 years earlier. Tom has a wife, Samantha, and seven-year-old daughter, Hope, and is expecting a second child.\n\nSeeking a new start, Danny forswears touring and checks into a Hilton hotel in New Jersey, much to the delight of the young staff. He begins to woo the hotel manager, Mary, and tries to set up her assistant Jaime on a date.\n\nTom initially rejects the father he believes abandoned him, but Danny persists, getting Hope, who has [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], into an exclusive school for children with [[special needs]]. He learns Tom has what doctors say may be terminal [[leukemia]], inherited from his mother, and begins to attend doctor's visits with him. Tom's dislike of his father gradually gives way to the need for his support.\n\nInspired by his feelings for Mary and his happiness at having a family, Danny begins to write new songs. He books a one-night performance at a small club. However, when the audience demands he play his old material, Danny loses his nerve and gives a rote performance. Ashamed, he resumes doing drugs, damaging his relationship with Mary and his family. Tom confronts him, causing Danny to angrily reveal Tom's leukemia diagnosis, something Samantha had not been aware of. Feeling betrayed, Tom tells Danny never to bother his family again.\n\nDanny finds out from Frank that his finances are in danger, on account of all his excessive habits, and that he needs to go on tour again. Danny goes to the hotel to mend fences with Mary. Tom is visited by Frank, who tells him that his father, despite many flaws, is a good man. Tom then finds Danny waiting at the doctor's office to hear his diagnosis. Danny reassures him that everything will be all right, which, after the doctor arrives, appears to be the case.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Danny Collins\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Mary Sinclair\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Samantha Leigh Donnelly\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Tom Donnelly\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Frank Grubman\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Guy DeLoach\n* [[Cesar Evora]] as Gabriel \n* [[Josh Peck]] as Nicky Ernst\n* [[Scott Lawrence]] as Dr. Kurtz\n* [[Fernando Colunga]] as Fernando\n* [[Michelle Vieth]] as Selena\n* [[Katarina \u010cas]] as Sophie\n* [[Brian Thomas Smith]] Judd (Busy Work)\n* [[Melissa Benoist]] as Jamie\n* Giselle Eisenberg as Hope Donnelly\n* Eric Michael Roy as Young Danny Collins\n\n==Background==\nThe story is based on a real-life situation in which [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] wrote a letter to the English folk singer [[Steve Tilston]] in 1971 but this remained unknown to him for 34 years.
