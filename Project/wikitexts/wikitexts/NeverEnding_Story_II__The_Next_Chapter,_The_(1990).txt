It was directed by [[George T. Miller]] and stars [[Jonathan Brandis]] as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Bastian Balthazar Bux|Bastian Bux]], [[Kenny Morrison]] as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Atreyu|Atreyu]], and [[Alexandra Johnes]] as the [[List of The Neverending Story characters#The Childlike Empress|Childlike Empress]]. The only actor to return from the first film was [[Thomas Hill (actor)|Thomas Hill]] as [[Carl Conrad Coreander]]. The film used plot elements from [[Michael Ende]]'s novel ''[[The Neverending Story]]'' (primarily the second half) but introduced a new storyline. Upon its American theatrical release in 1991, the [[Bugs Bunny]] animated short ''[[Box-Office Bunny]]'' was shown before the film. This short was also included on the [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] release later that year.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Bastian Balthazar Bux]] seeks to join his school's swimming team, but his ability to jump off a diving board is marred by his [[acrophobia]] (fear of heights). He revisits [[Carl Conrad Coreander]]'s antiquarian bookstore to seek advice on courage, where he rediscovers the Neverending Story and hears the [[Childlike Empress]] call out to him for aid.\n\nBastian takes the book home while the [[AURYN|Auryn]] amulet magically comes off the book cover which Bastian takes and is summoned to Fantasia, where he meets a bird-like creature named Nimbly and is reunited with [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Atreyu|Atreyu]]. After the group encounters and escapes from armored [[giant]]s, Bastian comes to understand that a force called \"Emptiness\" is spreading across Fantasia. This force has been brought about by the evil [[Magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Xayide|Xayide]], who seeks to seize power over Fantasia. To hinder Bastian's quest, Xayide's inventor Tri-Face develops an apparatus that strips Bastian of a memory each time he uses the Auryn amulet to make a wish. Nimbly was sent as a spy to persuade Bastian to make wishes until he is unable to remember why he came to Fantasia.\n\nBastian and Atreyu seek out and capture Xayide. She seems to abandon her quest for power and agrees to lead the two to the Childlike Empress. During the travel to the Empress's castle, Xayide tricks Bastian into believing that his friends will turn against him and manages to get him to wish for a series of ridiculous wishes. It also becomes obvious to Atreyu that they are being led aimlessly.\n\nMeanwhile, Bastian's father Barney has noticed his son's disappearance. He finds the Neverending Story in Bastian's room and sees a sticker on the front cover listing the bookstore's address. Barney rushes to confront Mr. Coreander, who simply tells him that he will find the answers to his son's whereabouts inside the book. Returning later with a police officer, Barney is shocked to see the bookstore abandoned. Eventually, Barney reads the book and is surprised to see his son's exploits in Fantasia being written by the book itself and that he is mentioned within.\n\nAtreyu determines what Xayide is planning, while Bastian is fully persuaded that Atreyu has turned on him. In a struggle between the two, Atreyu is knocked over a cliff and falls to his death. Returning to Xayide, Bastian discovers the apparatus for himself and learns that he only has two memories left, consisting of his mother and father.\n\nBastian uses his penultimate memory of his mother to wish Atreyu back to life. Xayide tries to force Bastian to use his last wish to return home. Bastian agrees to make his last wish, but instead wishes for the sorceress \"to have a heart\". This fills Xayide with emotion, negating the Emptiness within her and which she controls. Overcome with compassion, Xayide explodes in a blast of light, and Fantasia is restored, along with Bastian's memories.\n\nHaving been freed, the Childlike Empress thanks Bastian for his help and Bastian gives her the Auryn amulet. She shows him the way home: a cliff overlooking a waterfall, to help Bastian overcome his fear of heights.\n\nEncouraged by Barney and Atreyu, Bastian jumps off and returns home safely while the Auryn amulet magically goes back onto the book cover.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of The Neverending Story characters}}\n* [[Jonathan Brandis]] as [[Bastian Balthazar Bux]]\n** J. Michael Haney as Young Bastian Bux\n* [[Kenny Morrison]] as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Atreyu|Atreyu]]\n* [[Clarissa Burt]] as [[Xayide]]\n* [[John Wesley Shipp]] as Barney Bux (Bastian's father)\n* [[Alexandra Johnes]] as [[Childlike Empress]]\n* [[Thomas Hill (actor)|Thomas Hill]] as [[Carl Conrad Coreander]]\n* [[Donald Arthur]] (''voice'') as [[Falkor]]\n* Martin Umbach as Nimbly\n* Christopher Burton as Tri-Face\n* [[Noah Hathaway]] (''uncredited [[Archive footage|archival footage]]'') as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Atreyu|Atreyu]]\n* Dan Fincher (''uncredited voice'') as [[List of The Neverending Story characters#Pyornkrachzark|Rockbiter]]\n* Helena Michell as Mrs. Bux (Bastian's mother, who appears in a flashback)\n\n==Production==\nProducer Dieter Geissler declared he always intended to make a trilogy out of [[Michael Ende]]'s ''[[The Neverending Story]]'', finding the book \"just too rich to leave at one film\". However, his plans to follow the original film, which only covers half of the novel, had to be postponed as Ende sued Geissler and the production company, insisting that he have a say in any future film treatments of his work. As soon as the legal problems were solved, Geissler started a year-long pre-production working with conceptual artist Ludwig Angerer, to ensure the film's design and technical ambitions would fit into a lower budget, along with averting the problems the first film faced with its effects. Geissler also hired screenwriter Karin Howard, who contributed 14 drafts until the final screenplay, which draws inspiration from most chapters in the second half of Ende's novel. Geissler opted to invite a director only when the development was finished, as he considered effects-heavy productions \"burn a director out real fast when they're in on a picture from the earliest pre-production stages. What I wanted was for the director to come in fresh and not already worn out and to be able to put his ideas on an already solid structure\". He eventually brought in the Australian [[George T. Miller]], who was a fan of the original film. Over 600 children were auditioned, given the original actors were now too old for their roles. In contrast to ''The NeverEnding Story'' relying on blue screen and scale model creatures, ''The Next Chapter'' would have more life-sized model work and matte paintings. Principal photography began in early 1990 at [[Bavaria Film]] near [[Munich]]. The original plan was to build three separate stages, having first and second unit shooting simultaneously on the first two-stage and have the effects done on the third. But the studio decided not to build the third stage at the last minute, forcing production to shoot first and second unit on the same stage at the same time; the stage being Stage 7 at Bavaria Studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moon-city-garbage.agency/blog/july/index.htm|title = Blog July}}</ref> As labour rules regarding child actors limited their working schedules, Miller decided to only rehearse scenes once before filming, and maximized the time with the children on set by shooting with as many as three cameras on every scene. This created a problem as Miller's fear of falling late wound up making the film so ahead of schedule the effects team had not completed the necessary work for later scenes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Shapiro, Marc|date=April 1991|title=NeverEnding Stories|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-165/page/n27/mode/2up|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=165|pages=29\u201332}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Neverending Story II - The Next Chapter: Original Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Giorgio Moroder]] & [[Robert Folk]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1990\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film Score|Score]], [[Pop music|Pop]]\n| length     = 45:53\n| label      = WEA\n| producer   =\n| chronology = ''The Neverending Story'' soundtrack\n| prev_title = [[The NeverEnding Story (film)#Music|The NeverEnding Story: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]\n| prev_year  = 1984\n| next_title = [[The NeverEnding Story III#Soundtrack|Music From & Inspired By The Neverending Story III: Here Come The Fantasians]]\n| next_year  = 1994}}\n{{Track listing\n| total_length = 45:53\n| extra_column = Performer(s)\n| extra1 = [[Robert Folk]]\n| title1 = Searching For Fantasia\n| writer1 = [[Robert Folk]]\n| length1 = 2:19\n| extra2 = Joe Milner\n| title2 = Dreams We Dream\n| writer2 = [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Tom Whitlock]]\n| length2 = 4:23\n| extra3 = Joe Milner\n| title3 = Heaven's Just A Heartbeat\n| length3 = 4:10\n| writer3 = Moroder, Whitlock\n| extra4 = Joe Milner\n| title4 = The Neverending Story\n| writer4 = Moroder, [[Keith Forsey]]\n| length4 = 3:29\n| extra5 = [[Giorgio Moroder]]\n| title5 = Dreams We Dream (Instrumental)\n| writer5 = Moroder, Whitlock\n| length5 = 4:27\n| extra6 = Robert Folk\n| title6 = Bastian's Dream\n| length6 = 2:05\n| writer6 = Folk\n| extra7 = Robert Folk\n| title7 = Falkor's Quest\n| length7 = 2:33\n| writer7 = Folk\n| extra8 = Robert Folk\n| title8 = Flight Of The Dragon\n| length8 = 3:32\n| writer8 = Folk\n| extra9 = Robert Folk\n| title9 = Silver Mountains\n| length9 = 1:29\n| writer9 = Folk\n| extra10 = Robert Folk\n| title10 = Morning In Fantasia\n| length10 = 1:08\n| writer10 = Folk\n| extra11 = Robert Folk\n| title11 = The Childlike Empress\n| length11 = 2:15\n| writer11 = Folk\n| extra12 = Robert Folk\n| title12 = The Giants' Attack\n| length12 = 2:11\n| writer12 = Folk\n| extra13 = Robert Folk\n| title13 = Silver Lake\n| length13 = 2:54\n| writer13 = Folk\n| extra14 = Robert Folk\n| title14 = Xayide's Castle\n| length14 = 1:26\n| writer14 = Folk\n| extra15 = Robert Folk\n| title15 = Atreyu's Return To The Great Plains\n| length15 = 3:10\n| writer15 = Folk\n| extra16 = Robert Folk\n| title16 = Bastian's Lost Memories\n| length16 = 1:03\n| writer16 = Folk\n| extra17 = Robert Folk\n| title17 = Silver City\n| length17 = 2:05\n| writer17 = Folk\n| extra18 = Giorgio Moroder\n| title18 = The Neverending Story (Reprise)\n| length18 = 0:54\n| writer18 = Moroder, Forsey\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film has a 14% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 7 reviews; the average critics' rating is 3.7/10.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_neverending_story_ii_the_next_chapter_1990 | title=The Neverending Story II: The Next Chapter (1991) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | access-date=April 23, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100 based on 13 critic reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-neverending-story-ii-the-next-chapter |title=The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[Red Ventures]] |access-date=14 June 2022}}</ref> Richard Harrington of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: \"Unlike its predecessor, there are few effects in ''II'' worthy of being called special, and events unfold with uniform flatness.
