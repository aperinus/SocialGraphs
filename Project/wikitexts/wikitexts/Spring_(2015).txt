The next day, following his mother's funeral, he gets into a physical altercation with another man while drinking at the restaurant he works at, resulting in the loss of his job. His friend advises him to travel to get his mind clear. Evan travels to [[Italy]] and meets a flirtatious girl named Louise. He is initially suspicious of her but becomes more interested. To pursue his relationship with Louise he takes a job at a local farm and starts living in a small town in southern Italy.\n\nLouise, who initially rejected Evan, finally has sex with him without using a [[condom]]. The next morning she wakes up before he does and has a monstrous appearance and leaves, killing a cat. When Evan is wandering the town later, he catches sight of Louise and talks to her again. They later explore the town together. After a few dates, Louise asks Evan about his family story. Although he is reluctant to reveal details, he relents and then asks Louise to tell him something about her. Louise takes out the contact lens from her right eye to show Evan that she has [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]. Evan sees the same condition reflected in the women on many of the paintings in the museum and also on the cover of a book. One night, Louise is having dinner with Evan when her skin condition starts getting worse. She runs off the street and is followed by a tourist who mistakes her for a prostitute. Louise unwillingly kills him after she mutates into a reptilian creature.\n\nEvan, who has been working illegally on the farm, has to leave when immigration police make a visit there. As he has nowhere to go, he goes to Louise's house. The door is chain-locked, through which he sees blood on the floor and hears a strange voice. He breaks the chain to open the door and finds an [[octopus]]-like creature on the floor wearing Louise's dress, trying to reach a syringe. He quickly picks up the syringe and injects it into the creature's neck.\n\nLouise reveals to Evan that she's a 2,000-year-old mutant. She is the woman in all of the paintings of women with dual eye color, including the one on the cover of the book. Every 20 years in spring she gets herself pregnant, and then her body uses cells in the embryo she carries to recreate her while she changes into different creatures during the process. Evan is shocked and leaves. Louise follows him and keeps telling him more about the condition. She reveals that she did not use a condom during intercourse with Evan in order to purposely get pregnant. She also reveals that if she falls in love with someone, her body will produce [[oxytocin]], a hormone which will keep embryo cells from consumption, resulting in the loss of her [[immortality]]. Evan asks if she is in love with him, to which she replies she is not and also that she would not give up her immortality for anyone.\n\nEvan then asks her to spend her last 24 hours with him before she re-evolves. They spend all night talking to each other. In the early morning Louise takes Evan to the ruins of [[Pompeii]], where she was born, and tells him her family history. The time comes and Evan makes one last attempt begging her not to change, to which Louise replies that she does not control it, her body does, and it has started to change, meaning she may attack Evan. He refuses to go, so Louise lies down with her head on his lap and she begins to change, while listening to Evan talk about the experience of being mortal and all the positive aspects to it. The sun rises before a calm and resigned Evan looks down at Louise when a grotesque sound is heard. However, he finds Louise still in her current human form while the volcano that resulted in the death of Louise\u2019s family is seen to begin erupting in the background.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Lou Taylor Pucci]] as Evan Russell\n*[[Nadia Hilker]] as Louise\n*[[Francesco Carnelutti (actor)|Francesco Carnelutti]] as Angelo\n*[[Nick Nevern]] as Thomas\n*[[Cage (rapper)|Chris Palko]] as Bancroft Dawson\n*Jonathan Silvestri as Sam\n*Jeremy Gardner as Tommy\n*Vinny Curran as Mike\n*Holly Hawkins as Nicole Russell, Evan's Mom\n*[[Augie Duke]] as Jackie\n*Vanessa Bednar as Gail\n*Shane Brady as Brad\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by [[Jimmy Lavalle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|date=March 20, 2015|title=Directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorehead Talk The Music Of 'Spring' (Interview)|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3337010/director-justin-benson-talks-the-music-of-spring-interview/|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]}}</ref> The soundtrack was released on March 25, 2015 by Lavalle's own label, Eastern Glow Recordings.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|date=March 19, 2015|title='Spring' OST Available Early Next Week: Tracks Included In BitTorrent Bundle|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3336700/spring-ost-available-early-next-week-tracks-included-in-bittorrent-bundle/|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Spring'' premiered on September 5, 2014 as part of the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.tiff.net/festivals/thefestival/programmes/vanguard/spring-1 TIFF.net | Spring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214051844/http://www.tiff.net/festivals/thefestival/programmes/vanguard/spring-1 |date=February 14, 2015 }}</ref> The film received a [[limited release|limited theatrical release]] on March 20, 2015 through [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema#Drafthouse Films|Drafthouse Films]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dreadcentral.com/news/89789/spring-trailer-grows/|title=Spring Trailer Grows Up|first=Steve|last=Barton|date=February 13, 2015|work=[[Dread Central]]}}</ref> and a [[video on demand]] release a day later through FilmBuff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/videos/3332482/horror-will-spring-life-lovecraftian-horror-trailer/|title=Horror Will 'Spring' to Life In this Lovecraftian Love Story|first=Brad|last=Miska|date=February 13, 2015|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.
