The short, which shows a senior named Geri who competes with himself in a game of [[chess]], was Pixar's first film to feature a [[human being]] as its main character; Geri later made a cameo appearance in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' as \"The Cleaner\", here voiced by [[Jonathan Harris]] instead of [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]].\n\n''Geri's Game'' was released eight years after ''[[Knick Knack]]'', the last short by Pixar to that point, made as part of an effort to reignite the [[List of Pixar shorts|studio's short film series]], which had been put on standby in order to focus on the creation of television commercials as well as the studio's first feature film, which would become the first-ever [[Feature film|full-length]] computer-animated film, ''[[Toy Story]]''. A dedicated [[research and development]] team worked alongside the filmmakers to devise ways to get around the burdens of animating a human character, leading to an in-house [[computer simulation]] to mimic the natural [[Cloth simulation|movement of clothing]] on a character. [[Subdivision surface]] [[3D modeling|modeling]], a technique partly pioneered by [[Edwin Catmull]] in 1978 but mostly ignored in favor of [[Non-uniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] surfaces, was used to bestow natural movement and realistic skin [[Texture (computer graphics)|textures]] on the human character himself.\n\n''Geri's Game'' premiered on November 24, 1997, winning an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] the following year. It was later shown with the theatrical release of Pixar's second feature film, ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', the following year, and therefore became part of a Pixar tradition of pairing shorts with feature films.\n\n==Plot==\nIn an empty [[park]] in a large city, the title character, Geri, blows the leaves off a table and sets up a chessboard. He proceeds to play a [[chess]] game against himself, playing the parts of both participants by moving to opposite sides of the board and either removing or replacing his glasses. The \"player\" without the glasses and playing as black, is aggressive and confident, while the \"player\" with the glasses who plays white is timid and makes several mistakes. The confident player soon captures all the timid player's pieces except the King - the timid player fakes a heart attack and falls to the ground, startling the other, who quickly starts to take his own pulse. The timid player surreptitiously turns the board around, so the confident player has only the King left, and he has nearly all his pieces. He then gets up and tells the confident player he is all right and takes his turn. The confident player, confused and upset, knocks down his [[chess|king]] and [[resign (chess)|concedes defeat]] and gives the timid player the prize - his false teeth. The camera pans back to remind the audience only one person was playing the game the entire time.\n\n==Development==\n''Geri's Game'' was Pixar's first original short film since 1989, when ''[[Knick Knack]]'' was released. It was directed and written by [[Jan Pinkava]], who joined the studio in 1993 to work on their [[TV commercials]] while the other directors and writers were preoccupied with the production of ''[[Toy Story]]'', and had been continuously approaching executive producer [[Darla K. Anderson]] with the proposal that the studio make a new short film.<ref name=\"20 years\">{{cite web|title='Geri's Game' Turns 20: Director Jan Pinkava Reflects On The Game-Changing Pixar Short|date=25 November 2017|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cgi/geris-game-turns-20-director-jan-pinkava-reflects-game-changing-pixar-short-154646.html|publisher=Cartoor Brew|access-date=November 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Initial conception ===\nWork on the short began shortly after the release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' and during early production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', when [[Ed Catmull]] decided that the studio should resurrect its short films production as a way to not only bring new animators and storytellers into Pixar, but also as a way to further push [[research and development]] for the studio.<ref name=\"New Face\">{{cite magazine|last=Robertson |first=Barbara |title=Meet Geri: The New Face of Animation |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/glmiller/public/computational-geometry/15-852-F08/RelatedWork/meet-geri.pdf |magazine=Computer Graphics World |date=February 1998 |access-date=May 7, 2018}}</ref> For the first of these shorts, which would be the first one made in 8 years, Catmull wanted Pixar to create a story which featured a human as its central protagonist. Upon Anderson's suggestion, he reached out to Pinkava to direct the short.<ref name=\"20 years\" /> According to Pinkava himself, Catmull said he could direct the short as long as it starred a human character and had a serviceable story behind it.<ref name=\"20 years\" />\n\nWhen trying to brainstorm a concept, Pinkava asked himself if he would be able to come up with a story that featured only one character, which would both give it an artistic edge and make development easier on the technical side of things, as coming up with just a single stylized, but credible, human character was hard enough.<ref name=\"New Face\" /><ref name=\"20 years\" /> He designed an elderly character {{En dash}} belonging to the polar opposite age sector of Billy,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tin Toy 1988 Film Short Pixar|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7x4qUKWCf0|url-status=live|access-date=February 25, 2021|website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead Youtube links|date=February 2022}}</ref> the infant character in ''[[Tin Toy]]'', and one of Pixar's earliest attempts at creating a human character. He felt it would be interesting to animate a character with the body language of an old man, similar to how Billy was animated with the gesticulations of a baby.\n\n=== Story evolution ===\nAfter spending time [[storyboarding]] and [[brainstorming]] ideas, Pinkava came up with 3 different concepts starring an elderly male character; one of these concepts was about him playfully riding up and down an [[elevator]], while another one involved him playing a game of [[chess]] against himself. The latter idea was inspired by Pinkava and his elderly relatives' love of chess\u2014particularly his grandfather, an avid chess player who would often play rounds of the game with only himself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Jan|url=http://www.pixar.com/artistscorner/jan/interview.html|publisher=Pixar|access-date=August 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304214836/http://www.pixar.com/artistscorner/jan/interview.html|archive-date=March 4, 2012|date=February 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"20 years\" />\n\nPinkava [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] an early [[animatic]] version of the chess story, and was turned down and given a second chance to restart and further develop the story.

(Ranft initially was the clay sculptor for the character, working on his head and hands, but after receiving continuous suggestions on how to tweak the model, he reportedly handed the sculpting utensil to Pinkava, simply telling him, \"You do it,\" while smiling.)<ref name=\"20 years\"/>\n\n=== Technology ===\nGeri's voice (vocal intonations) came from Pixar writer [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Geri's Game (1997)|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b811719c9|publisher=British Film Institute|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref> Peterson wanted Pixar to be able to create a short that could technologically push the studio to new heights; specifically, he wanted Pixar to create a short film featuring a character that could display both convincing-looking skin ''and'' realistic cloth animation.<ref name=\"20 years\" /> The first Pixar short film with a human main character, ''Geri's Game'' was produced with the goal of \"[taking] human and [[cloth animation]] to new heights\".<ref>[http://www.pixar.com/shorts/gg/behind.html ''Geri's Game'' - Behind the Scenes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414121059/http://www.pixar.com/shorts/gg/behind.html |date=2012-04-14 }} at Pixar</ref><ref>Robertson, Barbara.

Clark|Jim Clark]], which allowed for more lifelike skin surfaces.<ref name=\"20 years\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Subdivision Surfaces in Character Animation|url=http://graphics.pixar.com/library/Geri/paper.pdf|website=graphics.pixar.com|access-date=14 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, most 3D character surfaces were crafted using several [[non-uniform rational B-spline]]s (NURBS) that had to be \"stitched\" together, which made for less expressive movement and caused models to frequently tear. The use of subdivision surfacing, which renders a character's skin as one large surface, allowed for smoother object movement, as well as more intricate detail. DeRose had been working on the technology at the [[University of Washington]], and had already brought subdivision surfaces to [[CAD]] makers, who were ultimately unconvinced, and held their faith in NURBS, before bringing it to Pixar, which was much more receptive.<ref name=\"New Face\" />\n\nOn the clothing side, after toiling endlessly, Kass managed to create a system which could emulate/simulate the movement of cloth, at which point the team realized that the [[suit jacket]] they had modeled didn't fit with Geri's movement outside of a default [[T-pose]]. According to Pinkava, [[Steve Jobs]], upon a hearing about the issue, had offered to help him by enlisting [[tailor]] [[Giorgio Armani]] to help them design an outfit for Geri, which he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"20 years\" /> The development of a dynamic cloth simulator made several changes to the way that animators work; for instance, the animation, when completed, needed to be sent to the simulator, which would automatically insert Geri's jacket and calculate its movements, rather than being directly sourced to the [[3D rendering|renderer]] after being finished. Geri also needed to be animated 30 [[Film frame|frames]] in advance in order to get the simulation going, and animators couldn't \"cheat\" by having off-camera body parts go unanimated, as it would affect how the simulating program moved the clothing.<ref name=\"New Face\" />\n\nLike other Pixar shorts, ''Geri's Game'' contains no [[spoken dialogue]], and so is driven only by the actions and [[Facial expression|expressions]] of its main character. To further push the ability to convey the film's story, extra detail was put into Geri's facial [[Rigging (computer graphics)|rigging]] compared to previous rigging methods, with rigger Paul Aichele giving the character ''hundreds'' of face controls for animators to use.<ref name=\"20 years\" /> These new, more detailed rigging methods went on to be used in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', which was being worked on at the same time.<ref name=\"20 years\" />\n\n=== Staff ===\nLike previous short films made by Pixar, ''Geri's Game'' was made by a temporary branch of Pixar employees, and was separate from the people working on the studio's feature films. It took roughly a year to produce, according to Pinkava, largely due to the amount of time allotted to developing the [[cloth simulation]].<ref name=\"20 years\" /> While the short was being made, most of Pixar Studios was preoccupied with making ''A Bug's Life''. Despite this, there were 18 different animators<ref name=\"New Face\" /> that worked on the project (including Pixar storywriter [[Pete Docter]], who contributed a few scenes out of sheer interest<ref name=\"20 years\" />). Despite being preoccupied directing ''A Bug's Life'', [[John Lasseter]] suggested adding a scene in which Geri checks to make sure he's alright after seeing his alter ego stage a heart attack and keel over; Lasseter physically staged out the entire scene to Pinkava.<ref name=\"20 years\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Geri's Game'' premiered on November 24, 1997 at [[Laemmle Theatres|Laemmle's]] Monica Theater in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref name=TFLPremiere>{{cite news|title=Question: Where Can You Get a Glimpse of the Future of Animation?; Answer: At an Exclusive Screening - From the Makers of 'Toy Story' - Tonight!|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Question%3A+Where+Can+You+Get+a+Glimpse+of+the+Future+of+Animation%3F%3B...-a020009689|access-date=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Free Library|date=November 24, 1997|author=Pixar Animation Studios}}</ref> It was also attached to the theatrical release of Pixar's second feature film, ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', in 1998,<ref name=\"Bug\">{{cite news| last= Maslin| first= Janet| title= A Bug's Life (1998)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E7DA1639F936A15752C1A96E958260|access-date=6 May 2012| newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 November 1998}}</ref> and subsequently featured on that film's [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] releases.<ref>{{cite news|title=The $152 Million Hit Movie That Broke All Thanksgiving Box Office Records |url=http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/news/19990129-71143.htm |publisher=Pixar |date=29 January 1999 |access-date=May 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230141634/http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/news/19990129-71143.htm |archive-date=December 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n===1998===\n* [[Academy Award]] \u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The 70th Academy Awards (1998) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/70th-winners.html|publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|access-date=April 6, 2012}}</ref>\n* Anima Mundi Animation Festival \u2013 Best Film x2\n* [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] \u2013 Jan Pinkava \n* [[Annie Award]] \u2013 [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject|Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Florida Film Festival]] \u2013 Best Short\n* World Animation Celebration \u2013 Best 3-D CGI by Professional Jan Pinkava \n* [[Zagreb World Festival of Animated Films]] \u2013 Internet Favourite\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.pixar.com/geris-game}} from Pixar\n* {{IMDb title|0131409|Geri's Game}}\n* {{tcmdb title|526369|Geri's Game}}\n* {{bcdb title|39006|Geri's Game}}\n* {{amg movie|294771}}\n\n{{Pixar}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Awards for ''Geri's Game''\n|list=\n{{Academy Award Best Animated Short Film}}\n{{Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:1997 computer-animated films]]\n[[Category:1997 short films]]\n[[Category:1997 in chess]]\n[[Category:Animated films without speech]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Subject Annie Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films about chess]]\n[[Category:Films about old age]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Pixar short films]]\n[[Category:Toy Story characters]]\n[[Category:1990s Disney animated short films]]\n[[Category:American animated short films]]"}]}}}}
