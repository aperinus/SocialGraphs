First broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 25 December 2007, it is the third [[List of Doctor Who Christmas specials|''Doctor Who'' Christmas special]] since the show's revival in 2005. The episode was written by [[Russell T Davies]] and directed by [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]].\n\nIn the episode, the alien businessman Max Capricorn ([[George Costigan]]) seeks revenge on his company after it votes him out. He sets a starship replica of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] on a collision course with Earth to frame the [[board of directors]] for killing the humans on Earth. The episode features the only performance in ''Doctor Who'' by the Australian singer and actress [[Kylie Minogue]], who plays the waitress [[Astrid Peth]]. Davies described her casting as a \"very exceptional case\", having written the part of Astrid specifically for Minogue. \n\nOn its original airdate Christmas 2007, \"Voyage of the Damned\" was watched by 13.31&nbsp;million viewers, the highest viewing figure for ''Doctor Who'' since the 1979 serial ''[[City of Death]]'' and still the highest viewership of any episode since the show's revival. It was the second most-watched programme of 2007, beaten only by the episode of ''[[EastEnders]]'' which aired immediately after it. Critical opinion about the episode was divided; the writing and Minogue's performance were both praised and criticised.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe [[TARDIS]] has collided with a ship called the ''Titanic''. To investigate further, the [[Tenth Doctor]] runs the TARDIS's self-repair programme and boards the ''Titanic'', which the Doctor discovers is a nuclear-powered interstellar cruiser from the planet Sto. Modelled after the [[RMS Titanic|Earth ocean liner of the same name]], the ship is orbiting present-day Earth to observe \"primitive cultures\" \u2013 specifically, Christmas. The Doctor decides to stow away, and joins a party of aliens, including the waitress [[Astrid Peth]], on a brief excursion to London. However, the populace of London fled in fear because of extraterrestrial attacks over the previous two Christmases.\n\nAfter the party return from the excursion, the ship's terminally ill captain, Hardaker, sabotages the ship by engineering its collision with three large meteors. The resulting collision kills most of the passengers on board and draws the ship to an [[extinction-level event|extinction level]] collision with Earth. The Doctor makes contact with [[Midshipman]] Alonzo Frame, a crew member who survived the collision, to help him stabilise the ship. En route to the bridge, the Doctor's party are repeatedly attacked by the Host, androids resembling angels who have been programmed to kill the survivors. The Doctor breaks from the party and attempts to reach the control point for the Host. He is taken to the Host's leader, former cruise line owner Max Capricorn, who is a head attached to a mobile life support unit. Capricorn is bitter about being forced out of his own company, Max Capricorn Cruiseliners, and has plotted the Titanic's inevitable collision with Earth to bankrupt the company and frame the [[board of directors]] for murder, as well as to allow himself to retire comfortably; Captain Hardaker's part was secured by promising financial support for his family. To save the Doctor, Astrid rams Capricorn with a forklift, which sends both of them over a ledge to their deaths in the engine.\n\nThe Doctor uses the Host (now programmed to follow the highest authority - himself) to reach the bridge, where he uses the heat from entering into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's engines, which helps prevent the ship from crashing into [[Buckingham Palace]]. After stabilising the ship, the Doctor realises that the teleport bracelet Astrid was wearing at her demise has backed up her molecular pattern. However, the damaged system can only partially regenerate Astrid. The Doctor reluctantly allows her to dissipate into atoms, so she can fulfill her dream of exploring the universe. He then helps one of the survivors, the ship's questionable but good-hearted historian Mr Copper, to settle on Earth, after Copper is revealed to have become a millionaire.\n\n==Production==\n===Casting===\nDuring the third series press launch in March 2007, the production team was approached by William Baker, [[Kylie Minogue]]'s creative director, about her appearing in the show.
