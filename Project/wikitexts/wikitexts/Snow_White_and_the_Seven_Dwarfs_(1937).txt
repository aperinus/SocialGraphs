Based on [[Snow White|the 1812 German fairy tale]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]], it is the first full-length [[Traditional animation|traditionally animated]] feature film and the first [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. The story was adapted by [[storyboard]] artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, [[Merrill De Maris]], Otto Englander, [[Earl Hurd]], Dick Rickard, [[Ted Sears]] and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while William Cottrell, [[Wilfred Jackson]], Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and [[Ben Sharpsteen]] directed the film's individual sequences.\n\n''Snow White'' premiered at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on December 21, 1937. It was a critical and commercial success and, with international earnings of more than $8 million during its initial release (compared to its $1.5 million budget), it briefly held the record of highest-grossing [[sound film]] at the time. The popularity of the film has led to its being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|top-ten performers at the North American box office]] and the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]]. Worldwide, its inflation-adjusted earnings top the animation list.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records|edition=2015|year=2014|volume=60|isbn=978-1-9088-4370-8|pages=160\u2013161|quote=The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records does not provide an explicit figure for ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''.

Disney's take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural effect, resulting in popular [[Amusement park|theme park]] attractions, a [[video game]], a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]], and an upcoming [[Snow White (2024 film)|live-action film]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. The current count is 633 words. -->\nHaving lost both of her parents at a young age, [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] is a princess living with her wicked and cold-hearted stepmother, the [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Queen]]. Fearing that Snow White's beauty will outshine her own, the Queen forces her to work as a [[scullery maid]] and asks her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] daily \"who is the fairest one of all.\" For years, the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her.\n\nOne day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now the fairest in all of the land. On that same day, Snow White meets and falls in love with a prince who overhears her singing. Angered, the Queen orders her [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Huntsman]] to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring back her heart in a jeweled box. The Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White, and reveals to her the Queen's plot. He then urges her to flee into the woods and never return.\n\nLost and frightened, Snow White is befriended by woodland animals who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children. With the animals' help, she proceeds to clean the place and cook a meal. Snow White soon learns that the cottage is the home of seven [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean, and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. Snow White introduces herself, and the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day; and at night, they all sing, play music, and dance.\n\nBack at the castle, the Magic Mirror reveals that Snow White is still living, and with the dwarfs. Enraged that the Huntsman had tricked her, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into a sleep-like death. She learns the curse can be broken by \"love's first kiss,\" but is certain Snow White will be buried alive before this can happen. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old [[hag]], the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away. The animals see through the disguise, but are unable to warn Snow White; they rush off to find the dwarfs. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into into the apple, and she falls into a death-like slumber.\n\nThe dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage, and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder onto them, but lightning strikes the cliff before she can do so, causing her to fall and get crushed to death by the boulder. In their cottage, the dwarfs find Snow White being kept asleep by the poison. Unwilling to bury in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her.\n\nA year later, the prince learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the prince takes Snow White to his castle.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] introduces each of the Seven Dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' theatrical trailer.]]{{Redirect|Sneezy|the act of sneezing|Sneeze}}\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]\n* [[Lucille La Verne]] as the [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Evil Queen]]\n* [[Harry Stockwell]] as The Prince\n* [[Roy Atwell]] as Doc\n* [[Pinto Colvig]] as Grumpy and Sleepy in a [[dual role]]\n* [[Otis Harlan]] as Happy\n* [[Scotty Mattraw]] as Bashful\n* [[Billy Gilbert]] as Sneezy<ref name=\"archives\">{{cite web |url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/sevendwarfs/sevendwarfs.html |title=The Seven Dwarfs Character History |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801080652/http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/sevendwarfs/sevendwarfs.html |work=Disney Archives |access-date=September 25, 2008 |archive-date=August 1, 2003 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* [[Eddie Collins (actor)|Eddie Collins]] (vocal effects and live-action reference)<ref name=\"archives\" /> and [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] (vocal effects) as Dopey\n* [[Moroni Olsen]] as [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|The Magic Mirror]]\n* [[Stuart Buchanan]] as [[Huntsman (Snow White)|The Huntsman]]\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Original Theatrical Trailer 1) 1937 (La Blancaneu).ogv|thumb|Film trailer, featuring reviews, cels from the production, and introducing the characters by their personality.]]\n\nDevelopment on ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' began in early 1934, and in June 1934, [[Walt Disney]] announced the production of his first feature, to be released under Walt Disney Productions,<ref name=\"Smith33\" /> to ''[[The New York Times]]''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=125\u2013126}} One evening that same year, Disney acted out the entire story of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' to his staff, announcing that the film would be produced as a feature-length film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lebowitz|first1=Shana|title=The way Walt Disney inspired his team to make 'Snow White' reveals his creative genius \u2014 and insane perfectionism|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-walt-disney-inspired-snow-white-2015-9|access-date=October 11, 2015|work=Business Insider|date=September 20, 2015|archive-date=April 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413204230/https://www.businessinsider.com/how-walt-disney-inspired-snow-white-2015-9|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBefore ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', the Disney studio had been primarily involved in the production of animated [[short subjects]] in the ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' and ''[[Silly Symphony|Silly Symphonies]]'' series.

Both his brother and business partner [[Roy O.

Disney ran a rough cut for [[Joseph Rosenberg]] of [[Bank of America]], who sat impassively during the showing. Then Rosenberg turned to the worried Disney and said, \u201cWalt, that thing is going to make a hatful of money\u201d and approved the loan.<ref>Bob Thomas. Walt Disney: An American Original. Simon & Schuster, 1976</ref>\n\n=== Story development ===\nOn August 9, 1934, twenty-one pages of notes\u2014entitled \"Snowwhite suggestions\"\u2014were compiled by staff writer Richard Creedon, suggesting the principal characters, as well as situations and 'gags' for the story. As Disney had stated at the very beginning of the project, the main attraction of the story for him was the Seven Dwarfs, and their possibilities for \"screwiness\" and \"gags\"; the three story meetings held in October and attended by Disney, Creedon, Larry Morey, Albert Hurter, [[Ted Sears]] and [[Pinto Colvig]] were dominated by such subjects. At this point, Disney preferred to begin actual work on Snow White's discovery of the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=126\u2013127}} Disney had suggested from the beginning that each of the dwarfs, whose names and personalities are not stated in the original fairy tale, could have individual personalities. The dwarfs' names were chosen from a pool of about fifty potentials, including Jumpy, Deafy, Dizzey, Hickey, Wheezy, Baldy, Gabby, Nifty, Sniffy, Swift, Lazy, Puffy, Stuffy, Tubby, Shorty, and Burpy.{{sfn|Thomas|1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/disneysartofanim00thom/page/68/mode/2up 68]}} The seven finalists were chosen through a process of elimination. The leader of the dwarfs, required to be pompous, self-important and bumbling, was named Doc; others were named for their distinguishing character traits. At the end of the October story meetings, however, only Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, Sleepy, and Happy of the final seven were named; the other two dwarfs were named Jumpy and \"Seventh,\" who was deaf and spry.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=128}}\n\nAlong with a focus on the characterizations and comedic possibilities of the dwarfs, Creedon's eighteen-page outline of the story written from the October meetings, featured a continuous flow of gags as well as the Queen's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb, an element taken from the Grimms' original story. After persuading Snow White to use the comb, the disguised Queen would have escaped alive, but the dwarfs would have arrived in time to remove it. After the failure of the comb, the Queen was to have the Prince captured and taken to her dungeon, where she would have come to him (story sketches show this event both with the Queen and the Witch) and used magic to bring the dungeon's skeletons to life, making them dance for him and identifying one skeleton as \"Prince Oswald\", an example of the more humorous atmosphere of this original story treatment.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=127\u2013128}} It is written in story notes that the Queen has such magical power only in her own domain, the castle. With the Prince refusing to marry her, the Queen leaves him to his death (one sketch shows the Prince trapped in a subterranean chamber filling with water){{sfn|Canemaker|1996|p=34}} as she makes her way to the dwarfs' cottage with the poisoned apple. The forest animals were to help the Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse. The Prince was to ride to the cottage to save Snow White but took the wrong road (despite warnings from the forest animals and his horse, whom he, unlike Snow White, could not understand). He, therefore, would not have arrived in time to save her from the Queen but would have been able to save her with love's first kiss. This plot was not used in the final film, though many sketches of the scene in the dungeon were made by Ferdinand Horvath.\n\nOther examples of the more comical nature of the story at this point included suggestions for a \"fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied\" Queen.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=128}} The Prince was also more of a clown, and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion. Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio to contribute to the story, offering five dollars for every 'gag';{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=221}} such gags included the dwarfs' noses popping over the foot of the bed when they first meet Snow White.\n\nDisney became concerned that such a comical approach would lessen the plausibility of the characters and, sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen, advised in an outline circulated on November 6 that attention be paid exclusively to \"scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear\". The names and personalities of the dwarfs, however, were still \"open to change\". A meeting of November 16 resulted in another outline entitled 'Dwarfs Discover Snowwhite', which introduced the character of Dopey,{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=128}} who would ultimately prove to be the most successful of the dwarf characterizations.{{sfn|Thomas|1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/disneysartofanim00thom/page/68/mode/2up 68\u201369]}} For the rest of 1934, Disney further developed the story by himself, finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, who he felt could no longer be \"fat\" and \"batty\", but a \"stately beautiful type\", a possibility already brought up in previous story meetings.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=129}} Disney did not focus on the project again until the autumn of 1935. It was believed that the ''Silly Symphony'' short ''[[The Goddess of Spring]]'' (1934) may have placed doubt in his studio's abilities to animate a realistic girl.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=129}} Apparently, a three-month trip to Europe that summer restored his confidence. At this point, Disney and his writers focused on the scenes in which Snow White and the dwarfs are introduced to the audience and each other.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=140\u2013141}} He laid out the likely assignments for everyone working on the film in a memorandum of November 25, 1935, and had decided on the personalities of the individual dwarfs.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\nIt had first been thought that the dwarfs would be the main focus of the story, and many sequences were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White.{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|page=[https://archive.org/details/TheIllusionOfLifeDisneyAnimation/page/n231/mode/2up 232]}} For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially-animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a \"lodge meeting\" in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed-building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This was also cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story.{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|page=[https://archive.org/details/TheIllusionOfLifeDisneyAnimation/page/n231/mode/2up 232]}} The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by [[Ward Kimball]], who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio; Disney, however, persuaded him to stay by promoting Kimball to supervising animator of [[Jiminy Cricket]] in his next feature ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940).{{sfn|Canemaker|2001|pp=99\u2013101}}\n\n=== Animation ===\n[[File:Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (2).jpg|thumb|left|The famous \"[[Heigh-Ho]]\" sequence from ''Snow White'' was animated by [[Shamus Culhane]].]]\n\nThe primary authority on the design of the film was concept artist Albert Hurter. All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, had to meet Hurter's approval before being finalized.{{sfn|Canemaker|1996|p=22}} Two other concept artists\u2014Ferdinand Horvath and [[Gustaf Tenggren]]\u2014also contributed to the visual style of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''. Horvath developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's.{{sfn|Canemaker|1996|pp=32\u201333}} Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of [[Arthur Rackham]] and [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]] and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought.{{sfn|Canemaker|1996|pp=39\u201340}} He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. However, Horvath didn't receive a credit for the film.{{sfn|Canemaker|1996|pp=33\u201334}} Other artists to work on the film included [[Joe Grant]], whose most significant contribution was the design for [[Queen (Snow White)|the Queen]]'s Witch form.{{sfn|Canemaker|1996|p=51}}\n\n{{quote box| width  = 22em| align  = right| quote  = [[Donald W.

Though there was no teacher, Babbitt had recruited a model to pose for him and his fellow animators as they drew. These \"classes\" were held weekly; each week, more animators would come. After three weeks, Walt Disney called Babbit to his office and offered to provide the supplies, working space and models required if the sessions were moved to the studio. Babbitt ran the sessions for a month until animator [[Hardie Gramatky]] suggested that they recruit [[Donald W. Graham|Don Graham]], an art teacher from the Chouinard Institute. Graham taught his first class at the studio on November 15, 1932, and was joined by Philip L. Dike a few weeks later.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp=125\u2013126}} These classes were principally concerned with human anatomy and movement, though instruction later included action analysis, animal anatomy and acting.<ref name=\"Girveau\">{{cite book |editor=Girveau, Bruno |title=Once Upon a Time&nbsp;\u2014 Walt Disney: The Sources of inspiration for the Disney Studios |publisher=Prestel |location=London |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-7913-3770-8}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 22em\n| align  = left\n| quote  = The first duty of the cartoon is not to picture or duplicate real action or things as they actually happen\u2014but to give a caricature of life and action\u2014to picture on the screen things that have run thru the imagination of the audience to bring to life dream-fantasies and imaginative fancies that we have all thought of during our lives or have had pictured to us in various forms during our lives [...] I definitely feel that we cannot do the fantastic things, based on the real, unless we first know the real.

Graham often screened Disney shorts and, along with the animators, provided critique featuring both strengths and weaknesses. For example, Graham criticised Babbitt's animation of Abner the mouse in ''[[The Country Cousin]]'' as \"taking a few of the obvious actions of a drunk without coordinating the rest of the body\", while praising it for maintaining its humour without getting \"dirty or mean or vulgar. The country mouse is always having a good time\".<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\nVery few of the animators at the Disney studio had had artistic training (most had been newspaper cartoonists); among these few was [[Grim Natwick]], who had trained in Europe. The animator's success in designing and animating [[Betty Boop]] for [[Fleischer Studios]] showed an understanding of human female anatomy and, when Walt Disney hired Natwick, he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively. Attempts to animate Persephone, the female lead of ''The Goddess of Spring'', had proved largely unsuccessful; Natwick's animation of the heroine in ''Cookie Carnival'' showed greater promise, and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself. Though live action footage of Snow White, the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators, the artists' animators disapproved of [[rotoscoping]], considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature. Nevertheless, all of the above-mentioned characters were fully rotoscoped and utilized by their respective artists, some more, some less.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=David |title=Snow White's People: An Oral History of the Disney Film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \u2014 Vol. 1 |publisher=Theme Park Press |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-6839-0054-2}}</ref> Despite Graham and Natwick's objections, however, some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live-action footage.<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\nIt proved difficult to add color to Snow White's and the Queen's faces. Eventually, they found a red dye that worked and which was added with a small piece of cotton wrapped around a tipple pencil on each individual cel. [[Helen Ogger]], an employee at the ink department, was also an animator and decided to use the same system used in animation. The method was so time-consuming that it was never used again on the same scale. It was also used to a smaller degree in ''Pinocchio'' and ''Fantasia'' but, after Ogger left the studio in 1941, there was no one else with the same skills who could replace her.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnson |first=David |date=1988 |title=Not Rouge, Mr. Thomas! |url=http://www.animationartist.com/columns/DJohnson/Not_Rouge/not_rouge.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510124524/http://www.animationartist.com/columns/DJohnson/Not_Rouge/not_rouge.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 10, 2000 |work=Animation Artist Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe studio's new [[multiplane camera]] gave a three-dimensional feeling in many sequences and was also used to give a rotating effect in the scene where the Queen transforms into a witch.\n\n=== Music and records ===\n{{main|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe songs in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' were composed by [[Frank Churchill]] and [[Larry Morey]]. [[Paul Smith (film and television composer)|Paul J. Smith]] and [[Leigh Harline]] composed the incidental music score. Well-known songs from the film include \"[[Heigh-Ho]]\", \"[[Someday My Prince Will Come]]\", and \"[[Whistle While You Work]]\". Since Disney did not have its own music publishing company at the time, the publishing rights for the music and songs were administered through [[Bourne Co. Music Publishers]], which continues to hold these rights. In later years, the studio was able to acquire back the music rights from many of their other films, but not ''Snow White, [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]], [[Dumbo]] or most [[Silly Symphony]] cartoons.'' ''Snow White'' became the first American film to have a [[soundtrack album]], released in conjunction with the feature film. Before ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', a film soundtrack recording was unheard of and of little value to a movie studio. \n\n=== Cinematic influences ===\nAt this time, Disney also encouraged his staff to see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936)\u2014to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin\u2014to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', as well as the two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) and ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\n== Release ==\n=== Original theatrical run ===\n''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' premiered at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] on December 21, 1937.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=229}} The film received a standing ovation at its completion<ref>{{cite book|last=Kinni|first=Theodore|title=Be Our Guest: Revised and Updated Edition|publisher=Disney Electronic Content|isbn=978-1-4231-4014-6|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90mwv8Ag8lUC&q=standing+ovation+%22snow+white%22&pg=PA59|access-date=January 5, 2013|date=December 16, 2011|archive-date=January 28, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220128131850/https://books.google.com/books?id=90mwv8Ag8lUC&q=standing+ovation+%22snow+white%22&pg=PA59|url-status=live}}</ref> from an audience that included [[Judy Garland]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Charles Laughton]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cousins |first=Mark |title=The Story of Film |year=2006 |publisher=Pavilion |isbn=978-1-86205-760-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G2yMRux\u20133C0C&pg=PA166 166]}}</ref> Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Happy, Grumpy, Bashful, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Dopey, Disney |url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19371227,00.html |magazine=Time |date=December 27, 1937 |archive-date=September 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918015044/http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19371227,00.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Three weeks later, it opened at the [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]] and a theater in [[Miami]] in January 1938,{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=229}} in which the strong box office sales encouraged [[RKO Radio Pictures]] to place the film into general release on February 4.
