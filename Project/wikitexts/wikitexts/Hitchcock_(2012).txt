''Hitchcock'' tells the story of the relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and his wife [[Alma Reville]] during the [[filming]] of [[Psycho (1960 film)|''Psycho'']] in 1959. \n''Hitchcock''  premiered at the [[AFI Fest]] on November 1, 2012 and was released in the [[United States]] on November 23 by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. It grossed $27 million against a $15 million budget.\n\n==Plot ==\nIn 1959, Alfred Hitchcock opens his latest film, ''[[North by Northwest]]'', to both critical and commercial success, but is troubled by a reporter's insinuation that he should retire. Seeking to reclaim the artistic daring of his youth, Hitchcock turns down film proposals, including ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', in favor of a horror novel called ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]], based on the real-life crimes of murderer [[Ed Gein]]. Gein appears in sequences throughout the film, in which he seems to prompt Hitchcock's imagination regarding the ''Psycho'' story, or act as some function of Hitchcock's subconscious mind (for instance, drawing Hitchcock's attention to sand on his bathroom floor, the quantity of which reveals how much time his wife Alma has been spending at the beachhouse with Whitfield Cook).\n\nHitchcock's wife and artistic collaborator, Alma, is no more enthusiastic about the idea than his colleagues, especially since she is being lobbied by their writer friend, [[Whitfield Cook]], to look at his own screenplay. However, she warms to Hitchcock's proposal, suggesting the innovative plot turn of killing the female lead early in the film. The studio heads at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] prove more difficult to persuade, forcing Hitchcock to finance the film personally and use his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television crew (over at competitor Revue/Universal) to shoot the film, his last with Paramount.\n\nThe pressures of the production, such as dealing with Geoffrey Shurlock of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], and Hitchcock's lecherous habits, such as when they confer with the female lead, [[Janet Leigh]], annoy Alma. She begins a personal writing collaboration with Whitfield Cook on his screenplay at his beach house without Hitchcock's knowledge. Hitchcock eventually discovers what she has been doing and suspects her of having an affair. This concern affects Hitchcock's work on ''Psycho''. Hitchcock eventually confronts Alma and asks her if she is having an affair. Alma angrily denies it.\n\nAlma temporarily takes over production of the film when Hitchcock is bedridden after collapsing from overwork, working on a sequence which included a complicated [[Rear projection effect|process shot]] showing Detective Arbogast's demise, with Alma's specification of a 35mm lens, instead of the 50mm lens preferred by Hitchcock for this film.\n\nMeanwhile, Hitchcock expresses his disappointment to [[Vera Miles]] at how she didn't follow through on his plan to make her the next biggest star after [[Grace Kelly]], but Miles says she is happy with her family life.\n\nHitchcock's cut of ''Psycho'' is poorly received by the studio executives, while Alma discovers Whitfield having sex with a younger woman at his beach house. Hitchcock and Alma reconcile and set to work on improving the film. Their renewed collaboration yields results, culminating in Alma persuading Hitchcock to accept their composer's suggestion for adding [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s harsh strings score to the shower scene.\n\nAfter maneuvering Shurlock into leaving the film's content largely intact, Hitchcock learns the studio is only going to open the film in two theaters. Hitchcock arranges for special theater instructions to pique the public's interest such as forbidding admittance after the film begins. At the film's premiere, Hitchcock first views the audience from the projection booth, looking out through its small window at them. Hitchcock then waits in the lobby for the audience's reaction, conducting slashing motions to their reactions as they scream on cue. The film is rewarded with an enthusiastic reception.\n\nWith the film's screening so well received, Hitchcock publicly thanks his wife for helping make it possible and they affirm their love and partnership. At the conclusion at his home, Hitchcock addresses the audience noting ''Psycho'' proved a major high point of his career and he is currently pondering his next project. A raven lands on his shoulder hinting at his next motion picture, ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''.\n\nThe final title cards say that Hitchcock directed six more films after ''Psycho'', none of which would eclipse its commercial success, and although he never won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], the [[American Film Institute]] awarded him its Life Achievement Award in 1979: an award that he claimed he shared, as he had his life, with his wife, Alma.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus some historical, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Alma Reville]]\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]]\n* [[Toni Collette]] as [[Peggy Robertson]]\n* [[Danny Huston]] as [[Whitfield Cook]]\n* [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]]\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Lew Wasserman]]\n* [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]\n* [[Michael Wincott]] as [[Ed Gein]]\n* [[Kurtwood Smith]] as Geoffrey Shurlock\n* [[Richard Portnow]] as [[Barney Balaban]]\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Joseph Stefano]]\n* [[Wallace Langham]] as [[Saul Bass]]\n* Paul Schackman as [[Bernard Herrmann]]\n* Richard Chassler as [[Martin Balsam]]\n* Josh Yeo as [[John Gavin]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 2005, it was reported that [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] would produce a television film or [[miniseries]] based on [[Stephen Rebello]]'s book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Denise|title=A&E looks into 'Live'|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117925863?refCatId=14|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=September 17, 2012|date=July 13, 2005}}</ref> Subsequently, the book was optioned as a major motion picture.
