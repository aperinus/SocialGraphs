Based on the short story \"[[Vengeance is Mine Inc.]]\" by [[Roald Dahl]], the film follows long-time friends Mitch ([[Norm Macdonald]]) and Sam ([[Artie Lange]]) who start a revenge-for-hire business, and work to fund heart surgery for Sam's father Pops ([[Jack Warden]]). When they take on work for an unscrupulous businessman ([[Christopher McDonald]]), in order to be paid, they create a revenge scheme of their own. [[Traylor Howard]] also stars and notable cameo appearances include [[Don Rickles]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[John Goodman]], [[Gary Coleman]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[David Koechner]], [[Chris Farley]] (in his final film appearance), and [[Adam Sandler]] as [[Satan]].\n\nThe film was the first starring vehicle for Macdonald and Lange, and the [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of Saget, coming one year after he left his long-running role as host of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]''.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Snierson |first=Dan\n |title=Bob Saget returns to 'America's Funniest Home Videos' for 20th anniversary celebration\n |newspaper=Entertainment Weekly\n |date=September 16, 2008\n |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/09/16/bob-saget-returns-to-americas-funniest-home-videos-for-one-episode/\n}}</ref>\n\nThough ''Dirty Work'' received largely negative critical reviews upon its 1998 release and was a [[Box-office bomb|financial disappointment]], it has since become a [[Cult following|cult classic]] and has been reappraised more positively by some critics. Co-star [[Artie Lange]] later became a regular on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', where the film was sometimes discussed. A sequel was planned but ultimately canceled following both Macdonald and Saget's deaths in 2021 and 2022 respectively.\n\n== Plot ==\nGrowing up, friends Mitch Weaver and Sam McKenna are taught by Sam's hard-nosed father, \"Pops\" McKenna, not to \"take crap from anyone\". To that end, the pair plant a bunch of guns in a schoolyard [[bullying|bully]]'s desk and have him arrested for gun possession; next, they catch a [[child molestation|kid-fondling]] [[crossing guard]] in the act, after having applied [[Cyanoacrylate|Krazy Glue]] to the seat of Mitch's pants.\n\nAs adults, after losing fourteen jobs in three months and being dumped by his girlfriend, Mitch moves in with Sam and Pops, who then has a heart attack. In the hospital, Pops confides that, because of their parents' [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging lifestyle]], he is also Mitch's father, meaning that Mitch and Sam are half-brothers. Even though Pops' heart is failing, Dr. Farthing, a hopeless gambler, will raise Mr. McKenna's position on the transplant waiting list if he is paid $50,000, to save himself from his bookie. Mitch and Sam get jobs in a [[Movie theater|cinema]] with an abusive manager and exact their revenge by showing ''[[Porn parody|Men In Black (Who Like To Have Sex With Each Other)]]'' to a packed house and get their manager fired. The other workers congratulate them and suggest they go into business.\n\nMitch and Sam open \"Dirty Work\", a revenge-for-hire business (the Dirty Work phone number is \"555-0187\", a [[555 phone number#Fictitious phone numbers|fictitious number]] used later on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/99/99lerectile.phtml\n |title=Transcript of Erectile Dysfunction Ad SNL 25:12\n |date=February 12, 2000\n |publisher=snltranscripts.jt.org\n |access-date=2007-02-02\n}}</ref>). Mitch falls for a woman named Kathy who works for a shady used car dealer. After publicly embarrassing the dealer during a live television commercial (Mitch: \"Here\u2019s another dead hooker in this trunk!\"), the duo exacts increasingly lucrative reprisals for satisfied customers until they interfere with unscrupulous local property developer Travis Cole. Cole tricks them into destroying \"his\" apartment building (actually owned by Mr. John Kirkpatrick, the [[landlord]]), promising to pay them enough to save Pops. Afterwards, Cole reneges, revealing that he is not the owner and that he had them vandalize the building so that he could buy it cheaply, evict the tenants (including Kathy's grandmother), and build a parking lot for his beloved [[opera house]]. Unknown to Cole, Mitch's \"note to self\"<ref>{{cite news\n |title=The Best and Worst Films of 1998\n |first=Michael |last=O'Sullivan\n |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]\n |date=January 1, 1999\n |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/features/bestof98.htm\n}} (Macdonald used \"Note to Self\" reminders into a real or imagined pocket tape recorder on [[Saturday Night Live|SNL]] [[Weekend Update]].)</ref> mini-[[tape recorder]] captures this confession.\n\nMitch and Sam plot their revenge on Cole, using the tape to set up an elaborate trap. Using skunks, a loyal army of prostitutes, homeless men, a noseless friend, brownies with hallucinogenic additives, and Pops, they ruin the opening night of ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', an opera sponsored prominently by Cole. With the media present, Mitch plays back Cole's confession over the theater's sound system. Cole sees that his public image is being tarnished and agrees to pay the $50,000. In the end, Cole is punched in the stomach, arrested and jailed, his dog is raped by a skunk, Pops gets his operation, and Mitch gets the girl. Dr. Farthing overcomes his gambling habit, but gets beaten to death by the bookies anyway. \"That's it.
