Little]]. The film stars [[Steven Seagal]] as John Hatcher, a former [[DEA]] troubleshooter who returns to his [[Illinois]] hometown to find it taken over by a [[Jamaican posse|posse]] of vicious [[Jamaica]]n [[illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] led by Screwface. Using a combination of fear and [[Obeah]], a Jamaican [[syncretism|syncretic religion]] of [[West Africa]]n and [[Caribbean]] origin similar to [[Haitian Vodou|Haitian vodou]] and [[Santer\u00eda]], Screwface rules the drug trade in Hatcher's Lincoln Heights.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=October 2022}}\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->[[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) agent and decorated soldier John Hatcher returns from Colombia, where drug dealers killed his partner Chico, and John killed the dealers. As a result of Chico's death and years of dead-end work, Hatcher retires and heads to his family's hometown of Lincoln Heights, in suburban [[Chicago]]. He visits the local high school to meet old friend and former [[U.S. Army]] buddy Max Keller who works there as a football coach and physical education teacher.\n\nAs John and Max celebrate their reunion at a club, a gunfight breaks out between local drug dealers and a Jamaican gang at the venue. The gang, an unnamed [[Jamaican Posse]], is led by a notorious [[Psychosis|psychotic]] [[drug lord]] named Screwface. John arrests one of Screwface's henchmen as the gunfight ends.\n\nNews of Posse crimes occurring in Chicago and across the United States spread as the Posse expands its operations and recruits more members. The next day, Screwface sends his henchmen to do a drive-by shooting on the house where John, his sister Melissa, and Melissa's 12-year-old daughter Tracey live. Tracey is injured and hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nIn the subsequent investigation, John encounters a gangster named Jimmy Fingers, whom he is forced to kill. A Jamaican gangster named Nesta arrives and is subdued by John, who asks about Screwface. Nesta gives information but tells him to go after Screwface alone and jumps out the window to his death. The next day, John discovers a strange symbol engraved on a carpet, and with the help of Jamaican voodoo and gang expert Leslie Davalos, a detective for the [[Chicago Police Department]], learns that it is an African black magic [[ideogram]] symbolizing blood that is used to mark their crimes. John decides to come out of retirement to join Max in a battle against Screwface.\n\nOn the night of their rendezvous, John gets a phone call from Melissa, which is cut short when Screwface and his men invade the Hatcher household. They leave upon John's arrival, and Melissa is unharmed. The next day, John and Max encounter another batch of Screwface's henchmen, resulting in a car chase. The chase ends in a high-end jewelry store, wherein two henchmen are wounded and one is killed by Hatcher amidst the chaos of shoppers fleeing the scene.\n\nLater, during a meeting with Leslie, she informs John that the only way to stop the Jamaican Posse is to bring down Screwface. That evening, Screwface ambushes John under the guise of a construction crew; he plants a [[Molotov cocktail]] in John's car. John barely escapes before the car explodes.\n\nJohn and Max then team up with Charles, a Jamaican-born detective of the Chicago police who has been trailing Screwface for five years. They acquire weaponry from a local weapons dealer, and, after testing the arsenal, they head for [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Upon arrival, Max and Charles ask people in the streets for information about Screwface. A Jamaican local presents them a photo of a woman who is acquainted with Screwface and informs them of a nightclub which she frequents. John meets the woman in the nightclub, where she provides him details of Screwface such as her frequent hangouts with him, his drug business, and the address of his mansion, as well as the death of her sister by Screwface's hands. The woman also informs John of a cryptic clue: the secret of Screwface's power is that he has two heads and four eyes.\n\nBy nightfall, John, Max, and Charles (disguised as members of the Posse) head for Screwface's mansion. Secretly infiltrating the premises through a nearby [[plantation]], John eliminates three roving henchmen on the estate's balcony with his silenced sniper rifle, plants a bomb at a nearby power station, and infiltrates the inner grounds. While Max and Charles keep a lookout and observe the party in progress, John detonates the bomb, causing the party to erupt into chaos. With Max and Charles opening fire on the Posse gang, John enters the building and disposes of many henchmen. He makes his way to a sacrificial area, but gets captured by Screwface and his remaining henchmen. John manages to break free and kill or wound every henchman before decapitating Screwface with his own sword.\n\nUpon returning to Chicago, the trio display Screwface's severed head to the Chicago Posse to try to convince them to end their crimes and leave town. However, Charles is impaled by a man who is revealed to be Screwface's twin brother, making the gang believe that Screwface has returned from the dead using voodoo. A gunfight breaks out wherein Max holds off the henchmen despite being shot in the leg while John dispatches more gang members before he engages Screwface's twin in a sword fight.<ref>\u2033During the fight between John and the twin, the latter reveals that he and Screwface lied about being one man over the years with varying gangs and victims to dissuade suspicion and that he was the one responsible for the Posse crimes across the United States\u2033</ref> The fight moves to a nightclub owned by the twin, where Hatcher gives him more fatal injuries by gouging his eyes and breaking his spine before dropping him down an elevator shaft, impaling him in the process. As the surviving Posse members discover their boss' corpse, their fates remain ambiguous, although the death of the Screwface twins implies their arrest by law enforcement.\n\nJohn leaves the scene carrying Charles' body with Max limping next to him as they walk off into the early morning.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as DEA Agent John Hatcher\n* [[Keith David]] as Max Keller\n* [[Joanna Pacu\u0142a]] as Professor Leslie\n* [[Basil Wallace]] as \"Screwface and screwfaces twin brother\n* [[Tom Wright (actor)|Tom Wright]] as Detective Charles Marks\n* [[Kevin Dunn]] as FBI Agent Sal Roselli\n* [[Elizabeth Gracen]] as Melissa Hatcher\n* [[Bette Ford]] as Kate Hatcher\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as Tracey Hatcher\n* [[Al Israel]] as Tito Barco\n* Richard Delmonte as DEA Agent Chico\n* Arlen Dean Snyder as DEA Agent Duvall\n* Victor Romero Evans as Nesta\n* [[Michael Ralph]] as \"Monkey\"\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Hector\n* [[Tom Dugan (actor born 1961)|Tom Dugan]] as Paco\n* Gary Carlos Cervantes as Richard \"Little Richard\"\n* Joe Renteria as Raoul\n* [[Jeffrey Anderson-Gunter]] as \"Nago\"\n* [[Peter Jason]] as DEA Assistant Director Pete Stone\n* Stanley White as Sheriff O'Dwyer\n* [[Earl Boen]] as Dr. Stein\n* [[Rita Verreos]] as Marta, Voodoo Priestess\n* Tracey Burch as Sexy Girl #1\n* [[Teri Weigel]] as Sexy Girl #2\n* [[Jimmy Cliff]] as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nSteven Seagal had wanted to hire director Dwight Little for his second feature, ''[[Hard to Kill]]'', but studio [[Warner Bros.]] vetoed his choice, and went with [[Bruce Malmuth]] instead. According to Little, Seagal had the option in his contract with Warner to do one film with another studio. Seagal chose to exercise that option and make his third film at 20th Century Fox, where he demanded  that they hire Little for ''Marked for Death''. \"I got that job only because Steven insisted,\" said Little.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Dwight Little interview|url=https://www.flashbackfiles.com/dwight-little-interview|access-date=2021-05-23|website=THE FLASHBACK FILES|language=en-US}}</ref> During production, the studio was pushing for more humor in the film, but Little and Seagal had made a pact to resist these attempts. Their template for the film was [[The French Connection (film)|''The French Connection'']].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn the third day of shooting ''Marked for Death'', ''Hard to Kill'' came out in theaters. Dwight Little: \"It opened huge, and it stayed on top for a while. No one, including Steven, thought that was going to be success. But it was. Frankly, just based on his charisma and a couple of good action scenes. I was downtown shooting a scene for ''Marked for Death'' when suddenly I see all these limos and towncars coming to the set. They were all CAA-agents and producers, coming out of the woodwork to see the next big action guy. They all wanted to talk to him.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOf Seagal's martial arts, Little said: \"Steven is the only guy who does what he does in the movies, where you let your opponent's energy go past you. In that respect, he's totally unique. But it's not a forward, high kicking, punching thing. That's why I felt I needed action movie stuff, like car chases, gun fights, explosions and some old fashioned cop stuff. Because if we tried to string together a bunch of Steven's fights, they will quickly start to feel the same.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Marked for Death (soundtrack)}}\nA soundtrack containing [[hip hop]], [[reggae]], and [[R&B music]] was released on September 27, 1990 by [[Delicious Vinyl]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Marked for Death'' opened at number one at the U.S. box office with an opening weekend gross of $11,790,047,<ref name=Mojo/> making it Seagal's second straight film to open #1.
