Eustace sends two priests to a beach, where they inform Jesus of the problem. Three vampires, including Maxine Shreck, kill the priests, but Jesus kills two of the vampires by using the lake as [[holy water]]. Maxine escapes. Jesus goes to Ottawa, gets a haircut, and buys wood to make stakes.\n\nThirty [[Atheism|atheist]]s jump out of a car and confront Jesus, only to be easily defeated. Jesus teams up with Mary Magnum and infiltrates the hospital, where they discover that Dr. Praetorious is performing [[Skin grafting|skin-transplant]]s to make the vampires immune to sunlight. Maxine and Johnny Golgotha defeat Jesus and Mary in a rooftop-battle. Thus Mary is bitten, becoming a vampire.\n\nJesus calls upon a Mexican wrestler, [[El Santo]], for help. At a nightclub, they slay dozens of vampires, but El Santo and his assistant are captured. The next day, Johnny, Maxine, and Mary capture Jesus and bring him to a junkyard where his allies are being held. Eustace is there, and he reveals that he is a vampire. A battle breaks out. Jesus simultaneously fights Dr. Praetorious at the hospital. The doctor is fatally wounded, but Jesus heals him.\n\nAt the junkyard, Eustace stabs Jesus with a stake. A bright light emerges from the wound, killing Eustace and Johnny. El Santo shields a vampire whom he loves from the light, and Jesus cures her and Mary's vampirism. To his surprise, Mary loves Maxine, so Jesus cures her too. Later, Jesus resumes preaching.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Phil Caracas]] \u2013 Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter\n* [[Jeff Moffet]] \u2013 El Santo\n* [[Murielle Varhelyi]] \u2013 Maxine Shreck\n* [[Maria Moulton]] \u2013 Mary Magnum\n* [[Tim Devries]] \u2013 Father Eustace\n* [[Ian Driscoll]] \u2013 Johnny Golgotha\n* [[Josh Grace (actor)|Josh Grace]] \u2013 Dr. Praetorious\n* [[Jay Stone (actor)|Jay Stone]] \u2013 God (voice)\n* [[Jenny Coutts (actress)|Jenny Coutts]] \u2013 Virgin Mary\n* [[Ivan Freud]] \u2013 Narrator\n\n== Reception ==\n''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s [[Richard Corliss]] panned the film, finding that \"the comedy is slack, the song lyrics feeble, the pace torpid\".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,596076,00.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040312050419/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,596076,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 March 2004 | title=Jesus Christ Movie Star | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| first=Richard | last=Corliss | date=29 February 2004 | accessdate=14 October 2010 }}</ref> Ken Eisner of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' took a more neutral view, finding that \"the film is too silly to offend\".<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117917701.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 | title=Review: ''Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter'' | magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | first=Ken | last=Eisner | date=10 May 2002 | accessdate=2008-01-19 }}</ref> Jason Nolan of ''The Harrow'' deemed the production \"horridly wonderful\", although uneven, noting that \"[w]ith a film like this, you want it to be bumpy\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theharrow.com/columns/reviews/jesusvampire.html |publisher=[[The Harrow]] |access-date=2008-01-29 |year=2004 |first=Jason |last=Nolan |title=Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter (review) |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212203105/http://www.theharrow.com/columns/reviews/jesusvampire.html |archive-date=12 February 2008 }}</ref> Film Threat's Eric Campos gave the film a generally positive review.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=3134 | publisher=[[Film Threat]] | title= Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter (review) | first=Eric | last=Campos | accessdate=14 October 2010 }} {{rating|4|4}}</ref>\n{{Rotten Tomatoes prose|80||10|ref=yes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Wikiquote-inline|Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060614144552/http://www.odessafilmworks.com/jcvh/index.html Odessa Filmworks: ''Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter'']\n* {{IMDb title|0311361|Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter}}\n* {{Amg movie|274955|Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|id=jesus_christ_vampire_hunter|title=Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter}}\n\n[[Category:2001 comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2001 films]]\n[[Category:Canadian LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Films set in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Ottawa]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Jesus]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of El Santo]]\n[[Category:2000s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:Portrayals of Jesus in film]]\n[[Category:Canadian satirical films]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n[[Category:2001 LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related horror films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related musical films]]\n[[Category:Canadian musical films]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related science fiction films]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampire hunters]]\n[[Category:Canadian vampire films]]\n[[Category:2000s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Canadian action films]]\n[[Category:2000s action horror films]]\n[[Category:Canadian comedy horror films]]\n[[Category:2000s exploitation films]]\n[[Category:2001 comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Lee Demarbre]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
