Murray Abraham]]. The screenplay was vaguely inspired by the story of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' and is about Lenny Weinrib's (Allen) search for his genius adopted son's biological mother, ultimately finding that she is a dim-witted prostitute named Linda Ash (Sorvino).\n\nWhile critical reception of ''Mighty Aphrodite'' overall was mildly positive, Sorvino was highly praised for her performance, earning several accolades such as the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], as well as a [[Golden Globe Award]], [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]], [[Critics' Choice Movie Award]], [[National Board of Review|National Board of Review Award]], and a [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Film Critics Association|Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on ancient Greek ruins where a chanting [[Greek chorus]] introduces and narrates the story of Lenny Weinrib. Lenny is a sportswriter in Manhattan, married to ambitious curator Amanda. The couple decide to adopt a baby, a boy they name Max. Lenny is awed by their son who, it becomes increasingly clear, is a gifted child.\n\nLenny becomes obsessed with learning the identity of Max's biological mother. After a long search, Lenny is disturbed to find that she is a prostitute and part-time porn star who uses several names but confesses her birth name is Leslie Ash, and she likes \"Linda\" because it means \u201cbeautiful\u201d in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Lenny makes an \"appointment\" to see her at her apartment. Linda is a bit of a ditz with a crude sense of humor and delusions of becoming a stage actress. Lenny does not have intercourse with her but instead urges her to get away from prostitution and start a wholesome life. Linda becomes angry, refunds Lenny's money, and forces him to leave. Lenny, however, is determined to befriend her and improve her life. He first manages to get Linda away from her violent pimp and then attempts to pair Linda with a former boxer, Kevin. They appear to be a well-suited couple until Kevin discovers Linda's background.\n\nMeanwhile, Lenny and Amanda have been drifting apart, due to Lenny's obsession with Linda, but also Amanda's career and her affair with her colleague Jerry. Amanda tells Lenny she wants to explore her relationship with Jerry. Lenny and Linda console each other over their break-ups, and end up finally engaging in intercourse. However, the next day Lenny reconciles with Amanda, and they realize that they are still in love. Linda tries unsuccessfully to get back with Kevin but on the drive back to Manhattan, she sees a helicopter dropping out of the sky. She pulls over and gives the pilot, Don, a ride. It is revealed by the Greek chorus that they will end up married, although Linda is now pregnant with Lenny's child.\n\nAbout a year later, Linda (with her infant daughter) and Lenny (with Max) meet in a toy store. They both have each other's children but do not realize it. Linda thanks Lenny for everything he did to help her and then leaves Lenny dumbstruck. The film ends with the Greek chorus singing and dancing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Lenny Weinrib\n* [[Mira Sorvino]] as Linda Ash\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Amanda Sloan Weinrib\n* [[Michael Rapaport]] as Kevin\n* [[F.

The soundtrack includes \"Neo Minore\" performed by [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]], \"Horos Tou Sakena\" by [[Stavros Xarchakos]], \"[[I've Found a New Baby]]\" by [[Wilbur de Paris]], \"Whispering\" by [[Benny Goodman]] & His Orchestra, \"Manhattan\" by [[Carmen Cavallaro]], \"When Your Lover Has Gone\" by [[Ambrose (bandleader)|Ambrose]] & His Orchestra, \"L'il Darlin\" by [[Count Basie]] & His Orchestra, \"[[Take Five]]\" by the [[Dave Brubeck Quartet]], \"Penthouse Serenade (When We're Alone)\" and \"I Hadn't Anyone Till You\" by [[Erroll Garner]], \"The In Crowd\" by [[Ramsey Lewis]], and \"You Do Something to Me\" and \"[[When You're Smiling]]\" by the Dick Hyman Chorus & Orchestra. [[Graciela Daniele]] [[choreography|choreographed]] the dance routines.\n\nThe Greek chorus includes [[George de la Pe\u00f1a]] and [[Pamela Blair]]. [[Tony Sirico]] and [[Paul Giamatti]] make brief appearances in minor roles.\n\n[[Manhattan]] locations include [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]], [[Central Park]], and [[FAO Schwarz]]. Additional exteriors were filmed in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|North Tarrytown]] and [[Quogue]]. The Greek chorus scenes were filmed in the [[Ancient theatre of Taormina|Teatro antico]] in [[Taormina]] on the island of [[Sicily]].\n\nMira Sorvino mentioned in a 2011 interview that she chose Linda's voice to be high and gravelly since \"high voice kind of makes you sound less intellectually gifted, and the gravelly part just added this kind of rough-and-tumble, been-to-the-school-of-hard-knocks element to it.\" Four weeks into the production, Allen spoke with Sorvino asking if she had ever wondered about using a different voice. Sorvino stated that the voice affected how she approached the character, and that if she changed the voice the character changed. When she pointed out that they were four weeks into the movie Allen said, \"Oh, that doesn't matter. I have it written into my budget that I can reshoot the entire movie if I want.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/lea-thompson,69639/|title=Random Roles: Lea Thompson|first=Will|last=Harris|work=[[The A.V.
