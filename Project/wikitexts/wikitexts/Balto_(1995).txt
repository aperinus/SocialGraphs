The film stars [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Bridget Fonda]], [[Jim Cummings]], [[Phil Collins]] (in a dual role) and [[Bob Hoskins]]. Though primarily an animated film, there are [[live-action]] opening and closing sequences for the film that were shot in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]] and featured [[Miriam Margolyes]].\n\nThe film was the third and final [[animated feature]] produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s UK-based [[Amblimation]] studio before it became [[DreamWorks Animation]], which would later be acquired by Universal's parent company [[NBCUniversal]] on August 22, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nbcuniversal-buys-dreamworks--20160428-story.html|title=Comcast's NBCUniversal buys DreamWorks Animation in $3.8-billion deal|last=James|first=Meg|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=28 April 2016|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref> Although the film was a major [[Box-office bomb|financial failure]] (it was overshadowed by the success of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] and [[Pixar]]'s first computer-animated film ''[[Toy Story]]''), and received mixed reviews from critics, its subsequent sales on [[home video]] led to two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest]]'' (2002) and ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change]]'' (2005), though none of the original voice cast reprised their roles.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[New York City]], an elderly woman, her granddaughter, and the latter's [[Siberian Husky]], Blaze, are walking through [[Central Park]], looking for a [[memorial]]. As they seat themselves for a rest, the woman tells her granddaughter a story about [[Nome, Alaska]] 70 years earlier in the winter of 1925, where [[sled dog]] champion Steele, a fierce and arrogant [[Malamute]], cheats to ensure victory for his team and musher who returns first to the rural town of Nome. They almost run over Rosy's new musher hat, but [[Balto]], a young [[wolfdog]] who is distrusted by dogs and humans alike, rescues her hat and meets her [[Siberian husky]] Jenna, whom he quickly develops a crush on, before being chased away by Rosy's father due to his part-wolf heritage. Following a confrontation where Steele, Star, Nikki, and Kaltag mock his heritage, Balto and his adoptive father Boris Goosinov, a comical [[snow goose]] originally from [[Russia]], return to their home on an abandoned ship on the outskirts of Nome, where they live with two [[Aquaphobia|aquaphobic]] [[polar bears]], Muk and Luk.\n\nOne evening, all of the children in Nome (including Rosy) are hospitalized with [[diphtheria]], but Curtis Welch is out of [[antitoxin]]. Severe winter weather conditions prevent medicine from being brought from [[Juneau]] and [[Anchorage]] by air or sea, and the closest rail line ends in [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]]. A dog race is held to determine the best-fit dogs for a sled dog team to get the medicine by heading to rendezvous with the train in Nenana and transport the antitoxin back to Nome. Balto, who dreams of becoming a sled dog, enters and wins, but is disqualified after Steele exposes his wolf half. The team departs that night with Steele in the lead and picks up the medicine successfully, but on the way back, they end up in a [[blizzard]], missing their second checkpoint. When this news reaches Nome, and with the children's health getting worse, Balto sets out in search of Steele and his team with Boris, Muk and Luk supporting him.\n\nGetting desperate, Steele accidentally drags himself and his team off a cliff, stranding them at the base of an icy hill, with the musher knocked unconscious during the fall. Meanwhile, Balto, Boris, and the polar bears are stalked and attacked by a massive [[grizzly bear]]. Balto fights the bear to save the others, but is easily overpowered and almost crushed to death before Jenna, who followed their marked trail, intervenes and saves him. The bear overpowers Jenna as well before it resumes attacking Balto and chases him out onto a frozen lake, but due to its immense size and weight, the ice starts to break, causing the animal to fall through and drown. Muk and Luk overcome their aquaphobia and save Balto before he could drown as well. Warming a frozen Balto, Jenna gives him the latest news from Nome. However, she is injured after the bear fight and unable to move on. Balto instructs Boris and the polar bears to bring Jenna back to Nome, deciding to continue the search on his own.\n\nHaving fallen in love with Balto, Jenna gives him her bandanna to wear before nuzzling him good luck. He eventually finds the team, but Steele refuses his help and ferociously attacks Balto, only to fall off a cliff. Balto takes charge of the team, but Steele, refusing to lose, sabotages Balto's marks and the team loses their way again. While attempting to save the medicine from falling down a cliff, Balto himself falls. Back in Nome, Jenna is explaining Balto's mission to the other dogs when Steele, feigning sadness and remorse, returns, lying that the entire team, including Balto and his musher, is dead, using Jenna's bandanna as fake proof and lies to Jenna that Balto made him promise to look after her. Knowing that Balto would never say such a thing, Jenna sees through Steele's trickery and insists that Balto will return with the medicine. Using a trick Balto showed her earlier, she places broken colored glass bottles on the outskirts of town and shines a lantern on them to simulate the [[Aurora Borealis|Northern Lights]], hoping that it will help guide Balto home.\n\nWhen Balto regains consciousness, he is ready to give up, believing himself to have failed Rosy. When a [[polar wolf]] appears and Balto notices the medicine crate still intact nearby, he realizes, thanks to remembering Boris' advice he told him earlier, that his part-wolf heritage is a strength, not a weakness. Balto rallies his confidence, embraces his heritage and drags the medicine back up the cliff to the waiting team. Using his highly developed senses, Balto filters out the fake marks that Steele created. After escaping an avalanche and falling stalactites in an ice cave, where they lose one vial, Balto and the sled team finally make it back to Nome, alerting Jenna, who then alerts the others. Steele is exposed as a fraud and the other dogs abandon him for his betrayal in anger. Reunited with his friends, Balto earns respect from both the dogs and the humans. He visits a cured Rosy who thanks him for saving her, before he is happily reunited with Jenna who chooses him as her mate.\n\nBack in the present, the woman, her granddaughter, and Blaze finally find [[Statue of Balto|Balto's memorial]], and she explains that Alaska runs the [[Iditarod]] dog race over the same path which Balto and his team took. The woman, revealed to be an elderly Rosy, thanks Balto before walking off to join her granddaughter and Blaze, while the statue of Balto stands proudly in the sunlight.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n[[File:Kevin Bacon SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Kevin Bacon]] voices Balto]]\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as [[Balto]], a young adult brown-and-grey [[wolfdog]]; being a [[Siberian Husky]]-[[Arctic wolf]] hybrid.

Rosy makes a brief cameo in ''Balto III: Wings of Change''.\n** [[Miriam Margolyes]] as an old Rosy in the [[live-action]] sequences who narrates her story to her granddaughter at the beginning of the film.\n* [[Jack Angel]], Danny Mann and [[Robbie Rist]] as Nikki, Kaltag, and Star, respectively. The only three prominent members of Steele's team, who later abandon him for Balto.

A Dinosaur's Story (film)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]'' (1993). Voice-recording sessions took place at The Bridge Facilities in [[London]] (now folded into [[Miloco Studios]] and renamed The Bridge Writing Studio) between late 1992 and early 1993. [[Brendan Fraser]] was originally cast as Steele, because director [[Simon Wells]] had envisioned Steele as a school quarterback jock carried away by his sense of importance, and felt that Fraser fit that personality well. According to Wells, \"I liked Brendan a great deal, and we did one recording session with him that was terrific.\" However, executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] wanted a clearer sense of Steele's \"inherent evil\", so Fraser was replaced by [[Jim Cummings]]. Wells stated that Cummings \"did a fantastic job, and totally made the character live, so I don't regret the choice.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive interview with Balto director Simon Wells|url=https://www.animationsource.org/balto/en/articles/Exclusive-interview-with-Balto-director-/258868.html&id_film=10|publisher=animationsource.org|access-date=May 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter the actors recorded their voices, animating and filming commenced at [[Amblimation]] in London on March 1, 1993.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hollywood_Reporter/HGAIAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=amblimation&dq=amblimation&printsec=frontcover|title=The Hollywood Reporter|year=1995|publisher=Wilkerson Daily Corporation|access-date=May 15, 2020}}</ref> To have a source for the dogs' character animation to be based on, the filmmakers brought in about seven [[Siberian Huskies]] and videotaped them walking around in the studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animationsource.org/balto/en/comments/BBC-Two-s-The-Making-of-Balto/3792.html|title=BBC Two's 'The Making of Balto'|access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref> Although most of the film's animation was hand-drawn, the animators used [[Toonz]] to improve the graphics, and also created the [[snowstorms]] using an early CGI particle animation system. Additional animation was done by the Danish studio [[A. Film Production]]. [[James Horner]] composed the film's music, including the film's only song, \"Reach for the Light\", sung by [[Steve Winwood]], which plays over the film's [[closing credits]].\n\nThe film's live-action prologue and epilogue segments were filmed in [[Central Park]] in [[Autumn|Fall]] 1994. The role as elderly Rosy's granddaughter's husky, Blaze, was played by two light red blue-eyed Siberian Huskies.\n\n== Historical differences ==\nThe film has many historical inaccuracies:\n* The film portrays [[Balto]] (1919 \u2013 March 14, 1933) as a brown-and-gray [[wolfdog]]. In reality, Balto was a purebred [[Siberian Husky]] and was black and white in color.<ref name=\"real\">{{cite web|title=Balto - Balto's True Story|last=Aversano|first=Earl|url=http://www.baltostruestory.net/balto.htm|access-date=2014-04-06}}</ref><ref name=\"facts\">{{cite web|title=The True Story of Balto - Facts |publisher=Animation Source|url=https://www.animationsource.org/balto/en/custom/&id_film=10&nump=2044|access-date=2014-04-06}}</ref> Balto's colors changed to brown due to light exposure while on display in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltostruestory.net/balto.htm |title=Balto - Balto'S True Story |website=Baltostruestory.net |access-date=2017-03-23}}</ref>\n* Balto was never an outcast street dog as shown by the film, but was instead born in a kennel owned by the famous musher and breeder [[Leonhard Seppala]], who raised and trained him until Balto was deemed fit for being a sled dog.\n* In reality, the sled run to retrieve the medicine was actually a relay. Instead of being the leader of the first and only team, Balto was scheduled to be part of the penultimate team led by dog Fox. This team left by Seppala, while driven by [[Gunnar Kaasen]]. Although they were scheduled to hand off the serum to the final team, Kaasen decided to advance on.

Instead, Bacon was replaced by [[Maurice LaMarche]] as the voice of Balto, Hoskins was replaced by [[Charles Fleischer]] as the voice of Boris, Fonda was replaced by [[Jodi Benson]] as the voice of Jenna, and Collins was replaced by [[Kevin Schon]] as the voices of Muk and Luk. In addition, numerous supporting characters from the original (such as Steele, Nikki, Kaltag and Star) either did not return in the sequels or became background characters in them. The first sequel, ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest]],'' was released in 2002 and follows the adventures of one of Balto and Jenna's pups, Aleu, who sets off to discover her wolf heritage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Balto: Wolf Quest (Video 2002)|date=19 February 2002|publisher=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281634/?ref_=nv_sr_3|access-date=2014-04-06}}</ref> The second, ''Balto III: Wings of Change'', was released in 2005. The storyline follows the same litter of pups from ''Balto II'', but focuses on another pup, Kodi, who is a member of a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Mail]] dog sled delivery team, and is in danger of getting put out of his job by Duke, a pilot of a mail delivery [[bush plane]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Balto III: Wings of Change (Video 2004)|date=30 September 2004|publisher=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423849/?ref_=nv_sr_4|access-date=2014-04-06}}</ref> as characters from the first sequel could not be brought back owing to [[Mary Kay Bergman]]\u2019s suicide in 1999, causing ''Balto II'' to be delayed for two years.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} Unlike the original film, neither of the sequels took any historical references from the true story of [[Balto]] and contain no live action sequences.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081223063432/http://www.balto.tv/index2.html Balto: Universal Studios] \u2013 Restored version of the original 1995 official ''Balto'' site.\n* {{IMDb title|112453|Balto}}\n* [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/balto/ ''Balto''] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n* {{bcdb title|23585|Balto}}\n* {{Amg movie|135567|Balto}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170919230136/http://www.keyframeonline.com/Animation/Balto/27/ ''Balto''] \u2013 Keyframe \u2013 the Animation Resource\n\n{{Balto}}\n{{Simon Wells}}\n{{Universal Animation Studios}}\n\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1995 animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s historical adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:Amblin Entertainment animated films]]\n[[Category:American adventure films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated adventure films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dogs]]\n[[Category:American films with live action and animation]]\n[[Category:Animated films about birds]]\n[[Category:Films scored by James Horner]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Simon Wells]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1925]]\n[[Category:Animated films about wolves]]\n[[Category:Films set in Alaska]]\n[[Category:British films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Mushing films]]\n[[Category:Northern (genre) films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures animated films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:American historical adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about bears]]\n[[Category:American films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Adventure films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:Amblin Entertainment films]]\n[[Category:British adventure films]]\n[[Category:British historical adventure films]]\n[[Category:1990s British animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s British films]]"}]}}}}
