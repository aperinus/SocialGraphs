Now adults, they plan to actually rob a bank, but the robbery goes wrong and Hands flees the bank leaving Guscott trapped behind the security shutters. Hands is caught and arrested not long later.\n\nAfter being sentenced to do time in [[prison]], Hands and Guscott make a daring escape plan as the prison is scheduled to put on a theatrical show of ''Nelson: The Musical''. Hands and Guscott plan to use the show as cover their daring break-out attempt. During rehearsals, the inmates are unable to find a [[pianist]] for the show, until one inmate, Cliff Gumbell ([[Timothy Spall]]) volunteers and impresses them with his amazing piano skills. Hands is cast as Nelson (against his will) and Guscott is cast as Hardy, much to Guscott's dismay as his character kisses Nelson as he dies.\n\nThe escape plan proves difficult to proceed with, as one of the guards becomes very suspicious of Hands. Further complications arise when one of the more dangerous inmates threatens Hands to help him escape, as well as Hands warming to a prison employee named Annabel. During a prison visiting day, Gumbell is devastated to learn that his son is spending more time with his uncle, and that his wife is very disappointed being married to a criminal. Unable to live with the shame, Gumbell commits [[suicide]] in his cell.\n\nThe night of the show arrives and the escape plan is put into action. However, the dangerous inmate is tricked into going over the 30-foot prison wall and falls down the other side, where he is captured. Hands and Guscott are about to escape when Hands reveals his intentions to stay because of his feelings for Annabel. Guscott reluctantly lets Hands go and escapes with two other inmates, one of whom has a friend who arrives in a plane to help them escape.\n\nBack in the prison, one of the guards resigns from his job over frustration of the inmates escaping and becomes a car park warden. Hands is later released from prison and starts a new life with Annabel.\n\n==Cast list==\n* [[James Nesbitt]] as James 'Jimmy' Hands / Lord Nelson in Show\n* [[Olivia Williams]] as Annabel Sweep / Lady Hamilton in Show\n* [[Timothy Spall]] as Cliff Gumbell\n* [[Bill Nighy]] as Roger 'Rog' Chamberlain / King George III in Show\n* [[Lennie James]] as Rudy 'Rud' Guscott / Hardy in Show\n* [[Ron Cook]] as Mr. Perry, the Guard\n* [[Frank Harper]] as John Toombes\n* [[Raymond Waring]] as Darren\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Graham Mortimer\n* [[Julian Barratt]] as Paul Dean\n* [[Peter Wight (actor)|Peter Wight]] as Officer George Beorge Barratt\n* [[Celia Imrie]] as Amy Chamberlin\n* [[Peter McNamara]] as Ward\n* [[Andy Linden (actor)|Andy Linden]] as Kenny\n* [[Ram John Holder]] as Old Billy Morris\n\n==Production==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{expand section|date=July 2021}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2021}}\n}}\n[[Anne Dudley]] collaborated with [[Stephen Fry]] to write and produce songs for the send-up musical \"Nelson\".\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a 48% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 44 reviews with the critics consensus: \"Lucky Break fails to do anything new with The Full Monty formula\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lucky_break|title=Lucky Break|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=29 July 2021}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], it holds a 48% rating based on 22 reviews, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lucky-break|title=Lucky Break|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=29 July 2021}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Kehr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that \"Mr. Cattaneo restricts himself to the smiling blandness that has become the stock in trade of British comedies made for export, turning in a film that is forced, familiar and thoroughly condescending\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/movies/film-in-review-lucky-break.html|last=Kehr|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Kehr|title=Film Review; Lucky Break|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=5 April 2002|access-date=29 July 2021}}</ref>\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote \"Apart from the deja vu all over again, ''Lucky Break'' is no worse a film than ''[[Breaking Out]]'', and [that film] was utterly charming\".<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|title=Lucky Break|date=18 April 2002|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Derek Elley]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', the film is \"[c]hained to the floor by a script that isn't particularly funny, direction that goes for realism rather than stylization and an almost complete lack of comic timing\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Elley|first=Derek|author-link=Derek Elley|title=Lucky Break|date=14 August 2001|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0246134}}\n\n{{Peter Cattaneo}}\n\n[[Category:2000 films]]\n[[Category:British comedy films]]\n[[Category:2000 comedy films]]\n[[Category:British prison films]]\n[[Category:Film4 Productions films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Cattaneo]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Anne Dudley]]\n[[Category:2000s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s British films]]"}]}}}}
