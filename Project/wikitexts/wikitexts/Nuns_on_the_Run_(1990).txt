The film was written and directed by [[Jonathan Lynn]] and produced by [[HandMade Films]]. Many of the outdoor scenes were shot in [[Chiswick]], [[White City, London|White City]] and [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]]. The soundtrack was composed and performed by [[Yello]] and also features [[George Harrison]]'s song \"[[Blow Away]]\" in addition to [[Steve Winwood]]'s \"[[Roll with It (Steve Winwood song)|Roll With It]]\". The film was released on 16 March 1990.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter their boss is killed during a bank robbery, London gangsters Brian Hope (Idle) and Charlie McManus (Coltrane) desire to lead more peaceful lives in Brazil, disapproving of their new younger and more brash boss, Casey (Patterson). While planning to rob a local Triad gang of their ill-gotten drug money, Brian meets and falls in love with a waitress, Faith (Coduri). During the robbery, Brian and Charlie betray their fellow gangsters, Abbott and Morley, steal the money and flee, but are forced to abandon their car when it runs out of petrol and seek refuge in a nearby nunnery during the ensuing gunfight. Faith, who had tried to warn Brian beforehand, is shot in the wrist by Abbott, while one of the triads is shot and hospitalised. After this, Casey places a bounty on Brian and Charlie's heads.\n\nDisguising themselves as nuns, Brian and Charlie introduce themselves to the Sister Superior, Liz, as Sisters Inviolata and Euphemia, respectively. Faith, having witnessed the gunfight and Brian and Charlie fleeing into the nunnery, follows them and poses as a mature student to get inside. Her gunshot wound is exposed and she is taken to the infirmary. Brian pays her a secret visit and claims he is married in order to end their relationship for her safety. When Faith intends to go to church and confess, Charlie distracts the priest, Father Seamus, while Brian poses as him. Faith admits she still loves Brian, but Brian convinces Faith to keep silent. On her way out, she is abducted by the Triads and interrogated. She directs them to Casey and they set her free, but bumps into a lamppost and hits her head on the road, ending up in the hospital, where one Triad has infiltrated the staff as a cleaner. Brian and Charlie acquire tickets to Brazil, despite Brian's desire to take Faith with them.\n\nBrian decides to tell Faith the truth, but discovers she has not returned to the nunnery. They go to her flat and only barely escape from Abbott and Morley, who had been sent to retrieve her by Casey. They sneak back into the nunnery and manage to slip into their spare habits after accidentally waking up an eccentric nun, Sister Mary. In conversation, Brian learns that Faith is in the hospital, with her father and brother who are protecting her from the gang. He visits her, but she is heartbroken, believing that Brian no longer loves her. They wake up and leave for the airport the next morning, but are caught and exposed by Sister Mary. In desperation, they steal a utility and drive to the airport pursued by Sisters Liz and Mary, Morley and Abbott, and eventually Casey and the Triads. Brian forces Charlie to go to the hospital, where Brian tells Faith the truth while Charlie stalls the gangsters. They manage to escape the hospital with Faith and Casey is arrested, though one briefcase of money is lost during the chase. Sister Liz and Sister Mary find the lost briefcase and, ignoring the police concerns, decide to use it to fund a drug rehabilitation clinic. Sister Liz then leads the nuns in prayer, thanking God for sending them Sisters Euphemia and Inviolata, and asking him to, \"keep on eye on them, won't you? They need you.\"\n\nBrian, Charlie and Faith reach the airport and check-in, when an airport policeman warns the attendant about Brian and Charlie. They board the flight on board a [[British Airways]] Boeing 747-200 jumbo jet, disguised as attendants and successfully escape the UK for Brazil.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eric Idle]] as Brian Hope/Sister Euphemia of the Five Wounds\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as Charlie McManus/Sister Inviolata of the Immaculate Conception\n* [[Janet Suzman]] as Sister Liz, the Sister Superior of the nunnery\n* [[Camille Coduri]] as Faith Thomas\n* Robert Patterson as Mr. \"Case\" Casey\n* [[Doris Hare]] as Sister Mary of the Sacred Heart\n* [[Lila Kaye]] as Sister Mary of the Annunciation\n* [[Tom Hickey (actor)|Tom Hickey]] as Father Seamus, the somewhat lecherous priest of the nunnery\n* [[Colin Campbell (actor)|Colin Campbell]] as Norm\n* Robert Morgan as Abbott, one of Casey's henchmen\n* Winston Dennis as Morley, one of Casey's henchmen and the bouncer of his health club\n* Gary Tang as Ronnie Chang, the head of the Triads\n* David Forman as Henry Ho\n* [[Ozzie Yue]] as Ernie Wong, the most senior of the Triads\n\nAs an [[in-joke]], Brian Hope and Charlie McManus are credited as playing the flight attendants.\n\n==Production==\nFilming of the convent exterior took place at St. Michael & All Angels Church on Priory Avenue, Chiswick, West London.
