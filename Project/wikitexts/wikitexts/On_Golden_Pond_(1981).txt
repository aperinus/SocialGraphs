It stars [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Henry Fonda]] (in his final theatrical film), [[Jane Fonda]], [[Doug McKeon]], [[Dabney Coleman]] and [[William Lanteau]]. In the film, Norman (Henry Fonda) is a curmudgeon with an estranged relationship with his daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda). At Golden Pond, he and his wife nevertheless agree to care for Billy, the son of Chelsea's new boyfriend, and a most unexpected relationship blooms.\n\n''On Golden Pond'' was theatrically released on December 4, 1981 to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Rydell's direction, Thompson's screenplay and the performances of the cast, while the film grossed $119.3 million domestically, becoming the [[1981 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1981 in North America]]. It received ten nominations at the [[54th Academy Awards]], including for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and won three: [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Henry Fonda), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Hepburn), and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nAn aging couple, Ethel and Norman Thayer, continue a tradition of spending each summer at their cottage on a lake called Golden Pond, in the far reaches of northern [[New England]]. When they first arrive, Ethel notices the [[loon]]s calling on the lake \"welcoming them home\"; Norman, however, claims he does not hear anything. \n\nAs they resettle into their summer home, Norman, who is about to turn 80, has [[dementia|memory problems]] arise when he is unable to recognize several family photographs, which he copes with by frequently talking about death and growing old. Ethel does her best to liven up the atmosphere \u2013 they play [[Parcheesi]], admire the natural scenery, and talk to the mailman, Charlie, who delivers mail and visits via boat.\n\nThey are visited by their only child, daughter Chelsea, who is somewhat estranged from her curmudgeon of a father. She introduces her parents to her fianc\u00e9 Bill and his 13-year-old son Billy. Norman tries to play mind games with Bill, an apparent pastime of his. Bill lets him know that he knows what Norman is doing and he doesn't really mind, but that he will only take so much of it. \n\nIn another conversation, Chelsea discusses with Ethel her frustration over her relationship with her father, feeling that even though she lives thousands of miles away in [[Los Angeles]], she still feels like she is answering to him. \n\nBefore they depart for a European vacation, Chelsea and Bill ask the Thayers to allow Billy to stay with them for a month while they have some time to themselves. Norman, seeming more senile and cynical than usual due to his 80th birthday and heart palpitations, agrees to Billy's staying.\n\nBilly is at first annoyed by being left with elderly strangers with no friends nearby and nothing to do. He resents Norman's brusque manner, but eventually comes to enjoy their Golden Pond fishing adventures together. Billy also begins to enjoy reading books in the cottage, first reading ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and later ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''. \n\nBilly and Norman soon grow obsessed with catching Norman's fish rival \"Walter\", which leads to the accidental destruction of the Thayers' motorboat in a rocky area called Purgatory Cove. Norman gets thrown overboard and suffers a head wound and Billy dives in the water to save the old man. They are later rescued by Ethel and Charlie. \n\nOnce healed, Norman goes fishing with Billy and they finally catch \"Walter\" but they eventually release the fish. Chelsea returns to find out her father has made friends with her fianc\u00e9's\u2014now husband's\u2014son. When she sees the change in her father's demeanor, Chelsea attempts something Billy accomplished that she never could: a backflip. She successfully executes the dive in front of a cheering Norman, Billy, and Ethel. Chelsea and Norman finally fully embrace before she departs with Billy.\n\nThe final day on Golden Pond comes and the Thayers are loading the last of the boxes. Norman tries to move a heavy box, but starts having heart pain and collapses onto the floor of the porch. Ethel tries unsuccessfully to get the operator to phone the hospital, and goes to comfort her husband. \n\nAfter being given [[nitroglycerin (medication)|nitroglycerin]] by Ethel, Norman says the pain is gone and attempts to stand to say a final farewell to the lake. Ethel helps Norman to the edge, where they see the loons and Norman says they are calling on the lake \"saying goodbye\". He notes how they are just like him and Ethel, that their offspring is grown and gone off on her own, and now it is just the two of them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Katharine Hepburn]] as Ethel Thayer \n* [[Henry Fonda]] as Norman Thayer Jr. \n* [[Jane Fonda]] as Chelsea Thayer Wayne \n* [[Doug McKeon]] as Billy Ray Jr.\n* [[Dabney Coleman]] as Dr. Bill Ray\n* [[William Lanteau]] as Charlie Martin\n* [[Christopher Rydell]] as Sumner Todd (as Chris Rydell)\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Jane Fonda Cannes 2015.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Jane Fonda]] purchased the rights to the play specifically for her father, [[Henry Fonda]], to play the role of Norman Thayer.]]\n\n[[Jane Fonda]] purchased the rights to the play specifically for her father, [[Henry Fonda]], to play the role of the cantankerous Norman Thayer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Barbarella-comes-of-age/2005/05/12/1115843302558.html |title=Barbarella comes of age | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131212808/http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Barbarella-comes-of-age/2005/05/12/1115843302558.html |archive-date=2008-01-31 |website=[[The Age]] |date=May 14, 2005 | access-date=January 9, 2008 | quote=If Barbarella was an act of rebellion, On Golden Pond (1981) was a more mature rapprochement: Fonda bought the rights to Ernest Thompson's play to offer the role to her father}}</ref> The father-daughter rift depicted on screen closely paralleled the real-life relationship between the two Fondas.

After the shoot, the production company was contractually obligated to return the house to its original state but the owner liked the renovations so much that he elected to keep the house that way and asked the crew not to dismantle the second story. A gazebo and a small boathouse were also relocated during the shoot.\n\nThe Thayer IV was the name of the boat used in the film. There were three Thayer IV's used in the movie, including one replica used for the crash scene. One was a 1950 Chris-Craft Sportsman (U22-1460), bought by a family in 1982 from marine coordinator Pat Curtin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://woodyboats.blogspot.com/2010/11/rumored-3rd-thayer-iv-barn-find-of.html |title=The Rumored 3rd Thayer IV..

At the same time, the buyer of U22-1802 also purchased the replica used in the crash scene.<ref>Laconia Evening Citizen 8/4/1983</ref><ref>The Brass Bell \u2013 Official Publication of the Antique Boat Club serving the interests of owners of Chris Craft and other antique and classic boats.

Summer 2010</ref> Although the Chris-Craft Sportsman was the main boat used in the movie, the script called for the Thayer IV, a [[mail boat]], a canoe, and a replica of the Thayer IV. These were provided by Patrick Curtin of Eastern Classics, a boatyard in [[Laconia, New Hampshire]], specializing in the restoration of [[mahogany]] speedboats.<ref>New Hampshire Business Review.  May, 1982.</ref> Following [[World War II]], the Sportsman model reappeared as a direct descendant of its 1937 predecessors. The popular model stayed in the Chris Craft line up until 1960. The use of a 1950 Sportsman model as the Thayer IV in ''On Golden Pond'' did much to generate interest in antique and classic boats.<ref>The Brass Bell. July, 1985.</ref>\n\nDespite their many common acquaintances and long careers in show business, Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn had not only never worked together, but never met until working on the film. On the first day of shooting, Hepburn presented Fonda with her longtime companion [[Spencer Tracy]]'s \"lucky\" hat, which Fonda wore in the film. Hepburn, who was 74 at the time of filming, performed all her own stunts, including a dive into the pond. The scene in which Norman and step-grandson Billy run their boat into the rocks was filmed repeatedly. The vintage 1951 mahogany [[Chris-Craft Industries|Chris-Craft]] boat, used strictly for the crash scene, was so sturdy that it kept bouncing off the rocks without any damage.<ref>The Brass Bell \u2013 Official Publication of the Antique Boat Club serving the interests of owners of Chris Craft and other antique and classic boats.

May 1982.</ref> The crew had to modify the boat so it would break away in the wreck. The water level in Squam Lake was so low during the summer of production that Fonda and Doug McKeon could have stood during the scene in which they were supposedly clinging to the rocks for fear of drowning. The September water was barely knee-deep, but it was cold enough that the pair had to wear wetsuits under their clothes. Hepburn, on the other hand, dove into the water without the aid of the wetsuit because she wanted the scene to keep its authenticity. Some of the scenes in which Billy takes the boat out on his own were filmed on nearby [[Lake Winnipesaukee]]. While filming the scene where Fonda and Hepburn were watching the [[Common loon|loons]] on the lake, the speedboat that zoomed by and disturbed them was so forceful it overturned their canoe in one take. Fonda was immediately taken out of the water and wrapped up in blankets as his health was fragile by then.\n\nThe town of Holderness offers boat tours of Squam Lake and the filming locations from the movie. There is also a restaurant called \"Walter's Basin\", which is named after the trout called \"Walter\" that Billy catches with Norman. For filming, \"Walter\" was brought in from a trout pond at the nearby [[Castle in the Clouds]] estate. He was released after his capture back into Squam Lake. Leftover footage of Fonda and Hepburn driving through the New Hampshire countryside, as seen in the opening credits, was later used for the opening of the [[CBS]] television sitcom ''[[Newhart]]''.\n\nThe [[Film studio|studio]] behind the film was [[ITC Entertainment]], the British company presided over (until late 1981) by [[Lew Grade, Baron Grade|Lord Grade]], the television and film [[Media mogul|mogul]]. It was Grade who largely raised the financing for the film.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nWith a box office take of $119,285,432, ''On Golden Pond'' was the [[1981 in film|second-highest-grossing film of the year]], following ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which earned $209,562,121.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm |title=On Golden Pond | website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=2020-04-28 |archive-date=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101033125/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n|align = right\n|total_width = 300\n|image1 = Henry Fonda in Warlock.jpg\n|width1 = 380\n|height1 = 500\n|image2 = Katharine Hepburn promo pic.jpg\n|width2 = 431\n|height2 = 500\n|footer = [[Henry Fonda]] (pictured in 1959) and [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s (pictured in 1941) performances garnered critical acclaim and won them the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] respectively.\n}}\n\n''On Golden Pond'' received critical acclaim with critics highlighting the screenplay and performances of the cast (particularly of Hepburn and Henry Fonda).

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn are a wondrous duo in ''On Golden Pond'', a wistful drama that movingly explores the twilight years of a loving marriage.\"\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said: {{cquote|''On Golden Pond'' was a treasure for many reasons, but the best one, I think, is that I could believe it. I could believe in its major characters and their relationships, and in the things they felt for one another, and there were moments when the movie was witness to human growth and change.
