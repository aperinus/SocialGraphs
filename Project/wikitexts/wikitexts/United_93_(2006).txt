Among the passengers are [[Tom Burnett]], [[Todd Beamer]], [[Jeremy Glick]],  Richard Guadagno, Louis J. Nacke II, [[Lauren Grandcolas]] and [[Mark Bingham]] who is the last passenger to board, barely making the flight. United 93 becomes delayed due to airport traffic. [[Air traffic controllers]] lose contact with [[American Airlines Flight 11]] which diverts toward [[New York City]] and realise it has been hijacked after hearing suspicious transmissions. Shortly after United 93 takes off after its slight delay, Flight 11 crashes into the [[1 World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], and [[United Airlines Flight 175]] is also hijacked and heads toward New York City. Air traffic controllers learn that [[American Airlines Flight 77]] has also been hijacked and watch in horror as United 175 crashes into the [[2 World Trade Center#Original building (1973\u20132001)|South Tower]].\n\nAs the passengers are served breakfast on United 93, Jarrah hesitates to start the hijacking. Via an [[Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System|ACARS]] message, Dahl and Homer are notified of the WTC attacks and to beware cockpit intrusion. After Nami unsuccessfully urges Jarrah to attack, an impatient Haznawi prepares an artificial bomb in the lavatory. Ghamdi grabs [[flight attendant]] Deborah Welsh at knife point and passenger Mark Rothenberg is mortally wounded by Haznawi. As Haznawi and Nami force the passengers to the back of the plane, Ghamdi kills both pilots, despite sending out a [[mayday]] call, and Welsh, as Jarrah begins piloting the aircraft, and redirects it towards [[Washington, D.C.]], with the intention to crash it into the [[United States Capitol]]. Grandcolas (an [[emergency medical technician]]) tries to help the dying Rothenberg but Nami berates her. The hijackers jubilantly react to the success of the WTC attack. While flight attendants Sandra Bradshaw and CeeCee Lyles unsuccessfully attempt to revive Rothenberg, Bradshaw sees the hijackers moving the bodies of the pilots and Welsh and the passengers overhear this.\n\nAfter Flight 77 crashes into [[The Pentagon]], [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] National Operations Manager [[Ben Sliney]] decides to shut down all United States air space and ground all flights. Passengers on United 93 learn of the other attacks from family members via airphone. Realising the hijackers have no intention of landing, Burnett, Bingham, Beamer, Glick (a former judo champion), Guadagno and Nacke form a plan to retake the plane, with assistance from flight staff, arming themselves with weapons, and learn passenger Donald Greene is a licensed pilot and passenger Andrew Garcia is a former air traffic controller. As the group gather, Haznawi and Nami anxiously realise they are losing control and Jarrah and Ghamdi become agitated, as they are twenty minutes away from D.C. and are unable to speed up to reach their target. Passenger Christian Adams, attempting to counsel appeasement, is restrained by some of the passengers, while other passengers pray and make final calls to loved ones.\n\nAfter Beamer urges the group to take action, the passengers charge a stunned Haznawi, tackle him and beat him. As Nami, Ghamdi and Jarrah panic, Bingham defeats Haznawi by bashing his skull in with a [[fire extinguisher]] and Nacke declares the bomb a fake. As Grandcolas, passengers William Cashman, Patrick Driscoll and Alan Beaven join the assault, Jarrah violently rocks the plane to disrupt the assault and Nami tries to hold them off with a [[Food trolley|serving cart]], [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] and his own fire extinguisher. He too is subdued, and Glick gouges his eyes out before snapping his neck. As the group move Greene and Garcia though first-class, the passengers reach the cockpit door. Jarrah and Ghamdi are disheartened by the realisation that they will never reach their target, and debate on whether to crash the plane rather than cede control. The passengers breach the cockpit with the cart just as Jarrah puts the plane into a steep dive, reciting the [[takbir]]. Ghamdi tries to protect Jarrah, but the passengers overpower him and wrestle Jarrah for control. The aircraft inverts and crashes into a [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania|Shanksville]] field, killing everyone aboard.\n\nThe film ends with a series of title cards explaining that of the four airliners hijacked on September 11, 2001, United 93 was the only one that did not reach its intended target. This is followed by a dedication to all who lost their lives in the attacks.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christian Clemenson]] as [[Tom Burnett]]\n* [[Cheyenne Jackson]] as [[Mark Bingham]]\n* [[David Alan Basche]] as [[Todd Beamer]]\n* [[Peter Hermann (actor)|Peter Hermann]] as [[Jeremy Glick]]\n* [[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]] as Louis J.

Passengers were portrayed in the film mostly by professional but relatively unknown actors. ([[Tom Burnett]], for instance, is played by [[Christian Clemenson]], who has since appeared on ''[[Boston Legal]]'' and ''[[CSI: Miami]]''). Additionally, several participants in the real-life events portray themselves in the film, including [[Thomas Roberts (television journalist)|Thomas Roberts]], Tobin Miller, Rich Sullivan, Tony Smith, James Fox, Shawna Fox, Jeremy Powell, Curt Applegate, Greg Callahan, Rick Tepper, and notably [[FAA]] operations manager [[Ben Sliney]]. Sliney was initially involved in the film in an advisory role. He was then cast in a small role as an [[air traffic controller]]. Later, Greengrass offered him the opportunity to play himself, which he accepted.<ref>Germain, David. (2006, April 29).
