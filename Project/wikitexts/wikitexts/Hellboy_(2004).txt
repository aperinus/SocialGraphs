It is based on the [[Dark Horse Comics]] graphic novel ''[[Hellboy: Seed of Destruction]]'' by [[Mike Mignola]]. [[Ron Perlman]] stars as [[Hellboy]], alongside [[Selma Blair]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Karel Roden]], [[Rupert Evans]], and [[John Hurt]] in supporting roles. In the film, a demonic beast-turned superhero known as [[Hellboy]] secretly works to keep the world safe from paranormal threats with his team, the [[Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense]].\n\n''Hellboy'' was theatrically released on April 2, 2004 to positive reviews and grossed $99.8 million worldwide against a budget of $60\u201366 million. The film was followed by a sequel, ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'', released on July 11, 2008 by [[Universal Pictures]], and a [[Hellboy (2019 film)|reboot]], released on April 12, 2019 by [[Lionsgate]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1944, with the help of Russian mystic [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]], the Nazis build a dimensional portal off the coast of [[Scotland]] and intend to free the [[Ogdru Jahad]] to aid them in defeating the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. Rasputin opens the portal with the aid of his disciples, Ilsa von Haupstein and [[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]] [[Karl Ruprecht Kroenen]]. An Allied team destroys the portal, guided by a young scientist named [[Trevor Bruttenholm]] (colloquially known as \"Broom\"). The German team is killed and the portal is destroyed, in the process absorbing Rasputin, while Haupstein and Kroenen escape. The Allied team discovers that an infant demon with a right hand of stone has come through the portal; they dub him \"[[Hellboy]]\" and Bruttenholm adopts him.\n\n60 years later, the [[eternal youth|eternally youthful]] Kroenen and Haupstein resurrect Rasputin. FBI agent John Myers is transferred to the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense]] (BPRD) at the request of Bruttenholm, where he meets the adult Hellboy and a psychic, amphibious humanoid named [[Abe Sapien]]. Hellboy is sent to investigate an incident at a Museum and battles a creature named [[Samael]]. After defeating it, Hellboy visits former BPRD member [[Liz Sherman]] at a mental hospital that she committed herself to due to her unstable pyrokinetic abilities. Abe learns that Samael was resurrected by Rasputin, who has imbued Samael with the power to reincarnate and split his essence, causing two of the creature's eggs to hatch and mature each time one dies. Abe also learns that Bruttenholm is dying.\n\nConcluding the eggs are in the sewer, Hellboy, Abe and several FBI agents go down to destroy them. Abe is injured while looking for the eggs, while Kroenen kills most of the agents. Kroenen, whose mutilated body is run by mechanical parts, shuts himself down, pretending to be defeated, and is brought to the bureau. FBI Director [[Tom Manning (comics)|Tom Manning]] is angered by Hellboy's recklessness. Myers takes Liz out for coffee and to talk. Hellboy, jealous, covertly follows them, leaving the bureau unguarded. Kroenen reanimates himself and Rasputin appears at the bureau, confronting Bruttenholm. Rasputin offers him a vision of the future, showing Hellboy is the agent that will destroy the world. However, Bruttenholm tells Rasputin he will always see Hellboy as his son. Rasputin, respecting Bruttenholm for raising Hellboy, directs a quick execution by Kroenen. Bruttenholm dies holding a [[rosary]].\n\nManning takes over the BPRD and locates Rasputin's mausoleum in an old cemetery outside [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. A team led by Manning and Hellboy enters the mausoleum, but swiftly becomes separated. Hellboy and Manning find their way to Kroenen's lair and kill him. Hellboy reunites with Liz and Myers at Samael's new nest, but the creatures overwhelm them. Liz uses her pyrokinetic powers to incinerate the creatures and their eggs. Hellboy, Liz and Myers lose consciousness and are captured by Rasputin and Haupstein. Rasputin sucks Liz's soul out of her body, then tells Hellboy to release the Ogdru Jahad in return for her soul. Hellboy awakens his true power as Anung un Rama, causing his horns to regrow, and begins to release the Ogdru Jahad. Myers breaks out of his restraints, subdues Haupstein, and reminds Hellboy that he can defy his destiny, throwing him Bruttenholm's rosary. Remembering his true self and what Bruttenholm brought him up to be, Hellboy breaks off his horns, reseals the Ogdru Jahad and defeats Rasputin by stabbing him with one of his broken-off horns.\n\nHowever, Rasputin has burst, the [[Behemoth]], a spawn of the Ogdru Jahad, out of his body, grows to enormous size, and destroys him and Haupstein. Hellboy allows himself to be swallowed by the beast, then detonates a belt of [[hand grenade]]s and destroys it from the inside. He whispers something in Liz's ear and she is revived. When she asks how her soul was returned, Hellboy replies that he said \"Hey, you on the other side, let her go, because for... for her I'll cross over, and then you'll be sorry.\" Liz and Hellboy share a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ron Perlman]] as [[Hellboy]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Trevor Bruttenholm]]\n** [[Kevin Trainor]] as Young Trevor Bruttenholm\n* [[Selma Blair]] as [[Liz Sherman]]\n** Millie Wilkie as Young Liz Sherman\n* [[Rupert Evans]] as John \"Johnny\" Myers\n* [[Karel Roden]] as [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]]\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as [[Tom Manning (comics)|Tom Manning]]\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as [[Abe Sapien]]\n** [[David Hyde Pierce]] as the voice of Abe Sapien {{small|(uncredited)}}\n* [[Brian Steele]] as [[Samael]]\n* [[Ladislav Beran]] as [[Karl Ruprecht Kroenen]]\n* [[Bridget Hodson]] as [[Ilsa Haupstein]]\n* [[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]] as Agent Clay\n* Brian Caspe as Agent Lime\n* James Babson as Agent Moss\n* Stephen Fisher as Agent Quarry\n* [[William Hoyland]] as General Klaus Von Krupt\n* [[Angus MacInnes]] as Sergeant Whitman\n* [[Jim Howick]] as Corporal Matlin\n}}\n\n==Production==\n{{quote box|quote=\"The movie becomes a story of two fathers with a single son.

Del Toro felt that labyrinths represent the film's themes regarding \"choices and taking different turns and choosing different destinies,\" Del Toro stated, \"A labyrinth, it is said, is not a place to be lost, but a place to find yourself.\"{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=13:37}} Del Toro chose to add context to the BPRD logo by rooting the film's version in Catholic mythology by adding archangels in Broom's office.{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=21:27}} Del Toro wrote Hellboy's dialogue with Perlman in mind for the role, prior to casting him.{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=33:35}} Del Toro noted that he tried to emulate [[Jack Kirby]] and Harryhausen's action style for the film's action scenes.{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=38:57}}{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=01:01:05}}\n\nHellboy's gun was given the name \"Samaritan\" for the film to illustrate the BPRD's techno-magic.{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=51:34}} Del Toro approached the love story with a reverse Beauty and the Beast approach, stating, \"I wanted the beauty to turn into a beast in the end to fully assume her mortal gifts... and when she accepts herself for what she is, a monster, then she can love the monster [Hellboy].\"{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=01:16:26}} The idea of Hellboy spying on Liz and Myers was originally written for a separate script titled ''Meat Market, A Love Story''.{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=01:18:58}} While Broom's death happened early in the comics, Del Toro wished to delay it to have audiences become attached to the character and \"make it painful to lose that character.\"{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=01:26:21}}\n\n===Pre-production===\nAside from working with Perlman before, Del Toro chose him for the title role because he felt Perlman could deliver subtlety and nuance with makeup.{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=33:42}} Del Toro assigned his real life friend, Santiago Segura, to play the train driver who assaults Hellboy.{{sfn|Del Toro|2019|loc=37:11}} [[David Hyde Pierce]] was hired to provide the voice for Abe Sapien due to Pierce being a \"bigger name\" and having a \"more recognizable sound\".
