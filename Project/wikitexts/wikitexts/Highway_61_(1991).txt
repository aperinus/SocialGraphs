The film is an unofficial sequel to his 1989 film ''[[Roadkill (1989 film)|Roadkill]]''; although focusing on different characters, it centres on a [[road trip]] beginning in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], where the road trip depicted in the earlier film ended.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film stars [[Don McKellar]] as Pokey Jones, an orphaned barber in a small town near Thunder Bay, who dreams of becoming a [[jazz]] musician. One morning, Jones discovers a frozen [[Dead body|corpse]] (Steve Fall) in his backyard, and soon meets Jackie Bangs ([[Valerie Buhagiar]]), a tough and mysterious roadie who claims the dead man is her brother.\n\nJackie's real intention is to use the body, a vagrant unknown to anyone in town, to smuggle stolen drugs into the United States. She convinces Pokey to use his parents' car, which has not been driven in decades, to drive her to New Orleans to bury her brother. So Jackie and Pokey set out along [[Highway 61 (Ontario)|Highway 61]], coffin strapped to the top of the car, and follow [[Bob Dylan]]'s famous [[U.S. Highway 61]] south through the heart of the United States. They are pursued by Mr. Skin ([[Earl Pastko]]), who believes he is [[Satan]] and wants to claim the body because the dead man sold Mr. Skin his soul.\n\n[[Peter Breck]] is fourth-billed as Mr. Watson, the \"stage-mom\" father of three girls: Mississippi (Missy), Minnesota (Minnie), and Louisiana (Louise). The film also includes cameo appearances by [[Tav Falco]], [[Jello Biafra]], and [[Art Bergmann]].\n\nThe film's [[Highway 61 (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] album includes songs by [[Bourbon Tabernacle Choir]], [[Rita Chiarelli]], [[Nash the Slash]], [[Acid Test (band)|Acid Test]], [[Jellyfishbabies]], and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]. Nash the Slash also composed the film's instrumental score.\n\nIn 2001, ''[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]]'' named ''Highway 61'' the 15th best Canadian film since 1986.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} McDonald won \"Best Director\" honours at both [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival]] and [[Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film]].\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0102035}}\n* {{rottentomatoes|highway_61}}\n\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:1991 comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy road movies]]\n[[Category:Canadian comedy road movies]]\n[[Category:1990s chase films]]\n[[Category:English-language Canadian films]]\n[[Category:Films about automobiles]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bruce McDonald]]\n[[Category:Films set in Northern Ontario]]\n[[Category:1990s English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s Canadian films]]"}]}}}}
