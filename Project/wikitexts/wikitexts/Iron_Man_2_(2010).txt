Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is the sequel to ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the third film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] and written by [[Justin Theroux]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Six months after ''Iron Man'', Tony Stark resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist [[Ivan Vanko (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ivan Vanko]] (Rourke) uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family.\n\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of ''Iron Man'' in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from ''Iron Man'', while Cheadle was brought in to replace [[Terrence Howard]] in the role of [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]]. In the early months of 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast. Filming took place from April to July 2009, mostly in [[California]] as in the first film, except for a key sequence in [[Monaco]]. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical effects, the sequel primarily relied on [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the Iron Man suits.\n\n''Iron Man 2'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics with praise for its action sequences and performances, although they deemed it to be inferior to the first film. The sequel grossed over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010]]. It received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A sequel, ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', was released on May 3, 2013.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Ivan Vanko (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father [[Anton Vanko (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Anton Vanko]]\u2014a former [[Stark Industries (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stark Industries]] employee\u2014has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" />}} Stark has become a media superstar and resists pressure to turn over his armored suits to the government. To continue the legacy of his father [[Howard Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Howard]], he re-institutes the Stark Expo in New York City's [[Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park]].\n\nStark learns that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his assistant [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]] as CEO of Stark Industries and hires Stark employee [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natalie Rushman]] to replace her as his assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains that he intended to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. \n\nImpressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark, though Vanko decides that unmanned drones are a better idea. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force.\n\n[[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing that \"Rushman\" is agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was the S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Stark invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. Tony discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo; it proves to be a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns that Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.\n\nAt the current Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor. Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, but Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer soon gets arrested for breaking Vanko out of prison, while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of Rhodes' armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits [[suicide]] by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.{{refn|name=Thor|group=N|As depicted in ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011).}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 150\n| footer = Downey, Johansson and Rockwell promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International\n| image1 = Robert Downey Jr SDCC 2009 3.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Scarlett Johansson SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Sam Rockwell SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| align = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />A billionaire who escaped captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with a suit of armor he created, he now struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands.

After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including [[Mark Millar]], Stane became the main villain in ''Iron Man''. Millar argued that the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical.<ref name=\"MarkMillar\" /> Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in ''[[Star Wars]]'' you had the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but [[Darth Vader]] is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' happen in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. You just can't do it.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarWars\" /> Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.<ref name=\"chat\" />\n\nDuring development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be \"the '[[Demon in a Bottle]]' version\".<ref name=\"chat\" /> While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend.<ref name=\"black\" /> Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the \"interim space\" between the origin and the \"Demon\" story arc.<ref name=\"et\" /> [[Shane Black]] gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], who became depressed with being \"the destroyer of worlds\" after working on the [[Manhattan Project]].<ref name=\"black\" /> An early version for the film's story involved [[Justin Hammer]] creating different villains in addition to [[Whiplash (Marvel Comics)|Whiplash]], like [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]], but the idea was discarded.

Promises aren't kept, and good-faith negotiations aren't always held up.\"<ref name=\"HowardInterview\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated Favreau did not enjoy working with Howard, often re-shooting and cutting his scenes; Howard's publicist said he had a good experience playing the part, while Marvel chose not to comment. As Favreau and Theroux chose to reduce the role, Marvel came to Howard to discuss lowering his salary\u2014Howard was the first actor hired in ''Iron Man'' and was paid the largest salary. The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard's representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating.<ref name=\"EWHoward\" /> Theroux denied the part of the report which claimed the size of the role had fluctuated.<ref name=\"TherouxNov2008\" /> In November 2013, Howard stated that, going into the film, the studio offered him far less than was in his three-picture contract, claiming they told him the second will be successful, \"with or without you,\" and, without mentioning him by name, said Downey \"took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out.\"<ref name=\"HowardInterview2\" />\n\nIn January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered negotiations to play a pair of villains.<ref name=\"RourkeRockwell\" /> A few days later, Rockwell confirmed he would take the role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer.<ref name=\"RockwellAccepts\" /> Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S.<ref name=\"BettanyJARVIS\" /> Marvel entered into early talks with [[Emily Blunt]] to play the Black Widow,<ref name=\"BluntWidow\" /> though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name=\"BluntOut\" /> Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson stated, \"There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury.\"<ref name=\"SLJJanuaryDispute\" />\n\nIn February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films.<ref name=\"SLJSignsOn\" /> Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a roundtable discussion with [[David Ansen]] at the [[66th Golden Globe Awards|2009 Golden Globes]], and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out because of Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March, Rourke signed on.<ref name=\"RourkeCast\" /> Later that same day, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow.

Snow described the process of digitally creating the suits:\n{{Blockquote|text=On the first ''Iron Man'', we tried to use the Legacy [Studios, [[Stan Winston]]'s effects company] and Stan Winston suits as much as we could. For the second one, Jon [Favreau] was confident we could create the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] suits, and the action dictated using them. So, Legacy created what we called the \"football suits\" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene. But in the rest of the film, we used the CG suit entirely. And [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] did an all-digital suit for the Monaco chase.<ref name=\"ILMBenSnow\"/>}}\n\nILM created 527 shots for the film, using programs such as [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]].<ref name=\"Autodesk\"/> Perception worked on over 125 shots for the film.<ref name=\"PerceptionNYC\"/> They crafted gadgets, such as Tony Stark's transparent [[LG Corp|LG]] [[smartphone]],<ref name=\"IM2Gadgets\"/> and created the backdrops for the Stark Expo as well as the computer screen interfaces on the touch-screen coffee table and the holographic lab environment.<ref name=\"PerceptionNYC\"/> In total, 11 visual effect studios worked on the film.<ref name=\"JanekSirrs\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Further|Iron Man 2 (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nA soundtrack album featuring [[AC/DC]] was released by [[Columbia Records]] on April 19, 2010,<ref name=\"ACDC\" /> in at least three different versions: basic, special and deluxe.
