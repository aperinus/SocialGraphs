Its screenplay is based on a classic Chinese story \"[[Xian\u00fc (short story)|Xian\u00fc]]\" in the book ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]'' by [[Pu Songling]]. The film is set in the [[Ming dynasty]] under the dominance of [[eunuch]]s and narrates multiple themes of transcendence of [[dichotomy|dichotomies]], [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]], feminism, conservative female roles, and the ghost story. At the [[1975 Cannes Film Festival]], the film won the Technical Grand Prize award.\n\nThe film was produced in Taiwan and funded by the Union Film Company. Because the director Hu was a filmmaker in the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] before moving to Taiwan, the emergence of the film established the international visibility of the [[Hong Kong New Wave]]. Although filming began in 1968, ''A Touch of Zen'' was not completed until 1971. The original Taiwanese release was in two parts in 1970 and 1971 (filming was still ongoing when the first part was released) with the bamboo forest sequence that concludes Part 1 reprised at the beginning of Part 2; this version has a combined run time of 200 minutes. In November 1971, both parts of the film were combined into one for the Hong Kong market with a run time of 187 minutes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teo|first=Stephen|title=King Hu's A Touch of Zen |year=2007|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=8|isbn=978-962-209-815-2}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nSet in a remote mountain village in [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], the 14th century CE, the story is largely seen through the eyes of Gu, a well-meaning but unambitious scholar and painter, with a tendency towards being clumsy and ineffectual. A stranger arrives in town and requests his portrait painted by Gu, but his real objective is to bring a female fugitive back to the city for execution on behalf of the [[Eastern Depot|East Chamber]] guards. The fugitive, Yang, is befriended by Gu, and together they plot against the corrupt Eunuch Wei who wants to eradicate all trace of her family after her father attempts to warn the Emperor of the eunuch's corruption. His daughter fled, and the saintly and powerful Abbot Hui Yuan intervened to protect them.\n\nThe stranger, Yang and her friends are all superior warriors. The stranger has a special flexible sword that bends and that he can wear within his belt, making him seem unarmed.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the film is that Gu is a non-combatant all the way through the film and only becomes involved when he sleeps with Yang. Upon doing so, he is no longer the na\u00efve bumbling innocent, but instead becomes confident and assertive, and when Yang's plight is revealed, he insists on being part of it \u2013 and even comes up with a fiendish \"Ghost Trap\" for the East Chamber guards. This is a plan to use a supposedly haunted site to play tricks on the guards to make them believe they are prey to the undead.\n\nIn the aftermath, Gu walks through the carnage laughing at the ingenuity of his plan until the true cost of human life dawns upon him. He sees Abbot Hui and his followers arrive to help bury the dead.\n\nAfter the battle, Gu is unable to find Yang, who he is told has left him and does not want him to follow her. He tracks her down at the monastery of Abbot Hui, where she has given birth to a child by Gu and become a nun. She tells Gu that their destiny together has ended and gives Gu their child. Later, when Gu and the child are tracked down by Hsu Hsien-Chen, the evil commander of Eunuch Wei's army, Yang and General Shi come to Gu's rescue. Abbot Hui and four of his monks also arrive to fight Hsu. After Hsu fakes repentance in order to surprise attack Abbot Hui, a battle begins in which Hsu is killed and Yang, Shi, and Abbot Hui are all badly injured (the latter bleeding golden blood). The film famously ends with the injured Yang staggering toward a silhouetted figure, presumably Abbot Hui, seen meditating with the setting sun forming a halo around his head, an image suggesting the Buddha and enlightenment.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hsu Feng]] as Yang Hui-zhen ({{zh|first=t|t=\u694a\u60e0\u8c9e|p=|labels=no}}), the main protagonist, a female knight-errant.\n*Shih Chun ({{zh|first=t|t=\u77f3\u96cb|p=Sh\u00ed Ju\u00e0n|labels=no}}) as Gu Sheng-tsai ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9867\u7701\u9f4b|p=G\u00f9 Sh\u011bngzh\u0101i|labels=no}}), a scholar and painter who later involves in ''Jianghu''.\n*Bai Ying ({{zh|first=t|t=\u767d\u9df9|labels=no}}) as General Shi Wen-qiao ({{zh|first=t|t=\u77f3\u554f\u6a35|p=|labels=no}}) who assists Yang to escape when disguising as a blind person\n*Xue Han ({{zh|first=t|t=\u859b\u6f22|labels=no}}) as General Lu Ding-an ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9b6f\u5b9a\u5eb5|p=|labels=no}}) who protests Yang when disguising as a doctor of [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]\n*[[Roy Chiao]] as Abbot Hui-yuan ({{zh|first=t|t=\u6167\u5706|labels=no}}), the Chan monk \n*[[Tien Peng]] ({{zh|first=t|t=\u7530\u9d6c|labels=no}}) as Ouyang Nian ({{zh|first=t|t=\u6b50\u967d\u5e74|labels=no}}) who works for the [[Eastern Depot]]\n*Cao Jian ({{zh|c=\u66f9\u5065|labels=no}}) as Xu Zheng-qing ({{zh|c=\u5f90\u6b63\u6e05|labels=no}}), local magistrate\n*Zhang Bing-yu as Sheng-tsai's mother\n*[[Wang Jui|Wang Rui]] as Men Da or Mun Ta ({{zh|c=\u9580\u9054|p=M\u00e9n D\u00e1|labels=no}})\n*[[Miao Tien]] as Nie Qiu ({{zh|c=\u81ec\u9011|labels=no}}), one of Mun Ta's advisors\n*[[Han Ying-chieh]] as Chief Commander Xu Xian-chun\n*Wan Zhong-shan ({{zh|first=t|t=\u842c\u91cd\u5c71|labels=no}}) as Lu Qiang ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9b6f\u5f37|labels=no}})\n*Liu Chu as one of the Magistrate's men\n*Gao Ming as one of the Magistrate's men\n*Lu Zhi as Mun Ta's guard\n*Jia Lushi as Yang Lian, the protagonist Yang's father \n*Cheung Wen-men as Tao Lung\n*[[Jackie Chen Sao Lung]] (''uncredited stuntman'' not to be confused with Jackie Chan)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ScsV3kt2lbcC&pg=PA113|title=King Hu's A Touch of Zen|first=Stephen|last=Teo|date=1 November 2006|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=9789622098152|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n*Long Fei as a guard\n*[[Sammo Hung]] as guard/soldier\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''A Touch of Zen'' was shot in Taiwan by [[King Hu]] and was funded by Taiwanese production company Union Film Company.<ref name=\"Teo-p2\">{{cite book |last1=Teo |first1=Stephen |title=King Hu's A Touch of Zen |date=2006 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=978-962-209-815-2 |page=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://affif-sitepublic-media-prod.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pdf/0001/04/ec5d8afc0561813cbf1badc63d42919bcd796c36.pdf|publisher=Cannes Film Festival|title=A Touch of Zen|access-date=30 November 2017}}</ref> In his book on the film, Stephen Teo suggested that the film has roots in [[Hong Kong cinema]], noting the bulk of both Taiwanese and Hong Kong actors and crew members.<ref name=\"Teo-p2\" /> With Hu's idea of invoking traditional Chinese culture in his films, ''A Touch of Zen'' contains Beijing opera scores and references to Chinese poetry like Li Bai's well-known poem \"Drinking Alone in the Moonlight\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Hector |title=Questions of Chinese Aesthetics: Film Form and Narrative Space in the Cinema of King Hu |journal=Cinema Journal |date=1998 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=79 |doi=10.2307/1225736|jstor=1225736 }}</ref>\n\nThe bamboo forest sword fight, a ten-minute confrontation, is said to have taken twenty-five days to shoot.
