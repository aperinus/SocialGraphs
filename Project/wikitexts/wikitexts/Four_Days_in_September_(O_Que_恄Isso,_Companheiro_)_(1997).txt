It is a dramatized version of the [[1969 kidnapping of the United States Ambassador to Brazil]], [[Charles Burke Elbrick]], by members of [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]] (MR-8) and [[A\u00e7\u00e3o Libertadora Nacional]] (ALN).\n\nIt was nominated as Best Foreign Language Film at the 1998 [[Academy Awards]].<ref name=\"Oscars1998\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1998 |title=The 70th Academy Awards (1998) Nominees and Winners |access-date=13 October 2015 |work=oscars.org}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe film is \"loosely based\" on the 1979 [[memoir]] ''O Que \u00c9 Isso Companheiro?'' (in [[English language|English]]: ''What's It, Mate?''), written by politician [[Fernando Gabeira]].<ref name=\"holden\"/> In 1969, as a member of [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]] (MR-8), a student [[guerrilla]] group, he participated in the abduction of the United States ambassador to Brazil, negotiating to gain release of leftist political prisoners. MR-8 was protesting the recent takeover of Brazil by a military government and seeking the release of political prisoners. But, the military increased its repression of dissent, MR-8 and ALN members were tortured by the police, and democracy was not re-established in Brazil until 1985.<ref name=\"holden\"/>\n\nGabeira later became a journalist and politician, elected as congressman from the [[Green Party (Brazil)|Green Party]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is a fictional version of the dramatic events of the 1969 [[kidnap|abduction]] of the [[United States|American]] ambassador [[Charles Burke Elbrick]] (played by [[Alan Arkin]]) in 1969. Elbrick was taken in Rio de Janeiro by the [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]] (MR-8) with help of [[A\u00e7\u00e3o Libertadora Nacional]] (ALN).  Gabeira (played by [[Pedro Cardoso (Brazilian actor)|Pedro Cardoso]] and named Paulo in the film) as a student joins the radical movement after the military takeover of the Brazilian government. He and his comrades, led by Andr\u00e9ia, gradually decided to kidnap the ambassador as a protest, and are shown mostly planning and executing the kidnapping. Paulo is portrayed as \"the most intelligent and uncertain of the kidnappers.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/>\n\nThe film explores Paulo's love affair with Andr\u00e9ia, the guerrilla leader. It suggests a kind of friendship developing between Paulo and Elbrick. The ambassador is portrayed as a decent man who shares some of his kidnappers' frustrations regarding the Brazilian military dictatorship, but who feels obligated to follow orders he might disagree with.\n\n==Cast==\nThe main characters include:\n*Paulo / [[Fernando Gabeira]] ([[Pedro Cardoso (Brazilian actor)|Pedro Cardoso]]) - member of the MR-8 guerrilla group and one of the kidnappers.\n*Andr\u00e9ia / Maria ([[Fernanda Torres]]) - the beautiful and tough MR-8 [[guerrilla]]-group leader who falls in love with Paulo/Fernando.\n*[[Charles Burke Elbrick]] ([[Alan Arkin]]) - the American [[ambassador]], who forms a bond with Paulo/Fernando.\n*Jonas / Virg\u00edlio Gomes da Silva ([[Matheus Nachtergaele]]) - member of ALN guerrilla group\n*Marc\u00e3o / [[Franklin Martins]] ([[Luiz Fernando Guimar\u00e3es]]) - second in command to the MR-8 guerrilla group and one of the kidnappers.\n*Ren\u00e9e / Vera S\u00edlvia Magalh\u00e3es ([[Cl\u00e1udia Abreu]]) - member of the MR-8 guerrilla group and one of the kidnappers.\n*Toledo / Joaquim C\u00e2mara Ferreira ([[N\u00e9lson Dantas]]) - member of ALN guerrilla group. He's a Spanish expatriate in Brazil that fought the dictatorship of [[Francoist Spain]]\n*Henrique ([[Marco Ricca]]) - former Navy enlistee and member of the [[National Intelligence Service of Brazil]]\n*Brand\u00e3o ([[Maur\u00edcio Gon\u00e7alves]]) - member of the [[National Intelligence Service of Brazil]]\n*J\u00falio / Cid Benjamin ([[Caio Junqueira]]) - member of the MR-8 guerrilla group and one of the kidnappers.\n*C\u00e9sar / Oswaldo ([[Selton Mello]]) - member of the MR-8 guerrilla group, arrested prior to the kidnapping of the Ambassador.\n*Dona Margarida / Elba Souto-Maior ([[Fernanda Montenegro]])\n*L\u00edlia ([[Alessandra Negrini]]) - wife of Henrique\n*Mowinkel ([[Fisher Stevens]])\n\n==Reception==\nThe film had mixed reviews, in part because of its fictionalizing Brazilian history, and its uneasy portrayal of terrorist activities by student radicals. [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"''Four Days in September'' is an uneasy hybrid of political thriller and high-minded meditation on terrorism, its psychology and its consequences.\"<ref name=\"holden\">[ STEPHEN HOLDEN, Review: ''Four Days in September''/\"The Political Kidnapping Of an Ambassador Retold\"], ''The New York Times'', 30 January 1998, accessed 24 January 2014</ref> He noted that the film suggests the kidnapping was followed by worse political events, with increased repression, and torture of MR-8 members. He describes Cardoso as the most complex character.<ref name=\"holden\"/>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] gave it two stars, saying the film was marked by a \"quiet sadness\" and the \"film examines the way that naive idealists took on more than they could handle.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/four-days-in-september-1998 Roger Ebert, Review: ''Four Days in September'' (1998), 6 February 1998, Roger Ebert website]</ref> He suggests that the film tries to humanize both sides but seems muddled. Ebert writes, \"The point of view is that of a middle-age man who no longer quite understands why, as a youth, he was so sure of things that now seem so puzzling.\"<ref name=\"ebert\"/>\n\n==Awards==\nInternationally, the film was nominated for many awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] by the [[Academy Awards]]. Brazil entered it into the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1997/02_programm_1997/02_Programm_1997.html |title=Berlinale: 1997 Programme |access-date=2012-01-08 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 70th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Brazilian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/f/4_days.html James Berardinelli review: ''Four Days in September'']\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/four-days.shtml ''Four Days in September''], BBC\n*{{IMDb title|id=0119815}}\n*{{Mojo title|fourdaysinseptember}}\n*{{rotten-tomatoes|four_days_in_september}}\n\n{{Bruno Barreto}}\n{{Brazilian submission for Academy Awards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Four Days In September}}\n[[Category:1997 thriller films]]\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:Brazilian thriller films]]\n[[Category:Films about Brazilian military dictatorship]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Bruno Barreto]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rio de Janeiro (city)]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1960s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1969]]\n[[Category:1990s Portuguese-language films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Stewart Copeland]]"}]}}}}
