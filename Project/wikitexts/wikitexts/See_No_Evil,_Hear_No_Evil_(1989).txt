The film stars [[Richard Pryor]] as a blind man and [[Gene Wilder]] as a deaf man who work together to thwart a trio of murderous thieves. This is the third film (in a series of four) featuring Wilder and Pryor, who had appeared previously in the 1976 film ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'' and the 1980 film ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]''. The film was released in the United States on May 12, 1989.\n\nReleased to a mixed to negative critical reception, ''See No Evil...'' was the comic duo's last financially successful film as a screen couple. Their next film together, 1991's ''[[Another You]]'', was a box office failure as well as a critical one, and it proved to be the last collaboration of Pryor and Wilder.\n\n==Plot==\nWallace \"Wally\" Karew ([[Richard Pryor]]), a [[blindness|blind]] man, and David \"Dave\" Lyons ([[Gene Wilder]]), a [[deafness|deaf]] man, meet when Wally applies for a job in Dave's [[New York City]] concession shop.\n\nAfter a brief period of confusion and antagonism, Wally and Dave become close friends. Dave reads lips and guides Wally when they travel, and Wally tells Dave about invisible sources of sound and what people say behind his back. At a local bar, Wally defeats an aggressive bully in a fistfight with assistance from Dave, who uses clock-face directions to tell Wally where his opponent is. Dave hires Wally.\n\nOne morning, as Wally waits outside for the day's newspapers, a man walks into Dave's shop. When the man is approached by a beautiful woman named Eve ([[Joan Severance]]), he quickly removes a gold coin from a suitcase and places it in a box of coins sitting on the counter. The woman takes the suitcase and shoots the man in the stomach as Dave - whose back is turned - reads the information on a box of [[antacid]] pills. Dave neither sees nor hears the shooting, but he notices Eve's legs as she leaves the shop. Wally, who heard the gunshot, walks into the shop and trips over the man's dead body.  Dave then rushes to help Wally and picks up the gun, which Eve left at the scene. When the police arrive, they find Dave and Wally standing over the body with Dave holding the gun. Before they are arrested, Dave tells Wally to collect the coins from the box.\n\nAt the police station, Dave and Wally are interrogated by Captain Emile Braddock ([[Alan North]]), a detective who immediately takes a dislike to them and makes them his prime suspects due to their relative uselessness as witnesses. When Eve and her accomplice Kirgo ([[Kevin Spacey]]) - hoping to recover the coin - arrive to bail them out by posing as attorneys, Wally recognizes Eve's perfume and Dave recognizes her legs, but Braddock ignores them when they insist that she is the killer. Wishing to avoid Eve and Kirgo when they are released, Dave and Wally escape from the police station, but the criminals soon find them. Eve takes the coin from Wally's pocket and telephones her boss Mr. Sutherland ([[Anthony Zerbe]]) for instructions, allowing Dave to learn the criminals' plans by reading her lips. When Kirgo tries to kill Dave and Wally, they use the fistfighting method they learned in the bar to knock him unconscious. They then steal an unattended police car, and drive away with Eve, Kirgo and Braddock chasing them. Working together to guide the patrol car, Dave and Wally evade both the police and the criminals, but they accidentally launch the car onto a waterborne garbage barge.\n\nAfter hiding the police car, the two men walk to a motel and telephone Wally's sister Adele ([[Kirsten Childs]]) for help. The police follow Adele and search her motel room, but she, Wally, and Dave avoid detection, and they drive away after the police have left. Having incorrectly read Eve's lips, Dave believes they need to find a woman named \"Grace George\", but Adele realizes that Eve must have been referring to a resort called \"Great Gorge\". At the resort Wally impersonates a visiting professor. Meanwhile, Dave sneaks into the resort room to steal the coin from Eve. While Dave is digging through her bag Eve comes out of the shower wearing only a towel. Dave gets a huge erection and Eve mistakes it for a gun. Realizing this, Dave makes Eve raise her hands and drop the towel leaving her completely naked. Dave then looks Eve over and slips out of the room. Meanwhile, Adele distracts Kirgo by crashing her car into his. However, Kirgo and Eve kidnap Adele and take her to Sutherland's estate.\n\nAfter a mishap with the car, Dave and Wally put their rescue plan into action, with the result that Adele escapes but the two men are captured. In his study, Sutherland \u2013 who is also blind \u2013 reveals that the coin is a [[room-temperature superconductor]], which is extremely valuable. Kirgo and Sutherland are killed during an argument over sharing the profits from the coin's theft, after which Dave and Wally escape the study and have a violent altercation with Eve and her helicopter pilot. When the police arrive, the remaining criminals are arrested, and Wally and Dave are released having been cleared of the charges. Dave promises to wait for Eve when she gets out of prison. Shortly thereafter, the two men go to a local park and reprise a scene from the beginning of the film by dumping ice-cream cones on each other's head, enjoying each other's company.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Pryor]] as Wallace \"Wally\" Karew\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as David \"Dave\" Lyons\n* [[Joan Severance]] as Eve\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Kirgo\n* [[Alan North]] as Captain Emile Braddock\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Sutherland\n* [[Louis Giambalvo]] as Lieutenant Gatlin\n* [[Kirsten Childs]] as Adele Karew\n* [[John Capodice]] as Scotto\n* [[George Bartenieff]] as Huddelston\n\n== Production ==\n[[Joseph Bologna]] and [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]] wrote the first screenplay of the film and sold it to [[Columbia Pictures]] for $200,000 in 1984. They later sued the studio in the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] for $10 million in damages after being denied the promised additional $500,000 to be paid if Pryor were cast in the film, $25,000 per revision, and five-percent profit. Originally [[Jim Belushi]] was to be cast as the deaf man before Wilder was hired. Principal photography began on August 29, 1988, in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], with [[New York City]], [[Pound Ridge, New York|Pound Ridge]], and the [[Hackensack River]] marshlands serving as locations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=See No Evil, Hear No Evil |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Film/58275-SEE-NOEVILHEARNOEVIL?sid=8c0c8611-5cd3-47ad-9857-d4b5084e8501&sr=17.72831&cp=1&pos=0 |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=AFI Catalog}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n[[TriStar Pictures]] was looking to produce another film starring Wilder and Pryor, but Wilder would only agree to do ''See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' if he was allowed to re-write the script. The studio agreed and ''See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' premiered in May 1989 to mostly negative reviews. Many critics praised Wilder's, Pryor's, and [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performances, but they mostly agreed that the script was absolutely terrible.
